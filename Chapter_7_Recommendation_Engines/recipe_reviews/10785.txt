PLEASE NOTE:  At culinary school the first thing we learned about cookie making is that when you beat the butter/shortening the friction heats it up the dough.  While incorporating the ingredients better it also breaks down the fat in the product.  To correct this all you need to do is refrigerate you dough for about 5 minutes before baking.  Doing so will re-solidify the fats and stop your cookies from over spreading.  This is the base cookie recipe I use for chocolate chip and other cookies, except I use either butter or half shortnenting and half butter.  It just depends on the product I am making.  You will see a HUGE difference if you try this procedure, guaranteed.

Best cookies EVERR!  Instead of shortening I used 2 sticks of butter and they came out PERFECT! I also didnt use so much salt and baked for a few minutes longer. Adding extra m&ms didnt hurt either! YUM!

After reading all the other reviews, I made this using a 1/2 cup of room temp butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening.  They spread slightly on the pan, but not a whole lot, and they had a great flavor.  Also, for my oven, a bake time of 8 1/2 minutes got them pretty well baked, and then I let them sit on the pan for an additional 4 minutes, finishing it up.  Perfect.  I also made a batch of Chocolate Mint M & M cookies by adding a 1/2 cup cocoa to the batter and using candy covered mint pieces.  Heavenly.

Oh My Gosh!!!  I have been looking for a recipe like this for YEARS - just like the cookies I used to get at a shop when I was a kid.  These were delicious - a little crispy, a little chewy.  I used unsalted butter and next time may reduce the sugar a bit.  I thought 3/4 c M&M added to the batter was a little light, so I added a full cup.  Well, the mixer smashed them up so next time I will mix them in by hand.  Also, will only put 3/4 c in as written; I realized that since you push M&Ms onto the cookies once they are on the sheet, you can control how many candies are in each cookie anyways.  Definitely, absolutely a KEEPER!

These cookies are fantastic. There are a lot of people giving negative reviews for flat cookies. Unfortunately they aren't educated enough in baking to know when mostly brown sugar is used the cookies tend to be more flat. Which is why you need to use shortening to make up for that. Butter melts faster and therefore makes cookies spread more. I used half butter flavor shortening and half real butter simply for my own tastes not out of necessity. The other thing is chilling the cookie dough for at least 24 hours will enhance the flavor of the cookies and also make the dough easier to work with. Used my tablespoon cookie scoop to make even cookies. I also prefer my cookies slightly under baked so I only cooked them for 8 min. each. Allow to cool on the cookie sheet for at least 3 min. otherwise they are too fragile to move. Then transferred to a cookie rack. Also keep in mind if cooling on the cookie sheet there will be carry over cooking which can make the cookies crispier. Thanks for a great recipe! Will be used over and over in this household.

I love this recipe. I do not use shortening. I use 2 sticks of butter and I also add semi-sweet chocolate chips. This makes for really good cookies! I have made these every week for my kids lunch and they love them. I am surprised at how many cookies it makes up! Just for fun...I made 1/8 tsp balls and it made cookies the size of those 100 calorie cookies. My two year old did not waste any cookie, because it was the right size! I counted 130 small cookies thats not counting the ones we ate from each batch out of the oven!

This recipe falls far short of spectacular!  It tastes like store-bought cookies...so, not good.  Try substituting butter for shortening - something I realized I should have done after I'd already made the fatal error of using shortening, which is rarely a good cookie ingredient...what was I thinking?

KID NOTE: My son thinks they taste good, but he's a toddler and doesn't have the most refined palate as yet.

DH LOVED these cookies!  I used butter instead of shortening.  

The cookies flattened out a lot after I took them out of the oven and were sitting on the pan so I added more flour (about 1/4 cup) to the batter and the rest turned out awesome!

I was looking for a traditional M&M cookie recipe and this is it! They were exactly what I was looking for and were delicious!! Because they taste like traditional M&M cookies, one might say they taste store bought but i can assure you they do not.

These were very good!  I used a combo of shortening and butter, omitted the salt and increased the vanilla to 3/4 tsp.  I was interested in trying others' recommendations of adding peanutbutter and oats, so I added some to the dough for the last dozen cookies.  My husband liked the ones without the pb and oats, but I think I like the pb/oats ones better.  I'd make these ones again!

Excellent cookies!  Normally I would sub butter for the shortening, but this time I ran out of butter so I ended up using the shortening.  I'm glad I did because these cookies are perfect as written!  Soft and chewy, just like the cookies my grocery store's bakery sells.  I did go ahead and add a handfull of milk chocolate chips too because we love chocolate in this house.  Also, if you don't want the cookies to flatten out, you can try chilling the dough and cooling the cookie sheets in between batches.  This recipe is a keeper, and I will always use shortening in it.

After reading a bunch of the comments on this recipe, I was concerned because my plan was to use unsalted butter and I was afraid of flat-cookie syndrome. Here are the tweaks we made: 2 sticks of unsalted butter, 3 cups of cake flour, and I leveled off the brown sugar and only added a scant half cup of the white sugar, and we refridgerated the dough in between batches. They came out perfect, and I'm using this same dough now for chocolate chip cookies and it coming out perfect as well.

I knew from the get-go that this would not be a cookie I'd be particularly fond of because of the higher ratio of brown sugar to white sugar.  But I also knew that Hubs would like them because this produces a softer cookie.  I really dislike flat chocolate chip cookies, so I was sure to refrigerate the dough awhile, until somewhat firm. Yes, they were soft - and for my tastes too sweet, the added sweetness of the M&Ms making them even more so.  Hubs did give a nod of approval, just as I thought he would.

Theses cookies taste great! As other viewers have stated, I use butter instead of shortening. The directions for these cookies is minimal. I always mix all the wet ingredients and the sugars in one bowl and the dry in another. After cooking the first batch of my cookies I realized they were extremely flat. If you add 1 to 1 and 1/2 cups of flour they come out great! Good luck.

OMG, these are the best cookies EVER!  The only change I made was using 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco and 1 stick of butter in place of the 1 cup shortening.  I have made them 4 times and they turn out perfect every time.  FABULOUS cookies....

Unlike many reviewers on this one, I made no changes. I used shortening as the recipe states. Many complain of flat cookies and they subbed butter for the shortening. Using butter will result in a flatter cookie. With the shortening, my cookies did not flatten into pancakes and my kids gobbled them up after school. I'm going to try sandwiching some ice cream in the middle of two :)

I don't know what some of the other reviewers did, but these cookies did not come out salty at all.  I love them, and I'm not a big cookie eater.  My kids devoured them.  I used shortening like the recipe stated and they were just as good as when I used butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are so easy to make (love that it's only 1 bowl!).  I made these for 2 Christmas Cookie Exchanges I'm in this year and used the holiday M&Ms.  I made 4 batches - which turned out about 21 1/2 dozen (258) small & medium sized cookies (I started out making them a little too big.  They really only need about 1 & tsp. per drop for average size - they spread out more than I expected).  Also, 1 average size bag of M&Ms is just over 1 and 1/2 cups so I just put that much in the the actual batter and use the remaining ones in the bag to top off the cookies as the recipe suggests.  So - 1 bag per batch.  Hope this helps others!

I made this with 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 tsp salt & 1 cup of dark chocolate M&M's (plus xtra for pressing in tops).  They came out a little flat but they taste fine.  I will make again for sure.

Delicious!  I made these for the youth at our church when we packed our shoeboxes this year.  They loved them and I didn't bring any home!  The only substitution I made is I used all margarine in place of the shortening.  I also refrigerated my dough for about 45 minutes and lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper.  Perfect!!!  I am definitely adding this to my recipe box!   Thanks!

12-20-10 Made these again for our Youth Christmas cantata.  They were once again all eaten by our small group and I made over 70.  They looked so good with the holiday M&Ms, too! :O)

Nov 2011  Once again I made these for our OCC shoebox packing party.  They quickly disappeared!!

I don't think I've ever given a recipe on this site less than three stars, but I guess there's a first time for everything.  This cookie recipe was a waste of ingredients - what a shame. I followed the recipe exactly.  The only flavor in the cookie comes from biting a candy piece. Otherwise, the strongest flavor is shortening.   I've had many a delicious cookie made with shortening before, but this one...man. Maybe it would help to use butter instead, but I don't think that would even solve the whole problem.  Even my preteen daughters, who eat ANY sweet, took a few bites and said no thanks.  Sorry, Robbi, but I just can't recommend this one.

Quite good. I made think mine were on the small side, and so they turned out more crispy than I like. My oven was also a little hot. A tip on these cookies; it's hard to know when to take them out because at 9 min they are very soft. The trick is to put them on parchment paper and take them out even if you do think they are too soft at 9 min. Slide them off the parchment onto a cooling rack. They crisp up, I promise. I cut this recipe in half and got something like 45 cookies out of it. More than enough for me! Again, mine were small but I followed the recipe used a measuring teaspoon to ball out the dough like you would a melon.

These cookies are awesome!!  Only thing I did different was I used 2 sticks of salted butter.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  I cooked these at 375 for 8 minutes and left them on the pan for about 5 minutes after taking them out and they were perfect!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Will make many times in the future.

Great cookies!  I am often disappointed with cookie recipes (well, all recipes usually), but these were very good!  Didn't change a thing.

This recipe was great. Rather than using shortening I used a cup of butter and then also added one small package of instant vanilla pudding to the flour mixture, as that also prevents spreading.......the cookies did NOT spread at all and came out perfectly.

The cookies were great and a lot of fun to make.  My kids especially liked loading up the cookies with the treats - we used chocolate chips, smarties, and M & Ms as well.  They are really colourful and a great standby.

I've made these before and remembered, after baking them, that I needed to reduce the sugar a bit.  I use 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 tsp salt.  My cookies don't come out flat using only butter; I whip butter and sugar first until fluffy, then add the eggs, then the vanilla. I add dry ingredients until just blended. One small bag of M&M's works great.

Of course I used real butter.  1/2 salted and 1/2 unsalted.  These spread a lot so I would recommend refriderating before baking - if you use butter.

Great recipe! Easy to make, I had my 5 yr old son help put the candies into the cookies before popping them in the oven. Tastes just like m&m cookies I've had at bakeries. Recommend to everyone!

Made the recipe as is stated, using butter flavored shortening instead of actual butter (as many other reviewers suggested).  We loved them!  They were tasty, delicious, and easy.  This recipe will be a keeper!

I chose to replace the shortening w/ butter.  I also used the mini m&m's in lieu of regular sized m&m's next time I might try a combo of butter and butter flavour shortening.

Used 2 sticks of butter as other reviewers suggested, and I followed the recipe otherwise.  My 3-year-old helped to make these.  They turned out yummy! I am updating this a few days later.  These cookies became stale very quickly, and I even kept them in ziplock bags.  I'll probably use another recipe next time.

I wasn't all that impressed with these cookies.  They taste decent, but I wish I could have just made me go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe and added some M&M's.  I followed the advice of others and used butter in place of the shortening.  Since I used butter I chilled the dough for a bit before baking.  The cookies come out a bit on the thin and flat side.  They are soft and chewy which I like, but despite the M&M's they just didn't result in a very pretty cookie.

This cookie I just made. Baking for Christmas and I will tell you this is a wonderful tasting cookie. My 3 kids loved it so did the husband. I will now put this in my recipe box for future cookie baking. I did stay with the original recipe the only thing I did was doubled it and came out GREAT!

Everyone at work loved these and my honey couldn't stop eating them! Good idea for the half-melted M&M's I had on hand. I switched the shortening for butter for a better taste, but it came out a little salty, so maybe unsalted butter next time.

As written, this recipe makes super flat cookies. Yes it appears that you may be able to follow some reviewers tips on helping with this issue. But as written, these are as flat as cookies can get. Taste is good, not great.

These are really good. However, I don't ever use shortening in my cookies - only butter. That's the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars.

Based on some of the other reviews, I used 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening and 1/2 cup butter and the results were just perfect. The cookies were soft and chewy. I'm not sure why some experienced dry-crumbly cookies...they may have not mixed the batter enough??? I can't wait to make these again...DELICIOUS!

These are wonderful, and they took me practically no time to make! And they do NOT taste anything like store-bought cookies, as some reviewers have stated. I scaled back the sugar and only used only 1 cup of regular white sugar with a tsp of molasses added (since I had no brown sugar), 1 cup room temperature butter instead of shortening, and added 1/2 tsp almond extract in addition to the vanilla. I used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour (I find it enhances sweets more so than regular flour), 1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, and cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp. Next time I will omit the salt completely as they didn't really seem to need it at all. I mixed in the m&m's by hand so they wouldn't break, baked on lightly greased parchment paper for exactly 8 minutes, and they came out *perfect*. They spread out well but not too much, so they were just the right thickness and soft! After they cooled, I put them in a plasticware container with a slice of sandwich bread, and after several hours of sitting in the container, the cookies don't have that weird plastic container taste cookies and cakes seem to get from being stored in plasticware, and the cookies were just as soft and crumbly and perfect as when they came out of the oven. I will definitely make these again and again! =)

These cookies are amazing! My husband said they might be his new favorite cookie, and I'm always making different kinds of cookies. I took the advice of some reviewers and replaced the cup of shortening with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening. When I tasted the batter I was nervous they would be too buttery, but they came out perfectly. They taste just like something you'd get from Mrs. Field's Cookies or the Cookie Company! I found 9 minutes to be a perfect baking time (find that to be true for most cookies), and then I left them on the cookie sheet for about 4 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made these twice. Once making recipe with shortening (as written) and once using butter. They look much prettier if you use the shortening, but taste better using the butter. Also I decrease the salt to 1/4 tsp.

I made these for my friend's birthday potluck and everyone loved them. I thought the cookies would be sweet without the m&ms so I only put in a half cup in the batter and pushed one or two candies into the cookies after they were dropped on the pan.     The only problem I had with these cookies were that they spread out a lot more than I thought they would. In my second batch I piled the drops up higher and spaced the cookies out on the pan and I came out with much prettier looking cookies.

Excellent -- don't substitute butter for shortening, I tried that the first time and they were a crumbly mess.  Does anyone know any tricks to keep the M&Ms on top from cracking in the oven?

I made these cookies today, and I loved how easy they were to make. The one thing I would do different though, is add the m&m's to each cookie after spooning them on the cookie sheet.I had to add more m&m's to the batter, since there didn't seem to be enough. I like how the cookies aren't overly sweet either.

Made these today, they were yummy. Although I made a few changes for personal reasons. I used 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup margarine and 1/2 tsp salt. Chill for about 30 mins before baking. Will definitely be making these again.

First of all, Im NOT a huge cookie person; however I made these for my kids and I fell in LOVE with the dough and instantly knew it would become my favorite recipe ever for cookies and I was right!  I followed the advice of  others and used a slick of butter and 1/2 C shortening.  Followed everything else to a "t".  I put dough in fridge for 30 min bc I had to run to pick kids up from school.  The cookies are SO YUMMY!  They are chewy and NOT flat at all.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.  Right after trying the cookies, I was forced to make another batch.  I knew these wouldn't last until my husband got home tonight.

These are delicious cookies! However, I would recommend cutting back on the salt. M&M brand candies are full of salt and adding 1 tsp. of additional salt is way too much! Maybe try 1/8 tsp.instead.  Otherwise very tasty.

these were good.... I did what some others did and used butter instead of shortening...although shortening does have its uses in my kitchen, in my cookies is one place it absolutely doesn't belong, especially that much!! to the reviewer who said these tasted like store bought, it's the shortening...they use it cause it's cheaper than butter

I took the advise of others and did half shortening, half butter and it turned out great.  I also refrigerated the dough beforehand and put the cookie trays in the fridge before baking and between batches.  They turned out beautifully.

Just made the mix to refrigerate overnight to make for a party tomorrow.  After reading many reviews I found an article that talked about fridging the mix for optimum results (taste tested and all) at 24-36 hours.  Article said at 36 hours it made a huge difference because the flavors were given time to meld or whatever - I don't have more than 12 hours but thought I'd share.  I use the tub of Smart Start buttery spread for cookies and it comes out fine as long as I refrigerate it first - otherwise it overspreads and gets "flat"; did 1/2 cup M&Ms and 1/2 cup ghirardelli milk chocolate chips - stirred it in, as one other reviewer warned that the mixer will break the M&M's.  Thanks for all the tips, everyone!  I learned something new tonight =P

UPDATE: The first 2 batches of cookies I did turned out great!  But because the mix was out of the fridge they became less firm and more gooey, so my last batch came out really flat.  So make sure your mix is thoroughly fridged if you don't want them coming out flat (if you are like me and made the cookies with butter and no shortening).  To avoid the cracked/melted looking M&Ms on top, when you take the cookies of the oven wait 2-3 minutes then put fresh M&Ms on top, pushing them in slightly.  That's how you get the cookies to look good!  I did 8 minutes per other people's recommendations but it was not enough - I'd say 9 minutes in the oven and then another 5 on the cookie sheet to cool is good.

Very good cookie! I used butter flavored Crisco, and had to bake them a little longer than stated, but I think I made them bigger! I also didn't used as much salt, but that was my personal choice, I'm trying to cut salt from my diet. I baked some of the cookies on my Tupperware silicone pad and some on an air bake sheet. Both were easy to remove from the sheet and both cooked very nice. Only tip I have is from my Grandma, who says to beat the  out of the sugar egg butter mix(cream for like 5 minutes in mixer), and once you add flour to only mix until combined!

Excellent!!!  I followed the recipe to a t and they turned out amazing.  The own downfall, is that to say that this recipe makes 72 cookies--those must be pretty small cookies...I made a double batch and only got about 5 dozen...

I was looking for a quick recipe that didnt call for many ingredients...this is because my daughter decided the night before her last day of school before Christmas break she wanted to bring something to her homeroom class...We came across this recipe and and decided to try it...I read through a few of the reviews and took a few tips from others.  I didnt use the shortening, I used butter instead, and I didnt measure the M&M's just used a little over half the bag in the mix, and the rest on top of it.  I also added just a bit more flour then called for (after I mixed all the stuff together) just to make sure they didnt flatten to much.  They turned out pretty good!  Defiantly gonna have to try this one again

I used 1/2 c shortening and 1/2 c butter.  I also chilled the cookies for a bit before baking to prevent them from flattening out too much.  They were great!

Great cookies!  I used 1 cup of 'I can't believe it's not butter' in place of the shortening and omitted the salt because of this.  I took advise of another reviewer and cooked the cookies for 8 1/2 to 9 minutes and let cool on a rack for about 4 minutes.  Perfect.  Thank you for the recipe.

Beautiful in appearance; flat in flavor. Tasting the dough, I crossed my fingers that the cookies would be better. Normally, I make mysef sick on the dough :) not the case here. :( The cookies, while pretty and perfectly baked, lack any flavor...aside from the chocolatey treasures hidden throughout. I decided to look at some reviews of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes on AR (based on reviews) and found that it must come down to the shortening! I'd rather have slightly flatter cookies but FLAVORFUL cookies, so I'll tray again with butter. Maybe pop in the fridge for a bit before baking.

I'm not sure why this recipe has any low star ratings... the person who said the dough was crumbly obviously didn't do something right despite what they might say... there is no way if you follow the recipe exactly that will happen!  My M&M's stayed in the dough, the dough was delicious and my cookies came out perfect!!  I will def. make again, next time I might try adding some peanut butter at the request of my daughter!!  Thank you for sharing, this recipe has a great rating for a reason!!

Excellent cookies! I made them with Mini Eggs instead of M&Ms. I crushed/chopped the eggs to put in the dough, then placed a whole egg on top of each cookie. I didn't do anything else differently from the recipe except maybe a bit more vanilla. I also made them regular-size and got 30 cookies out of it - baked at 350 for about 15-17 minutes.

I think these are pretty good!  My only changes were to decrease the salt by half and to use 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup M&Ms because I think they taste better that way (more chocolaty).  I ended up with only 21 cookies, but we like our cookies on the big side.  I thought the cookies had quite a nice flavor, but I'm not a big fan of the taste of butter in chocolate chip cookies for some reason so if you love butter flavor you may want to sub half the shortening for butter.  The only kind of weird thing is that my cookies are a good 3/4 inch tall!  I think it may be because I added an extra 1/4 cup flour (the dough was very sticky) but it still seems odd.  Next time I'll make sure to use the exact amount of flour.  In any case, extra thick cookies aren't really a problem.  More cookie in every bite :)

Pretty good cookies.

Followed some previous reviews and made a few tweaks, switched shortening for butter, skimped just a tad on the butter, salt, and sugars and added about a quarter cup of flour.

Sadly the family's not a huge fan of m&m cookies to begin with cause of the crunchy candy part, and these were good but not outstanding, so they probably won't be made again sometime soon.

They look very pretty with the Easter m&m's though. (:

Substituted butter for shortening because I avoid shortening when possible.  They turned out wonderful!  Perfect, not too flat.  My family loves them and I am thinking I should have made a double batch.  Definitely a keeper!

I used butter flavored shortening and made exactly as directed. Turned out beautiful and tasty.

DO NOT MAKE THESE COOKIES! THEY DO NOT REMOVE FROM PAN!!! I needed to make cookies for a party,and I wanted to make an M&M cookies, so after googling, I came across this recipe. I tried it out and an hour later, I am stuck with several sheets of burned cookies, and even after greasing pans, these cookies still would not come off of the pan. This is such a dissapointment, that I made an account here just to review it. Now its 9:38, and I have NOTHING for the party tomorrow. Well, I know I'm not baking this again.

This is very similar to the recipe my mom has always used for M&M cookies - except hers uses 2 tsp vanilla and only 2 1/4 cup flour.  The cookie is typically flat, crispy, and chewy - not at all cakey - just the way I like them!  The full tsp of salt can be a bit overwhelming in the batter - but mellows once cooked and helps to balance the sweetness of the M&Ms.  I have made this with shortening (with mom growing up) and with butter (today - on my own with no shortening in the house)...and they are great both ways!  Looking forward to introducing this Christmas tradition to my 3-year-old son this year!

This is a really good cookie recipe, will definitely remake these over and over. There was nothing I would change about it, although we did use butter instead of shortening which I think made the dough slightly less thick. Very hard not to eat all the dough!

These were good.  They were kind of puffy cookies, but still soft and good.  I used half unsalted butter, half organic shortening.

Really good cookies... a little on the crsipy side but great flavor. Used shortening first couple times made but going to use butter next time. Better to undercook a bit and let sit on the pan for a few min after out of the oven if you don't like a really crispy cookie.. Turnes out a bit softer that way.

The cookies were very crumbly and fell apart. (I used butter flavored shortening.) The girls in my cooking class whipped these up and though they ate them, they didn't rave. Won't make these again.

OMG!! This was the recipe that I've been looking for! There is a local place tat sells M&M cookies that my family loves and these taste just like them! I was a little afraid to use shortening... as I was adding it in I couldn't believe I was feeding this to my kids but, I followed directions and the end result is an amazing cookie.

This is the only brown sugar based, chocolate chip type cookie recipe that I have ever found that did not spread flat as a pancake when baked, it was a little thicker and soft and chewy like store bakery cookies but tasted way better. I made a batch and just added the m&m's on top before baking then with the rest of the batter I stirred in white chips and dried cranberries, super yummy. You can do absolutely anything with this recipe and it freezes well. It's a keeper!

I have been searching for an M&M cookie that doesn't come out cakey and this is it!! I did use half shortening and 1/2 real butter. They are perfect. Great at Christmas with red and green M & M's!

I have made this recipe multiple times and it is always a favorite. they are usually gone before the day is done even when I make all 72! People drive to my house for these (  :  I did try a very tasty alteration to this recipe, I added 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter to the dough ( with the butter) and I used reeses piecies instead of M&Ms, my husband said they were the best he has ever eaten. I urge you to give it a try. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!

Very quick and easy to prepare and very good flavor.  The only changes I made were to use just unsalted sweet cream butter and no shortening and I upped the vanilla extract to  2 tsps.  My kids loved them so they served their purpose!

Although these are good cookies, mine were flat! I am not the best cookie baker. Not sure why since I have baked SO many and never had problems until recently. I am going to blame it on my oven however everything else seems to come out fine. I did use butter as suggested by others.

These were perfect!  My kids had a blast making these with me, especially squishing the extra candies on the top.  :-)  Very easy recipe to work with.  After reading the other reviews, we too added extra vanilla and substituted with butter.  Tasted wonderful!  We plan on using this recipe at the various seasons when you get special holiday colored M&M's.

made these twice so far...they are amazing!!! one of the only cookies i have found that are perfectly crispy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside...mmm...if your batter is a bit runny (which mine were)just add a bit more flour to thicken it up (as told by previous reviewer).

This recipe was easy to make and came out great.  I used butter instead of shortening and patted them down.  My 4 year old son helped "decorate" them with M&Ms.  Around 9 minutes without too much brown around the edge was perfect for chewy cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!!

As others had mentioned I also changed the recipe to 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  I also used a cookie scoop and then pressed the "ball" of dough into a bowl of m & m's and then flipped it over and put the m & m side up on a cookie sheet rather than mixing any in with the dough.  It turned out great that way and make the cookies more festive since you can see all of the M&M's.  Great basic M&M cookie recipe!

So yummy!  I had to use up some leftover holiday M&Ms so decided to make these for our camping trip this weekend.  I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 and did 1 cup shortening with 1/2 a cup butter.  Delicious!  I think we are going to try making cookie S'mores tonight with these.

Hubby and I made our first homemade cookies today using this recipe. In 25 years we have always used packaged mix. We both absolutely loved these.  Not to sweet. I made one change as per other reviews. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  The cooking time was different for me due to my altitude and oven. 15 Minutes was perfect.

These rank among the best cookies I've ever made. I did 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening. I also refrigerated the dough before baking. I saw a poor review below that it tastes like store-bought. I thought they tasted like bakery-bought, so that's a win in my book! I will definitely make these again!

This is an AWESOME M&M cookie recipe!!! I wish I could give it 10 stars. I did modify and did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening and they didn't spread hardly at all. I fell a little short on the M&Ms and I only had 1 cup so to make up for the loss I added semi-sweet choc. chips, white choc. chips, and some chopped pecans and whoa was that cookie out of this world! It would have been just as great if I would have had just the M&ms in the correct amount. I use this site all the time and I am telling you that this is a great recipe just change the shortening to butter and shortening. I'm gonna try to add my pic to the bunch so ya'll can see how mine turned out with the changes I made.

With a couple of minor adjustments this is my go-to cookie recipe. Swapping out the margerine for butter really makes the cookie part much more flavorful and I add a full 2 teaspoons of vanilla flavoring. One step I would add to the directions is to refergerate the dough until good and cold. I usually mix one day and bake the next and those batches never flattened out the way the batch I put straight into the oven did. I also usually cut out the 1/2 cup of white sugar because I prefer a less sweet cookie. Although I have yet to try it, I suggest adding less butter or sugar for those having problems with their cookies spreading too much.

I did half butter, half shortening, creamed the butter/shortening and sugar before adding the egg, and put it in the fridge for a few hours before baking.  They turned out beautifully. Not too thin, not too thick.  If you really want to reduce spreading, scoop cookies on to parchment paper and put in the freezer for 15 min to overnight, then straight in the oven.  They might take an extra minute or two to be done, but won't spread nearly as much.  The family is loving them. I've heard they are "phenomenal" and "better than the store bakery ones" which I'll take as a compliment. :)

I love these cookies! I didn't change anything at all. I just ran across this recipe 2 weeks ago and can't stop baking these cookies. After I mixed my dough I also refrigerated for 15 minutes. This avoids the cookie from being a flat widespread cookie. Thank you for this recipe! Happy Holidays :)

Amazing recipe, why did i not think to bake these cookies earlier for my kids? turned out amazing and i listened to a previous reviewer who advised to put the dough in the refrigerator for 5 mins before spooning onto the baking tray. I also only had my cookies in for a max of 13 mins and they were perfect, soft, chewy just right. Have baked it for a friends son's bday party tomorrow but will definitely be making it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have seen this recipe on here for years, and I finally decided to try it. I made a 1/2 recipe and used mini M&M's and did half butter and half shortening. I got 30 cookies from half the recipe. They weren't bad, but just tasted so much like something from the grocery store bakeries. They also got hard, after they cooled, which is rare for when I bake cookies. That also reminded me of the store packaged cookies. I guess, I like more of that homemade taste.

I did NOT change a thing and would recommend against it! When you take cookies out of the oven and they're warm, they do taste of shortening BUTTTTTTTTTT after they have cooled off you can no longer taste shortening! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe! Thanks Robbi!

So good!  I made with butter instead of shortening.  My cookies always end up flat (these did, too) even with refrigerating the dough before cooking, but they tasted amazing!  So good!

I was looking for a recipe to use up Easter m&ms and came across this one. My nieces and I made them this morning, and they turned out awesome :) I used half shortening and half marg because I didn't have enough of either, and the girls actually lightly rolled them before we baked them. They spread out perfectly, and taste fantastic! Thank you for sharing!

These were amazing!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Only they were very fragile. I don't mean chewy and soft. I mean falling apart at the least touch soft.  Otherwise my whole family enjoyed these.

These cookies taste wonderful! Although, I found myself having to bake them several times. I put them in for the designated amount of time and had to put them in for 2 minute increments several times. Also I didn't add the eminems into the batter, I put them on top of the cookies as soon as I took them out of the oven. Also, just a tip, try reeses pieces, they taste great (despite the fact they the were a bit undercooked at first) also, the batter was very very dry, so I had to add milk to it, about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup. They tastes very "home made" to put it nicely. Some people may think that is a compliment, but.... It's not. Sorry. Also they did it a little heavy on the crisco, maybe next time I will replace that with butter so it will have the typical buttery "melt in your mouth" feel. Adding the m&ms on top was a nice job, but these cookies were not what I had expected.

These were just OK - they taste like a sugar cookie with M & Ms in them.  Next time I'll take a toll house cookie recipe and substitute the candies.  Not bad, just average.  I substituted margarine for the shortening but that shouldn't have made a difference.

I thought these were awesome.  After reading the reviews I exchanged the 1 cup of shortening with 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening.  I used green and red m&m's for Christmas!  So happy I may make them again today!!!

I took other reviewer's advice and did 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening.  Also, I did them for a Christmas party so I used mint M&Ms which made these really good!  The mint one's are a bit bigger so I would suggest not adding any to the dough and just pushing them into each dough ball, that way they are more evenly dispersed.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good.  I also substituted 2 sticks of butter for the shortening.  I used a pinch less salt than called for a broke up the chocolate candies before adding them in.  Overall, I gave this a four because the dough still tastes better than the cookies :)

I substituted the Shortening for 2 sticks of butter. My cookies have turned out flatter than a pancake.. In act they melted and the M&M's are the only thing that gives them height. I at first thought perhaps I made a mistake, but I double checked my ingredients [I did use real butter which I know can be a problem with funky cookies] and measurements. I have made many a better M&M cookies...

These cookies are FABULOUS!  I happened upon a leftover bag of M&M's and ran across this recipe.  My kids and I had a great time making these.  They looked beautiful, tasted even better and were so easy to make.  This will be a recipe that I hold onto forever.  Made the cookies using butter flavored Crisco and mini-M&M's.  Out of the oven they were slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Never have run across such a perfect cookie recipe.

Not my type of cookie, but my 4 kids like them. They are a little salty, so reducing salt is a good tip. I cooked mine without reading reviews...knew better. They are crisp and oily. I used mini m&ms and they stay in the batter with no problem. I'm more of a chewy cookie person, so this will be my last time making these. I'd rate 3 stars if my kids wouldn't have said otherwise.

These cookies are amazing! I made them for the 4th of July. It is hard to only eat one! The only way I tweaked the recipe is I put in a tiny bit more vanilla and probably 1/4 c of extra m&ms. Also, I used half crisco and half butter

I really don't know what went wrong!! I read all the reviews and the majority were positive, so I was very confident. The recipe was easy to make, but as far as anything else, it wasn't good! The dough was crumbly and hard to shape into a ball. When I tried to put the candies in, the ball crumbled and fell apart. They smelt good, but when I tasted them, all I could taste was salt! I'll try again some other time, but overall it was a disappointment.

Fantastic old-fashioned recipe that tastes great. I've made it with butter and butter-flavored shortening - both taste great. I use mini-M&Ms and do not mix them in the batter.  I roll a small ball of dough in the palm of my hand and then roll it in the M&Ms leaving one side bare for the bottom of the pan. When the cookie bakes, the M&Ms sink into the dough and are also colorful on top. Yummy and colorful - the family loves them!

Holy Moly! These ROCK! One of the easiest recipes ever as well.  You don't have to add a little flour or add a little this or that to get the dough just right.  They were gone in 2 days.  So, we made more but since we were out of M&M's we used chocolate chips.  Just as good.  This is my go to now!

Great cookies - I used half shortening and half margarine like many so that they did not taste too much like Crisco.

MMMM! I just took the last batch of these out of the oven. I followed the recipe to a tee, and these look amazing. I baked them about 11-13 minutes (but I used a melon baller to drop them, so they were bigger)! 4 stars because they are a little sweet to my taste, still perfect for ice cream sandwiches :)

These cookies turned out great. I used Crisco butter sticks and put extra M&Ms on the cookies before baking. I also used the medium OXO cookie scoop to portion them out. The recipe yielded 40 average size cookies. Perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Baked for 10 minutes. I will be making these again.

Loved them!  Followed the directions (cooked 10 minutes), doubled the batch, and they are still all gone!  My friends loved them, and I will definitely make them again.  This is exactly what I think of when I want an M&M cookie!

I read many of the reviews before deciding to make these cookies.  I used softened butter instead of shortening and also added 1 cup of M&M.  The density of the cookie was perfect but the bites that did not have an M&M in them were very bland.  I recommend adding more M&Ms.

This was just a great recipe.  Instead of shortening, I used butter all the way. I don't like using shortening ever! They came out perfect.  I used the standard size m&m's.  I also made a rather large cookie by scooping it with a ice cream scoop.  The cookie was great.  It cooked perfectly.  I highly recommend this recipe and will be trying it again.  Since this cookie will be used for the holidays, I froze the rest of the dough.

These cookies were everything I hoped for them to be. They were crispy on the outside and warm & chewy on the inside. I only made 15 cookies using the 72 servings, but I made them huge! I used Christmas M&M's and they turned out wonderfully!

I would actually give these 4.5 stars if I could :)  I used all butter in place of the shortening, added 1/4 cup more flour than called for and chilled dough in the refrigerator before baking.  Didn't have any problems with sticky dough or flat cookies like other reviewers who used butter.  Will make these again!

I saw that others had successfully used butter - it's all I had so I went for it. They ended up pretty spread out and flat. The next batch I added an extra half a cup of flour to compensate - perfect! One day I'll have shortening and make these right.

I made these cookies EXACTLY how the recipe is written and YUUUM! I usually never cook or bake with shortening, but sometimes it is just plain yummy. I didnt measure my M&Ms just eye balled it so there was plenty in each cookie. And also added 3 on top for presence! I made them about the size of a golf ball or larger, and they turned out big and fat and full, about the size of my palm. I love a big fat soft cookie. But doing it that way I only came out with 12 cookies, next time I will triple the recipe. JUST TASTED THESE, WONDERFUL! THINK I WILL ADD 1/2 CUP OF PEANUT BUTTER NEXT TIME

These were delicious! Everyone loved them. Used butter instead of shortening, as I couldn't find shortening here in Australia. Thanks Robbi!

This is the perfect recipe for this cookie.  I made just as the recipe stated except I dumped all the M&M's in the dough at once.  They turned out soft and delicious.  Chewy and pretty just the same. The dough is glorious before baking as well!

I love the puffiness of these cookies but think they lack M&M's. Next time I will definitely add more chocolate.

These turned out great. Used butter, not shortening as I didn't have any on hand. They took 9.5 minutes in my oven. Added xtra M&M's while they were cooling for presentation effect.

Love these! So does my husband. There aren't many sweets that he can't pass up, but he's a lost cause when these are in the house! Used butter flavored crisco as I find it make a nice, soft, but not flat cookie. Thanks!

I used unsalted butter in place of the shortening due to habit.  They were yummy!  My family couldn't stop eating them.  They didn't spread too much.  The dough before and after cooking is glorious.  Adding the candies after rolling is a perfect touch!

These are really good. My 8 year old son LOVES making these with me. He puts the m&m's on top, and we end up using way more than called for. I read all the reviews saying to use butter instead of shortning. I don't usually change the recipes, but I went ahead and made this with 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortning and they turned out great.

make sure to use dark rown sugar - light brown makes the result look pale and sickly. also, would recc'd a dash more m&ms. everyone that tried them, said they liked them but.. still.

I really thought these were very boring.  My kids and husband liked them, so I gave it 2 stars for them, but I probably will never be making these again.  Sad, because I really wanted them to be great.

So quick and easy.  It tasted way better the next day...nice and chewy.  One of my friends commented that it was the best cookie he's ever had.  My bf on the other hand, said he could taste the shortening...probably because he saw that I put shortening in it.  Nonetheless, a delicious cookie!

Very yummy! I only had butter-flavored shortening on hand, so that's what I used. They were fabulous! I made both milk and dark-chocolate cookies. I will definitely be adding this one to my list of favorite cookies!

Super easy to make - I felt like it was too easy to make. I also substituted half butter for the shortening (and used butter flavored shortening). They tasted like peanut butter cookies..but maybe it's the vanilla I used. I felt like something was missing, maybe needed more sugar. But, my guests commented that they were really good (before I even asked). I'll make again.

These were great! I made them with only 3/4 cup of M & M's and everyone told me it was the perfect amount. I also used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 margarine, but other than that I kept the recipe the same. They came out great, soft and chewy (my favorite!!), and they were all gone within the hour! I will definitely use this recipe again and again! LOVED THEM! :)

First of all I doubled this recipe. I omitted the salt. I used light brown sugar, the pourable bag kind and instead of shortening, I used half butter and half crisco vegetable oil. I scooped out large tablespoon size for each cookie. These cookies came out big, soft & chewy. This is absolutely the best cookie recipe there is. Better than bakery cookies. You could add m & m's, chocolate chips/chunks or whatever you like. My compliments to Robbi, for the perfect cookie! Thanks!

These are wonderful! The dough is the perfect consistency to scoop with a melon baller or small ice cream scoop making them so easy to make. Taste wonderful and turn out perfect everytime. Be sure to add the extra M&M's by hand before baking!

Mmm, these were great! I followed others' recommendations and used 2 sticks softened real butter, no shortening, and increased flour by 1/4 cup. I also added about 1 cup chocolate chips I'd had leftover in the pantry. I'd definitely do that again! I made these for a Boy Scout fundraiser, and before I added the M&Ms, I took out the blue and yellow ones, then measured the other colors to add to the recipe (I used 2 bags of "Tear & Share" size, 3.14oz each). I pressed 1 blue and 1 yellow on the top of each cookie for the boy scout colors. Recipe made exactly 72 cookies. You can taste the butter. Now I need to go package them so I'll have some for tonight's fundraiser! :-)

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and that is why I gave it only 4 stars -- It would have been yummier with a more "butter" flavor -- whether using a butter flavored shortening, or substituting butter for some of the shortening.  I really liked the soft, fluffiness of the cookies.  My 2 year old couldn't get enough (much to her dismay...)

The best choice for a midnight snack. My dad who isn't a big fan of cookies gobbled these up! Great texture. I would suggest adding way more M&Ms to each cookie. That way you really get that sweet chocolatey cookie. Fab!

No shortening on hand, so I used half butter and half margerine. No other changes were made. I'm chilling the dough right now, I'll update how the hubs liked them after I bake them. (This dough took only five minutes to make AND I used dark chocolate M&M's.) EDITED: Next time, I might use a different combo of fats. These baked up cake-like, which aren't our cup of tea.

I followed the directions exacty.  I took them out of the oven after 8 minutes and they were perfect.  I do somewhat agree with the other reviewers.  Next time I will use the butter flavored shortening, but not butter.  I just missed the flavor.  Either way... this recipe was a hit with my family.  I will use this as a staple M&M cookie recipe.

These are perfect.  I followed the recipe as written.  The butter flavored shortening sticks are great to use.  While real butter may be a substitute, generally shortening tends to give you a chewy middle and crisp edges which is the way I love them.  This is a great recipe and my children loved them!

Use butter flavored Crisco. Makes the BEST cookies - taste like butter, but doesn't spread out like butter.

Great cookies!  Despite everyone's recommendation to use 1/2 butter I used all shortening like the recipe calls for.  My only change was to add in some butter flavoring (just cuz I had it).  I mixed all the candy in instead of reserving some for the tops.  I had to bake mine for 13 minutes.

Awesome recipe!!! Cookies were full of flavor and soft. I did half shortening and half butter. Next time I would half the salt as they were a little salty for my taste.

The only change I made was using butter instead of shortening. I baked the cookies for 10 minutes and transferred them to a cooling rack immediately. They were delicious and slightly chewy. This recipe is very simple yet classic. Tip: People (especially kids) are attracted to blue and green M&Ms, so I made sure to press at least one green or blue candy into each cookie!

They were fun to make with the kids, and they really enjoyed eating them. I think I only ended up throwing away two that were left over. I for some reason got hot burn off of them, thinking because i used shortening. I will try again using butter though and hopefully I will enjoy them better.

This recipe is absoulutly the best cookie recipe that ever exsists. I make this for every occasion and people always rave with great reviews. One tipper is to use half butter and half shortening like other members have already said. It makes for a better cookie.

The recipe was very simple and easy but the cookies were a little dry I thought, even at 9 minutes. I tried only 8 minutes but they honestly weren't baked enough.

My 11 yr. old made these tonight. They are VERY good. She used hershey's dark kissables instead of M&M's and used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c shortening as others suggested- hince the 4 instead of 5 star rating. The cookies turned out big and fluffy not flat like the picture. She spooned the dough on with our soup spoon and did not flatten them, so maybe that made a difference. We like our cookies better big and fluffy anyway! ENJOY :)

Very decent cookies, turned out just right. I used butter instead of shortening and refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking, and they didn't flatten excessively. 4 stars though because the recipe didn't turn out 5-6 dozen for me, even though that's what the recipe says. I thought my cookies were a sensible size, maybe 2 3/4 inches - 3 inches across after baking, but I only got 3 dozen out of it, plus 2 for quality control (natch). If I'd known, I would've doubled the recipe, as I was planning to take them to work to share. I have very hungry coworkers.

My 10 year old made them and she wanted to use Mini M&Ms. Took the advice of others and used butter in the recipe too and they turned out amazing! I highly recommend using the Mini candies!  Will definitely be making these again.

Excellent, excellent cookies! I followed another users' suggestions to refrigerate the dough (personally only refrigerated for about 2 hours) and it really helped to make the cookies fluffy and not too spread out. Used real butter and it didn't make the cookies too flat. Pressing the extra m&m's on top is a must for making them look extra nice!

Very good, though the yield was about half of what the recipe indicated.  (A regular batch gave me about 3 dozen 2-in cookies.)  I used a mix of milk chocolate and white chocolate M&Ms, and they're terrific.

Decent cookies but, as written, nothing spectacular because it calls for the use of shortening only. Swap out the shortening and use butter instead (butter always makes for better cookies). Add more flour to prevent flattening and then you'll have a five star cookie.

Great! I had never made cookies from scratch before and they came out great. I have made 3 batches in the span of a week; they are addicting!  I did not change anything out, only added chocolate chips with the m&ms. Will be using this recipe for cookies from now on; no more store bought mixes for me.

Don't over mix. I used a stand mixer and even on the lowest setting, it mixed the butter mixture so well (as air gets into the mixture) that the cookies became more crunchy than chewy.  For chewy cookies,  fold the wet and dry ingredients together. Also, it works better if you mix dry ingredients together before incorporating wet and dry Mixtures. Shortening is less sinful, but if you're going to enjoy a cookie, go to town and use butter instead! The salt makes more sense bringing out the flavor in butter than Crisco. Overall, good recipe and I liked that it went easy on white sugar.

I made this recipe with my young sons this afternoon exactly as is; we used the shortening and no butter.  They are fantastic! They held their shape nicely, no spreading as you get with the butter. I made them on the smaller side, and will be adding them to school lunches this upcoming week.  I recommend making them with the shortening before trying with the butter; they are great.

One of the best tasting and looking cookies I have ever made, and I have been baking a long time. Took the advice of another reviewer and used half butter, half shortening and refrigerated the dough for a few minutes to keep the cookies from spreading too much. PERECTION

Great recipe! What I ended up doing was making them with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening and then putting it in the fridge overnight. The cookies turned out fat and round (not flat). I think it has to do with the butter being too warm.

These cookies were awesome... Mine were not flat at all! I used two sticks of butter instead of shortening... I put in a little too muchh vanilla and was nervous after i discovered the mistake but the cookies were still out of this world... My three girls loved them and so didn't my husband which was a plus... I will be making these again.

I love this recipe! I always use 1/2 c. Crisco and 1/2 c. Blue Bonnet margarine. Works perfectly! And my hubby and kids love them as sugar cookies without the m&m's. Shhhhh...dont tell anyone ;)

Made this several times already - I use 2 sticks of butter in place of shortening a whole bag of M&M's and a cup of mini morsels to make them more chocolate chippy.  LOVE THEM!

Delicious! And I'm picky,  I followed one person's advice and put the dough in the fridge for about 10 minutes before baking each batch. It was successful. They did not spread thin. Also, I used coconut oil as shortening. Coconut oil is wonderful for baking cookies.

Easy and delicious! Definitely added more m&m's than the recipe called for though. I had three sets of little hands helping. ;) I added the m&m's on top after the cookies baked for about 5 minutes to give them some time to spread and more surface area for the candy to be placed strategically. My 3 boys loved helping to make and EAT them!

YES YES YES!!  Perfect recipe.  And great to make in the stand-up mixer!!  I made them with my 4 year old daughter and she could help and do a lot.  I used shortening and parchment paper on cookie trays.  Love it!

Too salty..1/2 teaspoon should suffice. Also could have used more M&ms. otherwise good. I used butter flavored Crisco and didn't have a problem with spreading.

I used butter as I don't have shortening. The cookies came out great. I would half the salt as they were slightly salty as I used salted butter. They didn't come out as flat as others have made it sound. I also put my batter in the freezer for 5 minutes to solidify the butter back as another reviewer suggested. This is a keeper.

I have been making cookies for years.  I love trying new recipes.  But this one is by far my least favorite I've ever made.  All it is flour, sugar and saturated fat.

Hesitate to eat shortening, but I figure we don't eat cookies all the tie so it's okay every once Ina while. I find theshorteninggive the cookies a creamy texture not achieved by butter. And they really are amazing. The best cookies I have made in a while!

I made these for Valentine's Day and brought them to work.  They were gone by lunchtime so I would say they are good.  I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening.  I misread the recipe and added all the M & Ms in with the batter instead of putting them on top.  No worry since they still tasted great.  Definitely a recipe I will make again!

I made them and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla (because I loove using vanilla in my baking). I used 2 cups of M&M's and they were perfect. It made 4 dozen perfectly, no smaller cookies or scraping the bowl (though I do anyway :).

These cookies are very good! We love them and have made them twice now. I use real butter instead of shortening and "dark" brown sugar. This recipe works wonderful for large cookies. Watch them and take them out when they just barely look done. Yumm.

I made these cookies a couple days ago and they are almost gone. I used bitter instead of shortening, peanut m&m's(this was a request) instead of regular m&m's and ideal no calorie sweetener for brown sugar. Very good :)

Very delicious, especially when they are still warm from the oven.  My cookies don't exactly resemble the ones in the photo, but then again, they rarely do!  The important thing is that they pass the taste test, and they do. :-) The recipe was easy to follow and the results were fantastic.  Will definitely be making these again.

Great, classic recipe!  For those who said the shortening was bad, try using Butter-flavored Crisco.  You get a nice, easy to work with dough that still has butter flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent.  I only had peanut M&Ms and didn't have enough so I chopped them coarsely (that's a pain) and then added in a 1/4 cup or so of chocolate chips to make up the difference.  Also used butter flavored crisco. They were great!

These are great.  I used butter flavored Crisco and also refrigerated the dough for about 10 minutes before putting them in the oven, and I kept the dough in the refrigerator in between batches.   I used one of those cookie scoops so they were all the same size, they did not run at all, and were perfectly round.  I baked for 11 minutes.  These are a keeper, can't wait to have them around Christmas time too !

These are going down as the best cookies I have ever had!! Every other cookie recipe I've tried since this first batch can't even come close to being this great! Make this recipe, especially if you like chewy cookies! I do find they have a unique salty/sweet taste for some reason. Very addicting! Thanks for the rockin' recipe!

Yum!!!!! These were amazing cookies! I used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening, like some others have said, and I don't really notice a difference.
I also used mini mm instead of regular because you could fit more on a cookie.

Love this recipe!  I used the recipe as written (didn't use butter), and my cookies turned out craggy and chewy -- exactly what I wanted.  I don't have the patience to place individual M&M's on each cookie so I just threw them all in during mixing (and my KitchenAid did mash the M&Ms up a bit -- but I didn't have a problem with it).  IMO, These DO NOT taste like store bought cookies (much MUCH better!).

These are delicious!  They taste just like the ones you get at the mall.  I did 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter b/c that's what I had and they were great.

Cut shortening out & replaced with an equal amount of applesauce. Baked for 10 minutes for a slightly soft inside.

I LOVE baking and these came out fabulous!!! I know butter is preferred over shortening however I have always found cookies hold up better with shortening. I followed recipe and threw in some chocolate chip chunks in mine along with the m&m's and rolled the dough in balls and put on cookie sheets and they were thick, and perfectly round...and taste so good!!

These were wonderful! Good enough to give away for Christmas goodies! I did end up using 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening and they did spread out, but not too bad. I made sure to put the dough in the refrigerator during each batch so that the butter didn't get too warm and this seemed to help with the spreading. Since I only had salted butter I eliminated the salt and they were delicious!!

These cookies were great! I made them twice and they last a long time. I shipped some to my husband who is currently deployed and they lasted 2 1/2 weeks in a box! But of course they taste perfect right out of the oven. I made them a second time and I forgot to put the butter in and I took them to a Christmas party. Surprisingly, everybody loved them so next time I might only use half the butter recommended. I also used Recesses peanut butter chips instead of M & M's and they were wonderful!

I read a number of reviews that complained of flat cookies.  I didn't have time to deal with potentially flat cookies so I made the recipe exactly as written then added 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  They were perfect!!  The cookies had the exact amount of puff that I was looking for.  I'm 7 years old again when I make these cookies.  :)

Made these in hopes that they would be as beautiful as the cookie shown on the recipe.....Ya, not so much at all  :(  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe calls, the cookies spread and were flat and greasy :(  I am sad.....I used red and green M&Ms for my Christmas cookie tray....I do not think I will be putting these ones out :(  Maybe Santa will feed them to his reindeer?

After reading all the reviews, just out of curiosity, I decided to make the recipe exactly how it is written. They turned out to be spot on AMAZING. Best M&M cookies I have ever had, store bought or otherwise. They did not run at all, if anything I had the opposite problem, I had to pat them down to make them look more like cookies and less like little mounds. Why would you want to substitute butter for the shortening anyway?? Crisco has 50% less saturated fat than butter! These cookies are not salty at all either. Perfection, baked for 9 minutes for a soft center. :-) A+++ 5 stars.

As did other reviewers, I also used butter instead of shortening.  I think all cookies are better with butter.  I followed the recipe to a T beyond that.  I recommend keeping the cookies small because they spread out too much and look not so pretty if you make them big.  Of course, this might happen less if you use shortening or if you chill the dough first.

Great M&M cookie recipe! I used mini m&ms instead of large ones for better chocolate distribution. I also used half butter, half butter-flavored shortening, instead of all shortening. I added a bit more vanilla extract as well. Delicious cookie dough and very tasty cookies. Soft, fluffy, and a little crunchy on the edges. Will make again!

I just made these, and was eating some as I came on here to review a few recipies I recently tried. They are pretty good, they turned out to look nice, didn't spread too much, and have a good taste. I used butter in place of shortening, like a lot of other reviewes did, but other then that I didn't change a thing. They have good flavor, but I wouldn't say it's a "knock your socks off" kind of cookie. Next time I will use a little cream of tartar to get the cracking on top that looks so nice with cookies. Like I said, they were pretty good, but there's just something I can't quite put my finger on... they just didn't do it for me.

By far one of my new favorite cookies.  Easy and quick.  I cooked the cookies in a convection microwave oven and they were crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  Its going in my book.

I had never used shortening for choc. chip cookies. I decided to give this one a try.  I always try to use less fat and sugar in cookies.  So, I used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar(instead of 1 cup), 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup shortening.  Oh, and 2 cups whole white wheat flour(instead 2 1/2 cup AP flour). And choc chips  instead of M&M's(didn't have any).  With all my changes they came out great!  I was able to make just over 3 dozen cookies.  Baked for 10 minutes at 350.  I love using white whole wheat flour! No one can tell they just ate a whole wheat cookie! :)

These cookies are great and a perfect way to use bulk bags of M&Ms.  My husband and daughter loved them.  Made according to the recipe except dropped by tablespoons rather than teaspoons which yielded 3 dozen cookies.  We all like bigger cookies.  Cook time was 10-12 minutes for soft cookies depending on pan used.
***Update: These cookies stay moist in air tight container for about 3 days.  After that they get a little dry so share with others if you don't want that to happen.

Meh. They were ok. I used all shortening, should have used half butter. I did sub half the vanilla for butter flavor. They spread a lot! And the recipe yield says 72. What did they use to get 72 cookies? They would be tiny! I used a 1 1/2 tbsp cookie scoop and the yield was exactly 36. If I ever make these again I will definitely use butter.

Disappointing . . . I followed the recipe to the letter but used the peanut butter M&Ms. There is just something missing in the cookie portion. After baking two cookie sheets, I'm thinking about throwing out the dough.

I remembered having cookies like this as a child and was THRILLED to run across this recipe on this website.  As mentioned by other reviewers, I also substituted 1 cup of butter for the shortening.  And, feeling as if 3/4 cup of M&Ms couldn't possibly be enough, I made it a full cup (note:  added the M&Ms to the batter after it was THOROUGHLY MIXED so I just had to blend it a few seconds in the Kitchen Aid mixer-- not too many M&Ms were crushed--like 2 or 3).  Then I gently pushed in several (4 or more) M&Ms into the cookies before baking them for 9 minutes.  They turned out great.  Made them for a 4th of July cookout (then realized I should have picked out and used only red and blue M&Ms to be more festive for Independence Day).  I will DEFINITELY make these delightful treats again and again and again!  Thanks to Robbi for sharing a great recipe!

I used 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter. While it makes a nice looking cookie that doesn't spread or flatten much, it still has that bakery shortening flavor. If you're the kind of person who loves bakery cookies, then you'll be fine w/the shortening. Otherwise, the cookie was much like a choc chip cookie dough.

Great recipe! Based on other reviews, I made the following changes: used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 margarine and added additional chocolate chips. Next time will add more vanilla extract, but otherwise a perfect recipe!!

i found the dough to be a pain. I used shortening (butter flavored)and added everything as stated in the directions. I made a half batch. I don't need to bother telling anyone that the amount is off. The dough was like play doh but it wouldn't hold the m&m's I litterally kept having to squish them in and kept shoving them back on. I used mini m&m's so you'd think that would be easier to stay in the dough. Also the cookies don't have too much flavor(i think this is where the butter or margerine would be better) and the dough didn't spread at all. so i have small chubby cookies.

Wow. With 4 1/2 stars I expected these to be halfway decent but was majorly disappointed.  Followed the recipe except used butter instead of shortening. Cookies ended up flat and had very little flavor (most of the flavor they had came from the m&m's).  Only cooked half of the batter. Put the rest in freezer rolled into a log. Gonna try slicing and baking them to see if that helps them at least not be flat.

I just made these cookies today and they looked great on the cookie sheet, but couldn't get them off the sheet!  If I tried to get them off right away, they squished up, and if I tried to leave them on the sheet for a few minutes first, they were so hard to get off they crumbled and broke apart!

I don't know... some wanted flavors are a little lacking when following recipe exactly.  Maybe I'd try using butter instead of shortening next time.  This recipe is good but I think it could be better.

Great, delicious cookies. I cringe at using shortening in my recipes. But was afraid butter would make my cookies flat & unappealing, so I did what many other users suggested and did half-butter and half-shortening. Additionally, I refridgerated the cookies overnight because in many cases if the dough is cold when it hits the oven, it less likely to spread out really thin and won't be as flat. So, it helped my probability of flat cookies. See my pictures.

I made these cookies with margarine because I never use shortening, and I had no problem. I did add another half cup of flour though because the batter seemed a little runny. They came out perfect! They spread just right (not too much) and looked wonderful. The only downer is that they don't have much taste. The cookie itself is a little bland.

My go-to recipe for M&M cookies.  It is such an easy recipe.  I use butter flavored shortening for added flavor and make the cookies jumbo-sized.  I also make the dough ahead and keep it chilled before baking.  These are always a big hit!

I would not have added as much salt as this recipe called for, but with all the reviews, I decided to keep the recipe as written. These were a HUGE hit. I thought they were too salty, but no one else noticed. Apparently the sweet/salty thing works.

Exactly what I was hoping for.  We love M & M cookies from the bakery but they do not have the quality taste that these cookies do.  Super easy and very flavorful.  No doughy flavor!  Everyone loved these cookies.

I thought these turned out great! I read through all the reviews and made a few changes. I used 2 sticks softened butter rather than shortening. I also added 1/4 cup peanut butter (would have added a bit more, but ran out!) and 3/4 cup quick cooking oats. I think the oats helped keep the cookies from flattening like others have said has happened.  My oven is a bit weird, so I did bake them at 355 degrees for about 11 minutes. I only ended up with 3 dozen, but that is plenty for us.

I made these exactly like the recipe with butter crisco.  They turned out perfect!  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

Yummo!  This was a really good cookie and mine didn't flatten out they stayed high.  Tastes like the local bakery.  I will definitely be making these again.  I also added mini m&m's for more fun.

Cookies came out fine.  We followed the recipe exactly.  The only disappointment was that we ended up with 45 cookies (not 72).  Our cookies were 2-1/2 inches in diameter after they baked.  I guess they would be about 1-1/2 inches in diameter in order to get 72.

These cookies tasted great! I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar splenda -- they were moist, delicious and even though I haven't eaten sweets for a year or so, I made an exception for these cookies. Also, I used shortening. Delicious!

These wern't TERRIBLE, but wasn't the taste I was expecting. There was really NO taste besides the m&m's. Wish I would have used butter instead of the shortening.

We made about 6 dozen cookies (meant for a charity event), following this recipe to a T. What resulted were rock-hard, tasteless cookies. If it weren't for the M&M's, the cookies themselves taste like overcooked hard biscuits.

I made these using half Crisco & half butter. They looked great and tasted pretty good. Not like out of this world but pretty good. Next time I might try with all butter and peanut butter m&m's.

The cookies were sensational!  The only thing I did differently is that I swapped the cup of shortening out for a cup of real butter.  In addition, I had 2 tsp of imitation vanilla extract (which is weaker than pure vanilla extract, thus why the extra 1/2 tsp).  Buttery cookies that melt in your mouth!  This recipe is definitely a keeper! :)

ABSOLUTELY loved these cookies. I took them to work and everyone loved them.  They couldn't believe I made them.  Only change I made was I didn't use shortening. I used 2 sticks of salted butter.

I doubled this recipe because am sending some to school tomorrow with my daughter and wanted to have some for us to keep at home.  I made big cookies, about 3.5 inch round (about a heaping tablespoon).  This made a little over 5 dozen.  I also added a few mini choc chips. They turned out really well, however are a little flat.  I did use 1/2 butter flavored shortening and 1/2 unsalted butter, so maybe that is why, but they are still delicious.

This is a great recipe! I used butter flavored shortening and added about one more teaspoon of vanilla and about 1/4 cup more of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar and about 1/4 tsp more salt.  They are really yummy!!!!!!!!

These were very good and reminded me of what my mother used to make for us as kids.  I also used butter instead of shortening and when I make them again I will increase the flour a little, I will make them again.

This is a great recipe! The taste was not too sweet or bland. I ate three of them in 5 minutes after baking them.  I didn't have enough m&m's so I ended up having to make some random variations such as adding chocolate chips or putting a hersheys kiss in the middle of a couple cookies. I loved the recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

My husband and kids (and me!) went crazy over these cookies.  I didn't have any shortening, so used butter.  I also used 1 1/2 cups plain and peanut butter M&Ms plus chocolate chips, then topped each cookie with 3 more M&Ms.  They looked and tasted fantastic, didn't spread too much at all, and stayed soft.  The perfect baking time for me was 8.5 minutes.  Can't wait to make them again!  Thanks!

Used 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and they came out DELICIOUS! I made them nice and big (8 per sheet) and used 1 cup of semi sweet and a bag of peanut butter m&ms (my favorite). Will definitely be making again!

Good recipe!  Simple to make.  We used butter flavored shortening as some commented that butter would taste better than the shortening.  We used more M&Ms than called for as well.

Tasty cookies! I just changed one thing. I used half shortening and half butter. Turned out beautifully. I will defiantly make these again.

Recipe "as is" was an absolute hit. In my oven (as all ovens aren't created equally) took closer to 12-13 minutes to cook. I too, substituted butter for the shortening and taste no difference. Made them yesterday and not a cookie left in the house. Only thing I question is the "Servings". I followed the instructions to a "T" yet, there is no way I could could come out with 72 cookies. I was closer to 35-40. Aside from that, will be saving this and making it again. Well Done !!

PERFECT!!! Wonderful recipe and thank you for sharing. I used 1/2 c butter crisco and 1/2 c butter because I'm a butter freak. Otherwise followed the recipe and they turned out beautiful and delicious.

Delicious, fairly soft cookie!  The only thing I tweaked was using 1/2 cup shortening & 1/2 butter instead of all shortening for our taste.  I also listening to a former review which said to add an additional 1/4 cup of flour to the batch.  This is the only step I wouldn't repeat next time I make this cookie.  They made the cookie a drop dry and puffy.  Other than that one step, the cookies had great flavor, easy to make and the kids enjoyed helping me.  Enjoy this yummy cookie!

People really liked these.  I put them in for 9 minutes and they were bigger than a teaspoon, so they were kinda doughy and dense.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 3/8 cup coconut oil so that they could be organic, and I think they were good.

Awesome. I used Reeses Pieces instead of M & M s and also used 2 sticks of butter instead of the shortening. I baked at 8 minutes and they came out great.

My kids and I made these yesterday and they are SO good!  We did 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup real unsalted butter.  We didn't get 72 cookies though, probably more like 40.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I made exactly as written... which worried me because I can't remember the last time I used shortening in cookies!!  These were perfect... and pressing candies into the top before baking fixed that little problem of "sunken" m & m's... the colors were more vibrant... just beautiful and tasty.  Loved 'em!

I mixed up this batch of cookies yesterday morning when I got off work, put in fridge, and baked when I got up last night.  I made exactly as written, other then mixing all 1 1/2 cups of M&Ms into the cookie batter.  Baked for 10 minutes on Parchment paper, let sit on cooking sheets for 2 more minutes, then moved to cooling racks.  I used a 1 tbsp cookie scoop, so only got 46 cookies.  I did use the Christmas Holiday M&Ms, and these came out very nice and festive looking.  Will make a nice addition to my holiday platters, and will be making these year after year.

Easy, great tasting recipe. I made these the other day when someone gave me a big bag of M&M's. Cookies came out perfect, but I did bake them about 12-14 minutes, and I only ended up with a few more than 3 dozen cookies. I did use rounded teaspoons too. Not complaining though because they looked good and tasted great. They didn't last long in my house either.  I will post a picture as well. These will be going on my cookie platter at Christmas time.

I love soft chewy cookies and these are not that! As many other people have said, I should have used butter. These came out so dry, not moist at all. Next time I will use butter. i am serving these cookies at a party tonight and am think about making a whole other batch because I don't want to give them to anyone else to try.

Even after adding more flour and a pinch of baking powder along with the other dry ingredients, these cookies still fell flat. They sure are yummy, but you'll have to scrape them off the plate to eat them because of their flatness.

I have made several M&M recipies and the candies have often bled or sank to the bottom. I did use butter flavored Crisco. These kept a great shape, looked fabulous, and attracted a lot of attention at our fundraiser bake sale. Yes they tasted great too!

Very good and fun for the kids to help with. They weren't overly sweet which I liked. I used butter instead of shortening and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Turned out perfectly.

The only thing I changed was to use 2 sticks of butter and omit the shortening.  These were a huge hit at my son's kindergarten party. I got so much positive feedback! You'd think these people never saw M&M cookies before!! But the texture was perfect. Placing a few M&Ms on top of each cookie and pressing in slightly before baking made a big difference in the appearance. I forgot to do that for the last few cookies and they did not look nearly as pretty as the rest. I just dropped the cookies on the sheet otherwise though, I did not roll them or shape them in any way.  Great recipe, will definitely make these again!

Upon reviews, I added 3 cups of flour. I hand mixed the m&m's in dough except blue and red. The blue and red m&m's I put on the top before baking to decorate for July 4th! On the first cookie sheet it spread realllllllly thin, thinner than a pancake so that was a loss. Next I added another 1/2 cup of flour.

I made these cookies to bring to the lake with my boyfriend's family, and I should have made more! They were gone in one day. I was a little hesitant about using shortening, because I much prefer the taste of butter in cookies, but I hate how they always turn out flat when I use butter. I ended up using butter flavored shortening. It turned out pretty well, but I think I'll try using half butter and half shortening next time, as others have suggested. I also used more m&m's than the recipe calls for, but I love lots of chocolate in my cookies. In my opinion, they seemed as if they could be a little sweeter, but everyone else seemed to think they were just right. I'll be making these again!

This cookie is sickeningly sweet!! Kids would probably like it, but I don't care for it and I have a sweet tooth. The recipe should definitely have a little less butter and sugar ratio to the flour because the dough turns out pasty. The cookie bakes up soft which is nice, but the cookie needs less fat and sugar. Also the recipe should use butter rather than shortening.  Shortening will give it a flat taste.

Some other reviewers used butter in place of shortening but I didn't have enough butter so I used the shortening.  I used a cookie scoop to make the cookies so I think that's why they didn't spread too much.  I like the crunchy and chewy texture.  Next time I will use my chocolate chip cookie recipe and replace the chips with M&M's.

These were great, just what I was looking for in an M&M cookie.  I used half butter and half margarine, and they came out a little flat, but still chewy and tasty.

These are pretty gross. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because my 4 and 1 year-olds will eat them. I'm baking the last batch now only because I want to use the m&m's in the batter. What a waste of yummy candy.

I made these for christmas to give out in candy baskets. I had never made M&M cookies before. These were so wonderful. I had to keep subtracting from each persons basket because I couldn't quit eating them. These are so simple and so moist and tasty. I baked mine until they were still kind of soft them let them harden on the cooling rack. They never got hard, just a little firmer but were perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious.  I baked them for about 13 minutes because they didn't look done after 11.  They were crispy on the outside but soft and chewy in the middle.  Next time I think I'll make them a little bigger than teaspoon size balls because I found there were a lot of M&Ms in such a small, bite size cookie.  They were still great nonetheless.

I used 2 sticks of salted butter in place of the shortening, 2 teaspoons of Vanilla (rather than 1 1/2), 2 1/4 cup of flour rather than 2 1/2 cup and added about 1 cup of the M&M's to the mix rather than the 3/4 cup asked for.  They turned out perfectly.  It only made about 2 1/2 dozen cookies for me.  I baked them at 375 degrees instead of 350 degrees.  They were delicious and took exactly 10 minutes in my oven.  The recipe changes I made above were from the recipe M&M
s has posted on their website for their M&M's Party Cookies.

I followed this recipe exactly except I substituted 2 sticks of butter for the shortening and they came out flat as silver dollars and very crispy. I baked them for the time stated on air-bake cookie sheets. No one would eat them. I was looking for a thick, soft, chewy cookie and this wasn't it.

ok what am I doing wrong? I followed the recipe and my cookies were flat, then I tried the butter instead of the shortening like others suggested and they were still flat. Any suggestions? the taste was ok but they weren't at all like the ones from the bakery that I go to. I guess I will just have to keep looking.

These were very easy and tasted GREAT!  I think the key is probably using dark brown sugar instead of light. It gives them a little sweeter taste.

These are GREAT! I've made these cookies twice, and they've turned out perfect each time. I used shortening (although maybe I'll try butter next time to see what happens). I love that its a simple recipe - great to do with kids! Its one of the few recipes I can get through with my 1 and 3 year olds helping... This is going in my all-time fave recipes!

I've made this recipe twice - one with shortening and the other with butter.  I prefer the batch made with butter.  The cookie batter also could have used a little more sugar as it was kind of bland.  Tasted great when you bite into a chocolate piece though.  I think I'll continue my search for a better recipe than this one.

This recipe is very tasty!!! My family loved it. My 4 year old daughter said they where the best I ever made!I used butter instead of shortening. I also used up old Halloween candy to make these and ran out of M&Ms! So I put the M&Ms in the cookie dough and used Kissables to put on top of the cookies!! Turned out great!!!

It was great! I used butter instead of the shortening. My boyfriend and I wanted a quick late night snack, and since I found a new tick to cook. I decided to bake some cookies. Easy to make and with a great taste. I had to use baking powder instead of soda. I just added a little extra.

Turned out perfect. Only thing I did different was use mini M&Ms because I had them left over from the chocolate spiders. Soft and crunchy at the same time, like the others said. *Update* Today I accidentally used butter instead of Crisco, you get so used to butter with cookies you know. The cookies did not come out looking as nice but they were even better than the original recipe, which was very good too. So if you want a messier looking cookie that is gooey and chocolaty, use butter. If you want them to look nicer use shortening.

I've made these a number of times now and they are always a hit! I use half butter and half regular shortening and think this provides for a perfect texture. They are a pretty cookie on an assorted plate, with the colorful candies peeking out. Would be fun with any of the holiday/seasonal colored candies, too.

Pretty tasty.  Like other lard-based cookie recipes, they taste kind of icky when they're still warm, but when they're completely cooled they're nice and moist.

These were very simple to make.  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening for a better flavor.  I forgot to add a little extra flour as one of the previous reviews said but next time I definitely will.  They were a hit and I will make them again soon.

Loved these cookies. I have been trying different recipies for M&M's and this one was perfect. I took the suggestions from others and used half butter and half shortening.  I also used a little more flour.  Perfect with milk!

Well I did the 2 sticks of butter and extra half cup of flour and they were so flat and bland. The kids ate them but we didn't, so the next time I did the same but added vanilla pudding mix and it's exactly what we were looking for. FLAVOR:)

YummY!!  Used butter instead of shortening, otherwise stayed true to recipe.  Used 1/4 cup 'spoonfuls' for nice big chewy cookies!

Quick and easy, this recipe satisfied my craving for cookies. I used the miniature candy coated Hershey's kiss candies, as well as butter instead of shortening. I had to utilize what I had on hand. I scaled the recipe down to make 18 cookies and ended up adding an extra tablespoon of flour. I made little mini cookies and they were perfect! They did not taste store bought, nor did they fall flat.

I took the advice of others and used 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco in place of the 1 cup shortening. These were awesome. Will make again.

This was such an easy recipe.  I used a full cup of m&ms in the dough, then topped off with 3 or 4 more.  They turned out really rich!  I only got 48 cookies out of my dough, and they weren't very big, so I can't imagine making 72 tiny cookies.  I will definitely be making them again!

These cookies were great and my boys loved them and loved making them with me.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  Great chewy cookie with slightly crispy edge.  We also used a mix of milk and dark chocolate m & ms.

Great recipe!  They have a crunch on the outside yet are soft in the middle.  I used  1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening.  We used dark chocolate M&M's...YUM!

These cookies were great! I halved the recipe and used butter-flavored shortening. I also added in red and green M&Ms as well as some chopped walnuts. I put parchment paper on the cookie sheets before baking, so I had to leave them in the oven for a few extra minutes. They turned out with perfectly golden edges and a soft center. These were better than the M&M cookies I made over the holidays and will definitely be included in my Christmas cookie reportoire for next year!

The salt was ridiculous in this recipe and I had to do major damage control to salvage the cookies by adding more sugar to the recipe. I would advise halving the salt to 1/2 tsp, maybe even less. After damage control, they were better, but still far from great...

These were PERFECT. We made them as the birthday treat for my son's Kindergarten class. I made them a little large (a little bigger than a walnut probably) and put them on a popsicle stick. They took 10-11 minutes to bake and were beautiful with holiday m&ms. Super easy, pretty and YUMMY!

Eh.  Followed the recipe and ended up with a thick, dry, crumbly dough.  Had kind of a weird bouncy texture when they were done.

Great Cookies! I had to use self-rising flour because I was out of all-purpose, but they still turned out really well.  In fact, I might use the same type of flour next time. It made a nice chunky cookie.

I was just complimented on the good cookie by my son!  Three notes:  I used butter only and they are still good.  Second:  I doubled the recipe and made only 45 cookies about 1/3rd the size of what is pictured. And last: The dough is very thick and it is very difficult to stir in the candies.  Thanks so much for the super recipe!!

These cookies were great!!! My cookies never turn out right, and these were darn near perfect. I used blue bonnet butter and only 1/2 tsp of salt. I didn't think they were too sweet at all. For the second batch I added less candy to the batter and pressed in more just b/c they looked better. I wavered on the 4 or 5 stars. My only thing was they were a little more cake like than I like, but even that was probably more my fault, after all, I did alter the recipe.

I just made these cookies for my best friends little 6 year old boy. (Mommy just brought home a new baby) They came out absolutely awesome! I used peanut butter M&M's because that is what I had on hand but I am sure they would be just as good with the regular M&M's! Thanks for the great recipe!

Way too sweet, I tried sub. the shortening with butter, but still had something that lingered on the palette. Greatly prefer the chewy peanut butter chocolate chip cookies here on allrecipes.com, think i'll try that recipe and just add the m&m's. thanks though.

Excellent cookies!
I baked these with my soon to be teen daughter and not only were they quick and easy to make, they taste terrific.  We used the crisco baking sticks, made for an easy and clean measure for the shortning. :)
Nice and firm on the outside and soft and tender on the inside.  We liked these better than the normal chocolate chip recipe we make.  VERY GOOD!!!!

Very good. I used butter flavor shortening, and the kids ate them up! Very popular with the neighbor kids as well,especially if I use holiday colored M&M's.

These cookies were really good. Baking cookies is usually not one of my strong areas of baking but these turned out beautiful and very tasty. I did add a huge spoonful of peanut butter to the recipe, some chocolate chips to the batter, and a little cocoa. Can never get to much chocolate. I also make really big cookies instead of small ones. Cooked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought these would be great to share with neighbors and friends for the holidays.  I made them in advance with the mint M&Ms and then kept them in the freezer for a few weeks.  When I got them out, my family devoured them before I could get them delivered to the neighbors. 

They turned out a bit on the crisp side due to the shortenting, but dunking them in milk took care of that issue.  I will make them again and try the butter/shortening mix mentioned in other reviews.

This was just the recipe I was searching for!  These were super easy and the kids absolutely loved them.  I only used 1/2 cup shortening and added 1/2 cup salted butter, and cut down on the amount of salt.  They turned out great -- and I'm sure I'll be making again and again and again!

This was one of the best cookie recipes I have made. The only changes I made were that I used one stick of sweet cream butter and 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I also lowered the salt to 1/2tsp. since I used  peanut butter. I dug through our leftover Halloween candy and used a mix of regular and mini M & M's. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and added some peanut butter and oats.  I also used butter, one stick unsalted.  The cookies came out very good, so although I haven't tried the original version, I don't think I will!  The only thing I will change next time is less salt or use both sticks unsalted. The cookies were just a little salty.

Loved the recipe. Was skeptical when I pulled them out bcuz they appear cake like. After letting them set and cool for 2-3 minutes I remove them from the pan to a cooling rack. They cool for about 10 to 15 minutes then it’s like they should be. Amazingly good. I would make them again. I followed the recipe except for I did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup vegetable shortening for my fats. Everything else is exact. Delicious!

What a great discovery.  The recipe calls for shortening, but we halved it and added butter in its place.  Then we chilled the dough for 2 hours and I used a medium cookie scoop to create even balls of dough, which we flattened with the bottom of a glass, then placed m&m minis atop.  It’s a BIG HIT!

Great recipe! I added a half a cup more flour and 1/4 teaspoon more vanilla! Turned out great! (Only added more flour as I like a thicker cookie, and added the vanilla to offset it!

Made as prepared, but took a fork and flattened the scoops of cookie dough before putting m&ms on top. I wasn't impressed when they came out of the oven but these are really good cookies. I've been looking for a thin chocolate chip cookie recipe for a while now and I'm glad to finally have found a dough recipe that would fit the bill. Next batch will have chocolate chips and pecans instead of m&ms!

4 stars because my first batch came out like cookie chunks, were raw in the middle, and didn't flatten at all... My second batch I flattened with a fork before putting them in the oven, and they came out with better shape and cooked all the way through.

I think if I use this recipe again, I'm going to use a tablespoon scoop and just go ahead and flatten them firsthand. Hopefully then they'll come out alright.

These remind me of Mrs Fields from when I was a kid. I chose this recipe because I was low on butter and used shortening. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups of white sugar because I was low on brown. I also just pressed 3 m&ms in at the end instead of mixing and they were awesome! Fairly adaptable recipe and these were a holiday hit.

My teenager was very excited when he saw me making these, however he said they were just ok.    The base cookie recipe is definitely lacking.  I felt like I wasted time and effort making these cookies.

I thought these came out great. I might try butter-flavored shortening next time, but I do appreciate the less caramelized taste that the shortening provides, especially how they finish with a slightly paler appearance than a traditional chocolate chip. I refrigerated the dough for 5 minutes, as suggested by the top comment, and then I rolled the dough into balls before adding 8 candies to the top of each and placing them on the cookie sheet. I made 24 cookies and they took approximately 13-14 minutes to cook with both trays coking at the same time, rotating rack and spinning the sheets halfway through. I was worried they would burn cooking them for that long, but the shortening mustn’t brown as easily as straight butter, so they turned out perfectly golden brown and delicious. I let them cool on the cookie sheet for 3-4 minutes before transitioning them to a cooling rack.

We rate this a 5 star because it had a nice texture. The M&Ms melted in your mouth. We had to cook it a little longer than it says.

Great and easy, but not an all-time favorite.  I used butter instead of shortening because I love the flavor. I refrigerated the dough for at least a half hour before forming the cookies and between batches. This makes them a bit thicker and soft (vs thin and crispy).

This is an easy recipe. Instead of traditional M&Ms, I used seasonal “Pecan Pie” M&Ms.  I found I had to cook them about 13 minutes to get them like I like them.  Yummy!

Delicious!! I used mini m&m's so I added a few extra to the mixture. I did not add any extra on top like the recipe suggested. They spread a little but not a lot. I baked them a little extra. Everyone in my house loves them!!

Whoa. After eating one of these fresh from the oven I'm unsure if I need to fast for the rest of the day or immediately eat another one. I normally use butter in my cookies, but I opted to follow the recipe and use the shortening (butter flavored). I'm not sure what difference that made, but I was very pleased with how the dough did not stick to the M&Ms or my hands. I was able to make this batch of cookies happen while holding my sad and teething 1-year-old on my hip. So easy! The end result is chewy and very rich. The M&Ms still look very pretty after baking. The only change I made was to replace 1/2 cup of the candies in the dough with chocolate chips.

I used the same recipe but used white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts, instead of M&Ms. They're really good. 

I see a lot of people using butter of half butter and half shortening. I have made this recipe three times. The 2 times I used all shortening my cookies turned out MUCH better and prettier. When I tried using all butter, the dough was much too sticky and hard to deal with.

I want to love these, but for some reason they keep turning out “cakey”. The only thing I’ve changed is that I use 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. What am I doing wrong? Help!

I used 1/2 butter flavored crisco and 1/2 butter. Chilled dough about 45 minutes. Texture was perfect. Next time I wouldn’t use the butter flavored crisco. I thought it gave cookies an odd taste. No one complained and I will keep this recipe for patriotic cookies!

We ate the “best” ones right away so the picture does not do justice for how amazing these cookies are. I used half the recipe, 1 heaping teaspoon of batter on parchment paper, and got a lot of cookies. Used butter-slightly melted, sifted the dry ingredients separately and used parchment paper. SO GOOD!

These cookies were messed up. The batter was delicious. But the cookies were sticking to each other and spread out across the pan, making HUGE cookies. It also gave me and my dad stomach aches when we ate them. I will not make these again.

a good recipe... cookies came out with a nice texture due to the tip of keeping the dough in the refrigerator between baking the batches BUT a little bit too rich??

Very good. I followed the recipe exactly with ingredients, but once mixed, I rolled into balls (4 tbsp each) and put in the freezer for about 10-15 min. I then baked 10-11 min. Perfect softness/crispness.

I did not care for these , the flavor was bland.  I used all butter instead of shortening  and they looked nice.  I did chill them in the fridge for 5-10 min.

I thought these were a tad too salty, but everyone else loved them, so 5 stars it is!  Like others, I used unsalted butter, and they did spread out a lot, even after refrigerating the dough for an hour.  It was only an aesthetic issue, though, and it doesn't affect my rating since the recipe called for shortening instead.

I made this recipe with two changes:  I reduced the salt to only 1/2 tsp and I only used 3/4 cups of m&ms as thats all I had, so I didn’t push any extra in.  The cookies turned out well and tasted ok.  I think using either butter flavor shortening or substituting 1 stick of unsalted  butter for half of the shortening would have elevated the flavor to make these great tasting cookies.  The husband and kids like them so that is all that really matters.  ??

Wow. These are almost tasteless. I've been baking for years, followed to a tee, and used real butter for shortening. NOT sweet, just BLAH! Very disappointed.

This recipe is horrible. Followed it and it came out like  during the mixing process, just a pile of sugary flour.

In order to make this  recipe work you have to use 1 and a half cups of shortening or butter.

Sooooo good. Let it chill in the fridge for a couple hours before baking. Lined the pans with parchment paper. I also used pumpkin pie flavored M&Ms for Thanksgiving and they complimented the cookies amazingly. Baking time took a little longer than stated and I let them sit a little while on the pans to crisp up the bottom. Texture came out perfect. Will definitely be using this recipe again with all types of M&M flavors!

I never leave reviews, but I've used this recipe for years now and felt that a good review is well deserved. I get rave reviews every single time. I usually make plain chocolate chip or white chocolate cranberry. This is THE BEST cookie recipe and I will never use another.  Great job and thank you for posting.

Used Amish butter and baked at 400 degrees for 9 or 10 mins. This made them not melt and flatten out but still soft center.

These are delicious!!  I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter.  I always leave any cookie batter in the fridge for 1-2 hours before baking to prevent spreading too much.

Flat cookie. Takes about 15 minutes to bake the whole way through. Not a keeper.

These turned out great! I used the Mini M&Ms. They really do turn out better if you take the time to press a few candies on the top before you bake them.

These are positively scrumptious! I have made them twice now, and I love both the texture and the flavor. I did use unsalted butter instead of shortening, which I think improves the texture and quality even more. These take the good qualities of the store-bought kind, as well as everything good about homemade recipes, and turns it into a cookie that does not last long around anyone, especially kids! Thank you so much!

This is the old recipe my Mom used as well, I've been looking for a recipe that smelled and tasted like hers...I finally found it.
Now I can have my Mom's cookies again. Thanks Robbi for sharing this recipe. It will be made often now.

Made this recipe early in the morning which made my husband actually get up from the wonderful cookie aroma. He LOVED these cookies. I substituted the shortening for 2 sticks of real butter and after I had the batter completed I put it in the refrigerator for an hour before baking them . I also cooked them for the complete cooking time of 11min. I have an electric oven so this timing was perfect. They came out PERECT . Love this recipe

I made these with butter. Only added one stick instead of shortening. 
Put them in the fridge for 5 minutes before spooning onto tray. 
Cooked them 2 trays at a time for 15 minutes switching racks half way threw.
They look and smell beautiful. Nice and puffy not flat at all. 
Crunchy on the edges and nice and mushy/soft in the middle. These were delicious.

Instead of using shortening I used butter and the cookies turned out great. I think that the recipe calls for a lot of salt and it took me about 20 minutes to cook the cookies at 350 degrees. On the other hand, the cookies tasted great and had a really light texture which was good. 10/10 would make again.

Just made these. I used butter instead of shorting. 1 1/4 cup bread flour and 1 1/4 cup cake flour. 10.5 oz bag of m&m’s was the perfect quantity. Added a dash of sea salt at the end as well. They turned out delicious. Family pleaser!

I made the recipe as written with butter not shortening and substituted coconut sugar for the white sugar.  I chilled the butter for five minutes before baking.  I baked them for 11 minutes... a nice mounded cookie with the edges just starting to brown.  Unfortunately they are dry and salty, nothing chewy about them....not great.

They're delicious! I used butter instead of shortening and all brown sugar (because it's what I had). I chilled the dough for the second batch and that made it not spread out too much. I'll definitely make it again! (review by my 10yo ;-) )

Not sweet enough, unfortunately. This had so many good reviews and I was craving yummy gooey cookies. Not the case with this recipe. It wasn’t bad or anything. Just not my first choice. I found another recipe on here, those cookies to die for. Not bland ordinary tasting. If people had made the other cookies, the reviews for this wouldn’t be as good. Sorry, person who write this recipe!

The only changes I made was that I used butter instead if shortening.  As ither peopme stated, this makes a LOT of cookies. This was the BEST recipe EVER! I had 3 teenage grandkids for the week and they gave them 5 stars! Hubby came home and he absolutely loved them! The next day my daughter in law and 2 more grandkids came over...another 5 star rating!! I've given the recipe to my daughter's and daughter in law and a couple girl friends. This will be my basic recipe from now on!

Used butter instead of shortening. Added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and let the dough chill before baking to prevent the cookies from flattening. They turned out great. Also I used chopped up mini cadbury eggs instead of m&ms. Yum!

I made these a little bigger than a Tbsp but still did about 11 minutes of baking.  Adding the candy before baking helps make sure they are pretty cookies.  Quick and easy to do recipe.

Very good . They do taste like store bought cookies, which is part of what I love about them.  Used half butter and half shortening and chilled the mixture and sheet pans.

How could anymore rate this less than 5 stars? These were awesome! I used chocolate chips in place of the M&M's, but the base of this cookie is buttery and salty. Those wonderful old fashion cookie flavors. I did put the dough in the refrigerator before baking as suggested by Cindy Liebau. Awesome cookies! Will make again!

Delicious cookies. I didn’t have shortening so I used all butter.  I also added some extra m n ms because I think m n m cookies that are mostly cookie are a bummer. Like a helpful reviewer suggested, I put the dough in the fridge for about 40 minutes and had no trouble at all with spreading. The cookies took about 10-11 minutes.

Omg! So yummy! I live this so much so soft and chocolaty! I only made one change. I didn't use shortening I used unsalted butter! Extremely delicious I took them to my coworkers for holiday and they loved them! I can't wait to make again. But it did have a strong brown sugar taste. Next time I might use a little less brown sugar. Other than that... great!

I tried it a couple of times but cookies came out flat. I strongly recommend changing most of the brown sugar for regular and they work out perfect.

My kids love these cookies!  I use the mini baking m&m's as well as chocolate chips in mine for extra chocolate goodness.  I made these one day because I was looking for a recipe that didn't need butter as I was out but I always have crisco on hand.

Excellent recipe! Five stars! I just tried this out this morning and I have had positive reviews from everyone thus far. I used butter instead of shortening and I also added my own special ingredient for more taste. The cookies came out soft, chewy, buttery and overall delicious! Thanks Rob! :D

Just finished baking these. It's a decent tasting little morsel. I used butter flavored crisco, 1tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract and mint m&ms. Not too sweet or too salty. Had a few leftover "kisses" from making peanut butter blossoms so chopped them and added also. Baked for 8 minutes. I would probably bake them again. The kids will love them when they come over Christmas Eve

The cookies are delicious. I switched out shortening for butter. I did what one reviewer recommended and refrigerated the dough for five minutes before spooning onto a cookie sheet. Made a huge difference! Thanks for the tip

I tried this M&M recipe my family and I thought it was the best recipe yet for these cookies.
I have enjoyed it so much that any cookie recipe I make using candies I now use this recipe.
I have not changed a thing it is perfect just the way it is.
Thanks for the recipe

These cookies turned out nice! I used green and red m&m’s to make it more festive. I also used half butter and half shortening and put the batter in the fridge for over an hour to prevent spreading. I also mixed in chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in the batter and used the m&m’s to decorate the tops. I would definitely make these again and my kids love them!

We all loved them! The only thing I changed was I did half shortening half butter only bc I didn't have enough shortening. They still turned out great! I also used Cindy's tip and put the dough in the freezer to mk it cold even btwn cooking time. thx for the recipe!

Tasty and easy. I used one cup softened butter to make these. They spread a little more than I wanted but I’m sure if I would have refrigerated the dough first they would not have spread as much. Didn’t get 72 cookies out of it but I like my cookies a little larger. I still got a little more than 4 dozen. Definitely a keeper!

It's really good, the outsides we're crispy but the insides were soft. The M&M's went great with the cookie and I would definitely recommend.

I was making these cookies for a wedding (using wedding colored m&ms, so I need them to look appetizing as well as taste good).  I used half and half butter/shortening, everything else to the letter.  I also refrigerated the dough for  over an hour before baking.  The taste of the cookies was superb, crisp on the outside, soft and chewy in the center, but a bit greasy, so if that is not your taste, try another recipe.  The look of the cookies was another story...UGLY.  all spread out and the dough was so soft it baked up over the m&m's even when I placed them on top.  So for eating, the recipe is a 5 star, but for looks only a 2.  I had to make another batch using my own tested tollhouse cookie dough recipe.

Yummy!  Made this for an end of the semester class party and everyone loved them! I do confess that I didn't put candies on the top though and just mixed them all in.

I made these and they were excellent! The best cookies I have ever tasted. I added extra M&Ms for some extra chocolate and I added a little extra vanilla (like a quarter teaspoon more). So good!

Delicious! I used shortening, not butter, and it worked great. I recommend cooking for 12 minutes (ungreased cookie sheet).

I thought the flavor was good but they turned out to hard all the way through.  I had a recipe much similar to this and lost it. But they turned out soft and froze beautifully. If I find it, I'll post it.

I used 1 stick butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco, 1Tbsp of vanilla, 3 cups flour, 1 cup mini MMS and pressed regular MMS in the tops of each cookie before baking, baked at 375 for 10-11 min. Also put in frig for 30 min before baking.

I made these today and found that the cookies did not flatten as much as I would like.  Next time I will substitute half the shortening for butter.  Otherwise this is a great recipe.

I made these with my 3 year old. Easy recipe to let her help where she could and easy for me to follow while also chasing her around. I switched the shortening out for unsalted butter. So watch the ratio when making the amount that is good for you! I also melted it just a bit. When everything was mixed, I chilled the dough for 3-5 mins while the oven was heating up. I read that helps a lot in other reviews for this recipe. I also started with the smallest amount of time in the oven and just watched and added as they baked! I don't do a lot of baking. I'm by no means a professional! But they turned out amazing with the butter switch, and I got thumbs up from my daughter and husband! I surprised myself with how decent they turned out for my first time!

I've made a lot of desserts...especially cookies.  These are not good.  Should have gone with my instincts and used butter.  I only like to use shortening for pie crusts.

I feel that flattening the cookies out before you cook them is the best way, because the 1st batch that I put in seemed to not flatten out the way I wanted them to.

These cookies are simply addictive. This is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I've ever encountered. I live in Italy where we don't have shortening (as far as I know) so I substituted a half-and-half butter/margarine mix, no problem.  These cookies are SO good!

We used Nurtiva(R) for shortening, which is made with coconut oil. Our batter looked a little dry, so we added milk. My daughter and I made the cookies as written and turned out fantastic! For my son, who doesn't like chocolate (shocking right?) we put some of the batter (before we added the chocolate) in a different bowl and added white chocolate chips. Will definitely make them again.

This is one of my "go to" Christmas Cookie Exchange recipes. Makes a hearty batch and looks festive using red and green m&m's.  Not a thick, chunky cookie which is probably a good thing as the m&m's show up best.

These are amazing! I made them into small balls and put them in the freezer. Then when I am ready I make a few at a time. Doing this route, I didn't put mms on the top, I just mixed them in. Then i baked for 10 minutes and they came out perfectly baked cookies in a bite size serving. They are truly amazing!

The taste is great! I only had butter on hand and the cookies spread quite a bit, which I expected. I tweaked the cooking time and reduced it to 12 minutes and my cookies were perfectly crisp around the edges and still soft in the middle. They aren't the prettiest cookies but I somehow think a classroom full of 9 year old kids aren't going to care! Thanks for the recipe.

These were a special cookie my Grandmother always made for us at Christmas. I made them both ways this week, with butter and Crisco bars. I prefer the Crisco,  they are thinner and crisper.

I have made these several times and for me, the perfect cookie ends up being 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter.  The shortening gives the cookie some height and air and the butter makes it mmmm, mmmm good! The all butter version tastes great, but it's a flatter cookie, even with refrigeration etc.  For me, 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening is perfection.  These are often requested at school events!

Cookies turned out good even without the brown sugar. Accidentally left it out as there was an ad covering the need for the brown sugar. When adding the sugar in the mixture it  mentioned the word sugar not sugars or I would have reviewed the ingredients again.  Like I said still good.

My family loved these cookies so much, we made them two days in a row.   Everyone that tried them asked for the recipe.  We used a teaspoon scoop to put the dough on the cookie sheet & ended up with roughly 60 cookies.

Yum! Very easy to make with my four year old. We had so much left over M&M's from Halloween that we decided to make these. We did what other reviewers suggested and used butter instead of shortening. Delicious and hardly takes any time at all.

I made these cookies because my son asked for them. I followed the instruction as directed with the exception of using the shortening. I used 2 butter sticks instead. My cookies did come out flat and a bit greasy. The hubby did like them. Mother-in-law suggested to put the cookie dough in the fridge for a few. Maybe they wouldn't come out like frizz-bees. I will attempt to try to make this recipe in the future.

These are some of the best, most beautiful cookies I've ever made! Which totally took me by surprise because I don't typically like M & M cookies or M & M's in general. I used mini M & M's and 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening. I also refrigerated the dough for an hour before baking. These turned out fantastic and I will definitely be baking them again!

I made it using butter instead of the shortening.  I did add a 1/4 tsp of almond extract, along with the vanilla.  Great cookies! I'll save this recipe to repeat later.

I made with butter. Came out delicious.  I usually underbake just a minute so the cookies are soft.  I agree with Maddie S  about a few extra m&m's .

These are amazing cookies. I fully planned to use shortening until I realized I was out. I used butter and they were phenomenal. I also tried sixlets instead of m&ms and they have a yummy malt like flavor that made these over the top. Will use this base recipe for many cookies from now on!

We loved these cookies.  I substituted butter for margarine and I used the mini M&M's baking candies (found in the baking aisle) instead of regular M&M's.  I baked for 10 1/2 minutes, then let them sit on the cookie sheet for a minute before putting them on the cooling rack.  Perfection!

These are pretty good cookies. I made a few adjustments based on other peoples reviews and I'm not sure if that was a good idea. I substituted half butter and half shortening and I added about 1/4 C more flour, but that was because of the climate I'm in. I've made lots of cookies using half shorteninng and half butter and I've never had an issue. I do think that they taste cook, but even trying to shorten the time to make them more gooey, they still come out kind of cake like, which is not my personal preference. The overall taste is still delicious so that was a definite plus. Many reviewers complained that the cookies spread too much, so I put them in the fridge to chill just for a few minutes before I put them into the oven and I didn't have any issues with them spreading. Next time I make these, I am going to make it exactly as the recipe is shown instead and seeing if I can get them ooey gooey :)

I have been looking for a really good M&M cookie recipe for a while. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try when my son wanted fresh, homemade cookies for his lemonade stand. I followed the recipe exactly (except I doubled it). It made 5 dozen and by the end of his sale, we had 2 cookies left!! They were so soft and delicious and this will be my go to recipe from now on for amazing M&M cookies!

I thought that the recipe was quite easy.Also it tasted great just you have to wait quite a long time for it to cool down and it's a bit soft at the bottom.

After reading reviews, we substituted butter for the shortening and they were great! My girls made them with red, white, and blue M&M's for a patriotic bake sale. This recipe is a keeper, especially since seasonal M&M's will easily transform these into a pretty holiday treat at any time during the year.

I changed absolutely nothing ingredient-wise and loved these cookies.   I think substituting butter is a mistake as it changes the dynamic of the finished product.  In fact that is such a major change, you can't really say you made this recipe.  If you must have butter flavor, use butter Crisco or add butter flavoring.  I didn't use a teaspoon for portion but rather an ice cream scoop - these were intended for college boys who like substantial portions.  The reviews from the boys:  Awesome.

Classic cookie recipe with M&Ms. I used butter (2 sticks and 2 tsp) instead of shortening. And I had to cook them way longer. Like 15-18 min. But I like to make mammoth sizes cookies. Nom nom nom!

I made the recipe with 1 cup of butter instead of shortening and they came out fantastic as far as  look & the texture.  But they fell flat as far as taste.  I think this recipe is great to impress when you present to young children or to add color to a birthday party, but definitely not something that will suddenly evaporate from the kitchen counter.  But the recipe does make perfect M&M' cookies just as promised, so I give it 3 stars! Thank you for sharing, I'll keep  it in my recipe "book" for  children's  parties.

I've always been a cookie making failure but this recipe is awesome!!  I'm giving 4 stars because I used 2 sticks room temp butter instead of shortening and also half vanilla, half almond extract (happy accident when I realized I didn't have enough vanilla).  The cookies are kinda flat probably because of the butter but I actually like them that way.  The cookie is still chewy with crisp edges... nomnomnom

Excellent!  Everybody really loved these.  I used all butter instead of shortening (1 stick regular unsalted, 1 stick light butter) but other than that went by the recipe.  I did have to add a bit more flour to thicken it up... with that and refrigerating between batches, they turned out perfectly!

Okay, as suggested I played around with butter/shortening/coconut oil/apple sauce. I ended up settling on the CO and apple sauce. It made a slightly puffier cookie, but I didn't have to set the dough at all. I whipped it up and it was ready to go.

YUMMY!  I used butter flavored crisco and beat the sugar and crisco in my mixer for several minutes.  I used the folding blade to mix in mini m&m's.  I then refrigerated the dough and it did keep the dough from spreading and the cookies becoming flat.  Delicious recipe!  Thank you!

Instead of oil or butter, I used flax seed. 
After everything was stirred mine looked very crumbly, I was getting discouraged being a rookie baker...but added a few teaspoons of water got the texture I wanted.

I put the dough in the fridge for a few minutes as another comment(I don't remember which) suggested, and I was fine using all shortening. Also, these cookies are fantastic with white chocolate chips instead of m&ms, I actually prefer them that way ^~^

Overall v good, definitely will make again~

Great cookies!  Turned out soft and moist. Cut white sugar by 1/4 cup, used dark chocolate chips.  Used very small scooper to make perfectly round cookies.  Next time will cut salt by 1/4 and add more chocolate to the top of the cookie. Should see at least 3 pieces of choc on top. Took me 11 mins per batch, made 32 cookies.

Very sweet. I swapped out half the shortening for butter because I like my cookies to taste like real food, so they spread even though I chilled the dough.  I don't plan on making these again.

LOVED IT.  I used two sticks of unsalted butter instead of  shortening, and mixed in 3/4 cup of M&Ms and decided not to press more on top and they were the best cookies ever. They were still soft a few days later (there weren't many cookies left by then, though!).  PERFECT.

Well, since the first 4-6 comments said "use butter instead of shortening", that's what I did. Not sure if I'm willing to try this again with the original, listed ingredients. 

My cookies turned out flat; like, a-lace-cookie-with-m&ms. They still taste fin.

They recipe is excellent, I did make the change to butter and was very happy with the taste of these cookies. I wish I would have read the review that suggested putting the dough in the frig for a few minutes so that you don't end up with flat cookies, mine were all flat but really tasty. Also I made a batch with M & M's candy corn and they were the best.

I made these using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I also added a small handful of mini chocolate chips. I refrigerated the dough for an hour before scooping onto trays. Then I refrigerated the cookie trays for an hour before cooking. Cooked for 9-10 minutes. They came out beautifully! They did not spread and they were delicious!!!

I enjoyed this recipe but did make a few adjustments. I used half butter and half shortening instead of all shortening. I also put dough in fridge for 20 min prior to baking.

I can't give a fair review because I switched the shortening for butter. I didn't have shortening on hand and I figured it would still work. Lol the dough was runny so I froze it for about an hour. I suppose it helped a bit. They tasted great, however they were flat and soft. I left the third batch in for about 15 min and that helped a bit as well. I'll add shortening to my grocery list and try it next time.

Super easy cookie to make. I used all butter (unsalted) and put the dough in the fridge for 15 min while the oven pre-heated. Next time I will use a little less white sugar as I thought they tasted a tad too sweet. I used mini peanut butter cups from trader joes rather than M&Ms. My family loved them!

These cookies are delicious and seriously easy to make. I would definitely suggest using butter instead of shortening for a more homemade taste. Also, the recipe doesn't specify, but I found that these cookies have the best taste and texture when made with dark brown sugar instead of light.

Tried with butter and then with shortening. Shortening spreads too much and doesn't taste as good.

I just made these. I was looking for something that was similar to what I have bought in the past from Safeway's bakery. I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 Shortening. I also added about a 1/2cup more of flour. They turned out awesome! The guys are going to devour them tonight! Thanks for sharing!!

These turned out great! I did half shortening half butter instead. Made them kind of bigger and cooked for about ten minutes. They're still a little soft in the middle, which I love. Great cookies!

I just used this recipe as it was written with the exception of adding butter flavoring 1/2 tsp. and they taste amazing. even though I used shortening the butter flavor you can't tell. if you want a light and chewy cookie this is the one to go with.

I listened to Cindy and Maddie S. I used butter instead of shortening and refrigerated the batter before baking. These cookies are incredible!!! It's the only recipe I follow now. For a new twist try using raisinets!! My husband loved the raisinet cookies!!

They were delicious! I added cooked for 12 minutes and used butter rather than shortening, and melted the butter for easy stirring.  Adding the extra m&ms made it even better! They turned out to be light and fluffy, warm yummy cookies.

I'm not as happy with these as I had expected to be. I made half a batch and used dark chocolate m & m's but otherwise stuck to the recipe. In my oven, 9 minutes turned out to be too long and even 8 minutes didn't produce the soft chewy cookies that I like best. These are very crunchy and the flavour isn't all that much better than the average chocolate chip cookie. I might make them again as I have half a stick of shortening left but I'm more likely to look for a different recipe than try to think of ways to improve this one. Sorry for the bad review, I really wanted to love these!

I made these cookies with half butter and half shortening and they came out great and taste good. They did not flatten out like others did. The size is smaller than other cookies I have made. I would make these again.

Per reviewer recommendation, I refrigerated the dough for about 10 mins before shaping into balls (1 inch). Resulted in nice puffy cookies perfectly proportioned for my kidlets. Used V-Day M&Ms and 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup fresh butter since I didn't have enough to make 1 cup shortening. Froze 1/2 the dough for later use. Tasted great!

Great recipe!  I did substitute butter for shortening because that's all I had. I chilled the dough for a few minutes and I did not end up with a flat cookie. I increased the baking time to 14 minutes because Iike a browner cookie.

I am no cook, so I followed this recipe as closely as possible and my only complaint is that the brown sugar is kind of overpowering.  It calls for one cup of packed brown sugar, but probably could have either been cut in half or a cup non-packed.  My only change was I used Crisco butter flavored shortening, but I can't tell that made any difference.  I would be willing to try this again, but really cut back on the brown sugar.

I made the recipe with salted butter and NOT shortening. They were flat, but chewy and moist. My family of 4 devoured them in 2 days. I'm making another batch! They were really good! This is a keeper. Super happy I found the red and green M&M candies half price at the after Christmas sales!

This recipe was a big hit and very tasty. I used mini M & Ms instead of the big M & Ms. I do not like how after 2-3 days they got really stale. I baked them for 9 minutes and 30 seconds to where the middle is chewy and the outer part is crunchy.

This is a great M&M cookie!  I did as recipe instructed but by 1/2 for less cookies,  my mistake! They went so fast that I made another 1/2 recipe the next day,  This time using 1/2 shortening and half butter, and letting the dough sit in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.  The cookies came out not as flat as with all shortening.

I gave this a 3 because of the problems I had.  Followed the recipe exactly (even though I always use butter in my cookies). First time I used shortening.  The first dozen did not spread at all.  they were unbaked in the center. Tried flattening and baking a little longer.  Just got burned bottoms and still unbaked in center.  I rolled them a little smaller, flattened them and then added the extra M&M's. But the flattening caused the edges to solit so had to fix them.  Only baked for 7 minutes - due to smaller size and my oven is hot.  Then they were fine.  The tase is fine, but too much work. Not sure why the problem, but if I make them again I will definitely make with butter!

Great recipe. I used butter instead and also cut out some of the sugar. Next time will try with half peanut butter in place of butter, as some suggested!

I made these with butter instead of shortening. They spread out, were very thin and greasy. I have to take these to my daughter's second grade class tomorrow because I have no other option. But, I will definitely never make these again!  :(

This was good, but I feel there could be a better recipe for this. It wasn't hard, but it wasn't soft either. It was very crunchy. I like cookies that are nice and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

The shortening I had on hand was old and I didnt trust it. Used butter instead which worked just fine. Didnt have a problem with the cookies spreading at all, but because they didnt they were a bit doughy even after full cooking time and sitting on the pan a few extra min. I didnt find them overly sweet at all. Im always nervous trying a new recipe but I would make these again. Perfect for a night of baking with the kids before the holidays!

Wonderful flavor. I subbed unsalted butter for shortening because we just don't care for the taste of shortening in this house. (Sensitive palates all around.)

The butter does make it a flat cookie, which I don't mind as I have other cookies which will mound up nicely, and I like the variety on the plate.

Again, the taste is wonderful. Very sweet, nice crisp edge and bottom with chewy texture and that distinctive homemade cookie flavor.

I'm really pleased with this recipe and it's now my go-to base recipe for a basic cookie. I like a really buttery, soft cookie, so I used 1 1/4 of butter instead of the 1 cup of shortening. They come out fabulous every time!

Thanks to the other reviewers.  Based on recommendations I made these with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening and then chilled for about an hour before baking. Mine took about 12 minutes.  Chewy and beautiful.  Friends that I made them for raved and said they were like store bought!

These cookies are amazing! I used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening and I used an entire 12.6 ounce bag of M&Ms. I put 2 pans in the oven and kept them in for 12 minutes. Delicious and very easy!

I found this recipe to be very simple and quick to whip up. I used butter flavored Crisco and I like to add three tablespoons of cocoa powder and a teaspoon of cream of tartar to the dry ingredients. However, if you do this you will have to pay close attention to the cookies and make sure you take them out BEFORE they look done. They'll be slightly firm around the edges and soft in the middle but as they cool, they'll set up perfectly. Very tasty cookies that disappear faster than my sugar cookies.

I tried this creation and the cookies turned out pretty good. They were chewy in the center and crispier towards the outside. I used 1/4 cup more brown sugar and 1/4 cup less white sugar so they were a little darker. Overall a great cookie, especially for beginners. Perfect for backyard barbeques or a school function.

My Family loved these cookies! I put a cup of the candies directly into the batter. I did not use all of the rest of the candies pushing them into the top. I probably had a little less than 1/4 of a cup left.

These cookies were a hit in our house, I pretty much followed the recipe to a letter except I had less candies than it needed (my fault for not measuring before I started).  I did use the shortening as I had read in one of the reviews that it pretty much eliminates the spreading problem butter has when it gets too warm.  Next time I'll try butter and chill the dough a little just because I'm pretty sure it will taste better than shortening.

Recipe worked beautifully. I was kind of worried when my dough turned out sort of goopy and wasn't able to be rolled into balls by hand but they turned out great! I used butter instead of shortening and I baked for only 9 minutes. I also used about a tablespoon of dough (if not a little more) instead of a teaspoon. Most/all cookies still look raw when they're done in the oven, but once you pull them out and let them cool, they end up turning out, to those of you who have had their batches burn. As long as the bottom is golden, you're golden. And if anyone has had problems with them sticking, parchment paper is a great investment. ;] Will definitely use this recipe again.

These cookies were FABULOUS!!! I had always wanted to make M&M cookies, and this was a great first recipe to try! Instead of using shortening, I used margarine; they still turned out wonderful. The whole family loved them; and by the time they were all eaten up, my family was disappointed that there weren't any more!

This are very good for crowds of all different ages. The cookie part itself is not sugary, but when combined with the M&M's, you get a very good balance of yummy cookie with sugary chocolate. 

I generally freeze my dough using a scooper prior to baking. I've found that if I don't defrost the cookies, let them cook for 5 minutes, take them out for 2 minutes THEN squish them down into a disc shape prior to cooking them for another 7-8 minutes, you get an AWESOME contrast of golden brown bottom with chewy middle.

Didn't have any shortening so I used two sticks of unsalted butter. My cookies came out flat and they are stuck to the pan. I am a very experienced baker and am definitely not making these again! I just added 1/4 cup of flour to the remaining dough. Hopefully I can salvage a few cookies !!!

I wasn't totally thrilled with this recipe.  My cookies came out a little ugly.  I did use butter instead of shortening, though.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and then baked for 9 min and let sit on the tray for 5, but they still came out kind of melted looking.  The dye on the m&m's on the top bled a little (I used the Valentines Day kind) and the shells cracked (see pic). Overall they tasted good, but next time I would try a different recipe.

Cookies were WAY too sweet. And I should have tried half shortening, half butter, like others suggested. Was sadly disappointed. Will not be making these again.

I made these cookies for the Super Bowl party. They were a big hit. I used half unsalted butter at room temp and half shorening as suggested in previous post. I also added 1t cornstarch and 1/4t of baking powder so cookies would be soft.  I refrigerated the dough over nght after taking  advise from MANDACOOK1 and cooked the cookies for 9 mins at 350 degree and left them in the pan for 4 mins. My husband doesn't like hard cookies but he enjoyed these cookies. I do belive this recipe is a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly and I did not like the way the cookies turned out. I should've used butter instead of the shortening.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it's simple and makes a pretty decent cookie. I would've given it 5 stars but, aside from the candy, there's very little flavor to it. I even added some mini semi-sweet morsels and if I got a bite without an M&M, it was very bland. And this was despite having used butter flavored shortening. I might have given this 3 stars, but it's really not too shabby considering it's made up of mostly everyday ingredients and takes very little work.

I followed the directions to a t and the cookies didn't flatten out at all and took 20 mins to get done on the inside and by that time the outside was to brown. My husband said they were good but I didn't like them at all. I would not make this recipe again.

I have made this recipe twice and it gets better each time! I am still playing with my flour since i use only butter but the next batch should be absolutely perfect! I look forward to making some delicious chocolate chip cookies with this too once i get my flour down.

Followed recipe except used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening. At 11 minutes, the cookies were done but were looked undercooked so from my 2nd batch on I cooked from 12-13 minutes to get a little bit of color on the bottom of the cookie. These are not overly sweet and I think would be a good base cookie dough that could be used with other ingredients.

Loved this recipe!  I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter.  I added a handful of chocolate chips as well.  The kids had a great time being "helpers" and putting the M&M's on top of the cookies.  In my convection oven, 9 mins and 30 seconds was perfect.  It was helpful to watch the video that accompanies this recipe too.

Made these for my Sunday School class.  I used unsalted butter, added about 1/4 cup of flour, and I kept the dough in the fridge for about 1 hour.  Also, I used parchment paper.  They turned out great!

Substituted butter for shortening. Reduce salt to 1/2-3/4 teaspoon. Put dough in fridge ~30 minutes before baking to eliminate overspreading of dough.

I think this recipe was really good. It kinda tasted like cookies you'd buy from a bakery. The only thing I didn't like was they were very flat. I think if I added a little more flour it would turn out well. I will make again with a little more flour.

Just made these for the first time. I followed the recipe almost exactly - just used 1/2 butter & 1/2 butter flavored shortening instead of all shortening. Cookies came out delicious, but just a bit crunchier than I would have liked, even though they were baked only 8 minutes. So I am thinking that next time I may try all shortening as the recipe suggests and forget about the butter. (thinking that may be what made them crisp up?) 
This recipe would make a good base for almost any flavor of candies, chips, etc, too.

Made this recipe exactly as stated, including with butter-flavored shortening, except I sifted the flour, salt, and baking soda into the batter. Cookies turned out perfectly! You could probably reduce the amount of flour to 2 cups as the batter was a tiny bit dry, but again, the cookies were perfect, homemade yumminess! :)

I used half shortening and half butter, so perhaps the result is my own fault. Anyway, I cut the batch in half and did M&Ms on one half and chocolate chips on the other. The chocolate chip cookies did not spread anywhere near as much as the M&M ones, for whatever reason; the M&M ones were quite flat. Taste was good, not remarkable, for both cookies, and too flat, so I'll be sticking with my regular recipe.

I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and chilled the dough. Cookies came out perfect - not too crunchy but not too soft.

We had large bag of M&M's left so I tried this recipe with my own twist. Instead of Shortening I used 1 cup (250g) of coconut oil and used 2 cups of flour with 1/2 cup ground flax seed for a somewhat healthy twist. I also left out the salt and mixed all the M&M's in with the dough. Cooked them on convection @ 350F for 10 minutes. They were slightly crispy on the edges and fluffy and soft on the inside! There is a mild coconut flavor but overall just very yummy!

BLEEDING M&M'S?? You bet!  :-D  I am really surprised that some pros did not bring this up at all. The M&M's need to be put on to of the ball of dough, if you want them to look pretty, like in the picture. BUT, bleed as they bake, because the cookie expands, hence a trail of color that does not make for a pretty cookie. I tried a couple different things, and what seem to work the best was to slightly push with my hand the ball of dough, then apply 3 to 4 M&M's on top of each cookie. That helped *tremendously*. I also used butter, no white sugar at all, and they were plenty sweet!.

easy recipe & kid friendly. Made w/ half butter & half shortening. I used only 1 C of M&Ms, but added more on top. It made about 70, nearly 2" cookies. I like mine crispy but there's a fine line w/ M&M cookies to make them crispy enough yet not destroy and melt the M&Ms. 13 minutes seemed to be the right fit for 1tsp / 2/3" balls that were slightly flatted and had 3 -5 M&Ms squished onto them. These are even better eaten right from the freezer! Even crispier! mmmmmm.

Not that flavourful & needs way more candies in it. Used 1 cup butter instead of shortening & 1 cup of m&ms in batter & added another 1+ cup to balls in cookie sheet. put dough in fridge for a few hours before making into balls & baking. Still not nearly enough candy. Next time I will add some chocolate or peanut butter chips.

Step 1 states ""...mix...thoroughly.  Add flour, baking soda, and salt to creamed mixture."

I was assisting in a high school Home Ec class and only half the groups knew to cream the first ingredients.
After they added the dry ingredients to the "thoroughly mixed" ingredients (now called the "creamed mixture"), it was too late to cream the first group. I suggest emphasizing this common first step to novice bakers.  

I suggest these variations: using either butter flavor shortening or a blend of unsalted butter and shortening.

This is perfect for a classic style M&M cookie.  Do refrigerate the dough for a bit before baking.  Makes a real difference in the way the cookie holds its shape.  Will make again.

Delicious!!  I used softened butter instead of shortening and they came out delicious!  I also used previos reviewers suggestions of refrigerating the dough for about 20 minutes or so before putting them in the oven and kept the dough refrigerated between batches.  Once again delicious!!  My daughter can't wait to help me make another batch.

I have made this recipe 2 different times and both times the cookies turned out very flat. Other reviewers suggested adding more flour to the recipe. So, I will give it one more try, this time adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour and see if that makes any difference. If it doesn't, I will look for another M&M cookie recipe.

:( I was very disappointed with this recipe. It's received so many good (or great) reviews that I thought I was golden and everyone  would congratulate me on the best cookie they have ever tasted.  They certainly look homemade but the taste is far from yummy. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening after reading the reviews, maybe I should have done all butter, who knows but I won't be trying them again

These came out great, but I think you could go heavier on the M&Ms if you want to.

We used butter instead of shortening and increased the M&M's.  We enjoyed it and hope to use it again!

I made these almost as directed...subbed half the shortening for butter, which gives more flavor and keeps the "fluff" so you don't end up with a flat cookie.  I was a little disappointed after such high reviews and ratings.  These seemed to be missing something and I'm not sure what - maybe better with peanut butter or tad more salt.

used butter and these spread like crazy. also, had to cook them closer to 12 minutes + about 5 minutes on the baking sheet after i took them out. used peanut butter m&ms and the flavor was delicious, i just wish they hadn't spread so much and become super thin. i'm sure they'll be a hit at work though. will probably use more flour or refrigerate the dough before baking next time.

Very quick and delicious. On my 2nd batch, I added Reese's peanut butter chips and used peanut butter M&M's to turn it into a peanut butter cookie and they came out absolutely amazing.  A must for peanut butter lovers.

Very good!  A little crispier than I expected at 11 min. bake time.  Kids loved them!  I'll try 10 min. next time.  I used butter and they did not spread too much.  I think the cold eggs brought the temp of the batter down.

DELICIOUS cookies! My husband (who is NOT a cook. . . at all, haha) made these Christmas morning as a last minute bring-along to a friend's house. He used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening and mint chocolate M&Ms. They came out amazing, despite him not following the directions (he dumped everything in a bowl and hoped for the best) and a snafu with the hand mixer! Everyone RAVED about these cookies at Christmas. 

So, tonight I decided to make them and see how they turned out. I used butter again and used chocolate chips instead of M&Ms and they still turned out phenomenally.

very good and pretty. followed others suggestions and used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening (I had none available). also added 1/2 c cocoa powder and 1/2 c white chips.  Used mint M&Ms for a festive holiday cookie.  Thank you for this excellent starting point recipe.

These were good and they were exactly what I wanted to make as one of the cookie giveaways for my son's classmates this Christmas.  I followed the recipe except for using margarine instead of shortening just because I know that it would have more flavor as well as guaranteeing a somewhat longer shelf life. These spread a lot and made really big cookies (using 1 heaping teaspoon) so I pressed AT LEAST 8 m&ms on top to get the look that I wanted.  The batter held well at room temperature and didn't get greasy or anything like that even after more than 30 minutes.  Next time I will shape them into balls with floured hands to get that perfect circle of a cookie.  Dropping it unevenly does result in an uneven cookie. It also helps to let the cookie rest on the cookie sheet for a few minutes so they can harden a little bit for easier removal and handling.  An offset spatula was quite useful in removing the cookies.

This recipe is perfect! It is by far the best cookie recipe I've found. The cookies look and taste perfect. I didnt change anything in the recipe and had no problems. I will be using this recipe for my chocolate chip cookies from now on. With my oven they took ten minutes. Recipe says 5-6 dozen, I got a little less than 3 dozen, which is great because I won't have to throw any away. I will definitely be keeping this recipe!

These are a great alternative for me as I live in Italy and it's diffcult to find chocolate chips. I made these for the my sons International school and they were gone in a second. Even saw the Italian mama's and papa's gobbling them up. Thanks

These are GREAT cookies. After reading what other reviewers suggested I too changed the shortening to butter and reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp. As some said that with butter the dough was soft and the cookies spread out too much I just popped the mix into the fridge for about 5 minutes before the first batch then in between each additional batch. Can't wait to make more for Christmas.

I made as it, exactly as it says. I used butter flavored shorting, and a TB to drop the cookies. These are amazing! My family loved them! Definitely going to send some for the holidays, and definitely saving this recipe!!

Great cookie! The only "problem" was that my husband had to keep eating the cookie dough because he thought something wasn't quite right ;). Finally, after three spoonful’s, he figured out that the dough tasted good.

These cookies were everything I was hoping for! I used half butter and half shortening. I also needed to add about half a cup of flour. With these changes they turned out great!

Wow... the bakery where I got these cookies as a kid gave them to us in a brown striped wax bag.  I never thought I'd experience that wonderful flavor again.  I say use the shortening, not the butter, if you want a taste closest to the original.

Delicious. I did 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter; 4 minutes on bottom rack, 5 minutes on top, let them cool, and oh my heavens. What a fantastic cookie! Definitely a keeper. Hubby loved them, too. Always a plus. :)

I made these cookies with the suggestion of others-using half shortening and half butter.  They were good, but next time I will up the butter.  We like a cookie that is a little flatter and a good butter taste.  I also took the advice of others and added a bit more candy to the batter.  These are good, but I think with a little more butter and a little less shortening they will be great! Thank you for the recipe.

Came out really good.I miss real butter flavor but they are good.I gave some to friends and they loved them.Used pastel color candies for easter.Mixed m&m's in dough and also put some on top of each dough ball to make sure you can see m&m's on a cookie.This makes cookies look much better.I will keep this recipe and make again using different colored m&m's that come out every season!

Love these! I changed the shortening to 2 sticks of butter-mainly because I didn't have shortening. They were a hit! My girls can't stop eating them. Everyone should make these. You won't be disappointed! Thank you

These are amazing!  I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening, 1/2 tsp cream of tarter, 1 cup of M&Ms (plus the ones on top), and baked them for 10 minutes.  I used the large cookie scoop from Williams Sonoma.  YUM!!

very good basic cookie recipe, i used butter instead of shortening and coconut extract instead of vanilla. i also added chopped walnuts to the dough since i was a little short on m&m's. 9 minutes may seem too short a time frame to keep them in the oven. i left mine in for 10 and they still seem a bit underdone. other than that a very solid, and expandable cookie recipe

I made these cookies as the instructions stated and they turned out very dry and tasted like Crisco. Even with added almost the whole bag of M&Ms they seemed light on them. Next time I would do half butter and half crisco.

Great recipe! The cookies came out moist and delicious, and everyone loved them. Instead of M&Ms I used Reese's Pieces to add some peanut butter taste...and it's definitely a keeper!

I have to say this recipe has made me want to cook chocolate chip cookies again. I have gotten to the point were the nestle recipe was too buttery and I didn't like it anymore. 

I use this recipe and love it as is, though when I make other types of cookies I vary it some. The half cup butter and half cup crisco works very good for a crispy chewy cookie that is not overly buttey and compliments the flavor of the chocolate. 

Yay Robbi! Best recipe.

These are excellent every time! I make by the recipe exactly (Crisco stick shortening only), but I do add more M&Ms - I stir in 1.5 cups, then top with four or five more per cookie. The batch I just made yielded 48 cookies.

YUM! I just made these today using one 12.6 oz bag of Valentine M&M's - so pretty! Like other reviewers I also substituted the shortening with 2 sticks of butter. I stuck with the tsp of salt and added a pinch extra because I love that hint of salt with the sweetness of the cookie. My boys have already devoured  a bunch of them and in their words these cookies are " AWESOME! ". Thanks for sharing this great classic recipe!

Awesome!  I made these and then used them to make sandwich cookies, putting white frosting in the middle.  I also switched things up a bit and used PB chips instead of M & M's.  Then I used PB frosting in the middle of those sandwich cookies

Following the other reviewers I used butter instead of shortening... These made great cookies with a great presentation... I will recommend as another reviewer did to add atleast an additional 1/4 cup of flour because the cookies did spread very thin.... Next time I will try the extra flour but overall with the replacing the shortening GOOD Recipe

UPDATE: Quarter cup more flour and quarter teaspoon more baking soda really helped... also make sure butter is soft but not melted or hot... recipe is definately 5 stars after that

This is a great recipe if you like a flatter, chewier cookie..which we do!  I use butter and sometimes sprinkle a little sea salt in, as in the ny times chocolate chip recipe.

As others suggested, I used 1/2 C shortening, 1/2 C butter.  Didn't flatten out at all - looked and tasted great!

Excellent cookie recipe; came out perfect with half butter and half butter flavor Crisco. Since I did not have enough m & m's, I substituted the rest with Reeces Pieces, and that added another dimension to the taste.  Not too runny and not too stiff, they look like the store bought cookies, but soooo much better.

Very good recipe. I used the suggestion for half cup of butter and half cup of butter flavored shortening and kinda wish I didn't. The butter flavor in the shortening was a little over powering but it was still very good :)

I was craving chocolate chips cookies last night and because I didn't have any chocolate chips, this recipe was perfect.  Usually for the recipes I find on here, I always have to change something, but these came out perfectly.  They were sooooo good, and it took me about 10 minutes to whip up the batter and have the first batch in the oven.  Best thing was they don't ask for any crazy ingredients, I had them all in the house, besides the M&M's which I got from the corner store.  These will be my go to cookie from now on!

These cookies are delicious and so much fun to make. I love decorating them before baking. I used half a cup of softened butter and half a cup of shortening and the texture and taste was great. Will definitely make these again.

I used to use the toll house chocolate chip cookie recipes for M&M cookies. This was far better in my opinion because it seems to take int consideration better just how sweet M&Ms are. This is a more balance cookie, chewy but fluffy too! Thanks!

Very tasty. I used two sticks of unsalted butter instead of shortening and refrigerated the batter over night. I baked them in the oven for 8 minutes then let them rest on the pan for another 4 minutes.

These were very good. I used half m&m's and half chocolate chips since that is all I had on hand and also used butter favored shortening since that is all I had in the house. I cooked for 12 minutes at 350 degrees and they came out gooey and perfect. Huge hit with the co-workers.

I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter. I also up the flour to 3 cups because I like my cookies on the thicker side. Cooked for 9 mins and they were perfect. Always a hit at my house. Thanks for sharing.

Very good! The only thing I did different was that I added all the candies into the dough. My boys love them and they usually only like chocolate chip cookies. Will double the recipe the next time.

This recipe is AWESOME! Although, I added an extra egg and teaspoon of vanilla extract. They were very moist, I didn't need to put bread with them to keep them soft.

I liked this cookies a lot. My butter was too warm so they spread too much while baking....oh and I used butter instead of shortening, which could've been why they spread in the first place lol.

These are 5 star ONLY if you replace the shortening with unsalted butter...that is what makes these cookies!!!  GREAT!

Made half a batch using butter instead of shortening. The kids loved them, and they had a great texture. Let's see how they taste tomorrow! I will definitely make these again, as they were simple to make, fun and popular.

I love these cookies! I did like some of the others and used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening. I had to had extra flour, around an extra cup but they still turned out wonderfully. I also accidentally bought the M&Ms with peanuts and had to use those but the peanut taste gave them a nice flavor, I had to use less M&Ms.

Ok, but not what I hoped. Like other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening. However, I had to add a whole cup of flour (and should have added additional baking soda). The cookies puddled in the oven to the point of not being able to use the first sheet's worth for our party.

These are very good.  I may try using half butter, half shortening next time as I think a bit of a butter flavor to them might be nice.  For some reason both my husband and I agreed that these tasted much better THE NEXT DAY.   Right out of oven they were ok.  But today we can't stop eating them!  I guess they need to set a bit.  But very good...thanks for sharing!

These cookies where a HUGE hit. I made them exactly as the recipe was stated only made about 4 doz though. I sent them for my 10 year old sons class birthday treat. He has been EXTREMELY difficult to please lately but he requested m & m cookies. His comment was "even I loved them" that gives this a 5 star. Thanks for making me look good.

Despite the cookies spreading pretty badly, they still had very good flavor. I will make them again as written just adding a little more of flour.

Here's the deal: These cookies TASTE VERY GOOD. I even liked the batter and I hate eating raw batter. They are easy to make, I used a food processor.  The cons are: They spread A LOT! My first two batches were basically one huge square cookie but I think that is because of 3 things:  1. I used butter instead of shortening 2. The batter was refrigiated but got a little warm when I dropped them onto the cookie sheet. 3. I didn't space them far enough apart.  How to make this recipe work for you:  When using butter, increase the flour to maybe 2 3/4 cup. Don't add the M&Ms to the batter but press them into the cookie. Refrigiate the batter before using, I rolled it all in teaspoon sized balls, put them on a floured tray and stuck it in the freezer while the cookies were baking. Grease and flour the cookie sheets so it's easier to take them off once baked.   I cooked for around 10 mins but my oven is a little slow. I took them out once they browned a little bit and let them cool for a couple of minutes, then transfered them onto a wire rack.  So why 5 stars? I can't compain about the flat cookies since I chose to use butter. They taste amazing! Chewy, not crunchy, you don't have the horrible taste of butter coming through either. So delicious! I sold them at the bakesale and needless to say they were a hit!  This is a keeper, will add more flour in the future!

I made these for the first time this morning for my child's class. Oh they are fantastic! I followed another review and used two sticks of butter instead of shortening; still turned out great. And they do not taste store-bought--they are filled with homemade goodness.

LUV IT, LUV IT, LUV IT!  My daughter and I are snowed in and decided to bake some cookies, we didn't have any M&Ms but we had chocolate chips!  We decreased the servings to half and they made just enough and were delish!!!  Thanks Robbi for sharing your recipe, this will be a staple!  Can't wait to try it with M&Ms next time.

These were ok, I used half butter and half butter shortening.  I just felt they were lacking something, certainly not the best cookie out there.  If I were to use this recipe again I would use all butter and maybe add rolled oats to give it extra taste and texture.

I was a little skeptical upon reading the reviews, but I needed to bake some kind of M&M cookies for my band section, so I decided to try them. I have absolutely no regret. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.

So deliciously buttery and chewy. These cookies are neither the annoying flat nor "puffy" variety, but rather rise to just the right height, with a faint crunch on the top.  I did choose to replace half of the shortening with butter.

Average. Turned out fine, but the flavour wasn't fantastic and there are a lot of fantastic cookie recipes. Next time I will use my favourite chocolate chip cookie recipe and just add M & Ms.

I'm not a huge M&M-on-cookies fan, but if I HAD to bake them, I would definitely use this recipe again.  They were chewy, sweet, eye-appealing, and they didn't spread into oblivion in the oven.  My kids loved them.    I accidentally blasted my Kitchen Aid, sending about a quarter cup of flour flying, and I ended up adding about 1/3 cup back into the mixture.

My family loves them!!   After reading reviews, I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup unsalted butter.   Turned out very yummy.  Yield was 3 dozen.

I halved the recipe and only got 28 cookies, so I'm thinking there is no way you get 72 cookies out of this!  LOL!  But, they are just OK.  Nothing spectacular here.  My 5 year old likes them a lot, but he's really the only one going back for more.  not bad, but not good either.  Just kind of there.

I was looking for a recipe to make for Christmas like my mom used to make. This was the first I tried, since it had so many good reviews. Fresh out of the oven, I was honestly not impressed. Thought they were kind of a dud, honestly. But, by the next day I understood why they received such great reviews. All I changed was the butter in leiu of the shortening. Great recipe, thanks!

My kids and hubby loved these. This was my first time making and will make again; but what did I do wrong? My batter was so sticky and leaving in for 9 minutes, I could barely scrape them off of my nonstick cookie sheet (it didn't say, but should I have sprayed with Pam?) I did taste (one the day after making) and it seems to taste better on day two.

Used all butter and placed the M&Ms on the tops of each dough ball (used a cookie scoop) before baking instead of adding them to the mix. Excellent results!

These are amazing.  My Mom used to make them every Christmas with the red and green M&M's.  I used mini M&M's.  I had a hard time getting them into the container as they seemed to disappear from the cooling rack!

Whether you are looking for a cookie to take to a social gathering or keeping at home for the cookie jar, this is the perfect cookie!  It bakes up nicely.  I also used butter vs. shortening.

These cookies are better than any bakery cookies I've tried. Followed other reviewers recommendations and used 3/4 cup butter flavored Crisco and 1/4 cup butter. Also added extra M&Ms to top of cookies.

Loved this cookie. Only alteration I made was to use butter. Also, I tried taking the recommendation to bake for less time to avoid a harder cookie, but 8.5 minutes was not enough.

This recipe is great!  The only change I made was used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c shortening.  I have tried this recipe a few times using dark chocolate M&Ms as well as peanut butter ones and those turn out terrific as well.  Very versatile recipe!

I read most of these reviews and went into making these cookies with some apprehension.  The only thing I did differently was to use 3 cups of flour. They are very good!  I'm not sure what someone expected that was disappointed in them but for the simplicity of the recipe I think they are a great addition to my cookie baking-and I bake a lot of cookies.  They obviously do not have a complex flavor but they have very limited ingredients.  Definitely a keeper and with pastel M&Ms perfect for Easter!

I made these cookies yesterday for my nephew and neice that were coming over and although they looked nice, they didn't taste good at all. My nephew and neice only ate half one cookie and they love cookies. The problem for me was that I tasted too much of the shortening. I did use butter flavor shortening but it just wasn't the same. Next time I will try 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening or possibly all butter. I think with the butter substition it will be better.

I was almost afraid to try this receipe after reading others review.  I sent exactly by recipe ingredient and they turned out great!!  I don't know what caused others to have problems; I made sure the brown sugar was "packed" when measured and used fresh baking soda and I used butter flavored Crisco.  Again, it was great!  Thank you for a keeper recipe.

really great recipe, i just felt that the cookies weren't as sweet as they should've/could've been, so perhaps add another 1/4 cup of white sugar. an when adding excessive m&m's, i suggest that you make larger cookies so they're not so overwhelming. the cookies were nice an soft and were a quick an easy idea. =]

LOVED this recipe! The shortening gave the cookies some crisp on the outside which was awesome...The only change we made was to lessen the number of M&Ms, but that's just our personal preference. A fantastic cookie - thanks for sharing your recipe!

I increased the flour to 3 cups and used half butter, half shortening (Crisco butter). I baked in convection oven and they turned out perfect--definitely not flat, but just the right consistency.

awesome!  i made these yesterday for my soccer team, and everyone loved them.  i used the valentine's day m&m's, so they were very festive.  and what's nice, is that when you bit into the cookie, the m&m shell kind of melts into the cookie dough.  so that makes it pretty.  i didn't have any shortening, so i used regular margarine, only used 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and used 3c cups of flour like the others suggested.  i can't wait for st. patty's day, so i can use the green and white m&m's for that.  great recipe!

Great recipe. Kids loved the cookies. I didn't have any butter or shortening on hand so I used margarine. Seems to have worked great. Will definetly be making these again as they were a hit with the kids.

It turned out to be very soft and delicious.I changed the recipe a little bit. I used 1cup of butter rather than shortening. I also used like 3 cups of flour.Then I rolled the dough into balls and pressed the m&M's in them.

They were very good, but a little too crispy for my taste (I may have overbaked a bit though so watch them carefully).  I also substituted the shortening with butter.

This is a pretty good recipe for M&M cookies, but they didn't taste exactly like I remember them tasting.  As others mentioned, I did use butter instead of shortening--I'm just a believer that butter is best in most circumstances.  Also, if you like your cookies to be pretty uniform, just roll the dough into balls, instead of doing drop cookies, but don't forget to put a few M&M's on the top.  They turn out pretty, uniform and round with the pretty colored M&M's on the top.

Perfect!  The only change I made was 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening.  I made them for a holiday party tomorrow...I can't wait to hear what others think.  (I had to sample a couple).

I was surprised at how good these cookies are!  So simple.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  At the end I also added all the M&Ms into the batter and they came out great!  Thanks.

These cookies were perfect! I used 1 stick margarine, and 1 stick butter instead of shortening cause it's what I had on hand. However, it only made about half of what the recipe says it will, and I thought that I made the perfect size cookies, not to big, not to small.

Pretty good! I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter.  I mixed with a wooden spoon, not an electric mixer. I did not grease the cookie sheet. I had to guess what "white sugar" meant since it could mean granulated or powdered. I chose granulated. I wanted a smaller cookie so, I used a baby feeding spoon to drop the cookie dough onto the cookie sheet. That worked great. I got nice small cookies. I used Nestle semi sweet morsels instead of M & M's.  I will probably be making these cookies again on the simplicity factor alone.  I gave this 4 stars.  These cookies were good, they store well and tasted good.

I made these for my boyfriend, who has an addiction to our neighborhood store bakery's version of the M&M cookie. After tasting these cookies (followed exactly, only subsituiting the shortening for butter), he now declares these cookies are better! Thanks for the recipe and making me look like a goddess in the kitchen. :)

My husband loved them. I love the idea of placing the m&m's on top making them pretty. I made them for his work and they got rave reviews on how they look like they came from a bakery.  Mine came out soft and puffy the way my husband likes them. Not crisp and chewy, the way I like them.

These are pretty good.  However, I would of liked them to be a little bit more softer.  Overall, they do remind me of the store brand cookies, and they're very tasty.  I can't just eat one! lol

i used unsalted butter instead of shortening as everyone recommended but i have to say this cookie is very sweet. it was too sweet for my liking. and that's not a bite w/ the m&m's. that was just a plain bite! if i do make it again, i would make it w/ 1/2 cup less sugar and a 1/3 cup more flour.

These were good. someone wrote they are like store bought cookies and that is true they really spread out.  But they stay chewy.  I added Reeses Peices and they were great.  I will make these again.

simply delicious. extremely soft dough and very very tasty! 

p.s., slightly addictive. i guess the only difference that doesnt make it truly addictive, is what comes first, your taste buds or a stomach ache from all the sweets.

Like people suggested, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening...still think there was too much shortening because it did taste a little like store-bought cookies. So I increased the vanilla to 2tsp and baked them a little longer so that the tops were brown...that way there was a little more flavor :)

Need to try with 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening next time.  They turned out looking perfect with this recipe but the dough was missing something.

These cookies turned out great. I took the advice of others and used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter. I also used mini M&Ms because I find they make the dough easier to scoop than the regular sized candies. I baked the cookies for 9 minutes - perfection. The cookies that escaped being eaten immediately stayed slightly soft in the cookie jar. Thanks for a great cookie recipe.

Use 1/2 butter and half shortening. 1 1/2 t baking powder, 1/2 t salt. more M&Ms. 8 minutes in oven, 10 mins cooling. those were the changes I made and they were perfect.

These were good.  Just like the Toll House recipe, but it has 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, instead of 3/4 of each.  They were good, but not the best I ever had.

I made these for my husband, and he loved them! The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening (instead of a full cup of shortening), as other reviewers had suggested. They're a bit too salty for my taste, but I only had unsalted butter, so I added 1/3 tsp salt. I won't do that again, but I will use this recipe again!

I had a craving for M&M cookies and these hit the spot!

I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored crisco. Not sure how that may have affected the flavor - but they came out perfect. 

Rather than just dropping the dough, I rolled into balls and then flattened - that way I got picture perfect "bakery" cookies.

Next time I won't add the M&Ms to the dough and instead just push them in the top so I can better control the candy to cookie ratio :)

Thanks for the recipe!

These were some of the best cookies I've ever made- and I've baked a few cookies! The only thing I changed was added some chopped dark chocolate candy bar because I did not have the entire  1 1/2 cups of m&ms. This added a nice contrast to the m&m's and I will continue to add the chocolate in the future.

Pretty good!  I made them with Reese's pieces and went half butter, half shortening.  I think I'd cut a bit of the salt next time, but otherwise I'm very pleased.

I never put shortening or salt in my cookies, so I used butter and omitted the salt. These are nice buttery cookies, and plenty sweet, even though I cut down on the M&M's.  Thanks for sharing.

These were okay, I think I like butter based cookie recipes rather then shortening...so that may be the reason I was not crazy for these. The kids however, ate them right up!

These cookies are great! I did use a little butter in place of the shortening (only because I didn't have enough shortening). Replaced 1/4 cup of the shortening with butter. Great recipe!

I made these for my son's hockey team and they came out great.  They spread and were pretty thin, but they stayed chewy and had great flavor.  I used half butter and half shortening because I prefer the flavor of butter in my cookies and I didn't have butter flavored shortening on hand.

I made these cookies yesterday. 
They were excellent.  My husband said, "These are the BEST cookies you've made in your entire life!"  I used butter, 3/4 cup mini m&m's and 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips.  Soft in the middle and crisp around the edges.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.  This one will be used time and time again.

I have made these cookies on several occasions and they are always a hit!  They are definitely my husband's favorite.  This recipe is easy and I deifnitely recommend it!  Depending on what holiday it might be, I use m&ms that color coordinate.

I made these a week or two ago and brought them to school. Everyone loved them, even my ornary science teacher that seems to hate the world. They made several people happy. I didn't eat many because I am a domestic maniac and love to feed people. That is all.

These were ok, I don't know what it is, but I just don't like them that much. They are asking to bake them for way too long.

Very Yummy!  Good basic recipe.  I added raisins, chocolate chips and peanut butter chips to the M&M candies to equal 1 1/2 cups.  Soft and chewy even two days later.  Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly, but wasn't too impressed. They were a little dry and very plain tasting. I think I'll do half butter, half shortening next time. Or maybe try something different altogether. Thanks though....

I'm not sure what went wrong; I followed the recipe exactly except I pressed the M&M's onto the dough balls instead of mixing them into the dough. The temperature was too high and the M&M's cracked and the chocolate burnt. When I tried the second batch without the M&M's, the cookies were way too sweet for my family and my liking.
Two stars for a crispy cookie with a hint of buttery taste.

I made these as heart-shaped cookies on a stick for Valentine's Day...delicious.  I used semi-sweet mini M&Ms which kept the cookie from being overly sweet.  The extra dough I pressed into a jelly roll for a bar cookie--came out perfectly.

Very good! I made these because of the great reviews, and they did not disappoint me. I added a few more M&Ms because I felt it needed more. Overall a great recipe!

Wonderful recipe. The family and neighbors loved them. I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup of dough to make larger cookies.

My "kidlets" helped me make these and they love them!  We made them with Smarties because that's all I had on hand, but they still turned out great.
