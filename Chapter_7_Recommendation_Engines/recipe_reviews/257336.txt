I didn't have syrup so I used honey to make these. They were very very quick and easy and my kids loved them. I love this recipe and will use it again. 4 stars because all oats (which I love!) and no wheat does give any baked goods a kind of rubbery texture.

Very simple and delicious. I only used 1/2 c syrup and added several tsp of flax seeds; the result was very yummy! My kids gobbled these up. Yield was 26 mini (1T batter) muffins, cooked in 15 mins.

Ok, I amended my review from 1 star to 4 stars. I love warm muffins and these are not good warm, they are mushy but when they are room temperature or cold they are really good. I definitely would like to make another attempt at making them. I want to blend the batter longer and cook longer without being disturbed because they sunk when I tested them with a toothpick when it was too early.

It was perfect. Replaced maple syrup with honey. Will definitely do it again.

We all love these muffins! Quick and only the blender to clean up! No gluten or dairy which works better in our house! We use only 1/2 to 2/3 cup syrup for a double batch (which nicely fills the blender); and I leave out one cup of whole oats to add at the end with the chocolate chips for texture. Have now made them many times. Nuts would be a good addition too!

This was good. I formed it into a loaf of bread instead of muffins and added extra cinnamon.

Excellent!  I wanted to use honey which I was a little shy on the called for measure - so I used a couple tablespoons of the syrup.  I could do without the tablespoon portions of the honey/syrup as the muffins are plenty sweet.  I also used steel cut quick oats (what I had on hand).  Put them through the processor a bit before mixing and they turned out fantastic.  Also did a batch with chocolate and one with blueberries.

These are delicious!  The kids loved them, and I love giving them healthy baked goods.  I didn't have enough vanilla extract so I added a little almond extract to compensate and they were still great.

These turned out really well!  Used 220g of bananas, only 1/2 cup of maple syrup and I used avacado oil instead of coconut oil. I found it filled my muffin cups about 7/8ths full and cooked perfectly at 22 minutes.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but they turned out really mushy. I used 3 bananas, no chocolate chips and replaced the maple syrup with honey. Baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. Not fluffy. Just wet and squishy. If I had baked them any longer they would have burned.

Wow! I doubled the recipe and made 2 pans. They are beautiful, fluffy and tender. I needed a dessert for guests but don't have flour in the house, I found this recipe and it is just perfect. I blended them for a long time (5 minutes about) to get the batter smooth enough, and they turned out great. I didn't even have muffin liners but they came out beautifully. I will definitely make these again.

Perfect recipe.  I added honey instead of maple syrup.  Make sure you use the blender to grind the oats a bit.  They were done in 23 minutes.

I mixed the ingredients in a bowl before realizing I was supposed to use a blender/food processor so my oats were whole.  I didn't change anything  but did need an extra 10 mins. of baking time.  The muffins were delicious and my kids ate them up.  I will be making these again and again.
