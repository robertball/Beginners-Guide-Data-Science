Wow! This is one BIG sandwich. It's actually more of a hoagie or sub depending on where you're from but one thing's for sure - it's delicious. I have to laugh as if the addition of some lettuce, tomato and other assorted "veggies" could some how make this seem "healthy". But, you have to splurge once in a while and I guess it's not called the "Heart Stopper 2000" for nothin'! There was no way we could finish this by ourselves so I sent the rest to work with my husband and he told me the guys renamed this "The Widow Maker" - LOL!

Made today for our superbowl lunch and my husband and his brother ate the whole platter!  Used pre-made garlic bread and topped with barbeque sauce, sauteed onions & green peppers.  Through back under the broiler with pepper jack cheese on top before serving.  Excellent fat laden recipe for the boys!

Well, this is definitely a heart stopper! The amount of cheese and meat is astronomical and delicious! I used Muenster and cheddar cheeses. I was surprised that there is no mayo or mustard but it was not needed with the butter and cheese. I made this for a group of hungry football fans and it was perfect with just chips and dip. Quick and easy.

This monster ruled the table at our Memorial Day Picnic.  The guys loved it and said I was to never buy pre-made subs again.  I use extra-long cocktail toothpicks to keep this all together to make it easier to everyone to eat.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.

WOW! This was great!  I only put a 1/2 pound of each of the meats and cheeses on, and it was still a huge sandwich, and it tasted wonderful!

I've made this more than once and it always turns out fantastic!!!  I make french bread dough in my bread machine and then use an oblong loaf pan that makes it look like it has a braided top to bake it in.  I sprayed the pan with olive oil and sprinkled it with cornmeal before putting the dough in.  Looks fantastic and tastes even better!

OMGosh!  This was THE perfect recipe to feed a soccer team.  I picked it for the 5 star rating and the hope that the contents would not make the bread soggy by the time the boys got them.  I was shy about onions and peppers for teen palates, so went VERY light on them. I took squeeze mayo, mustard, and italian dressing just in case, but only 2 boys used condiments.  My son said "They all LOVED 'em.  It was the best team meal yet."  My daughters loved the leftovers, my husband loved the last one.  (by then at least 5 hrs old)  I used 20 sub-sized buns, quadrupled the garlic butter, grated my own parmesan, and used good quality ingredients. (Ok, I went cheap & only used one cheese - provolone) Awesome!!

I'm sorry...but the only heart stopping experience I had with this recipe is when my wallet started crying.  I found it a bit on the dry side and difficult to eat because of its size.

Luckily this sandwich does not live up to its name. Everyone liked it at our Superbowl party. If you want to serve a substantial sandwich, this is the recipe.

This was crazy!!! Couldn't get our mouths around it (and I used less amts. of meats and cheese called for), and we had to eat this in parts, but it was delicious! LOVED the 'garlic bread' bun. Will def make this again, but on a smaller scale, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is definitely our kind of sandwich.  I made it on hoagies so the kid wouldn't feel like he had to share.  He is great about sharing except when it comes to food.

Wow...what a sandwich.  I almost tore my lips trying to fit this thing in my mouth.  I used salami, chicken, smoked turkey and provolone and used a yellow bell pepper rather than a green.  I also added some sun-dried tomatoes and just about doubled the butter mixture so I could be generous with it.  I broiled the bread until lightly browned, added the toppings and wrapped the whole thing up in foil and popped it in the oven for a few minutes.  You could be very creative with this.  Thanks for sharing Bradley.

I had a lot of fun making this, and was pleased with the end result. It looked like any party sub you'd buy in the store. I used a purple bell pepper because that is what was on hand, and omitted the mushrooms (personal preference).

I ran into some problems.  Didn't have parmesan, had run out the day before, doh!  Made it without.  Thought I would put a little greek dressing on the sandwich, thought it would be good with the salami...made the sandwich soggy...arrgh!  I discovered that with meat and cheese, there is such thing as too much of a good thing, even though I cut down to 1/2 lb. per item as suggested in other reviews.  I might try again more true to the original recipe except cutting further back on meat and cheese.

Great sandwich, I did make a couple of changes. I have made it true to recipe. but then I made a couple of changes that I think make it better. 1 Using all the meat and cheese is nuts, there is no way you could get in your mouth. 2 I changed out the parm. for Asiago and non need to skimp. 3 I also skipped the jarred mushrooms for fresh, that I sweated for about 10 min. and then added just a little bit of the garlic butter to saute them for another 5-8 min. Oh and don't be afraid to bump up that garlic. I think I chopped up 8 or 10 cloves to put in the butter.

I made this for an opening football weekend watch party, and it was a hit. The only thing I did different was leave out the mushrooms and serve a little Italian dressing on the side for people to dip there sandwich in if they wished. Huge sandwich, but really good! Try it at your next football watch party!
