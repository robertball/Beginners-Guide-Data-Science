I love a good salad-on-pizza combination. This one was very good! My favorite part was adding the carrots before baking. I never would have done that before this recipe. I will definitely be making again.

Funnest recipe I  have ever made! Fun and delicious. I liked the Romaine lettuce and I used heirloom grape tomatoes, one variation I did was used nutritional yeast in place of the parmesan cheese. The crust was perfect and it tasted like real pizza!.

The  dough was too runny.  Had to add more flour.
