This was delicious! I was able to make it exactly as listed and would make no changes. Kale is NOT a favourite but removing the spine before chopping made it easier to eat. Definitely a keeper.

It turn out delicious! Although, I had to substitute yam for sweet potatoes and I used fresh tomatoes and tomatoe paste instead of canned diced tomatoes. My husband loved this dish, especialy, its creamy flavour.
