EAT THIS!! Please! Delicious Yummy Goodness. Followed the recipe as it was written with minor additions of herbs to suit our taste and a bottle a Sam Adams. WOW!! Gorgeous crispy skin. Juicy flavorful meat. This was similar to a family favorite that usually takes me about 36 hours to create with a dry brine and citrus stuffing done in 2 hours. Simple, very tasty, and fast.  Do it!

This turned out delicious! The only change I mead was instead of using the whole lemon, I zested it in with the onions then juiced it with the  broth.  I find the rind adds a very harsh flavour so this is how I handle any citrus when the whole thing is called for in a recipe.

My wife said that this recipe is definitely a keeper, and I have to agree.  I didn't have a whole chicken but collected enough thighs and drumsticks from the freezer to approximate the volume of meat.  I don't keep light beer in the house and I didn't have a lemon so I substituted a traditional amber lager and bottled lemon juice.  The result was a spectacular success and the leftovers were just as tasty. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a terrific one pan meal, I love it during the winter months But, this is roasting not braising.  Braising is with a tight fitting lid at low temp about 250 for at least 3 hours.  And chicken does not braise well, it becomes dry and stringy.  But roasted like this  is wonderful!  It's only the title that is misleading not the recipe...:-)

I made this recipe tonight for my family and followed the recipe exactly as written.   My family loved the chicken and my daughter said that it was her second favorite ever.   That's high praise because there is some very stiff competition.   The lemon flavor, while there, was very very subtle.   You actually had to hunt for it.    So it definitely wasn't over-powering.   The chicken was very juicy and tender.   We will be making this one again.   Thank you!

Wonderful recipe that delivered tremendous flavor.  First I did not have a fryer larger enough to handle the a spatchcocked chicken so I cut the chicken in half with help from some YouTube videos.  I used a dutch oven and it worked out fine. Next time I will quarter the chicken just for ease of handling and serving.  Remember if you are using a smaller chicken the carrots will need more time, simple just microwave them while you make the gravy!  This is a delicious and straight forward recipe your family or guests will love!

The only thing I changed was using white wine instead of beer because of my girlfriend’s gluten allergy. She said, “make this again anytime!” It came out great. Browning on the skin side worked perfectly to give us some crispy skin. The carrots cooked perfectly. My bird started at 4.5 pounds before taking out the spine so probably could have used 5-10 minutes less roasting time. I paired it with sautéed string beans, an easy, gluten free Knorr’s rice side and of course, the rest of the wine. Great leftovers as well!

This turned out great! I would certainly make it again. My chicken was on the smaller side so 50 minutes was a bit much. The skin was super crispy and the carrots were still firm and full of flavor. My children loved it too!

I'm about to go on vacation, and was really scrambling for something to do with a whole chicken. This recipe is simple, quick, and made up of a lot of common household ingredients. It turned out nicely!

This meal was by far my favorite of all the meals I've made from this website. Absolutely wonderful and while eating my family said make it again quick. The only addition I made was to add a little bit of minced garlic to my broth. I served with roasted potatoes and pretzel bread. So thankful for this recipe!!!

Really liked how this was made but the lemon was too much. Both my carrots and gravy  had a pungent acidic flavour.  I will make this again but tailor it to out tastes.  The chicken came out perfect!  Very tender and moist.  And I loved  that this was all made in one pan.

Nice chicken recipe.  I didn't use beer because I didn't have any.  I added white wine instead.  Because I grow fresh herbs I used fresh herbs instead of dried.  And 5-6 whole garlic cloves.  I will say it's a nice way to cook chicken but removing the back bone almost makes me nauseous.

I agree with everyone below! This recipe was so easy and soooo delicious! I am a huge fan of greek style chicken, lemon olive oil and all the spices so this was so up my alley. I followed the recipe to the T but added a heaping tsp of minced garlic with the onions and a tsp of oregano with the rest of the spices. I would not change a single thing about this recipe otherwise.

I added garlic, lemon zest, seasoning salt and pepper. I also sauteed mushrooms and added them to the platter.

Note: The chicken needed more time to cook.  Even the carrots weren't done in an hour.

It isn't worth spatchcocking the chicken.  Next time I will cut the chicken into quarters. That way it will brown better and cook more evenly.

Followed it to the letter and it came out superb. The sauce was really reduced, a slight oversight but it went well with the brown rice. A nice bottle of Prosecco and a meal fit for royals.

I used about twice as many carrots and also 4-5 redskin potatoes.  This dish has been dinner in our house for two nights with leftovers for lunch today.  It is delicious and very easy to make.

I made it per the recipe with a minor change - more carrots because I love my veggies. It was superb! And so easy!! I've added this to my collection of entertaining meals and it will become a regular in this house.

This was delicious! I use the lemon zest and juice and do not leave the rind as it tends to get bitter. Otherwise, perfection!

A definite keeper!  Moist, flavorful meat with wonderful flavor.  Carrots were a bit too hard for our preference when the chicken was finished, as I only needed to roast the chicken for about 40 minutes to reach temperature.  Easily remedied on the cooktop while the bird was tented and resting and the sauce reduced.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I’ve made this twice. The first time was sublime, but the second time I used an IPA and forgot to chop the veggies into strips rather than chunks. Don’t do that. Potatoes are good though. Brussels sprouts, not as much.

This is truly the best chicken I've ever made. I did everything in my cast iron pan, which makes the cooking process and the cleanup very easy. More importantly, the flavor is amazing and the chicken is the most moist I've ever cooked.
