Wonderful! And not to mention a spicy modern take on a regular breakfast sandwich which was a welcome departure from what I typically make. I added a little sliced tomato for some additional color and flavor. Next time I might try this with regular bacon - either way it'll be delicious. This was so good served with fresh fruit and a hot cup of tea! Thanks for a great recipe Occasional Cooker!

Boy Howdy...this cook never ceases to amaze me with her wonderful recipes. I didn't have any bacon, so my review is just for the egg salad on the muffin. I loved the addition of honey giving this egg salad a nice sweet and spicy combo of flavor. I topped with cilantro since I didn't have any scallions. Just add a nice piece of fruit and you have the perfect brunch. I'm surely going to buy some Canadian bacon and make these for the whole family. Thanks Occasional Cooker, another winning recipe.

I did my best to cut this down to one serving--a few times I eyeballed measurements. I only made one change and that was using real bacon instead of canadian bacon and I crumbled it into the egg mixture. Absolutely delicious.

We really enjoyed this recipe…The addition of horseradish along with honey is not a combination I would have come up with on my own. The addition of  hot sauce, cayenne and my favourite, black pepper blended  together for a very flavourful egg sandwich.  Served this for dinner with hash browns… Will make this again.

These are amazing!  My husband will only eat this version of egg salad. I usually double the recipe so we have more for the next day. Thanks for sharing!!

Yum! This is delicious any way you cut it, even making changes depending on what you have on hand. The main thing I changed was that I used 6 hard boiled eggs rather than 3. I did it exactly the way the recipe called for initially, but after looking at the mixture, it looked like egg soup! There was so much sauce it was ridiculous. So I boiled three more eggs and added them to the mixture and it seemed perfect at six eggs to the amount of sauce. The other thing I changed was just eliminating the bacon altogether since I am a vegetarian. I opted to add a few slices of tomato and replace meant of that. Will definitely make this again with additional variations!

This recipe is nearly identical to one that we used when we owned a B&B in Durango, CO.  The only difference is the addition of horseradish, and we used a lot of cayenne.  It's a great recipe and we always got very positive comments on it when we served it.  The only down side was peeling 5 dozen eggs!

Wonderful!  I used about a teaspoon of Sriracha and the heat was nice.  I also added an extra egg because my eggs were a bit small and it just seemed like it needed a bit more egg.   Loved it!

Thanks for a breakfast recipe that is quick enough for every day and special enough for a company brunch. I chopped the bacon into the egg mixture and mixed in the cheese rather than sprinkling it on top. My husband added a bit of green taco sauce to his, but he really likes things spicy. Next time I might replace the hot sauce with taco sauce.

Delicious as is!  Usually i find myself tweaking everything, but my only change was to use Stone Ground Mustard.

I have made this several times just as the recipe is written and it is wonderful.  It is a little spicy but not too much.  My dad enjoyed it so much that he now requests it for breakfast when he comes to visit.

Wow, loved this! So quick and easy too.  Hubby and I like spicy foods, but I thought with horseradish, cayenne pepper AND hot sauce it would be too much, but it wasn't at all.  Really gave the eggs a nice flavor kick.  Will be making this often, thanks!

made this for a quick dinner, it was delicious!! I cant tolerate a lot of spice or salt, so omitted the hot sauce, salt and black pepper. the horseradish and dijon are a perfect combo for this dish!!

I made just the egg salad portion.  I substituted 2% plain Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise to tweak the protein up and fat content down a bit.  This is delicious!  The touch of honey helps with the heat of the hot sauce and cayenne pepper while still leaving enough of the heat.

I went a little higher on the heat.  I was, however, shy on the honey because I thought it was strange but what I did add, seemed to compliment it nicely.
I'll make this again.

this was okay but i like my egg salad sandwiches to have a lot more mustard (just the standard yellow) or more of a vinegar component.. i omitted the honey but this still tasted sweet to me.. i don't care for canadian bacon so i left that out as well.. i made this with a regular hamburger bun as i didn't have any english muffins and had to sub mozz for the pepperjack.. it's nice to try new things every once in a while but this wasn't for me.. thanks anyway
