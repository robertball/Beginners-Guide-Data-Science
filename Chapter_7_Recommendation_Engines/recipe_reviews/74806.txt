I only made half the recipe and used an entire cup of red hots (instead of the 3/4 cup called for) to give it a more spicy flavor. I also added a few cloves and garnished with lemon and orange slices. It turned out beautifully with just enough cranberries to make your mouth "zing" with each sip! Also because red hots are used instead of cinnamon there is no sludgy spice residue left in the bottom of the cup...but be careful if you drip...it stains!

Really good! Nice holiday alternative to the usual nog etc. Please note however the cinamon candies they are talking about in this recipe are not the chewy kind but the cinamon hearts that you get near valentines (I figured this out when I tried to disolve them and after 1 hour they had still not disolved). Instead I substitued cinamon sticks as I couldn't for the life of me find those candies at this time of year (Christmas) so I think it lacked the real cinamon kicker but still very good. Next Valentines I will stock up on those candies so I have some for next year as I imagine it would be superb done by the recipe. I made it for a big family get together smelled the house up real nice and everyone really liked it. I was even asked to make it for Christmas supper instead of the usual tea after supper. It really does make a ton! Next time I will make half the recipe and if it's getting close to gone and not almost bedtime I will make the second batch!

I just made this for Christmas and it was wonderful! It makes an absolute ton but I am going to freeze the rest for a future cold winter day. I brought everything to a boil in a pot and then transferred it to a crock-pot on low for the rest of the day. Everyone served themselves all day long.

REALLY GOOD. I used 1/2 gal. of LITE cranberry juice to 3 qt. apple juice and only 28 oz. pineapple juice plus a 9.5 oz. bag of red hots.

This is our standard Thanksgiving drink. We love it! We make it in the crockpot. You do have to stir quite a bit until the red hots dissolve or you'll have a clump in the bottom of your slow cooker.

This was OK. It did not have the taste I thought it would have.

The pineapple and cranberry juices really add to the typical hot apple cider! Yum. I couldn't find the cinnamon candies and not sure I'd want all that sugar anyway... so instead I used star anise and allspice and let it simmer for an hour. We loved it.
