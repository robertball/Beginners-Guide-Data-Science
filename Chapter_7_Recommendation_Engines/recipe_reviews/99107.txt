Wow, am I suprised to see this!  This is such a decadent, impressive, and pretty salad.  Make sure you garnish the center of the plate/platter as well as the outside.  Great for a special summer dinner, or a ladies luncheon or bridal shower.  You can also skip the lobster to make it a little less expensive to make.  Enjoy, Wendy

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was great!  I steamed 2 lobster tails and bought a lg can of lump crab meat (I left out the shrimp).  I left out the kiwi but added oranges and used red grapefruit.  I pre-plated the salad and before serving I put the seafood on top. I had extra seafood so I plated a large platter of salad and served the extra seafood on the side.  I also doubled the dressing which is very tasty.  My guests ate it all up!  This is an elegant, impressive and easy salad to serve only to your best friends and family!

THIS WAS A BIG HIT AT A SMALL DINNER PARTY.  I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY OTHER THAN ADDING A FEW RIPE STRAWBERRIES TO THE FRUIT MEDLEY AND GARNISHING WITH A KING CRAB LEG AND A COUPLE OF U-15 GULF SHRIMP TAILS. CHECK OUT THE PHOTO!
