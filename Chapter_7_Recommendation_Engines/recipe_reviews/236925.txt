How can you make all those changes to the recipe and then rate it 3 stars?  You didn't even make the featured recipe!! If you used Manwich, you did not make this recipe. I am happy to hear how you tweaked it the second time around, but no one wants to hear you complain that something did not turn out when you don't follow the recipe.,  Thank you to Nick for the laugh!

It befuddles me why people brown the ground beef with onions, peppers etc. etc., then pours off the grease!! You are pouring off FLAVOR. Brown the beef - then add the others after pouring off the the grease.

Otherwise a good recipe.

OK, love the idea ... too sweet for me, kids asked for seconds. 

I'd leave out sugar and maybe just tomato paste and adjust the sweetness with the sugar if needed. I tried to balance with vinegar and then worcestershire sauce after the fact. It mostly worked. 
I only had a green pepper so used carrots & celery, diced very small, which worked well. I didn't add corn because it was already to sweet. Also used whole wheat penne which nobody complained about. So, all in all a solid kid-friendly meal, but tweak the recipe if you don't like your dinner too sweet.

My husband loved it and told me not to lose the recipe.  I used Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with green chilis and replaced the ketchup with a can of tomato soup + 1/2 can water.  For the peppers, I used some hot peppers we had grown in our garden and frozen.

It was so easy to make and everyone loved it.  :)
The only thing I did different was taking out the bell peppers and brown sugar. I added everythig else and it came out really good. Oh and I add more cheese when it came out of the oven. :) 
Well I hope everyone enjoys this simple but tasty dish. :D

We enjoyed this.  I did use elbow macaroni and added some worcestershire sauce to the tomato mixture.  I also used a bit more brown sugar than called for.  I used a blend of cheddar cheeses.  Turned out like an old-fashioned casserole, stretching 1 lb of hamburger to feed 6 or 8 with a nice serving.

Loved it! My 11 year old loved it too, as did our dinner guest.

I doubled everything except the noodles, I used just one box. And I left out the bell peppers. Also added in a touch of Worcestershire sauce, maybe a tablespoon.  For my cans of tomatoes, I used one normal diced, and the other was the kind that has some chili peppers in there. Oh, and I drained them too, that wasn't in the recipe. 

Thanks for posting -- nothing better than some hearty sloppy joe casserole leftovers.

I bought all the ingredients for this easy, kid-friendly meal...and left everything out for the kids to make on a night her dad and I had plans. My 13 year old took the reins and made this dish for her brother and sister.  It was a hit!  Easy to make (she said) and delicious (they all said).  The only critique was it was a bit sweet.  So I'd use less ketchup (ugh...the Italian in me is dying a slow death even as I type that) and maybe substitute it with tomato sauce...or even Sloppy Joe sauce. :)

If you like sweet you will probably like this better than me. The ketchup, being high in sugar, mixed with the brown sugar made it really sweet.

I grew up with the sweet manwich sauce for sloppy joes, so this recipe was spot-on for me.  Couple minor modifications based on availability was venison in place of beef, added mushrooms because I had them, about a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce, and three or four extra cloves of garlic.

Since this was my first time making this I stuck to the recipe verbatim. Only thing I added was slices of Colby Jack cheese placed on top during the last five minutes in the oven.

YUM!! This was the perfect comfort food for us. I followed the recipe step by step- just added a little more ketchup. It wasn’t too sweet for us at all. Will be making again!

I made this just as written, and it was just okay.  It is sweet, and makes a lot, so I could definitely see making it for  a family with small children.  But for the two of us, I won't be making it again.

Made this dish as is, it was okay. To me it tasted more sweet and it was a little bland. Maybe next time when I make this, I will add different seasoning.

I followed the recipe as stated. For some reason, my dish turned out very sweet. I don't believe 1T. brown sugar could make it that sweet.  Maybe 1C. ketchup added too much sweetness? I had to use 1t. vinegar to dilute the sweetness. Next time, I will  not add brown sugar and look for sugar-free ketchup or just use tomato paste/sauce. If you like sweet casseroles, you'll love it as it is. I guess I was expecting more of a tomato-based sauce than a syrup-sweet sauce.

In hindsight, I should have read more of the reviews to see others had already commented on the sweetness of the dish. In the future, I will read more reviews before making a dish.

Yes - I did make changes.  I left out the corn and put in 2 tablespoons of Sweet pickle relish.  I also dumped the green and red pepper.  None of the sloppy Joe recipes I have ever seen have them in it.  And I reduced the ketchup to 1/2 cup since I used the Hunts can of diced tomatoes.  The onion I used was finely diced too.  Also used Mexican Blend cheese.  Liked the idea of the pasta however.  Will make it again.

I tried to make this a little healthier.  I used ground turkey and whole wheat penne. I didn't use any brown sugar and I used sharp cheddar cheese. It was a hit for the entire family, even my young kids. Will certainly be making this again.

Wow. Just absolutely delicious.  This was one of the best recipes I've ever made from Allrecipes.com.  

I only made one change and that was 10 oz of tomato soup and 2 oz of ketchup instead of the 1 cup of ketchup.  Its a pretty sweet dish and i have to assume the addition of all that sugar in the Ketchup would make it too sweet for me.  

The only other suggestion i would make is to MAKE MORE since its a great left over recipe.

This is a good go to easy to make meal.  I had all ingredients in house.  Some people in my family loved it and some enjoyed it but all had more than one helping.  I made it as the directions stated.  But you could use cheese of choice and canned corn instead of frozen.  Nice winter meal.

This made a LOT ! It was more than my little family could eat, but hopefully, it will taste just as good tomorrow. It wasn't as spicy as  true sloppy joes, but my husband and son both had two helpings.

I followed the recipe, but found it a bit too sweet.
When I made it the second time,  I reduced the ketchup by half as well as using half a teaspoon of brown sugar.  I used Sharp Cheddar Cheese as well as Colby Jack Cheese and a teaspoon of Woscestershire Sauce.  Turned out Great!
It's a keeper!!!

I made this recipe as written.  I didn't think it actually tasted at all like sloppy joes.  The husband and kids said it was ok.

I made it with leftover manwich sloppy joe. Added four beaten eggs to the mix before I put it in the baking pan. I also added extra cheese. It was pretty easy and was really good. I will definitely make this again.

I didn't change a thing. I thought it was good, before I put it in the oven with the cheeses. Can't wait for it to come out of the oven, so I can eat it!

Didn't have green pepper so used a can of Rotel, also a diced celery stalk & some herbes de Provence!  Used a bag of frozen mixed vegs instead of just corn, cooked in microwave instead of stovetop, & elbows instead cuz they remind me of mac & cheese, to me the ultimate comfort food!
  Will definitely make again!

Not sure how it is meant to taste  but it was the first time I made it and I think it turned out ok. I used Pork and Veal mince as a substitute for beef. I used Dijon mustard instead of yellow as I already had that. I could not find the Colby Jack cheese anywhere  so used the tasty cheese I already had (I live in Australia),

Followed the recipe with the exception of the pasta. I substituted the penne with elbows. It was good, but maybe a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I will make it without the corn and reduce the sugar.

This dish tastes just like sloppy joes. My only problem is that it was mostly noodles. If you cut the amount of noodles in half its still more than enough. Great for leftovers!

09/03/19: WOW!!  No complaints from family--and there's barely any left for tomorrow's lunch kit; big hit with everyone at my house!  Wife and I wonder where the sweet essence comes from: the ketchup, canned diced tomatoes---or the brown sugar?  Wife says the sweet tang could be cut down; I personally LOVE the sweet tang.  My only change was using shredded sharp Cheddar instead of Colby-Jack.  Looking forward to enjoying this again for lunch.

Made this casserole tonight for dinner.  The only change I made was to omit the peppers, only because I didn't have any.  My husband and grandkids absolutely loved it.  I was skeptical about the brown sugar, plus the ketchup, but it was really tasty.  I imagine the addition of the peppers will only make it even better.  Can't wait to make this again with peppers.

Reading the other reviews was helpful.  Substituted tomatoe sauce for ketchup, to lessen the sweetness.  Substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes for plain diced tomatoes - added just a little kick with the chili peppers. (We don't like spicy or hot, but this was perfect!) This recipe is a keeper!!!

So awesome. I did also add some bbq sauce to the recipe just enough to give it more of a sloppy Joe taste. 
Will make again for sure.

This was great. My guys loved it! I did alter it just a tad. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I didn’t use corn, and I added a few spices to the meat mixture ( celery seed, dry mustard, chili powder). Everything else was exactly the same. Will make again!!

First time I made it, we didn't care for all the corn.   Second time we left out the corn and liked it so much better.   I don't care for cheese so I made it half cheese and half without.  We liked it both ways.  Definitely going to make this again!

Loved it!  A glorified goulash from my childhood! Served the corn on the side so family members could mix in or omit. This is a keeper!

I really liked the taste of this, as did everyone else, and it was simple to make.  I will probably cut the amount of macaroni in half next time because I prefer saucier food, I will also remove about 1/4 of the corn and add some extra cheese; these are strictly our personal tastes, however, so the recipe itself is good and makes enough for an army!  I found the addition of Heinz 57 sauce, only as each person wants it, made a delightful taste combination.  Nicely done...

It was pretty good. I couldn’t help wondering if a can of sloppy joe would be quicker than mixing all this together. I might try that the next time. Overall it was good.

I did like some of the suggestions others made.  I used a can of Ro-Tel  tomatoes, elbow pasta, and dry mustard since I didn't have yellow. Just enough bite to offset any sweetness.  Will make this again. Also good reheated the next day.

I followed the directions mostly. The frozen corn can just be can corn since you just need to warm it up. I did not bake it since it was just to melt the cheese.  I just cooked the noddles and then mixed it all together and warmed it on the stove to melt the cheese.

I added chili powder because that’s how I make sloppy joe seasoning and my wife and I both enjoyed it very much, in the future I will substitute tomato paste for the ketchup to dampen the sweetness.

My family liked it and it was easy to throw together. I had all the ingredients in my pantry except the penne pasta so I substituted shells that I already had. The only thing I would change is to add a little more ground beef.

I was looking for a quick fix to other meal plans that fell through, and considering that I had to improvise a little because I didn't quite have all the ingredients , it came out great and I will make again.

A little too sweet for us. Will not use sugar next time. Corn and ketchup add enough sweetness. The peppers are aromatic but the taste is not overpowering.

Amazing and delicious! I was worried the noodles would dry out in baking in the oven so I added the in cooked noodles and 2 cups of water to the mixture before baking. I also added some of the cheese to help thicken it up. Then topped with the remaining cheese before baking. It turned out perfectly and moist!!  A really easy simple meal that the entire family enjoyed!

Excellent recipe! I am from Texas so used Rotel in place of tomatoes, added 2 Tbsp Worchestershire and 1tsp ancho chili powder for extra spice. I added the corn and cut “okra” right in the skillet of meat & veggies to simmer the 10 minutes. I prefer elbow macaroni and stirred it and the cheese into the skillet and into the oven. DELICIOUS...Thank you!

I have made this many times since stumbling on to it. I was looking for a recipe that was quick and easy and picked this one. Who doesn’t love sloppy joes! While this is a really easy recipe it is not quick. Took me about an hour just chopp veggies. Well worth it though

Made recipe as stated except I was more generous with hamburger and cheese.  Made enough for three big eaters with atleast another full meal to freeze. It is a sweeter recipe but sloppy joes normally are.

Like some others, I used tomato paste instead of ketchup. Next time, I will probably reduce or omit the sugar.

Made enough for 3 medium-sized casseroles, 1 I cooked immediately, 2 I froze. CHANGES: Delete ketchup, brown sugar & mustard.  ADD:  1 can Rotel Tomatoes, 1 can Tomato Soup, 1 mason jar of Home-made Tomato Sauce, 1# Mild Italian Sausage, Worchester Sauce to taste. (NOTE: I used 4 small fresh ears of corn cut of cob, uncooked. Step 4, skip as totally unnecessary - Adding corn to meat mixture instead.) And of course, adding more cheese to top after cooking 20 minutes then return to oven until melted.

Hubby loved it, he loves anything with ground beef so I am always looking for new things. I left out the bell peppers, used Ro-Tel instead of tomatoes (because he likes things spicier), left out sugar, added more onion, sautéed them before adding the beef, used can corn because I didn't have any frozen, would have preferred fresh corn on the cob. This was a last minute fix so will have it the next time.
I did all this in a iron skillet then popped it in oven. When it was almost done I removed and added about 1/2 cup of cheese on top and placed back in until melted. Was delicious!

As written, great, but not quite awesome. There is so much potential for more veggies in this one. I added a can of sliced mushrooms. I also omitted the brown sugar, and it turned out to still be sweet enough without it. Overall, good and easy as written, but it doesn't need the extra sugar.

I removed the sugar and ketchup because we don't like our sloppy joes to be super sweet, but added  in some Worcestershire sauce for some flavor with a hint of sweet and used tomato paste instead.

Seen the recipe and just had to try it. It turned out better then expected. Only change I made was browning meat, peppers and onion in a cast iron skillet and after adding final ingredients popped the skillet into the oven rather then use a casserole dish. Highly recommended for a family dinner night.

The family really liked this.  I made it with Rotini and no cheese (per family request).  It's a nice change from Italian dinners!  To speed things up, I might just use Manwich sauce instead of the ketchup & brown sugar mixture.

I didn't like it but my husband and son ate it, after adding liberal amounts of tobacco sauce.
Cannot fathom why you would add brown sugar when you've already added 8 oz. of catsup.  

TIPS:  To simplify the recipe, add the corn to the tomato mix - no need for separate  prepration.  About 10 min. or less in the oven because the pasta is already warm.  Also, I would dice, not chop the ingredients (as the recipe states).

Made this and it was great. I improvised and used a can of sloppy joe mix, can of diced garlic roasted tomatoes, added extra seasoning, and elbow macaroni. I had everything in my cabinets. I'll be making this gain.

This is easy and delicious.  I used elbow macaroni and it was a hit.  Most casseroles have a lot more tomatoes and my family is not crazy about tomatoes so this is perfect.  I've added it to my recipe box. Thanks!

This was good. Personal preference would be to cut back on the pasta but overall it was really good.
