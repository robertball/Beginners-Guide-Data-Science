This was an exceptional and very quick/easy dish. I made a couple of modification bc I thought only green chiles and cheese might be bland. I mixed the green chiles and mexican cheese in a bowl and stuffed the chicken and placed them in a baking dish.  I then sprinkled ground red (cayenne pepper) and a onion and garlic mixture on it (I didn't have fajita seasoning) Then i spooned sour cream on it and smoothed a thin layer on each. I then topped it with some salsa and the remaining cheese. I had thick chicken breasts so I cooked on 350 for 40 minutes. It was incredibly delicious and tender (even warmed up later as leftovers).

I tried this again, using a cheddar / pepperjack leftover mix (mostly cheddar) and used home made green chile salsa. Minus the packaged seasoning. A very versatile dish. I sauteed the chicken breast in a little garlic and olive oil, poured the salsa ontop until cooked, then topped it with cheese at the end to allow enough time for it to melt.

I loved the simpicity of this dish. I'm always looking for quick weeknight meals for busy evenings. Plus it was a very flavorful dish without alot of ingredients. I followed the recipe and felt no need to change a thing.

My family and I loved this. I didn't follow recipe exactly (I never do) I split breasts then halved them to make smaller cutlets then seasoned them with a chicken grilling seasoning in plastic bag for 24 hrs. Then I just spread the green Chiles on top followed by 3 different cheeses (whatever I had on hand). I had some purple onion and fresh jalapeño that I chopped finely and sprinkled on top. Baked for 20 min at 350 covered in shallow pan then the last 10 uncovered. It came out looking great and for once my chicken wasn't bland or overcooked!

Really yummy!  I combined this recipe with Mexican Sour Cream Rice also on this site.  Used chicken tenders because that was what I had.  Simply laid them on top of the rice, topped with green chilies then pepper jack cheese.  Really good!

This was a nice change for chicken. Mine took longer than 30 minutes to cook and there was so much chicken juice in the dish, If I make again I think I'd brown the breast a little first. I added some chopped onions, bell peppers and tomato to the top and think it gave much more flavor, I think it would be bland without it. The chicken was tasty but think the cheese on top instead of inside would be just as fine.

GREAT FLAVOR!!!! Followed the recipe exact but because I grated to much cheese and bought the wrong size can of green chilies I had extra so I just threw it on top!!! I did brown the chicken before I placed in oven to give it better color. Will make again and again!!

Great recipe! Very simple and you can pair it with just about anything. I paired it with mexican rice and refried beans.

This was incredibly delicious! To those who say this is bland, it must be your fajita seasoning. I recommend making your own. Instead of stuffing the chicken, because I always seem to cut too far and halve it, I just soaked the chicken in olive oil, then tossed the chicken in a bowl of fajita seasoning. I topped the chicken with diced green chilies and pepper jack/mozzarella cheese. Baked for about 25-30 minutes at three-fiddy. Thanks so much for posting this wonderful dinner idea!! My husband loves it! :)

We loved this recipe,  soooo much flavor yet so simple. We used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and because we're lazy we just baked the seasoned thighs with the chiles spread on top and then threw the cheese on top for the last 10 minutes of baking. We are eating this once a week now!

I thought it was pretty good. Since I was very lazy this day, I didn't make the little pocket..I just put the green chilis on top of the chicken and then covered it in cheese. It was great. The cheese was nice and crispy. The only thing I wasn't too much a fan of was the fajita seasoning. I think it would be better with my everyday seasonings.

Super flavorful and easy. I didn't have the canned green chilis, so I sautéed fresh green chilis, garlic, and green onion. Fabulous. But I want to try the canned chilis next time. Bet they're even better. Thank you for this recipe!

This was ok. I thought it needed more of a sauce, so next time I will use a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles. I didn't have pepperjack cheese so I used monterey jack.

Easy and yummy!  Try putting some salsa on top instead of more cheese.  It makes it a little bit lower in fat and adds great flavor!

This was wonderful!  However, I did make a change because I didn't have any pepperjack cheese.  I had bagged grated parmasen cheese so I used it mixed with some drained and chopped bannana peppers, still used the green chili peppers too. I also had to cook it for about 45 minutes, but I think it's my oven temp that's not set right.  This will become a regular dish at our house.

My roommate thinks this is a fancy dish because I use toothpicks. It doesn't really stop the cheese from melting out, but it makes it fancy. I made this the first time and it was demanded again the next week. I don't change a dang thing with the recipe and it's great. Served it with some rice and beans. Cut up the leftover breast (when there has been one) and made a quesadilla with it the next night.

Wow, for 4 ingredients this is fabulous!!  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't measure the fajita seasoning, I just rubbed the breast down liberally and that was that.  The green chili's made the dish.  YUM!!

This was an awesome quick and easy meal! Others mentioned they didnt get the idea of the fajita mix but i think the burst of fajita mix you got with the chicken was great. I also made with the sour cream mexican rice which made it the perfect meal. This has potential to become a weekly  meal

We didn't really like this recipe. The chicken came out really dry. Maybe the stove top would be better to cook with instead of the oven in this case.

I made this with the Carrots Supreme recipe on here and it was a great dish. For whatever reason, it came out with quite a bit of liquid in my baking pan so it was a bit liquidy but still delicious!

Great for a quick meal.  Made some changes due to lack of pepperjack and green chile's.  Used cheddar and monerary jack cheese.  Spices I used where chili powder garlic salt and some adobo pepper seasoning with a little black pepper.  Turned out DELICIOUS!

This dish was better than I expected it to be.  I made it only to use up some extra green chilis I had and was pleasantly surprised.

This was a perfect weeknight dinner. It was quick, easy and super tasty. I served it with some boxed Spanish rice (which took the same amount of cooking time as the chicken, so everything came together nicely) and I thought the whole meal was great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that my fiancee didn't like it as much as I did. He thought it was a little on the boring side, but I think that has to do with the fact that I'd made him a week full of much "fancier" meals before this. I told him that this was my reward for making him meals that took twice as much prep work! This is as close to a "night off" that you can get and not order pizza. I'm making this one again, whether he likes it or not!

I liked it. Some of my group thought it was too spicy.  I believe if you want a milder version, you could omit or decrease the green chili

This was very good! I will definitely make this again, as it is a very simple recipe. 
I had to make a few minor changes: I used 5 chicken breasts (2lbs exact) since 4 wouldn't have been enough for us. Thus, I used the larger can of green chiles (6.75oz., I believe). I couldn't find shredded pepper jack, so I used regular Monterrey Jack cheese. Lastly, I had to increase the cooking time to 50 minutes at 350 degrees. I checked on it after 40 minutes (since I added a chicken breast), and the middles were not cooked thoroughly.

This was easy and delicious, the kids loved it too! The only thing I did different was to cook the chicken first because it was frozen, the flash frozen kind. I boiled it in salted water for about 12-15 minutes. I shortened the baking time to 20 minutes because the chicken was already cooked. I did not stuff the breasts, I just layered the ingredients on top. Very yummy and satisfying. Thank you for sharing!

Pleasantly surprised by this one.  Very tasty.  The fajita seasoning gave the chicken an extra special flavor.  Will make this again.

Delicious. I flattened the chicken a bit and kind of rolled the chilis and cheese inside and secured with toothpicks(only needed 2 per breast). I did add some salsa verde for a little extra juice.

This is an excellent recipe.  I'm on a low-carb diet and it's a great addition to my dinner rotation.  Like others, I found it took longer than 30 minutes to cook, but I had huge chicken breasts.  I ate it with some Tabasco green pepper sauce.  Next time I think I need to add a side of guacamole.

Yes, yes, yes!!  My husband will not eat chicken but he loved this dish.  I didn't change anything except I used chicken filets instead of the whole breasts - modified the baking time and what a great and tasy dish.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was my first time cooking with green chilis and it turned out fantastic.  I added black beans and salsa (based on comments) before putting it in the oven, which made a makeshift sauce.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

This was tasty!  I used the pepper jack cheese the first time, but it was overpowering.  I also used fresh roasted green chilies, because I live in New Mexico and I can!  Delicious.

I made this but had issue with the cheese oozing out. The toothpicks I used weren't the greatest so will use better ones next time. Changed one thing and  mixed the cheese and green chilies together before I stuffed the chicken breast. All in all great recipe and will definitely make it again.

Delicious! However, I like it better when you use tenderloins and then layer the chilis and cheese and bake.  Good flavor though.  When I cooked it with the breasts, we had to cook it longer to finish cooking the chicken.

I made this recipe, by following the directions given, and it turned out great! I would've given it 5 stars, but I was the only one who liked it. It wasn't a hit with my family but they're a bit fussy when it comes to their food. I think it's important to get a nice amount of that cheese inside the chicken for the most amount of flavor from this dish. I just thought that I should mention that.

I made this since my husband is trying to go low-carb. Instead of cutting pockets in the chicken, I just seasoned it with the fajita seasoning and put the chiles and cheese on top. It had to cook for 35-40 minutes. It was fine, but not amazing.

Made this for company and they all loved it.  I seasoned the chicken with chipotle chile and garlic salt then browned (4 minutes per side) the chicken before baking.  Combined green chilies with cheese to stuff, put remaining combo on top of chicken then added a little more cheese and Salsa.  I used a Mexican Cheese blend.  My chicken breasts were thick, so besides browning, I also baked for 40 minutes.  Delicious!

I tweaked it a bit. Added in some chipotle peppers and minced garlic. Nixed the fajita seasoning and just sprinkled some cayenne pepper with the pepper jack cheese on top. If its too much heat, little bit of sour cream on top. Paired it with Rice a Roni Spanish rice. The pepper jack made it pretty greasy so next time I'm just gonna use a Mexican shredded blend and maybe jalapeños.

Loved the flavor.  I shredded the chicken and mixed everything up added a bit of Greek yogurt and made enchiladas with it. Everyone loved them. Will be making them on a regular basis now.

My whole family like this. We are big chicken and cheese lovers. I loved how simple it was to make! The only change I made to the directions was I seasoned both sides of the chicken breast before stuffing it, just made sense to not battle the toothpicks.

Really easy but kind of bland.  I used fresh chilis, but I guess they were not hot enough for my taste.  I didn't cook the cheese and chili inside just layered it on top of the chicken and it turned out fine.
