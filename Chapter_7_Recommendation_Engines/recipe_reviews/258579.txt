Instead of lemon, I used lime.  It was very good, but I didn't have Jasmin rice.

This dish was amazing!  We loved the way the flavors blended.  I followed the recipe exactly  except for cooking the rice separately.  While the rice was cooking in the broth, salt, and butter, I prepared and cooked the garlic and shrimp with lemon zest and juice.  Then when the rice was ready, I folded it in.  I then followed the rest of the recipe for adding the artichokes, spinach, and green onion.  I chopped the artichokes before adding them.  This was really delicious!  My husband and I both loved it.

Such an easy dinner and pleasant aromas for the cook and anyone in the house! I didn’t have any green onions so I chopped up a whole white onion and put it in the pan with garlic. Next time I will probably cook rice separate, since for some reason I’m not sure of, since the rice on top didn’t cook through. Turning over a few times may have fixed that. But was delicious and the lemon flavor was spot on. Chili paste was also a nice addition if you like spicier food.

This is really easy and good.  I prepare the onions, garlic and shrimp separately from rice adding probably a tablespoon of basil.  I also cook the spinach with the onions and garlic.  After cooking the rice  I mix it together and yum!! I did not have any artichokes but didn't seem to miss it.

Very good and easy dish. I would reduce the lemon zest next time and cover the pan when the rice is simmering. It took a lot longer than 15mins and way more chicken broth to get the rice tender but, I think if I had covered it sooner that wouldn't have been an issue.
