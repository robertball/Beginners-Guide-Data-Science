This is very similar to a peach pie recipe that was handed down from my grandmother.  Interestingly, hers makes one pie but all the other ingredients on Patti's recipe are doubled. (1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 2 tbl butter and 2 eggs).  It probably just means more of that yummy custard.  This is one of my top 10 foods of all time.

It is very easy to make and has a wonderful taste. It was fairly runny though and more of a soupy pie. We had to use bowls when eating it. But because it tastes so good, it went pretty fast. I would still make it again, perhaps using more flour.

I don't know if something was left out of this recipe but what I made was a flop.  i used what was called for, baked per instructions, but it never set up all I had was juice.

Is there milk left out of this recipe? A custard, by definition, is made with milk and eggs. When I made the egg mixture, I could see right away it would not adequately cover the peaches. I added 1/4 cup of cream and it still just barely covered them. The pie has a good flavor, though, and disappeared quickly. I may make it again with my alteration.

I went to allrecipes to see if my mother-in-law's "peach custard" pie recipe was missing something--it was not.  It's the same one as this and, while it's different in that there is no milk as in a traditional  "custard" it's always a hit when I serve it this time of year,

I agree with the previous reviews of the pie being too runny. It did seem like something was missing.

I made it as written.  It was a runny mess as stated by other reviewers.  I think Gardners response is the right one.  More flour, sugar and butter, and 2 eggs.  It did taste good, but not what the picture looked like.

Like the other reviews this pie is very runny. It tasted good but more like soup. I wonder if the egg is the problem. I notice here in Canada that the sizes of the eggs are getting smaller. A large egg is now the size of a medium egg. I think that two extra large eggs might help the runniness  of  this pie instead of just one egg.

Okay so I bake a lot and this recipe is seriously flawed. Some significant changes need to be made for it to turn out like the picture. I tried ultragel for thickener and that was a huge step in the right direction and also 1.5 eggs but still that was insufficient.
