This was like all burger recipes really easy, so I loved that!  Usually though my family doesn't really like them for various reasons - too dry, too bland etc, but there were no complaints from this recipe.  

I used some leftover rice instead of the breadcrumbs because I didn't have any, but the most important part is to get the best peperoni you can as that's where the flavour and the extra moistness comes from. All in all, quick, versatile and tasty - a keeper!

Add a slice of mozzarella and some pizza sauce to the burger for a pepperoni pizza burger. Very tasty.

I loved them.  I heated up the pepporoni in the microwave to damp off some of the oil with a paper towel.  Other than that tres bien!

Mmmmm....yummy! Nice and juicy. The pieces of pepperoni came out perfectly crispy. I just used 4 oz. of the pre-sliced pepperoni. Added an extra clove of garlic, and 2 T water as someone suggested, and perfect!

These were delicious!!  My husband loved them!  I served these yummy burgers without buns, but as the main dish.  I also served french cut green beans, some tater-tots (for fun!) and some homemade bread.  My husband asked me to make them again soon!  I might add a bit more garlic, but I'm a huge garlic fan.  I imagine if you upped the spices (add some Italian seasoning and more garlic, you could used ground turkey and have some pepperoni turkey burgers.  I may try that next time.  Please try these--you'll love them!

I thought these were pretty good. I just thought they were missing a little something. I added a splash of steak sauce in them too but they just seem like they need something. I might make these again but add a few more spices. Thanks.

My kids love pepperoni, so this recipe was a huge hit with them.  I don't think it will replace our "regular" hamburger recipe, but it's nice to change up the flavor every once in awhile.  These were simple to prepare and cooked very nicely on the grill.

Really simply, really good! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! The only thing I would change is the size of the pepperoni- for my taste I wasnt getting enough of the pepperoni so I would either add more or NOT mince it, instead cut it in bigger chunks

I didn't have any garlic on-hand, but they were still great without it! My picky-eater boyfriend devoured them. This was a simple way to escape regular ol' burger patties, and I'm not sure I'll ever go back!

These were a little better than ok, but not my favorite burger recipe from this site- a little greasy.  The flavors didn't blend very well, if I were to make them again I would probably let it sit for a few hours.

Yummy!!! My family loved this, I used preslices of the pepporoni so I think it lost a little of the spice, but still came out great!

I really liked these!  I used Hormel Turkey Pepperoni, which lowered the fat and calories quite a bit.  I took another reviewer's advice and topped with provolone and pizza sauce.  The pepperoni flavor really came through; I think they're my favorite "Pizza Burgers" I've tried so far!

I thought the burgers were out of this world! The only change I made, was I used equal parts pepperoni and beef. This also makes a super meatloaf. It's great hot with a red sauce or cold in a sandwich!! I make them often!! I have given the recipe to others, as well as served them to friends and family, everyone raves about them!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE !!!
P.S. I always skin the casing off the pepperoni first and then put it through a meat grinder. It mixes with the beef much easier if it has been ground.

Great! The pepperoni added a real nice kick to this burger, nice and simple to make. To mince down my pepperoni I actually used my grater which worked well. Thanks.

I made this with an extra clove of garlic (we love garlic), the pre-sliced turkey pepperoni you normally put on pizza and 2 tbs of water (as someone else recommended). I warmed up the pepperoni on the stove in a skillet before making the burgers, and then cooked the burgers in the skillet. We both loved the burgers, and found that they were a nice change of pace.

I didn't see the excitement over this.  The pepperoni flavors didn't "pop" and I couldn't help thinking I'd just added more fat and calories to the hamburger with no tasty benefits.

These were just O.K.  It seems like no matter how much pepperoni I added it just didn't seem to matter with the taste and I thought I added a lot.  I probably will never make these again.  Sorry.

I thought they had good flavor... but it almost reminded me of meatloaf. Will make them again, but probably not put pizza sauce on the top of mine. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe!  One thing that I did to make it slightly healthier was broil the pepperoni for a few minutes before I  minced it.  This helped take a LARGE amount of the grease out of the pepperoni, but left some so that the burgers were still juicy.  I also added some Italian seasoning to make it a little zingier!  Great recipe!

On Guy's big bite he fried up the pepperoni slices before adding into a lasagna, I imagine this might help bring out the flavor.  Along with more garlic.

The pepperoni offered a nice change from the burgers we usually make. We topped with marinara sauce, provolone cheese, and grilled vegetables (peppers, onions, zucchini).

It was a good burger. I added a handful of mozzarella cheese, which was a nice addition. I put the pepperoni on some paper towel in the microwave for 10 seconds to drain out excess grease. The burgers were nice and juicy.

I've made this many times and it's always a huge hit. I melt provalone over the top and have people put pizza sauce from a squeezable bottle. I'm famous because of these :)

These were delicious! I topped them with provolone and dressed them like regular burgers. It was snowing, so I cooked them on the stovetop and they still turned out great!

You need to put a lot of pepperoni for the full flavor. We might just put it directly on the burger next time, like bacon.

I'm a college student, and these work in my budget - although it could be because I ALWAYS have pepperoni on hand - and they're always a hit. I usually cook for a group and everyone who's had them has loved them! I usually use chunked (i.e. quartered) presliced pepperoni and omit the garlic.

Yummmmm added an extra clove of garlic, used wheat germ instead of breadcrumbs....meant to add Italian seasonings to the wheat germ but forgot, and also used turkey pepperoni instead is regular.  My grill broke, so I shaped the mixture into patties and baked it for 350 for 55 min or so. Served it with pizza sauce. This recipe is being saved for sure!

This recipe gets 5+ stars from my fiance. He thought they were delicious. I thought they were good, but then again, I don't think pepperoni is nearly as delicious as he does. ;) Thanks!

These weren't bad, but I didn't really taste the pepperoni too much.  Still, they were moist and easy to make and bf liked them.  I guess I was thinking these were more like pizza burgers, but I didn't really think that at all when I ate them.  I'd add a little more pepperoni next time so I can taste it better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sorry, just didn't think these were all that great, and I even added more pepperoni!  They just needed something more, and I'm not sure what that would be!

I went all the way and added pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on top during cooking.  Just used regular pepperoni.  Turned out very good.

I really didn't enjoy this recipe very much and my kids didn't enjoy them either. I mistakingly followed some bad advice. Instead of making it a burger on a bun I put marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese on top. I think it would have been delicious as a burger with onions lettuce cheese and what ever else you like.

These burgers are wonderful! The pepperoni gets crispy and is such a nice change. I have been trying lots of good burger recipes from this site. Such a good change during this outdoor cooking season. I made these the night before grilling. This helped the flavors go thru and the prep was all done. We topped with Mozzarella cheese and warm pizza sauce(no rolls). I paired this with Pepperoni Dip I from this site. Served the dip with warm Italian bread. Awsome and fun dinner! My boyfriend's kids will love these burgers!

We love our burgers when we do splurge to eat them. We try to keep our red meat consumption to once a week.These were just OK for us. If I were to make them again I think I'd add more seasonings and/or some chopped veggies.  I did however use turkey pepperoni and a lower fat ground beef so maybe that had something to do with the flavor, or lack of as well.

These were good and we enjoyed them, but the pepperoni flavor wasn't as pronounced as I hoped. If I were to make them again, I would definitely add more. Thanks!
