I had extreme doubts the whole time making these. The dough didn't come together, rolling them out was a nightmare... the poppyseed filling was packed with so many poppyseeds I wasn't sure if it was a type-O.... BUT they turned out DELICIOUS! I will make these again!

Way too much poppy seed for me. A half cup?? Different flavor. Not for everyone, unfortunately not for me. Thanks anyway.

They taste good and I like there are a lot of poppy seeds but they stuck to the pan and hard to get off once it cooled.  The pan really needs to be greased because of the honey in the filling.  Also they spread so I think spacing them farther apart would be better.  I won't make them again.
