I would never have thought to put hummus with eggs when making egg salad!  Interesting combination!  Tasty!

3 egg whites, 3T hummus and the options are unlimited. Makes a meal for breakfast, lunch or for a snack. Easiest recipe and people really like it.

I didn't care for this at all. I love hummus and eat egg white egg salad all the time but the combination of the two made for an unbalanced flavor and a very heavy salad.

Delicious!  Added paprika instead of hot sauce.  Since I normally use mustard in my egg salad I also added a dash of mustard powder just for my own preferential taste

WONDERFUL. We thought this  was excellent. I used garlic humus and thought it was a great combo with egg. I used all listed ing. and  feel a bit more of all would be good. You can add anything to this ,,,pickles,, sundried tomatoes,,even a few black beans,,whatever you feel. We made a spinach wrap with lettuce and tomatoes.
Will definitely be making this again Iloveit

I love egg salad and love hummus and this is AWESOME. I used veggie hummus with the egg whites and it's delish. I didn't have celery seed on hand so I used a dash of garlic pepper. Delish! My only complaint is that this doesn't make nearly enough. If you're in a time pinch, perhaps purchasing eggs already hard-boiled and pre-made hummus as I did!
