The taste of this was good.  However, I did have trouble cutting a  pocket in each chop.  I thought the chops I bought were plenty thick, but I still had trouble.  I ended up having to roll the meat with the stuffing inside and secured them with toothpicks.  They were more like pork rolls.  I put the remainder of the stuffing mix in the cooker on the bottom.  I added water to thin it out for a nice gravy at the very end.   I will try this again, but I will look for the thickest chops that I can buy.  Thanks!

I agree the taste of this was good.. Instead of including the corn (my family would think I was punishing them!) I just doubled the stuffing, and added some carrot slices.  6-7 hours in the slow cooker I thought was too long though.. next time I think I'll only put them in for 4-5 hours..  They looked/smelled done at that point, and while they were still moist inside, the outside of the chops after 6 hours ended up being dry.  I will make it again though- very easy to make and had wonderful flavor!
