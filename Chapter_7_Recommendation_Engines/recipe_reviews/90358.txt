This was wonderful! I did a warm water bath rather than steaming it....60 minutes at 350 in the oven and it was perfect! Not the least bit overcooked and sooooo creamy and delicious! Not a bit of it was left over after dinner. We served it warm and it was divine!  Thanks for sharing such an easy and yummy recipe! We'll definitely be making it again and again!

This flan is delicious and looks like the kind I order at the Restaurant. I tried many different recipes before I ran into this one, and I have to say the secret to getting that perfect taste and texture is using the egg yolks instead of the whole egg. I placed the filled casserole dish into a larger pan and put water halfway into that pan and baked in a pre-heated oven @350 for 1 hour. Cover the casserole that has the flan with foil paper while in the oven.I need to try to simmer in the stove like the recipes says, either way this is a very easy and wonderful recipe.

Wonderful texture and taste. The caramel did not set but that could be because I used the oven and not the stove top. As others I baked at 350ยบ for 60 min. I did not have cookware that would fit well enough for a stove-top method. UPDATE: After typing in flan in "Tips & Advice" I see that my mistake was not cooking my sugar mixture long enough on the stove. I only cooked to amber and should have let it go to brown.

My mexican husband loved this so much he took it to work to show off. Steaming it in the oven is not at all the same. you get a browned and over cooked flan. I took a pie pan with handles from pyrex and placed it in my very large skillet with handles handing over and place the lid on. the lid made the condensation go back in pan and not in my flan. plus you can see when it is done with our loosinf a tone of heat in the process. OH so creamy.

Made this for a family get together and everyone loved it. My mother said it was even better than her favorite restaurant's flan, which is very good. It's extremely creamy, and a little on the rich side. I can't wait to experiment with flavors on this recipe. I baked it in the oven, in a pan of water and covered in tin foil on 350 like other reviewer suggested, worked perfectly. It's like baking a cheesecake in that sense. Extremely easy to make and the results couldn't be better. Will make this many many times. Only issue I had was spreading the caramel over the bottom of the pan but that's probably just my lack of experience with caramel! :o) A must try recipe!

I liked the idea of making the flan in the bundt cake pan, it made a pretty presentation, I did overcook it a little so it turned a little too brown, see photo. But, it still had a good flavor and was completely gone at the potluck I took it to. The brown sugar in the bottom did not all come out with the flan when I inverted it, so much of it was still had stuck to the inside of the pan. Very difficult to clean (my husband can attest to it.) I did steam the flan in the oven. If I make it again, I will use a different carmel sauce.

It's waaaaaayyyyy too sweet, it's like eating solidified condensed milk, and heavy.
If you are looking for the velvety, pleasant tasting Flan, this recipe it's NOT it.

Very good even if it took longer to make than suggested.  I did steam it over a pot of boiling water and covered it with tin foil tightly.  took it to a church cinco de mayo potluck and it disappeared quickly.  LOL would suggest making angel food cake when you make this to use the egg whites.  I hate to waste.

Really nice.  I did it in 6 ramekins - 50 minutes in a water bath in the oven does the trick.

This was super easy to make and it came out perfect.  I did not steam it though (sounded too dangerous).  I just put it in a larger pan of boiling water and baked in the oven just like the other reviewer.  Made it for Easter (had a ton of eggs on hand), everyone loved it!

This is almost exactly the way my mom's family would make flan when she was growing up! We call it Leche Flan in the Philippines, and usually 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract is added. No big deal though, I just added that and steamed it as the recipe says. I used a large pot that would hold the pie plate and filled it with boiling water about halfway up. The flan was fabulous. Rich and creamy...everything a flan should be!

This is so good! Only change I made is to add 1 teas of vanilla.  I discovered this recipe because I was looking for something to make using the 10-11 egg yolks leftover from making an Angel Food Cake with 11 egg whites.  This fits the bill!  Plus, my dinner guests absolutely love it!!!  Thank you for sharing.

This was pretty good. I really liked the caramel made from brown sugar instead of white. I baked my in the oven in a water bath like other reviewers. I think 60 minutes was just a bit too long. Next time I will check it at 50-55 min.

My daughter made a chocolate angel food cake and I had 10 yolks to use up, so this fit the bill. I thought the flan was a little on the heavy side, though.

Okay, my flan after 2.5hrs, is just now set...dissapointing.  I think I will just use a water bath in the oven for now on.  BUT, the texture is perfect.  I think it's due to the egg yolks being used without any whites.  I will use this recipe for the custard part, but make traditional caramel with white sugar (no butter, that can make it taste too sweet), and bake in oven in the future.

Tired this recipe on the oven; turned out very good, not as sweet as some others claim, just right!  Not the best Flan I've tasted but it was my first one I've baked.  Very good!

This is the first time I tried making Flan.  I had just made an angel food cake and wanted to use up the egg yolks so I tried this recipe.  I too found the flan to be VERY sweet and I like sweet things.  It also tasted quite eggy and not like the flan I remember.  I think I will look for another recipe next time.

This is most like my Tia's recipe from Uruguay except she uses 2 cans of evaporated milk and 2 cans of condensed milk and 1 tbs of vanilla. She also pours the mixture through a wire mesh sieve into the the caramelized baking dish.  Also it can easily be converted to a Baked Flan by baking in a 350 degree preheated oven for 55-60 minutes placed in a larger pan filled with 1 in of hot water.

This flan was better than the one at our local Mexican restaurant!  My family loved it, and my husband thought it took all day to make - little did he know!  I did do the simmering, and it worked like a charm.  I have one of those "simmer" burners on my stove, and now I finally have a reason to use it, it kept the water bubbling perfectly.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

pretty yummy. I did the oven thing with a water bath. added 1.5 tsp of vanilla. My mom said she adds to a little lemon rind too to the caramel. i'll have to try that next time. I think too this time I had over cooked the sugar. Definitely will try again!

I made this by the steam/stove method. I did not feel comfortable sticking the dish in the pot because I was afraid it would fall in, so I put it on top of a rack on top of the pot and covered with tin foil. This worked, but took about 2xs as long. I actually have to agree with the user who said it tastes like thick condensed milk. You barely get a taste of the egg/custard it is just very sweet, although it has a great texture. This is my first flan so I will have to search for another recipe!

A really wonderful recipe. I found that I did have a pie pan with handles and it fit perfectly in our stockpot and the clear lid of the stockpot made a perfect lid for the pie pan, so I steamed mine. I am at sea level so I expected to cook mine for 70 minutes at the most but cooking time was much closer to 2 hours.

I made some with almond extract and some with vanilla. The almond ones were pretty good, but I felt like they were missing something. Serving it with strawberries or something probably would have helped.

People said this was the best flan ever!  I did make it a day ahead and all the juicy caramel sank into the flan.  I thought that made it a failure but my guests loved it!!!!!

I love that this recipe is done on the stove. It worked. I made it in a pie plate with a steamer basket. It was ready in 40 min. I would make this again. It is rich. I only had 5 egg yolks and a 5 oz can of evaporated milk so I added 8 oz of regular milk to substitue the missing evaporated milk.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract. Since I did not have the extra yolk and I wanted to be sure it set I added a teaspoon of cornstarch.  My family liked it but it was very rich and sweet. I would not add the 10 yolks, it would be to eggy for my families taste.
