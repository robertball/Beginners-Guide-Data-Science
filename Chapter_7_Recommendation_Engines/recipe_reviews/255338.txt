This was a big hit - there were no leftovers. The only change I made was a reduction in the spices only because I discovered I was low on cumin too late. I will make this again and use the recommended amounts. My guest has already requested the recipe!!

I love this dish. It was a hit with my husband and kids too. The only thing I added was a bit if yogurt dipping sauce that I whipped up using the same spice mixture. I didnâ€™t get a picture, unfortunately.
