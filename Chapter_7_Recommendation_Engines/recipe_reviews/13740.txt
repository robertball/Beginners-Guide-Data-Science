My family and I had our first Christmas party last year, everyone had to bring a dish...this is what I brought. Everyone just luved it !! But I did something different (like I do with ever recipe). I baked all the seasonings with the cornbread instead of adding them in later. We're having another one this year, and everyone asked me to make EXTRA stuffing...wonderful recipe !!! I have some new ideas for this recipe (I did it for Thanksgiving 11-03)...bake the seasons and herbs with the cornbread mix, cook the onion and celery with the sausage, and use celery salt and celery seeds instead of garlic powered. Also, you can use the juices from your baked turkey for your broth...Excellent!!! I made 4 (3 for other people) pans of this stuffing for Thanksgiving.

I have made this recipe many times and it is my husband favorit. I have made a few chages, Instead of using sage I use sausage with sage, it's not as strong. I have also made this the day before. If you are going to do so DON"T add the broth until you are ready to put it in the oven.

i made this just as called for (but scaled up) and it was horrible.  i was so embarrased on Thanksgiving.  MUCH to salty, which i attribute to the garlic powder.  i have never found a bad recipe on this site, so this was a huge let down for me.

LOVE IT!!!!
Since I made it a few years ago I am asked to bring it to every dinner I go to. It is so simple to make. One year I went to a catered event and was asked to bring this dressing. No one ate what the caterer's dressing. Even my sweetie who only like bread dressing admits this is way better than his.

LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT !!! LOVE IT!!!!

I dont know exactly what scmurphy (in reviews) did, but that person reallymust have screwed up! I bet she/he did garlic salt instead of powder. It's a simple mistake, but don't put crappy reviews in if you're not sure what you did!

Everybody raved over this reciped and it was very easy - even with the cornbread being made from scratch!  Hint:  Make sure to break the sausage into crumbly pieces so it's even distributed throughout the stuffing!

I would recommend adding 1 cup of dried cranberries and 1 14.5 oz can of madarin orange slices (drained) to the mixture before baking.

I substituted the garlic powder for onion powder.
And I used turkey sausage instead of pork sausage.
Very good.
Thanks Barbara.

I made this stuffing recently for a dinner party and it turned out TERRIBLE! I don't know what I did to it because I followed the recipe exactly. I am a new cook so maybe the mistake was mine, but either way it was horrible. I threw it all away before the guests arrived and made Stove Top.

I am always looking for a better stuffing recipe.  This was awesome.  My family and guests loved it.  I made it a couple of additional times between Thanksgiving and Christmas with chicken and pork chops.  Family keeps asking for it.

I used Marie Calanders Corn bread mix and baked the day off. Also used sage sausage and 1can (14oz) of chicken broth. It came out PERFECT. Not dry at all and a little toasted on top. Everyone LOVED it! Finally, I have found the perfect stuffing recipe! Thank you Barbara!

This was pretty good. I didn't have the time or amenities to make my own cornbread (next time for sure!)so I used 3/4 of a bag of Peperidge Farms seasoned cubed stuffing. To that, I added about 1/2 bag of Marie Callenders garlic and butter croutons.  I doubled the chicken stock to compensate for the crunchieness of the croutons. I now know I should have added maybe 2 full cans. Now, my family went beserke, they LOVED this stuffing,.. I also used waaay more onions than the recipe called for but that is just a matter of taste. Yes, I will make this again and I will continue to play with the ingredients.

Fabulous stuffing! Made it for the first time this past Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. I made it a day ahead and then heated it up the day of the holiday. Tends to be on the drier/crumbly side, but my family and I love our stuffing this way. My husband was actually mad there wasn't enough leftovers! Will become a new staple recipe.

This recipe did not work for me.  Poultry stuffing is ideally a kind of savory bread pudding.  There is nothing elegant about it in concept.  Its function is to sop up, and hopefully add to, flavorful drippings from the bird.  Pepperidge Farm basically got it right years ago.

Cornbread, however, is an inferior sopper upper.  It is granular, it is sweet, and its down home taste conflicts with the Italian herbs that usually flavor holiday birds.  Even augmented here with pork sausage (and, in our variation, with four chopped Granny Smith apples for piquancy and red pepper-eggplant puree for color) it resulted in a stuffing that was mealy or mushy as well as sweet.  It was the wrong consistency and the wrong taste.

This was a good way to spruce up plain stuffing but I thought it was kind of salty and I tasted the sausage more than anything. Next time I plan on omitting the salt altogether and using half the sausage.

I was happy to find this, as it's very similar to a recipe I used for Thanksgiving for years.  I use Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing mix and adjust the seasonings to our taste.   A great time-saver if you worked all night and need a Thanksgiving Dinner on the table-or need something with chicken and a vegetable on a weeknight.

This is really good and easy but be sure to use garlic POWDER not garlic salt! Also, I didn't use quite so much because garlic isn't really a "stuffing flavor" to me.

I make this recipe every Thanksgiving. I add a chopped Granny Smith Apple 5 slices of white bread cut into chunks. This year I used sage flavored sausage. Love this recipe!

I've made this two Thanksgivings in a row and one Christmas, and it's ALWAYS a hit! So much so that my sister asked for the recipe and made it for her friends Thanksgiving party. If you don't like traditional stuffing, or just love cornbread, this is definitely the way to go! I made it just as described.

Took this to church social, made double batch. Not a crumb left! My mother-in-law, a FAB cook, asked for the recipe.  Even my son, who only likes what he likes, thought it looked & smelled good enough to try it. Thumbs up, we have a winner!

I added more broth than the recipe called for, but it still fell apart in crumbles.  The flavor was okay, but it was pretty hard to eat because it was so dry.  Not sure what I did wrong...

My husband and I prefer bread-based dressing, but I had some leftover corn bread muffins that I needed to use up so I made this.  Naturally, the cornbread is the primary flavor so make sure you choose a kind you like (I used the Buttery Corn Bread recipe from this site).  We didn't think this was anything exceptional, so we decided this deserved three stars for minimal prep and good flavor.

I generally do the box stuffing for Thanksgiving to save me some time. I thought i would give this recipe a try. It was truly worth it especially the second day (which as a left over was completely finished off)! I even made it again later in the week cuz I had a craving. I made a few changes though taking a few other reviewers suggestions. As far as prep is concerned I baked the dry incredients into the the cornbread and cooked the onion and celery with the sausage using a bit more butter. I also placed the dish in the broiler for the last 5 minutes to crisp the top. As far as ingredients I used sweet turkey sausage, used 1/2 teaspoon of pepper because I like more of a kick and used turkey broth instead of vegetable. I highly suggest this, with the changes it still doesn't take as long as one might think...

First time I tried it, so I have nothing to compare it to.  But this was really good!  I will definitely make it again.  I used a sweet Italian sausage.

OUTSTANDING!  The only suggestion is that knowing how people eat at a holiday, plan on this recipe serving less than the 24 stated.  I doubled it and we served 10, with a reasonable amount of leftovers.

Excellent!  I halved the recipe but followed it exactly and it was super good.  I like my cornbread sweet so I used a Jif mix which I made the day before.  I also used savory sage sausage. I definitely will be making this again!  Tastes like Thanksgiving to me.

Very surprising flavor and easy to make. It is important to remember that the purpose of stuffing is to enhance a meal, not to be the focal point.   One note of caution: If you're idea of stuffing (both in taste and ease of making) is of the synthetic variety, a la "Stove Top)," this recipe isn't for you.

Made this for Christmas.  As a tip, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and everyone loved it.  I also made it in a 9" x 13" cake pan, because that is what I had at the time.  It worked fine.  Used sage sausage as others suggested and then eliminated the sage.  Worked perfectly.  Stuffing can dry out easily though if left to keep warm.  When warming, drizzle a little extra broth over top and cover.  This is the third stuffing I have made, looking for the perfect one and I must say that the other two that I made were much more complicated and this one is the best.  My search is over.

I am far from picky and love stuffing, but this was unimpressive. The flavors didn't blend well at all and it felt like the sweetness of the cornbread didn't meld with the saltiness of the sausage. No one at Thanksgiving ate this. 
We ended up using a box of Stove Top cornbread stuffing and it was much better.

This sounded sooo good I just had to try it.  I followed the recipee to a tee.  We had 20 people at our T-day feast, all of which are not picky eaters and always willing to try new foods.  Only 2 of the 20 really liked it, most said it was "OK", and the rest really didn't like it, including me.  Try the apple -cranberry stuffing - we also had that and it was a hit!

Delicious! Only change I made was baking the cornbread in a 9x12 pan so that it was really thin. Then I was able to cut it into cubes which I prefer over a crumbled dressing. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of baking the spices with the cornbread and the veggies with the sausage. Everyone of us loved this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making stuffing that didn't come from a box.  It was very easy to make.  As some ot the reviews suggested, I baked the seasonings into the cornbread and I ended up using a bit more stock than stated in the recipe.  For a "non-holiday" side dish, I will cut the recipe in 1/2, but I can't wait to make it again!!!

This was a first for me, but my husband loved it.  I have always just had a bread stuffing, so this one was a different flavour profile for me.  Out of habit, I left out the salt, but I think next time I will make sure to add it back in.

This recipe is close to the one I have been making for some 40 some years. I cook the celery, onions, and add mushrooms when cooking the sausage.  I use hot sausage.  It adds just the right flavor, not spicey at all.  I also add the spices to the cornbread mix and then cook it.  I use double the chicken broth. My family asks for the stuffing every year.  It has become a family tradition and is being passed down to the coming generations.

Made this today for Thanksgiving, wanted to try something different and boy oh boy am I glad I found this recipe.  The only thing I would do differently is add more sausage to it,  my family found there wasn't enough but thats a personal preference.  I also made the cornbread from scratch the same day that we used it and I didn't find that you had to make it a day ahead like the recipe says to do, don't really know if it would make a difference or not 
Revised:  Made this again for Christmas but we added an extra 1/2 pound of pork sausage and it was perfect.  this will be the stuffing recipe now everytime we have turkey.  For those who complain that it is too salty, try using a stock that is low in salt.

I am really into the traditional Stove Top stuffing flavor, so I was disappointed by how salty and intense this stuffing was. Some really loved it but it was either loved it or hated it. Followed the recipe exactly but it just had too many strong flavors going on.

This was amazing! I do not know how anybody could not like this recipe just the way it is. I didn't have a lot of the spices so i just used an "Italian Medley" Mrs. Dash I had and it was fantastic!! Thank you for this!! I am taking it to Thanksgiving at my Mother's house.

This was really good.  I even used lighter pork sausage and it was still delicious.  The sausage makes it really salty, so I didn't add any salt and was glad I didn't.  I cooked the sausage and vegetables in the morning then stuck them in the fridge, and just microwaved them for about 30 seconds before adding to the stuffing that night.  This was great stuffed inside a chicken and by itself.

So Good!!! I took the advise of someone, and used the sage sausage, and omitted the sage. I also didn't bother making the cornbread...I just used the boxed dry bread. You've got to try this recipe!

I made a half recipe to test it before taking it to our Thanksgiving Dinner. We loved it!  I always make a 9x13 pan of stuffing for Thanksgiving and usually bring home at least half of that.  This year I wanted something different from the stuffing we've had every year for the last 42 years! This year was different...I made a 9x13 pan of this recipe and only had 1 small serving left.  We nibbled on that while doing the dishes. This is a keeper in our family and will probably be made for the next 42 years LOL.

I will never go back to regular stuffing again!   I used chicken broth, and used minced garlic in place of the powder... Other than that, this recipe is perfect, Everyone loved it!

I, too, followed the recipe exactly and this was horrible.  It was SO dry, it literally crumbled.  Maybe if you used 2 full cans of vegetable broth...not going to waist my time trying this again.

My mother makes the best cornbread stuffing and now I make the second best.  My husband I were going camping for Thanksgiving and we pre-make our items to heat over the fire pit.  We make this recipe and place it in an aluminum pan.  It was great. We kept going back for more and were sad it was gone.  Has a great flavor!  For those who gave it bad reviews - I don't know what you are talking about.  We loved it!

This is pretty good. I gave some to my husband and he said he liked it. I then about two minutes later walked in on  him standing over the stove eating it out of the casserole dish. He had this big smile on his face. I will deffinitly be making this again.

This recipe was great as is, the only changes I made were I used all chicken broth (because I did not have any vegetable broth) and I used minced garlic instead of powder. This is a great recipe that I will be making every year for Thanksgiving. Linda

This tasted okay, but the texture was pretty disappointing.  It was too crumbly and dry.  I think next time, I'll add a beaten egg and more chicken stock.  

One trick I learned from my mom is to turn the broiler on for the last 5 - 10 minutes so the top will be crusty and browned.  Yum!

This was my first time making "real" stuffing, and this recipe turned out great.  My kids loved it.  I followed others advice, I put the seasonings into the bread when I baked it, and I put the onion/ celery with the sausage when I friend it.

It was OK.  I used cornbread stuffing crumbs from the grocery store, and tha was probably my bigmistake.  Overall, it's just not traditional stuffing to us, and didn't tickle the taste buds.  Not bad, but probably won't make again.

I am not a stuffing person or so I thought.  I am just not a white bread stuffing person.  The cornbread texture was spectacular.  I used hot sausage as someone suggested and the flavor added a lot of zing.  Ended up using 3 cups broth to make more moist.

This is a great recipe and I am not the best cook in the world.  I did add a can of turkey broth, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tbsp sugar..so I guess I really am a good cook because everyone raved about this recipe, even those who say they are not a fan of stuffing.

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving and it did not turn out well. I really wanted it to be good and tried it again this year. Same reults. Good flavor but too dry and crumbly.

This is my go to stuffing mix.  I have always used dressed up'd boxed stuffing until I finally found this receipe worth taking the time to make.  I skip the sage and thyme because I don't normally keep either in my spice rack and it doesn't lack in flavor at all.  I'm sure it would be even better with it!

Best dressing since Mom's! My mother just threw everything together without a true written recipe. This recipe is a new twist on a family favorite with the use of sausage... and I used sage sausage... rather than chicken.
