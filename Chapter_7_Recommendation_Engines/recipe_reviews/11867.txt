I love garlic and I love this dish!  One of my favorite things about this recipe is that it can be tailored to what leftovers you have in your fridge.  I throw in roasted chicken, sausage, or salmon, depending on what I have (although the sausage is definitely the best!), and I always add brocoli also.  I usually use parm instead of Romano only because it is what I typically have on hand.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I make this very often because we're big garlic fans and my family also loves their pasta. I don't use as much olive oil and we prefer using blanched and stir fryed broccoli instead of meat. Healthy and delicious!

This was good but needed much more cheese than the recipe calls for. Next time I will add meat and/or veggies because I did feel it was missing something. Great base recipe though!

This is our FAVORITE dish. Although, without the kielbasa, it isn't nearly as good. We use more than the 10 cloves, and it's wonderful. Try different pasta shapes - the garlic sticks well to rotini or farfalle pasta. Thank you for the BEST recipe!

First, I usually divide this into 8 servings instead of 4. Second, as a gardener, I love this. I add what ever is coming out of the garden or leftovers from last night's salad and it is good everytime. add any herbs you have growing and it works too.

I used shredded spaghetti squash instead of pasta for this dish and cut the recipe in half for one whole squash. I added smoked sausage, but didn't have any cheese. It was WONDERFUL! My husband had three helpings. I can't wait to try it with cheese. If you decide to use spaghetti squash, you may want to use less oil. It seems like the squash soaks it up and it can get kind of greasy.

Oh man, this came out so garlicky it was amazing! We added in way more garlic than the recipe called for because my boyfriend and I love garlic that the recipe calls for and we couldn't put this down! On top of the garlic cloves we also had minced garlic in there. This made about 6 servings so we were eating the leftovers all week long and it was still just as tasty as the first time I made it. We will be making this again!

This recipe is awesome!  If you are a garlic lover you must put this in your mouth!  I usually cook chicken with it (good easy garlic chicken also on this site) and it is to die for.  Just beware, your breath will be kickin!  When I make it I add a little more red pepper than called for, and actually I put a few shakes of Garlic powder in the olive oil sauce.  What can I say, I'm a garlic addict!  Good on pretty much any pasta.  I serve it on whatever I have.  Bow-ties, spaghetti, fettucine, the little wheels, doesn't matter, it's all just delicious!

I took this to a dinner party and it was a huge hit! I used 2/3 cup cheese instead of 1/3, and 11 cloves of garlic instead of 10. I made it the original way a few nights before and it was too bland. Try grating some extra romano and sprinkle it over the pasta!

I used half the pasta and evoo and doubled the red pepper.  Tossed my cooked pasta in 1/2 cup chicken stock before tossing everything together so eliminated the salt.  Added a small chopped onion, thinly sliced carrots, sliced red pepper chicken sausage, diced red peppers,  and frozen peas all sauteed in evoo before adding the garlic.  Also sauteed some shrimp in a little garlic butter. Used  fresh  basil instead of parsley. Fantastic!

This was really good.  I roasted the garlic instead of sauteing it.  It was a very nice subtle garlic flavor...a little smokier.  I will definetly make this again.

This was fast and easy, used what I had on hand, and even had some flavor. I thought it needed more heat though so I added some cayenne to my serving. Hubby added some grated parmesan cheese to his. We both enjoyed this side dish. Thanks.

Not very impressed at all. You'd have to add a bunch of things to this meal to make it less bland.

Maybe I skimped out a little on the garlic or cheese or something, but needed more flavor. Added spinach and sausage, which added something to it. 

Pair with "Cheesy Italian Pull Apart Bread" and: yaaaayyyy!

This is a wonderful recipe as written, though we do like to add extra Parm. Do not even consider using anything other than fresh parsley and freshly grated Parmesan. The color of the parsley is beautiful and it imparts such a fresh flavor, something that dried parsley cannot do. A lot of people shy away from fresh Parm because of cost. It is not that much different cost-wise and lasts a LONG time wrapped in the refrigerator.

This was a pretty good recipe, but like others said, it needed a bit more flavor.  I added ground Italian Sausage, and it helped quite a bit on my second try. I really do love me some garlic, so this was right up my alley. Thanks for sharing.

I liked it, as did my dear hubby and sons, but I think It does need kielbasa or feta, to make a main dish....As is, it makes a nice side dish.

What an awesome dish!  Opted to use small grape tomatoes broiled until they split. Grilled Chicken to go with it. Went heavy on the garlic and the parsley so the sauce was thick.  Will make this over and over again.

I have to say that this was a huge hit with the family! I dished out the kids food before adding the red pepper, and actually forgot the cheese until everybody was done eating. I tried it on my seconds and it was even more delicious.  My only substitution was I used some margarine instead of the oil, because that was all I had. I was looking for a simple, tasty, pasta recipe and this was it. Definitely will be making again soon!

I agree with other reviews, good basic recipe to be tweaked to personal taste and what is currently available to you. Even my picky two year old liked it, although he did say "ew" once to some parsley (but still ate it). However my 5 year old who normally likes everything that isn't too spicy said it was too spicy. 

Next time I think I will try adding some diced sun dried tomatoes instead of the pepper. The sweetness vs spicy should appease my 5yo, and should still complement the garlic nicely. 

I did have trouble trying to figure out how many cups 1lb of penne was. Looking around online I guessed it was between 4 and 6. The box of penne I had only had about 4 cups which is way more then 4 servings around here so I only used about half of the cooked pasta.

This left me feeling confused. I LOVE garlic, and was expecting to taste it, but even with 10 cloves.. I didn't get that taste. It was pretty bland. I'll try this again in the future, and if it turns out I just did something wrong, the rating will go up. But it really was missing a lot of flavor. (It's good, just not great.)

This dish is so easy, and so good. It's better known as Aglio e Olio (garlic and oil). I only used about 1/4 cup of oil (possible a bit more - I didn't measure). I used a whole large bulb of garlic, which was probably a bit more than 10 cloves. I think adding anything extra to it would diminish it. I'm probably going to start making this once a week.

This is one of my go-to comfort recipes.
Pasta, check. Garlic, check. Butter, check. Cheese, check. Only difference is I use fresh grated parmesan cheese.

My family and I thought this was an ok dish. Nothing really special. The whole time we were eating everyone was saying if you add this it would be really good or if you add that it would be really good. I think this recipe has alot of potential to be a great recipe. I just think it needs some things added to it. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe. If you find it bland however, switch out the parsley for cilantro--oh so delish! Try Italian sausage or andouille instead of the milder kielbasa. I prefer the Celantani noodles to hold and grab onto the garlic goodness!! I've not met anyone who dislikes this dish.

This is the best recipe ever! I roasted some shrimp in the oven and mixed it in, out of this world.  The first time I made it I served it with chicken piccata, made a wonderful meal.  Will make this often!

Holy Cow!!  YUMMY!!!  This is absolutely AWESOME!  I took some other's advice on adding sausage -- I only had summer sausage on hand that I cubed a handful of and sauted in the oil w/ the garlic.  I also used Whole Wheat Rotini Pasta instead of regular and didn't have Romano cheese so used Grated Parmesan.  I WILL make this again!  DELISH!! Thank you for sharing!!!

We really love this!  I added the kielbasa also, great addition.  I used 1/4 cup oil and it was fine.....not sure how much cheese but probably doubled it.  If you reduce the oil you may want to add some reserved pasta water.  Simply wonderful!

This was great! I love garlic!!!! Instead of using so much garlic I used 7 of garlic and cut the into very small pieces the I put them in the pan with the oil on low for a while so the garlic would not burn but all the flavor would come out, and it did!! Then I added the chicken in the oil, plus the peppers, and parsley on medium heat, after that I added the noodles and Parmesan cheese. The noodles did not feel like they had much flavor but the chicken absorbed all the garlic taste! It evened out the lack of flavor on noodles. I would not have tried this recepy with out chicken and Parmesan cheese because it might have been to bland. I loved it though!!! Just know that no matter how many times you brush your teeth that day the garlic is going to still b there haha

I added kielbasa both times I've made this and it's wonderful. I cook the kielbasa separate to brown then add at the end. I used a mix of romano and parmesan cheese that's shredded instead of grated. We love garlic so I don't skimp on that at all. Delicious!

Cooked this tonight, it was great. We are big LOVERS of garlic so it fit in well with our household. I, however, added some fresh chopped tomatoes and green scallions. My husband just ate and ate and ate. Oh and the house smelled wonderful after dinner.

Fixed it pretty much as written except substituting Parm Cheese and we really liked it.  Great change up for the pasta instead of swimming in tomato sauce & cheese.   Will definitely make again & will try throwing in some Kielbasa

I followed this recipe but added my own touch and it came out phenominal! I thought it was a bit plain so I decided to add some bacon to it. One package of bacon kicks this recipe up to a really tasty meal for dinner. Disgard the bacon grease and then add some olive oil...also some chopped onions would go well with it.

Love this!  We make a pasta similar to this pretty regularily when a quick dinner is needed (can be on the table in 10 minutes!).  This recipe has considerably more garlic than we use and we loved it!  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings; used spaghetti instead of penne and used about 1/2 cup of pasta water to help with the consistency.  The end result was really delicious, quick food.

I made the recipe exactly as written. I am a huge garlic lover, and this is no more garlic than I add to most pasta dishes. However, it's waaaay too spicy because of the red pepper - it's not the garlic that's overpowering. If I take the pepper out, it's the same basic pasta dish I've been making forever.

I was a bit leary to try this recipe without being able to find any sort of Italian sausage in the stores here.  I went ahead, using 1/2 tsp of pre-crushed garlic from a container instead of each clove.  It still turned out very well, and I added a bit more salt to the garlic mixture.  I would make this again.

I think this recipe is yummy.  I had it scaled down to (1) cuz my husband is away for a couple of days.  It was really good.  I found it by listing the ingredients I had on hand, and then searching.  I used fresh romano, that makes it sooooooo good.  Thanks

Really not our favorite.  The oil definitely needs to be reduced, but even then this was unappetizing.

This was mighty tasty and very simple to make.  I made exactly as stated.  It calls for more olive oil than is really necessary.  A little hard on the stomach, I think I'll have to cut back on the garlic next time.

So simple to make, yet so tasty!  I think there must have been a typo in the recipe because 1/4 cup olive oil was the perfect amount for us - otherwise it's too oily.  I don't think it needs sausage, it already has enough flavor by itself! But be prepared for your mouth to taste the garlic for quite awhile afterwards!  I'd recommend drinking water with the pasta because the garlic makes anything else taste funny.

Absolutely an excellent recipe - a little heavy on the olive oil, but it was still good.  Great flavor, not too garlicky, disappeared really quickly!!

We're true garlic lovers, but I wasn't sure that my husband would like this recipe since it didn't have a 'sauce'.  He LOVED it and we took the leftovers to work with us the next day. Great stuff!

I was skeptical because it didn't look like much, but everyone loved it!  I don't know if kids will like this.  The only pain is peeling all that garlic, so I bought one of those garlic peelers to make the job easier, then I use a chopper to do the chopping.

Pasta was great but I too thought it was missing something.  It definitely needed more cheese and next time I think I will add some pasta water, cream or broth. Did not miss the meat.

I've made this several times and my family loves it. I used more garlic and a little more cheese (varies every time I make it). I kept it vegetarian by just adding mushrooms I sauteed separately.

I was almost scared off by the 10 cloves but I'm glad I made it.  It was SO good!  It reminded me of a dish I had in a restaurant and have been unable to replicate until now.  I used half EVOO/half butter and doubled the cheese.

I found this recipe last week and as a quick meal for work the next day I had all ingredients so I put this together.  Wow,  this was amazing.  I even shared with a coworker who agreed this was great.  I followed some other review and used 11 cloves of garlic, and 2/3 cup cheese. I added garlic peppered smoked sausage to this.  This was amazing and easy, will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband and I made this for dinner. We used rotini noodles and served it with chicken. We used a little less oil and it still coated the noodles and chicken very well. I was concerned that the garlic would be overpowering...it is after all 10 cloves, but by browning it it develops a sweet flavor. The only thing we didn't like is that we wished it was a more cream based sauce instead of plain olive oil. We will defiantly make this again.

i used the ten clove garlic marinade and marinated a turkey tenderloin.  i then put roasted the turkey in the oven and then cut it up into bite size pieces and sautéed it with some spring onion and cilantro.  then sautéed onion and carrot with some chicken stock. then i used this recipe and fried the garlic and then served it over some brown rice vermicelli noodles......with a sauce that i made from the marinade and thickened with some gluten free all purpose flour.......Thanks for the idea
i had to make it healthy for my dad cause he has a special diet....so i didnt have any cheese and though i used more garlic than the recipes called for it came out great my dad loved and so did everybody who tried it

I've made this a couple times and my husband and I LOVE it!  I half the recipe since it's just the two of us but I love adding different ingredients each time (sauteed mushroms and steamed asparagus my favorite right now) and will be trying broccoli and onions next time.  This is great if you want to do a meatless meal

as some people have said, this is a good base recipe. it needed more garlic, first of all, but that might just be because i was raised in a very german household. :P i added kielbasa, corn, parmesan, and feta. the corn really helped liven it up. 
all in all, pretty good, but be ready to add your own spin on it or else you'll probably be a little disappointed.

I made this receipe tonight it was very good. I actually added some shrimp to the garlic and seasoning. My six ur old twins thought it was spicy so next time I will ease up on the peppers. I also added parm instead of Romano cheese which was very good. I will recommend this receipe and cook this again.

How anyone can say there is too much garlic, i'll never understand...then again, i am Italian, so i love my garlic and pasta :) This recipe is fantastic b/c it's sooooo easy to do. I did fry up some sausage just to add some protein, but otherwise, doesn't need any changes. Made this for a gf one night, and she asked for the recipe so she could make it for her fiance, who also loves this recipe, so thank you!!!!

This is a dish for serious garlic lovers.  I loved the flavor and I loved how easy it is to make.  The only change I made was parm. cheese instead of romano (and that's because I rarely have romano but almost always have parm cheese).  Thanks for the recipe :)

I add extra garlic and have people put the cheese on their own portion, rather than adding it to the pot. After reading some of the reviews, I also decided to add a pound of chopped kielbasa to this dish, cooking it with the garlic. Simple, but tasty!

Oh my! This was amazing! I was a little hesitant to use 10 cloves of garlic, but its just the right amount! I didn't do much different from the recipe, except used dried parsley, instead of fresh. This will definitely be a keeper!

This is the best dish I have eaten in a long time! I added chicken and broccoli and a cream sauce made out whole milk butter ramono and parmesan cheese. A little bit of flower to thicken the sauce. It was delicious!!!!!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe! We like making it the way it says (only with 1/4 cup olive oil instead of 1/2 cup otherwise it just pools up at the bottom), but we also like to make it with granulated garlic if we don't have any fresh. We replace the Romano with Parmesan. We discovered that steak cut into slices and cooked in some olive oil and added to the pasta makes it a great main course. I bet chicken and spinach or mushrooms would be good too. Add anything you like and I bet it would be great! Amazing recipe :]

Delicious.  The cheese really makes this pasta, so I recommend getting good stuff (and adding more than suggested!).  Also, I added spinach and mushrooms for some veggies, but it's fantastic.  Obviously, must like garlic.

This is a great concept for any garlic lover but I found it was better if you just crack the garlic and let it simmer in the oil and then remove it before tossing w/ the pasta.  That way you don't keep biting into chunks of garlic but still get all the wonderful flavor.  I also agree that it needs for cheese than listed.

I thought the recipe was kind of dry. I substituted Romano cheese for Parmesan cheese and added a little bit of lemon juice to the end product. I tend to add lemon juice to everything so i thought it really added to the flavor. I also suggest adding a lot more cheese than the recipe calls for. Over all the dish packs a lot of flavor and was pretty tasty!

We enjoyed this recipe & plan to do lots of experimenting with it.  I added some tomatoes & used 1/3 cup olive oil.  We're going to try it with sun-dried tomatoes & more cheese!

Great, simple, quick side-dish recipe. I simply added cherry tomatoes for color and added flavor. I plan to experiment with less olive oil next time but on the whole; this is one recipe that I quickly added to my favorites folder using the iPhone AllRecipes app.

Loved it! I only used 7 cloves of garlic and that was plenty for us. I also added a tablespoon of dried parsley, & 1/2 tablespoon of dried basil. I wish I would not have used 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes since it was a little too spicy for us. I will definitely use less next time, and possibly add chicken. This was super easy to make and we loved it. Will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe since I had all the ingredients at home.  Neither my husband or I really cared for it.  There was way too much olive oil - the noodles were drowning in oil.  Also, there was not much flavor to it.

I really love this recipe as a side dish, with a protein , a smoked salmon , or a seasoned cut of meat, add a blanched " veggie ", and kick up spice, a bit , Use a white wine and butter seasoning on the vegetables, broccoli , etc, some thing green, " when I've made it the past or something similar, used more pasta for faint at heart. dave...

Alright, I haven't grocery shopped in a while, so I needed something to make where I had the ingredients on hand. This dish was perfect. I used dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh, seashell pasta instead of penne, and I didn't have the cheese, so my pasta was  naked. But the end result was perfect. I will definitely be making this again (with cheese and probably a meat product, too). Thank you!

I made this with whole wheat penne and folded in a few handfuls of fresh spinach to the cooked pasta. Very yummy! Next time though I will use black pepper instead of red pepper flakes.

This was really good. Just the garlic kick i needed. I chopped up and added some bacon and sauteed the garlic in the grease. I also added a little bit of minced onion and cayenne pepper.

I love this "simply" wonderful dish. It's so quick easy and I love to add different things to change it up to whatever I have on hand. I especially like to saute chopped red peppers, mushrooms, zucchini and top with a handful of chopped fresh tomatoes for a healthy vegetarian dish.

As a base recipe this is great but it's better when you add shrimp, red peppers and mushrooms.

Awesome!! I've been searching for years for a recipe like this--it was a favorite dish of my husband's at a local (now closed) restaurant. I've been trying to re-create it with little success, until I found this recipe. This is fabulous! The only change I made was 1 extra clove of garlic (like it was noticed) and I used a little less red pepper than it called for. Fantastic!

Yum, very tasty. I scaled it for 1 and added sun-dried tomatoes. Accidently left out the parsley but I don't think it changed much. Very good!

A good dish to make when you're out of everything else!  My cupboards were bare except for some dry staples. Using bottled minced garlic, dried parsley, and whole wheat pasta, I whipped this up in no time. If you don't like spicy, reduce the red pepper flakes in half.  My personal preference would be for less romano and more garlic, too.

This recipe is so amazing! My mom and I are huge garlic fans, so we LOVE this dish. My dad isn't such a big fan of it when we put the full amount of garlic in it, though. Every time i make this, I leave out the crushed red pepper flakes because I think they might make the recipe too spicy. Also, if the 10 cloves of garlic is too much for you, try cutting it down to 7 cloves.

Definitely death by garlic and what a great death it is!!!!!  Of course you can't kiss anyone who isn't eating this dish too for at least two days afterwards but oh so worth it!!  I did add more olive oil but that's a taste issue!

This recipe is for (real garlic lovers), and I am one!!!!. I used about 10 to 15 large cloves that I chopped really well using my chopper. While the garlic and extra virgin olive oil  are cooking I add fresh green beans, cooking only maybe 4 min or so, then I add 1/2 pound of fresh med 21 to 30 count shrimp cook until shrimp turn pink, then I toss with my pasta and cheese I use a romano and parma blend. I top my plated dish with cheese and fresh ground pepper. I omit the crushed red pepper and parsley sometimes. This is a very very good pasta dish, but beware if you do not like garlic. 5 plus stars!!!!!!.

This pasta wasn't anything memorable.  The only change we made was to throw in some spicy chicken sausage.  This was suprisingly not as garlicky as expected.

My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE garlic, but this didn't work that well for us.  The pasta was a bit dry.  It needs other liquid because the pasta started to stick together very soon after serving.

Yummy! Very garlicy. I didn't actually measure anything, just did it by eye. I found out after I was already getting everything together that I was out of olive oil, so I just used some butter instead. (not nearly as much as the recipe called for in OO though) I served it with the Feta and Bacon Pasta Sauce from this web site. Good stuff!

good, simple pasta dish.  I didn't think it was THAT garlic-y, but then again I love garlic!!  I added extra crushed red pepper flakes due to personal taste preference.

THIS WAS SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!! My husband and I really enjoyed this. Our 15 yr. old son thought it was just a little to much garlic, but that didn't stop him from taking seconds. We made it with the kelbasa and feta and the Romano cheese. We'll have this again!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

A BIG hit at my house!  We didn't think there was too much garlic.  However, we did use only half the olive oil, and it was fine!  A keeper for sure!  It is fantastic!

Great if you really love garlic.  I used slightly less oil, and next time I will use nine cloves.

It would be wrong to complain that this has a VERY heavy garlic taste.  I love garlic and this was almost too much for me.  (Of course, I might have been confused by what was meant by a "clove".)
