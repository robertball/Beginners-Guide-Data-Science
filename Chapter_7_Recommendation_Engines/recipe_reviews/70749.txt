My grandparents came from Mexico and I grew up eating this dish. I prefer the ratio of 1 egg to 1 tortilla. I first cut the tortilla into thin strips about 2" long by 1/2 inch thick and fry the tortillas until they are crisp all the way through. Remove from pan, lightly salt and drain on paper towel. Then I add chopped onion and saute until soft, add the beaten eggs that have been lightly seasoned with garlic salt, then spread the fried tortilla strips over the eggs. You can now add salsa if you like or not. Once the eggs are set on the bottom, flip the eggs over small sections and cook until done. The tortilla strips should be softened and give the eggs an almost "meaty" taste. You may garnish with shredded cheese, sour cream and avacado slices. For meat-eaters you can add crumbled bacon as a garnish. Migas are a 5 star recipe and everybody that eats them, loves them.

My best friend is Mexican and taught me how to make Migas.  As we were cooking the tortillas, we decided to throw in some other things I had on hand...We ended up adding fresh pico de gallo, sliced jalapenos, shredded cheese, and cumin, which is a MUST for this dish.  

We then took flour tortillas, spread a layer of refried beans, added a serving of the migas, topped with hot sauce and sliced avocado, and rolled the tortilla into a breakfast burrito.  SO GOOD! This is one of my favorite meals to make. Everyone loves it!

I have been making something like this for a few years now after having eaten it in Mexico when I lived there. Now my children even love it! An addition I can suggest is to add salsa (any heat you desire)or a green tomatillo salsa to the pan after the eggs have set up. You can also sprinkle shredded cheese (your favorite or a good Manchego)to the top of everything OR serve it as is with a side of black beans and sliced avocado. Makes for a hearty brunch. Delicious!

I grew up eating this dish as well. I don't know if it was because my Mexican father taught my mother to make it (and she revised it), but we always added diced tomatoes and green chile salsa. This has always been a favorite of mine, and traditionally, it is a way of using old, partly dried corn tortillas.

Great starter recipe!  I sauteed around 1/4 cup of chopped onions in butter until soft before adding the torn tortillas.  It was very tasty.  Even my children, who usually don't care for eggs, enjoyed this dish. Make sure that you allow the tortillas to crisp around the edges (you may need to add a bit more oil for this to happen) as it makes all the difference in the world in the end product.

I loved the idea of this recipe, but didn't have any corn tortillas on hand.  I did have corn chips, though, so I crushed them into the beaten eggs and then scrambled it all together.  Delicious!

I prefer a 1:1 egg tortilla ratio and half butter half evoo.  I like to add red bell for color and diced (already cooked) potatoes. Zip thru tortillas with pizza cutter.

My Mexican sister in law just made this for us this past week and I also had it in a Mexican restaurant in Texas! It is so good! She prefers to fry the tortilla's until they are crispy. Drains them and then adds the eggs and garlic salt. It was so good!!The garlic salt gives it a wonderful flavor along with the tortilla's. It would be great with queso cheese on top!
The restaurent made the softer version and I liked hers much better. I loved the crunchier texture. She treated us with some wonderful Mexican food and taught me how to make a lot of dishes! So happy to have her in our family!

Loved the taste of the fried corn tortillas with the egg!  The great thing about this recipe is you can add as much or as little extra flavor as you want..I was making this as a light supper so added tomato and cilantro.

my big guy said to me this morning i want eggs and ripped up tortillas mixed in so i asked on the AR recipe exchange and cindy lepp found this. i was making it for one but needed 3 breakfasts ( 2 kids + the big guy) and heres how i did it.. it came out well. we had bacon so to cut down on dishes i fried my bacon removed it then tore the tortillas haphazardly into the pan let them fry a little and took them out.. salted them. then i added beaten eggs and when they were done i took the kiddos portion out and added the tortillas back into the eggs and stirred it up and then topped with cheese. it was a hit! i think cooking the tortillas and eggs in bacon grease added some flavor and i did add some fresh cracked black pepper on top. really really easy and it looked pretty too. i will make this again. the big guy topped them with tobasco as he does everything and he was well impressed.

This was okay but we thought that the tortillas really dominated the flavor.  We really couldn't taste anything else.  I added a fresh salsa and bacon to give some more flavor.  Thanks for posting.

I had never heard of this, but seen a recipe on the back of my corn tortilla bag. I did 1:1 ratio as another reviewer mentioned with 2 eggs and 2 tortillas. The tortillas smelled so good when browning. Only thing is the eggs cook up quick making them dry. So, next time I will turn the tortillas down to low, before they are completely finished, to add the eggs to. I think it would be good with a little salsa verde or tomato salsa. I didn't have either, but I did top it with some chopped tomato, for some added color and flavor. ty

My siblings all really liked this. For some reason I couldn't get the tortillas crispy enough though. Next time I think I will just use tortilla chips. The only changes I made were to add some potatoes and taco seasoning. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe!! I will be making it again!!:)

This is a fairly common breakfast dish here in south Texas.  I've eaten it many times but never knew how to make it.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is easy to tailor this dish to your whims (and what's in the 'fridge)!  Sauteed onions, picante sauce, grated cheese, crisp bacon, diced ham, etc.  Yum!

Great recipe.  My mother used to make these for me a lot.  It's up to you how crunchy you want your tortilla, using oil or cooking longer.  I put in some salt with my corn tortilla as it is browning.  Sometimes the egg will make the tortilla go soft so you can always semi cook the egg before hand and toss in your crunchy tortilla with it.  Definitely salt and season to taste!   **This is a highly customizable dish! Put ham, tomatoes, chilli, peppers, onions, or anything else you want!

Everyone loved it, even my ultra picky 2 1/2 yr old.  I think I had 7 tortillas and 8 eggs though.  Added mexican season salt to eggs while cooking and added shredded sharp cheddar after making the plates.  At the table I added hot sauce to mine and my husbands.  I think the recipe is just a starter, you can add whatever you want!  I will be making this again!

I'd never heard of migas until two weeks ago and had never eaten them until last night, so I have no idea how they are supposed to taste.  I also didn't have any corn tortillas, so this variation is far from authentic.  I sauteed 1/4 cup of chopped onions in the oil until soft and then tossed in some broken tortilla chips and sauteed them, too.  Then I added the beaten eggs (with garlic salt and pepper) and soft-scrambled them until almost done.  I tossed in half a can of rotel tomatoes (drained) and some shredded cheese when the eggs were nearly done.  It was hearty, satisfying and delicious without being too spicy for me (although my husband would have added the rest of the rotel tomatoes).  This recipe is like an omelet -- you can add whatever ingredients and seasonings you want -- but the addition of the tortillas (or tortilla chips) makes it a heartier meal.

Didn't have corn tortillas and also didn't feel like frying anything, so I used tortilla chips like someone else suggested (Julio's seasoned tortilla chips).  Added sauteed onions, seasoned eggs with garlic powder and sea salt, topped with avocado, and paired with a mimosa :)  Husband and I both loved them.

I rate this one star as I agree with NOSOYOSO.  I am 80 yrs old of Spanish decent and have eaten Migas all my life and it is made from stale, or day old bread.    It is a delicacy and served with fried 'grunion', AKA 'smelt'.  During grunion season my dad would go over to the beach north of Santa Cruz, CA, on a Friday night & net the 'grunion'.  Grunion only run at a certain time of the year, and during the full moon & netted near midnight.  This, then, would be our Sat, or Sunday treat. Definitley made with olive oil, some garlic, and fried bread.  YUMMO!!  May try making this tomorrow, and sub shrimp for the grunion.

I never knew this was called Migas... however, I've been having Tortillas and Eggs for as long as I can remember.  We fry up some bacon, then in the bacon fat, we fry up the corn tortillas (torn up) and then once crispy, we put the eggs in, cook til done, then add the bacon, top with sour cream and salsa.  YUM!  Sooooo good.

I always fry the corn tortilla pieces crispier, sprinkled with dry spices like chile(cayenne or chipotle), garlic, and cumin. Push the pieces to one side of the pan and then add the beaten eggs to the open side, cook til almost done and then mix together with tortilla pieces. Love adding any leftover meats including chicken, taco meat, or chorizo. Diced fresh onion, cilantro, tomato, jalapeno tossed on finished dish adds more flavor and crunch. Also try fresh veggies like corn off the cob or zucchini to 'stir-fry' right in wonderfully.   Have some just waiting for my skillet...

I add fresh jalapenos, tomatoes and onion.  I'm not a tomato fan, so I leave them out.  You should saute' one jalapeno  and 1/4 cup onions before adding in the eggs.  (I remove seeds and inner membrane of the jalapeno for less heat.) I add a pat of butter once everything is combined. Great on a warm flour tortilla with fresh avocado or serve burrito style.

Yum!! I used the comments by KitchenDiva for ratio of ingredients and method. I made it with two eggs just for myself. Can't wait to make it again on the weekend for the husband. Thanks!

I made mine with potatoes and crumbled sausage.  I added the (par-boiled and large diced) potatoes just after browning the veggies and added the pre-cooked sausage at the very end.  this was delicious, but not as good as our mexican cook makes at work.  I'm too much of a white girl, I think.  It really was delightful but just not the same.  I think I may measure too accurately.

This was AWESOME with just simple ingredients. I fried up some onion and then tortilla, then added the eggs to that. It has soooo much potential for all sorts of ingredients as well. My husband LOVED it and he's not really big on stuff in his eggs. Definitely a keeper.

I don't normally like eggs, but this is the ONLY way I can eat them now! The tortillas add a heartiness and great texture and flavor. I usually add pico de gallo and hot sauce as well.

This was awesome!  I made it as directed; I wanted to try the flavor of the dish before altering it.  It does taste really authentic.  I ate mine plain and my boyfriend added hot sauce (he adds it to everything he eats) to his.  I will make this again either with some salsa or a can of Mexicorn.  This was a delicious, quick breakfast!

I was looking for something different for breakfast and this is great.  I didn't have corn oil, used canola. I cut the recipe in half and as others had suggested, I added a heaping tablespoon of hot picante sauce and topped with diced tomatoes.  Without the sauce, it would have been bland to this Texans taste.

I served this with Pace medium taco sauce....Mmmmm. This would have been even better with chorizo or cubed potato as well. Very economical, very tasty, authentic Tex Mex breakfast favorite. These are a regular on our breakfast table. Great for using up broken tortilla chips too.

This is incredibly easy -- I followed the recipe exactly although it would be easy to add just about anything (salsa, cheese, mushrooms, onions, etc.)  My kids really liked it--quick, easy meal when you are pressed for time.

I always like salsa on mine, but as I said in the comments my husband prefers it with just salt.  Sometimes they turn out better if I put the eggs in a seperate bowl first, whisk them with the salt and then pour them over the tortilla's that are starting to get crisp.  When I make them for my parents up at the cabin they like me to add onions, peppers, and ham.  It's a very flexible recipe.  I hope all continue to enjoy it.

Very nice.  As per the suggestions, I used 1 tortilla per egg and ensured that I fried the tortillas until just starting to crisp.  Served it with grated cheese and salsa.  Will certainly add this to my regular breakfast offerings.

We grew up eating Migas. We’d sometimes eat just plain migas but sometimes we’d add fried potatoes, or chorizo, or diced ham. Always lots of onion. Great breakfast.

We added some pickled jalapenos and carrots. I liked this version where the tortillas are torn. Most recipes I’ve seen say to cut them into strips. These were easier to cook and eat. Thank you for the recipe.

I sauteed one chopped jalapeno with half of a yellow onion in two teaspoons of corn oil with a little butter in a separate pan. I only used 9 yellow corn tortillas. I added a few dashes of cumin to 6 large eggs and whisked together. I added the eggs in the pantry with the extra crispy tortilla strips , I spread the onion and jalapeno on top then I added 1 diced Roma tomato. I let the eggs set before I flipped sections. I then sprinkler quesadilla cheese on top and mixed in. At the end I sprinkled chopped cilantro on it and removed from pan.

This is a nice basic recipe, but you have to decrease the amount of tortillas and add more seasonings and veggies to make it a super tasty dish.  My husband and 1 year old ate it up! (After adding some cumin, garlic, onion, and salsa.  I only used 6 tortillas and that was plenty.)

Excellent recipe! I used 4 tortillas and 2 eggs since I was just cooking for myself. I like the ratio because it doesn't taste super-eggy. I fried in coconut oil and added a little cumin and black pepper when I put the eggs in. I can definitely see myself making these a lot!

Pretty good! After reading the comments here I added some sauteed onions and green peppers to the eggs/tortillas. I used 8 tortillas and 10 eggs (big eaters!) and half the Taco Seasoning I recipe found at this site. Added some fresh cilantro and topped with cheese (salsa and sour cream on the side). I think next time I will use the entire Taco Seasoning I in this dish but otherwise, this was very tasty and there are even some leftovers! I served this with black beans (seasoned with the other half of the taco seasoning recipe and extra garlic) and corn.

I really love this but add salt and pepper. I think the ratio of tortillas to eggs is off so I reduced the number. 1 egg : 1 tortilla. It works for us and then it's  not like I'm eating a bunch of tortillas. We topped ours with a little cheese, salsa on the side and sour cream.

This was a great "gateway" recipe giving you the ability to make it your own. I sprinkled the tortillas with garlic salt when i removed them from the oil and, like another person noted, added a little more garlic salt and cumin to the eggs for a little more flavor. I also sauteed onions, green Chiles and topped with a little cheddar, crisp bacon and sliced avocado. Kids and husband loved it. Next time, I'm getting rid of stale corn chips to speed it up and see if it changes the taste. 
This would be an awesome casserole to freeze and eat later or bring to a brunch.

Comfort food at its best!  I needed some way to cook eggs for brunch that was a little different and found this recipe.  Coincidently, I had corn tortillas that were getting stale.  I used 2 tortillas for each 3 eggs and since I was using up leftovers, I chopped up some pepperjack cheese that was getting old.  My eggs got such rave reviews I was embarassed by the ease of preparation.  Thank you!

WOW nice to see this recipe on here.  I really didn't think it was a recipe.  My abuela just tore apart some corn tortillas, beat some eggs and threw it all in a pan of hot oil.  Man oh man it was the best.  I still make it but not as good as my abuela.  I make mine just like this recipe but with fewer eggs, a sprinkle of pepper and top it off with El Pato sauce.  Great comfort food!

Yummy.  I made the mistake of cutting all of my tortillas in one stack and found that when I dumped them in the pan they stuck together. =/ no fault of the recipe.  Gave 4 stars because it's absolutely bland unless you add a can of rotel or something, anything...

I use 1 egg to 1 tortilla as well -- 2 to 1 seems like to much, even for us. 
After cooking we use a hot sauce- El Pato Sauce it comes in a little yellow can-- most likely in your ethnic isle in your grocery store, or any where if your in AZ -- Its really good, I hope you love it as much as we do!!

I learned to make these 32 yrs ago from a Mexican friend who grew up in Texas. She used flour tortillas about 2 for 4 eggs torn into small pieces about 1 to 2 inches fried in butter until crispy then poured in eggs whipped with a little milk or cream. I make them for my AZ/New Mexico (Spanish family since the late 1400's) husband who had never had them. He loves them just the way I learned to make them.

Love it! Great way to use up leftover corn tortillas. Added sausage crumbles and cheese that was in the fridge. Will definitely make it again.

I added onions, garlic, red peppers and cheese.  It was a very filling meal served with breakfast meat and whole wheat toast.  All that egg and tortilla needs some extra seasoning so salt and a mixed seasoning/herb mixture was a great addition.

tear tortillas really small, try to really fry them in hot oil, use only 1 tortilla per egg. definitely needs something else like cheese/salsa/avocado/etc.

Like some of the other reviewers said, it is a great "base" recipe, but personal additions do make the dish.  :)  I added about 2 tablespoons of chunky salsa & a little leftover queso from a previous meal.  And I agree, the cumin is a must.  ;)  Excellent and so authentic.  Reminds me of my days living with a Mexican family, when I spent a summer in Mexico during college.  Authentic & delicious!  ENJOY!

I've never had Migas before, but as written this would have been way too tortilla*y for me. I was only cooking for one so I used 2 eggs. Started to put in 4 tortillas then realized it seemed like way to many for just 2 eggs. Started taking some out. I wish I had just used 1. Easy to make &  a quick meal. I used quite a bit of fresh garlic & pepper. Serve with a dollop of homemade salsa on top.

I make this for my kids at least once a week. I reduce the oil slightly to keep it healthier.  This is a great recipe for families on a budget, and it's easy for the kids to add salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese, etc per thier own tastes.

My husband can't get enough of this! I prefer it with chunky salsa on top, but he likes it plain.  I can't believe I had never even heard of this before - old tortillas will never go to waste again.

Tasty and quick. Great for using up leftover tortillas, and good for an easy by yourself lunch. Used corn toritillas with jalpenos, as that's what needed to be used up. Thanks for the great idea!

Yum!  Thanks for this great idea.  I've never had migas before, but this recipe was so quick, easy, and delicious!  Since it was just for me, I used two eggs and two corn tortillas.  I also added black pepper, cayenne, tomatoes, and spinach.  The veggies probably made it less authentic, but for me it was the perfect addition.  I was surprised that this was so tasty without onions or garlic.  The fried tortillas really add something special.  Can't wait to make this again for my family!

Excellent!  Once the eggs set, we added 1/2 sweet yellow onion, chopped & sauteed + 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and green chiles, drained; and we sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top when done!

I Make this all the time... You can also boil 5 tomatos and some chilies and onion, then put them in the blender with 2 or 3 cups of water (depends on how much tortillas your making) and them poor it over the tortillas( make sure the salsa is REALLY hot or else it will not be good)...It needs to look almost like soup.. then simmer untill the tortillas soke up all the salsa.

Nice spin on scrambled eggs!  We enjoyed it for Cinco de Mayo  brunch.  I only used 4 tortillas for 6 eggs because we're curbing the carbs, and I'll probably use 3 next time.

Oh childhood memories! I like more tortillas than egg. I sauté some onions before adding the egg, add a splash of Enchilada sauce while cooking, and grate smoked Gouda on top when nearly done.  Smoked Gouda has a bacon-y taste to it without the bacon!  Top with a bit of ketchup, avocado and sour cream or Labne. Dish really hit the spot this morning.

This recipe followed exactly is pretty bland.  If you add cheese and hot sauce its pretty good.

I grew up in Mexico City and the Migas that we had are made with bread. This was back in the 50's and what I see described here looks more like Chilaquiles.   It this recipe correct or is a different regional dish. It looks fine, but is not the Migas that I grew up with.

Quick and easy breakfast. Some of my favorite additions are left over carne asada or pork carnitas; onions; jalapenos; cilantro and garlic; and of course cheese on top. It really depends on your mood and what's in the kitchen

I'm always surprised by how great this tastes considering it doesn't look all that appetizing. I usually serve it with sauted diced ham or sausage on the side for family members who *must* have meat with their eggs, because mixing anything in while cooking tends to make it watery. Also, I've used this recipe with flour tortillas (my mistake on what was in the fridge) and although not quite as good as with corn tortillas, it's still pretty good.

This dish is delicious with salsa and sour cream on top.  Any of the sides recommended by other reviews would probably be great as well.   Without toppings/sides, the recipe would be a little bland.

This is so good and so fast! I like that the recipe is a basic method. I added a little ground cumin and red chili powder.   This recipe is perfect for those times when you don't really want to cook, but still want something yummy.

I loved this recipe because it reminded me of a dish my mother would make when I was little. However, my husband wasn't all that impressed- he thought it was too greasy. I'll make it again with less oil and more topping options.

I've been using up old tortillas this way for years.  I make it just like recipe, no additions.  My whole family eats these eggs covered in hot sauce, even my 4 year old.

This was really good to be so simple.  I added just a little chopped onion (wish I had added more)when cooking the tortillas.  I also scrambled the eggs before putting them in the pan and added a couple of dashes of hot sauce to them.  Served them with a spinkle of grated cheese and more hot sauce.  My husband really enjoyed them.  Next time I'll experiment with a few other items.  Maybe some bell pepper, more onions, sausage or chorizo.

I made this for breakfast this morning and it was great!  I added a little dollop of sour cream and lots of salsa.  Next time I think I'll try adding some green chili peppers.  Thanks for the recipe.
