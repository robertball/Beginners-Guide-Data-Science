This is GREAT punch!  I had to make an extra batch; the first one was gone within minutes!  I substituted ginger ale for the carbonated water.  I used 3 liters; two I just poured in, but the other I froze into little plastic cups the night before and then crunched them up right before I put them in the bunch bowl.  Everyone loved it!  I will be using this recipe again!

I made this punch for a friends bridal shower, didn't change a thing. Was pretty good, I think next time I will maybe switch the ratio of the orange juice and lemonade, I'm a huge fan of lemonade.  Was even better with the Raspberry Stoli added!

Served this punch at my daughter's baby shower and everyone loved it.  No one even drank the soda I had available.  I made three batches and froze extra carbonated water the night before in plastic cups to add as ice in order not to dilute it with water.
