I made this by the recipe last week. My husband thought it was great, and I enjoyed it also, but thought I'd like it better with a few changes. I made it today for a baby shower at work. It got lots of oohs and ahhs and recipe requests. I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and used heavy cream instead of milk, chopped the onions instead of slicing -(when sliced, the long strings/rings can make it tricky to slice/serve/eat). I also cooked the onions until they were very browned and carmelized. 
My additional changes: 2 cups of colby/jac cheese, and one cup of freshly grated parmesean, 8 tsp of chopped fresh basil instead of 2 tsp dried. I did not peel the tomatoes this time, and before I sliced them, I cut the top off, and "squeezed " most of the seeds/juice out. I sprinkled with italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of four. I added a little garlic powder along with salt and pepper to the egg mixture. I baked 10 min at 400, then 35 min at 350. It will slice beautifully if you allow it to set for an hour or longer after it finishes baking. Garnish with a few fresh basil leaves. Delicious and pretty!

UBER YUMMY!! The floured, fried tomatoes were so good, I could have eaten a plate of them straight. However, once they're baked into the quiche, it's dubious how necessary the frying step is. By the time they're cooked in the quiche, their light, crispy exteriors have dissipated. So the time and mess used to fry them doesn't serve much useful purpose. To eliminate that step, simply place the peeled, sliced tomatoes on paper towels, sprinkle lightly with salt on both sides, then allow to sit undisturbed for at least 20 minutes to draw out the excess moisture, sprinkle liberally with basil, then add to the quiche as directed. Carmelizing the onions (sauteeing until a deep, golden color) eliminates the sharp, in-your-face taste that can overwhelm the delicate flavor of the tomatoes, and tames it down to make it a delectable "team player." You can vary the flavor of this quiche simply by using any cheeses, in any combination, that you happen to like. I used brie with rinds removed, Jarlsberg and Asiago. The flavor was sensational. Even using only skim milk, the taste was sumptuous, the texture ethereal. Most excellent!

Amazing!  I only made a couple changes to the recipe.  I used 2 cups of cheese (amount came in package) and after the quiche was in the oven for 10 minutes I sprinkled nutmeg on the top.  The flavor was great and I enjoyed everything about this recipe.  My only suggestion is to add some more olive oil prior to sauteeing the tomatoes because they tended to stick to the pan.  Great recipe and highly recommended.

This was great, but I did make a few changes. I diced the tomatoes rather than slicing them, and I did not peel them (I used sweet grape tomatoes). I also minced the onion instead of slicing it and added a few cloves of minced garlic. It turned out great. I served it at a bridal shower, and everyone loved it!

GREAT! What a great quiche! I added another 1T of oil to saute the floured tomatoes after removing the onions - there was nothing left in the pan and they started to stick. I used oat flour (I'm wheat intolerant) and you simply can't detect it. I doubled the flour-basil mix and dredged each tomato slice, fully coating it. After trying to turn them over, they fell a part, which was okay - made it easier to get into the quiche. (Next time I'll use diced tomatoes and shake the flour-basil mix with the tomatoes in a bag.) I used heavy cream for the milk portion, added 1cup diced cooked chicken to the onions, and doubled the amount of cheese (what can I say - we LOVE cheese!). I wrapped the crust edge with foil to prevent harsh browning, and sprinkled the top of the quiche with nutmeg before baking. I cooked the whole thing at 350 and let it bake for 40 minutes because I had to tend to some other things. This was simply fantastic! I also made some in a custard cup (sprayed with PAM) so it was crust-less for me! It slippped right out of the cup and looked very nice! Served with a side salad! EXCELLENT!

It was divine and easy to make.  The changes I made were as follow:  I used half skim milk and half heavy cream, added mushrooms to the onion and sauteed them together, then sprinkled the flour over the tomatoes and basil, and sauteed THEM with the onions and mushrooms. The smell was luscious and I added a dash more olive oil to make up for the flour drying out the pan.  I used a mixture of sharp cheddar and parmegiano-reggiano and used it sparingly on the bottom and top of the quiche. It smelled wonderful while baking and came out terrific.

So easy and yummy...except that I can't follow a recipe perfectly, so I removed the onions, added 1 cup chopped steamed spinach, and sauteed mushrooms, plus a tiny dash of nutmeg in the egg mixture....Excellent!

The intense flavor that the tomatoes get from the quick pan fry makes this dish sublime! My 17 month old little girl loved this!  Very kid friendly, just add a salad and you've got a great meal! ****Update!!  Forgot to pick up a store bought pie crust and used a puff pastry that I had in the freezer....man, you gotta try it!!  It is WONDERFUL!  I so love this recipe!

This quiche is great!  I added sauted mushrooms and used Mozzarella instead of Colby-Monterey Jack, just for kicks.  The texture of the quiche was good, but a bit oily.  Next time, I'll use fresh onions instead of the frying method.  The tomatoes were great, too!

Just made the quiche tonight... awesome. My wife said she like it, well I loved it... but I maybe biased. Instead of flour I used Italian bread crumbs we had in the cupboard; instead of dried basil I used fresh basil as suggested by others; and as usual I used half-n-half instead of milk. 

I would like to experiment with laying the last half of cheese and then topping it all off with the egg mixture or maybe putting the cheese in the egg mixture before transfering to the pie. I've never liked a cheese quiche's 'cheese layer'... I prefer quiche a tad more lorraine-ish.

Really a great recipe! I used ROMA tomatoes because they have less moisture, and they fried beautifully as well as kept the coating intact while baking nicely! I also kind of improvised a little - used half-n-half instead of milk, 4-cheese Mexican blend (shredded) instead of cheddar, and fresh basil instead of dried.

I didn't layer the ingredients, except I did put the onions on the bottom instead of the top. I mixed the cheese and egg mixture together before pouring on top of the onions, and put the tomatoes on the very top. Came out super-lovely! Everyone loved it...

DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

We really liked it.  My husband, who "doesn't eat vegetables" ate half the pan.  I even added some frozen spinach at the onion sautee step.  Oh, and I used shallots instead of onions because we were out.  I also didnt peel the tomatoes and it came out just fine, for anyone else who doesnt have time for tedium.  Very good and will definitely make again to use up the fresh tomatoes and basil (and shallots:) from the garden.

I enjoyed this recipe, but made a couple of changes.  First, I browned the onion, so they were carmelized rather than just soft as the recipe stated. I also had some extra swiss chard and beet greens around, so I sauteed them with the onion and added them both to the quiche. Finally, I only had mozzerella on hand for cheese and used that instead of the cheese suggested in the recipe.  I will make this again, but probably would not saute the tomatoes first in the flour mixture because they just had a pastey texture to them after being fried.

This is a great recipe you can make your own. I took others ideas and added fresh spinach, mushrooms, diced grape tomatoes and diced onion. I also added nutmeg as one reviewer suggested and it was divine. I also like that this recipe wasn't too eggy.

Very good, and very easy.  The onions are sweet, which offsets the basil taste.  I used both black and red pepper, about 1/8 t of each, for just enough zip.  Since basil isn't my favorite, I think next time I might try different herbs.

I used this recipe as a "starting off" point so I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I imagine if I'd followed the recipe exactly it would have been pretty bland/boring. I didn't pre-fry my tomatoes and instead of sliced tomatoes I diced them up into chunks, I also diced the onion instead of slicing. I used lots of fresh basil in place of the dried and added some salt, black pepper, garlic and thyme. Instead of colby jack cheese I lined the bottom of the quiche with brie and on the top I used fresh grated parmesan. This got A LOT of compliments at the pot luck I brought it to!

Fabulous!  I added a little minced garlic and a handful of chopped mushrooms.  Also, chopped the tomatoes.  Served for dinner with sauteed broccoli and oven-toasted English muffins with butter and Parmesan.

I made these with sundried tomatoes (8 of them). It wasn't bad but I felt it was lacking flavor a little. I like the spinach quiche recipe on here better.

I love this recipe! I have made it for church potlucks and never bring any home. :)  Although, I do have to say I never peeled or chopped the tomatoes. I bought a small can (10 oz) of diced tomatoes. Sometimes I get the ones with the flavoring already on them. Also, I have added sausage to the recipe. That adds a nice flavor.

I first made this recipe about 7 years ago, when I discovered this site, and I've made it soooo many times since then... it's still one of my star recipes!!! I use whatever cheese I can get (it's not common to get monterey jack here in ecuador) and bake my own crust, but other than that, I follow the exact recipe... I just love it! best quiche ever!!

This is quite good. I only made a couple of changes based on previous reviews. I chopped the onions very fine and caramelized them. I replaced the milk w/ heavy cream. I used a full package of cheese (2 cups). Instead of frying the tomatoes, I lightly salted them and let them set on paper towel for approximately 20 minutes to remove the water before adding to the quiche. Very good for breakfast or would be excellent for a light lunch as well.

I only used this recipe as a base for a quiche and added spinach, mushrooms, onions and sundried tomato garlic paste. The proportions in this base make a perfectly consistent quiche- not too eggy but just enough to hold the tasty stuff together.

So delicious.  My mom keeps asking me to make this!  I add a little fresh garlic to the onions and I think fresh basil is better.  Great for breakfast. Yummy.

Absolutely amazing! Probably the best quiche I've ever tasted. I only made two changes: 1) added some chopped green pepper to the (chopped) onion saute, and 2) juiced the tomatoes before dredging them in bread crumbs with italian seasoning. I've already eaten this twice today, and I keep wanting to go back for another helping!

I made this yesterday. It made a pretty good meal , served with a salad. The only changes in ingredients was using italian style bread cumbs instead of flour and use fraish basil, a handful of it. I needed to cook it for 10 minutes at 400 and 30 minutes at 350.

Chopped up the tomato. Had to add another egg and a little milk to make it fill the dish. Turned out fairly well.

so good! my husband and i ate the entire quiche in less than two days.  I would recommend allowing cooling time so the pie can set and will not be runny.  Even better the second day!

I was asked to make a quiche for a co-workers birthday breakfast.  One requirement - I had to make sure the quiche was meat-less (lots of vegetarians at my work).  Having never actually made a quiche before, I searched through the All-recipes database.  And this Tomato/Basil Quiche did not disappoint.  I did adjust the recipe somewhat...I used fresh and dried basil, half-n-half, and added another egg. I also used freshly grated parmesan and a blend of cheddar and colby and mixed that in with the egg/cream batter before pouring into the pieshell. I also chopped the onions as suggested and used Roma tomatoes so that they were firm enough to handle the frying.  I think next time I would probably use a little less onion and would cut the tomatoes a bit thin.  I also don't know if I would do the flouring of the tomatoes.  It just seemed like an extra step that could be removed if you are crunched for time.   Just mix the basil in with the eggs and cheese and you'll be good to go.  Also - I have an old gas stove so I cooked at 400 for 10 mins and 30 at 350.  Came out perfect and tasted so delicious reheated the next morning.

Drooool! This was divine. I took the suggestions of other users: Tomatoes, diced, not peeled, and with the seeds & juicy parts removed; onions minced; basil fresh; heavy cream instead of milk. I didn't bother with flour at all, and I used medium cheddar for the cheese, because that's what I had. The cooking time in the recipe was perfect for me. I let the quiche sit 15-20 minutes before slicing.

Some of my family loved it and some thought it was just okay. Personally, I did not enjoy the separation of the  vegetables and the egg. I like quiche where they are mixed together better.

WOW! First quiche i have ever made and it turned out great. I added about a half pound of sausage to the recipe and mixed in with the onion. Plus, I didn't have tomatoes, so I had to use stewed tomatoes - just drained them really well. It took about 5 minutes longer to cook with these changes and I would recommend adding more basil with the meat. It's a great, easy recipe.

I made this because I was using up pie shells... it turned out really well, I used grape tomatoes, because that's what I had in the fridge. It was really easy and tasty, will make again, it would be great for parties etc, and in small individual pie shells too.

This was incredible! My husband and I couldn't stop eating it. I did make a few suggested changes after reading other reviews. I used a garlic flavored olive oil to sautee onions until very soft. I diced the tomatoes and sprinkle with flavored bread crumbs before frying for a coulpe of minutes using a tuscan flavored olive oil. I also used fresh basil and 1 cup colby cheese and 1 cup monterey jack cheese. This is by-far, the best quiche recipe ever!

This is an excellent quiche!  I made it with heirloom tomatoes and a mixture of cheeses for the first time today!  What they say about men don't eat quiche was totally disavowed by my husband's eating of two very large servings!

I made this for my book club and everyone loved it. Like others I made a few minor modifications. Used 1 tsp minced garlic with the onion which I diced. Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and a mixture of fresh and dried basil I also sprinkled fresh basil on the top before baking. I found the timing on the recipe to be perfect. All in all, really enjoyed this recipe!

This is my favorite quiche of all time.  I make this frequently (1x per month) and it always has people asking me for the recipe.  I have mixed it up a little bit and added bacon or sausage also and it is good regardless.  I prefer to use swiss cheese and a little asagio, but any cheese works.

This was DELICIOUS! I loved it, and so did the kids. Even my toddler who doesn't like eggs happily ate it up. The only thing i did different was to add some turkey bacon. Thanks for this recipe, I will make it again!

Excellent! I was having a hard time finding a lot of reviews that followed the recipe completely, so I decided to do so myself to see what would happen. :) Unfortunately, my deep dish pie pan must be deeper than a purchased deep dish pie crust pan (I used Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site in my own pan), and I had to add more egg mixture and cheese to this. As a result, my tomatoes "sunk" a little after adding the extra cheese and egg. Still, the finished quiche was delicious. This sets up perfectly - not overly juicy/watery like a lot of tomato quiche can be. I'm sure it works as written with a purchased pie crust just beautifully. I enjoyed mine, too. Thanks!

Excellent flavor, although it could have used more seasoning, like others have said. I used cheddar instead of the recommended cheese as it's what I had on hand. I followed some other suggestions such as a bit more olive oil, some garlic powder and a little rosemary as well. In all, a solid four stars. Goes excellently with a peach schnapps cocktail.

AMAZING! I am usually one to make a lot of changes to recipes.  This one, I only made a few minor changes, but they weren't even necessary. I didn' peel the tomatoes & I added about 10 chopped sun dried tomatoes too.  Otherwise, I made as is and myself and my boyfriend couldn't get enough!  If I had fresh basil, that would probably be a good change too! Easy and delish!

This was SO good!  I made it with canned diced tomatoes (skipped the frying step), mixed the flour in with the cheese (so it wouldn't clump), diced the onion and added garlic to the saute, then mixed it all with the egg mmixture before putting in pie shells.  It was so easy and tastes great!

Very good quiche and pretty easy too. I too used fresh basil like others have and also added cubed pieces of roasted chicken which was good. Searing the tomatoes with flour and basil was something fun i've never had the chance to do before. This dish could easily work for breakfast, lunch, or supper.

A little bland, but a good basic recipe.  Will change the seasoning, perhaps the cheese to gruyere.

Fantastic!! Family loved this one....I followed other reviewers and sauteed the onion and a large clove of minced garlic in evoo, then added 5 small diced tomatoes(took out the juice and seeds), and added some Italian bread crumbs instead of the flour. I added 1c. fat free half and half to the 3 eggs, salt/pepper, some grated pecorino romano cheese, fresh chopped basil, and an Italian 3 cheese blend, added the tomato mixture and just poured the whole thing in the pie shell. It was so yummy. Will make again and maybe add some zucchini.

Very good!!  I made just a few changes to decrease fat/calories.  I used egg substitute, fat free milk, and reduced fat cheddar cheese.  I also added fresh basil and did not take off the skin from the tomatoes to save time.  Everyting turned out great and even my 6 year old was saying how much he liked this meal.  This will become a favorite of mine!  Thanks for sharing!

The quiche turned out lovely.  It looks beautiful, and smells and tastes delcious.  If your not a big basil fan you may not like this dish... but myself and my family loved it.  Very simple, for such an elegant dish.

My family loved this quiche!
I made a couple of changes because I had leftovers I wanted to use:
1/2 c chopped fresh basil leaves in place of dry basil,
1 can of whole tomatoes, drained and sliced(although I would use fresh next time),
1 link turkey italian sausage, casing removed and browned,
and shredded Mexican cheese.

Very good - not suprisingly - I made minor/major changes.  Sliced SUNDRIED tomatoes instead of fresh (eliminated the flour), chopped two cups of fresh spinach in place of basil.  Needed to cook an extra 10minutes.  Also used LACTAID milk for the intollerant among us.  Very flavorful - LOVED IT.  Had it for breakfast and again at lunch.

Followed the recipe except chopped onions and sautéed them until almost caramelized.  Used fresh basil and cheese I had on hand - Colby and cheddar.  Easy and savory - wonderful!!!  This is a keeper!

Excellent! Wonderful! I did add more cheese as a reviewer recommended. Since I couldn't find Colby at the supermarket, I added some cheddar but just a touch, maybe a quarter cup. I used 2 cups of cheese for the bottom and on the top probably 3/4 cup. I am not sure because what I did was cover the whole top with it. Even though I hate frying, I did fry the tomatoes. I believe that makes a difference. The fresh basil enhances all the flavors. When I poured the egg/milk mixture, I used a fork lightly to help it go even under the ingredients.  As a side dish, I made rice with EVO and a touch of garlic. All in all, an enjoyable meal.

Very good. Next time I will use fresh basil and cream and maybe add some fried bacon. The fried tomato slices were so good I just wanted to eat them plain with a little parmesan. Sooo good!

We loved this quiche. I have made tomato quiche for the first time and we were surprised how delicious it is. The fried tomatoes definitely give an extra kick. I made the quiche using Easy pie crust recipe from this site. Very good recipe, I will make again.

I wasn't blown away by this one - I guess I was expecting a bit more with such great reviews, but it was just average for me. I agree with another reviewer who said she enjoyed the spinach quiche from this site better - right with ya on that one!

My family just loved this and my husband has already requested a repeat some time soon. My rating is based on these few tweaks: Sauteed 1 minced clove of garlic w/ the onion, I chopped the tomatoes and did not peel; added fresh basil instead of dried to the egg/milk mixture, used Trader Joe's Lite Mexican cheese and added one more egg. Fantastic!

I REALLY ENJOYED THIS QUICHE. I USED A CAN OF DRAINED, DICED, TOMATOES THAT I SAUTED, WITH DRIED BASIL, I ALSO ADDED FRESH BASIL TO THE TOP OF THE BAKED QUICHE. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN. I USUALLY DO NOT LIKE ONIONS ALONE BUT IT ALL MIXES TOGETHER WHEN YOU EAT IT. MAKE SURE TO GET A DEEP DISH PIE CRUST OR THERE IS TOO MUCH EGG MIXTURE.

Very nice quiche.  Other than not peeling the tomatoes and leaving out the onions, I followed the recipe.  Very beautiful presentation, and tasty, too.  So simple as well.  I brought this to work for breakfast with my coworkers and it was a hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this dish. I'm a big fan of quiches/savoury pies that consist of throwing together by eye some vegetables, egg, milk, and cheese, so I wasn't sure if the extra steps would be worth it. Lo and behold, they totally were.

This was a GREAT recipe!  I had to double it for a party which was no problem.  I did as others had suggested by using heavy cream and nutmeg.  I also added minced sundried tomatoes, steamed asparagus, spinach, fresh basil and mushrooms.  I also chopped the onions and tomatoes as suggested.  I put sliced heirloom tomatoes on top for decoration.  I also sprayed my cake pan with olive oil and baked it without any crust.  I received many compliments and no quiche was left over after the party!  I will definitely be making this again for dinner very soon.

DELICIOUS!! My husband was less than excited about this meal when I told him what I was making but ended up going back for seconds, and even thirds!!!I also used the Italian bread crumbs on the tomatoes and added broccoli as well... sauteed with the onions and only 1tsp of basil instead of two. This was SO easy to prepare. Very excited to make again, it will be a regular dish in our rotation for sure!!!!

Delicious!  I used some sliced green onions and did not need to saute them.  My tomatoes were so ripe that I could not keep them in nice slices - they broke apart, but still so good.  I made it crustless.  I mixed the onions, cheese (Port du Salut and monterey jack), eggs, and fresh basil all together, then I layered the egg mixture alternatively with my tomato pieces.   Had to use cream instead of milk.  Very good!

Not very good.  It was pretty, and edible, but mostly just tasted like basil and it was really runny (even though I de-seeded the tomatoes).  Won't make this again.

This was easy, but for some reason I doidn't find it had  a whole lot of flavour. Perhaps I should make it again win the height of tomato season, where they will be the most flavourfull.

I was suprised at how good this was! Only used about 1/2 of the onion and 1 tomato and it was plenty.  Added deli ham pieces on top of veggies-super yummy and very easy to make

I soaked about 6 or 7 sun-dried tomatoes in boiled water for about 20 - 25 minutes, in place of the fresh tomatoes. Chopped them up and added the flour and basil (only 1 teaspoon of basil next time. Found the basil flavour a bit too strong) and sauteed them with the onions for a couple minutes. As well, I chopped up about 3/4 cup of broccoli to saute with the onions. I also replaced the Jack cheese with old cheddar, as I like a stronger cheese flavour. This was soooooooooo delicious. Extremely flavourful and tasty.

Absolutely delicious! I used cheddar cheese and added Romano Cheese to the top. I will be making this again for Easter brunch.

This was very good. I had some left over tomato basil pasta sauce and spread it on the bottom of the pie crust. I also added some spinach to it.... simply delicious!

This recipe is excellent. I added 2 rashers of diced cooked bacon with the layer of tomato and used cheedar cheese instead of the two cheese's listed as I was unable to find them in a supermarket. An excellent recipe that tastes great.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!! 
A true HIT with the family. I did change the recipe a bit. I used my own biscuit recipe for the pie shell, baked it for 10 minutes before adding the fillings. I diced my tomatoes instead of slicing them, used fresh basil and sauteed the floured tomatoes/basil mixture with salt, pepper and powdered garlic, until golden. I also added 1 cup of chopped premium smoked bacon, which I cooked after removing the tomato mixture from the frying pan. I used two cups of shredded cheese (1 cup mozarella + 1 cup Gouda)one cup for the bottom and another for the top (combined). And the last change I made is that I used plain creamy yogurt instead of the milk. I had to bake mine for 35 minutes for it to be ready, it looked amazing. I CAN´T WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN!!! THANKS SOOOO MUCH!!!

I have made this twice, and it was much loved by our family.  (The second time, I was able to keep a small section tomato-free for my young daughter who finds those less than appetizing.)

I used a refrigerated pie crust, and because of an abundance in the garden, we used mini roma tomatoes.  I didn't peel them, and after dipping them in the flour mixture and sauteeing them the first time, I tried without, and they still tasted very good.  Due to family likes and dislikes, I didn't use slices of onion, but I sauteed a large bunch of chopped chives (from the garden) with a small can of mushrooms.  And for cheese, we used cheddar and mozzerella, then I used chopped fresh basil sprinkled on the tomatoes.

I did make certain to salt and pepper generously, as per earlier reviews, and  I was very pleased with the final results.  This was a very flavorful quiche, and I will definitely make it again during our "fresh tomato season."

This recipe was just okay. I thought it lacked taste. I added more tomatoes and put salt on them but it still was so dull. I have tried alot better quiche recipes. I will NOT make this again!

This is probably the best recipe I have ever made from Allrecipes.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  I had a friend coming over for lunch today and wanted to make something light and wanted to use my Jersey tomatoes.  This was unbelievably delicious!  I did use fresh basil from my garden and I used swiss cheese instead of Monterey Jack because that is what I had on hand.  As another reviewer suggested...maybe cooking the tomatoes slightly in olive oil before adding to the quiche makes this superb...I don't know what the secret was.  All I know is that this tastes like something you would eat for brunch at an upscale restaurant.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe Karen.  I can't wait to make another one with my fresh garden tomatoes and freeze it and eat in in the middle of winter!

I think i used way more cheese than i was supposed to (i used eminthaler swiss and mozzerella) but it was very delicious! I also used fresh whole basil leaves instead of dried, which i think is a must.  I made my own pie crust rather than use frozen, which probably doens't make a difference i'd just rather make than buy! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! It's pretty simple but does look and taste elaborate. You could try "spicing" it up a bit by adding some italian sausage or ham to it if you prefer it with meat.

I love this recipe. I did make a change, though. I used Roma tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes. The quiche was a little runny and I blame that on the roma's. I will try again with regular tomatoes and I am sure it will be great. I love the flavors of this quiche. It's a great meatless meal that is very satisfying.

I made it without a crust. First I sprayed the pan with cooking oil, then put in a layer of Parmesan....maybe half cup. It put more Parmesan in after the tomatoes and covered the whole thing with grated cheese.

This was excellent.  I did make a couple of changes, and they were the same as a few others.  I used heavy cream as I had that on hand, and I used dried basil for the flour mixture, but then used fresh basil from my garden and cut it up into the cream mixture as well as putting some over the top of the cheese before baking.  And I also cut the onions a bit as it is hard to eat rings of onions.  I used a combination of Muenster and Swiss and it was delicious.  My wife wants me to make it again!  This is a definite keeper.  I would double the custard ingredients as it didn't really fill the deep dish crust, but that's just a suggestion.  The combination of onions, tomatoes and cheese was wonderful.

This is a lovely recipe, i made the following substitutions, just because of what was available in my kitchen. I sliced cherry tomatoes and tossed them in the flour/basil mixture, then sauteed them with the onions after sauteing the onions with garlic for a bit. I used Havarti and Gouda cheese instead, because that's what I had. I didn't use any salt, but I spiced the egg/milk mixture with pepper, oregano, turmeric, paprika, and sumac. I added some kale microgreens in with the egg mixture. Instead of layering the onions and then the tomatoes, since i sauteed them together I just put them in together (personally i usually like stuff in my dishes to be mixed instead of in layers, so this worked for me). Will definitely be making again! :)

I made this quiche and set servings to 12.  This made two deep dish pies. I added an additional 3 eggs and milk (half and half) because I wanted to make the quiche thicker and fill the pie crusts. I sautéed diced onions and followed the recipe.  The was wonderful!  Next time I will double the recipe again to make a total of 4 pies. This will feed a family of 5 or 6 with leftovers. I am also using this recipe and making veggie quiche with spinach, zucchini, onion, garlic, mushrooms.

I basically followed the recipe but used fresh basil layered on top of the tomato layer. Also, I used a mixture of different spices when I sautéed the tomato in place of the dried basil. My family loved it!!!

Wow. This was amazing! Definitely use fresh basil no matter what type of cheese you use. I used an Italian mix of white cheeses and it was to die for. Also definitely bake for 35 minutes at 350.

Outstanding!!! I have never made a quiche before, and this one turned out wonderfully! I did bake it at 400 degrees instead of 350, to keep with the golden brown consistency to determine when it was ready.

Delicious! I used the basic recipe and added 2 cups chopped fresh spinach with 1 tb. italian seasoing to the onion mixture.  Omitted the tomatoes and just mixed the fresh basil in with the whisked eggs. My husband and two year old loved it.  I made a crustless egg white version for myself and it was very good too. Will make again.  Thank you.

I thought it was pretty good.  We did not have time to wait for it to coolfor an hour so it was a little runny.  I also diced the onion, and think that I will dice the tomatoes next time as well.  I also added bacon, who does not love bacon!

I really liked this recipe.  The basil is pretty strong so don't sprinkle too much on those tomatoes if you aren't a big fan of basil.  I think I will try adding mushrooms next time too.

I was really expecting something fabulous, but it tasted like a basic omelet on a crust.  I did use fresh basil and added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of milk to cover ingredients.  Overall, it just needs more flavor.

Wow, this was so good. My fiance loved it too. I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for, and I chopped the tomatoes instead of slicing them. I will be making this again for sure!

Yum! I made some changes but used all the same ingredients. Chopped the onions instead of slicing them and skipped frying the tomatoes at the suggestion of another reviewer. The combination of flavors was perfect. This is my new favorite quiche.

I personally could not get enough of this, but I did change the recipe some. I used fresh basil, and removed the goo from the center of the tomatoes so it wouldn't be as watery. It was super yummy! I think next time I'll try some sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh to mix it up a bit!

This turned out wonderful.  I added a couple extra things: turkey bacon, I crumbled 3 strips, and added a handful of sauted mushrooms.  One other changed, just because of personal preference I used only used a half onion.  As others noted I needed an extra 10 minutes of cooking time.

Having never made a quiche before, I found this recipe to be easy and delicious.  I added salad shrimp.  I did have to cook this a lot longer then the recipe called for, but that could be my oven.

This was pretty good, though for me, it was lacking a little something. I will admit that I changed the recipe a little: I chopped everything up and mixed it all together like I do with every quiche. But the ingredients were all the same and it just lacked a little. I may try again with mushrooms or bacon added in. But otherwise pretty good.

A friend brought a bunch of tomatoes in to work this morning.  I knew if I didn't do something with them soon, they would go bad.  This was really good.  I had made a tomato pie a couple years back and this was hands down better.  I fried the tomatoes in olive oil after I dredged them in a Italian breadcrumb and basil combo.  I used cheddar and mozzarella because that's what I had on hand.  This recipe was really easy and because of frying the tomatoes before you put them in the pie, they don't get watery in the pie. My only suggestion would be to add more tomato. Two tomatoes didn't seem to go too far once you fry them and they shrink down.

Yummy!  I added some fresh mushrooms, and used fresh basil from my garden instead of dried.  My only complaint is that it took longer to cook than the recipe stated, and even when the top was golden brown, the middle was a little runny.  But very easy to make.

This was a very good quiche which I made with a crust that I also reviewed.  I think taht next time I will add another tomato to the recipe, and I would also add some fried mushrooms since my kids like them.  I also used soy milk since I have kids with allergies.  I made two quiches, one with and one without cheese due to a dairy allergy.  The chessy one was better.  i skimped on the cheese but next time I wouldn't skimp as much.  The cheesier the better.

Great recipe; the only change I made was that I didn't cook the tomatoes, I sliced them and layered the circles on top of all of the other ingredients before pouring on the egg mixture. I made it for Thanksgiving and two of my christmases this year and everyone loved it!

Our second recipe for "Meatless Mondays" and to my surprise the hubby liked it as did I, the daughter wasn't to crazy for it though. I carmelized the onions and also used seasoned bread crumbs on the tomatoes instead of flour as suggested by other reviewers, I don't know if I would coat the tomatoes with anything next time. I did have to bake it a little longer than suggested. Served it with a salad, dinners done! This ones a keeper.

This was a wonderful recipe on its own, but I did make some modifications. First because of our abundant tomato harvest this summer, I used 5 small tomatoes instead of 2 as called for in the recipe. I also took the advice of previous reviewers and coated the tomatoes with bread crumbs instead of flour. To vary the veggies up, I added about 1 cup of chopped kale, 1/2 cup of chopped mushrooms and 1/2 cup of chopped celery, and sauteed them together with the onions in olive oil (I also added about 1 tbsp of garlic for flavor). My kitchen smelled fantastic! I used Kraft Five Cheeses blend (provolone, mozzarella, asiago, parmesan and romano) instead of Colby Jack. This was simply delicious and a real treat for our supper tonight. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was awesome! My Mom and fiance loved it too. I diced the tomatoes and tossed them with breadcrumbs. It was so flavor full. I had to cook it a little longer than the directions said though.

This was fantastic!!! I changed it slightly based on other people's suggestions. I only used 1 tomato (seeded but not peeled) and about 4-5 sundried tomato halves in oil. I chopped those up and tossed with the flour and basil. I only used ONE teaspoon of basil. I think that made a difference. I used the No Roll Pie Crust II (which I DID bake beforehand). I only had 2 eggs, so I added a bit more milk (3%) to compensate. The recipe turned out great!!! Next time I may double it (maybe not all the cheese) and go crustless. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe with my changes.

I loved this quiche. I made a few changes I sprinkled tomatos with Ital. Bread crumbs instead of flour and added freshly grated parmesean in place of the Colby. I had no onions on hand but it still came out wonderful. I used the butter pie crust on this site and it made a delicious dinner.

This quiche was okay, but a little strange with the flour on the tomatoes.  I probably would leave that off next time if I would make this again.

This was a big hit at my Mom's birthday party! I used frozen deep dish pie crust, cooked for 10 minutes before filling as directed. It was delicious!

This recipe was a hit! Delicious, and not too "eggy." I did change a few things: added chopped mushrooms (family preference), diced the onions and used fresh basil. 

I only had shallow pie crusts on hand, so I divided the mixture in two. This worked nicely, so I may do that for the next try as well.

I made this today for Easter brunch.  I followed the suggestions from Ultragirl & the quiche turned out delicious.  I did add 3 crumbled strips of bacon to the egg mixture for a little more protein. My whole family loved it & I 'll definitely make it again!

This is a wonderful vegetarian quiche.  I made it for Easter brunch, and it got eaten quite fast with people fighting for seconds.  I used a store-bought frozen crust, but no one noticed the difference because the quiche itself is so good.

I absolutely loved this quiche. This isn't an overly "eggy" quiche, but the flavor was outstanding. I used fresh basil, rather than dried and I think that really added to the flavor. Bought two large tomatoes to use, but barely used one - the pan would have overflowed with two!

I don't like quiche but I really loved this! It doesn't have that "eggy" taste that I usually object to in other recipes.
