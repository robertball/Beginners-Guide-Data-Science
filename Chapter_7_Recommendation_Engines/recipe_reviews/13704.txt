I did not follow the recipe to a tee. Less broth and fresh jalapenos. Let it cook in the slow cooker. Better than the usual leftover menu. My family really enjoyed these. Thanks for a unique idea!

I printed this recipe out in 2004. Came back in to get another copy for my sister and wow! What happened to the ingredients?? The original only had 3 1/2 or 4 cups of broth and the stuffing, potatoes, gravy all changed amounts. Not good.

This was a great recipe to use when you had all the left over turkey from the holidays!

These were just okay - kind of like turkey mush wrapped in a tortilla.  Needs some chilis or spice - but I'm not sure how.  Probably will find another use for the leftovers.

Great idea! It could have used a little more flavor for me, so I added chopped sage and poultry seasoning. I'm a vegetarian, so I used soy turkey and added some chopped roasted chestnuts for texture and protein.

I like the idea of this recipe, but two quarts of broth is just far too much. I haven't yet made this successfully, but will try again, with less broth and more solid items.

2-3 cups of broth is all you will need... It was ok, nothing spectacular. Maybe burrito definitely not taco and should not be in the Latin or Mexican food category at all. A little smoked paprika maybe some cumin makes it much better on a tortilla and might even earn a South of the border tag

Normally I try to make a recipe as written but after reading the reviews I knew the amount of broth had to be off and it is. I did not have high hopes for this so I started out by halving  the recipe which calls for 4 cups of broth. I started out with 1 cup, left all of the other ingredients the same, and these turned out fantastic. As written you will have issues. You must reduce the amount of broth. With the reduction of broth this is a 5 star way to use up leftovers. It's not the prettiest of dishes but the flavor combo with the addition of pickled jalapeno impressed me. I did end up dicing some of the jalapeno and adding it to the mixture along with adding slices to the top out of personal preference. If you do end up needing to thicken the mixture I recommend doing so with instant mashed potato flakes instead of flour.  I would  I would gladly eat these over a bean and cheese burrito any day. They were that good. Don't skip the tortilla browning step for it adds another layer of flavor that comes through in the finished dish. Thanks for sharing!

Such a unique recipe, and so good! My husband and I doubted this even as we were making it. We considered serving it over rice, but decided to go ahead with the original recipe. I didn't have any leftover stuffing, and since it all has to boil anyways, we put the stuffing in dry and added the celery that we would have put in it. Didn't add the jalapenos on top, but put lots of black pepper inside. We also used half the broth, and liked that consistency - I can't say if more broth would have been too much. With half, these were kind of the consistency of a creamy bean and cheese burrito. I wish we had more leftovers to make these again!
