Despite me overcooking the potatoes, this was still very good.  Being vegetarian, I left out the bacon and I also substituted red pepper for green, pickled jalapenos for fresh (can't get fresh ones easily here) and Dijon mustard for brown mustard (don't know what that is).  I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today.

So good!  A lot was gone while it was still warm.  Used half mayo, half Miracle Whip, canned jalapenos, and all the bacon went in the salad.

Pretty good.  My problem is I have a tendency to over cook the potatoes.  First they are too al dente; next they are mush!

This was surprisingly good. I'm a traditionalist when it comes to southern staples, such as potato salad, but this was a very flavorful variation that I will try again. The only thing I would do differently would be to serve the bacon pieces on the side. The next day, the bacon becomes soggy when mixed into the potato salad.

This is the second time I made this and it is sooo delicious! I love it! I added a stalk of celery for more crunch. The only thing that I would recommend is to only use 2 cups mayo and wait to see if that is enough. If not, continue to add until it's the consistency that you like. The 2 1/2 cups was a little too much for me but it could have been because of the size of the pototoes. I garnish with bacon, green onion, course ground black pepper and pickled jalapenos. This is my new favorite potato salad! Thank you for sharing it!!!

This was an amazing change to the Potato Salad we all know.  However, next time, I'm substituting the potatoes with macaroni for a Macaroni Salad.  Awesome recipe.  ***UPDATE*** Omitted the bacon, doubled the black beans, cut the mayo back to 1 cup, and substituted the potatoes with macaroni.  Now this is my favorite Potato AND Macaroni Salad!!

This is even better the next day!  Use all the jalapenos, even though it sounds like a lot for a nice kick.  The only change I made was I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup Miracle Whip.  YUMMY!

Absolutely loved it.  Had to use Dijon mustard as I had no brown and added a combination of light mayo and sour cream a bit at a time to cover.  This is a definite keeper and I bet it will be even better to-morrow.

This was so good.  A nice change from the regular stuff.  A few people even asked for the recipe and being these people all live here in Tx is surely a compliment to the creator of this recipe.
They asked me to make it again next potluck and am happy to oblige,
Thanks for sharing.

This was really good, but when I scaled it down to 6 servings, it called for 1 and 1/4 cup of mayo which is WAY too much. I'm not sure if this is because of the scaling or not. I would half the mayo in this case. I added the whole can of black beans to make up for it. I used red onion because it was all I had and it was good. I also added more cajun seasoning because I love it! I served this with a slow-cooked chicken and corn! Very yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

I started making this recipe last year and it has been requested at every family gathering and Holiday since then. I use more or less on the jalopenos depending on the crowd im feeding ( My inlaws are Hispanic and my family is not) so i talylor the spicyness to the crowd. I boil my potatos  and mix up the other ingredients seperate the day before and chill them overnight then mix it together fresh the morning of our meal and it is real fast. LoVE IT!!!!!!!!

I normally don't like potato salad and I just realized why---everyone always slathers it in mayo!  I used way less mayo than called for, just enough to cover the potatoes and really like this recipe.  The only other tweaks were for vegetarian reasons--no eggs and bacon salt instead of bacon.  I think the black beans and cajun seasoning are definite musts for me to eat potato salad in the future!

I don't even like potato salad, but this turned out to be outstanding. I didn't add beans or mustard, and substituted miracle whip. I cant wait to blow my next family lunch out of the water with this one.

Really, good potato salad. I love that it is a little different from traditional potato salad, especially the spicy kick. We will make this again.

This was okay.  I liked the spice, but the black beans didn't really add to the potato salad.  I couldn't taste them.  I also wasn't a big fan of the bacon it in.  If I make again, I will omit the bacon.  Also considering adding pickled jalepenos instead of fresh jalepenos to change the flavor a little bit.

Simply wonderful. I made this for a bar-b-q and everyone LOVED it. Easy to put together and tastes very fresh, unique, and most of all- DELICIOUS! The only thing I will change next time is cutting the jalepenos up in little tiny pieces rather than slices and maybe use less. I had a few people say the bites with the jalepeno slices were a little too spicy for them :). Awesome recipe!

I spent a whole day preparing several dishes for a large party.  I made this dish without the eggs (personal preference).  It was one of the easiest recipes & the one that everyone commented favourably on.

A great variation of an old favorite!  Changes I made:  used 10 potatoes, left the peels on and diced them before cooking; skipped the bacon, jalapenos, salt and pepper; doubled the green onion and cajun seasoning; used only about 3/4 cup lowfat mayo. I was skeptical of the green peppers, but ended up really enjoying them.  My boyfriend added canned jalapenos to his serving but was diappointed with them.  Next time he'll try fresh instead.  We both agree that we want to try adding extra mustard and possibly add some diced celery and olives next time.

We loved this version of potato salad. I was afraid that it would be too spicy for my family, I love spicy but got a 2 yr old and my husband doesn't like a ton of spicy so I only used 1 jalapeno instead of 3. I wish I had used 3 it wasn't spicy at all even my husband said he taste no spice. Just make sure you cut out the seeds and veins and than dice and it will be great. I think next time I will leave out the bacon though, I couldn't really taste it just kept feeling it in my mouth and I had to remind myself it was bacon and not something that wasn't suppose to be in there. But since I can't taste it might as well leave it out and save on the fat. We will make this again.

Thanks for the recipe. I did not have red potatoes so I used Yukon golds and split mayo with Light Miracle whip, Light Hellmans and light sour cream.  I also added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1 tsp cumin and used Bushes seasoned black beans. Yum Yum everyone loved it.

Recipe was good, I mixed sour cream with Ligh Mayonaise and miracle whip.  This lightens both color and taste, not so greasy, I added Garlic powder 1-1 1/2 teaspoons, Ground Cumin 1 teaspoon, chili powder 1/2 teaspoon, dried pepper flakes 1 teaspoon.  I used Turkey bacon instead of pork bacon. Enjoyed very much.

Great potato salad.  The whole family loved it.  A nice change from the traditional potato salad I usually make.

Like most potato salads you can play with the ingredients and amounts. I used twice as many green onions, red pepper instead of green and a mild jalapeno. My family loved it.

I thought this was a fantastic variation of potato salad.  I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup light sour cream and about 3T of cajun seasoning.  I didn't have green onions, but everything else was pretty much the same.  It would be good with some corn too!

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  I replaced the mayonnaise with 16 oz of fat-free mayonnaise and 16 oz of light sour cream - tasted great! There was no "low fat" flavor, just rich spicy salad.

this was good, but i wasn't blown away. a nice change from ordinary salad; i'll probably do it again. i was afraid there might be too much mayo, and cut it down, but i was wrong and i'll definetly use the full amount next time.

Wonderful and unique recipe!  Didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I made a few changes and substitutions.  I used Yukon yellow potatoes, 1/4 cup diced onions, 3/4 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 2 tbs. yellow mustard, and added red pepper flake and 2 tbs. of hot sauce per other reviewer. Would love to try with brown or spicy mustard next time.  Will definately be making again!

Favorite at the party! I used only 1 cup of mayo, enough to cover the potatoes well. Otherwise seems like overkill on mayo. 
I didn't use the mustard or gr. pepper. I doubled the green onions, black beans and used hot sauce instead of Cajun seasoning. 
Also added crushed garlic and fiery 5 pepper spice. I saved a handful of bacon, onion and black bean to garnish the top.

Very nice - i will definitely make again, but will reduce the quantity of mayo by 1/3. Niether the black beans nor the jalapeno came out as very distinctive in the dish, still definitely 4*.

This is wonderful!  I had to change things a little because of what I had on hand.  I didn't use the cajun seasoning or the bell pepper.  I used yellow mustard and 1/2 a vidalia onion.  I also used jalapenos from a jar.  It's delicious!  I love the addition of the black beans and the spice from the jalapenos is unusual and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe - I'll use it over and over!

Nice variation on potato salad!  I added some balsamic vinegar to give it extra kick, along with some diced red onion and a bit of cumin.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks!

This had all of my husband's favorites in it, so how could I go wrong!? I can honestly say, I never quite expected the reaction I got from the final result! We ate it for one meal, he covered it back up and said "we're inviting your parents over tomorrow night as this is the best potato salad I've ever had." This really is a nice 'change' from all the traditional potato salads out there. I'm not a huge jalapeno fan, but they are really not that overwhelming in this recipe. As much as it annoys me for people to make changes to the original recipe and then comment on it, I did make one substitution...I used a red bell pepper instead of a green one just for the 'pretty' factor. This is definitely a keeper!!!

I doubled the recipe and used less mayonnaise, probably 1 cup less for a doubled recipe. It could have used a bit more heat for those who like things really spicy, but it was just right for those who don't.    Lots of compliments on this one.

This was a great mix of flavors and textures and a nice change from traditional potato salad.  We served it with chicken fajitas, chili-lime tortilla triangles, and homemade salsa for a large dinner party and it went over well.
