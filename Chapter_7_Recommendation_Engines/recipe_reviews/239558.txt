I made these brownie and used Nestle peanut butter and chocolate chips. they came out excellent! the entire 13Ã—9 inch pan was gone withing 24hrs. my boyfriend loved them and so did the kids. they r the perfect level of sweetness. not too sweet , but perfect! this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I substituted maple syrup with vanilla extract and omitted the baking powder. Also I did not have the chips (whoops!) so I added about 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter. Turned out very well, moist and delicious! Would have been perfect with the chips.
