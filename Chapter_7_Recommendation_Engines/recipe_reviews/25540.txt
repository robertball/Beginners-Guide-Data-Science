This recipe was so simple and delicious.  It was a great alternative to regular dill dips or ranch dips.  I put it in the blender to make it extra smooth.  I served this with fresh veggies, and the gang loved it!

This is really good, but I think you need to serve it with really flavorful crackers, or it could be a little bland.  Good though, I love dill.  Don't put in too much garlic powder by mistake, like me!  MMmmmmm

I used Trim Cottage Cheese and a good amount of dill weed. I wanted a more smooth consistancy for my dip--I ran the cottage cheese through the blender before folding in the other ingredients. You know, I really liked this dip and it surprized me that the family did, too. They couldn't even tell it was made with cottage cheese!

I used a lot of dill weed on top, and it was excellent with crackers -- any kind. Simple, but good :)

This was nice and very simple, but just a little bit bland.  It could use a little pepper!

I made it just as the recipe said, but I added some onion powder to it. That gave it that extra flavor it was missing!
