A friend made this recipe before I had tried it myself and it was fabulous!  A few weeks later I made it myself and not only was it easy to prepare, but it turned out great!  I got so many compliments on it and even passed out the recipe to a few more friends.

I made these for friends and they were absolutely delicious.  I made the recipe as written (although I didn't measure very precisely) and they came out perfectly.  I mixed in a little garlic and herb feta with the original to spice them up a bit as well.  I highly recommend this recipe for guests.

I had to improvise on this one, based on what I had on hand.  I used on the vine tomatoes and a mix of black and green olives, because I didn’t have kalamatas.  My oven was already going at 350 degrees, so I used that temperature and baked these for only about 15 minutes.  I just wanted to warm them through and didn’t want them turning to mush.  These were very good, but probably would have been a little better with the kalamata olives.  I’ll use those next time.  I also toasted my pinenuts in the oven at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes, until golden.  I think that’s easier and you don’t have to stir constantly for 3-4 minutes as indicated in the recipe.  I’ll make this again!

This was easy to put together and so very flavorful. I thought I had cream cheese, but did not, so used some garlic and herb spreadable cheese and it worked out well. Love the texture of the pine nuts in there. Every bite a delight!

We had this for dinner tonight and they were delicious! We used goat cheese infused with basil and oregano in place of the feta. The cheese melded well with the tomato and kalamata olives. We'll definitely make these again.

The cheese filling on this is incredibly delicious.  I had reduced fat cream cheese with chives in the fridge, and I think that actually enhanced the flavor.  I had a little bit left over and used it on a couple toasted baguette slices, and that was equally good.  This recipe has been around for quite a while, and I'm surprised there are so few reviews because we absolutely loved it.  Moist, juicy, and tasty, 5 stars all the way in my opinion.
