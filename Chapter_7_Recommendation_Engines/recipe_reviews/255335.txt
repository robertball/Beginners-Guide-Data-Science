I love simple dishes and this qualifies as simple.  I love the bright flavor the lemon gives the broccoli but doesn't outshine the roasted flavor.  Sometimes I need a reminder that simple is a show stopper and this one is.

This couldn't be easier! A great alternative to the plain, steamed broccoli. My kids are devouring this! I might suggest a little more oil and a little less salt (it was fine for my family's taste, but others may prefer less salt). This would be great on the side of chicken piccata.

This recipe is best as is, but one time I prepared this dish, I didn't realize I was out of lemon juice and the broccoli was already roasting! I subbed raw apple cider vinegar for lemon juice and was pleased that it still tasted great.

Prefer my vegetables roasted to steamed and I liked the idea of whisking together the oil, salt and pepper before tossing the broccoli in it.  However, too salty!  Will definitely use this technique again but will use maybe 1/4 tsp. salt.

How can you not like roasted broccoli? Even people who claim they hate broccoli would love it prepared this way! No more of the old school boiling your broccoli til it's mush! This has a nice tang from the lemon. Next time I will add some garlic to the mix.

I added half a teaspoon of garlic powder, and the next time I will definitely halve the amount of salt. Other than that, I enjoyed this recipe as written.

I'm never eating steamed broccoli again! I added a sliced clove of garlic to infuse the oil while prepping the rest of the meal, then coated the broccoli with the infused oil and garlic slices. Yummers!

I prepared this exactly as written and it turned out pretty good except for the lemon juice.  It gave the broccoli an odd taste.  Next time I make it I will omit the lemon juice.

It was really good I think from now on that’s only way I’ll make broccoli, baked 425 for about 10 and then put foil so the stems get softer for another 10 and it was perfect!

This is the best recipe ever! Trying to eat healthy post heart bypass surgery. This was a winner. Thank you! BTW, I used 1/2 the salt and perfect.

An excellent way to make broccoli and a perfect side to so many main dishes.  Much more flavorful than steamed or sauteed.  The charred bits are to die for!

I didn't add the lemon juice, but it was still delicious.  I cut the ingredients in half for one head broccoli since I'm just cooking for myself.

Made this broccoli recipe for a dinner party.  Everyone thought it was good but I think I will use a little more oil and add some garlic next time. Very easy too make with not much fuss.

Added a few crushed cloves of garlic to give a little more flavor.  Dressed up with walnuts, Parmesan and a hard boiled egg for a healthy dinner. Great!

You can't go wrong with this combination! You can easily add 1-2 cloves of garlic to bump up the flavor but the lemon also gives the broccoli a nice tang.

I'm the only one in my home who doesn't like cheese sauce on my broccoli, and this was perfect!

I really enjoy roasted broccoli. Add the lemon juice and what a nice burst of flavor. I will definitely make this again!

Such a flavorful recipe for such an easy to make dish. Roasting and adding the lemon juice makes this broccoli dish a keeper, even George H.W. Bush would like this.

The generous amount of lemon juice really adds a tangy kick to the broccoli. This is one of those recipes to keep as a quick go-to for a fancy vegetable when you have company.
