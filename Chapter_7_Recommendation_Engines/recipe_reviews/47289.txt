This is a great recipe! Easy and yummy. The kids like arranging the berries and “making it pretty”. I don’t have a tart pan, but pie pans work just as well, just crimp the edges and they bake down to form a nice edge. Remember to take the crust out before you put in the filling as it’s just easier that way. I also use the glaze from the fruit pizza II on this site and that allows me to make this the night before and not have it dry out. The recipe is: ½ cup sugar, a pinch salt, 1 tbsp cornstarch, ½ cup orange juice, 2 tbsp lemon juice and ¼ cup water – combine in a sauce pan over med heat. Bring to a boil for 1-2 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool but not set.

I made this for Easter and it was a hit!  It's worth hunting down almond paste and digging out that old tart pan.  Easy, elegant, luscious and pretty--four hallmarks of a great dessert.  I used pears and apricots.
