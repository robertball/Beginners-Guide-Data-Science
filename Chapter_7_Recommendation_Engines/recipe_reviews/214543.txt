It's pretty hard to go wrong with that much bacon and cheese. This was a really good recipe, and my whole family of five liked it. I used fresh spinach like some other reviewers. I melted the butter and started the spinach first in the skillet. When it had wilted a bit I added the onions, garlic, etc. Also I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular milk. It was not a problem. I used both mahi mahi and tilapia. The mahi mahi tasted the best in this dish.

These were very interesting ingredients to go on fish but surprisingly it worked out well!  I didn't end up broiling it b/c I didn't want to overcook the fish so I just ended up adding the parmesan when I did the jack cheese.  I used fresh spinach so I sauteed it off in a separate pan then added it when needed.  Yummy recipe..thanks!!!!

This was a very yummy recipe!  I was looking to have mahi mahi with a different twist and this turned out good!  I would cut back a little on the cheese and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Thanks for sharing!

So delicious I made mine with a side of asparagus and mash potatoes, using the frozen spinach was no problem. I swear this recipe leaves them wanting more. My 80 year old grandmother does not have much of an apetite and she LOVED it!

It was very good except for the fact that there was way to much cheese and it didn't make much of a sauce.

bf also made this one.. we halved the recipe.. and tried using about 6 oz of fresh spinach instead of the frozen.. it just looked like way too much to put on the fillets.. ended up chopping up the cooked fish and mixing it into the spinach mixture.. used soy milk for the evaporated and about 1/2 the cheese.. i couldn't image how super rich this would have been if we made the exact recipe.. tossed in a few dashes of lemon pepper and mixed it into some elbow macaroni.. we loved it.. thanks for a starting point

Yum! I'm not sure if I'll make it again because the flavor wasn't quite enough to be worth what felt like a major calorie splurge with all the cheese, but it was good.

Ok - if you do this, here's what we changed - A) We used pepper bacon B) We used one of the bigger bags of frozen spinach C) We reduced a pint of heavy cream and used that and not the evaporated milk - and we used all of the cream! D) We sprinkled some bread cumbs and some parm cheese before broiling.

I was looking for something new. Husband and I loved it! Thank you :) I halved the recipe by eye because there are only two of us and I'm always doing too many things at once in the kitchen (making coconut custard pie) to measure what doesn't NEED to be measured. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Great job. There are not too many recipes I don't change to my tastes, so I never review them. Thanks again! Mrs D.

Very yummy recipe. I used turkey bacon instead of the regular bacon. Next time I think I will not add salt when cooking the fish because it came out a bit on the salty side (once you add the bacon and cheese), but then again I usually do not add salt to any of recipes so it my just be my taste buds.

I made it with fresh spinach added to sauteing garlic in batches as it wilted down.  Used the same pan from frying up bacon pieces (dab of butter to de-glaze bacon pieces and saute garlic, after draining grease). Used fresh cream instead of evap but was thinner than I liked and I'll use recipe next time. Used extra sharp white cheddar in place of the mont jack. Fish cooked whole filet for the family, used spin/tomato/carrot veggie fusilli pasta tossed in a butter/olive oil garlic Parmesan sauce...kids wanted steamed broccoli and carrots...I wanted fresh green beans...

It was all really good with steamed broccoli and carrots, the sauce was delicious (even on boy's girlfriend's chicken breast)!  

I'm thinking of doing the sauce with angel hair or rice pilaf next...maybe chicken or beef?  Great recipe, Thank You!

Definitely adding this to the make again list. I typically am a purist when it comes to mahi but this is a great option to mix things up. I cooked the mahi filets in the left over bacon grease to not dirty another pan. Tasty tasty

I used vegetarian bacon and it was still delish. Also used frozen spinach/kale mix and as directed added more milk to taste.  I ran out of montery cheese so substituted with moz and still turned out great!

Just made this for dinner. Only changes were fresh spinach and regular milk as it was all that I had on hand. The entire family says it's a keeper! Added a little more hot sauce on the top for presentation when plating-delicious!

OMG Kimberly!! This recipe is the digity bomb.com. Mahi is my favorite and I was looking for another way to cook it other than blackened. I had to improvise on some of the ingredients (fresh spinach and Colby Jack Cheese). Me and the kids love it. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

Very flavorful topping.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used leftover topping on scrambled eggs in the morning, and it was perfect.  My husband tells me I need to have some of this in the fridge at all times.  He's a fan.  Only change was we used turkey bacon.

Well, I would give it 3.5 out of 5. It was good but so very heavy. I cut back on the cheese and salt and bacon. It seemed very old school cooking.

Good recipe. Next time i may use less onions and parmesan as my boyfriend thought it was too much.
