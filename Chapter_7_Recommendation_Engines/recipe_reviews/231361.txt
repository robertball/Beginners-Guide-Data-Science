This pretty classic pound cake has a delicate and pleasant fresh lemon flavor with a dense, moist crumb - but for me it was almost too dense, too compact. While in theory it isn't necessary, I think I would prefer this with the extra bit of lift a little baking powder would give it, maybe 1/2 teaspoon. A pinch of salt never hurts either.

I was looking for a simple lemon cake from scratch and you saved the day for me! I used the Meyer's lemons I had on hand and make a cherry jam ribbon in the center . A simple lemon juice and powdered sugar icing and the elbows were flying!! I am keeping this excellent recipe in my personal hard copy recipe book! Thank you!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed it exactly as written and the cake was okay.  The second time I added a box of lemon pudding and baking powder.  I also added a dash of lemon extract.  I like my cake very lemony.  It was delicious!  The pudding mix makes it moist.  The cake was very dense!  I made one with lemon icing and another one with cream cheese icing.  YUMMY!

This recipe kicked last weeks lemon bread's butt.   It was easy and yummy.  Its not low fat or diet approved. But it tasted so yummy!!   5 people inhaled the whole thing.  I used raspberry jam in the bundt pan.   I am going to make it again.  I can't stop thinking about it

This cake is amazing! I just made it using the advice of putting in a little salt and baking powder. I also made a lemon glaze. This will be my go to recipe.

Very delicious. I added a bit of salt and baking powder as another reviewer suggested with good results. Everyone wanted seconds. I made a raspberry sauce and poured over top which was a nice addition for Easter but not necessary.

This is the best lemon cake I have ever had!! Super moist . I added 1/2 cup of lemon and lime zest as I like it very citrusy. This will be my go to company or luncheon cake .

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe (no modifications) and didn't love it.  The consistency was that of a pound cake (no problem there) but the flavor was bland.  I probably wouldn't make it again unless I did some major changes.

I make with ingredients in accordance to recipe, and it turns out great every time. It is very much like the dense German lemon cake my mom made when I was growing up.

This cake is now part of my weekly baking schedule. For the best flavor I use zest from a large lemon or two to three small lemons. I then beat in the zest and lemon juice to the butter/egg mixture and add flour last. It is very important to not over bake.

I made mine and cut the calories and sugar using splenda adding the baking powder, sugar free lemon pudding and used no egg substitute. I made a fresh lemon glaze. It was delicious

Divorced, single dad, she got the bundt  pan (and everything else, but I got the kids) so I made it in a 9x13 glass pyrex pan thing.  Swapped the butter for margarine (lactose issue) and made a simple lemon glaze with icing sugar, margarine and real lemon juice ... I rock! ... Whoops, IT rocked! Definitely will make it again

It was delicious but a word of warning: be very careful to generously grease and flour the bundt pan. I used cooking spray and the cake came apart on removing from pan. I managed to pull it together; and though it looked very messy, it tasted excellent. Next time I'll be extra generous greasing and flouring what was supposed to be a "non-stick" pan.

Made this for St. Pat's Day dessert.  Used lime instead of lemon.  Fabulous!  I added 1 C sour cream, 1/2 tsp salt, and had to bake for 65 minutes.  Will make again, definitely.  Maybe try orange next :)

Amazing Cake!

I am always looking for recipes that work with what I have in the pantry, so when I saw this, I had to give it a try.  I did change a few things after I read the reviews though.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of baking powder.  I also used bottled lemon juice.  The cake came out  moist and yummy!  My son took home half the cake for himself and requested I make it again.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe a little skeptical from some of the reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. It turned out beautifully, moist and a hint of lemon flavor. Served to a group of friends with coffee and it was an instant hit.  Requests to be made again.

I made this yesterday, it turned out great!  I made a lemon icing to go on top, in both case I added a little vanilla (about a teaspoon) and that make a big difference.  Perfect for all lemon lovers!

Followed the receipe but did use the suggested addition of baking powder and salt, it was a little on the sweet side, but was a big hit! I did add cherry jam as a topping :) delish!

Looking for a lemon birthday cake, and this fit the bill. It is a dense cake, but my family like it that way. The lemon is pleasant but not overpowering, especially if you're careful not to get the pith in your zest. Fresh juice from the same fruit as the zest will be about the right amount. I can't help thinking that making a double recipe might be a good idea.

I like that this cake is super easy and doesn't ask for something that you typically may not have in your house. But it is lacking in the lemon flavor. I will probably add more zest or juice or something extravagant to give it that big ol' lemon kick it needs. But otherwise it's pretty good.

Have tried  bundt cakes on many occasions and can't get them to come out of the pan cleanly.  The recipe is fine and the fault is apparently mine.  Wish I knew how to do it properly.

Very dense but I like dense. Add more lemon juice if you really want lemon flavor. I put a lemon orange glaze to really help.

I made this cake. I added a little salt and baking powder. It turned out very delicious.  A pinch of salt a teaspoon of baking powder.

My mom wanted a lemon bundt cake.  I couldn't find any already baked in town.  This recipe looked easy and she loved it.  Hasn't stopped talking about it.  I know I will be making it again and again

I made this recipe; but, then I added the following to it:  1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla, a dash of salt and 1 tsp Real Lemon juice.  It turned out AMAZING!  I topped it off with a cream cheese frosting.  A real hit at work for our potluck!

Trial run for an upcoming brunch turned out great.   Did follow suggestion of adding salt and 1/2t baking powder, & extra lemon juice.  If you're looking for a buttery, lemony pound cake, this one is great.  Will make again and serve with fresh strawberry and blueberries on the side.  May try adding some blueberries to the batter too, but for now I was going for that moist lemon flavor.  Sifted a bit of powdered sugar on top.

Made this as my birthday cake...not a real baker but love a good pound cake. Based upon the reviews, I did add the 1 teaspoon of salt, half cup of lemon juice along with the baking powder.  In my oven it took over 1 hour to cook.  Found it to be moist but very dense like others.  Will try this one again since for the novice baker it's a great recipe from which one can learn!

I really like this--as suggested in other comments--as a base recipe that is easy to fancy-up with additions or tweaks. The cake as I made it had a beautiful texture--fine crumb but nice and dense like a pound cake. 

I added a dash of salt and baking powder (about 1/2 tsp), as well as a healthy dollop+ of plain Greek yogurt (a lot of similar recipes call for sour cream but I only had the yogurt). I really liked the richness, moisture and tang the yogurt added--worked very well with the lemon. You can easily incorporate other citrus zests like orange. I like to always add a few pinches extra zest! 

I also added a raspberry jam ribbon in the cake by spooning some of the jam onto the batter in a ring in the bundt pan and sort of stirring it in a little ring. I also used a tiny bit of jam and lemon juice with confectioners sugar to make a glaze. The cake is sweet, especially with the jam (but also tangy) so don't go too crazy with glaze.

Made this bundt cake this morning to try out for Easter. I will definitely make it for my guests but will add some fresh berries or perhaps a blueberry sauce. Delicious.

So, someone mentioned they didn’t care for it because it’s more like a pound cake consistency; if you love pound cake like I do, you will love this simple, fresh recipe! It doesn’t rise very much, hence the denser consistency. I LOVE IT!!!

I followed the advice of others, and made the cake as per the recipe except for adding 1/2 tsp. Baking powder, 1/4 tsp. Salt, and an extra glug of lemon juice.  My electric mixer died in the middle of making the cake so I had to abandon it long enough to go buy a new mixer.  The cake didn’t suffer for the delay though.  It took the whole 55 minutes to bake, the texture was pleasing and not too heavy.  Next time I will put the glaze on it.

This is a great start to an amazingly lemony pound cake.  First I used a Gluten Free flour blend and added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt. I wanted a strong lemon flavor without making it too sour so I used 1 Tbl of lemon zest. I used a lemon glaze with more lemon zest. It was perfect for my family with those changes.

Easy recipe where I already had all the ingredients.  Took it over to my parents for dinner and everyone enjoyed.  I did add some lemon extract to the batter and it came our lemony. Will probably make this one again.

I wanted larger cake so I increased all ingredients by a half.  Also, added teaspoon of baking powder and a dash of salt.  I do not like the taste of lemon extract and did not have a lemon.  I used lemon essential oil to flavor the cake!  It was perfect!

I added the 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder as many reviewers suggested.  The cake fell as soon as it came out of the oven. We live at @6000 feet above sea level and I don't know if that was a contributor but it was such a disappointment.

Absolutely delicious! I sprinkled confectioner's sugar on it afterwards, and garnished with strawberries. My Easter guests and I enjoyed it very much and then, unfortunately, my Spaniel got to most of the rest of it...I will definitely make it again!

I made only one change to this recipe. I put in 1/2 tsp baking powder so the cake wasnt quite so dense. The cake is moist and creamy and lemony. I made a lemon glaze to top it off. Phenomenal!!!

Update, today i followed this recipe but instead of lemon juice I used 1/4 cup of strong coffee.

I made it exactly according to the instructions. While cooking, it smelled like a frittata. Way too eggy. No lift and way too dense to call a Bundt cake. I made it again thinking it was operator error and came up with the same result. Do not recommend at all.

I was looking for a lemon bundt cake like I remembered eating as a kid growing up in the South. I added a tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt to the flour mixture. (I have to use GF flour and I used King Arthur's GF all-purpose flour.) After adding eggs and flour mixture according to the recipe instructions, I added a small box of lemon pudding mix before adding the lemon. I glazed the cake with a lemon sugar glaze. The result was a deliciously most lemon cake. I only gave it four stars instead of five because I had to alter the recipe using the reviewers recommendations. It turned into a fun afternoon of baking with the neighborhood kids. Everyone loved it--kids and parents. The cake was gone by the end of the day.

This is my second time making this cake and it's wonderful! I make a few changes this time. I used the batter for pineapple upside down cake and added the pineapple juice to the mix.! Omg. This is a favourite. I will make this always. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Was looking for a simple recepie this is it but too dense for my taste. Next time will add baking powder and salt as others suggested.
