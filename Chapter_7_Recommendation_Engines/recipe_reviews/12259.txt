I have some die hard mincemeat lovers, so I tried this recipe, and it was a hit! As a note to a comment above, although many people now make mincemeat without meat; traditionally it was made with meat. Mincemeat developed as a way of preserving meat without salting or smoking some 500 years ago in England, where mince pies are still considered an essential accompaniment to holiday dinners just like the traditional plum pudding. This pie is a remnant of a medieval tradition of spiced meat dishes, usually minced mutton, that have survived because of its association with Christmas. These pies have also been known as Christmas Pies. Mince pie as part of the Christmas table had long been an English custom. 

Today, we are accustomed to eating mince pie as a dessert, but actually "minced" pie and its follow-up "mincemeat pie" began as a main course dish with with more meat than fruit (a mixture of meat, dried fruits, and spices).  As fruits and spices became more plentiful in the 17th century, the spiciness of the pies increased accordingly.

I made this for a Victorian Christmas for six people, and two of them liked it so much they fought over who got to take the leftovers home.  It's perfect for any get together!

First thing I did was to scale this down to 10 servings and it made 1 pie. 
I made it with a double batch of "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" found on this website. 
Since I have never eaten a mincemeat pie, I have nothing to compare this to, and I don't know how authenic the flavor is.   BUT I liked this pie. It was very good.  The only thing I did different is to use apple juice in place of the brandy.  Good.

I would hesitate to call this a "mincemeat" pie, seeing how us Brits know that there is NO meat in a mincemeat pie.(mincemeat is the Victorian name for a mixture of fruit) Call it a "minced meat" pie and it was OK. Neede something else, could not figure out quite what. Will make it again and experiment.

just watched a Victorian program on BBC making mincemeat for pies and contrary to a review of this recipe, it contained boiled beef. The best mincemeat I ever made had tinned sour cherries in it.

Thank you, Cali, for posting this delicious recipe.  My husband is from Central Pennsylvania, where everyone uses meat in their mincemeat recipes (venison or beef), he won't eat meatless mincemeat.

This is an excellent recipe, thank you so much for sharing it. 

I'd also like to share that I'd never known there was real meat in a mincemeat pie, but the non-meat mincemeat pie has been my favorite practically since birth, LOL, used to call it 'cement pie' when I was a girl. 

Also must share that someone claiming to be a Brit, said all Brits know there is no real meat in a mincemeat pie, but I beg to differ and must counter with a history site all about the origin of this delicious dish and its evolution throughout the ages. To learn all about this go to:

http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/MincemeatPie.htm

That helped me understand it even more and although the non-meat version has always been a staple for me for the last 49 of my 50 years, I'm also going to keep serving this new (to me) version of the truly traditional dish, it's wonderful!

A very Merry Christmas to all and to all a Wonderful New Year!

Beside having to cut this down to 5 servings (which was more manageable), this was a pretty easy and tasty recipe.  I know there is not always actual meat in mincemeat, but I liked the hearty taste of it myself.  I think it helps to offset the super sugary fruit mix.

Just wanted to add to the discussion that, although I have no idea what is available in the UK, the familiar brand of mincemeat that we in the US have been getting for decades does indeed have beef in it, but it's far down the list of ingredients - skimpy in other words. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this for a friend who’s mother made it for him years ago when he was growing up. I looked everywhere for a recipe that sounded anything like he described. This looked the easiest and boy was it a hit! I left some of the apples diced and added pears diced tiny and currents too. My British mother made mince meat pies without beef and used them. This pie was a hit and now I’m held to making it every Christmas!

I bake for a living and just used this recipe as a customer requested mincemeat pie. Love this recipe. It's so basic but has the flavors you need. I cut the recipe in half, and did cut back a bit on the sugar. Thank you and

I have been making this recipe for over 35 years, only instead of the Brandy, I use apple juice.  It really is delicious. and a LOT cheaper than the $8.95 jars of Mince meat at the grocery store.
