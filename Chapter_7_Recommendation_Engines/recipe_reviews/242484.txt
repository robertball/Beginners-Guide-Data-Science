Serve this at your next taco bar! As is, the kids will love it, then top with tomatoes, avocado and jalapeños for the adult table. The wild rice adds a nice crunch and nutty flavour. I served this nacho style, as written, but then added it to a taco shell. I mean, it has 'easy' and 'taco' in the title. What more does dinner need? The rice is super fast, the meat and seasoning cook quick too. Next time I'll add an onion with the meat but even without it, it is a five-star keeper. I couldn't find the Ready Rice® in my area, so I used Uncle Ben's® 10-minute version. Thank you RainbowJewels for your recipe.

Very good, super easy and fast! I used brown rice instead and it was great, definitely a keeper! I might use some black beans next time for variety.

Delicious!  We heated small flour tortillas in the skillet and topped them with the filling. Then we added dollops of sour cream.  This was very easy to make (great for a weeknight dinner!) and was tasty. Next time I might add some chopped jalapeños for a little kick.

This was a super easy recipe, in fact, my husband took this one over and did an excellent job! This is a great base for nachos and would be perfect served with refried beans and guacamole. This would also be excellent filling for tacos: fresh or fried. The Uncle Ben's Ready Rice made this a very quick, fool-proof meal. Great for a busy week day!

This is a great base recipe!  Added onions and garlic to the meat, then topped it all off with diced avocado and sour cream.  A can of ro-tel, as others suggested, would make a great addition.

Everyone really liked this but we did feel it could use more flavor....something tomatoe-y: rotel, picante, or just plain tomatoes would be great! We'll be trying that with leftovers tonight :)

I love one-skillet meals and this will go down as a favorite in my house! I doubled the corn and was so glad I did. The corn is the real winner in this dish.  And nothing could be easier to fix!

My kids liked it!  They really liked it!
I made 1 change. I used orzo instead of rice. Kids don’t like rice and didn’t use the optional onions.  (I’ll ease them into the rice so they don’t realize it’s happening.)

This was a simple meal that came together quickly, using ingredients I had on hand. I served with lettuce, tomatoes, and tortillas. This was delicious for lunch the next day, too!

My favorite thing about this recipe is how versatile it is. It allowed me to indulge in a "Dip" style meal and use chips as the vehicle to get it to my mouth and Mr. LTH simply added his to soft taco shells for a "real" meal.   I made a few tweaks, starting with the rice:  I used the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Pinto Beans and Rice (it seemed more tex mex-y). I forgot our microwave is kaput when I chose this recipe, so I just added the rice at the same with no issues. My pet peeve is recipes calling for me to use a portion of a packaged item, so I used the entire bag of frozen corn. No green onion on hand, but I diced half a sweet onion and added it to the mix the same time I added the cheese (and I found myself seeking out the bites with the onion). I served mine nacho style (as seen in my pic) with shredded lettuce, tomatoes,  sour cream, and jalapeños, along with tortilla chips. This makes a lot, so it'd be great for a family (I froze the leftovers for future easy camping tacos. Yes, we "camp" with a microwave.). Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is perfect for those lazy Sundays and when you want to whip up something fairly quick. The rice stretches this recipe out even further for multiple servings. Definitely a winner with my friends and will absolutely make this again for meal prep next time.

Four solid stars.  A comment that I heard around the table was that it would be better served as a burrito filling.  Recipe was easy, but everything turned a dark brown color - next time I might add the rice right with the cheese to keep everything bright.  The leftovers do not warm up well as the cheese turns it into an oily  mess.  I will make this again, but with my adjustments.

Super quick and easy, which is a plus! Tasted great. My 12 year old had seconds. Made it as read. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe was delicious, quick & easy. I was so surprised at the flavor & texture of the rice considering it is microwaved. I made my own taco seasoning (due to food allergies; the taco seasoning recipe is on AR) adding 1/8 + 2 teaspoons of seasoning to the meat mixture. I served this with broken taco shells and my kids (ages 6 &4) gave it 6100 stars:) next time, I'm going to serve it topped with avocado, tomatoes, fresh cilantro & sour cream.  Excellent recipe for a busy night. Thank you!

Quick and easy dinner for the family. Used two Minute Rice cups of the same mixture of rice since I don't think we have the Uncle Ben's twice mentioned in Canada.

Yummy and easy.  My 7 year old boys and husband liked it.  Used brown rice and cheddar cheese.  Did not use the green onions because I didn't have any.  Will make again!

My husband is vegetarian so I used black beans in place of ground beef. I also added some green pepper and used white rice. Turned out great!

Wonderful recipe! Really easy and very tasty.  I confess I ate way too much, but I can live with that.  I didn't really  change anything, but doubled the recipe and served it over a bed of shredded lettuce.  I topped it with the green onions and offered  sour cream and salsa on the side.

Quick, easy and very tasty, this was a hit in our house.  I added some chopped onion to the meat.  I also used white rice because that’s what I had on hand.  This was so good and will be easy to adjust to your personal tastes.

The family absolutely loved this and I would make it again. I browned the meat with onion and garlic and added tomato and fresh cilantro. I think I might kick up the spices a little next time but this is a fantastic basic recipe.

This was quick and easy to make. I made the recipe as written for my husband and again with tofu in place of the beef for myself since I don't eat meat. I love the addition of fresh corn and green onions mixed with the long grain wild rice. This recipe is a keeper!

We made this tonight, everyone liked it!  I think it could have used some tomatoes or maybe salsa.  Other than that I prefer homemade taco seasoning over the store bought, but it was still pretty good! I ate mine on Romaine Lettuce and the rest of the family used flour tortillas.  I like that this recipe is versatile!  Will definitely make it again.

This was easy to make and also very yummy, my family loved it! I substituted ground turkey in place of the ground beef.  I served this as a filling for soft tacos and also as dip with tortilla chips.  It was great served both ways. Thanks for sharing this recipe!
