I did this using my stand mixer by proofing the yeast in the water (warmed) then adding the molasses and melted butter.  It wasn't too humid here today so I was surprised that I had to add almost a cup more flour for it to come together.  The rest I used stated quantities, oh, I did add 2 tbs of caraway seed for personal taste.  Baked at 375 for about 26 minutes and produced a surprisingly light coarse textured bread that made terrific BLTs.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Not bad.  This is a very heavy, dry bread so it doesn't work very well as sandwich bread.  It'd probably work better as rolls accompanying coup or something, which is originally why I made it, but then went ahead and used as toast and sandwiches as well.  I did this more bc we don't really go through 2 or 3 loaves a week in this house; usually just one and I didn't want to freeze this.  Next time I'll do rolls and freeze them so I can pull out as needed for soup or chili.  If you enjoy rye and heavy wheat type breads, you will probably be okay with this.  If you are used to store bought white or wheat, I doubt you'll be a fan.  We were okay with this; hubs by now is used to me experimenting with different types of flours and breads.  Thanks for the recipe!

Unfortunately, it sank. However, it had great potential. I am going to try it again today.

Easy assembly, hearty, rich flavor. I added a tbsp of caraway seed and about 1/3 cup more water.   The result was a dense, but not dry texture, great for dipping in soup/stews.

This is certainly different, but wasn't my favorite.  Could've been something I did...but it had a coarse texture.  My kids didn't like it..my boyfriend loved it...I'm ambiguous about it.  I served it with soup and it did seem to be good for that.
