Made this last night and it was very easy to make and turned out excellent.  I found that I ended up with more filling than I needed though

Easy to make, creamy, the crust is very tasty. I know ovens can vary but definitely needed more than 55 minutes in mine. Also could have used a little more spice, the filling flavor was very faint and I could taste the tomato at times. I think 1/4 teaspoon more of cinnamon and nutmeg would have been good. Thanks for sharing!

This was ok.  The texture was fine and I did not have cracking (used pan of water on lower rack).  This did not have much of a ginger flavor.  I thought the crust was bland and I did add a pinch of ground ginger to the cookie crumbs.

I made this (also my very first ever cheese cake) and it was very easy! But nothing at all about it is 'gingery' so I added some dried, ground ginger. I also cooked it for an hour. I topped it with honey vanilla ginger glaze (another recipe from here that I altered a bit to suit the cake better)
