You will wonder how something so easy to make can taste so good. Prior to frying I cooked each sope on a griddle for 1 minute on each side. Working on the side that was heated first and pinched the edges of the sope up to form a lip approximately 1/2 inch (the masa is still hot so work quickly). Top with your favorite taco fillings.

Perfect amount of crispness on the sopes!  The critical direction is to heat them on the griddle BEFORE frying...so much better than my other attempts to make this treat of a dinner.  Thanks!

Wonderful little bowls of delight! I needed about a 1/3 of a cup more water and used less salt than written. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and cooked the dough on the griddle a minute per side before frying. They were very hot to handle but, on the bright side, my desire to follow a life of crime just became easier. It practically burned off my fingertips! :-) Thank you for the recipe.

Easy, accurate measurements and instructions.  I added half lime squeeze to match the flavor of top end corn tortillas.

These came out pretty heavy and dull. I experimented with adding some extra Nutiva shortening to them and switching to a cookie sheet but I am going to keep experimenting, this was not the recipe for me. Great idea over frying, needs to be refined

I think I should have deep fried them a little longer they seemed a little to soft.  Also I turned the edges up before frying, but they were very good and I will make them again.
