This had no discernible smell or taste other than the fresh cilantro I used.  I marinated it for 1 hour and then added ginger and garlic in the hopes of giving it some added 'zing', but it just didn't work.  And I don't consider salt and pepper 'spices'.  My guests (we were 6) were unanimously underwhelmed.  I won't be making it again.

This was very good... I marinaded the chicken overnight with some garlic cloves, the leftover limes, and cayanne pepper and used it to make soft shell tacos - DELICIOUS!

I'm giving it a 5 because it was so easy! I put it together in the a.m., traveled to a campsite, and we grilled it hours later. True, I'll play with some different spices, but the chicken was so tender, it's worth playing with!

My family and I all thought this was very tasty.  It is a mild flavor, but we grilled boneless skinless chicken breasts using this method (and I even didn't have the cilantro) and adding garlic and thought it was fine.  NOt sure why there are some negative reviews?  I'll be keeping it in my recipe box :)

Boring, Boring. You would be better off putting the lime in the beer and drinking it while using the chicken in another recipe.

This recipe was OK.  I think it should have been tangier.

Very juicy & mild flavored.  Next time we make this I'll try what was suggested in other reviews - add crushed garlic & cayenne pepper.

I thought it was quite tasty, but my family thought it had too much ale flavor. One member wouldn't eat it all.  so I had to downgrade to a three star.

This "marinade" was awful and really pointless.  My chicken didn't taste like anything... It didn't even taste like chicken!  Drink your beer, and marinate the chicken in something else.

I read all reviews that claimed this bland, so I changed the cooking method. Instead of grilling, I cooked it on the stove top in the marinade on high for a few minutes each side to start carmelizing the honey, then put a lid on and simmered. I used a belgium beer (it was sweeter) I served it with the cilantro on top as a garnish. The presentation was great and taste also. However, I can agree that if this was grilled, it would not retain much flavor and would be bland

I should have listened to the others when they said that it didn't have a ton of flavor.  I used it on pork steaks instead of chicken, and I don't think it would have mattered.  It was tasted just fine, but not that great if you are looking for something with a lot of flavor.

I marinated this all afternoon and even added some garlic for flavor but it didn't do much. Still no flavor after the chicken was grilled.

I have to agree with Steely Dan, I'd rather drink the beer and marinate the chicken in something else.  I marinated for about 2 hours, and I think chicken normally needs more, but this had very little flavor.  While grilling, I sprinkled with celery salt and coriander, thinking it'd step up the cilantro, but was unimpressed.  I also sprayed it with lemon pepper butter while grilling.  All these increased the flavor, but there have been other combinations I found much more pleasing than this.  And of course the chicken was tender, but that depends on how well you grill it, not the recipe.  Sorry.

This was a good recipe, but I added about 3 cloves of minced garlic to the marinade because we love the flavoring it adds. You can taste the ale even after it is grilled, which adds to the flavor. I served this up with pasta salad and garlic bread. Yummy!

This was great and easy to make. I think next time I might use 2 limes for a little extra lime flavor but even as is tasted great.

This just had very little taste.  Maybe add some soy sauce, liquid smoke, garlic, and molasses instead of honey.

Great basic recipe that can be easily added onto and made into something special.  I'm a university student so I used what beer i had available, a dark hemp beer, plus I had some veggies that were getting a little old so I threw those in too.  I cut the chicken into chunks so it would cook faster, and threw it all into a pan and sauteed it.  Then I served it over rice, absolutely loved it. Great recipe!

im giving this a four as we had to alter it, which i decided to do based on the reviews. I prepped it all the night before, place hand full of fresh cilantro, 4 or so cloves of garlic and minced together, put in with 1 bottle of beer, some extra lime juice, italian seasoning, and cayenne, salt and pepper and honey. the only thing i would change again is more lime, maybe some lemon juice, more cayenne, some crushed red pepper, and a tablespoon or 2 of italian dressing. i marinated mine over night and they grilled perfect on low and came out super moist. over all a good starter recipe, but add your own twists like we did!

I would not make this again - it was bland and had a stale beer smell when cooked.

I thought it was great although it would have been better if it were simmered in the mixture in a pan on the stove.

I used a bottle of Corona beer, and threw in a splash of Tequila.  I marinated the chicken overnight, and it came out very moist.  I have also used this marinade on pork chops, which was very moist and yummy as well.

I have to agree with other reviews this had no flavor.  Although my chicken was tender and juicy.  I have made other beer based marinades before.  But this one will not be on my list to make again

I don't usually like breasts..too dry...but these were moist all the way thru. I love this recipe...if it's too bland, add some seasoning before you cook it, but I don't see how you will find moister breast meat.
