No one has tasted these yet, but the directions are completely incorrect, so I felt I needed to rate it to give others a heads-up. This recipe says to use a MINI muffin tin. It says to open 12 mini peanut butter cups to put into the baked cookies. The amount of dough this recipe makes completely fills 24 mini muffin cups BEFORE baking. Of course, I went ahead and filled the 24 cups, thinking maybe, just maybe the 12 PB cups were suppsed to be 24. Then, after they'd been baking, I started opening those cups. What did I see? a nearly identical recipe on the back of the Reese's bag. The only difference? Vanilla. Well, vanilla AND the fact that the recipe (with identical amounts of flour, fat, PB, and sugar) says it makes 40 cookies, not 12. The baked cookies puffed over the tops of the mini muffin cups because they were so full to begin with. Wanna make these? Use TWO 24-cup mini muffin tins. Open 40 mini PB cups. Roll the dough into 40 balls, and follow the recipe directions for other amounts.

My mother and I have been making these at Christmas for years - couldn't find the recipe this year and were thrilled to find it here!  This is a simple recipe and is fun for kids to help with (both shaping and pushing in PB cups at end).  Everyone always loves them.  Thanks for saving the day, Gina!

These are a real hit at the office.  They taste great!  They do take a long time to make (unwrapping all of the reese's) and you need to make sure you store them in an air-tight container as they will become dry.

The dough didn't seem quite cooked when I took them out of the oven.  First pan I went with directions.  I might leave them in a little longer for the second pan.
