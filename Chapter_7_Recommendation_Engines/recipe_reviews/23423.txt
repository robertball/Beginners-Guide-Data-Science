This recipe was pretty good. I used good gravy mix anded a few xtra spices and it was just what she said THICK I wanted thinner so I added a little of the boiled potato juice and the whole family loved it. (boiling the potatoes with some chicken broth is a good thing also).

I can honestly say that I cannot justify making soup with a white gravy mix. In all fairness it isn't that hard or difficult to throw some flour milk and butter together to get a good base-start for the soup.... Not only is it funky-tasting (to be polite) but it's texture is God-awful.

Quick and easy potato soup to throw together. What could be easier than starting with a package of white gravy mix? This is a great starter base for fast potato soup. I had leftover baked potatoes that I used in this. I made it as written but quickly realized I need to add the things I put in my own potato soup - onions celery and fresh chopped parsley. We really enjoyed this soup and if I have leftover potatoes and want soup I would make it this way again to save some time.

I added left over chicken peas and corn. I put shredded cheese right at serving. It was really good.
