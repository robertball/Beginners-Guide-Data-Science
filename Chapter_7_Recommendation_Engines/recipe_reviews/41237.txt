I really enjoyed this recipe!  I halved the amount of breadcrumbs, doubled the amount of shrimp and of garlic, and added some mushrooms.  It was delicious!  Definitely a recipe you can play with to suit your own tastes.  And it reheats well too!

A little tweaking, and this dish tasted just like my favorite dish at the red bar in grayton beach, florida!  less breadcrumbs (about half), add onions, a little more garlic & shrimp, add a little thyme- and this was the best eggplant dish i've ever eaten- divine!  this recipe is great for  those who love to cook because you can adjust to suit your taste...  thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe with a huge amount of flavor; it is easy to make and very versatile. I followed the recipe as stated, except for the following additions. I chopped a medium size onion, a small red, and a small green bell pepper, and sauteed them before I added the rest of the ingredients. I also added thyme and extra garlic, and I used one cup of bread crumbs instead of two. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is probably the best meal I have ever made!! I decreased the  breadcrumbs as suggested, and added chopped spinach, portabello mushrooms, and pine nuts. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again.

I did one thing VERY differently!!  I don't like overcooked shrimp, so, I did  the recipe sort of backwards!  I scooped out the eggplant and then I brushed the shells with olive oil and about t0 minutes before i wanted to serb]ve the dinner I baked the shells!! Then just beforew they were done i did the rest.  Once the shells were done I piled in the cooked BRIEFLY shrimp, basil, wine and chopped eggplant.  This I then piled into the cooked shells and spread  the smaller mix of bread crumbs and parmewsan cheese.  It was wonderful!  The shrimp were not tough.

This was a home run! I enjoy eggplant but always am looking for a way to make it aside from the standard and fattening Italian parmesan. I stumbled upon this recipe and couldn't wait to try. I took the advice of others by doubling shrimp and reducing bread crumbs in half. I didn't use all of the eggplant flesh in the stuffing...left out the especially seedy sections. Sauteed (in 1/4c oil) 1/4c chopped red onion, 1/2c chopped mushroom, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1/4c chopped roasted red pepper (canned), 1c chopped eggplant, 1/2c chicken broth (instead of wine), 16 shrimp chopped and 1/8c fresh basil.  Made sure to add the shrimp at very end so they didn't become rubbery. Used 1/2c parm cheese in stuffing and lite sprinkle on top. Baked for 35 minutes and let rest for 5.  They were delicious and filling.  Served with supreme spinach from AR and garlic texas toast.  Can't wait to make again!

I find it insulting that people can rate a recipe without making it!!!! the calorie intake is obviously wrong! Just make the recipe and then review it , instead of doing the opposite!

Not bad.  I added more than 8 shrimp.  We finished the whole dish but my husband commented that the bread crumbs overpowered the flavor of the dish.

I did the math using Calorie King, and yes, these nutritional info numbers are accurate if you use the full amount of olive oil and bread crumbs, which is where the bulk of the calories comes from (480 and 214 per serving, respectively). But really, 1/2 cup olive oil and 1 cup bread crumbs? I wouldn't use that anyway. I used less than half the olive oil and about 1/3 cup bread crumbs, and I added more shrimp, and this was delicious. I also used regular bread crumbs seasoned with fresh oregano, and about 1/3 cup Parmesan (the full amount is 108 cal per serving). I'd definitely make this again.

Truckerdoo... you rock my world!  I adore eggplant.. any way, shape or form!  And this recipe is awesome!  I reduced the bread crumbs as well.  I added some crabmeat with the shrimp and some mushrooms I had left in the fridge as well as half a pepper that was lying in there too begging to be used up.  I love this recipe and it has become my mainstay for weekends when my kids are at their dads.  Thanks for a great eggplant recipe.

Definately a keeper!  I added a small onion, about 1/3 of a green pepper, and about 4 chopped garlic cloves.  Also used approximately 1/2 the amount of bread crumbs called for.  Next time I will add mushrooms too.

I'm very new at this "cooking thing," ha! But I found this recipe very easy, especially with all the advice from others!! This was very very good, surprised myself! I also did half the bread crumbs, added spinach, portabello mushrooms and a little bit of red onion.  Thank you for the help!

This was pretty good the first time I made it...but it seemed to be lacking flavor. So I made it again and tweeked it by cutting down on bread crumbs and adding more shrimp, chopped sweet onion, diced zucchini, diced red bell pepper, and a little mild ground italian sausage.  I also added an egg to the stuffing to bond it. The extra flavor really kicked it into gear.

It was ok.  I think its a texture thing for me.  It's like when you have too much stuffing (bread crumb) in your crab cakes.  I can hardly  taste the shrimp and eggplant.  Next time..... definitely less bread crumb!!!!

Excellent flavor. To dry and crumbly, could not taste the shrimp and tasted too much of olive oil. My next, I will use 1/2 plain bread crumbs, 1/2 oil, 2x shrimp. saute onion, bell Pepper & celery. Will also add cajun seafood seasoning inlieu of salt&pepper..I will do this again!

I'm gonna give this 4 stars because it inspired me...I'd rate it 3 stars as written, it needs the modifications suggested by previous reviewers such as more garlic (I used 3 cloves ) & shrimp (I used a dozen) , less breadcrumbs (I used 1/2 cup) & the addition of 1/4 cup chopped onion. The recipe doesn't specify how large the eggplant chunks should be, (I made mine about 1" cubes)...even though after baking in the oven, while we really liked the flavor we did not care for the texture...it was all sorta mushy & the shrimp were definitely overcooked. I WILL make this again but will definitely try to improve it next time - I'll let ya know how I do!

Delicious! I doubled the shrimp, used panko breadcrumbs, and added mushrooms, red onion, and a little mozzarella I had in the fridge.  I cooked all the veggies first, and added the diced shrimp last so the shrimp wouldnt over cook.  I added the breadcrumbs and chesses, then put the mixture in the shells and baked for 30 min.  Turned out fantastic.

Usually I think there must be something wrong with a person who gives a recipe a low rating when every other rating is high. I really disliked this. I made it just as the recipe said. It looked really pretty and delicious, but it was mushy and tasted like bread crumbs with basil. The eggplant was a weird consistency and kind of spongey. I supposed I could have cooked it longer, but the cheese on top was warm and the stuffing was cooked thoroughly. It was dry, probably because of the bread crumbs... nice idea, didn't play out the way I had hoped.

My girlfriend made this recipe with some of our home-grown eggplants. She's a big fan of eggplant and she's been looking for more ways to get me to eat them. I have to say, if she keeps making eggplant recipes like this one, I'll be a fan in no time! The flavor of the stuffing was great and the shrimp was a nice added bonus. We have quite a few more eggplants in the garden, so I look forward to eating this dish again!

Fantastic!!  I made a few changes. First since my eggplants were small, I made this a casserole by cutting up the entire eggplant. I first carmelized the chunks of it in garlic and olive oil. Removed from pan. Then added the shrimp. Added this to a casserole dish with all other ingredients plus chopped curly parsley and chopped roasted red peppers. Baked for 20 min. Delicious!!

This was pretty good. I really enjoyed the 'stuffing' part -- the shell of the eggplant wasn't very good to me, but maybe I don't like eggplant as much as I thought. I added mushrooms, onion, and red pepper to the stuffing mixture, and used a little less bread crumbs. That part was really good.

I really thought this was going to be a bigger hit with my family.  I was looking for something different to do.  I thought it smelled really good, and didn't taste bad, but my husband hated the consistency of it. My son wouldn't even touch his half. The slimy texture of the eggplant mixture turned them off.  Of course, I followed the recommendations of all of the other reviewers to decrease the breading by half and double the shrimp, so maybe I should have kept the breading.  I also added extra garlic and onions too.  If it were just me, I'd probably make this again, but due to lack of enthusiasm with the rest of my family, I think I will try some different recipes.

This recipe is really good. I made a few changes that others had suggested. I added mushrooms, onions, extra garlic, 1/2 the breadcrumbs. Instead of stuffing the eggplant shells with the mixture, I peeled and chopped the eggplant and added the mixture to a casserole dish. I sprinkled mozzarella cheese over it and baked it for the specified time.

Made as written with a few changes in the method.  Added the shrimp and the basil later so not to cook too long.  We liked it but thought it could use a kick... perhaps more garlic or a dash of red pepper flakes.  Nice way to use eggplant!

Made this recipe and can agree with the people who did not care for this meal.  It was way too salty with the combination of seasoned bread crumbs, shrimp and parmesan cheese. Also, there are too many bread crumbs.  My family liked all of the ingredients, just not this combination altogether.

Excellent recipe! I took the advice of others and added twice as much shrimp and half the bread crumbs and it was delicious! It's a keeper!

Made this exactly to recipe last night (with fresh eggplant and basil from our garden), and it was quite good. For our taste, next time I will make it with more shrimp and less breadcrumbs (1/4 - 1/2 c). May also put fresh Romano or Mozzarella on top rather than parm. A great dish and a great use for fresh eggplant. Will make again!
This dish pairs well with a light white wine and a small salad.

This was absolutely delicious.  I did end up with only 3/4 cup bread crumbs because I didn't want to open a new canister.  I shredded the parmesan and infused the basil with the olive oil before putting it into a hot skillet.
For all the nay sayers I believe you probably used the parmesan from a canister that would add to the dryness you're all complaining about.
The only thing I would add is some onion to the saute.  Thank you for sharing.

Loved this recipe. I have to admit, I improvised quite a bit b/c I wanted to use ingredients on hand. Replaced shrimp with spinach feta chicken sausages, 1/2'ed the breadcrumbs. Carmelized an onion and some fennel which I layered as a bed under the eggplant. This dish was incredible. Thanks for the idea--despite all my changes, the dish was still largely yours. Yum!

I've been wanting to try eggplant and started looking for some recipes.  This one stood out, especially because I love shrimp.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added lots more shrimp, cut back slightly on the bread crumbs, and added mushrooms and green onions.  I didn't add the seediest sections of eggplant back in.  I thought it was delicious and the shrimp did not seem overcooked to me at all.

Great recipe. I didn't have fresh basil as it jut got killed a few days ago in the freeze, so I used fresh oregano. I also added mushrooms and cut the bread crumbs in half and doubled the shrimp. It was wonderful. One indication it was so good is that my wife ate the entire half and that is a lot of food for her.

Spectacular! I generally dislike eggplant, but I will be putting this into my regular rotation. Like many reviewers mentioned, I minced and sauteed half an onion and used half as much breadcrumbs (1/2 cup). I also used dried basil and added a pinch of crushed red pepper and plenty of onion powder. I''ve started dinner by myself while I started writing this (before my husband is home!) just because it's so good and I can't stop eating it! YUM!

This was very tasty!  Like one other reviewer I added some zucchini and put it in a casserole dish.  I also added about 2 tbs of Greek olive tapenade and about 1/4 cup of feta cheese.  I still mixed the bread and parm cheese and put that on top.  I love eggplant and always look for more dishes like this! I will make this again!

I followed the directions, but added one small diced onion and 3 diced cloves of garlic to the oil with the eggplant.  I also mixed in one diced fresh tomato at the end before stuffing and baking for color and freshness.  This is very good and very much like the stuffed eggplant at the Red Bar in Greyton Beach, FL.

Yum! As other reviewers have said, this is a versatile recipe meaning you can fudge on the ingredients and still enjoy major success. I prepared this recipe as a casserole because it's fast and easy to assemble and it looks nice afterward. Here are some details you might find helpful. Dice a ~1-lb eggplant into cubes and microwave 4 minutes in a bowl/baking pan covered with waxed paper (don't add liquid). Saute 1/2-lb of shrimp (2-3x amount recommended) with basil and garlic in a 5.5-quart sauce pan using only a tablespoon or two of olive oil. Continue with recipe and add 1/2-tsp salt and 1/2-tsp pepper with the eggplant cubes. After mixing the Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs (I used 1/2-cup of Panko crumbs because that's what I had on hand) into the mixture, beat one jumbo egg or two large eggs. Blend beaten eggs into the shrimp/eggplant mixture. The egg will make the ingredients hold together nicely when they're served out of the casserole pan. I spread into a 10" round baking pan and it made a shallow layer. Was done in 15 minutes and ready to serve. (See photo #14)

We altered a lot about it after the first time making it, but we loved it even more!  We used way more shrimp and added the breadcrumbs / parmesan / white wine right into the skillet while the garlic and shrimp and let it cook together.  We also added all of the following: crushed red pepper, parsley, minced onion, and herbs de Provence.  Then, after the eggplants were stuffed, I covered with shredded mozzarella.  My husband adored eating the baked skins.  A "clean plate" recipe!

I doubled the shrimp and garlic, halved the bread crumbs, added onion powder, mushrooms, green pepper, and zucchini. I kept three "whole" shrimp on top as decoration. Flavor still seemed bland to us but the presentation looked great. 2nd try 1/15  I also added tomatoes it added color and flavor.  I didn't use all the eggplant. 3rd try:  I included half a can of diced tomatoes and sprinkled feta on top instead of parmesan. All this fine tuning helps.

i used a food processor to chop the eggplant, which may have chopped it too small.  would try larger pieces next time for better texture.  also agree on cutting back on the bread crumbs

If I could give this wonderful dish more than 5 stars I would.  My hubby said I hit a grand slam with this one.  Only changes I made were based on other reviewers suggestions and my personal preference.  I doubled the number of shrimp, only used 1/2 the breadcrumbs, I added extra garlic and I also added chopped onion.  I will definitely make this again ~ YUM!

Delicious!!!!!! Easy meal that can also be perfect for a dinner party. Flavors are wonderful together. My only suggestion would be to add 1 1/2 times the amount of shrimp if you are a big fan of seafood since they cook up smaller.

loved this recipe-halved the bread crumbs and doubled garlic and shrimp and added a a few siced baby bella mushrooms as suggested-diced the peeled eggplant and roasted it for 20 minutes in olive oil before adding other ingredients and just broiled it for about 10 minutes in a shallow pan instead of baking it -am going to try with couscous or quinoa in place of bread crumbs next time

Except for using double the shrimp I followed the recipe as written. I personally do not understand why so many opted not to use all the bread crumbs. DH & I loved this and we will be adding this to our rotation. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe with us!

I really like this recipe.  It is so good.  Because of what other reviewers had remarked regarding cutting down the bread crumbs by 1/2 I did take their advice and I'm glad that I did, it was absolutely perfect.  I think what really makes this recipe is the sauteing in the white wine.  You can just taste an undertone.  Everything about this recipe is delicious.  While I was eating this I thought what it might taste like with crabmeat and lobster added.  I will be definitely making this for guests.  You have to try this recipe, it is outstanding!!

Made it MOSTLY according to the directions with fresh basil from the garden and Remy Pannier French White wine (cheap but tasty, my first time cooking with wine aside from a splash here & there) the flavor is to die for!  I put alot of salt and about 1 cup of med-small shrimp and a touch of water in the bake ware.

one thing: heating olive over a medium heat and higher oxidized it (breaks it down) so that it loses its benefits and can actually cause what it is said to prevent healthwise. Use Canola or other high heat oil for med-high and higher.
NEVER use corn oil...it is rancid/expired even before it is in the bottle from the processing it goes through. they shouldnt even sell the stuff its so bad

This recipe was good. I used dried basil and omitted the bread crumbs. I added half onion chopped. Overall, it needed more seasoning. Next time will try adding seasoned tomato sauce, and fresh basil like directed in the recipe.

I will try this recipe but if you chop the shrimp and cook them on the stove for 5 minutes they will be done!  To then stick them in the oven for an additional 30 minutes would reduce them to rubber pellets!  I'm thinking I will put them into the stuffing uncooked as 30 minutes in the oven will be more than enough to cook them.

I did like the flavor of the eggplant in this dish. I also tried adding many of the additional ingredients (diced red and green peppers, onion, etc.). However, my family and I felt that this recipe still needs some sort of a stronger flavor to carry it through.

I used the same ingredients, but changed quantities, so can't rate the recipe as written. I used 3 TBSP of olive oil and that was plenty! Halved the parmesan and wine, put in 1/2 pound shrimp and used 2 slices whole wheat bread rather than dry bread crumbs.  Since I can't enter this without stars, I rate MY version as 5 stars.

Tried this tonight- excellent!  As with most of the other reviews I jazzed it up with some onion, garlic, mushroom, and green pepper before stuffing the eggplant.  I also used less bread crumbs than what is called for.  As I was cooking it, another thought occurred to me.  Next time, I will reserve a few shrimp and saute or grill them separately to place on top of each eggplant shell before I bake it- Yummy!!!

This is a great way to prepare eggplant - so rich and filling as a main dish.  I used less breadcrumbs so that they didn't overpower the rest of the ingredients, but I used a little bit more shrimp.  I also added onions and sauteed them for a few minutes before adding the shrimp & garlic.

I made this for my girlfriend and let me tell you, it rocked. I added a little extra cheeses and cut back on the bread crumbs. I also garnished it with a spoonful of marinara.

Awesome!  I did saute some chopped peppers and a little onion with the garlic.  Used my own breadcrumbs and added dried herbs. Only four stars because it is sacrilege to cook both shrimp and basil for so long.  I tossed them in just before putting into the oven. Didn't bother to cut the shrimp, just tossed them in whole. I've made it twice now, and will be sure to make it again.

As written this is merely ok.  Sort of bland, and the shrimp ended up really over cooked.  If I make it again I will cook the diced eggplant, onions and garlic in the oil and wine for 5-10 minutes, then add the shrimp for 1.  I think I would also add diced sundried tomatoes.  I would only use half as much bread crumbs - it was too high of a ratio to the rest of the ingredients.  And I wouldn't bake it as long, to keep the shrimp from over cooking.

This was such a pretty presentation of food that I'd be excited to make it for others. I didn't have some of the ingredients so I made some substitutions and it was still great - I used beer instead of wine, and mixed the cooked shrimp and eggplant with ricotta cheese. I didn't have parmesean but I'm sure that would have made it even better.

This was my first time eating stuffed eggplant, but it will not be my last.  I modified the recipe slighly - using my Ninja, I crushed cashews and added italian seasoning in place of the bread crumbs, I used vegetable broth instead of white wine because that is what I had in the house and I used Vegan cheese to omit the dairy and make it a vegan recipe.  Delicious!!!

This was great I reduced the bread crumbs by half as suggested and add chopped onion. I also baked it longer..90 minutes for very tender eggplant. My carnivore husband loved it.

Very yummy! I did what most reviewers recommended - added more shrimps and halved the bread crumbs (although I used panko bread crumbs as that is all I have).

Mmmm. Mmmm goood!   This was very delicious.  I read several reviews before making it and decided to make it as a casserole because I do not care for the skin of the eggplant. I didn't see where anyone else substituted dried basil for the fresh but I did use a teaspoon of it instead.  I added fresh wild mushrooms and used a Reisling wine and the flavors were just wonderful.  It was excellent.

I had shrimp and an eggplant to use for dinner... allrecipes to the rescue!  I thought it tasted great, and once I got the eggplant scooped out, very easy!  Next time I'll broil for a few minutes at the end to give it more of a crisp.  Also no point in cutting the shrimp up too small, because then you can't tell what you're eating.

Pretty tasty! Easy, too! I used precooked frozen shrimp as that is what I had on hand. I just thawed it, then added it with the eggplant instead of sauteing them with the garlic. It worked out well as the shrimp were not over cooked. I will make this again!

This is delicious!  I use 1/4 of the bread crumbs and double up the shrimp.  I add in a couple heaping tablespoons of pesto along with the fresh basil. If  I'm short on time and /or don't want to turn on a hot oven, I'll skip the baking and serve over angel hair.

This is a meal in itself. I don't think it needs sides of orzo and salad. I served with tomatoes from our garden. This was good, but not as good as I hoped. I added salt and pepper as written, but with the 'Italian" seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan  the end result was too salty for me. Next time I might experment by reducing the breadcrumbs and adding mushrooms and onion. I could not taste the basil at all. The seasoned breadcrumbs overpowered the dish.

4-1/2 stars.... I followed the suggestions of others doubled the shrimp and added onions, mushrooms and celery to the garlic and oil.  Also added the shrimp at the last minute and pre-cooked the eggplant halves.  next time I will use less breadcrumbs and add red pepper for some color.  Great recipe!  Thank you.

YUM! I had to change a few things due to a shrimp allergy. I came across this recipe by searching eggplant because after an unsucessful recipe my family was turned off by eggplant. They are total converts thanks to this recipe! I peeled the entire eggplant and cubed it, added zuchini, mushrooms,onions to compenate for the shrimp. baked in a casserole dish. Used manchega cheese (sheep cheese) instead of parm due to another allergy. it is definately a make again!! I did use less bread crumbs and use spray olive oil on top to save calories.My daughter ate 3 servings love love love it...thank you :)

This was so easy to make. The only thing is I added about 1/3 of a cup chicken broth and put more shrimp and less bread crumbs(only about !/2 of a cup). It turned out so well. My husband has never been a fan of eggplant but after this he asked me to add this to our weekly menu!

4 stars as written, 5 with the minor tweaks from other reviewers. I cut down on the breadcrumbs by half and sauteed onion and green bell pepper along with the garlic and shrimp. Also added a little dried oregano and crushed red pepper, just for an extra kick. Can definitely stand more shrimp too, 10-12 is a better amount. With tweaks, this is restaurant quality and an impressive, but easy meal for guests!

Great idea! I had to try this but was a bit scared by the calorie count. I made a few wee changes and dropped the calorie count to about 240 from the just under 1000 that is noted. I used cooking spray instead of the 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup of water and 1 tbsp bisto for poultry instead of the wine, 2 slices of weight watchers multigrain bread instead of the bread crumbs and only used 1 tbsp of the cheese. I also added some garlic salt, italian seasoning, cracked black pepper, onion powder and some red onion. Lastly, I didn't have any fresh basil so used some minced basil that I always have in the fridge which worked out well for sauteing purposes having not used the oil. I have to say that this meal was DEElightful!! Even my husband commented on how good it was! Thank you Thank you for the wonderful idea!

swtdrms81 is right! This sounded so delicious--couldn't wait to try it out.  It looked and smelled so good, but had an awful taste.  I thought it must be the wine I chose and he thinks maybe too much basil or the eggplant wasn't right. Either way, I did take 2 bites--awful! Please advise because I want to try again.

Oh my gosh, this was SO delicious.  I followed other suggestions and doubled the shrimp and garlic, only used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, plus added 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of thyme, and only used a littl over 1/4 cup of parmesan.  SO wonderful--will make this again and again.

This dish turned out really well.  I used less bread crumbs, and added some mushrooms and balsamic vinegar.  Great dish to play around with.  A bit on the heavy side though.  My boyfriend liked it, although he didn't eat the eggplant "shell".  I served it with green beans on the side.

I made this twice - first time, followed the recipe exactly, except for cutting the breadcrumbs in half and using frozen pre-cooked shrimp.  It was absolutely delicious, but we didn't like the tough outside skins of the eggplant.  Second time, removed the skins, and added spinach and portabello mushrooms, per other reviewers' suggestions.  The skinless eggplants were much better, but I thought the extra ingredients took away from the flavor of the dish.  Next time, I will remove them or else use much less.

This turned out great.  I used 2 eggplants. I started the saute with 1/4 cup onion and a tablespoon bell pepper. After a few minutes, I added the eggplant, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon fresh parsley and 1/2 teaspoon fresh oregano. The shrimp went in after the wine, 2 minutes before the end of the saute. I used 1 cup of regular bread crumbs instead of the Italian seasoned and baked for 35 minutes.  My wife doesn't like eggplant but she ate half of what I made ;)

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and was very disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it just tasted like Italian bread crumbs. I couldn't taste the shrimp, basil, or eggplant. Even my husband, who likes bland food, thought it was very blah. I see in hindsight that most of the people who gave this a 5-star review used far less breadcrumbs, and usually added more shrimp and/or more veggies such as bell peppers or mushrooms. I wouldn't make it again without serious modifications, but then it wouldn't be "this" recipe, it would be a different recipe.

This recipe is wonderful. I did follow a few of the suggestions to decrease the amount of breadcrumbs. I'm glad I did because it still seemed just a little dry. I also added additional shrimp and about 1/2 cup of stewed tomatoes.

I used half the oil and half the breadcrumbs this recipe called for.  It was fine without the extra oil, but I still feel like the breadcrumbs are too much.  The combination of them and the grated parmesan made the dish overwhelmingly salty.  If I were to make this again, I would halve the parmesan cheese and maybe only use one third of the crumbs called for.

Absolutely Fabulous.  This is the best stuffed eggplant recipe ever.  Few minor changes in that I added a mixture of italian cheeses to the top (parmesan, mozzarella, asiago, romano, fontina) but that's it.  Whenever eggplant is in season this is a must make.  Thank you, Truckerdoo!

I added asparagus to the stuffing mix, and topped the finished product off with a red pasta sauce....it was awesome :) Thanks for the good recipe!

This was a great recipe,very good taste. I have also made something like this and I think it tastes a little better with tomatoe(Spaghetti)sauce and melted mozzerella cheese on the top. As a change I have also stuffed red bell peppers with the stuffing. You just need to par-boil the red peppers first, this is great for the people who dont care for the outside(skin) of the eggplant.Also I have done this with salami instead of shrimp, and also added calamata olives and or capers, for the vegetarian version.

I have to agree that the bread crumbs did overpower the taste of the dish.  I added baby portabella mushrooms and spinch and it was devine. If you sautee an onion down with the shrimp and add season all, it really is a superb dish!  It just need a bit of tweaking...

First time I made this, we thought we'd died and gone to heaven! But then the second time came out way too dry and the third time was not the same either.  The only thing I can think of is the size of the eggplant to the other quantities.  I'm not changing the rating thou - it deserves that 5 stars! Thanks truckerdoo! 
Jan.2018- still my go to eggplant recipe! Some tips - if you salt your cubes be sure to rinse - double the shrimp, save half to serve on top whole (cooked in garlic 'n butter) don't chop the rest too fine. Someone mentioned bread crumbs overpowered, try using fresh breadcrumbs instead.  I think of this like stuffing from turkey but it is a whole meal on its own.

Eggplant is so easy to work with, but this recipe really balances some great flavors together. You can use this one as a starting point if you like to experiment.

This pretty much tastes like the stuffing you would get out of a turkey if you were the kind of person who puts stuffing inside a bird.  I'm not a real fan but it was edible and it wasn't too much trouble.  I don't think I'll make it again as there are other things to make with shrimp and/or eggplant that are so much better.

Made this with Ritz crackers instead of Italian bread crumbs and it was great! Would definitely make again. Also, the directions says 35-40 minutes on 350 but it should really be like 375 for 45-50 minutes to make sure the skin and eggplant gets nice and soft and tender.

Made this a few days ago and it was a nice change for eggplant. Was feeding the carnivores so I upped the shrimp a lot, as well as the garlic ( because I always do).  Added the parm to the eggplant mix instead of on top because I don't care for that barrier cooked cheese forms.  And ( just using up fridge stuff ) a bit of jalapeno to the mix that someone had diced and left in a zippy. I also used half the amount of  bread crumbs. I just mixed it all in the skillet and dumped it into the eggplant shell for baking.  It was really good for dinner and the flavors were even better for lunch.....but it didn't look nearly as pretty. Thank you!

I used white eggplant since it suppose to be milder and I did not want to overpower the shrimp.  I didn't have parmesan  cheese so I used asiago cheese instead.  My very skeptical husband and son loved it.

I wish I'd followed the advice of others and cut the breadcrumbs in half and added more shrimp.  The breadcrumbs overpowered what is otherwise a very tasty dish.  The second time around I adjusted the amounts.  I also cooked the shells in the oven about 10 minutes to cook the flesh left in the shells before adding the stuffing and cooking them the rest of the way.  I added some diced onion when cooking the eggplant and garlic and added the shrimp in later to avoid overcooking.

We did not like this at all.  The bread crumbs made it pasty, and even extra oil didn't help.  The flavor of the shrimp was completely lost.

Our garden over flowed with eggplant and finding this recipe was such a blessing.  I followed the recipe as written, BUT added more shrimp and as suggested added them last along with chopped zucchini...super supper will make again.

I have made this two times. The first time was a little dry so this last time I used more olive oil and Parmesan cheese. Last time I used Panko bread crumbs, this time I am using the Italian bread crumbs. I think these little tweaks will make it better for me. Love this!

I cut mine in half and steam cooked it in the microwave.  I cut the breadcrumbs. I tried sticking to the recipe, but when it was put together, it still didn't taste right for me.  Added a little Bay seasoning, sautéed some bell pepper and onion and added that too.  Was better with the added.

Took some of the suggestions of others: decreased bread crumbs, increased shrimp, added chopped onion. Other than that I followed it to a T. It was still a mushy mess. Not sure what I should have done differently.

This was pretty good, but didn't wow me. Yes, changed a few things; but not enough to make my review invalid.  I didn't add the shrimp or breadcrumbs.  'Made it as a side dish, all stovetop.  'Guess it's one of those simple, but good italian dishes.  Put it over pasta maybe - with a little red pepper & more fresh basil.  'Needs a little something else - spices & more vegetables maybe, ones that aren't so soft.

Made this tonight and thought it was wonderful. Followed the directions to the word and it came out perfect. The only thing I didn't use was the basil and it still came out amazing. Very filling also.

SO flavorful, and even the dubious husband polished off what was leftover. Used organic spelt crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs, and turned out excellent. Will be repeated, without changes made.

My husband states it's OK! Tasted like shrimp stuffing. I only added 1.2 c of bread crumbs but to no avail. If there is a next time I will try leaving out the bread crumbs and add several other grilled vegetables with more shimp.

I really enjoyed this recipe and actually so did my husband, who hates eggplant.  The second time I made the recipe, instead of putting the mixture back into the egg plant shells, I  cut up the shrimp and used the mixture to stuff crescent roll dough.  I then baked it according to the directions on the crescent roll wrapper. It made a sort-of samosa and was really quite good.

Excellent and EASY.  I didn't have any basil, so I substituted tarragon and it was super.  Be careful when salting the filling--the breadcrumbs add a lot of salt.  I added too much and it was too salty, but that was my fault.

This turned out pretty good, I had never tasted eggplant before, so not sure what to expect. I used 2 medium sized eggplant, 1 pound shrimp and used just slighly more than 1/2 cup wine. Didn't care for the skin of the eggplant, but the stuffing was really good. Couldn't even tell there was eggplant in it. Just tasted like a seafood bread stuffing. We really enjoyed it.

I followed the recipe  nearly to a T which is rare for me. The catch is that I always make my own breadcrumbs so my Italian seasoned breadcrumbs may not be someone else's Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Also, I had pre-cooked frozen shrimp so I had to change the order of when I added the shrimp in. That said, this recipe ROCKS!! Looking forward to the leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.

This was absolutely delicious. The only thing I did different was reduce the bread crumbs to 3/4 of a cup as I did not want it too dry and then have to add more olive oil. The wine gives it wonderful flavor. I used Chardonnay. This recipe is a family favorite. Will make often. Thank you!!

This was delicous.  I used a lot more shrimp, and cut them up into smaller peices so that they could be in every bite.  I also used less bread crumbs.  It definetly looks fancy and tastes great.

This is a great recipe for eggplant. I followed the recipe to a "T", and was pleasantly surprised. The bread crumbs and cheese give the mix a stuffing taste, but I love it! I served this with parmesan couscous; a great partner!

I added some chopped onion as suggested by others, and thought it came out quite well. I didn't eat the skin as it was a little rubbery and not very tasty. I'd make this again, and I think I'll try adding some artichoke hearts next time.

I followed this recipe except I used a couple pounds of King Crab instead of shrimp. Very bad idea. It came out REALLY fishy. It might have made a interesting crab cake with the eggplant, but next time I'll try shrimp. It smelled great cooking, so I'll try it again.

This is good. I made the following modifications: No shrimp, no bread crumbs, added cream cheese, added diced tomatoe.
