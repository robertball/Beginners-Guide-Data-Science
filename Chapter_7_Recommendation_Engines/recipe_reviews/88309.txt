I give this recipe 5 stars for health and taste. I did not have pastry flour so I used whole wheat flour. I omitted the oil and replaced that 1 for 1 with extra apple sauce, used Splenda instead of sugar and added about 1 tsp of brown sugar. This reduced the overall fat to 6% and calories to 193 per serving (2 waffles). Thanks for the wholesome waffle recipe, will make often.

The only waffles I make anymore!  This recipe is wonderful.   They're not just good for healthy food, they are really really good.  Crisp exterior, creamy interior.  Freeze wonderfully -- I make a batch on the weekends and freeze leftovers, pop in toaster oven and they are perfect.  

My substitutions - regular whole wheat flour instead of pastry and 1/4-1/2 c. of oatmeal for flaxseed meal.  ( I have used both quick cooking and old fashioned.  Both good.  Old fashioned obviously adds a bit more texture)

Can't say enough good things about this recipe!  Try it, you'll love it.

Very Yummy!  I did not have the flax seed meal or wheat germ.  I substituted  virgin olive oil for the canola, and used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour, and a generous 1/4 cup oatmeal. I also added 1 extra Tblsp sugar.  These were great plain!  Kids loved them plain as a snack or meal with fruits or syrup. Yum! Yum!

These are fantastic!  I used all whole wheat flour and applesauce in place of the oil.  Really filling and delicious.  Made the buttermilk syrup recipe from this site - perfect combo.  Recipe only makes six, so may want to dbl. if you want to freeze some.  Thanks so much for submitting this!

Although I've always used a favorite from an old Farm Journal cookbook, this is the best waffle recipe I've ever tried and is now my new fave! My husband started making happy sounds after 2 bites and asked me to put another one on--that is a good sign at my house. My criteria for a good waffle is crispiness and flavor, and this one has both. The fact that it is healthy is a bonus. I didn't have wheat germ so I ground some old-fashioned oats. Great 5-star recipe Mitch103/What A Dish!

I was a little skeptical before making these waffles, but they turned out surprisingly light, filling, and delicious. They freeze well for a healthier alternative to Eggo’s during the week. I train for marathons and have found these to be a great pre- or post- run breakfast. They’re a new Saturday morning favorite.

Light, savory, and very very easy! I didn't have the flax seed meal or wheat germ, so just increased the flour a bit to compensate. And instead of the applesauce, mashed an over-ripe pear.

I had neither flax seed meal or W?W pastry flour so used reg. W/W flour and used oatmeal for the flax.
The mixture was extremely runny so I added extra flour and oatmeal. I still was runny but I tried it just the same and it cooked up nice. I used 1/3 cup of mix per side in the waffle maker. 
The entire family loved them.

Great light texture and very tasty.  It seems I am always doctoring up other recipes to try to incorporate more fiber and healthier ingredients--here's a recipe that is perfect just as it is.

Great! just mede a few alterations ´cause I don´t eat white flour or sugar: 1. instead of the all-pourpose flour I use 1/4 cup quick cooking oats, wich gives a really nice texture 2. instead of the oil, I use 1 large, very ripe banana, sometimes I use 2 bananas, to give delicious flavor, cut the oil and gives the sweetness it needs, no sugar added after these. 3. Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon, you know, cinnamon and bananas goes so well. 4. Even healthier? substitute the eggs for Egg Beatter! I do the batter in my food processor, it´s so quickly.  I love to eat this topped with fruit yougurt and honey, you eat two and get full for the entire morning.

I really LOVE these waffles!  I don't make any changes to the recipe and our whole family enjoys them- even the kids!  It's so hard to believe they are so full of healthy ingredients.  I did find that I have to spray the waffle iron before each waffle, or these will stick- more than the waffle mix I used to use.  But that's not a problem.  I turn the oven on about 200 degrees, and place the cooked waffles in there, spread out on a sheet pan, while I'm finishing up the batch.  This seems to help crispen up the outside a little.  Otherwise, they seem a little too soft on the outside.  The first time I didn't have w/w pastry flour, and they were ok, but they are much better with it. This is the only waffle recipe I will ever use again!  So amazing!  And filling!

Aloha~ we have been making these for about a year now.  1st just as listed, then as a jumping off for creative whole grain blends...I have found it is critical to at least have 1/4c. flax ~ many don't realize flax seed meal help as a 'oil' source substitution, which may be why others have an issue with waffles sticking; also remember if you don't allow the waffles to fully cook (releasing steam) they will stick & these waffles look darker than traditional waffles as flax seed meal & other whole grain/ wheat additions are darker as cooked.  These are so delicious & nutritious!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!  Remember...if you change the recipe~ don't rate it poorly!!

These waffles are very similar to a recipe for "health waffles" that my mom made when I was a kid. They are EXCELLENT! I like them much better than plain old waffles. I didn't have any flax seed meal, so I used cornmeal instead, which gave it a really nice crunch. I added about 1 tsp. of vanilla as well and about twice the salt called for. Since I have 7 children, I doubled the recipe, and it was the perfect amount for my husband and I and the kids. My kids all love waffles, but I think they ate more of these than any waffles I have ever made. They're GREAT! Thanks for posting the recipe!

Followed recipe exactly and loved how these turned out - surprisingly fluffy and moist, not at all overpowered by all the hearty ingredients. I  froze most of the batch and they reheated well after some trial and error on reheating times. I have a belgian waffle maker and found that in order to avoid burning the frozen waffles in the toaster or biting into a frozen center, I had to microwave to thaw/warm and then toast briefly in a toaster with wide slots to restore crispness. But, they remained very tasty even when reheated!

These waffles turned out so light and fluffy!  My daughter and I loved them.  I cut out the wheat germ (because I didn't have any) and swapped the milk for unsweetened almond milk.  I also used grapeseed oil instead of canola and added a bit of honey to the wet mix instead of using sugar.  I then made some raspberry syrup by heating up some frozen raspberries on the stove and stirring in a bit of pure maple syrup.

Yummy!!  As others have said, maybe not quite as crisp as usual, but very good, esp. considering the nutrition.  I subbed a banana for the applesauce and cut the oil by half.  Also used oats in lieu of the wh germ and white flour.  Most importantly I beat my egg whites separately, to stiff peaks, before folding them in.  They were amazing, light and fluffy (despite the ground flax!!)  Thanks, What a Dish, for another great recipe!!

This is one of those delightful recipes that is healthy, versatile, tasty, and LIGHT in texture. I get 5 Belgium waffles out of the original recipe. (wheat germ and flax seed are not the same. One is from the outside of the wheat kernel, the other is ground flax seed. They are similar in texture.) The flax seed gives some oil to help with crispness of the baked waffle. The oil and applesauce lend themselves to substituting other things (banana, sweet potato, potato, etc.) I've substituted the a.p. flour with other flours (including whole wheat)...if i'm short, but I use 1 cup white ww or plain ww as a rule as that's sort of the point of this recipe. I sub ingredients for variety or if I'm short, but this recipe needs no modifications or improvements in our opinion. I use my Misto to prep my waffle iron for the first waffle...then nothing further. No sticking problems. My go-to recipe.

These were soooo delicious!!!  I'm trying to get my family to eat healthier, and these waffles were a big hit with my 2 year old daughter and 5 year old son (not to mention myself and my husband)!  The only substitution I made was using oatmeal instead of the flax seed since I didn't have that on hand.  I used 1/2c of oatmeal and ground it up in the food processor before adding it to the batter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'll definitely be making them again!  =)

Way to much baking powder...I had stomach pains within 10 minutes of eating it and my husband ended up having stomach pains as well. Other than that, the flavor was just ok, they taste just like whole grain waffles, but nothing special. Wish I could give them a better review.

I used to like Belgian waffles........ now I LOVE 'em! What an incredible recipe........ so good I feel like I'm gettin' away with something. Anyone that doesn't like these has either lost their mind or has a palette better suited to Twinkies and Cheetos. I HATE to rate and then offer changes......... but as Martha Stewart once said (okay MORE than once), "It's a good thing." Use whole wheat pastry flour for ALL the flour. Add 1 tsp. of cinnamon and substitute an additional quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce for the oil. You'll never miss the oil. I used Vanilla Almond milk instead of skim........... and it was awesome. As written, this recipe will give you the best Belgian waffles you ever ate. With the changes........they're just a bit healthier. What a Dish is right!!

I made these as written with no changes.  These do have such good flavor, and because they have great nutritional value, you not only feel like you've done a good thing for yourself and your family, but you also feel satisfied and full quickly!  I found I had to keep them in the waffle-iron a bit longer, I suspect, because of the whole grains used.  I didn't have any unsweetened applesauce, so I quickly made some from a couple of Granny Smith apples!  Served this with warmed Blueberry Sauce (from this website).  Thanks for the great recipe, What a Dish!/Mitch103!

I love these waffles!  The texture is so tender, the flavor is so rich, I wish I could eat more of them, but they fill you up fast!  Try with real maple syrup - it makes them even better!

These were a hit! I upped the wheat germ and used less flax as we had lots of one and not so much of the other. Doubled the recipe, and kept a few cups of batter in the fridge 2-3 days. Just whisked again before using. It had discoloured slightly (oils probably breaking down) but the day 3 waffles were still good! Will make again.

This was great! My husband and I are on weight watchers. We substituted the eggs with egg whites, half the oil with applesauce and made these 2pt waffles  =) Which is amazing around our house! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of adding a little cinnamon.  I can't believe the waffles turned out so well!  My kids are in heaven!  edited to add: I now make these all the time, doubling the recipe and freezing the extra waffles for a quick toaster breakfast when we're in a hurry.

Surprisingly good.  My 3yr olds love these and you can't even taste any of the grains.  Substituted 1 mashed banana for applesauce and halfed the oil as others have suggested.  I've also tried adding banana extract to enhance the banana flavor.  I usually double or triple the recipe so I could freeze the leftovers which are as good after you pop them in the toaster.  So convenient and healthier than the store bought kinds.

This is an excellent waffle recipe that I've used many times. I use all whole wheat flour when I make these.  Also, when I cook these, I  double the recipe, cook all of the waffles, then freeze them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper separating the waffles. After a day or so, I transfer them to gallon-sized ziplock storage bags then put them back in the 
freezer.  This gives me healthy, delicious, toaster ready waffles at a fraction of cost of the boxed ones!!!

These were awesome.  I don't have a waffle iron so I made pancakes instead.  I halved the recipe, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, oatmeal instead of wheat germ, ground flaxseed instead of the meal (not sure what the difference is), coconut milk beverage (like sodelicious) instead of milk, stevia instead of sugar, and coconut oil instead of canola.  They were yummy!  Next time I'll try to subbing applesauce for half of the oil.  I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to lower the point value.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe to the "T" - and it was perfect!!!  My 2 teenage sons both asked, "how often can we have these?"  Loved the nutty flavor so much that they really didn't need the homemade blueberry syrup I made for them.  YUMM!!!

These waffles are fantastic... great nutty flavour with the flaxseed... and even better you can't tell that they are whole wheat and so even the most attentive male won't realise how good these are for him... enjoy!

Very hearty, tasty and so healthy for you.  Have made as waffles with Belgian waffle maker and made as pancakes on griddle.  Eliminated oil for pancakes.   Both so very good!

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe, but soon found out I didn't have enough baking powder.  I looked online for substitutions and found that 1 tsp powder can be subbed for 1/4 powder and 1/3 cup molasses.  I tried that, and it is wonderful!  I also used part milk and part dry nonfat milk with water.  Very tasty and wholesome!

I didn't have pastry flour, so I just used plain whole wheat and I used lowfat buttermilk. I did let the batter sit for a bit to help the whole grains soak up some moisture. I've found that if I wisk together the dry ingredients before adding all the wet, then carefully folding the wet ingredients into the dry, I have a better result. I did spray my waffle iron with non-stick spray before adding the waffle batter, only because I saw others had issues with it sticking. The kids ate these up with no complaint. I served them with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, which is also from this site. I did have some leftover, which I will stick in the freezer and just warm up in the toaster for busy mornings.

Excellent recipe, but made a few subs:  1 c yogurt for 1 c of milk, accidently forgot the sugar - I had planned on sub'ing in 2 T brown sugar, added 1 1/4 c frozen berries, 86'ed the oil.  This was really thick batter for me, since I sub'ed in yogurt.  I ended up adding 1/4 c of berry juice to help thin it out.  Very yummy.  Next time, I won't be forgetting the sugar, but the berries kind of made up for it.  Very filling!!  =)  Will definately make again.

Yummy! A little darker than I am used to for waffles but likely due to the fact that I didn't have pastry flour.

These are absolutely amazing.  The only thing I do differently is replace the oil with more applesauce, and throw in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips for my boyfriend.  We both love them!  

They're not very crispy for me, but that's probably because of my ancient waffle grill.  What I do instead is make a double batch, cool them on a wire rack, and wrap them up individually in cling wrap.  I then put them all into a giant ziplock bag and keep them in the freezer until I want to toast one or two up on the morning.  Easily better than the store-bought variety.

You don't understand, my husband and 4 boys, all under age 5, can't stand anything that even resembles anything healthy. But they sure did love these waffles, with no added powered sugar on top, nor any syrup.  These waffles are absolutely delicious.  I made two batches of these waffles, the first batch I made exactlly like the recipe called for.  The second batch I made some slight changes:   instead of the wheat germ, I replaced it with oatmeal, I replaced the white sugar for brown sugar, I added 1/2 cup of blueberries(thawed and drained), and added about 2 TB more of milk to make it thinner for easier pouring.  And I didn't spray or add any oil to the waffle plate.  This second batch didn't stick at all, and they tasted like gourmet restaurant waffles.  Thank you for this healthy and delicious recipe.

I love these waffles! Like others I omitted the oil and increased the applesauce to 1/2 cup, used egg substitute in place of the eggs and added 1 tsp. cinnamon. I have also tried this recipe with 1/2 cup canned pumpkin instead of applesauce and 1/2 mashed bananas instead of the applesauce. The pumpkin waffles were good, but you couldn't taste the pumpkin as much as I would have liked. The banana waffles, however, were amazing! They had a great texture and wonderful banana flavor! My only suggestion for making these waffles without any oil is to make sure your waffle iron is non-stick or greased with a little cooking spray or they will stick. Thanks for the recipe! It is definitely a keeper in my house!!

We all really enjoyed these waffles.  They only required one bowl, cooked up really nice, and were tasty. We did add cocoa to the batter and it does require a sweet dip because there is so little sugar in the batter.  We will be making these again for sure!

I have been making this recipe for several years, at least once a week.  My entire (picky) family loves them.  The texture is amazingly light, and they are obviously healthy compared to regular waffles which aren't nearly as good.  Over the years, I've found that if I switch ingredient brands, they come out differently.  Make these waffles exactly as written.  The best ingredient brand is Bob's Red Mill (they make the whole wheat pastry flour).  I recently used a different brand of flax seed meal until it ran out, and the batter was always runny.  When I buy Bob's flour, flax and wheat germ, they always turn out perfectly.

This is the best waffle recipe I've ever used and super simple.  I love the fact that I don't have to beat the eggs whites to get the crisp outside and soft fluffy inside that I love.  This one is definately a keeper!

Wow! I was completely surprised at how light and crisp these turned out.  I never would have guessed that they are whole grain. My whole family loved them.  Before finding this recipe, the only whole grain waffles my husband would eat was an expensive store bought brand. This is the new favorite.

Fantastic.  Light fluffy inside, crispy outside.  And healthy!  I used 1/4c flaxseed meal, as I thought 1/2c might be overwhelming.  My new favourite waffle recipe.  Thanks!

Okay, I haven't even finished making the waffles and I have to review - these are the BEST waffles!  And they're healthy?  I never would have guessed (and I'm always trying to make things healthy!)  My 5 year old kept stopping playing to come sample the waffles too (and both of us were eating them without any topping).  If I could rate this higher, I would!!!

Delicious!  A few small changes that I made:  used all whole wheat flour (not pastry or white), omitted the oil, left out the wheat germ (didn't have any), and added a pinch of brown sugar.  My hubby and I were very surprised about how good AND healthy these turned out.  The texture is great too, crisp on the outside and fluffy and moist in the inside.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Excellent and healthy!  I live in Uganda where you can't get applesauce so I doubled the oil.  They are great with chopped walnuts, bananas, and powdered sugar on top.

Yummy! I added more sugar and extra vanilla. I used one and a half times the recipe which made five extra large waffles in dad's fancy waffle maker.

Today I made waffles for the first time and I chose this recipe because it was very healthy and I liked the fact that it used apple sauce.
I did not have apple sauce, but I crushed some apples in the blender with a tablespoon of water and half a banana. I used whole wheat flour for the waffles, I and used less oil, and a tablespoon of melted butter.
I was surprised that waffle batter is very similar to pancake batter, so to make it a little bit more interesting, I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the mix. Wow. That made the pancakes crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Everyone loved them!

Had no applesauce, so I used pureed pumpkin for both the oil and the applesauce, and added one TBSP of brown sugar to make up for the sweetness the applesauce would have provided.  These were  filling and delicious, and kid-approved.

Healthy & Delicious! Followed another reviewer's suggestions and used apple sauce for the oil, Stevia for the sugar + 1t brown sugar.  Didn't have wheat germ so used ground oatmeal.  Topped with sliced strawberries and FF whipped topping.  Mother's Day breakfast success!

Great recipe thanks. I made it wheat / dairy free by using buckwheat flour instead of wheat, almond milk instead of skim milk and a mix of rice and arrowroot flours instead of all purpose. I also added a tsp of cinnamon, every recipe should include it. It's not always easy to convert recipes to wheat / dairy free, but this one really works, they baked up nice and fluffly, will definitely make again. Thanks again

These waffles were very hearty and quite tasty. I found the batter to be quite thin though, and the last of the batch were better than the first, after the batter had time to thicken up. I think I would reduce the milk next time or adjust the recipe for buttermilk. These cook up much faster than any other waffle recipe I've ever made, so watch them carefully. The first batch were a little burnt. They do have a lot of flavor, so were good with just some fresh strawberries and a touch of fruit syrup only. Thanks for a healthy and delicious recipe.

Definitely the best waffles I've ever had!!! I replaced the all purpose flour with ww flour, halfed the flax seed (thats all I had) and replaced it with oatmeal. I also used 4 T. of Splenda in place of the sugar. This recipe will replace ALL of our other waffle recipes. Thank you so much for sharing!
UPDATE: I bought more flax seed and used the correct amount omitting the oatmeal, and added 1/4 c. walnuts. I found that reducing the flax seed as I had originally done and adding the oatmeal produced a nicer texture. I also made them with sliced almonds which worked much better than the walnuts. I kept the Splenda the same, since I like a little sweetness to my waffles.

Yummy.  I substituted 1/4 cup blended raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and bananas for the 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and eliminated the tablespoon of sugar.  Also yummy.  Good with butter and honey.

I didn't have pastry flour or flax seed meal so as others I used whole wheat flour and regular cooking oatmeal. I also used an extra teaspoon of vanilla b/c I LOVE vanilla. Family liked them but wouldn't say they raved over them - I'm giving 5 stars b/c I changed the recipe so I feel bad taking a star away. I had to cook a bit extra to get them crispy. I have the basic waffle iron and they might be better with the bigger waffle irons. Overall they were very good.

I have been a "lurker" here for a long time without reviewing recipes, but this one has forced me to chime in. I was afraid that (no offense intended) the people trying this recipe were "health food zealots" who might have forgotten how great "real" waffles taste. Boy, was I wrong! I am not a zealot; I'm just a regular person who is trying to make healthier choices and these are FABULOUS waffles! They have a delicious nutty flavor and superb texture. I have an old, tried-and-true waffle maker that is not non-stick, and I was afraid that these waffles would not cook right, but they came out crispy and golden on the outside and soft on the inside. (I did use non-stick cooking spray.) The only change to the recipe I made was substituting regular whole wheat flour for the pastry flour. Five stars!!

These were the best whole grain waffles I have ever made!  I made the recipe exactly, my 2 year old said "these are yummy mama"  The recipe made 9 servings and they are so packed full of healthy whole grains you don't need more than 1 serving to fill you up.  Here's what you can do with extras, cook them a little lighter than usual, than cool on a cooking rack (very important so they don't get soggy),  wrap each waffle in wax or parchment paper and freeze in freezer bags.  When you want to eat them take them out of freezer and let them sit on the counter for a few minutes, then pop them into the toaster, because you made them lighter than usual the toaster will toast them up the rest of the way.

I never end up liking recipes that use applesauce, so I almost didn't try this one. But I am SO glad I did!  I think my search for the perfect whole grain waffle is finally over!  The waffles were surprisingly light, not heavy at all.

My 4 year old has eaten a waffle every morning for at least 2 years, so I wanted to find a good whole grain waffle (that I could make cheaper than the store brands).  This recipe was SO GOOD just as it is.  But, to maximize the health benefits, I used 2% milk (to give my toddlers a little extra fat), a full 1/2 cup all natural applesauce while deleting the canola oil, used a full 3/4 flax seed while deleting the wheat germ ( I just didn't have any), and adding 1/2 cup puree'd sweet potatoes (this idea from Jessica Seinfeld's "Deceptively Delicious" book).  My kids LOVE them!  And, they are so filling!  They can barely finish one full one when they used to eat two store-bought.  I also double the batch and make them in bulk.  I pop them in the freezer and cook one each morning in the toaster.  A double batch lasts me about a month.  Great recipe!

GREAT RECIPE!  If I could give this TEN stars, I would!  My very picky 4-year-old LOVES these (and all her friends).  Everyone asks for the recipe!  We even have these for dinner sometimes.  I make a double batch and freeze them for a quick, healthy breakfast.  Then I can just pop them in the oven for a couple minutes until they're crispy.  LOVE these!

Fantastic!  My crew loved them.  I subbed ground oats for flax seeds, used ww flour, and whirred the wet ingred. in the food processor to incorporate more air...  they were so wonderful! I doubled and didn't have leftovers.

The first time, I tried to follow this recipe to a "T", but couldn't find the whole wheat pastry flour and just used whole wheat flour. 
The second time around, I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and used a combo of whole wheat and white flour and I found that the waffles had a much better taste and texture. Now it is a family favorite! Thanks.

All the reviews assured me that this recipe tolerated substitutions very, very well. I used *white whole wheat* flour instead of whole wheat pastry flour, and had no wheat germ, so used more of the white whole wheat. The only applesauce in the house was an unopened 50 oz jar, so I pondered the possibilities and mashed up some banana. Two thumbs up!  I've been on a cardiac-friendly diet since I was 39. This meets the requirements and is very good, too!

:-) WOW!!! These are the best waffles I have ever made! Kids 2 & 4 had a great time making them and we all enjoyed them so much! I didn't have the flax seed, so I took the advice of another reviewer and used oatmeal. I also used Splenda in place of the sugar. Overall-This recipe is a definite keeper!!! Thank you so much! :-)

Highly recommended! These don't have a strong flavor, but the texture is great and the lack of a strong flavor means they don't have to be buried in toppings to taste the toppings. In fact, they are excellent with REAL maple syrup, which, to me, has a lighter flavor than the corn stuff (Mrs. Butterworth, Aunt Jemima, Log Cabin, etc)--these carry that light flavor well. They also work well with berry sauces and they are excellent with fresh ground peanut butter (again, they carry the more subtle flavor very well). 

Using the applesauce and sugar variations described below, I prepared these on a 7-inch Belgian waffle maker (slightly under-filled--I don't like the risk of mess it takes to make them perfect) and weighed all ingredients to calculate calories. Each 7-inch waffle was between 195 and 220 calories. Not too bad for a 7-inch carb disk My variations: Canola Oil: 
From here on, I will replace the oil with applesauce. I have used olive oil to replace the canola and I have simply replaced the oil with applesauce (1/4 C to fully replace the oil). I didn't notice a difference. Sugar: I have used sugar and I have replaced the sugar with 1/2 TBS Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and 1/2 TBS Stevia. Again... I haven't noticed a difference either way. (Next time, I'm just going to avoid a sweetener because I don't even pick it up).

These were great!  I didn't have applesauce, so I chopped up part of an apple & used my magic bullet to mash it up. It was still a little chunky, but just added more flavor, IMHO.  I also used all whole wheat flour, and oatmeal, since I didn't have any wheat bran.  Oh, and brown sugar.  Thought they were great!!  Will probably add cinnamon next time for extra kick.

This is a delicious HEALTHIER and kid-friendly recipe.  We added 1/3 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips to the batter.  The kids (4 1/2) gobbled them up, without adding any maple syrup.  We didn't have any wheat germ so we substituted with more all-purpose flour.  Thank you for sharing.

Loved this recipe. I bought all the ingredients because I knew I would be making these over and over. My husband loves waffles and I wanted to give him a healthy alternative. He loves them, as do I. Thanks for the recipe.

Let's just say I altered this recipe a bit and not exactly for the better. It wouldn't stick to my waffle maker. It was also my first time using my parents age-old waffle maker, so maybe I just didn't know what I was doing in the first place. I'm now using the batter for pancakes- I think it will turn out better. They tasted good, but it was crappy that they stuck (like I said it was a contributing of factors that made my recipe fail.)

A great recipe. This is my first review even though I use All Recipes a lot. This recipe warranted a thumbs up. My kids love the waffles; they are easy to make, and they are so healthy. Love, love, love.
I substituted whole wheat flour for pastry flour, and used oatmeal instead of wheat germ. Nothing else was changed.

Made these for my kids this morning. My first attempt (ever) at making waffles, and they love 'em! I substituted the canola oil with coconut oil, white flour with oat flour and the sugar with stevia and they came out great. I'll be making a big batch next time and freezing them up! Thanks for the recipe!

Really good waffle, very satisfying.  I sprinkled on some chopped pecans before I closed the iron, and this was my only change to the recipe.  This is a heavy batter for waffles, and they take a little longer than usual to get brown and crispy, so you may need to adjust the cooking heat to avoid over-browning.  Thanks!

I felt like they were lacking something, but good nonetheless. We ate them both with syrup and with whipped cream and raspberries.

Seriously ~ I don't understand how such healthy ingredients can come together to make such a yummy waffle of perfect consistency ~ but they sure do!  And I made no substitutions...made exactly as written.  Especially yummy when topped with pure REAL maple syrup (which is actually good for you!) ~ THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE & the smiles at the breakfast table this morning!!!  We'll definitely be making these for years to come!

Light and fluffy.  As written, except subst brown sugar for white and left out wheat germ.  Beat the eggs fluffy before adding rest of wet ingredients.  Serve with berries and a bit of real maple syrup.

Great recipe. I was looking for a healthier alternative to standard waffles and this is it. I made a few small adjustments - had no wheat germ so doubled white flour. Will probably try quick oatmeal next time as suggested in another review. Used sweetened cinnamon applesauce because that's what I had. After baking first batch they seemed a little dry so added another 1/4c applesauce and that did it. Everyone loved them.

Update - some helpful notes. I've since also subbed  modifications that make it also gluten free as well as lactose free:
sub soy milk (sweetened or not) for milk
sub oat bran for wheat germ
sub high quality rice flour for whole wheat pastry flour
sub soy flour or other gf flour for all purpose wheat flour(bean flours not recommended though, the taste of that really comes through and this is a rather delicate taste to begin with)

I personally like the soy milk in it better than real milk. These are not very sweet but that is to our taste.  My waffle iron isn't very good, so i pop them in the toaster after i make them sometimes to get them crispy. 
Terrific recipe - we love these waffles, and they are good for you too!  I made the recipe as written with the single exception of soy milk for milk. My waffle maker has a nonstick surface, so we saved on fat and calories there as well. We've eaten these with yogurt and fruit on top, blueberry syrup, and maple syrup; all 3 toppings were delicious with the waffles. Thanks for posting!

Perfect! I made it exactly as listed (skimped on the sugar a little). I was looking for a recipe that would freeze and reheat well, and that I didn't feel bad about serving to my family. This fit the bill perfectly.

I can't believe how healthy and delicious these are! I used canned pumpkin to replace the applesauce and oil, 5 grain cereal to replace the flax meal and whole wheat flour instead of the pastry flour. My family gobbled them up and I can never get them to eat 5 grain cereal! Hooray! Thank you!!

Excellent!  We love these waffles and I won't search any longer for a healthy waffle recipe--this is it.  I used quick oats instead of wheat germ and no white flour, also added cinnamon.  I used basic whole wheat flour, not pastry flour, and they turned out great.

Good basic healthier waffle.  I didn't use any all purpose flour.  I used ww pastry, bean and quinoa flours to add a little protein.  I also didn't use any wheat germ, just added more flax seed in an effort to minimize carbs.  I reduced oil to 1/8 cup and increased applesauce by 1/8 cup.  I also added a cup of black raspberries.  Happily eaten by kids and adults.

Great base recipe.   I made a few basic changes like used egg whites and omitted the oil but upped the applesauce to 1/2 cup.  I preferred using whole flax seed instead of ground.  I will make this again.

Made these just now and they were actually pretty good! I halved the recipe,doubled the splenda,used cinnamon applesauce and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon because for my taste and my 1 & 3 yr olds can't get enough of them! Thank you for such a healthy and delicious recipe.

Great waffles! Necessity is the mother of invention  or substitution. Happens to me all the time.  I used kifir in place of the milk and added a little water -- plain kifir is fine. I also used strawberry kifir and my husband loved the waffles.  I used oat bran and 10 grain hot cereal instead of the flax seed meal.  I eliminated the wheat germ and added a bit more flour.  Comes out perfect every time!

Switched the canola oil for organic coconut oil slightly heated to liquidate, traded the apple sauce for two apples put through the masticating juicer.  Switched the wheat germ for Almond meal, and didn't add any vanilla.  Recipe worked great, and tasted fantastic.

Great basic recipe for healthy waffles!  I didn't have applesauce on hand so I just increased the canola oil.  And I used half a cup of oatmeal instead of flaxseed and pecans (I had no wheatgerm).  Came out delicious!

Excellent. I didn't have wheat germ so substituted oats (not ground but they blended right in once cooked). I didn't have pastry flour so just used all-purpose flour. My only addition next time: a little more salt. Otherwise, great!

I substituted soy milk for skim milk and toasted oat bran for the wheat germ and used 1 1/4 cups white whole wheat flour (whole wheat flour made from soft white winter wheat), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The waffles were delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe whenever I make waffles.

This recipe hardly needs another review but these were wonderful.  I haven't varied from my own healthy concoction in years but was ready to see what someone else had done.  I didn't go totally wheat free as someone had posted but I did use the rice flour in place of the all purpose and I'm sure subbing the buckwheat for the whole wheat next time will be great!   Thanks for contributing such a perfect recipie!

Although I agree that the texture of these waffles is excellent for a "healthy" waffle that uses whole wheat flour and omits butter, it still lacks a bit in the flavor arena, for my personal taste.  I still think it is a good recipe, but wiil likely add an extra tsp of vanilla and substitute 2-3 tblspn of brown sugar for the white sugar next time.

Fantastic! My husband and I were in awe of how many waffles our two toddlers ate! Crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside and not too heavy. I replaced 1/4 cup applesauce with plain organic yogurt and used cinnamon in place of vanilla, since I was out. I also used 1/4 cup freshly milled whole wheat flour in place of the wheat germ. My favorite waffles, ever!!

I was surprised at what a great texture these waffles have. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is pure genious!  So scrumptious!  I substituted low fat buttermilk (I love the flavor of buttermilk).  It turned out so yummy.  My whole family gobbled them up, and I have 2 picky little toddlers!  I topped the waffles with sweet bean paste (made with black-eyed peas and simple sugar) and homemade strawberry sauce.  Such a delicacy!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

I did not have whole wheat pastry flour or flax seed, so I used regular whole wheat flour and quick oats instead. They turned out great! My husband, 4 year old, and 3 year old all loved them too, so I will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I was surprised that the top rated waffle recipe here was a whole grain one.  The only change I made was I substituted oat bran for the wheat germ.  

A keeper for sure.

I thought these came out great. I used King Arthur "White Whole Wheat" flour because pastry flour isn't available here. I used one mashed banana in place of the applesauce - as long as you only use one it doesn't really contribute any banana flavor, and I more often have overripe bananas to use up than applesauce! The wheat flour, flaxseed meal, and wheat germ are not noticeable taste-wise in this recipe, though of course texturally it's not precisely the same as Eggo white flour waffles, but you shouldn't be considering this recipe if you wanted Eggo-type anyway :) Thank you for sharing, What a Dish!, we enjoyed these! (This recipe makes 12 waffles, so the serving size is for 2 waffles per serving.)

These were very good waffles! Added a dash of cinnamon. I had strawberry flavored applesauce, so that's what I used no oil. Added some water & used all whole wheat flour.  Didn't have flax or wheat germ. Yum!  And healthy!

These are nearly guilt free waffles and so good! Some other reviewers said you don't need syrup, which I scoffed at. However, they are pretty good plain and just a little syrup goes a long way! I also tried almond butter in place of syrup for some extra protein and it was great. Like others, I substituted oatmeal for wheat germ because I didn't have it. This is definitely going to be my go to recipe!

This was very good! I make my dad and brothers a waffle and put ice cream and whipped cream on top.. It was good and healthy! (Well, healthier than the store bought ones). I used olive oil instead of canola oil, I used butter instead of applesauce, and I didn't have enough wheat germ or any flax seed meal so I used ground oatmeal for the rest and a little more sugar. Very good!

WOW!  They were a hit even with the kids!  Here's what I did!  I didn't have pastry flour, so used regular whole wheat.  I also used half whole wheat and the other half unbleached flour because I was concerned about them being too heavy.  I also added a dash of cinnamon!  THEN!  Here's the AWESOME part that helped the kids to enjoy them!  I put out into bowls sliced banana's, dark chocolate chips, slivered almonds, blueberries, natural peanut butter. (You get the idea!)  I laid a layer of batter on the iron, let each person put their own 'fixins' on then put another thin layer of batter on top so that it because 'stuffed' AND so that it wouldn't stick to the top of the iron!  They are a HUGE hit in our house now!  My kids have NO IDEA that they are healthy!  Oh!  And when I doubled the batch, I had each person make two of their choice....this way I can freeze one and have a nice hearty breakfast this week!  One of the kids made peanut butter, chocolate chip and called it a reeses waffle!  (remember, it's dark chocolate and natural peanut butter!)  My hubby preferred plain blueberry but MY fave was the natural peanut butter, sliced banana & slivered almonds!  The peanut butter became all gooey in the center and the bananas kept the whole thing real moist!  Plus they were already on the sweet side, so I only DRIZZLED natural maple syrup on top! But it wasn't even necessary, really. If they weren't so filling, I'd have eaten both of mine in one sitting! THANK YOU 'What a Dish'!!

This is such a terrific, healthy recipe just as it is. I am traveling next week to OH to help my daughter out with my new grand daughter and before I go, I'll be mixing the dry ingredients into a jar to take with me for a couple of great breakfasts!

These are great!  Tried them out when a friend was over and she said they were the best waffles she'd ever had.  My homemade syrup helped, but she was very impressed that super healthy waffles could taste so good.  I used all whole wheat pastry flour, forgoing the all purpose flour.  Because I didn't have the flax, I left it out.  Used the 2% milk we have on hand.  This batch made enough to eat and freeze, which is perfect for us.  Now I can take a couple out and pop them in the toaster for a quick meal or snack.   Can't wait to play with the recipe some--maybe use babyfood peaches or something instead of applesauce, add finely chopped nuts for even more protein, throw in cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger...

Everyone liked the just fine. A great alternative to the frozen kind. And soo much healthier. I thought the kids would balk when seeing they were whole wheat but they gobbled them up. Next time I'll make a double batch and freeze the leftovers for easy quick breakfasts. Thanks for this healthy delicious recipe.

This recipe was fantastic. I'm always tweaking recipes for additional health benefits especially if undetectable by the family.  I used extra virgin coconut oil for the oil.  Not only do you get the health benefits but it adds a nice almost undetectable flavor unlike canola oil which adds nothing to the flavor. I used stevia for the sugar and a dark amber agave nectar for the syrup.  Amber agave has a maple syrup flavor unlike the lighter color agaves. For those unfamiliar with Agave, it is a natural plant product that has a low glycemic index, safe for diabetics.

I don't hand out many five-star reviews, but this is undoubtedly a five-star recipe. These waffles are effing righteous, especially with blueberries added to the batter. Pair it with some veggie bacon and a glass of juice, and you'll be gettin' your breakfast on PROPER. Healthy, too.

Holy , these were awesome!  I substituted oat bran for the wheat germ, added 1/4 cup of steel-cut oats (instead of oatmeal, like one person suggested), a handful of bulgar wheat (just because)and some freshly-grated nutmeg.  I might play with these a little and add things like banana, grated carrot, walnuts, sweet potato, etc etc.  My 10 month old loved them!

These waffles are fantastic!  My husband and five children all loved them.  I made them just like the recipe stated except that I separated the eggs and whipped the whites, then folded them in at the end.  They were so light and fluffy and such a nice nutty flavor.  We served them with fresh strawberries and whipped cream and skipped the syrup, Yummy!

Made these for breakfast this morning and they were excellent.  They had great flavor and were so crispy and light at the same time. My kids wanted seconds so I know they were good!  The only thing I changed was using oat flour in place of ww pastry flour as I was out.  Will use this recipe again and again.

Great job, "What A Dish!" Really wonderful! The kids loved them. I was out of applesauce, but pear-strawberry baby food worked perfectly. I bet other fruit purees would be worth trying! I also doubled the vanilla, and light olive oil was an indetectable stand-in for canola. Serving size is off, though: 5 of my young kids inhaled the single recipe, and I had to whip up another batch. Serving size is three at the most. Final note: I needed to GENEROUSLY oil my "non-stick" Belgian waffle iron; cooking spray on my iron is not enough   =)

***EDIT:  This is "my go-to" waffle recipe now.   I just wanted to mention that I don't decrease the amount of milk anymore.  As others have stated, this makes a thin batter, but after it sets (while your first waffle is baking) you 'll notice  that it has thickened up considerably and will be sorry to have decreased any liquid.***  This is just a super waffle recipe.  Judging from other reviewer's comments it seems to be able to withstand any number of alterations.  I stayed pretty close to the original recipe only substituting a banana for the applesauce and adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I  turned my waffle iron up one notch as some others had mentioned that the finished product didn't come out as crispy as they would have liked.  I think the next time I'll add some ground nuts to the batter just because I love them!  I froze our leftovers and warmed some the next day by defrosting about 20 seconds in the microwave and then rewarming in the waffle iron on a low setting.  They tasted just as good as they did the first day.  I don't think I'll ever make plain waffles again!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had a recipe for waffles that I didn't think I could top, but I like this one even better and it is healthier too!  My whole family loved these, even my anti health food husband! These were so good topped with fresh peaches and blueberries.  I made these changes to the recipe: I seperated the eggs and whipped the whites with a pinch of cream of tarter until they formed stiff peaks and then stirred the whites into the mix at the very end.  I replaced the applesauce with a mashed banana which gave these a great flavor. I substituted white all purpose flour for the whole wheat pastry flour because I wasn't sure what pastry flour was, I added 2 T cornmeal and took away 2T of the flour.  used 1/4 cup of oatmeal in place of the all purpose flour.  I substituted 2-3 T honey for the sugar.

Awesome!  Our kids love these healthy waffles.  We make a double batch and freeze.  We pop them in the toaster for a quick breakfast.  Love these!

I made a quick blueberry sauce to go on top.
Easy.  And they freeze very well, too!

These are a great alternative to the standard waffles.  Delicious and good for you - doesn't get much better than that.  We topped with fresh cherries and with fresh strawberries, both made into a chunky sauce by adding a little sugar and some water mixed with cornstarch in a saucepan.  Thanks to the contributor.

Great recipe!  I replaced the 1/4 cup all purpose flour with 1/4 ground oats.  I didn't have any whole wheat pastry flour on hand so I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup pastry flour.  I also used 1/4 cup melted butter instead of the canola oil.  Simple to make!

This is a keeper. They came out light and crispy, and my husband and kids loved them.  The only change I made was to use soy milk instead of skim milk.  We had them with sliced fresh peaches, toasted pecans, and maple syrup.  Delicious!

These were surprisingly moist and  had a fantastic flavor. Not to mention they come with less "guilt" because they are full of good ingredients.

Turned out fabulously and disappeared very soon! Makes just under  4 sets of 4 waffles on my trusty old cast iron Viking wafflemaker. 
Used mashed banana instead of applesauce and substituted ground-up oats for flax and wheat germ. I blended the banana  to keep from having small lumps...no-one realized the waffled had banana!

This is a good recipe for an easy healthy waffle.  If you're not used to having flax seed you might not like that part of it (my daughter wasn't into it- she said she prefers "white" waffles).  That may have also had something to do with the fact that I sub'd a cold latte for the milk!  But I loved how simple & quick it was to make the batter, they are tasty (to me at least!) and filling.

This were the best waffles I've had (other than that famous chain)!  I did adapt them to what I had on hand, but they were excellent - extremely tasty.  I also made a blueberry sauce to go on top.  Scrumptious!

On previewing the recipe and seeing "Serves 6", I doubled the recipe for our sometimes ravenous children. 

These waffles are REALLY filling! 
I followed the recipe and used all ingredients listed. 
The batter rose nicely in my 8" by 9" waffle maker.  
The double recipe produced about 6.5 full 8x9 waffles. 
I had leftovers! The extras were cooled on a rack, and will be frozen for toaster waffles...  WAY cheaper than the pre-packaged ones, and far more satisfying.

Great recipe. I wanted to wean my daughter of egos with something healthier. I made this but substituted more canoloa oil for the apple sauce and whole white wheat all purpose flour for the flax seed meal, wheat germ and half of the pastry flour. I also added just sprinkle of cinnamon that I swirled into the batter to give that amazing waffle smell and taste. She loved these and said they were much better than the store bought waffles, so it all went much better and smoother than I anticipated!

Very tasty! Moist and not too dense. I used mostly applesauce for oil and used all whole wheat pastry flour. I also used oat bran instead of wheat germ. I tried the following flavor combinations, mixed into the batter: pb + dry-roasted peanuts, raspberries + mini chocolate chips + fresh lemon zest and juice, mashed banana (be careful because too much will make it mushy) + chopped banana + cinnamon, and dried cherries + toasted walnuts. The peanutty one was a favorite!

These were incredibly filling and the kids gobbled them up.  The batter was thin to begin with, but after a few minutes the flax worked its' magic and the end result was perfect.  It's hard to explain how they were so light and filling at the same time, but they were!  I subbed whole wheat flour for pastry flour with no problem.

I am so happy to have a healthy waffle recipe that tastes fabulous too!  I made this for my two teenage daughters and it got rave reviews from both of them.  I had blueberry applesauce, so used that.  It gave them a nice blueberry scent, but it wasn't recognizable in the waffles

Wow! These waffles are absolutely amazing. My two preschoolers wolfed them down. My husband usually complains when I make anything with whole grains, but even he admitted they were really good. I didn't use any canola oil -- just used applesauce in its place and used half white sugar and brown sugar.

I used 1 mashed ripe banana instead of applesauce, vegetable oil instead of canola oil, 1 1/4 50/50 whole wheat/white flour instead of 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 cup all purpose flour. Processed 1/2 cup of flax seeds in spice grinder to replace flax meal. 3 TBLS Splenda. and a dash of almond extract to enhance the "nutty" flavor. Baking powder is key to the fluffy texture.
Freeze left overs; they toast up beautifully.

I haven't been able to get flax, whole wheat waffles past 4 picky kids until now.  I cheated and added 2tbsp of cocoa just to hide the darker color of the wheat and flax. Bam, they ate them up! Super crispy and delicious. I put the left overs in the freezer and they toast up beautifully the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are very flavorful waffles.  I used applesauce in place of the oil and since I didn't have flax seed meal I used oatmeal (as other reviewers suggested).  These were great!!  I recieved a waffle maker for Mothers Day and have been looking for a whole wheat/whole grain recipe to try.  My only complaint was that they weren't crispy.  that may be my fault -- still learning how to use my first waffle maker.  Don't know what I'm doing wrong.  These were great and we had plenty to freeze for later -- I'm sure they'll be crispy from the toaster! :D

This is an excellent, tasty, easy recipe. We are trying to modify our diet to more healthy choices, and this is so good, the kids don't even know it's good for them. Top with strawberries or cashew butter instead of syrup for a change of pace. THANKS!

These waffles are a staple in our home.  I've been making them at least twice a month for the last year.  I don't use whole wheat pastry flour so I use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup regular flour.  When I don't have applesauce on hand, I substitute plain yogurt.   Update - 4 years later and we are still making these waffles.  I've learned that I can substitute all the wheat pastry flour with whole wheat flour. 
 Because its heavier, I reduce the wheat germ to 1/4 cup and increase the white flour to 1/2 cup.  This is our favorite waffle recipe!  During the fall, I have added 1/4 cup pumpkin, reduced the oil to 2 TBSP, and added a tsp of cinnamon for a seasonal flare.   Thank you for sharing it!

Delicious! Will put this in my regular breakfast rotation! I made similar changes to those suggested: swapped out the canola for applesauce (making it 1/2 c applesauce and no canola oil), swapped old fashioned oats for flax (didn't have flax), used wheat bran for wheat germ and whole wheat flour for the whole wheat pastry flour. Also, instead of 1T sugar, used 2t Splenda and 1 t brown sugar. Sifted flour for added fluffiness. Batter slightly too runny so would start with 1 and 1/2 c milk and add a bit more as needed to thin it down.

The texture and flavor of these waffles is excellent: much better than other whole grain recipes I have tried.  I do 100% whole wheat flour (freshly ground), and don't think it's necessary to put in any all-purpose flour.  You can also sub yogurt or mashed banana for the applesauce if you don't have any applesauce- it won't change the flavor or texture much, and it still tastes great!

OMG!!! These are fabulous!!! I didn't have unsweetened applesauce so omitted the sugar in the recipe, replaced the canola with citrus infused olive oil, an extra 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour instead of the wheat germ. This is so going to be a regular for me!!!

I have just recently ventured into the world of "flaxseed meal" and "wheat germ" so I was a little hesitant but, oh man, am I glad I tried these! These are amazing - so good, I even eat them without any syrup. I did make a huge batch and froze them for quick weekday breakfasts. Thanks!

Very tasty!  We all enjoyed them very much!  I exchanged wheat germ for wheat bran because I thought I was out of germ (I wasn't, I saw later, but it tasted fine).  I'll make again!  I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour so I did 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. white flour.

YUMMY, EASY, FAST!  I did substitute teff flour for the flax seed meal, and regular whole wheat flour but can't be that different.  I cooked them in our belgian waffle maker and they came out so light and fluffy for a whole wheat product!  I originally tried for high protein snack food for my daughter but I love them and will be my new go to waffle recipe!

Just made these and they were delicious!  I did add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds but followed the recipe otherwise.  I will make more and freeze them for easy breakfasts.  I put peanut butter, cinnamon, and raisins on them.  yum yum

Awesome!  I used 1% because that is what I had, skipped the wheat germ because I didn't have any, and used blueberry unsweetened apple sauce as that is also what I had.  Will double the recipe next time to freeze some.  Made 10 waffles.

Recipe trifecta: healthful, tasty, and my kids love them! This s now my go-to waffle recipe. I make a double batch on the weekend and freeze the leftovers for quick, easy weekday breakfasts, topped with peanut or almond butter and honey.

I don't know if Wheat Bran is the same thing as Wheat Germ, but all I could find at Kroger in Durham NC was Wheat Bran. I made this recipe with that substitution and it came out great. 

My wife is hypoglycemic but she has a huge sweet tooth. This recipe plus the Honey Apple Topping recipe satisfied her craving.

These were wonderful!  Yummy and great texture.  I didn't have wheat germ so I upped the flax a little and put another tablespoon of flour in it.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much my picky kids and husband loved them!  My 7-year-old asked if I could make them every weekend.  Served with fresh blackberries and maple syrup.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

Made these for a toddler group this morning, and served them with vanilla yogurt and strawberries.  They were a bit hit!  The only change I made was using ground oatmeal instead of flax meal.  The kids were gobbling them up.  Thanks for this great healthy recipe!

Fantastic recipe! So easy and SOOO good! Surprisingly light and fluffy on the inside, but crisp on the outside. Perfect! My whole family loved them. Will definitely make again and again.

I had every intention of following the recipe exactly, but ended up adding 1 tsp of cinnamon, and accidentally forgot to add the 1 tbsp of sugar. They were still perfect. I didn't have to oil the waffle maker, it's non-stick.

This was the best waffle recipe I've found. I used two very ripe bananas instead of the apple sauce and oil. It was only because I didn't have the other two on hand. Turned out great. My son who is a picky eater had seconds.

These have a fabulous flavor - some of the best I've had in any waffle, anywhere.  Unfortunately, the texture just isn't right.  They're too soft and don't get that crispy exterior that a waffle should.  Even when I set my waffle maker to a high/dark setting they don't retain the crispiness normally associated with waffles.  Love the flavor, but I almost wonder if it would make better pancake batter than waffle batter.

These were REALLY healthy! I took the batter and used it for pancakes and they were delicious. I also substituted the oil for more applesauce to make them healthier still.

Over the top good!!  No wheat germ or flax, I used 1 cup un bleached non bromated all purpose flour, unrefined coconut oil, and evaporated cane juice for the sugar, and added 1/2 cup of frozen wild blueberries.

This was a great recipe.  I grind my own flour and I changed it up a bit.  I used 1.5 cups buckwheat and the rest whole ground wheat flour.  Since ther are no buckwheat waffles on Allrecipes, here's the 1st!

I didn't have pastry flour so used whole wheat flour instead. Other than that I followed recipe exactly. Flavor and texture were great. I will freeze leftovers and use later which is another great thing about this recipe. Thanks for the recipe. We will enjoy this often in our home.

Best waffle recipes and healthy for you!  You will not go wrong if you try this exactly the way it is.  If you want a softer waffle, increase the applesauce a bit.  I love it the way it is!

Without a doubt, the best tasting waffle I have ever had. My daughter who is not a breakfast eater will eat them plain as she walks to school. They have such a nice flavour they don't even need a sweet topping.

WOW!!!  I am REALLY REALLY impressed.  These are great, I was not really sure what to expect, but these went beyond my expectations!  The whole wheat pastry flour really helped to make them light and tender!  I was making these to have with breakfast with yogurt, nuts and dried fruit...can't wait to try it!

I prefer these to regular waffles! I used melted margarine instead of the oil and whole wheat flour instead of pastry flour, I used oat bran instead of wheat germ. I added a handful of chocolate chips :) delicious and fluffy!

I made these this morning with my toddler. Easy and quick to put together. I add bee pollen granules for extra health. And an extra egg because my batterr was too thick...perhaps it was because didn't use pastry flour but instead ww all purpose flour. Otherwise all directions followed. Now I am experimenting by cooking the batter in my moulinex panini press...they came out like panini pressed pancakes...tastes relish but not a risky waffle! Five stars for a wonderful recipe...and I just found out a new way to cook light fluffy pancakes. Awesome!

As written I am giving this 4 stars as it's such a good start but my husband, who eats whole wheat bread but is mostly "healthy food averse" said they had a funny taste to him.  I'll bet it's the whole wheat and germ, which happily comes through for those of who like the taste of the whole wheat.  Next time I will try the previous recommendation to increase the vanilla and perhaps add cinnamon as another suggested.  Maybe a bit more sugar?  Still a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband, who generally just tolerates my efforts to feed our family more whole grains exclaimed, "These are the BEST waffles I've ever eaten"!  The rest of the family agreed!  This will be our waffle recipe from now on!

These waffles were heavenly! I don't think I will every be using a different waffle recipe. The only change I made was to use applesauce in place of the oil just because I was short on oil and it didn't change a thing. I would definitely recommend these waffles to anyone!

These are great for how healthy they are! Surprisingly light and crisp. I mixed a double recipe in a 2L juice pitcher for ease of spreading on the waffle iron. I added some blueberries, and subbed bananas for the applesauce.

Absolutely fantastic! As a previous reader said, the batter is runny but it needs to be that way. The runny batter+baking powder=light and fluffy waffles. We added chocolate chips and they didn't need syrup. My boys are very pleased.

These were so yummy!  All the kids, from 11 months on up, enjoyed them.  I did increase the ratio of applesauce to oil, and beat the egg whites before folding them into the batter.  I noticed that these stuck to the waffle iron more than my regular waffles - a quick spray of oil before each waffle was poured on took care of that problem.

No wonder this recipe shows up at the top of the list when you search by rating for waffles; they are outstanding!  My waffle loving husband repeatedly commented on how much he loved them and I have to say that, even though I am ordinarily not a huge waffle fan, I thoroughly enjoyed them as well.  My plan had been to freeze leftovers for hubby’s breakfasts during the week but we finished them off before any made it to the freezer.   Not having any wheat germ on hand, I subbed organic oven toasted oats that I pulsed in my food processor to the texture of wheat germ.  I also had to sub King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour for the pastry flour.  We tend to prefer whole grains and use them often, but these waffles have a wonderfully crispy crust and are light and flavorful enough that I believe even the whole grain phobic will love them.  Excellent, excellent, excellent recipe!

These were surprisingly amazing! I substituted egg beaters, agave for sugar & rolled oats for wheat germ bc I didn't have any of the later. Will definitely return to this recipe!

My husband and my niece loved these.  I think I was more in love with the idea of them.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have applesauce- I make my own and didn't have any I just doubled the oil.  I didn't have flax meal just flax seeds- my husband says you loose nutritional value when they are ground?  I used only a 1/4 of the seed.  My husband loved the texture difference, me, not so much.  I also think the next time that I might up the vanilla a little bit and maybe the sugar.  I also didn't oil my waffle iron because of the added oil in the batter.  I had a little sticking, but it was manageable.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is great!  I love buttermilk waffles, so I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and decreased the baking powder to a rounded 3 1/4 tsp and added a rounded 3/4 tsp baking soda.  I also used 1/2 cup canola oil and omitted the applesauce.  Oh, and I used 2 Tbsp brown sugar instead of 1 Tbsp white sugar.  Delicious and nutty and healthy!

Great. You can use oatmeal if you don't have flax. Today I used almond milk instead of skim milk and pumpkin instead of apple sauce. Still great!

Good, filling, very similar to nutri-grain eggos, but not great (or maybe I should re-word - not what I was looking for). I substituted one mashed banana for the oil and apple sauce, and oats for the flax. Were not really crispy out of the waffle maker, probably b/c of the banana, but can easily crisp up in the toaster oven. Would have rated 3.5 if could do .5, so rounded up due to my substitutions.

I feel it is important to state that I am new to eating healthy. The reason I want to mention that first is because I've been coming across a lot of healthy recipes that are given good ratings and when I try it, Im gagging. Ive chalked this up to the fact that the people who enjoy it must be used to eating a cardboard diet, lol. I am a wife and mother of three, transitioning my family to a healthier eating lifestyle so this recipe is the first we have tried for waffles being as though we are primarily Eggo people. Now that you understand my palate, let me say this: THESE WERE DELICIOUS!!!!!! If only everything with flax meal and wheat germ tasted this good. I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand: I used sweetened apple sauce, almond milk instead of regular, spelt flour instead of the whole wheat and all purpose (just subbed it cup for cup) and cane sugar rather than white. Mmmmmmmmm...my 6 year old is standing here asking if his is ready yet, so I gotta run!

Best Whole Grain Waffle recipe I've found! I like to make a big batch of the dry ingredients and store in a ziplock bag for a fast breakfast in the morning. This recipe makes a very light and flavorful waffle.

I LOVED this recipe!  I have been trying to find healthier alternatives for the whole family to enjoy and this was great!!!  I just made it this morning.  I didn't have the flax or the wheatgerm so I used whole wheat flour and all purpose flour.  Not sure if that's why it turned out so thick, but since it did I had to use a bit more milk increasing it to 1 1/4 cup.  Also I used powdered milk instead as a way to cut down on fat and to save on the real milk in the fridge.  It never seems to make a difference in the taste.  Also, to make the batter a bit lighter and fluffier I separated the yolks and whites of the eggs.  When mixing I added the yolks as stated in the first part of the mixing directions and set aside the whites until everything was mixed.  Then beat the egg whites until they fluffed up and gently folded them into the batter.  As a healthy alternative to syrup I topped mine with reduced fat margarine, a tablespoon of almond butter, a tablespoon of vanilla yogurt and sliced strawberry.  Next time I will use the flax and wheat germ and instead of the tblsp of sugar will use a tblsp of honey as it is a bit healthier.

EVERYONE IN MY HOUSE LOVED THEM. I thought they needed more sugar. They weren't sweet enough for me. But it is a good recipe for healthy waffles. I also used ground oats instead of flax seed meal.

Very good for a healthy waffle recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, used all the ingredients called for, except I used regular WW flour instead of pastry flour and whole milk instead of skim milk.  Delicious!  And my picky husband liked them too.

Excellent waffles.  I replaced wheat germ with equivalent amount of oatmeal.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Will definitely make again.

These are great. I used just regular whole wheat flour and used unsweetened peach medley appleasue (one of the little snack containers) which was more than 1/4 cup so I measured it out and then added the oil to make the difference. I did have to add 1/4 cup more WW flour to make it less liquidy. I also added fresh blackberries. The flavour is really nice and they came out nice and fluffy. They smell amazing cooking. I plan to freeze the rest to eat at my leisure. Thanks for the great recipe. Since I now have huge bags of wheat germ and flax seed I will make again!

These were very good for being whole grain, although I felt that they could be improved with a bit more salt.  I made these waffles exactly as written, and those in my family who are a bit more health-conscious enjoyed them. Those who don't care a fig about health thought they had too much flax...I would have to agree that the flax specks did get stuck in your throat, which was rather annoying. I also found the batter to be a tad runny...I added some quick oats to the mix and it was perfect. Plain, these waffles weren't that great, but they tasted wonderful with a little butter and syrup or jam. I would make these again...thanks for sharing!

These were great! I only had oatmeal, so used that instead of the flax seed and wheat germ. It worked out nicely. I just grinded up the oatmeal and it came out fine. Will definitely be making these again!

My 7 year old LOVES these...eats them plain.  I've made these 4 times now and the only thing I have changed is a bit more vanilla and the addition of a little cinnamon.  After cooking, lay them flat on a cookie sheet to freeze, bag 'em and Eggos will be a thing of the past! Today I am making and freezing a couple batches in preparation for the upcoming school year.  These are very hearty...1 waffle fills her up.

These are a great way to get protein in your breakfast. I substituted soy flour for the all purpose flour to give it an additional protein boost, and thought the recipe was great! We made a double batch so we could freeze some for another day.

Very good. Followed the recipe exactly. Second time, made it with chocolate milk and for the same batter, added some chocolate chips to make pancakes.

Love them!  These waffles are so light and fluffy, despite all of the grains in them.  Definitely use aluminum-free baking powder.  I have made pancakes with regular baking powder and there is a metallic taste.  I used aluminum-free this time and they tasted great!  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon (I swear I can't make waffles or pancakes without cinnamon anymore - it's so good!).  I used regular whole wheat flour (couldn't find pastry flour).  And don't forget the cooking spray.  Highly recommend!

These are great!!! They are easy, filling, yummy, and healthy! I added a coupe of tsp of cinnamon but other than that stuck to the recipe and they were wonderful. My husband loved them, as well as my sister, and my one year old too. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

My 7 kids, husband and I LOVE this recipe. We now make a triple batch and toast the leftovers the next morning. I had to substitute mostly white flour today, and it's really much better using the whole wheat.

This is the best waffle recipe I have used. I was looking for a healthier version and tried this one. The waffles were wonderful. My entire family enjoyed them. I can't eat eggs so I used a substitution of 2 Tbsp water & 2 tsp baking power per egg and it turned out wonderful.

Wonderful easy waffles that are good for you too?  And they taste great?  What is not to like about this recipe.  I used whole wheat flour instead of the wheat pastry flour and oatmeal instead of the wheat germ.  I let the batter rest in the fridge for about 45 min. before cooking them.  This is my new waffle recipe.

My children did not care for these waffles.  I think it may have been the applesauce in them, but I'm not sure.  They usually eat whole wheat stuff, so I don't know why they didn't like these.

I added blueberries to this recipe and I don't think it worked out.  The waffles didn't come out light and crisp on the outside.  They tasted pretty good, could really taste the flax.  I prefer a different texture to my waffles.  These ones were kind of limp.

I loved these waffles! They were full of flavour and really healthy. I doubled the batch (which ended up making wayyy too much for future notice..) and used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites and only used half the amount of oil and substituted it with more applesauce. I also used olive oil instead of canola for added health benefits. Will make often as my waffle regular waffle recipe! I made the fast blueberry sauce from this website but used mixed berries instead of just blueberries.

I was so pleasantly surprised at how good these were! I am trying to wean myself away from white flour. What a great example of how food can still taste delicious yet be healthier. I couldn't get as good of a crunch as I do with Bisquick but they were still darn good! Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I've made it a couple of times now and have found it to be very adaptable.  One time, I added cinnamon and nutmeg and used cinnamon applesauce instead of unsweetened (I did cut back on the amount of sugar I put in though).  The smell was heavenly.  Another time, I didn't have applesauce on hand so I used mashed bananas and added finely chopped pecans for a "banana nut waffle"...yummy!  This recipe is a keeper and my family loves this healthier waffle!

I was so wonderfully suprised by this recipe!  I printed out the recipe a few days ago and have already made 3 batches (one for the freezer)!  My kiddos (ages 1 and 4)and husband loved them as well.  And, I feel really good feeding my family a healthy alternative!

These were really yummy!  I love the nutty flavor & texture.  I made the following changes: halved the oil and added 1 mashed banana, added about 1/3 c chopped walnuts, 1 tsp cinnamon, and about 1/3 c semi sweet chocolate chips to appease hubby!  Delish!  I also used all whole wheat flour.

Pretty good, my 5 year old liked it!  I I used oat bran instead of flax seed. and used Splenda instead of sugar.

Tried this recipe this morning, only substituting quick oatmeal for the flax seed meal that I did not have. Tasty and healthy! Thanks for the recipe! Freezing leftover waffles to enjoy at another time.

Wow! These were so good. I made just a couple of changes: I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil because my wife is allergic to vegetable oil. I used an extra quarter cup of wheat flour (didn't have wheat pastry) instead of wheat germ. Used vanillin instead of vanilla. I also seperated the eggs in the beginning. I added just the yolks to start and then after everything else was mixed, I whipped the egg whites and folded them in last for extra fluffiness! Man were these good.

wow! I have always avoided waffles because the only way they ever taste good is with syrup and butter.  I have concocted a blueberry/applesauce topping that I started topping waffles but still felt the waffles themselves weren't terribly nutritious. but now, wow, these are so good I don't even need to top them with anything - just eat right out of the waffle iron.  I made up my blueberry/applesauce but ended up adding plain non fat greek yougurt and eating separately. I did use regular applesauce so there is extra sugar there and I didn't have wheat germ but wanted to use chia seeds anyway so just substituted the 1/4 cup. The blueberries were frozen and when I thawed in microwave it creates a little juice - hence the color.

I am so glad I found this recipe!  I have made these many times and everyone loves them! My kids love them.  I make no changes to the recipe.  I also mix the dry ingredients and store the mix in a ziploc in the freezer and then add the wet ingredients when we are ready to make them. We have topped them with fresh strawberries, fresh peaches and whipped cream, vanilla syrup, homemade mapeline syrup, applesauce and cinnamon.  So many options.  Thank you for the great, healthy recipe.

This is our go to waffle recipe. I always use regular ww flour and I never have flax meal so I use 1/2 cup of rolled oats. I also double the sugar & add cinnamon and cardamom to the batter. Husband & kids live them!!

Delicious! These get really crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn't have flax seed, so I used quick cooking oats.

So much better than regular waffles! My husband likes to make whole wheat pancakes which I'm not a big fan of, so when he said he wanted to make whole wheat waffles I wasn't very enthusiastic. Gave them a try and I couldn't believe how good they were. Don't let the ingredients turn you away from this recipe if you don't have all of them. Just make a point to buy the ones you don't have next time you go to the store.  Moo-ey Delicioso!

I  tweaked the recipe a bit, switched the Whole Wheat-Flour with All Purpose Unbleached White, used Oat Bran instead of Wheat Germ, then made them non dairy by using Oat Milk. 
It was my first time making my own Waffles at home and the first time hubby has had them,he Loved them! and so did I!

Absolutely terrific. I make a quadruple batch and freeze the cooked waffles on a cooling rack before placing them into a large freezer bag.  Just pop them into the toaster oven in the morning for a quick breakfast treat.  my kids Love these with  pure maple syrup.

SO SURPRISED!  I wouldn't normally think a batter with this much whole wheat flour and flax, etc. would be fluffy- usually whole wheat flour seems to make things dense and too chewy.  But the reviews were so great I thought I'd try it.  SO glad I did!  They were surprisingly crispy, light, just awesome.  Wonderful taste!   I subbed oatmeal for the wheat germ and switched the measurements with flax meal (1/4 c. flax meal, 1/2 oats).  They were perfect!!  I'm saving this recipe to use now instead of my boxed mix.

Tried these this morning and sadly wasn't impressed.  Read several reviews and most reviewers made some major revisions.  The only substitution I made was cracked wheat for the wheat germ which I didn't have.  Will make them again to be fair when I get some more wheat germ.

Ahhh...  Mmmmm...  Yeah...
I bought a Belgium waffle maker today and this was the first recipe I made.  I followed the recipe as written and the waffles were amazing.  Full of healful ingredients and totally delicious.  Oh, wait, I lied.  I didn't have the whole wheat pastry flour, just used plain whole wheat flour.  
This will be my go to recipe. Great work experimenting.  : )
PS- It made 4 very big and fluffy Belgium waffles.

they were much better than i expected! I thought it would be a heavy, dense, bland waffle, but they were light, crispy, and a ?nutty? flavor. I used my Babycakes waffle stick maker, and the kids grabbed them and ate them with no complaints (which is something to be said!) 
We are going to test freezing them so my husband has a healthier premade breakfast!

These were AMAZING!  I followed some of the substitutions others suggested (oats for flaxseed), (white whole wheat flower for pastry flour and all purpose flour) and (coconut oil for canola oil and applesauce).  Just a note on the coconut oil - add that as the very last ingredient (after slightly warmed in microwave to liquify).  I added cold milk right after the coconut oil, and since it is solid at room temp - the cold milk made it go right back to solid.

I thought these waffles were tasteless... It might be good if I add blueberries or something extra in it.  It was very moist but I like my waffles abit crispier. Ill have to try it again, I just got a new waffle iron so it might be because of that too.

Delicious!  I used 1.25 cups whole wheat flour, instead of 1 cup whole wheat flour + 0.25 cups all purpose flour.  I replaced the sugar with Splenda, and I added a dash of cinnamon.  Probably the best waffles I've ever made.

I used mashed banana instead of applesauce and added a handful of chopped walnuts. Absolutely delicious!

My 17 month old LOVES this recipe! I made him waffles from a regular box mix yesterday and he took one bite and pushed the plate away.  I love them also.  They're perfect! I did change it a little because I didn't have wheat germ or flax seed.  So I ground 3/4c old fashioned oats to flour, use all whole wheat flour (so 1-1/4c), and increase the vanilla to 1T.  Awesome!! I bought some flax seed so I will be trying that tomorrow with a new batch.  Also, I ususally make a batch at the beginning of the week and freeze them.  I warm 1/4 of a waffle in the microwave for about 45s, making sure to turn it half way through.  They are so good and light and fluffy when they are fresh are previously frozen. I used to put them in the oven to warm but they end up a little too crisp and he cant eat them on his own with his fork, but I prefer them from the micro.  When I make a fresh batch, for me I add 1/2c of mini chocolate chips onto the batter once it's in the waffle iron... so good! Then I freeze the rest in a freezer bag and pull them out as needed.  My son ask for these.  Actually he asked for them for dinner tonight! I've been making this recipe for 3 months and don't think I will ever switch! These are the best waffles ever and the fact that they are healthy is a plus!

Delicious, fluffy, nutrtious pancakes that my children and I loved! Thank you! I omitted the oil, and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.

Absolutely great! I didn't have applesauce, so I just mashed some apples in a pot for a fake homemade applesauce. I made a yogurt syrup with greek yogurt, maple syrup, sugar and and vanilla extract. Than I sautéed some apples and topped it with hazelnuts. With the yogurt, apples, and nuts, this was so decadent but healthy. Highly recommended!

These were very easy to make and quite filling. I substituted my son's organic unsweetened applesauce with cinnamon, thinking it would give it some good flavor, but didn't really taste it. Next time I'll probably add some cinnamon to the batter. Good, healthy recipe that made 8 Belgian waffles. 2 year old son liked them with some butter and organic honey on top. Would definitely make them again. I froze the leftovers as a quick breakfast so hopefully they'll be just as good after a quick thaw in the toaster.

I did not have any wheat germ, so substituted oat bran.  I had flax seed on hand, but next time I will grind it in my coffee grinder.  The seeds kept getting stuck in my teeth! The batter was a little thin, so I only poured about 2/3 the amount I usually do in the waffle maker to prevent it from pouring out the sides.  They puffed up really nicely though.

Used 1 1/4 tsp baking soda and no baking powder. Added 1 tsp salt and 1/3 c. sugar instead of what was suggested. Used all whole wheat instead of flax and germ. Great, thanks!

These waffles have great ingredients and flavor!!!  My only problem was that they kept sticking to my waffle iron and pulling apart, even though I had oiled it well. They were also very soft on the outside, not crispy.  I wondered if they simply need a longer cooking time, but they were already pretty brown on the outside...  Hmm.  I will continue to make them and experiment with times...  I love how healthy and tasty they are!

These are truly amazing! I was thinking they would not be as good as traditional value because of the healthy ingrediants....but they may have been better!

I did add blueberries to some of the batter....yummy!

This is an amazing whole grain waffle recipe.  Just what I was looking for.  I didn't use the oil and replaced it with 1/4 C of applesauce to make a total of 1/2 C of applesauce.  It came out fantastic.  My new waffle recipe staple.  I am a waffle fanatic, so this is big coming from me.

I've been looking for a waffle recipe I could make myself as I move away from prepackaged foods.  I was excited to see all of the 5 star reviews for this recipe, but I ended up being disappointed.  They taste like nothing.  The only way I could get them to taste flavorful was to saturate them with syrup, which defeats the purpose of eating 'healthy' waffles.  I don't think I'll make these again.

These came out awesome!  They satisfied my 5 yr old's palate which is in and of itself quite and accomplishment.  I didn't have the flax or wheat grem on hand so I substituted WW flour for them.  I did everything in the blender.  Great recipe...will use again!!

Great recipe.  I also didn't have the flax meal or wheat germ on hand so I ground up some rolled oats to make a flour and used that.  I put a 1/2 cup buttermilk with the milk too and it came out great.  I have a non-stick waffle iron and didn't need to spay any oil on it.  Great!  I will definitely make again.

This recipe is very light and fluffy, much to my surprise.   I love to try to make food at home that is as healthy as it could be, and this is the perfect recipe.  It is much more filling than a white flour waffle.  I used brown sugar in place of the white sugar .  Thank you for this delicious recipe.

This recipe has become a staple in my kitchen.  It is easy to adapt and always comes out great! One of my favorite variations is to add cinnamon (I add about 1 tsp) and top with baked apples.  No need for syrup!

These are good but if you really want  GREAT waffles you HAVE TO separate the eggs,whip the egg whites and fold them into the batter. I think it helps also if the batter  sits for 15-30 minutes before using

I replaced the applesauce with pumpkin and cut back a little on the milk but I think it was still too much pumpkin because they came out mooshy. I gave it a 5 so my mistake wouldn't drag down the rating. I'll definitely try it again though!

Definitely very heavy waffles. Followed recipe exactly (using a standard substitute of flour and cornstarch mix for the pastry flour) and not a big enough fan of the flavor to try again with adjustments.

My kids gobbled these right up, and I loved all the healthy grains! I didn't have flax seed, so I used 3/4 cup wheat germ instead of 1/4. I also used olive oil instead of canola. I couldn't believe how light and fluffy they were even with all the whole grains! Thanks for a good breakfast!

Fantastic!  I only replaced whole milk for skin milk.  My husband is trying to avoid simple carbs and this recipe using mostly whole wheat flour, wheat germ, and flax fit the bill perfectly!  Very tasty and nice and crispy on the outside.  I put the batter in my belgian waffle maker, and still ended up making more than enough for two (9 4"x4" squares).  The rest will be frozen for future waffle emergencies.

I did some substitutions the first go round with this recipe, since I couldn't find the flax seed meal at the store.  The family loved them.  I did find the flax for the second go round and they were YUMMY too!!  Even my husband who avoids good-for-you foods loves these.  I didn't use whole wheat pastry flour, just plain WW flour.  Very delicious, thanks for sharing.

So, I looked in the recipe book that came with my dad's waffle iron and the whole grain recipe did not suit my liking.  I came here and found this one.  (I made a half batch since I'm the only person that eats wheat flour in almost everything) I did not have any wheat germ, so I omitted that out of the recipe.  Instead of eggs, I used whites.  I added more appy sauce instead of using oil.  Instead of using white flour, I just added more wheat flour.  I substituted the oats for flax.  Lastly, just added 1 TB of brown sugar and some fresh ground cinnamon.  O-M-G.  Best  waffles I ever had!  Topped them with the sugar free syrup and had some turkey bacon.  Man, it was fire.  I'm definitely making a whole batch next time to freeze, so I can just grab and go.  Thanks a bunch!

Followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was good!  Made the following modifications to make even healthier: Used no oil but added 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1/4 cup.  Used 1/4 cup cornmeal instead of all purpose flour.  Also, I made them into pancakes.  Makes about 13 good sized pancakes.  Cooled completely on backing rack then froze them between parchment paper in freezer ziploc bag.  Pop them into a toaster and you have a quick breakfast. I love them topped w/peanut butter and bananas!

This is our favorite waffle recipe for our waffle maker!  My 6-year-old son says he'd give it 10 stars.  Some variations we've tried and like: add mini chocolate chips, replace applesauce with mashed ripe banana, replace 1/4 cup of flour with soy flour (for more protein), use spelt flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I've also made the batter as shown here with banana or chocolate filling - put half the batter in waffle maker, put thinly sliced banana or choc chip on center of batter, then put rest of batter on top.  Those came out awesome too - dessert-worthy!  Enjoy...

Update: I substitute 1 can of pumpkin for the 1/4 cup applesauce and they are awesome!!!  Plus it's an easy way to get an extra veggie in my kids!

Made these exactly as written.  I found that the flavour was great but that they were soggy.  Having said that, I would make them again.

Wonderful! The only things I did differently were substitute vanilla yogurt for the applesauce and the butter (it is just what I had on hand) and I beat the egg whites to soft beaks for fluffier waffles. You would never know they are healthy! They are wonderful and nutritious!

I wasn't sure if the boys would go these- they're at the age where 'good' and 'healthy' don't go together and they can sniff out 'healthy' a mile away.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  They absolutely loved these and want me to forget about any other waffle recipe I use.  The only change I made was to separate the eggs, beat the whites and fold them in at the end (I do it for all my pancakes and waffles and it just makes them fluffier).  Thank you so much for sharing!

For quite a while I couldn't convince myself to buy flax seed meal and wheat germ for one recipe, so I substituted oats for those two ingredients.  Put them in the food processor for 30 seconds or so and it works very well.  I've since made this properly and although they're both good I think I actually like my oat version better.   These also freeze well, just let them cool then put them in a freezer bag.  Pop them in a toaster and they're just like new!  I usually make two batches at a time and it's enough to last a couple weeks.

So, So yummy!!! I did not have pastry flour so I used regular wheat flour. I also did not have any wheat germ but did not miss it. My 2 year old chowed down on these! I had extra batter so I froze a few and they were still so good after toasting them.

Spectacular!  I didn't have the flax seed meal so I used 1/2 c ground oats instead.  My kids and my husband loved these and asked me to make them instead of the regular old waffle mix from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Been looking for a healthier waffle recipe and last night my search ended when I tried this recipe! Absolutely loved it even though I made some changes to accommodate for the lack of some ingredients. I didn't have any flax seed, so I substituted oats. Didn't have applesauce either, so I increase the milk and added some honey. I made pancakes and waffles with it and it's definitely a hit in my book! Yummy and awesome!

These were filling and delicious! I ground my own whole flax seeds in a coffee grinder and used a little less than the recipe asked for. I didn't use any canola oil- subbed it for equal parts cinnamon applesauce (I dislike unsweetened applesauce!). The kicker was I didn't even use whole wheat flour. I thought I had it in stock, but I couldn't find it so I just used all-purpose flour! And it was still really delicious. We topped them with strawberries and honey, and I doubled the recipe to freeze. Everyone loved them!

Wonderful recipe! I did substitute some ingredients, since I didn't have wheat germ or ww pastry flour in the pantry. I used a mixture of regular whole wheat flour and spelt flour instead of ww pastry flour and all purpose flour. I added oats instead of wheat germ. The waffles were terrific. I am headed to the market for wheat germ and whole wheat pastry flour, because I will definitely make these again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made the following changes over several preparations, my amounts relate too the full recipe: substitute applesauce for oil, no salt, substitute dark brown sugar for the white sugar and double the amount, add 3 tablespoons of well mashed ripe banana(no lumps), double the vanilla, add 1/16 tsp nutmeg to full recipe. My one and 2 serving are available under whole grain waffles 1, and wgw 2. Thanks!

These are SO good.  I used half whole white wheat flour and half whole wheat pastry flour, and you seriously cannot tell they are whole wheat, not "wheaty" at all!!  I also replaced the oil and applesauce with coconut oil.  Wow!

Subbed oat flour for flax and 1/2 of oil with more applesauce.  I also separated egg whites and beat them stiff before adding them in at the end.  Very delicious.

I love waffles, but I rarely eat them due to the empty carbs.  These not only taste great (and are even better the next day!), but I love that I can cram in a whole lot of nutrition!  Because we can't eat wheat or dairy, I made the following changes: unsweetened hemp milk instead of skim milk, whole spelt flour instead of whole wheat pastry flour, oats instead of wheat germ, and white spelt flour in place of the all-purpose.  I also used brown sugar instead of white and added a packet of Stevia to up the sweetness a bit, and I separated the eggs, whipped the whites to soft peaks, and folded them in at the end.  Thank you for the awesome base-recipe!  My family just loves these.

I just made these for myself and my housemate.  I made the following substitutions: for the pastry flour I just used regular whole wheat flour, for the milk I substituted homemade almond milk (almonds and water blended), for the wheat germ I substituted oats and for the applesauce I substituted mashed pear.  I used all the same amounts.  I found that, probably because of the water and juicy mashed pear, I had to cook these a little longer so they weren't mushy inside.  Still, when they came out of the waffle iron my housemate and I both agreed they were delicious!  They've got a great flavor and richness without being heavy.  I'll definitely make these again!  For a topping, I mixed the remaining mashed pear with some crushed pieces of almond and a bit of powdered sugar.  I think this made the waffles shine even more than regular syrup!

These were really good, the kids enjoyed them too. I like the "healthy" ingredients. I will try making extras as others suggested to freeze and then toast as needed. Thanks for the recipe!

WoW! FINALLY, a whole grain waffle I don’t feel guilty about!  They come out perfect ever time.. my family raves about them. I did not have some of the ingredients on hand, so here is what I changed... and they still came out just perfect! Thank you for this breakfast recipe!  1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour (inst. of pastry flour + wheat germ) Add cinnamon Add chopped walnuts and/or pecans Add blueberries (frozen works fine)

Excellent waffles! I don't usually keep flax in the house so I just use quick cooking oats instead. Very tasty, wonderful with homemade, low sugar berry sauce!

Fantastic! I've been looking for a higher-fiber, whole grain waffle alternative to eggos & this is it! Delicious! Crispy & very tasty! I did not have wheat germ, so I just added more flax meal & whole wheat flour - no measuring, just estimates & they came out fine. I've frozen some & I have enough to last me for the entire work week. Great recipe - thanks!

Great waffles!  Made these completely whole grain.  You can add whatever flour/dry ingredients you want as long as you keep approximately same amount of dry ingredients.  This time I used flax ground in mini-prep food processor (coffee mill also works), walnuts or pecans ground finely in mini-prep (but not to butter), whole oats ground into flour (replaces white flour nicely) and wheat bran instead of wheat germ in addition to whole wheat flour.  I have also substituted pumpkin or banana for applesauce.  Very nice healthy recipe that is very flexible for the meddlesome cook!

Pretty dirn good for "healthy" waffles! Make sure you cook them until they are very golden brown, they taste much better crispy than floppy. If they do turn out a little saggy, just pop them in the toaster and they'll crisp up. Thanks for the great recipe What a Dish!

This recipe was only okay. The flavor was good, but it didn't seem to get very crispy at all. Also, I think I would prefer more substance to my waffles. I expected these to be a little heartier than they were. I would say these are great for people who want wheat but don't want the hearty flavor.

These are TERRIFIC!!  I have tried them substituting soy milk for the skim milk and also adding sunflower seeds or chopped walnuts.  They are just sweet enough that you don't even have to put butter or syrup on them to enjoy them as a snack.  Something else I do is separate the eggs, beat the whites until stiff, and fold them into the batter just before cooking.  I use a belgian waffle maker so they come out fluffy and light and moist and just plain delicious.  Hard to believe something so tasty can be good for you, too!

We were skeptical at first... sounded too healthy to be good.  They were awesome... this is the recipe we will use from now on.  Even if you are not after the healthy aspect of it... you gotta try them.  You won't be disappointed :)

Very good!  Be sure to start out with slightly less mix on your waffle maker because it expands a lot as you cook.  I have a 4-square belgian waffle maker and used 1 1/2 c - 1 3/4 c. to fill it.  Next time I'm going to try subbing honey for the sugar.  :)

Amazing!  My husband and kids LOVE these.  I also substitute the 1/2 c flax seed meal with 1/4 c oatmeal and 1/4 c flax seed meal.  These freeze so well, too!

These waffles tasted good, but they stuck like crazy to my greased, non-stick waffle iron!  We ended up making pancakes out of the batter.  I'm not sure what the problem was--I followed the recipe (only substituting oats for the wheat germ).  In any case, be careful!

These waffles satisfied the most anti-health food person in the world.  I made the batter in secret so they wouldn't see all of the stuff that went into it and showed them the ingredient list after the fact. They couldn't believe it.  Nutty and light, but filling.  They also satisfied a very health-conscious person (me).  I made them exactly as directed with the minor substitution of whole wheat flour because I don't have any pastry flour and they are fabulous.  Next time, a few blueberries on top will add antioxidant properties to an extremely healthy recipe.  Great way to start the day!  Thanks!

These are absolutely wonderful! These are the tastiest waffles my family and I have ever had. As a vegetarian, I'm always looking for healthy and filling options for meals. My brother and I have these at least every couple of days! They're so easy to make, and they turn out perfect every time. The one modification I've made was I use all whole wheat flour instead of 1 1/2 cups whole wheat and 1/4 cup white. Thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent recipe. I enjoy it because it's healthy, fibrous and waffles are lighter and fluffier than expected. Used my new Belgian waffle maker and they turned out great. I doubled the recipe, cut the oil in half and added more applesauce, used brown sugar instead of white, and added lots of blueberries. I served it with 100% pure maple syrup. It was to die for!

These are wonderful, you have to try them! I followed some suggestions and used applesauce instead of oil and they turned out fabulous. I also ground up oatmeal in place of the wheat germ, because I did not find it when I went to the store (I will be looking again). Some suggested to switch the amount of flax for wheat germ and I think this would be a mistake. The flavor is wonderful. I did use milled (ground) flax not seeds. I made these into pancakes, but will try waffles in the future. I doubled the recipe and it made 22 pancakes for me. They were nice and dense, just how I like my pancakes. My 7 year old and 4 year old gobbled them up and said "I can't believe these are healthy!" Thank you so much for the recipe.

Wow!  I've made whole grain waffles for years, but these are truly exceptional -- surprisingly light and very tasty.  I didn't have any applesauce on hand, so I just left it out without adjusting anything else, and the results were still outstanding.  The batter was awfully thick, so I did slop in a little more milk (didn't measure -- sorry!) until it was the right consistency for pouring.  I served them topped with a recipe of Poached Orange Pears (dicing the pears and thickening the liquid with a tablespoon of cornstarch at the last minute) and it was YUMMY!  This will definitely be my new standby waffle recipe.

Awesome waffles!  Took no time at all to whip up, and did well with my substitutions. =]  Subs: rice milk for cow's milk, & oat bran for wheat germ.

Very tasty! I used regular whole wheat flour, half butter/half vegetable oil, and almond milk in place of the skim. I cooked them in a Belgium Waffle maker and they turned out with a slight crisp to the edges...delicious. Next time I'll make more, add whole flax seeds, no butter and freeze to eat for breakfast during the week!

I was craving cranberries, decided to make waffles and found this recipe. Added chopped cranberries to the batter and also topped with cooked, chopped cranberries and toasted walnuts. Did not want to buy WW pastry flour just for this, so used regular WW flour. Otherwise kept to the recipe exactly. Cooked soft and not crispy, but DELICIOUS!!! Very filling and healthy. I loved these.

Wow, these are amazing waffles; thank you so much for the recipe!!! I have to say I was starting to get a little irritated making them because of all the ingredients, but it was well worth it and we will definitely be making these waffles many more times :)  The only complaint I have is that I didn't make more of them.  Thanks again for this recipe!!!

Loved this recipe!  I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour and used regular whole wheat flour.  These turned out crispier and baked higher than my normal "unhealthy" waffle recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

My kids DEVOURED this! I didn't have the wheat germ, or flax, so I substituted oatmeal that I blended/chopped a little so it wouldn't be so bulky, but I think it would be fine without the chopping!  DELICIOUS!!!!

These are so wonderful!  I have been making them for a few months now and my family loves them.  When I don't have flax seed on hand I use oatmeal, or I split it half and half.  Also I like to double the recipe and freeze some for mornings we have to get out of the house fast.  Healthier than a toaster pastry!

These are excellent. I ground WW flour, blended rolled oats to make oat flour, ground flax seed and added millet.  Also used all applesauce to replace the oil.  These are the best and sooo nutritious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Taste was excellant.  Any advice on why mine came out a little soft?  I cooked them in a Belgium style waffle iron... could that be it?  When i toasted the frozen leftovers, they were perfect!

Absolutely awesome recipe.  Crispy and light.  I did not have wheat germ, so substituted oat bran instead.  Also, separated the yolks from whites and beat the whites stiff and folded into the batter at the end.  I will likely never make a different waffle again.

Yum, yum, yum!  I can not say enough good about this recipe!  I used canned pumpkin in place of the applesauce, and cut out the oil all together. I also added some cinnamon. They turned out AWESOME! the flavor and the texture are both perfect.   Even members of my family who shy away from whole grain things couldn't resist them.  I doubled the recipe and froze what was left over to use as toaster waffles (though they didn't last long!)  A much cheaper and healthier alternative to the frozen waffles you buy at the store.

This is much thinner than my normal recipe.  I should have known that when I opened the waffle iron, I would have part stuck to the top, and part stuck to the bottom!  I added an extra 1/2 cup flour, and the problem was gone!  Good taste, texture, and healthy goodness!

Yum! I looked up a recipe 20 minutes ago because it's hot and I didn't really want to cook, and I've already eaten my first waffle!  I substituted plain yogurt for the applesauce and omitted the wheat germ and they were still delicious- very filling AND tasty.  I will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Excellent waffles.  I think these would be good for someone who doesn't normally like whole wheat.  I made a double batch and will freeze the leftovers for toaster waffles.  I added some finely chopped (almost powdered) pecans.  Instead of whole wheat pastry flour, I used "white wheat" which is a golden whole wheat that is a lighter than the standard red whole wheat.  I used white wheat from a local grower through the Oklahoma Food Coop, but I think you can also get it on-line through Prairie Gold.

These were ok. Very healthy and tasty.  I did add a little more sugar and some cinnamon.  The 1/2 cup flax seed seemed like a lot so I cut it in half and added 1/4 cup oatmeal.  Just used regular pancake syrup on them.  Will make them again.

Excellent recipe!  We made these this morning (no wheat germ in the house and only all purpose wheat flour instead of the pastry flour) and they were fantastic.  All three kids loved them and ate them right up.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are absolutely the best--EVER!!!  I was out of applesauce and tired of banana, so I substituted canned pumpkin and 1 tsp, of cinnamon in its place.  Recipe made 8 waffles in my my waffle iron.  Next time, I will double the recipe!

I adore this recipe!I have made a few adjustments. I added in some ground oats, used all wheat flour instead of all purpose,used all applesauce instead of oil, and honey instead sugar.I now make these at least once a month, break them up into quarters and freeze them in a single layer to reheat in the toaster on school mornings.Thank you for such a healthy delicious breakfast!

Exceptional!  To make & serve something healthy that my whole family loves is very satisfying.  I made a few changes.  I used buttermilk, ww flour, replaced  some flour with cornstarch for more crispy waffles, doubled the recipe but not the baking powder, separated the eggs and folded in the whites at the end and much to our delight used a belgian waffle maker-they turned out wonderful!  Loved these-better than any recipe we've tried!

These waffles were GREAT! Light and fluffy inside with just enough crispiness on the outside. My batter made 9 small waffles.  This would be a great, quick way to get kids to eat whole wheat.
I had no wheat germ so I used wheat bran instead.

These are very good; I do use all applesauce instead of oil, but everything else I do exactly as written - this also makes a ton of waffles, we toast them and bring them in the car on the way to school.  I love having healthy breakfasts with all that fiber and protein and a great taste - thanks!

So healthy and delicious!  I used only 1/4 cup flaxseed and increased the whole wheat flour by 1/4 cup and added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  My family gobbled them up and enjoyed them a lot!  Thanks for the great post!

Amazing! Family is in love. I did whip up the whites and fold them in. I also used applesauce in place of the oil.

These were really yummy, surprisingly so with all the good for you stuff in them.  My entire family enjoyed them.  I would only have wished for more crispiness on the outside.  They were soft, but good.

I had to substitute, I screwed up on the amount of flour, and it still turned out great!  I had no whole wheat pastry flour, so I used half all purpose, half regular whole wheat and missed the part of the recipe calling for an additional 1/4 cup of all purpose flour.  Then I was afraid to add too much flax meal, so I only used a 1/4 cup and substituted oat flour for the wheat germ, but increased it to 1/2 cup.  The batter was a little thin, but the waffles turned out great and the kids loved them. Of course my homemade apricot syrup and the whipped cream probably helped too...  However, this is a great recipe that lends itself well to substitutions! UPDATE 2/4/2014 The original review I made several years ago. Since then this became my go-to waffle recipe because it is healthy and yummy. I still change out the flours depending on what I have on hand, sometimes oat flour, sometimes spelt or coconut flour. I like to be adventurous. I don't always use skim milk and rarely have wheat germ on hand, so I adjust the flour ratios to compensate. I do use golden flaxseed meal. The recipe always turns out lovely, though it does have a tendency to stick to the waffle-iron at times. For that reason I add a little extra grapeseed oil and if it still sticks, I spray the waffle-iron with nonstick spray between each waffle. I think part of why my waffles taste so good is that I use my homemade sugar free applesauce.

Excellent recipe!  Great flavor!  I did not have wheat germ on hand so, as another poster suggested, I used ground oatmeal.  We are also primarily vegan so I used Egg Replacer and that worked just fine.  I have a Belgian waffle iron and was worried they would stick, but they came out great.  We'll definitely add this to our regular repertoire of weekend breakfasts.  Thanks!

GREAT recipe!  I use fat free milk and add 1 scoop of protein powder.  My children and husband ask for these almost every weekend.  I haven't had the chance to try freezing them, we've never had left overs for more than a day or 2, even with doubling the recipe :)

I made these to add to a waffle bar brunch. They are delicious and easy to make.  Everyone was really surprised by the lightness and fluffiness of the waffle.  Also, my 3yr old loves them!

Made exactly as written except used light olive oil in place of canola and quick oats for wheat germ (to accommodate my cupboard stock). I am really impressed at how light and fluffy these are without having to whip egg whites separately. Perfect first batch out of my new All-Clad Belgian waffle maker with no sticking issues. Many thanks to the original poster for sharing what is my new go-to waffle recipe!

Lots of good comments here.
King Arthur flour already contains wheatgerm. 
I didn't have any apple sauce so I made my own out of an apple.

Good solid waffles that don't fall apart and have a little substance to them. Flavor is great but could also try adding cinnamon and serve with an apple topping.

I've been at a loss since Trader Joe's discontinued their Whole Grain Baking mix, but who needs it now!  I think next time I will add some oats, but the flax adds flavor, fluffiness and a nice texture.  It can be really tricky to make whole grain waffles not be too dense or grainy - thanks Michelle for your experimentation and this awesome recipe.

These were very filling.   I am giving this a 4 star only due to the fact I could not follow the recipe due to limited ingredients on hand.  I did not have Wheat Germ so I subbed in Quick Oats.  Also, for the All Purpose Flour I used White Whole Wheat.  The Flax Seed was a bit over bearing so, I think next time I will switch the flax and oat amounts.   These are very easy to pop together and will definitely make them again.  Maybe change the sugar to brown and double the amount for personal preference.

I used normal whole wheat flour and no wheat germ (just used extra white flour), I also replaced the sugar with maple syrup.

Ended up with 14 Mini waffles that taste awesome!

This is a great recipe! I did substitute additional applesauce for the canola oil. Instead of wheat germ, I used dry oats. Instead of all-purpose flour, used whole wheat flour. Instead of the sugar, I used 1-1/2 packets of Splenda. Tastes great!!  I have no concerns about my diabetic husband eating this!!

Have made exactly as written and it's delicious. Have also made with some modifications-- agave instead of sugar and oats run through the blender in place of the wheat germ. Those changes work also.

Terrific recipe.  Everyone loves them, even little kids and picky eaters.  I follow recipe exactly, sometimes subbing something here and there like more ground flax if don’t have wheat germ, or all oil if have no applesauce.  I love making these!  Thank you so much.

Very good. I only review the recipes I save to my favorites, which isn't many!  This one made the cut! I didn't have wheat germ so I ground up some oatmeal in the blender and used that instead.  I used brown sugar instead of white and cooked an apple in the microwave since I didn't have apple sauce. I served it with berries and it was a hit!!

I thought these were great! I made a few tweaks, simply because I had to use what I had on hand. I didn't have whole grain flour, so I made my own by grinding whole oats, quinoa, and flax in a blender. I also used buttermilk instead of skim milk and 1/2 cup of coconut oil in place of the apple sauce/oil combo. My family loved them! Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Will definitely make this my go-to recipe!

This is a great healthy alternative to my great-grandma's waffle recipe.  This recipe made 5 waffles for me.  These are really filling!  Eating one of these waffle is like eating two, non-whole grain waffles.  
A tip from my great-grandma:  separate the egg yolks and whites.  Whip the egg whites and carefully fold them into the batter after everything else has been mixed.

These waffles were delicious! I was pleasantly surprised that this healthy version of waffles could compete with the traditional waffle recipes. I swapped out the oil for apple sauce (used 1/2c total apple sauce) and, to avoid the refined sugar, replaced with half a mashed banana. I also found I had to grease the waffle iron each time I cooked a waffle; not sure if it's because of this waffles consistency or my iron getting older.

Really liked these waffles.  I did not have whole wheat pastry flour, wheat germ, or apple sauce.  Instead substituted using 3/4 cup sprouted whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup organic white flour, skipped the wheat germ, and added about 1/3 to 1/2 cup coconut oil rather than the canola oil and applesauce.  I cooked them up in my belgian waffle maker.  The waffles, to my surprise, turned out light, crispy, and tasty.  Wonderful, more healthy and nutritious version of belgian waffles.

These were great!  Made about 6 large waffles in my electric waffle maker.  I substituted about 1 cup quick oats for the flax and wheat germ because I was out of both (suggested by another reviewer), also used honey instead of sugar. Great taste with real maple syrup!

These waffles were healthy, tasty and filling. I substituted almond milk for the milk and used oat flour instead of regular flour. I also used organic stone ground whole wheat flour instead of pastry flour and with these changes they still came out delicious. I felt the balance of wet to dry ingredients was perfect. Thanks for a delicious and healthy waffle recipe!

Not that this recipe needs another 5 star review, but.... I also love the Waffles I recipe from A|R, but this is going to be my Go-To waffle mix from now on (when I have the ingredients on hand). The waffles were absolutely delicious, with the perfect crunch, texture and lightness. The bonus is they are healthier than those made with white flour, which is why I prefer them. Fed these to my young nieces and nephews and they scarfed them down...even the picky eaters who seem to dislike just about everything. I used wheat pastry flour (ordered from King Arthur's website) and followed the recipe to a tee. I see no reason to change it. AP flour would work, as the protein content is very similar to pastry...only slightly higher. The lower the protein a flour has, the less gluten is formed, so the end result is airier/fluffier. You probably wouldn't want to use Bread flour, since it's high protein to help form gluten and give bread that denser, chewier texture. Thanks for a great, healthy version of one of my breakfast splurge foods!

Although  I dislike when people make tons of changes, I couldn't help but doing so.
I used buttermilk because I think it makes a lighter more tender waffle.
I used butter instead of oil for more flavor.
Because of the buttermilk I added 1/2 tsp baking soda.

 I used 1 TBSP brown sugar instead of white.  I rarely use white sugar.  I think sugar is more harmful to us than fat.

I did not have enough flax meal so for that reason only I used 1/4 cup flax meal and 1/4 cup Irish quick cooking oats.

These were by far the best waffles I ever had.  Crisp on the outside and tender and light in the middle.  I have made many waffles but I may just stick with this recipe.  You'll love them.

Made twice - once exactly as written,  and it was great. The second time I loved even more using melted butter not oil, oatmeal instead of wheat germ and all whole wheat flour.

I love this recipe. It has all the things in it a healthy waffle should and it still tastes great. Pastry flour is not necessary as whole wheat flour will work nicely. I swap the sugar for stevia crystals to make the batches sugar free. My kids don't even notice. Adding cinnamon and/or nutmeg and topping with low-sugar fruit preserves instead of syrup is also a great way to serve a fancy breakfast without the guilt.

Soooo yummy! I made a quadruple batch so I could freeze them and pull them out whenever. I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour, so I just used regular whole wheat flour. After reading some reviews, I decided to replace the oil with more applesauce. I used Truvia baking blend instead of sugar, and added a splash of molasses to the batter, maybe a tsp or so for the quadruple batch. These were the best waffles I've had. I've been searching for a good recipe...this one is in the books and staying! Will be my new go-to! They're almost creamy or something on the inside....soooo good, and with all those healthy ingredients too!!!! Thank you!

We've had these twice now.  Kids ate them up like crazy.  I don't have wheat germ on hand so I substitute for more flour.  I threw in a banana this time around as well.  Anything my kids love is a great recipe to me.

In spite of all the positive reviews, I did not think for a minute that these would be good. Boy, was I wrong!! I made the recipe today exactly as stated, with the exception of adding 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon. I don't like wheat germ or flax meal, so had zero expectations that these would be edible, let alone good, but I did want to find a healthy alternative to a family favorite. After trying this recipe, I have thrown out all my other waffle recipes. This has outstanding flavour and texture, it's a snap to make, and on top of all that, the darn things are healthy. I am a convert! You have to try this recipe!!

600 and counting 5 star reviews do not lie! My kids friends are not used to healthier food and usually don't eat much when staying over since all we eat is whole and less processed food. I served these waffles without disclosing they were anything but "normal" and was enthusiastically informed they were the BEST WAFFLES EVER. I did not have pastry flour so I used soft white whole wheat flour (100% whole wheat) and also had no wheat germ so I just used that much more flax meal . The subtle apple flavor was very nice, I'm considering substituting more applesauce for the oil next time to play it up even more.

Delicious!  My husband, my 5-year-old, and I loved the taste!  And I loved the health-ful ingredients.  My 8-year-old thought they tasted too healthy, but this may just be because my husband let slip that we put healthy ingredients.  This recipe is a keeper!

Love this recipe!  I've made it multiple times for my large family, so I always double.  I find this recipe easily adapts to changes.  I use whole wheat flour, ground flax, and I grind Steele cut oats for oat flour, instead of what is in the recipe because this is what I have on hand.  I also use buttermilk--sorry, I don't ever use skim milk.  So, because of the buttermilk, I also add some baking soda.  I haven't found that any of the other ingredients are in excess.  It all works for us!  This is a standard and staple in our house!

These are out of this world good! It's going to be hard for me to ever use another waffle recipe! These will stay fresh in a zip lock bag in the fridge if you plan to eat them within a few days of making them (just pop one in the oven to heat back up). I added frozen blueberries, yum! For syrup I mixed some extra blueberries with maple syrup and zapped in the microwave. I used a couple of substitutions just bc I had them on hand- olive oil, almond milk and white whole wheat flour. Everything else stayed the same. Would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Great recipe that holds up to substitutions. My family loved it even my five yr old who said he only likes storebought waffles. It does have a lot of ingredients that most won't have on hand.  Here  is what I subbed either out of necessity or preference. Sharing in case this helps someone else:
2 percent milk for skim, coconut oil for canola, agave syrup for sugar, quick oats for white flour, Apple/banana/peach baby food purée for applesauce

This recipe is a keeper.

I make this frequently when our adult children brings friends to our beach home.  I make a bunch, break them into quarters and as guests get up, they put them in the toaster to heat and crisp up. Perfect with the blueberry sauce recipe from this website!!

Whole Grain Waffles Haiku: "Outside was crispy, and perfectly soft inside. Hearty yet light too." My wheat germ had a funky smell so I subbed in quick-cooking oats, and used just whole wheat flour rather than WW pastry flour. Ate mine w/ a pat of butter and a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds on top and was in heaven, even though my intention was to make them all to freeze for my teething baby as she likes to gnaw on frozen waffles as the square ridges feel good on her gums, and I feel good about letting her eat a waffle w/ these ingredients in it rather than store-brand frozen ones. I'll be nice and share some w/ her, but I could eat them all myself!

These were great! I only had roasted flax seeds, and was afraid so much would be too strong for the kids, so I replaced half with hemp hearts and chia.  I also added cinnamon. Delicious!! I think my dad would even like these when he visits, as long as he doesn't see all the healthy grains going into them.

My one mistake: I read a review mentioning that this recipe only makes 6 waffles, and immediately decided to double the recipe.  I should've realized that reviewer probably had a nice, big Belgian waffle maker.  I was at my (gifted) little animal shape waffle iron for almost two hours!

We've made these waffles many times. They're always amazing. We leave out the oil, and use whatever combo of whole wheat flour/white flour/flax seed/whatever we have. Drop in some fresh or frozen berries when you put it in the waffle maker!

This was really good. I only used 2t of the baking soda. I didn't have any applesauce so I just used 1/2 cup oil instead 1/4 applesauce and 1/4 oil. I topped it with whipped cream and the strawberry sauce in my recipe box.

Just made these. Used regular whole wheat flour vs. pastry. I didn't have the wheat germ so I compensated with extra flour and flax. I added a couple pinches of cinnamon, used almond milk in place of skim milk and used additional applesauce in place of the oil - the only problem with that is I found I had to lightly spray with Pam between each batch which wasn't a big deal. Great flavor and texture. We all LOVED these and this will be our new waffle recipe. Thank you.

Taste is good. Texture light. Didn't get crispy outside. I didn't have wheat germ so used extra 1/4 cup whole wheat flour. Would make again, but will try recipe as written.

I was out of waffle mix so was thankful that I found this recipe!  Had to sub almond milk for skim milk, olive oil for canola oil and I had no applesauce on hand so added 2 tbs of melted butter.  Honestly...pretty dry.  My son wouldn't eat them.  I did but used a lot of syrup.  I think the applesauce (or mashed pears like someone else did) would make a big difference.  Still rated it high because I am sure it was my substitutions that wrecked it!  Just figured I'd write the review in case you were considering similar changes, particularly omitting the apple sauce.  Don't do it.  :)

Overall very healthy and delicious! We had to make adjustments for my dairy free husband. So we replaced the milk with almond milk. I didn't have wheat germ so I replaced that with almond meal (although not the full 1/4 cup, I used about half of the 1/4 cup as almond meal you don't need as much of when replacing wheat germ). I  also doubled up on the vanilla extract and sugar. My family loved these and we had some leftover to freeze!

Thank you for this recipe!  I make it about once a month using a Belgian waffle maker then freeze them for quick toaster breakfasts for my three year old.  I did buy aluminum free baking powder and they have no metallic taste for me.  Otherwise, I make exactly as directed.

I love this recipe! I love healthy recipes of favorite foods, and this qualifies. I use oats instead of wheat germ, but that's the only change. They are very filling. This is now my official waffle recipe!

great recipe! I used some substitutes. Used no oil or flax and upped the oats to 1/2 cup,  also reduced the baking soda to 1 tbs and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I had to use spray oil on griddle to stop from sticking.

These came out beautifully! I did make some changes though...as I am fond of experimenting. I used regular whole wheat flour, left out the white flour, sugar, wheat germ, and flaxseed meal (sorta-see below). Then I subbed sunflower seed oil instead of canola oil (I think I'll use extra apple sauce instead next time), I also subbed 2 tablespoons of flaxseed meal soaked for 2 minutes in 6 tablespoons of water instead of 2 eggs, I mixed in about 1/4 cup each of whole flaxseed, Bob's Red Mill rolled oats, and wheat bran. Also, next time I think I'll use unsweetened almond milk instead of skim milk. I spread my mother-in-law's pumpkin butter on my waffles instead of syrup and it was heavenly! Love this recipe even though I changed so much of it!

Amazing!  I tried to make my own whole grain waffles, but they tasted horrible.  I could not get the right texture.  These waffles are amazing and my wife loves them too.  I love it when healthy tastes great!  When we have kids, this will be the first waffle that they are introduced to.

We have a restaurant style Belgian waffle maker and I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe in it.  However, they turned out great!  The only problem was I got only 5 waffles instead of the suggested 6.  I also used whole wheat flour not the pastry blend.  Ellen from Milwaukee, WI

Delicious! I also didn't have the flaxseed or wheat germ so instead took the advice of another reviewer and did 3/4c of the quick cooking oats.  Came out great! Will definitely be making this recipe again.

We recently bought a waffle iron and have been trying out various waffle recipes over the last few weeks.  This one makes the lightest waffle and is the healthiest; though I did find it to be lacking a bit in the flavor department which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I had to make a few adjustments based on the items I had on hand.  I didn't have the wheat germ and flax seed so I used more wheat flour to cover those.  And I was about out of canola oil, so I used flax seed oil instead.  Overall we really enjoyed this recipe and will be using it as our go-to waffle recipe.

These were great! Just used 1 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup oatmeal (what I had) and followed the rest as written. They were light, fluffy, and delicious!!! From the 2 year old to the 60 year old--all approved!

The only change I made was using peanut oil instead of canola (we were out of canola). We love big weekend breakfasts and I wanted a way to make our waffles healthier, this was great! Hubby didn't even realize they were a healthier alternative, no sacrificing taste in this recipe!

Wow, these were delicious! Just made a batch. Followed the recipe exactly but I added in a few handfuls of old-fashioned oats and some spices (cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger). Topped them with a raspberry-strawberry jam ginger syrup and bananas. I will be saving this recipe for the future for sure.

Delicious! I used coconut oil in place of canola oil, and I didn't have pastry flour, so I just used regular ww flour, which probably made them a little more dense, but still delicious. Crispy on the outside...mmm! My 5 year old, who claimed "I don't like waffles!"...proceeded to clean her plate!

Easy to make.  Substituted whole wheat for pastry flour due to a cupboard shortage and it was still light and fluff.  Nice flavor.  Just used sliced fruit as a topping.

These were wonderful!  I had to make a few subs since I didn't have some things on hand, banana for the applesauce, oat bran for the wheat germ and olive for the canola.  Served with homemade blueberry sauce and fresh blackberries, yum!

This was delicious!  Even my children, who are usually hard sells when I make things with whole wheat flour and wheat germ loved them. I added a little milk to thin the batter and made pancakes too.  They were even better...in my opinion.

These are very good! They did come out crisp on the outside and tender on inside.  I used 1 cup ap flour and about 1/2 cup of whole wheat. No flax or wheat germ, but I buzzed up some steel cut oats in the processor and used those instead. Everyone loved them. Keeper!

Nice quick recipe.  I did not have wheat germ so I increased the wheat flour.  I also added cinnamon,used EVVO instead of canola oil and honey (1/4 cup of really good honey) instead of sugar.  Great to freeze and pop in the toaster during the week for a good breakfast.

FABULOUS waffles!  Have made it as written and also with the following substitutions:  buttermilk instead of milk, olive oil instead of canola, whole wheat instead of whole wheat pastry and rolled oats instead of wheat germ.  Fantastic every time and my kids, aged 6 and under, ask for these waffles nearly every week.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

Awesome! I omitted the salt and substituted rolled oats for the all-purpose flour. They freeze well; just pop them in the toaster. Wonderful with strawberry jam and whipped cream.

My favorite waffle recipe.  I use spelt flour instead of the whole wheat pastry flour and I always whip the egg whites and fold them into the batter last.

I LOVE this recipe so much, I'm always telling others about it.
I like to double it, so I can leave the batter in the fridge for healthy fast breakfasts on weekday mornings for my children and me.
For a sit-down breakfast, I top it with warm blueberries and a dollop of Greek yogurt. My three children like it plain or with butter & syrup.
On the run, we spread Polamer All Fruit and fold it over for a waffle sandwich on the ride to school.
It's filling nd delicious!

UPDATE 10/26/11: I revised my rating to 5 stars.  The kids and I love these, and my now 3.5 yr old begs for waffles for dinner when hubby isn't home.  Since the kids and I outrank hubby :-) these waffles deserve 5 stars!!

If it were entirely up to me, I would give this 5 stars.  I love the flavor and texture of these waffles.  They don't even need syrup.  Hubby liked the flavor but didn't like the flax seeds.  Two year old ate 1.5 waffles, so I'm pretty sure he loved them (even though he's in a phase where he gives me a huge smile and says "This breakfast no good").  I did sub almond milk for the skim, since I needed to make these dairy-free.

I was very skeptical about these going in...just too much good for you stuff in them to taste good.  However, I was looking for something healthier than the buttermilk waffles we were used to making, so based on all the good reviews I gave them a try.  They were excellent!  Great taste, good texture.  The only things I changed in the recipe were that I used plain whole wheat flour (I couldn't find whole wheat pastry flour) and 1% milk.

this has been my go to recipe for quite some time now. just getting caught up on reviews. I have added bananas to these and came out with a hint of sweetness. during the holiday season i replaced half the milk with eggnog and added some nutmeg and cinnamon. I will usually double the batch and keep them in the freezer for a quick throw in the toaster/microwave breakfast for the kids. Thanks for the recipe

Superb.  didn't have the wheat germ on hand so just substituted a bit more of the flax seed.  Crisp on the outside, delicate but substantial on the inside...not your usual sort of heavy, gluey, fattening fair.  Now my favourite waffle recipe!

I loved this recipe.  I've never rated any recipe, but I give this 10 stars for a really tasty recipe that can easily be "healthified".  A new breakfast staple for sure!!! my substitutions were (what I had on hand): 1 cup coconut milk, 3/4 rice milk for the skim milk olive oil for canola oil 1/4 cup masa harina for wheat germ 1 tablespoon agave for sugar  served with unsweetened applesauce.  yummy!

These were surprising delicious.  I made these for my kids and figured they would rather play frisbee with them but they didn't even notice the 'healthy' ingredients!  I used 3/4 c reg. whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup ground flax seed and 1 cup white flour.  Delicious!

Made a double batch and froze in a ziplock.  All family members are in a rush in the morning and I love that I can pop these in the toaster for a couple of minutes and serve up with maple syrup and my kids have a full belly for school.  FANTASTIC!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I'm dieting so I've cut out any processed foods.  Problem is my husband is not!  So I was looking for a compromise.  These are perfect, filling, tasty, and best of all healthy.  I switched up the canola oil for olive and topped mine with 1/2 a banana, 2 tbs,of sunflower seeds, and 1 tbs of real maple syrup!  Yum yum and didn't even cheat!  Thanks for the recipe. '

I followed this recipe exactly except that I used sweetened applesauce which, given the small amount, I don't think would make much of a difference.  These waffles are wonderful.  I have a large belgium waffle maker and this recipe yields 5.

Very good!  I don't think they have a very strong flavor, but I think that's okay in a waffle.  I did add a bit more vanilla, however and may add just a tad more sugar next time.  I tripled the recipe (which made 30 Belgian waffles) to make a bunch to freeze for breakfasts (took for-ever because I could only cook two at a time!) and I found that 1/3c. was the perfect amount of batter for each waffle and 6-7 minutes was the perfect cook time.  I did use whole wheat flour instead of ww pastry flour because that's all I had, but I think they would have been even better with the ww pastry flour as the recipe calls for!

Pretty good, I used the recipe and made waffles and they were tasty!  The texture was just a little too mushy, I even cut back to 1 1/2 bananas still too much! I loved the different flavor great recipe!

These haven't even made it to my plate with the homemade blueberry syrup and they are already melt in your mouth scrumptious! Always looking for healthhy recipes that taste great and this is it!!!! I subbed ground oatmeal for the flaxseed because I didn't have it. I also subbed almond milk for regular because of dairy issues in the family. So good! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I made it as written.  My kids wouldn't eat them   Very bitter taste that could only be hidden with copious amounts of syrup - which kind of ruins the whole idea of eating healthy waffles.  We like the Mayo Clinic whole grain waffle recipe lots more.

Super yummy. I made these for Father's day along with a blackberry topping. I couldn't find whole wheat pastry flour. So I used regular pastry flour instead.   Everyone loved them. I made a double recipe and froze the left overs. The kiddos come down every morning screaming "WAFFLES". I don't get that with the box waffles.

Nice recipe. I used whole flax seeds as I didn't want to mess up the blender. Kept everything else the same. Kids loved them. I was pleased of the quantity they yielded without using too much of any one ingredient.

The only substition I made was using butter for the canola oil, as I did not have any oil other than some strong tasting olive oil.  These waffles had an OK flavor, but were not crisp, nor light.  They were heavy and very moist/dense.  Not a fan.  I gave them three stars as it may have been my fault for using butter, but I've **never** had an issue with it before and I cook an awful lot.

Made these again, this time soaking the flour the night before (with a tbsp of ACV for acidity), and while this time they cam out light, they were still very moist and soggy, did not crisp up at all. Maybe it's my waffle maker?  They do however, taste better when the flour is soaked.

As other reviewers said, this recipe is excellent - light, crispy, flavorful - for those skipping the flaxseed meal, I would recommend actually using it, because it really elevates the flavor. A couple of notes though - I made this in a standard round Belgian waffle maker and it only made exactly 5 waffles, not 6. Also, I found that I had to cook the waffles twice as long as regular waffles for the inside to hold together. Could just be the waffle-maker I'm using.

This is an amazing recipe!!  So light and fluffy.  I had to make a few modifications based on what I had on had, but it turned out great.  I subbed white whole wheat flour for the pasty flour, and I didn't have any wheat germ or all-purpose flour on hand, so I used 1/2 cup of cake flour to cover both of those.  Best waffles I've ever had!  Thanks!!

Super good! I put a little peanut butter and bananas on top and it tasted so yummy! My kids really liked them too with some maple syrup. Great way to get all the healthy stuff in and make it still taste great. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Have made this MANY times.  I just grind my white wheat for the flour.  Only needs 1/4 c. flax seed meal and 2 tsp baking powder (you can taste it when you put 4 tsp!)

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  The kids preferred the traditional waffles, however, they still gobbled them up.  I didn't have w/w pastry flour, so I just used plain w/w.  I also substituted oatmeal for the flax.  To the person that said that the batter was too runny --  I recommend letting the batter rest for 5 minutes then stir again.  This will thicken it up significantly.  I also recommend that they are eaten right off the waffle grill, if not they do get very soft, limp and chewy.  A big thumbs up :)

These do not taste healthy and they are! (if you can limit yourself to a normal serving).  I did not have ww pastry flour so used half ww flour and half all purpose flour.  Other than that I followed the instructions.  On the George Foreman waffle maker it made 5 large waffles.

I made this recipe, as written, for our 3 yr old SUPER picky daughter and they're a HUGE hit! She says they taste like muffins! LOL! We no longer buy her usual frozen waffles ... they've been replaced with these ... and has TWO! They've passed the ultimate test & deserve all 5 stars ... and then some!

Great recipe!  You would never know how much healthy stuff is in there.  The only substitution I made was 1/4 c. oats + 1/4 c. flax meal in place of the 1/2 c. flax meal.  Will definitely make again and again!

Didn't change a thing.  Used a whisk to beat which worked better for me than beaters.  It's GREAT to have a healthy waffle recipe for my kids.  The best waffles we've ever made. Delicious!  Thank you

These have become a Sunday morning favorite in my house! I make a double batch and freeze two to a ziploc so that they can be thrown in the toaster during the weekday mornings.  I do add dried cranberries and use all wheat germ, vanilla almond milk and egg beaters.

Made it Vegan for my daughter. substituting eggs with 1/4 cup more applesauce and 1/4 cup of water.  The griddle did need oil sprayed each time to prevent sticking.  Wonderful!

Excellent! - made a couple changes:   - did not have wheat flour, used unbleached white - decr flax to 1/4 and incr wheat germ to 1/2 = nutty flavor - added 1/2 oats  Took them to work and got rave reviews from everyone on how Moist they were. I have been looking for a more nutritious waffle recipe and am Thrilled with this one! A great way to get vitamins to kids.  :)  A double recipe tastes just as good and are great 2 & 3 days later.

Graintastic!!!!!!!!!!!! I made these this morning and everyone loved these. They are more filling and have a nutty taste. I substitued applebutter for applesauce to give it a slightly sweeter taste.

Even my sister in law who does not normally like waffles loved these! I made them for a big family brunch and everyone loved them. I didnt have pastry flour so I used regular ww flour, which worked out fine. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a wonderful heathy whole grain recipe. I didn't have flaxseed meal so I used organic corn meal so it had the same cruchy bits. I also exchanged brown sugar for white. My kids ate them up.

Delicious!  My grandson requested waffles today, but we were out of the uninspired boxed mix, so came here to find waffle recipe.  This one had good reviews, plus since we are trying to eat healthier anyway, we happened to have all ingredients on hand (including the flax seed meal - we took regular flax seeds and ran them through the blender until ground).  These tasted wonderful with or without syrup, grandson ate them up, daughter and I also loved them.  We made it exactly as the recipe specified.  I didn't feel like anything needed to be changed, and we loved the fact that they were tasty with wholesome ingredients.  Bravo!

Delicious!! My son was skeptical and complained about not being his usual (Bisquick) waffles. But after eating them, he loved them! I didn't have wheat germ, so I made up for it with wheat and white flour. Such a better flavor and better for you too!

Just as other reviewers have stated, this is a fantastic recipe that yields light, delicious, nutty-flavoured waffles with a perfect texture and excellent nutrition. I regularly substitute soy milk and they turn out perfectly every time. Leftovers also freeze really well.

I love how healthy these are.  I gave it only 4 stars because this is my first time making or eating waffles - so I have nothing to compare it to, however, they turned out beautifully and my children devoured them.

Yummy!!!  These were light,  fluffy and delicious.   I made a few alterations - I used mashed bananas instead of applesauce and I added 1 T of brown sugar.   The kids gobbled them up!

Have made this recipe several times and it is by far the best waffles I have ever eaten.  I Always thought flax seed & wheat germ was something health nuts ate, but my brother convinced me to try them.  Last time I made this recipe, I did not have any apple sauce so I substituted cranberry sauce and it was also great.

This wax excellent! I tried making waffles once and it was a disaster and my waffle iron, a lovely wedding gift, has been haunting me. So this morning I decided to take another try and this was great! I didn't have applesauce and I don't use canola so I substituted 1/3 cup coconut oil total for oil content (it did chunk up in the cold milk but it still worked great). Thank you!

The flavor of these waffles were better than I expected for a whole grain waffle.  What bumped them from a 4 to a 5 star rating for me what the texture.  They were nice and crispy on the outside, but soft and yummy on the inside.   I had these with the blueberry sauce recipe from this site - absolutely amazing!!  All 4 of my boys liked them as well.

OMG totally light and crispy! Instead of the flax ect. I used a 12 grain organic cereal and spelt instead of the w.w pastry flour, soya and olive oil. Doubled for the freezer too!

Excellent whole grain waffles. I expected these to be dense, but to my delight they were very light. Just used freshly gound soft white whole wheat flour  for the flax (I think added the flax would make them not stick to the pan so much).  Thanks for sharing!

My new waffle recipe! These are absolutely wonderful. The amount of flax meal kinda scared me, so I replaced 3/4 of the flax seed with oats ground up in my coffee grinder (1/4 c. + 2 T. oats), and used 1/4 of the remaining flax meal (2 T. flax meal). The batter was very runny, so I let it set up for 5-10 minutes before cooking, and the batter became the perfect consistency.

I've been making these waffles for awhile now and have yet to find anything I like better. Very easy to make (one bowl which is nice). For a nice twist, I sometimes will substitute a mashed banana for the apple sauce (one medium banana is about 1/4 c) and then substitute the 1/4 c oil for 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of peanut/almond butter. Comes out great with a subtle peanut butter and banana flavor.  Also, I've found that about 3/4 c of batter is the right amount for my waffle maker to avoid over-filling.

OHMYGoodness Good! My kids eat these like they are going out of style and even their friends rave about them (and remember them when they sleep over again!!!) I don't keep all-purpose - so I sub brown rice flour and I don't mill the flax - and they are still awesome - and healthful for the whole family!  I serve with unsweetened applesauce instead of maple syrup....thanks for the great recipie - it's a once a week-er (and I double it!!!)

Also makes great pancakes (just cut back on the oil). This is an easy and delicious way to add  another superfood, flax, to our diets.

These were great!  Very light.  Don't know if it made a difference, but beat the eggs very well, until a little foamy.  We used buttermilk instead of skim milk (if using buttermilk, less salt is needed).  Will definitely make again.

I didn't use whole wheat pastry flour-just whole wheat flour. Delicious!

Very yummy and even my family that doesn't always like whole grains liked them.  I did add blueberries after I ate the first one...they just screamed for this addition.  Oh, and I didn't have the whole wheat pastry for whole wheat bread flour since that was what I had.

yum.....a little ry and boring alone, but I made the "Supreme Strawberry Topping" to go on it and then sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on them....amazing!  I also used oatmeal because I did not have flax seed meal....yum, will definitely make again (without feeling too guilty about eating all those carbs!)

Super, delicious, light and fluffy waffles!  My old healthy-waffle recipe is no more -- this will be my go-to recipe from now on.  The taste is outstanding!  I was a little scared because the batter was a little runny and lumpy, but when the waffles were done ... wow!  Great recipe!

Perfect as written!  I think next time I'll try brown sugar in place of white. UPDATE: I used this recipe to make gluten-free waffles: For the whole wheat I substituted buckwheat flour; for wheat germ I used coconut flour; in place of the all-purpose I used brown rice flour; I also substituted half the flax with ground walnuts. I increased the amount of baking powder by half to compensate for the lack of gluten. It made a wonderful GF waffle!!! This will be my go-to recipe for both whole wheat and GF waffles.  Very versatile recipe.

Yum... these waffles are so delicious you won't believe they are healthy too!  I replaced all the oil with applesauce.  Next time I won't add salt as they were salty enough from the baking powder.  I  used soymilk instead of dairy.  My kids loved these too!

These are so good!  I make them with mashed banana and my kids request them.  Make extra and throw them in the freezer, great for a quick breakfast or just a snack.

These were FANTASTIC waffles. My four year old told me they were the best ever and my husband said they are a win. I have been experimenting with healthy recipes for a few years and it is hard to get a win from my two loved ones. When I told my husband what I was making for breakfast he said oh no because of the ingredient list. As he was eating them he said it was so surprised at how delicious they were and to save this recipe. I did make a few adjustments. I used powdered milk, (mixed ¼ + 3 tablespoons with 1 ¾ cups water) omitted the oil and used ½ cup applesauce. I used hard white wheat in place of the wheat pastry flower, honey replacing the sugar and added a handful of frozen blueberries.  I will be making these again soon and I think I will try replacing the all purpose flour next with either more hard white or red wheat.  My family is very happy to have found a healthy and very yummy waffle. Thank you!

I agree with the rating. These are the best waffles I've ever had. The only change I made was in oil. I used grapeseed instead. Out with the old recipe.

Excellent taste....not too "whole grainy" taste.  Made for a brunch and was loved by everyone. Hint: Even with a no-stick waffle iron...you will need to spray iron each time, or they will stick. Will definately make again...as we are BIG waffle fans!

I've been changing around my waffle recipes for a few years trying to make them healthier, but still yummy. It's always been one or the other, but these are healthy, light and delicious!! Thank you. I did use more applesauce and less oil..

Great tasting waffles!!  Thought they were way better than any "unhealthy" ones I've tried.  I didn't have flax seed or wheat germ so used ground oatmeal.  I also sprinkled some dried fruit on top of the uncooked waffles - the fruit baked in nicely and added a wonderful flavor.  Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed.

Delicious!  I had to substitute ground oatmeal for the wheat germ and grape seed oil for the canola because that is what I had on hand.  The recipe I have used for years has you separate the eggs and whip the egg whites.  I may try that with this recipe next time, but it is not necessary.  Thanks for sharing this!

Great recipe. They were lighter than I was expecting. My kids loved them. I followed the suggestion of making them with a blueberry sauce. I used the recipe on the website and they were delicious. I even liked the sauce better than syrup.

Just because they're good for you doesn't mean they don't taste awesome!  This recipe is not just for health nuts, so don't pass it by when you see wheat germ, flax seed, whole wheat flour, etc.  I used whole wheat flour rather than pastry flour and they turned out great.  While I normally only like crispy waffles, these softer waffles absorbed the butter and syrup perfectly (okay, so I found a way to make it less healthy).  Yum, yum!

I loved this recipe! Very healthy and yummy... but I do feel a little guilty giving it 5 stars because my kids only ate about 1 each, when they normally eat 2-3. I'm pretending the wheat just filled 'um up :)

This is a really great recipe. I followed it exactly and they turned out great. I topped them with vanilla yogurt and apricot preserves. A new weekend favorite! I had leftovers so I kept them in the fridge and reheated in the toaster oven, they were just as good leftover. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a good basic recipe. I made it on my new George Foreman. The only substitution I made was for the wheat germ (put in quick cooking oats)and oil (more applesauce). I think the next time I make these I will add in fruit or chocolate chips and still keep it healthy.

I made exactly as directed.  These waffles wouldn't get crisp until I toasted them in the toaster oven.  The taste is okay - they taste like healthy waffles, but don't taste bad.  I'll eat them because I like that they are good for me, but I wouldn't serve them to guests.

The flavor is amazing!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, EXCEPT I did not have wheat germ... so I just left that out.  I only wish they were crunchier.

These were alright, you could definitely taste that they are healthy and they are not sweet. That said, they aren't bad, especially for healthy waffles, I'm just not sure I would make them again.

I use this recipe all the time! I stopped buying frozen waffles for my family and make this recipe in batches for the weekend. They freeze great and just pop into the toaster oven. It is also a great recipe to play around with. I've substituted the apple sauce with banana, pumpkin and other fruit. It really makes a nice base recipe to start from. Yum! We love them and they're healthy!

These are very good - no one notices how healthy they are!  I don't generally have wheat germ, so I just use extra whole wheat flour instead.  I love the texture and the taste, and they fill you up!

My children, husband and I all enjoyed these! I didn't have wheat germ so I just added extra flax seed - I also used all whole wheat! A Keeper for sure.

These are SOOO good! I love the flavor, I think it was the flaxseed that gave them such a distinct flavor. They were soft and moist... and DELICIOUS!

These are absolutely the best waffles my husband and I have eaten. Don't let the "whole grain" part scare you, these are so light and fluffy. I make a double batch and freeze them.  When you want to eat them put them in the toaster oven @ 350 degrees for 3-5 minutes and they are soooo good!  This is the only waffle recipe I use.

These are really good whole grain waffles. I left out the flax, and substited wheat germ because I like the taste of wheat not flax.

This recipe will be one I make often I can tell.  I used 1/2 cup applesauce and omitted the oil and it worked just fine.  I didn't have WW pastry flour, so I used WW flour.  I used 1/2 cup wheat germ and 1/4 flax instead of the opposite as the recipe calls.  My kids, ages 5 and 4, gobbled these up!  The leftovers went into the freezer for grab and go freezer waffles (goodbye Eggo!)

These are very good.  The only thing I changed was I used all applesauce in place of the oil and I used half milk and half half-n-half.  I added blueberries, but think they would be really good with chocolate chips.  ;-)  The only problem I had with them is that they were very soft so a bit hard to get out of the waffle iron.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

These taste so much better than I thought they would! I followed the recipe as written mostly but with just a few changes: I ommitted the wheat germ and used oats instead, I added blueberries, and I also added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  My kids even loved these, which considering how healthy they are means they are going to become a staple in my home.

These were so delicious it's not funny!  And with all those good things in them it's hard to pass up.  The recipe is also so open to changes, you can substitute or add anything you like and they will still be perfect.  This is definitely a must-try recipe!

very, very good.  I made some applesauce in my slowcooker using a recipe from this site and wanted to use it in a recipe.  Made these waffles for breakfast served with homemade pear conserve and we loved them.  Will definitely be making them again-and will also make muffins using the batter next time.

Good Stuff.  Didn't have wheat germ on hand so I just used 1/2 cup white flour.  Also: if you grind your own flaxseed, measure out a generous 1/4 cup of seed.  It almost doubles in volume when ground.

MMM, MMM Good!  These are the best waffles I've ever had!  I'll never go back to the box mix.  I followed the reviews and omitted 1/2 cup of milk, and I used melted coconut oil instead of the canola.  Coconut oil has some great health benefits, AND it added a wonderful flavor and aroma to the waffles.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

I accidentally left out the AP flour and they were still wonderful.  9 servings made 8 belgium waffles. These needed to cook longer and at a higher temp. than white waffles, but the result was PERFECT.

Excellent!  I'm always looking for new whole grain recipes, and this one is superb.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but the second time I substituted the skim milk with soy milk, since my husband has to limit his dairy intake and we couldn't notice any difference.  My kids love this recipe also!  I make double batches so I have lots of leftovers...which are great heated in the toaster, and we love to top them with syrup or a fruit puree.  My 7 year old likes them as much as the frozen Eggo waffles.

These are a breeze to make. 

Because these are healthy, they keep you fuller for much longer than your average waffle or french toast breakfast, giving you a lasting feeling of satiety. 

Next time, gonna sprinkle in some chopped walnuts and/or pecans. Yummy!!!

Wow!  Surprisingly delicious - light, crispy, and really good for you!  I didn't even feel bad using syrup b/c they were so good for me.  (I love syrup despite the sugar content!)  Great idea from other reviewer about adding mashed fruit/sweet potato for more variations.

A great recipe that I'll add to my keep folder!  I used whole wheat all purpose instead of whole wheat pastry flour.  I also added an extra 1/2 cup to thicken the batter for pancake consistency instead of waffle consistency.  The pancakes are very filling and a little goes a long way.

This is an excellent waffle recipe.  I didn't have flax seed meal so I increased the flour and added a 1/4 cup oatmeal.  Next time I'm going to add some cinnamon to add a little extra flavor.

These were really good.  I was expecting them to be as heavy as bricks, but they were surprisingly light.  I accidentally grabbed oat bran instead of wheat germ and didn't notice until I dumped it in, but it was still really good.  Thank you.

Love the flavor of these.  That was even after reading the reviews and realizing I TOTALLY messed up the recipe.  I completely left out the white flour and instead used only a total of 1/4 cup whole wheat flour (on accident).  Gee!  Anyway, on purpose I Left out the oil and used a total of 3/4 cup flax meal.  I DEFINITELY needed cooking spray on the waffle iron to make sure they released, and took a "long" time to cook.  YUM!!!  Maybe I will try it again the "right" way and see if they are even better. LOL.

I was skeptical because I love waffles and I wasn't sure how this would turn out but they are great. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a healthy alternative for waffles.

Excellent waffles! I like mine crispy with natural peanut butter and my husband covers his with yogurt and walnuts. Left overs warmed up great in the toaster.

I've been making this recipe for quite some time and the only substitutions I make is to use 2T brown sugar for the sugar and use cinnamon applesauce.  This is an awesome recipe!

Wowza, these are delicious.  My husband usually requires butter on his waffles - not this time!  What a healthy alternative.  I had no germ on hand so I subbed additional flax/flour.  I served with a strawberry puree...yum.

Excellent! Halfway through prep I discovered I was out of WW pastry flour and substituted oat bran flour. We all loved them.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.

The flavor was delicious, but mine didn't turn out crisp on the outside like it should.  It had the texture of a pancake.  I'm giving it 4 stars for flavor.  If the texture was there, it would have been 5 stars.

I have been looking for a great whole grain waffle recipe and this one is it! All I added differently was a handful of crushed walnuts. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Better than any whole grain recipe I've ever had.

Good stuff!  Everyone loved it.  Comes out a little denser than your typical waffles but still great and healthy.  We added fresh blueberries to them!

Wow very impressive.  I thought these were great and never would have known they were "healthy" if I hadn't made them myself.  I couldn't find whole wheat pastry flour so used regular whole wheat flour.  I also used egg beaters instead of eggs and Splenda instead of sugar.

Truly magnificent waffles - and you can feel good feeding them to your family.  We almost always double it so we can freeze them for mornings we are running late or PBJ sandwiches for my daughter.

Yummy :)  I didn't have any flax seed so I used ground oatmeal instead.  The batter was extremely thin so I added a bit of extra flour.  They came out delicious!  I love the crunchiness of wheat germ and the wholesome taste that these have.  Served with light butter and low sugar syrup - what a delicous (and healthy!) breakfast :)

I was surprised that these waffles tasted soooo good - something this healthy often doesn't taste this great.  I like to eat them with fresh strawberries and maple syrup.
