This was a great salad! However I believe the dressing ratios are incorrect. I tried it with 50/50 vinegar to olive oil and would have gagged on vinegar. The olive oil amount has to be doubled in the recipe! Then it truely is perfect in my opinion. I used leaf lettuce roma tomatoes and an English cucumber. I also did about 1/2 the recipe and it did not seem to be a problem. Other than that I followed the recipe except I didn't add any black pepper because I don't care for it. After we started eating it I realized I forgot to add the garlic! Either way it was tasty so I guess it was a fine mistake. Plus I didn't have to worry about garlic breath after dinner. Great simple salad. Try it just remember to double the olive oil!

This is an excellent recipe and my favorite salad! We make it with spinach and I do think the rubbing makes the salad even better. We make this salad several times a week. Sometimes I substitute sun-dried tomatoes if I'm out of fresh tomatoes. Definitely give this one a try!

This was delicious but in all honesty I don't think the massaging made any difference at all. I made it with an English cucumber that I had peeled strips of skin off with a veggie peeler and basil and sun-dried tomato feta. Oh and white balsamic vinegar (LOVE that stuff!). Thanks!

This was good but added some artichoke hearts and greek olives to it- I love the taste of balsamic vinegar so the ratio was perfect

excellent my husband and i were licking our plates when the salad was all gone! I also did not "rub" the lettuce. I marinated everything except the lettuce for a few hours then poured it over the top of the lettuce as you would a dressing. I would also add that crumbled baked pita chips on top for "croutons" are an amazing addition to this salad!

Great salad BUT I found it a little bland. I added 2 tbsp of lemon juice and that took care of it. Also a few extra garlic cloves. My husband loved it!

Great simple and fast salad but I added a little more garlic and a lot of fresh cracked pepper. It was definitely fun to "rub" it though!

This is such a great idea! I've "rubbed" many salads since I found this recipe.

This was pretty good but the dressing was a little bland. Next time I will leave the oil out.

The rubbing business didn't make sense to me; the recipe is excellent without it.

This is the best salad. It has so much flavor and easy to make. The dressing is great on any salad. I always have the ingredients on hand and its low in calories.

We love this salad. In the summer I serve it with grilled chicken or steak and in the winter with a warm soup. I didn't change a thing!
