We substituted Fresh Folly River(SC) Oysters for the clams and added a little lemon juice and it turned out excellent!  We chopped everything by hand and used a mixer instead of a blender which gave it a chunkier effect.  Topped it with fresh oysters, more sundried tomatoes and parsley to give it a more festive look!

The recipe is so easy and fast to make.  I make it in a food processor and it turns out great!  There's no need to alter the recipe.  I get compliments on it every time I make it...now I get special requests for it!  People who don't like clams will even eat it.
