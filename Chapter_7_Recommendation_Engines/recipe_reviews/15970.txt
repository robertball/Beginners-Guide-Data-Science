YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE!!!! Simply delicious. I halved the recipe and used a 2 quart glass baking pan. I reduced the pumpkin pie spice to 1 1/2 tsp total and didn't measure the whipped topping when adding it to the top most layer. I was afraid I wouldn't care for the crust (especially because I'm not a huge fan of pecans) but it was PERFECT so please try it before you change it. This is one of those recipes you just want to keep eating. Dangerously good!!! **Don't forget to set the cream cheese & butter out to soften and the whipped topping should be in the fridge not freezer so it's easy to work with!**

I made this for a Thanksgiving party and it was a really big hit! The finished product was delicious and I would recommend this to anyone who really wants to take their time cooking. This is also great for children...I'm young myself. Very great dish!

This was delicious!!  I wasn't up for trying a 'real' cheesecake at the moment.  Saw this one thought it sounded perfect.  I used a graham cracker crust as I'm not a fan of pecans.  (1/2 butter, melted, 1 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs and 2 Tbsp sugar)  Perfect!! Note: Springform pan highly suggested. It made a huge mound in my standard pie pan.

I made this while testing out different recipes for Thanksgiving.  This was delicious!  Since I'm hypoglycemic and am watching my weight, I made this with Splenda, low-fat, sugar-free pudding mix, skim milk, low-fat cream cheese and low-fat butter.  I'm sure this will be a big hit at Thanksgiving this year!

This recipe is awesome! It came out perfect and the crust is to die for. I shared it with my family and some co-workers and everyone just loves it. I didnt find it to be too rich but I noticed that the taste really changes with the different kinds of cream cheese you use. I used a regular cream cheese and it came out really sweet but delicious and again with an organic cream cheese and it came out more creamy than sweet. Maybe that'll help out for anyone who found it to be too rich.

Yummy, very rich so don't need big portions, can also dot with dried cranberries on the top.  And after making this about 6 times, I messed up and didn't reserve whipped topping, it all went into the pumpkin layer and hey, it's great that way and easier as well!  : )

This pumkin cheesecake is really good!! I must admit,the first day my family thought the pumkin puree tasted a bit like baby food but I noticed the longer it was in the fridge the firmer it got. So my only advice is make it a day ahead of time it makes a huge difference!

This was an awesome dessert! I followed the directions, made no changes and it came out perfect. Although there was a regular pumpkin pie there also, no one touched it, and they all raved about the Pumpkin Cheesecake. I will definately serve this again!

This recipe turned out great for me. I found that there was too much pumpkin spice in it. I think that it is my pumpkin spice and not the recipe. However, next time I would start with 1/4 of what is called for and then go up from there. Thank you for this recipe, I will try it again with less spice, which I am sure will make it a 5 star recipe.

First and foremost, I hate, hate hate pumpkin or sweet potato. Having tried a pumpkin cheesecake roll several years ago and loved it, I knew with the cream cheese, I couldn't go wrong. My husband loves 4 layer delight. This seems very close to that only with pumpkin instead of chocolate. So far 3 of my 5 family members have tried it and all like it. If it weren't for the roast, potatoes and green beans, I might have room for a serving of this but will have to wait til tomorrow. Couldn't resist a bite trying it though and it's fabulous. Definitely a keeper for a "not so pumpkin person". Would like to add that I made my own homemade spice seasoning and didn't have allspice, so that was eliminated. Great job!!

I halved the filling portion of this recipe and used a homemade graham cracker crust for this.  It was awesome!  I also used 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp each nutmeg, cloves, ground ginger and allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice.  If I make it for a large group I will try it with the shortbread pecan crust.  I bet its yummy!!

Not bad, but I was overall a little disappointed in this.  Definitely cut down a little on the pumpkin pie spice.  Maybe I wanted this to come out of the pan in perfect squares, but it was really messy.  It tasted good, just not exactly what I wanted.

Loved this! The crust was amazing! My only complaint is that the filling was a bit runny, but that might be my own fault; I made my own whipped cream instead of Cool Whip and am wondering if that affected the consistency.

Quick. Easy. Just set out all the ingredients to thaw or soften well before you start...everything should go quick that way. Used the recipe on this site for pumpkin spice since I didn't have any...good stuff. Oh, and I halved the recipe and filled an 8x8 dish. Thanks

This is a great recipe! Easy to make. I found that the longer it chilled the better it was. After chilling one hour, it wasn't set up as nice as after 3 hours. Made it for husban's board meeting and the guys loved it!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was yummy! I didn't think the crust was going to be that good, but SURPRISE, it was very good. People loved the crust and were shocked at how simple it was. Very good recipe. Would definitely recommend!

This recipe is great if you are wanting a light pumpkin dessert.  I make this one and the Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake on this website.  The Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake if much richer so it's all in what you're in the mood for.

Loved it!  I used the filling and put it into a pie crust. It made two pies that were delicious, not as heavy and thick as a typical pumpkin pie, which I enjoyed.

Considering I'm not a huge pumpkin pie fan, nor a cheesecake fan...this was fantastic.  My whole family loved it!  It is very rich and makes a huge amount (almost too much for the 4 of us).  Great recipe!

Oh yeah, this is awesome! Took it to a party last night and everyone asked to have a plate of left-overs. It is quite light as far as a dessert, so it doesn't leave you feeling heavy. The Cheesecake layer is to die for and mixes with the pumpkin layer nicely.

My daughter made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it, even the pumpkin haters. She made it a second time to take to a party but we didn't have 2 pkgs. of vanilla pudding. So, we used 1 vanilla and  1 butterscotch; it was great too!

This was too sweet for me, and I am a huge fan of the sweets!  My family liked it, but I have tasted better pumpkin cheesecake combinations.  I'm going to look for something else next time.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  Super easy and everyone asked for the recipe.  My sister declared it her favorite pumpkin dessert.  I had 12 people over and we had it for dessert for two meals. I used three recipes from this website for Thanksgiving and they all received rave reviews.

This is outstanding!! I dont think of it as cheesecake though. Its more like a pudding type dessert. The crust is so good- it really makes the dish. I made it for a large group and everyone loved it.

Very good! I made a gram cracker crust because we have a nut allergy in the family. Turned out really good. Complemented the pumpkin. And I also only put in about a third of the pumpkin spice on the recipe. Will definitely make again!!

Perfect pumpkin dessert, especially if you don't care for the heaviness of pumpkin pie.  First time I made it was for Thanksgiving, it was a big hit!  Next time I make it, I probably will make more of the cream cheese layer, since it seemed to be overpowered a bit by the pumpkin layer. But it still was a delicious dessert when I made it to the recipe specifications!!

This was great. I had to use a graham cracker crust, and I sprinkled the top heavily with nutmeg.

Made this tonight for a small group of friends..they all loved it. The only thing I did differently was I used pumpkin pie filling instead of puree and the spices.  So much easier and it was delicious! !! Will be making this again.

This was delish, but the second time I halved the recipe, and used solid pumpkin (Libbys),  doubled the pumpkin custard, and made 1/2 the crust because to me it was a bit much.. and to me it came out perfect..my mother in law is in love with this one :)

This was really good... though the taste of pumpkin could have been stronger IMO.  I might make a thicker pumpkin layer next time.  Everyone of our 10 guests enjoyed it - it's perfect for after a heavy turkey dinner.  I used whipping cream in place of the whipped topping...for those who had a problem  getting it to set - if you used whipping cream, you only need half the volume to that of the whipped topping. ***Update:  I've changed my rating of 4 stars to 5.  I had a piece of this cheesecake that I'd made yesterday - a day makes all the difference.  Another reviewer had made the same observation.  Make it the day before because 24 hours really does make a huge difference  - the time allows the flavours to develop and meld together.  I will make no changes next time I make it other than to ensure I make it the day before.

This is a wonderful combination of cream cheese and pumpkin.  The flavors go together perfectly.  I made this and shared with family and everyone loved it.   I made it again today to go with Thanksgiving dinner.  Yummmm, can't wait to eat :)

The crust is amazing. I wanted to forgo a traditional cheesecake this year and came across this recipe and tested it out. It was easy, delicious and a big hit. Making more for Thanksgiving day. I recommend making this a day ahead, as the longer it sits in the fridge the better.

Delicious! Everyone loved it! Decreased the pumpkin pie spice to 2 tsps because of comments but probably would have been fine with the four. Very easy! Made it a day ahead and it was wonderful!

really delicious combination of flavors and textures.  the crust is crispy and delicious --can be used for many other dishes and you can even substitute the sugar with splenda with marvelous results.  will give non-pumpkin lovers the most pleasant surprise.

This was absolutely delicious, but I must have done something wrong because it was still runny when it was time to serve it.  The flavor was delicious, and I will definitely try it again, once I figure out why it never solidified for me.

This got 50/50 reviews by my guests.  Half loved it the other half said OK but not fantastic.  IMO, the pumpkin pie layer overshadowed the cheesecake layer and it was kinda like why not just save the tremendous amount of fat and calories and have regular pumpkin pie.
