Waaay too much flour for the amount of butter. I finally thinned with a little white wine. I also used the new "Orange Tomato soup"

!/2 cup flour seemed like too much and was extremely lumpy. 2 TBSP seems like it would work better.

First Thank you Hannah for submitting this recipe. This is the recipe my family used back in the 1960's. I haven't had this in over 26 years. We started to lessen the amounts of ingredients for our small family. It went well and I will definitely make it again.
