Awesome. I used corvina and seafood seasoning instead of parsley. Family loved it.

We made a gluten-free version, using Ian's gluten-free panko and Pamela's all-purpose GF flour. (Tip: rather than try to roll the egg-covered fish stick in the panko, set in on top of a shallow bowl of panko, and heap more panko against sides and top.)
