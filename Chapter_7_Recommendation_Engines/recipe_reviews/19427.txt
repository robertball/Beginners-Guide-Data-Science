Woweeeee!  This Mac & Cheese is everything I wanted.  Cheesy, creamy and gooey.  Per other reviews I used 2 cans of soup, 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I heated the milk and added everything (including most of the cheese)to the noodles after draining them and they blended perfectly.  Put the rest of the cheese on top and sprinkled with paprika.  Don't forget to salt the water when you boil your noodles or they will be flavorless.  No leftovers here! P.S.  I used sharp cheddar.

Made twice with great reviews from my guests.  Use a box 1/2 mac (24oz), two cans of cheese, 2 cups chedder/jack, 1 cup milk and a couple of scoups sour cream, little pepper and bread crumbs on top.  A couple of min under the broiler at the end and excellent.  The bread crumbs and extra cheese really make it.

I used this recipe and baked the macaroni and cheese in cupcake liners for my son's birthday party.  HUGE HIT.  The kids could help themselves and throw away the wrap when they were done.  I mixed the shredded cheese with the noodles and soup to make it extra cheesy, I used 1 tlbsp salt when stirring it up.  I put sprinkle of cheese and pinch of bread crumbs on top of each "cupcake".  They were soooo cheesey and were gone instantly!  Thanks for the great receipe.  It's definately a keeper in my house!  The boxed stuff can stay in the cupboard from now on.

Based on the previous reviews I added 2 cans of condensed cheese soup and a little extra milk. I threw in red and green bell pepper, chives, green chiles, salt, pepper, garlic and Kraft's Mexican blend cheese. I mixed the shredded cheese in with all the noodles rather than simply put it all on top and it came out creamy and delicious!!

Great recipe!  I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream, salt and pepper to taste and used Sharp and Medium Cheddar instead of Colby.  The Sharp Cheddar was mixed into the dish and the Medium Cheddar I sprinkled on top.  It was creamy even when reheated.

Woefully bland. Tasted like Campbell's soup and nothing else. After an endless parade of additions, including a tiny dab of mustard, some freshly grated nutmeg, a dash of cayenne, several splashes of half-and-half, a heaping spoonful of sour cream, a generous handful of grated extra sharp cheddar and some grated Parmesan, this finally came around to tasting respectable.  Much better and infinitely easier just to make your own white sauce and add grated/shredded cheese plus seasonings you like, stirring until cheese melts, then combining with the elbows. Unless you're into the flavor of Campbell's soup, throw this one back.

Excellent and simple recipe.  I like this because of its small list of ingredients and the fact that it has no eggs.  I use lots of coarse ground pepper to spice it up.

This was pretty good.  I added the extra can of cheese soup (I used cheddar cheese soup and broccoli cheese soup), the extra milk, and some spices (a few dashes each of pepper, paprika, garlic and onion powder, and chili powder).

I liked that this had no flour in it. I made as is, and it was ok. I will make this again and make some changes. A good base recipe that you could play around with.

Is macaroni & cheese the best comfort food, or what?  My only spin, in addition to what others have done (2 cans of soup, adding sour cream and paprika  - and some parsley for more color) is the addition of crispy fried onions. Don't knock it until you try it.  After I've cooked the pasta (any type, doesn't have to be macaroni - I especially like Barilla's line of mini pastas) and remove it from the pot, I fry a large onion in butter until it's crispy brown. Even the neighbors can smell it.   Then I add the soup, milk, cheese (I use  l lb of sharp cheddar and save some for the top), sour cream, a touch of salt and pepper plus a little bottled hot sauce.  Broil for a bit of crunch at the end, and you've got a weekend breakfast, lunch and dinner.

I whisked milk with two cans of the cheese soup, then added the cooked and drained pasta, stirring to combine.  In went a tablespoon of black pepper, and 8 oz. of shredded Colby cheese and mixed well.  Poured all into a baking dish, and covered with 8 oz. shredded Cheddar.  Perfection!!

I have tried sooo many mac n cheese recipes, and my family has hated them all.  This is the first homemade mac n cheese recipe I've made that they love.  I love how easy it is to make!  It did need two cans of soup, and I had about 1/2 cup sour cream I needed to use up, but other than that, no changes were made.  This will be in the regular rotation. :-)

Really cheesey and totally perfect comfort food...but yes I did adjust  Did one 16 ounce box of Penne pasta. Sauteed 1/2 small minced onion, added 1 can of evaporated milk, 1 huge dollop of sour cream, 1 cup plus of whole milk, 1 can of the cheddar cheese soup, 3 1/2 c of grated sharp cheddar and 2 handfuls of parmesan....salt, pepper a dash of dry mustard and just a bit of nutmeg.  Buttered a 2 1/2 qt casserole, topped the mac and cheese with the remaining half cup of grated cheddar. And melted 1 TB of butter and mixed that into 2 TB of bread crumbs and 1 TB of parmesan, and sprinkled that on top.  Baked lightly coverered with foil in 350 degree oven for 25 minutes, removed foil baked 5 minutes longer and then flipped to broil for 2 minutes....outstanding!

LOVE this recipe.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of milk and used a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Was very creamy and kept in the fridge well.  I make this for my kids and they eat every last bit!  Hubby and I like it too-  I have tried it with Colby and Cheddar, both are great.

This needed a lot more spices even though I took the recommendations of other reviewers.  This tasted like can cheese.  I am sorry, but I will not be making this again.

Followed other reviewers suggestions, added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream, 2 cans soup, 1 and 1/2 cups milk. Turned out very creamy, but bland. Next time I will use cheddar instead of Colby.

i can't say enough good things about this recipe. i have been making mac and cheese from scratch for years and years. but nothing tops the flavor and smoothness of this recipe which oh so cleverly uses cond. cheddar cheese soup. why go though the trouble of making roux when the cheese soup taste better?? i must say though, i add a can and a half of the soup (freeze remaining portion), a cup and a half milk and a  cheddar cheese to go with colby. i find that 12 oz macaroni plenty too. i love, love this recipe. thanks courtnay!!

This is a great base recipe.

I wanted to use what I had on hand, so instead of the cheddar cheese soup, I used the Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup. I used a combination of odds and ends of cheese I had on hand, which was a mixture of colby, sharp cheddar, little swiss, and 1/4 c. of parmesan cheese. I also threw in the last remains of a carton of sour cream, for added creaminess. To make a whole meal, I added in half of a chopped turkey ham. 
I made sure to heat the soup, cheeses, sour cream and milk before I added the macaroni. I also didn't cook the macaroni all the way through as I knew it would cook the rest of the way when I stuck it in the oven. I saved some of the shredded cheese to sprinkle on top to make a crispy, cheese crust. Yum. I'd make this again when I didn't want to spend the time making a roux. The whole family loved this. This filled a 9x13 baking dish. If I wanted to change it up, I'd add a couple cans of tuna fish for a cheesy tuna casserole.

(I don't know if the originator of this recipe was implying using a boxed macaroni and cheese. I used a cup and a half of elbow macaroni, which worked out great when combined with the turkey ham.)

This is a good recipe, however, I used cheddar cheese. My brother(who is a mac and cheese lover) loved it, but to me it was a bit bland.

Finally, a basic mac & cheese recipe that as given not only is easy the throw together, but tastes great too!  Like so many others I have tried several other mac & cheese recipes and they always have disappointed me in one way other another.  This one is a keeper for sure, thanks for sharing it with us.

I've made this before and it was good. I love the idea about baking it in the cupcake pan. So clever and easy to serve. I'm trying it tonight for a party preview!

Good, but could have used more flavor - either some spices or more cheeses or add-ins (like sausage).

Pros: the kids ate it up and it was super-easy and quick to make. Cons: personally I thought it was just "ok". If you are willing to spend a little time on it, you can make a much tastier mac & cheese. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to feed kids in a hurry when short on time.

This recipe is excellent.  I love the use of canned cheddar cheese soup.  This was the first time I prepared baked mac and cheese that my boyfriend didn't complain didn't taste like his mom's!  I prepared 8oz of macaroni but still used 1 full can of soup and I ended using half and half instead of milk about 3/4 cup(that's what I had in the kitchen) plus a heaping spoonful of sour cream like many reviewers.  Yummy deliciousness!  Thanks Courtnay! I will definitely prepare this dish over and over again.

I used 3/4 of a 16 oz. box of mini bow-tie pasta.  Instead of the whole milk, I used a 12 oz. can of carnation milk and 1/2 stick of butter (& 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper).  I used 8 oz. of colby and for the other 8 oz. I used a mixture, of cheddar, american, mozarella and provolone.  I baked it in an 8x12 glass casserole and in 30 minutes I had ooey gooey stringy cheesy goodness!  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked it but I did follow what a few other reviewers said they did. I added 2 cans of cream of cheese soup, and 1 1/2 cups of milk. Also didn't use the full pound of cheese but used most of it. I added paprika and black pepper for taste as well. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this last night with some tweaks to the recipe and got rave reviews. I did the changes others suggested--using 2 cans of soup, 1 1/2 cups of whole milk, and 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also used Sharp Cheddar cheese. I heated the soup, milk, and sour cream until it boiled, then I poured it over the warm, drained macaroni, stirring together. I put most of the cheese in the casserole itself, reserving 1 cup to sprinkle on the top. Then I took 1 cup of Panko breadcrumbs and mixed it with 2 tablespoons of melted butter and sprinkled that on the very top of the casserole. I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to get the top golden brown and crunchy. It was easy to make and had a big payoff--I'll definitely make this again!

Great recipe although I altered it a bit. Added 1 cup coked chopped up broccoli and isntead of chedder cheese soup I added 2 cans of Broccoli and Cheese soup. Didn't use Colby cheese either, just marbeled chedder. Delicious recipe and WAY cheaper than the traditional homemade M&C...Definitly will make this again!

Like most reviews, I added two and a half cans of cheese soup (two cans of ched. cheese and 1/2 can of ched/broc-it's what I had on hand) and a 1/2 cup of sour cream and a 1/2 cup of milk.  I also through in some bacon to add in some substance too. The consistancy was perfect!
I had to cook it a little longer than just 40 mins.  I wanted to see it get a little bubbly first.  I added a layer of cheese to the top, turned on the broiler to brown it a little bit and bam, it turned out perfect!  
This recipe will be a keeper!

After reading a dozen reviews, I decided the only thing to add was a little black pepper, a little parsley sprinkled on top along with some panko bread crumbs. Also I mixed 1/2 of the colby jack with the noodles and layered the other half on top.

The result was a hit with all of the guests of my 4th annual Daytona 500 party. I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

Best mac and cheese I have had!!  Followed the advice of others and did 2 cans of soup, 1.5 cups milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, 8 oz med cheddar & 8 oz sharp cheddar.  Smooth and delicious.  Left overs were still very creamy and dint dry out like a lot of previous recipes I have tried.

This recipe is quick and easy.  As a long time avid macaroni & cheese fan of only the boxed macaroni & cheese, I've been forced to switch to the homemade after trying this version.  My 4 year old begs me for this macaroni & cheese at least once a week.  I do prefer colby-jack over plain colby, but it's delicious either way.

This is awesome. I used 1/2 lb. each of Xsharp cheddar, colby and Montery jack plus I added a dash of nutmeg, paprika and dry mustard. I also added 1/4 cup sour cream, so good. Do not forget the bread crumbs, I used Italian to give it even more flavor

Not bad.  I didn't use as much pasta as required (because of all the other comments; instead of adding more milk and cheese, I just added less pasta).  It came out ok.  Not the best mac 'n cheese I've ever had, but it definitely works when your in a bind or don't want to do a whole lot of work.  I think it's the flavor of the cheddar cheese soup that makes it not as awesome as I was hoping.  I will probably make this again, whenever I'm feeling lazy but have a hankerin' for some mac 'n cheese.

This is really easy and has become a go-to recipe for me. I do the 2 cans of soup (which is almost impossible to find during the holidays), 1 1/2 cups of milk and 3/4 cup of sour cream. I also add salt and pepper and use Pepper Jack cheese in the mixture and triple cheddar on top. I find it easier to mix all the wet ingredients and salt and pepper with a mixer. My hand would get very tired trying to mix it to a no lumps consistency. Then I add the cheese and stir by hand and add this to my cooked macaroni.

This was a good starter recipe, makes it quick to cook. :) I added two cans of cheese soup, 1 cup of milk, about a tsp of garlic powder and crumbled up half a pound of bacon. warmed that all up, then mixed it with the cooked macaroni. baked it at 350 for 25 min, came out great. :)

Just took it out the oven. The taste is great. Doubled the can of cheese soup and used plenty of sharp cheddar cheese. Added a dollup of sour cream. Mixed all the indgredients in the strained pot of noodles. Very, very, very creamy. Very good. Get's five stars for taste and ease of use.

I used this recipe for thanksgiving with the fam.  I used 16 oz of noodles and a can and half of cheese soup, instead of one can.  Then, I mixed in black pepper, onion powder, and paprika.  I also used a mix of jack/colby cheese.  I mixed it in with the soup and noodles to make it extra cheesy.  Last, I topped it with seasoned bread crumbs and last of the jack/colby cheese and some paprika. IT WAS A HIT.  This is the recipe I'm using from now on!!!

I loved how easy this recipe was and that there was no cream sauce to make-you didn't have to dirty 10 pots just to get some mac-n-cheese.  I did add sour cream as many reviews suggested-but otherwise I followed the recipe.  It turned out nice and creamy.  My only reason for 4 stars is that I thought it was a bit bland.  Maybe some cracked pepper, seasoned salt, garlic...I don't know, but it is a great base to build on.

I used 2 cans of cheese soup and a scoop of sour cream based on the other notes and this recipe came out wonderfully.  My only comment is that it doesn't reheat very well, so I will probably half the recipe next time.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was use evaporated milk, about 1 1/4 cup, and I mixed in some of grated cheese with the pasta in addition to sprinkling it on the top. I'll be making this on a regular basis. Thanks for sharing!

This was one of the easiest and tastiest mac and cheese recipes that I have tried! I used about double the cheese and mixed half into the noodles and put the rest on top and baked. Definitely a keeper!

My family loves mac and cheese, for x-mas i used this recipe instead of my own and they all looked at me and asked what happened to it, it ended up being dry hardly any cheese and i even put a little more milk in it and still dry, i think next time i'll put more cheese or something it in the make it cheesy.

This was a really good and easy to make recipe.  I made a few adjustments though.  I used cheddar cheese instead of colby, and I used only about half of the cheese it called for to lower the fat content. Next time I may add more milk to make it creamier.  Delicous recipe!

This was really good.  I added bread crumbs on top.  I also was expecting it to be more creamy.  Maybe next time I will add a little more milk to make it creamier.

To my surprize I ran into an occasion that I was asked to make macaroni and cheese. It was a wonderful, filling,side dish for my mothers birthday party.I just topped it with bread crumbs because that's what I like.
I will recommend it to others.

I'm a single guy who is trying to cook more rather than buying fast food. As such I love quick, simple recipes that still taste like I did a lot of work. This recipe gets 5 stars from me for needing only 4 ingredients and 5 minutes of prep for creamy home made Mac And Cheese.

But you do need to add a second can of cheese and a little more milk as others have said. I added the sour cream but I'm not sure I couldn't have done without it. 

And it is in fact a bit bland without some seasoning. That's because of the canned cheese. I used season-all in mine and it was just the touch it needed. Simple salt and pepper would probably work just as well. just needs a little something to flavor the canned cheese. Great recipe! I'll do it this way from now on.

This is a great starter recipe. It's 4 stars, but 5 if you make it based on the previous reviewers suggestions. I used 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, 1.5 cups milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream. If you use the extra soup, I don't think you need as much of the shredded cheese. I used about 2 cups of mild cheddar. The first time I made it, I baked it, which was good, but my family prefers a creamy sauce for mac' n cheese, so this time, we didn't bake it. It still tastes great and was very creamy! Thanks for the recipe!

There aren't many great Baked Mac & Cheese that use cheese soup but this one is awesome! I didn't give it a five because there were a couple of things that I did to make it better:
I added a teaspoon of Spicy mustard to the milk and soup
I also added a cup of shredded cheddar to it. 
I layered the top with cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs
Almost as good as my grandmothers buttermilk Mac & Cheese!

Certainly nothing to brag about. Personally, I found that adding the cheese soup made it taste horrible. I guess it's an aquired taste.

This is everyone's new favorite mac and cheese!  I mixed the soup with a 1/2 cup of heavy cream, a big scoop of sour cream and about of cup (or more, probably more) of shredded cojack.  Mixed in the cooked pasta, generously salted and peppered, spread it in a 9x13, covered it with shredded cheddar and some bread crumbs, baked at 350 for about 25 minutes, outstanding!  Great recipe!  Thank you!

These were good, but lacking in flavor. I didn't add salt as I thought with the sodium content of the soup, it would be salty enough, but they were just ok. I did add a breadcrumb topping with melted butter and put in cupcake tins as these were for a 5 year old's birthday which turned out cute, but will definitely add some salt, pepper and dried mustard next time. This was super easy and has great potential. I did add more milk like other reviewed suggested.

I honestly thought this recipe was okay.  I made it exactly as described.  I found the top to be too cheesy and macaroni not cheesy enough.  Maybe Colby is not the right cheese for this.  In any case, I'm glad others liked it, but I think you need to find a way to spread the cheese more evenly, and do something to add some flavor.

Great recipe! I used 1.5 c milk, 2 cans of soup, mixed mild/sharp grated cheddar, 1 tbs Dejon mustard, and 1/2 c sour cream.  It is moist, cheesy and delicious. I will make this over and over.

I also used 2 cans of soup and instead of colby cheese i used a block of velveeta b/c that's what i had in. It was THE best mac n cheese i've ever had. I brought it to my in-laws for easter dinner and it was a huge hit and disappeared very fast!

Finally my quest for the perfect macaroni and cheese recipe has ended.  This is just perfect but instead of whole milk I used 1 cup of warmed evaporated milk and 1/2c of sour cream along with the pound of shredded sharp cheddar and 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, PERFECTION!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

simple but really really good. I added 1/4 a cup of sour cream just to add a little tang and smoothness to the sauce and it came out great. Also used a combination of colby & mild cheddar. really love the recipe. good baked mac & cheese recipes are hard to come by!

I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and used 2 cans of cheese soup instead of one from what I read from other reviews and it was very good!

This recipe was delicious. I used two cans of chedder soup along with Extra Sharp Chedder and Monteray Jack Cheese, blended everything over low heat, then added to the macaroni. It was delicious and actually tasted alot like Stoufer's mac and cheese!

Wonderful!!! Cheesy YUMNESS LOL. A recipe becomes yours by how you change it, add to it and fix it to your liking, but rate the recipe itself not one you altered first, because then you're rating your own!

This is a good start to the recipe I make.  I use 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup and one can of cream of celery.  I first sautee garlic and onions in oil. Add the soups, block of cheddar cheese and a can of whole milk for each can.  Stir until cheese and soups are melted. Add box of cooked macaroni and stir on stovetop. Pour into large baking dish and cover with breadcrumbs (can mix with some butter I do not). Bake for about 20 minutes @ 375 until bubbly.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe.  I took the advice of others and added 2 cans of soup, and mixed some of the cheese in with the noodles along with sprinkling it on top.  It still came out very bland, I think next time I will try adding some sour cream, a little more salt and pepper to try and spice it up!

Per other reviews, I used 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, however, I used shredded mild cheddar cheese. My family didn't like this as well as I thought they would. I may try the recipe again with Colby cheese and see if they like it better that way.

I used penne instead of macaroni because it's all that I had here.  I also used cheddar in place of the colby for the same reason.  It doesn't get any easier than this.  This was even better the next day.

I made it with 2 cans of soup instead of one and added sprinkled bread crumbs on top, but other than that I kept the recipe the same. It was a bit on the bland side, and could use some additions, but if all your looking for is plain mac and cheese than this is great.

Good mac and cheese. Here are the changes I make - 2 cans of soup, 2 cups milk and a little less than 16 oz of macaroni. Mix in about 1/2 of the cheese, and sprinkle the other half on top. I really like the flavor of the colby cheese in this.

I was just searching for a new mac n cheese recipe when I came across this...it is the same one I've been using for years!!! Except I use a lttle more milk, I fill up the soup can. I usually mix 1/2 the shredded cheese inside and sprinkle 1/2 on top. Then I sprinkle Italian breadcrumbs over the top. Very yummy!

Have been making macaroni & cheese starting with a flour/butter paste but the condensed Cheddar cheese soup is easier. Using a double boiler (sauce pan with stainless steel bowl) and following the advice of others: I cooked all the ingredients together to melt the cheese but here were the changes: 12 oz can of fat free evaporated skimmed milk instead and added 1/2 cup lite sour cream, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp garlic, 1/3 cup of frozen, chopped onions and an extra can of condensed, cheddar cheese. Any cheese works since you melt it in the double boiler: one pound of shredded, mild cheddar cheese, or, block of colby, cheddar cheese cut up. Last, sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs.

Followed the recipe but with a little more spice:
I added 1 tsp. chipotle hot sauce to the cheese mixture.  I also added 1 lb. low fat, bulk sausage crumbled and 1 cup (almost tender)cooked, chopped broccoli to the macaroni.  This came out looking stunning with great taste and texture!

This is so good.   My family is constantly requesting this for dinner.  I followed the directions with one exception.  I cut down the amount of noodles to about 12-14 ounces.  16 ounces is to much for the amount of sauce this recipe makes.

It was definitely easy, would be great for a potluck dish- not too time consuming or expensive to make.  I followed other suggestions to use two cans of soup and 1 & 1/2 cup milk.  I also added sauteed onion and garlic, lots of pepper and bread crumbs on top making it a little more "adult-ish."  Good and easy!  Will do again!

My hubby loved this. I gave it a 4 because I thought it lacked some flavor. I thought an additonal can of soup was a bit much, 1/2 of the 2nd can was perfect. A couple nice size scoops of sour cream, some pepper, a little nutmeg, and buttery bread crumbs would make this over the top. A 3 quart dish would work better for this as well. Don't get me wrong, my husband still thought this was the best mac and cheese he's ever tasted.

I felt that this was quite bland.  I am a cheese lover, and this recipe didn't have enough cheese in it for me.  I sprinkled bread crumbs and paprika on top and it had a little more taste.  Also,  I used a larger pan.

My only complaint so far with this recipe is that the author must have never made this dish as both the macaroni or the cheese fills a 2 QT dish by itself.  Forget about combining the two.  3 QT is the size to use.

This recipe was good and easy. I made a few changes. I mixed the macaroni, eggs, 1 cup of shredded cheese, both cans of cheese together in a bowl. Then I poured half in the baking pan, sprinkled chedder cheese over it, then poured the rest with more cheese on top. A little extra milk was needed.

made it using maybe 12oz of macaroni vs 16 the recipe calls for, added a can of cream of chicken soup, an extra 1/4 c milk, 3/4c med. salsa, a cpl slices of chopped onion, about 1 tbs thawed chopped gr pepper, about 1tsp Emeril seasoning and a cpl tbs of sour cream.  Also added a little leftover chicken breast (maybe only a 1/4 c)  Used shredded sharp cheddar chz instead of colby and about a handful of seasoned bread crumbs on top of the chz.   Kept in oven maybe 45min and 2-3min under broiler.  Something I added gave it a little kick.   I will make it this way again.

This was so easy to make! I added parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs to the top of mine. Next time, I'll add some cottage cheese to make it a bit more moist, but the overall flavor was a hit.

This was a really easy recipe, and my husband and stepkids gobbled it down! It made 1 2-1/2 quart Corning casserole dish + 1 small glass-covered casserole dish. The small dish was 1 serving. There was none left at the end of dinner! I was expecting a more creamy "sauce" for the macaroni, but the flavor was excellent. I'd like to try it with a breadcrumb topping.

I stayed to the recipe mostly.  To add some protein I sautéed half of a polish kielbasa and also 1/2 cup of chopped onion and a dash of minced garlic. I added this when mixing the cheese soup and milk was all together. And sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese. Served with steamed broccoli; this made a lovely mid week meal.

This was really good! I did tweak it a bit though. Per other users suggestions, I added 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup of sour cream. Instead of regular milk, I added a can of evaporated milk. I also added fresh breadcrumbs and fresh sliced tomato on top! Yum!

Recipe was very good but I did improvise and follow some suggestions from previous reviewers. I used sharp cheddar cheese, 2 cans of soup, added some greek all purpose seasoning, mixed about half the cheddar cheese into the noddles and used the other half for topping. I then finihshed it off with lanko bread crumbs. My family all loved it.

I made this last night for dinner and I have to say it wasn't great. I think it would be better if you mix half the cheese into the noodles then sprinkle rest on top and colby-jack or mild cheddar would be better cheeses to use. I think the recipe as it stands does not deserve 5 stars. Think most are rating this based on what they added to the recipe and that outcome.

Was looking for a baked macaroni and cheese that didn't taste like flour like other recipes I've tried and this recipe is just that!  I only used 3/4 package of pasta and crunched up saltine crackers to sprinkle on top before baking for some crunch.  Will def. make again!

This is ok. As is, I would not make again. I took suggestions of others, and added an extra can of soup, and half cup of milk. I used about 32 oz of dry pasta. Not sure how much cheese I used, might not have been enough. I used salt, pepper, onion, garlic and paprika and it wasn't enough flavor, app half teaspoon of each. I also added a crispy ritz cracker/shredded cheese/parmesan cheese topping. When I get seasonings right, I will like more. I tried this recipe because macaroni and cheese is my all time favorite comfort food, and I've always wanted to make a homemade version, but mostly it just isn't cost effective for my family size. This kind of bridged the gap, and was the first recipe I could use a canned item that my kids didn't refuse. Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure with tweaks we will use again - oh and btw, I do have to say my kids had a different opinion - they really did love this recipe.

This was so easy to make and tastes just as good as more difficult homemade mac and cheese recipes.  I will definitely make this again.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 2 cans of soup, some sour cream, and more milk.  I used paprika, garlic salt, and pepper to add flavor as well.  Next time I will use Sharp Cheddar cheese instead of Mild Cheddar for even more flavor.  I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top too.  It was a big hit!

I gave it 4 stars because my 19 month old loved it and my husband thought it was ok, but I didn't think it was all that great. I did like what other reviewers did and added 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup and 1/2 cup sour cream. I thought a 2qt. dish was a little small for this. If I make it again I will put in a 9x13

I thought this was just okay.  I seemed like it was missing something, despite the fact that I added an extra can of soup and some sour cream.  I probably won't make this again.  There is a better recipe on here somewhere, but I wasn't able to find it...

Not the best nor the worst I've had.... but I was looking for somthing different. If I could find the recipe from Slows BBQ here in Detriot it would be money. This was my first time making baked mac and cheese and was an easy recipe. Need more cheese and to be a little more creamy.

I just made this recipe and instead of adding all ingredients to the noodles I heated up 1 1/2 cans of soup 1 cup of milk, added extra sharp cheddar and a dash of cheyanne pepper, nutmeg and salt and pepper then poured over the noodles and baked. It is wonderful.

Yummy!  I was looking for a quick and easy macaroni and cheese recipe, and this is by far the best.  I followed other reviewers advice and used 2 cans of soup, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1/2 cup sour cream and sprinkled bread crumbs on the top.  I was out of cheddar so I used colby/jack.  My 5 year old loved it and so did I!

I made this with two cans of the cheddar soup and shell pasta - I used the shredded colby/jack mix of cheese.  Served this for our recent wedding reception - I now have earned the title of best "gourmet" mac and cheese ever with friends and family!  (If they only knew how easy this was!) This is simple, wonderful, and all will rave about it.  It is my standard recipe for baked mac and cheese now just use the extra can of cheddar cheese soup!

i also chose to modify this recipe based on other reviews. what i ended up with was amazing!!! i used 16 oz pasta, 2 cans cheese soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 8oz pepper jack, 8oz mexican stylevelveeta,and crushed parmesan goldfish crackers on top. i had to make it twice in 2 days because i didn't get any leftovers!! i also recommend using a deep casserole dish so it comes out super creamy and delicious. i will always make mine this way from now on!

Awesome!  I made a 1/2 batch.  I used 1/2 box of elbows, about 3/4 cup milk, one can of cheese soup, a heaping tablespoon of sour cream, and probably about 3/4 pound cheese.  I also mixed most of the cheese right in and then sprinkled some on top.  Fantastic and easy!  YUM!

Very good and easy recipe.  I used the sour cream and two cans of cheddar cheese soup.  I added a stick of butter to hot noodles and then mixed in all other ingredients and topped with cheese.  Sharp cheddar really made this dish and don't forget to add some salt and pepper

This was really good considering the little effort and ingredients that go into it. I used 8 oz of macaroni, half and half instead of milk and tossed half the shredded cheese into the macaroni mix and then just topped with what was left and baked. My husband said it was okay but he prefers "wet" mac n cheese whereas I prefer the "dry" baked version like cafeterias style, so I liked this very much and he did not. Flavor was fine. Super easy, not fancy, and good enough to make again. Thanks!

This was amazing! I've never tried to make baked macaronni just because every time I've ever tasted it it's always so dry and not very cheesy. But this was perfect! I read alot of the other reviews and also used 1 1/2 cups of milk, 2 cans of soup, and a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream. I also used an 8 oz. bag of colby/jack cheese and an 8 oz. bag of sharp cheddar and mixed it all together. I kept a little bit to sprinkle on the top with some breadcrumbs to make it a little crispier. Oh and one more thing, I am from South Louisiana and you know how we love our food spicy, I added quite a bit of cajun seasoning to it. Yummy!!!!! Will definitely make this again!

This is my new Mac and Cheese recipe.  Like some others, I doubled the cheese soup and I also added a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It gave it that extra kick that it needed.  No more cheese grating sessions for me!!!!!  Cheese soup rocks!!!

I made this tonight. 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup. 1 1/4 cup of milk. 1/2 cup sour cream. Sharp cheddar cheese on top and bread crumbs. I would definitely make it again. It was a good basic recipe. But it needs more WOW factor. I am going to "Dr." it up next time.

This is the 2nd year I have made this.  It is a staple with my holiday feasts.  Depending on how cheesy you want this, more cheese soup if you want it and cubed colby mixed in with it too with colby on top.  This is the yummiest delicious mac n cheese recipe hands down.  I will always make it like this for my holiday feasts and special occasions.  Think of all the variations you can do with leftovers too,,add a can of chili,,,cheesy mac, ham cubes, or cubed chicken with veggies.  If I could give this 10 stars, I would!!

This was bland for my taste.  I think I might try making it a little different next time.  I think I'll mix everything together in a mixing bowl instead of pouring everything on top of the noodles in the baking dish.  My noodles didn't get real cheesy like I prefer, and I did use 2 cans of soup.

This was so easy. I work for an organization that provides students with lunch if they can't afford it, and have to bake for 40 students every day. They loved this recipe- they were licking their plates and some called it the best mac and cheese they've ever had. It wasn't quite cheesy enough for my taste but I still really liked it. Best of all, it was easy- so much more so than melting butter and mixing flour, something I never would have attempted to do when cooking for 40 teens. I will make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I did add 8 oz. of sour cream as some one suggested and some dried shallots.  I also put grated sharp cheddar mixed in with the pasta and sauce and of course still topped it with some more cheese.  To finish it off I topped it with some bread crumbs tossed in alittle olive oil.  That gave it a nice look and a crunchy crust.

My 10 year old daughter who loves mac n cheese approved. My husband and I both thought it was on the plain side. Maybe it really does need the extra can of soup.

LOVED IT, especially with the notes for the other readers using an extra can of cheddar cheese soup.....so yummy, ate on it for days!  Gave it only 4 stars only because it really is just so much better with the extra can of cheese. :-)

I give this recipe five stars because I have never been able to make macaroni and cheese on a weeknight.  The version I make takes at least two hours.  The flavor is very good, my husband and daughter stuffed themselves silly on this recipe.  Personally, I would have liked a little stronger flavor, maybe a little salt and pepper would do the trick.  Thanks!

Needs more flavors.  Try some of the suggestions others have made to inject a kick.

I didn't even get a chance to bake it! Did 2 cans of cheese soup and 2 cups of shredded colby/cheddar blend and then tasted it to see if it needed more salt/pepper and it was good just like that! Leftover mac and cheese is also great to make a quickie tuna salad...just add tuna and mayo.

Edible, but kind of bland.  I should have known better, using a can of cheese, but I wanted to try it anyway.  I'll stick with my regular, more work intensive, but delicious recipe in the future.

I substituted Sharp Cheddar for the Colby, but the taste was pretty bland.

Following previous reviews, I doubled the cheese soup and added 1/2 the shredded cheese to the dish, and 1/2 sprinkled on top. Came out great!

Before making this, I read some of the reviews and "doctored" this recipe.  I halved the amount of pasta (we made this for lunch) and used 1 can of soup, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar and 2 TBSP or so of sour cream.  I mixed those ingredients together in a small casserole and then added my cooked multigrain macaroni.  Then I topped with a bit more cheddar and baked at 350 for between 20 and 25 minutes.  This mac and cheese was very good - better than the usual boxed stuff.  The kids and my husband all loved it!  We will defnitely make this again!

Probably one of the best baked macaroni & cheese I've ever tasted!! The only thing I changed was I used a block of cheddar and shredded it myself in place of the Colby Jack. It was delicious! Will use this recipe over and over. thanks!

Really good! Not as great as the "from scratch" macaroni and cheese that my mom used to make, but really good for a quick dinner. Has the home made feel to it. I've made it quite a few times since finding this recipe and plan to again.

Excellent and easy!  Made a double recipe for a banquet and didn't have any to bring back home! I added a small carton of sour cream, 1/4 stick butter and shredded mozarella as well as the colby.

Perfect for when you want macaroni and cheese, but don't have the energy for a roux, and you don't want to resort to a box.  
Except for the fact that my mom used cheddar instead of Colby, this is how my mom made mac n' cheese for us growing up.  It was a no-brainer for her, and devoured without complaint by us.  Glad to see how many others like it this way, too.
Simple, but really yummy!

Well, it's a step up from the last macaroni disaster I had earlier this year. I used 2 cans as directed from another reviewer and I still couldn't get the cheesy taste I was wanting. I wanted ooey, gooey, drippy cheese and got spooned hockey pucks. I added milk and the whole bit, but I still couldn't get this to come out. The only thing I liked were the buttery bread crumbs on top and that wasn't even called for in the recipe. Maybe one day my cheesy mac will come...just not in this recipe.

This is the easiest and best recipe for macaroni and cheese. I made it for our Youth Group Halloween Party and it was a big hit with the kids and their parents. I especially like how simple the recipe is. I too added an extra can of Cheddar cheese soup as others suggested and for extra flavor I added fresh finely ground pepper and paprika. I plan on making next week for our Youth Group Potluck!

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added an extra 1/2 can of soup.  I also used mild cheddar cheese instead of Colby.  Result was really delicious and creamy.  Next time I will add bread crumbs to the top for some crunch!

I love mac and cheese and although I already have 3 favorite recipes, I'm always trying out new ones.  I now have 4 favorites after making this!  I've made it twice: the first time, I made it as the recipe stated except added another can of soup, a cup of sour cream and 1 or 2 T yellow mustard.  The second time, I left out the mustard and used cottage cheese instead of sour cream.  Both times I used cheddar and mixed half of it in the casserole and half on top and baked for an hour.  It was good both ways, but especially good with the cottage cheese which made it creamier somehow, next time I'll put in the full 16 ounce container.  I really like how quick and easy this is to prepare, just have to stir the ingredients in with the cooked macaroni in the pot.  Thanks!!

I baked the recipe as is, but ended up adding 1/2 cup of sour cream, garlic powder, ground mustard, salt, and pepper.  

Next time I will double the cheddar cheese soup, add 8 oz. colby and 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese, and add cracker crumbs and butter to the top.

This receipe is very good but use a 3 qt casserole dish. Also I found it needed another can of Cheddar, added 1/2 to 1 cup additional milk, salt and pepper to taste  and I added a nice scoop of sour cream. Instead of just topping it with all the cheese I put 8 oz mixed in and the remaining 8 oz on top, ran out of shredded Colby so I went with a Mexican shredded mixture ( Monterey Jack, Mild Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla and Asadero cheeses. Came out great! Another tip, best served once done, if you keep it warm on hot plate it tends to dry out.

This recipe is great.  I now am the official mac & cheese maker whenever my family have get togethers.  I used monterey jack instead of colby and it gave it extra kick.  I also used a little salt and pepper to give it a bit more taste.

I gave this recipe 4 stars for its creaminess.  I made it with whole wheat pasta and that changed the flavor so that was my fault.  Next time will make with regular elbow noodles.  So much for trying to make mac and cheese healthy, ha, ha, ha.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great, but being the cheese-a-holic I am, I had to add more cheese.  This was so simple and a really good, hearty meal!

Second time making this for a halloween dinner, I added some black olives to it and WOWZA...it was great!! 
I added a second can of cheese soup and it was amazing.  Cant wait to have more!

This was very easy and tasty. My boyfriend and I both agree that it needed more cheese soup to make it more cheesy and less dry but it was still a good side dish.

This recipe was pretty simple, however, it was missing something. Salt, seasoning...SOMETHING. Probably won't make again.

VERY good baked macaroni and cheese.  However, I use a little bit less macaroni than what the recipe calls for because I notice that if I use the exact amount, the mac and cheese doesn't turn out as cheesy and as creamy as I like.  So, for a delicious flavorful dish use a little bit less macaroni.

This was pretty good but it could use just a little more zest. I'll make it again but will likely play around a little with the flavor.

I've done this recipe several times and it's always a massive hit. I double the soup to 2 cans and add more cheese as well. Last time I put in one can of cheddar soup and one can of broccoli cheddar soup. It was still really tasty and ever so slightly healthier for the kids.

I gave this 3 stars because I think what is missing is salt and pepper. Otherwise I would of gave it four stars personally. My family didn’t like it that much but they are also really picky.  I  think next time I make this  I will take out the sour cream and the cheese soup it calls for, which I didn’t find at store so I used cheese potato soup instead. Otherwise it was great recipe but less is more sometimes. Keep it simple

Only changes omitted onions  and added another pat of butter to mix flour. I only had medium chedder cheese. Too cheesy for my taste next time I will probably cut down on the American cheese and on chedder. Other then that very creamy and I did add panko bread crumbs. It is a very easy to make. Will definetly make again modifying for own personal taste

I usually cook for family and church gatherings, using disposable aluminum table pans.  This is a great recipe for that!  I use 24 to 32 ounces of macaroni, cooked in salted water.  I mix the grated cheese (2 1/2 cups), milk (1cup),sour cream (1 cup), and cheddar cheese soup (2 cans) in a large bowl.  I then fold in the cooked macaroni, thoroughly mixing.

This was my first time making macaroni and cheese that wasn’t out of a kraft box so I wanted a recipe that was simple, easy to make and absolutely delicious, and this recipe fit the bill! I followed some of the suggestions I read in the  reviews...used 2 cans of cheese soup, 1.5 cups milk, and 1/2 cup of sour cream...and voila it turned out perfect and was super scrumptious!! Will definitely be cooking this recipe again in the future! Only other things I would like to add is I did mix half of the Colby shredded cheese into the noodle mixture and then sprinkled the other half on top, and I had to bake mine for about 10ish close to 15 minutes longer than what the recipe suggested in order for it to brown in top. Again love love love easy, cheesy, and yummy!!!

This is my go to recipe for quick and easy comfort food. It is so easy to make and you can just alternate your favorite shredded cheeses to make it tasty and convenient to what is on hand. You can add cubed ham, broccoli, hamburger, or bacon to make it a meal. I love this  recipe!

I used one and a half boxes elbows. I added salt, paprika, pepper, onion powder(little bit), garlic powder(little bit) to the water. I also mixed two cups cheddar jack shredded cheese , one and a half cups milk, half cup sour cream, two cans cheddar soup al together before putting in dish, added some extra cheese on top. Baked for 20 minutes. Thank you to all the reviews for helping with some changes. Would make again.

OMG. Deliciousness.  Best advice is usually in the reviews. Use two cans of soup and add sour cream. Season to taste. We added a lb of crumbled bacon to the top. ??

So about half of the family liked it.  I did what everyone else said. I only have one can of cheddar cheese soup, so I added half the noodles. I added sour cream, milk, mixed in shredded cheddar cheese, a dash of garlic and onion powder, added a decent amount of salt because it’s pretty bland (I normally don’t add barely any salt to my recipes either), a decent amount of pepper then I put shredded Colby jack on top.  It honestly tastes exactly like stauffers frozen Mac n cheese lol. I didn’t have any Mac n cheese and I accidentally bought the can of cheese soup, so I figured I’d try it.  It was just an impromptu use what I had type meal. I’m a lover of Mac n cheese and I ate it, but I’m not sure I would make it again.  It will serve its purpose, but it definitely wasn’t the best tasting homemade I’ve had.

5 stars after I followed some advice from another review. *Doubled the soup.  *Used sharp cheddar cheese.  *Added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  * Changed to 1 1/2 cups milk.  *Held back some of the cheese to top the casserole later.* Cooked about 15 minutes longer.  *Then put the remaining cheese on top and sprinkled a little paprika over it.  *Cooked until bubbly.

this is the second time I've made this mac and cheese. I made it according to the recipe the second time with epic failure with no flavor. first time I made it it was absolutely outstanding because I follow the directions of one of the followers recommendations. I would highly recommend sour cream and butter and 8 teaspoon of salt otherwise it's just gross

First time finally making baked macaroni and cheese. I used what was in the recipe and added a little heavy whipping cream with it along with 2% milk, sour cream, and sharp cheddar along with the colby cheese. The  family loved it.

I've made this twice and used sharp cheddar and a little Colby.  I added 1/2 tsp. brown mustard, 1 Tbs. finely minced sweet onion, garlic salt, paprika, black pepper and topped it with Panko crumbs. This recipe is so good!  I was reluctant to use cheddar cheese canned soup but it's what gives it a creamy texture without using processed cheese like Velveeta. Loved it!

The mac and cheese turned out well and was a hit with my son.  Since I did not have any cheddar soup on hand, I substituted  1 lb of cubed Velveta, melted in the microwave with the milk and butter, for the cheddar soup.  Next time I will add onions and maybe some garlic to the recipe to spice it up a bit.

Well,  I hate to do it, but I can only award this recipe 3 stars...I wanted to love it because of it's simplicity, but  because of just that, it turned out to be way too bland. If I was any kind of cook, I would have known or at least have taken the time to read the other reviews and added a few more goodies to make it the yummy dish my mouth was watering for! I will give it another go and try some of the other  ideas. Happy Mac 'n  Cheesing!

This receipe was perfect and I  didn't change a thing.
The soup did not make this salty.  This will be a regular
staple for me.

This was an easy most delicious macaroni and cheese ever. 
Only change i made was adding  some onion, pepper and a little extra milk.  Also used cheddar cheese.  Came out creamy and delicious.  Definitely  a keeper and replaces my old recipe.  

Thanks to your mother and you for sharing it.

One of the few recipes from here that did not turn out well. No cheese taste  all only if you ate the top part did you even get the taste of cheese. Honestly box Mac and cheese dinners taste better. Followed recipes to the later it ended up in the trash . I will stick with what I have .

Really enjoy this recipe!  I've made several times! Changed up a bit adding to the cheese sauce heavy cream instead of milk and a little "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" which gives another layer of flavor!  We love it!

I used two cans of cheddar cheese soup, 1 1/2 cups of milk, 1/2 cup of sour cream, and added garlic powder, minced onion, and generous salt and pepper and it was great.  First time I made it, I followed the recipe and found it to be dry, and very bland.  Also mixed most of shredded cheese into it before baking, put a think layer on top.  Then topped with fried onions....Excellent!

That's all I can say after making this creamy mac n cheese I just substitute the sour cream and used half and half cream and dry mustard and a dash of Cheyenne pepper minced onions and it was a hit. I absolutely love my cooking with a twist next I will add some ham or bacon or broccoli....Yes

Super simple to make and tasted great!  I should have added more condensed cheddar cheese soup and milk as suggested by others, as it turned out to be a bit on the dry side.  But I will make it again!

This has become an instant family classic. I generally add browned sausage or franks to it to suit out tastes. I also like using a "fiesta nacho cheese" soup to spice it up a bit. So good!

I have struggled to find a recipe my nine year old and I both like.  She does not care for cheese but likes macaroni and cheese just not too cheesy.  The packed with three kinds of cheese or velveeta recipes were too rich.  This recipe will be our keeper.   I cut the macaroni to 8 ounces (2 cups) and used 3/4 cup cream (no milk), 1/4 cup sour cream and maybe a 1/4 cup cheddar (I ran out).  Perfect....salt and pepper too.

My kids enjoyed it as it was prepared according to the recipe. However, I started adding onion powder and white pepper for added flavor the subsequent times I made it.  I use white pepper rather than black pepper so my kids won't know it's there. Otherwise, it's pretty bland which is why I gave it 3 stars.   I usually add a mix of different cheeses... whatever I have on hand.

I have been searching for the perfect Mac n Cheese recipe for my very picky adult autistic son. He rejects any recipe that uses the white sauce base. This one was a winner! Based on other reviews, I used 2 cans of the cheese soup and 1 1/2 cups of milk, with a dollop of sour cream. My brother-in-law and his wife were here for dinner and loved it as well.

I recently made this twice. The first time I made it as is, but to me it wasn’t flavorful. Still the basic aspect was good. So I took some of the reviewer’s suggestions as well as added a few of my own and the result was phenomenal. I added ½ cup of sour cream, a second can of the cheese soup, a half cup more of milk, salt and pepper to taste and about a half cup more shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I think the flavor of the Colby isn’t strong enough for this recipe. I also made a topping out of ½ cup Italian bread crumbs, a dash of paprika and ½ cup grated parmesan cheese. Mix and sprinkle on top. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and pour over the top and put in the oven.

OH. MY. YUM! This is the best recipe I've found. I also followed other reviews to use 2 cans of cheese soup, spoonful of sour cream, and 1 1/2 cups milk, salt and pepper to taste. I also added cracker crumb to the top for crunch with sprinkle cheese. it's AMAZING!! :) KEEPER!

It is an easy recipe & very good, I used Colby/jack cheese & added a teaspoon of mustard powder. My husband really likes it & he is a picky person.

It turned out great. I used 1 1/2 c milk. I also dashed in some seasoning to the cheese mixture like pepper, paprika, onion powder, stuff like that. I mixed the cheese all together with the macaroni in a pan and then poured it in the casserole dish to bake.

I used 2 cans of soup, 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream, and a few pinches each of salt and pepper. Took this to a potluck dinner today, and all that was left over was what was stuck to the spoon. It was delicious and perfectly gooey.

Not bad, but I think I'll try using two cans of cheddar soup if I were to make it again because it didn't turn out very moist.

This gets 5 stars for ease, but it was a bit bland.  Next time I will add diced onion and garlic powder - the Colby cheese was perfect for a little zing...however you could also use pepperjack for more of a bit

This was a hit with my family! My 3-year-old loves mac and cheese, so boxed stuff gets old and boring. I was in search of different recipes, and this definitely tops my list. I followed the other reviews and used two cans of cheddar cheese soup, half cup milk, half cup sour cream, and sharp cheddar cheese. Super cheesy, I love it. I tried using cheddar cheese but it wasn't as good. Have yet to try Colby cheese.

As the base recipe is, it's quite bland and merely ok.

With major tweaks in ingredient quantity and some mix-ins, it can be excellent.  The amount of canned soup definitely needs to be doubled, but I only cook for 2-3 people so I halve the amount of cheese and pasta as it is to serve 4, in a 12x7" baking pan.  We added 1/2 cup cooked broccoli and 20 slices crumbled turkey pepperoni as mix-ins, and spiced it up with salt, pepper, and garlic & herb Mrs. Dash.  Some of the cheese is conserved to top the dish in a thin, even layer before baking so the pasta doesn't dry out in the oven.  This recipe when done well is awesome and is a part of our regular rotation.

This is a keeper! I was looking for a kid friendly recipe as my kids don't like the hugely popular here Chuck's Mac & Cheese recipe. This one was gooey, creamy and bland enough for my sons to eat a lot of it! I used 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, 1 bag of Colby Jack cheese and 1 bag of mild Cheddar cheese.

This was a good basic recipe and easy to make. I added bacon & broccoli, also added some salt and pepper it was too bland for me. Would recommend adding the salt and pepper to cheese/milk mixture so it mixes throughout.

Very easy to fix, but a little bland. I substituted sour cream and evaporated milk (1/2 cup each), and added some paprika and ground mustard as others suggested. Next time, I'll try working some additional cheese in with the soup.

Easy and tasty.  My kids ask for mac and cheese all the time and now their friends come over and ask for "your mom's famous mac and cheese."  I bake in a little cubed ham if I need the extra protein for the guests who play on my son's football team. Otherwise, it is excellent as written.

My son loves baked mac and cheese, but is very picky.  Made this last Thanksgivng and will make it again ths year.  I modified it with 2 cans of soup and used mozzarella rather than Colby cheese, also added a little salt for taste.  Fabulous and easy!

Love this recipe. I make it all the time. I actually got my job as a nanny over other girls because i made this recipe for my interview I put a lot more cheese on top and mixed in (a mix of cheddar and colby)as well as on top. two cups of soup as other reviewers suggested too. DEE-LISH! you have to try this. sometimes I ever use nacho cheese soup and ground beef and make a nacho inspired type. YUM!

I am a clean eating foodie but this recipe rescued me in a pinch and no one would ever know it wasn't made from scratch. This dish came out creamy and delicious. I also followed the advice of using 2 cans of soup and some sour cream and it was a big hit.  I used a deep casserole that I lightly greased beforehand and finished it under the broiler to lightly brown the top.  This is a great recipe when you don't have a lot of time and want to feed a lot of hungry people.  Thanks, Courtnay and mom!

Quick, simple & delicious. I couldn't find colby cheese so I just skipped it & added 8 slices of american cheese on top before it went in the oven. Now my cabinet is always stocked with Cheddar Cheese Soup which I'd never heard about til I came across this recipe!!! Thanks!

This macaroni was very simple and tasty... great for when you need a quick side or even as the main dish in your meal.

If you like cheesy macaroni and cheese then this is the recipe for you. So easy to make and requires little to make. Far better than the boxed mac-n-cheese from the grocery store. I usually make this at Thanksgiving for all the kiddos in the family...it's a hit.

Very disappointing.  Had asked for calculation for 25 - had enough for 50!  Not a dish to be made ahead as the cheese hardens & separates from the noodles.  Good taste, though, & probably would have been good straight from the oven, but I was preparing for an after-church fellowship at my house.

Perfect macaroni and cheese. This is easy to make and really flavorful. I used the 2 cans of soup, 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream with bread crumbs on top.

I had to serve 32 children at church, so I read the reviews and decided on 3 16-oz boxes of macaroni, four cans of the soup and four cans of milk. I forgot the shredded cheese, so I just didn't worry about it. It was basically a mildly cheesy white sauce and the children devoured it! It was a huge hit. I will make it for us with some dry mustard and decent shredded cheese. The mild kids' version was pretty good - I snuck a few bites and liked it, but would prefer the forgotten cheese. The kids didn't miss the cheese.

Tastes very close to velveeta mac and cheese out of the box with the already mixed cheese sauce. Ok in a pinch but not like home made.

I used 8 ounces pasta, 1 can of soup, 1 cup of milk, eyed some aged sharp cheddar & mozzerella, and topped with bread crumbs. It wasn't as good as Chuck's mac, but it was still good. I had a can of cheese to use up so this was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

So easy, and tasty.  My kids wanted to know when I'd make it again.  I did use a cheddar/jack blend instead of colby, just because it's what I had on hand.

I made this recipe for 20 people, doubling the macaroni, using 4 cans cheddar cheese soup, 3 cups milk, 2 lbs. shredded cheddar, 1 lb. Havarti, and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also used small shells instead of elbo macaroni.  People absolutely raved about it.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I loved it, and my company did too.  It's simple to make and it is tasty.  Since I am pretty lazy, I bought sliced Colby instead of shredding Colby cheese.  It turned out really well.  I layered half of the macaroni mix, and layered half of the cheese on top.  Then I finished with the remaining macaroni mix and topped with the remaining cheese.  Fantastic recipe.

Made this for 2 (and a baby) and had a lot left over. It was "ok". I thought it tasted very similar to just making noodles and putting colby jack cheese over it which is a little easier to make. I will probably make it again in a few years when I have more mouths to feed! :)

This came out a little dry but I know how to fix that next time. It was the perfect consistency going in the oven. Next time I'll just leave it in the oven long enough to melt the cheese on top. The flavor was on point though. I only used 1/2 tsp of spicy brown mustard and half a tsp of black pepper. For the season salt I used McCormick's Season All. I'm sure the next time I make it, it will be worthy of 5 stars.

I wasn't a big fan of this.  Although the texture was good, the flavor was not.  It was bland.. missing something, although I'm not sure what.  And I don't believe in rating recipes if I changed it in any way.  I think I'm just not a big fan of the flavor of the cheese soup.  Better than nothing, but I'll stick to my own recipe.

I had no idea what to make for dinner tonight but I had macaroni, a can of cheese soup and a large bag of shredded cheese that I bought at CostCo weeks ago. I ran to the computer to find an easy Mac & Cheese recipe. Ahaaaa… I also found some ham and tossed it in as well. WOW!!! This is VERY Good! I’m glad I put the ham it, I’ve never done that.:-) The kids and my husband and I gobbled this up so fast. This is going to be one of the dinners I make a lot. Thanks! And we have a little for left overs that can go in the kids hot thermos for lunch tomorrow. Happy Mom, happy family!

I am a huge fan of baked macaroni. This turned out great! I read some of the reviews before and chose to add more cheese soup. I think next time I might use cheddar cheese instead of colby. Great recipe!

My kids gobbled this up. They like things more bland than I do, and this was a huge hit. I used 2 cans of cheese soup, 1/2 cup of light sour cream, and 1 cup milk. Because of the extra soup, I reduced the amount of colby cheese, using less than 2 cups. I then sprinkled the top with the remaining cheese for a total of 2 cups.

My family LOVES LOVES LOVES this mac and cheese...I did follow other suggestions by adding 1 1/2 cups of milk and sour cream as well. I also used shard chedder cheese one pound for mixing and sprinkling on top. This recipe is awesome it's so creamy and delicious oh and I also used two cans of the soup instead of one. But for some reason it comes about when we cut into like it doesnt stay together if you know what I could do to fix that let me know thanks.....yumm o must try

3 stars for being simple and easy... But, not the best I've had.  Here's what I did, and what I'd change if I did it again. What I did: Heated 2 cans soup, 1/2 cup sour cream 1.5 cups milk, 1/2 cup cheddar, garlic salt and black pepper over stove before mixing with the noodles. Stirred cheese mixture into pasta, covered with shredded cheese (about 1c) and italian breadcrumbs. Baked.  What I'd change: Mix in all the cheese. The cheese on top is baked too long and just creates a hard layer. I'd still top it with breadcrumbs. Also, I'd add a lot more garlic salt, or salt, or some more pepper. It needs flavor. It's a good recipe in concept and I liked the consistency, but the flavor needed work. VERY easy though.

This is a good simple baked mac & cheese recipe.  I will definitely make this again, but the one change I think I'll make is to mix some of the cheese in with the elbow mac and then put the rest on the top that way there isn't an inch of cheese on top of the pasta (it was fine while it was hot, but after being refrigerated and getting it out for leftovers it was a little less pleasing - still delicious and devoured in moments, though!).  My kids and husband really liked this.  I know the recipe is a keeper if I get asked for seconds!

Excellent!! Huge hit! I added some extra cheese, and sprinkled bread crumbs and garlic powder on top for a tasty, crunchy top!  I will make this again.

Nice and easy meal.  After reading many reviews I did 2 cans of soup and about 1 1/2 cups of milk.  Also used a 3 qt dish (no way it would have all fit in a 2 qt).  Will make again.

I make this all the time, mainly to take to our church's weekly pot-luck lunches. It's the best, easiest recipe I've tried. I usually put it together the day before I bake it, and there is the risk of having the noodles dry out. But I add an extra can of soup and I never have a problem. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is pretty dang good. The only thing I changed just a tiny bit, as per other reviews, i added a few tablespoons of sour cream, and half a cup more milk. I also used sharp cheddar, and I also had American cheese cubes, I chopped those up and placed those on top. I liked it a lot. I think it needed a little more zip, next time I will put garlic in it.   Thanks for the good base recipe!

Totally a snap to make.  I added the sour cream, milk and a bit of garlic salt.  Much, much tastier than the homemade mac and cheese that my mom used to spend WAY more time making years ago.

Excellent recipe! Everyone loved it - like a few other reviewers, I added a variety of cheeses(cheddar, asiago, parmesan, velveeta) and increase the milk to 2 cups. I also used some minced garlic in the butter and used corn starch instead of flour. Fantastic! Thanks for posting!!

This recipe is a good base, but needs modifications.  On the stove top I put two cheddar cheese soup cans, 1 cup of milk, half cup sour cream, adding salt to taste and warmed it all up (this makes it easier to mix in with the pasta). I poured this mixture into the casserole dish with the pasta. Then sprinkled a generous amount of muenster and cheddar cheese on top.  I cooked this at 350 for 30 minutes covered, then broiled uncovered for 10 minutes.  Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used only 8 oz of pasta but still used one whole can of the soup but cut the other ingredients in half.  It turned out good, but not great.  I think this is a good recipe to start off from and modify to one's liking.  I added some bread crumbs on top like others had suggested.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I flavored plain bread crumbs with some oregano, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper.  It really added to the dish and I loved the slight heat from the crushed red pepper.

This recipe is so simple.  I can make a small amount for my husband and myself without all the fuss of making it from scratch.  I added a little ground nutmeg, but otherwise didn't alter the recipe at all.

I made this for a party that we had.  I wanted to make something that the kids would love, but I think the adults ate more than the kids.  It was creamy.  It was yummy.  I ate more than my diet allows.  Great recipe!

It was pretty good.  I ended up using 8 oz of colby and 8 oz of mild cheddar.  I mixed in half of the shredded cheese in with the soup mixture then the rest on top.  I sprinkled italian bread crumbs on top, let that brown and it was even kid approved.  It wasnt as creamy as other reviewers stated.  I even used 2 cans of cheddar soup.  O well it was good.

Needs more cheese soup & shredded cheese, but a good base recipe to work with.  Hubby loved it, and he usually isn't a mac & cheese fan.

I tried to expand the recipe since I had 6 to feed, using 24oz macaroni, 2 cans cheese, and additional milk.  This resulted in two large casserole dishes of macaroni and we didn't even touch the second one!  And it wasn't as creamy as I'd liked.  So I would stick to the recipe and it would serve 6 just fine.

I had never made baked macaroni and cheese. I made this recipe about 2 days ago and I thought that the taste was bland. I would recommend adding some salt and pepper to give it taste.

I made as is except used only 1/2 box macaroni and added sour cream (1/4 cup)and paprika as per other reviews. 
Topped with crushed croutons. Good and easy but nothing spectacular. I will make this again and try to get it perfect for our taste.

Good recipe.  I added some additional canned soup to the orig. amt to make it creamier and also added more of the shredded colby and mixed it in with the pasta as well as added it to the top.  Added some salt and fresh ground black pepper as well.  Everyone likes it.  Very easy and caters well.

I liked this easy mac and cheese dish, however I simply cooked the cheddar cheese soup on top of the stove with about a half of can of milk, added to cooked macaroni and added cheddar cheese to taste.  I thought it was okay without baking it.

This recipe was good. Quick and easy. I did add some sour cream, and not as much milk though. I also used sharp cheddar instead of colby. I also used some parmasan on top, and some hot sauce to give it a kick. I made this to see if it would be appropriate to take to a family picnic, totally appropriate. Next time I am going to add diffrent cheeses, and maybe some bread crumbs on top. Also, i may adsd something to make it a bit spicy. All in all good creamy macaroni!

The more I ate the better this tasted.  It is great for kids because it is doesn't have a kick to it.  My 20 month old couldn't get in his mouth fast enough.

Great recipe, very simple but it comes out creamy and very cheesy!  I added a little seasoning and it was fantastic.

Very good recipe! Instead of putting all of the cheddar cheese on the top I mixed about a cup of it in and put the rest on top.  It was very creamy and tasted great! Easy to reheat by just adding a little milk to it!

My brother was coming to dinner and I needed a mac and cheese dish to please him and I didn't have a Kraft dinner in the pantry and I didn't have all the ingredients for my regular homemade mac and cheese so I came to allrecipes.com and found this simple one. Luckily, I had all ingredients on hand and it was good but not outstanding. It satisfied the mac and cheese craving my brother had but I doubt I'll make it again. I did think the cheese soup idea was clever.

This was my first time making mac n cheese. I don't really care for mac n cheese but my family enjoyed it a lot.
