Yummy soup. Love the fire roasted tomatoes. I only used part of the evaporated milk... the rest I used some chicken stock. Forgot to top with parm, but I will with leftovers.

This recipe is not good. I doubled the batch because it sounded good but the milk ended up breaking apart. The ground cloves was WAY too strong and I added a ton of basil and other flavors to give it something. I threw out everything I spent over an hour on and the recipe itself. I will never make this again.

Good in theory but I would have changed a lot of this if I made it again.  The cloves overpower everything so skip them if your not a fan.
