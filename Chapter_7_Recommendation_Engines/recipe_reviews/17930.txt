This was simple and an easy recipe for work day evenings.  I agree with another reviewer that the quailiy depends on the sauce you use.  I did adjust the recipe and added canned tomatoes and tomato past to the sauce.

This is a great recipe for a quick family dinner.  I think the results depend a great deal on the quality of the spagetti sauce that is used.  Unfortunately I used a brand that was on sale instead of my usual more expensive one.  I will know better next time!

Wonderful!  I was searching for "something different to do with chicken" and selected this recipe.  So easy and very tasty.  I added garlic to the veggie saute and seasoned the chicken (Emeril's Essence) because I just do things like that!  This is a great way to create a delicious meal and not heat up the kitchen!

Excellent dish! A few tweaks to mine though. I used lemon-pepper chicken because it had already been out on the counter to thaw for a half hr, the occasional hint of lemon was refreshing! Instead of mixing the sauce with the pasta then adding the chicken mixture, I added the sauce and tomatoes right to the chicken mix and let it simmer while the noodles were cooking.

I also used a full jar of spaghetti sauce (essentially doubling what's listed) and added: 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 tsp of oregano and about 1 of fresh frozen basil (we chop the leaves then freeze them in an ice cube tray) so for this dish I used one cube.

So simple with one more cheat!  One whole jar of spaghetti sauce with veggies already in it, added Tyson frozen pre-cooked chicken strips; let simmer.  Meanwhile I cooked the Angel hair pasta, put in a casserole dish and added butter.  When chicken and sauce was heated through I added parmesan and mozzarella cheese  to the top.  Let melt then poured over the buttered Angel hair. :)

This was good. I opted to pour a can of Hunts Spaghetti Sauce over the cooked chicken and vegtabels. Stirred and simmered to heat then spooned  over the pasta noodles.
If you are out of spaghetti sauce then pour a big jar of salsa over the cooked chicken and veges.  Sub rice for noodles ;-)

This dish was amazing. I marinated the chicken with garlic powder, pepper and salt.

I love spaghetti and I love chicken so this seemed like a great recipe to try. And I might have to use angel hair pasta from now on whenever I make spaghetti because it makes it taste so much lighter to me.  And this is a healthier alternative to beef so win win.

Haven't made this one yet but you could try adding a can of chicken stock/broth and a can of italian tomato paste...so the sauce isn't too watery...it has such a wonderful taste!
