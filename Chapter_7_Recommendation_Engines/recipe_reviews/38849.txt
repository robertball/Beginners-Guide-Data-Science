This recipe is alright, its gives a start to making the sauce and I found it useful. Do not use "Miracle Whip" use best foods and I used more paprika twice as much as stated and like wise with the other ingrediants to my liking especially the butter. Do not use too much vinegar ! Please let me know if this helps.

It is clear that there are several varieties of shrimp sauce. I found this recipe to be a great salad or cold shrimp dressing.  For those looking for a more mellow shrimp sauce - here it is.
4 cups of mayonaise
16 oz. can peaches in heavy syrup
2 tbls. honey
1 tbls. paprika
1 tbls. soy sauce

Put in blender and mix well.

I've made this sauce a few times actually. I went to Poland to study for 6 months and I was missing japanese food with the shrimp seafood sauce. Found this recipe and was so excited! This recipe is not bad, not exactly restaurant-style, but almost close. The portions are not right or something is missing. I can't figure it out yet. Me and my roomate agreed that it was a bit tangy (she wouldn't have it) but my husband absolutly loves this sauce and begs me to make it occasionally. I think if you add a little less rice vinegar (like 2 tblspns) and use sweet paprika it tastes better. Just adjust the portions and it will come out the way you want it.

I thought this recipe was great. It was a little different from the sauce I was thinking about, but it was just as good. The key is to let it stand for about 10 minutes before serving.

The sauce was a bit too sweet and tangy for what we get in the Japanese restaurants in my area, even when we halved the sugar and rice vinegar.  It would make a nice salad dressing, but otherwise it wasn't what we were looking for.

I am so glad someone posted this Recipe. Lime thank you so much!!! I moved to a new area about 6 years ago because I thought the resaurant I once frequented back home was Chinese and they served this delicous shrimp sauce.  Well when I moved I figured the Chinese resaurants would serve the same.  Every one I went in I asked for it and they just looked really confused brought the red sauce you sometimes dip shrimp in.  Well, I thought I'd make my own if I could find the recipe.  Typed in the search engine on the computer and there it was.  Easy as pie.  Anyway I dont mean to be long winded but I really appreciate you posting the recipe.

This is REALLY close to the shrimp sauce I am used to.  It is just a tad too tangy.  It may help to decrease the amount of rice vinegar, or is there one ingredient missing?

This is truly excellent and tastes just like the sauce at our favorite Japanese restaurant.  I used the fat free mayo and it still tastes just as great!  Thanks!

This turned out pretty good but was a little too sweet in my opinion. I will cut the sugar back to 1 tablespoon next time or either leave it out entirely.

This recipe is kinda/sorta pretty close, but here's a key suggestion:  don't add sugar; instead, use MIRIN.  yummmmmmmm! :)

VERY IMPORTANT- You MUST let this sit for at least 4-5 hours, at first when I tasted it I was thinking about throwing it away as it was awful… but thought I would see if my guest would like it, so left it in the fridge for about 8 hours…. When it came back out, it had a very different flavor and ended up being the hit of the party… Yes you may need to adjust the amount of the ingredients, sugar/vinegar to suit your tastes but let it sit before you decide…. Oh and one other thing you may decide to add a small dash of cayenne pepper to add to the flavor and give it a very subtle kick…

Rich and creamy - not bad.  Great consistency in part, I'm sure, because of the butter.  However, it was a little flat on taste and still a bit sweet even after reducing the amount of sugar (I used Splenda) by half.  It was serviceable, but not tasty enough for me, anyway, to make it worth the calories.  Would have probably loved this if it just had a little more flavor.

Very good shrimp sauce. I halved the amount since I was only serving two people using best food mayonnaise. I cut back a bit on the amount of sugar using splenda and I found it was still slightly sweet but with a little "tang" from the vinegar. Next time I will just use 2 tsp. of Splenda instead of 3T of sugar. The color of the sauce is a slight pinkishorangish hue just as submitter states. I just mixed all the ingredients together and put in the refrigerator to chill until ready to serve. I used this recipe as a dipping sauce for ,"Japanese Deep Fried Shrimp," and served it aong with "Japanese Style Sesame Green Beans,""Cucumber Sunomono," and "Miso Soup," all from this website.

Thank you for sharing your recipe!  We go to a local Japanese Steak house that serves this (called Yum Yum sauce) and we have become addicted to it :o)!  We were glad to find the recipe!  Very Good!

What its missing is ginger...but this is to taste, so I don't know how much.  I cut a chunk about 1/2 inch by 1 inch, about 1/2 inch thick, and squeezed it through a garlic press over the bowl...use the juice and the grated ginger that is expressed.  Almost perfect...still a little too tangy in my opinion, but a few tbs of pureed peaches helps that.

I was looking for the orange sauce served at some Japanese hibachi restaurants I've been to. This is not it. It's still quite good though. I substituted apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar and added about 1/2 cup water to reduce the thickness of the sauce.

Everyone in our family loves this shrimp sauce. I don't know if it how the Japanese restaurants make it, but it tastes spot on. I've seen some others comment on not using Miracle Whip, but quite honestly, we think it is better than regular mayonnaise.

Good start. In my opinion, the "missing" ingredient is a tablespoon of tomato paste. Hence the pinkish orange color (why do they call something orangey-pink "white sauce" anyway?)

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made this. The vinegar taste was WAY too strong. I was pretty dissapointeed because it did not taste nearly as good as the sauce at our favorite Japanese restuarant. The next time we ate there we asked them what was in their sauce, and they would not tell us. However they did say yes when we asked if they used ketchup in the sauce. So that is atleast one thing missing. It was still a good sauce after sitting in the fridge for a while, maybe a good salad dressing... it just was not what I was hoping for.

This is it!! Been looking for this forever! The only change is to use fresh garlic. It's a must. Just like the sauce at Bennihannas.

This was far too sweet and not what I was looking for at all.  It didn't have that richness that I get from the sauces at Japanese restaurants.  I do agree that it might make a nice salad dressing though.

I have made this recipe several times since finding it on this site, and my family loves it. We eat it with chicken, shrimp, rice, and fish. It is a great dipping sauce or for use on top of fried rice.

This comes darn close to the stuff at the restaurants. The only thing I add is 1 tsp of tomato paste. Then it's perfect! And you HAVE to let it sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavors develop.

Sooo excited to find this recipe.  We moved to the northeast and the Japanese Steak Houses here don't have this sauce.  I made it tonight and brought it with us.  Sooo good.  I will decrease the amount of vinegar next time, but otherwise perfect!

I agree with most reviews, too much vinegar.  But it's darn close to be perfect, just a little tweaking and you can find what suits your flavor.  Also, adding honey helps sweeten the flavor of the sauce, very good.

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT! I ADDED 1 TEASPOON OF KETCHUP AND 1 TEASPOON OF PEACH JUICE. AND LET IT SIT, COVERED IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR A FEW HOURS. IF U EAT IMMEIDATELY, YOU WILL ONLY TASTE MAYO.

*I HAD IT ON A SALAD. THEN ON CHICKEN TERRIYAKI WITH FRIED WHITE RICE, ZUCCHINI AND ONIONS. ITS WAS SOO GOOD. MY FAMILY LOVED IT!

i spent 4 years in nc eating the sauce i'm looking for on my fried rice, but now i'm living in ks and i can't find it anywhere. this is not at ALL what i thought it would be. i'm not a fan -i hope you find it to be what you're looking for. it was the right color, but it didn't taste right.

My family loves this sauce at our favorite Japanese restaurant and this is just as good.  It was gone before the rice was!  Will make this one often.

I love this stuff!!  I prefer to use Nakano seasoned rice vinegar and used 3 tablespoons of butter. I'm close to matching my local version.

I have never had the Japanese sauce before. I have only had the red shrimp cocktail sauce. This is very good and I do like it. I use the lobster flaky pieces and make a salad and used this for dressing and it was very good!

Excellent sauce!  The rice vinegar really adds the kick.  I would use less sugar, and add a pinch of cayenne for a little heat, to send this sauce to the front of the pack.  Excellent with fried rice and a California roll!

I thought it was a good foundation for japanese shrimp sauce. I tweaked the amounts and added a few extras (honey, cayenne, fresh garlic instead of powder, salt and fresh ginger). It turned out great.

I wanted to make "white sauce" and found this recipe.  It's not quite the same as the restaurant kind, a bit too tangy.  But it's still pretty good.

I make this sauce quite often with fried rice and steak. It is very very similar to a sauce found at our favorite local japanese steakhouse. The first time I made it the vinegar taste was way too strong. I have since made it with 2 tbls of vinegar instead of 3 and it is much better!

I was excited when I was this recipe, my husband and I love japanese steak houses and their shrimp sauce.  This is NOT it.  This was way to tangy and the vinegar taste was to strong.  Guess I'll keep looking.

One day while eating at our local Japanese restaurant I teased our chef and asked for the ingredients to their shrimp sauce.  Surprisingly he gave me a few of the ingredients, the same as this recipe, except he said to soak a few slices of a fruit (apple or orange) in it for a while.  He did not say for how long, probably a couple of hours.  He did say to not let it ferment.  For those of you who thought something was missing from this recipe, maybe this is it.

This recipe is good. I made the following adjustments and found it better. First use real mayonaisse. Not Mircle Whip. Second eliminate the sugar AND the rice vinegar and use sushi vinegar. It is already sweetened. Third I added about a teaspoon of ketchup. Fourth, definitely let it set over night. The flavor changes immensly after setting. I found this to be very close to what I have had in steakhouse resturants.

It was a little tangy for me.  They are too much of the ingredients.  If you change all the tablespoons to teaspoons but keep the mayonnaise the same (1 cup) it's much much better and tast just like the restraunts!

So easy, so good and really does taste like something you'd get at Benihana. Make sure you let it chill for an hour or 2 for the flavors to blend. I served this with beef and shrimp fondue and bet it would even be good with chicken. Loved it.

I tried this last night and so far the only thing that was the same as Benihana's, was the color. I think I made a mistake and used "Miracle Whip" as opposed to regular mayo. Otherwise, it was very close.

This recipe is somewhat like Japanese Shrimp Sauce, but too sweet and really tangy -- I tweaked it, and made adjustments as follows:
2 cup Mayo
3 tbs white sugar
2 tbs rice vinegar
4 tbs melted butter
2 tsp paprika
1 tsp garlic powder
** melt butter first in mixing bowl - when melted
   add paprika, then sugar, rice vinegar, garlic powder, 
   then ,mayo - mix well -- enjoy :) --- KB

Good with some tweaking.  Took others advice and only used 2 tablespoons sugar.  Still very sweet!!  I would cut back a little on mayo next time.  Added a little ketchup and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  Will definitely make again using this as a base and going from there.  Thank you!!

I thought this tasted like vinegar with mayo. You only need 1tbsp of rice wine vinegar, 1tbsp + 1tsp of sugar, and up the paprika to 1tsp. When changed, at least for me, it tasted very close to what I am used to. But there are so many different local versions of this. I used light mayo and light butter spread and it still tastes great.

This version on shrimp sauce is ok but it is not like the shrimp sauce in restaurants. First off, it is much thicker than what is served at a hibachi grill. The version served at hibachi grills is pourable, this is not. Secondly, this shrimp sauce has an extreme mayonaise taste to it, to be honest the ingredients calls for too much mayonaise. Thats why alot of the reviews say it is too sweet..its the mayonaise. Other reviews say to half the vinegar portion BUT DO NOT DO THAT! If you half the vinegar portion than you get sweet red thick mayonaise, at least the vinegar takes away from the extreme sweetness. This one is not that great at all... I had to add a bunch of ginger and pepper to make it tolerable.

This is not the japanese shrimp sauce. I made it as the recipe said and left it overnight. The next day brought it to room temperature. This sauce is too sweet and tangy. Not at all at the Japanese resturants I frequented. I am still searching.

Don't most people know that mayonaise and miracle whip are not the same thing? Just wanted to add that as someone mentioned to not use miracle whip but use best foods....they are not interchangeable at all, unless you like it more sweet and tart by using miracle whip.

This is pretty good.  Like most of the other reviewers, I found it to be too sweet and too vinegary.  I cut both back by a tablespoon and found the results to be much better.

I think this recipe is missing the ketchup that the other shrimp sauce recipe has. However, I did use the suggestion to substitute reduced calorie ingredients. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked this recipe!  I didn't have rice vinegar but used apple cider vinegar instead.  I only used a teaspoon of it though.  I added a touch more paprika, probably around a teaspoon.  After I made it I tasted it and although it was good, it didn't quite taste like the sauce I had tasted in restaurants.  So, I added a dash of soy sauce and about a good teaspoon of ketchup.  It tasted very close to what I have had in our local Japanese restaurants.

Tried this and made only two modifications: honey in place or sugar and added some ginger. Let it set for a few hours and then had it with shrimp. Delicious! Gave it four stars because I think it was a really good base but needed some tweaking.

This is a good start but it is missing some things. Halve the white sugar to reduce sweetness. Add 1/2 to 1 tsp of the following: ground ginger, white pepper, ground mustard. Also add slightly less than 1/4 cup of water for consistency. Whisk together and refrigerate for at least 1 hr before serving

I think for the amount of time it takes to make this recipe (very little) and the complexity of the ingredients (not very), it's an excellent recipe.  Using regular white vinegar works as well. Simple and delicious!

The sauce was great, but like others, I've made some edits to make it more like the shrimp sauce I'm used to. First, full-fat mayo. The light version gave it a very distinct mayonnaise taste that I did not care for. Sorry, dieters. Then I doubled up on the paprika, and added crushed garlic in addition to the garlic powder. Lastly, and this is a little random, but a spoonful of ginger salad dressing made it a perfect match to what they serve at Benihanas down here in Miami.

I agree that this is a great base to the sauce. If you make the recipe as written you are likely to be disappointed. However if you play around with it a bit it can turn out pretty close to what's served at hibachi restaurants. I would use the mayo and vinegar amounts but you will want to at least double everything else. After doublingnimstarted adding a shake more of this and a dash more of that. In the end I am really pleased with final product.

I tweaked a thing or two, but it turned out great with my sushi.

This was a pretty good base recipe.  As always I made the recipe exactly as specified.  The only thing I didn't like is that the rice vinegar taste was a bit too much.  I also wasn't sure if white sugar was the same as regular sugar.  I'll read some of the other reviews and see what I can add.  Made this for SuperBowl 44 and everyone else seemed to really like it.

I've made this twice already during the Christmas season and everyone loves it, especially my husband who is my biggest critic. Excellent.  The only thing I did different was add some chili sauce to give it a little kick.

I thought this tasted great. I am not familiar with what this tastes like in a Japanese steakhouse so I had no preconceived notions.  I will be making this again for sure.

I made this sauce for a dinner party I was having.  My guests loved it.  But, I thought it was a little tangy. I added some powdered ginger and it turned out great.  We ate the whole bowl.The teenage girl was taking her chicken and scraping the last little bit out of the bowl.   Next time, I've just got to make more!!!

I had been asking the restaurant for this recipe for a long time and they would not give it to me.  We moved about seven hours away from there now and can't go eat there.  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe.

I thought this was REALLY good! I got online looking for a recipe because I forgot to buy cocktail sauce and I might like this even better.
