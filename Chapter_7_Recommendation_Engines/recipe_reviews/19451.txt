Super recipe!!  Receieved many compliments :) Be sure to WARM the hot fudge before you pour in on the ice cream, otherwise it will be too chunky.  Also, I would probably skip the chocolate shell topping next time, the fudge is enough.

A straightforward recipe that's easy to adjust to your liking.  The birthday request was for cookies & cream, so I made the crust from chocolate graham crackers, skipped the peanut butter, and used walnuts instead of cashews.  I used "Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce" with double the cocoa and topped it with a homemade chocolate shell (2/3c choc chips, 2T coconut oil, melted and mixed), studded with vanilla/chocolate Oreos.  Be sure to use a deep dish pie plate!  What's not to like?

This was very good when I made it for my sister's birthday.  It was a hit! I will certainly make it again!

This was so good and so easy.  You can't make it on the spur of the moment because you have to freeze it before serving, but everything else is really easy and the results are just so yummy! I took it to a family gathering, and it just disappeared.  You must try this.

Wow - this is incredible! I made this non-dairy by making my own non-dairy peanut butter ice cream (simply adding the amount of pb recommended to my regular vanilla ice cream recipe) and using oil instead of butter in the crust. I used "Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce" from this site. A really rich, decadent dessert.
