Unbelievably easy and yummy.  Makes a large batch.  I added more vodka and brandy than what is called for and skipped the cherries.  Perfect!

It has a great sweet flavor. It was a nice change from a margarita or daiquiri. They are not that strong. Maybe I didn't put enough scoops in glasses.  Will make again for another party.  Thanks!

Everything was super easy...except I couldn't find grapefruit soda. No one had ever heard of it. But other than that, we loved it!! We're going to add strawberries next time!

I made these slushies for my girlfriends on a warm weekend night.  We enjoyed them immensely!  Lots of gossip and laughs and we all agreed that these were great summer drinks to enjoy.

This drink was a HUGE hit at a small dinner with friends.  I made one small change, I pureed one 10-oz jar of cherries.  This kept the sweetness under control and added a great color.  I also needed more than one bottle of lemon lime soda.  Don't substitute, ginger ale doesn't work.

Very, very sweet, but good taste.  Was looking for a drink with brandy for Super Bowl.  I think next time I would skip the cherries, and use club soda instead of lemon-lime soda.  Love the slushiness.

Very good. I tried it with Strawberry pop, and it was deliciouse but i think any kind of fruity pop would be good with it, maybe i'll pick up black cherry or grape next time.

This was far too sweet for my taste even though I halved the amount of cherries in it. If I make it again, I'll omit the cherries entirely and try to give it a more citrus taste.

This was pretty tasty - served at party and was asked for recipe. I wasn't sure what to do with the cherries - drain - throw in there whole?! What I did was pour most but not all of the juice out and threw the cherries in my food processor and pulverized and then added to the mix. It turned a pretty pink color and gave it a little cherry flavor. I didn't use 2 jars of cherries, and am SO GLAD that I didn't. It would have been WAY too sweet as it was really sweet with just one jar. For the grapefruit soda, I used Fresca. I also increased the vodka and brandy to 1 cup each. ;-) I would make again.

Mine is still freezing, but did anyone try this with diet soda instead of regular.  I did and I am hoping that it freezes okay with out the sugar.  Also were the cherries supposed to be drained I didn't and the color of my mix was an icky brown so I added red food coloring.
