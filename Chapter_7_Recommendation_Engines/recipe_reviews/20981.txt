Very easy to make, but I was disappointed with the taste.  I used low fat sour cream and found the veggie mix taste to be overpowering.

This dip reminded me of an old college party standby (Knorr's dry vegetable soup mix + sour cream).  However, the addition of water chestnuts was an interesting twist.  After mixing the dip and serving it though, I had quite a bit left over as it didn't seem very popular.  Since it didn't receive one compliment or comment from any guests, I'm not sure that I'd make it again.

I just made this for the first time, and my husband polished it off before we could serve it to our guests.  A great recipe we will make again.

Excellent recipe, very easy to make and was delicious.  It almost tasted like a seafood dip to me, made me think to add a can of shrimp or crab next time (and there will be many next times!).  Thanks Rachel for the great dip recipe!

Delicious!  I cut the sliced water chestnuts in half and used Mrs. Grass Homestyle Vegetable dry soup mix.

I made this dip for a picnic, and within minutes it was gone.  All my friends have asked for this recipe because it was so easy to make and had a wonderful taste.

This is a great dip.  However, I preferred it a little creamier, so I used only half the water chestnuts called for.

I originally made this as a "back-up" to some other appetizers I was making and it quickly became one of my favorites.  I use an overflowing 1/2 tsp. of Tabasco and serve it with Sociable crackers rather than butter flavored crackers (seems like a better match to me).  The texture is great, it's got a lot of "zip" and I got a lot of compliments on it.
UPDATE:  This dip started out as a back up, but is number one on my list and at friends houses (to whom I gave the recipe to).  Always a favorite and always gone by the end of the night.  I can't say enough about this dip.  It is excellent.

I made this recipe yesterday.  It was really easy to make and very quick.  I thought I would try this recipe because I love water chestnuts and thought this may be good.  Overall, this was a pretty good dip.  I halved the recipe, but put double the hot sauce and used dry onion soup mix.  The flavor was good but I would have liked the dip to be a little thicker.  I have only tried it on crackers but I think it would be good in a wrap, maybe even with some deli meat.

This is very good, tasty, fresh flavors. I liked it better as a finger sandwich with watercress or as a spread on crostini however.

It's a little runny when first made, but thickens well when chilled. Crab meat or shrimp might add nicely to the texture, but the soup flavor is quite strong and would possibly overwhelm those mild flavors

A great recipe. I really like the addition of hot sauce. Make this a day ahead of time so the flavors can come together.
