Flavoring came out perfect!  Mine was about 5.5. pounds.  I took it out when it reached 125 degrees and and let it rest until it got to about 133.  As I wanted mine medium rare (no more than 135 degrees), I stuck it in broiler for a few minutes to brown the  top and then let it rest for about another 15-20 minutes before slicing.
