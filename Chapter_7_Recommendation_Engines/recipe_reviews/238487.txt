So yummy! Pomegranates were not available when I made this so I just left them out and it was still incredible. Definitely a recipe for an avocado lover

Made this last night for dinner! It was great! The only change I made was substituting broth for water when cooking the quinoa for more flavor and I added some salt.  Remember to rinse the quinoa a few times to get rid of the bitter taste.

I brought this room temp salad to a baseball tailgate tonight. My friends and my husband LOVED this salad and finished every bite... passing the bowl back and forth until it was gone. They raved about it. This recipe is a winner. I switched things up a little. Instead of using just quinoa, I had on hand 'Sun Harvest Organic Super Grains'...a blend of white quinoa, red quinoa, millet and buck wheat and also added salt and pepper. This recipe calls for no seasoning so I felt it needed some a little salt and pepper to taste. I also used 2 avocados because why would you use 1 1/2 avocados?  I also added more pomegranate seeds because why would you use 1/2 a pom? Since I have a pom bush, I think I actually used about 2 poms ( I keep pom seeds in my fridge during this season so I'm not sure how much I added.

My first review ever as I had to say how good this salad is!  Made it just as written, no need to change a thing!

Easy to make - I had a pomegranate and an avocado, but didnâ€™t even think of pairing them. Thanks for the idea!!!

This is pretty tasty.  "To taste" meant a lot more pomegranate in my life.  I had to add salt, too.

With the changes I've made, I will definitely make this salad again. The only addition necessary in order to get rid of any blandness was kosher salt. I added oil and kosher salt to the taste and this salad was fresh and tasty. Pomegranate seeds and avocado are a pretty and tasty combo!

So delicate, yet bursting with flavor. The pomegranate is a wonderful addition and goes so well with avocado. This went very nicely with poached salmon and a glass of white wine. Simply beautiful. Thank you for the recipe.

Love.  My go-to for potlucks.  So healthy, so quick, so delicious.  I don't measure the avo, pom or cilantro - just add 'til it looks just right (meaning - lots of avo and cilantro).

This was delish. I added salt to the quinoa while cooking and reduced the amount of oil - a tablespoon seemed like a lot. Divided it into thirds for work lunches, and mixed in fresh baby kale for extra bulk and vitamins. It really worked with the greens. Healthy goodness!
