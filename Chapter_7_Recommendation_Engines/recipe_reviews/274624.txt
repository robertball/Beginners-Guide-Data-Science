8.7.19  I liked the combination of blackberries and cherries, a different and tasty new salsa flavor for me.  Also, I think this would be particularly good on grilled fish or chicken.  My blackberries were so huge that they kept falling off of the tortilla chips, so I really should have cut them in half.  Also, the one thing that I will do next time is rehydrate the dried cherries.  I wasnâ€™t crazy about the dried versus fresh texture of the two fruits, but admittedly, this could be nothing more than personal taste. Good eye appeal, and I would make this again.   Slowturtle thanks for sharing your recipe
