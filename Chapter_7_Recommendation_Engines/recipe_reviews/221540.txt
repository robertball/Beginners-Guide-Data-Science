I have made several versions of Chicken Marsala but this is the best by far!  My hubby prefers a slightly sweeter version and this was perfect.  I made it for dinner this evening with my 2 adult children and their spouses who all raved about this recipe.  A keeper for sure.  The only change I made was to coat the chicken with flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper before placing in the pan to have a slight coating.

Didn't have any idea what to do with the chicken tonight so I searched on Allrecipes and decided to make this dish. I didn't have molasses, so sub with brown sugar. My husband and I loved it. Thanks.

I made this recipe last night for 7 of us.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception that I eliminated the Karo syrup and I added 1/2 cup extra of marsala wine.  I wanted a little more sauce for the rice I was serving along with the chicken, thus the extra wine.  Next time I may increase the sauce a little more, but the flavor of this recipe was great.  A little time consuming but well worth it.

When I first read it I knew it was gonna be too sweet. I cut down on brown sugar and omitted the  corn syrup. Still super sweet. I used the juice of a whole lemon to tame it. Also why is there no basic seasoning on the chicken??  Salt & pepper before tossing in the pan to cook. Not sure I'll make this again.

I didn't use the corn syrup and I am glad I didn't, the Marsala was real sweet with out it. I used one pan and started with cooking the chicken first. This is not a bad recipe but I won't be using it again.
