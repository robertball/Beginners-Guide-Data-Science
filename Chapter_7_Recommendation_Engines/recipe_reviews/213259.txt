I *cannot* believe that no one else has tried this recipe!!  It is SO EASY and SO GOOD, it was one of the first things to go at my dinner party.  Will make this again.

This deserves at least 6 stars!  I used leftover Beer Butt Chicken instead of canned.  Also prepared some basic chicken gravy, thinking that it might be dry... not so.  It was moist yet with a crisp crust.  No gravy necessary!  This needs to be tried!

This is one of my favorite Pampered Chef recipes --- guests ALWAYS ask for the recipe whenever I serve this at brunch or potluck meetings.

Some tips: I cook 1 lb. diced chicken breast with the 1/2 tsp salt (not too salty that way); squeeze the spinach with your hands over the sink to get all the water out; buy your crescent rolls from Trader Joe's (no bad-for-you chemicals or preservatives and a much better price!). A friend of mine likes to add some sweet corn to the mixture and then serve the rolls with Thousand Island Dressing as a sort-of dipping sauce. (I haven't tried it that way, but she raves about it, so I thought I'd share.)

I love this recipe...especially for its flexibility.  I've made it as is, but since then I've started omitting the lemon zest and nutmeg and adding some chopped onion and minced garlic instead.  This is a delicious way to get some spinach into my hubby and kiddos.

Very Good! I've made the similar Pampered Chef recipe before but prefer this as it uses spinach instead of broccoli, and no can of soup! I agree with the other reviewer that says this does NOT need the added salt, I will leave that out next time.

VERY easy, and so tasty! I used frozen chicken that I cooked and shreaded instead of canned.  I will make this again!

Made this for the first time last night, though I did make some changes as per other suggestions.

Did NOT use canned chicken (yuck).  Used chicken breasts I boiled for about 10 minutes until they were no longer pink, and then shredded them with a fork.

Because I had so much chicken, I ended up using a little more mayo and added some cream cheese.  I also added chopped onions (sauteed them in a bit of garlic oil with the red pepper since others had posted that they didn't cook entirely when added to the mixture raw).

I used closer to 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese because I had so much chicken, and I just really like cheese.  I also saved some and sprinkled it over the top of the pastry.  I think it looked pretty that way :)

I didn't have lemon zest or nutmeg on hand, so I just skipped them, and I totally forgot to add the salt.  I didn't miss any of them.

This recipe was so much easier than I thought it was going to be.  I can see myself experimenting with all kinds of stuff inside the pastry ring in the future!

The whole family loved this! I used philly cooking creme (garlic flavor) instead of mayo. I also put the cheddar cheese ontop of the ring and baked...it tuned brown a bubbly! Very good!!!!

This was a really good base recipe - Not a fan of frozen spinach but still enjoyed this very much.  Next time I think I will spice things up a bit with some chili powder on the chicken when cooking (refuse to use canned chicken - sorry) and some red pepper flakes to the mixture.  I wish mine came out as pretty as the picture though (I halved the recipe as there is only two of us and had enough left over for one lunch the next day.)

First of all, this turned out beautifully. It's a dish I'd happily serve for brunch *except* it was insanely salty. I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was almost inedible. I might try it again with leftover chicken instead of canned, swiss cheese, light sour cream rather than mayo and NO extra salt -- and maybe cut down on the cheese and add extra veggies instead. The texture and appearance were fine, but the salt! Oy!

It was ok but the lemon zest was just overpowering. I think it would have been much better without it and maybe add some onion and garlic instead.

My family and I loved this one...with a couple of important tweaks. As others have mentioned, this recipe does not need the extra salt. So, just eliminate that. I don't have a zester, so instead, I sprinkled a little McCormick Lemon Herb...And for the spinach, I preferred to use fresh baby spinach. So, not knowing how much was equivalent to 10 ounces frozen, I grabbed exactly 2 medium compacted handfuls and chopped that up. It worked!

I use the lower fat crescent rolls, so it is less greasy.  I also add grated carrots for color and a little texture.  This is from a pampered chef cook book and it works best on a stone.

I had this recipe from a Pillsbury cookbook years ago. It has a mild citrus taste from the lemon zest and it’s a real crowd pleaser. Easy serving slice between the rolls. Simple to make. I’m so glad I was able to relocate it on ALL RECIPES yay!

This was a big hit with my picky husband! He said he would have eaten the whole ring. The only thing I did differently is to use chopped onion/shallot instead of bell pepper and add allspice. This is a good chance to use up some of your allspice - it didn't hurt when I added it in addition to the nutmeg.
I would consider trying this with cream cheese, sour cream, or yogurt instead of mayo. I loved it too!

Delicious! I'm sure it would stand alone (as is) very well, but I did add some chopped artichoke hearts and a dab of sour cream to the filling. I didn't use canned chicken... I always boil my own boneless, skinless chicken breast and shred it before mixing. I also brushed the top with melted butter and dusted it with ground Parmesan before baking. Yes, I will definitely make it again. It's company worthy!

This is easy, delicious, and beautiful. Canned chicken? Never. Rotisserie chicken or make your own for best flavor. This was my favorite "Pampered Chef" recipe. Thanks for having it here for all to enjoy.

I followed the recipe as written, but I found the lemon zest to be overwhelming.  If I were to make this again, I would substitute either onion or garlic and leave out the nutmeg and I would double the chicken.  Or, as some have suggested, not use canned chicken.

This was really easy and delicious! My 14 year old daughter usually would never eat spinach and peppers, but she had 2 helpings! I did not use the nutmeg, and added a little extra cheese and salt. I posted it on facebook and have had several requests already for the recipe.  Thanks!

Not exactly a fair review, b/c I made a pie crust due to the lack of crescent rolls.  Otherwise, I followed the exact recipe.  Having said that, the filling was lackluster.  The pie crust was good!  Will not make again.

This is really easy and a very pretty dish that looks complicated. We thought it was delicious! I left out the lemon zest and instead used a sprinkle of lemon pepper. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. Good for a light summer dinner with some fresh steamed green beans and sliced cucumbers!
