We have made breakfast burritos for years at our house. In addition to scrambled eggs, I would recommend using queso fresco (a mexican white cheese) which crumbles well instead of cottage cheese, salsa instead of ketchup, and add sliced avocado or guacamole. Can also add chopped tomato and use whole wheat tortillas for added nutrition. Makes a good quick meal anytime.

I was looking for a recipe that used eggs and avocadoes and came across this one!  I deviated from this recipe by using the "Gourmet Guacamole" recipe and used roasted red pepper strips instead of salsa.  I also didn't have any cottage cheese, so I used crumbled goat cheese.  It was delicious!

These were a nice twist on same ol' same ol' breakfast!  I used sliced avocado, scrambled my eggs with a little onion, Worchester Sauce and seasoned salt.  And I used multigrain tortilla shells.  Delish.  Thanx for the recipe.

I thought Husband would like a change from the usual scrambled egg/bacon/cheese/salsa breakfast burritos I make him, but unfortunately I was wrong. He managed a few bites but said he really didn't like it; I had a taste, and had to agree. Not a good combination of flavors, and the sloppy texture is also pretty off-putting. Oh well, thanks anyway!

Even with the substitution of salsa for the ketchup these didn't make the grade with us this morning.  Basically mushy and flavorless, these would be so much better with some seasoning, some vegetables for color, flavor and texture, and even some meat - sausage, bacon or ham maybe? Didn't care for the addition of the cottage cheese at all, and the look and mouthfeel of this in general, as another reviewer put it, was simply offputting.

It was delicious! To cut out some of the fat I didn't add any cheddar cheese but instead cut tomatoes and added them in. It was very delicious! :)

I thought it was very good if you are an avocado fan like I am.  I did alter it a little though and made more of a basic guacamole instead of plain avocado (guacamole seasoning and lime juice).

Great recipe, although I did not follow exactly.  Was looking for a breakfast idea with avocado...so this came up and was the perfect starting point.  I did my scramble the way I normally do (salt, pepper, and a random spice; essence or tumeric...anything that will give it a little extra something).  Browned the tortillas, once on the second side I put goat cheeese and let it soften while browning the tortilla.  Removed from heat, added thinly sliced avocado, then the scrambled eggs and that was it.  Cottage cheese and ketchup did not seem right with this.  But I didn't try it.  Thanks for the idea, we really enjoyed this!!

Spectacular dish and easy to make.  I was a little distracted and forgot to buy the cottage cheese but ended up substituting that and the ketchup with fresh salsa and jalapeños.  Tonight I am going to add fajita veggies too!

I was forewarned by the other reviews that the burrito would come out bland and messy, so I added less cottage cheese, some pepper and chili powder to the mixture as well as blended cream cheese with the avocado. I smeared the avocado-cream cheese on the bottom of our plates (gluten-free), poured salsa over it and used the eggs as a topping. It turned out great! I was worried about the avocado flavor being overpowering but it all blended together wonderfully.

I was looking for a breakfast recipe with eggs and avocado and found this. Made it with a few slightly changes and it came out delicious!! Instead of smashing the avocado, I just cut it in really thin slices and I added some Worcester sauce to the eggs for some taste. Next time I will add some onions to the smashed egg and it should come out even better. We also did not have any bacon, sausage or ham but I am sure it would give a special taste as well. Served with salsa.

This is really good! I changed it a bit by omitting the milk and just using regular cottage cheese. I cooked the eggs and cottage cheese together then added the cheddar cheese. I'm not a ketchup person but thought that the husband would like it with salsa or hot sauce.

I made this as our Christmas breakfast. I didn't have any tortillas, so I made it a bowl instead. After cooking the eggs, I mixed in Mexican cheese, cubed avocado, fried peppered bacon (I crumbled them) and Verde salsa. The flavor was quite delicious. will definitely make again. We also had leftover fritos scoops that we used to scoop the bowl.

Made it exactly how it said. Very yummy!  My granddaughter even ate one and she does not like avocados. Of course, I put less on her burrito.  I used mild salsa for dipping. Also tried green salsa. Green is my favorite. Highly recommend this.

I sautéed some red onion then scrambled the egg in with it and Instead of cottage cheese I used cream cheese. And scratch ketchup, I used Tapatio! Delicious :)
