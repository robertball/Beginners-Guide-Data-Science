Toasted English Muffins are delicious for so many breakfast ideas.  You don't have to have all those ingredients listed to have an amazing breakfast.   I love fried egg with melted cheese ans bacon or ham home fries on the side...OH YES

04.25.17 ~ What a great way to start the morning.  I downsized this to one serving skipping the mushrooms.  It is delicious and very easy to prepare.

I made these for breakfast this morning, and everyone loved them.  I did cut the recipe in half, and also added a Â¼ teaspoon of oregano to the eggs.  Next time I may add a thin smear of pizza sauce to the toasted muffin.  definitely a keeper.
