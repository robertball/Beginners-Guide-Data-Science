8.2.18  The air fryer comes through again!  This was absolutely delicious, and cooked perfectly at 350ºF for 15 minutes.  I used Panko breadcrumbs, and could see using the Italian Panko, as well.  I enjoyed this for lunch today and absolutely would enjoy this as a healthy side dish but, also, wouldn't hesitate to cut the zucchini into chunks, stick a toothpick in it, and serve as an appetizer.  Honestly, this recipe exceeded my expectations!!

Just made this and it was deeee-lish! Didn’t have parsely so used whatever I had on hand: Herbs De Provence (basil, marjoram, thyme, sage, savory, rosemary). Also accidentally used a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon to measure everything out, but it turned out to be the perfect amount to top off one whole zucchini. Cooked in my air fryer at the recommended 180 degrees for 15 min. Tasted great with ranch sauce and served alongside breaded chicken tenders (also cooked in the air fryer)! Yumm!

I'm always looking for different ways to use up the zucchini from the garden and this worked out very well.  I think I may have used a little too much oil but it didn't detract from the flavor.

I really wanted to like this recipe and it may have been my error but these were. It good. Mine turned out soggy and lackluster in flavor. I followed recipe per written ingredients and instruction so I’m not sure if it’s the fact I didn’t like it and or I messed up somewhere along the way regardless I won’t be trying it again.
