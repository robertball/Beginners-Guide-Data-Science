I changed a few things for what I had on hand.  Turned out really good.  I used a large can of tomato soup then filled the can with half milk, half broth.  Threw in canned tomatoes all the spices they listed and a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon.  Had the perfect spice with a tinge of sweetness.  All my veggies were sauted and put in to boil.  It was great with a grill cheese for a rainy day supper. Will definitely make it agian!

This is the tomato soup I've been searching for! So rich and filling without any cream. I also added a can of diced tomatoes.

Oh wow. This was AWESOME. This is the tomato soup I've been searching for...highlights the flavor of veggies, no milk or cream. The sugar made the tomato flavor so lovely. The only things I had to omit were the veggie bouillon, parsely, and I omitted the salt b/c it was plenty salty. For the Italian seasoning, I used 1/2 a ts each of oregano and basil. Other than that, I followed the whole thing perfectly. Made 6 hearty servings that don't need accompaniment. Just b/c it's tradition, I plopped a little plain yogurt on top...unnecessary. I ate it with bread and a little cheese...also unneccessary.

This was the best vegetable soup I've made!  It was a great Ash Wednesday dinner.  The only thing I changed was I only had one 15 oz can of tomato sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes and about a TBSP of tomato paste (to thicken it a bit).  I also let it simmer on the stove for about 2 hours and I didn't add pasta.  It would be wonderful with pasta, but I left it out for simplicity.  Will definitely make this again!

This is the best tomato soup. It's loaded with a warm smooth flavor that compliments all of the ingredients. Made this along with the allrecipes Grilled Cheese for the Gods.

This was sooooo easy to make and delicious.  I did make a few modifications.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a can of diced tomatoes, I doubled the red pepper sauce, doubled the pasta and I added a half cup of fat free half & half cream to make it thicker.  Lastly, if you cook this with the lid on it contains the moisture ... if you want a thicker sauce then take off the lid and cook an additional 30-minutes.

This was a yummy soup for a rainy day today! It was a little thin for my tastes, but it will probably be a bit thicker tomorrow as leftovers. I did kick up the Tabasco sauce a bit, but this was personal preference. I have made a recipe very similar to this with a couple of cans of kidney beans (rinsed and drained) and this makes a yummy protein boost! A nice recipe.

Love, love, love this soup.  This is the perfect receipe for adding/subtracting according to one's personal taste or what you happen to have on hand.  I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used 1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes w/ basil and garlic and added one (tomato can) of V-8 Vegetable juice and only 4 cups of water (like mine a little thicker).  I didn't have any Italian Seasonings, added 1/4 t. basil and 1/4 t. oregano and 1 t. Mrs. Dash's Original Seasonings. Also, added barely 1/8 t. nutmeg.  All the other seasonings-vegetables were as stated.  10 minutes before adding pasta I added 1 handful of fresh spinach.  On serving added 1 T. grated parmasan cheese on top of soup.  With homemade French Bread from this site. . . this is absolutely wonderful!!!  Great comfort food on a cold winter day.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  This is definitely a keeper and will make this often.  Oh, and this freezes beautifully.

Try adding about 1 cup whipping cream to turn it into tomato bisque, it is so good it's addictive!

This is one of my very favorite dinners to make. I usually top it with mozzarella and pair it with a hearty whole grain bread. I don't change anything about the recipe - it's perfect as is. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Even non-soup eating hubby liked it.  The only changes I made was that I added some basil and used canned tomatoes that I pureed (didn't have any tomato juice).  Had it with grilled turkey and cheddar sandwhiches.

There were several ingredients I didn't have on hand: zuchinni, bay leaf. But I made it anyway, used milk for a third of the liquid, served with grilled cheese, and my boyfriend sang its praises every 2 minutes and had 3 bowls. I was also very pleased and will definitely makee it again. Thanks!

Tasted artificial .. Canned tomato sauce not a good idea. Would make again with homemade tomato sauce.

For me, this soup was quite bland.  I did forget to add the hot sauce so maybe that would have made a difference.   ... Good but not exciting

This soup has a wonderful flavor!  I made the broth almost exactly as directed (subbing onion powder for the onion), but since my husband does not eat vegetables I omitted the carrots, celery, and zucchini.  I used one can of diced potatoes, one can of yellow corn, and one cup of elbow macaroni.  Served it with a grilled turkey & cheese sandwich.  A delicious meal on this cold winter night!!  Thank you Peprich for your amazing recipe.

This soup is absolutely delicious and the recipe lends itself well to adaptations to fit the ingredients you have on hand.  I will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this soup and my boys did too! I didn’t have the same vegetables so I just used frozen peas and carrots and added some macaroni but it was good! Good base and I’m sure whatever you would like to put in would still make it good!

I followed some other reviews and used vegetable broth instead of water. I omitted the salt and hot red pepper sauce. I did add a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon, 1/2 cup of milk with cornstarch and mushrooms.  I liked the soup with the changes which depends on your hot or mild taste!

Used 28 oz.crushed tomato instead of tomato sauce, left out salt (bullion had enough salt in it for my taste). Basically, recipe stayed the same. Terrific!

very good--thanks for this vegetarian recipe!  I imagine it will be good chilled during warmer weather.
I used  4c  low sodium vegetable broth instead  of water/boullion, and added  chick peas and mushrooms.   Also used canned carrots and corn. Next  time, I will also add diced tomatoes.    Your seasonings were spot on--thanks.

Additional:  still love it, even more.  Instead of tomato sauce, I'm using a large can of crushed tomatoes, +/-  tomato sauce, basically whatever I have on hand.  But I have made this almost every week since May since my hubby loves it so much.  thanks.

I enjoyed the flavor of this soup. Also loved that I could eat alot for not many calories. Next time I will precook my carrots. They did not soften in the amount of time stated.

Anything that gets my kids to eat veggies is a winner in my book!   Before I added the pasta (I used what I had- shells), I put half in a container to freeze.  Now I have an easy dinner for another night!

Really good smooth tomato vegetable flavour. I followed the recipe almost exactly and added some soya protein to make it more of a 'hamburger' soup. Very good. Will make it again.

With a good soup recipe I believe you should be able to omit a few ingredients and still have a good soup. Made this as a 'we're broke' meal (minus a few ingredients and with some jiffy cornbread) and it was great!
