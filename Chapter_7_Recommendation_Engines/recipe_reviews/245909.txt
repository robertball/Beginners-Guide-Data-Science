A very simple and delicious oil mixture! Why spend money on store-bought flavored oils? I used this as a dipping oil with fresh Italian bread.  I made a half batch and wish I had made more. I will use the rest in my salad dressing.  I do agree with the recipe creator that using it to cook will burn the herbs, so I'd stick with using it in uncooked dishes.  Next time I will use fresh herbs instead of dry.
