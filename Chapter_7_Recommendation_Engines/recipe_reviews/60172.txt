This sauce had wonderful flavor!!! I used some homemade pepper jelly that I got from this site (red & green Christmas jelly) & I used boneless chicken breasts instead of bone-in & marinaded them in the mixture for a couple of hours before baking. I decreased the cooking time to account for using the boneless (baked about 40 minutes). I served them w/ rice cooked w/ chicken broth & herbs (the sauce is fantastic on the rice!) & steamed broccoli...we all loved this meal very tasty.

This chicken deserves 10 stars! I used chicken breast tenderloin strips as that was all I had on hand. It made a delicious sauce that we used on our veggies & bread as well! This is a "Hall of Famer"!!! Thanks a million!

My husband and I really liked this recipe! I prepared the chicken with the pepper jelly a day ahead refrigerated it and then baked it. It was delicious and we loved the sweet and spicy taste.

I needed something easy that I already had all the ingredients for. This was it. It was very good my family liked it a lot. I did add a little Tabasco we like spicy! We also ate the sauce on rice. I glazed it often so the meat was more red than in the picture. I doubled the recipe and cooked 6 big breasts.

I had a hard time finding pepper jelly but once I did I tried this recipe right away. It was good for a different take on the usual chicken dinner. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts which worked fine.

I had such high expectations for this recipe but I think I used a little too much honey and dijon mustard for our tastes. I didn't expect to have such a runny sauce thinking it would reduce to a glaze. My husband was turned off by the reddish tinge to the chicken and only one of our two kids liked it (they're fussy and don't like anything with flavour or sauces). It was easy to make and I WILL try this again adjusting the sauce ingredients to our tastes. Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out good. I used a hot pepper & peach jelly I had on hand. I also thickened the juice with a little cornstarch mixture. Tasted kind of like a spicy Asian chicken dish. Thanks!

This was good I was looking for a way to use up half a jar of red pepper jelly. I used the sauce to marinade (so the chicken got dyed red) and then cooked the chicken and sauce on the stovetop and poured over brown rice. It came out kind of like sweet and sour chicken and I was wishing I had added some pineapple or bell peppers to the mix. However I don't know if I would make this again I gave some to a friend and she didn't care for it.

8.19.05 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/60172/pepper-jelly-glazed-chicken/ ... Very good sauce - spicy & sweet - but it loses most of it's flavor during baking. I'll keep that sauce recipe to use with sandwiches - when I'm feelin' wild! :D

This was delicious although I think we would have enjoyed it more had I used boneless-skinless chicken breast. So much of the sauce was wasted when we pulled the skin off the chicken. The sauce had great flavor and and thickened up nicely as it baked. I will definitely make this again just changing the chicken. We thought this would be a delicious sauce to use with kielbasa and peppers. I served this with 'Tomato Bruschetta' from AR and a tossed salad.

I made this with hot pepper and rasberry chipolte sauce and it was so good. I marinated the chicken in the sauce mixture for about 29 hours and then removed the chicken from the sauce mixture and place on a baking tray spooned some sauce on top and stuck them in the oven spooning more sauce on every 15 minutes or so. Baked these for about 45 minutes and I think 35 would have been enough. Served with plain fettucini and green beans. Will defintely make again. Thanks!

This was good not great but good. It was easy and very quick to put together and a great way to use left over peper jelly. I served it with rice and fresh broccoli and spooned the sauce over the rice. It was good but I was glad when I got to the last bite.

I tried this on chicken tenders because thats all I had grilled it up and worked out great. Honestly I have a feeling this would make a great chicken wing recipe too so next time I may try that.

Delicious sauce! I added some garlic and sauteed onion too. I ended up removing them from the oven and throwing them on the grill. I don't like it when skin doesn't get crispy and it didn't seem to be roasting I think next time I would brown the chicken first then bake in the sauce. All in all it was very tasty and I will definitely be making this again!

Really good. Initially it was sweet but then the spice kicked in. I used boneless skinless chicken instead. Baked for about 45 minutes.

I made this for dinner last night and I was totally disappointed. I had high expectations for this recipe. I followed it to a "T" with the exception of using boneless chix breasts and sprinkling with onion flakes and garlic powder before adding the sauce. Baked for appx 45 mins. My problem was the chicken. It was tough to chew. I have never had chicken that was like leather. It was not dry so it was not overcooked and I know it was not undercooked. I do not know what went wrong. This will remain a mystery to me. If anyone has any ideas I would appreciate your comments. I rated as '4' because the taste was there and we really like the flavor. It was the texture of the meat....

This was great with cubed chicken over rice. Almost had a sweet and sour/spicy asian feel to it. You could easily throw in some vegis for a complete meal.

Realy great recipe! I doubled the sauce as I wanted extra to pour over rice but next time I will not double as it made too much. This prevented the sauce from creating a nice glaze on the chicken. I think it would be great with hearty slices of Kielbasa and chucky pieces of red and green bell peppers added!

I have made this several times and absolutely love it. I use my homemade red pepper jelly and bone-in skin-on chicken thighs (flavour preference). The glaze is so good and it's one of the easiest dinners to put together. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Not anything to write home about. Like most I assume I was looking for a way to use some pepper jelly with chicken as opposed to in a pork or red meat dish. The individual ingredients used were not just my run of the mill pantry items either. Marinated the chicken in the jelly mix for a couple hours prior to baking and was amiss that the chicken was so dry. A spicier mustard perhaps???? Can t say I ll make this again but can t say I won t because the dish is too simple with things I always have on hand.

Super easy but next time I would add a bit of cayenne to the mix. The long bake time takes a good bit of heat out of the jelly and we like it spicy.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit!! I couldn't find red pepper jelly so I used green pepper jelly and it worked out great. I used boneless skinless chicken breast (so I cut the cooking time down to 40 minutes). I also basted the chicken with the glaze ever 10 minutes. The glaze ended up thicking up and making a yummy sauce that my husband poured over his smashed potatoes.

Husband says this is five stars. Extremely easy. Made to the recipe except I used jalapeño pepper jelly (had on hand) boneless chicken thighs and marinated in the sauce 2 hours prior to cooking. I added chopped red and yellow peppers to the top before baking and broiled the top for a few minutes at the end. Served with chive herb and garlic mashed potatoes. Yummy! Will try again with fish and maybe add a bit more jalapeño.

I was concerned it may be too much mustard - but it was just right. I did lightly brown the chicken breasts for appearance sake. Looked great and tasted great. Served with coconut rice.

This recipe was amazing and super easy. I highly recommend tossing the chicken in bread crumbs after coating it in the pepper jelly mixture and then baking it in the oven.

Great for a flavorful quick dinner if using boneless chicken breast.

It wasn't bad but it certainly didn't blow my socks off. I used almost half of my jar of pepper jelly and it definitely wasn't worth it. I was disappointed that the flavor was mild. I guess it diluted from mingling with chicken breast juices? Maybe reducing the sauce after the chicken cooks would make it worthwhile. I took the leftovers and reduced the sauce over low heat constantly stirring until it was probably half of the amount I began with. MUCH MUCH tastier!!

This was very good and not too hot. As others have said the sauce is fantastic over garlic and butter rice.
