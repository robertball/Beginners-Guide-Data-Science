I halfed the recipe - other than that I followed the directions exactly.  I thought the dough did not have the right consistency - I cooked a few batches and the cookies took a long time to cook - and they were very flat - stuck to the cookie sheet.  I then added a little flour to the rest of the dough and the next batch turned out a little better.  If i make these again, I would NOT put the milk in the dough and I would bake them at 375.

The Amish in our area tend to over-sweeten their cookies, so, I cut out 1 cup of sugar and they turned out great.  I was out of chocolate chips and used raisins instead.  I made them bigger than I normally do because the batch is so large.

These cookies tasted good in the end but overall were very aggravating to bake. I don't think I'll be adding milk next time as it made the mixture far too runny. The first batch stuck together in a giant rectangle in the oven and I had to cut them into slices! Even then they still seemed sticky although eventually set once I'd laid them on a plate to cool. The second batch almost stuck together and still didn't seem to be set. The third batch I added almost half a cup more flour to and they turned out much better. Also, they took at least 30 minutes to cook, if not more. I always thought gas ovens cooked faster but obviously not in this case. I liked these cookies, although they weren't a favourite, but fiance loved them as he really likes coconut and walnuts. So I'll probably have to make them again some time. They were a lot of fuss to make but now that I know to skip the milk they should work out better next time. Try these if you have a lot of time and patience, and skip the milk!

EDIT: I made these again, minus the milk. They still took 20 minutes to cook but were much, much better. I'll definitely be making these again now that I know they're far better without the milk.

I thought these cookies were just wonderful.  A bit on the crunchy side but the flavor is great.  Recipe does make a ton even after I cut it in half.

These taste wonderful! I did add a little flour to the second batch that I baked since the first one was a little runny though.

I made these for a cookie exchange at work. We had all types of cookies and these were the biggest hit! The recipe makes so many that I brought in extra for my co-workers (we work a 6am shift). Only thing I would change next time is to make fewer, that is unless it's for a cookie exchange again!

I bake tons of cookies and did NOT like this recipe at all! what a waste of ingredients! The milk made the oatmeal soft and mushy in the cookie.  I was onlyable to save them by adding butterscotch chips.

Wow! This makes a ton of cookies. They taste great and the kids did not mind the coconut because of all of the oats.

Excellent cookies!  I am a coconut fan - this is basically an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie with coconut added, which I love.  The recipe as posted is really a double batch, so convert it for half the number of servings.

The flavors were great, but the first few batches didn't turn out so well.  I increased the baking time, and should have added a few extra tablespoons of flour for higher altitude.  I also split the batch in half & added walnuts, coconut, and fresh cranberries to one half, then chocolate chips and pecans to the other half.  A good recipe, but not great.

I scaled this recipe to 1/4. It made 24 cookies. They are my new favorites. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and used a heaping teaspoon to drop cookies. They needed quite a bit of extra cooking time, so I ended cooking the second sheet at 375F. I also sprayed the cookie sheet with PAM on the second tray, since the cookies did not release easily on the first tray. I recommend these cookies. They are chewy and delicious.

Awesome recipe. I actually think it would be better without the chocolate chips (kids and hubby LOVED the chocolate chips but the chef in me played around with the recipe a bit). I have made this 3 times and the only thing I keep changing is the chocolate chips. I used cinnamon chips the second time I made these and butterscotch chips the 3rd time. I like it with the cinnamon chips the best (a little harder to find but perfect with these cookies). I also put the cookies on wax paper that I sprayed with cooking spray before baking and had NO problem with cookies sticking to the pan. This is a cookie I will make often. I can't wait for the next school bake sale to show these off!! Thanks Sharon!!

Quick, simple, delicious cookie.  

If I were to make these again, I may consider reducing the amount of butterscotch chips and adding raisins.  I also did put in a half cup of pecans for crunch.

These are our favorites, I did change out the  walnuts for pecans. These make up so well if I want some for the cookie jar the next day, I double the batch.

great cookie. 
I cut the butter with crisco (1/2 of each) and did not add the milk. I added extra vanilla. They came out nice and puffy and crispy texture.  Rave reviews from all who ate them.
