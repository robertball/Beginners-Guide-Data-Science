This was very good. The key is to liberally season the chicken with salt and pepper before dipping in the egg. I dipped just the top of the chicken breast in egg, as that was the only part being dipped in the onions. I also crushed the fried onions to help them better cover the chicken. My chicken breasts were very large, so I added extra cheese during the last step. The directions don't state whether to cover while baking. I did not at first, but noticed the onions became dark very quickly. I covered the baking dish with foil for about 20 minutes, then uncovered to crisp the onions during the last 10 minutes. Because of the size of the chicken breasts, my cooking time was also longer.

Very good. Also felt it was missing something. Next time I will try to dip the chicken in dijon instead of the egg.

This was good but I feel it was missing something.  Maybe next time I will marinate the chicken first or put some extra seasoning on the chicken.

So quick, easy and tasty!  I made this without the cheese and it was awesome!  Although, for an added kick, I happened upon French fried jalapenos in the grocery store by the salad toppers (croutons, etc).  They are prepared the same way as the onions, so I used half jalapenos and half onions.  YUM!!!  Just enough kick and incredibly good! (I would give five stars, but I personally feel the cheese is totally unnecessary) :)

I goofed and breaded both sides of my chicken breasts.  Decided to bake this in an iron skillet coated with a thin film of canola oil.  The coating was crispy and delicious!  As I really wanted that crispiness, I left off the cheese.  My husband and I both enjoyed this and we'll definitely have it again!

This was boring and sort of tasteless. I ended up pulling the cheese off and will just use the chicken in another recipe that calls for cooked chicken.

For as simple as this was, it was quite good. We really enjoyed it, and will make it again for a quick weeknight meal. Thanks for sharing!
