It was yummy but just too much rice for the amount of other ingredients, I suggest adding only 2 cups unless you add more of the other and also adding an extra cup of broth or beer

My DH grilled the chicken separately so I used chicken stock instead of drippings. I added jalapeños to the mix for a little extra heat.

The recipe was easy to follow and it turned out great, but I’ve made this maybe 6 times now using this recipe and it always takes much longer than the 20 minutes to cook the rice at the end. I have an electric stove, so maybe my low setting is too low. I don’t know.

What a wonderful recipe, combining two staples for a wonderful budget meal.  I did not use the beer, used chicken brouth for the rice plus a little water.  The reason I did not give this a 5 star is that it did not mention removing the skin if you are using a whole chicken, a must.  This will be made many times.

Looked great so it inspired me to do something fun. I made it with egg noodles instead of rice, added some spice via jalapeno slices, touch of chili powder as well as cumin. A few tbs of water in the sauce with teaspoon of cornstarch to give the noodles a thicker coating of juice.  Add peas last to the sauce and then add it all to the finished noodles.

This worked well. I followed Nina Vega's advice and used only 2 cups of rice and added an extra cup of liquid (I used chicken stock). I topped the dish with Peruvian aji sauce (Inka Mama's Aji, from this site) and it really complimented the dish well. Good taste and easy to make. Thanks for sharing!
