These weren't very good. Way too eggy; the last ones got worse.  No one would eat them.  I ate 1.

This was pretty tasty. I do think you either need a tad more flour or a little bit less egg as the last patties I made had a lot of egg in them. I couldn't taste the teriyaki very much, so I added a little on top after cooking. An intresting way to eat Broccoli slaw.  Update : I baked these in the oven the other night. I used a silpat mat, dumped the thing in and baked it. No oil was needed. Very easy, took longer in the oven, but it was worth it to save the calories from the oil.

Easy to prepare and tasted fine but did not become a pattie as I had hoped. There was loose slaw in the pan that burned badly and made clean up a mess.

We loved this recipe.  I read all the reviews before trying and cut down on the eggs.  I also added salt, pepper and garlic powder for added flavor.  I served the patties with sweet sour sauce and additional teriyake.  Will make again.

It may have been the type of teriyaki I used but I found this rather bland.  I dipped mine in soy with some wasabi (horseradish) and topped with ginger, and it was okay.  I don't know if I'd make again...Perhaps with some modifications.  Thanks anyway for an interesting idea.

I have to admit that this recipe was excellent and am surprised at 3/4 of the reviews.  I appreciated the review to cut down egg and add flour, which worked.  I simply added some asian flavour: (soya sauce, sesame seeds, oyster sauce, fresh ginger & garlic).  This is great foundation recipe that is simple and can be customized.  I will definitely make this one again!

Glad I read the reviews before trying. I used a variety of veggies and added more flour. Didn't have terriyaki on hand so I used tamari. Still, I don't think I'd serve again.
