This recipe was just what I was looking for.Like others had mention it was a little bland so I seasoned the chicken prior to cooking(salt,pepper,onion powder)this made it really good.I also added s&p and parsley to the whole mixture along withsome of the parmesan cheese,top with more cheese and it was perfect!!!Definately a keeper.

Wonderful flavor.  My husband asked me to make it again and he usually isn't a big tomato fan!

Good, though husband complained that it needed more flavor.  Next time, i will try to figure out the right spices to jazz it up with, it would be fantastic with just a little bit more zing.

This was pretty good.  I changed it a little by adding some more veggies and topped it w/ parm cheese and red pepper.

This is really very good.  It is also one of those meals where they are even better the next day.  I shared it with many friends.

This recipe just needs more flavor to suit our family's taste.  The next time I make it, I will add a lot more garlic.

Good starting point, next time would vary it a little and add more spices and flavors to give it a little kick.  My friends and I enjoyed it though, and found it's a good way to get people to eat their broccoli.

Served this as one of many dishes at my daughter's Christening party.  It went over pretty well - most of it was eaten.  I did add some spicy red pepper though.

I have been making this dish for years, and we love it.

I add some salt for the final mix.

I sometiimes use milk instead of cream, dending on what I have on hand.

Okay, I took the advice that this was a little bland, so I used one canof diced tomatos and one can of milder rotel. I also seasoned the chicken before cooking it.

Pretty decent - I made some changes based on reviews that said it needed more flavor. I put some Mixed-up Salt and Red Pepper Flakes in with the chicken, and when it was almost cooked through, i added some keilbasa. (would have preferred to add cooked bacon, but didn't have any in the house) I used canned whole tomatoes instead of fresh, and omitted the rosemary since my husband hates it, and after adding the cream i put in about 1/3-1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. After simmering for about 10 min, it thickened up niceley, very nicely, actually, not too thick, not too runny. Just make sure to stir often so the milk doesn't burn at the bottom of the pan. Overall, it turned out very well with the changes (i also used egg fettucine instead of ziti) and definitely had enough flavor. Very yummy! And i loved that i already had everything i needed - few ingredients, great taste! :)

This recipe was great, I did have to add some kick to the chicken while cooking so that it would not be to bland and I used onion as well. It was greatly received.

A perfect summertime recipe. I loved this - so did my husband and 2 year old. I cut up some chicken we had marinated and grilled, which really made it special. I left out the rosemary because I'm not a big fan, but it really didn't need it. Make sure to use fresh broccoli and home grown tomatoes if you can find them (or grow them, like I do). The only seasoning this needed was a little salt and freshly ground pepper.  Really fresh tasting and delicious!

Not a perfect recipe but very yummy.  I didn't think it was creamy enough but loved the flavor the rosemary added some great flavor.  I'll make it again but modify the sauce a bit!

This recipe sounded so good I looked forward to making it. It had all the ingredients my family loves. I followed the recipe but it turned out VERY bland. The next night I added red pasta sauce to the leftovers. It tasted better, but not good enough to want to make again.
