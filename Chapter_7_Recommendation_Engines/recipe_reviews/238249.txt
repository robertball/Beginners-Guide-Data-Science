I had a craving for ham yesterday and found a 2 lb. cottage ham at a local grocery. I'd never heard of that type but noticed they were rather pricey so I figured it was most likely a finer cut. I was right. Yay! I believe most any kind of decent ham would work in this recipe. However, the smaller size and shape of of a sliced cottage ham really helps make a mouth watering presentation at the table! Wish I'd taken a picture.

I changed the recipe slightly because of what was in my root cellar. I used about 1 1/2 lbs. of baby German Butterball potatoes (similar to Yukon Gold), a qt. of canned Black Valentine Green Beans and 4 small Stuttgarter Yellow Onions ends trimmed and otherwise left whole. Quite frankly, I think one could use just about any variety of these vegetables. I can't imagine the combination of these 4 simple ingredients getting screwed up. Aside from that, I followed the preparation instructions to the letter, making sure to cook the potatoes just to the point where they could easily be pierced with a fork. Then I drained the whole pot into a colander and literally dumped it into a ceramic baking dish for serving. On a cutting board, I sliced the ham a generous 1/2" thick then transferred it to one end of the serving dish. Thanks Michael for the inspiration. Down home cooking just doesn't get any better than this!

This is great!  I have been making this exact recipe now for 41 years and I was also raised on it!  My mother made it at least twice a month!  We always get our Hams from an old fashioned butcher shop!  Being of German descent this is a must!  I have found though that if you put the potatoes in at the start they get really mushy! So I add them about an hour before it's completely done so I never use the crock pot! I also add a few cloves of garlic & some regular Mrs. Dash!   Also Cottage Hams are not smoked, never were, they are also not pork butts!  They are brined hams!  Germans aren't into smoked meats! They are more the brined or pickled!

Thought this was a fairly good recipe.  I altered it slightly.  I used slices of our leftover spiral ham instead of a cottage ham; I sauteed the onions for a few minutes in some olive oil first to be sure they were fully cooked; I cooked the onions and potatoes for several minutes before adding the ham, so as not to boil all the flavor out of the ham; and I used frozen green beans, adding them just a few minutes before the dish was finished so as not to overcook the green beans.

I made a double recipe using half of a giant sale ham just to do something with it and we loved it.  Made mostly to recipe except that I couldn't resist adding fresh ground pepper and stock (beef was on hand in this instance) to the water.  This is awesome and will be made again!!

Mom made this recipe with additional fresh quarters of cabbage, no onions. Crusty Italian bread was awesome to dip in the broth! I use Turkey ham now (low salt, low fat) but it doesn't have the flavor of a good quality cottage ham.

This was my first recipe for 2018 and what a great treat! I followed the recipe exactly; the only thing I did differently was I cooked it in my crockpot. I also used a regular ham. Simply delicious. Definitely a keeper.

This was really good! I cooked mine in the crock pot. I did use thawed frozen green beans instead of the canned and chicken stock instead of water. Mmm,Mmm, Mmm.
