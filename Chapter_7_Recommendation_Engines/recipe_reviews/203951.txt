When I first decided to make this recipe, I was little dubious because the ingredients didn't seem too exciting. Boy, was I wrong! This dish was incredibly good...something that I would definitely make again! The taste/texture was similar to Rice-a-Roni, but so  much better, without that packaged taste. I topped it with chopped chives for a little more color, and everyone loved it. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Just average. While I wanted something more subtle to go with the main dish, I still was looking for something more flavorful than this. Surprising, since one would have thought that since I used a flavored, specialty orzo medley along with the onion, garlic and chicken broth, that wouldn't have been the case. Definitely needs a hint of seasoning of some sort. Still, a perfectly acceptable companion to a heartier, more robustly flavored main dish.

Outstanding recipe!  Certainly proof that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."  Served plain with roast chicken, turned the leftovers into fried rice the next day.  Used organic chicken broth and brown basmati rice.  To reduce cooking time for basmati rice, soak it in warm water to cover for 20 minutes, then drain & add to the pot.

This recipe is delicious with a few additions! I always double the recipe but follow the steps exactly, except when it comes time to add the onion I also add diced carrots and mushrooms (I never measure this but its probably about 1/2-3/4 cup each). Then, when I add the stock I also include about 1/2-3/4 c. of frozen peas. After everything has cooked and the rice has absorbed all the liquid, I gently stir in about 1/4-1/2 lb. of slivered toasted almonds (I always end up buying the almonds raw and dry toasting them myself). With these additions my family and friends love this recipe, and I get requests for it all the time!

Don't be mad; I wanted to rate this recipe even though I made changes. I used spaghetti broken into 1 inch pieces because I didn't have orzo. I left out the garlic and onion because I wanted it to taste "plain" so that it didn't compete with my flavorful main dish. So all I used was pasta, butter, rice, and broth and it was delicious!! Greater than the sum of its parts for sure, and very easy.

Perfect! I searched everywhere for a simple Rice Pilaf recipe with Orzo. This was exactly what I had in mind. So simple, yet SO flavorful. I did use long grain brown rice and low sodium chicken broth to make the dish slightly healthier. We will absolutely be making this a staple in our home :)

When I made this recipe, I found it to be a little, O.K., alot bland. But, I did use homemade chicken broth, and while very tasty, it was not overly salted. Perhaps using store bought broth would be more flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly, and I did feel the measurements are spot-on. It makes enough for four people, and the liquid ratio is perfect with the dry ingredients. Once I salted at the stove and the table, I found this to be a really tasty side dish I plan to serve again.

I was looking for a rice pilaf recipe to go with fish and found this. It was excellent. I made it exactly as written except I used just one can of chicken broth which is a little less than 2 cups. I usually scale back the water called for in rice recipes as I don't like wet rice. Also I added a pinch of salt and some dried parsley at the end for a bit of color. It was really delicious and had a depth of flavor I was not expecting. It is extremely important to really brown the pasta though, I think a lot of people skip that part when making pilaf.

I would consider this a perfect side to a complex main dish.  Nich subtle flavors and very easily personalized.  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and son were very pleased.  Served with a chuck roast that I had given a spicy flare and sauteed veggies.  Yum!

You cannot get any easier than this and the best part is that it is absolutely delicious.  This is 100x better than any boxed rice can be.  The only thing I added was a little salt, because of the low sodium broth I used.  I also don't measure the onion, just chopped half of a big onion and threw it in.  It pairs quite well with roasted chicken and butternut squash.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I've been making a rice pilaf for more years than I
care to remember.  Instead of orzo I use angel hair or thin spaghetti, broken into 2-inch pieces, and since I usually make it to go with a roast, I use beef bouillon granules or cubes, 1 tsp or cube, plus one for the pot, for each cup of water, do not use garlic, but lots of onions, and salt and pepper to taste, plus a sprinkle of minced parsley.  I also use instant rice, gets the dish to the table sooner.
Other then those few changes, I saute the onions and pasta in butter until the onion is tender and the pasta nice and brown, stir in the rice to coat with the butter and add the water, bring the water to a boil, put on the lid and turn off the heat, let it stand for 10 minutes, and serve.  My family loves it so I alway have to at least double the recipe.  It's good the next morning, fried and topped with an egg.

Although I didn't use onions and I added some parmesan, this was a really big hit in my family.  I had doubled the recipe and had to make more!  Very simple to make and really a nice side dish.

We liked it but the order you add ingredients seems off to me. I've made other pilafs and always start with the onion because that takes longest to cook. After the onion softens then I added the rice and orzo and when those were almost done toasting I added the garlic for a couple minutes, then the broth. But the proportions were good.

I looked at the different recipes for rice pilaf on this site, and settled on this one because of its simplicity. I followed it exactly, using my trusty non-stick heavy skillet. It turned out EXACTLY as I expected, based on the simple ingredients. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! This is now a standard at my house.

Absolutely delicious! I steamed some broccoli, chopped it up finely, and tossed that into the pilaf. Outstanding! It's a very flexible side dish that would go well with just about any meal!

Yum!  Doubled the rice and Orzo.  Used instant (Minute) rice and upped the chicken broth to 3 cups.  Take the time to brown the Orzo pasta.  Added some fresh parsley and grated parmesan at the end.  Delicious!!  Will be making this again and again!

I've made this twice now and we really like it. After reading the ingredient list on the Uncle Ben's Rice Pilaf box, I added a little turmeric the second time I made it. Of course I didn't add the msg that was also listed! It is very easy to make and is moist and flavorful! Thank you, Sarah!

I needed a quick side... so I made plain rice in the rice cooker and then followed this recipe.  Sauteed little star pasta (didn't have orzo) til brown and toasty.  Separately (so pasta doesn't burn) saute onions, garlic and I added a can of drained mushrooms.  Everyone loved it!

Easy to make and delicious. The key is to cook the orzo and rice till it gets brown, then add water and other ingredients. Browning the orzo and rice gives it a deep nutty flavor. 
Made this multiple times tried with/without garlic or onion. Also use vegetable bullion because my daughter is a vegetarian. Always comes out great and easy to make.

Very nice, Sarah.  thank you.  I used whole wheat orzo and jasmine rice (what I had)  Jazzed up the flavor a tiny bit with a light sprinkle of spicy seasoned salt and True Lemon.  Served with Moroccan Chicken Stew (from this site) and brussel sprouts.  Very yummy meal.

This is a very simple basic recipe that turns out everytime.  This recipe is versatile and can be used as a base for many rice pilaf dishes.  I highly recommend using either chicken or beef stock, and then whatever veggies etc... you like.  The slivered almonds are a must for the texture contrast.

Great basic pilaf!  Hubby loves Rice-a-Roni and I don't care for boxed "foods," so this is PERFECT!!!  And about 1% of the price to make it yourself to boot!!!  I added some parsley, parm, and a pat of butter after tasting as written, and it still needed salt (but I used low-sodium bouillon base, standard broth called for would have added a lot of saltiness).  Made with salmon this time, but it could go with anything... and can be EASILY altered to compete with all the Rice-a-Roni flavors.  Might even add golden raisins and almonds for something similar to a dish my mom made as a kid.  Love it!  THANKS!!!

This recipe was excellent!  I did make some changes.  I used Basmati rice in place of long grain white rice and I added cremini (baby bell) mushrooms and some thyme to this recipe.  My husband, who is on a low carb diet, wolfed down his small portion and went back for seconds!  That's saying something!

This was really good.   Perhaps a bit more seasoning but not sure what I would use... the rice came out very well along with the orzo.... completed the chicken dinner.

Really good, creamy, garlic, gentle favor.  My changes: water with chicken boullion, didn't have orzo so used broken spaghetti in it's place.  Will be serving with fried shrimp and brussel sprouts. Thanks!

I don't know why it has taken me so long to review this recipe. I make it ALL the time! It goes so well with so many dishes, its simple and everyone loves it! I have tried it with wild rice too, it is very good you just have to cook it a little longer. The only thing is it seems like it always needs salt. So I usually add a little garlic salt in when i add the rice. I skip that step though if there is going to be some kind of sauce that i am serving with the meal.

This was very good!  The only change I’d make is to stir in some chopped parsley to give it a little color.  I froze half and I’m sure it will reheat beautifully in the microwave.

Great recipe and so much healthier than the boxed pilaf.   I added 1/4 tsp. turmeric, 1/4 tsp. paprika and 2 tsp. parsley.   This will definitely become a staple in our household.  I did not add any salt so the only sodium came from the chicken broth.

This was on the "good" side of "OK". I debated 3 stars but went with 4 because I think this is a good base recipe, I just require more seasoning than this, because mine came out bland (to me). I typically sub either chicken base & water or chicken bouillon & water for "chicken broth", and I did bouillon here. (2 tsps for 2 cups water, as is normal for Knorr brand.) I think that the pasta must have sucked up most of the flavor because I do a rice-only dish like this and it comes out more flavorful than this one, so my guess is that the pasta makes you need more seasoning. Easy enough to change to my taste in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a really good and easy rice pilaf recipe. I gave 4 stars only because I thought it was a little bland. I added some xtra chicken bouillon to it and it was perfect.

Great rice pilaf!  I made it almost as stated - toasted the rice with the orzo instead of adding at the end - and it was so good!  I doubled the recipe and it made a LOT.  We had it with grilled salmon - it was a good combo, but next time I think I'll try it with roasted chicken.

Such simple recipe and so delicious, I used a combination rice w/ wild grains in it and orzo pasta and it turned out to be so perfect, the rice is nutty and chewy, and made the recipe healthier I think. I also used my home made broth that was made from the remains of the thanksgiving dinner.

I agree with all the other posters- the sum is equal to more than the parts- I made it exactly as written and t really is a delicious, simple recipe. This will be a go-to. Those who say it was bland, I agree- just add salt and pepper and you should be good.

We loved this recipe. The only thing I did different was added almond slivers the last few minutes. Could have used some salt, but I needed a mild side to go with the Spicy Lime Grilled Shrimp recipe from this sight and it paired really well.  This was easy enough that I'll make it again.

I love this recipe. It is so simple and tasty. I make it a couple of times a month. I do add some salt with the broth, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. I also will adjust the servings to six and it still turns out perfectly.

This is REALLY good even just as a meal by itself. I added 1 tsp of Worstchire sauce + 1tsp of Soy sauce, and a couples pinches each of Oregano, Thyme, ground Sea Salt, and Basil. I also used an extra tbsp of Butter. Turned out AMAZING and I are the entire pan by myself (whoops)

I thought this was okay. When I make white rice, I usually make Brazilian rice from this site which is basically cooked by the same method. I decided to try a different recipe. This badly needed salt when it was done. I added a little sea salt and that helped. The other recipe just seems to have more flavor. I will have to compare the difference. I did like the two different textures between the rice and pasta.

I love rice, my kids not so much. I made a double batch of this for the four of us. Had I made a single batch, there would be no leftovers - so I'm glad I made extra, for my lunch tomorrow. I read all 101 reviews and considered adding some veg due to reports of blandness, then compromised by using vegetable broth, a brand likely only available in Quebec though, a dry mix chock-full of dehydrated vegetables, and that's how I'm making it from now on. Thanks for a great idea, and my apologies to the SF treat people - this is as someone already said 100X better.EDIT JAN 4: I've made this again and again, and we've found that we like it even better using fine egg noodles (like in Ricearoni) although of course orzo is excellent too. At different times I've used curry, coriander, dill, garlic, no garlic, onion, no onion, chicken bouillon, veg bouillon, beef bouillon --whatever suited the main dish, and it's really a flexible, go-to recipe in our house. In fact, my kids now love rice and ask for this. Thanks again for posting!

Delicious! To have the rice cooked all the way I added slightly more than 2C of broth and I cooked it for 24 minutes. Make sure the rice comes to a rolling boil before you cover it and turn down the heat. Wonderful recipe, won't use the box  again :)

This is really easy and tastes surprsingly good. I make it with Brown rice instead of white.  I will consider adding some veggies to it next time.  This will be a frequent side dish at our house.

This is great for a basic rice dish!  We loved it, even with changes I had to make-my kids hate onion so I used dried minced onion so they wouldn't notice.  Would have been so much better with fresh but I really wanted the onion flavor and no complaints so subbed the dried stuff with success.  Also used veggie bouillion to keep it vegetarian.  Perfect side dish, we love rice and I loved the orzo in it.  Great!!  Will definitely make it again. Thanks!

Excellent pilaf - I use this as my standard recipe because it never fails to please.  I pretty much keep to the recipe though use chicken 'better than bouillon' w/out additional salt rather than stock if that's what I have on hand. At the end of cooking it may be a bit too liquid so I put a paper towel over the pot and return lid for it to sit a couple more minutes and all is well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I came across this recipe a few years ago and it is my go-to, we love it.  The one thing I noticed is that it will also depend on the kind of rice you use - basmati, jasmine, par-boiled, will dictate how much water to use.  Our preference is basmati/jasmine, we didn't care for it with par-boiled.  Not quite sure how others found it bland, we think it's fantastic and a favourite. What we've also done is use 2 cubes of chicken bouillon in 2 cups of hot water, and just topped up with plain hot water if extra water is needed.  Works like a charm.  Thanks, Sarah, absolutely love~!

Overall the recipe was good but the pilaf was bland.  Next time I will add some spices to make it more interesting.

My family all loved this.  I don't make white rice and white pasta very often, but it was a nice change.  Very flavorful.

I have fixed this recipe twice now and absolutely love it.  I use a tri-color Orzo.  I made this for my mother's birthday dinner along with Tilapia and it was a hit with everyone.  So easy and delicious.

This was a big hit.  I usually use the boxed rice pilaf but had run out and didn't feel like going to the grocery store.  I found this recipe, didn't change a thing and it came out great. No more boxed stuff at my house!

Absolutely delicious! Forget about those boxed rice pilafs. This recipe is great prepared as is, or it can be dressed up in many different ways. Be sure to brown the orzo. Just makes it even better.

Simple and satisfying, especially with few and easy ingredients.  Not the best pilaf I've ever had, but for the simplicity it is awesome.  Can easily adjust taste to add more depth with additional veggies and/or spices.

Loved it!! Only thing I did differently was I diced a small shallot instead of an onion only because I had one in the fridge.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you.

I had a dinner for 235 people and made this with kabobs.  It was delicious! I added parsley for color and almond slivers for texture.  I also baked mine in the oven and it came out wonderfully!

This recipe was awesome.  It is similar to one my family has used for years, except it adds the onion and garlic.  I used chicken bouillon, as that is what I had, otherwise, everything was the same.  I will be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful, simple side dish!  I used homemade chicken broth, so I did add some salt at the end for flavor.  I'm looing forward to trying it with beef broth also!  Bravo.

This has become a house favorite.  It's so easy to pull together and universally appealing.  I do toss in some chopped carrots and frozen peas to add some color and use crushed garlic instead of the powder

So tasty, simple and even easier when made in an electric pressure cooker. High pressure for 5 minutes then set for 7 minutes, release then done - creamy and delicious!

I didn't use the orzo but whole grain thin spaghetti instead. I also browned the rice with the pasta and onions then added the chicken stock and garlic. I finished it with salt and pepper and some dried parsley. My husband loved it and he's a very picky eater.

Oh so good!  I cooked exactly as written except I seasoned to our liking with salt pepper and cayenne and added a half a cup of frozen peas with the white rice.  This is my first time making anything with orzo and I'm not sure why....very good!

This was okay.  It needed a little more liquid, as the noodles and rice were still a little crunchy after all the water was gone, so I had to add a little more.  I would also add more seasonings to it.

We had this last night with some tilapia.  It was really good.  In fact we ate every last grain we could get out of the pan, and that's amazing because my daughters usually just like plain rice with soy sauce. I used 2 tsp Knorr's chicken flavor bouillon and 2 cups boiling water for the chicken broth. Very inexpensive and taste great.

It's recipes like these that make me wonder why I ever reach for a box of Rice-a-Roni!!! This was simple to make and so yummy! I used vegetable broth which I think sometimes has a better flavor than chicken broth. And of course it needs some salt and pepper to taste.  Otherwise, absolutely perfect! This would be a great side dish to pretty much any entree - I served it with Sweet Orange-Sriracha Chicken and roasted asparagus with a lemon vinaigrette - our taste buds were happy last night:)

This recipe is soooooo good. I tripled it and added a bag of frozen peas & carrots. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. I served it with pan-seared Swai fillets, using "Blackened Seasoning" from this site. Everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing!!! I love this site.

One star off for simple nutrient trade offs that increase nutrient density and lower Glycemic Index. I did change a few things to make it a bit healthier. By trading every tbs of butter for 1 tbs olive oil you are getting less saturated (harmful fatty acid 2g vs. 7g) fat ad more monounsaturated fat healthful fatty acid 9g vs. 4g). Also this recipe is full of carbs. For lower Glycemic index keep orzo (GI 48) and replace rice (GI 73) with barley (GI 28)  or Garbanzo beans (GI28)

Fantastic base side dish!!  Easily adaptable to whatever your tastes are.  I added about 2 tbsp of chopped fresh parsley and it was a fantastic addition.  I would advise adding salt however as it is a tad bland without it.  I added a tsp of garlic salt after it was done and it turned out great.

WOW! This was simply fantastic!!! Both my hubs and I loved the delicate flavor of this easy side dish. If you're looking for BOLD flavors, this might not be for you.... The onion, garlic and butter add a very subtle note to this simple, basic pilaf. Toasting the orzo also adds another layer of flavor, so don't skip that step! On that note, get your orzo good and brown. Don't burn it (stir every now and then, adjusting the heat as necessary), but do be SURE it is a nice golden brown color. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Sarah! This was the best part of our meal. :-)

We LOVED this dish in our house! I made it exactly as written, except I added some sliced sautéed mushrooms because I needed to use them up. I love the texture of the orzo-rice mix and it has a nice nutty flavor from toasting the pasta. It's so easy, quick and versatile, you could add all kinds of veggies to it if desired. The cooking time for me was a little less than stated, about 16 or 17 minutes. I'm definitely adding this to my repertoire.

Perfect side to compliment a flavorful main entree. I thought the taste was great, flavorful enough without being too much. My rice however was a little al-dente and I thought my orzo was a little too done. Not sure what to do next time to better balance the rice tenderness to the orzo.

Absolutely DELICIOUS.  I'll never buy boxed rice dishes again.  Thank you for such a wonderful and easy recipe.  I cooked mostly as written. Only added about 4 pressed garlic cloves.  We LOVE garlic.  Since I served it with Chef John's Pork Tenderloin Diablo (also delicious & easy) I used a can of beef broth rather than chicken.  Next time I'll add a little parsley for color.  For other variations I'll add steamed finely chopped broccoli or carrot.  What a delicious side dish.  Can't wait to make it for company!!

Loved this rice and it's so easy! Used ramen noodles because had no orzo - the kids loved it! Doubled up on garlic because of personal preference - YUM!

This recipe was delicious!  I used homemade my own homemade chicken stock and followed the recipe.  It was a nice balance of flavor without the enormous amount of sodium that is in traditional boxed/packaged rice pilafs.  This was such a hit in my house!!!

Wow!  This is an easy and versatile recipe. It is a great way to use up all the small amounts and different widths of pasta in the pantry of my vacation house.  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken and added some dried parsley for interest.  This recipe lends itself to so many variations.  I think that I will be making it quite often.

planned on following your recipe 100%. I rarely do this. I have been trying to find a way to do pilaf in this fashion. Knowing I have Orzo and Rice on hand, I went at it. 
Then: \
No butter, no chicken broth. So there goes the follow, at this point.
Here is what I did:
4 or 6 tbls ... evoo (not 5) heated in your pan
1/2 cup orzo in hot oil
1 cup diced onion
1 clove diced garlic. like you did
2 cup beef broth
1 cup jasmin rice
1/4 cup sautead mushroom
1/2 cup sautead canned whole tomatoes
(new items added with rice)

I'm happy, and thank you  for the orzo/rice concept.

This was awesome! I used ramon noodles because it was all I had, and broke them up and browned them in butter (I did not use the flavor packet). I left out the garlic because I have one kid that is allergic. I also used some turkey stock I had in the freezer. The result was wonderful and it went along with my salmon and mixed veggies perfectly!

This was really delicious and very simple to make. I found I needed to add some salt (none called for in the recipe) and a 1/2 cup of water part way through cooking because the orzo was absorbing the liquid faster than the rice but otherwise I followed the recipe as is. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fantastic! I made the rice in the rice cooker because I have a horrible habit of burning rice if I make it on the stove. But I followed the rest of the recipe as is, and added the orzo and onion to the rice during the last 10 minutes of the rice cooking. This went well with the baked chicken and green beans for our dinner. And I would imagine the pilaf would go wonderfully with pretty much any meal, or even if you added some veggies it would make a nice light lunch or dinner on it's own. Great recipe, thanks for sharing, Serenamoon!

Made as stated.  3 yr old had 3 servings.  Great basic recipe that allows for tweeking.  Some add ins to try would be parmesian cheese, peas, lentils.

Made this last night for first time.  Good flavor, easy to make.  A wonderful side dish.  This is a keeper.  If you don't like onions, you may want to cut back to 1/4 cup.  I used jasmine rice instead of plain white rice.

I didn't have Orzo, so I used broken spaghetti.  It was really good!  In fact, there was no leftovers!  Thanks for the great easy recipe!!!

I love this recipe! My husband is a huge fan, but me not so much.  So I was looking for a rice recipe with a little flavour and flair.  This is definitly it, I don't change a thing about it, and I actually find myself wanting rice now :)

This was really good.  I felt like it could have been just a little better though.  I'll make it again, but maybe add some additional seasonings.  Thanks for a good recipe!

If you normall buy chicken flavored, box rice/pasta mixture... you know, the SF treat?? Try this recipe. So easy and tastes just as good. If you want to trick the family, throw in a bit of dried parsley flakes to make it look like the boxed stuff. If you don't have orzo, substitute broken spaghetti pieces, about an inch long and saute it in butter before adding the rice and broth. Really, really good and the kids asked for more. Can't go wrong w/this recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

Great recipe but very mild flavor, as others have noted. It works with either beef or chicken broth. If you want it to taste like it came out of a box, you need to add a bouillon cube in addition to the can of broth. Or you can mix things up by adding veggies, cheese, or both. I recommend stirring grated cheese in at the end to avoid burning. Chicken, broccoli and cheddar works. So does chicken with spinach and parmesan.  Personally, I prefer the recipe as-is other than using beef broth instead of chicken. It goes great with steak.

I chose this recipe to accompany a very flavorful, marinated beef dish. I chose it specifically because of the mild flavors. However, I felt it needed, at the very least, salt and pepper. When simple seasoning was added to the final product, it was perfect. I'll make this again, but I'll definitely throw in the seasoning with the broth next time.

Love mixing the orzo with the rice -- so easy and so different!  I doubled the recipe but will use a little less onion next time. Also needs a bit of salt.

I'd have this every night if I could!  I served it with Slow Cooker Lemon Garlic Chicken also found on this site.  The next night I chopped the leftover chicken, added it and a little of the leftover sauce from the chicken into the rice - PERFECT!

other than doubling this recipe, I didn't change anything or amounts, but i did add some grated ramano cheese at the end.  I really liked this a lot.  wait, I guess I did change something..I used brown rice instead of white which increased the cooking time by another 25 mins. or so, but the taste was fantastic.  I will be making this again and can't wait to have left-overs for lunch!

For onions I used onions from the roast I cooked so they were already soft, for the broth I used the liquid from the roast (water, seasoning salt, miso, onion, rump roast). Otherwise, no changes. It outcome was amazing!!

This is a great base for developing your own style of rice pilaf.  This is good as is, but you can also add whatever else you might want to try.  This was quick and easy (and easy to remember).  I know I'll use it again.  Thanks!

Made as written and it complimented our main dish (pork chops) nicely. Daughter and I thought it was 5 star, son and husband thought 4.   May try reducing butter by half and add some fresh herbs to see if the guys give it a 5, but it is very good as is.

This is easy to make and has a mild but pleasant flavor. I didn't have orzo pasta so I broke up some angel hair pasta and that worked fine. I also added some toasted almonds. This pilaf goes well with any dish. I served it with baked cod.

Delicious!  I bumped it up to 3/4's c. orzo and 3/4's c. rice and 3 c. broth and made it in the rice cooker on white rice setting.  Tasted great!

I tried this recipe for the first time today. It was GOOD by its self but I did change it up some. I doubled it to make a meal out of it. I cooked it exactly as it says in the recipe, only difference is I added some salt as it was a little bland. As I said above I made a meal out of it by added 1 pound of cooked and seasoned ground turkey and 18oz jar of beef gravy at the end. It was terrific and made an easy dinner with a side.

Store bought or homemade chicken broth is typically not salty. This recipe needed salt, which I added. I also added chopped parsley at the end and a little lemon rind to brighten it up. If I had had some asparagus, I would have added that as well. Needs some color.

More proof that the simplest 
of recipes often produce a delicious surprise. 
There are no competing ingredients. I thought the onion might take over but it didn't. 
I think I will be making this a lot in the future.
Thanks so much for sharing your little gem

I have made this recipe many times - and I agree it can be a bit bland as written.  To spice it up I add oregano and basil.  My favorite things to add are also mushrooms (sautéed with onions) and at the end some frozen peas or kale or ...

Holy cow - cheap, easy, and yummy!!  For about $2.50 I can make this recipe 6-7 times.  Beats the box stuff hands down!  I made this dish to go with pork steak and country gravy with "mushroom and bacon green beans" from this site.  I wanted it to be a little blander to help balance out the plate and this had just enough flavor to pop but not cause conflict.  I doubled the recipe to be sure I had left overs and plan on adding some seasoned chicken and sauteed red and yellow peppers for a savory lunch tomorrow.  Thank you for sharing!

Made this as directed tonight. Most of us liked it (my picky eater being the only one who left it on her plate). I think next time I will add more garlic and some salt. Will also throw in some chopped fresh parsley right before serving to give it some color and flavor.

Doubled the recipe and used half the butter.  Used broken spaghetti noodles for the orzo.  Added a sprinkling of cilantro over the top.

A little bland for our tastes, but good if served with something with a lot of flavor.  Next time I'll add some extra spices.

YUM, my new favorite side dish.  I used Campbells chicken broth and it was a little too rich.  I would use my own broth next time.

The first time I made this, I used chicken broth.  It was good, but like other reviewers said, a little bland.  The next time I made it I used water and 3 tsp. of Better than Bouillon and it was much better.  Also like it with some fresh chopped parsley added before serving.  Make sure you brown that orzo...it makes a HUGE difference!!

I made this recipe for the family and they loved it.  I made a few changes and used veg stock rather than chicken and red onion rather than white (these were only because of personal preferences) and added a red pepper and lots more garlic.  Will definitely be recommending and using this recipe again.  :)

Very easy and tasty.  Like that it is an option that is lower is sodium without compromising flavor.  If you can't find orzo you can use angel hair, linguini, ect and break into small pieces.   I had to do this while out of town because the local store just wasn't as good as mine when it can to great products.

This was easy and received a make it again review from my husband & 9 year old picky eater daughter. I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I would make is adding the onion just before the orzo starts to brown to prevent the orzo from over browning or burning. Will definitely add it to our side dish rotation!

Easy and so delish!!! Browning the orzo or broken spaghetti is what gives this simple recipe it's deapth and richness. I follow this recipe up to the point of mixing in the rice and chicken broth and add it all to my rice cooker. I also add a tiny bit of cayenne pepper.

I just made this and it was very good.  There was nothing left, so maybe I'll double it next time.  The only change I made is I used Progresso Tuscany Broth.  I was worried that it would be overpowering, but it was all I had, and just hoped for the best.  The finished product was perfect and wouldn't make it any other way now!

Skip onion and garlic. Instead, add 1/2 cup  slightly toasted pine nuts after cooking pilaf. Broken vermicelli works great. Use 3-4 tablespoons butter. Add pasta and cook until butter just turns light brown and butter is very bubbly. Keep pasta moving while browning. As soon as pasta and butter browns a little, toss in rice to stop cooking. I use 1 C rice and 1/3 cup pasta.I always add  hot chicken broth. Use canned broth only. Pour in 2 C measuring cup, add enough water to make 2 cups , put in microwave for 2-3 minutes while slightly browning pasta. Browning pasta slightly really gives this a nutty flavor, so delicious. I have been making this for 40 years and have perfected it. Try it. Pine nuts optional, just makes pilaf  a little fancier. It is really important to never lift lid after starting your simmer. I cook exactly 22 minutes, turn off heat and let sit without lifting lid. Fluff and add pine nuts right before serving.

My family loved this recipe. I liked it because it doesn't have soy in it like Rice a Roni. The rice took only 15 minutes to cook. I would suggest watching it so it doesn't start sticking to the pot. I did add some parsley and used garlic powder because my daughter is expecting a baby and garlic cloves give her heartburn.

I couldn't believe this orzo and rice combination was as flavorful as it was with just butter, onion, garlic, and a can of chicken broth. I followed the recipe exactly. It was the perfect accompaniment for salmon.

This was delicious just as is. I wanted a bit more flavor, so after it was done, I added several personal favorite herbs and spices. I used homemade turkey stock instead of the broth, but that was the only change I made. I'll definitely make this again!

Sounded interesting with the orzo & rice combination, but I was disappointed.  Despite the onion, garlic & chicken broth it just lacked flavour.  I had to add seasoning & fortunately I'd doubled the sauce from the fish dish so it was edible.  I'm sorry, but I won't be making it again.

This an easy, make-ahead and freeze meal, especially if you add shredded or chunk chicken. I keep this in rectangular foil trays in my freezer, and when it's time to bake, I dump it into a glass dis and thaw in the microwave with 2 tbsp of water, and heat for a quick and easy side dish that makes it look like you went to an effort when you didn't. Keeper!

My husband did not care for this, but I loved it. Second time I made it I used beef broth instead of chicken and added some cumin. I loved it even more.

Just made to take for my dinner at work tonight and it is very good, didn't change a thing, followed recipe exactly, and I feel it has good flavor and doesn't need any more spices at all. Like that it is so simple and always have the ingredients in my pantry so I'm sure this will become one of my favorite last minute side dishes. Highly recommend, it is great for busy working moms.

OMG.. who knew? I had no idea you could make this from scratch and I LOVED IT! Was even surprised when I took the cover off that it looks exactly like Rice Pilaf! LOL I pretty much followed the directions exactly, I used 2 cups of hot water with 3 bullion cubes and I added about 1/2 tea of sea salt since others suggested it needed it. It was Great. The only thing I need to do differently next time is use onion powder instead of the onions and that's only because the kids noticed the onions in it and freaked out and barely ate it after that. So going forward I will just use the powder. I will NEVER buy Rice Pilaf again. This was super easy to make and tasted great! THANKS!

I made this today but I didn't have any white rice so I used Trader Joe's Basmati rice medley. It worked really well. I also added chopped almonds. It could have used a little more seasoning. Was delicious with chicken tenders with sea salt and ground pepper.So easy and quick and only had to use one skillet.This is a keeper!

I have made this many times but I just tweaked it a little.  I sauté the onion and garlic(a little extra too) briefly then add the orzo and the rice and sauté until everything is nice and brown, then I add the stock.  Taste the liquid before covering and add salt if needed.  I stir in a 1/2 cup or so of parm when it's done.  Easy and my kids even love it.

A very simple rice recipe that's quick and pleasing.  Hubby inhaled it and asked what all was in it that made it softer than regular rice (the orzo had him wondering about the texture).  I called it "butter rice" for my picky kiddos and they inhaled it too.

This is a great recipe but I felt like it was slightly under seasoned so I added a pinch of salt and some no salt seasoning with herbs. That definitely punched it up a little.  I think fresh thyme would be a great addition.  I also added some finely chopped carrot with the onion for added color and flavor.

This recipe is perfect with the measurements.  I will occasionally add bell pepper or frozen spinach to give it some color.  But the recipe stands good as is.

Very good simple side dish.  It has a good flavor.  Not overpowering.  It is comparable to rice-a-roni.  I'll keep this one for a quick side dish.

Wow this was really great!!! The only orzo I could find was whole wheat and I had to use vegetable broth to which I added 2 chicken boullion cubes. I don't usually care for rice pilaf but this was so very good!!! Thanks!

Very good recipe! I love rice pilaf but cringe at the sodium in Rice a Roni, even the reduced sodium stuff. We made this with one cup unsalted chicken stock, and one cup regular chicken stock. It ended up with less than half the sodium per serving as the reduced sodium Rice a Roni. 

We also added extra garlic (Yum!) and some Italian seasoning.

Delicious! I'm a dedicated rice lover and this dish won me over. Changes I made were to cut the butter in half, added a little olive oil to brown the orzo, only one garlic clove and the onion down to 1/4 cup. No more Rice-a-Roni for us!

This was great!  I just used 1 cup rice since I didn't have any orzo.  Perfect tenderness.  It was a little low on flavor so I added a sprinkle of McCormick's Grill Mates: Garlic & Onion and a dash of dried chives.  I served it with Parmesan crusted baked flounder and it went very well.

This rice turned out great!  The only reason why I rated it 4 instead of 5 is because it took a bit longer to cook than the recipe says.  Either way, it was delicious!!

LOVED it. Substituted 1/2 cup of the broth for white wine (just because). Didn't have orzo, so used a different small pasta. It was great, everyone loved it.

My husband and I are trying to eat non-processed foods and I'm a huge fan of Rice-a-Roni.  This is better and so easy.  I added a pinch of Tumeric and parsley and it was delicious.  My only question is:  why can't I get the rice to cook all the way through?  I've tried 3 times and it's always a little crunchy.  I even added 3 cups of chicken broth and it still was a little crunchy.

I wanted a simple side to serve with grilled Tuna steaks and this pilaf was perfect.  I used a combination of low-sodium chicken broth and chicken stock and jasmine rice, as that is what I had on hand, and garnished with fresh chives.  It was a huge hit with my husband and me and have already committed the recipe to memory, as I will be using it often.

I served this with Cordon Bleu to 12 guests, and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. So much better than rice pilaf from a box, and it was just as easy. I used Calrose (short grain) rice and orzo, and they looked nearly identical when cooked. Not that the appearance is that important; but next time I will use broken spaghetti noodles instead just for the contrasting textures (or orzo with long grain rice).

This recipe was awesome!  Combines well with so many veggies and proteins.  I made it with sauteed shrimp and steamed cauliflower and carrot medley.

Be sure to really brown up the orzo, the texture it creates when mixed with the rice is fantastic.

Too much of an onion flavor. I would definately decrease the amount I would add next time. Would be nice to have some color added for serving, such as parsely or something.

Not my favorite, and my husband wasn't crazy about it, either.  The combo of orzo and rice produced weird textures- too mushy for my taste in rice pilaf.  The flavor was fine, but didn't like the orzo in it. . .

I added slivered almonds (about half as much as the orzo) and some baby peas.  Turned out excellent. Only recommendation is to add some salt and pepper.

This is a great recipe.  my husband added a little salt and pepper to taste after a few bites to his serving.  But that's an easy fix for everyone's individual taste.   I will use this recipe again soon.

I actually followed the directions on this one and I'm glad I did! I was a little skeptical because it seemed like there were not many ingredients - but I was wrong! It was sooo good! I will definitely be making this again. (For the white rice I used long grain white. It was perfect.) Browning the orzo is definitely important.

Made this as per the recipe! Good basic pilaf recipe, but might need some seasoning depending on the butter & chicken broth. I used no salt since the butter & broth had it. I let the butter almost burn before I put the orzo in & it browned quickly. I am a fan of that almost burnt flavor. A little lemon juice would be good in this recipe too!

I didn't taste much flavor in this.  I even checked the recipe after dinner to make sure I did everything correctly.  Probably should have added more seasoning, but trying to fix three new dishes at once I wanted to stay close to the recipes.  I may try again.  Or I may buy Rice-A-Roni.

Delicious....My family loved it! The orzo made the dish. I didnt have any chicken stock so I used beef stock. I also added some green peppers as another person suggested. It was great and will become a regular side dish in our household.

This was just a plain average side dish, not too great.  I was out of orzo pasta, so used broken up spaghetti. It tasted just like the store bought rice that comes in a packet.  I wish I had thrown veggies, Italian seasoning and herbs in it to give it more flavour.

It's a good, basic side dish.  I used brown basmati rice but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  I'm happy to have this recipe and will use it when I've got the time or inclination to make something more healthful (SO much less sodium and gunk than Rice a Roni) than a boxed side dish during the week.  I could see that this recipe could benefit from creative seasonings or herbs (chives? thyme?) but I didn't bother and we were all happy with it as written.

Good base recipe, but it's needs some modification as it's bland. Next time I'll add more salt and herbs and try adding in some soy sauce (roughly 2 Tbsp).

This was wonderful! I used an extra tablespoon of butter and added a little seasoned salt and pepper, then at the end stirred in a bit of parmesan cheese. My friend and I ate it up and it was great the next day reheated! I thought it was very flavorful and a great complement to chicken breasts. Very easy to make (I'm not great in the kitchen and I didn't mess it up.) Highly recommended! Very versitile, you could adjust to your liking.

Found this to be very bland and the onion was overpowering.  Thankfully the chicken I served with it had a sauce to put over it to give it some flavor.

I'm sorry but we did not enjoy this as a side to our meal.   I used regular white long grain rice and found the cooking time to be off.  At 35 min of simmering, the rice was still not cooked all the way through.  At this point I added another half cup of broth which helped.  Sorry but I won't be making this again.

I made it with a bit of Pam and omitted the butter. Some thyme and cayenne pepper made the dish more interesting. A solid staple! I'll be making this over and over again.

Hubby and I are both rice pilaf lovers and this recipe is exactly what we were looking for.  I have made it many times and not changed a thing. We recently decided we wanted to cut down on our carb intake so I made it last night with brown rice and broken whole grain angel hair. The in result was just as tasty. Needless to say I had to make some adjustments because of the brown rice. I added about 1/2 cut more broth and cooked for 50 minutes.

Very yummy! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth because I am vegetarian, but followed the other directions completely. Turned out great!

Simple, quick & easy...but most of all very good. I made it according to the recipe and added about a half cup of frozen peas and one small carrot, finely minced...then chopped 4 scallions and threw in at the end. Much better than any boxed mix I have tried. Not to mention way cheaper. A keeper!

This was a good start to a great recipe. I did change it up a bit because I felt that a 50/50 ratio of rice to orzo was a bit much since orzo expands so much more. Basically I just increased everything but the orzo. (1 cup rice, 3 cups broth, added a tbs of olive oil) I also sauted the rice with the orzo. It turned out great but I think I'll play with some herbs next time I make this dish. Also, I had no garlic (very odd for my kitchen) but did have garlic butter (the real stuff, not the "spread") so I used that instead.

This pilaf turned out perfectly. I added shallots instead of onion. It can be easily customized with the addition of different veggies. Served alongside Onion Balsamic Chicken on this site; both recipes were delicious!

I reduced this recipe to 2 portion sizes and found the proportions of ingredients to exact. Instead of of chicken broth, I added a package of OXO chicken low-sodium version. I thought a little bit more color was needed and added about 1 T. of dried parsley, though fresh would have been nice too. My husband was a fan. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  The only change I'll make is to cut back on the amount of onion.  We really like onion but I thought the flavor was a bit overpowering compared to the garlic.  I've been looking for a homemade pilaf that was comparable to the Near East brand that I buy and this is pretty close.  Thanks!

I made this tonight alongside some grilled lambchops and it was ok.  The orzo had a strange, almost slimy consistency to it, but the flavor was fine, although nothing special.  It's a nice change from ordinary rice.

This recipe was very simple and came together well.  The measurements were perfect and it came out fluffy.  I added bell pepper and garlic with the onion as well as salt and pepper.  I also added chopped smoked almonds.  I served it with roasted garlic gravy.  I don't believe this would have had enough seasoning for me if I hadn't made the additions that I did.  All in all a very good side dish!

I loved the taste of this,  but because my teens just ok'd it, I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. I cooked as written, and maybe next time I will brown some slivered almonds to go with it, or add some pine nuts and see how that works.

This was just okay the first time I made it. Made it again today---Omitted garlic and onions, used them in powder form instead. Also used 1/2 C green bell pepper. Before covering and simmering, I added 2 Tbsp sun-dried tomato pesto and it gave this Pilaf an awesome flavor!!!

I made no changes and was VERY surprised at how flavorful it was.  I expected it would be bland, but it was just about perfect!

I hadn't defrosted any of my homemade broth so I used store-bought low-sodium and it was fine.  Never again will I use Rice-a-Roni!

With the leftovers I added leftover roasted chicken breast and made it a meal.

Made as written. So good. I usually make dishes calling for broth with my homemade but after reading reviews I decided to use the carton version of chicken stock (not broth) from the grocer. The salt level was perfect! Great side dish for chicken Florentine!! Super easy and tastes great.

This was excellent.  I added a 1/4 cup of diced carrots along with a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger and a 1/2 cup whole milk right after stirring in the rice. Will definitely make again.

It seemed a little bland but ok for a side dish instead of store bought stovetop rices!
Make note, must be made with white rice as brown rice takes too long to cook so the orzo was soggy.

This is absolutely amazing! The fiance loves it and I find myself eating it right out of the pot. I make the recipe exactly as stated. It does remind me greatly of Rice-a-Roni, but better with a homemade taste. 
I make this dish as often as I can!

Easy, healthy, delicious recipe. Made it exactly as written. As a time saver, I prepared ahead of time then reheated to serve along with a Mediterranean shrimp entree and green salad. Definitely will be making again. Thanks for this recipe!

I really liked the flavor. Easy to make. I like my pilaf heavier on the rice so doubled that and added additional liquid.

This was decent, even good. I did find that it took significantly more liquid than the recipe called for (about half as much or more) and because of having to continue to add more liquid it made up more like a risotto than a pilaf. The flavor was fine - a really good starting point for a side. My experience with pilaf is that you want something somewhat neutral - so I made S&P wings with lime and tossed a little lime juice into the broth, and seasoned with some cilantro to match my dish. But as far as "pilaf" goes, I think I may keep looking. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband is on a diet, which includes low salt. All of the rice mixes are loaded with sodium. I found this recipe and have made it several times. I do use low sodium chicken broth, but it is still delicious. Thanks, Sarah.

I made this vegan by using olive oil instead of butter, and a Not Beef broth cube dissolved into 2 cups of warm water for the broth. I grated the onion with a cheese grater and it dissolved nicely after cooking. I'll have to double it next time or cook for a shorter period of time because most of it stuck to the side of the pan.

I personally have never been a fan of rice pilaf, but my fiance sent me this recipe over the weekend and I decided to try to make it myself. Not only was this easy to follow, but it was very tasty and my fiance couldn't get enough! I will definitely be making this again.

As other reviewers have said, this really lacks any flavor.  The first time I made it, my family of 6 gave it 5 thumbs sideways and one thumb down (hence the mediocre star rating).  However, I felt it was just a wee bit off from something worthwhile, so I played with it a bit.  For a cook who needs to follow instructions exactly, this is not the recipe for you.  If you are more of a "recipes are outlines" kind of cook, this is great with a little tweaking.  Just throw in some additional bouillon, maybe some frozen peas & carrots, or fresh broccoli and it makes a yummy accompaniment to chicken dinners - approved by my crew from ages 5 to 50.

I loved this recipe, sooo yummy! I added chopped celery and carrots, and increased the white rice to 1 cup and the chicken broth to 3 cups (I kept the orzo at 1/2 cup). I really liked the rice-veggie proportions with those changes.

First time in my 42 years of cooking, for making homemade pilaf.  This came out great and my What's His Name loved it (yeah that is what his name is after 40 years of marriage).   I wanted something mellow to go with a very savory dish and this hit the spot.   One thing I like about this is that you can add the herbs/seasonings/veggies or even cheeses you like to your preference.  I do not measure, probably added more onion and garlic than called for.  I also only had chicken stock in the house and could only find whole wheat orzo at our local grocery store.  I am not rating this on my tweaks but the recipe itself.  A GOOD recipe allows others change it up and make it their own...which this one does!

HUGE hit. No changes made, recipe delicious as is. We talked about all the things you could add to customize---mushrooms, peas, etc but delicious as is. Will make again, often!

I used white long cooking (15min) rice in place off orzo and added salt and pepper to taste. I was out of plain chicken bouillion, so i used Knorr chicken tomato cubes and made 2 c by direction. Cooking time ended up being about 10 mins longer. Good flavor.

I usually use the "Orzo and Rice" recipe from this sight as a rice pilaf but wanted to try something a little more flavorful.  I only used 1 clove of garlic and it was still overwhelming (and I am a garlic lover!)  May try with half a clove next time, otherwise I'll probably just stick with the more basic "Orzo and Rice."

I made one batch of it and it was gone, so I had to go back and make another one because my mom loved it so much. I wouldn't and didn't change a thing with this recipe, perfect the way it is.

Oh my I hate it when someone rates a recipe then has sooooo many changes. However, after reading review after review it seemed clear the basic recipe was great. Thus, I followed the recipe, with many additions. Who knew orzo pasta could be incorporated into a Rice Pilaf? My additions were many: 1 minced carrot, 1/2 pepper diced,  1 tsp. of a Moroccan Spice,  1/2 tsp. Paprika. Added towards the end of cooking: Peas, Parsley, Raisins, Dried Dates (chopped) Dried Apricot (chopped), Olives (chopped) and toasted almonds topping at the end. Far different from the original, but I never would have gotten to it without Sarah. Delicious!

I have made this twice already. Best rice pilaf I have ever ate. Very easy to make and yes I followed the recipe exactly. It only needs 20 minutes to simmer on low and then sit for 5 min. Watch the browning of the orzo as it can be easy to burn. Definitely  in my rice side dish rotation.

Simple and delicious.  Sometimes the simplest foods are the best though!  I substituted vermicelli for the orzo.  Would be great with chopped herbs mixed in.

I didn’t have orzo pasta on hand, so substituted skinny egg noodles.  We enjoyed this side dish with baked chicken one night, and baked salmon the next.  It’s a keeper ... and very easy prep, as well.

Found this recipe when I was looking for something a little bit different than plain-old rice. I made it with vegetable stock and added a chopped carrot and celery when I added the onions. It turned out perfect, AND the family loved it. It’s a keeper!

So simple and so good! I make this almost every time I would make plain white rice. It’s not much more work than white rice and it goes with almost everything. I’ve even added some tomato soup to the chicken broth (kept it at 2 cups total) and it makes it like Spanish rice!

This is very good. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I did differently was add finely chopped celery and shredded carrots at the same time as the onions, and a bit of salt with the chicken broth. I think next time I’ll use just one garlic clove instead of two, and add mushrooms maybe. Two thumbs up!

I added a few twists to this recipe and served it as a main dish. It was received quite well by me and my guests. I followed the recipe exactly, using homemade broth. With four minutes to go,  I added shrimp and canned peas. I splash of fresh lemon juice and a dash of Tony Chacere's Cajun spice perked things up. It was very tasty with some crusty bread.

I've made this many times; it is my go-to pilaf recipe. Sometimes, I will add diced carrots or peas to get in more veggies. My bf requests it regularly!

Amazing! I added finely sliced carrot along with the onion, and then added a bay leaf while it was boiling and removed it before serving. Definitely saving this recipe, my whole family loves it!

I didn't have orzo, so I used 3/4 cup of arborio rice (Italian rice, white short grain). Followed the directions otherwise. VERY nice, mild flavor as written. I added even more flavor w/garlic and onion powder and Trader Joe's seasoning salt. Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly. I have made this for dinner parties quite frequently. It needs no additions. This is without question the best rice pilaf I have encountered. The sauteed orzo is the perfect addition. Brilliant recipe. Thank you!!!!

I made this using brown rice and vegetable stock. Next time, I will brown the rice first, increase the liquid 1/2 - 1 cup, and throw in more spices. Everyone liked it, even my son who said he initially didn't like it.

Made this for Christmas as a side for beef tenderloin. Perfect side and lacks more flavor than it would appear to. I did add chicken bouillon as recommended in the comments.

Had a great pork roast recipe with lots of flavor so looked for a pilaf recipe to go with it that wouldn't create a conflict with the flavors in the roast.  FANTASTIC.  Love the idea of the orzo, kind of reminded me of rice-a-roni but MUCH BETTER.  Easy to make and great to eat! Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make again!

Easy to make. Tasted pretty good, but something was missing for me, and the onions were a tad on the overwhelming side.

I usually can't get enough of rice/pasta combinations, but I wasn't really interested in seconds this time.

I make this dish at least once a month. My kids love this rice and always complain since the recipe doesn't make tons. I also use my own chicken soup broth which makes it that more flavorful.

I made this in the instant pot, but added the butter, onion and garlic first to season the pot. I also added finely chopped carrots and dried parsley with the orzo and then followed the recipe as it is (used 1:1.25 ratio for the rice/orzo to broth). It was a great dish but I felt it was just missing some extra flavor to give it a perfect 5 Stars. Can’t but my finger on what flavour would help.. will have to try again!

So, I wanted to use wild rice. Added 1/2 cup of wild rice to the initial toasting phase, increased the broth to 3 cups, and added 20 minutes to the cook time.

As is, I agree that something is missing. Its still good though. Because I used reduced sodium chicken broth, I added a boullion cube. Still, something was missing. I had made this as a side for baked chicken (which I had seasoned with Season All and Slap Ya Momma). I went ahead and added about 3 tbsp of the drippings from the chicken to the rice. The drippings added a great and unexpected flavor. It was definitely a hit. Even my son loved it (and he HATES anything but PLAIN WHITE RICE).

I have recently transplanted from Detroit to Colorado, and have been craving all the great Arabic food I left behind, including the rice pilaf served in every Arabic restaurant. 
By replacing half the butter with olive oil, this was exactly the recipe I was looking for!

I will definitely make this again and start experimenting with seasoning. I made it as listed, but with bouillon broth, not straight chicken broth. It was perfectly cooked but could use just a little more flavor. Very good base recipe, though!

Enjoyed this with a few additions.  After reading the comments that is was a bit bland, I added a handful of fresh chopped parsley, a 1/2 cup of finely shredded carrots and the juice and zest of 1/4 of a lemon after the cooking was complete.

Excellent recipe! It did need some seasoning, salt and pepper bit can be used at the eaters discretion. I made it in my Instant Pot. The rice and orzo was PERFECT!! Thank you for the recipe, Sarah!

The flavour was very good, but it could use something colourful to make it look a bit more interesting - maybe some colourful veggies or very thin slivers of red pepper
Would make this again.

My husband loves this! I always seem to need more liquid though, so probably 2.5 cups  would be better. After it’s cooked, I add a little feta and green onion on top to get extra flavor and it’s delicious !

Sarah's Rice Pilaf is FABULOUS! Looks exactly like and tastes exactly like Near East Rice Pilaf without all the salt!  Used Swanson's less salt Chicken Broth (all I had when I decided to make it).  Needed more salt.  Definitely use regular Chicken Broth.  I don't think salted butter and regular chicken broth will be too salty.  Certainly not as salty as Near East.

Thanks Sarah!  Love it!  Can't wait to make again

I increased the recipe to make 6 servings. Of course I was out of onion so I used half a leek cut up into small pieces. I used the same amount of rice and orzo (turns out 1 baggie of jasmine rice equals 3/4 cup of rice. When everything simmered I added soya beans (ca. 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup of corn). I also added salt and pepper and a little cayenne pepper and some onion powder . It turned out really well, everyone liked it and I am allowed to make it again lol

This what just what the doctor ordered.  Using homemade Chicken broth instead of store bought  allowed me to really control the salt and avoid the box brands with 3 to 4x the sodium.  My advice.  Start with you own stock and let people salt to taste at the table.

This made a great side dish!  My husband really liked it and it tasted similar to rice a roni.  The only thing I did differently was used brown rice instead of white, and I added the rice, orzo, and onions to saute and brown in the pan together.  Very good and had a nice flavor, nothing too heavy or overpowering, and made a great side item.  I liked the combination of rice and orzo pasta.  Thank you for the recipe!  I will be making again.

With the addition of salt  (and pepper) this is a very good recipe as written. Because I prefer a drier "restaurant style rice" I did the following.  Orzo takes approx 9 minutes to cook, rice 15-20 min depending on if you prefer it with a "bite/al dente".  I started sauteing the rice in 1.5T of the butter then added the finely chopped onion until tan in color. I then added the garlic (garlic would burn if threw in at beginning with rice and onion). Once slightly brown, I added the broth, cooked covered for 8 min then added the orzo which I browned separately in .5T butter. Cooked for 8 min covered then 1 min uncovered. Seasoned with salt and pepper added minced parsley.  Perfection for me.

The recipe as it was, I found a bit bland and simple. A few extra spices really jazzed it up! I added coriander, fresh parsley and cilantro, and some extra salt and pepper. I used jasmine rice, which is my absolute favorite, and I doubled the rice (1 cup rice to 1/2 cup orzo) which I think reflected traditional pilaf a little better.  I topped it with toasted slivered almonds. The coriander really brought it up to the next level!

I’ve made this a few times.  First time I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty tasteless. The next two times I experimented with fresh mushrooms and peas and added some extra garlic, salt and pepper and some chives.  It has potential if you play around with some other seasonings.

Very happy with this recipe. It was very easy and was a nice change from just your basic rice dish. I did add some chopped asparagus to add some additional color and flavor.

This recipe is always a big hit when I make it. It goes well with grilled chicken or a robust fish like salmon. I add chopped red and orange and green bell peppers when I add the garlic. It adds a splash of color and a subtle addition to the flavor. It turns out delicious!

This rice pilaf is delicious. reminds me of an expensive box brand that I like a lot, but I prefer homemade from scratch! Simple and easy recipe. I heat the orzo and the white rice together in the butter until the orzo is a golden brown and the rice is very white, then I add the onion, and continue with the recipe. Doesn't seem to make any difference and is very flavorful. Thanks for the tasty side dish!

Made as per recipe.  Tasty, easy to make alternative to plain old rice.  Only reason did not get 5 stars was taste was a tad bland but that was probably due to my chicken stock. I will make again.

I will never buy boxed rice pilaf again! Read several recipes and they were basically the same. I did not have orzo but I did have Israeli couscous and it worked perfectly! I’ll definitely always use the butter as it helps with the flavor and I don’t have to add anything to it after it’s cooked. Will print and put in my family recipe book and use weekly for sure!

Made as a side with chicken nuggets, along with a green salad with mandarin oranges, red onion, & advocado.  It was delicious. I only added some chopped green onion at the last moment to add some colour.  Will definitely make again.

This rice pilaf is simple, yet delicious.  My husband raved about it.  I made it exactly as written.  I think you could take it a step further by adding just a bit of parmesan cheese but, it was nice and creamy.  I pinned the recipe so I can make it again and again.  I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  How can I go wrong.  Thank you for an outstanding recipe!   I'm serving it today with my Swedish meatballs.  Yumm!!!

This is such an easy good side dish.  I did make a few adjustments after reading others say it was bland, I like lots of flavor.  I used my homemade vegetable broth, Italian seasoning, sweet paprika, slivered almonds, and topped it with fresh chopped parsley and chives.  Delicious!

While I didn’t have orzo pasta I did have stelline so I used it instead.  Maybe it was the different shape but the pasta did not get done in time and so I had to cook it a little longer. After that the recipe was fine and my kids really liked it. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it seemed a little too much like Ricearoni and I just am not a big fan of that.

Outstanding!! I usually make the same Rice Pilaf recipe that I had put together years ago and wanted a change. This was simple to make, delicious and appealing to the eye!
Thank You! This one is a keeper!!
I would like to add something to my review: I recently made this wonderful recipe again; but used whole wheat orzo and whole grain rice. It was still delicious!!

I've made this rice pilaf many times & my family loves it.  It's simple but delicious! I double the recipe but not the garlic as I don't want it to overwhelm the buttery flavor. I do use more butter & make sure that the orzo is all toasted which gives the rice a delicious, toasty, almost nutty, rich flavor. Make sure NOT to burn the garlic or the rice will be bitter! This is very similar to Rice-A-Roni but  SO much better without the extra sodium, sugar, preservatives, etc. We gave away our boxed rice mixes. This is a great recipe that is definitely a keeper!

This was a very nice recipe that worked well with my falafel dinner. I really toasted the orzo to get a good flavour from it. I also used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian. Next time I will cook the onion longer. I think it will improve the dish. Thanks for sharing.

Like other reviewers, my first impression was that based on ingredients, it may be bland. I was totally wrong. The only thing I did was triple the garlic because that is our “thing”. Oh yes, one more thing. After I turned off the heat I let it sit with the lid on for 20 minutes. The first time I did 5 and it wasn’t cooked thoroughly.

I used a mixed rice combination that consisted of red, brown and white rice which turned out great with following the rest of the directions and added ingredients.  Nice, Nice flavor.

No orzo on hand, no problem. I substituted orzo for broken up spaghetti, otherwise followed the recipe as written. Easy and excellent side dish.

Quick, easy and way better than out of the box! I did not have any orzo on hand so I just broke up some angel hair pasta. Other than that I made the recipe as written. My husband and kids raved! A keeper for sure.

One of my family's favorite side dishes.  If - like us - orzo pasta is tough to come by locally, you can use the trailerhood substitute (half inch long pieces of uncooked spaghetti..THANKS RICE-A-RONI!).
Much better with real Orzo, tho

I made it exactly to recipe and it was pretty bland.  At the end of cooking I added salt and pepper and broke in a chicken bullion, which greatly improved the flavor.  I would make it again with the addition of more herbs for flavor.

This was delicious, a different starch than plain rice or potatoes. I followed the directions as written. I agree with other readers the key is browning the pasta to a golden brown that gives a depth to the flavor. It's on my staple list now.

I've made this recipe many times, made it for the first time exactly as written. Learned that it definitely needed a little seasoning. I've since tweaked it a bit, adding salt, toasted, slivered almonds and approximately 1-1/2 Tbsp. chopped parsley. I use dried parsley, but fresh would work if you have it.

This is delicious and I loved it. However it needs a little color. All I did was put fresh chopped Italian parsley on it when it was done. Don't be tempted to add more garlic than what the recipe calls for because it would be too much. Further, next time I will use a little less liquid--perhaps 1 3/4 broth--because everything was soft enough before all the liquid was absorbed.

this rice recipe is one of our very favorites. I always make it the first time exactly as it's written and adjust to our tastes. The only thing I did with this was add a bit of chicken base to the chicken stock, just to give it a liitle more flavor. Definitely recommend this.

Made this recipe and had to substitute the orzo with angel hair pasta broken into bits. Added a little Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese for a bit more flavor and it was so good! Will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! I too had to use broken spaghetti and it still turned out amazing.  I added a pinch of crushed red chillies and a dash of tomato paste for an extra kick.  Next time I'll make it with Orso.

So, I've made this numerous times, with the only changes being to use chicken bouillon for more flavor, and it's always a big hit. Tonight however, in addition to the original recipe, I sautéed some zucchini and celery with the onion and garlic and also cubed and sautéed some chicken breast in a separate pan. I added those to my sautéed orzo and rice and broth and then cooked as usual. It was totally delish, and a nice way to make a side dish that I love into a main course.

This is a "go to" recipe for many main courses. I have made it numerous times and it has always been a hit. Make it "as is" or add a few extras to jazz it up such as spring peas, peas and carrots or green onions. If my vegetarian daughter-in-law is among my dinner guests, I substitute veggie broth for the chicken broth. Thank you for such a good, basic recipe!

I chopped up baby portobellos and added a little more garlic - yum!  We'll be having this dish weekly.

Very good, simple staple for a variety of meals. Lends itself to personal preference changes (extra garlic, added mushrooms, etc).

I made this recipe as written for my daughter's family in January and it was a big hit.  Made it to go with salmon cakes by chef John and my daughter and 2 grandsons just loved this rice dish.  Have made it many times since and will continue to use it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for a church dinner and it turned out perfect. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and recommend doing the same for anyone trying it for the first time. I received so many compliments on this dish. I'll be making  this often. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times and my family loves it.  I do cook the onions first (undercooked onions are a definite NO in our house) before browning the orzo.  After cooking, I typically throw in about 2 t. chopped parsley and top with shredded parmesan cheese to serve.  Delicious!

I added 1/2 tsp Thyme, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and 2 bay leaves while it simmered - these herbs really jazzed it up.  Without them its a little bland - but a great base to add anything you might like for flavor.

A pinch of dill went amazing with this. Added it when i added the broth. I have made this 2X each week for a few weeks now. Wife and 5yr old are crazy for it.

Very good.  I had to add salt, otherwise, it would have been bland.  I also took another reviewer's advice and added carrots and peas.   Will make again so I saved it to my collection of recipes.

I have made this recipe countless times. It is our very favorite rice pilaf and although I sometimes add sauteed mushrooms or other vegetables, it is really great exactly as written. I like to get the orzo good and brown - makes the dish more attractive and gives it a nutty flavor. Easy to make and well worth it.

I was looking to make rice but wanted something new and different. This dish is delicious. I substituted brown long-grain rice and added a cup of water after the chicken stock was at least ½ absorbed. Also, the cooking time needs to be increased to about 45 minutes, to allow for the longer cook time of the rice. I will most certainly be making this again... and again.

Good basic flavorful rice recipe. I didn't use orzo to avoid the gluten. But otherwise followed. I will do it again.

After discovering this recipe I have taken it to potlucks. Always enthusiastically received! Keeps in a slow cooker after being made on the stove. ( which is a great way to take a dish to someone's house and keeping it warm without using oven space). If you need to do something in advance this is a great go to dish. Added a little herbs de Provence and grated Parmesan.

Doubled the recipe in a huge lidded skillet. Used a whole diced sweet onion and added shredded carrot and mushroom pieces  when I added the onion (3/4 cup each x2 for double recipe) and followed others' advice to make sure I got a good tasty browning on the orzo. This was incredible and there were no leftovers of the double batch. Winner. Will make again.

I have made this recipe many times and my family can never get enough of it!  I have found that using chicken base gives it a much richer flavor because canned chicken broth is too dilute.  Also, adding parsley in the end gives it a nice peppery finish.  I truly love this recipe!  This is my go-to rice dish!

I did as instructed. However, I used chicken stock and brown rice instead. The brown rice Took a little longer to cook, so I put a half cup to 3/4 a cup more of the stock. I turned out pretty good. I also added bell peppers. The next time I will add the veggies towards the end, (say like 5-10so that the texture is firm and the flavor pops!

I made this for guests and it was a hit--I'll make it again. I was out of orzo so I used spaghetti that I broke in small pieces (read that suggestion is the reviews). It was good, but I think orzo would look better.

I must say......I was PLEASANTLY surprised at this very simple recipe.  For one of the first times in my LIFE, I followed a recipe to a "T."  I may spruce it up a little bit next time by adding a chicken bouillon cube in addition to the chicken broth to add even more flavor but for those who don't want all of that extra sodium, making this "as is" is just fine.

So simple and yet very flavourful.  A favourite in our household, requested for many times over by my husband.  I've now made it so many times that I no longer require the recipe.  The only change to the recipe for me is really the cooking time, I find I only require about 15 mins before the liquid is absorbed at a low simmer.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Perfect as written to compliment chicken that had a glaze . I would imagine if one used beef broth, it would go well with dark meat. Thanks for sharing!

Came out very mushy and rather bland. Made it again and used ¼C less broth, 5min less cooking time, and added salt & pepper and chopped fresh parsley. Ideal pilaf! Will make again and again with these changes.

Amazingly flavorful for such a low-key dish. It's perfect for pairing with a main dish that is intensely flavored or that you want to really showcase. I did toss in some chopped toasted cashews for crunch. Delicious.

I've made this a few times as written which was good.  But I made it again last night &  discovered I was out of orzo.  Ended up using 1/2 white rice & 1/2 jasmine rice...soooo delicious & that's the way I'm goning to make it from now on.

I have made this twice and love it.  I did find that I needed to saute the onion before I added the Orzo.  I added toasted pine nuts just as I served it and it was a nice addition.  Served with Chicken Kabobs tonight.  My husband is not a rice fan but really enjoys this.  Will try sometime with beef broth or vegetable broth for a change.  I won't bother with Rice-a-roni again - this is much better.

Really enjoyed this dish. Didn't change any ingredients. Cooked this in my rice cooker. Turned out perfect. Hubby wasn't so keen on the texture of the two different types together, so he will just have to miss out next time I make it lol.

I have made this recipe and I loved it! I added it to my weekly side dishes. This rice pilaf goes well with almost any dish and is very easy to make. I served it alongside of Salmon cakes and cauliflower. I didn't change a thing. Sorry Rice A Roni, your history.

Made the recipe as written but added one chicken bullion cube to pot.  A great basic recipe for a side dish, but needs something else to kick it up in flavor.  Next time will add some roasted veggies, like chopped asparagus or red bell pepper.

This has become my go-to rice side dish recipe. My one tip is to make sure you let the orzo brown well in the butter, it adds fantastic texture and taste to the rice. I use a tiny bit more onion and garlic then the recipe calls for. Also, after adding the chicken broth I like to add some black pepper and a bit of dried oregano. Delicious!

Made this for Easter dinner and it was well received by everyone! Just enough flavor, but not too much to turn the super sensitive (and young) tasters off. Will make again!

This was great. I made it for my dad's birthday with some souvlaki from this site.  He really, really liked it.  My whole family agreed that we should make this more often.  I even left the garlic out due to lack of time ,and it still came out wonderful.  The taste is great, and it's very filling.  I'd definitely recommend this to anybody.

I love this more than the box rice pilaf mixes.
I have done both with dried minced garlic/onion as well as fresh garlic/onions.  Both, were a hit but I would definitely use fresh.  I used the dried ingredients as that's what I had on hand at the time.   Also, I tried it with both prepared chicken broth (Full-Circle Organic Chicken Broth) as well as bouillon cubes.
I also use Jasmine Rice, as it has the fresh aromatic smell of rice. YUM!!!  So I made the recipe as is, no changes of adding additional seasonings or ingredients.
Minced Garlic/Onion-  It  added flavor without overwhelming on the garlic/onion taste.  Works perfectly fine.
Chicken Bouillon cubes-  1 cube to 1 cup of water.  I would drop these in after I pour in the water and get it to a boil..once it comes to a boil, reduce heat, pop a cover on and let it steam cook/simmer.  Before all the water is fully absorbed, I turn off the heat and just keep the lid on to avoid burning the rice on the bottom of the kettle.
I think the chicken bouillon option provides a more flavorful taste and just a hint of saltiness, just enough for taste but not overwhelming.   Definitely love the simplicity of this recipe.

I was so happy with this.  We love rice a roni's rice pilaf, but I know that the sodium and 'packaged food' aspect of it is not the best for my family and now that we are also feeding a 1 year old I'm really trying to get away from that.  I used low sodium chicken broth because that's what I had on hand, but followed everything else exactly.  I served it with baked chicken legs in onions and steamed asparagus.  Next time I think I will chop the asparagus into bite sized pieces and mix it in the rice 5-10 minutes before it's done.  Delicious!  We will never be making the boxed stuff again. :)

I've made this recipe several times the first time I followed the ingredients and directions to the T and it came out fine, a little bland so the next time I used  garlic salt with parsley, no onion, added a chicken bouillian cube and accidentally overcooked the orzo pasta, the third time i made it the same way as the second (without burning the orzo pasta) but replaced the butter with 1 tbsp olive oil, i loved it , a great side dish to my  steak or pork chops

Made some changes. It was good. I'd make it again.

I doubled the rice & orzo. I used 3.5 cups of chicken stock (bouillon cubes). I cut and added 2 carrots, and 2 asparagus spears. I used 1 whole white onion. I browned the rice, orzo, carrots, & onion. I added about 1-2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar to the chicken stock. I added maybe 2 tsps of celery seed. I may have added half a cupful of liquid smoke. 

I liked it with more veggies. I think it may have tasted even better if I had left the lid off for the last ~3-5 minutes of cooking.

Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVED this.  I used 2/3 long grain white rice and 1/3 orzo.  Instead of white onion, I used thin sliced scallions.  I also used homemade chicken stock which was full of flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy. I wanted a rice side dish to go with baked fish dinner. This fit the bill perfectly. I was planning to serve broccoli also, instead I precooked it and chopped it up and added to this dish. It was great.

Very delicious. I did substitute with brown rice to see the difference and it was still a hit. Great way to flavor brown rice too. My children even ate it. Will definitely make again

This was a good recipe. However,  it is a bit on the bland side so I would only make it as is if paired with a dish that I didn't want it to compete with. The subtle taste worked for me this time because I served it with a crab cake so I appreciated that it wasn't overpowering . I used 2 stalks of green onions instead of regular so that imparted a bit of flavor. Next time, I will add seasoned salt to give it a bit more umph. The directions were spot on, though.

I make this a lot, instead of plain rice.  I always use veggie broth instead of chicken, and it's still delicious.  It does need salt.

Yum. The first time I made it exactly as stated and really enjoyed it. Since then, I tweak the ingredients a little each time to match the flavor profile of my main dish. I've added mustard, sage, red peppers (not all at the same time) and each time it's still delicious. Another favorite is a little bit of fresh grated parmesan. To be clear, though, the recipe as stated is delicious, but one of my favorite things is its simplicity and ability to adapt to additional flavors.

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I did differently  was to add in 1/2 teaspoon of salt (which it definitely needed) and 1/2 teaspoon of dried parsley for some added color.  Otherwise I followed everything else and was very happy with how this turned out.  Even my 5-year-old who looked at it and then insisted she would not like it, ended up cleaning every bit of rice off of her plate.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Wonderful off the wall way to make this dish. Love the use of orzo for a change.  If there is one fault with this dish it is the time needed to prepare.   Worth though.

I have not made this but have a question.  I always bake my rice in the oven.  When I do, I always bring the liquid to a boil and add it to the rice, cover tightly with foil and bake in a 350 degree oven for about 35 minutes of so.  Could this be done the same way?  I have a problem with cooking rice on the top of the stove as it either burns or becomes gummy.  The most important thing is to make sure your liquid comes to a boil before adding to the rice.   The rice comes out perfect every time.  Sorry, but had to rate this in order to continue.

Great recipe, easy and but a little bland.  Brown that orzo really well and add 1 tsp. of ground turmeric for added flavor often used in rice pilaf, it also adds color and great health benefits.

I'd certainly make this again and have!   My 11 yr old grand daughter loves this recipe...and asks for it.   Even helps make it!  Still, with the chicken broth (thinking it salty enough) the recipe for our taste...needed a little salt.
Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!

I've made this dish for years and it never fails to satisfy.  I have made it with orzo (more authentic), but also use fideo pasta (common in Hispanic dishes), which is really just broken vermacelli pasta.  I brown the onions with the pasta (always use butter!  Can't substitute anything else without sacrificing flavor), and most often use Minute Rice because I work and getting the meal on the table before it's too late is important.  In that case, I bring the chicken broth to a boil and add the rice.  Cover, remove from the heat and fluff in 5 minutes.  Viola!!  I often double this recipe because it warms up beautifully and yes, it DOES make awesome fried rice the next day!

I've made this rice pilaf at least a dozen times now but each time I added to it to get a flavor punch. As written, it's a very mild flavor. I use 3-4 cloves of garlic, a whole medium sized onion, a squeeze of lemon juice, a few shakes of thyme (stirred into broth while boiling pre-simmer), and salt and pepper make this just right. My husband devours it!

I made a few changes since I didn't have orzo rice I browned a 1/2 of long grain rice. I then added browned rice,onions, and garlic plus 1 cup of rice to a 2 quart casserole dish. I stirred the rice so that it was all coated with the butter used to brown the rice. Added 3 cups of chicken broth covered tight and placed it in the oven at 350 for about 40 min so that my stove top was free to cook the rest of my dinner.  I served with Parmesan crusted chicken, broccoli, and white pepper gravy. I didn't have leftovers. ??

I added about 1/4 cup of crumbled bacon and about a teaspoon of salt and mild curry powder.  Probably could've gone with a bit more bacon though, maybe about six strips worth next time. Still, came out amazing, definitely adding this to my recipe book.

This is delicious. But I made it a Mexican style dish. I added 2 diced jalapeños along with the onion and I split the chicken broth and added half water half broth. And then I used a Mexican seasoning that come in small packets called "cubitos en polvo caldo de pollo" by The Goya brand.

No changes, was very tasty, have read the reviews and they have some interesting additions, like diced carrots, mushrooms, frozen peas, parmesan cheese. Almost everyone doubles the recipe so it must be good.

My family loved this dish! I made it exactly as the recipe called for the first time. The second time I browned the rice along with the orzo, and I added 1/2 tsp sweet basil, 1/2 tsp cardamom, and when it was finished, I sprinkled fresh parsley on top. I also think it would be great with sliced green onions on top. This dish is great!

This recipe gets a 5-star rating from this household! This was a quick and easy pilaf recipe that is just a little different with the orzo.  I also added some mushrooms to the skillet with the onions because I love them in my rice pilaf.

As many of the other reviews have stated this dish is fairly good but lacking... something. It tasted like it needed another spice. Perhaps parsley or thyme? I'll probably make this again and try adding something else to it and see if that makes it taste more "complete." My husband tends to like food that is, as he puts it, "bland and simple" and he thought the recipe was perfect as is. In the end if you like dishes with complex flavor profiles you will likely want to add at least one other seasoning. If you like dishes with a simple and subtle flavor this dish will likely delight.

This came out really good, an excellent basic rice pilaf recipe.  It was perfect for my kids because they don't like anything too spicy or with too many different seasonings.  My husband and I just had to add a bit of salt and pepper at the table and it was spot on!  Thanks for the recipe!  Will make again for sure.

Loved this recipe, even my picky husband who rarely comments on the food loved it also.  I added some toasted almond slivers but it would have been just as delicious without them.  Will make again!

I have found this to be a great recipe with great flavor. With that said, I have been disappointed with the rice not being cooked enough. I have tried adding more water and then cooking it longer, but the rice gets mushy on the outside and then still not done on the inside. So I changed things tonight with a better result. I browned the orzo, onion, and garlic in the butter in a sauce pan. When it was brown I added 2 cups of chicken stock. I brought it to a boil and added 2 cups of instant rice! I stirred in the rice and put a lid on the pot and took it off the heat. 10 minutes later I had perfect rice. The instant rice made all the difference! I had the same great flavor and the rice was cooked through.

Like others have said - this is soooo much better than the boxed rice with flavorings. It's super - no preservatives!  You can add small portions of other vegetables also!!   This is great - Thanks for sharing.  I did use 2 chicken bullion cubes as I didn't have broth in the house.

Husband kept interrupting himself at the dinner table to say how good this was. It's not incredibly unique, but it is a simple, flavorful, universally pleasing side that would go with just about anything. Sure to become a regular at our house!

Definitely a keeper! I made it just as it was written. Next time I will add a little salt and parsley. Great alternative to rice-a-roni, which my husband cannot eat as it is loaded with MSG. My picky kids loved it, too!

Great recipe.  After cooking. I added freshly ground pepper and  a few dashes of  salt   I used low- sodium chicken broth so it needed some  salt - not much.  I also stirred in some sautéed mushrooms - delicious!   Slivered almonds and fresh herbs  are additions I will try next time.

Had something similar, today, while visiting friends, from India.  Vermicelli, browned in oil and butter.  Added about 1 T grated ginger and a couple of slit green chilis.  I believe these two ingredients, added to this basic recipe would create a wonderful taste-experience.

I made the orzo in a pan, but finished the dish in my rice cooker (otherwise I would probably have burned it like I do to all rice dishes).  It was excellent, and my guest raved about it!

Thought it was just right!  I followed exactly and found it to have the perfect flavor to compliment the rest of the meal.  I made blackened mahi-mahi, along with this dish and broccoli soup (all recipes from this site) and I have to say that I feel this was a meal that all dishes complimented each other...perfect blend!  To add, my daughter simply loves orzo & rice and thought it was a treat having them together!  Definite keeper! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was delicious! I made it my own by adding some frozen peas and shredded carrots. I also added a pinch of salt for a little more flavor.

Delicious!!! I didn't have orzo pasta, so I just used thin spaghetti and it worked out great.  I also have  a pampered chef rice cooker, so here's how I prepared this.  I melted the butter in my sauce pan and browned the spaghetti added the onion.  After they sauted a bit I poured whole pan into the rice cooker, added all the other ingredients and put in microwave for 5 mins at 100% cook.  Then 20 mins at 50% and it turned out WONDERFUL.  Was great as leftovers the next day too!!!  Hubby said it did taste like the rice a roni, so I don't plan to ever buy that again for sure!!

Using good flavorful olive oil instead of butter, more onion and brown rice instead of orzo, this needed additional seasoning. A little bland.

I made this with chicken cordon bleu. It was a mild flavor to me. I used it under my chicken and drizzled sauce over both rice and chicken and it was very good with the added kick.

I am impressed. This was super delicious. I made it to go with a rosemary chicken recipe from here, which was supposed to be the 'star' of the meal but turns out, everyone likes the rice more, including my 5 year old who doesn't eat anything. She asked me to make it every night. I just didn't add onion, as I didn't have any, and used garlic powder (about 2Tbsp) in place of the minced garlic, as I was out of it. I made my chicken broth using water and 'Better Than Bullion' (and also added a tsp of it to the pasta while I was cooking that). Also, I didn't have orzo so I used broken vermacelli in its place. I like to have either pasta or rice with mostly every meal and I think I found my go-to rice. I'd like to try it next time using beef broth instead of chicken. Absolutely delicious!!

This is a great pilaf recipe, because pilaf is supposed to be simple with subtle flavors. Perfect when something else on the plate is very bold. We served this with Blackened Fish from this site, and the combination is great.
I do think I will add chopped walnuts next time though.

Very moist. In mine, the chicken flavor, though, seemed to take over. I would try doing half water and half broth the next time. Did add a little parsley and chives, but I think it needs something else, like garlic or onion powder for more flavor. Thanks for the recipe serenamoon.

I thought the ingredient list was very basic and was worried it wouldn't pack a punch. Boy was I wrong! This is delicious! My whole family including my 2 fussy eaters ate the whole thing. We paired it with the Salmon Tango recipe and it was perfect! We will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is a great base recipe. The liquid to orzo/rice ratio is perfect. Nice and creamy. As is, it is rather bland and that's why I gave it 3 stars. Second time, I prepared with half the onions. I carmelized the rest of the onions with mushrooms in another pan and added them in at the end. Finished wit a ittle parsley, black pepper and a shake of salt.

I added toasted, slivered almonds.  I have also added seasoning, depending on the main dish. This last time I added saffron, mustard powder, onions and garlic with the almonds.

This is a good, plain, base recipe to avoid "the box".  We liked it, but I plan to add more spices for flavor next time. It could easily be adapted to the theme of your meal by customizing your spices. Browning the orzo definitely adds an additional flavor layer.

A little too heavy on the onion, it overpowered the rest of the dish.  I'll cut it back to 1/3 of a cup next time. A little bit of lemon juice would help too.

This is amazing. Full of flavor, and oh! So easy. I doubled everything, but when it came to the broth, I measured 2 cans of Campbell's (the ONLY one to use!) chicken broth and the rest water to get the right amount of broth. I also added 1 bouillon cube to the water.
Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Love the idea of combining rice and pasta!  Next time, I will add some skillet blackened garlic shrimp ...other ideas I have are adding mushrooms, shallots.....there is so much that can be done with this and I found it to be a good basic starter, so thanks Sarah.....thanks a lot!

Very good - no doubt I will make this again - excellent side dish - I made this dish as written and for a dash of color I added fresh green pepper -  loved it - tonight's leftover rice will become tomorrow's fried rice - and poof it's all gone!

This is a popular recipe in my house, as written and in our other versions of it.  This is the kind of recipe that you can easily make your own with the addition of spices/herbs you like.  I add diced tomatos and a bit of taco seasoning sometimes.. Garlic Basil and italian seasoning in others... try it with bulgur wheat... oh my! soooo good.  the opportunities here are endless. I also find, that if I'm serving a very spicy meat .. say Hot cajun crab cakes.. then a milder side is soooo necessary.  This is a perfect base recipe! Thanks for posting!!!!

I make this so frequently that it's practically second nature at this point. The first time I told my boyfriend we were having this with dinner, he wasn't all that enthused. After eating it for the first time, he's totally hooked. This is a great recipe as-is, but it's also very flexible. This is a great recipe to use leftover or excess veggies in, I routinely get rid of excess mushrooms and green onions this way. Adding some parsley or oregano is good too. AND you can add leftover meats in the last few minutes of cooking to make it a meal, and add some variety to your leftovers. Great multi-purpose recipe.

Wonderful and easy. I made it with jasmine rice and I don't think it needed to cook the whole 25 minutes. Also it seemed like it may be a little too much garlic but it tasted great! I may cut down the garlic a bit next time. Thanks!!

Delicious! Worth the extra effort! The flavor is outstanding compared to the box! Plus the extra effort is minimal. This is the second time I've made this and it's definitely a keeper!

Better than a box, but needs a little more flavor. Fantastic base to expand on.

Awesome side dish!  I used whole wheat orzo and one tablespoon of butter.  The garlic was a little strong, which is fine for me, but may not be for others.  I also added 3 oz of fresh spinach at the end of cooking - stir it in and it wilts on its own.

Another 5*! Very delicious and easy! I even cut down on the butter and it still was perfect. I used Knorr chicken bouillon to make the broth which made it very flavorful. I live at a semi-high elevation so water proportions and time to cook will have to be worked on.

Have been looking for this little more healthier version of Rice o Roni. My family absolutely gobbled it up like no tomorrow. I did use brown rice instead of white. Also cooked the brown rice a little before hand to give it a head start (as it takes a bit longer to cook then white).  It was amazing and this will be my go-to rice recipe from now on!  Thank you for sharing.

I was looking for a Rice Pilaf recipe to go with the San Francisco Chicken and come across this recipe.  First things first, I should mention that I hate rice.  I have never really liked it, but San Francisco Chicken isn't San Fran Chicken without the rice pilaf.  I tested this recipe out tonight, going by the directions, only using a little bit of garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  This dish is delicious and has the approval of two non-rice eaters.

The texture was good, but the garlic was overwhelming to us. I think I'll either reduce it considerably or just use some garlic powder. It needs a little more of other types of seasoning.

As written, this recipe is very very bland.  Added some much needed S&P, and that helped quite a bit - but still not a very exciting side dish.  Will not be making again.

Pleasantly surprised, had a mild but full flavor.  I only added some almonds and parsley for crunch and appearance. I will never make box'd again unless I am in a hurry.

This recipe is great!  I added one extra clove of garlic just because we love it.  I don't know what the reviewers who called this bland and boring were talking about!  It's rice pilaf, it's supposed to be a yummy, low key side and this is the greatest recipe!  I can see it being good with some scallions tossed in. Might try that next time.

This came out beautiful!  I added probably 1 1/2 the amount of onions and also sauteed the rice when I added that to cover each kernel with the butter.  At the end when the rice was almost done I added about a tablespoon or more of scallions and about a tablespoon of chopped parsley.  When I added the garlic instead of just chopping it, I chopped it then pasted it so there wouldn't be chunks it the final product. It was full of flavor and I will definitely make this lots more.

For me to actually sit down and fully write a review has to say something!  I am a full time college student with a job and this has easily a staple in my house.  It is super simple and tastes fantastic!  The only recommendation I could make would be: adjust liquids based on your elevation, I live above the mile high mark and needed to add almost a cup and a half more liquid(I also didn't have a lid that sealed-who has time for that?).  This recipe is fail safe AS LONG as you watch your orzo, I wait until it is just about where I want it, add my onions and garlic and REMOVE from the stove to stir them in, the first time I left it on the stove and ended up almost burning the orzo. It still tasted fantastic!!

This was a terrific recipe made as is.  I doubled it because it only said 4 servings, but it seems like it serves more.  It is an awesome side dish that I WILL make again.

I was very happy with this recipe. I used Minute rice, "ready in 5 minutes" and that seemed to work great! You just have to keep an eye on it

This was easy and tasted good.  Bonus: I had all the ingredients on hand.  Went well with recipe "Pork Chops a la Slow Cooker" from this site.

A deliciously healthy and back-to-the-basics rice recipe.  Some call it bland, but that is because we are so ingrained with "flavors."  This is a top-notch rice recipe.  Followed perfectly and everyone loved it!

My husband said this it definitely a keeper recipe. The only thing I added was some fresh red bell pepper from the garden. Served with baked flounder and asparagus. Awesome dinner! Hubby loved it but said this pilaf is what made it!

This was just what I was looking for.  The only change I made was to add a sprinkle of saffron when I addded the broth, then a couple of tablespoons of white wine because my mixture was a bit dry.  I completed it with some fresh parsley and my family said it was the best rice I had ever made.  Served it with Tilapia, which was perfect.  Thanks Sarah!

This is definately better than the store-bought, box version although it is a bit bland.  I was looking for something mild to serve with cajun grilled catfish and this was a good side dish.  It does need something but I'm not sure what. . .  I will make this again, perhaps adding some spices (a pinch of Bell's seasoning maybe).
UPDATE:  I made this again and realized the recipe doesn't call for salt!  I added 1/2 tsp. and it was much tastier.

This is a good base recipe but much too bland.  I also felt it was too greasy.  I will make it again, but cut the butter in half and add some spices.  I liked the fact that it has much less sodium than Rice-A-Roni, but it just didn't have any flavor so I will correct that next time around.

I think this dish was very good. I substituted acini di pepe for the orzo pasta, and I added a little garlic salt, onion powder, and parsley for a bit more taste. It turned out great, and it goes very well with baked chicken.

Love this recipe.  My family does and guests always do to.  Only change I made because I was out of regular onion was to use green onions.  Now we prefer it that way.  Such a great alternative to using an expensive box with crappy additives.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This rice pilaf was a really simple side dish.  I didn't want a competing side dish and the toned down flavor of the rice was perfect for that.  I did add some salt and pepper to my dish but only because I use sodium free broth.

I agree with many of the previous reviews. This is a good basic recipe, but needs a little tweeking because it comes out a bit bland. I will definitely make this again, but next time I'll add either garlic salt or parmesan cheese unless anybody else can tell me another way to add more flavor with less salt.

I didn't put any onion or garlic in this, b/c I was making this for my daughter's dinner, and I wanted her to eat without complaining about "gross onions". I did add about a tsp. of Better than Boullion, and it tasted ok. I can't wait to try this with onions and garlic and maybe some other seasons, because I think it would be awesome! Way better than a box rice!
