Excited to try this today.  I got hung up at work and didn't get home to turn off the slow cooker until after the poor pork had been in  it's hot tub for more than 6 hours!  Flavor was exactly what I thought it would be... call it American Asian Fusion. Served with brown rice and roasted asparagus with parmesan. Very nice! My pork was over cooked ... yours won't be if you follow the instructions.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I know what it can be...  and really not a bad 3 stars personally because of my impossible work schedule.

This recipe has great flavor with just a touch of heat.  I used bonelss pork chops and they came out super tender.  Very easy to put together.  I used fresh garlic and shallots instead of dried.

This was not good. The pork was tough and there was too much liquid. Such a waste of ingredients!

My husband and I loved this! I was afraid it would be too spicy for me but it wasn't. Will make this one again.

Made it like recipe, except I had sesame ginger teriyaki sauce here. It was pretty spicy by the time I added that and the other gender. I also had some veggies to use up so I threw in a lot of onion instead of dried scallion, a few chunks of red and green bell pepper, and a pile of carrots I steamed on top for the last two hours. I Telya, it was delicious I saved two portions for lunch I made one portion for myself. I only used three porkchops but I made the full amount of sauce and poured it all over quinoa. Highly recommended, the chili sauce is a great touch.

This is a keeper!! No changes to recipe except used fresh garlic and onion powder for the shallots because it was what I had on hand. I did play with the cooking time. I first seared my inch chops for 4 minutes on each side (though this could be skipped, but I was trying to speed up dinner). I then cooked on high for an hour and on low for 2 hours. Came out fork tender. Add a little sauce on top of chops and served over white rice with chopped green onion as a garnish. I did use some additional sriracha 'cause I like it hot. A-1 recipe.

Great recipe. I changed it a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients, white sugar, no shallots and minced garlic. I also used ginger from a tube of minced. It was wonderful. We had two big bone in chops that I expected to do two meals, there was very little left! Will make again.

Very good. Next time I'll add more Sriacha or pepper flakes, though (personal taste).

followed the recipe ingredients wise exactly.  I cooked on low for 4 hours rather than high for 1 and low for 3 due to the fact I wasn't going to be home. I put them in frozen too. internal temp of the chops after cooking was 170°f. internal temp should be about 140. Maybe my chops weren't thick enough, oor my cooler is running hot. Taste was good,  texture not so much.

Mine came out overdone as well. It only took about 1 1/2 hours I think, but I gave it the full time. Might be the thickness variances in pork chops or age of the crockpot. Flavor was still good.

This recipe does have a very nice flavor. I also used fresh ginger but less salt since the teriyaki sauce was salty. I served it with mashed potatoes and a nice salad. Yum!
