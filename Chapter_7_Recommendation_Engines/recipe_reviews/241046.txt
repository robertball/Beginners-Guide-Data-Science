These are good but I don't know why the baking dish needed to be lined with foil - maybe because of crumbliness or maybe they would stick to the dish otherwise?  I added 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum to assure that they didn't crumble and they were nice and chewy.  Next time I'll try them without the foil and report back.

The taste was delicious but I found them impossible to cut and get out in a neat fashion. They stuck to the baking paper so that a lot of them was lost unless removing with a spoon. None the less the taste was nice and they were super fudgey. Don't know how to fix this conundrum without adding flour which kind of defeats the point.

Fudge brownies!  Tastes great.  I cooked it 45 min because of the toothpick test but I think it could have used some more baking time.  The top was crunchy but the bottom was sticky.
