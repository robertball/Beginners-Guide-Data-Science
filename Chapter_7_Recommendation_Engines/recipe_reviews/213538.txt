This was easy, it tasted good and my husband loved it. It's probably not as healthy as it looks- the stuffing mix with the soup made it pretty salty- but I'd make it again except I'd probably make my own stuffing or find a cheese and broccoli soup that has less sodium ..?

Exteremely easy to make...you can't really go wrong with chicken stuffing and cheesy soup.  I couldn't find the suggested Pepperidge Farm Herb seasoned stuffing so I used regular Stovetop chicken flavor.  Also couldn't find brocolli and cheese soup, so I used half a can of Cheddar soup and half a can of Cream of brocolli and I used fresh brocolli instead of the frozen stuff.  Turned out really good.

I followed the suggestion and added an extra can of soup per 6 servings.  I used skinless chicken tenders vs the breast and it was prepared for 12 - a huge success.

I used 16oz. package of broccoli per six servings as well (from bulk food purchase = Costco (big pieces of broccoli) delicious!  ncanada, MI

I made this last night and I have to say - the seasoned stuffing went completely to waste. The chicken turned out very tender and had a great taste to it. However, the stuffing tasted awful. We are not big fans of box stuffing, but thought maybe the Pepperidge Farm would taste better than stove top - it tasted the exact same. I did add 1 extra can of broccoli cheese soup and happy that I did - it definitely gave the chicken a nice flavor. I wouldn't mind trying this recipe again, but next time I will be using rice in place of the stuffing. This is a quick and easy recipe and the chicken literally falls apart with a fork. Great starter recipe, but definitely needs to be altered to the persons taste and preference!!

This was a delicious and easy recipe.  My family really enjoyed it.  We're trying to eat less meat, so we cut the amount of chicken in half and loaded more broccoli into the dish.  I also used a low fat broccoli cream soup instead of the broccoli cheese soup because that's what I had on hand and it was still good.

This recipe was a huge hit at my house! Especially if you are a StoveTop lover like me! Which I used in place of the PepFarm, I also used about 2 cups of fresh broccoli instead of frozen. 3/4 cup of chicken broth instead of water, and a whole can of milk instead of 1/3. I seasoned my chicken several hours before hand with garlic powder, pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper. I also added 10mins to the cook time, the chicken was moist, and crunchy on top. The broccoli and stuffing were soft, fluffy and VERY flavorful! This recipe will deff be a staple in my household from now on!

I think it's a good start but needs some tweaking to get to 5 stars.  Too much chicken for the amount of other stuff you have.  I guess if you were serving this as a main dish with other sides it would work but I was hoping for a one dish meal so it's too much chicken.  Next time I think I'll use 1/2 the amount of chicken, double the soup/milk mix, and double the broccoli. I think it also needs pepper.  I liked that it used raw chicken to save that step, unlike many other similar recipes.  I will make again, but just add these changes to get the ratios to make a 1 dish meal.

I wouldn't even give this a star if I didn't have to. I'm sorry but this just wasn't good. There was WAY too much stuffing...the broccoli just wasn't good, maybe use a different way fresh or steamed I don't know. It just wasn't good.

I used a 14 oz bag of Frozen Tuscan Seasoned Broccoli (thawed 2 min in Microwave & cut up with shears) and 3 whole breast with Cream of Chicken Soup and 1/2c milk and it was delicious. Used stove top stuffing mix. Baked in 9X13dish; 20 min covered and 20 min uncovered until the internal temperature of the chicken reached 165*F. Probably less time for half breast.

This original recipe was the first time I ever thought of adding broccoli and cheese to a stuffing for thanksgiving. Since then, Ive made quite a few alterations, adding a lot more meat and actually mixing the meat into the recipe and ending up with more of a "loaf". Adding stuffing cubes mitigates the strong sage flavors inherent in boxed stuffing mixes, and can add your own sage and other seasonings. I add Almond Accents slivered almonds, craisins, ground turkey, and top with buttered garlic crustinis insrted into the stuffing mix like "shingles" and pour melted butter and grated cheese over the top of that and it bubbles up golden brown and gourmet!!
