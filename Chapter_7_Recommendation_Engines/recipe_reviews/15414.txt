This is outstanding! I made it with an oreo crust, otherwise made it as directed, except - I didn't have heavy whipping cream - I just used cool whip - and it turned out perfectly....I added slivered almonds to the top - My dad loved it (birthday "cake") and I did not think the amaretto was overwhelming at all.   I do want to note tho - it says 1 (5oz) can evaporated milk - I ALMOST didn't catch that - the cans I buy are 12 oz - I was pouring a little in at a time and then noticed - so I think I got about 6 oz in - so that may be why some people's didn't set up correctly....  I'm going to try this recipe later this week using pumpkin for thanksgiving....

I've had this same recipe for years!  People ask me to make it for their special occasions.  You can substitute any liqueur that you prefer, such as creme de cacao (with this I've added shaved chocolate to the top).  Or, use a fruit liqueur and top with fresh berries.

I must have done something wrong, because this cheesecake wouldn't set up for me.

I tried this cheesecake out on friends and they all loved it.  Don't worry if it seems thin when pouring it into the crust.  It sets up very nicely.  I would definitely make this again!

I don't like cheesecake, so I didn't have a piece, but everyone seemed to like it.  I used a simpler crust recipe that had less butter in it:  1 cup graham cracker crumbs + 3 Tbl sugar + 3 Tbl butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

The amaretto was too strong.  Since no one else in the house would eat it I had too much and this further reduced my opinion of it.

This was ok but I was expecting more amaretto taste to this,what I got was a plain tasting cheesecake.

I didn't serve it to my daughter because it contains uncooked alcohol, but it was a smashing success with the friends who tried it and my husband and I loved it!

This is a fantastic no bake cheesecake. Leave out the amaretto with no problem. 
Be super mindful the evaporated milk is only 5 oz. I'm sure I'll be making this one ALL THE TIME.

Very nice recipe, added some cashew nuts, cinnamon and spices to biscuit and it turned out well..Used Cointreau instead and baileys to make swirls on top..
