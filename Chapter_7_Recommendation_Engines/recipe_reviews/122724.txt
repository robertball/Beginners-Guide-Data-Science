This was really good and juicy!  I used Chipotle Chile Powder instead of regular for more heat and a little smokiness and I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before throwing them on the grill. I can't wait to make it again!
Edited to add that I often make extra chicken and sauce to use later in the week on BBQ chicken pizza.  Just add cheddar cheese, turkey bacon and your other favorite ingredients.  Mmm....

Amazing!  I normally don't like bbq flavor, but this was soooooo good!  I added a few ingredients for personal appeal - soy sauce, red wine and onion sauce.  When I barbecued the chicken I seared the chicken first then applied the sauce.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Very good! I skipped the butter stage and used honey rather than molasses. They came out just great!

Loved this recipe....the only change that I made was to use honey in place of the molasses(didn't have any). Other than that, it was an excellent BBQ sauce. Will be making again soon, family loved it. Marinated the chicken for 24 hours in the sauce and grilled. Very yummy! Thanks!

This sauce was so much tastier than the bottled stuff you buy!  It is worth the little extra time to prepare it fresh.  I've always had a hard time keeping chicken moist on the grill.  I think now the trick is the melted butter.  This was moist and juicy and delicious.

My 3-year-old daughter ate every bite of her chicken. What other five-star criteria is there? Even my husband, who on general principle doesn't like chicken, said this was "pretty good." The chili powder is the special ingredient that gives the sauce its distinctive kick. I made this with chicken breast tenderloins and broiled them in the oven rather than grilling them (it's wintertime).

This turned out okay but the BBQ sauce definitely didn't have the zing/kick we normally like for BBQ sauce.

This recipe was the best barbecue chicken....I'll never use premade sauce again.  I was out of brown sugar, and substituted maple syrup.  Cooked on lowest heat setting on grill.  Took about an hour.  The butter actually really works well.  I wouldn't omit it.

This sauce looked great, but I didn't want to grill. I combined the sauce ingredients (omitting the butter) in a frying pan and brought them to a boil, the added 1/2 cup water to make a thinner sauce. I cut the chicken breasts into chunks and added them to the sauce. I cooked about 10 minutes, until chicken was done. I served it over rice and my family loved it!

YUM YUM YUM. This was exactly what I was looking for, a fast easy recipe that didn't require a marinade or standing time and a homemade sauce recipe that used basic everyday ingredients. I wish I had doubled the sauce as there was only enough to baste the chicken with while cooking. I sprinkled the chicken with some homemade season all and melted butter before cooking. I'm not sure how much chicken 1.5 lbs is, I used 4 boneless skinless breasts. Thanks this was just like my dad used to make and barbecue was his specialty. He made his own sauce too. This wasn't Daddy's sauce, but it was darned good and I'll make this again.

My grill was  broken, so I decided to bake the chicken  instead.I doubled the sauce recipe, added garlic powder because I love garlic but I skipped the butter(not needed). Baked at 400F for 45 min basting occaisionally. Tasted great. Will make again
