I used white chocolate chips for the recipe and melted the butter and chips in the microwave at 40% power for about 4 minutes.  I had to use the mixer to combine the chips and butter and it immediately turned into a creamy ganache.  Because we are true white chocolate lovers, I used the rest of the white chips in the batter istead of the semi sweet chips.  This is the best blonde brownie recipe I have tried!

Yum!  It's like a super moist, dense, rich chocolate chip cookie in a bar.  In a pinch, I used Toll House White Chocolate chips (yes, the one from the store) and honestly folks, it turned out just as good.  I did follow the advice of one post and microwaved the chips and butter in a glass bowl at 40% power - around 4 1/2 min.  I whisked it half way through.  I've also used quality white chocolate chunks and I really couldn't tell a difference, other than the fact that it was easier to melt due to a higher fat content. Either way, it was the same taste and goodness.  25 min. bake time was also right on.  I used a ceramic baking dish, (i.e., 2 1/2 quart square casserole dish), so the edges and bottom didn't burn.  Don't use a dark pan for this, or else these will get too brown.  I suggest porcelain or glass dish.

I agree with others who thought the texture on these was "off," almost "doughy," or "like an undercooked chocolate chip cookie."  But that's completely understandable, given that there's half a pound of white chocolate alone in this small pan! (Not to mention the cup of chocolate chips!) And those who tried to compensate by overbaking these to a "biscuit" are not accounting for this unavoidability. I guess I'd call it more "fudgey" rather than brownie-like. It's not the fault of the recipe I guess--but it really didn't appeal to me. Again, expecting these to be chewy, like a tradional blonde brownie, is almost the same as expecting fudge to be chewy. These were okay, but not worth a repeat. Who wants something to be just okay when you're using 8 ozs. of quality chocolate?  (Not to mention the chocolate chips...) Update: Hubby REALLY liked these, and he said his staff did as well. Guess I need to upgrade these from three to four stars!

These are fabulous!  A few tips I learned after making these a few times:  Use good chocolate, not the chips you find in the grocery store. (This makes the texture and flavor perfect) I get real white chocolate from my chocolate store.
Also, it's better if they are completely cooled, even chilled, before you try to cut them.  I make them the night before, let them set really good, and cut them the next day.  They are perfect the next day.  Cut them small! They are very rich, but awesome.  I bring them to family gatherings and they are the first to disappear.

I had a get together and I made five different desserts (White chocolate Blondies, Autumn Cheescake, Caramel Brownies II, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Cinnamon Coffee Cake II).  This one was the big hit.  I even had people ask me for the recipe, even email me later to get it from me.  It isn't very sweet and the mixture of the two chocolates is very nice.  I did use the bitter sweet chocolate and added extra.  It is very easy to make.  I used the microwave versus the double boiler to melt the chocolate.  NO Problems.

I just made these this afternoon and I've already had 2!  They're soooooooo good!!!  The only change I made was using a mix of white and semisweet chocolate chips at the end instead of just plain semisweet and they turned out great.  I'm really not sure why other reviewers say that using white chocolate chips instead of white baking chocolate doesn't work for this...I used store brand chips and these are delicious!  They melted down fine in a makeshift double boiler (glass bowl sitting over a pot of boiling water)and the cleanup wasn't bad at all!  I'll definitly make these again and again!

Wow.  These were amazing.  Normally I like cookies and brownies while they're still warm, but these were best after sitting for a couple days.

OMG!  These are fantastic!  I am a huge white chocolate fan and I couldn't stop eating these!  I, too, drizzled chocolate on the top, but would recommend omitting the chocolate chips in the recipe if you are going to do this.  They are *incredibly* rich!  I also used white chocolate chips instead of white chocolate baking squares or candy bars.  I would *not* recommend doing that.  The chips didn't melt well and made a big clumpy mess.  They still tasted great, but clean-up was awful!

This was a good base. I made alot of changes to the recipe tho. One of the things I did was omit the choc. chips and add walnut pieces. Then for serving I added vanilla ice-cream on top with a maple-butter syrup. Syrup: 1/3c Maple syrup, 6 T unsalted butter, 1/4c heavy cream, and walnuts pieces for garnish. Place syrup and butter in saucepan over med. heat. Cook until mixture bubbles and thickens, swirling the pan, about 6 min. Add cream and continue to cook till mixture is consistancy of carmel.

I was looking for a new recipe to make at the last minute.  Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand.  Everyone adored these squares, they where a huge hit.  I will definately make them again, and again.  I drizzled some dark chocolate and some white chocolate over the top, which really dressed up their appearance.  Thanks for this recipe.

Made the recipe with the following changes: substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate chips, added 1/2 cup toasted pecans. Very sweet, but delicious. Were even better the second day, so next time, I will make them the night before.

Awesome recipe! It's the same as the one on the Ghiradelli packaging. Rich, moist, perfect little bars! I melted the white chocolate in the microwave, and sprinkled a few handfuls of mini semisweet chips on top of the batter instead of mixing them in. A huge hit with all the guys!

This recipe is amazing and so easy to make! I read the reviews and I also used white chocolate chips and melted them with the butter in the microwave. It melted perfectly! The semisweet chocolate chips were a little too bitter and I could barely taste any white chocolate. Next time I will substitute white chocolate for semisweet. Also these are best when completely cooled, preferably overnight. They taste great the next day!

After reading several mixed reviews, I almost didn't make these.  But I'm glad I did, because they turned out fantastic! I did use white chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet.. Just because hubby prefers white.  Other than that, everything stayed the same. Time and temp were perfect for me and they fit nicely into a 11x7 pan. Thanks Jenn :)

YUM! Don't over cook them and they have a great gooey center part. I added in some dried cranberries for a festive holiday touch. Pretty easy. I was almost scared off by the double boiler, but it was not a problem.

FANTASTIC! These were quick and easy, and a huge hit at the office!
The only thing I changed up is I used a bigger baking pan so they were a little thinner but the recipe yeiled more. I am already making this a second time, they will definitely be a part of the holiday baking bundles I give to my friends.

Whoa!  These are fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and these turned our wonderfully.  A great way to use leftover high quality white chocolate from Christmas.  I did let them set overnight before eating as some others recommended.  They do strike me as a brownie that needs to set up.  Will make again most definitely.

These are good, have great flavor, but they are almost like cake. So if you are looking for something dense and very moist, these are not it. Make sure to toss the chocolate chips in flour before stirring them into the batter or they will fall to the bottom of the pan.

I had a hard time with this recipe; it didn't turn out well at all.  The texture was like a biscuit and the chocolate chips burned on the bottom of the pan.  I think there should have been better timing instructions in this recipe.  It doesn't say how long to cool the white chocolate and butter mixture before adding it to the egg mixture.  In brownie (or blondie) recipes, it should also be very clear that you shouldn't mix the batter too much.  With that aside, they just didn't have much flavor.

I mistakenly added the white chocolate mixture while it was still hot, melting all of the chocolate chips...I still thought it might come out o.k...but no one liked them, they were very dense and too sweet.

i warmed these up before serving, topped them with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and drizzled chocolate sauce on top. Looked just like an expensive restaurant dessert. Everyone who tried these thought they tasted just excellent! It is the best and easiest recipe i have ever made.

Very tasty and nice texture.  I too used toll house white choc chips and it came out fine.  Yum!

These are in the oven and I think I will like them but I have this nagging feeling I should have baked these on a graham cracker crust to make them more "brownie like".  This recipe seems like a great basis for add ins, add ons, and the makings for very customized, elegant desserts!  Can't wait to taste!

AMAZING!!! Added about 1 cup of Oreo cookie pieces for an amazing cookies and creme brownie... they are pretty fudgy, I baked them for 35min. I refrigerated them overnight and they are great! Will be adding plenty more twist for more creations tastes... I will be using this recipe over and over again. I love this recipe, and I'm not very fond of white chocolate normally.

Excellent recipe. I used "white chips" instead of the pricier white chocolate, and they tasted great. Very moist and very sweet. They were a big hit with my family!

Made these just today, and they set well enough for me to cut  them in only a few hours. While they were delicious, everyone thought it was a cake instead of blondies. And I have to agree. The texture just wasn't quite right for a blondie, though I could have made a mistake along the way. :) Other than that, I have no complaints. However, next time I think I'll switch the chocolate chips for plain white chocolate. Good recipe! Hopefully, I'll be able to make them better next time. :D

sooo delicious!  I used just regular chips rather than high quality chocolate and like another reviewer suggested just used my mixer and it turned out fine.  I also used a miz of white and milk chocolate chips in step 2.  Just because I wanted to avoid them being too much like choco chip cookie bars. I put them in the fridge overnight before cutting them.  The perfect melding between blondies and fudge in my case!  Will use again

These were fantastic! I read a number of the reviews about these being almost fudgy, but mine were light and fluffy... I wonder if those who thought they were fudgy really followed the directions to fold in the flour. That could be the key to making them light and fluffy. I did omit the semi sweet chocolate chips and put in chopped walnuts instead. That doesn't seem like it would really make that much of a difference as far as fluffiness. I also thought these were wonderful warm. I made them without the chocolate chips because I had made a carmel cake earlier in the day and had left over frosting, which was so delicious, so I wanted to make these blondies to use up the rest of the frosting. And since people had said they were very rich, I omitted the chocolate chips. They are so delicious with or without the frosting though even without the chips.

Lovely! I was out of vanilla in the midst of the 2010 Snowmageddon, so I used hazelnut liquor instead and added 1/2 cup. choppped hazelnuts. Since I was on a roll, I made a drizzle of hazelnut liquor, a bit of lemon juice, and 10x sugar. Totally wowza!

After reading all of the great reviews about this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly, except, I used a Perfect Brownie 13 x 9 pan, so I increased the portions from 12 to 18.  I sampled the bowl after I put the batter in the pan and it tasted delicious and excited me for the finished product.  I cooked for 30 minutes because of the increased portions, and the brownies came out golden and lovely.  After they cooled, I tried 1/2 a blondie and was a bit disappointed because I thought the white chocolate flavor would come through more than it did. I found that the chocolate chips overpowered everything else.  However, I did like the texture of this blondie.  I will make again, but will substitute 1/2 the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips to see if this brings a more white chocolate flavor to these blondies.

I think these should be called white chocolate brownies, blondies are made with brown sugar right and dont require chocolate in the mix. These were awesome! My family loved them they gave it 4 stars but I get the final say and I give it 5 stars. I will definately make these again.

These were great. What I did was I used slightly less butter and white chocolate. The result was a more cake like blondie which is the way I like them to be. They look great and they taste great and its hard to even find a decent blondie recipe. I tried a recipe from Bobby Flay and it sucked real bad. These blondies are really exceptional!

I love to decorate these little treats with semi-sweet chips melted then drizzled after cutting.  Sprinkle a little colored sugar on top and you can have an elegant dessert for any holiday.

I like this blondies very much! Very very good recipe. I don't know why, but I never manage to make really good brownies or blondies. These came out beautiful, they taste good, I could cut nice small squares....wow! A keeper! I wonder if you can substitute chocolate for the white chocolate, maybe I can make good brownies that way??

This recipe is always a hit.  DEFINATELY use white baking chocolate, not the imitation chips.  This recipe does not turn out well otherwise.  I also always use real butter, not margerine.

I had on hand 1/4 c of white choc. chips and 1 1/2 c butterscotch chips and substituted them for the choc. chips.  The were a little too greasy.  I would try decreasing the butter by a couple of Tbl. next time.

Either you like white chocolate or you don't. Still, everybody who tasted these bars (even the white chocolate hater, like my grandmother) not only loved them, but asked me for the recipe. I've made it a bunch of times in only a few months

I loved these blondies - I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet ones to give them a richer flavor.  They were fabulous.

Great recipe and great technique. Moist, chewy, and a very present flavor of white chocolate. The blondie is thick and rich. Absolutely lovely but a little addicting! My go to from now on.

Exceptional blondies! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used white chocolate chips, as some other reviewers did, and I sprinkled the final 1 C. of chips on top of the batter instead of folding them in. They came out perfect - not overly sweet but definitely sweet enough. The texture is wonderfully smooth. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I made these as well as many other deserts for a party and as soon as they tasted the blondies they wouldn't touch the rest of my desserts! They were a big success and definitely a recipe I'll be saving. I had a few changes based on other reviews including just microwaving the white chocolate (I used chips and they came out fine) instead of using a double boiler which seemed like too much of a hassle. Also instead I just kept them truly blonde by using white chips instead of semi-sweet.

These looked AWESOME when I pulled them out of the oven...a few hours later when I cut them, I was disappointed to see that they did look very doughy despite the toothpick coming out clean.  I did not want to serve brownies that looked under-done, so I had to cut around the doughy parts and only use half of the pan.  Not sure what I did wrong!?

These are excellent: I got raving reviews of this. If you want them more fluffy, add a little baking soda (1/4-1/2 tsp) if you want them more fudgy, leave out an egg.

I was expecting these to have the melt-in-your mouth texture of brownies, but they were cookie like and coarse.  Also, any nuances of the white chocolate disappeared after baking.

I used baker's quality white chocolate & added white chips instead of chocolate.  They were SO rich & delicious!

I didn't much like this recipe. Turned out dry and not much flavour. I doubt I will make it again.

I made these last night for my friends. RAVE reviews! They turned out so moist and dense! Way better than chocolate chip cookies. So good when they're slightly warm. I also used white chocolate chips and they turned out fine. Only word of caution I have is that when you work with white chocolate chips DON'T expect them to melt exactly like regular chocolate chips. Mine actually got "gloppy" in the butter...but when it was mixed with the batter it was no big deal. They turned out great.

The president of my employer brought these into work the other day and I have never heard of them before. So when I tasted them they were the best (considering I have never had any before). He made his with white chocolate, shaved chocolate, and butterscotch morsels. They were very good. So I desided to make my own, however I switched up the recipe a little. I used premium white chocolate (microwave), half white/light brown sugar, and milk chocolate/toffee bits. They came out perfect! Also try them with the butterscotch, they are great too.

Okay, I made these one night when I was in a "I REALLY want something sweet, but I have not a lot in my pantry."  I used 4 oz. of white chocolate and 4 oz. of homemade caramel, mixed that with the butter.  I didn't have the chocolate chips, so I used a cup of chopped pecans, baked as directed.  MMMMMM... MMMMMM... GGOOOOOOOODDDD.  Very very satisfying.  Love it!

I made this recipe but instead of chocolate chips, I used white chocolate chips and added dried cherries.  It is delicious!  The recipe is easy and fast as well.

I turned these into cranberry-orange blondies  and they are absolutely delicious.  Here are the changes I made:  substitute 1 Tbsp. orange juice for the vanilla extract (white choclate already has plenty of vanilla in it, so you don't really need extra).  Omit the semi-sweet chocolate chips and add 1 cup dried cranberries instead.  Add 1 Tbsp. freshly grated orange zest.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  **Also, these took 35-40 min. to bake in my oven.  They were definitely not done in 25 minutes.

I made these today, with some small changes: I substituted brown sugar for white sugar and put walnuts instead of chocolate chips. I added the sugar to the melt butter and chocolate, then the eggs and last flour and salt. They turned out wonderfully moist and not too sweet. I was a little exitating at the beginning as it seemed that white chocolate, butter and sugar would not mix. But when I added the eggs all came together fine. None left in 2 hours (mom, I and a neighbor)!!!! I will do this again!

Mm-mm-good blondies! My husband doesn't like brown chocolate, so I had to find a good blondie recipe. After trying four or five others including some written by chefs on foodnetwork, this recipe was both our absolute favorite!   It's true this recipe doesn't exactly have the chewy texture of brownies (it's more cake-y), but the taste is so delicious. It's kind of like a shortcake version of brownies. Try it!

Loved this one!  I brought it to a Thanksgiving family gathering and it went as fast as the pumpkin pie.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a glass 9x13 pan and had to add at least 10 minutes to the cooking time.  While it cooled on the counter, I made some chocolate ganache (with semi-sweet chocolate chips and whipping cream over a double boiler).  I let both cool to room temperature and then spread the ganache over the blondies.  I then let it set over night and cut it into rather small bars.  This is a really rich recipe.  I do agree with some that it is a little dense, but it almost tasted like a cheesecake - some people thought it was.  I may try it again with a little less white chocolate.  The toffee idea sounds good, too!  Thanks for a new favourite!

I thought these had a good taste, but I did feel the texture was quite thick and doughy, and the white chocolate was not as strong as I had hoped.  After reading other's reviews and tips, I think i will omit the chocolate chips, and use a combo of white chips and toffee instead.

I heeded the others' warnings about the texture and simply added an egg and lessened the butter a tiny bit (like a TBSP).  I thought they were still REALLY buttery.  I would add a little less salt next time and the choco chips are def necessary.  All in all a great recipe and will def make again!  In response to a previous review about blondies requiring brown sugar - I'm going with Platinum Blondies!

I wasn't a fan of these at all.  They turned out too cakey, but that could have been the baker.  My company enjoyed them because they were sweet with the white and semi-sweet chocolate.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  The flavor was very odd and the texture was cake-like, yet somewhat rubbery at the same time.  I will stick with my regular blondie recipe because although I'm a huge white-chocolate fan, these blondies just didn't deliver.

Terrific!  Everyone loved them.  I used 1/2 T vanilla extract and 1/2 T almond, gave it great flavor.  I also added chopped chocolate chips to the batter and chopped pecans.  I did the 40% power microwave w/ the butter and the white chips...  These were great, Next time I'll have to double the recipe and use a 9X13 pan.

I made this for some friends and my family and they where all gone in a day!  These blondies are very rich but nobody could eat just one!  This is definitely going to become a normal desert for parties and gatherings.

Very very good.  The white chocolate tastes is sooooo yummy in the bars.  I didn't use regular chocolate chips but used the 'swirled' chocolate/caramel chips.  I also doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, cooked for 35 mins and it came out nice and dense and MOIST!  Topped them with the Caramel Sauce from the 'Bananas with Caramel Sauce' from this site & a small dollop of ice cream - beyond sinful!  Will definitely make again!

These are SOOOOOOO good. whoever doesn't give these 5 stars is crazy! these taste exactly like Moxies white chocolate brownie. next time Im going to serve these for dessert with vanilla icecream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce just like Moxies does. I would highly recommend these to anyone, even if your not a fan of white chocolate, you'll love these!

Insanely easy to make.  I have made these TWICE in the past 4 days and they don't last more than a few hours at my house.  This is a new favorite for my family.

I thought the texture was doughy and it was too rich. Probably wouldn't make again.

These got lots of praise but I thought they were just OK.  Flavor was good but the texture was a bit off in my opinion.  I added toffee bits to the batter, too.

My boyfriend seemed to enjoy these, but I thought they were just ok. The taste reminded me of undercooked chocolate chip cookies. Not sure I'll be making these again.

I made these for a friends birthday at workand everyone loved them.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular and we ate them with ice cream.  Very tasty and I am not a big fan of white chocolate!!

These blondies are very chewy and soft.  The chocolate morsals went to the bottom. So it made a crunchy layer of chocolate.  They are pretty easy to make too.

These were absolutely amazing! So easy to make and so unbelievably delicious. The first time I made them I omitted the chocolate chips, instead drizzled them with dark chocolate after baking. The second time I increased the recipe by 1.5 and turned it into a white chocolate cake. Both times my family and friends couldn't get enough!

This recipe is amazing!!!  I love white chocolate so much.  They taste so good when they're cold.  What I did was I served them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and dripped caramel sauce all over them.  My mother told me she didn't like them and asked me to never make them, but I kept catching her stealing a couple when she thought I wasn't looking.  I recommend these to anyone who is as fond of white chocolate as I, also m&m's work really well instead of the chips!

These are soooo good, no wonder they're so fattening!  They took me about 45 minutes overall including cleanup.  I didn't use the semisweet chocolate chips in them, and they were still fine.

Wow! you can really taste the white chocolate in these. I used some bars that I found on sale, 200g were used melted in the microwave and 200g chopped into chunks. I made brownie bites in a mini muffin pan and cooked them about 10 minutes. They did come out a bit chewey, but very rich and tasty.  I recommend placing a piece of aluminum foil loosely over them after about 4 minutes in the oven to avoid the tops from over-browning. PS: They were very hard to take out of the pan despite having greased it. Next time I would line the cups for sure.

They're tasty, but because they don't have brown sugar, they don't have that butterscotch/caramel taste that I was looking for. Not sure if I will make them again. I made them initially because all of the blondie recipes I saw required a 9X9 pan, which I didn't have. So I made this one instead because it used a 9X13 pan.

I melted the butter and white chocolate in the microwave at small intervals, but it was still separated at the end. I was worried I messed up but still went ahead and mixed the batter up. The butter was still separated, but I let it sit for 5 min and tried again and it came together! I added roasted nuts to it for some texture. They came out great and tasted delicious. And they weren’t as sweet as I thought they would be!

I made the recipe exactly as presented with the one exception of using white chocolate chips in place of both the white chocolate chunks and the semi-sweet chocolate chips. I thought it was kind of bland and too fudge like. Maybe using better quality white chocolate is very important as some reviewers proposed.

The only thing I can say after taking a bite is WOW! It's the first recipe I've ever made turning out SO well. The 25 minute timing is just perfect. I also used Toll House but dark chocolate chips instead of white, but it tastes still nice. The texture is rich and moist and please don't say that it's too greasy because you've put a whole 8 ounces of chocolate and half a cup of butter??. And an early HBD to myself since my birthday is tomorrow.

I made these today.  Instead of butter I used margarine and at first I thought, oops should have used butter because of how separated it was from the chocolate but it turned out to be fine.

Other than the substitution, I made it exactly as the recipe says.  They came out really good. They were moist and had an overall good taste.  The only complaint I have is they were a little bit too sweet  but not so sweet I can't eat them.  I certainly can and will.

I baked them at the right temperature and they still got burnt at the top. I could barely taste the white chocolate and they were very cakey.  They just tasted very plain and bland. I think it was a waste of time honestly.

These are amazing. Im a huge white chocolate fan so they are to die for. Only issue is the center takes much longer than the edges to bake. So I cut the edge pieces off then put it back in the oven. It might be better to use a slightly larger pan to avoid this.

I really wanted this to be successful.  I had never made blondies before. A friend suggested I try it, so I decided to give it a shot for Christmas. I chose this recipe because of the positive reviews and that stellar cover photo.  Sadly, it is nothing like I expected it to be. One other reviewer said that the texture was off. I'm hoping that this is the truth, because if this is how blondies are *supposed* to be, it's really not cool. They are gritty. I can taste the flour and vanilla extract more than anything else. With the exception of adding butterscotch chips, I did everything else as instructed. 

Even though I put the correct amounts of chocolate and chocolate chips (I used white and butterscotch) it hardly even tastes sweet, if that makes any sense at all. To me they're bland and it doesn't  have that awesome chewy texture I was expecting. It's more like cake with a weird mixture of crumbly and gooey bits. I think this might be because of the amount of flour used. I gave it to my fiance and he wasn't feeling these at all, I'm pawning them off on my family tomorrow, maybe someone will like them (hence the two star rating).

This recipe was simple and easy to  make.  Tastes like  a chocolate chip cookie with the texture of a cookie  bar/square. I did find the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom during cooking.

Follow the recipe, and you will be amazed.   I made these, took them to work.  Huge success!   I'll be making them again, and again.    If you like white chocolate, you will be making them over and over also.

These were excellent.  I used milk chips instead of semi sweet, and a really good quality white chocolate.  Makes a really nice treat, but it is so rich a little goes a long way. You could cut the serving size in half.

This is a new favorite.  Summer is coming soon, yet today was a bit chilly. I was hoping to use up some baking ingredients like my white chocolate chips. Tried this recipe. What a wonderful discovery!

This recipe rocks! I followed it step by step, only thing I changed was the amount of chips actually folded into the batter since I didn't have enough for what it asked. But, they still came out great!

Gorgeous! I recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone. Its simple to do and tastes delicious. I used white chocolate buttons instead of drops because they are significantly cheaper and work just as well. I also used milky bar chocolate!  Yum. Just make sure the butter is real butter because margarine doesn't mix with the chocolate very well.

I really liked this recipe.  I melted white chocolate chips and was quite happy with how it turned out.  I liked it better with the called-for semisweet chocolate chips stirred in, but it was an even split with our family with half preferring white chocolate.

recipe worked well.  since white chocolate is not real chocolate i suggest you find the best you can or add about 1/4 cup of heavy cream to what ever you melt.  it will make it melt better.  I used butterscotch chips. i did not melt the butter with the chips.  i added it after the chocolate.  then folded in the flour mix and then the additional chips.  Its best to fold in the flour and chips.

I did make this with a white chocolate base and then stirred in butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips. Also added maybe half a shot of butterschnapps to the recipe for flavor. They came out super moist and delicious and I got asked for the recipe!

These turned out amazing! For white chocolate, I don't understand the adding of reg chocolate, so I didn't.  Used white chips as others suggested, and a couple good handfuls of Craisins and chopped walnut pieces.  Family loved them, especially the ones who don't like cranberries!!  They freeze very well and making another batch right now, as I need more for this half of the holidays.  Think I will try adding almonds and toffee pieces next time.

I did double the recipe for a 9x13 pan.  The cooking time is almost about 50 mins, cause the batter was very thick.

Love these BUT I do microwave them for 3 minutes on high after taking them out of the oven.  I've found this alleviates the raw/dough-like consistency and improves their texture once cooled.

This was awful. I followed all the directions, but it tastes like sponge and it's quite horrible. I don't know what I did wrong, but it's a waste of white chocolate..

This is the dessert that is most requested at my office.  I use white chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I also add 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts and 1/2 cup of flaked coconut to the batter, folding into the batter with the chips.  It is a very moist, fudge-like blondie.  My oven requires a cooking time of 30 minutes.  Easy and delicious!

these are almost too good. rich and buttery and mmm... I want one now! I used a 12oz bag of regular ol' Nestle Tollhouse white chocolate chips: melted 8oz, and used the remaining 4oz in place of semi-sweet chips. I doubt fancy white chocolate is necessary. this is a keeper!

These were pretty good. I used white chocolate chips, and melted them in the microwave. At first I was worried because they weren't melting, and when I tried to get them to melt, they burned a little. I melted the butter sepeeratly, then after putting it in the mixer, it went smooth. I personally think that they wouldn't have been very sweet w/o chocolate chips, but having never tasted nor made a blondie before, I wouldn't know. I might try this again in hopes that I get a little better results.

These were pretty good.  Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pyrex dish (didn't adjust oven temp, though).  Also omitted the semisweet chocolate chips, and added orange extract, rose water, and cardamom.  The flavors I added were lovely, but the white chocolate didn't shine through as much as I expected.  Also, the texture was very much like a dense cake, not a true blondie.  They weren't a big hit as-is, so I'm going to try topping them with an orange frosting or glaze to play up the cake-like texture.

I found these to be good, but very very rich. I did not include the semisweet chips, as I didn't want a distraction from the white chocolate, but I have a feeling they need something else. I'm not a fan of nuts in dessert, but for those who are I think this recipe would really benefit from that contrast in the bar.  They are definitely better once they have cooled; we couldn't wait and had a square when they were still warm and they tatsted to me a bit like yellow cake.

Recipe works great, I used vanilla white chocolate with heath toffee bits and topped it with some blue bell dutch chocolate ice cream. For my baking I had to turn it down to 325 for about 5 minutes to keep the bars uniformly cooked.

First, I've literally tried every brownie recipe in existence! I love brownies! :) but I simply can't agree with any of the negative comments on this particular recipe.  To me, these are the best brownies, blonde or otherwise, *period*. I would highly recommend trying it at least once exactly as it's written, then decide for yourself :)

Very dissapointing. I follow this recipe and just add a  handful of almond. I bake it 175C for 25 minutes, and when it's done the texture wasn't soft, wasn't fudgy at all but not-good-chewy and rubbery. It has nice flavour though. I don't think i'll make this recipe again.

This tasted so good! I too found it quite heavy, tho. Eggs are the only leavening agent, so maybe next time I'll try adding some baking powder/soda. Very yummy and simple - will definately make again!

These are ok,not amazing. Followed the recipe to a T. When I normally make brownies they are soft and gooey and crumbly, but these were chewy and solid. When I upturned them onto the wire rack, normally the area that hasn't risen as much sinks down, on these they stayed, suspended in the air! Not terrible, not amazing, average.

If you have a chocolate craving, this is the perfect fix!  They are easy to make and so yummy, especially hot out of the oven.

I've made this recipe a few times and they are delicious! I get requests for them all the time. I'm not a huge white chocolate fan, but I found that if you replace the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips the blondies are even better. Also, to make them festive (like for Valentine's Day) instead of putting the chips into the batter, I melted the chips (white chocolate) and added some red food coloring.  After the batter is transferred to the pan, swirl the red melted chocolate on top- they turn out very pretty.

THESE. WERE. INCREDIBLE! The only change I would make next time would be to use mini-chocolate chips or sprinkle them on half-way through baking time so that they don't all sink to the bottom. I made a quick syrup by heating up brown sugar with a little milk and a splash of vanilla & kahlua. AWESOME! This blondie begs for milk - or ice cream - so have some on-hand!

These are the bomb!!  Everywhere I take them they get devoured.  They are my kids favorites.  Not low calorie, but work the occasional splurge.  But don't forget to cool the pan on a wire rack, or they don't set up right and you have gooey blondies.  Thanks for the recipe.

I am convinced that this recipe is full proof.  I was busy talking with my husband while cooking and accidentally creamed the butter and mixed with the eggs (was also going to make chocolate chip cookies and must have had that on my mind). I ended up melting the white choc (Nestle Premier White Morsels) slowly in the microwave, they were not totally smooth, but I beat with egg/butter mixture for about 2 min on medium before folding in the flour.  Also I spred a little batter at the bottom of my pan before adding the choc chips to so they wouldn't end up at the bottom.  These came out perfect!

The recipe looked promising but was disappointing.  These Blondies had a strange after-taste; perhaps too salty.  We will not be making these again.

These are pretty good. I sprinkle choc chips on top of blondies, immediately after they come out of oven and then cool completely. This eliminates them settling during baking and possibly burning on bottom. I have also used crushed toffee bars on top instead of chips. YUM! This recipe will only work with real white chocolate! Expensive, but worth it(I love a couple of the earlier reviews, where they admitted they messed the recipe up, and then gave it a 2 star...too funnY)

Although they tasted good, I did not like the texture of these bars.  The toothpick came out clean, but they were definitely undercooked.  Will not make this again.

I added grated coconut to the mix and flaked almonds to the top which were nice touches.  Thought the blondies were a little too cakey for my tastes- I like them chewy and these were more like a dense cake.

These are really good.  I made them the first time but accidentally used twice the amount of butter called for and they were incredibly greasy.  I just made them again however and they are completley addicting.  My boyfriend LOVES them.  I use butterscotch chips instead of chocolate and they are so, so good!

I thought these were ok, nothing special.  My husband liked them but he thought they might be a little better if you used white chocolate chips in place of the chocolate chips.  May try that if I make them again.  Also, I agree that decreasing the amount of butter is a good idea.  I actually ended up pouring some off because it kept separating from the white chocolate.

Decadent! They melt in your mouth!  If desired, you can decrease the butter by a couple of TBS so it is not quite so overwhelmingly rich.

these are surprisingly easy to make and they are SO good! i was a little bit worried because i was afraid of burning the white chocolate or not 'folding' the ingredients together properly but it turned out wonderfully! i'm not even a huge chocolate fan & i loved these. my boyfriend has a sweet tooth and he said they were amazing. they are especially good served warm with a bit of vanilla ice cream.

Really good.  These were a huge hit with friends and relatives.  They came out like big chocolate chip cookie bars but I must have done something wrong because I couldn't taste the white chocolate at all.  Still, excellent recipe!

Ok, I am not sure if I did something wrong with these, but I put them in a 12x8 in baking pan because I didn't have a 9x9. I also baked longer because the pan was bigger.  Though they seemed kind of dry to me. Though all of my coworkers say they are great and not too sweet, which makes them even better.  Next time I make them I will just put them in my 8x8 baking pan and not bake them as long.  I also didn't stir the chips into the mix, just put them on top towards the end of the baking so they wouldnt sink to the bottom of the pan.  I gave them 4 stars though because my co-workers really like them.  Thanks for the recipe, will try again! :0)

I needed a sure fire dessert recipe for a fund-raiser I was attending. I saw this recipe and had to try it. I was a little apprehesive during the mixing and baking. But once I tasted... WOW! These things are great.

I may have done something wrong on this recipe. It was extremely dry and wouldn't make it again.

These Blondies are excellent! I made a couple of batches for a bake sale at school and they sold out fast! They are so easy to make, and it's not very complicated at all.
