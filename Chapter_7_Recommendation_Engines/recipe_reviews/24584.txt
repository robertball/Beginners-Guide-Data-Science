Great recipe that I'll be using again and again!  One hint, though--make sure the bread is covered completely by the bacon or the bread will burn.

I made these for a party and everyone loved them. I thought they were okay. I think it is best not to stretch the bacon around and around the roll, or the inside of the bacon doesn't get cooked and the edges get burnt. But everyone loved them....

Yummy! I really enjoyed these! Anything with cheese and bacon pleases me! Prep was simple, I used thin slices of velveeta instead of cheese sauce and that worked very well. The only complaint I have is the bacon on the bottom of the wraps didn't cook so when I took them out of the broiler I cooked them on the stove until the bottoms crisped. Next time I make these I will pan fry them for just a minute first and then broil them.

I'm glad I tried this appetizer recipe PRIOR to my New Years Eve Buffet! Its very tasty, but the bread has a tendancy to burn before the bacon is done. I may experiment more after my party, but this won't be on the table this year! Sorry!

This is a hit!  But you will save yourself so much effort if you just par-cook your bacon before wrapping it.  You can either cook it on the stove or boil it.  Both work as long as you keep the bacon soft.

The guests seemed to enjoy these, but I didn't like them!  They were a bit dry and they burned too easily under the broiler.  I don't think I would try them again.

These are great!  I have never tried them with cheese sauce though, we use cream cheese instead.  These are always a big hit!

TASTY!   Not knowing what to use for "cheese sauce", I mixed chopped olives with cream cheese.  Any left over, I knew I could use with crackers.  I was unable to roll the strip of bread so I just folded it in half and placed the open side down on the bacon and wrapped.  While cooking, a lot of the cheese oozed out.  I really didn't think this recipe was going to be successful but was pleasantly surprised at just how tasty they were!   Next time I think Ill try velveeta cheese.  Thank you RONNIEB for sharing your recipe!

A really big hit at our parties. You need to closely monitor the wraps under the broiler so they don't burn and flip them over once to brown both sides evenly.

These baked up perfectly and were so nice and crispy, but we just didn't care for the flavor for some reason. We like all the ingredients, but I guess maybe the olives gave everything else a flavor that we just didn't care for. These were fun to try, though.

This is my recipe and  the cheese I used is Kraft Old English in a jar,  cheese spread...not  "cheese sauce".  Sorry.  I have also tried it with pimento cheese and that is good too!

These treats are delicious! My father ate almost all of them and kept repeating "Good God that's good!" The bread will burn, though, like one reviewer said, if you don't completely cover it with the bacon.
