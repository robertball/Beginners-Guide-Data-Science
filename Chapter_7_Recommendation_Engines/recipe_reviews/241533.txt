I did few mods, but this recipe is super versatile and has great base flavors, which is why I think it deserves 5 starts. I used butternut squash instead of sweet potato, and heaping tsp. of hot paprika, and doubled cumin and left out the coriander because I didn't have any on hand and used real Parmesan cheese instead of goat or feta. As another user recommended I browned the sausage with the onions and garlic before adding in the squash and I think that adds a bit to texture and taste. Because I subbed squash I increased the simmer time from 15 to 20 min.

I made this just as the recipe called for, and it was very tasty! I always try the recipe "as written" initially when it's new to us. Very flavorful and next time will add an additional can of beans, as they get lost in the soup! My entire family loved it and will be adding it to our menu. Next time I'll post additions we made! Also, thought I had Feta Cheese, but didn't so grated Pepper Jack on top! Delicious!!

Smokey Sausage Kale Sweet Potato Soup Haiku: "Really tasty soup. Subbed in spinach for the kale, kept the rest the same." I could nudge this up to 5 stars (whole family really loved it, and the leftovers were divine as well) but I think that a chorizo or andouille sausage would've given it just that extra bit of kick that it needed. Otherwise, w/ a hunk of baguette  soaking in your bowl - yum.

I had a soup similar to this at a local winery and wanted to make it at home.  Hubby liked the feta cheese; it was good like that but I think I preferred without. I did not add any chick peas.  I used Cajun-style Andouille sausage.  It was spicy and we loved it!

Sweet potatoes, onion and kale (lots of it more like 4-5 cups) from our garden. I bought 4 sweet Italian  and 2 hot sausage. cut them into pieces with my kitchen scissors and sautéed. I used 3 cans of chic peas (also known as garbanzo  beans. The spices suggested truly enhanced the broth so don't dismiss this.

Loved this recipe!  I doubled the amount of sweet potatoes to make it a little chunkier, used Andouille sausage for a spicier kick, and substituted cumin for the coriander (only because I was out), and everyone who tried it loved it!  We'll make it again for sure!!!

Soo amazing! I can’t say enough about the flavor in this soup. I added an extra can of chickpeas and 2 extra cups of chicken broth, chicken sausage, and regular chili powder since I didn’t have chipotle. I also forgot to add my spinach. My boyfriend and two teenage sons loved it, I will make again and again!!

This was delicious and I will definitely be making it again.  You can do lots of things to change this up a little bit too.  I was short a cup of stock but it still turned out great.

I made it and my wife and I liked it very much.  Chick Peas do not come in a 19 oz can.   So I used one 15oz can and it was fine.  

The prep went well also, hardest part was dicing the sweet potato.  

This is pretty quick and very tasty.

Very good. After reading the reviews I modified the recipe as follows: 4 cups of chicken broth is plenty. I increased the beans by one can do to ever view. Next time I will add three cans of beans. For the sausage are used 1/2 regular and 1/2 spicy to give it a little kick.

good but I think we prefer the soup recipe that has cream in it.
Used black beans and spinach, but not as much hot spices.

Soooo delicious especially on a cool rainy fall evening.  We didn’t have the ground chipotle so subbed in 1 chipotle in adobo that had been lurking in the back of the fridge as well as a half teaspoon of ancho Chile powder. The broth was amazing with a perfect kick at the end. Can’t wait for leftovers!

Omg, this was amazing!!!  I knew my 2 sons and husband would enjoy it, but  they actually inhaled it! I did add  another sweet potato, and an extra can of beans,  I like to have a soup that is filling, and this did not disappoint.

This was really good and I’ll be making it again. I didn’t have enough low sodium broth so I had to use a mixture of the low and regular broth .  I should’ve cut back on adding additional salt, because I need to watch salt intake for my husband. The only other change I made is substituting black beans for chick peas. I love chick peas but my husband is partial to black beans and it’s a great alternative, if you’d like to try it.

This recipe was yummy and I can see how it could be very versatile. I used half sweet and half smoked paprika and it gave it a wonderful flavor along with the cumin and coriander I will definitely make this again.

Excellent spice flavors!  Made as is except substituted cannellini beans for the garbanzo (hubby's choice).  You can vary the meats and beans but stick to the soup base.  Delicious.

Really liked this soup! I did use leftover Kalua pork along with 1 cup of leftover smokey broth instead of smoked sausage, also didn't add the chipotle seasoning (love it but my stomach doesn't!!) but otherwise followed the recipe.

I used purple sweet potatoes, andouille sausage and baby kale. I left out the chipotle to keep it mild. Delicious! Will make it again.

I've never made a meal with kale or sweet potato, so I was a little hesitant using both ingredients in a soup. I'm so glad I did! Its flavorful, fulfilling and easy and so quick to make! My husband loved it too! This will ba a family favorite from here on out!

Really tasty and cooks up quickly. I used spinach as suggested in place of the kale, and that worked well. The savory sausage with the sweet potatoes is a good flavor combination. Good weeknight dinner.

Amazing! I followed the recipe, however, I added some baby spinach along with the kale. Nutritious, easy & a crowd pleaser for my family! Thank you for sharing!

Yes I will make this again. It was delicious and so easy and quick to make. I went with two cans of beans (one garbanzo and one cannelloni), had bag of frozen spinach on hand. Next time I will be sure to have feta cheese or even grated cheese on hand though, that would have made it even better!

Excellent! It was a great way for me to use several odd foods that were about to spoil. I did not have any onion or coriander, so I just used onion powder. It's a healthier soup than most and a welcome change from the same boring soups and stews that I often make.

Delicious!  I didn’t have ground chipotle, I substituted Cajun seasoning and I subbed in white beans.  So easy to make and really good.

I used canned red kidney beans because I don’t like chickpeas very much and chorizo sausage. The sausage made the soup pretty greasy so I spooned much of it off the top. Overall delicious; even my mother in law enjoyed it and she is very picky and usually doesn’t like spiced foods.

So easy, quick, and yummy! We had fresh jalapeño sausage on sale here so I used that and pinto beans as black beans instead of the chickpeas. Everything else I followed according to the recipe and it turned out amazing. Served it with a side of corn muffins for a complete dinner. Will make again!

Good soup. Yum. I massage the kale till it cries uncle with kosher salt, then rinse it until all the salt is gone. Makes the kale much more tender. I also use chicken smoked sausage and great northern beans instead of garbanzo beans. Like the texture better. Lovely soup.

Very easy and tasty soup.  I used spicy andouille sausage, cannellini beans, and kale, but to tenderize the kale, I stir fried it with the sausage, onion and garlic, then added the rest of the ingredients.  Only spice I used was 1 tsp ground coriander which gave it a very nice flavor.  Oh, and because I'm a Louisiana cook and had some Rotell tomatoes with chilies on hand, I added a cup of that, too.  This one is a keeper!

I used vegeterian sausage that was spicy so I did not use the chiplote spice.  I give it 4.5 stars because it took longer to cut up and prepare the items than stated, maybe I am just slow however.  :0  Plan to make again.  I made it for lunch with company and they said the recipe was a keeper-repeater!

Very good. Entire family, including ages 5 and 13, gobbled it up.  Used a kind of chorizo for the sausage, otherwise pretty much followed the recipe, using kale and omitting hot spice.

This soup really good. The only change I would make would be to brown the sausage first with the onions. It makes for a richer taste. After that it would be 5 stars.

This soup blew our socks off. We used great northern beans. We omitted the coriander because we didn't have any. It was so creamy with the addition of the goat cheese. Don't leave it out! This recipe is going in my "tried and true" recipe book for sure.

(Next time I would scale back the chipotle pepper just a bit as it was pretty spicy for my kids' taste.)

I made this with ground sausage rather than sausage slices.  I served it with pasta which made it more filling. But it was delicious.  My husband really liked it too.

I have made this recipe several times and have not been disappointed once.   I have made this with and without the chickpeas, and it was great.  I have never added the goat or feta cheese as I don’t think it needs it and am not a fan.  When serving to kids I do reduce the chipotle pepper, but for adults the spice level is perfect.  We serve with freshly baked bread.  My picky husband loves it.

I wanted to use up some sweet potatoes that I had on hand and I wanted soup on this cold and snowy weekend.  Loved this!  Spices were spot on and the chipotle pepper gave it a nice zing.  A loaf of fresh baked bread was all we needed for a warming Saturday night supper.  This one's a keeper!

My fam LOVED this. Accidentally put double the coriander but it turned out perfectly. And used garlic salt to replace garlic and salt separately. We will definitely be making this spicy winter soup again!

Wonderful flavor mix!  I used leftover (already cooked) sweet potato and turkey from Thanksgiving (no sausage or chickpeas).   I added brown rice (and equal amount of extra broth)  with the broth and let boil until cooked.  Then added turkey and potato.  Resulted in more of a stew texture.  I didn't have any coriander but didn't miss it.   It doesn't need the cheese garnish either, but the goat cheese I used on some servings did add another dimension to the taste.
