This is a wonderful, flavorful dessert.  People are usually funny about coconut, but coconut is great stuff.  Leaving out the coconut is an option, too. You can use any flavor of ice cream you want and it's still good.  Thanks for sharing it.

This was so simple and really good! An easy way to make ice cream just a bit more special! I can't wait to play around with different ice cream flavors with this!
