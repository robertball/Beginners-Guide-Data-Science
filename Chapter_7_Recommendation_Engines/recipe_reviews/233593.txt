I really wanted to give this a better rating b/c I love the idea of it, but it just fell flat on taste, as in, it didn't have any flavor. I don't know what was missing, but it's definitely missing something (or maybe a few things), just to give it some taste. Also, the ingredients are listed wrong...It says 1 cup ranch dressing/seasoning mix, which didn't seem right to me, so after checking out the HVR website, I discovered that it was supposed to be 1 cup PREPARED ranch dressing/seasoning mix, which made more sense, so take note of that. I'm still rating this a 3 b/c I do like the idea and I plan to play around w/ it. Thanks for sharing. :)

Like Christina I felt that the original recipe lacked . . something. The first time I made it I used Grandma's Cool & Zesty salad dressing and sprinkled the dry HVR dressing mix over it and tossed it all together. It was much better. However, the next time I used a red wine vinaigrette salad dressing - YUMMY!!  I also used fresh broccoli flowerettes instead of the frozen & I did not steam them.

I used PC brand Salsa Ranch dressing and added freshly ground pepper and a couple wedges of fresh lemon juice using the grated rind as we'll (about a good tsp full) and also added some left over steak (shaved peices), it turned out great!
