This recipe was a little hard to follow and you really shouldn't set melted sugar "aside," as it will solidify inside whatever you put it in.   The frosting however tasted awesome, I would just suggest that you melt the sugar while you're making the second mixture, and add it in as soon as the sugar dissolves.

This frosting is incredibly delicious!  It really has a TRUE caramel flavor. It was time consuming, and a little tricky to get to the right consistancy, due to my substituting half and half instead of the heavy cream.  If you do that, allow for extra boil time to reduce the moisture level.  This frosting has the texture of a thick glaze, so bear this in mind when spreading it.  It's not going to look like butter cream on your cake.  It will, however, be the most delicious stuff you've ever put on a cake!

What's not to like?  Butter, cream!! In case anyone else has the same question I did, I found the mixture should be beaten right away not allowed to cool first.  This frosting is delicious.

I didnt like the taste too much, but it was alright. As someone else said, dont cook the sugar first because it will harden pretty much instantly and be stuck once it cools.

This is more of a glaze than a frosting.  I love drizzling it over the top of the Amazing Apple Cake (recipe on this site).  
The taste of this reminds me of caramel chews, which is good because I always loved them.  However, this doesn't taste very creamy.
Also, it was my first time dealing with dissolved sugar.  I had such a difficult time getting the spoon unstuck from the bottom of the pan after transferring it to the mixture.  Lesson learned, I guess.

Flavour is very good and I would make again just for that.  One cooking problem: I followed reviewers' suggestions to caramelize the sugar WHILE boiling the sugar/cream/butter.  So I poured in the hot liquid caramelized sugar and it hardened into clumps IN the boiling liquid.  The frosting turned out fine (I just picked out the lumps).

It melted my pans and, it was like sauce. It did not turn out thick. When it melted the pan and we poured it out it turned very hard. So what I had to do was put cream cheese frosing in it. Now that was GREAT!!!! I would not use this again.

Yummy frosting, I could have eaten the whole bowl. I did what others suggested and caramelized the sugar while the rest of the ingredients were starting to boil. I whipped and whipped and it stayed a little runny so I let it sit about 15 minutes and tried again. This time, after it cooled to room temperature I was able to whip it to spread consistency. Came out great! Don't give up too soon
