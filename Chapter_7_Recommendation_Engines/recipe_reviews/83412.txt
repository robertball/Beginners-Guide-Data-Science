Fantastic!  I've made it twice in two days and there are none left!  Odd tip: try using the cheapest hotdogs you can find.  I used both good and cheap brands and the texture of the cruddy dogs actually works better with the cornbread and made it taste more like a corn dog.  I did cut down the brown sugar a bit (to 1 1/2 Tbsp) but that was personal preference.  This was so easy, super cheap and delicious!  I'm sure I will be using this recipe constantly.  It satisfies the kid in me :)

Never seem to have any leftover. I’ve been using this particular recipe since 2005. Really good. I recommend cutting the hot dogs into very small pieces and alternating while pouring in tins… batter, hot dogs, batter.

These were really delicious -- and easy. I halved the recipe because 18 muffins would have been way too many. Still made 10 large muffins, which was great. I could have squeezed out another two, I think because I filled the tins more than the 2/3 full that it called for. Batter was thicker than I thought it would be when dropping in the hot dogs, but they turned out great. I used 3 slices per muffin instead of half a dog, which I'm not sure would have fit in my muffin tins. The slices were popping out of the top a bit, but it didn't really matter. I served with honey mustard, which made them really delicious. They are pretty hardy, too. I was serving them as a Superbowl appetizer, but they were super filling could definitely be a meal. I can see how kids would love these. I have a couple left today, so I'll see how the keep. I had served them straight from the oven yesterday, so they were perfect. Will definitely make these again.

Decided to make a half a batch (Why?? We just wanted more!), but I accidentally added the full cup of cheese. Glad I did. They were great! I'll make the same mistake next time! Also, I cut up the hot dogs in half slices, and stirred them right into the batter. A half lb. worked well for the half recipe, even though I'll probably never make a HALF again! File this one under "Fun Food"!

These were a fun dinner.  I suggest cutting the hot dogs into smaller sized pieces for better distribution in the muffins.  I couldn't bring myself to add the brown sugar since the brand of corn muffin mix I use is already pretty sweet.  My husband liked them with mustard, I preferred them plain. Some pepper jack cheese in the batter might liven them up a bit.

I was unsure of trying this one but my teenagers really liked them.  I increased the cheese to 1-1/2 cups and in half the batter, I added chopped black olives and chopped jalapenos.  Those were the favorites. Next time I'll leave out all or most of the brown sugar; I'm not sure it was necessary.

These are fantastic...with a few changes I made to them....I am not sure they'd be so good with a box mix, I'm more of a make from scratch kinda girl....but here are the changes I made. 1 1/2 cup of flour, 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup cornmeal, 1 TBS baking powder, 1 tsp salt 1 1/2 TBS brown sugar, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1/2 cup diced red onion, 1 cup grated cheddar, 7 Hebrew National hot dogs, cut tiny into 1/4 lengthwise and diced.  Mix all dry ingredients together and add milk and eggs to dry ingredients then fold in cheese, onion and hot dogs and add to muffin tins.  The result is OUTSTANDING and made one pan of mini muffins and one pan of regular size muffins.  Thanks for the idea!

These are a great crowd and kid pleaser.  I made them in my mini muffin pan and they were just the perfect mix of hot dog and breading.  My pickiest eater said they were "fabulous"!  This is a great recipe to keep in mind for a potluck or kids lunch.

This one is great.  My 2 1/2 year old loves corn dogs and these are cheaper and a bit healthier than store bought, plus he loved helping me make them.  It doesn't say so in the directions, but I recommend covering each piece of hot dog with a bit of batter.  I also baked mine in mini muffin tins, cutting the hot dogs in 1/8ths.

I like these a lot. My husband, not so much (even though he likes corn dogs). I don't think the sugar is at all neccessary, most corn bread mixes are sweet already. Extra cheese is good though!

Easy enough recipe for my oldest son
to prepare and handheld food for my
youngest is always a draw. 

Tasty. My husband and I eat these
right along with the kids, only with
honey-mustard dipping sauce on the 
side. 

Would make again.

EDITED TO ADD 10/03/08: These are even good with kielbasa! I made a half batch and there were no survivors.

EDITED AGAIN: These really aren't bad for anyone's diet. You can edit almost any recipe to make them lighter OR have them occasionally. This is really great to pair with vegetable chili.

I made this the other night for a rushed dinner.  They went over well with my boys (4 & 2) but my husband and I did not like them at all.  I was skeptical about adding the sugar but decided to follow the recipe and it was a big mistake.  These were way too sweet.  I don't think the sugar should be added at all.  I cut the hot dogs into small pieces since my children are small and they are choking hazards, but there really didn't seem to be enough hot dog.  The bread overpowered the muffins.  I might make them again for my children since they did like it but only if they request it.  Also I think I will use the directions on the box and just add the hot dogs.  Thank you anyway for the idea, it just wasn't for us.

followed ingrediant exact. Awesome just the way it is! I would cut up the hot dogs in small pieces though...An early reviewer said to use low quaility hot dogs and it would be better-dont fall for it! Thats just gross...i make those things...if you don't know what by-products are find out!!!!

These were a huge hit with the entire family.  I made these for my kids for lunch, but my husband and I ended up eating quite a few ourselves.  I did take some reviewers' advice and slice the hotdogs.  I then added them into the batter and filled the muffin tins.  Next time, I would not mix them in, but rather distribute them evenly among the muffins cups after filling with batter.  This way we wouldn't end up with muffins with one bite of hot dog and others with 6.  Straight out of the oven, these have a nice crispy edge that is reminiscent of a real corndog.  Dipped in mustard and ketchup, these are a real treat!

These little muffins were very tasty and also quite filling!! Very easy recipe. I did make a few modifications...I omitted the brown sugar completely, but used honey flavored corn bread mix. I also added 1/4 of a chopped jalapeno to add just a kick of spice. I am vegetarian, so I substituted veggie hot dogs and worked out perfectly. Served with ketchup and mustard. Easy, quick, healthy, and yummy meal! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

4 stars for recipie, extra star for idea!  I used no-stick cooking spray on the muffin tin (sprayed liberaly as I always do), and had no problems removing muffins.  Substituted buttermilk for plain milk, used beef Plumpers-still partly frozen(cut into thirds and put in the tins for the first dozen, sliced into the batter for the last half-dozen as suggested by a previous reviewer).  Other than above mentioned, followed the recipie exactly-kept a close eye on the oven after 10 min.-and they turned out wonderfully!  I was also worried about the sugar(fiancee is diabetic), but it tastes just right as is, and we planned the rest of the days' meals with this in mind.  I definately recommend slicing the hot dogs into the batter-provides full corndog experience in every bite.

Great base recipe.  I skipped the brown sugar all together and didn't miss it.  I've used plain hot dogs and cheddar jalapeno ones - both are great.   I also chop them up into little pieces to ensure hot dog in every bite.   Another twist is to use cooked breakfast sausage links and have them for breakfast dipped into syrup. - Updated - Just want to mention that I've found them easier to remove from the muffin tin if I let them cool off about 5 minutes

Had a picnic and these were gobbled up in no time. Instead of using muffin tins I just put all the batter in a 9x13 and cut them up in squares

My daughter and I loved this recipe! I added a little more brown sugar and added a cup of frozen corn. I think next time I make this I will add some butter to make the muffins a little more moist. I also sliced the hot dogs up and put about 4-5 slices in each muffin. We ate these with applesauce and my daughter ate hers with ketchup.  They were really great!

I cut down on the sugar and double the cheddar cheese.  I also add a sprinkle of onion powder and slice the hot dogs and mix them into the batter.  My daughter loves these.  I serve them w/ honey mustard sauce. (equal parts honey and yellow mustard)

Wow!  I could not believe how good these were!  My husband and I both loved these.  I used a little less brown sugar than called for, but not by much.  Following the recipe, I got 20 muffins.  Only downside is that I used paper muffin cups and they stuck bad!  Will definitely add to my rotation.

i didnt care for this recipe versus store-bought corndogs.  my kids didnt eat much of it either.  i did slice up the hot dogs and added them to the muffin mix - i personally thought 9 was way too much.  probably could get by with 6 hot dogs and the sugar is not necessary at all.  thanks for the try!

These were really good! I used a half batch of 'Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread', added a Tablespoon of brown sugar and a handful of shredded cheese, and cut up two turkey hot dogs. Made 7 muffins, 3 of which my 6 year old ate :)

I'm not a big corn dog fan, but the rest of my family really liked these for lunch yesterday.  I actually made them with the Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe from this site, instead of the prepackaged mix.  Thanks for the recipe - my family can't wait for me to make it again!

I made these for my daughter and they were a big hit.  Such a simple "cheap" snack.  They keep in the frig and after a quick 45 seconds in the micro they taste like just from the oven.  I am going to them try with leftover taco meat or chili in the middle next.

Wow everyone loved these to all of our surprise.  I used a square glass baking dish (make them nice & thick) added 2 cans of green chiles & 2 packs of hot dogs~~omitted the cheese. Had to bake for an hour.  Served hot dog chili, jalapenos, sour cream, chopped onions, & nacho cheese sauce on the side for toppings.  I ate mine with a drizzling of Sriracha & Honey Mustard.  Quick, simple, & different.  Thanks!

I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  It was great.  The only thing I did differently is I kept the hotdogs whole and baked in a pan.  I had to increase the baking time slightly.  Then I cut them into pieces the size of a whole corndog.  I will make them again.  They are so easy and very tasty.

Quick and easy to make. :) Perfect to make for the kiddies. I just chopped up a package of hot dogs small and added it to the batter. Mixed everything together and that was it. Made 28.

These are AWESOME! Add brown sugar based on how much sugar is in your corn bread mix.  I halved the hot dogs lengthwise and then cut them into small pieces and added them to the batter.  I think it would be ideal to bake these without muffin liners - if you can (or let them cool completely - if you can manage to wait!).  Next time I will add chili flakes or jalapeno's to spice them up a bit!  Great baking project with a preschooler.  Mine is still squirting mustard over his "crazy" muffins!

I love the concept of this recipe. We had a barbecue and made WAY too many hot dogs and had a ton leftover. By day three we were getting pretty hot dogged out so I needed to do something different with the leftovers and came across this recipe.  I didn't have any corn bread mix on hand so I made the Sweet Corn Bread recipe by Virginia Hanker from this site.  It was easy and turned out delicious! Thanks for the great idea. I wonder why I never thought of it?

The idea seemed a little strange but these were delicious.  I halved the recipes since it is just me and my boyfriend.  It made about 12.  I cut up the hot dogs and stirred them in the batter, which made it kind of hard to pour, but it worked.  I also omitted the brown sugar as corn bread is sweet enough.  I will definatley make these again!

These are very simple to make and absolutely delicious! As a college student I'm always on the lookout for quick and inexpensive meals to make in my apartment. These were devoured almost as soon as they came out of the oven!

I also halved the recipe but kept the full amount of cheese and sliced the hot dogs. All of my guy friends (who usually don't cook) have made them since, without burning down the place! Great treat for broke students - yum!

This is such a fun recipe!  I actually used the recipe for sourcream cornbread instead of a box mix and omitted the brown sugar.  I toped the muffins with cheddar the last 10 minutes instead of mixing it into the batter.  This is such a cute idea, I will certainly be making this again!

Thanks Tina!  One of my six year old twins has begged me to make these everyday!  We ate the whole pan of "mini-muffins" the first afternoon.  Used cocktail weenies instead of hotdogs, so much better!  This is a definite family keeper!!

I really liked how these turned out; a non-fried corndog :)I didn't have any cornbread mix so I used the "Cornbread Muffins II" recipe on this site (plus the cheese). It made 24 muffins, and I cut the hot dogs into thirds instead of in half. Thanks!

This is an awesome kid-friendly recipe.  My 3 yo had a blast helping me mix everything and putting the hotdogs in the the batter.  We found that a scant 1/4 cup measure was perfect to fill the cups. I used Jiffy mix and didn't add the brown sugar per another review. I also sprinkled a little cheese over the the top of hotdogs. Yum!
Everyone enjoyed and it's a keeper!

I halved the recipe so DH and I would have just enough for lunch.  I used Jiffy mix and since it was already sweet, I didn't add brown sugar.  I wish I had.  I also used turkey Lil Smokies which I cut into thirds.  I don't know how many I used but it was probably about 10-12.  Half the recipe made twelve muffins in my regular sized muffin tins.  They were good but seemed a bit dry to me.  I'm not sure it was like a county fair corn dog but it was a nice change.  Thanks.

Had to substitute unsweetened soymilk and left out cheese, but otherwise it turned out great! The batter was runnier, but it just required a little longer bake time. My DD loved them!

These were so much fun to make with my 2 and 6 year old.  We used the Jiffy corn bread mix and turkey dogs.  Used 6 dogs and two mixes and found that we needed a higher ratio of hot dogs and should have cut them smaller.  Served with ketchup and mustard.  Super easy to make, super fun, and super cute.  Will definitely make again!

I am a huge corndog fan, but never had any lucky trying to make them at home.  This was the perfect alternative.  I loved them...but they are best hot out of the oven.  My family gave mixed reviews, but I ate the ones that they didn't!  Yummy!

This was such a quick, easy & tasty meal.  I halved the recipe except for the cheese.  I also chopped the dogs into large chunks & mixed them in with the batter because I wanted a more even distribution of them.  I got 11 muffins out of it.

This initially sounded strange, but the idea stuck in my head until I had to make them. The whole family loved these. i left out the sugar since the mix has lots, and sliced the hot dogs. My picky 3 year old ate 3, and the rest of us had fun experimenting with condiments. Best with mustard & jalapenos. i'll cook some diced jalapenos into half of the next batch.
Very fun recipe - thanks for posting!

I made these for my sons lunch box. He loved them so much he shared them with 2 of his teachers. I used cocktail weiners instead of hot dogs. Will definitly make these again.
I also made these for a bake sale & tweeked the recipe a bit. I added nutmeg & vanilla a mixed the cocktail weiners in the batter. They were a big hit at the bake sale & everyone loved them.

I made these tonight and my son LOVED them!  I thought they were really good, but the true test his my little corn dog lover!  I wanted to give them a test run before making them for his lunch box, and they were a hit!  I used Jiffy corn muffin mix, so I only used one Tbsp of brown sugar since it is already sweet, that is the only alteration I made.  I also only had 6 hot dogs, so I cut them in 8ths and used about 4 per muffin.  I think that works better for him anyway, so he can get a bite of hot dog in every bite.  Served w/ honey mustard.  He was a happy camper!

Fun recipe!! I experimented & added chopped jarred jalepenos to some, no cheese to others, low fat hot dogs, regular hot dogs. THe best combo for me was regular hot dogs & no cheese. My husband loved regular hot dogs with cheese & jalepeno. The lo fat hot dog texture really threw these off.  THey also freeze well & reheat easily in the microwave. They make a fun treat for my husbands lunch box.

I made this recipe in mini muffin pans and put one piece of hot dog in the middle so it stuck out the top 1/2".  I called them corn dog bites, the kids loved them!

These are SO good!  We've used several kinds of hot dogs - we haven't found any difference, except that we chop them up so you don't get a hunking big bite that drags out of the muffin.    They are even good the next day.  I'd suggest refrigerating any leftovers (if you have any!), because of the meat.  If you want to give these to kids, then be sure to chop the dogs up - coin-shaped or big pieces are choking hazards.   Really good - thanks for sharing the recipe!

~You can also cook these in a sandwhich maker!~ My family really enjoyed these.  I left out the cheese (I've never had a corndog with cheese).  I cut up the hotdogs in bite size pieces then mixed in after I poured the batter in the muffin tins. I served with oven baked fries. YUMMY!

Made these muffins for a party last night and they were well received.  I followed the recipe to the "T" with the exception of slicing the hot dogs directly into the batter instead of using 1/2 hot dog per muffin.  I used a package of 8 hot dogs and got 20 good size muffins.

This was not a hit with my kids.  I used Ballpark turkey dogs and I think they expanded too much...then later contracted leaving large gaps in the muffins.  Maybe cheaper hot dogs cut up into smaller pieces would have worked better.  If I were to ever make this again, in addition to the changes mentioned above, I would add honey to the batter.

Hey Tina, Tried the Corn Dog Muffins. Made half the recipe, with hot dogs and half without hot ,but added chillies ,corn kernels as I am a vegetarian....It came out GREAT! The kids had it with mustard and I had it plain.....! The reason why we gave it 5 stars is coz of the few ingredients it needed,taste,look and ease of making. My 7 and 13 year old daughters did everything!  Oh,we did not put brown sugar  as corn bread mix IS sweet and  my 7 year old sliced the dogs....they did the batter ,dogs,batter  pattern so they turned out super!They are polishing it off while I am writing this! Thanks.this is a keeper! Meena

My kids really enjoy these little corn dog muffins.  The only things I changed was adding a bit more cheese and I made these in mini cupcake pans.  I cut the hot dogs into 8 peices and these were a great size for the kids.

These were good and easy to make. I used about a cup and a half of cheese, my corn muffin mix I used was Betty Crocker and they were 6.5 ounces, I didn't use the brown sugar and only used 8 hot dogs. I also cut my hot dogs into smaller pieces as others suggested. We all enjoyed them.

Great kid's dish!  My 2 year old son helped me make them-  It was fun for both of us and he ate 3 of them!  I thought that they would be good if for adults if you added green chiles and served with a 7 layer taco dip and chips!

Loved them!  I cut the dogs in slices first and fried them with onion till both nice and brown to bring out their flavor.  Great taste!  They were gone fast.

I am giving 4 stars because I used all of the modifications offered by viewers which was what would have knocked this recipe into the 5 star range.

I used 1 box of cornbread mix and followed those directions for making the corn bread, then I added the cheese and dogs (I used pepperjack- delish!!) 

Since I was using half as much cornbread, I did 5 dogs. I think the original proportions would probably work better as they could have used just a wee bit more batter to hold together. So next time 4.5 dogs for 1 box or 9 dogs for 2 boxes. 

I followed 1 reviewers suggestion of simply tossing the hotdog (cut into bite sized bits) into the batter after the cheese. This is definately the way to go, far easier than layering. I used about a cup of cheese and since I did about a half recipe this is really double the cheese and it was a good, unhealthy call. 

This makes an awesome party food. Next time I have a potluck, I'll buy a mini muffin tin to do them in. Way better than piggies in a blanket and significantly easier.

I wasn't too thrilled with this recipe. After reading other reviews, I alternated the batter, then hot dog, and batter again. I also sliced the hotdogs length-wise, and then cut "half moon" slices. I ended up making mini-muffins, which was a perfect size. However, they took about 25 minutes to cook, (I'll blame my old oven on that though) and out of the 4 muffin trays, 1 was cooked perfect, 2 were not even close, and the fourth was almost burnt. Even though I sprayed non-stick spray vigorously, the muffins still stuck badly to the tins. I might try this again sometime.

Made 1/2 recipe using Jiffy corn bread mix. Boiled hot dogs first to make sure they were well cooked and then cut up into bite size pieces. Put 3 - 4 pieces in muffin cup and then used an ice cream scoop to fill cups equally - almost full. Baked 18 minutes and they were perfect. Made 10 muffins. Did stick a bit even with Pam spray. Maybe should invest in a non-stick muffin pan. Anyway ... hubby LOVED these with just some mustard. Next time I'll add a bit more sugar and maybe pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar. I did add a little melted butter to the batter, so I'm not sure how much healthier they were than deep fried but def will make again. Thanks! FYI - Trader Joe's has some very good hot dogs with NO nitrates and they taste like regular hot dogs.

My kids loved these, I used paper liners and wouldn't recommend doing that, they stuck bad to the liners but we still enjoyed them anyway!  I got 18 good size muffins out of these and I slized up the hot dogs in smaller bite size pieces.  I'll make these again for the grandkids!!  Thanks!

This was a hit at a barbecue. I found bluecorn jalapeno cornbread mix at Trader Joe's, and I used vegetarian hotdogs (Morningstar makes a great one) cut in thirds. Everyone loved them, thanks for the great idea.

Very good!  Kids love.  I left out some of the cheese and made them as mini muffins.  Used box corn mix but next time I'm going to try the "Golden Sweet Cornbread"  recipe on this site.  They do turn out soft, so I recommend using paper baking cups.

I made a corn muffin base from scratch since I didn't have any Jiffy on hand, and they turned out great!  I only had a handful of mexican blend cheese left from making quesadillas, so I didn't use the full cup.  I'm sure they would have been even tastier with more cheese!  I also used a mini muffin tin and cut each hotdog into smaller pieces for bite-size corn dogs.  They looked so cute!  I'll definitely be making this again.

i used jiffy mix and because of other reviwers issues with mix sticking, I used muffin liners, that worked out well but as other reviewers mentioned, they fell apart and were too crumbly. I felt the ratio of cornbread to hotdog was too high. It needed more meat. It was tasty but a nightmare to eat and serve. We ended up eating them all crumbled off the plate. I would not make this again. I rated it 2 stars only because the taste was there but presentation was not even 1 star.

Great stuff! I made these and the sliders (another recipe from All recipes)  for my Teenage Daughters Birthday.  All the kids enjoyed them very much. I didn't change a thing. But I used Marie Calendar's Cornbread batter and used Ball Park Franks. I cut them in half and then half again and for every muffin I put 3 peices in the tin.  They were great. My neice wants me to make them for her daughters birthday too. 
Thanks Tina3031 !!

These definately reminded me of that corn dog taste but unfortunately, they fell apart. Very crumbly. Also, I couldn't taste the cheese, so what's the point. I did some as directed and some with chopped up dogs as viewers suggested. They all crumbled. I did use Jiffy mix though. IF I attempt these again, will make my own cornbread mix. These are good if you can figure out what will keep them together and moist.

These were a huge hit at my house!  Such a fun dinner or snack idea.  The only suggestion I have is to slice up the hot dogs into bite size pieces to evenly distribute them throughout the muffin.

Per other reviews, I left out the brown sugar and cut the hot dogs into smaller pieces, mixed in with the batter, but these were a definite winner with the whole family!  I'm a big corn dog fan, so being able to re-create the flavor with little cost and no mess was wonderful!

No one in my family would eat them. Including my 4 and 6 year olds that love corndogs. They picked the hot dogs out of one each and refused the rest. Sorry :(

These were interesting and fun for the kids, but just so so for the adults.  I chopped the dogs in chunks to get the meat folded into the batter evenly and even so, there was just too much cornbread.  I'll try this again, perhaps using more dogs or making smaller muffins.  This is a good snack to keep on hand in the freezer for the kids to grab when they get home from school.

So delicious!  Made really great lunches for me to take to work.  I just warmed them up for about 30 seconds in the microwave, and they tasted like they were fresh from the oven.  I cut up my hot dogs and distributed them throughout the batter, and added some finely chopped jalepeno -maybe 2 or 3 TBS.  It was the perfect amount.  It gave them a little kick without being overpowering.  I used Jiffy mix, didn't add any sugar, and just kind of eyeballed the cheese.  It's a forgiving recipe and you could do lots of variations.  It fit exactly into 18 miffin tins.  I'm not a baker at all, but they came out perfect and it was so easy.  I'll be giving this recipe to lots of friends who I think will enjoy it.  Thanks!

This is really good.  I did change one thing.  Instead of using brown sugar I used sugar free honey.  It gave it a slight sweeteness and they are really moist.  My son really likes them.  I made them in the mini muffin pan.

Delicious! We used li'l smokies, halved the recipe, and used about four ounces of Monterey Jack cheese.  It made twelve moist, tasty corn dog muffins and we ate them for dinner, are planning to eat them again for breakfast.

Made today, not great I will not make again. Used non stick spray in the muffin pans and they still stuck, what a mess to get out they all fell apart.
 You could not even taste the cheese, all you tasted was the cornbread. Recipe pictures shows hot dogs cut into pieces, yet the recipe says add 1 hot dog half into
each muffin, very strange, so this being incorrect what else of the recipe was wrong.  I wasted a lot of time making.

Good, and easy.  I'd like a bit more hot dog to muffin, but that's an easy fix.  I think the addition of cheese and sugar helps make it more corn dog like.  I used small sausages instead of hot dogs, so that could've also cut down on the hot dog part of the muffins.  I got more than 18 muffins out of this--perhaps I made smaller ones, but I really didn't want them to overflow.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy & fun! We don't eat a lot of hot dogs or corndogs at our house but I figured the kids would love these. I omitted the brown sugar altogether and I sliced the hotdogs into smaller pieces as some other reviews had suggested. I think my husband & I enjoyed them even more than the kids! Fun treat for dinner!

My 4 year old liked these, my 9 year old not as much (and she made them).  They were ok for me & my husband liked them.  We talked about the different ways to put the hot dog in to "disperse" it a little more but wanted to follow the recipe the first time.  We'll probably make these again but try some variations with the hot dogs.

This was a fun recipe to try!  I did not add the sugar and I diced up my hot dogs and mixed them into the batter.  Very good with ketchup!  My 5 and 4 year olds devoured these.  I think they'd be happy if I made them every day... lol.

Awesome! I'm eating them as I write this. Super fun and easy to make. I love corn dogs and this is the next best thing. I've made these twice and have found using cupcake liners is the best route, since mine stuck the first time. Very tasty! A keeper!

Easy and quick and tasty!  I brought this recipe to a family beach vacation and was able to throw it together with a four year old who wanted to help, and I even let him do most of the work!  I did slice the hotdogs into pieces.  It's not fancy but it pleased all the adults and kids in the house!  They were gone in a flash! Thanks!

My family loved this one.  A fun recipe for all who like corndogs.  I used Jiffy brand corn muffin mix, therefore no need to add sugar.  Also added chopped green chilis in 1/2 of the them for added kick.  Will also add as a lunch box favorite.  Thanks for the idea!

Used Corn Muffin Mix (what I had in the pantry) instead of Corn Bread. Due to the sweetness of the Muffin Mix, I cut the brown sugar way down and it tasted just like a corn dog. I can see using this again when more of the younger grandchildren/family members are here. We had mixed reviews with the younger kids really liking them and husband and older son saying they were okay. Enjoyed trying them. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have cornbread mix so I made corn bread batter, added cheese and hot dogs.  My kids LOVE this recipe (hubby does too!)  I froze some for a quick snack for the teen.  Yum!

These are WONDERFUL! My kids love them, they are simple to make, and even my husband wanted more!  One note tho, they do taste better with cheaper hot dogs (something with the grease).  :)

These are yummo as is, but you could also change things up by adding some diced onion, a dash or two of hot sauce, or even a little pickle relish to the batter before baking.  Or try serving as chili cheese dog muffins by slicing muffins in half, putting them in a bowl & covering w/chili.  WOW!  So good!!

My almost 5 yr. old granddaughter and I made these together for supper tonight.  She always wants to help me cook, so I thought this was something she could help make and would eat.  She said she would make them again, and her granddad said he would give them 4 stars.  I would only give them 3 stars, though, because they taste like cornbread and hotdogs...nothing special.  But they did make for a wonderful memory-making time!

Great recipe. I chopped the hot dogs and mixed them into the corn bread so little mouths get a bit of dog in every bite.  My granddaughter, 4, loved it.

These were awesome!!! I cut the hot dogs into smaller slices so I could put at least three pieces in each muffin.  They reheat great when wrapped in a moist paper towel. I can't wait to make this again!!!

These were good.  Used gluten-free corn bread mix and it worked perfectly.  I sliced the hotdogs and next time I'll add them right in to the dough rather them placing them in the middle.  That didn't work so well.  My 5 year old loved these!

My kids love corn bread, but they usually hate muffins.  These were easy!  They liked it better with just the cornbread or the hotdogs.  I made them for morning coffee at church and people ate them up.  No one asked for the recipe.

This is great, but, I tried something a little different. I baked them in a small cake pan like I do my cornbread. I use an oblong pan.  I sprayed pam on the pan. Put in 1/2 batter, covered it with sliced hot dogs, chopped onion and cheese, then covered with the rest of the batter.  Baked as I would cornbread and cut them in thin (about 1 inch wide by 2 inches long) "sticks" and EVERYONE just loved them. I have this requested all the time, especially in the winter.

Alright so I really don't eat many.  I can not believe how good these are. All of the kids went nuts. They are so easy to reheat in the microwave. An easy lunch for the grandkids.  I recommend these for all Mom's and Grandma's.

Didn't have cornbread on hand so I made the Basic Corn Muffin recipe from this site.  Cubed hot dogs up but other than that, made recipe just as written.  My kids LOVED them.  It was the perfect quickie-gotta-rush-off-to-soccer dinner.  Thanks!!

Probably one of the best things I've ever made for my children!  I was shocked when I had to make more right away.  They were gone in an instant!  I suggest that you double the recipe immediately, if you have children!  Thank you for the recipe!

Where's the stick?...My kids never made a sound at the dinner table...except to ask "Where's the stick?" I halved the recipe and followed almost exact, except i did not have brown sugar. I wish I would have used the brown sugar, as I think it would have given the flavor a little somthing extra. I used Jiffy cornbread mix and Oscar Meyer Weiners. I made 24 mini-muffins and cut the weiners in 5(perfect size for minis). Great and quick meal idea with mac-n-cheese. YUMMY!

These are easy to make and taste great, even cold!  Be sure to bake them directly in the muffin tins without paper liners, as my muffins got stuck to the paper horribly, but came out perfectly in the greased tins without liners.  I also cut up the hot dogs into much smaller bits to distribute them better.    These muffins don't rise too much, so don't be shy about filling the cups up almost to the brim!

Okay, so I didn't actually use the cornmeal muffin recipe on this site (because there are no cornbread mixes where I live), but I wanted to thank the submitter for this idea!!!  I use the recipe on the site for Homesteader Cornbread and add hot dogs and cheese in the muffins.  They were amazing!  Even my husband, who hates corndogs, loved them.  Thank you!

I'm sorry to say that the results from this recipe were a bit of a disappointment.  I used a Krusteaz cornbread mix which, all things considered, makes pretty good corn muffins. I chopped up the hotdogs but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully. Even though the muffins were thoroughly baked, the hotdogs had kind of a just-out-of-the-package flavor. This just didn't fill the bill for me.

I 'gotta'give a 5 star for KID FRIENDLY. EVERY one of my daycare kids loved these muffins! And, that is a rare thing! For us adults, They were pretty good, not something I would serve for an appy or a grown up party, though.

These were fantastic, actually I'm eating one while I write this!  I will never buy frozen corn-dogs again!  These are so yummy and cheap to make!  Compared to a package of frozen corn-dogs which run about $10, this probably cost not much more than $2.  I'm going to freeze the leftovers and reheat them for snacks.  The only thing I changed was substituting all whites egg substitute for the standard eggs.  I thought the milk was a little too much for the batter but I trusted you and they turned out moist and delicious!  However, I think next time I will cut the hot dogs into little chunks instead of in half.

My daughter ALWAYS peels the breading off of her corn dogs and eats it seperate from the dog. (How could I have forgotten that?!?) Having said that, I really really hoped she would love this recipe, but I should have known better. She did eat it all, though, just "seperate". I loved it, as did the husband. I took many of the suggestions and left out the sugar(might add it in next time to see the difference),sliced the dogs smaller(4 or 5 per), added diced jalapeno and onion to half of the batter, and we tried it with some honey mustard on the side, which I thought just hid all those awesome flavors. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

These are so much fun and yummy too.  I used the cheap hot dogs as suggested by others and after the first batch I chopped the hot dogs into much smaller pieces and tossed them in the batter.  They were even better that way.  What a huge hit!

Yum! I too halved the recipe. Instead of hot dogs I bought a Hillshire Farm sausage (lite) and used about half. I cut into thick slices and then quartered and added about four chunks to each muffin. Didn't have brown sugar so had to use regular sugar, everything else the same. Cooked for 18 minutes total and it made 12 muffins. SO GOOD!!! Great compliment to any soup (ate with lima bean soup).

I make these all the time but without the added sugar. I use cocktail weiners instead of full size hot dogs and two of the mini dogs fit perfectly in a standard muffin tin. I wrap them in plastic when cooled and freeze them, when my daughter gets home from school, she heats one up in the microwave and had a great fun snack.

I made these last night and they were quite yummy!  I used corn muffin mix instead of corn bread mix so I eliminated the sugar.  I also cut up the hot dogs.  Served them with yellow mustard for dipping and baked beans on the side.

We really liked these.  Like some of the other reveiwers suggested, I sliced the hotdogs first.  I'll make these again.  Even the leftovers were good when I reheated them.  Thanks bunches for sharing this easy recipe.

These are pretty good. At first I thought what's the big deal It's a corn muffin with hots dogs in it but once I got the taste it really did taste like a corn dog.

I have made this for the my toddler and 4 year old and they both love them!  Even my husband likes them so I have to remember to double the recipe.  I too cut up the hot dogs into smaller pieces.  I've also found that if I wait until they've cooled a bit, they don't stick quite as bad.

These turned out surprisingly well!  My husband and our two young children whipped these up very fast, followed the recipe to the letter, and they came out great.  None of them stuck to the pan.  The only thing we might change next time is to cut the hot dogs up into smaller bite sized pieces.

Thankd a million for such a good recipe.  The only change I made was the suggestion others had about slicing the hot dogs and adding them to the batter.  These turned out wonderful and I can have a corn dog again.  We ususally only eat corn dogs once a year at a festival because of the deep frying but lucky me came across this recipe and we can have them anytime now with out the guilt.  Thanks again for a simple tasty meal. :)

My toddler loved the muffns with ketchup of course.  I cut each hot dog in half lengthwise and then made half moons out of them. I also made half the batch and it turned out really good!

These were great. I loved the fact that I didnt need to deep fry them and the children liked the "surprise" inside the muffin. These are going to be also great for our many summer outings. Thanks so much!

These are very clever.  Had to cut back a little on the ingredients because I couldn't find 8.5 ounce packages of corn bread mix, only a 14 ounce.  I would go a little lighter on the sugar (mix may have been already pretty sweet, used Krusteaz) because it was way too sweet for me.  I  cut the dogs into smaller pieces and on the second batch added more dogs and less bread mix.  We found the 2/3 full to be too much bread and not enough meat.  They didn't look as pretty though (before I pushed the dogs down & they sunk to the bottom and the muffins came out looking like cheese muffins). I will be sure to place them in with more care next time since there wasn't enough batter to cover them.  Looking forward to bringing them to my next "treat" day at work.

Suprisingly, really good! Much healthier than frying a corn dog. I used my own cornbread recipe, rather than using a boxed kind. I also cut the hotdogs into eighths and then used half a hotdog per muffin.

I cut this recipe down to fit our small family. Also here in the midwest we commonly get 1/4 pound hot dogs from the packing plant. I substituted 2 hot dogs and cut them into bite size bites and evenly distrubuted them.  The kids loved them.

This was better than I'd expected.  I made it mainly b/c I thought the kids would like it.  I only had colby/jack cheese on hand, so I think the cheddar would have been better.  They ended up picking the hot dogs out and dipping them in catsup (as usual), but they liked the corn muffins.

I'm shocked how much I enjoyed these. Made it for the kiddos but all of the adults ate them too. I did add the brown sugar and didn't find them too be sweet and I'm not a fan or very sweet things. I suppose it depends on your muffin mix. These do make a lot. I tried it with the hotdogs cut in half and chopping them up and including in the batter. I preferred the adding them to the batter method. This is especially good if your feeding younger kids. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty, if also very unhealthy. I had a bunch of hot dogs left over from a party though, and I figured these would use them up and be easy to freeze. I left out the brown sugar, because as other posters mentioned there is enough sugar in the cornbread mix. I added one more hotdog, and chopped them up. I alternated spoonfuls of batter and hot dog bits. Next time I just may mix them into the batter. I baked 14 minutes, topped with more shredded cheese, and baked 2 more minutes. If I made them again I would be tempted to add some kind of spices or flavor to the batter.

Threw this together in between clients at the farm. Super easy and had two happy toddlers. As others suggested, I cut the hot dogs up and pushed them down into the batter. Also only had thick shredded mozzarella on hand and it worked great. Next time I will probably just chop the hot dogs up and mix them into the batter and just pour away.

I'm seriously addicted to these now! They were super easy to make. I was able to get 24 muffins out of the batter. I ended up cutting the hot dogs into thirds and it was too long, so next time I'll either try cutting them up into fourths or smaller chunks.

Great Recipe!  I diced the hot dogs for a more even consistency, and did not add any sugar.  The kids loved them for breakfast, snack and lunch.  Tried the same idea this am with chicken-apple sausage, fresh apples and cheddar cheese.  What a versatile and delicious recipe!

Wow, this was a really easy recipe and they taste great too!  My kids like corn dogs but I don't like to buy them because they have the lowest quality hot dogs and are usually greasy.  These were not like that at all.  I followed the recipe but just cut up the hot dogs into little coins and mixed them in with he batter.  They were evenly distributed. These tasted even better than the standard corn dog.  Thanks for this easy and great recipe.  Will be making these over and over!

After reading many of the reviews I made a few changes and they turned out GREAT!  Its important to note that the changes I made were based on halving the recipe - I wanted to try this first before making a whole batch.  I added 1/3 of the brown sugar, and yes I do think you need it - its that sweet/salty thing that makes a corn dog but its not sugary sweet! I added the full cup of shredded cheddar to the halved recipe - I would do that again! HERE'S THE REAL CHANGE I MADE: I added a heaping tablespoon of creamed corn to increase the moistue and more "corn" flavor - what a difference - moist and delicious - greasing the bottom of the pan is a must!  I chopped up the hot dogs to distribute the flavor and will add even more dogs next time.  I used mini - muffin pans as I wanted to use these as easy lunches for my kids - but after trying them I am also making as an appetizer for an adult party - who doesn't love a corn dog!  The four stars is only because I made changes not recommended or added in original recipe.

This was awesome!  I made a half batch just to try it and ended up making another one.  I used Oscar Meyer turkey franks to cut the fat and calories and my son and husband ate them up.  They are great for a lunch or a snack.  (I also added another tsp of brown sugar in the second batch for a little more sweet)

Okay, so, Note to self: Do not make this recipe using mini bundt pants instead of baking tins.  The result will still be delicious, and also hilarious, but it will fall apart and not be an acceptable thing to take to your boyfriend's monthly Dungeons & Dragons game.  Seriously, though, I couldn't believe how good this recipe was.  I ate two of them (even though I'm allergic to corn and suffered for it the next day).  They were amazing.  Aside from the bad pan decision, the only things I changed were using only eight hot dogs (because they come in packs of eight, and who needs seven left over hot dogs?) and I cut them up into little bites so they infused the whole muffin with hot dog beef flavor.  I had no idea you could get real corn dog flavor at home.  If you like corn dogs, you will love these.

After a little skepticism, my three kids and husband all loved them.  I will probably make a double batch next time and cut the hot dogs into small pieces.  Otherwise, the receipe itself it great the way it is!

This was a fun recipe to make with my kids. The only thing I would change, is I would cut them into numerous slices. I will definitely be making this again.

We all liked these.  I baked them and put them in the freezer for easy school lunches. I agree the sugar is a bit over the top, but I think cutting it out all together would keep the muffins from having a crisp-ish chewy outer shell. A note: it's really hard (at least it was for me) to get a half a hot dog in each muffin when chopping them up, but this is a MUST.  Otherwise there is not enough hot dog in the muffin.

kids really enjoyed these, did not add the extra sugar as my mix is already sweet enough, I cut the dogs into little slices and next time i will use a whole one per muffin as there was certainly the room for it.

I've made this many times and everyone loves it- adults and kids alike! Perfect for a Sunday afternoon football game or a quick evening treat. Yes, I've even served it for dinner with a side of baked beans and a veggie.

A big hit with adults, children and grandchildren!  I sliced the hotdogs and added them after I mixed the cornbread. Baked in a greased pan. I cut it into squares for ease in serving. Yum!

I found out about this recipe from my babysitter and loved that it's a creative way to use hot dogs. I can never seem to think of anything else than putting it in a bun. I made it for my kids but sadly one girl only liked the bread and the other only liked the hot dogs. I ended up loving them though! I make them and devour them, I sometimes try to take some to work to share with the other nurses just so I don't feel so guilty about eating them all myself!

I made these yesterday for my family and they loved them! They ate them all and then were complaining they were gone. I followed another persons advice and only used 1 1/2 tbs of brown sugar but, followed the rest of the recipe. I would suggest like others have and cut hot dogs up so they are distributed through the batter. I let the batter sit for 4 minutes after I mixed it. Stayed together and were great! Will definitely make these again:o)

These were great my boys loved them! Such a quick, easy snack to have handy. The only thing I changed was a bit of the batter (I just have my own cornbread mix my family likes) other than that I kept everything else the same...thxs so much for posting this one - it's a keeper :)

Very good!  My picky 5 year old loved them.  The only thing I would change is my own fault to start with- instead of greasing the muffin tins I used muffin cups and I've never seen a cupcake or muffin stick that badly!  Next time will definitely just grease the tins.  EDIT: 5 years later I made these again and completely forgot that I had made them before.  This time I made them for my (slightly) less picky 10 year old.  She loved them once again.  :-)

I was in a hurry and didn't have time to go to the store before my husbands poker night.  They guys ALWAYS plow through a ton of food, so I was searching for something to put out that was filling and made good use of the hot dogs I had on hand.  This was PERFECT!  The only change I made was adding diced jalapenos to the mix and chopped the hot dogs very small.  I was able to get 24 muffins and served them with a side of mustard.  They were a HIT!  And VERY CHEAP!  Great recipe!

I used one 18oz. box of organic corn bread mix--store brand. Used the recommended amount of eggs, milk, and sugar. Instead of using an entire package of hot dogs, I used six nitrate free hot dogs. Sliced the hot dogs in half length-wise and sliced into smaller pieces. Even I liked these and I don't eat hot dogs.  My kids love them for school lunches.  Also great for kid parties.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

We loved these, used healthy no nitrite/nitrate turkey dogs.  Easy to make but of course cut the half of hot dog in pieces as pictured.  No doubt the kids will love these but 2 thumbs up from 2 seniors.

This is a winner, great-tasting and easy to make. If you use "healthy" hotdogs (no nitrites/nitrates, all lean beef/chicken, etc) it can be a great, guilt-free snack or part of a light lunch.

These were amazingly simple and very satisfying! I will admit, I went the very lazy route & didn't even add the cheese to the muffins before baking. So Good. I took 1 box muffin mix & one 6count chopped up hot dogs (the cheaper the better!), and that is it. 
Next I will experiment with adding things like chilies, spices (mustard? curry? corn & jalapenos? Nutmeg?). So versatile.

The kids liked it ok, the premade Krusteaz cornbread mix I used was very sweet even though I had left out the brown sugar. Will make it again with homemade cornbread mix (leaving out the sugar). Has lot of potential though.

These are super easy to make & delicious!  You don't have to change a thing when you make them (unless you like them a little sweeter then add a tad more brown sugar)!

My husband made these for lunch this past weekend, for my lunch break from work, they were a hit!! He made a long loaf instead of muffins. My kids and I loved them!! I am going to try it with my favorite cornbread recipe and see if it comes out any better. They were a little hard in the loaf. Muffins could of been better.

Everybody loves these muffins. I make them for parties all the time. I do cut the hot dogs in little pieces and mix them into the batter. We like it better that way and the muffins won't fall apart as easy. Five stars for this one!!! Don't forget the mustard ;-)

Served these with chili at a Halloween party and they received rave reviews - from kids as well as adults!  Very good and very easy!  There were a few left over and my son took them in his lunch the next day.  I would make them again for that reason alone!  The only change I made was to slice the hot dogs into 1/2 inch slices.

This is a great way to trick a picky kid into eating dinner. Just tell them they are "hot dog cupcakes." The word "cupcake" seems to make food much more appealing.

These were a HUGE hit.  I only used a little under a tbsp of brown sugar and I think I may reduce it even more.  I used turkey jalapeno metts, skim milk, and 2% cheddar cheese with Jiffy cornbread mix. I also made mini muffins instead of full size and baked them for 12 min.  I made them for a gathering at my house along with buffalo chicken chili. The muffins got devoured.  I guess I found my new potluck dish.

My kids absolutely LOVED these! I've made them several times already, and they taste best if you cut the hot dog into smaller pieces. The cornbread to hot dog ratio is much better that way. :)

next time I make this, I would chop up more hotdogs. Don't be afraid to stuff it with hot dogs, it doesn't burn if sticking out of muffin mix. You can leave out the sugar- we used jiffy mix so it didn't need it. added pepper jack cheese (it didn't come out spicey at all) and used cheese filled hotdogs. my kids liked it but wished it had more hotdogs, I'm thinking of adding bacon bits to it next time so that you get something in every bite.

This was good way to use hot dogs when I have 4 left and no buns! I halved the recipe except the brown sugar and also chopped the hotdogs. Next time, I'm going to try using the cornbread muffin from here and just add hotdogs.

I make and freeze these when we  have left over hot dogs from the package or when hot dogs are on sale. Great quick snack or lunch. Just pull out the freezer, micorwave and some veggies for a side.

This is such an awesome recipe. I make these for my family a lot. It's a good way to use up those hot dogs in the back of the freezer. I usually cut my hot dogs into bit size pieces instead of using halves. YUM!

What a fun lunch - they tasted great and everyone in the family enjoyed them. I made a half-batch and a whole package (7) of Hebrew-National hot dogs, sliced up. It made 10 muffins. Thanks!

Hit with husband and my daughter even though they were skeptical!  I liked that they were budget friendly and easy to make.  I used oscar meyer weiners and sliced them, added to batter and scooped into muffin tins.  One tip is to make sure to let cool about 5-10 min before trying to take them out.  In my first batch I did not wait and they all stuck and came out in chunks.  For my second batch I regreased (heavier) and they came out like with ease after letting cool a bit.

Will make again.  Followed recipe with the exception of cutting the hot dogs first in half lengthwise then in smaller pieces.  Both boys (13 and 9) and Hubby liked and said would like to have again - not always a request...  I did add the brown sugar and used Jiffy brand muffin mix.  I thought they did remind me of corn dogs.  Served with soup and enjoyed.

Very easy and quick as written.  Next time I will add some sauted onions and maybe green pepper too.  I think these are great for children, but I will add more flavor next time for us "Big" people.  One more thing, I also cut the hot dogs up in smaller pieces instead of 1/2 per.  I am going to try the "Wranglers" hot dogs next time too...more zing!

Sorry Tina3031, I am not sure how this got such rave reviews.  We love, love, love corndogs but hate all the dipping and deep frying.  We had such high hopes.  We made 1/2 with cheese and 1/2 without.  Either way it tasted just like cornbread with hot dog slices in it.  All 6 of us gave this recipe a thumbs down.  Sorry :(

My son really liked these. I diced the hotdogs up into smaller pieces than the recipe called for. I added more cheese too. The turned out good, but I'd rather have the real corn dog on a stick.

Half of us liked it. My 18 mo old ate a whole himself. Probably something i'll make for a snack for just me and him. Its quick and easy.

I made these for my kids today for lunch.  I only made a half batch and wish I would have made the whole thing :)  They were gone in a "Jiffy" :o)  My oldest who loves corndogs said these were the best he'd eaten.  I followed the directions but diced up my hot dogs.  I will make these again.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't try one with the hot dog in it as I'm a vegetarian but I made one without the dog and it was so delicious!  Moist and sweet and I will always use this recipe for corn muffins in the future.

These turned out okay.  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I sliced the hotdogs into chunks and mixed them in the batter.  I did not like the pre-packaged cornmeal mix that I got.  Perhaps it was the brand (I don't remember which one right off-hand.)  If I make these again, I will try them with my mom's cornbread recipe, which is much better.  I may also brown the hotdog slices in a skillet for a few minutes as well, to give them a bit of color.

These are just the best and what a great idea! We had these with my crock-pot chili and just went great together! Followed the recipe as written but did cut the dogs in pieces. This is a keeper!

omg. delicious. So easy, we couldn't believe how good these were. I halved the recipe and used a mini muffin pan. I sliced 4 hotdogs and used 2 slices in each mini muffin. That proportion was perfect for us. I am sure I will be making these again and again.

Fantastic! I've made it twice in two days and there are none left! For these we always use the cheapest hotdogs you can find. I used both good and cheap brands and the texture of the cruddy dogs actually works better with the cornbread and made it taste more like a corn dog. We also cut ours into smal chunks rather than just half of each dog. This was so easy, super cheap and delicious! And the kiddos love helping me make them!!

i made these for my halloween party and they were a huge hit. i was surprised because of all the fancy little things i made, everyone kept telling me how much they loved these muffins. i made them in a mini muffin pan and just diced up the hot dog and stirred it in, then set out little bowls of mustard and ketchup. everyone loved them.

I thought these were yummy although I made them a little differently.  I chopped the hot dogs into bite size pieces and stirred them into the batter.  I made them for a party and everyone loved them.  I thought they were good the next day but they were much better right out of the oven!  I printed this recipe and added it to my personal recipe box so I can make them again and again and again!!!

These were do much fun! I made them for the kids I babysit and they loved them! I chopped the hot dogs into tiny and slices and mixed it into the cornmeal mixture. The kids loved them and I enjoyed them as well. I will definitely be making these again.

You may find the texture slightly different from the usual battered and deep-fried version, but it's nonetheless very similar, especially when you add mustard or relish. I used my own cornbread recipe, along with its desired number of eggs and milk. In place of the cheddar I used shredded velveeta cheese. Big hit.

These are good for a quick lunch or snack for the kids.  I ate a couple myself and thought they were good.  I just follow the directions on the back of the cornbread pouch then put sliced hotdogs in.  Next time I will put some jalapenos in there for me. yummy

I make these once a week for work lunches and easy snacks. I use the cheap betty crocker cornbread pouch. I follow directions on the pouch and then just cut up the BAR S cheap hot dogs (he more the merrier). And, I love these! In fact I am having some for lunch today. So easy and quick!

These do taste just like corn dogs! I sliced the hot dogs lengthwise, then cut off one third of the length.  Placed two slices in mini-loaf pans...fit perfectly.  They cooked in the time as stated, however, the hot dog ends curled up too much.  Still tasted good.  Will cook in mini-muffin pan next time.  Great football-watching-at-home food.  We put mustard on them.

I've been making these for years! I always mix in cheap beef franks cut up and I've never added the brown sugar. My kids love them, they request them often.  Even my 18 year old baby brother asks for them still, I started making them when he was 2.  I have always used the cheapest hot dogs in this as they do make it taste more like the real thing and the beef is for flavor not religious reasons.

I just didn't think there was anything that wonderful about it.  It's so easy to whip up a batch but pointless if only one out of five of my kids will eat and enjoy them.  I have to agree with the reviewer that said it tastes like a corn muffin with a hotdog stuck in the middle. The cheese seems to disappear when they are cooked.  It's definately lacking something.

I'm obviously in the minority...but I didn't think these were all that fabulous. Tasted like corn muffins w/ a hot dog stuck in the middle - because that's what they are. Not so reminiscent of corndogs to me or my husband.  Sorry. :(

My husband LOVES corndogs but they aren't very "healthy." I found this recipe and thought I'd try it out on him. I chunked the hot dogs as others suggested and followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. They were good but I needed to cook them for about 6 minutes longer. They are really great with yellow mustard and though I didn't much care for them (but would definitely make/eat again for quick dinner) my husband said that they were pretty good. If I do make them again, I think I will add some sweet corn and maybe some pimentos and/or jalepenos.  Good recipe, though!

I took the advice and used the cheaper hot dogs.  Forgot to mix in the cheese in the batter, so we added it to the top.  Next time I will do both.  The kids loved it.  My daughter had this as her birthday dinner pick.

I made these for my kids and they loved them but it made 18 so I had a lot of left overs.  Tonight I made chili so I took one of the left over muffins, put it in a bowl and poured chili over it.  My family loved it this way! Great way to use the left overs!

So fast and yummy!  I didnt have box of cornbread mix, so I used the recipe for cornbread off of the cornmeal box.  I did cut the dog up, next time i will just cut in half.  I just made them for a pre dinner snack for my son and hubby, but I think these might be great to throw in a lunch box or even make the over the camp fire while camping.  thanks for a fun, quick and yummy recipe ;)

Perfect for the family! I made it healthier (low cholesterol and low fat) so hubby could enjoy it as well. I replaced egg w/ egg beater and hot dogs replaced by soy dogs (cut up in small pieces). The kids (7 y.o and 2 y.o) and hubby gobbled them up!

Well ain't that conviennent. I made these a couple days ago an was just thinking I shoul review them when I see them on the front page. I made these with a hot dog lover in mind, an yes con dog enthusiast. I took this creative lil idea an used my own recipe for cornbread [[Butter Cornbread]]. He actually ended up liking them more than I thought he would, both my brothers. My parents on the other hand kinda laughed an thought it unappetizing to put hot dogs in a muffin. Meep. Anywho, it's the kids that really count in this recipe. THANKS!!

My 2 and 4 yr old kids and myself just had these for lunch and they were delicious.  I cut up the hotdog into small pcs and dumped them in w/ the batter and I liked that a lot.  I did just a little bit less brown sugar and thought it tasted very good.  I like the honey corndogs so the sweet tastes good to me.

These are a fam fav!  During busy sports season, bring them along for a quick dinner before practice!  You can control the fat/sugar content for a much healthier corn-dog fix!  What's not to luv!

I've been making this recipe for 5 years. I will say that have upgraded and started using my own homemade cornmeal mixture and have tried other meats; bacon, lil smokies, etc.. I've never had a problem. My family, especially my hubby, loves them. Since we have toddlers, I slice the hot dogs into coins, then quarter the coins. It leaves bite sized pieces for them and the hotdogs get more evenly distributed through the mix. I add the hotdogs into the tin and stir with a toothpick. :)

My 4 yo and I liked them but the others weren't big fans. I think they taste much like a corn dog and they baked through, so they weren't soggy or slimy. Easy lunch for summer break.

Excellent! I gave it a 4 because I modified it a bit.  First of all, I had corn flour and all-purpose flour on hand so I used the "Amusement Park Cornbread" (with suggested modifications).  The only extra step is taking about 1 minute to measure out the flour, corn flour and baking powder.  Saves from specially buying a corn muffin mix.    I had beef knockwurst on hand and chopped it into 4 pieces and they fit nicely in the muffin pans.  These tasted SOOO good. However, as you bite into it, the muffin tends to crumble and you end up eating the hot dog separately.  I think next time I will chop the hot dog into small chunks and mix it into the batter.  The other thing is I saved out some of the grated cheese and sprinkled it on top of the muffins.  It added a nice crunchy, flavorful texture to the muffins!

Really surprisingly good. The kids loved them and so did I. (I loathe hot dogs and only mildly enjoy a corn dog once a year or so.) They were good dipped in both yellow mustard and dijon. I did follow other reviewers suggestions and half the recipe, half again the sugar, and slice the hotdogs in half lengthwise and then slice in small chunks. I then mixed them straight into the batter. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Really good!  I just followed the directions on the package of cornbread, which was smaller then this recipe calls for, and it worked out well.  Didn't add sugar because it was sweet cornbread mix.  I made them a second time just as cornbread, cutting up the dogs really small.  They were a hit.

i love this recipe. like other suggested i cut up each hot dog in to tiny pieces and mixed them in with the batter. i bought the "betty crocker" cornbread mix and i also followed the cooking instructions on that so i added the milk and butter to make sure they didn't come out dry. i also used cheese hotdogs to give it even more of a cheesy taste. i didn't have a muffin tin so i used a square tin and made cornbread instead of corn muffins. turned out great.

These were very simple and fast to prepare...which is always a plus! Kids loved these muffins and I did too - even though I am not a corndog lover! I will definitely make these again. The only thing I did differently is that I used only 1 tbls of brown sugar...turned our perfect.

Made these for the kids tonight. Big Hit. Used 1 box of jiffy cornbread mix and halved the recipe and like others, I  also mixed my "small chopped" hot dogs in with the batter. For those who had dry muffins, I only baked mine for 12 minutes and they were 8 moist perfect Corn Dog Muffins. We even ate them w/mustard!!

Great recipe! Perfect "corn dog" taste! Loved the brown sugar addition. Since hot dogs don't come in packs of 9, I cut the recipe down to 5 hot dogs, cut lengthwise and then in pieces. I mixed the egg and milk in a large bowl. Then added the brown sugar and 1 box of Jiffy corn muffin mix. I added 1/2 c shredded cheese and the hot dogs. I poured the entire mixture in a lined 12-muffin tin. After turning golden brown (temerature and time as recipe), I broiled them on low for an additional 5 minutes. These were addicting!!!

these are very good.  my son ate 4! and he has already asked when I am going to make them again.  I only used 1 tablespoon brown sugar after reading some of the reviews.  They turned out great, however I did have to cook them about 23 minutes.  I will definitely be making these again.

Pretty good, will be made about every month. I did not put in the brown sugar, and it didn't seem like it was needed. I would suggest leaving the hot dog slices as big as will fit in the pan, I sliced them up to about 1/4 inch wide and there were some bites where you didn't get hot dog. If you want to really taste the cheese, add a little extra.

I used chicken franks and cut them into bite sized pieces.  Came out terrific!  I am not sure I'd keep the cheese in the recipe - I used a generous amount of very sharp cheddar, and could not taste it at all.  It was good, but didn't taste like it has cheese in it.  Maybe next time I will add more.

Was a real crowd pleaser...adults and kids loved it.  Everyone kept raving about them.  Nice to have a corn dog and not feel so much guilt afterwards!!!  Great, fun receipe.  Definitely filling enough to be main dish if you add some side dishes.

My children (VERY picky eaters) l-o-v-e-d these muffins. And as a bonus they are SUPER economical! We only made a half batch, which cost us less than $2 total in ingredients, and yielded us 12 big muffins. We omitted the brown sugar and used spicy mustard instead (we are a spicy/savory family), and we kept the whole cup of cheese (so I guess that technically means we doubled it...) and we cut the dogs into small pieces as others have suggested. Really tasty, easy on the budget and kid friendly. Adding it to my faves!

I'm always looking for recipes that are easy enough for my 10 year old daughter to cook by herself and that both of my children will enjoy.  Although this did not appeal to me, both of my kids enjoyed it. My daughter can't wait to make it again.

I very simple and tasty recipe. I cut it in half because I only had one box of muffin mix on hand, and it still made a dozen muffins. 

I omitted the brown sugar, used 5 cut-up hot dogs, and put in a lot of cheese. The more the better! 

I will definitely make these again, and maybe change up the recipe a little bit with some different add-ins. We're going to eat them with potato soup.

This gets five stars for many reasons: the yummy taste, the "easiness" factor and the fun my 6 and 4-year old had in making it! Honestly, I don't know if they had more fun making it or eating it. We did cut the recipe in half to get 9 muffins. We also left out the brown sugar as I didn't think it would really be necessary and I hate to add sugar if I don't have to. They had a ball whisking the ingredients and then dropping the little hot dogs into the muffin cups. I actually wasn't going to have any but they smelled and looked so good that I had to pop one into my mouth :) Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper for us!

This recipe is fantastic! Very easy and tasty! With a little mustard they are just like corn dogs at the county fair. I used the "Golden Sweet Cornbread" recipe on this site in place of jiffy mix and they turned out fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was really easy and really yummy and the family loved it! I didn't have the small packages of muffin mix--only the large bag from Costco. So I just used 3 cups of mix and followed the rest of the recipe. I did dice the hot dogs as suggested by others and it worked great! They were a big hit!

Not sweet enough, in my opinion. When I think of corn dogs, I think of a sweet honey coating. These muffins weren't sweet & they weren't fluffy. I won't be making them again.

Omitted the brown sugar as others suggested, but next time I will put it in, I think it adds to the taste, or maybe even a little chili powder.  Other than that, EASY PEASY recipe that tastes pretty good.

Thought I would love these and they were just okay.... very bland, had a strange appearance... hmmm..... may try again with different dogs and maybe add some more seasoning?  1 out of my trio liked them -- strangely the one who doesn't normally like hot dogs! Go figure!

Very quick and easy recipe... as well as affordable.  I did not use cheese and they were still yummy... my 2 year old first picked out the hot dogs to eat and then polished the muffin off.  This was a great recipe for kids - and for kids at heart.  I will be making this again - next time I will put in cheese and maybe some corn too.

I thought the kids would really enjoy these, but only one out of 6 did.  My husband and I liked them though!  I omitted the brown sugar and used a tiny bit more extra cheese.  I also used the mini muffin tin - I had a ton leftover!  Hopefully they'll freeze well.

I skipped the cheese & sugar and used some left over turkey kielbasa instead of the hot dogs.  However I made mini-muffins with a quarter inch slice of kielbasa in the center of each one.  What a great little appetizer.  Hubby couldn't get enough!

I just made these for lunch today, and they are great.  My 6 year old daughter and 2 year old boy are eating them and they are picky.  I didn't have boxes of cornbread so I made a cornbread recipe and my daughter cut the hot dogs into small pieces.

I love this recipe!  It tastes just like a corn dog, but I use fat free hotdogs, so I have none of the guilt for eating them and feeding them to my kids. It gets an A+++++  P.S. I don't alter the ingredients any, but I do cut the dogs into small pieces and mix into the batter.  Thanks for a great kid friendly recipe!

This was quick and easy to make and quite the kid-pleaser. I used cornbread muffin mix instead of bread. The cornbread muffins were just sweet enough. Omitted the cheese and still tasted great. I would like to try making these in mini-muffin pans in the future with slices of hot dogs as an appetizer.

This was great. I cut the hot dogs up into tiny pieces and increased the amount of cheese. I also used a couple of different kinds of chese. They were excellent and I will be sure to make them again. Next time I might add some cooked bacon or sausage for variation.
Since I first reviewed this, I have made them numerous times. I sometimes use smoked paprika and add soy sausage or soy chorizo (which I cook up and have in the fridge), sliced japeno's with some juice, smoked pablano peppers and other things that might make them different for everyone each time. Each time I make them they are a huge hit. It is almost a no-fail recipe and you can add to them what you would like.

These muffins were delicious.  I made them for the neighborhood kids one day after school and they were a hit.  My husband liked them too.

These just made my day...thank you!
I'm wondering if they freeze well.
A reviewer who served these at a dinner party said her guests got a laugh because they were so absurd...ummm...should someone explain the joke here.

My 4 year old son and I really liked these muffins. They were easy to make, tasty and the ingredients were inexpensive (like another review said, the cheaper the hotdog the better). They really do taste like corn dogs. They are also a bit of a novelty so the kids love them. When I made these I cut up my hot dogs into smaller pieces and I mixed them in with the batter.  I did not notice any unevenness in the distribution of hot dog piece in the muffins.

These were a huge hit at our son's birthday party!  Like others, I sliced the hot dogs up and added them right to the batter.  Used about 1/4 cup per muffin, and greased the tins well.  Also, removed immediately after baking to prevent sticking.  I was skeptical about the brown sugar, since I used Jiffy mix, so I cut it in half.  Everyone kept complimenting me on them - thanks for a great idea!

These were really good!  Here is what I did differently:  I used a little less than 1 and 1/2 cups of milk because the boxes for the cornbread only called for 1/3 cup (per box) and I was afraid it would be too runny.  I also cut the hot dogs into bite-sized pieces and mixed them right into the batter.

I made these last night and have eaten ELEVEN of them.  I took what was left and put them in the freezer in a ziploc bag.  I'm always on the go and figure they will be great to throw in the microwave for a quick snack.

Yummy...quick and easy and inexpensive to make. I cut my hot dogs into slices like the other reviewers suggested. I also used cheesy hot dogs because that is what I had available. I wish I would have had this recipe years ago when my boys were young...they still gobbled up their favorite treat when I made these the other day! Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted very good.  I used Jiffy mix and only used 1 tsp of brown sugar, but I think next time I will use the full amount because it needs that sweetness to mimic corndogs.  I cut my dogs in pieces and mixed it into the batter and that worked well.  I used a little more than 1 c of cheese.  This made about 16 muffins, each muffin is not enough for a main course though, more like a snack.  They stuck to my pans; 1 pan I used a traditional tin model, the other pan I used a silicone "non-stick" tray...both stuck. I think you need to let them cool completely and then take a butter knife and run around the edges and then gently pop them out.  I will definitely make these again.

YUM. I made these for a party and used a mini muffin pan, which turned out about 44 muffins. I used Trader Joe's corn bread mix which is plenty sweet already so I omitted the brown sugar. I also used veggie dogs. Everyone gobbled them up in minutes.

As a Southerner, I'm not a fan of sweet cornbread mixes but the idea of corn dog muffins really appealed to me because my family loves them.  I made these muffins with my simple but delicious buttermilk cornbread recipe (cornmeal mix, oil and buttermilk)and omitted the sugar.  They were delicious.

I tried a lot of the suggestions that other people made, and we were still just not a fan.  Too much bread- I just couldn't fit enough hot dogs and batter in the muffin tins to cover the hot dogs.  Not sure i will try this again

Everyone was in love! My toddler really liked these but I chopped up the hotdog bits really good for him. (and we didn't even use "real" hotdogs because we don't eat meat.) still turned out great!

So good! I did make changes though. I used veggie dogs and organic cornbread muffin mix. I just followed the muffin mix directions which used oil and water. I also put half of a fat free cheese slice on top of the hot dog pieces instead of cheddar. My four year old loved them and snuck back to eat more when I wasn't looking. Since my version is pretty healthy, I think I could make these every weekend for a fun treat.

Me and my kids really enjoyed this.  They are super easy and fun to eat.  I did chop up the hotdogs into halved coins.  My 2-year-old had fun finding them when he bit into the muffin.  "ooh, 'nutha hotdog mummy!"  :)

These were very good...I used veggie dogs instead of hotdogs and they turned out very tasty.  Had to cook them about 20 minutes longer than recipe called for.  Kept resetting timer for 10 minutes and checked for readiness.  My kids want me to make them everyday.  :)

This recipe caught my eye b/c it was original and I usually buy the frozen corndogs at the store. I made them for my husband for lunch. At first he laughed at the idea but after tasting he said they were 10 times better than any he's had! Tasted just like the real thing.

These are a good, quick 'n easy side. Great with soup! I cut hot dogs in half lengthwise, sliced into 'half-moons', and put them into the cups before the batter, as others suggested. Will be using this recipe with other types of meat too.

I made these a few years ago after seeing That Vintage Cuban Girl's review. Since then, I have made them many times. We think they are great...sometimes I use the 'baby hotdogs' (as my 3 yo calls them) found in the baby food aisle.

Not only did my sons, 12 and 14 love them, I ended up snacking on them, too!  My 14yo made them with me standing by the next time we had them and was so proud of himself. Thanks for a great recipe.  We did cut the dogs into chunks, and used a mini-muffin pan.  We evenly distributed the dogs, then covered with the mix as others had suggested.  Worked great.

It's State Fair time here, so this was the perfect recipe for us. I only had 2 hot dogs, so I sliced them, sauteed them in 3 Tbs butter in a cast iron skillet, and poured the batter over all to make it like regular cornbread instead of muffins. Very tasty--I'll try the recipe as written next time. Great idea, Tina.

My kids loved these.  Next time, I will take the 1/2 hot dog and cut it into maybe 3 or 4 pieces before putting into each muffin.  The length of the 1/2 hot dog touched the edges and had without the muffin tins I used, would have  burned.  Plus, the hot dog falls to the bottom so it's a little hard to eat too.  Tastes great though!  I used Splenda in place of brown sugar in the recipe also.

I loved these little gems. What a great flavor and too easy to make! Next time I will try chopping the hot dogs but they are also just fine as is. I made these to accompany the "Cinncinnati Skyline Chili" recipe on here and they were perfect together. I can't wait ti make them again. Everybody loved them! Good job Tina!!!

Made my muffins from scratch, used apple chicken sausage (didn't have any hot dogs).  I used a stone muffin pan, which I preheated with the oven.  I put about 1/8 teaspoon of bacon grease in the bottom of the hot pan before filling.  I made a double batch; the first batch I put the muffin batter down first, then the chopped sausage on top.  Second batch I put the sausage down first, then the batter.  Either way worked- when the sausage was on the bottom, it fried a little, and when on top, it weighted the top of the muffin down (which was fine).  I think ideally you'd put half the batter down, then the sausage, then the rest of the batter, but I'm unable to do this with a hot stone pan, as I have to work very quickly.  Five stars just for the idea (and they taste amazing, too!)!

Jiffy corn muffin mix, mini hot dogs.  Fill mini muffin pans two thirds full. Stick the hot dog in the middle and bake. No cheese. Regular corn dogs don’t call for cheese. Original recipe, but nothing wrong with switching it up to your liking! Delicious

These have been a fantastic after school snack for my kids, and they take them in their lunches also. Excellent idea. You can barely taste the brown sugar in the recipe. I would leave it as is. Are used mini muffin tins, and had to get out a regular muffin tin pan because I still had some of the mixture left. So this made quite a few mini muffins and eight regular size muffins. Also, I only had five hotdogs. So I slice them lengthwise and then into small pieces and added a few to each corn dog mixture, and it was plenty. I think nine Would be way too many but that’s just my opinion. Five was fine. I added some Monterey Jack cheese, just because we like Monterey jack cheese. And some cheddar as well. This is a forgiving recipe, and they’re really very good. Mine stuck just a little bit but it’s because I took them out of the tin too fast I think.

When all is said and done, these are darned good.  WARNING:  1-1/2 Cups of milk turns this into soup.   (In reading the Jiffy instructions, they call for much much less milk--if I ever make them again I will start with 1/3 C .) I had to add in extra cornmeal and flour to thicken it up, so probably mine did not taste quite as good as they should have if made with all Jiffy.  I also cut my wieners into slices, then into fourths, and pan fried them for that lovely brown flavor, then mixed them into the batter. ALSO, I found they needed to cook quite a bit longer than recommended, 20-25 min.   But the size and flavor were darned good, considering!

Overall these muffins were liked by everyone; however, the general consensus was “no hotdogs”.  The cheese was a perfect addition!  Definitely worth a try with picky eaters.  So easy.

These things are awesome! Made a half batch. I forgot the brown sugar though. Didn't miss it but I'll do one tsp. next batch. I also went with a half cup of 1/2&1/2 instead of the 3/4 cup milk. It's like being at the MN state fair without having to smell the dumpster juice or deal with the bees. It made 10 muffins and still cost less than one corn dog at the fair! %^J

Wow, I must be missing something.  These weren't that tasty, and there was too much liquid.  They crumbled coming out of the pan.

Made a trial run of these to make for the grands on Easter. I didn't add the sugar since the boxed mix already has enough sugar in it. Great corn dogs without the frying, grand-pop approved.

Fun and delicious! I used a gluten free cornbread mix, so I needed more milk than what is written. I also added some corn and minced jalapenos. Thank you for the recipe.

I supervised my grandkids, ages 10 and 8, making this recipe.  The recipe was well written with language they understood, and it was not too complicated.  We did add 2 more hot dogs than called for and they sprinkled the cheese on top of the muffins as some of the group didn't like cheese with this. They very much enjoyed this and felt proud they could make corn dogs at home.  The kids and grandpa loved the taste!

Added extra cheese (because there's no such thing as too much cheese) and used an 8 x 8 baking dish as I couldn't find my muffin tin.  Layered the batter then hot dogs finishing with batter. Turned out great. My grand daughter loves them and we like them too! I'll be making these a couple of times a month, probably.

This was really good. Used Jiffy corn muffin mix.I made mix according to package. Idid add sugar it is needed.  I didnt have brown sugar so i substituted white sugar with a squirt of maple syrup.( a proven substitute).  I took it to a quilt guild meeting of older ladies. Some asked for recipe. I did not put in cheese. that didn't seem like a corn dog to me. Excellent. will definitely be making again. especially good for puzzle night!

Very easy to make.  Substituted mozzarella instead of cheddar since that is all I had at the time. Tasted great! Love this recipe.

What a great idea!  I made the cornbread from scratch as suggested by another reviewer .  It's hard to find boxes of cornbread mix in Spain.

This is an interesting twist on the corn dog. Although I didn't use 9 hot dogs and I used cupcake liners. I believe the next time I make it I won't use the liners. I also, believe that if you use shorter hot dogs you would need the 9 hot dogs. I used my favorites Hebrew National and I used only 1 package. I did enjoy them and would make them again. ??

Made this today with Jiffy brand corn muffin mix & didn't add the sugar.  Made half a batch without cheese, but the other half with cheese turn out much better!  And came out of the pan easier.  12 minutes for mini muffin size. All were very tasty!

Great recipe! I have made these twice now and they taste great! Perfect quick dinner when you are on the go! I sliced my hotdogs up so it would be easier to spoon the batter into the muffin cups! Taste great reheated too! Will def make again!

I've made this a couple of times.  I neglected to review it.  It's a great recipe.  Easy to make, quick and tasty.  These muffins are like a guilty little pleasure you don't want to share-but of course you have to. Needless to say I really liked them and will make again.

Muffins were very good. I didn't add the brown sugar, and I am glad I did. They were plenty sweet enough with the Jiffy mix I used. I also cut up the hot dogs, and stirred them into the batter instead of halving  them. One package of 8 hot dogs was plenty. I didn't feel opening another package for 1 hot dog was needed.

Tastey and very easy/simple ingredients. I brought this to my child's potluck at day care - a hit and it was something other than a dessert/veg crudite. I followed the recipe except I diced the hot dog and folded in with the cheese. Not sure but perhaps the brown sugar might help cut the saltiness of the hot dog? Will try without sugar next time. I will use this recipe again as a base for a corn muffin and, like the previous reviewer who used olives/jalapenos, I will experiment it with other additions (veggies, cheeses, bacon, even corn etc.) Go for it, this recipe will come in handy !!!!

I've made this numerous times now. It so easy peasy and delish! I don't know why I never though of adding cheese to them before I found this recipe. I just slice up the hotdogs and mix them in with the batter.

This was GREAT!!  My kids (5 and 6 years old!) LOVED these!  I DID make a couple teeny changes: Instead of the shredded cheese - I took the hot dogs and slit them and put American cheese (cut into 1/4" slices) into the length of the dog, then sliced the hot dog (with cheese) into bite-sized cuts and submerged three pieces into each muffin.  I also pureed about 5 baby carrots and mixed that into the mixture.... Kids'll never know they're eating VEGETABLES?!  ;-)  I think next time I'll add yellow squash AND carrots!  (the green veggies are pushing it when it comes to sneaking them! - too noticeable!)    Thanks for the idea - great for school lunches and my picky 5 year old is asking for more!

GREAT!  Even the 4 yr old ate them!!  Changes: cut the recipe in half & cut the hotdogs into small pieces.  Used sharp cheddar but probably could have left it out if I hadn't had any.

I've been making these for a few years now, and my kids get so excited when I do. The change I make is by following the directions on my cornmeal package for making the muffins from scratch. Sometimes I'll add 1/2 can canned corn to the mix too.

I have made these a couple of times and the whole family loves them.  I make mini muffins and slice the hotdogs up.  I put about 3 little rounds in each muffin.  They turn out perfect!

I made a half batch, but used the full pack of hot dogs (8 of them) and probably less cheese than was called for because I mostly forgot about it, so I had to just mix some cheese into the remaining batter I was using to top them. I did not use any sugar, because Jiffy mix is sweet enough already. I cut my hot dogs into small bits (like I would for beans & franks) and layered them between two layers of batter. I also pre-cooked my hot dogs to get rid of some of the grease. The muffins kind of wanted to split down the middle, so I think next time I will probably just do like the recipe suggests and put a half a hot dog in each muffin cup--less chance of it falling apart that way I bet. Thanks for the recipe--probably the tastiest way I've eaten hot dogs in many years.

These were really quick and easy to make and they tasted pretty good ( giving them 5 stars for the quickness ). My kids wouldn't eat them but all the adults did! They do taste similar to corn dogs. I followed recipe except chopping 6 hot dogs, because I thought my kids would be eating these. I will make them again when I need a quick and easy snack or quick and easy dinner. Thanks!!!!

These were pretty good, but I give them four stars because they are KID FRIENDLY!  Hubby liked them too.  I made a bunch of regular size muffins, and a few large ones.  I did have trouble getting some of them out of the tins.  Didn't matter to my stepdaughter who told me she'd eat them as often as I will make them, and she hopes it is often!

Sadly, they are unappetizing. I enjoy cornbread but I would have to make it myself since boxed cornbread contains so much sugar. It's less like a corn dog and more like a muffin with chunks of hot dog in it. Maybe adding more meat would make it better? An alright attempt at a classic though!

I didn't notice that the cornbread mix I got only needed water, so perhaps that's why I didn't think these were great. My toddler wouldn't touch them, either :( I will try them with a different mix next time. Hopefully they'll be better. **Update** I tried it with a different mix and they turned out a lot better! Kids at work really enjoyed it!

I give it 4 stars- My son and his boxer give them 10 stars!!! I made mini muffins- Made 66 minis and used a 1# of wieners- When I started first 24 muffins I did not put in brown sugar- The mix I used had sugar, but after tasting them I added the brown sugar! Definitely needed it!! I also would add more cheese- could not tell it was there- thanks

I loved this recipe much more than corn bread, or store bought corn dogs.  The sugar was a perfect touch for my taste and although I couldn't specifically taste the cheese the bread was a nice texture and yummy.  I was concerned about the cheese because store bought cheesy corn dogs are nasty!  Next time I will just cut the hot dogs into small pieces.  This time I cut them into 8ths and slid the long thin slices into the dough but they just fell down anyway.  I like having a hot dog for each bite.  They did crumble terribly if I wasn't really really careful getting them out of the tin so next time I will add more cheese and be more careful.  Also the dough was a little gooey right around the dog from juices.  I think this would be helped with smaller hot dog slices.  My husband enjoyed them too much because we didn't have as many leftovers as I had hoped, and my 1 year old was an awesome sport and ate almost 2 muffins.  Clearly the muffins were delicious for children of any age, and a picky pregnant woman.

These were pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I cut the hot dogs into little cubes. My husband LOVED these so I'm giving it 5 stars. I'm not a corndog person, but I thought they were okay. They are an awesome idea fo0r kids. My girls are 18 months, so they didn't show a huge interest in them yet, but I'm keeping the recipe on hand for later!! Thanks!

Followed the recipe, except I halved it.  I used my mini muffin tin, Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix, and Cheese hot dogs in 1/8 slices.  This was pretty good!  Perfect mini corn dogs!

Yummy! Okay guys, learn from my mistake if you're gonna cut the dogs up smaller and mix them in with your batter. Just make sure you get a good little batter base in each cup before letting in any hot dog pieces. Mine are yummy but they're all tearing up trying to pull them out of the pan because some of the dogs were at the bottom. If I make these again I think I'll leave the hot dogs just one half right in the middle, as instructed. I think this would taste better and be cuter, to me...  Also, turkey hot dogs work good for reduced fat and calories!

Made this a surprise for the kids. They loved it. I needed to use up left over hot dogs from a camping trip so this worked out great. I did not use corn bread mix but actual corn meal. I took the dry ingredients in a recipe to make corn bread and then followed the rest of the corn dog murffins recipe. I liked that I could control the sugar content. Hot dogs are already full of fat and fillers; adding sugar is not my idea of a meal you wont to give your kids.

The Corn Dog Muffins were very good. I only made half the recipe, and I didn't put the brown sugar in it as we don't like sweet corn bread. Don't use paper baking cups in your muffin tins because they don't come off very easily when the muffin is hot. After they are cooled, the baking cup comes off easily.  I fixed these for a quickie supper and served them with canned soup.  Very satisfying.  Thanks for this really easy recipe.

They stick to the pan! But they're good.  After reading the reviews I omitted the sugar, doubled the cheese, used cheap hot dogs and cut them into slices and added a chopped jalapeno to half the batch.  All good.  I got 24 muffins.

Well, I tried making this twice.  I used Jiffy corn muffin mix both times and simply made the muffins according to Jiffy's directions.  (Their directions call for less milk.) I added the cheese and brown sugar, but that seemed a waste, because I didn't really taste either one.  I could've left them out, probably.  I took someone's tip and bought cheap all-beef hot dogs.  In my first attempt at these, I sliced them up.  They turned out okay that way.  A little crumbly.  I then wanted to see if I could make them really reminiscent of a corn dog.  The second time I made them, I halved the hot dogs and put one in each muffin tin as the recipe suggested.  And I made sure to go easy on the corn muffin batter, so they wouldn't - as one reviewer said - taste like a "corn muffin with a hot dog stuck in the middle."  With both of my attempts at making these, the muffins crumbled too easily.  You definitely have to eat them with a fork on a plate if you don't want to make a mess.   With many forkfuls, I just ended up dipping bald hot dog in ketchup and eating crumbled muffin fragments by themselves.  (I considered that maybe the reason they crumbled was because I used the Jiffy recipe, and that maybe the extra milk this recipe calls for are what makes them more dense.  I don't know.)  Overall, they tasted fine.  But I don't think I'll attempt this recipe again.  It just isn't that amazing.  Both times, I just wished I'd had regular hot dogs instead.

Did not enjoy this recipe BUT could be alot better in mini muffin tins with cut up hot dogs. I used regular sized muffin tins with a 1/3 of the hot dog in it. Way too much corn muffin for my taste. Boyfriend liked them.

I thought these were really cute and would be a great party snack. I made my second batch with extra seasonings (similar to the southwest corn pups on AR). Sadly, my two year old wouldn't take one bite. She's so picky. Maybe she will like them later.

My stepdaughter loved these.  I just read off the ingredients and let her do all the work. I 1/2'ed everything b/c I didn't want a ton of leftovers in case they weren't good. It made 6 normal sized muffins and she asked to take the one leftover muffin to school for lunch.  I'd like to make these for a football party I'm having this weekend but I want to find a muffin pan that is a bit smaller but not the mini muffins.. I think it would be better for appetizer sized portions.

Delicious and loved by young kids and the young at heart.  Recipe easily cut in half.  And like a lot of other reviewers, I slice up the hot dogs...at first so kiddos wouldn't choke and now because we love the surprise of a frank in a bite.  They are DELISH.

It seems like such a bad idea, but they were so good with mustard and ketchup. I didn't use the brown sugar.  And left out the cheese and used soy milk as I have a dairy allergy.  I can't believe I liked these! I felt like I was at the fair.

Love this idea.  I did cut back the brown sugar to 1 T. and might leave it out entirely next time, since the corn bread mix already has sugar in it.  And as others suggested, I sliced the hotdogs so there was pieces of hot dog in every bite.

These were pretty good.  The recipe made more than 18, but I didn't cut the hot dogs up in small pieces.  It would've been better to cut them in small pieces, because the breading just fell off when you tried to pick it up.  Really good flavor, though.

These are yummy.  I recommend cutting the hot dog into several smaller pieces and putting 3-4 pieces in each cornbread mixture.

I'm a poor college kid so this was cheap to make and still tasted great! Leftovers are even better. I cut the recipe in half since I was only making it for myself. And I definitely didin't use brown sugar! Turned out great!

These were good.  My kids thought they were cool.  My 17 year old thought they were especially good. I added a jalapeno ring to some of them to give them a little kick.  Next time I may add some canned corn (drained). thanks ~

I think Jiffy makes the best and I have tried both leaving the hot dog pieces large and cutting them up kinda small and the Smaller pieces were WAY better! These are super good, I like to make it with "Insanely Easy Vegetarian Chili" from this site!!

My kids just loved these. I liked them because they were easy to make. I'm not a big fan of hot dogs, so I didn't try any, but I trust my kids judgment! The only change i made was using less hot dogs (4) and mixing them into the batter.

Yummers!  I think the brown sugar is what gives it the corn dog taste.  I made mini muffins and had a little trouble getting the batter evenly distributed.  Next time I think I'll do as others have done and chop the hot dogs into smaller bits and mix them with the batter.

These are o.k.. They are a little too dry using boxed corn bread mix. I would like to look for a creamier corn muffin recipe next time I try this. I would also cut up the hot dogs so the flavor is in every bite.

It was okay. The kids ended up picking out all the hot god anyway. I, on the other hand LOVE corn bread and hate hot dogs. So it was the opposite for me. I think it tasted good however.

This is SO good. I used turkey hot dogs to increase the health factor. I made these for my husband and now he asks for them OVER and OVER! Then I made them for my dad and he loved them too. The only other thing I changed in the recipe is that I chopped up the hot dog. Basically your kids, husbands, and yourself will love these easy little muffins!

My daughter loves this recipe!  For me it makes two muffin pans worth.  I like to cut up the hotdogs into small bite sizes.  I haven't changed the recipe at all however it has made me think of other things I could make using my muffin tins other than muffins.  I use Archer Farms bakery-style Honey cornbread mix (Target carries it). I bought two packages as they are both 14.25oz and used a portion of one and all of the other.  Have made two batches and they come out perfect each time. Thanks for the great recipe.

Well I completely forgot to add the brown sugar.... but these turned out really good!  I don't think they necessarily need the sugar, but next time I will add some just to see. We can't taste the cheese AT ALL in the finished product, and that's with an extra 1/2 cup or so. Not sure if the cheese was all that necessary either.  I ended up with 36 mini muffins and 6 regular sized ones.  I cut up 8 hot dogs into thirds, then chopped even smaller from there. (by the way, since when do hot dogs come in packs of 9???)  The minis have about 1/6 hot dog in each one, the regulars ended up with about 1/3 hot dog in each.  I would give these 4-1/2 stars if I could...Very yummy, will be making again! THANKS!

The kids loved these... as for us adults- they were just okay. They do not need the extra brown sugar- they were very sweet. I'll make these again for the kids while my husband and I have something else.

These are absolutely delicious!  I made them twice in a week because they were such a hit.  Super easy to make, and taste BETTER than any regular corn dog I've had!

I made these in a mini muffin pan.  My kids gobbled them up.  This was an easy and inexpensive recipe.

These were really good and very easy. I cut the hot dogs into pieces because my son is 2 and i was worried about him choking. He Usually LOVES corndogs but didnt like these so much not sure what that was all about. But husband and i enjoyed them.

Great recipe!  I used mini muffin tins and cut the hot dog in 1/8ths.  I will try it again soon.  This time I will cut the hot dog in small cubes and stir it in the batter.  I will be making it for young children.

This was a yummy, very easy recipe.  I think my husband ate 5 of them (he even tried one with mustard and he said it was good...).  I cut up the hot dogs - it made 21 muffins.

These were good.  I'm a big corn dog lover. The first muffin I ate I thought these don't taste like corn dogs but by the 3rd I thought they did! I sprayed the tins lightly with Canola oil spray and had no sticking but the muffins were very crumbly like other stated.   I used Jiffy mix but might experiment with others to see if I can get the recipe up to 5 star.

I'm going to have to give these just an "ok".  I will eat what I made but I won't be making them again.  They did remind me of a corndog, sort of.  My biggest problem was they fell apart.  Maybe that was something I did wrong.  The batter seemed a little runny, to me.  The flavor wasn't bad and I didn't think they were too sweet.  Just nothing to write home about!

They were very easy to make.  Kids didn't go crazy over them like I thought they would, but all in all a good treat.  I liked them anyways and probably at 75 percent of them!  There goes my diet.

Yum AND Fun! I used Jiffy cornbread mix which is already pretty sweet so the sugar wasn't necessary.  Kids and hubby loved it.  I can't wait to make more and put it in their lunches for school. (Warm it up and put it in a little thermous).  Great party or playdate food.  Thank you.  I only wish my Dad, who loved corn-dogs, was still alive to try it.

My hubby & I love these!  They are great for a quick dinner and also work good to keep around for a quick snack.  I always cut up the hotdogs into small chunks and mix directly into the batter.

I was sceptical about this recipe at first, but thought I would try it.  My kids LOVED it!!  They want me to make it again!  I used paper liners and would not suggest it.  I think I may use a 9 x 13 next time and see how it turns out.  Otherwise the taste and texture were a hit for my kids.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very creative idea, my kids ate them up as an afterschool snack! My husband thought they were too dry. I also chopped the hot dog up, maybe that was the difference.

My family ate this all up!  I cut the hotdogs into thirds for the regular size muffin.  I also cut the hot dog into fourths for a "mini" corn dog muffin and the children were so delighted!  I had NO leftovers!  This was so simple to make - this is MUST MAKE AGAIN recipe!  I love the fact that there is NO FRYING!  Healthier all around.  Thank you!

Delicious! Especially with a bit of pepper jack cheese mixed in with the cheddar! I made my usual corn bread recipe instead of a mix. Tastes surprisingly like corny dogs, especially when accompanied by mustard or ketchup. A fast, fun dinner.

very easy recipe.  The only change I made was I sliced up the hot dog into smaller pieces instead of putting a whole half of a hot dog into each muffin.  Even my picky 4 year old loved this, which says a lot. This was a quick and easy recipe that everyone loved.  I will be making these many more times.  Thanks for posting a recipe that my whole family enjoyed.

Great recipe!  I used vegetarian hot dogs and it was delicious.  I also filled the muffin cups full and gave them 22 minutes baked time.  It was easier to remove the delicate muffins from the pan after they cooled for 5 minutes.  I will definately make these again. Thanks for sharing!

this is a bit low-brow but SO good! I cut the hot dogs up into slices and was happy with how they turned out. Absolutely yummy right out of the oven, my husband said they weren't as good the next day. These wood be perfect for a little kids party and could be modified using veggie or vegan hot dogs.

I had to improvise b/c I was looking for a recipe for what I had on hand, so I used Canadian Bacon instead of hot dogs and a mix of cheddar and jack cheeses.  I liked the mix, making it a little more mellow.  The kids ate them all!

Pretty good. I cut up the hot dogs since my son has a bad habit of shoveling food in his mouth! I thought they were pretty good, but my daughter asked if I could make the muffin with the hot dog on the side!

The kids liked them. They really stuck to the pan until they were too cool to really enjoy the hot dog but then I don't really like hot dogs.

This is really good when you want an alternative to regular corn dogs.  To make it healthier, I used fat free hot dogs and egg beaters.  I also added a half cup of grated onions for extra flavor.  Doesn't even need ketchup.

These were such a hit!!! They were gone in minutes, and they're WAY better than frozen corn dogs!! Worth the extra 2 minutes to whip them together..I finely diced my hotdogs and mixed them into the batter before putting them in the muffin tins.

Really really good!  Very simple and easy to make, though next time I will probably spoon a bit of batter into the muffin pan then add the cut up hotdogs the the rest of the batter and a bit more of the hot dog pieces.  
I took some of these fresh from the oven into work so a few of my co-workers could have some.  They all raved!
Of course my kids loved them too!

I thought this was just OK. I used the cornbread muffin mix which I assume is the same thing since the serving size was 8.5 oz but it turned out very plain. I thought it was a great idea, but I wasnt crazy about the texture or flavor.

These turned out great! I followed recipe part exactly, though I did cut the dogs in inch long chunks and put two or three in each muffin. The ones with three were better! I thought the brown sugar added something that was needed.
I did use cheaper hot dogs, as other reviewers suggested, and they stuck well to the batter once cooked. I would add more cheese next time, or just omit it; We didn't taste it at all.

I had a large package of hot dogs to use and was trying to find a creative way to prepare them.  I made this at a dinner party and they turned out dry, but were at hit at the party because it was so absurd.  Everyone tried one, and got a really good laugh, but no one said they were good.  I have a feeling that if they are requested again it will be for the comedic satisfaction and not because they were very appetizing.

Not bad! I didn't have corn bread mix so I just used my corn bread recipe I have and added the hot dogs to it. Not something I would make often, but will make again on a rainy day.

This recipe was a hit!  I made these for my stepson's school lunch and they ate them up very quickly!  I did change the recipe slightly by cutting the hot dogs up and mixing them in the batter and used a mini muffin pan instead of the large.  Great treat for the kids!

Well my family loves these! So easy and cute too. I halved the recipe for us, used only one box of muffin mix and it was just right for us, they ate them all and said 'you have to make these again' I used the lil smokies and stood them up- 3 into each muffin. They ate them with ketchup, just like a corndog.

Just took these out of the oven and gave one a quick sample!  VERY GOOD!  I cut the recipe in half and I used skim milk, b/c that is all I ever buy & they were perfect.  I sliced the hot dogs and mixed them all in the batter.  Halving the recipe made 10 full size muffins.  Serving these with some lima bean soup...YUM!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are really good. Great for when I don't feel like frying. I cut the hotdogs up as suggested and they worked great!****Update**** Made these with a bit of a twist. I subbed Johnsonville Italian Sausage for the hotdogs. Very nice and added a great kick of flavor!

Great recipe! I used cheddarwurst instead of hot dogs for extra cheesy flavor, was delicious. These are even good cold... when re-heating leftovers, make sure to crisped under the toaster-oven or broiler-- yum! Perfect for picnics or camping.

this was pretty yummy.  next time i will cut my hot dog halves into strips and arrange evenly in the muffins so there is more hot dog in every bite.  This was a fun idea and my kids liked it alot.

In taking the advice of other reviewers, I cut the hot dogs in bite sized pieces. I halved the recipe, only used 2 hot dogs, and used 1 cup of Colby jack cheese instead of cheddar. It still made 12 muffins. 

My husband and 7 year old do not like cornbread muffins. To help disguise the cornbread, I plated 2 of them, and poured hot dog chili over them. (1 can Vietti hot dog chili, 2 T ketchup, and 1 t mustard, cook on med heat until hot) My husband said "You know I don't like cornbread", but he ate both of his and said they were different, but really good. My 7 year old asked if we could have them for dinner one night this week. I tasted them with and without the chili, and liked them.

i just wasn't impressed with these. we ate them, but my five-year-old picked his apart. they didn't taste like corn dogs, that's for sure. with some modifications, these could be a lot better, but as is, they are just boring. i will probably not make them again.

Very nice! I'm a vegetarian, so I skipped the
hotdogs, and added chives and green onions instead. It turned out fabulous.

I didn't really think they were the best but my 3 yr. old picky son thought they were great so that's all that matters. He ate the whole batch himself and wanted more, IMMEDIATELY. I would consider them more of a "kid-food". The 2nd batch I did I put the cut up hot dogs in the muffin cups before putting in the corn muffin mix. It seemed to work out better, atleast for me.

I wasn't a huge fan, but I've made these for two kids' parties and they ate them up! I took the suggestion of cutting up the hotdogs and making mini muffins. Definitely a kid recipe keeper.

I made these using the box cornbread mix which I bought just to make these, but next time I will just use my own cornmeal/flour recipe. These were good, we had them with baked beans and mac & chez. Only thing I did was chop the hot dogs roughly, and just folded them in the cornbread batter. My kids enjoyed these with honey mustard. Nice for "Kids Nite".

These were good. Next time I will add some chopped green chili for a little more flavor.

Not great.  The muffins were good corn muffins, but didn't go right with hot dogs.  Interesting idea though.  May try again with chili and make a cassarole.

My daughter and I didnt like these, hubby and son did. I do like corn dogs. But I would have rather just had the hot dog and muffin separatly. Also I couldnt taste the cheese. I halved the recipe since I only had 1pkg muffin mix, but used 2/3c cheese. I probably wont make again.

These turned out great and my kids love getting them in their lunches.  A great way to get some protein in a lunchbox without a sandwich.  Thanks!

These were wonderful!  Me, hubby, our two year old, and our five year old love them.  I followed the recipe exactly and I got 24 good sized muffins.  I also cut the hot dogs in to little peices before adding them to the muffin cups.  They did not stick at all, you just have to let them cool for about five minutes first.  I also added jalapenos to half of these and they were great like that too.

This is such an easy and fun recipe.  My daughter loves these when she comes home from school and so does my husband actually.  I add some broccoli and a salad and we have a quick yummy dinner.

I used 2 hot dog piece per muffin and it was great!  This is a staple recipe in our house-- quick, easy, fun and cheap!

Great idea for kids.  If you want to make your life simple buy a corn mix instead of making the batter from scratch.

My whole family loved it!  We served this up with some seasoned fries and ketchup and that's it.  I'm thinking it could be fun to serve at a kids party.

I never had a corn dog before but I did have some Jiffy Complete mix and some hotdogs I needed to cook, so I gave it a try.  I did not have anything to compare the taste to but I thought they came out pretty good.  I put the hot dogs in the muffin tray first and then spooned the batter on top, kind of smoothing to coat. They were very short muffins but the surrounded the whole hotdog well.  The batter was just sweet enough and they were delicious with mustard to dip.  Unfortunately, my 4 year old daughter picked the hotdogs but she did say that she liked the  batter...it just looked to unsual for her to eat!
