I just put a whole bottle of chili sauce and a whole bottle of grape jelly together and put in a pot on the stove or in a slow cooker. If it gets too thick, I add some water. I do leave out the lemon juice. Everyone loves these. This has been a recipe I have been making for two decades. Use store bought frozen meatballs as a timesaver.

These meatballs are great! I also use a whole bottle of chili sauce and a bottle of jelly. I add of few spoons of the already prepared minced garlic though for that extra kick. I also use Mama Lucia's frozen meatballs. I place all of the ingredients in a slow cooker or even a large pot (glass) and let it simmer for 3 hours. My family loves them and I have a request to bring some for appetizers for Thanksgiving!

This sauce is wonderful! I served it with store bought meatballs and I couldn't keep enough of them for our Christmas Eve family get together. Now I have requests for the recipe, and my daughter is even requesting it for a college graduation party.

I have been making this family favorite for more than 20 years!  Usually I buy frozen meatballs, a whole jar of grape JELLY and a whole bottle of CHILI sauce.  Throw it in a crockpot on low for 5 hours or so and it's ready to eat! I have also served this with noodles for a meal.  The ingredients don't sound too appetizing together, but boy, is it ever delicious!  Enjoy!

These are the best meatballs & SO easy to make! Everyone loves these! I gave this 4 starts because I make the meatballs with chopped onion, breadcrumbs, egg & salt & pepper just to give them a little more flavor. I also add more chili sauce. These can be browned & then put in the crockpot with the sauce to simmer on low for 3-4 hours. YUM!!!

I use Cocktail sauce and store bought meatballs, but buy the premium meatballs, not the ones with a lot of fillers or they'll be mushy. This is a tip I received from an employee at Gordons Foods.  This recipe is one my family and friends request all the time.

I used store bought meatballs and used one jar of Chili Sause and one jar of grape jelly with a tad of lemon juice in a crock pot and they turned out great.

Delicious recipe. I agree with others who use frozen/pre-cooked meatballs. They worked just fine. I used 2 lbs. of meatballs so I doubled the recipe.  I have made them twice now and I have concluded that they taste better the next day. Cook a day ahead and place in the fridge overnite to "marinade."

To make enough for a crowd, use a large bag of frozen mini meatballs.  Pour them (frozen) into your crockpot, and in a separate bowl, mix a 32 oz., jar of grape jelly with 3 jars of Heinz chili sauce.  When it is completely mixed, pour over meatballs and cover.  Cook on low for 4+ hours.  This takes a few minutes of prep, and it smells wonderful as your guests arrive!

The sauce is good, but next time I wouldn't bother to make the meatballs, I'd just use ones from the store as well.

Great, easy recipe I have used again and again when I need a filling dish. I take it in a crockpot to potlucks and the meatballs disappear every time. Definitely use extra chili sauce and grape jelly.

I read what the others said and omitted the lemon, and used store bought meatballs. I was not sure what type of chili sauce so I used a sweet chili sauce. It was delicious!!

When we make this we usually use grape jelly and bbq sauce in equal amounts, but this was good too! I also left out the lemon juice.

I have made this for years and it is very good. I have always called them "Grape Meatballs" so people will raise their eyebrows and be skeptical. Then they taste it and enjoy it. 
I sometimes put a few crushed saltines or breadcrumbs in the meatballs and it does not change a thing (I do this when I have saltines or breadcrums to use up).
I serve these as a main course over saffron rice or wide Amish noodles and they are always a hit.

Easy and delicious.  I measured the jelly and chili sauce and then added a little more jelly.  Used pre-made meatballs.  Makes a lot of meatballs.

My family and friends love this recipe when I make it. I always am asked to make this for special events and holidays. I make my own meatballs instead of the prepared ones. I love to cook and make homemade food but the frozen one's are probably just as good. Love this recipe.

I had to try this, because I couldn't imagine how grape jelly and chili sauce could make something palatable. It didn't. The twang bites your tongue. The grape jelly even smells funky cooking. Use one of the recipes that steers clear of the grape jelly.

I made this tonight for a party I'm having tomorrow night, and it's hard to keep my hands off of them till then! I followed another reviewer's advice about making them the night before and refrigerating them overnight to let them 'soak', so to speak. I also used frozen all beef meatballs, and it tastes great! I also added a dash of ground red pepper, as I like things a little spicier. Definitely try these!

This is a great recipe,  but when I am short on time, I use 2 bags (2lbs.) of Trader Joe's Cocktail meatballs.  They taste great and it is easy... Then I serve in a Crockpot.

Someone in my family makes this for every event. We love it. If you don't have chili sauce use tomato sauce and a chili packet of mild or regular to your taste. I also skip the lemon.

Our family has been enjoying this recipe for years. Great flavor, SO easy! I use the frozen turkey meatballs. I like the review calling them "Grape Balls", I think I will adopt that name.

The sauce is amazing, so a 5 stars for that, but meatballs made without seasoning are disgusting. For 1 lb, add 1/2 minced onion, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 slice of bread or 1/4 cup oats soaked in milk, salt, pepper, 2 tbsp Worcestershire. Now you have a good meatball.

I've used a similar recipe for years. I use turkey meat, add an egg and some bread crumbs, roll into smaller meatballs (golf ball size are NOT cocktail size). The sauce is a jar of chili sauce (the whole jar) plus 10.5 oz grape jelly (the size that looks like a drinking glass). Then fill the chili sauce jar up halfway with water, cap and shake so all the leftover chili sauce that sticks to the bottle combines with the water...dump all that in the pot too. I don't use lemon at all. Best of all, you can make ahead and freeze...YUM!

I use this same recipe on party size smoked sausage and add a large tsp of Dijon mustard instead of the lemon juice. The grandchildren love eating them off frilly toothpicks.

another stand-by, classic recipe.  This recipe is very easy to tweak to your tastes as well.  I like to throw in some brown sugar, soy sauce and hoison sauce.  I like mine spicy, so red pepper flakes constistantly make an appearance as well!

Try this with cranberry sauce instead of grape jelly!  Delicious!! Also make meatballs with breadcrumbs and seasonings. More flavorful.

The repipe I've  used calls for 20oz Chile 10oz grape jelly. 
I've changed it by using Jam install of jelly also I had 10oz of sweet baby rays.
My meatballs are made pork beef and deer w/minced onions, pepper, egg, and Italian bread crumbs.  
Everyone loves them. I will make some w/out deer for those that don't like it.

I do a variation of this recipe that turns out fantastic. I get the bag of prepared frozen italian meatballs and put the in a crock pot with a bottle of heinz chili sauce and a can of cranberry sauce. The crock pot is handy because it keeps them hot for snacking at a party. I usually just put a small cup of toothpicks out for people to help themselves.

Do this too both homemade and store "premium" meatballs if time doesn't permit homemade. It a great dish to have on a buffet or take to a potluck in one of the smaller sized crock pots. Just add hot cook meatballs to stirred sauce ingredients and turn on low.

I've made these for years and everyone loves them.  I've used Mama Lucia frozen meatballs and made my own- good either way-certainly easier to go frozen.  I use the whole jar of chili sauce and whole jar of grape jelly.  I also dice onions and add a little crushed garlic (very little amount or it's over kill).  I've never tried the lemon juice but will!

What an easy and tasty dish!  I left out the lemon, only because I didn't have any.  Used a bag of frozen meatballs, jar of jelly, bottle of chili sauce.  Crockpot on low for about 3 hours and VOILA!  Delish!  Thank you for the recipe!

I've been making these meatballs since the '80s and they are always a favorite with everyone and there are never any leftovers.  I buy the frozen plain meatballs (don't get the Italian seasoned ones) and put them in the crockpot with a jar of grape jelly and a jar of chili sauce about 4 hours before needed.  You can also use ketchup instead of chili sauce if preferred.

Great recipe.  If you can find it, substitute grape jelly for currant jelly.  Really good. I also use a jar of each. Jelly and Chili Sauce.

I do not know what people see in these because I think they taste gross.  I could only taste the chili sauce.  I was thinking there would be a sweetness from the jelly, but there wasn't.

Changed a few things but this worked awesome. (3) 2# bags of frozen meatballs. 32 oz grape jelly. 24 oz chili sauce. 2oz lemon juice. 3 tbls chili powder. 2 tbls paprika. Slow cook on high for 2 hours. Then added 32oz can of chunk pineapple (including juices in can). Came out great and more than enough for 20 people

Had to chuckle when I saw this recipe.  My mom used to make this when I was a kid (I am 59) and I still use it today.  She also used currant jelly which I think is better if you can find it seedless.  Less sweet with a more interesting taste.
Great and super easy!

Before you buy those frozen bags of meatballs, read the ingredients. I suspected once when I tried to thaw them in the microwave and they shrank to 1/3 of the size and turned hard as a rock. Meat doesn't do that. It CONTAINS meat, but if you make your own, you'll be getting all meat and nothing else. No comparison.
