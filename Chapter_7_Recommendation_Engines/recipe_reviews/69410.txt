This simple-to-make recipe is guaranteed to bring you compliments- I would give it many more stars if I could.  This creamy sauce is worth every bit of exercise you might feel compelled to do-- count your calories elsewhere, and just enjoy this dish!  Your tastebuds will thank you!    My recommendations: 1) You must use a full-bodied, dry white wine, as the sauce's end result relies on that.  I recommend Mersault.   2) You should dedicate 20 minutes to making the sauce. The white wine, vinegar, shallot mixture should take at least that long to reduce, as it should gently boil over medium-high heat.  Don't let it boil rapidly, but don't let it just simmer either.  3) Use about half the butter called for, or use all of the butter and let the sauce reduce.  Experience has taught me that this sauce is always better when it is thicker and richer.  If the recommended amount of butter is used, the result is a thin, mild sauce.  By reducing the butter, you'll create a denser, creamier sauce that seems more appropriate for a thick tuna steak.  4)  If you take my recommendation for cutting back on the butter, realize that this will reduce the amount of sauce you make to about 3-4 adult portions.  5)  Lastly, I recommend serving this with orzo, freshly sliced tomatoes, and deep fried spinach (found on allrecipes.com).  The colors, textures, and flavors blend very well.

I liked this recipe so much that I created an account on the site just to write this :).

I cut an 8oz tuna steak lengthwise for a 4oz serving for my wife and I.  After coating each in olive oil and salt/pepper, I seared it on the stove, watching the middle of each half to where I had just the perfect sear:raw ratio.  For presentation, I cut each fillet into several thin (about 1/8 inch thick) medallions on the plate, and fanned them out.

For the sauce, I haven't been happy with the wine, so I substituted apple juice in for it instead.  I still put the white wine vinegar in it, however.  Apple juice instead of wine might not sound that great, but when you reduce it down far enough with the vinegar and onions, you get a delious, syrupy base.

I only used 1 stick of butter, and I think it was perfect that way.  I stuck with the recipe on the 1tbs of soy and wasabi, and was very happy with the result.  Even though the "heat" pretty much cooks out, the beauty in this recipe is the taste combination.

Be very careful while the butter emulsifies.  You want a good thick sauce, but it REALLY wants to boil on you.  Watch the heat.  This is where cooking with gas helps, because you have that instant temperature control.

Once the sauce was done, I drizzled it over the tuna medallions, and served it with rice.  Fantastic.

What you want here is the sauce, as it's more delectably remarkable and delicious beyond any I have EVER encountered!!  Use yellowfin or ahi/sushi grade tuna, thickly sliced.  If you don't marinate it, at least cover it with olive oil then coat generously with black/white sesame seeds which have been combined with chopped fresh herbs such as Italian parsley, cilantro, basil, etc., whatever you may have on hand.  Place the fish on wax paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet, and quickly sear the tuna on both sides (1.5 minutes), do not let the tuna cook or you destroy the true flavor (it's like eating the finest rare beef steak, you can't tell the difference).  Served with the butter and wild rice/lemon pilaf or greens, it's total heaven!  And all I do with the refrigerated leftover sauce and to cook another tuna meal is let the butter get to room temperature, scoop an amount on a plate, and set the hot fish upon it.  Unless you reheat the butter VERY carefully and slowly, it will separate such as in a clarification process, changing its flavor and quality.  This is absolutely my favorite meal!!!!  TEN stars on the sauce, and wasabi away to your tasting!

There is a restaurant near us that serves seared Ahi tuna with wasabi butter and a pineapple chutney that I absolutely love. This recipe means I can make it myself too! The sweetness of the pineapple chutney is a perfect addition to the tuna and wasabi flavors, give it a try! Serve with jasmine rice and steamed vegetables for a plate full of heaven. This is a recipe for a good fresh pineapple chutney that I found: 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 red bell pepper finely diced 
1/2 sweet onion finely diced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 
2 cups fresh pineapple medium diced
1/2 cup white vinegar 
1/3 cup brown sugar 
1 teaspoon salt 
In a 12" sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add red pepper and onion and sauté 5 to 7 minutes stirring constantly. Add ginger. Sauté one minute. Add pineapple, white vinegar, brown sugar and salt. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer 10-15 minutes (or until liquid is reduced by half)-remove and cool to room temperature.

We loved this!!!  The sauce is definitely the time-consuming part, it probably took me 45 minutes to make.  I read all the reviews and took the consistent suggestions of doubling the wasabi and cutting the butter in half.  So glad I did because the sauce had great flavor!  I could see how 1 cup of butter would be too much.  I also subbed a yellow onion in place of the shallot and used a Chardonnay for the wine.  I bought fresh, sushi grade tuna, wow, I will never buy the frozen yellowfin junk again.  This was so rich and meaty, and not fishy at all, its like you are eating a filet mignon steak.  Let the tuna steaks come to room temp. before searing, because if you do it straight out of the fridge you will end up with a cold center of the fish.  I seared mine for 90 seconds a side (as per some reviews), and we all felt (me, my husband, and my brother-in-law) uncomfortable because it was still very rare.  I know its sushi grade and can be eaten raw but we threw ours back on for probably an additional 90 seconds per side and that was much better.  More like a medium - medium rare steak.  Which this  recipe calls for searing a minimum of 3 min. per side anyway, will definitely do that next time.  I also coated the tuna with sesame oil instead of olive oil, felt that it would be more consistent with the other flavors.  Served with asparagus sauteed in garlic and olive oil and roasted fingerling potatoes to complete the gourmet meal.  We enjoyed very much a

This is one of the best recipes for seared ahi tuna.   If you're watching fat and calories you can reduce the amount of sauce you put on the tuna or reduce the amount of butter as I did  and it is still wonderful (I reduced  both the amt of butter in the recipe and the amt of sauce i put on each serving, so figure 1C = 16T. I used 3/4C (12T) or so and used about 1/8 of that sauce on each serving (equates to less than 2T butter per serving).  Recipe is also very simple and quick.  Why spend more time on a more complex recipe that doesn't taste as good?   Seared tuna can be somewhat sweet in flavor on its own and many recipes over enhance this.   If I could give this more stars I would.

Highly reccomended recipe.  I used low sodium soy sauce, margarine, 2 tablespoons of wasabi, and an extra dash of soy sauce, onion instead of shallot. Also I used plain white vinegar. It turned out sooooo delicous. I only needed to sear my tuna for about 1 minute each side. This dish is served best when the tuna is RARE on the inside and seared on the outside.

Served this as an appy for our Father's Day celebration. For our tastes, the sauce needed a bit more wasabi, but it was still very good. If you've never made tuna before, please don't go by the photo of this recipe. If you're tuna looks like that, it's way overcooked and will be extremely dry. It'll make good tuna salad, but cooked properly, it should be nice and pink in the center. We cooked these on the grill for about one minute on each side and even the peeps who had never experienced real tuna before became instant fans. Thanks so much Darla!

Wow!!! Use only 1/2 cup of butter & add another 1/2 tbsp of wasabi. Wow!! The yellowfin tuna I put the sauce on was delicious! The steamed broccoli that got the sauce on it was amazing! The garlic bread that I used to wipe every remaining drop of the sauce off my plate was scrumptious! This is the first time i've been compelled to write a review on any of the recipes i've used from allrecipes, and my wife and I were discussing what other dishes this sauce would be good on. A tablespoon in a Guacamole, Shrimp over Spaghetti, Scallops, Chicken, we came up with about a dozen before we finished the meal. I read all of the reviews, because the recipe was different enough to see how everyone customized it to their liking. Increasing the Wasabi  & reducing the butter was the common recommendation, and is also what I did. It took about 25 min to reduce the wine/vineger/shallot mixture, and I was concerned that the very small amount of remaining liquid wouldn't be enough. On top of that, it didn't smell very good while the shallots were simmering. But using only 1/2 cup of butter, it made enough sauce for 6 palm sized tuna steaks.  This one's a keeper, folks!

This sauce is absolutely amazing! My boyfriend said, and I quote, "I could drink this sauce". I did nothing to the tuna besides rubbing it with oil. This will be made over and over again in our house. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Best seared ahi recipe I've used to date!  I dipped the top and bottom of each medallion in sesame oil, then coated in white and black sesame seeds.  I seared each side about 1.5 - 2 min.  For the sauce, I used 1/2 cup butter and 2 TB of wasabi.  Absolutely perfect!  Plated it with wild rice so I had a good excuse to eat every last drop of the sauce!  Was able to reheat some leftover sauce the next day in the microwave by putting it on 30% power for 30 second increments and whisking gently in between until it was warm.

I reviewed this recipe some time ago, but I have tried a variation that is interesting and would like to share it.  Rather than use the white wine vinegar, I used a larger quantity of sake that was past its prime for drinking, then simmered it long enough to reduce it appropriately.  I had saved it for possible cooking, and gave it a try last night.  I recommend the change. As before, I strongly recommend using sashimi grade tuna and then searing it very briefly.  I use a cast iron skillet at high heat, first popping some whole black peppercorns in the oil and then adding the tuna just long enough to sear it.  It's sashimi-grade tuna that I normally use for sushi, so I want to make sure that the inside is still cold--certainly not "slightly pink" or grey.

Terrific recipe. Took other posters' advice, cut the butter and upped the wasabi. The end result was plate-lickingly good. Many thanks for the recipe - it's already been requested again!

I made this tonight and both my husband and I loved it.  I followed other posts and cut the butter in half (only used about 6 tbls.) and used 2 tbs. of soy sauce.  I also used a sweet white wine and the wine vinegar. I used dried cilantro, but only about 1 tsp. I served this over briefly stir fried bok choy and shitake mushrooms.  I seared the tuna over high heat to a slight light pink in the center as I did not have maguro tuna, only yellowfin, which tastes a little more fatty to me. The sauce is exactly the same as that which is served a a very popular local restaurant with salmon crusted with panko bread crumbs.  This is a keeper!

WOW!!My husband and I are truly fresh tuna lovers and this recipe was amazing. Definetly needed more wasabi in sauce. I did not have shallots so I used scallions. Pan searing the tuna for 90 seconds on each side was the key. You have to try this recipe.

It's a nice sauce for the tuna, but I found it  disproportionately high in fat/calories for the flavor.  Another general tip: let yellowfin warm up to room temperature before you sear. You want your tuna rare, not cold.

Based on the reviews I decided to try this but, in my opinion, a butter sauce does not go with seared tuna. The sauce was much too rich, and it was bland. I'm going to stick to my simple soy, ginger, wasabi, scallion dipping sauce.

This recipe is a WOW!  I agree with others that a thicker sauce is preferrable.  The tuna was enhanced by the amazing flavors of the sauce.  My wife said to only put it on the tuna, as I had added it to the green beans.  Wish I had rice pilaf to add to this mix.  Next time.  I followed a few of the reviewers suggestions religiously and it worked well.  We have friends from the UK staying with us next Sunday and they love this type of meal.  I cannot wait to make this again and again.  Darla, the chef presenter, we give you hugs for presenting this recipe.  We love you.

What can I say but WOW!!!  This was a HUGE hit, my family LOVED it.  I more than seared the tuna (we like it fully cooked) and placed it on top of a bed of brown rice.  I poured the sauce over top (made exactly as called for) and it was PERFECT.  Thanks so much for the fabulous recipe!

The sauce is unique and delicious... people rave when I make this. I didn't have shallots but used a mild onion instead and it tasted fine. I am allergic to cilantro so left it out but still thought the sauce had an amazing flavor. Don't be worried about the wasabi - I fed it to someone who despises spicy things and he loved it. I paired this with braised bok choy -- basically briefly sauteed in butter and garlic on a high temperature so it was more wilted than cooked -- and it was fabulous. I have sometimes sprinkled the tuna steaks with colorful wasabi chickpeas that I got at the food co-op - it's a very classy presentation.

I made this last nite for my boyfriend. OH.MY.GOSH.  It was amazing.  I did make a few changes, but nothing major.  I doubled the wasabi, as per other reviewers.  I used Chardonnay as my white wine for the sauce.  I also coated my tuna in black & white sesame seeds before I seared them.  Mine were pretty thick, and 90 seconds on each side was PERFECT.  I thought the sauce (while taste testing) was going to be way too strong, but it was perfect on the tuna.  I'm going to make that sauce again and try it with pasta.  I served this with pineapple fried rice (from allrecipes.com), stir-fried vegetables, and a green salad with sesame ginger dressing. I also made a dipping sauce for the tuna:  sesame oil, soy sauce, and honey.  Just stir- so good!!!!

**Simmer it with the Soy Sauce and Wasabi.. it makes a huge difference on the flavor scale.

This is absolutely heavenly. Beyond and above any world class Michelin reviews. The wasabi/ cilantro/ butter/soy sauce with reduced wine/vinegar/shallot essence is so very awesome! I sometimes replace wasabi with horse radish to give it a milder "kick". The secret truly is in the tuna itself: The more rare, the better. I encrusted the tuna with multi colored coarsely ground peppers. and put it on the hottest skillet to SEAR no more than one minute on each side. If you want the inside really really rare like sashimi, simply refrigerate the tuna steaks at around 35 degrees before transferring  them to the HOTTEST skillet. Um Um, Sinfully Scrumptious!

I love tuna, it is my favorite so I was very happy to find this recipe. I made this last night and was very impressed with the flavoring. It didn't look like the picture as I basically seared mine for about 40 secs per side, preferring it rare. I omitted the cilantro as I don't like cilantro and I added sesame seeds to the fillets before searing them. This was big hit in my house and I am so excited to make it again. Making the sauce was a little timely but well worth it! I think I will make double the sauce next time and save the leftovers for future use. Thank you Darla for the wonderful recipe!

This is really good! Make sure to add your butter slowly at the end, removing the pan from heat, for a silky sauce. I'd like to ty this again with rice vinegar and mirin or sake instead of the white wine for a more logical Asian combination, but it's also good as-is. Thanks for the recipe!

This was AWESOME!  Quick, easy, and my husband loved it.  I will make this over and over again.  I served it with asparagus (baked sprayed with olive oil and then sprinkled with pepper and sea salt) and a baked sweet potato.  It was fabulous!

The sauce is the winner here.  I make seared tuna frequently.  This recipe was the best.  I didn't have shallots, so I used garlic and scallions.  I also like seared tuna almost raw.  I could not get enough of the sauce, I also put it on the side of wild rice.  This sauce will go well with shrimp and other cooked fish.  A definite keeper.

I was a little concerned while making thsi since there was so much liquid in the pan that had to reduce to 2T.  The member that posted that it will take about 20 minutes was right.  It did take a while but sure enough, it eventually got there.  When all was said and done, it turned out very good.  I only gave it 4 stars because, believe it or not, it will need additional wasabi.  The spiciness must all cook out becauese although it was good, it didn't pop with flavor.  Definitely worth making again but next time I will use more wasabi and will get tuna steaks that are about 1 inch thick (mine were thicker).

I was scared to attempt a tuna recipe at home. Tuna is my favorite dish when out to dinner. This recipe was excellent. Tuna at home will become a norm.

All I can say is WOW!  This was awesome!  I have never had tuna that didn't come out of a can.  My hubby is not a fish person, but we decided to give it a try.  I love Wasabi so I figured it was worth at least trying.  This is now my all time favorite dish and my husband is not only eating fish, he is experimenting with different types of fish.  Something he would have never done before this recipe.  I followed the advice on the review board about cutting the butter in half.  I think this was a fantastic idea as I think it makes the sauce more intensely flavored.  We have had this a number of times already.  Also, as the review board stated, be very careful not to let the wasibi butter sauce boil as the butter is emulisifing.  I did this once, by accident, and it made a big difference in the quality of the sauce and not for the better.  I have also used this sauce on lobster and it was fantastic.  I just love this site.

One word: AMAZING!  The sauce is incredible!  We used chardonnay and it worked great.  The only change we made was to sear the tuna on high for 1 minute on each side because we like our tuna rare.  We paired the tuna with some asparagus sauteed in olive oil with chopped garlic and wasabi mashed potatoes. It was the best dinner we've had in a long time!  Perfect recipe for when you want to impress your guests.  Highly recommend!!

Excellent flavor that doesn't overwhelm the tuna. It's also easy and doesn't take very long to pull together. I had to substitute rice wine and red wine vinegar for the listed ingredients (that's what I had on hand) and did cut the butter in half - that was plenty, but otherwise followed the recipe and was very pleased with the results. Will definately make again. Thanks!

The sauce totally makes this dish. Like someone else said, the wasabi taste is definitely there, but it's not hot. I left out the cilantro because we don't like it.

I was very disappointed with this. The sauce was very sour and just plain weird; I even bought some decent wine for it. Husband scraped most of it off his piece of tuna.

I have made this twice... the first time I followed the recipe to a T and the sauce is absolutely delicious... but it IS very buttery....  The second time I used the same ingredients but added more wine and soy sauce and less butter and didnt waste much time whisking the butter in to make the reduction.  It also was delicious, but not the same as the buttery version.  I served with pea pods, these yummy little tempura veggie birds nests from trader joes, and a rice w/ veggies.  the family loved it.

I love this recipe.  Every time I serve it I get rave reviews.  The tuna is very moist, and the sauce is velvety smooth with a bit of a kick from the wasabi.  Absolutely delicious.  I did not alter this recipe.

Fantastic!  We will make this again and again.  Many of the previous reviews mentioned using only half the butter that the recipe calls for.  I decided I would make a judgement call once half of the butter was in the sauce (there is a limit to how much fat you can incorporate into an emulsion before it breaks).  I had a beautiful, smooth and silky sauce at that point so I decided to stick with half.  The flavor was amazing  so I don't think I would  want to make it any other way in the future.

Great way to make tuna. We seared it in a cast iron skillet. I would make sure it is dryer next time as it didn't really brown up as I expected, but did sear pretty nicely on the outside while pink on the inside. Sauce was great - it had a little kick to it and added flavor to the tuna.

I found the sauce bland. I Had made a Buerre blanc a couple of nights before and this sauce is similar. However, I couldn't taste the Wasabe in it at all overall it was just bland.

This is an excellent recipe for tuna steaks. I was making dinner for two so I halved then sauce. I would not recommend doing that. Make the recipe as it says... you'll be happy to have the extra sauce!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

new fave! easy and tasty!
I season my tuna with a dry rice seasoning first. The rice seasoning has sesame seeds, seawee, wasabi and some other stuff. Easily found at most asian markets. Comes out great!

This recipe was amazing! I bought my Ahi Tuna steaks at Costco. The only change I made to the recipe was to use less butter.

The sauce is amazing!  Definitely a labor of love since it's time consuming to reduce the wine mixture and then emulsify all the butter, but the end result is worth it served over a high-quality piece of medium-rare seared tuna.

This recipe was pretty bland.  Not much taste at all other than the butter in the sauce.  I will not be making this one again.

Amazing recipe!
Followed the directions!
Turned out amazing!
Served it with saute spinach on the side!
Tuna on a bed of sweet butter.
And as an extra, some pickled ginger!

PERFECT!

Please! DO not make it well done Tuna!
ewwww, well done tuna is going to taste like cardboard. Just seared, means your tuna steack as to be at room temp. and then 50 sec each side on a really warm skillet. And thats it.

This is probably the best recipe on the internet.  Beginners, don't be afraid to try this... just follow the sauce instructions to the letter.  Like the other reviewers, I cut the butter in half and doubled the wasabi.  Absolutely OMG delicious!

I have tried a LOT of tuna recipes on this site and this one is by far the best!!!  I LOVE it!  I couldn't bring myself to throw out the strained shallots so I threw them in with some fresh baby spinach and lightly sauteed them together which was also amazing, you wouldn't think that the wasabi-butter sauce would be good with spinach but it was.  Also I cooked my tuna on the grill which I feel was much better.  I have made this recipe many times now and every time it is wonderful.  Thank you!!

The sauce was delicious.  I followed it exactly.  I think maybe my tuna wasnt the best because it wasnt a dish that we went 'oh my goodness' about.  Having said that I would make it again, but next time will slice the tuna in several pieces and drizzle the sauce over it.

Better than expected--Followed other reviewers advice ie. half butter and double wasabi paste. I also used fresh Italian Parsley instead of Cilantro. While I do enjoy Cilantro, I didn't think it fit..It was better than anything I have ever had at a restaurant, my boyfriend agrees! Tuna is not too expensive which makes this recipe a staple in our house.

This is the first review I have ever left but this sauce was SOOO good I had to leave a comment. I followed the recipe exact (except I had less tuna which was fine because I like a lot of sauce). This is better than any restaurant tuna dish I have ever had! I served mine with jasmine rice....YUM!!!!! Thanks so much-

Wow! I was looking for something to put on fresh caught island tuna and this is it!  (this would be good on a rock, but...) :) I did exchange white vinegar and regular onions, can't imagine what it would taste like if I had all the right stuff. Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding recipe.  I took the suggestion of others and reduced the amount of butter used and paid careful attention to the sauce during and after emulsifying the butter.  I used a dry chardonay for the recipes because it's what I had on hand and it still worked beautifully.  I took another reviewers recommendation and sliced the cooked tuna into 1/2 slices with a sharp knife and fanned them out on the plate over a little basmati rice with a salad.  Very nice, very elegant, very tasty dinner.

I would give it a 1, but husband LOVED it, so I'll compromise with a 3. We halved the butter, but followed everything else exactly. Could have done with less cilantro. Be aware that this is VERY wasabi-y. It was a strange taste to me to have wasabi have the greasy texture of butter.

I just realized that I have never rated this recipe.  This is the best tuna steaks I have ever had.  My husband and I go to a very upscale restaurant for our anniversary every year just to get their tuna steaks but this recipe is so much better that now I have had to find other things to eat when we go.  Anyway, its very easy to make and always a hit with the family.

Wow! This sauce was great! We cooked the tuna for three minutes on each side, but it was still a bit more done than we would like. Next time, we will cook it for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. We added extra wasabi to the sauce, and next time will probably add more. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this about 6 times now and my husband and I love it.  We double the sauce though and put on top of steamed fingerling potatoes.  Delish.  I am not a seafood person but tuna steaks are great.  Not at all what I expected it to taste like.  This is a keeper and will make all the time.  Thanks.

Really good. I made some substitutions (as all cooks do, it seems) Didn't have shallots, minced onion was fine. Used a lesser amount of culantro instead of cilantro. If you are serving for two people, I recommend scaling the recipe down for three servings. The sauce is great, a little extra won't go to waste. 

I used an $8 Pinot Grigio and she checked out ok. Berringer, I think it was.

Served with "Garlic Parmesan Orzo" from allrecipes and some Trader Joe's Sugar Snap Peas that can be nuked quickly in the bag and only require a little bit of butter. Easy and well balanced.

Love it. Thanks!

The first time I had this recipe was when my brother made it.  Everyone in my family loves it.  We used much more wasabi though (think 4-5X), and it didnt make it too spicy - just yummy!

Loved the seared tuna, and the sauce was delicious, though I would have liked it with more wasabi.  Very rich sauce, lots of butter.  I used a Sauvignon Blanc that we had on hand, very dry and mild.  I will probably use less cilantro next time as well.

Very good recipe. I love seared tuna. I like mine rare and this works well for that. If I'm in a hurry, I just use a tube of Wasabi paste and not make the butter sauce.

I just have to say this sauce is absolutely amazing. I used a chardonnay and it turned out wonderful! I gotta tell you, also, I am not a huge tuna fan but was looking for a good wasabi sauce that seemed similar to one I found in a restaurant with scallops. So I made this and used lots of large sea scallops in place of the tuna and it worked so well with it! I will make this over and over again!

We LOVED your recipe! It was so good. The tuna was perfect and the sauce was to die for! I'll probably add a little more wasabi next time, as we like a lot of heat. It is a wonderful recipe.

I am a personal chef my trade and believe in the good advice from my teachers and employer: when you have the most fresh and top quality ingredients you don't need lots of marinades and sauces to cover. I used Ahi tuna steaks, lightly salted and peppered then rubbed with olive oil, before grilling a few couple of minutes each side for rare then served the wasabi butter on the side. It was fantasik. Even my employer's wife who does not care for fish or wasabi commented on the fresh, clean taste in combination with the succulent steaks. I served it with a peppery watercress salad and sliced tomatoes. Definitely added this to my list of favorites.

This was really yummy, and I am not a fish fan at all (except for sushi). The only reason I didn't give is 5 stars was I did halve the butter as suggested, add garlic to the sauce, and I only cooked the tuna about 2 minutes per side.

Just made this!!  we loved it!  I didn't have shallots, so I used a mixture of minced garlic and onion.  I also reduced the amount of butter from 1 cup to 3 Tbs. I made enough sauce for 6 servings but only had 2 pieces of fish- used rest of sauce to marinate fish for 3 hours.  Used the rest for dipping and also had some drizzled over some kale that I wilted in toasted sesame oil with pulverized toasted sesame seeds.  This was the best dinner we have had in ages!  My 2 yo even ate the fish. :o)  Thank you so much!

My husband recently went on a fishing trip and we have a freezer full of tuna to use up...Out of all the tuna recipes I've tried, he thought this one was the best.  I thought it was pretty good, but not quite 5 stars.  Surprisingly, the sauce isn't spicy at all.  You can definitely taste the wasabi, but it's not hot.

I used wasabi powder instead of prepared wasabi (about 2 tablespoons). Could have used more wasabi for more spice, but it was still delicious as is! This sauce tastes good over other firm-fleshed fish as well, such as mahi mahi and salmon.

OUTSTANDING!!! So easy and extremely good! As good as going out to eat and way more satisfiying. As suggested in the other reviews, I added more Wasabi which still didn't make it overly spicy, but gave it some zing.

This was absolutely incredible!!!!!  I will make a few minor changes next time - add a little more wasabi, use less butter and add some cream to the sauce.  Also, tuna should be seared on HIGH heat, not medium-high.  This was some of the best tuna I've ever had - thanks for the recipe, Darla!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and I read it wrong. I simmered 10oz of chicken stock with shallots and 1/4C of white white and the vinegar. Well I reduced it to only half, kept the shallots and added 2tbl of soy sauce,the wasabi and 1/2 stick of butter. It turned out delicious. My 14 yr old who doesn't like wasabi liked it very much. I think for our taste I would add more wasabi but over all it was delicious. I'll be using it often for other types of fish and for chicken.

Wonderful. Add a pinch of tarragon in the butter melting stage to gave it a Hollandaise tang.  Make wasabi paste with powder, then add extra in the last stages to heat it to taste. Great on smoked turkey, etc...

The sauce is great, but 3 to 5 minutes per side for tuna?  Good tuna is best enjoyed almost raw (like for Sushi) and should never be seared more than 90 seconds on each side!

Outstanding! I love seared tuna, but this sauce made it even better!! I used just a little over the tuna and then used the remainder to stir fry vegetables as an accompaniment. It was amazing and all my guests raved! All I had on hand was a sweeter white wine, and it really lent itself well with the heat of the wasabi. A wonderfully complex yet subtle sauce.

I had to add another comment, I made this sauce again only kept the scallions and added a red pepper to the saute mix. It made it a little chunky. At the end I added a splash of lemon juice and then spooned it over red snapper fillets and broiled them. Delicious and the family loved it. Thanks again.

This the second  time I made this recipe and both times my guests raved about how good it was.  One even stated that it was the best food she’s ever eaten.  It is very good.  Made even better by the fact that I catch my own yellowfin tuna.

The sauce is wonderful. I really thought there would be some heat but the butter takes it right out. Just left with the flavor of the wasabi.

We had a nice dinner for two with one, beautiful 12 ounce tuna steak. We modified the recipe by using garden basil in the reduction and a warm salad of fresh roasted corn, pear tomatoes and avocado in an apple cider vinaigrette.  Amazing.

I have made this several times, so yummy.  Like others I doubled the wasabi and cut butter in half.  It makes a great low carb meal by serving with cauliflower rice and Haricot Verts.

I have basically no cooking skills when it comes to seafood, and I was able to make this with success. I followed the recommendations of the reviewers and halved the butter...I also had to remove the pan from the burner a few times to keep the sauce from boiling, as it looked like it wanted to caramelize. I served it with Farmhouse long grain herb and butter rice. My husband added a bit more wasabi to the sauce, but otherwise, he loved it, which is saying a lot as he is a seafood snob!

I was having dinner guests so I decided to try the recipe as the reviews were so great.  I used 1/2 cup of the butter as advised by other readers.  I tried the recipe twice at one hour each time I tried.  Both times I could not get the sauce to finally emulsify. I consider myself a very experienced cook.  If I had served this recipe to my guests, I would have (as they say) 'been run out of town.'  What did I do so wrong.

This sauce is wonderful.  The combination of ingredients take on a sophisticated flavor of its own; I would be hard pressed to identify everything that goes into it.  My husband loved it, and he would have never tried anything with wasabi and cilantro!  Granted, the primary ingredient is butter, but it doesn't take much sauce to impart a very complimentary flavor to the tuna.  The only changes I made were to leave the shallots in (frankly, I let the wine reduce too far) and I used wasabi powder I had on hand (roughly 1/2 the amount of the paste called for in the recipe).  Still a winner!

This was amazing - my husband said "Definitely a Do Again!" I did modify a bit since I decided to make it when it was already too late to go get fresh cilantro or shallots... and I didn't use the salt in the tuna coating due to personal preference but still SO GOOD!!! Additionally, we only had 3 eating so I halved the recipe and couldn't justify a whole 1/2 cup of butter for the 3 of us so I only used a 1/4 cup. Still incredible - maybe more so. :^)

This is a favorite for my family when cooking fresh tuna. I do add more wasabi as we like it a little more hot - other than that, the recipe is great.

The sauce was heavenly. I left the schallots in it because my family likes them very much. I also added a couple of cloves of garlic. I made the tuna the way I usually make it. I rub it with wasabi and a very thin layer if Italian bread crumb and then seared it exactly the same way as it says here. I served it on a thin layer of rice and edamame. Delicious!

The sauce make this recipe. Everyone loved this and it's going in the normal rotation. Except I don't want it in too much of a rotation because it will make everything else seem not so good.

Excellent.  Tweaked it a bit after reading previous reviews to use 1/4 tsp of wasabi powder, 1/2 cup of butter and I didn't reduce the wine/vinegar/shallot quite as much.  Also added a bit of the reduction to the tuna for the last minute before serving.  YUM!

Wow!!!  I wish there was an option to give 10 stars -- this was AMAZING.  The flavors were perfect together and complex without being overpowering.  I served with steamed brown rice and sautéed spinach.  My husband didn't look up for the entire meal and just kept uttering sighs of delight.  I followed the recipe to a T and will do the same the next time.  This is perfect as written ... Make this -- make it SOON.  It will change your life.

This was really good.  The first time we made it as written.  There was of course way too much butter in it.  We threw out the old and made more the next day cutting the butter down to 6 tablespoons of butter (1/3 cup), instead if 16 tablespoons of butter (1 cup).  Not only did it taste better it was a lot healthier!  Why a cup of butter is needed in this recipe is beyond me. We also didn't remove the shallots; why remove them?  And we didn't add the cilantro to the sauce.  Instead we used it as a garnish, that way you didn't lose the cilantro taste so much.  I gave it a 4 star as written but with the the changes it's a 5 star.  We really like this sauce!  Will make again but next time will increase the wasabi because it kind of got lost.  UPDATE:  Added 1/2 tablespoon fresh minced ginger (can use fresh ginger paste found in the produce dept. near the fresh herbs - it's in a squeeze tube and honestly because it's fresh, it's the same as mincing fresh ginger, and it's convenient too!)  to the sauce and increased the wasabi and WOW this is an awesome sauce.  That makes it  a Wasabi Ginger Butter Sauce!  Delish!!  We will definitely be making this modified sauce on a regular basis.  Also save some of the cilantro as a garnish!  We LOVE THIS sauce!

Delicious, was cooking for two,so used half of what the recipe called for and then reduced the butter down another 50%, meaning I used a quarter cup of butter. This leaves you with plenty of sauce. I served with basmati rice and green beans.

Butter always works and in this case there's a LOT of butter... leading to a lot of love!

I half the butter and still make a fantastic sauce. I've also used 1/2 and 1/2 butter substitutes with almost (95%) equally good results.

Amazing recipe, this sauce is also great on veggies and steak! I  always cut the butter in half and add at least a full tube of prepared wasabi.  We use a sashimi grade tuna, allowed to come to room temp, then toss on the grill for about a minute or so per side and serve with couscous and lightly sautéed asparagus.

This sauce is dangerously delicious.  Now that I've made it, I want to put it on everything - scrambled eggs, french fries...come on, there have got to be more things I can put this on.  We used horseradish instead of wasabi, and it worked like a charm.  It's amazing how the flavor doesn't overpower everything.  I wasn't sold on the addition of the cilantro leaves, but it worked out ok.  I might even consider leaving the shallots in the reduction next time, as they could give an interesting texture complement to the cilantro...

I have been a sushi lover for a very long time and the flavor of this recipe subdues that pallet with a song of deliciousness.  This is a special occasion recipe (when you can get fresh Ahi that is) that everyone who enjoys sushi and fresh fish should master.

As others have mentioned, this took more than than given to prepare but it was so delicious, I've no complaints!  It was delicious! Next time I make it I will use a little less cilantro & reduce at a higher heat to minimize prep time. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

This wasabi-butter sauce is out of this world.  I serve over wild rice.  I find that the nutty flavor and texture is a wonderful complement to the tuna and sauce.

You must try this at home!

This recipe is amazing! Just like from a restaurant. We did a few minor changes...we used regular white vinegar (we didn't have white wine vinegar), we skipped the cilantro, and we added in about another tablespoon of wasabi (gave it a mild heat level with a nice strong flavor).  Definitely making again soon!

My tuna was fishy (yuck) but this sauce saved it with its richness and acid.  Might be a little much for a fresh rawer cut, but we had to cook ours pretty well through.

We found this recipe after we returned from the grocery store and as such, did not have cilantro.  We decided that wasabi & butter alone made this sauce worth trying.  We were not disappointed!  I can only image how great it will be next time w/the cilantro!

This recipe is AMAZING!!  And very easy to make (bonus!).  The sauce took longer than I anticipated, but was well worth the wait.  Like another reviewer said "I could drink this sauce"!  It was not very spicy/hot at all.  Next time I will use less butter and more wasabi.  Not a fan of cilantro, so I just didn't include it.  Can't wait to make this again!  YUM!!

this sauce is to die for!  so rich and flavorful!  However, just like everyone else has said 5 minutes is way too long on the tuna.  seared tuna should be warmed through but still very pink in the center.

Great recipe!!!  I didn't have exactly everything the recipe calls for, but it's good nonetheless!  I did cut down on the amount of butter and as another reviewer noted, the wasabi comes through without as much bite. Delicious!  Thank you so much.

Wonderful recipe for tuna; I expect that this will be requested regularly by my boyfriend.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using less butter (4 tablespoons for 2 servings) and searing the tuna for only 1 minute per side.  It was excellent as is, but in the future I plan to add a little more wasabi for a extra kick.

This was good.  It is hard to rate the actual recipe - we didn't have wasabi or cilantro so I excluded those ingredients.  Probably not as much "pop" of flavor as the original recipe, but it was a tasty mild sauce to serve over the seared tuna. UPDATE: made again as recipe states, and felt the butter was too heavy, can cut in half next time! Also, I should have cut the entire sauce recipe in half since we only had 3 tuna steaks, it was way too much sauce. Other than that, flavor is delicious.

FANTASTIC.  I substituted swordfish for the tuna and used rice wine vinegar (mirin) as I didn't have white wine vinegar.  I am a novice cook but with this recipe, managed to pull off something that was truly fine-dining restaurant quality!  The sauce is to die for.  I can imagine this would be wonderful atop garlic mashed potatoes as the sauce is so rich, savory and flavorful.

I am having a really hard time getting this sauce right (I'm new at this, and the butter keeps separating, I think), but even with being a little off, this recipe is very good!  I'm going to keep practicing.

This is sooooo good!  Lots of strong flavor, but it does mellow out as you cook the sauce.  I may end up using the sauce on other things, not just tuna.  Try this, you'll be satisfied!

Really great recipe. It's amazing how you capture the wasabi flavor without overpowering the recipe with heat. I used it with some tuna steaks that we had frozen and the flavor was incredible, even without using fresh fish!

This sauce is amazing!  I doubled the Wasabi, and cut the cook time on the tuna in half. The next night I put the sauce over steak and it was fantastic!  I placed the hot steak over the cold wasabi butter to heat it up and it worked great.

This was amazing!  I made it for my family with a few minor adjustments.  I substituted Light Smart Balance in place of the butter and used only 1/2 a cup instead of a full cup.  Also, I served it with the pineapple salsa that one of the other reviewers recommended...pair it with some jasmine rice and some wilted spinach and it was a meal made in heaven.  My family didn't even guess that it was healthy!

I tried making this today and it was absolutely divine! I had really chunky tuna steaks though so I cooked them for longer until the outside was crispy but there was still a thin pink line in the middle. The sauce was really, really good, but I added more wasabi to taste. I replaced cilantro with lemon thyme as well which worked out wonderfully and added a nice zing to it.

Wow. Really yummy sauce.  Things I did differently were... I used only 1 stick of butter and substituted onions for the shallots because I didn't have any shallots.  I also used white vinegar Instead of white wine vinegar.   Didn't have any wasabi powder/paste so I used the wasabi that we had last night with our sushi.  Not sure if that is the same thing but it all worked out in the end.  I didn't add the soy until the very end because I only had salted butter and I was afraid it was going to be too salty.  Turns out it wasn't so I added the soy at the very end.  Did Not use the fresh cilantro because almost everyone in my family hates cilantro except for ME.  I think the cilantro would add another wonderful dimension.  ALL in ALL this sauce is wonderful.  I literally could have drank it.  It did turn out a bit thin, not sure why but it didn't matter.  It was delicious.

I would absolutely make this sauce again.

Maybe it was the wasabi I used; it had no wasabi flavor. The other flavors were good but not what I expected. I will try again with a different wasabi.

This was a great recipe, especially the sauce!  Thanks to the reviewers about cutting back on the butter - totally right, and cooking for less time is a must also!  My tuna was served on top of a Greek salad and was great.

Excellent recipe.  As others suggested, I cut the butter in half, increased the wasabi, and crusted the fish with sesame seeds before cooking.  Be sure to use very high grade tuna.  Who needs to pay exorbitant restaurant prices when you now have this recipe?  Many thanks, Darla!

Awesome!! This is by far the best recipe I've made so far from this site. Sauce took quite a while, but definitely worth every minute - it makes the dish!

This is the best butter sauce in the world. If you don't have cilantro you can leave it out.

This wasabi-butter sauce is delicious! I have made this dish several times and it is equally as mouth watering with mahi mahi. I like to add a little extra wasabi for a nice kick.

Sorry, but this one didn't WOW me... I really wanted more wasabi flavor in the sauce... maybe I should have added some after the sauce was finished so the heat wouldn't cook off.  I used a high-quality Penzey's wasabi powder and mixed it up fresh.  It wasn't bad, I just was hoping for more flavor, since I love wasabi.

This was so wonderful.  I am not sure how long it should take to reduce the wine/shallot/vinegar mixture, but after 30 minutes it had reduced to less then half.  I used 2 Tbsp of the mixture and saved the rest (about 1/2 cup) to use for another time.  It still tasted wonderful and I also only used 1/2 cup of butter and it was plenty.  This will be a go to for special occasions. I served this with a white rice - scallion - shelled edamame mix and that went really well with the dish.

OMG!! This is SOOO good! The sauce makes the dish, that's for sure. Perfect amount of tang for us. Next time I will add a little more wasabi to the sauce. I could have used a little more kick. But we absolutely loved this dish!!

This receipe is amazing!  It seems complicated but it really isn't too bad.  The flavor is spectacular.  We made this for Valentine's Day and it was far better than anything we could have eaten at a restaurant.

This recipe was very good!  However, I like it a little spicy and would add more wasabi...2-4 TBS. depending on who I was serving.

I want more of a wasabi taste.  It seemed like I was eating tuna with butter.

I used salmon fillets (no skin) and the salmon was great, but no one really cared for the Wasabi-Butter Sauce. It was just too much butter and not enough real flavor. I won't be making again.

Excellent.  Tasted as good as I've had at restuarants. I used a little less butter and more wasabi.  Also I like it rare so seared each side for about 1 minute.

WOW!!!  I used alot more wasabi and some more soy sauce than asked.  About four times the wasabi.  I made garlic mash potatoes and spinach to go with it.  Nothing went wrong.  This was amazing.  I had to feed seven.  Thank you for this great recipe.

This dish had an excellent flavor, however the butter started to separate in the heating process and turned out to be extremely oily.  I actually was able to ignore the consistency because the flavor really was good.  I may try this with heavy cream instead of butter next time.  I will definately try it again.  Thanks.
