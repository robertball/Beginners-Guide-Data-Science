Hi, I'm the writer of this recipe.  I use 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of paprika, not the 1/2 teaspoon that was published here.  Try it with more paprika, trust me there's plenty of flavour in both the chicken and the veggies.

This is very similar to my grandmother's recipe. My mother made this and now I have for 30 years - this is one my husbands favorite meals. I most often use thighs (with or without bone) and I don't usually brown the meat, but if I do the chicken is seasoned first and browned in a bit of olive oil. I do use more seasoning on the meat, especially the paprika and I also add seasonings to potatoes. I often add onion and always put the potatoes (cut fairly small, so they cook faster) under the chicken (they cook better in some liquid and soak up the chicken flavor too) and add a bit of water 3 to 4 Tbsp. ( more if it dries out) Then cover and cook on low to med low. Can't be too high a heat, just a simmer.

Great recipe - took some advice from other posters and put the potatoes in the microwave for 4 minutes. Used boneless skin less chicken breast, a bit more butter (1 tbsp) and a small amount of olive oil. I cut a large onion and put that in the pan, the onion got very sweet and added a great flavor. I also doubled the paprika and garlic. Very easy and very tasty - nothing bland about it.

It was a really good recipe. The potatoes weren't cooked long enough though and cause of that the chick was cooked too long and was a bit dry. So i suggest that you start cooking the potatoes before the Chicken. I will definitely make this one again!

Very tasty!! I followed the recipe as directed as I believe in doing it the cooks way the first time and see if I need to tweak it after that. To my family and I this needed no tweaking at all! The potatoes were SO yummy as they were flavored by the chicken and the carrots were so sweet! The chicken of course was super tender. My kids were asking for more veggies. I did have to use thighs though as that was the only chicken I had and of course they worked perfect! Some are saying this didn't have enough flavor for them, I feel that it is a simple yet flavorful meal. I grew up in the country and I prefer a meal that is allowed to flavor itself with a "little" help from spices. Oh and a added bonus for this dish? 1 skillet cleanup! !:)

My whole family loved this. I did change it up a little, but it's a great base recipe. I sauteed onions and garlic along with the chicken that I couldn't help but sprinkle with a little bit of lemon pepper. I also took some of the other reviewers advice and cooked the potatoes in the microwave for 4 minutes before throwing them into the chicken pan. I them let all of them cook together with the rest if the ingredients for about 5-10 minutes, and noticed it was looking a little dry, so I added some chicken broth and white wine. I then let it simmer for about 20 more minutes, when it came out it was perfect, and very tasty!!

This dish has become one of our favorites. The important thing is to let the moisture cook off so the carrots and potatoes caramelize in the chicken drippings and butter. Yum!

On Oct 11th, the recipe's creator, Micke, corrects the published recipe to say she uses between 1 and 1 1/2 TABLESPOONS of paprika. I used 1 tablespoon. Love it! I did use red potatoes, skinless & boneless breasts, and olive oil, rather than butter. It's beautiful to look at and great to eat! I will surely make this again -- thanks!

This is QED: quick, easy, and delicious--just what I need on a busy (or lazy) day.  NOTE TO PANCAKE 1017:  Potatoes will cook in plenty of time if you start them in the microwave at full power for 3-5 minutes before adding to the pan.

I tried this yesterday, and it turned out very well.  I had to however add more salt than what was suggested, otherwise, the taters were going to be pretty bland.  It was tasty.  My husband had good comments.

This was OK, but very bland.  If I were to make it again, I'd double or triple the seasonings.

WOW!!! I made this dish in less than 30 minutes and my kids loved it!  I used more potatoes because my family loves them and microwaved them in a steamer for 5 minutes prior.  I used 3 boneless chicken breasts sliced in half; thus, pan frying 6!  In addition to the paprika, I used Black Pepper spice for more flavor and a little bit of Swanson 's Chicken Broth when it got a little dry.  This DISH is soo delicious!!!  AAAAA+++

Made this tonight for dinner, very quick and tasty. I seasoned the chicken before browning, as we like lots of flavor. This turned out excellent. Will make this a regular in our dinner menus. Thanks for such a simple recipe.

This is a comfort food recipe.  To me it was bland with the suggested seasonings.  I ended up adding chicken broth, a little white wine, and extra of the spices to give it more flavor.  Thank goodness I tasted it and tweaked it before serving!

I made this for my family and it was very good.  Quick and easy which is what I like.  I did add half an onion, sliced and sauteed before adding the potatoes and carrots.  I also added more of the seasonings for extra flavor.  I think I cut my potatoes to thin because they cooked to fast and were mushy however the carrots were just right. Some of the potatoes browned to much on the bottom so I added a few tablespoons of chicken broth to help the cooking. It wasn't a very pretty dish when I got done with it, but it sure tasted good. My husband had two large servings. I liked the flavor the paprika added to the veggies and chicken.  I never know what to do with paprika other than to decorate the top of potatoe salad like my Mom used to do.  I will definitely make this again but I will cut my potatoes bigger and cook at a lower temp.

This is really great! I tried it with chicken legs instead of the breasts and it turned out just fine. I also used olive oil instead of butter and it was still very tasty. The only problem I had was that my skillet was too small for the amount of chicken and veggies I had so I had to transfer it all into a pot, which didn't allow for much browning or crisping of the veggies-- I'll make sure that I am not so over zealous when chopping next time! p.s. The best part is the flavor of the paprika on the veggies-- make sure you get good quality, fresh paprika, it's worth it!

This was sooo good!!  I didn't use carrots and added sliced onions.  I seasoned the chicken before I browned them.  I precooked the potatos in the microwave for 4 mintues and they came out sooo good with the meal!  Will def make again.  Had all the ingrediants and sooo easy.

This is tasty and easy.  Suggested alterations:  I used fingerling potatoes.  these are the most delicious little potatoes.  They have the perfect skin to starch ratio and have a very nice flavor; buttery and earthy.  Also, I like to use the whole carrots instead of the baby ones.  They aren't that much more work, and they have a stronger flavor.  The choice of paprika can really make this dish from good to great!  I spnkled hungarian half-sharp and smoked spanish paprika. The half-sharp gave a fun  yet appropriate bit of spice  Yum!

This dish was wonderful. I found it slightly bland, so I added some ground red pepper to the chicken for some spice and followed previous advice to place on top of the vegetables which made them phenomenal. I also added some chicken broth, about 1/4 cup halfway through and it made it even yummier! I will cook this again, definitely!!

I make this even during the summer when I need a good old fashioned meal.  I use carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes...any root vegetable works great.  The flavor is mild, but great for those days when you just need some comfort food.  I do add a little more salt, but I tend to like things saltier than most people.  All in all a great recipe to use over and over!

it was ok. I increased the paprika since one of the posts said the amount in the recipe was wrong. We still didn't think it was all that.

I was looking for an all-in-one meal and this was great!  I used olive oil instead of butter and cut my veggies into smaller chunks to cook faster.  I also added some chunks of squash and parsnips.  It was very tasty and all 5 of us liked it, even my picky eater!  The only reason why it wasn't perfect was because it was a little oily.

I increased the seasonings only, after reading the submitters comments. I also added in some of my own sodium free garlic herb seasoning blend along with the paprika and garlic. Absolutely season this to your tastes. We found it very flavorful. Very easy and not a labor intensive meal to prepare, all of which means I'll be making this again sometime.

This was delish! I put the chicken in a salt brine for about 8 hours and added some onion and a lot more of the paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper then the recipe called for.  This will def be a family staple! Simple and tasty!

I made changes, so to be fair I gave 5 stars.  But the recipe gave me a fantastic base to create my own version of Chicken Paprika. DELICIOUS and will be making again and again!

Very good chicken--make sure you use more paprika! (like the recipe writer says in their review) I used 1 1/2 tsp paprika and a full tsp of garlic powder. I also cut the potatoes into smaller chunks and microwaved for just a minute and a half before adding them. The chicken was very juicy and tender, and I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious, comfort-food meal! Just tried this and it is wonderful.  As described, with a fresh, green salad, it's a complete meal.  Just like my mom used to make. I did add some small halved yellow onions, but that's the only change I made.  The author of the recipe wrote a correction on the amount of paprika...1 & 1/2 TB of paprika is perfect. Gotta love one-pot meals!

I loved this, hesitated in giving it 5 stars because I did alter slightly. Based on all the reviews I decided to spice up the chicken before browning, with salt/pepper and poultry spice. I did also addedk a few splashes of chicken broth and a splash of white wine towards the end. I did add 1 1/2 tbs of paprika as was mentioned and this was pan licken good if you ask me. Oh, I also microwaved potatoes which mine wound up overcooked, so next time Im not gonna do that, ill cut them small and then add them as the recipe suggests... Thanks, really did enjoy all the flavor this made

I made this for my son and his family while visiting them out of town. Even in  someone else's kitchen, away from my own equipment and spices, this was a breeze to make. Quick and easy and good! I added 1/2 yellow onion, a small amount of chicken stock and white wine and lots of paprika per the recipe submitter. The little kids loved it too. To make it even easier I used baby carrots.

Excellent and EASY meal.  I used 2 chicken breast and 3 medium potatoes cut in 1/4s.  I used hot smoked Spanish paprika and added some onion when I seared the chicken.  Also used fresh garlic chopped, and added some whole peppercorns.  Great flavor and I liked how the potatoes browned.  I didn't add any extra liquid because I wanted them to brown, but did use more low-medium heat for 30 minutes instead of mediu.  Fantastic and great flavor.  I highly recommend using hot smoked paprika.

Good recipe to be a staple - very easy to make and easy to adapt to vegetables that are on hand. I only cooked my boneless chicken for 35 minutes and it got dry...I even added water...just be careful.

This was good, so easy, everything in one skillet.  Only thing I would change is add a little garlic, and this will be 5 stars.

Based on other reviews; I cooked up a few slices of bacon with the butter before searing the chicken. I increased the paprika to 3 tablespoons and added fresh chopped garlic with the veggies. I also started the potatoes in the microwave for 4-5 minutes prior to adding them to the pan.  The smell in my kitchen had my mouth watering... my husband said it was good (but missing something), my kids loved it, I loved it!  I may try decreasing the paprika to 2 tablespoons and season the chicken with 1 tablespoon of Emeril's Essence. Either way, I loved it and will make it over and over again!

Easy, tasty, healthy.  To speed up the cooking a bit, I did pre-cook the potatoes and carrots (medium sized chunks) in water about 10 minutes and then saved the cooking water to add to the skillet as needed.  Also pre-seasoned the chicken before browning, then added more seasoning to the skillet after adding the veggies. A definite keeper recipe!

Even though I gave this only 4 I really liked it.  Some of the chicken was a little dry.  I will definitely make again because it is so simple and different from other chicken recipes.  I will probably stir it more and add a little chicken broth.  Picky kids liked it too!

This is a definite keeper! First, it wasn't clear whether or not to use bone-in chicken with skin, which is what I used. So, I may use bone-in / skinless next time, only because we don't eat chicken skin so I felt we missed a lot of flavor, although it was still very delicious!  Anyway, I didn't have a skillet large enough for all of the ingredients so even though I didn't change the recipe I did have to change the way I prepared it.  I used a large oven-proof dutch oven instead of the skillet.  On the stovetop, I browned the chicken in butter then seasoned per the instructions (with the updated 1 Tablespoon of Paprika).  I then removed the chicken briefly so I could add the potatoes (quartered lengthwise to be sure they cooked through) and then carrots. I then added about 1/4 cup of water, seasoned the veggies with salt & pepper then placed the browned paprika chicken on top.  I then covered and placed the pot in the oven and roasted it for 45 minutes at 350°.  I uncovered and roasted another 15 minutes so the juices would cook down and become caramelized.  And wow, what a beautiful and delicious feast!  And just one pot for easy clean up!!! Thanks soooo much for a fantastic recipe!  I'm already looking forward to making it again soon! :)

Delicious!  The only changes we made were to season the chicken with a "grilling" herb mix before browning, add a small, sliced onion to the vegetables, use two crushed cloves of garlic instead of powder, and add a little apple juice and water (and a little goes a long way!) to the pan (or dutch oven, in our case).  We did put the veggies in the bottom and laid the browned chicken breasts on top to finish cooking. Warm, comforting, FLAVORFUL, and sticks to your ribs. What more could you want for dinner in January?

This is good and versatile. I used boneless skinless thighs. I added sliced onion and fresh garlic with the butter. I too microwaved the potatoes for 4 minutes and I don't think I really needed to. I used baby carrots and I placed the potatoes and carrots under the chicken. Used 1 tablespoon paprika and I might use 1 1/2 next time. Definitely need to add broth and or white wine. I added about a 1/2 cup broth. Would probably be good with some crushed red pepper if you like spice. My boyfriend added hot sauce to his.

This is a great recipe.  My kids loved it!  I used the boneless chicken breasts I had on hand and it was very moist and tender.  I also varied the recipe and put the potatoes and carrots in the microwave.

Add extra paprika & pre cook potatoes as reviews suggest. My second time, I served home baked fries (skin on), on side, instead of potatoes in dish. I added a little red wine and honey to dish to sweeten for a change. I also added broccoli, near the end so not overcooked? This is an easy  main dish to serve guests!

We loved this recipe tonight b/c it's soo easy, quick, and easy clean up!  The chicken was so tender and the veggies were great.  There was a perfect glaze over the chicken.  I used 1 Tbsp. of paprika and was just right.  This will go in my recipe book for sure!

We had this tonight for supper and my family gobbled it up. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and red potatoes. The potatoes were small and cooked fairly quickly. I followed the suggestion of some previous reviewers and put the chicken breasts on top of the potatoes/carrots after searing them. I also used a little less butter and added some olive oil and seasoned the chicken before searing it. We thought it was good and very simple to prepare!

Flavor was quite bland but will probably try again. Next time I'll add onion and maybe seasoning salt or garlic salt instead of garlic powder.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and that worked fine.

Quick...easy...simple...great meal solution on a busy week night.  I made it strictly according to the recipe but will probably add some herbs or perhaps additional root vegetables next time----or not!  Because the beauty of this one is the simplicity of it!

I used the correct amount of paprika (according to the recipe author's notes in the review section) and this was delicious!  I usually bake my paprika chicken but I think this will be the way to go from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh, so good.  I certainly will make this again.  I used red potatoes, cut into large chunks, and they were not underdone at all.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (what was in the freezer) and cut them into larger-than-bite-sized chunks.  Browned the chicken first, removed from pan to add potatoes and carrots.  The veggies made a nice browned crust on the bottom and the chicken was very flavorful.  Everybody went back for seconds. Served with buttered macaroni and steamed cauliflower.

This had a fairly short prep time, I gave it a try. I had no whole carrots, so I just used the julienne carrots I had in the crisper. Also, I really like spicy foods, so I added some extra spices, and red pepper flakes.

Great recipe! I used approx. another 1/8 cup of butter, more paprika and a mixture of garlic powder, pepper, and salt. I also added some onion. I only had boneless chicken, so I used that and cooked the chicken for less time (probably closer to 20 minutes--wasn't counting!) and left the carrots and potatoes in longer to finish cooking.  Hubby still added bbq sauce, so will probably add more spices next time. But, overall, easy to make and delicious!

Flavor was awesome.  Wish I had read the reviews first though as mine really really really had too much juice.  Took too long to cook it off to get the carmelization.  I think I should have uncovered it or started or maybe never even covered it at all.  I think it would be better baked.  Will try again either baked or not covering it.  I was looking forward to the crispness but wanted to follow the directions exactly.

Warm and Comforting meal, that was simple too!  We loved this meal.  I only made 2 small additions:
1.  I crumbled a chicken boullion cube over everything for a little boost of flavor
2.  I also added a small amount of water to the pan, to create a sauce that I could spoon on top after plated.
Delish!

Just noticed the editors note to add more paprika, so I will try that next time. Maybe I will use a little more garlic powder next time also. My dish came out more soupy. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, and added minced garlic and onions. I have no complaints though, because I scooped it on top of some rice and a side of cornbread. Holy freaking yum! I don't like potatoes (they literally make me barf) and I ate this right up! I will try it with the 1-1.5 TBLS of Paprika next time and see if there is a difference! Can't wait to try it again :-)

It was good but I agree with those who said it was bland. I ended up adding more paprika and onions and also some lemon juice and lemon pepper seasonings.

so simple and EASY.  I didn't think there would be enough water to cook everything completely but the veggies really give off just enough!  I did pre-cook the potatoes when i made it with small 1" chicken breast pcs.  My very picky husband even liked it!

This was very good. I did have to add some more spices, like sage, cumin and a little garlic powder, but the idea of it was very good. It turned out very tasty. I also let it simmer in some chicken broth to keep it from sticking to much to the pan.

This was very good on a cold snowy night.  With very little effort I had a meal on the table.  I did precook the potatoes a bit in the microwave and used chicken thighs.  I seared the chicken in half butter and olive oil and added an onion chopped.  I doubled the garlic powder and used a TBSP of paprika as the author suggested. I also added a good splash of white wine to scrape up the bits before I covered it.  It was very yummy!!  I would salt and pepper the chicken next time before searing but, otherwise it was great.  Thank you for sharing this family recipe!!

Excellent. I did use at least a tablespoon of paprika and 1 teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder and salt and pepper.
I quartered the potatoes length wise and sprinkled the spices on the potatoes an carrots.

This chicken recipe is good, & I will be making it again. Cooking the chicken & the vegetables in the same pan is so convenient. The vegetables were awesome. 

My only complaint is that the chicken itself had little flavor apart from the sauce. Perhaps that is not the fault of the recipe but the way chickens now are raised, more for their flesh, sacrificing flavor.

In any event, I made just two changes to the recipe. I added a thinly sliced onion to the vegetable mix because my family really likes them. I also added a little chicken broth, about 1/2 cup, to the pan after I added the vegetables because it looked too dry. I did add the updated amount of paprika to 1 1/2 tablespoons, & it tasted just fine.

I need to investigate methods to infuse more flavor into the meat.

As others suggested, nuked the potatoes and added olive oil.    Also added an onion and a turnip and cut up the chicken.   My husband and I both loved it.   I  will definitely add this to the rotation.

Just the two of us, so I used two boneless breasts and two baking potatoes each cut into quarters.  I cut back on the butter just a little since less ingredients were used. 30" was perfect. I saw the writer's note to increase the paprika so I did.  This was tasty and very easy.  I will definitely make it again!

Not that flavorful for my liking. Flavor didn't penetrate the chicken skin, so the meat was pretty bland. Veggies were ok, and I cut the potatoes small to avoid undercooking as other reviewers noted. That seemed to work well.

This is a great weekday meal, and I agree that there is plenty of flavor. I don't always peel my potatoes, and I do cook them longer than the chicken. One pan clean up is a great plus! I use breasts or thighs and both are great. Not hard to fix on a busy day when you are too tired to cook.

Very easy and delicious dinner option.  My husband rarely gives anything a higher rating than a 3, but this he rated a 4. Cooked as written with the exception of adding onion powder and a lot more seasoning.

This came out so good after I read some of the comments and adjusted the seasonings. I added 1 Tbs paprika and 1 Tbs garlic salt since I couldn't find the powder. Plus I already had baby carrots so used them and saved the time of peeling and chopping those. It was super simple to prepare for anyone with busy lifestyle. Will make this many more times. Maybe even double the recipe for Sunday luncheon.

I wasn't expecting much as making this was a last minute decision. I used boneless skinless chicken breast and a full tbs of paprika. Wow, what a surprise my family loved it. Super easy and the left overs were even better.

We love this as written. This time I tried dredging the chicken in flour before browning, and I didn't like it as well.

It was absolutely delicious! I did microwave the potatoes, but there was no need for that.

Excellent! I put a little chicken stock with the potatoes in the microwave for about three minutes then added it to the pan with the chicken, carrots and some onion. I used baby new reds so they were tender and very flavorful.

This recipe is good in concept but I had too much broth to get any browning or crispy spots on the chicken or potato. I poured off the liquid and made a delicious gravy. I used a spicy seasoning mix instead of the paprika, salt, pepper and garlic and the dish had lots of flavor.

Excellent dish!  Very easy to make.  Next time I'm going to add celery and onions and maybe a little bacon for extra flavor.

Great recipe that my entire family loves. I often use extra veggies like celery, onions, fresh garlic, parsnips and potatoes that make it heartier and larger to feed my family of 6. (I precook those in the microwave for a few mintues) This is even better left over. I have prepared it on the stove but really prefer to take my large iron skillet after the chicken is cooked and put it under the broiler for an even better roasted flavor.

This was delicious!  I used bone in chicken breasts, red potatoes and carrots.  I seasoned everything with McCormick's salt free garlic and herb seasoning, minced dried onion, pepper  and paprika and it only took 35 mins to cook.  The chicken was super moist and the potatoes and carotts were perfect!

Very easy and very yummy.  I took another reviewer's advice and put the potatoes and carrots under the chicken.  They were nice and soft and they were very nicely carmelized, which my family loved!

This was a great weeknight dinner.  Both my 3 year old and 16 month old loved it and cleaned their plates!  My husband said the carrots were "glorious" and wished there were more!
