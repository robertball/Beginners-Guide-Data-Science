Excellent taste. Extremely simple to make.  It is quite tasty with nuts.  Although I wouldn't mind trying it with cashews next time to see how it goes.  Tops.

I made this for Thanksgiving- I had to make an secound batch because the first batch did not make to Thanksgiving day!!  Totally awesome! My family went crazy for it! I used salted dry roasted peanuts- It gave it that salty sweet taste- It made the fudge very memorable- I have been requested to bring it for Christmas!- Very easy and fast even for a kid or beginning cook!

Very good, but I made extra chocolate sauce to pour over the top.  The amount in the recipe is just enough to coat the peanuts and marshmallows, and i wanted more chocolate.

This was so easy and absolutely deliscious.  I made two batches, one for me and one to give away.  It was a huge hit and so easy to make.  I didn't change a thing.  I noticed that I liked it better when it's been refrigerated, but not necessary.

So, easy you'll wonder why you hadn't tried it before.  I made this to give away to neighbors for the holidays and I couldn't keep my family out of it!  A must try, but make sure you make a double batch so you have enough for your family and friends.

I make this at Christmas each year to give to coworkers - it's a favorite, and people start asking about it just around Thanksgiving.  The only thing different I do is using toasted pecans in place of peanuts.  Super easy and yummy!

I followed this to the letter however, it did not come out as well as other recipes I have tried. Usually I am not able to keep in the house and this ended up not being eaten...

I have been making this for special occasions for years now.  Easy to make and everyone loves it.  I find it better with the milk chocolate chips.  You can use any nut -- I've used pecans before and also used walnuts before.  All delicious!

Definately make this recipe, everyone loves it.  I would suggest only using 1.5 cups peanuts and no more than 3/4 a bag of marshmellows.  I though the chocolate/peanut/marshmellow ratio was incorrect in the origianl recipe.  Very easy to make, which was great!

Not a favorite. I think the reason for this was the amount of nuts. Too many!!! If ever I make rocky road fudge again, I'll use this one and cut down on the nuts by at least half a cup. Thanks!!

My mom has made this recipe every year during the Holidays for years.  It is one of my favorite desserts.  The salty and sweet combination along with the soft marshmallows is delicious!
