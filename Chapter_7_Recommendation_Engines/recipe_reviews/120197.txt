Had hubby not oversalted this, and had I not overcooked it, I know this would have been a five-star vegetable side dish. The roasted red pepper adds a nice flavor contrast to the broccoli and the presentation is beautiful. Can't wait to make this again--properly.

I love broccoli and this is a real winner! Using ROASTED red peppers is key (I was lazy the first time and just chopped my fresh pepper without roasting - good, but not special). Using two plump garlic cloves worked best for me, but to each his own.

Another great way to cook broccoli.  After I steamed the broccoli I just added it to the skillet and tossed it right in the pan to coat with the garlic/roasted red pepper mixture. We liked this a lot.

I have to say I'm not a broccoli lover but I am learning to like it.  I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe and thought it had really good flavor.  I chose to use frozen broccoli but nuked in the microwave for a couple minutes.  I scaled the recipe way down since it was just me eating it but added everything right down to the fresh parsley.

Good!  Nice color and flavor contrast to the broccoli.  I actually just used a regular chopped red bell pepper, and it was still very tasty.

Yum yum! This is a grown-up recipe. I've been searching for a broccoli recipe that didn't need a ton of butter or cheese sauce, and TA-DA! I substituted olive oil for the butter, and added the salt in to the broccoli water rather than with the garlic and peppers. My daughter wouldn't touch the peppers, but loved the broccoli itself. Thanks!

Nice way to serve broccoli.  I did not use a roasted red pepper but used a raw red pepper that I steamed with the broccoli.

Excellent!  I probably put just a little bit too much salt in.  I will probably cut it back to about half that amount next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was good, but nothing spectacular.  It basically tasted like red peppers and broccoli--I couldn't really tell that there was garlic or parsley.  I'd probably add more garlic next time.

Simple, tasty and looked pretty on the plate.  We added more garlic and pepper but no other changes. Kids ate it all but still prefer the roasted broccoli from this site better.

I thought this recipe was good.  I am a fan of red peppers but my husband is not, so he avoided them.  I thought it really made the broccoli easier to eat (not a huge fan of broccoli either).  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks.

Rather than bothering with the steam basket (already had two burners going), I used the microwave to steam the broccoli in about 2.5 min. Once the red pepper mixture was ready, I added the broccoli and let it cook a little longer (I liked the charred parts). It seemed a tad boring, so I put some shredded cheese on top...which melted nicely and added more flavor. I will say it was a beautiful dish!

I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED the results!  The vinegar infusion of the peppers complimented the broccoli perfectly without making the whole dish overpowering.  A delicious change from the usual broccoli side dish and good enough to serve for special occasions.  Next time, I may try Balsamic vinegar because I love it.

This was so simple yet so delicious!  Of course you have to like the taste of roasted red peppers.  Even my husband liked it.  Next time I will add extra roasted red pepper because it gave the broccoli great flavor.

A winner! I used olive oil instead of butter. So fast and easy. I liked steamed flavor of the broccoli. Normally I would saute them all together.

I only had dried parsley and I added more garlic (we love garlic) and peppers. It was nice to try broccoli with something other than butter or cheese- very yummy!

We usually steam our broccoli. This is a flavorful and healthy new way to serve it. I first served this when we had company for dinner and everyone enjoyed it.
