My mother and I wanted to add a unique dish to the usual Thanksgiving Day fare.  This dish was a huge hit and put a little kick into the T-Day.  We served it in a small hollowed out pumpkin which and offered water crackers with it. It was equally popular as an appetizer or as a side.  Use a yellow bell pepper so that you have an explosion of colors in your dish.

Good mix of couscous, veggies and beans - no one thing overpowering.  Loved the red pepper that gives the kick and we are fans of the curry flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  Made it as is, with the excepetion of not using a measuring cup...just eyed everything up.  It's pretty zesty, but I think that mainly comes from the crushed red pepper so you could leave that out.  I love curry though and the fresh veggies and beans is a great mix.
