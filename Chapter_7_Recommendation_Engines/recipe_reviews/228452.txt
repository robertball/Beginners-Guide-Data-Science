I think the instructions about what to do with the bulgur perhaps were unclear. I don't think this came out like it was supposed to. The tomatoes' juice was not soaking into the bulgur and the bulgur was not fluffy. Upon adding the dressing, the entire dish turned somewhat into a cold soup. I really wanted this dish to work, and we ate parts of it, but the rest was tossed. At least the lamb meatballs I made for the same meal were all eaten up :)

This was amazing. I substituted tahini for the oil and used extra lemon juice.

This recipe is so good! One thing...the tomato paste is a must. It adds an extra richness that makes all the difference.

I used half a red onion as I didn't have yellow or green, and I forgot to get mint! Doh. Anyway, it was AMAZING nonetheless and yes, Sharita is right, the tomato paste really makes the dressing. Even my non-parsley-loving friends liked it. Had it with Mediterranean Beef Meatball Kabob and Greek Tzatziki wrapped in lavash and pita breads. A big hit!

Love this recipe!  I couldnâ€™t find the bulgar, so I used whole wheat couscous and it was wonderful!

This was my first time making tabbouleh, it was beautiful, I was very impressed. I don't understand the confusion over letting the bulgur and tomatoes sit together that one reviewer had. For me it worked perfectly and the bulgur tasted amazing, it just soaked up all of the flavour from the tomatoes and really blew my mind.  I will add tabbouleh to my rotation now and will always prepare bulgur this way,  think it was very valuable to learn, though I do think the quality of the tomatoes is important. However one problem with the recipe is that it doesn't state how large the tomatoes should be ! I ended up using 9 small very ripe tomatoes, which I estimated to be about the same as 6 medium to large tomatoes, having never made bulgur before I wasn't sure how large it would puff up, but by a stroke of luck the ratio was perfect. My second problem was the sieve I used, the fine bulgur actually passed straight through it, I ended up lining it with cheesecloth, in order to give the grain a good wash. The final result of the dressing I found to be extraordinary tart.  Lemon juice AND tomato paste, seemed a bit overkill, maybe because the tomatoes I used were so beautiful the bulgur actually already had a beautiful flavour from them and probably didn't need such an intense dressing, but I wanted to try the original recipe to know exactly what it was like. After trying the finished dish I ended up adding, garlic, 1 tsp of honey and finally half a finely chopped cucumber to try and dist

I made this tabbouleh for my family. Something was missing, and I can't put my finger on it.

Prepared as indicated in the recipe with the exception of adding a bit of water to the tomato and bulgar mixture.... I used Roma tomatoes that I seeded so they didn't have much juice for the bulgar to absorb.  Very good and definitely most authentic recipe I've found. I took it to a gathering of friends and received lots of compliments!
