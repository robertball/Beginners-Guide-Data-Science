Delicious! This is an oldie, but a goodie and it was a great way to use up some homemade waffles I made for breakfast.  Instead of maple syrup I opted for hot fudge.  Whatever combination of ice cream flavors or toppings this is sure to please!

Growing up these were a very special treat at my dad's house - only we used 2 frozen waffles with ice cream sandwiched in between.  Dad would buy the half gallon of ice cream in a rectangular cardboard box, let it sit on the counter to soften for a few moments and cut off ~1" thick slices and place them in between 2 waffles.  Great memories - thanks for posting this :)

This was one of those dessert recipes where you KNOW you're eating something that is going to completely ruin your diet!  It was yummy, we had everything in the house already, and my daughter thinks I'm a super Mom for letting her eat it ; ).  I can foresee many combinations in our waffle-sandwich future.  Thanks for sharing!

Try 2 waffles, spread peanut butter and sprinkle on one of each sides on both waffles with the ice cream, and REALLY make it a sandwich, YUM! (:

I tried this with strawberry ice cream and some strawberry syrup instead of butter and maple syrup. The result is something like a waffle cone, delicious! It's a once in a while treat, but it's the perfect indulgence!
