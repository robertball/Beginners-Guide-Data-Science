I have made this three times in the past week for different holiday gatherings and the result was the same every time- it was the first dessert to go amidst six or seven others. After hearing the comments from people eating it, those who didn't get a slice were begging for a taste! I did make a few changes. First, I added a quarter cup of white sugar to the crust. Next I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. Then I also used 1 1/3 cups of milk as others suggested. Finally, I topped the whipped cream with mini chocolate morsels. Super easy and scrumptious.

Must have been a typo, do you know what you get when you add 2/3 cup milk to 5.9 oz of chocolate pudding? a whisk full of !! it should read 2 2/3 cup milk. dont you test theese before you let them be posted?

Definately a tasty and EASY recipe! I made this for New Year's eve and there were lots of desserts there, this one got the most raves! My sister really wants the recipe!
Changes I made:
I put toffee chips in between the cream cheese and pudding layers and on top.
I also used 1 1/3 milk for the pudding, 1/4 cup sugar in he crust and 1 tsp of vanilla in the cream cheese.

Simple, yet elegant with a great presentation, this dessert was a hit!  I used a combo of pecans and cashews in my crust (didn't have enough pecans) and added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar.  Baked my crust for about 20 mins, perfect!  I used light cream cheese, fat free Cool Whip and fat free pudding mix (like any of it matters!!).  I do believe that 2/3 cup of milk is a typo in this recipe...the box directions are 2 cups, but I think it depends how thick you want your pudding layer to be within this pie.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of milk and found it perfect!  Decorated the top with semi-sweet chocolate shavings, just beautiful!  Five stars plus and a repeat for sure!

Definite typo-on the milk- I use 2 small packages of instant pudding and 3 cups milk. I've been making this recipe for years and everyone raves about it. I toast 1/2 cup pecans, 1/2 cup coconut flakes and a little butter, cool and sprinkle on top. For potlucks I bake in 9 X 13 pan- it's easier to serve and goes further.

My mother has been making this recipe since I was born I think. We always double the recipe and put it in a 9x13 to take to parties and get-togethers. I've made it so many times that I rarely can stand to eat it, but everyone always BEGS me or my mom to make it again and again.

This was an excellant recipe. I did add the teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese and I made the pudding at directed on the package. I also used a graham cracker crust instead of making my own. And put chopped pecans on top. It was very easy and very delicious!! I also added another box of pudding for an even fuller pie

This pie was awesome!  I added 1/4 cup sugar to the crust and used 1 1/3 cups of milk in the pudding layer.  The crust was so good.  Next time I might try brown sugar in the crust.  This is a definite keeper!

I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 dish.  It came out great.  This was the kids favorite on Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the recipe.

It's a lot like other pies of this type, but the wonderful part is the butter-pecan crust.

YUM! 4.5 stars. I made this as one of my desserts for Christmas dinner...all other desserts were virtually ignored! My mom couldn't believe I made it. Followed the recipe to the tee, very easy, it was a plus that I could fix this ahead of time and not tie up my oven waiting for it to bake. The only thing I'd change is to maybe add another small box of chocolate pudding- I used the large box but the chocolate layer was still much thinner than the cream cheese layer, which made it very rich. Still fabulous, its a keeper!

The amount of milk in this recipe is way off... had to add tons more.  It stuck to my wisk it was so thick! I thought the cream cheese layer was too much compared to the amount of chocolate.  Overall, not bad, but have had much better.

I found this dessert at a covered dish dinner, and have loved it ever since! Two different suggestions for variations: 1) Mix about 5 oreo cookies into flour mixture. Mix about 7-10 cookies into cream cheese mixture. Garnish with Oreo crumbs. 2) Make a cherry glaze and drizzle over top, and garnish with maraschino cherries.

Yummy - This was very tasty... I did make one shortcut ... used a store bought  graham cracker crust.  Also increased the milk in the pudding to 1 1/2 cups (used 2%). Will definitely make this again.

Packaged whipped topping + packaged puddin = packaged flavor & texture.  We picked at it to be polite.  The concept is good though;  I made it with a scratch pudding & real cream that I whipped & it's yummy.  The "out of a box" flavor is what kills this recipe. Sorry!

Always have my family rate recipes and this one was a 9.5! Can't go wrong with the recipe. The only thing i did differently was use some graham cracker crumbs in the crust mixture and made my own whipped cream (always better than store bought). Yummy!

This pie is super easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I used pecan halves smashed into tiny pieces (almost dust) by a mallet for the crust.  I had problems spreading the thick chocolate layer over the soft cream cheese layer, so I ended up running to the store to buy more pudding mix to help cover the whole pie without messing up the cream cheese layer.  I did not add more milk like others have done because I liked the consistency of the thick pudding mixture.

I started making this recipe last Christmas, and its been a hit every single time.  I made one for a Superbowl party, and it went so fast, that for the Memorial day party, I'm making 2! I also increased the milk a little.  I have at other times combined the pudding mixture with the cheesecake mixture, to make a "chocolate cheesecake", and I use different toppings, like crushed pecans or chocolate morsels.  When I'm in a hurry, a store bought graham cracker or oreo cookie crust works just as well.  Thanks for this recipe! Everyone asks for it, and its like I've got my own "specialty" now!

Yum! This is similar to Butterscotch Pecan Dessert here on allrecipes. I also adjusted the milk, added  a bit of sugar to the crust, vanilla to the cream cheese and baked for 15 minutes. This is my shortcut version but when I want to take it to share with friends I make my own chocolate pie filling and use whipped cream. Either way it's a favorite. I can't wait to try it with butterscotch pudding.

My 4 year old and I just made this tonight! We had alot of fun. I would warn that the cream cheese filling is THICK and be careful when spreading as to not break your crust. We used an oreo crust in place of pecan. I also added a layer of mini chocolate chips before serving.

This recipe is much richer than the other versions I've had of this at potluck's. I just made this last night and seriously, it comes out to be 2/3 cream cheese/cool whip mixture to 1/3 pudding. In my opinion, I think it needs to be the other way around (2/3 pudding, 1/3 cream cheese) so that you're not overwhelmed with this almost sickeningly-sweet cream cheese mixture, but hey, that's just my opinion. Next time I make this, I will definitely cut in half the cream cheese mixture. Also, follow the advice of others and do 1 1/2 - 1 1/3 cup milk instead of 2/3 cup. Just use as much milk as you prefer the consistency for. 1 1/2 cups milk is still PLENTY thick. Good luck!!

Wow!!! Great recipe and really easy! It tastes like it's from a restaurant. I read other reviews, but made no big changes other than using two 4oz boxes of pudding instead of one 6oz box.  Consequently, I changed the milk amount to 1 cup. I think the pudding is supposed to have a very thick consistency for flavor and to help the pie hold shape.  I used a spatula and my fingers to spread the pudding layer.  The best part by far was the crust! I didn't have pecans so I used mostly crushed walnuts with some macadamia nuts and pecans too. Fabulous and Easy!! I will use this crust for many other pies to come! My only complaint is that there was no estimate of time for browning the crust, so I had to check on it repeatedly. It ended up taking around 40 minutes to brown in the middle.

The flavor of the pie is great, but it doesn't hold well at all. I had to put it in the freezer overnight to get a decent firmness. Before I did so, every slice toppled over, and the whipped topping literally oozed out like liquid all over the pie and plate. It NEEDS to be put in the freezer, not the refrigerator.

Yum Yum! I made for a friends birthday and she loves it. I used sugar free chocolate pudding...it was all i had and it still was good. The crust was a titch hard to cut with a fork. I would not cook as long the next time..maybe until the crust was light light brown. thanks!

This pie has the exact consistancy, style as peanut butter pie. The crust is really what makes this pie, I plan on using it on other pies in the future. I found the flavors kind of lacking though, needs more umphh. Perhaps 4 oz. of unsweetened chocolate, 2 TBSP of margarine melted and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar mixed and added to the top of the pudding before the whipped topping is put on.

oh.mi.gosh. I made this for some guy friends and as soon as they took the first bite, their eyes got HUGE and they couldn't stop eating. It seriously tastes like something from a restaurant. I made it the night before and refridgerated it, which worked well. The crust tastes exactly like an Almond Sandies cookie (I added a little brown sugar.) I used 1 1/3 cup milk so the chocolate layer would be a bit bigger but other than that, no changes. I will make this again and again!

Excellent. I doubled the recipe and prepared it in an oblong cake pan. I used French Vanilla and Cheesecake pudding together. Topped with peanut butter chips, mini chocolate kisses and toffee bits for my husband's birthday dessert. Everyone loved it.

VERY GOOD RECEPIE.  AT FIRST I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH ALL THAT RICH CHOCOLATE; BUT I INCREASED THE MILK TO 1 1/3 CUP MILK IN THE PUDDING MIX. IT WAS WONDERFUL.  THAT CRUST IS OUT OF THIS WORLD, AND SO SIMPLE.  THIS RECEPIE IS ALOT LIKE ONE MY STEP MOM CALLED "DREAM WHIP PIE", COULD NEVER FIGURE OUT HOW SHE MADE THAT CRUST AND NOW I KNOW... THANKS

I decided to make this pie for my husband since he loves cream pies and I do not. Ok this tastes great but I ran into a few problems, #1 everyone is right about milk measurement, #2 my pie pan was regular not deep so I had to remove some of the cream cheese mixture before putting chocolate or else it wouldn't have fit. Now I can't rate the crust since I didn't follow directions but I recommend doing what I did, which is using frozen pie crust thawing it and adding the pecans to that. Overall everyone loved it but it was a bit much next time I'll make it in a 9x13. And if your worried about a packaged taste like another reviewer mentioned I'm not a fan of that taste either and I didn't think this tasted overly packaged if it did it was too good to care :)

Another reviewer was right.  2/3 C. milk cannot be correct.  My mom gave me a similar recipe 20 years ago that calls for 2 3-oz. pkgs chocolate pudding mixed with 3 C. milk.  THAT is correct.  Mom's recipe also has 2 T. sugar in the crust mix.  I use chopped walnuts in the crust, instead of pecans.  Chilling 1.2 - 2 hours is preferred, but not necessary at all.  It's nice to top the top layer with chopped nuts and shaved chocolate for a pretty presentation.

I made this pie for Christmas, it was gone in a flash, I did change it a little, I used a boughten  pie crust, I used 2 puddings and 1 3/4 cups of milk, I used chopped almonds instead of pecans, I put those on top of pudding. 
  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will make it again.

Great pie - I agree with other reviews.  Needs much more than 2/3 cup of milk to chocolate pudding.  I used 1 1/2 cups.

I loved this pie!! Except for a couple minor changes. I added some oreo cookies into the crust, and a little less butter! Amazing! And extra milk in with the pudding. And nuts and chocolate syrup on the top! :) Yummy!!

This pie is to die for! The recipe says 5.9oz. pkg instant chocolate pudding mix , which is a powder mix,  which requires 2/3 cups of milk to make a pudding in the recipe. Not instant pudding. Hope this helps .

This recipe has been in our family for many years now!  It is always requested at holidays!!!  I add a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and I make the pudding according to directions on the package.  You must follow the directions in this recipe to get the best crust!!!  Pecans are a must!  Absolutely delicious!!!  For the one review that said it was runny and needed to be kept in the freezer, the only possible explanation I could have is that they used the whipped stuff in a can...not "COOL WHIP"...it makes a big difference.  The stuff in the can does not hold together.  I've tried it!

I added 1 1/3 c milk to the pudding and it was so thick the mixture worked its way all the way up my beaters. Next time I will add more milk and some sugar to the crust. But overall, this was pretty good.

I would say this definitely makes too much for a 9" pie pan. I had to remove some of the cream cheese layer to make it fit. I will make it in a 9"x13" pan next time. It is also very rich, but still a good dessert.

This was very good! I thought the cream cheese filling tasted a bit too "cheesy" so I added vanilla and more powdered sugar and whipped topping to taste.  I also used mini personal sized pie crusts I found in the baking isle of my grocery store and used large zipper bags to pipe in both fillings, sprinkling toffee chips in between the layers.  Finally topping with whipped cream and more toffee chips.  Everyone at Thanksgiving raved about the pies!

This is a tasty pie, although the crust doesnt really like me. I think it wasnt cooked enough because it was falling apart really easily and it doesnt stay together when i cut it. Overall, its very good though.

I had some issues with the crust. Not sure why, but i ended up getting it to work. It seemed as though it had too much butter and just melted down.  Anyway, after getting it to work the pie tasted wonderful.  The filling is out of this world!  Will make it again, maybe even for Thanksgiving as a new option.

This was very tasty and held up nicely to lighter ingredients (neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese and light cool whip).  I also used a small box of pudding and 1 3/4 cps of 1 %milk.  Rich without being heavy.

This was so creamy and delicious and very easy to make.  My family raved about it.  I did make it with a pre-made graham cracker crust because my husband isn't wild about nuts and it was great that way.

Huge success with my husband's family.  I had to make an extra pie for my father-in-law!  I added toffee chips, white & brown sugar to the crust to give it a little extra kick.  I also added a few more table spoons of milk to the pudding.
Wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for this recipe because Imy family loves it so much.  Try it with fresh sliced peaches or strawberries.  My family is not that big but at large dinners we have to make two, especially if it is peach season.

My aunt makes a version of this recipe with chopped walnuts instead of pecans.  She spreads the remaining nuts on top of the whipped cream layer.  We've been bringing it to family parties for the past 15 years, and it's always the most popular dessert on the table!

what a great pie-- i have made this one years ago, but used a 9x13 baking dish and therefore more pudding, nuts, etc. i usually make it for large gatherings, since it's so much. everybody loves it in its chocolate incarnation, but i personally think it's best with a PISTACHIO pudding filling--mmmmmm! we call it "hoosier pudding pie".

All of my family loved this receipe.  I changed the crust to half flour and half gramham cracker crumbs and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and I also changed the milk amount to 1 1/3 cups. It made the dessert even more tasteful.

My parents freaked out when they tasted this pie. They couldn't believe that I made it. It was ten times better than their favorite pie, "Touch of Heaven" that they always get at their favorite restaraunt. This pie ROCKS!!!

This is excellent!! After reading all the reviews I also adjusted the amount of milk.  I used 2 2/3 cups of milk and it turned out perfect.  Also added about 3 tablespoons of sugar to the crust.

The recipe should have said how long to bake the crust.  It was a guessing game.  I added extra milk to the pudding, but should have added more.  it was too thick.  Not that great.

The dessert was very tasty. I topped with whipped topping prior  to refrigerating over night and had the same experience as someone else commented. Easter Sunday we took the pie out, and the whipped topping lost it's texture and when we cut into it the layers slid off. I will make this again, but will freeze it vs putting it in the fridge.

I came looking for this recipe - which is the same as one my mother has always made except that it is the size I was hoping to make ( a 9 inch pie pan versus a 9X12 giant pan ).  However, as written this recipe is WAY off.  I normally read the comments before making a recipe but this one looked just like what I wanted so I didn't do that this time.  The amount of milk called for in this recipe makes the pudding the consistency of glue and it's inedible.  After making this one as written I had to dump it out and try again with the suggested 1 1/3 cup of milk from other reviews.

I love this recipe. I didn't do the crust, I just bought a pre-made one. I also don't usually make pies so I didn't know I needed to soften the cream cheese before I mixed it. So other than the cream cheese chunks, lol, the pie was very delish. I used 1 1/2 cups milk as did the other reviewers and took the time to make the star topping out of the cool whip. I will defiantly be making this pie for Thanksgiving and other holidays.

I think the 5.9 ounce package of instant pudding mix was a typo- pretty sure it was supposed to call for the 1.5 ounce package. The chocolate mixture had the consistency of rubber, and sat in the middle of the soft cream cheese mixture. The cream cheese mixture tasted ok. The crust was bland and hard to mold to the sides of the pie pan.

Definitely needed extra milk like others have stated. Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. Next time I'll add some sugar to the crust.

This is sweet and indulgent, but very good. The other reviewers are right - the butter pecan crust really is amazing and makes this a stand-out. Otherwise, it's really just pudding, sugary cream cheese, and whipped cream (which--don't get me wrong--is delicious!). I made these adjustments: For the crust, I substituted half of the flour with graham cracker crumbs and added some sugar. It was hard to decide when to take it out of the oven. When I did, it was still kind of smushy, and only slightly brown. It turned out great though. I did as others recommended and cut in half everything involved with the cream cheese mixture part. A better ratio that way. I layered bits of toffee (about half of a Heath bag) on top of the cream cheese mixture. I used two 5.9 oz boxes of pudding mix and 2 and 2/3 cup milk. Worked great. I hate the artificialness of Cool Whip, so I made freshly whipped cream - If you haven't made it before, it is SO easy - look it up. You just need almost a whole 16 oz container of heavy cream (or whipping cream), some vanilla, and some sugar. I put toffee bits and chocolate shavings (just get a Hersheys bar and shave it with a vegetable peeler) on top.

Be warned that it does taste more like a cheesecake than a pie, but it was still delicious.

Very good! My son asked for this pie for Christmas dinner--he really loved it. I took the advice of others and used 1 1/3 cups milk for the pudding--and this was a perfect consistency for the chocolate pudding. I also added vanilla per the suggestion of others to the cream cheese mixture. The only problem that I had was the crust stuck to the bottom of the pie plate--I used a glass plate so maybe that was the problem.

Great recipe.  I was looking all over for this recipe and am so glad to have found it!  I use real whipped cream instead of Cool Whip (I think it tastes better plus you're not eating whipped corn syrup!)

I followed this recipe exactly as written except I used a store-bought Oreo crust.  I can understand that using less milk in the pudding mix makes for a thicker chocolate, however it was almost impossible to spread over the pie without breaking into the cheese layer below.  I am not sure if reducing/eliminating the confectioner's sugar would mess up the bottom layer's consitency, but the bottom of the pie was too uncomfortably sweet to enjoy.  I might make this again with some changes.

I made this twice over Thanksgiving week, and it got raves from everyone. I did adapt it slightly with some of the modifications suggested by others: 1 and 1/3 cup milk in the pudding, Heath bits sprinkled over the cream cheese layer and on top of the pie. Plus a few more pecans in the crust than were called for. I give it four stars only because I prefer dense, heavier desserts, and this is definitely on the fluffy side with all the whipped topping. But that's clearly only a matter of my personal preference, since my friends all asked for the recipe!

I love this pie.  It is a chocolate lover's dream.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a pre-made chocolate graham pie crust and it was delicious.

So easy, and everyone LOVED it. I made it for Thanksgiving for my husband's family, and they never eat dessert. I did not have any left! I liked the pecan crust, but honestly I think an oreo or graham cracker crust would be really good also, especially if you want to save some prep time. Great recipe!

The recipe does not state how long to bake the crust.  It took mine about 25 minutes to brown.  I added 1/4 cup sugar to the crust as many others recommended.  If you follow the other measurements as written, the chocolate layer will end up very thin in comparison to the very rich cream cheese layer.  I feel the pie would be better with the layers more equal so I definitely recommend increasing the amount of milk you add to the larger sized box of pudding.  I ended up using about 1 1/2 cups milk or more and I think next time I might even cut the cream cheese layer ingredients in half and use 2 boxes of pudding to get a more chocolately pie.  I substituted the lower fat neufchatel cream cheese without noticing any difference in richness at all.  I topped the whipped cream layer with chocolate shavings and it was very pretty.  This was a nice addition to my Thanksgiving pies this year.

This is a keeper. I made this pie for Thanksgiving dessert at my in-laws house. Big hit...even the picky toddler gobbled it up. As others suggested, I added white sugar (1/4 cup) to the crust. I could not find a 5.9 oz. package of instant pudding, so I used 2 3.6 oz. packages and followed the directions on the box for mixing, using 1/2 cup less milk than the directions called for.

This pie is absolutely delicious and easy to prepare! I considered changing a few things before I made it, especially because the crust sounded like it might be bland or something, but I'm glad I decided to just stick with the original recipe. Perfect as-is! Just made this today for Thanksgiving, thanks for the great recipe! :]

Nice smooth pie. Simple enough to whip up on a weeknight, but tastes so good you can serve with holiday dinners too. I think this pie will taste good with other pudding flavors. I am going to try pistachio next. Perhaps a butterscotch as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first pie I ever made and was really excited about it. I did add vanilla and extra milk like other people had suggested. My husband got home and I was so excited to show it off. It was sooooo good, but oddley familiar. My mom made this growing up in a 9/13 pan and called it Four Layer Delight!!! I was planning to take it for Thanksgiving but now I am not so sure, being it was her recipe!! Very, very good, will definitly be making it throughout the years!

This was great!  It was sooooo easy, yet tasted faboulous!  I ended up using two small boxes of pudding, and added a few leftover pecans to the top of the whipped topping.  It was a big hit at my family birthday party.

Made this to take to work as a pre-Thanksgiving treat, and my coworkers loved it.  I screwed up on the amount of chocolate pudding used, instead of the 5 oz called for in the recipe, I used the smaller 3.4 oz box.  Still turned out good, just didn't have as thick of a chocolate layer.  I can't give it a fair rating because I didn't make the crust, instead I used a pre-made Shortbreat crust.  I will make this recipe again though, using the crust called for in the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe, and my coworkers all say thanks too.

Nice & easy crust, very creamy smooth texture. I find Dream Whip topping nicer to use than the frozen topping. I could not find a 5.9ounce pkg of instant choc pudding anywhere? - all pkgs were 3.9ounce,(113g)With only 2/3 c milk this makes for a very thin chocolate layer. Will definitely make again but next time I will use more milk with the chocolate pudding (1 1/3c) as recommended in other reviews.

This was a really good pie.
A couple of the changes I made were to use graham cracker crumbs and white sugar to make the bottom crust, instead of a flour crust.  I also made the pudding according to the pie directions on the box and threw some chopped pecans on top for decoration.
This pie was gone quickly.

Chocolate was a little tricky to spread but it tasted wonderful and was a hit for my party!!!!  I topped it with whipped cream and some extra nuts and it looked beautiful.
