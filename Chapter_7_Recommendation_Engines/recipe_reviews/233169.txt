I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used about 1 T of fresh chopped cilantro. I also used olive oil. Other than those two substitutions, I followed the recipe. My husband and I thought the salad was delicious. It is good with or without the sesame seeds. I tasted the salad before I added them, and I think I liked it better. My husband likes it with them--it adds an Asian zing--so you can't go wrong either way. I will be making this salad often.

When eating pepper and garlic in an apple salad, this takes some getting used to!  I liked this because it was not sweet, and the tang of the lemon and vinegar came out!  I didn't have parsley, so used a bit of green pepper for an accent color.  When pumpkins are in season, this will be wonderful to replace the carrots with pumpkin!  This is a great recipe!  Thanks!

Tried it today exactly as the recipe went - with both vinegar, granny smith and lemon it was a little heavy on the acids for my taste. Next time I'll try some sweet apple and half the lemon or vinegar to see how I like it. 

The recipe is well worth trying just to be amazed of how much punch the tiny tiny sesame seeds contributes tho ;D I was very surprised, and pleasantly so. Remember to roast them for the full experience!

I bought, but then forgot to put in the sesame seeds.  Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was much too tart for my taste.  If I ever make it again, I would definitely use a sweet apple, and reduce the amount of lemon juice and vinegar.  The salad was easy to prepare, and very appealing visually.

Yummy & tangy. A great side dish. The only change that I made was that I did not have any safflower oil handy; used olive oil instead.

I made this yesterday.  Decided to double it as it didn't seem to make a lot.  I didn't have fresh basil so left it out.  I also used olive oil instead of safflower and a regular apple (I think a Braeburn) instead of a Granny Smith.  I didn't shred the apple or carrots--instead I used a vegetable peeler and made "ribbons."  The dressing completely overwhelmed the apples and carrots.  I think the concept is good but it would be better if the apples were finely diced; maybe do the same with the carrots; cut the dressing in half; maybe add some craisins, raisins, or other dried fruit.

The dressing was WAY too vinegar-y/lemony.  My husband and I could barely eat it as that's all you could taste.  Dressing overwhelmed any other flavors that might be in the salad.

This is one of those Why Didn't I Think of This? recipes.

Not all that complicated, uses ingredients that, just from reading the list, you KNOW will be fabulous together, but you'd never tried it till you saw it somewhere.

THANK YOU for being the one to think of it! I didn't have Granny Smiths, which tend to be huge, so I used two Pink Lady apples, instead. And I pretty much use olive oil for everything, so, of course, used that instead of safflower, along with the dried parsley I go through by the bushel.

I loved it so much that when I moved it from the tossing bowl to the serving bowl, I grabbed a spoon to snarf up the last of the shredded goodness and the juices that had mixed with the dressing. 

Served with saut√©ed shrimp and quinoa with a little EVOO and balsamic vinegar, with chopped almonds and dried cranberries. SUCH a lovely, easy dinner!

Didnt have lemon juice, substituted orange juice instead. Didn't use oil, just the Apple cider vinegar mixed with the maple syrup and spices and everyone loved it.

This is a refreshingly different carrot salad. Since an number of reviewers wrote that the dressing was too strong, I cut down on the vinegar and lemon juice - which was a good move; the amount listed would have been overpowering. I also felt it needed some sweetness, so I added a generous handful of dark raisins. With these changes, the salad was great.

~~UPDATE: all i can say is wow.. i stuck more to the original recipe this time.. omitting the sesame seeds, sugar, and oil.. used a braeburn apple for the green (it was on sale) and halved the salt.. i'm so happy i tried this again.. ~~ORIGINAL: this was so good.. i made some modifications based on what i know we enjoy and what i had on hand.. left out the sesame seeds and sugar.. subbed cucumber for the apple and olive oil (half the amount) for the safflower.. and doubled the garlic.. just what i was looking for.. something fresh, sour, and pungent.. ty for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: i seriously love this salad.. it's my new go-to.. i've found that i can use just half the salt and substitute the juice of a lime for the lemon and cider vinegar.. i'm so happy i found this recipe

The recipe was great, and the toasted sesame seeds added some extra umami to it.  Here's a tip:  make sure your dressing is ready before you grate your apple.  Mine turned brown while I got the dressing mixed up.  It still tasted great, but probably not as appealing visually.

I got a lot of carrots.  I made carrots raisin salad last night,  I liked it but my husband didn‚Äôt like creamy sweet salad like that.  Then I made this salad tonight.  I didn‚Äôt add sesame seed because I was lazy.  Otherwise I followed exactly.  It was very refreshing taste and I love it and my husband asked me his second bowl! I‚Äôll definitely make it again.

I just kind of eyeballed the ingredients listed, to my personal taste.  Didn‚Äôt have cider vinegar so did 1 tbsp apple juice 1 tbsp white vinegar.  Didn‚Äôt love it, but not because there was anything wrong with it! It‚Äôs a nice change, will make again for variety.

Cut back on the vinegar for sure, used garlic salt instead of fresh garlic to down play garlic breath. I,vet made several times always good. Fresh parsley is also a must.

This recipe is excellent. I used stevia instead of sugar & used a reviewers suggestion to use cucumbers instead of apple. Also used 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made as written, except for a couple mistakes. I added white vinegar instead of apple cider, and forgot the parsley. I also used olive oil as others did. It was very good, and will certainly make again.                 Don't forget the sesame seeds! Really adds a lot of flavor.

It's too vinegar-y for me.  I used a potato peeler and made ribbons of carrot and ribbons of apple.  It was beautiful in presentation but only one out of five of us actually liked it.  I did sub EVOO for the safflower oil but that was the only substitution I made.  :(

This salad has a distinctive, almost meaty taste, much different from the sweetness that I expected.
