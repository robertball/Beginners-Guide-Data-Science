I have never rated a recipe before, simply as all the recipes that I try from the site are fantastic, and much smarter cooks than I always give great feedback.  However, one tip on this recipe was SO helpful--Linda Mc advised to put the popcorn in the pan to warm in the oven before adding the brown sugar mixture, and that was the KEY.  The first batch (with cold popcorn) was a disaster, but with the warm popcorn in the roasting pan already, the mixing was a breeze and the batch was fantastic!  Thanks to everyone for all the tips that are so helpful!

Yummy!  I reduced the butter to 1/2 lb like others suggested - perfect.  I used a 12 quart stainless steel All-clad stockpot to pop kernels, make the caramel, and coat the popcorn (the pot was covered in oil from popping the corn and the caramel didn't stick - w/plenty of room to stir).  Note: there is no way you would ever find me mixing this in my sink - impeccably clean as it is, the thought is repulsive to me! (no offense to anyone who thinks this is acceptable).

Anyway, I poured the coated popcorn onto 2 silpat lined sheet pans (was fresh out of nonstick foil).  I only baked one of the sheet pans because the kids begged me to let them keep eating the other one.  For softer/chewy/shiny version, don't bake.  For firm/crispy/non-shiny version, bake, but reduce baking time to 45 min.  I used tongs to break up clumps while baking and cooling.  We loved both versions.  

Hints:  
1.  Reduce butter in half.
2.  Use a good quality, heavy pot.
3.  If possible, avoid microwave popcorn.
4.  Remove unpopped kernels before coating.
5.  Keep popcorn warm in 250 oven until  ready to coat.
6.  Stir with a silicone spatula.
7.  For softer/chewy/shiny version, don't bake.  For firm/crispy/non-shiny version, bake, but reduce time to 45 min.
8.  And most importantly, if you mix this in your sink, don't give any to me! :)

I am rating this recipe again because I was eating so much of this popcorn, its wonderful, that when I saw the review from the person who cut the butter to 1/2 cup I had to try it before I gained 50 pounds.  Understand I HATE to change something this good, afraid it won't be the same, but I have to say I can not tell the difference.  I kept everything the same but only used a half cup butter. PERFECT!! I use 3 bags ACT II Old Fashioned Natural microwave popcorn.  I have used more expensive popcorn but this works the best. Also, one thing I have learned after making so much of this popcorn is use a name brand brown sugar.  I picked up a store brand once because thats all they had and the coating came out grainny. Now with half the butter I'll probably just eat more. YIKES!!!

I've been making this same recipe for years, but I do it in the microwave.  You put the popped corn in a paper grocery bag.  Then you microwave the butter, sugar, vanilla, and corn syrup, letting it boil for one minute.  Then stir the baking soda into the caramel mixture.  Pour it  over the corn in the bag and shake it up.  Microwave the whole bag for about 30 seconds and shake it up again.  Spread it out on a lined baking sheet to cool down.  Tastes absolutely incredible, and done in under 10 minutes.

This recipe is the same one (minus the vanilla) my mother has been using for 20 years.

There is another way to cook this - use the microwave.  After mixing the popcorn and caramel, divide the corn into two paper grocery bags.  Microwave each bag for 30 - 40 seconds, remove the bag from the microwave and shake it.  Repeat microwaving and shaking for a total of 4 times for each bag.  Open the bags carefully and spread out the corn to cool - breaking up any large pieces. Clean up is easy - just throw away the bags.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is always a favorite for both young and old. It tastes better than anything you can buy in the store.

Here are my hints:
  
1.  always use "golden" brown sugar, not the dark brown which is likely to burn.
2.  bake it in a very large turkey roasting pan.  It will all fit and still be easy to stir.
3.  clean-up is very easy, just soak the pans for a minute in hot soapy water.  All the hard candy just melts away.
4.  Always buy double the ingredients(you'll be making it again the next day!)

5.  If there is any left over, store in an air tight container or it will get soft.

Make it once and it will be on your top 10 list too!

All I have to say is, I love it! I spread the popcorn out in the largest casserole dish I had, after coating with non-stick cooking spray, of course. I just poured on the carmel slowly and mixed it up as I went along.  My friend also commented on how well everything was coated. "The trick is" I told her,"to drizzle and mix frequently, then work it with your greasy fingers to spread any big clumps." :) Thanks!

This is absolutely the best caramel popcorn I have ever tasted. It is so much better than store bought. My entire family loved this popcorn, and it stays fresh for many days (I put it in a zip-loc bag). I only have 1 suggestion. Spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray so the popcorn doesn't stick to the pan. Thanks Brian! This recipe is wonderful!

I was a little worried about what kind and how much popcorn to use when I saw this recipe.  Do I use plain or butter? 2 bags? 3 bags? 4?  I ended up using 3 bags butter popcorn, popped in the microwave.  Picked out the kernels and cooked the rest on my jelly roll pan.  DELICIOUS!  I baked for about 40 minutes.  Next time I'll bake it for the full hour because it was a little too sticky to enjoy without picking at my teeth the whole time and the think the extra 20 minutes will help harden it a little more.  Also, next time I'll try plain popcorn b/c the butter seemed a little heavy.  Still, it was wonderfull and we ate the whole bag in only 2 days.  Thank you!

FYI 5 quarts popcorn = 1/2 cup unpopped corn. Excellent recipe! This tasted better than anything storebought. Next time I will add peanuts or pecans. For a real treat, I double the caramel part.  ***Use only 1/2 the butter (1 cup) and it's plenty rich enough.

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: I was doubtful about this recipe but let me tell you that my husband's soldiers went bonkers over something that was SO QUICK to make! If you have trouble mixing in the caramel that I do recommend just dumping it on top instead of trying to keep a thin stream ...just stick it in the oven for a few minutes for it to get hot again & then you can finish mixing! :)  As mentioned, the caramel will become foamy so don't worry, and do not try adding the vanilla PRIOR to taking it off the oven!  I use two disposable foil pans for turkeys side by side in the oven.  Always have one in the oven while mixing the other! Use enough butter so the caramel doesn't get too sticky (1/2C). I used 3 bags of buttered popcorn (brand REALLY isn't important), and I also don't find using cheap no-brand brown sugar to be a problem.  Really!  I've used all kinds of combinations of nuts and prefer macadamian and/or almonds.  I like using 2 pans b/c it gives you room to stir comfortably.  Be sure when you take out the pan to stir to get the bottom REAL well or you'll have one solid layer of caramel on the bottom.  Also, be sure to let this cool before breaking as directed in the recipe but stir one last time when you take it out of the oven.  You must put this back in the oven when the caramel begins to stiffen up b/c continuing to stir at this point is pointless as it breaks pieces of popcorn. Store in giant ziplock bag at room temp!

We love this recipe and have made it for years.  For my mother, who loved Cracker Jacks, I'd substitute 1/4 c. molasses for part of the corn syrup. I spray a large disposible foil "turkey" pan w/butter-flavored Pam and put the popped corn in.  Place the popcorn in the 250 degree oven to warm for 5 min while the syrup boils. (It's a little easier to stir syrup into popcorn if it's warm and the pan is big ).  You can leave caramel corn in roasting pan to cool if you gently stir once or twice while cooling. The Pam makes the roasting pan easy to clean, and a hot, soapy soak takes care of the caramel pot.  I keep the large foil pan tucked into a plastic bag in the closet so it's always available, two of them, as a matter of fact, since we always double the recipe.

absolutely deserving of its 5-stars!  following the advice of other reviewers i used only 1/2 cup of butter and i don't think that the other 1/2 cup was missed!  also, in case you are planning to make your own popcorn, 1/2 cup unpopped kernels = 5 quarts popped popcorn.  :)

I have made it a couple times now.  The first time was to fill X-mas tins as simple party gifts for the holidays, and now I made it to bring to a summer picnic/barbecue as a snack.  It's extremely easy to make, but can be a little time consuming, especially if you're making more than one batch at a time.  Here are a few things I've found to be helpful:  1. I have used both butter and margarine, and both turned out great.  2. I have used both light and dark corn syrup, and both turned out the same, but the dark syrup gives it a little more color.  3. I used large, heavy duty cookie sheets to bake it on, and had no problems.   4. I would recommend spraying your pans with cooking spray and if you want an easy clean-up line them with parchment paper.  5. If you want some of the caramel corn to stick together, make a little extra caramel mixture and drizzle it over the top of popcorn after mixing and placing on baking pans  6. If you are a fan of Poppycock/Fiddle Faddle popcorn, you can add 2 cups of your favorite nuts (almonds, pecans, or peanuts work best).  If you make the recipe with nuts, I recommend increasing your caramel mixture to 1 1/4 cups butter, 2 1/2 cups brown sugar, 2/3 cup corn syrup, and 1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla

This recipe started out well...until I put it in the oven. I had my oven set to 250 degrees and at the end of the hour, my popcorn tasted slightly burnt. I'll try this again, but bake at a lower temperature.

Fantastic recipe! But I can't look at a cup of butter and wonder if it could be reduced a bit and yield the same results, so the first time I tried it with 2/3 C. butter and it was perfect.  Next time I got a bit bolder and used only a half a cup of butter and it was perfect again!! It tastes the same and is light and crispy just like the original, maybe not quite as rich, but who cares when you just cut the fat by half!!  Also, the second time I didn't have the corn syrup at home so I used pancake syrup, you can't tell.  Great recipe!

Very Yummy, it's the same recipe I use for Puffed Wheat Squares as well, minus the baking soda.

I too use only 1/2 a cup of butter (margarine squares are fine if you have it on hand and no butter but don't use soft margarine)

TIP: 1/2 cup unpopped popcorn = 4 quarts popped so for those who had other measurements I thought this would help.
I basically pour the 1/2 cup then overpour slightly. 
This is ONLY true for FRESH popcorn (check the packaged date) if it is older/dryer it will make smaller, tougher popped corn and so you should use more.

2nd TIP: DO NOT stir candy while it is boiling, it is a rule of candy... for those who experienced grainy texture this is why.

Temperature and time affect how candy performs which is true for the initial boiling and the baking of the corn afterwards. Find what you like and make a note for yourself. Less time boiling = chewier candy, more = harder.

Enjoy!

There is already a lot of great advice on here, but I’ll add my two cents. First LUV this recipe!  It’s especially great around the holidays.  I’ve even been asked if I bought it at a specialty store when I gave this popcorn to guest.  Now my tips for making the popcorn:  1. I use microwave popcorn find a brand that is “natural” – but be careful that it doesn’t have butter or salt added. 2. I pop the corn while the caramel is on the stove, this cuts down on the cook time and as a bonus the popcorn is warm when you pour the sauce on (when you use three bags, pop one bag before you start then the last two while you cook the sauce). 3. Make sure you don’t just dump the bag in the tray, keep unpopped kernels out. *3.  I get a disposable turkey pan from the dollar store – NO MESSY clean up! 4. ***This is real important*** after you take the popcorn out of the oven keep stirring it!!!!! Otherwise it clumps together. It usually takes 5-10 mins to cool; I’ll stir it 3-4 times in that period to insure that I don’t end up with a few big clumps of popcorn, that then have to be crumpled into ugly bits.

I make this every year for Christmas and put in the big popcorn tins everyone ends up collecting.  I give them to friends and family and they don't get any the next year unless they return the tin.  I use a large Rubbermaid tub to put the popcorn in and fill it about 1/2 to 3/4 full and I also make the syrup mixture in the microwave in a large 4-cup measuring cup.  I melt the butter, syrup and brown sugar for 3 min. and then add the baking soda (and vanilla- which I don't use) and then it's in for another minute.  When you pour it over the popcorn all you have to do is shake the big tub until all the popcorn is coated - works great and not messy at all.  I also use the aluminum turkey roasting pans and I store all of my "equipment" in a big trash bag in the basement when not using.

This is a great recipe!  To save yourself the cleaning headache, dump the popcorn and caramel into a large paper grocery bag and shake.  No bowls to clean!  I only cook this for 45 mins, stirring every 15.  I drizzle chocolate over the top. It's a great addition.  Very tasty!

this recipe is fantastic. its simple, and delicious. better than the carmel popcorn you purchase. a couple HELPFUL suggestions : do NOT use dark brown sugar. must be light. ALSO - i found the BEST. EASIEST. CLEANEST way to do the final step ( pouring caramel over the popcorn) is to not use a large bowl - USE a brown paper bag ( brown grocery bag) and double bag it. coat ENTIRE inside with pam or any kind of cooking/butter spray. while caramel is boiling, put half of your popcorn in the bag. when the caramel is done, simply pour half of it over the popcorn in the bag. then, quickly add the left over other half of popcorn to bag, and pour remaining caramel over that. squeeze top of bag closed and shake vigorously and in all different directions, to evenly coat popcorn with the caramel! This method honestly works fantasticly and cuts your clean up time in 1/2. No sticky dried caramel bowls or spoons to clean! just throw bag out after pouring caramel popcorn onto oven trays.   :) hope this brings some peace and ease to a few! happy holidays .   ALSO- for a smaller batch - i recalculated serving size to 10 , and with this i used a bag and a half of popcorn. worked out perfectly. even just one bag of popcorn would be fabulous, just a teeny bit thicker coat of caramel on top.

I had trouble with this recipe.  The caramel always came out granulated and the taste wasn't quite right.  I adjusted it and now it is PERFECT.  I made the following modifications: 1/2 tsp. salt, 3/4 cup corn syrup, and 1 tsp. baking soda.  The measurement for unpopped kernals equals 2 cups before popping.  TIP:  If you put the popped popcorn in a paper grocery bag and cut a small hole in one corner, you can shake out the unpopped kernals (because you definitely don't want "old maids" in your caramel corn).  WARNING:  You really need to use a large saucepan for the caramel mixture, because once you add the baking soda, the mixture foams up and increases volume considerably.  That could be messy!  I put the popped popcorn in a roasting pan and pour the caramel over top.  Mix well with a spatula and bake at 200F for 1 hour without stirring. YUM!

Excellent recipe!  A trick for keeping the unpopped kernels out...put a cookie cooling rack on top of your bowl of popcorn, flip it over and shake the kernels out.  I also put half of the cooled caramel popcorn in a large bowl and coat with melted white chocolate, lay it out on waxed paper to cool.  Then toss with the remaining caramel corn. Yummy!

Brian, you da man! In search of caramel popcorn comparable to Garret's of Chicago, I think I found it.  I used a very large/deep aluminum foil baking pan sprayed with vegetable spray to bake the popcorn. It was well worth the steps.Threw in some macadamia nuts in the caramel before baking.Ono!   Aloha!

OMG! This stuff is so addictive! Way better than any caramel corn I've purchased. And really easy. I made my own popcorn. I figured out that 10 Tbsp. unpopped kernels = 5 quarts popped corn. Which is 1/2 C. + 2 Tbsp of kernels and used 3 tbsp. oil to pop corn in - perfect! I honestly made this for the first time yesterday - and just made another batch as I ate so much that my kids and husband would have only had a small handful each when they got home! ALSO.... I did as someone else suggested and made in 1 large roasting pan (an aluminum disposable one) and this fit the popcorn perfectly and was big enough to stir popcorn without a problem (cleaned and used it again - this will probably be my "popcorn pan"). ;-)

Tastes so good, I cant believe how easy this was to make!  I didn't have corn syrup, so I used honey instead and this worked well for me.    A helpful tip: rather than drizzle the caramel over the popcorn, I made the caramel in a giant pot and dumped the popcorn into that pot instead and coated the popcorn in there.  That way the caramel is still warm and manages to coat all the popcorn easily.  I was able to coat twice the amount of popcorn with the same amount of caramel syrup this way.

This is addictive! I doubled the recipe and added a can of mixed nuts to each to make it more like the store bought stuff. I also bought disposable roasting pans to mix them in and I am glad I did! It was easier to mix and no clean up!

I have a TNT recipe for caramel corn, but needed a big batch so I chose this one instead, as sometimes doubling candy recipes can be disastrous. It's greasy when fresh, but after a few hours, is perfect! You need two VERY large bowls to mix this up, unless you have one gigantic heatproof container. Be sure to remove any unpopped kernels before mixing, and because you put two large baking sheets in the oven at the same time, rotate the pans as you bake, to prevent the bottoms from burning. Also be sure to line the pans with foil. A little more than 1/2 a cup of kernels yielded 5 quarts of popped corn for me.

I've made this so many times in 30 yrs, I gave it 5 stars, but thats with just 1 stk of butter, 1 cup of brn sugar, and 1 tsp of soda. I also pop my corn stove top w/ veg oil.  I bake it in a large roaster pan for the same amount of time, stirring every 15 minutes. Super Bowl Must have!!

ummm ummm good!  2 bags of microwave popcorn and a cup of peanuts are perfect with this caramel recipe.  I baked it for only about 40 minutes, stirring every 10.  It was fabulous, all my friends raved.  7/11/08 Update:  I put aside my skeptical thoughts and followed other reviewers by decreasing the butter to only 1 stick (1/2 cup).  It still turned out amazing!  I can't believe it!  Oh, and those people who use 3 bags of microwave popcorn....I don't know what they're thinking because I barely had enough caramel to coat my 2 bags.  Seriously.  This is a fabulous recipe, though.  Make it, you won't be sorry!

This is the best carmel corn recipe I have found.  My kids love this.  We use 3 large microwaveable bags of popcorn.  It's a bit messy to stir in shallow pans and you'll need two but it is well worth a few crumbs.

This is very good caramel popcorn! I also drizzled half of it with chocolate which makes it even better!! 
Tip: Be sure to keep your heat level at medium even while boiling. I made the mistake of turning it up to boil and it burned my caramel the first time!:(

This was outstanding and extremely easy to make.  If you are using a candy thermometer, boil to 260 degrees.  I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn (fat free)and there was plenty of syrup to cover all.

I worked in a popcorn shop for 3 years. This is very similar to our recipe, except we popped our popcorn the old fashioned way. This receipe works better with buttered microwave popcorn if you like the buttery flavor that is essential to the caramel taste. If you substitute, margarine for butter, then use buttered popcorn. The other secret to good caramel popcorn, other than name brand, Dixie sugar, is the vanilla, use pure vanilla, not extract and if you have access to vanilla from Mexico or the Caribbean island, this is the best. I've been making this recipe for 8 years. Still love it!!!

Wow, this recipe is great!  I started out by popping plain popcorn over the stove, instead of using microwave popcorn.  The only thing is that after I added the baking soda and vanilla, my sauce became pretty foamy.  I was not able to pour it in a thin stream.  I just kind of dumped it over the popcorn and stirred to coat.  By the time I took it out of the oven to cool, all the popcorn was evenly coated in the caramel.  I also only baked it for a total of 45 minutes.

I scaled this recipe down to half. I use 7 - 8 cups of popped corn. Here's the trick: spread popcorn onto a large lightly greased baking pan. Place in 250 degree oven to keep warm while you make the caramel syrup. Drizzle caramel syrup holding the ladle or spoon up high to get the thin stream. Carefully toss to coat then stir every 10 to 15 minutes; for me this only takes 30 to 45 minutes..comes out perfect every time! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

It was super easy! I used one cup of unpopped popcorn and it was the  perfect amount for the candy part of the recipe.  There's a tip to cleaning the pot, just boil some water and you'll have a pot that has no more sugar in it. Also someone mentioned about graniness, make sure the candy mixture is fully incorporated and if there are any sugar left undissolved it can recreate sugar crystals and make it crystalize again. Hope that helps! THanks for the recipe! Edit: The popcorn lasts a week covered in an airtight container. I've also made it with some homemade salted nuts and the sweet and salty combo is yummy!

This was excellent!  Mine came out perfect after 45 minutes.  As far as the clean up...tinker toys, I immediately soaked the bowl & pan in hot water and it came right out. Next time I will use peanuts & stir it a little while it's cooling so that it doesn't come out in 1 big clump ;)  Thanks Brian!!

This is the best caramel corn recipe in the world. The ratings don't lie!  Everyone loves it at Bunco and at parties. For a twist I melt some semi sweet chocolate chips, between 3/4 of a cup to 1 1/2 cups, depending on how much popcorn I want to cover, and toss some of the the baked, COOLED caramel corn with the chocolate until evenly covered. Spread out on a covered tray to cool. I store the chocolate covered corn in a seperate zip lock and then mix in with the plain caramel corn when I am ready to serve it.  I like half chocolate covered and half plain but I love chocolate. A ratio of 1/4 chocolate to 3/4 plain is similar to Harry & David's Moose Mix but it tastes even better.

I had to make this twcice in one day the first time I cooked the carmel mixture too long. The second time it was just perfect. I used dark corn syrup because that is what I had on hand. I did not bake in the oven aas long as it says though because my carmel looked as if it was starting to burn. I was using a dark pan??? but either way with half my cooking time it was great and I could not keep my hands out! I will try with peanuts next time. Definatly will make again and again. Thank you!

This is a great recipe. If  you want to make it even easier as I aways do, you can make the whole thing in the microwave. Put your butter, sugar and corn suryp in a large bowel and micro it until it boils. Once it starts to boil set the timer for 3 min. Then add your baking powder. Have your popped corn in a large brown paper bag. Pour the caramel mixture over the popped corn. Close the bag and shake well. Then with the bag still folded over, place the whole thing back in the microwave for 3 min. shaking once half way through. When the 3 min is up give once last good shake and lay the corn out on wax paper to cool. I think this is much easier than the oven way and turns out just as yummy. It also is harder to burn this way.

THIS IS GOOD. I POP THREE BAGS OF LIGHT MICROWAVE POPCORN, REMOVE THE OLD MAIDS, AND PLACE ON PARCHMENT PAPER LINED COOKIE SHEETS.  I BAKE ONLY FOR ABOUT 35 MINUTES. I THOUGHT THE CLEAN UP WAS VERY EASY NOT ONLY ON MY COOKIE SHEETS, BUT THE PANS AND SPOONS AS WELL. THANKS BRIAN!

SO GOOD – it melts in your mouth!  I have made this many times over the last six years!  It is just down right yummy!  I use two regular size bags of microwave popcorn making sure to fish out any un-popped kernels, and I always add deluxe mixed nuts.  I strongly suggest you use a larger saucepan than you think you’ll need, because once you add the vanilla and baking soda it will really bubble up and that stuff is HOT!!  I have found a 3-quart saucepan works perfectly.  I bake mine in two large disposable aluminum turkey roasting pans that I spray with Pam.  That gives me plenty of room to stir during the baking process.  The caramel sinks to the bottom so it is important when stirring to lift and scoop it up over the top of the popcorn so it becomes evenly coated.  I also find that in my oven I need to bake this a little longer to get it nice and crispy.  To be sure check a piece or two to check for crispiness.

I too have been using this recipe for years. It's very important to use butter not margarine. Margarine has too much water in it. Instead of vanilla, I've used rum flavour. I've also used maple flavour. Both are excellent. As I use salted butter, I do not add any additional salt. When I bake it, I line my sheets with parchment paper. Makes stirring and clean-up easy.

Absolutely addictive and delicious!  I used a large tinfoil roasting pan (sprayed with pam) to mix and bake the popcorn in one big batch.  Also, if you want to add peanuts, add them the last 15 minutes of baking so that the nuts don't burn.  Wonderful recipe - I brought some to work and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.

This is perfection in caramel corn, and pretty easy to make.  I added nuts to one batch, and none to another and it is great either way.  This recipe's best friend is the fairly new "non-stick" aluminum foil.  Line your pan in the non-stick foil and there is no mess to clean up and it doesn't stick to the foil as it cools!  That foil is amazing, especially for this sticky recipe.

Yum, yum, yum.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!!

Excellent! I added whole almonds! Instead of using 1/2 cup of corn syrup, I only used 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup real maple syrup! Yummers! We couldn't stop eating it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is absolutely superb! The caramel is thick and sweet, but not overpoweringly so. It is also really easy to make, which is always a plus. I made this exactly as written, and was impressed with the final product. My family really loved it, which made me happy. Thanks for sharing this recipe...it's a keeper for sure!!!

If you have an air popper, use it for this recipe. The finished product is crispier and a lot less greasy. A roasting pan is very handy, too.

Soo easy, soo good, I found this turns out much better when using brand name brown sugar, as generic sugars gave it agrainy texture.

The best carmel corn ever!. I Used Paul Newmans Natural microwave popcorn and it turned out awesome. I put the popcorn in a brown grocery bag and poured the carmel mixture in there. No hassel and no clean up. One word of advise, make sure you take any unpopped kernels out before you pour the carmel mixture. I forgot and there were a couple of extra hard bites...ouch.

I have made this recipe so many times, it's the best!!!  Made exactly as is using 2 bags of the natural popcorn(just make sure to pick out all the unpopped kernals).  Caramel popcorn is one of my favorite snacks, something we always pick up when we go to the beach, but this is better than Fischer's popcorn.

This is an excellent recipe.  I love caramel corn from Garrett's in Chicago but it is so expensive, I wanted to try and make it at home.  My family agrees this is very close.  Follow the recipe exactly, use jelly roll pans, non-stick aluminum to cover the pans (a great tip from previous reviewers), AND a silicon spatula to do all your stirring.  It is highly heat-resistant and naturally non-stick.  BE SURE TO STIR WELL every 15 minutes as the recipe calls.  It is critical.  My first batch did not turn out as well as the second because I did not stir thoroughly.  Also, do not use too much of the syrup - use just enough to coat thoroughly but not where it is dripping off the popcorn and depending on your oven you may not need to bake the popcorn the whole hour.  Baking too long even by just a few minutes will cause it to scorch.  Hope these tips help!  It is really delicious!

This recipe was wonderful! I added peanuts to it and it tasted great. However, I only had to bake mine for 45 minutes instead of half an hour. Also, the clean-up was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I will certainly make this again.

YUMMMMMMMMY!  This is the best carmel corn I ever had.  Way better than anything you could buy!  My daughter and I made it while playing cards.  She raced over every 15 minutes to stir.  This is so yummy!  It was perfect after the third stir (45 minutes), but we kept it in the whole hour.  I will definitely make this again and for sure add some nuts to it.  I think I will make this for Christmas for the teacher's gifts.  I thought the pan would be a nightmare to clean; I couldn't believe it when I soaked it in hot water how it was perfectly clean!  Thanks Brian!  Now how about a recipe for cheesy popcorn?

Got so many compliments on this recipe!!  I added assorted nuts to the popcorn and then added the syrup.  Then I got smart: made another small batch of syrup, covered the nuts with it and then baked it. Then mixed the caramel popcorn with the caramel nuts. The recipe says to bake the popcorn in a shallow pan but I used a couple turkey roaster pans so I could really stir it up without everything getting all over.

Great recipe!  I followed the advice and bought a big roasting pan.  No need for nonstick cooking spray with all the butter in the recipe.  I only cooked for 30 minutes because I like it a little chewy.  I stirred it twice and it turned out great!

I followed Sallycat's advice and made this in the microwave.  It was extremely easy to make and very tasty.  For anyone else who isn't sure how much popcorn 5 quarts is there are 4 cups per quart so 20 cups of popped corn is needed.  Thanks for posting!

SUPER DELICIOUS!  I followed the directions written for 1 batch, and I also made another batch in the mocrowave as others suggested.  What a time saver the microwave was. It was excellent! My hubby preferred the micro batch over the oven one.  So save an hours time and just keep in a paper bag and microwave it.  Be sure to take out and shake it every 40 seconds or so.   Also I drizzled melted chocolate over the last batch, it is perfect PMS snacking lol

I have made the Amish Friends Caramel Popcorn recipe for the last couple years. It was O.k. I came across this one and tried it. IT WAS THE BEST OF THE BEST! I don't know if it is the butter vs margerine because otherwise the recipe is the basically the same besides that and the amount of popcorn used.  I made over 100 cups of this to give as Xmas Gifts. A HIT! I was getting phone calls left and right with compliments. I would suggest using 1 stick of unsalted butter and 1 stick of regular butter. I used 2 1/2 bags of Microwave Light Popcorn and sprayed a brown paper grocery bag for tossing this. I would also recommend cooking it for only 45 min. stirring every 15. Otherwise it could taste burnt a bit. And lastly I drizzled mine with white and dark chocolate! GREAT!!

By the way, for those wondering 1/2 cup of unpopped popcorn will give you 5 quarts of popped.  Very good, very easy.  I followed the tips about adding only half the butter and using warm popcorn. I cooked the popcorn in a kettle and mixed it up in the kettle as it was already pre-oiled, transferred it to my turkey roasting pan and it was really easy.  What I tasted in between the stove and it going into the oven was delicious!

This stuff is AWESOME! My first time making caramel and it was easy. :) However, "drizzling it slowly" wasn't. It was somewhat difficult to mix in the big bowl while pouring the caramel at the same time. Would have been easier w/ a helper. Next time I think I'll lay the popcorn out on cookie sheets and try it that way first. I followed the recipe exactly...only cooked it for 45 min though. I was clumsy and dropped one of the pans on the floor...so I didn't have as much as I wanted. I'll be making more this weekend. ;) Would be excellent in cute little cellophane bags tied w/ a ribbon as gifts. :)

Made this recipe today. took me about 15 minutes prep time. I used 2 popped bags of popcorn & cut the amount of salt in half. And only baked it for about 20-30 minutes because the caramel coating smelled like it was starting to burn.  It tastes great!  FYI-5 Quarts is 20 Cups of popcorn 1 Quart=4 Cups

This is a really great recipe.  I add pecans to it to make it that much better and more decadent.  :-)

I actually pop my own popcorn and for 5quarts poppped it's about 1 cup of unpopped kernels.  

When I mix it, I put half of the popcorn in the bowl and pour half of the caramel and stir then repeat the step.  This allows for complete coverage.  

Yummy!

Yummy!! I just finished making this and let it cool for a couple of hours now. I'll tell you exactly what I did. I used margarine instead of butter because I didn't have any. As far as I know, this did not alter the taste, it's awesome! I took someones suggestion to use aluminum roasting pans, but I doubled the recipe so I had to use one of my pans. So easy to make! Here's a tip for cleaning the messy pans and stuff after, I filled the pans with hot water and about 1/8 cup baking soda and a couple of drops of dishsoap and let it soak for an hour. The stuff just lifted itself right off. Extra cool!  Thank you for this recipe!!

This caramel popcorn is phenomenal!!! I use popcorn kernels in my old popcorn machine. Don't cut the butter in half. I have read what many other people said, to cut the butter amount in half and don't think it is a good idea. It is fine the way it is. I make this recipe really often for going to movies (and sneak it in of course) or whenever I'm bored and my friends are over. Everyone in my family loves to eat this. Whenever I make it, it is gone within 24 hours. Thanks Brian!

Excellent recipe. I have some tips that will perhaps help somewhat.
1. I use a nonstick to prevent the sugar from burning during it's 4 minute boil time.
2. Work quickly to prevent the caramel from hardening up too quickly before you've had a chance to spread it around on the popcorn.
3. After taking the popcorn out of the oven, break the popcorn up on a wax or parchment sheet BEFORE it hardens.
4. Try using butter flavored popcorn for an interesting, more buttery flavor.
5. Try adding nuts, such as honey roasted peanuts, salted peanuts, pecans, use your imagination!

This was really good and very sweet.  I made it for new years and everybody liked it.  I liked my baking sheet with foil and greased it and I sprayed my spatula with cooking spray before stirring each time.  Nothing stuck at all.  It was very easy to make.  Next time I make it I am going to add a little bit of almond extract along with the vanilla.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit at our fishing cabin. Everyone there loved it.
Cleanup was a breeze! I simply put some hot water in the pans and put them back in the warm oven while we visited. Whem I came back about an hour later, all the caramel had dissolved and the pans were practically clean already.

Make sure you use the higher quality brown sugar, as suggested before.  I used a store brand because that's what I had, and it was a bit grainy.  Otherwise, delicious!  Also, use parchment paper in your baking pans to make the popcorn stir easily and makes cleanup much easier.

Yum Yum Yum!! I love this recipe. I always add a cup or two of cashew nuts just before I pour the mixture over the popcorn. I was wondering if anyone can help me convert this recipe to a low-fat low-sugar one? (crazy, I know!) Both of my parents have diabetes, but both fell in love with this popcorn, and eat it anyway.

CARAMEL PUFFCORN!!!!!
This recipe deserves more than 5 stars, but that's all the higher they go! I did change one thing with it, I used PUFFCORN instead of popcorn. You can find this at any grocery store in by the bagged chips. I used the 7 oz. bag (which according to the nutritional value readings is 21 cups) and scaled the recipe for 20 servings, PERFECT!!! This is a great tasting caramel for either regular popcorn or the puffcorn, I just prefer the puffcorn, it's lighter and has a "melting" effect in your mouth Try it just once, you'll be hooked on puffcorn! The recipe is very easy to follow and not time consuming at all. Some other reviews stated it took too long, set your timer on your oven to go off every 10-15 minutes and go stir, that's pretty easy to me! It may seem like it takes a long time to those mouth watering children gazing into the oven though! It's well worth the wait though!

This is absolutely wonderful. I added a cup of peanuts to the popcorn before I poured on the caramel. It tastes great. Spray the pan with vegetable spraty to help prevent sticking.

I love carmel corn, have tried all different recipes but this one is my favorite.  I bake mine in a roasting pan.  This stores a long time in an airtight container.

I think this is the best you can get in caramel popcorn! These are just wonderful, i couldn't stop eating! Mine burned on the top but i think it was my oven's problem, i took them out and ate the bottom ones. The flavour is great, buttery and sweet and the crunchiness is just right!

This is a terrific recipe.  I've found that using a turkey roasting pan works best as it can hold all of the popcorn at once.  Use a plastic spatula to stir the popcorn during baking as the caramel does not stick as much to it as a metal or wooden spoon.  I used half the butter and even though the caramel was frothy and did not pour easily, it spread evenly enough during the mixing.  My husband was impressed by it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe now for several months...I was having trouble with the mixture sugaring after being in the oven for the hour, but I read somewhere's that if you use name brand brown sugar (such as C & H) I wouldn't have that problem... so I tried it and it's been working ever since!  So use name brand brown sugar for a much better outcome!

I made this again and still give it five stars! This time I used foil roasting pans as others have suggested and they worked great! It saved time on the clean up and actually I delivered the popcorn in the same foil pan.

I made this for my family and they went crazy for it and had me make for my Sunday school class the next Sunday. I use butter lovers microwave popcorn(4 bags) and omitted the salt. I also place they popcorn in one bowl and removed it by hand to the bowl I mixed it in. This prevented me from having unpopped kernels.

great recipe! Tasted just like caramel popcorn from the cinema! I didnt put it in the oven though as it hardens the moment i drizzled the caramel onto the popcorn. It tasted like caramel candy, was really crunchy.. i thought it harden way too fast. I omitted the baking soda as i had run out of it. It tasted great to me though.

Caramel popcorn is one of my very favorite treats, so I make it pretty frequently.  Since I found this recipe, it's been the only one I've used!  Sometimes I don't even bake the popcorn after it's mixed with the caramel (I can't wait an hour to eat it!!) - I throw it in the microwave for a couple minutes then let it sit a couple more to get slightly crunchy.  I've had no problems scaling this down to about 1/4 the recipe, which my husband and I can handle in a matter of minutes.  :-)

This is my second time making it.  Not sure why but it came out way better the first time I made it.  I have a feeling it was the type of popcorn I used.  I used the Orville brand movie theater microwave type this time.  The first time I made it, i forgot which brand I used, but the kernels where larger and more fluffy.  
But I love this recipe! Follow exactly, and what ever you do, do not use a small pan to make the caramel, like I did.  It boiled over and my poor stove, I think it's ruined :(

Great recipe!!  I halved the ingredients and made it exactly as the recipe states, and it turned out awesome.  I made two batches of popcorn in the airpopper and halved the ingredients.  Between myself and my wife it was gone the next day.

Perfect! I use one cup unpopped popcorn, divided into 3 poppings. Bake in a non-stick roasting pan. Makes clean up a breeze. Only change is to add 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar to the brown sugar/salt/etc mix. Don't know why, but my grandmother-in-law puts it in and her cooking is the best.

Awesome recipe.  I work 3 weekends a year cooking for this woman I know who does counseling for up to 8 women on the weekend in her home.  This was one of the items I made for the Saturday night party - and everone loved it!  Team members were sneaking into the kitchen to eat some before the party began!

Hmmmmm, let me see.  I want to make something for work for the holidays and so, as a sacrifice to my co-workers (no tears please), I made a batch yesterday to, hmmmmmm, just test it out.  I guess it's okay, because there isn't any left today!  We love this treat......Used the 3 bags of 'natural' micro-pop, and followed Brian's directions carefully.  Used the non-stick aluminum foil (great product), a large plastic container for stirring, and jelly-roll-cookie sheets for baking (baked the hour & stirred every 15 minutes..  Came out PERFECT!

This popcorn is awesome.I used honey instead of corn syrup and it was incredible. I layed it out on the counter on wax paper after baking. Can't stop eating it!

WOW!!! This is awesome. One nice thing...it DOES NOT stick to your teeth. Just a little advice. Two bags of microwave popcorn worked perfect (get unpopped kernels out). I did 3 ten minute shifts for a total of 30 minutes. Use a REALLY big bowl for mixing and pour in caramel in thirds and mix between pours. And lastly...if you don't have the non-stick foil, stop now and run to the store...it is SO helpful...

Awesome!!  Made this for part of a gift.  I used 3 bags microwave corn (after I fished out the cernels) and put in the biggest aluminum pan I could find sprayed with Pam.  I also added about a cup of mixed nuts.  NO MESS!!  So easy and turned out fabulous.

I made several batches of this for Christmas last year.  It's so easy, so good, and people rave over it.  It's one of those recipes that seems like you spent hours on it, but it is probably one of the most effortless recipes I have ever made.  For the 5 quarts of popcorn, I popped 2 unbuttered, unsalted popcorn packets in the microwave.

The final result was great...kids loved it, BUT...check the wattage of your mircowave if you're going to cook it that way, as mentioned in a previous review.  My microwave is 1200w & the suggested 30-40 sec x 4 burned the first batch.  (Not a nice experience...it really stinks!)  Second batch I cooked for 20 seconds x 4 & it was heaps better...it went like a flash

I have looked for a long time for a good caramel corn recipe.  This one is the best I have tried.  It has the perfect crunch without drying out.

This doesn't taste anything like the stuff you get in the big tins at Christmas - it's a million times better.  This is quite addictive!  My husband, who doesn't even like caramel popcorn, can't stay out of it.  I added cashew halves and may try almonds next time.  It has a wonderful flavor and tastes even better than the Crunch 'N Munch from the store.  I baked mine the full hour (I don't care for it very chewy), turned the oven off and left my pans in there for another 10 minutes.  It came out absolutely perfect. Thanks, Brian for the recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

This a perfect Fall snack.....delicious paired with some apple cider.  I added two cups of walnut pieces/halves to the popcorn before mixing in the caramel mixture, and it was a wonderful tasting blend of flavors and texture.

Not quite sure what went wrong, but, caramel coating on popcorn burnt. Was okay after 1st two stirrings, should have stopped baking at that point. Oven temperature might be off, tasted very good after 1/2 hour, though.

This was a big hit with the whole family and was gone very quickly.  Even the kids loved it.  I gave a bag of it to a friend and she called me later to ask me where I had bought it so she could go out and get some.  Very good and I'm going to make this one again soon!

I made this for Xmas and it was a big hit - everyone said it was better than cracker jack.  I added in some peanuts too.  This is an easy recipe but it was kind of a pain to have to stir it every 15 mins within the 1 hour baking timeframe.  It is also very important to make sure the pan that you use is greased very well b/c after the popcorn cools off, it gets very sticky and it's hard to break it up if most of it is stuck to the pan. However, it was easy and I plan on making this again in the near future!

I was a little taken aback by the amount of time needed to bake this, but it was worth it!  This is the BEST caramel popcorn recipe I've ever made. The more I baked it, the better it tasted. I will definitely make this again and again. A real family hit!

This recipe is amazing! I made it to give as gifts for Christmas ... super easy and inexpensive, and everyone loved it. I made it a few times, tweaking it a bit every time and here's how I liked it best. Always at least double the recipe ... it will go fast! I nearly doubled the amount of popcorn I used, I don't like each kernel to be completely covered, a light coating is perfect. I halved the butter and it turned out just fine with plenty of buttery taste. To mix the popcorn and caramel, I used a huge stock pot coated with crisco (to keep it from sticking) and then poured into the baking dishes before putting in the oven.  Once out of the oven, turn the popcorn out onto wax paper to cool. Once cool, drizzle with dark and white chocolate. Enjoy! I'll never have to try another caramel popcorn recipe again!

I absolutely love this corn!! I doubled the reicpe since I knew it was going to be a hit. I used the tip of keeping the popcorn warm since it helps with not setting up the caramel until fully mixed. Definitley butter the sheet pan or bowl before mixing the corn and caramel on it, or even putting the popcorn on it if using a bowl to mix. It will help when stirring later since the caramel won't stick to the pan. I suggest using two people to mix since time is of the essence. I do like the buttery flavor of using the full cup. When it came time to measure my Karo syrup, I substituted 1/4 of it with maple syrup. It adds a nice depth. This is my first review. I know it's kind of out of order for a recipe, but I hope it helps everyone.

This recipe is perfect as listed! Delicious, sweet and buttery but not too rich. I use 3 bags of microwave Orville Redenbacher plain popcorn. I bought a huge, deep aluminum disposable pan (the biggest one they have for catering chafing dishes) and pour the popcorn on one side and pick out all the unpopped or half popped kernels as they hurt and do so with each bag of popcorn. Then I follow the recipe as directed- I could not imagine trying to stir on 2 cookie sheets. Everything cleans up well and I store the pan in my pantry. Easy, simple and lasts several days in an airtight container or Ziplock bag with the air removed. Everyone raves over it!

Sooo good!! Used half the butter. Combined both dark and light corn syrup because recipe did not specify. Loved how adding the baking soda made the caramel foam and double in volume making it easy to combine. Followed someone else's review and kept the popcorn warm in the 250 oven before adding caramel. Easy and delicious!!!

Well, I was silly enough to think that we'd still have enough popcorn even if I halved the recipe, since it's just me and my husband. We ate all of it in just one day! Needless to say, we will never be buying store-bought caramel popcorn again. Make sure the pot you are using is big enough for the caramel sauce, as it will nearly double in size as it is boiling for the 4 minutes. Don't be worried about getting all the popcorn pieces coated all at once, because the caramel will melt and distribute over the pieces during baking/stirring. I baked mine for 45 minutes as per previous reviews and the popcorn was perfectly crunchy. I also added peanuts, but I'm curious to find out if there is a good way to make the peanuts stick to the popcorn.

DELICIOUS! My husband took this Caramel Popcorn to his office and boy was it a hit! He came home with an empty bowl - one coworker dumped the crumbs into a cup and told him that he couldn't waste any of it, it was just too good. 
I followed some of the suggestions and kept the popcorn warm in the oven while I made the caramel. It spread so evenly. Also, my initial plan was to bake it for 45 minutes as one reviewer recommended but when I pulled it out of the oven, it was too chewy for our liking so I put it back in for an additional 15 minutes and it was just right! I will definitely be making this again and soon!

Delicious!  My daughter and I ate almost the whole batch by ourselves in 1 day!  I forgot to get the unpopped kernels out before I added the caramel sauce.  It would've been much more enjoyable to eat had I done that.  I also only used 1 stick of butter and only baked for 30 minutes.

I took the advice of others and cut the butter by half.  Additionally, I only left the popcorn in the oven for 30 mins...next time will keep it in for less, more like 15-20.  Not sure if it's the higher altitude (6200) or the arid climate...or a combination of both, but an hour and a half would have been WAY too long.  

In short though, very good recipe.  Great flavor and super simple.  Made this for the first time while getting dinner together.  Fantastic!

I've made this several times and it is INCREDIBLE. The only thing I would recommend is to make sure to use stick butter, not spreadable. The spreadable butter made it taste weird.

I air popped 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and used one stick of light butter rather than two.  I hope it reduced the calories by half.....because I ate double my share ;)

I actually made this recipe last year for Christmas - but kept making it over and over again.  It was a big hit and once again is Gluten Free.  I also add salted peanuts and it tastes out of this world!  Am heading to Costco right now to get the stuff in bulk :)

EXCELLENT. Here are the changes I made, trying to make it more healthy lol.   1. Only 1/2 cup butter 2. 1/2 cup agave nectar instead of corn syrup  The key: every time I took it out of the oven to stir, I shook some salt on it. Really made a wonderful difference.   Though, I'm sure this recipe tastes fabulous as is!

Fantastic, easy recipe. I only baked it 30 minutes and that was enough to dry it out. I adjusted the recipe for 2 quarts for a little snack and it was plenty for 3 people to munch on. I didn't bake it in a pyrex, instead I baked it on a sheet pan with a silpat. I also buttered my bowl for mixing. After I pour the caramel out I fill the saucepan with water and put it back on the burner for a while. The hot water will dissolve the sugar and make for an easy clean up. I also dip my spoons in there to clean and pour the hot water over the remaining dirty dishes in the sink. Some things to add in would be salted peanuts and pretzles.

This recipe is incredible.  I don't know how people can give any bad reviews, especially when most of the time they don't even follow the recipe. They just make it up as they go along and it turns out bad, then blame the original recipe.   My suggestion is to keep the popcorn warm in the oven while making the caramel, it mixes up easier and the caramel won't harden so quickly. When boiling the caramel make sure to time it for four minutes starting as soon as it starts to bubble or it will be over cooked. Make sure to take it off the heat before adding in the vanilla and baking soda.  In some ovens 1 hour is too long and you end up with a bitter burnt sugar taste.  30 min is good in my oven. It comes out crunchy and delicious.

This is my go to recipe for caramel popcorn.  I use 2 bags of microwave popcorn and we just let it cool and eat it, don't bake it.  YUM.  Definitely agree with another reviewer, buy double the ingredients, you'll be making it more than once!  :)

Terrific!  I cut the butter back to 3/4 cups and it still tasted awesome.  These would be great gifts in tins or cellophene wrapping with a pretty bow.

This is the best!  Super-easy following the directions exactly.  I used 1 cup unpopped kernels on the stove to make the popcorn.  My only advice is during baking:  when you stir, make sure you are stirring up all of the caramel on the bottom of the pan, I think it tends to burn a little if you don't.  I'll try adding peanuts next time.

I made this recipe exactly as directed a jillion times in the last two weeks.  It was awesome every time!  Easy to follow and tastes great.  I did use margarine instead of butter without any problems.  I also used 1/2 cup of unpopped corn in my air popper and found the candy coated it well without making a mess.  I tossed in 1/2 cup of chopped raw pecans before baking to make it special.  After baking and cooling, I drizzled with white and dark chocolate to make it special for gift giving.  Tasted awesome!  Thanks Brian for the recipe!

This is great stuff and very easy. I made a batch a couple weeks ago and everyone at work loved it and asked for the recipe. I used popcorn popped on my stovetop. I used half the butter and baked it a little less than an hour. I baked mine in my roaster pan covered in aluminum foil for easy clean up.

Unbelievable!  This is delicious and easy to make.  I was always kind of intimidated by the thought of making caramel corn.  It seemed way too hard, but it's not at all with this recipe. I read that some people used microwave popcorn, I used air-popped and it turned out awesome. My only advice is to spray everything with non-stick spray, especially the pan you boil everything in, if you don't it is going to be so hard to clean.
**Don't forget the salt, I forgot it in one batch and it makes a huge difference**

I made this yesterday for "Thanksgiving at the Pub" and the entire batch was gone.  I found it a bit difficult to stir and coat in the bowl, but once in the oven had no problems.  I didn't change a thing but next time might add some cashews.  Very addicting!
Update - I've made this several times.  This last time, I poured the caramel over the popcorn in a brown paper grocery bag and shook!  Much easier than attempting to stir in a bowl.  Still one of our faves!

This is soooooo good ! We made it for Halloween , and had to make several more batches because we couldnt quit eating it. Adults and kids love this , like my son said its pure heaven :) and very addictive. We used pecan halves and added them to the sauce right before pouring it over , and the next time we used pecans and peanuts . Its really good either way . I also tried a batch with light butter , and it turned out very good but it wasnt as thick and chewy and had more of a  sugar texture like you would find in the kind you buy. You cannot find a better recipe, than this one. I would give this 10 stars **********    :)

This caramel popcorn is wonderful!  I've made so many batches and they always turn out perfectly!  I think keeping the corn in a warm oven while you make the syrup is key to getting it to stir up nicely.  I also use a huge disposable turkey roaster that washes up nicely after soaking for just a bit in hot water!  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is great! I've made it twice in a week and gave half to my parents and kept the other half for my husband and I and it hasn't lasted more than two days in either house! I followed some other reviewer's advice and cut the butter amount in half. I also kept the tempature at 200 and baked it for an hour, stiring it every 15 mins. It is a little difficult to get the brown sugar mixture to spread over the popcorn evenly, but be patient, it's totally worth it. The popcorn breaks apart very easily after baking it. Easy clean up too... I used a disposable tin turkey pan and it worked well.

Go with two bags of popcorn and add nuts. I made with three and it was too dry for my taste.  I took to a 4th of July party and the kids ate it up!!  Definitely mix in paper bag and bake in a foil pan.It is delicious!!

Fantastic!  Finally found a recipe that's as good as my husband's great aunt's caramel corn.  Now we won't have to wait for her to make it at the holidays!  I split the recipe in half so we wouldn't overeat, but also to make the volume more manageable when mixing.

This was the best caramel popcorn I have ever tasted - even better than the expensive gourmet popcorn. I simply followed the directions, except that I only baked it 45 minutes. Clean up was simple: I used 17" long jelly roll pans and lined them with parchment paper. The caramel did not stick at all when I went to turn it, and at the end, I just crumpled up the parchment and threw it out. I will be making this a lot, but as the other raters warned, it's addictive! I think I'm also going to try coating it using a paper bag instead of using two bowls.

Delicious. Added this to my Xmas hamper contents this year. I used air popped plain popcorn and cut the ingredients in half.  Lined the detachable wide base in my oven with wax paper and baked at 115 degree for 15 minutes. Remember to remove the unpopped kernals. Stir every 10 minutes to get the corns evenly coated.

This is a recipe I've made for years, usually at Christmas time.  I use my hot air popcorn maker and put the popcorn into a large roasting pan that's been sprayed with Pam....beats putting the popcorn onto cookie sheets, plus it's much easier to stir.  Bake for 30 - 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.

This was terrific and very tasty.  

It made plenty. 

I used 1 cup of unpopped popcorn.  When popped it was the perfect amount.  

The only difference was I used 2 large cookie sheets, sprayed with Mazola Spray. 

Placed the popcorn on the cookie sheets, poured the sauce and mixed together.  

Then followed the directions by stirring every 15 minutes for the hour.

This is awesome carmel popcorn!!! However it takes a long time to make, but it's well worth it.  I tried adding chocolate chips to one of the two pans of popcorn, I wouldn't recommend it.  Otherwise, it's delicious!!!

Excellent! I wish I had made this prior to reading the last few reviews--do NOT dump your bag of popcorn into your mixing vessel, or you will have lots of unpopped kernels--a VERY bad thing. I used 50% dark/50% light brown sugar and a low butter popcorn (2 bags was just right). The prior suggestion of using tongs is a great one! I mixed in a paper grocery bag and baked on foil-lined & sprayed cookie sheets, so clean-up was minimal. I will however, not cook it as long next time (maybe only 30 mins @ 200). In the latter part of cooking, the caramel started to melt off the popcorn. The pooling made the final product less attractive.

Oh my God! This recipe is amazing! Tastes just like store bought caramel popcorn. I usually half the recipe and keep the boiling time at 4 min. Stir a few times after removing from the oven so that popcorn doesn't stick together too much. You can use food coloring to make colorful popcorn too!

We really liked this, it was devoured very quickly. This was my first time making carmel corn, and I was very pleased with the result, following the recipe exactly the popcorn was very crisp,  lower the cooking time if you like a softer caramel corn, thanks for the great recipe, we will be making this again soon.

i have made this countless times and it is soooo great! the only problem i have is that the caramel mixture is very thick and sticky so trying to pour a thin stream is impossible and not all the popcorn gets coated. Im not sure why this happens and any feed back as to a solution would be great as this recipe is divine!!

This was the best carmel corn i have ever tasted. Our family made this for Christmas as gifts for our neighbors and friends. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! Make sure to use regular brown sugar insted of light brown sugar, you can really taste a differance. I also tried this recipe with nuts, very tasty. Be ready to make more of this, this has become a family favorite in my house!

I burnt this :(  but the stuff that did not burn was great!  I cooked it on aluminum foil which may have caused the burning, next time I will use parchment paper.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

This carmel popcorn is a HIT! I served it at a party, one person that claims up and down he "hates" popcorn, loved it! I also made it for my fall wedding, we put it in fall patterned "goodie bags" as favors. My one comment is to make sure you use shallow enough pans when baking so you cook evenly, and to be careful using Caphlon. I used 2 "lasagna" sized pans, one a cheapy kind, and one my caphlon, and the caphlon pan BURNED the carmel on the bottom of the pan and i could not stir in the burned carmel at the bottom as it would all taste burnt.  VERY GOOD, a little messy to make, i always end up with carmel corn stuck to my socks after making this in my kitchen (kind of hard to stir "cleanly", some usually ends up on my floor!).

It's probably a good thing this takes an hour and a half.  This is so much better than the caramel popcorn in the can at Christmas.

Made this to give away for gifts.  Very easy to make, but be sure not to get the "caramel" on any part of your body.  Will make this again next year.

I have made this wonderful recipe 3 times!  It worked just as great when I dumped everything in right after the butter and sugar melted too!  It is great with extra add-ins like white or peanut butter chips too.

Okay, first off, USE A CANDY THERMOMETER! Be careful not to have your heat too high, and slowly bring to hard crack stage (300 deg F). If you use a 6 qt or so TEFLON stock pot, you will have plenty of room for the sugar sauce, once it expands from the soda, and it won't stick. Have your popcorn (1c unpopped) ready in a large roasting pan that you have sprayed with Pam, and as soon as your sugar is ready, pour over your corn and stir with a Teflon spatula or spoonula. Transfer to a disposable aluminum roasting pan; I lined mine with parchment to make stirring easier. Temperature and time are accurate.
I had no problems with burning or sticking at any point, mine came out pleasantly crispy but not hard. Only 4 stars, because no candy thermometer temp provided.

I have been making this recipe for about 40 years.  I got it from a 'farm cookbook'.  If you are tired of picking hulls out of your teeth, try making it with OkeDoke popcorn puffs from the grocery snack isle.  It is wonderful.  NO hulls!  Also, I find that if I put the puffs in the oven BEFORE I start the syrup, it makes it easier to coat the popcorn/puffs if they are hot.  I pour it right out onto my clean countertop as soon as it comes out of the oven and it is easier to break up. Every year I use it for gifts for many and they all look forward to it.  I made 2 batches yesterday and guess I will be making at least 2 more.  I always get requests for the recipe.  You do need to get it in a container soon after it is cooled or it will get sticky if it is in the open for very long.  We love it in Michigan! I used to use margarine but some companies have changed their formula so now I use strictly BUTTER!  After all, its the holidays and we treat ourselves with things we don't normally have.

Fantastic and very easy recipe.  I use two large bowls for stirring the popcorn.  Be sure to cook the caramel on a medium heat or it will burn.  I have made this recipe 5 times in two months, I have sent three batches with my husband to work (at a ski resort, in the vehicle maintenance shop), it is gone in less than an hour.  
This recipe also makes a good caramel sauce for ice cream or deserts, just cook for 2 minutes, not 4 minutes.
Thank you for this recipe!

Delicious recipe. However cookinig times may vary. I have a gas oven and after an attempt at my first batch it burned after only 30 minutes. I tried again and reduced the oven to 200 and cooking time to 45 minutes still stirring as directed and it came out perectly! Thanks for the recipe, I am gifting this to friends and family this year and many more to come!

I like to make recipes as they are stated to give it a chance.  This one is perfect as it is.  But I did add 1 cup of dry roasted peanuts.  So yummy!  The best i've tried.

Fantastic recipe. I also made a butter toffee recipe by substituting 2tsp of almond extract for the 1tsp vanilla extract. Also added 2 cups of whole salted almonds before adding the caramel. Great variation, but the original recipe is wonderful.

I'm not sure what I have done wrong. I found this recipe time consuming and not fun. It was very messy and found the end product just didn't taste good. I followed all of the suggestions:less butter, warm popcorn, and everything in between, and I was not impressed.

I followed the recipe instructions to a T - with no modifications.  The results were exceptional.  The popcorn was so buttery, crunchy, and light that it melted in my mouth.  This recipe was a little messy to make, even with careful hands and a VERY large bowl, but water dissolves caramel, so my dishes cleaned right up with minimal elbow grease.  Elsewhere, the caramel hardened and was easy to "break off" of surfaces like the stove and countertops.

This Caramel Popcorn turned out perfectly. People couldn't believe that I made it from scratch.

I made this and followed recipe to a "T"...came out great!  I did not use it on popcorn though, I used it by pouring it over the top layer of a sponge cake I made..came out perfect and everyone LOVED it!

Awesome!  I make this all the time now. It is so easy.  I typically make about 7-8 servings of the carmel for an entire popped bag of pop corn and it turns out great just to adjust the serving size.

I tried this recipe a few times. The first time I took the suggestions for half the butter and mixed it in a paper bag and did not put it in the oven. Turned out great!!! The second time I did use the oven and it turned out even better. It made a big difference in texture and hardness. Now I hate this recipe...easy, but gone in 2 days or sooner by my husband alone (except for the pieces I sneak to 'test' while in the oven). :-)

This is SOOOOOO good. I developed a peanut allergy as an adult, but loved caramel popcorn as a kid...I wish I had known about this years ago! So simple and perfect for Parents and Children to make together!! I even added cheddar popcorn seasoning to it.... to TRY and imitate some famous popcorn eateries...TASTES EVEN BETTER!!!!!!!! Happy with this sweet success.

Was o.k not enough caramel to coat the popcorn properly, when baked in the oven makes the caramel hard like dry sugary fudge .  Tried this recipe twice to give it a fair try,  threw most of it in the garbage kids not impressed.  Too much work not worth the money in ingredients.

This is wonderful!! My kids beg me to make this-- it is truly an unforgettable taste and experience. Very, very easy to make, and it tastes wonderful! After I'm done making it, I put it on the kitchen table on some Pam sprayed wax paper, and my 4 elementary-aged children swirl around the table and  attack this Caramel Popcorn until gone. Recommend!

Yum! Really loved the way this turned out, and clean up was not that bad. A few words of advice that I gathered:
1. I used just 1/2 cup butter. (all I had) It wasn't greasy, and still made enough caramel to coat popcorn. If you want them super coated, you may need to adjust your caramel:popcorn ratio.
2. I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn (no butter)
3. Remove unpopped kernals before coating. Put in bowl 1, shake a little, and move to bowl 2. Kernals will remain in bowl 1. 
4. I don't have a turkey roaster, so I just lined my largest cookie sheet with two strips of aluminium foil, with a slight overlap down the center. The excess over the sides make it very easy to stir all of the popcorn during the baking cycle. (foil cools instantly when pulled out of the oven, making it easy to handle.)

So good.  I only had to bake for 25 min. The popcorn seemed evenly coated after 25 min...pulled it out...let it sit for 5 min and it was crunch and ready to go. I airpopped my popcorn.

1 Whirly popper full of popcorn and did the 1 stick butter and microwave in paper bag method...it was the best!  I have tried to make caramel corn in the past, only to be disappointed (probably technique) this was almost fool proof and fast in microwave method.

This was just ok for me.  It was alot of work and I LOVE working in the kitchen, but the end result was worth all the fuss.  BTW, you must work FAST when pouring the syrup onto the popcorn. It hardens fast.

I've made this twice this week and everyone loves it.  The first time I made it I left the popcorn in the oven for the full hour as recommended.  It was a little crispy for us, so the second time I took it out after about 45 mins...  PERFECT!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Love it. I recommend using mushroom popcorn and if you add salted peanuts to cut down on the amount of salt you add.

I made this for a Christmas gathering and my family couldn't get enough of it.  I am not even a huge fan of caramel corn (I prefer salty and buttery to sweet popcorn), but this stuff is so addicting! Thank you so much for the recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for the holidays and everyone loved it!  I popped the popcorn over the stove rather than used microwave popcorn.  Popped corn was better than microwaved.  Also as another user suggested, I doubled the sauce.  It was great!  Made another batch and forgot the baking soda.  BIG mistake. The syrup was gooey and did stick to my teeth as another user stated.  I added slivered almonds for variation, white chocolate chips, whatever you feel like!   Will definitely make again!

I decreased butter to 3/4 stick.  I was originally thinking it was one stick butter, but 1 cup butter is 2 sticks.  It however still turned out great with the butter decrease.  Also used 2 bags Orville natural white microwave popcorn and it was a perfect amount.  Baked 45 min, stirring after every 15 min. interval.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is so yummy!  I halve the recipe and use 1 bag of popped corn but only 1/4 of the required butter.  It is perfect every time.  Once I added chopped pecans to the caramel just before pouring it onto the popcorn, AMAZING!

Very good; doesn't even require baking (if you want a chewier texture).  Great right out of the freezer, too, where I hide it to keep us from eating it all at once!)

I skip the baking, add crunched up heath bars (or candy of your choice) and form the mixture into balls.  It's heavenly.  :)

This was so  great and a lot easier than I thought it would be.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the butter by half.  It tasted just fine that way, so why not save the calories?  I baked for the full hour and it was just right:  not sticky but not overdone.  I highly recommend this.  It was my first time making caramel corn and I'll definitely be making it again, maybe with some pecans added.

Here's a bit of a healthier option. I don't like corn syrup, so I used honey instead, and it worked perfectly. I also cut the butter and lost no flavour. Delicious!

Here's a couple things I wish others had told me before making this recipe! 1) The sugar - the darker it is the more it burns. 2) I thought I had too much popcorn & too little coating but when you add the baking soda it doubles like crazy... I ended up having too much coating & not enough popcorn! Keep this in mind. 3) Try not to use dark roasting pans as they burn the sugar faster. I had 2 batches & the darker pan almost burnt my popcorn.  All in all, good recipe. Will be making it again :) Thanks to other viewers for their hints.

WOW!! This is the best caramel corn that I have ever tasted. The flavor was buttery and sweet and the texture was at first a light crisp but ended up melting in your mouth! I followed the advice to put the popcorn in the oven for a little bit before adding the caramel.

I was told this should be one of my new "staples".  Real easy if you follow the directions.  I also took the advise of others and while I was making the caramel, I let the popcorn sit in the oven in the tray to keep warms and it coated so easy!  This was delicious!

I made this this afternoon for when the kids got home. I had some kettle corn that didn't have much flavor and used that. I added a 1/2 jar of roasted peanuts I had and was it goood!! I did not bake it the whole time, I was afraid I was afraid I was going to burn it and it only spent about 30 mins baking.I actually cut this recipe in half. It was perfect and soo easy to make. Thank You Monika. Keeper:)

I have been making this exact recipe for over 25 years.  My friends and family look forward to it every holiday season.  Another tip....air popped corn works excellent!  The popcorn is so light and fluffy.  Those air poppers aren't good for much else, but they sure make good caramel corn.

Phenomenal. Always a huge hit! Probably one of the most complimented recipes I make. I tend to use a few more cups of popped popcorn, so it thins out the coating a little bit (and stretches it further, so there is more to eat). Also, I use a wooden spoon to mix. For cleanup-I just let everything soak in water and dissolve until a simple wipedown is all that's needed. No need to struggle and scrub.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and everyone loves it!  My husband is diabetic so I have made some minor changes to the recipe.  I use Smart Balance butter, Splenda brown sugar (use 1/2 about requested), and Lite corn syrup.  I have been asked several times for this recipe because the popcorn is soooo good and because it has less sugar than any other recipe!!

GREAT!!!!
easy to make. pretty much fool proof. someone recommended cutting the butter in half and i did. it wasn't greasy, it wasn't overly sweet. it was just right. the only other changes i made was i didn't use salt (i never use salt in anything) and i used honey instead of corn syrup (they're interchangeable).

What can I say but YUMMO. The only thing is make sure you take any hard kernels that may have fell in the bowl before adding the mix. Biting down on them is not fun. Great recipe! Thanks.

This is wonderful!  Everyone who tries it, loves it.  I put the whole recipe in a foil roasting pan to bake, then threw the pan away to save on clean up time.

Wow!  This is so good and so addicting!!!  I only used 1 stick of butter and 3 bags of Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop butter microwave popcorn and omitted the salt.  I mixed it together in a brown paper bag as suggested by others which made for super easy clean up.  It all fit in my turkey roaster that I lined with foil and coated with cooking spray.  I baked in the oven for an hour at 200.  Next time I might try adding nuts but it is just so good as is, I don't know if I want to mess with it:)

I really enjoyed this popcorn but am giving it 4 stars because it called for too many cups of popcorn. The taste however does rate 5 stars!!!  I used 14 cups of popcorn instead of 20 cups. It covered it better (like store bought) and of course like the others I kept the popcorn warm in the oven before adding the syrup. I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the popcorn. I did a comparsion with the neighbors...1st like printed and 2nd the reduction of popcorn and overwhelmingly the second rated the best!!

I'm just reiterating what everyone else is saying.  This stuff is fabulous.  There should be a warning on the recipe saying how addictive it is.  I only used a 1/2 cup of butter.  I have nothing to compare it to, but it tasted great to me.

Wow This recipe is fantstic.  I have made it over 10 times.  EVERYONE LOVES IT.  The only warning is to be sure and cook the carmal topping for four minutes exactly or it will burn very easy and distroy the end product.  Thanks for the recipe!

I reduced the amount of butter to 3/4 cup because I used Orville Redenbacher's Movie Theater Butter for the popcorn, which is already loaded with butter.  This recipe tastes especially good before it completely dries out.  I prepared this recipe while we handed out candy on Halloween night.  It was a much better treat than all those little candy bars!

Awesome recipe.  I used my old large oval turkey roaster.  I took about 1 tablespoon of the butter and melted it in the roaster in the oven and added about 1 1/2 cups pecan halves and toasted them while the carmel was cooking.  I added the still warm microwave popcorn and stirred in the sauce.  After removing from the oven and cooling it for a few minutes I threw in some candy corn for a festive touch.  Everyone at our trick or treat gathering requested take home bags to eat more later.

As soon as the weather starts to turn in the Fall I start thinking about this recipe!  You need a REALLY BIG bowl to hold this much popcorn so definitely follow the advice of the reviewer who suggested using a turkey roasting pan. Once the popcorn is coated you can transfer to baking pans or just bake it right in the roasting pan.  This worked really well for me.  Watch it closely towards the end of the cooking time because you may want to pull it out before the full hour unless you want it very crunchy.  There's no substitute for homemade caramel corn.  Great Halloween snack.

i like my caramel corn  soft (as opposed to crunchy) so i didn't bake it at all... just poured the sauce over the popcorn, waited 10 min for it to soak in, and voila!  divine :)  oh... also substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup as didn't have any on hand.  was not a problem, perhaps even enhanced the flavour a bit more.

This recipe is awesome. My family likes caramel popcorn to be a little sticky, so I don't even bother with the oven at all. It comes right off fingers thanks to all the butter, so clean-up is easy :) Thanks you so much for a wonderful recipe. We use it at least once a month!

WOW!!  I made this yesterday and it is as good as all the reviews say!  I read through quite a few of them to get some tips.  I popped my popcorn on the stove, and I kept it warm in the oven(that was the best tip of all, it make the caramel spread out much easier).  I used a large aluminum rectangle roasting pan sprayed with Pam.  When it was cooling I gently shook the pan a few times until it was completely cooled.  I am going to use this for my son's class' halloween treats for school this year.  I am also going to make up Christmas tins for my family and friends.  Nest time I am going to try using half the buter to see if there is a difference.  Thanks for the great recipe that I will be using for years to come!!

I popped the popcorn the old fashioned way on the stove in my 5qt dutch oven. It was the perfect amount. I buttered a huge stainless steel bowl that I use for baking and put the popcorn in it in the oven while I made the syrup. I only had about 1/2 of the amount of corn syrup so I added pancake syrup to it per another review and the results were still delicius! We took some on a camping trip and it was gone in 10 min! I will definately make this again. I like it best with only 1/2 cup butter, also

Great recipe! This works great with 2 bags microwave popcorn. Hints for easier clean up: foil wrap the two pans and spray with Pam. Pour the popcorn directly into the pans, pour half the sauce over each and mix right in the baking pan. Wash the sauce pan IMMEDIATELY before the caramel hardens. Oh so good!

This recipe is similar to Betty Crocker's which I have been making for years....sometimes after I take the caramel corn out of the oven, I sprinkle on a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips, let them sit for about 5 minutes on the hot caramel corn then stir to melt. Yes, it makes a mess of the pan, but yummy CHOCOLATE COVERED CARAMEL CORN!

Very good recipe.  I only baked this for 30-40 minutes and It turned out great.  It stuck to the pan though so next time I will grease it.

This recipes was so easy to make and so delicious. I didn't read the reviews until I was finished and realized that I should have used some pam and lined my pans with foil, will definetly do that next time.

I made this popcorn for the Superbowl and it was the first thing to go.  Now my 4 year old asks me to make it all the time.  It was super easy.  I popped the popcorn in brown paper lunch bags, folded at the top in the microwave for 2 minutes each.  Three bags did the trick.

I've been making this caramel popcorn for at least twenty years and everyone I know loves it.  The only difference is that my recipe calls for one cup of pecan halves and one cup of coconut.  I made three or four batches of this for the holidays and it's worth every minute!!!  Yummmmmmm

Oh my! This is the best!  I was short on popcorn, so I added about 1 1/2 cups of cashews.  One reviewer didn't bake hers and she is right that it is very tasty without baking.  But by baking and stirring every 15 minutes, this allows you to distribute the carmel better, and it just gives it a finishing taste and crunch.  I recommend the baking.

A very simple recipe with fantastic results - the best carmel corn I have had. I used cooking spray in two large roasting pans - clean up was very easy. I added pecans and salted almonds - I will make this again - my family loved it.

This was an excellent recipe.  I had been making one caramel corn recipe from a friend but it never got as crunchy as I like it, maybe because it had cream of tartar - who knows.

Anyway - this was great.  The only modification that I added was to use a bit more salt.  I couldn't taste any salt when it was done so I sprinkled a little over it all.

A good idea that I came up with was to open a paper grocery bag and lay it on my counter.  I took the warm caramel corn and spread it out on the bag and used a spatula on it's side to break up all the pieces.

Thanks Brian.

WONDERFUL!!!! This popcorn was and still is a hit with my family, I used the fat free popcorn and I can't belive it's not butter for less fat and I also used a wooden spoon in a non stick sauce pan to help dissolve the sugar, parchment paper over my cookie sheets made out great for no messes..Thanks,Brian

Fabulous and extremely easy!  I prefer my caramel corn to be extra coated with buttery caramel and found that this recipe is perfect for exactly 2 standard bags of micro popcorn.  I end up coating one bag at a time with this recipe and it comes out perfect! ***TIP: use TONGS to toss and cost the popcorn while baking in the oven. After the 45 min in the oven, I spread out the caramel corn on a cookie sheet to cool and allows the caramel to harden just a bit.  Thanks Brian...it's true - this tastes just like Chicago's famous Garett's popcorn found downtown!  :)

This stuff turned out delicious, but I had a heck of a time cleaning up after making a batch.  I had to let everything soak in hot water so I could scrub the caramel off.  I used pre-popped popcorn like another reviewer and it turned out great.  I would make this again despite the mess it caused.

I took this treat on a camping trip and told my family that they can have the leftover popcorn.  But the whole batch didn't even make it past the first night on the trip.  It was a definite hit!

I first received this recipe as a christmas gift from the ladies in my church.  It is fabulous every single time.  I prefer mine pretty chewy though so I don't bake in the oven at all after making it.  My co-workers raved when I brought it in as a treat, still warm! YUMMY... definately a recipe I recommend making.  You can make it even better if you add some peanuts or almonds!!

I hate to be a spoil sport, but I really was not impressed with this recipe; I was looking for soft caramel corn.  The header said to cook for less time if you wanted chewy corn, so I did.  Didn't turn out.   If you like hard CC, then this is the recipe for you!

Oh... My... GOSH!!!!!! I just made it because I was bored, and my stepdaughter has a friend over. I'm not a big fan of Carmel Corn, but this is absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!!!! It mels in your mouth, and is SO yummy! I was concerned when my mixture after boiling looked weird, it was really thick and kinda gross, but I poured it on and stirred (hand cramped LOL!) and it just finished and is SO FABULOUS! MUCH better than any carmel corn I have ever had, and I will definitely be making this for Christmas presents!

This recipe was ridiculous. I have never made caramel popcorn before and this recipe was easy enough to follow. I followed the suggestions of some other viewers and mixed the caramel with warm popcorn. I also threw  some pecans in there. Needless to say I can't stop eating this stuff and will now be sending a bag full of it in with my husband to his work. Too good!

I was looking for a caramel popcorn recipe before Christmas to try out. This recipe was a lucky find! I followed the recipe as written and thought it turned out great. As written it does have a heavy butter flavor, but I liked that. I then cut the butter in half like several reviewers mentioned and it still turned out great. In fact I made a few batches over the holidays and gave it out as gifts. You do need the full hour in the oven as the stirring helps obtain even coating and it sets very crunchy and not chewy/sticky.

It's been a hit every single time I've made it. Lots of great tips here but what I find is a good tip is while it's cooling, keep tossing it every so often so the popcorn dosent clump up across the bottom of the dish your cooling it in.

Used same amount popcorn but cut everything else in half and used pure maple syrup instead. Added whole almonds. Placed all of the batch into my broiler pan. Fit perfectly. I went by the recipe with instructions. I grew up on on the box with the surprise toy in the 1960's. This is it,perfect! yummy

AMAZING!! I cut the butter in half, and popped my own popcorn in an air popper (no oil). I did it in the oven, even though many people said to do microwave, and I'm glad I did. I thought about only doing half a batch since 20 cups of popcorn sounded like a ton! But if I had I would have ended up making it the next day-- it was almost gone! Will make for gifts too :)

Great recipe, didn't change a thing, except I lightly sprayed oil on the bottom of baking pan for less sticking and easier clean up

This was my first time to make caramel corn and it came out perfect and I didn't need to change anything! I did use my air popper for the popcorn which is much easier than cooking them on the stove!

So yummy!  I have never understood what the big deal about carmel popcorn was until I tasted this recipe.  I have also used this recipe to make popcorn balls with and they hold together nicely.  I sometimes add gummy worms for an extra treat for kids.

I am making this right now! I have been making this recipe for years and had no idea where it was from.  It is the biggest hit every Christmas when I make it.  My only other suggestion is to buy the big aluminum roasting pans from the grocery store (they are a few bucks) and use that to stir and bake your corn.  It is non stick and lots of room and so easy to clean!  Plus they are reusable I have been using the same 2 pans for years now! Also, make sure to use a larger sauce pan for the sauce as when you add the baking soda it will double in size, kinda fun actually ;-)  and yes pull out your old maids!  Enjoy! PS I also add salted peanuts to the mix yum!

made exactly as written.  Proportion of popcorn to coating was just right. A nice, dark rich crunchy popcorn.  Be very careful, I have a few blisters from the hot caramel

Everyone loved them, they were gone within 5 minutes!

Question for anyone that knows, popcorn stuck to the pan and was hard to get out. Any ideas?

This is soo addictive! I did change it a bit- I quartered the butter and the other quarter I used virgin coconut oil. While it was delicious, it  was hard to stir, and a lot of the sugared goodness was left in the baking pan- could be due to the lack of butter. BUT- my husband who doesn't eat popcorn ( I know!) couldn't stop dipping his hand in the bucket! A winner for sure- and I will try the coconut nectar next time as that sounded intriguing. Thank you for sharing- way better than any store bought for sure!

SO GOOD!!! And pretty easy... just a little time consuming. I cut the recipe WAY back b/c I didn't have room to make so much... but after I made it, it was gone in no time! I should have made more. I was also worried that there wasn't enough caramel as I stirred it, but it was JUST the right amount. Perfect.

Perfect just as.  My husband said he was "very impressed" and that it "was much better than he had thought it would be".  I will definately make this again.  So much better and cheaper than the kind you can buy.

This is Great, I did some of the things that were suggested, such as to cut the butter back, and I kept the popcorn warm, in a big roasting pan, it made the caramel so much easier to get coated on the warm popcorn, and clean up was a breeze, I will be making this again.

This will be a great snack for my husband  since we are testing for a gluten intolerance, caramel corn is allowed.

Halved the butter, as suggested.  Made the perfect amount for a scant 5 quarts of popcorn, but I can see how some might like more candy than popcorn and would want to double the syrup.  Totally addictive!  Cleanup was easy--any hardened sugar in the pans soaked right off in warm water fairly quickly.

Love this recipe, so easy and yummy. Using Linda's Idea about keeping the unpopped kernels out... and Renee's Idea about putting the caramel covered popcorn in grocery bags and putting them in the microwave for, I did 35 seconds, 4x each and it ALL came out great!  Thank you BS4U2C for your recipe.  My little special "Trick Or Treaters" will be SOOO HAPPY!

I have been making my own custom version of caramel popcorn for years and my wife never likes it.  I decided to spend the extra and try this version, and boy am I happy I did.  The popcorn was crispy and not sticky like mine usually came out.  And fortunately or UN-fortunately my wife loves it too.  She says it taste like cracker jacks, which has me planning to add peanuts next time to give it the true Cracker Jack Flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really good.  I followed the basic recipe.  But I added cinnamon to one portion of the popcorn.  I spinkled it on top before putting it in the oven.  I also think it would be great if you do the same with some kosher salt, I will try that next time for sweet and salty popcorn.

I never waited for caramel corn before; I always ate it warm and chewy---  made by someone else.  The anticipation was killer and I admit there was lots of melty, sweet nibbling. Other than lack of self-control, I sure would have liked a line that reminded me to clean out the duds, but hey, I can pretend they are really hard peanuts.  I think the "secret" has to do with when you stop stirring and when you take it off the burner. The mixing and waiting is tedious but I think the results (after cooling) were top notch. (except for the duds)

I'm giving it 5 stars but not the one I made, it was the one I had at my sons school graduation. It tasted sooooo good, I asked for the recipe and this is what she gave me. She used half the butter as did I, but mine came out kinda chrystalized and I don't think I had enough popcorn cause it was wayyyy too sweet, not the right ratio. What did I do wrong, could it have been the brand of brown sugar? It all looked great untill I baked it. Great recipe though if you can get it right!

Made this twice and everyone loved it! The second time I reduced the butter per other suggestions and I had trouble with it sticking to the pan. However, I also stirred it less that time. Either way, I'm sticking with the original amounts and never making it when I'm home alone because I would eat it all! Personally, I like it soft and chewy so cook it less.

Fantastic.  Everyone always wants me to bring this to Christmas parties.  The secret really is to keep the popcorn and pans warm so the caramel won't cool too fast and make it impossible to mix into the corn.  I use disposable metal pans so lots less cleanup. I made it once without the soda and vanilla and it was still great.

Wow! I blew my diet on this recipe! We had a big bag of Boy Scout Popcorn, and I was looking for some special way to fix it when I found this recipe. It is wonderful, delicious, and addicting. This would make a great and inexpensive bake sale item. Also, there are several ways to kick it up a notch, not that it needs it! The next time I make it, I may drizzle melted chocolate over it after it is done baking. Honey Roasted Peanuts would make a nice addition as well. My daughter suggested using melted peanut butter chips as a drizzle.                                                                I should mention that I was almost out of butter, so I used half butter and half light butter. Simply amazing!

I would give this recipe ten stars if I could. I agree with everyone.  This is fantastic.  I made my popcorn the old fashion way, in a pot , on the stove.  I have never made caramel corn and this was really easy.  I did keep popcorn warm as another review suggested.  It worked perfect.  I cooked mine for 45 min. and it was great!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  Made if for our yearly Oscar party and it was a hit.  I was nervous about making this, but followed the directions and it turned out great.  Easy and delicious.  Did as other reviews suggested and made sure the popcorn was warm before coating with the caramel.  
Can't wait to make again!

This is the best caramel corn recipe I have ever tasted!  My daughter loves it and she also enjoys making it with me. Tastes even better the next day when stored in an airtight container.

If you're looking for a great caramel popcorn recipe, use this one! We were a little suspicous that the caramel would stick to the popcorn, but it worked great. We love this recipe!

This recipe is the exact same as my family one minus the baking soda....I googled why one would need it and it states that it keeps it softer so it doesn:t dry rock hard or be so gooey it sticks to your teeth bad.  I made this recipe to a t and it turned out waaaay better than the one my family uses I even called up my aunt to tell her.  TIP after cooking time  place on parchment paper then you dont end up with clumps.

Fantastic.  Really easy and everyone that had it absolutely raved!  I even tried replacing the corn syrup with maple syrup - the texture was a bit weird but it was still really good!

Update:  If you want to make this recipe even more fantastic (and there are no nut allergies), add some pecan pieces, about 1 cup.  Seriously.

Wow wow WOW!! I wanted to make a Christmas treat and asked my aunt for my grandmas caramel popcorn recipe. She didn't come through and boy I am glad she didn't. This is great! And this is coming from someone who doesn't even like candy! I did as others suggested and only used 1/2cup unsalted butter and popped about 3/4cup popcorn kernals on the stove. I don't know if this is going to last until Christmas. Thank you so much!

Oh my god, YUM! This popcorn is beyond delicious and so, so easy to make. I used dark brown sugar and it turned out great, did not burn - it gave it a much deeper caramel flavour. I plan on making huge batches of this for Christmas! Thanks so much for the amazing recipe. UPDATE: I made this again with light brown sugar and I much, much prefer it with dark brown sugar - it has SO much more flavour!

I had very easy prep for this, I popped porcorn and measured and placed it into my large stainless extra deep lasagna/roasting pan which I had sprayed with non-stick spray.  Kept the popcorn warm in the oven as some had suggested.  Made the caramel mixture, poured and stirred to coat directly in the roasting pan.  Then baked as stated for one hour!  Surprisingly easy!  Clean up was super easy, just soaked the pot and pan for a few minutes!

This is an incredible recipe! This will be my 3rd year making it for Christmas with the family and they beg for it year round! Especially when we have a long road trip to visit family, everyone wants their own ziplock baggy-full! I also spray the pan (I use a turkey roasting pan) prior to placing the ingredients inside and mixing.  The only thing I add are cashews and I change nothing else! Magnificent! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe! I will have to try it now with half the butter....

i must say, following the cooking instructions is very important. once i finished (baking as well) it turned out soooooo delicious!!! i couldn't stop eating it. my kids wouldn't leave the table until they were able to get some. the baking scared me a bit because it looked like it was boiling over (that is where the stiring comes in). it tastes great baked and not baked (its really chewy) my only problem is the grease at the bottom of the pans. i just dabbed the excess off with paper towels. other than that, it is a HUGE HIT!!! my oldest wants to add peanuts, marshmallows and chocolate chips. i think its fine as is. the next time i make it i will only use 1/2 cup butter like someone posted to see if there is a difference. i would suggest using 3/4 or 1 cup of unpopped popcorn kernels. i had more caramel than expected. its still good!!!!!

Used to make something like this when I was a kid to bring to the drive-in movies...AWESOME and easy! Followed the advice of 1/2c. butter and then just the recipe.

Soo good! I didn't have any vanilla so I had to leave that out. I used three bags of kettle corn and baked the whole thing in a big roasting pan. I did stir it after taking it out of the oven, while it was cooling, just so it wouldn't be in chunks but individual pieces. Delicious, and well worth the time!

A delicious treat!  I scaled it down to 5 servings.  I used half the amount of butter.  Instead of corn syrup, I used half honey and half simple syrup (my simple syrup is made of equal parts water and sugar).  My first batch of caramel burned on the stove, but luckily I had enough ingredients left for a second try.  Keep a close eye on your caramel!

Helpful tips from other reviewers made this really easy.  I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn.  Make sure you dump the popcorn in a bowl so the unpopped kernels fall to the bottom of the bowl.  I put everything in a paper grocery bag and stirred and shook the bag and put back in the microwave for about 30 seconds to warm it so the carmel coats well.  You may need to microwave a couple of times to make sure it coats well.  Then I pour it out on freezer paper until it hardens.  It was a hit when I made for my kids classmates at school!

This has become an instant staple for our football stand concession stand.  One tip, spray the baking pans with a light coating of oil to avoid having to sandblast the caramel off when cleaning.

This recipe must be very forgiving because I really botched it up and the popcorn is still incredibly delicious.  This is the kind of food that you eat, and eat, and keep eating until you look down and realize that you've eaten the entire bowl.  I only made 1/2 batch, and wish I had made more since it really wasn't that difficult.  Finding a big enough bowl to fit all of the popcorn is the hardest thing about this recipe.  My first "mess up" was that I only had 1/3 cup butter, instead of 1/2 cup, but it still tastes buttery, and I almost think that the full amount would have been too much.  After finishing coating the popcorn, I realized that I never added the baking soda - mess up #2.  And my 3rd wasn't really a mess up - I just decided based on some reviews and how my caramel corn tasted and hardened that I didn't need to bake it.  I would probably opt to skip this step in the future.  This stuff doesn't even compare to the store bought.  This is buttery, sweet, a little salty.  It's crunchy, a little chewy - it's everything you want in caramel corn!

Best caramel corn ever.  Reminds of going to the fair as a child and getting a big cup of warm caramel corn and eating it with a spoon.  I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I mixed the popcorn and caramel in a large paper bag to reduce on dishes.  Worked like a charm.  I also kept the popped corn warm in the oven at 250 until it was time to mix with the caramel.  I baked it in the oven as stated but found out its actually not necessary.  The amount I left out to eat warm hardened perfectly on its own.  Next time I will skip the baking altogether.  Thank you for such an easy and wonderful recipe.  My 5 children went gaga over it!  I'm going to have to make more tonight if we're going to make it through the weekend!  Superb!

Yum!  I am on my third batch.  I halved the butter as many suggested. I used Orville Redenbacher's Natural Simply Salted microwave popcorn and kept it warm in the oven until time to coat.  I used a large brown bag to distribute the caramel all over the popcorn before baking. It baked for about 45 minutes to just the right consistency of crunchy/chewiness.  After allowing the popcorn to cool I distributed it into  2 pound decorative plastic containers and drizzled it with dark chocolate.  The perfect gift for co-workers.  I attached the recipe as a gift tag.  Cute.

OMG!!!  This recipe should come with a warning label that reads highly addictive!  It is so easy and it tastes so much better than any you can buy.  Like others suggested, I used only 1/2 cup butter and it was plenty.  I popped two bags of the 94% Fat Free Microwave popcorn(that is all I had on hand) and I also used Safeway brand brown sugar.  I was afraid when I took it out of the oven and it was sticky.  I baked it in two 9"x13" glass dishes sprayed with Pam.  When I took it out of the oven after the hour was up, I spread it out on a jelly roll pan and kind of separated it a bit while it was warm.  After it cooled, it was perfect!  Just make sure you stir it up every 15 minutes like the recipe says.  Next time, I am going to add peanuts or almonds.  This would be great to give away at the holidays.  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe!

This is so good it should be illegal! The secret is keeping the popcorn hot. I think that's what keeps it from deflating when you put on the caramel. Also the stirring during the baking time,that seems to be essential. I use wooden spoons for the mixing and stirring and I grease everything. I've made this twice now and both times it has come out just melt in your mouth perfect. I have the sweet and salty thing going on so I up the salt some. I roast fresh peanuts to put in and I also use air popped corn. In my air popper,which has it's own half cup measure, I use two half cup measures, that's two batches,half cup at a time, and then another quarter measure and that has given me the correct amount of popped corn. I keep the corn hot in the 250 oven and just follow the recipe from there. I have cut the butter in half and it's just as good really. I thought I'd only make half a recipe this time but for some reason ended up making the whole thing, stuff really is addictive! lol

This recipe makes really, really good caramel corn!  I used smart pop microwave popcorn, as it was all I had on hand.  I took others advice and kept the popcorn warm until ready to mix.  It mixed very easily and coated extremely well.  I found it helpful to take to popcorn out of the pan while it was still hot and place it on parchment paper to cool and get crunchy!.  That way none sticks to the pan.  After about 10-15 minutes I was able to break up the popcorn easily.  Very good!

Awsome popcorn. The best I have ever had I made it into Cinnabon Clone Caramel Popcorn: Use the recipe as stated but with twice the popcorn and 1/2 the butter. Make the frosted coating: Melt 6 cubes of white bark in small non-stick sauce pan set on low. When melted stir in 2 tsp ground cinnamon. After popcorn is removed from the oven/cooled/and broken apart, place wax paper on counter with popcorn spread out in a single layer. Frost with melted bark using a wooden skewer or chop stick, dipping into pan and shaking over popcorn. let dry and enjoy

I really like this but it came out on the grainy side.  I'm not sure why, but I have made this several times with margarine and have not had that happen.  It still tastes good, but would prefer it smooth.  Also, with butter, you get a more toffe flavor and with margarine you get a true caramel flavor.  I always cook caramel corn in a large, disposable roasting pan to make it easier to stir without having pieces spill out.  Very good either way!

THIS IS SOOO GOOOOD!!!
I stick to the recipe, but use Brown Sugar flavored Corn Syrup from Karo and Light Brown Sugar. (Its what I had at the house) 3 Bags of Natural Popcorn seem to be the perfect amount. Some reviews say it is too greasy, but if you stick with the Natural Popcorn and wait till it is COMPLETELY cooled off, you wont get greasy fingers. I make this every week for our family movie night!

Fantastic!!!! This is so addictive and delicious! I added a couple of sprinkles of cinnamon to the caramel mixture. I have made this recipe a number of times - I usually make it with 1 cup of earth's balance margarine that has non-hydrogenated fat. It came out great - but I still wanted to find a way to cut some of the fat. I saw this exact recipe on cookinglight.com and it only called for 1/3 cup of butter. So again - I substituted 1/3 cup of earth's balance for the butter and the results are identical to the original recipe with a lot less fat! SOOOOO GOOOOD!!!

This was so delicious but I did have one tiny issue with it.  After it was done, the caramel looked very grainy and clumpy on the popcorn, not a smooth shiny coat like store bought caramel popcorn.  You didn't really notice the grainy-ness when eating it because of the crunch of the popcorn, but still, I was a little embarassed sending it to work with my hubby because it looks like it didn't turn out right...  I don't know if this is normal for homemade and noone minded it or if maybe I just needed to boil mine longer than the 4 mins... Hmmm...  Well I will definately try this recipe again and hope for better results, because it was so yummy!

Used 7 quarts of "natural" flavored (popped from the bag) off brand popcorn.  It was a little salty and buttery, so I omitted the salt.  Doubled all the topping ingredients (except the butter--1 and a 1/2 it, and the vanilla, tripled it).  Mixed 3 c. peanuts right in with the dry popcorn before adding the caramel.  Covered my baking pans with foil for super quick and easy clean-up.  Got raved reviews!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is definately a keeper and i'm a teenager who looks for simple recipes and it was so simple. This was so good and addictive and i halved the butter it called for like some others did and reallly, it is still amazing! instead of mixing it in a bowl, i put it in a big cylindrical container with a lid and shook. It was easier for me to do that but its kinda hard to take the caramel of the pots so  soak it in hot water with soap.

Easy to make; tastes yummy - actually, it's quite addicting!
**update; i've made this several times and my only suggestions are: 1. use a large tablespoon of coconut oil (it's solid and found in health food section) when popping the corn, it gives it a bakery style taste - noticed only after the caramel topping is added; also...1 heaping table spoon of coconut oil to 1 cup of un-popped kernals (the mushroom style of popcorn kernels makes nice big popped corn) seems about right
2. use a NON-STICK pan when cooking the caramel topping; HUGE difference in texture/taste; THE BEST!!

I have made this several times, sometimes I substitute margarine for butter, and it turns out great every time.  (I do prefer this recipe with maragarine.)  For those of you having trouble coating all the popcorn initially don't worry about it, it will evenly coat while it's in the oven.

Awesome! I made the recipe as is. I used dark corn syrup since the recipe didn't specify light or dark, and I used dark brown sugar since that is what I prefer. It was perfect! I did add peanuts, which were a bit difficult to blend in. Next time I am going to stir in the peanuts when I add the vanilla and soda, stir, and then drizzle over the popcorn to make incorporating them easier.

I was looking for a tasty caramel corn recipe and found it here!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a few tablespoons less butter (because it was all I had) and only cooked it for 45 minutes.  It was perfection!  My husband said it came out WAY better than the tinned variety.  For those who use air popped popcorn, a 4 cup measure is equal to 1 quart.

I've been making this caramel popcorn for years, only I cook the caramel for 5 minutes and I omit the salt.  I use one cup of popping corn which I then air-pop. This is delicious and addictive.  I like to use a silicone mat on my baking pan, but waxed paper coated with cooking spray works okay (just be careful not to tear it) and makes clean-up a breeze. I tried using half the butter as some suggested; it tasted the same but it didn't make as much caramel, ended up with some pieces of naked popcorn.

Great recipe. I used various suggestions from previous reveiwers and it turned out wonderful. 

3 bags of microwave popcorn- natural (not butter flavor, otherwise its too greasy)

Baked in those turkey foil tins. The dish was deep enough so I could stir without spillage and also then I could have less clean up (since they are disposable). 

Didn't reduce butter like others suggested, but easily could have. It is rich enough with out all the butter. Go ahead and half it.

This was awesome. So easy to make and tasted wonderful. Some reviewers said thier popcorn came out gooey or soggy, I think they may have not left it in the oven long enough. Mine was gooey and soft at first but after an hour in the oven they were crunchy and separated easily. Great recipe..will definitely make again!

This popcorn tasted really great. I also added melted bark chocolate to the popcorn after it had cooled. Once the chocolate hardened, the popcorn was ready to serve and be devoured! I took it to a party and people raved about it. Cutting the butter in half makes the caramel very hard to mix with the popcorn, but it'll spread throughout in the oven when you mix it. Definitely be sure to mix every 10 minutes, otherwise the popcorn will stick to the pan and the caramel wont mix evenly with the popcorn. It tasted great and am definitely going to make the chocolate-covered caramel popcorn again!!!

I made this on impulse when my sisters came around to watch movies. I was so easy and quick to make and it tasted fantastic!!! The only issue i have with it is that it went a little chalky if left sitting on the table for more than a couple of hours. Ive made it again since and used an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar and used golden syrup instead and it gave it a much more toffee caramel consistency. Love this will make over and over and over. Thanks for sharing.

Really good. I took the advice of others and cut the butter in 1/2, lined a big pan with foil and sprayed with Pam. Also cooked for about 35 minutes. It turned out perfect, and clean up was easy. Thank you.

Am I the only one that thinks it doesn't even need to go into the oven?  I think an hour is much too long, and it ends up tasting a bit burnt.  I just baked it for 15 minutes, and it was very good.

I made this twice, once with dark brown sugar, and once with golden brown sugar. The dark brown had more of a burnt/molasses taste so if you go that route I'd recommend lowering the oven temp. The golden brown was delicious

Delicious.  I used 2 bags microwave popcorn (Smart Pop) and it worked great.  Only thing is, I didn't pick out the unpopped kernals and that needs to be done.  Otherwise, It got rave reviews all around the neighborhood.

Oh Yeah Baby! This is the best stuff ever! Highly addictive. My regular popcorn didn't pop, I guess it was old, so I used microwave butter flavor popcorn and it came out pretty rich, but awesome! Plenty of caramel for the corn too which I loved, as some recipes I've used before you had to work really hard to get the caramel even on all the pieces, this was not like that. I even added couple of cups more popcorn since I had so much caramel. I dumped this out onto parchment paper and broke into pieces immediately. It'a easier that way because if you wait til it's cooled you get a lot of broken popcorn pieces. Do take the time to pick out the unpopped kernals first though before adding the caramel. My DH described this best after eating an entire bowl, "This stuff is sinful!". I'll be walking an extra mile tomorrow because I just had to eat a bunch of this... oh, but it's worth every step.

I used 2 bags of buttered microwave popcorn and added whole almonds. This was wonderful and addictive. I cooked one pan in the oven and then didn't cook the other because we thought it tasted just as good. The cooked pan was crunchy and the uncooked pan was more chewy. I will probably cook them both next time. We liked the crunchy better.

WOW, this recipe was sooo yummy!  Make sure you are expecting company before you make this or you will end up eating the entire mix yourself.  I took the advice of the others and cut the butter in half and added a jar of honey roasted peanuts.

Delicious!  This was so easy to make and so tasty, I'll never buy the boxed stuff again!  Don't know how many quarts of popped popcorn I wound with, but I used one cup unpopped and it was the perfect amount.  I only had dark corn syrup (can't figure out why!) which gave the mixture a deeper taste.  I would revert back to light corn syrup next time.  I also threw in 1 tsp baking soda instead of 1/2 tsp by accident, and I actually love the very light mixture that resulted.

Definitely a keeper!!!

WOW this is delicious. Tastes just as good, or better than if I were to buy it from a gourmet shop. Relatively easy to make, if not a bit sticky/messy..but wouldn't expect caramel not to be! :] I added pecans to the pan with the popcorn and it's heavenly. I will never buy caramel popcorn again!

I used dark corn syrup for this because I didn't have light.. I have seen several recipes for caramel popcorn that called for dark but I do think light works best here.  I really think the key to making successful caramel popcorn is to watch the salt.  its best to start with unsalted popcorn so you have control over how much goes in.  And definitely make sure you dont get any unpopped corn kernels in the popcorn before adding the syrup.. it ruins it when you unexpectedly bite down into a hard kernel (since it gets stuck to the popcorn).  The first time I made this, I mixed in some candy corn (after baking) since it was around Halloween time and we had some leftover.  The last time I made this I mixed in peanut m&ms after the caramel popcorn was done and cooled off.

This popcorn is so good and addictive!  I gave some out for Christmas, but first I took about 1/3 of the batch and coated it in melted chocolate and mixed it back in the with the caramel popcorn...yum!

Perfect!  I've made this 3 times now.  The first time, it was perfect.  The second time I grabbed the wrong salt (fake stuff).  Don't use fake salt or reduced sodium salt.  It will curdle the caramel.  When I made my third batch, I used regular (morton) salt and it worked perfectly.  I also added pecans and almonds... wow!

Yummy Snack! I only made a half of a batch, but it was so good I should have made the whole thing! Next time I think I will add some nuts, maybe pecans or peanuts.

Fantastic!  Just like my mom's.
Two things: I made way too much popcorn--8 quarts instead of 5--and I still had plenty of caramel sauce.  I can't taste any difference.
Secondly, I made it in the microwave using two large plastic bowls, rotating each one for 40 seconds at a time while stirring the other, for about 2.5 minutes total per bowl.

The trick here is in the preparation.  
* First I pop 3 regular size bags of Natural flavor microwave popcorn & place them in a huge (10 gal!)round cooler & sift out the old maids. 
* Preheat the oven to 300F (hard crack temp) & line 2 half sheet pans with parchment.
* Follow recipe as written.  
Notes: Either light/dark corn syrup or brown sugar are fine.  Mixture will foam and double in size when soda is added.  
* Cook for 10 minutes, then stir & cook 10 more minutes.  
* Return the cooked popcorn to the bowl & stir occasionally until completely cooled to keep it from clumping up.

Very simple to make and once I start eating this, I can hardly stop.  Definitely use parchment paper in the oven, it makes cleanup a breeze.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks!

I've been making this recipe for years, handed down from my Grandmother, and it's always a hit.  I only bake mine for 30 minutes (stirring every 10 minutes) and it turns out great!  I made a big batch of this the other day for my husband to take to work, and he said it was gone within minutes.  Great recipe!

This recipe is awesome!  I followed others' suggestions and baked for only 15 minutes and it was PERFECT, done enough that it didn't clump but still a little chewy where the caramel was slightly thicker.  Made it for the youth group at my church and it disappeared.  Will definitely add this to my recipe box.

My family had a HUGE Halloween party on Oct. 21st. We all got together, 5 sisters, and a sister in law, along with our spouses to carve the 30 pumpkins for the party on Oct. 15th. I made a big bowl of this to take. It was gone in about 15 minutes, and a total hit! I didn't change anything in the recipe. One of my sisters commented that she remembered the caramel corn I used to make them when they were little. Being the oldest, I used to do all the popcorn making/popping in our house. 8 kids took a lot of popcorn on Sunday nights. Thanks for a great recipe, it brought back memories that are dear to us, esp. since we have one parent that has passed.

Loved this recipe. "Melts in your mouth" according to my teenagers.  First time out I made it just as written.  I used salted butter so the secound time I left out the salt and it tasted great.  A hit at work, as well.  Took the advice of others and kept the popcorn warm in the oven while the caramel cooked.  I used popcorn popped in a hot air popper, as well as the microwave variety.  I did used a store brand brown sugar and did not have any problems with graininess (that a word?).  Thanks for the recipe, it has become a favorite!

Thanks for a wonderful recipe! I was looking for something like this yesterday, and although it takes a while to make, the outcome was better than what I expected! Everyone loved it and said it was exactly like the kind you'd find in cinemas. The only difference I made was use one stick of butter, and baking powder instead of baking soda. I also used 2 bags of popped popcorn (Orvill Redenbacher's Natural) and it was enough to make the recipe taste perfert.

I made this recipe last night and it was very simple.  I only had orville's smart pop microwave so I made three bags, there was more than enough to coat the popcorn.  I did think it was a little sweet so I'll probably cut the sugar back a bit next time but everyone else loved it.  I think it's even better the next day...very addicting though

I actually went through all the reviews to pick up tips, and I tried it today and it is GLORIOUS. I did two batches - one baked and one unbaked. The unbaked batch was great - all gooey and decadent but I REALLY recommend baking the popcorn because the end result is a crisp, light coating on the popcorn. The caramel/toffee flavor also "matures", in a sense, which doesn't make it too heavy.
It is rather too sweet, but what can I expect from caramel popcorn? Soaking the pan and utensils in hot, soapy water was the best tip I ever laid on eyes on - wash up was ridiculously easy. I'm keeping this one until I'm on my rocker - thanks!

After reading all the reviews about this being messy to stir I realized I didn't have a big enough bowl to put the all popcorn with the hot sticky caramel. I wondered how it would work if I dumped everything in the kitchen sink and mixed it up? It was just the perfect size! I also used long salad tongs to mix it up and was able to avoid burning my hands. The best part was clean up afterwards...just hot soapy water in the sink! I used two 13 x 9 pans to put in the oven.

Three bags of salted popcorn and the entire caramel recipe was the perfect comination for me and just the right sweetness...we just had a party for fifteen people (kids and adults) and it was gone in less than fifteen minutes! Yum!!!!

Very, very good!  We love to get hot caramel popcorn on the Jersey Boardwalk and this tasted just like that! I followed the other users advice and used 2 bags of popcorn and baked for a total of 45 minutes.  I noticed that the caramel mixture got very thick quickly when I was pouring it on the popcorn...maybe I over cooked it a bit?

I make this all the time.  I will half the suggested recipe amount and use that for two bags of natural popcorn and it coats each kernel w/a good amount of caramel.  I only bake it 3 times for 15 minutes and it gives a chewy but crunchy texture.  Great when sitting at home watching a movie or any tv show!

I made this for my father in law, it tasted a little more like toffee, but still great. Just 1 recommendation, wear gloves when stiring in the caramel to the popcorn. I used a gigantic bowl and still had bits flying everywhere - i burnt my finger while I "caught and threw back" peices covered in caramel and spent an hour wearing an ice pack on my finger.

Yes, this is quite good.  Here are a few tips that I think really helped me when I made this.  First, I used DARK corn syrup and LIGHT brown sugar.  I did not see anybody mention this, so I thought it might be important.  Also, I did halve the recipe, and I did "run out" of the caramel before I ran out of popcorn-- mainly because I like a heavier coating (my batch is much more clustery).  Also, thr BEST thing to do here is pop your own popcorn on the stovetop-- it's not at all greesy or salty that way, and it simply tastes better then anything coming from the microwave.  

To halve the recipe, I popped 1/2 cup of regular popping corn (and had few unpopped kernels), and that yielded roughly 12-13 cups of popcorn.  If you want an estimate of how much a halved recipe yields when all is said and done..  I have just over one large mixing bowl full of caramel popcorn now, which would be good for 1-2 people when they are watching a movie or something.  If you have kids or something, you fir sure want to make the full batch as indicated in the original recipe.  :)

This is a very simple recipe that makes great caramel popcorn! I used a nonstick roasting pan to mix it and bake it, but coated it with butter just in case, and I used about 1 cup of unpopped corn. As suggested by others, I also baked it for just 45 minutes. It's great stuff!

Unbelievably easy and so good! I made several batches to give as gifts to people at work. Everyone loved it and I got several requests for the recipe. This one is a keeper - easy enough for a novice cook, but so delicious it will satisfy the pickiest foodie.

Overall I thought this was a great recipe.  I would just like to add a couple of suggestions.  First, I think that you could easily make 6 or 7 quarts of popcorn rather than the suggested 5.  Secondly, I thought that it was a tad salty (especially when using microwave popcorn that's pre-salted), so I recommend leaving out the salt.  Lastly, be sure to grease your pans!  I didn't and it was very hard to scrape up the popcorn without breaking it up.

I figured this many people couldn't be wrong....boy was I right!!  Mine turned out great.  3 bags of Orville Redenbacher's Tender White popcorn...only 1/2 teasp of salt, and the best tip on the reviews..use tongs to separate when coating and turning in oven.  I baked mine 45 min in 2 foil lined 9X13 pans. It was perfect.  Definitely a "keeper"!

This was good. My husband burnt some of it, so it coud have been better. Besides that though, I think there may be better recipes out there, but this is still a yummy one to try.

I am now famous for this popcorn!  My daughter called it *sticky popcorn* and now it is my #1 requested recipe!  I use margarine instead of butter, half the recipe for the toffee, and use 2 bags of popcorn. Use a tinfoil/cooking spray combo on your baking sheets and you won't have to worry about sticking.  Whoever is throwing out pans, stop it!  Hot soapy water and a little time to soak will melt the sugar right off. Oh, be sure to follow the baking procedure, stirring every 15 minutes if you don't want the toffee to pull out your fillings!

If you just add carmel mixture to popcorn and bake for 15 min. it gives you gooey carmel popcorn. Then I finish baking the other half for the crunchy carmel popcorn. YUMMY YUMMY!!

I made this last night for my family it is perfectly delicious! I will definately make this again. Good thing to make for friends, neighbors or just for you. 
I used two bags of popcorn microwaved till done, picked out all the kernals and followed the directions. I did spray both my cookie sheets with no stick spray and it was easy cleanup.
I  also scraped it straight onto wax paper and cleaned the pans immediatly. I added Chocolate to half but I prefer it without. I also only baked for forty~five minutes and It WAS AWESOME!!!!!!

I'm excited to try this recipe and really appreciate all the reviews that explained, in easy terms, how much popcorn to use.  "5 quarts popcorn" means nothing to me.  I need directions like, "pop one cup of popcorn" or "pop 3 bags of popcorn".  So thanks for the hints from the reviewers.  I'll be trying this tonight!

Absolutely wonderful! I used 4 bags of microwave popcorn(2 bags of butter flavor and 2 bags of plain). It was all so good. I bake it in 2, 9x13" glass casserole dishes. It did stick very bad. Next time I will grease the pans. But it was still so good. My hubby loved it and he is VERY hard to impress. THANKS =)

This popcorn is absolutely delicious! I used two bags of microwave popcorn and had plenty of carmel to coat it all. I made clean up easy by lining my baking sheets in foil (greased, of course), and then simply disposing of the foil. Also, I recommend running really hot water with a bit of soap in the pan(s) that you use to make the caramel sauce. Let it sit for 30 min or so. The hot, soapy water liquifies the carmel and you won't have a sticky mess to clean up!

I really love this recipe, and have been making it for about a year now.  I air-popped about a cup and a half of popcorn kernels and that amount seemed to be just right.  I also mix and bake the whole thing in a huge restaurant-sized tinfoil pan, which I keep washing and reusing for this purpose.  I also baked the corn for about 45 minutes and that worked out well for me.  Not so crispy that the kernels break up when you stir it or grab some, but not so soft that it rips your dental fillings out.  Very easy and very successful recipe!

As if this recipe needs another five-star review... I threw in about two cups of pecans, but any nuts would be great. As for the baking time, forty-five minutes was perfect, making the popcorn light and crisp, but not at all burned. Delicious!

WOW WEE!!!! It is DELICIOUS!!!  Honest to Pete.......aboslutely wonderful.  Way better than Crunch and Munch!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and cooked for the whole hour. PERFECT!!!!!  One thing that I thought made things a little easier.  I have the BIG Tupperware Salad Bowl.  I put the popcorn in that bowl and then poured the caramel mixture over.  Then put the lid on the bowl and shake, shake, shake.  It coated everything well, much easier than trying to stir it with a spoon with popcorn flying out of the bowl.  Worked great.  I also used aluminum foil baking pans sprayed with Pam.  No problems at all!!!  IT IS SO GOOD!!!!!!

This recipe is excellent!!!  I have used it the past couple of years to make a fall "trail mix" for my son's class.  I make individual bags with the carmel corn, fall M&M's, candy corn and pretzels.  The kids (and adults) love it!!

OHHHH MYYYYYY GOOOOODNESSSSSSS!!!  If I could give more than 5 stars to this recipe, I would.  Absolutely wonderful!  The only change I made to the recipe was the addition of about 1/2 cup of blister peanuts (very crunchy peanuts found at Trader Joe's) to the popcorn before drizzling in the caramel, which I found easy to do using a large spoon, instead of pouring from the pan.  Also, I was out of light corn syrup (making too many batches of Coconut Brittle, also found on this site), so I used dark, and it was wonderful.  I baked mine for the recommended time, in 2 - 9 x 13 inch baking dishes, lined with Reynolds Release foil (one of the BEST inventions in the world, I think! lol).  Cleanup was a breeze.  My Dentist thanks you for giving us this awesome recipe!

I made this 4 days ago and am now making it a second time - at 7:00 PM due to the persistent begging of my family!  This is wonderful caramel popcorn--as good as you'd buy at a specialty stand/store!  I did use 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter and only baked for 40-45 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  Gotta go stir my caramel corn!  Happy eating!

This recipe came out great!  I was just a little concerned with how dull it looked when I was finished.  I supposed I expected it to more shiny.  Other than that, the popcorn tasted fine!

Took this to work where it received rave reviews, everyone said it was the best and wanted the recipe. A bit sweet w/ 2 bags light microwave popcorn-next time I will use 6 quarts instead of 5.  Also, next time will add nuts.  It was very easy to make and after spraying my roasting pan, clean up was a breeze.  Would make a nice hostess or thank-you gift in a decorative tin.

This was great!  Very simple, and tasted wonderful.  I never knew how easy it was.  WATCH OUT FOR KERNELS.  Those suckers hurt when you bite down on them.  I tried chocolate covering some of the caramel corn, which turned out fabulous.  But with or without chocolate, this was yummy, thanks!

This was too sweet for my taste and made a mess. It was also a little greasy -- two sticks of butter? I'd rather buy Cracker Jacks.

This is a very good recipe, but it tastes a lot like Orville Redenbachers microwave caramel corn, which is a lot less work.  I used the 3 bags of microwave popcorn that was suggested and I also sprayed the bottom of my pans to ease in clean up.  What made it even easier was the fact that I bought disposable aluminum pans and just discarded them after I was done cooking.  I gave the recipe 5 stars because it is very good, but it's a lot of work.

Wow!  Is this ever delicious!  And easy.  Much better than the stuff we get on the boardwalk.  We were recently snowed in and looking for something fun to do.  So my son and I made this.  It was gone by the next day.  Only complaint - this recipe should have instructions on how to stop eating it!!!

Be warned!  This stuff is so addictive!!  Yum!!  It's even more decadent if you add salted cashews and halved pecans to it.  You won't stop eating until it's all gone or your fillings come out...which ever comes first!

Recipe is very easy and the results are fantastic! I have been using this recipe for several years now and I get rave reviews each year. I do add peanuts and broken pretzels sometimes to add a little more pizzazz when it is a gift.  Clean-up is very easy if you use hot water - the sticky candy just melts off the pans.

Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! My family's alltime favorite! This recipe makes enough caramel for me to use on 4 to 5 bags of microwave popcorn. It also took only 45 minutes of baking time! Thank you! I'm defenitely keeping this one =)

I have made this twice, exactly as written both times, and it turned out perfectly both times. I used 1 cup of uncooked popcorn kernels and the ratio of caramel to popcorn was perfect. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and continued stirring the popcorn after it finished cooking, as it cooled, to prevent caramel pooling underneath & to prevent large clumps.
To make extra special caramel corn for a special event, I melted some Hershey kisses and drizzled over the cooked caramel corn.

Tried it today and can't stop eating it! I put foil on two large jelly roll pans, sprayed them with cooking spray, then put the popcorn on those in the oven. EASY clean up that way. I used 3/4 cup of butter (all I had in the kitchen), and it turned out great. Would love to try it with some nuts.

This is by far the best caramel popcorn ever! It is not sticky whatsoever, so the kiddos can eat it in front of the tv for "movie night", no worries there. It is crunchy, but in a crumbly way, not the "you're about to lose a tooth" way. The flavor is amazing.

I only made one tiny change, I reduced the salt, I only used a pinch of salt, simply because I don't like caramel salty. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.

It makes a very large amount.

I've been making this recipe for 40 years!  Passed down to me from my Grandma Alderson, who said she got it from the back of a JiffyPop bag!!  When my daughter was in high school, I made several batches of this (each batch makes a considerable amount) to send with her youth group on a mission trip.  Many of her friends still remember me as the 'Caramel Corn Lady'!  One tip...don't use generic brown sugar.  It tends to granulate more and just doesn't taste as good.  I always use quality, name brand light brown sugar.  Also, please, PLEASE don't use margarine for this!  No reason to waste good ingredients by using margarine.  =)

I have used this recipe for years until I lost it.  It is a great snack that my whole family enjoys. Please do NOT substitute margarine for the butter. This is not meant to be a low calorie snack, and the butter taste is something you cannot get with margarine. My family thanks you for this wonderful recipe as they can now enjoy this great snack again.

I just made this and it turned out awesome. My house smells like a candy shop in Gatlinburg, TN. I made it with this 5 star exact recipe. Why change a perfect recipe?  But added a few roasted peanuts to one pan.

Just tried this for the first time at a baby shower I had and it was a big hit.  I switched it up a bit by adding pretzel sticks and Shreddies cereal.  I followed the directions exactly and it had 15 ladies begging me for the recipe.  Will be making this again in no time!

As written I had problems with this recipe. Although I was following the directions exactly the carmel would either burn in the oven within the first 15 minutes or turned out so granulated that it hurt the tongue to eat. I just couldn't believe that the recipe had so many perfect reviews so I kept trying to get this recipe to work. I finally came across Sarah's review and took her advice. Increased Corn syrup to 3/4 cup and baking soda to a full teaspoon and reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon. It turned out great with those changes!!!! I melted down some Hersheys HUGS and drizzled on top. Soo Yummy! I also noticed that I had to increase the amount of popped popcorn to 3/4 cup uncooked kernels. 1/2 was too little and would cause the carmel to be too thick which would cause it to be grainy as well.

This was super easy to make. I followed some other reviewers and used 1/2 cup butter, not the full cup. I thought it was still buttery without being greasy. It was crunchy and buttery and sweet. Very easy to make!! Next time, and there WILL  be a next time, I'll put the popcorn into a large bowl and mix in the coating. I tried to mix it right on the baking sheet and it was a bit tricky. It didn't set up all that fast, so if I work quick, it should be just fine. I baked the popcorn on trays that were covered with greased tin foil and had no issues. If you let the pan and spoon sit in some hot,soapy water for a bit, they come clean with very little scrubbing.

Been using this recipe for years! Very tasty!
As a few others mentioned: Leaving the popcorn in the oven while it preheats and drizzling caramel sauce on the warm popcorn make it much easier to stir together!

I am making this for the first time, it really exceeded my expectations. I did not read any of the reviews prior to trying it, so I made it as the directions called for. I just hit the first 15 minute mark to stir it while in the oven, took a piece out, and could not be more satisfied. So great, I will recommend this to everyone!! Hopefully it is nice and crunchy after it cools. I will just put it in for 45 minutes, like some have suggested :)

I've made probably 3 or 4 double batches of this recipe for the past couple of years around Christmas. Double batches disappear in around an hour with a group of people. No one can resist the power of this recipe. I get steady requests for it all year. I make it just as it is, no modifications. I've left it raw after spreading the mixture over the poopcorn for a gooey treat and I've also baked it for the PERFECT hard shelled confection. Just do it. Just make the recipe. It never fails.

Tried several different caramel corn recipes and this one is the best by far!!!  I followed the directions exactly as written and it comes out perfect every time.  The only thing I do differently is, after I remove it from the oven I spread it out over some waxed paper to cool in a single layer.  This was I don't have to break it apart.

Delicious toasty caramel flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it spot on.  It is easy to make, easy to clean up and very tasty.  Next time I may add peanuts.  My family loves this popcorn.

This stuff is ADDICTING!!!! We make several batches of this popcorn, bag it up, and give it out to teachers, baby shower favors, party favors, you name it. People go crazy over it! One man refused to believe it was homemade! Word of warning, spray your baking pan with non stick spray or it will stick to the bottom of the pan as it cools!

i strongly suggest not putting it in the oven. the caramel was great after having finished making it, but after the hour in the oven, while the popcorn was no longer big clumps of caramel and popcorn, the caramel had become some what grainy and didn't taste nearly as good as it did after having made it.

I tried this and everyone loved it and I've done it several times now. I used plain yellow popcorn kernels and popped them in a paper bag in the microwave. Just one layer on the bottom of the bag for 2 and a half minutes until I had enough to fill 2 foil pans. 

For the caramel make sure when you measure, you pack the brown sugar in so you actually get 2 cups. And it's important to use medium heat, you don't want to bring it to the boil too quickly and you must stir constantly. Leave it alone on a low boil for the 4 minutes and don't forget to remove it from the heat before you add the baking soda and vanilla.

We don't like it too sweet so I only add just enough caramel to coat but not completely drown the corn. I also only stir it once at 15 minutes and then take it out 15 minutes after that and stir it once more and let it cool. Once, I didn't have enough time and it was in the oven for only 15 minutes and I turned let it cool and it was fine.

It is fine/great just the way it is written.  I did not find any of the other reviews or suggestions useful.  I used dark brown sugar and it was fine.  Used 1cup of butter and it was great.  It did not drizzle in a stream as someone suggested. You can't if you made the Carmel correctly. I just poured the Carmel on little by little as the recipe suggests and tossed like a salad. I did not warm the popcorn before adding the carmel.  It surprises me that people don't know how to cook popcorn on the stove...maybe they had to change the recipe because they used microwave popcorn?  I popped enough popcorn to fill a very large wooden salad bowl and the amount of Carmel was perfect.  I think I popped 4 medium sized pots of it. Probably would fill a brown paper grocery bag 3/4 of the way.  Recipe is great.

Holy moly! This is delicious!  I am not a big caramel fan, but this popcorn is fabulous!  It is light, with a crispy shell that is the perfect thickness to compliment the light and airy popcorn inside.  I, like other reviewers, used a 1/2 lb (one stick) of butter.  I also put the popcorn in a large turkey roasting pan, like someone suggested, and I can't imagine doing it another way. It made it really easy to stir the popcorn every 15 minutes.  I wanted to experiment, so after the third stir, I added peanuts,  I realized this was too late.  I would suggest adding them to the caramel mixture before you add in the baking soda and vanilla.  This is when you normally add peanuts to peanut brittle, and I think if I poured the syrup on with the nuts mixed in, they would have stuck.  Once the popcorn was done baking, I took half of it and spread it out on parchment and then left the other half in the pan and threw in 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.  I can't decide which version I like better.  I think I am going to do this again (one half regular and one half chocolate) and let them cool, break them up and then mix them together so you can get a bite of each one!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is absolutely delish made this recipe last night it was a hit!!!! It was devoured so quickly I am making it again tonight. This will definitely be a keeper I can see this being a stocking stuffer for the holidays. Almost forgot I added chopped pretzels to this as well as some cashews for a little mix and the salty sweet crunchy texture was sooooo good.

LOVE THIS!  We used microwave popcorn so we didn't add the extra salt.  We used the Simply Salted by Orville Redenbacher.  We used 4 bags which is 4.5 cups popped/each.  The more popcorn versus carmel mixture, the crunchier.  We mixed in a large kettle and then spread out on two shallow pans and baked.  Will definitely make again.

Fantastic, easy, quick recipe.  Almost fool proof!  I used recipe calculator and split recipe in half and turned out great. My only small goof was that I stirred the caramel frequently after it boiled (instead of NOT stirring at all once it started boiling) and it was just a tiny bit grain in some bites.  No one but me noticed it. I also made another batch and had to use microwave popcorn since I was all out of raw kernels. I just omitted the salt and it still worked beautifully!  Definitely a do over and will consider adding nuts next time.

I've made this recipe twice in 2 days.  We bagged it as part of our year end gifts for our kids' teachers.  I followed the recipe exactly as written the 1st time...it was delish!  the 2nd time I added peanuts to 1/2 of the batch, result...awesome.  I also cut the cooking time the 2nd go round to 1/2 hour turning at 15 mins.  The only other thing I did differently was break apart and remove from the baking trays when it was cool enough to touch.  I found that when I left it to cool completely the 1st time, I had hard chunks where the caramel pooled while it cooled.  I prefer it softer/chewier.  I can see how this will quickly become a family favorite!  So good, and so easy!!

Honestly the best & easiest caramel popcorn ever!  I hand popped about 1 cup of popcorn on the stovetop to make this recipe.  I only needed to bake for 15 minutes, turned then another 15 minutes and it was perfect.   I also used the leftover carmel and let if sit for a moment before spooning it into wax paper, rolled & cinched the edges to make caramel candies.  FANTASTIC recipe.  My whole family loved it!

This is the best caramel popcorn ever! The pans did get really messy, but if you soak them in water just for a little while it will come off no problem. Next time I think I'll try to put parchment paper in the pan.

I made this last night and it is incredibly addictively awesome!  After reading other reviews, I did cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and I used 4 bags of microwaved popcorn.  I dumped the popcorn into a roasting pan that I cook my turkey in and mixed everything together in that.  Everyone loved it.  Next time, I am going to add some peanuts!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was very disappointed in this recipe overall.  Yes, it was super easy, and I followed the directions exactly.  However, at the end the taste was just lacking and had no spark or yummy factor.  Kind of a bitter after taste too.  I gave it two stars only because it was certainly edible and my grand kids will finish it up.  Not one I'll make again.

I made this to take to a friend's Academy Awards party and it won rave reviews!  The hardest part was figuring out how much uncooked popcorn would make 5 quarts of cooked popcorn (1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons). I added 1/2 cup of peanuts to the cooked popcorn before pouring the caramel over it and it was fabulous!

halved the recipe to try it before making a big batch. I wish I would have made the whole batch, this is AMAZING!! one of the best caramel corn recipes I've tried. I turned it into moose much by adding toasted pecans with the caramel and drizzling with dark chocolate after it cooled. Harry and davids has nothing on this.

Excellent. It said you needed 20 cups of popped corn though this was WAY too much as much of the popcorn remained uncovered w/ caramel. Minor problem easily corrected for such an AMAZING recipe!

I got this recipe from our Rodeo Director when she made it for one of our committee meetings; but I came to the website to find out how much unpopped corn, equals 5 quarts of popped popcorn. I do not know that answer, but I did pop 1 cup of unpopped popcorn in a hot air popcorn popper, and used that amount. My turkey roaster was filled up, with just enough room to add the caramel mixture and stir to coat. It is by far, the best caramel popcorn I have ever had. I was amazed at how evenly it was coated after it was done. I did bake it for the full 1 hour also. Yummy~Nummy treat! YeeHaw~~

Delicious!  I made half the recipe with one bag of microwave popcorn and added mixed nuts the first time.  I wasn't sure how much of the popcorn would last the hour in the oven since we kept tasting it.  It came out perfectly sweet and crunchy, though 45 minutes probably would have done it.  Second time I nixed the nuts but we thought it needed something a little salty to go with it, not that it stopped it from disappearing quickly.

These have been a huge hit in my house.......have been making them everyday for the past three days.........I added coarsely chopped  almonds and pecans on top of the popcorn before drizzling on the caramel.......they are better than store bought ones!!

I have been making this for Christmas presents for a number of years. Everyone I hae given it to raves about how good it is. However, I have wondered:how do you make 5 quarts of popcorn? I have an air popper and normally pop 1 cup of corn. The syrup seems really thick on the popped corn.

Love this caramel corn.  Make a ton of it during the holidays.  
I did try cutting back on the butter, as some reviewers recommended.  This did not work for me.  The caramel mixture was too thick and did not mix with the popcorn well.  I recommend using the full cup as listed in the original recipe.

I made this substituting xylitol "brown sugar" instead of regular and agave nectar instead of corn syrup. It worked perfectly. I took the advice of other reviewers and kept the cooked popcorn in the preheating oven to stay warm. It mixed well this way.

I think I did this mostly as instructed and it was delicious - I got rave reviews! But, I tried adding peanuts to the popcorn and then mixing in the corn syrup-brown sugar goo. Very few of the peanuts stuck to the popcorn. I used cocktail peanuts - cheap ones actually. What's the secret?

Wonderfully easy recipe. I haven't had home made caramel corn since my mom made it for us as kids. I also made the recipe on here for the glazed nut and added them to the popcorn. It will make wonderful Christmas gifts for my friends.

I didn't have any corn syrup so I used coconut nectar in it's place and it was amazing.   Don't know what it was like with the corn syrup- but I would definitely do it the same way next time.   Agave would probably work too.   I kept the popcorn warm, like the others said, and I used 28 cups of popcorn.  Everyone loved it.

WOW! You are all awesome.  I followed the advice and cut the butter in half, I kept the "naked" popcorn warm in oven it made mixing so much easier.  My family seems to prefer the 45 min bake time crunchiness.  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks for the review advice it made all the difference and makes for an irresistible, can't keep your fingers out of it, very yummy treat.

As suggested by other reviewers, I make double the amount of caramel.  The first time I made this was for my daughters Twilight themed birthday party so I added red Wilton food coloring to make "bloody" popcorn.  I made the normal recipe for a bake sale a few weeks ago and everyone was asking for the recipe.  This is a fabulous recipe!!

Amazing!  This has to be the best popcorn ever.  I make it just about every fall and get raves every time.

THis popcorn has a great look! It looks just like caramel popcorn and smells yummy. But it just is't hitting the spot for me. I am no chef (which is why I am here looking for recipes) but it was too salty. I tried to take out the salt and change the type of popcorn I used. I am never able to eat more than a handful of this caramel popcorn.

This is a wonderful base recipe for caramel corn.  It marries the perfect level of sweet and salty with a super crunch!   I changed mine up a little for fall and added about 5 ozs of dehydrated crushed apple chips to make caramel apple corn and it is wonderful!   Just follow the recipe minus about 2 cups of popcorn and add the apple chips in with the popcorn.  It's a definite keeper for us!

Thanks, this was wonderful. I had made up some caramel for my office (my boss and I make fresh candies for our customers) but had extra left over. This was perfect once I scaled down the popcorn amount. It was easy and delicious, plus I could coat (or not coat) as much popcorn as I wanted depending on how much I stir it. Thanks again.

I've tried many recipies for caramel popcorn but none has given the desired out come such as this. This recipe is really great, I however used 1/2 the butter and 1/2 cup of unpopped corn cernels which yielded approximately 2 1/2 quarts. This is recipe has joined my favorite list.

HOORAY for great recipes! :)  I made this today as a special treat for the kids and they absolutely loved it!  The adults did too!!  It is so rich in flavor and quite addictive!  The directions were clear and easy to follow.  The video helped too!  This is a keeper and will definitely become an annual Halloween treat. :)

Okay this recipe was simple enough for my 6 and 12 year old.  This popcorn was better than any carmal corn I have ever had.  I used a large non-stick roasting pan and added a tin larger of my stove top popcorn and then the caramal and then continued to layer until all of the caramal was used.

Delicious! This is the best caramel corn I have ever made- it may take longer than some others, but it's worth it. Make sure you use real fresh-popped popcorn (stay away from microwave popcorn).

I made this in the microwave like someone else had mentioned they did. big mistake first of all becuase it was so sticky even the next day. it just sticks to your teeth but not in the way caramel popcorn would if it was made right. hard to explain.  but the actual taste of the caramel was not too bad. cant say its the best i ever had but not bad i will be making this again next time as the directions say in the oven!

This is the first time I made this for Christmas gifts. It was so yummy! My hubby couldn't stop eating it. I had to race with him to pack the popcorn into Christmas packages. I bought Old Fashion Style Demerara sugar (it has refiner's syrup and caramel) by mistake. I used it anyway. It turned out great. It might have added extra caramel flavor to it. I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn and added  1 cup each of roasted peanuts and almonds as it suggested in the instructional video. The popcorn and nuts were still well-coated. Thank you for the great recipe!

Awesome! I've made a few batches of this popcorn and the other day I made a batch for a class I take each month (9 ladies in the class). I took the whole batch with me (along with other treats) and there were only crumbs left, and everyone asked for the recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I used more popped corn to caramel than the recipe called for because I don't like it overly sweet.  I think I waited too long to pour the caramel because it turned "gloppy" and thick. However once it was in the oven and stirred, it melted again and turned out just great.  Once it finally came out of the oven, I gave it a sprinkling of salt for some depth of flavour and it was amazing!  I recommend this for those who especially like that sweet/savoury combination.  Peeled peanuts added to the caramel would make this taste just like Crunch N' Munch.  I gave this 4 starts instead of 5 because I found it too plain for my tastes (and hence the salt).  Definately keeping this recipe!

Make this and you will hear Handel's Hallelujah Chorus playing in your head. Or whatever jubilant piece of classical music that suits your fancy. Sweet, rich, slightly salty flavor (I usually put more salt in since I'm just that kinda girl) that's surprisingly easy to make and well worth the wait when it's in the oven!

The VERY best caramel popcorn I have ever tasted.  Very easy to make.  We plan to give as Christmas gifts to family and friends. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was so easy. I took some other people's advice and made the caramel in the microwave. I had popped some popcorn already and put it in a paper grocery bag. I used three bags of standard microwave popcorn. Then I poured the caramel over the popcorn and shook up the bag. Then microwaved for 30 seconds and shook some more (and repeated this process 3-4 times). Then I poured it out onto aluminum foil to fully set. I thought the amount of popcorn I used was about right, but you could use less popcorn to get a heavier coating. It was so delicious. My husband doesn't particularly like popcorn (like the movie theater kind), but he gobbled this up. I will definitely make this again!

Super tasty.  I didn't evenly distribute the caramel over the popcorn, so we had super caramel and light caramel, but it worked.

I joined this website only so I could comment on how marvelous your caramel corn is.  That's how good it is! It's the best I've ever eaten.  So yummy!! Better than any I've made before or bought at the store.  I followed the instructions exactly (except I added peanuts, pecans & cashews - what flavor it adds! Wow!) and it came out perfect.  My family can't stop eating it. Thanks!

I made this for a recent movie night and people coul not stop eating this!  I even had people trying to stash away bags of the popcorn to take home.  I tried to mix on batch on the cookie sheet lined with wax paper-this worked ok but mixing it in a bowl worked much better.  This recipe was easier than I thought and I forgot how much fun it is to pop popcorn in a machine!

Delicious and addictive. I followed the recipe, but used more explicit ingredients from another recipe and cooked the caramel to 238 degrees and then poured over the popcorn. I used Orville's brand since it has so few duds when popped. This caramel corn makes a wonderful gift and kids and adults cannot seem to get enough!

This is such a hit! I make this for a holiday treat exchange I attend each year and everyone raves about it. I recommend using air popped popcorn rather than the microwave kind, it just tastes better. This will get eaten up fast!

**Caution** Highly Addictive!!!  Super easy to make and ohhhh sooooooo delicious! I followed the advice of many to cut the butter down to half a cup and used my stock pot to pop the corn and mix in the caramel (after removing un-popped kernels) which simplified the process and cut down on clean up.  I will make this again and again...might try adding nuts next time -- Yummy!!!

This is the BEST!  The thought of making caramel popcorn seemed intimidating, but this was actually quite easy.  I did cut the amount of butter in half, which worked just fine.  Also, I did bake this in a roasting pan lined with parchment paper, which made it easier to stir the popcorn and made cleanup a breeze.  I served this at a party, and it was a hit.  Thanks!

This is the same recipe my Mom and Grandmother have always used, except we use 6 qts of popcorn.  I always use airpopped popcorn because it pops up big and fluffy and tastes better. We boil the caramel for 5 mins instead of 4.  My Mom does the entire hour, but I like it after 45 mins.  Great to give away for the holidays (if there is any left!)

This was a great recipe to start with, but I tried some of the other reviewers suggestions. The first batch I just cut the butter in half. Then the sugar was too much, but still tasted good. The next day and batch #2 I cut the butter and sugar in half and left everything else the same, and we have the perfect caramel corn now. I did used my air popper to make the popcorn. Thank you!

VERY ADDICTING!  I only used 1 stick of butter as another reviewer suggested and it was perfect.  The only thing I will do different next time is I'll only bake it for 45 minutes instead of an hour.  Mine started to burn just a tiny bit when I let it go the full hour.

Golden!  Tried it at every 15 minute interval and it was best after the full hour in the oven.  I tossed the popcorn in a brown paper bag as I slowly drizzled syrup... blobs of syrup that fall will spread out if you shake it while it's still hot/soft.  I transfered it to a large lighty sprayed baking sheet and baked according to recipe.  I think this is the first time that I've had caramel popcorn without the popcorn being stale!  I'll be giving this away to my special friends during the holidays.

AMAZING!!!!!!!! It is sooooo good! Made this for the first time this weekend and it was perfect! I agree with everyone who said it is highly addictive. I used air-popped corn and put it in the oven for 45 mins., with 15 min. stirring intervals. Its is just SOOOOO good!

This is great.  What makes this is the brown sugar. Add those little red peanuts and this tastes alot like Cracker Jacks. Just remember to PICK OUT THE UNPOPPED KERNELS or you will break your teeth!   Very good 5 stars!

Great recipe.  Use pecans instead of peanuts.  Keep stirring the syrup and don't overcook it or it will be grainy.  Let it cool and it will harden up.

WoW is all I can say! It's great, I went by the recipe but the only brown sugar I had was dark brown, next time I'll use the light brown. I used one stick of butter and one of margarine and 3 bags of Pops Secret extra butter popcorn.

Love, love love this stuff! I used macadamia nuts and pecan halves because that is what I had on hand. I will surely make this again and again and maybe peanuts next time. THANKS!

This was a hit! I did experiment with the baking time. I left a little out after each 15 minute interval and let it cool.  I sampled each time and found that the best texture and flavor was after the 3rd 15 minute stir (45 minutes total bake time).  An hour is just a bit too long and made the sugar more granular.

This caramel corn is CLASSIC!!!  It is either as good or better than the stuff you get at the market or fair.  It is very sweet, but oooh so good!  It's definitely better the next day after everything get's a good chance to harden... so the corn isn't as soft and the sugar has hardened.  It's delicious... and so easy!  Try it for a party and mix with peanuts or m&m's and you won't be sorry!!  What a great hit for our family movie night!

This is by far the best Caramel Popcorn recipe I have come across yet. Made as written, with the addition of salted peanuts.  The caramel/popcorn ratio is perfect, as well as the baking temperature and time.  Love the fact that the caramel corn retains its crunchiness and does not go soggy.  We'll be having this quite often in our household.

This recipe is very tasty!  It's fast & easy!  My only recommendation would be to let the popcorn cool on waxed paper about 5 minutes after you take it out of the oven.  I've tried it both ways & felt it was much easier to get out of the baking dish when it's still flexible.

This is exactly like the popcorn my grandma used to make when I was little!! I have been searching for this recipe for a long time. I bake mine a little less for a more chewy texture.

I am famous after using this recipe among friends, and my kids always ask for it. My husband doesn't like popcorn, but he frequently has more than one bowl of this. I also use the microwaving it in doubled brown paper bags method.

Amazing. Incredible, scrumptious! I can't stop eating this stuff! I used my popcorn popper and 1 cup of seeds was a perfect amount. I baked it in my turkey roasting pan as one reviewer suggested and it worked great! awesome recipe, i will be making it again and again! Oh, and use the whole cup of butter, the real stuff!

This popcorn, contrary to the great reviews, was an absolute disaster! When i put the popcorn in the oven, it all sticked together and could not get it unstuck, the bottom burned and i was hightly dissapointed. It may have been my mistake so i gave it a 2. All i can say is make sure you mix the popcorn and caramel when the caramel is HOT!

This was delicious and easy. I had never made carmel corn before and I was worried, but it turned out great. I used a big disposable aluminum Pasta Pan from the grocery store to cook it in and that made it very easy to handle large servings.

First time caramel popcorn maker, and must say it was easier than I thought.  I made this recipe as gifts for Xmas.  I added pecans to the recipe which added another touch.  Next time I just might forgo the popcorn and just use the sauce with the pecans.
I was a little concerned with my first batch when the "sauce" didn't cover the popcorn before going into the oven, but the stirring every fifteen minutes made everything turn out well.

Super easy and super delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I popped two dutch ovens of popcorn on the stove.  I am not a fan of microwave popcorn....I lightly salted it.  My popcorn was warm so no problems stirring it.  I sprayed pam on two cookie sheets...mixed up half the popcorn in a large metal bowl and repeated on the second cookie sheet.  Very easy and great recipe.  I only  baked for 30 minutes as we like it a little soft.

Try HULLESS POPCORN IN BAGS...  about 1 1/2 bags works perfectly, and you don't get the centers of the popcorn that sometimes takes away from the yumminess of this treat - at least for me!  The hulless popcorn in bags is already pretty salty so I suggest to leave out the salt... you won't miss it!

This popcorn is GREAT!  The only popcorn I had available was Microwaveable Act II Butter Lovers.  I used 3 packages of it and cut the butter to 1/2 cup.  I thought this would compensate for the butter flavoring already in the popcorn and also give it a heavier coating.  (Each package of popcorn makes 1 quart)  I used a large pot knowing that when I added the baking soda it would foam up.  It sure did!  Because the pot was fairly heavy, there was no drizzling.  (I kept the popcorn warm in a roasting pan until it was time to add the mixture, as others suggested).  I dumped it on and mixed the best I could.   I used a silicone spatula and it worked wonderfully.  I set the timer at 15 minute intervals for mixing.  After 30 minutes, I took it from the roasting pan and spread it out on two cookie trays that were sprayed with "pam".  Then I baked them another 15 minutes.  I had to use a roasting pan first so I would have room for mixing.  It turned out really tasty.  My daughter-in-law stopped in and said it was better than what they buy on the boardwalk!

I made 2 batches. The first I followed the recipe exactly. The 2nd I just sprayed my baking sheets with a little nonstick spray to help with cleanup. Both ways turned out GREAT but will spray my pans when I make it again. Excellent! Tastes like Werther's candy melted on popcorn!!

I followed this recipe exactly - and it came out great!  Once it cooled I split it up in zip lock bags and gave some to my neighbors and family.  Everyone said it was the best they ever had.

Absolutely easy and delicious.  I used SmartBalance 50/50 and organic brown sugar.  I gave the caramel popcorn away as gifts and everyone enjoyed and asked for more.

I have a relative in my family who has made this same recipe for years. The only difference is she uses 8 quarts of popped corn. It is the best caramel corn I have ever had.

This is the best caramel popcorn I have EVER eaten.  It is buttery, crunchy and wickedly good.  I didnt have regular corn syrup, so I used light "Light Corn Syrup w/ Vanilla" and halved the vanilla in the recipe to make up the diff.  Dont worry if you start to pour the caramel and think you wont have enough.  You will!  I sort of flipped the popcorn instead of stirring to avoid braking it up.  I also bought popcorn kernals and cooked them on the stove.  Easy and cheap.

I have never made caramel popcorn before, so I wasn't sure what kind of results to expect.  I followed the directions exactly, then added 2 cups of pecans before baking in the oven.  I divided the popcorn/pecans between 2 foil turkey pans that were coated with nonstick spray.  I stirred every 10 minutes for an hour, then spread out into a single layer on my dinner table to cool.  The popcorn turned out absolutely perfect.  The pecans roasted nicely and have a wonderful praline taste and crunch to them.  I will most definitely be packaging these up and giving as gifts this Christmas!!

I have tried a few cadied popcorn recipes, and this one came out much bettern than the recipe where the caramel has to be boiled for 15 minutes!  By then it tasted burnt. I was skeptical at first about the 4 minute method, but this has great buttery flavor, and quite addictive.  But, I DID embellish this a bit, and improved upon perfection.   I got some cinnamon roasted almonds, and some maple flavored candied nut mix from a super "W" grocery store, and coarsely chopped them up and sprinkled them all over the caramel before I mixed it all up, and all I can say is it's like going to a state fair!  I will make this again.  And it's kid approved. My kid loved it.

This popcorn is INSANE!  I took it to a staff meeting of mine, and everyone went wild for it.  I like my caramel corn really chewy...so I only baked it for 20 minutes.  It was still chewy and a bit crunchy.  Thanks for sharing!

I gave myself 3rd degree burns, the caramel hardened right away almost and could not "thinly" pour it on.  Most of the popcorn did not get covered as a result.  i will do waht was suggested in the microwave.  Sounds safer.  It must be me but my hand is killing me!

Excellent recipe! This is the second time I have made it...the first time, it turned out grainy, as one review mentioned. After thinking about it, it turns out that I just dumped all of the caramel ingredients into the pan all at once (except for the vanilla). I think it's the baking soda that makes the difference.  Looks like when I put it in before boiling the caramel, the caramel corn ends up looking grainy (though believe me, it didn't stop us from eating it!) This time, I put it in as instructed by the recipe (hmm, maybe I should read it more closely!) The caramel corn came out completely non-grainy. The cost of the ingredients didn't seem to make a difference at all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some caramel corn to tend to...

Great.  Way more caramel than needed for 5 Qts of popcorn- more like 8 qts. Substituted honey for half of the corn syrup. Also, I boiled the sauce longer.  If you want a chewier result, cook only 30 min in oven, take out, form in balls if you want. It's stickier and chewier. I like both.

Wow!  This popcorn is awesome!!!  I only had one bag of popcorn on hand, so I divided the recipe into 3rds (and added some chopped pecans) but followed the recipe as is.  Very easy to make, and tastes way too good!!  Will definitely be making this again.

Awesome ... so easy and good.  I followed the advice os splitting the batch in half, putting it in the microwave for 30 seconds 3 times shaking it inbetween.  I cut the grocery bag in a T (up the front, and then on either side, so the corn can cool.  Jumble it up and put in an air tight bowl.  Soooo easy, and soooooo good!!

I've already made this twice since last week.  I seem to like it when it's cooked in then oven for 30-45 mintutes rather than an hour.  It doesn't have as strong of a flavor this way.

Also, we ate this while playing poker..... it was perfect!

Fantastic Caramel Corn recipe.  This is the 1st one I've tried and I have no reason to try any others.  There are not many recipes I've made that people actually fought over, but this one made that happen.  Make sure you have a very large bowl on hand for mixing the corn and syrup mix - it takes some room.  Also, per another review, I warmed the already popped corn in the oven prior to coating with the caramel.  It took 2 1/2 bags of microwave popcorn to get the 5 quarts called for in this recipe.  Finally, I toasted 1 cup of whole almonds and added that to the recipe.  This was great.  Thanks, Brian.

I have never felt one way or the other about carmel corn, but this is so good.  I have made this 3 times already.  I use 4 normal microwave bags of Orville R's popcorn.  I used this and Act II side by side and there is a big difference in fluffiness.  This is lightly crunchy on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside.  I followed the recipe exactly and WOW!

This is my 9 year old daughter's review as she made it almost by herself.  Very easy to make and very yummy.  I (my daughter) made some popcorn balls out of it and they tasted really good.  I can't wait to have this in my school lunch.  Thank you for the recipe.

This popcorn is great and tastes better as it gets colder! I added about 2 and 1/2 cups of dry roasted peanuts to the mix.  I added the popcorn into the roasting pan before I spread into the baking dishes, makes it much easier to spread.

Very good tasting caramel popcorn, beats any you can buy. I used 4 cheapo brand bags of microwave popcorn and followed the recipe exactly. Easy to make!  a great treat.

I took the advice of many of the reviewers; cut the butter in half and only baked the popcorn for about 1/2 hour (though I would only let it go for 45 minutes max if I were you!)

Cutting the butter in 1/2 makes the caramel a little harder to work with, but it thins out a little in the oven. Maybe try cutting the sugars down a bit if you use less butter.

Awesome, easy recipe!

Excellent!!!  It rivals some of the best fudge/candy shops on Mackinac Island, Michigan.  I only bake it 30 min. stirring every 10 minutes.  I find that if I bake it 60 minutes it becomes grainy.

Thank you for this recipe!  My son exclaimed that it "tastes better than the store kind, Mom!!"  My Dad who has acquired a sweet tooth from chemo treatment especially enjoyed this treat.  Thank, you again.  It means more than you know...

Good flavor & success! Much thanks to those reviewers who suggested the foil lined pans with cooking spray, (clean up was easy!) and that the amount of butter could be lessened.

Very messy and not great tasting....It may have been the cook, but I found that the mixture got really foamy and tasted bitter, then turned into hard chunks of sugar throughout the popcorn.

This is awesome and so easy.  I have already made this recipe about 5 times in the last month/month and a half.  I bring the ingredients with me and make it at family and friends' homes.  

I use 2 bags of the light/low fat microwave kettle corn- delicious!

My husband wanted something sweet and I didn't have much on hand. I called up caramel popcorn recipes thinking I would have the things for that. Happily, I did and made this very easy recipe. It was very yummy and though it made a lot, I don't think it will last long and I'll be making more soon! This had perfect flavor and crunch, at least as good as the best fair carmel corn! I followed the recipe exactly, thank you!

I've made this twice already this week. The first time I forgot the baking soda (it still came out fine). The second time, I can see the difference the baking soda made! Great recipe; I'm not buying caramel popcorn anymore! Thanks for sharing!

I make this every year for my daughter's middle school teachers as Christmas gifts. They LOVE it, as does my family.  One teacher wanted to ORDER some from me last year!  :+)  I add a cup of almonds and a cup of pecans to each batch.  My secret ingredient is the popcorn; my husband's cousins grow popcorn on their farm for Weaver (Boy Scouts) and Orville Redenbacher.  We use popcorn straight from the field, which tends to pop larger than store bought.  You may want to consider trying gourmet popcorn with this recipe, if your results aren't as expected. It really makes the difference.

I made this and the entire family gobbled it up.  Next time I may add peanuts to the recipe.  One tip to add: line your baking sheets with wax paper for easy clean up.

Funny thing, I forgot the soda and vanilla, and it still tasted great!   It's light and crispy, not heavy and chewy. My family and friends thought it was amazing!

I made this today and it turned out so good!  I added a little almond extract to it.  Maybe next time adding  amaretto instead of the vanilla and almond (for adults of course) may be a nice experiment!  thanks so much for a great treat!

My and my mother flipped over this recipe!  There is a local popcorn store in one of my city's malls that sells wonderful carmel corn, cheese corn, etc, but they can't touch this recipe!  This is FANTASTIC.

This is one of my signature desserts! I pop my own kernels on the stove in oil. Important to have a BIG bowl to stir the caramel into the popcorn. Watch the oven temp when you bake and keep stirring to not burn the sugar. I did that the first few times. I sprinkle course salt while it's still sticky. Sweet and salty!

This recipe is amazing. I made this as a fun snack at my three year-olds birthday party and it was a huge hit. Everyone was amazed when I told them the pop corn was home-made and not store bought and they all wanted the recipe. I love this recipe so much that I now give out little gift boxes of it at Christmas time.

It's very easy to make, it's wonderfully addictive, kids go crazy over it, and adults can't get enough of it. 

Great recipe.

Even though I made some changes, I must say this was good.  I didn't have regular corn syrup so I used King Syrup.  I also did not bake it.  I will try it with regular corn syrup and bake it next time, just to see if it can be better.

This was great.  I made it for my son's 11 birthday sleep over.  It was a huge hit.  This caramel corn reminded me of when I was a girl, there was a popcorn shop in the mall we used to frequent.  It brought back so many childhood memories.  I will be making this again.

turned out great make sure you let boil for at least 4 min(i did mine a little longer) or it will be gooey. added honey roasted peanuts and cashews to half the batch and dry roasted peanuts to the other half and it was great. Couldnt stay out of it, will definatly make it again.

Yummy yummy! This is a great tasting recipe. I added peanuts to the popcorn and then added the caramel sauce. The peanuts did not burn while in the oven for the hour. I will definitely be making this one again:)

Very tasty and although a bit messy, overall very easy. I always half the recipe though otherwise I eat too much of it! I find it tastes best within the first couple of days, if it lasts that long!

This is so good!  My daughter and I made this last night and we both agreed it was a mighty dangerous treat to have around the house.  Nonetheless, when the urge for good caramel popcorn hits us, this is the recipe we'll use.

This turned out great!  My husband complained about all the dishes, but then one hour later asked me if I used sugar or "crack" as the flavoring.  He had eaten 1/2 the bowl!  Definitely take the time to bake in the oven.  It makes the sugar coating nice and crunchy.

Purely addictive and unbelievably easy. The only issue I had was getting all the caramel mixed in without burning my fingers. Made 2 batches in one day and watched it disappear as gifts and as company enjoyed it. Waaay good!

So good. I used a tip from another recipe to mix the carmel and popcorn in a paper bag sprayed with Pam - no clean up! Also I added broken pretzles! Only need to use 1/2 cup butter. Nothing missed at all.

This caramel popcorn is awesome!  I've made several batches and I need to make more!  I have a son who is allergic to peanuts so we can't have CrackerJacks.  I was craving a replacement and found this recipe - it's sooo much better than CrackerJacks!  I'll make this again and again.

I knew it was going to be good based on the reviews. But, I didn't expect such a PERFECT buttery, caramelized, crunchy glaze! This is soooo much better than store bought.
I followed the advice of others and kept my popped corn heated in my big blue broiler (lined with wax paper) while the caramel cooked. I placed nuts in my caramel after I finished cooking, then drizzled. I only stirred the corn 2 times and couldn't take it anymore.... we had to try it. We poured it onto waxed paper and let cool for only 30 minutes. Great!

When I think of Caramel Popcorn I think of popcorn that's gooey and sticky.  This recipe is okay if you like Cracker Jacks, but I wasn't looking for that kind of Caramel Popcorn.  If you like Cracker Jacks, this is the perfect recipe though.

I baked just as explained in the directions - the corn tastes a little burned.  Next time I will try baking at 200 degrees.  No worries though - I will probably still eat it :)

I made the mistake of making a double batch . I dont recommend that , it was too hard to work with . I too had a problem with graininess , since this is much like candies when overcooked next time I will try a slightly shorter cook time . But it tastes great ! My problems are probably my own fault so I will definately try again

Very easy recipe!  My family loved it.  I thought it was too sweet and that's a good thing, since between my daughter and mother... it was inhaled. I loved the fact that I didn't need a thermometer.

We baked half the batch and just let the other half to cool. The baked half was crunchy and the unbaked half was chewy and tacky.
Great recipe!!!!!

THE BEST!!  I have been making this for years and tried many more but this is THE BEST.
In response to donnap123 above, I use white syrup and it is light and great. If you are sending it to your son, cool it and put it in zip lock bags and it will ship great. It stores well. He will love the treat. Tell him we appreciate his serving and keep them in our prayers.

I loved the popcorn! But, I had a hard time with the recipe.  First it stuck to the baking sheets I used when I put it in the oven when some of the caramel melted off, second I used microwave popcorn and the unpopped kernals were no fun to remove. But other than that it was delicious.

Loved it! turned out great, I halfed this recipe and cut cooking time in the oven to 30mins and it was still crunchy, remember cooks: this is similar to making toffee or brittle so make it on a clear day if you want it to turn out right!

Absolutely the best!!!  I used a big foil roasting pan like another person did in the oven and it turned out great!  I have allergies to nuts, eggs etc and it is so nice to have caramel popcorn again that I know is safe to eat!!  The only problem with it is it is very hard to stay out of it once you start eating it!!!!

This was so easy and yummy! After reading other reviews I only used 1 cube of butter.  I used two bags of microwave popcorn, one Low Fat and one Butter Lover's.  I added peanuts to the half that I baked for a crispier taste and half I left unbaked for the chewy fans.
Thanks for sharing!

I would give this one 10 stars if I could. I made 2 batches of this-one with nuts and one without-to take to work.  Everybody raved about it!  It's absolutely awesome-there's enough coating so all of the popcorn is actually coated.  I forgot the baking soda and the vanilla in the second batch, and it was still great!

I have made this many times.  My recipe calls for 1 teaspoon baking soda and the oven temp @ 200 degrees.  I think that would make a difference in the "burnt" taste if you turn it down to 200.

I don't know what the heck I did wrong but I thought the caramel topping had a very weird taste to it.
My husband tried it and he said it didn't taste weird to him but he doesnt' like caramel corn.

My daughter had a friend over and she and her friend said it was good but too sweet.  My son didnt' like it but he doesn't like caramel corn either anyways.

it surely must be something I did - I did use margarine instead of butter but then I've seen recipes that are quite similar that say use butter or margarine so...I don't know.

I'm tempted to try making it again as I love caramel corn and really was excited to try it!

Okay addendum - the next day it tasted good!  Go figure!

I made this last night and unwittingly did everything I could to mess it up.  I added the vanilla and baking soda at the wrong time and I overcooked it on the stove (my mom and I thought it had a slight burnt sugar taste).  Even with only 30 minutes in the oven (had to make room for dinner) it still turned out very tasty.  Even my fussy dad enjoyed it!  Thanks!

Wonderful! I did make some variations based on other members feedback. I kept evrything the same except I only used 2 bags of natural popcorn. It was sooo great! it coated so well. I also used an disposable aluminum roasting pan, there was no mess afterwards! A must have recipe!

Wow.  This was amazing and oh so addicting!!  We cut the recipe in half - which I highly recommend if you don't plan to feed an army! - and didn't add the salt to cut down on sodium.  Cooking time was 45 minutes for us.  The only problem:  Not having enough willpower to stop eating all the kernals!  What a great recipe; I'll be making this again.

This popcorn is addictive!  I made a half batch and cooked it in two pans at the same time side by side in the oven.  I had used a deep lasagna pan and a regular 9 x 13 cake pan.  I had a hard time turning the popcorn in the 9 x 13 pan, much easier in the deeper lasagna pan.    I lined both pans with aluminum foil and sprayed them with butter flavor pam as well.

This is so good!  I used yellow kernels and popped them in the air-popper, just one batch, and then followed the recipe, a little less salt and baked around 50 minutes or so.  It was as close to Garrett's as I've ever come - and I've been trying for three years!  Seemed to help when I stirred quickly instead of carefully at the 15 minute intervals since the caramel hardens quickly.

Absolutely amazing recipe!!  Everyone in my family loved this.  I even got a compliment from my very hard to please father-in-law on this one.  I couldn't believe how easy this was; the only hard part was cleaning the saucepan after making the sauce.  For those of you who are wondering if it's worth the effort to make caramel corn from scratch, let me assure you, it definitely is.  This is something anyone would love to receive as a Christmas gift.  A keeper for me.

This recipe has a nice balance of sweet / salty flavor.  I used a natural flavor butter popcorn and unsalted butter due to the saltiness of the popcorn.  I halved the recipe and baked the popcorn mixture at 250 in a lightly greased 13 x 9 metal baking pan (as per the recipe), turning every 15 minutes for 45 minutes, as the popcorn mixture did not need a full hour to bake.  I believe next time I make this recipe, I will mix macadamia nuts with the popcorn before adding the caramel mixture to compliment the butter flavor.

Excellent. Nice buttery flavor. Saved me a trip to the mall to get caramel popcorn :).

One big mistake I did was using waxed paper. When the popcorns cooled it got stuck to the paper and I could not separate the paper from the pan without ripping it. I had to put it back into the oven to melt it so I could put it into a bowl to cool.

This is great caramel corn! I forgot to put in the vanilla and soda, but I don't think it made any difference because it still tasted wonderful. I had no problem with clean-up when I simply lined the pans with regular tin foil. I can't wait to serve this at holiday parties!

If a teen guy can make this, and have 20 other teens enjoy it at a party, then ANYBODY can make and enjoy this.  The recipe is perfect; as long as you apply the caramel evenly on the popcorn, you should be all set!

Awesome caramel corn!!! I baked half of it in a 9x13 glass pan and the other half on a cookie sheet. The caramel popcorn in the glass pan turned out chewy and the popcorn on the cookie sheet turned out light and crispy - both were scrumptious!!! I also only baked mine for 30 min. and it was perfect.

Yum!  this was great!  i used two 3 oz bags of microwave butter flavored popcorn, left out the salt and poured it into a deep large pan which was lined with foil and sprayed with pam.  Easy cleanup!  My brother in law consideres himself a conniseur (sp?) of carmel popcorn and demanded to have this recipe!  I put some in small clear gift bags as Christmas gifts in a basket that included Amish White bread (on this recipe site) and homemade hot chocolate mix (also found on this site)  The basket was very well received!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This is fun and easy to make.  Did everything as directed and it came out ok except that it cooked too long and has a burnt taste and the kids won't eat it.  I would cut cooking time next time to about 45 minutes.  I will try again.

My mom has made this recipe for years with one change.  Her recipe calls for 1 tsp. butter flavoring added with the baking soda instead of vanilla.  It sounds weird but makes it very buttery-tasting!

So good!!!!!  I took this out to our church camp and it was the first thing to go!  I used to make this a long time ago and lost the recipe.  I'm so glad to have found it again.  Thanks Brian!  One note: go through your popcorn carefully picking out all the kernals before coating it.

Half of the recipe and 1 bag microwave popcorn worked great but watch the temp during the 4 min. boil time ... mine burned a bit but I carefully poured what wasn't burned over the popcorn and carried on. Nice and crisp but a little dark (my fault). Use Pam on foil on a cookie sheet for the oven part. Be sure to separate the cooked popcorn from the uncooked kernels before you add the caramel. NO chipped teeth for us! Also I wouldn't add any more salt if the popcorn already tastes salty. This recipe is easy and hubby is happily crunching away!

Absolutely awesome!!  I messed around with the recipe @ the reviews...3 bags of popcorn, etc, trying to do more at a time. I found it was best done with 2 bags of popcorn and just as written...awesome!  FYI...3 bags/standard caramel, coverage too light; 4 bags with double caramel, too much caramel (puddles).  I baked 1 1/2 hrs and still had puddles, but it was absolutely delicious...actually better than the standard recipe.

This was very easy to make and the caramel was better than anything I've ever tasted from the store.  Two bags of microwave popcorn work out perfectly for the amount of caramel.  So worth the effort!

I made this for our New Years Eve party last night and was the first munchie to go.  I cheated and used two bags of micro popcorn and cooked my syrup in the microwave too.  It came out great!  I was out of foil, so I just sprayed my pans with Pam and didn't have any problems with it.  I added a can of mixed nuts too. Yummy!

OMG -- it's been in the oven now for 15 mins and I did the first stir.  If it tastes this great now, wow, I wonder how good it will be in 45 minutes.  This is the BEST!!  (I added peanuts)

Erg...ummmmm.  (Those are eating noises, by the way.)  Very good!  It has that true caramel taste to it, not oversweet like so many packaged popcorns (which isn't to say you'll like this if you don't have a sweet tooth; it IS still sweet).  It destroys pans though, I will try parchment next time I guess.

Excellent. I made this for Christmas presents and it was a big hit. It hardened perfectly. Because corn syrup is expensive in NZ I used golden syrup instead (for those of us down under).

I was worried baking it so long would burn it, but it came out beautifully, crunchy & sweet.  Will be making again!
The recipe instructs you to stir a few times during baking--don't be tempted to skip that.  The stirring helps avoid clumps of caramel.  On the other hand, clumps of caramel is not necessarily a bad thing.

first recipe eating ever :) it was that good. made these as xmas gifts this year and they were a hit! ended up making 60 mason jars of these ??

tweaks: 
- used 3/4 cup of butter (if not adding nuts just use half cup)
- added cups of walnuts, peanuts and almonds 

regarding portions: for popcorn, I used 3 bags of microwaveable act II butter popcorn, which yields about 8 (give or take half a jar) 32oz mason jars worth.

This was my very first attempt at making caramel popcorn. It turned out great. I kept the popcorn warm before mixing in the caramel and only used one stick of butter. The flavor is amazing but I can’t help but wonder if it would’ve been easier to mix had I used the amount of butter called for in the recipe. Regardless...still delicious! Will definitely make this again.

I used the 1/2 pound of butter method and it came out great. About 50 minutes in my oven in a big wok, and then spread on baking sheets to cool. It broke up nicely and fit in a big copper cookie tin. My wife was impressed with thia and I appreciate all the good instructions and great reviews with tips! Thank you!

I’ve made this caramel corn a dozen times for get togethers or movie nights and there are never any leftovers. Two modifications I always do is to warm popcorn in a casserole dish in the oven while preparing the caramel mixture. The other one is to add 1 cup of honey roasted peanuts or salted almonds for extra crunch.

I have made this recipe six times now, and we just eat it all up.  Very good, crunchy, and keeps in our cookie jar. We just grab a bowl full and head over to the sofa and watch our tv programs. Makes an excellent snack. I have never used any other recipes, but with one like this, I don’t need to. TRY IT once-you’ll be hooked just like us.

I tried this recipe a year ago have been making it regularly at least twice a month since! It's the BEST caramel popcorn I have ever tasted. Everyone who tries it becomes instantly addicted. I make it so much because everyone is constantly asking for more. I've give it away at holiday parties and just as regular (and often pleaded for) gift to a few entire floors of hard working nurses at the hospital where my husband works. The only changes I've ever made are to cut down the butter to 1 and a half sticks. There is really no noticeable difference in taste or texture by doing this - I do it when I'm low on butter/margarine and just make do with what I have. Oh and sometimes I add pecans, peanuts, almonds, cashews.. etc, any type of nut is delicious with this! To anyone who says their popcorn came out of the oven burnt I suggest you check that your oven is running at the right temperature. I had my oven calibrated and use a separate temperature gauge inside and it runs at the display temperature. At 250 degrees F for an hour with stirring every 15 minutes I've never had a burning issue. You must make sure to mix up all the popcorn that is at the bottom of the pan. I don't use two pans - I use one giant roaster. I use a stove top Whirley Pop to make the popcorn and exactly two full pots of popcorn (1/2c of kernals for each popping so 1c of kernals per batch of this caramel corn ) makes the *perfect* amount of popcorn. This stores in an airtight container very well for a few days

I love, love this recipe. It was easy to make and taste really good with homemade popcorn because it is not already buttered. I added a half cup of slivered almond for my own personal taste.

I made this popcorn for friends and coworkers last year for christmas and it was a huge hit! I had several requests for it this year. I bought an inexpensive air popper just for this recipie. I think the air popped corn makes it even better! I put parchment paper under the corn in the oven for an eisier cleanup.

This was fantastic! I just used Kirkland popcorn from the bag, and I also did use 1/2 cup of butter. I also added all the ingredients at once in the saucepan which worked out fine.  I cooked it for about 23 minutes and stirred about every two minutes. This resulted in a chewy/crunchy delicious result! I highly recommend this recipe!

Magically Delicious! I've been making this popcorn for a few years now.  I tend to add nuts if I have them on hand (peanuts, walnuts, etc.) I always bake this recipe in a large rectangular disposable alunimum baking pan I get at Costco/Sams Club. This recipe is also great for gift giving.  Just separate into smaller portions and package in a plastic bag, mason jar or decorative tin for a homemade treat.

I love this recipe! If you're in a pinch for time, omit the baking soday and vanilla and don't bother to make it. The result is gooier, but it will be devoured either way.  i recommend adding crushed pretzels...

MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THE UNPOPPED KERNELS...

Loved IT!!!! This recipe makes a gallon Ziplock bag and it will not last. I was so scared to make caramel corn but not anymore. My only change was I only used 1/2 cup butter. I also used 1/2 cup unpopped corn as suggested by other reviews. The caramel covered all the popcorn perfectly. My suggestion is to check your caramel corn after every 15 minutes to see how crunchy it is. I found after half an hour that it was cooked perfect.... I also used a large roasting pan and keep the popcorn in the oven to keep warm and found that I had no problem mixing it with the sauce. I also suggest spraying the final cookie sheet with a cooking spray to avoid sticking.... Will be making this recipe over and over again.

I am NOT a cook.  This is the first recipe review I've ever written and the first time I've made caramel corn.  Wow.  Can't stop eating this!  I only used 1/2 the butter and it still tastes so buttery and both my husband and his friend loved it too.  Now I need to get to the store and find tins to make this for everyone for Christmas.  Yeah!  I get to give homemade yummies to everyone this year!!!  :-)

Awesome awesome awesome. I made this to send overseas to my husband and his fellow Marines. He said it still kept after bouncing around in a box for over a week and was gone in 5 minutes. Everyone is requesting more! I popped the corn in a small dutch oven and used a tablespoon of coconut oil in place of veggie, canola, etc. It gave it just the smallest hint of nuttiness underneath all the sweet goodness.

Absolutely one of my favorite recipes! I add about 3T cinnamon when I stir in the baking soda and vanilla and the flavor reminds me of those "Christmas almonds" out at the mall. I also use disposable foil pans and I have found that 3 to 4 bags of ANY microwave popcorn is just as good as kettle popped or air popped corn. Coworkers think I'm a wizard!

I have made this recipe many times, and it is fantastic as written. If you like nuts, you can add your favorite (our family likes cocktail peanuts). To really put it "over the top," I mix a cup of white chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon coconut oil, in a Ziplock bag, melt very carefully in the microwave, cut the corner off, and drizzle over caramel corn, after its final round in the oven. Let it cool until the chocolate "sets," then break it into pieces. If you have added nuts, try to stir them to the top as much as possible, and the drizzling of chocolate will also help them "stick" to the caramel corn better. I have also tried milk chocolate...don't care much for it...haven't yet tried semi-sweet, or butterscotch. The white chocolate complements the caramel corn favors best. It does make it sweeter, but it sure is GOOD! Happy cooking/baking! :)

I made this for my family's Thanksgiving.  I also made kettle corn and cookies and so on and so forth.  The Caramel Popcorn was gone SO fast!  It was a great munchie before dinner and a great desert snack instead of eating heavy pieces of pie after dinner.  
The timing I used was a little different.  I boiled on med-low heat, stirring constantly.  
I was also taught a different method to tell how it's done.  Have a bowl of cold water ready next to you at the stove and drizzle a little caramel in the cold water.  If it sinks and is still soft, keep boiling (and stirring constantly.)  If its instantly hard (not "kinda" hard) and floats, you're done!  
I also tried this with and without the baking soda and I liked it a LOT more without the baking soda.  Much better color and consistency without it.

Great recipe!  My husband and I love it after only 15 minutes of baking in oven. Added 1 cup of peanuts to caramel mixture before drizzling onto to popcorn.  My husband was so impressed we could make our own caramel popcorn!

This is the best recipe for Carmel popcorn ever!  I prefer to call it Toffee Popcorn because of the creamy buttery texture and flavor. I add peanuts to the mix which adds another level of goodness. 
I find that a large roasting pan works best. Make sure you stir frequently so that the Carmel coats evenly over all the popcorn. 
I usually break my popcorn up by just shaking the pan as soon as it comes out of the oven as it cools quickly.  I prefer smaller individual pieces as it is easier to eat and package as gifts.  This recipe will keep for weeks if stored in a sealed container or zip lock baggies.

Awesome recipe!  Actually made this into popcorn balls the other day (melted a little marshmellow & rolled balls over to help stick together)... got my Garrett's popcorn fix in the mail yesterday & gotta say: I might like this a smidge better!?!  The extra buttery flavoring is astounding!

This is the best caramel popcorn recipe I've found. This is the only recipe I use and have used it for years. I usually halve the recipe and bake in a roasting pan. The roasting pan gives plenty of room to stir without making a mess and does not take a full hour to get the desired texture.

This recipe turned out well using microwave popcorn (3 bags), although I thought the popcorn became rather hard after cooling.  I would suggest breaking into large chunks of popcorn before it settles and totally cools off.  Quite a bit of popcorn stuck to the bottom of the pan and didn't break up well.  I used 2 shallow glass pans ( 9 x 13) and cooked at 250 degrees for the total time suggested and stirred about 4 times.  I did work hard to get all of the kernels coated by stirring, turning large sections over etc. and scraping the bottom of pans to not waste the sticky goodness.  Turned out really great.  Lowering cooking time (as others suggested) may help the hardening and sticking to the pan and to break apart better.

Excellent, easy recipe!  Makes the perfect sweet, crunchy, flavorful snack.  I followed exactly and it came out perfect.  As it baked in the oven, the caramel kept getting crunchier and crunchier.

This was great!  I used half the butter called for in the recipe and ended up popping more popcorn.  I wanted the popcorn to be in individual pieces, so I didn't completely coat the popcorn with the syrup (thus the additional need for more popcorn to be popped).  I didn't have to break it apart....and there was plenty of flavor without the popcorn being 100% coated.   Placed a portion of the popcorn in a large stockpot (sprayed with cooking spray), drizzled syrup, stirred.  Then added more popcorn, drizzled syrup, stirred, repeating until all popcorn was used.  This made for easy distribution of the syrup.  Baked for 45 mins in pans lined with baking paper for easy clean up. Thank you for this recipe!  Move over Cracker Jacks! :-)

I made this this afternoon with 1 cup of air popped popcorn that was several days old (stored in air tight container).  It came out very well - my daughter loves it, and she will be taking some of it to school during the week for snack.  I tried half the popcorn warmed up and half the popcorn cold to see if it made a difference, but I had no issue either way.

I don't have a microwave because it broke down a few years ago, but cooking isn't harder at all. To me it's fun because I take the long way and i love cooking. So instead of microwaveable popcorn, I use an air popper and I think it makes all popcorn taste more natural and fresh. So I can't wait to do this again (: Since i use a air popper for popcorn i can only put in a certain amount of kernels (1/2 cup) and instead of 5 quarts this recipe only made 1 1/2 cups of popcorn, but then again it really turns out to be A LOT! with only 1 batch i filled a full container (my second biggest one). But, it's a good thing it made so much because the next party i need to bring something to eat, i know a super delicious, and easy recipe (:

Great snack! Made this for our movie night. The hardest part is waiting for it to be done because the house smelled so good. My caramel came out a little lighter than I wanted but I guess I didn't crank up the heat high enough. It was still awesome though. I added a mixture of chex mix that needed to be used up (accidently bought the low-sodium ones). I do like the chex mix but not with the darker chex. Maybe next time I will go to winco and pick out my own mix such as white rice chex, peanuts (by request), etc., and probably throw in some m&m's after being cooled.

I love love love this recipe!
I had no issues with mixing the popcorn like others have stated. I found it pretty easy and quick. I know this might not be the healthiest snack but I would not recommend cooking or baking anything in the microwave unless it's jut to make the popcorn.

My go-to caramel popcorn recipe! 1/2 this recipe makes enough for 2 bags of popped microwave popcorn. Even works with dark corn syrup. 
If I'm just making a little to eat during a movie, I don't bother baking it. If you want a harder crunch, you can crank up the heat and bake it at 350 for 30 minutes or less (stir closer to every 5 minutes). I prefer the tender crunch of the 250 deg./1 hr plan if I'm not in a hurry.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for! I did not change a thing. I agree with other commenters though - it is easier to coat the popcorn if it is hot and you really can tell the difference when you use cheap brown sugar.

delicious but warning- the sugar syrup is VERY hot... be careful when pouring it over the popcorn!
Also make sure to use a very large bowl (or do 2 batches) when mixing the popcorn and syrup, as it will make a big mess and be difficult to coat evenly.

LOVE this recipe.  For an added holiday twist, I added candy corn after baking.  My kids loved it!

Oh my gosh!  This recipe is sooo good.  I didn't bake it in the oven so the caramel popcorn was chewy.  A perfect combination of buttery, sweet, and salty.  Adding it to my fall baking list!

Awesome recipe! I popped a cup of kernels in an air popper. (1/2 cup at a time) I used the method with the roaster and added peanuts.  I baked for the full hour with tossing it around every 15 minutes.

Incredible recipe! I make this everytime we have company or are visiting family & friends and am usually asked to bring larger portions on the next visit.
Definitely best with nuts. My fav is a mix of cashews and slivered almonds.
Time consuming but worth the effort.

This recipe is the best I've used so far! Only thing I changed is the corn syrup which I replace with a sugar+water mix.  Other than that I love it and my husband can't stop eating popcorn!

AWESOME!!! If you love(or even like) caramel you have to try this! At my house half a batch is gone in 24hrs at most....that's 3 ppl eating it. I usually half the popcorn and keep the caramel the same and it turns out wonderfully every time and very caramelly and crunchy. Other than that don't change anything! 5 stars all the way

What a treat! I used the review suggestions. Used 2 bags Microwave popcorn, cut the butter to 1/2 cup. Microwaved the ingredients adding the baking soda last. Put popcorn and carmel mixture in paperbag, shake it up. Then Microwave for 30 seconds and shake again.

Wonderful, simple recipe-- I took off one star because adding the caramel to WARM popcorn is key and not mentioned except by other reviewers. Luckily, I used a large turkey roaster and had enough left over for a 9 x 13 baking dish. The popcorn in the baking dish cooled quickly and was virtually unmixable-- while the turkey roaster held more heat and blended up like a charm. I find the result comparable to fresh fair or farmer's market caramel corn-- much better than anything store bought!

I just got a Presto popcorn maker and some gourmet "High Mountain Midnight" popcorn kernels from Fireworks popcorn and wanted to try caramel corn.  I didn't want to make a thick coating of caramel so I halved the recipe, AND then halved the butter, so that I used 1/4 cup butter. Didn't have corn syrup, so substituted with Lyles Golden syrup.  I popped the popcorn & set aside.  Made the syrup. Discarded unpopped kernels.  Put 1/2 of popcorn into brown paper bag, drizzled 1/2 of syrup over it and shook it around.  Closed the bag and microwaved 30 seconds on High.  Shook it around again and poured into large bowl to cool.  Then I put the syrup back on the heat to melt and repeated the steps again with the rest of the popcorn.  Very easy via microwave instead of baking for an hour, and easy to clean up! Thanks to everyone who gave helpful hints!

This recipe is delicious.  The baking time in the oven is just to harden the caramel.  The softer/chewier you want the caramel, the less time you bake it for.  Definitely spray your bowl before you add the caramel to your popcorn, it will save you a lot of time cleaning.  Also, spray your cookie sheets.  I will make this again to hand out to friends as part of my Christmas goodies tray...

Totally delicious. I mean, what caramel popcorn isn't?!  My problem was I don't have a bowl big enough for all that popcorn. So, just make sure you're using the biggest of everything! Some of mine didn't cover b/c I had to separate the popcorn into 2 containers. FYI.

I love this recipe and it is very quick and easy. I basically put the popcorn in 2 large bowls and then mix and stir them together eventually. I don't do the oven part and it still turns out great.

Easy and so yummy!  I made this for the 2nd time in two weeks!   It is really a great recipe!  My only change to the recipe was to use a bit more popcorn, probably a quart and a half more, because I needed more for a bake sale.  I didn't increase the caramel part, and it was still very coated and yummy.

This is better than what you buy in stores.. it is right up there with gourmet caramel popcorn!  I will never buy it again after finding this recipe!  I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed ingredients, temperatures, and times exactly.  I did heat up the popcorn in the pan I baked it in so that it was warm when I poured the sauce over it and then stirred it right in the pan so there was less clean-up.  love Love LOVE this recipe!!!

The kids had a blast making this recipe with us and it was great. I'm not a fan of caramel popcorn myself, but this was really good. My daughter is alergic to peauts but I bet it would be great with peanuts in it. Thank you for the recipe.

I cooked it at 300 degrees for 35 min at 15 min i took it out and stirred then put back in for 20 more min. when i took it out at the end the caramel on the bottom was burned so some of the popcorn is bitter.

This was very easy to make and delicious. My boyfriend even said that it made him rethink his stance on caramel popcorn (which used to be unfavorable). I actually made the caramel sauce as directed, but I coated the popcorn in the microwave because the oven was already in use.

This is Grandma's recipe.  Variation:  For chocolate caramel corn, add in 3 TBLS. Cocoa to the pan.  It's delicious and cuts the sweetness a little.  Enjoy!

I've already made this recipe twice. It is so good. The second time I added peanuts and everyone loved it! This is the ultimate go-to caramel popcorn recipe.

I have tried other recipes and this one is the best, my trick is ( along with the biggest turkey roasting pan I could find ) I put a large piece of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan. I have to hold that paper in place while mixing but that is super easy to do. I also stir much more often than the recipe calls for. About every 10 min. This ensures an even coating. Tastes great. And yes, like most others have said, you will make more. Promise!

Alabama college girls approve!  My daughter shared with her roommates and within 15 minutes, they were calling me for the recipe.  I have shared this website with so many, and you ALWAYS make me shine.  I will add peanuts, next time.

This recipe is great. The perfect amount of sweet, tastes so much better then from the store. I put it in the oven in a jelly roll pan on a piece of parchment paper and had no problems with anything sticking.

I revised the recipe a little, instead of butter I used 1cup of margarine. Once baked if you leave caramel popcorn to cool for a few hours it tastes even better. MY family and friends loved it!

This was way better than I ever imagined :) Love it! I've been dreaming of a caramel popcorn since I first tasted some in Garretts popcorn shop in NYC in 2008. Thought about ordering a batch on the internet a few times but found a bit expensive so after much consideration I decided to try making my own.   Where as I don't live in the US, I didn't find corn syrup in the store so I bought Lyle's golden syrup but I don't think that it made a difference. It is just as good as Garrett's caramel popcorn, if not better if it's possible ;)

made this last night and - wow!!  very good but a little too sweet for me - will lessen the sugar and butter a bit cause i don't think i made enough popcorn for it cause it was thick -   but was wondering if anyone has made this with the splenda brown sugar. my mom's a diabetic and i want her to try this , it will also cut down calories severly  but great recipe- thanks for sharing

Another fantastic win with this recipe at a party last night. Not a single person that has tried this has said anything other than "yum" and gone back for 5ths, 6ths and 7ths. Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful receipe! Now if I could just avoid eating so much of it... :)

Easy gourmet popcorn.  I followed another reviewer by having my oven at 300F and stirring it every 10 minuted for only 20 minutes.  Fast and delicious!

Update: I made this two more times and now it always come out grainy, not sure why.  The only difference is that I'm using safeway brown sugar now and before it was walmart brown sugar.  I'll try one more batch using walmart brand and see if sugar is the reason, I haven't changed anything else.

I love this recipe, but I've always changed it a bit and haven't put it in the oven. Instead, around the time the caramel starts to boil, I begin popping the popcorn in the air popper. Once the caramel has boiled for it's 4 minutes, I take it off the heat and add the baking soda and vanilla. After stirring it, I place it back on the heat until the caramel has gotten a bit fluffy. Then I pour it onto the popcorn, and stir it all in.

My friends loved this carmel corn!! I made it for the season opener party (Red Sox vs Yankees) so we could have "cracker jacks" they said it was even more delicious than that! I would recommend taking out all the unpopped kernals before starting (even the semi-popped ones). And if you can choose popcorn that pops fully that is best.

This was one of the first things to sell out at a bake sale. My husband said he could make himself sick off of this. I used a trash can to mix everything up. It was clean, I promise. I didn't have any bowls big enough to hold all the popcorn. The trash can was the perfect size.

This recipe is god sent, I have been craving for caramel popcorn but have been wanting to make it myself. It was simple and easy to make, and I made dinner while baking it.    I did cut down the recipe since I only had 1/2 pound of butter left and I measured out 10 cups of popcorn with my pyrex measuring cup.    I air popped my popcorn and greased everything that was going to be used in this process (with the melted butter) excluding the mixing bowl, wasn't too bad to clean up.    I did bake it for the full hour and when it was cooling I mixed it constantly until it was hard to the touch, that way my kernels were separate. Now I just have to stop eating it!

oh my goodness! LOVE this stuff! We popped our own popcorn on the stove and used 1/2 c butter instead of  1 c. I also took the suggestion of using a roasting pan and that worked great. Thanks for a wonderful new recipe!

Great recipe.  I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn and added a couple cups of nuts.  line the oven pans with parchment.  The candy does not stick to the parchment, also if using a dark pan the white parchment keeps the candy from burning (not to mention making clean-up a breeze).

When I make this, I actually don't put it in the oven. I just pour it straight over freshly popped corn and it hardens up nicely, very quick. It's delicious and no fail. Love it!

This is so delicious that I made it twice in three days.  The second time was a double batch because I was making it as a hostess gift and the kids couldn't stand to see it all leave the house.  At the host's house, there were six people who planted themselves around the bowl, eating away at it for two hours.  The hostess, who normally insists that guests take any brought food home, this time watched intently as I poured the leftovers from my bowl into hers so that I could leave it behind.  This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  I'm planning to try it at Passover, replacing honey for corn syrup and matzoh for popcorn.  Wonder if it will work!!!

Fantastic!  I used half the butter, and gave in cute bags for Christmas.  Everyone loved it... I think the exact words were "I like caramel popcorn and all, but I could eat this stuff all day!"

This is the same recipe as Mrs. Wells.  Outstanding! I use nearly 1 c. of unpopped corn and there's still plenty of coating.  Yum!

This is pretty close to the recipe my Great Grandmother used.  I prefer to stir the popcorn while it cools rather than breaking it up after it cools.

Great recipe, I made two batches in the same day because it is so good we wanted to give some to friends :) We used canadian mapple syrup instead of corn syrup and I must admit it is great!! We used dark brown sugar so it didn't turn out very sticky but it still tasted awesome!!  This recipe might be as good as my grand mother's :)

I did as others suggested and cut the amount of butter in half. Also, I used 2 bags of Orville Redenbacher's movie theater butter popcorn. The caramel was a little tough to work with at first, but in the end the popcorn turned out great!

Yum!!!! I didn't even think it was possible to make caramel corn, so when I saw the recipe I couldn't wait to make it!  Party guests loved it!  Took the advice from others and scaled down the butter to 1 stick and followed the microwave directions.  What a breeze.  One thing to be aware of... make sure you don't use a ceramic bowl to microwave in as it burned the heck out of my hands.  The paper bag idea and lining the baking sheet was genius.  No fuss no muss!

I have been making this recipe for a few years.  Everyone LOVES it and it disappears quickly.  I do not have much luck when I try to add nuts, they do not stick to the popcorn and just fall to the bottom.  I use mircowave popcorn = 3 bags.  Thank you for this recipe!

My son needed caramel popcorn for school tomorrow, so I'm trying this recipe for the first time.  I went with all of reviewer "Patracina's" recommendations and it was no fail.  I should have looked at more tips, but I'm doing this last minute.  I put my popcorn in a big plastic bag and drizzled a little caramel at a time till i think i coated pretty good and it was good like that.  I'm baking in the oven and i'm sure it will be better when it cools.  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this I ran out of brown sugar and had to use some white sugar for 1 of the 2 cups of sugar. It still turned out great, but my family thought it was just a little bit too salty. I'll maybe cut down on the salt next time.

THIS IS TO DIE FOR! Best I have ever had. I added peanuts to mine during the drizzle and mix stage and it is just perfect to my taste. I was looking for something that would ship well this Christmas and I think I found it! GREAT RECIPE!

Flavor is 5 stars, crunchy-ness is 5 stars. It's not the prettiest looking caramel corn, hence the 4 stars. Every time I stirred & then once it cooled & I broke it up, the kernels broke up smaller & smaller. I used Orville Redenbachers All Natural-maybe it's the brand? I was going for nice big, puffy kernels, just like my favorite bagged caramel corn & it doesn't resemble that at all. Still yummy tho!

I haven't even finished making this yet and I can't keep my fingers out of it! Every time I stir it, I have to sneak a little bit. A tip: for anyone having problems coating your popcorn, just make stovetop popcorn while you're making the caramel sauce. It coats BEAUTIFULLY! (AND you won't have to worry about it being too buttery or salty because the caramel sauce will be the only flavor on it)

Not that this recipe needs the ratings but here are afew more tips.  for 1-2 ppl, I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn and 1/2 the recipe above. I used the equivalent of 3/4c of butter for the full recipe.  Use 3-4 bags of microwave popcorn per full recipe depending on how much candy coating you like.  For a lighter color end result, I used brown sugar and light "clear" corn syrup.  this will give you a creamed coffee color.  Added a tsp of cinnamon as well. Definitely keep your popcorn warmed in the oven until syrup is read to be poured. I baked 15m, mixed, and another 20m, mixed and let rest.  That's 40 min total and it was fine. Awesome easy recipe.  For those who can't make this, keep at it.  And if you still can't get it right, find another hobby. :)

This buttery caramel coated popcorn melts in your mouth.  It's so amazing.  There is no recipe like it.  It takes a while to bake, but it is sooo worth it.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe, except maybe drizzle on a little chocolate over it or add peanuts, but it really doesn't need it.  Yummy!

This is very good.  I made something similar on a different recipe site that used the crunchy hard Cheetos instead of popcorn.  This is definitely less fattening than that recipe!  I used 1 stick of butter and it came out great.  I used a hot air popper to make the popcorn and wish I knew how much raw popcorn made 5 quarts of popped corn.  I am sure that fact is out there but I didn't have time to look it up.  I just used 1/2 a cup of raw popcorn kernels in the hot air popper.  Seems to be perfect.  Doesn't seem to make that much.  It all fit in a gallon ziploc bag after it had cooled from the oven.

This was really good. I just used 1/2 cup of butter like others suggested. I like that it did not stick to my teeth and it stored well in ziploc bags. I think it is good to use popcorn with a little salt on it because I love the sweet and salty mix. I will be making this often!

This caramel popcorn is great!  I took the advice of several reviewers - warming the popcorn in the oven before mixing and cutting the butter in half.  I'll definitely be making this again!

YUMMY! Be sure to work fast. Have everything set up before you begin so the caramel coating doesn't have a chance to cool when the time comes to coat it. Keep the popcorn warm in the oven before you poor the mixture onto it (drizzle was hard to achieve).

AMAZING!!! I used three bags of popcorn and followed the advice of others and doubled two brown paper bags to stir the popcorn in. Also, I made sure to keep the popcorn warm, in the oven, while the caramel was cooking. This seriously taste like gourmet popcorn; maybe even better!? Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!

I've made this several times now, a couple of times, very unsuccessful, grainy by end of baking. This weekend, I decided to give it one more try.  I kept a close eye on baking time and only baked 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.  It came out beautiful and delicious.

THIS IS THE BEST!!!! I made caramel popcorn for the first time last night and used this recipe. It makes like 15 cups of popcorn and it was all gone today! We couldn't stop eating it. I kept the recipe just as is and was great! I will definitely make again and again. Can't wait...=)

delicious! i followed the advice of the other reviews: used only half of the amount of butter and kept the popcorn warm in the oven until ready to put the caramel on.  in addition, since i didn't have corn syrup, i substituted with clover honey and it came out just as good; the honey gave it a nice, slight nutty flavor to it.  lastly, i cut the recipe in half which came out to equal about 2 bags of popped popcorn.  this was really great and addicting! definitely will be making more!

Excellent!! I made 2 batches for an elementary school bake sale. The first batch I made with domino light brown sugar, Perfect. The second batch I had to use my store brand light brown sugar and not as good. Use good ingredients when making this it makes a HUGE difference and use real butter do not skimp and it will be perfect!

Wow, wow, wow!!! Delicious!  I also took the suggestion of only using 1/2 cup of butter and it was just fine!  This was gone in two days.  I put it out for some company and they couldn't stop eating it! Will be making this over and over and over!

I used a salted microwave popcorn, so I omitted the salt from the recipe. It turned out amazing. My whole family raved about the popcorn. My husband said it was better than store bought.

i have been making this recipe for years, and my mother had been making it for years before that. i make multiple batches at christmas every year. i've passed it in to numerous people. the popcorn in the tins will never taste the same after enjoying this scrumptious recipe! be sure to turn down the heat really low for the boil, no stirring, or the caramel will burn.

This popcorn is great and fairly easy to make! I halved the recipe and used 1 1/2 bags popped butter popcorn. It still tasted great although next time I think I'll try and use plain popcorn. My husband loves it and it's a great way to use up those bags of popcorn sitting around (we both don't really care for plain or buttered popcorn). It would also make a nice gift to give someone. 5 stars for sure!  Update: The first time I made this, I forgot to add the baking soda and vanilla. It came out like the caramel popcorn you buy and tasted great. The only complaint was that there were chunks of the coating that were really chewy. I just made this again and added the baking soda. It immediately puffed up and wouldn't go back down (runny and sticky) when baking and so it's all light and fluffy, not like candy, more soft. I think it worked better without the baking soda.

This stuff is greater than great and easy too.  Just a little sticky and can be fixed with some non-stick spray on the pans and mixing bowl.  
Thank you for sharing this wonderful treat

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY! This recipe turned out absolutely fabulous.  I made a couple of revisions.  I added 1 c. halved pecans to the popcorn in pan #1 and 1/2 c. mixed nuts to pan #2...Execellent addition!  Too, I baked at 300 degrees for 20 minutes, stirring mid way through total time.

I LOVE this recipe.  I have a sister in braces so I substituted puffed corn for popped corn.  She loved it and the saltiness of the puffed corn is the perfect compliment to the sweetness of the carmel mixture.

Wow, I had a horrible experience with this. Against my better judgement, I didn't do the recipe as written, but instead did as several reviewers suggested about cutting the butter in half. I have a feeling I needed that extra butter... The caramel turned out to be a sticky mess and there was not nearly enough for 3 bags of pop corn.  And what's up with not telling us what temp the caramel mixture should get to? How are you supposed to knnow if it's ready or not??? Next time, I think I will do exactly what the recipe calls for and then decide for myself if changes need to be made. I think sometimes people mess with you on these comments...

Oh my gosh, this is fabulous!! My first batch I cooked for the full hour and I did not like that at all--has the consistency of Cracker Jack, which I don't like. My husband liked that one though. So my next batch I only cooked for 15 minutes in the oven and then took it out. That was perfect!! Needless to say, it's all gone for Christmas gifts and now my kids are asking me to make more. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is so easy and came out great.  My husband loved it!  I lined one of my pans with foil and would definetely recommend doing that as it helped to get everything out of the pan as well as clean-up.

Very good and easy recipe.  I used 1 1/2 times the measurements because I like the popcorn extra coated.  I also added pecans.  The kids loved it!

I made this last weekend, and the popcorn were gone in two days. My boyfriend and I ate them all! I made my own popcorn using peanut oil and popcorn maker and follow the rest of the recipe. I'm planning to make it as a christmas gift. Thanks for sharing.

Halved the recipe just to try it out and added pecans and almonds to the popped corn...crisping up nicely right now and all the 'taste tests' have been great.  May try spicing it up next go round...

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly!!  I used half the recipe and did a 3.5oz microwave popcorn bag and it was wonderful!  My son loves caramel popcorn and now I have a tried and true recipe that I can make for him occasionally :)  Thank you for sharing this one!!!

This is the best caramel corn ever!!! I used two bags microwave popcorn and don't see how you could use any more than that and still having enough caramel to cover.  Also reduced the butter to 1 stick instead of 2 per the advice of other reviewers and it turned out perfect!!

I made this for my fiance and he loved it!!! There were 2 things though for me.
1. This was a sticky mess to clean up.
2. I used microwave popcorn and I did not sift through to get the unpopped kernals out. That was a mistake on my part. 

Next time, I will probably use bagged plain popcorn and spray my pans and utensils with cooking spray to prevent the sticking. Hopefully that will work.
Overall, this is a really great recipe, and I will definitely make it again.

This is the first time I ever made caramel popcorn and it was great. I did do like some of the other comment said and cut the butter to a 1/2 cup and if I didn't know it, I wouldn't know the difference. I also used a large roaster pan(like you would use for a turkey at thanksgiving) and it worked wonderfully. I love this recipe and will definately use it again!

This is caramel lovers heaven! Takes a while to make...but worth it! 1/2 cup of butter worked out just fine, and by cutting it in half you have more butter to make another batch! (just wish I could find big enough containers to double the recipe the first time)! If you are feeding a crowd, it will NOT last!!

I was reluctant to try this recipe as I have burned caramel before. But it was a slow Sunday afternoon and I had the ingredients on hand and threw it together. Simply amazing...buttery and decadent! I went with a full cup of butter but will halve it next time. I didn't want to take any chances and alter the recipe. I popped 1/2 C of kernels in my Whirley Pop and it was the perfect amount. I added two cups of peanuts as well. Can't wait to make another batch!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  WOW, it is so good.  Everyone in work loved it and asked for me to make more.  They even said it is better than Johnson's carmel popcorn that you get on the boardwalk down the shore. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

OMG, this was awesome.  I can't ever make this again because I basically inhaled it.  I used 1/2 the butter and if I make it again I would probably use 1/2 the sugar and 1/4 the butter because I had more than enough caramel.  Yum.

Very good and relatively easy to make. I used 2 bags of microwave kettle corn the first time and butter the second. I think it tasted better with the butter flavored popcorn.  will definitely add some nuts in next time

This popcorn is so amazing.  i simply can not stop eating it.  I made it from popcorn kernels popped in coconut oil.  The results are stellar!  Its light and crunchy and sweet and salty and so very buttery.  I think the real secret here is that the caramel recipe is so great.  I couldn't stop dipping my finger to eat some caramel when i was mixing it up.  The caramel is very thick and sticky, so its a little tricky to get the popcorn coated evenly, but tossing it lightly by hand worked well.  I also added some peanuts.  Delicious!

I love this recipe! As do my housemates.
I do it up in university student style though. just pour it over the popcorn and too eager to put it back in the oven. We eat it while it is still gooey! 
Also I found I didn't have any corn syrop so I used tabletop pancake syrop (aunt Jemima I believe) and it is FANTASTIC with it.

I love this recipe! I made it to bring to a super bowl party and it was a huge hit!! It makes a lot so cut it down if you aren't planning on making it for 12 people. My fiance and I are planning on packaging it for favors at our wedding reception in June! Really good!!

This was pretty good but it was a little too sweet for my family to give it 5 stars.    If I make it again I'd probably use more popcorn.

Awesome - made for a big pot luck party and it was a popular item among the desserts. It was also fun to make since my daughters loved watching the corn POP through the glass lid!

I have a Super Bowl party every year and make this caramel popcorn.  Needless to say I make a lot and it is the first thing gone.  I do not change the recipe at all. Wonderful worth five stars.

The best caramel popcorn ever.  My friends and family request it every year at Christmas or when we take a road trip.  Thank you so much for sharing it with us.

Taste is fantastic!! I can't tell you about the finished product yet (it's still baking), but the caramel leftovers on the spoon is divine! The quick version to just pour it on there--I've given to my husband before our movie, and he hasn't put it down yet. I'm waiting for the real stuff, but nonetheless...I can't wait, and it's been SUPER easy.

YUMMY!  I've never made caramel popcorn before.  This recipe is so easy to follow and the caramel popcorn is better than anything you can buy in the stores.  I left it in the oven for the full 1 hour - the result was crunchy, caramel deliciousness.

Absolutely phenomenal!  Tips: makes sure you don't have any corn kernels mixed in with your popcorn, its painful on the teeth to bit down on one of those.  Second, put on greased foil...makes clean up so much better!  Lastly, add some whole nuts!  I didn't bake it as long as instructed, (about 30 mins)but I do recommend baking it, as opposed to not baking it as some of reviewers suggest, it just makes the popcorn real crispy and will help it to keep longer.  This was truly awesome!

MMMM good! We all loved this and it was something fun to do with the kids. (Until they lost interest while it was in the oven and it got a little "over done"! The batch that got cooked correctly was MOST excellent! Good and crunchy!

This is so yummy. I skipped the oven baking step and just stirred it all together in a huge bowl. You have to stir and break it up as it cools for a little while. An even easier way to finish it up is to just spread it out on wax paper, then every now and then break it up into smaller chunks... My kids hated waiting for it while it baked in the oven so this worked better for us. Makes it nice a chewy.. YUM! Oh I also made homemade stove top popcorn in a large pot verses using microwave.

This popcorn tastes better then store bought caramel corn. The effort to make it is worth it but make sure to pour the caramel on the popcorn within a few minutes, or else the caramel sauce will thicken and not spread well. Stir every 10- 15 minutes an cook in the biggest, flattest pans you have! Also grease th4e pan because my bottom layer stuck to the   bottom. Delicioso!

I followed the instructions exactly, and the caramel ended up having a somewhat burned taste. Aside from that, the flavor was good.  Next time I won't bake it as long.

This recipe is great.  If you make it in a large roast pan, i.e. the size of a turkey roaster, it is MUCH easier to spread the caramel mixture around and easier to stir with spilling.  YUM!!

This is sooo simple and VERY good! Tonight was the first time I made this, and it turned out perfect, which is good as it's going to school with my son for his teachers!  The first batch, my bottom pan also got much more crispy, so I lowered the temp to 225 and baked for 45 min.  Better! (My oven may run hot.)  Thank you for this recipe!!!  It's a MUST!

This was a great, easy recipe.  Would have appreciated if I knew to grease the baking pans so that I wasn't scraping at the pan for a half hour trying to get the popcorn out.  (minor miss on the recipe) otherwise it was fantastic.

This is the best caramel corn!  I've made it many times and friends and relatives love it every time.  I do use a candy thermometer and and cook the syrup to 255 to 260 degrees.  It comes out right every time.

This stuff is amazing and addicting! My whole family loves it. I made it last year and filled Christmas tins for teacher gifts and it was a HUGE hit. I also made a ton of it and put it into a big halloween candy container and used it for the cake walk at my kids school. Another big hit. I have had SOO many people ask for this recipe. I don't cut anything. I make it just as it is listed. VERY GOOD!

NOT proud to admit this, but I started eating it before it was done and couldnt stop!!
Having never made caramel popcorn before, and not being a huge caramel popcorn freak, I had somewhat low expectations, but the reviews made me curious.  
Not only did I have a bit of burned popcorn, and I added the baking soda and the vanilla BEFORE the boiling process- so I fouled it up a bit, and it still came out AMAZING!!
Reminds me of the gourmet candy and ice cream shops I used to visit as a kid.  
DH is another not-so-huge-fan of caramel popcorn, but he too could not stop eating it.  
I am 100% sure I'll be making this again-most likely very soon!! 
I dont know if I should say "Thanks for a great recipe" or "Boo! you've made me an addict" 

Easy, not too expensive to make and amazing!! Go for it!

This reminds me of the popcorn balls a family friend would make for Halloween every year.  It's wonderful.  Make sure you don't overcook as the candy for the popcorn makes the popcorn very hard.

This was really yummy and fairly easy to make.  I've never had homemade caramel popcorn before now!  I lined my pans with foil and then sprayed with cooking spray.  It made clean-up a lot easier!

This was really, really great.  It was a lot easier to make than I would ever have expected.  I don't care much for vanilla so I substituted maple flavoring and I didn't have enough corn syrup so I used a previous poster's suggestion and used honey instead.  My 6 year old and I are probably going to finish it and not have any left for DH when he gets home from work!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious.  I used three bags of microwavable popcorn and used my turkey pan to mix it all in.  It turned out great and saved really well in a ziploc bag.

This is awesome--once you make it, you will NEVER buy the boxed stuff again. I followed the recipe exactly except I did what another person suggested and microwaved the caramel corn in paper bags for 30 seconds 4 times. The cleanup was ridiculously easy. A huge hit! Thanks.

So good and dangerous...I can't stop eating it!!!  My self control has been overpowered by this wonderful caramel popcorn.  I usually make this for christmas.  It is perfect to share with the family when decorating the christmas tree or opening presents.

This was easy to make and a hit with a group of people on a camping trip.  I agree with other users to cut the butter in half.  I used 1/2c of butter and couldnt even tell the difference.  Also, I poured the popcorn and liquid mixture into a paper bag and shook it up to evenly coat the popcorn.  This works very well, just be careful bc mixture is VERY hot!!

I just made this because I was craving something sweet.  WOW!!  Unbelievable!!  I tried some unbaked and is was good, but baking it makes it so much better.  Next time I'm going to add some nuts.  The only complaint is that it's a bit greasy, but it may be cause I used buttered popcorn.  Next time I'm going to use plain and see if that makes a difference.  Thanks...I'll never buy caramel corn again!!

I prepare this recipe thru step 2 & instead of cooking it in the oven I make it into popcorn balls. This is a great recipe to add small candies to. To quote 1 of my sons friends. Excellent!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I made a half batch cause I didn't want waste all that popcorn if it didn't turn out but now I wish I doubled it!  I made it exactly to the recipe with air popped popcorn and wouldn't change a thing.  I'm going to make more for my daughters school picnic!  What a hit with the kids!

Best caramel popcorn recipe!!! You will never ever go back to eating store bought again! This was so easy to make... and I found that I didn't even really need to bake it. Instead I left it out on a flat cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, and let it dry before breaking it into pieces. It was nice and chewy.

I was hoping this might taste more like the toffee type popcorn coatings but it was good. I used 1/2 of the butter called for based on other reviews but will try it with the actual amount next time. I found when I put it in the oven it had a little bit of a burnt taste and the coating became a little bit harder than I would like. It did taste good and I will make it again but would like to try some other recipes.

This would have been awesome if it hadn't burned so easily. That is one of the challenges with corn syrup. But, the next time I make this, I would probably do what another reviewer suggested and just let the caramel mixture dry onto the popcorn without baking it.

This is addictive!  Be warned!  You won't be able to stop eating it until it's gone.  I've made it twice, stuck to the recipe and it comes out perfect!  I couldn't figure out how much 5 quarts of popcorn was but I made 1.5 recipes and filled two of the aluminum turkey roasters with popcorn.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe.

I just finished making this and Im kinda disappointed. I followed the recipe except only left it in the oven for 45 mins because I tasted one and it sort of had a little burnt taste. I wish I would have read the review that said use GOLDEN brown sugar instead of dark.Set oven @200 degrees instead. I also used dark corn syrup. I can tell this is a absolute winner because even though its a little burnt Its still good. Im gonna try again using the suggestions. Recipe was easy and caramel coating was perfectly even. Darn!

I am sorry I came across this recipe. I just keep eating it!!! This is the best!! I used microwave popcorn. Super easy! Next time I might cut back on the salt just because of the microwave popcorn is already salted. Wonderful recipe. Brings back memories of when my mom would make carmel corn around the holidays.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but I did use the microwave directions here on the comments. This was so quick and easy, that it can easily be made for a quick snack for the kids but delicious enough to put out for a munchie at the holidays. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted SO GOOD. The only thing I would change is to perhaps add 1 -2 cups nuts before baking. If you are watching salt you could add 1/2 tsp salt and it turns out fine. I definately taste the salt with 1 tsp, but I like the salty sweet flavor. I bake in a large dutch oven lightly coated with PAM.

WONDERFUL!  We let it cool for a few minutes when we took it out of the oven then had some.  We liked it best when it was warm.  It's still delicious after it's cooled though.

It is truly delicious! I used 3 bags of Kettle Corn and cut the butter in half. I also use a brown supermarket bag to stir the popcorn and the brown sugar mix. Finally, line your pan with foil so it doesnt make a mess. No more Cracker Jacks for me!

This is THE BEST!!!  The first time I made this I cut it in half and used only one stick of butter, microwave popcorn and shook it in brown paper grocery bags as someone else stated in their review. Was so much better the second time! The second time I made the recipe as it's written and put pecans in with it while in the oven. Totally awesome and extremely addicting.

Great Taste but just a little too sweet for me (or just don't eat too much at a time). I used 2 bags of Microwave Popcorn and it was coated very well. May want to do 3 bags to break up the sweetness a bit..I think it woudl still be very good. Also, this tastes more like a toffee than a caramel...although it is very rich and good. I will probably make this again for Halloween or for Christmas Gifts.

I made this popcorn while i was camping in a camper, i do not recommend that!! LOL....It took FOREVER to bake, but was worth it.  All the families we were camping with kept fighting over the popcorn container.  "Who has the bucket, who has it now, i want more popcorn, pass it over here" is all i heard for a good hour.  Very crispy if baked long enough, great carmel flavor, not too sweet.  Great!

FABULOUS!!!The party loved this and was asking for more when the HUGE popcotn bowl was quickly emptied:). I popped closer to 7 qts of popcorn and felt it was perfect. I suggest if you don't want the popcorn to be drenched with too much caramel, pop more popcorn,

YUM!  I made this last night. I used the suggestions from previous reviewers.  I used a large brown grocery bag to mix. I will be making this again, but next time, I will try a little more butter and less sugar.  Addicting is right!!!!

This was everything I hoped it would be. It's a little time-consuming to have to stir the popcorn in the oven every fifteen minutes, but the final product is delicious! I didn't use as much popcorn as was called for, which meant that what I did have was more caramel-coated...(ran out of room in the bowl I was stirring it in). I also didn't need the last 15 mins of cook time (I have an oven that is usually too hot), so if it seems ready before the cook time is up, then you may want to pull it out. Great snack at my Oscar Party!

I cant believe I finally know how to make caramel popcorn from scratch!!! And it's soooooo good! The full recipe is too much for me and my fiance, so I halve the recipe, and I use 1 bag of microwave butter popcorn (3.5 oz),half the salt (1/4 tsp), Karo LIGHT corn syrup, and Domino's DARK brown sugar (that's what I use initially, since it turned out very good, I don't wanna change a thing). My fiance said it's better with cashews, so sometimes I throw them in. I foil and pam a 13x9 pan, and bake it for 35-40 minutes, with mixing them very well every 12-13 mins. Thank you so much for this recipe, definitely a keeper!

DELICIOUS! I made this last night and gave them away as christmas gifts for my friends. I have to say that it does taste more like toffee than it does caramel, but it's still really good anyways. Just remember to re-coat the popcorn every once in a while when it's in the oven, because the caramel tends to pool to the bottom and slide of the popcorn. I coated my first batch with a lot of the mixture, the second, not so much; I think the most difficult thing is getting the right amount on there (I didn't have space in my oven to put it all on at once so I did it in 3 batches). The one with a lot of caramel came out ok, the second one a little burnt (be careful that this doesn't happen or else it will end up tasting bitter) because it didn't have enough coating on it. I also shortened the oven time to 45 minutes because my popcorn was already golden brown (mmm). I let it cool, mixed it with some white chocolate chips and toasted peanuts, wrapped it in cellophane and tied it with a ribbon. Great gift! Thank you for the recipe, it will definetely be made again!

Super awesome recipe!  Husband loved it! I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn, being sure to remove all the kernals, and cut the ingredeants in half.  Husband ate after the first stirring when gooey, and he and I ate after the second stirring when less gooey.  Then we added some chocolate chips to some after the third stirring when crunchier.  Popcorn is super awesome after every stirring.  Any cook tme is great!

This was a great recipe.  I wouldn't use molasses the next time instead of the corn syrup.  I did not like the taste but DH and friends did.  It was easy though and defintely a tasty treat.  Also, becareful about the kernels if you use micro. popcorn.

This is a VERY dangerous recipe!  I followed others advice and didn't bake it quite as long as the recipe called for since I like my caramel popcorn a little chewy instead of brittle.  My husband and I practically INHALED the whole batch.  I've held off making it again until we have some company over so they can help eat some so we don't eat it all by ourselves again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was much easier than I ever thought it would be!  Mine turned out nice and crisp, with out being burnt at all.  The only thing is that the pieces broke up too small when I tried to break it up, so I had to  leave it a little clumpy...tastes great though!

I wish this could be a even higher rating because this is wonderful.  It is a good idea to line pan with foil and spray with pam or something thankyou so much!  Next time I'll add some nuts and it would be better than poppycock

GREAT!! A++. Addicting!!  However, next time i will line my glass pan with foil as this was VERY messy and ended up throwing away pyrex because it was easier than cleaning stiff caramel off of it. Thanks for recipe.

Pretty easy.  I baked it for only about 40mins.  I mightve left it too long to cool, got really stuck together! But tasty!

Fabulous. Use the brown sugar flavored corn syrup, dry roasted peanuts, and Orville Redenbacher Tender White popcorn. Perfection will follow.

Excellent, easy, and delicious. I added a bit of vanilla. As a note, I used 2 regular sized microwave popcorn bags, and they were fine. Next time I might cut the salt since the popcorn was salty enough.

This turned out perfectly. I have made the same mistake some other readers did by adding the baking soda before boiling instead of after, and yeah, a flop. :O) I made this for the treat bags for my son's 4th birthday and it was a hit. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making it again. I did change one thing. I did find the caramel quite thick, and thankfully found it was easier to thoroughly mix it into the popcorn while it was baking. I did only bake it for 30 minutes, as some others mentioned, and stirred once. Perfect!

Easy recipe that I made with my 13 yr old daughter.  Will be a favorite to make for holidays and parties.  Thinking of making it to give as treat gifts for the up coming holidays. So simple!!!  Thank you for sharing.

Can't believe how good this stuff is. My daughters were counting the minutes til they could eat it the first time I made it. I only baked for 30 minutes though. Have made several times now and it comes out great every time.

This is excellent!  I did only bake it for 30 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  It was difficult to find a bowl big enough to mix this in, so I had to use 2 large bowls.

This popcorn was awesome!  Lots of raves about it.  I only gave it a four because it was so time-intensive.  Would definitely make it again for special occasions.

It taste great but after baking it for 45mins at 250degrees,as others suggested,it did not turn out to be as crunchy as I expect it to be.Looks is also less appealing coz its not as shiny as the ones bought in the stores.Pls advice on how to make it crunchier and have add luster to the popcorn.

FANTASTIC!!  I made it with one slight, easy variation.  Add 1-2 cups whole almonds, and use 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in place of all vanilla.  The result:  Almond Toffee Popcorn -WAY better than Cracker Jack.  Baked for 45 min.  Perfect!

Wow wow wow!  I made a half batch and should have made a double batch!  The neighbor is already begging for more.  She wants to know if I'm going to put a prize in the bag because she swears it taste better than Cracker Jacks.  I did bake for the whole hour.  Stirring was tricky but just provided the perfect opportunities for taste testing.  I wasn't sure whether to use light or dark corn syrup.  I used light.  A great recipe with just the right amount of sweetness and crunch.  Next time I'll add nuts.

the taste was really good, baked it for 45 minutes but felt that even that was too much time.  it was very cruncy and not soft.  i will make this again and bake for about 20 minutes next time for a more softer popcorn.
i did make a little less popcorn with the same amount of sauce which was a big mistake because it was just too sweet (usually the ones from the store with the most caramel on the popcorn are the best ones and so i thought it would be the same situation here..nope! less is much better) but that is my fault and i will definitly not cover the popcorn as much with the caramel.  but i feel that the baking time is much too long.
i will try it again with all of that in mind.

Thanks for an absolutely awesome recipe.  I couldnt believe how easy it was to make!  My guys didnt even wait till it cooled off before they were eating it.  I've already been told (its only been 15 minutes since I pulled it out of the oven) that I will be making this again tomorrow.  Thanks again!

This recipe is awesome!  I use two bags of natural popcorn and add some peanuts and it's great every time. I find that it only takes about forty five minutes in the oven and is best a few minutes after it comes out so it's crispy but still warm! My family and boyfriend convince me to make this all the time and it never lasts a day! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was great! I did as others suggested, lined a cookie sheet with foil and sprayed it with Pam, however next time I would use a baking pan instead of a cookie sheet b/c it's hard to mix the popcorn without it falling off the sheet. I also halved the recipe using 1 bag of popcorn and it was perfect.

Here it is 6:30 in the morning and im eating this like its 10:00 at night. I made this as a treat for church and I dont know if all of its going to make it there.The only thing I changed is the baking time(cut it down to 1/2 hour,because of how my oven cooks,) and i didnt use the baking soda because I was all out, it still came out soooo good. I would recommend to all to try this. I think I'll copy the recipe before I go 'cause I know im going to get asked for it.*do not use wax paper when storing in tins, will constantly being pulling wax paper off popcorn.

Really liked this.  Used 2 microwave bags and throw away aluminum pans as suggested.  Think I could have used 3 bags and used all the syrup, some pooled.  But will definitely make again

This recipe was really great.  It turned out crunchy, not at all mushy. Just wonderful. The recipe is great as is, but I added some pecans for an added bonus.

This is a very easy yummy recipe.  Make sure that you don't let it cool in the pan or it will stick and then you will break your popcorn trying to get it out.  This didn't last long at my house!

There is a recipe similiar to this where you can make it in the microwave using brown shopping bads.  IT'S TREMENDOUS!  We make two batches at a time just so it lasts through the weekend.  Sometimes after we make it, my mother in law stops in, and she eats almost all of it.  She can't stop.

It's very good, and easy to make with a microwave.  And CLEAN-UP is a snap.  Just throw away the paper bags when it's done.

This was GREAT!  I had just finished making the other caramel popcorn recipe, but it wasn't nearly enough for the amount of popcorn, and didn't taste so great either.  I decided to try this, and it's wonderful!  It tastes just like the kind you can buy in the big tins, but better!  Thanks a lot for this recipe!

this was an easy recipe, even if making the popcorn from the kernels over the oven.  the popcorn turned out great - i only baked for 45 minutes, as suggested by others. i'll definitely make these again. yummy!

Absolutely delicious!  The best caramel corn I have ever tasted.  Easy to make too. My husband took it to work and said it was an extremely big hit.

This Caramel Popcorn was WONDERFUL!  It was the best I'd ever had.  I have always been partial to store bought caramel corn, but not anymore!  The recipe is easy, it just takes a little time commitment because of the periodic stirring.  If you're going to be home anyway it's no biggie and definitely worth the wait!

This is really good stuff!!! I added toasted sunflower seeds and almonds and these came out great after 45 mins. My almonds were too browned though, so maybe next time I will only toast it for about 5 mins. I will definitely make these again when my little cousins come over. I am sure they will love these too!

Amazing and really easy to make. The kids loved it! I think it’s going to become a favourite in our house. I’ve just looked at other comments and think I will try using half a cup of butter too next time .

I can’t stop eating it. This popcorn is crispy yet melts in your mouth. Don’t reduce the butter, it’s not like you’re dieting if you’re eating caramel popcorn. Indulge and enjoy. I do use a very large pan and stir the popcorn into the pan of caramel instead of drizzling the caramel over the popcorn. That keeps the caramel warm and easier to incorporate.

This recipe is very good but I must say reading the reviews can be so confusing. Some were saying they only used half of the butter, then said that was a half of a pound. The recipe only calls for 1 cup of butter, which IS a half of a pound. Then some said they cut the butter in half by using 1 cup of butter. Which again is what the recipe calls for. Maybe people should understand that 1 stick of butter is a half of a cup!!!! So did they use just a half of a cup of butter which would be half of what the recipe calls for or did they use 1 cup of butter thinking they were halfing it? Anyway I ended up using 1 stick of butter which is half of what was called for and it was great.

This is awesome. I cut the recipe In half and popped 2 bags of microwave popcorn. It was plenty. I think next time I am going to add some peanuts to it.

Phenomenal!!! So good that I couldn’t keep it in the house for more than a day. The hubby couldn’t stop eating it.  I even made one batch and drizzled chocolate over it. DELICIOUS!!!

It was a hit, I followed directions to a T and had no problems.  It was crunchy with great flavor and easy to make, we will make it again for sure. (not too often, or I would eat too much!)  Hard to stop with one serving, good thing we have kids!  They all said it was the best I had made!

Awesome recipe. Such a hit with my family. Will definitely be making this again! Only thing I would add is to be sure to stir one more time after getting it out of the oven.

These are great! I added peanuts to the caramel mix right before I poured it over the popcorn and it came out super delicious. Better than the store- bought Crunch and Munch popcorn. I will def fix this again.

This was really good but only use 3 bags of popcorn or little less if you really want it nicely coated. 5 quarts of popcorn is definitely to much for one batch.

Amazing recipe! Everyone always raves, "the best caramel corn I've ever had!".  I always use an air popper for the corn, makes for a dry and ready product. Also, keeping the popcorn warm in a pan while making the caramel is crucial.  Sometimes I switch the vanilla extract for a different flavor. Coffee, pistachio, almond.  Make multiple batches, with different extracts, then blend together for a true original. Can't go wrong adding nuts! Pecans and blanched almonds are a personal favorite.

I followed the directions as stated. Stirred it every 15 minutes like the directions stated(took it out before time as a matter of fact). The caramel burned on the popcorn in the oven. I may give it another try. We were so hyped to try this.

Amazing!  I'm constantly asked to make this recipe!!
I will add a couple of handfuls of salted cocktail peanuts to the pan.  I don't put my popcorn in a big bowl, I pop a full bowl with my popcorn popper (with oil) and spread it out between two jellyroll pans, then add peanuts before pouring on the caramel.  
I've made this twice in the past two weeks, and already have several requests for more.

This was delicious and easy.  The only thing that I did differently was that I ended up cooking it in the oven for a total of about 1 1/4 hours, stirring every 15 minutes, before it was crispy.

This is delish! I don't think I've ever left a review before for any recipe but had to, for this one. The only change I made was to keep the popcorn warm as suggested by others and I only baked it for 45mins. I have a convection oven and 45 mins was perfect. My initial stirring was tricky. However, when I would remove it at the 15 min mark, and mix again, it coated the less coated corn. After 3 times it was coated well. I will definitely be making this again.

I’ve made this many times over the years.  You will not go wrong to follow the recipe exactly.  It is so Good!   That said, it is a easy recipe to play around with.  I’ve made it with molasses, with maple syrup etc.  My crew seem to prefer it made with pure maple syrup and omit the soda.  I also add 1-2 cups of toasted pecans.

Tastes ok but the caramel was so think it wouldn't "drizzle" in a "stream" or anything like that.  More of intermittent clumps falling on top of the popcorn.  Makes me wonder how so many people gave this 5 stars.

Great recipe! I’ve made it many times now. I like to drizzle melted, tempered chocolate on after it’s cooled and top with salt flakes for an extra sweet and salty treat.

Love this recipe!  Instead of he full cup of butter, I tried 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c coconut oil and it was perfect!  I loved the added flavor of the coconut oil.  I made a huge batch to give away as christmas treats for a Christmas party and this recipe was so delicious!  My family wants me to make some for them since they were only allowed to sample :)

Just made the best batch of caramel popcorn using this recipe , along with mushroom popcorn I purchased through 
justpoppin.com. 

I divided the popcorn into 2 bowls, and tossed the popcorn throughly to coat well, before putting on baking sheet in the oven. I then baked the popcorn for about an hour, turning every 15 to 20 minutes.

I originally got this recipe from a friend, but I lost it. I’m so glad to have found it again, especially since it’s my hubby’s favorite.

We usually make a half batch since it’s just the two of us.

Sometimes I add raw peanuts before baking, 2-3 cups depending on how nutty I want it.

Made just short a cup of popcorn. Added chopped sour jujubes, a few mini pretzels and 3/4 tsp. cayenne. might up it to 1 tsp next time. Mixed it in a large roaster. Put both pans in oven .. top and bottom for 20 minutes. Switched pans halfway through. next time will bake a little less time.

I’ve always made it without baking it, once the caramel hardens it makes up for the soft popcorn.

Going to an adoption party for an eight year old girl, couldn’t think of a better snack to share.  This is crispy, carmely goodness.  Followed the idea of keeping popcorn roasted in the oven while making the carmel and I also added peanuts.  I think this will be a hit!

Halved the recipe, despite other reviews stating to double, since there are just 2 in our house. I used Brown Rice Syrup (that’s what I usually have on hand) instead of corn syrup. Otherwise, made as presented in the recipe. We shared the big bowl while watching a movie. Not more than 10 minutes in BOWL EMPTY!  Best. Caramel. Popcorn. Ever. Made another batch (doubled it this time) and had some to give away to friends! SMACK!!

I thought this was great, I may be crazy but I never put it in the oven, I like it sticky! Oh yeah, if you are using microwave popcorn, you might want to do some research on the cancer causing stuff that is in it, you can make popcorn in the microwave, just not the stuff they make specifically for it.;

This was very good!  I doubled the popcorn I made while keeping the caramel sauce the same and it gave plenty of covering.  I took the advice of someone else and lowered the temperature in the oven and I h ad no issue with burning.  Will make again!

Really good. I used half the butter, and kept the popcorn warm in the oven (100F) while making the caramel. Baked first half hour at 250F then reduced the other half hour to 200F. Delicious!

Turned out better than I thought it would while making it.  I don't use microwave popcorn so I popped my own about a 1/2 cup unpopped, it may have been too much because the caramel didn't cover it all completely (but it was still good)  My caramel didn't drizzel on it poured out in a big glob and was a little hard to stir in, but that might be because I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1.  It did have the consistency of cracker jacks when it was done, but that could be due to less butter, too much popcorn which I changed from the original recipe.  I use a glass 9x13 and a 14 x 11 wilton non stick pan.  I liked the non stick pan the best.  I will make this again!

Sounds great. I read how everyone cut butter to 1/2 cup. In my head I kept thinking half a stick. So ended up using 1/4 cup of butter. It turned out amazing. We added pecans.

Last night I became a popcorn hero with this recipe.  I live in Guatemala and caramel popcorn almost doesn't exist.  I took a huge basket of the treat to a party last night and no one had ever tried it before.  I brought back a few crumbs, and requests for more.  This is easy, fast, and remarkably delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe says, but made enough for 30 servings -- a really huge basket!!  One trick I learned here is to make the popcorn without salt or any kind of oil.  Save a clean paper bag from any fast food place. add half a cup of the raw kernels and fold down the top.  Toss it into the microwave for about 3 minutes and take out crisp, hot, healthy snacks.

I've made this recipe for decades. I would say, keep your popcorn in the oven, in your pan, waiting for the candy. I put the popcorn in my largest roasting pan lined with foil. Don't worry about sticking. As long as it's hot, you can stir the candy on the popcorn. I do have a couple tips. 1...If you have a spoontula, use it. It's soft and won't scrape foil, yet flat on end so you get all the candy while stirring. 2...Air popped is best. Plus I dump it in paper grocery bag and shake the biggest popcorn to the top. 3...1 qt is equal to 4 cups when measuring popcorn. 4...Whether you like your caramel corn light or dark, you can adjust what kind of corn syrup to use. Also light or dark brown sugar. 5... Don't worry about coating ALL the popcorn with the first pour. By the time it gets stirred 3 times in the oven, it should be all coated. :) 6... Feel free to add peanuts or any favorite nut. Mine is pecans. Just lay them on top of waiting popcorn before you add the candy. They will eventually stir in throughout. 7... When finished baking, work quickly and dump onto sheet of foil. No greasing required. . ... Love this recipe! Few ingredients and few dishes!

This is the best caramel popcorn ever. The only substitution I made was — I added 3 cups of cocktail peanuts. Awesome! My crew loved it. Will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe with no changes. Nobody liked it right after I poured and stirred the caramel in it. But after I baked and stirred it every 15 minutes  for about  1 hour, everybody loved it. The popcorn becomes crispy.  I actually didn’t make enough of this for reserves, because  the caramel popcorn was gone in no time. You can tell it’s ready when the popcorn kernels don’t  stick to each other while stirring.

I used microwave movie theatre butter,  also instead of using corn syrup I used coconut nectar.  Could not have asked for a better dish.  Next time I do plan on swapping out the brown sugar for coconut sugar a well (hey,  have to try for healthier). Will keep this recipe around!

Mine came out too hard and crunchy. I think I should have reduced the caramel cooking time...I'm at high altitude and usually take 8 degrees off the thermometer reading. I will boil it only 3 minutes next time.

We doubled the recipe, it turned put amazing. We have a popcorn machine so it was super fresh. The kids were eating it shortly after it came put of the oven! It was simple to make and not too time consuming.

First, this recipe is AWESOME!! However after making it or versions for 10 plus years,  over the last 6 months of making it, it has started to become gritty after baking.  It used to bubble during baking and no longer does. This has to be user error or a change in product quality because I'm not doing anything different. Has anyone else experienced this?

Easy!  I used two batches of popcorn popped in my air popper.... it had to have been more than 5 quarts, and the caramel mixture still coated the popcorn very well! Good stuff!  Doesn't take long for guests to polish off!

I made this  from another  recipe  site.  The flavor is fabulous, but the other recipe  didn't call for 2 pans so  there was not enough room to stir the popcorn sufficiently.  I will make this again as suggested in a review using a large roaster.

We make this recipe, then make a batch of cheese popcorn and then mix them to make our own Chicago blend.  It's super easy.  I use a large non-stick roasting pan, heat the oven with the pan in it.  Pop the popcorn and toss it in the pan in the oven while I make the caramel.  If the popcorn is hot and the pan is hot the caramel will spread quite easily.

Here is how I made it:  pop the popcorn in wok.  Transfer the popcorn in the pan and keep warm in oven.  I melt 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 corn syrup, 1 cup Splenda brown sugar blend in the wok, then finish the recipe with the other ingredients and bake as directed.  Turned out great.  

I also tried to sub all sugar with Truiva but the popcorn didn't get crunchy when it cooled down.  

Thank you for the recipe.

I made half the recipe, and cut the butter in half again, as several raters did.  So, I ended up using 1/4 cup butter.  Everything was peachy keen till I added the vanilla.  When you boil sugar for 4 minutes, it's very hot.  After removing from the flame, I added the baking soda and vanilla, and in 1 second's time, the vanilla sputtered and spat like an angry cat.  And burned.  I dressed the popped corn anyway, and baked it at 200 degrees, as another rater suggested.  Stirred it every commercial break during the football game.  Baked only 45 min, as another rater suggested.  Nice and crispy!  A little too burned for complete pleasure, but enjoyed just the same.  Next time, no vanilla.

Followed the recipe except I used a bag of original puffed corn. Instead of kernel corn and Only baked for 3-15 min intervals. 
It turns out crunchy on the outside not chewy.

Easy to make.  The right amount of caramel glaze.  It takes a while but is well worth it.   Make sure your oven never goes slightly above 250f and your corn should never burn.

corn syrup is bad for you so I didn't use it, instead I used some maple syrup and it tasted amazing!!! You could also dip these in chocolate and drizzle with white chocolate and you get zebra popcorn! ( but you have to melt the chocolates of course! )

I made this just as the recipe called for, except that I halved it because I only had one cup of brown sugar. What a mistake that was, I definitely should have gotten more brown sugar first! This stuff is so good. For the sake of my waistline I should have never realized how easy it is to make delicious caramel corn. I mixed it right into the big roasting pan. Next time I will hold the popcorn in the warm oven to make mixing easier.

The longer you cook sugar, the more bitter it will taste.  I boiled this for 3 MINUTES and rather than use vanilla extract, I used rum extract for a butter rum flavor.  DELICIOUS!  And perfectly done.

Seriously Outstanding!! Follow the instructions exactly.  Notes:  1)  5 quarts of popcorn = 20 cups of popped corn.  2) I baked mine in a large stainless roasted pan and oiled the pan with canola spray first so the popcorn did not stick.  Next time I will buy disposable foil roasting pans from the dollar store (cleaner).  Most users are suggesting to use 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1 cup;  I tried this with both 1/2 cup and 1 cup and found 1 cup is easy because the mixture is thinner and easier to stir the popcorn -- but both work fine and taste amazing!  3) When you remove from oven after 1 hour stir the popcorn a few times while it is cooling to break up all the clusters.  4)  Store in ziplock bags if you are eating it yourself, but if you are giving it as gifts you can place a bunch in medium sized plastic gift bags (sold at Walmart) or buy some cute large tins from the dollar stre.  LOVE this recipe - definitely a winner for holiday gifts and you should definitely make this!! Thanks for posting and Happy Healthy Holidays!!

This taste great, I followed the recipe I used butter popcorn that I pop in the microwave, my husband love it.  When I make it next time I will use popcorn that is not butter flavor and I will use 1/2 cup of butter like a couple of the reviewers suggest.

6 Stars! 10 stars!! This is perfect as is. I do opt for slightly chewier caramel corn, so a bit less time as the recipe says. I make this for Christmas every year and people get very upset if I talk about making something else instead. I have even used the brown sugar blend of a popular sugar substitute to make this for my diabetic father. It comes out fantastic and much lower in sugar (though not sugar free).

Fantastic recipe!   I did have my pan (with the popcorn in it) in the oven while I was making the caramel.  I will say that it is super important to "boil" your caramel on medium/low heat.  As soon as it started to boil I put my timer on for 4 minutes and it came out perfectly.  I used my roaster insert to bake the the popcorn in the oven.  Rather than stirring every 15 minutes as the recipe called for, I stirred about every 5.  I had no trouble with clumps and it was a big hit in our house.  I plan on putting it in my holiday baskets next year.

This was fantastic! My TIP: When I baked it I placed the carmel covered popcorn in a single layer thus allowing it to bake evenly. Will serve with cocktails for  a sweet kickoff to our Christmas party.

The reviews aren't wrong. It's a 5 star for sure. I read many of the reviews before attempting,  and there were many useful tips. The top tips I used was to use half the butter and to use a roasting pan instead of sheet pans. Easier to mix.  I also used a cooling rack to separate out the unpopped kernels.

I make this recipe  all the  time at the request of co-workers and friends.  I make several variations, one with cheyenne pepper added for a little heat, one with almond oil,  and one with nuts & a little dark chocolate drizzle.  I'm going to attempt a dairy-free version using coconut oil instead of butter.  Wish me luck!!

I AM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT HOW FORGIVING THIS RECIPE IS! IT WAS RAINING OUT, AND I HAD PROMISED MY GRAND KIDS THAT WE WOULD MAKE CARAMEL CORN WHEN THE RAIN CAME. SEEING AS THEY ARE NOT ONE'S TO FORGET, I SOON REALIZED THAT "IMPROVISE" WAS GOING TO BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THE ONLY POPCORN I HAD ON HAND WAS POP SECRET~ MICROWAVE (EXTRA BUTTER NO LESS). WE POPPED 3 BAGS TOTAL, MADE THE REST OF THE RECIPE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN, BUT MADE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES, INSTEAD OF DRIZZLING THE CARAMEL OVER THE POPCORN, WE PUT EVERYTHING INTO A VERY LARGE TUPPERWARE CONTAINER, AND USED A LARGE WOODEN SPOON TO COMPLETELY COAT THE POPCORN BEFORE BAKING. WE ALSO BAKED THE COATED POPCORN FOR ONLY 30 MINUTES INSTEAD OF THE FULL HOUR. IT WAS BEYOND PERFECT.MY HUSBAND ATE AN ENTIRE BOWL OF IT BEFORE IT WAS EVEN BAKED.  IT WILL BE A FAMILY TRADITION FROM NOW ON. WONDERFUL:)

This is absolutely yummy. No need to EVER buy fiddle faddle or crunch n munch again! 
I cut the recipe in half and used unsalted butter then added the full recipe amount of salt. 
I can't stop eating it!!

I used only 1 stick of butter with 5 quarts of popcorn (cooked on stove using Boy Scout popcorn in a Whirley popper). I added a tablespoon of molasses (because my old recipe always added molasses) and 1 cup of nuts (pecans and almond chunks). Yes, the caramel was hard to drizzle. I used a roasting pan and metal spatula (after I started melting my plastic one!). This is SO good. I don't think I will have to worry about storage!

Love this recipe. You will definitely be better off if you use warm popcorn and mix it in a large stockpot (brown paper bag is ok too, but you have more control over the distribution of the caramel if you use a stockpot and stir it). I have made it several times and now, always comes out great. I add salted peanuts before mixing it in the stockpot right before the last "stir".

excellent. I didn't modify it, other than I made only half the caramel to start with, and it seemed like a lot, so I just made more popcorn until it was all used up.
This is probably just a matter of taste. I think the original recipe would've had much caramel for me.
Thanks. The caramel was very easy to make and work with. I'm sure we will make it again. and again...

Looked/tasted sorta off during the process, but by the time it was done it was amazingly delicious. I added some  pretzel bits and almonds and I think I am gonna gain back all the weight I lost while playing Pokeman GO this week.

This was a great recipe. Turned out crisp and flavorful. I used the tip from another reviewer and used a grocery bag to coat the popcorn. MUCH easier than stirring. You lose a little of the caramel but it works great because it doesn't pour in a trickle, but rather blobs. So I poured a 1/3, shake, 1/3, shake, etc.  Coated the pop corn great and easy cleanup just throw out the bag. I also only baked for 30 minutes and kept checking the corn after each 15 minute and found that 30 minutes was perfect for me.

This is the same recipe I have used for over twenty years except my recipe called for six quarts of popped corn.  I have always thought it was a great recipe but I think it may be even more yummy using only the five quarts so the coating is heavier.  Can't wait to try it this way.

I made one batch without stirring the caramel sauce after it came to a boil, as directed in the recipe. The sauce scorched, and I had to throw it out. I stirred he second batch I made a few times after it boiled, and it turned out great. I would have given 5 stars if the sauce hadn't burned the first time.

I made this exactly like the instructions said and it came out perfectly. Its a huge hit with my family. I also tweaked the recipe for my friends who cant have gluten or dairy products. It was easy to adjust.

this recipe is very good and easy. I use three bags of the microwave popcorn. I use the natural  flavored popcorn. But you can use any popcorn you like. I also use a disposal roasting pan that you can pickup at your local 99 cent store. I like use the pan because it is deep and will hold three bags of popcorn.

I made a few modifications for ease and taste.  I double the popcorn amount to 10 quarts.  I heat up the caramel in a large glass bowl in the microwave for 2:30, stir mixture, cook again for another 2:30, add baking soda, and stir.  I place all the popcorn into a standard size brown grocery bag.  Dump the hot caramel mix on top of the popcorn and shake the bag until popcorn is evenly covered.  Lay the wet popcorn onto baking pans in a very thin layer.  I cover the pans in tinfoil for easy clean up.  Stir every 15 for 1 hour at 250 degrees.  Store in an airtight container.  If stored for longer than a few days it becomes chewy.  Reheat at 250 degrees until warm and the crispness returns once its cools.  Enjoy!!!

I will definitely be making this again. It's delicious! Only thing I don't like is the texture. I'll be experimenting with how to get the nice glaze on it like other caramel corns.

Sooooo good.  Did not change the ingredients at all however I did only bake it for a total of 45 minutes and it was perfect!  Crispy, sweet and delicious.  The downfall was that the first batch was eaten by my husband and kids and I had to make another double batch to sneak out the the house to share for the holidays!

I added more ingredients to make it have more  caramel  then called for. Not a good idea. It went very soft and sticky. Stick to the regular ingredient and this wont happen.

I liked it a lot but felt the 250 degree oven made it over  done and too carmelized.  I lowered the oven to 200 and it worked better, the flavor was more  like good carmel.

Like others, I cut the butter in half and add a cup of roasted peanuts.  In place of 2 cups brown sugar, I use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  My wife likes the lighter flavor.  I mix the popcorn with the caramel in a large mixing bowl and then spread it onto the baking pan.  During the holidays, we mass-produce this making a full batch every 15 minutes and rotate it through our double oven.  (When people ask how was your weekend, it's fun to say, "I made 12 gallons of caramel popcorn.") 



Don't bother with non-stick cooking spray.  Yes, caramel will get all over your mixing spoons, and a little will stick to your baking pans, but sugar is very water soluble. A little hot water and soap cleans things right up.

Just made a half batch to experiment and see if it would be a good addition to the holiday line up.  It's a  winner!  Hubby went bonkers over it!  I think  I will add some peanuts or pecans for the next batch and  increase the caramel coating by 50%.  I love the caramel part and like a lot of it to coat the popcorn! Oh and thanks to the reviewers who suggested keeping the popcorn warm in the oven while making the caramel . Had no problems mixing it all together.  Used my large nonstick turkey roaster for the half batch and it all fit perfectly.

First off I ate almost an entire cooking sheet pans worth of this recipe after making!! Like other people who cut butter by half I did the same. I started out making the popcorn in a large cast iron pan not adding any butter or salt, then I followed recipe from there on and it came out incredibly good. It has a perfect crunch to it. Seems to almost melt in your mouth! Next time I make this which I know will be soon I think I am going to try adding peanuts to it and maybe bake in oven 15 minutes less. Will keep you posted on this thought. Great great recipe! Absolutely love it!!

I followed this recipe exactly. For the popcorn I used 2 bags of Orville Reddenbacher  Simply Salted. Oh! Actually I did change one thing. . Because the popcorn was salted I omitted salt from the recipe.   

This stuff is addictive! ! My husband is complaining because he can't stop eating it. It gets crunchy with slow baking and stirring.

Oh dear! I could eat the whole batch while working on setting up the rest of the Halloween decorations! 
The 1/2C butter worked well. 
I left the sauce pan on the warm burner while I mixed and switched roasting pans. The residual heat was enough to keep the caramel loose enough to pour over the remaining popcorn. 
This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this recipe every year at Halloween for at least 5 years.  Bagged it up and given it out to the little ones in our neighborhood.  It is a favorite and I have shared it with many friends.  Last year I made it up and put it in canisters for Christmas.  This one is a keeper.

So I am not a popcorn fan at all but for some reason I was craving it. So I followed the recipe as is except for 2 changes. The first thing I changed was only using half a cup of better and for the second item I changed was I switched the corn syrup for 1/4 cup all natural maple syrup. My wife and children have gone mad over this tasty treat and I will be making it again!

Great recipe! My search is over! We liked the buttery flavor but I'd consider trying it with less next time. The only thing I did differently was to omit the salt & vanilla but that didnt seem to affect the taste. Caramel corn rarely makes it to the oven here so I can't attest to the baking temp/time but it makes really wonderful sticky caramel corn!!! 

As for clean up it was really easy, just have a sink full of hot soapy water ready. Soak for a few minutes & wash away.

I love this recipe! I made it the first time as directed the second time I added peanuts I like the salty with the sweet. Make sure you use a medium saucepan when melting the ingredients the mixture does rise up and nothing is worse than cleaning a caramel mess off the stove. The hardest part about this recipe is not eating it all before it's finished.

This recipe is delicious.  I make it every year in the fall for Halloween. I also make a Christmas version with 1/4 cup corn syrup and 1/4 molasses instead of the 1/2 cup corn syrup, and add some cinnamon to make a gingerbread version. 

The only time it has not turned out well, I got lazy and did not cook the caramel long enough.  It is key to make sure it boils for a good 4 minutes, or the caramel will come out grainy and mushy.  5 minutes probably wouldn't hurt it.

This was my first attempt at caramel corn and it was a success! I like chewy caramel corn, so I only baked it for 30 minutes, but I followed all other directions as written, and it turned out wonderfully.

Fabulous and easy to make.I can't stop eating it.
I got a little confused with the reviews discussing butter. I used one cup butter which equates to 2- 1/4 pound sticks.You also need to pop 1/2 cup + (1/2 of 1/4 cup) of corn. Comes out to 5 quarts. I'm going to find a cheep air popper for this only. I found taking my pans out of the oven and dumping into a large bowl, allowed me to break up the corn and mixes it well. The one hour works well.
Another thing, I kept the plain corn hot in the oven after removing the ol'maids. Drizzling the caramel on the warm corn was easy and it coated well. Thanks to all for the great reviews.

This recipe was amazing! I had never made caramel popcorn before and this was super easy! I used a dark brown quality sugar, kept it on a very low boil and didn't have a problem but I will try the light brown sugar next time.I used an air popper for the popcorn.
I want to put this is "Bulk Barn" party bags for my daughter's wedding. Anyone know how long it will stay fresh?
Great recipe Brian!!!

I FOLLOWED THIS RECIPE AND AFTER COOKING THE SAUCE FOR FOUR MINUTES, IT WOULDN'T "DRIZZLE" ON THE CORN.  IT POURED IN THICK CLUMPS.  THEN IT WOULDN'T MIX INTO ALL OF THE POPCORN.  BAKING IT SEEMS FUTILE AT THIS POINT.  IT'S ALREADY OVERCOOKED.  I'LL STICK TO THE MARSHMALLOW RECIPE OR THE ONE WITH SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK NEXT TIME.

I modified this by adding a cup of broken mini-pretzels and a half-cup of pecans to my halved recipe. DELICIOUS! The amount you add is arbitrary so have fun!

Why 4 stars?.. Length of time to make this. Had an emergency "What's for desert" last night and all signs pointed to Caramel Corn. I only left it in the oven for 15min since everyone wanted it right away. If you don't do the full-bake, it will still be delicious but the corn won't be crisp (adding the nuts and pretzels made up for this.).

Made a half batch in my roaster, used .33c butter for the half-batch, based on other reviews on cutting it down.  Tasted.....well-cooked, almost burnt?  Maybe need to bake less. Will have to change something, as I was not wowed.

We make this all the time. The only differences I make are to add a couple of tablespoons of molasses to the corn syrup and I add about 2 cups is peanuts to the popcorn. This makes it taste just like cracker jacks! My whole family loves it! I make it all the time for family get togethers. It's so good. Make it, see for yourself!! :)

I've made this three times now (working on my third batch right now!) and I absolutely love it!  I use two bags of Homestyle microwave popcorn per batch and then sift it afterwards to get the kernels and stuff out.  I followed the ingredients/directions as written and had no issues. I did make a batch with chopped up pecans mixed in and it also received good reviews from my family.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious!  I liked it even better before I baked it, when it was still gooey.  I made it for a party and my family is trying to talk me into letting them eat it all and make another batch for the party.

Use only 1/2 cup of margarine. 1/2 cup of uncooked kernals=5 qrts.  Add pecans and peanuts. Bake at 200F for 40 mins. Stir every 2-3 mins when out of oven to prevent clumping. Be sure to spray pan first to prevent sticking.

I followed this recipe exactly and my caramel ended up being really thick. It hardened as soon as it hit the popcorn which prevented me from being able to coat all of the popcorn. Now I'm left with one big pan of popcorn and a couple of clumps of caramel. Hoping to try and salvage some of it by making popcorn balls.

I've made this 3 times now and it's amazing, the only thing I wish I knew the first time was to spread it on parchment paper after it comes out of the oven, then let it cool. The directions said to let cool completely then break apart but I lost 1/4 of my caramel corn to the pan. I've used Light and dark brown sugar and they're both good but I prefer the dark.

I followed the directions and used 1 tip.  I heated the popcorn up before adding the caramel. I was asked to add chocolate peanuts so I added chocolate and peanuts to one. The other I melted chocolate and stirred peanuts. Then I added them to the popcorn. You could probably add the peanuts to the caramel then add it and chocolate to the popcorn. One thing I recommend is to put the popcorn on wax paper to cool. Makes it much easier!

I use the same or similar recipe and have for years, its very yummy.  I am not understanding one comment about using only 1/2 a pound of butter, 1 cup is half a pound..

Great recipe but this is how I coat my corn: get the largest turkey baking bag they sell, and get on your garden gloves! Put corn in bag, pour syrup over, quickly twist bag shut, and turn over and over until coated with gloves on to prevent burns. Enjoy this delectable recipe!

HOLY MOLY!!!! This stuff is ADDICTIVE!!!! My husband and I purchased a Nostalgia Electrics Popcorn maker and dispenser for the holidays. We were really wanting some carmel popcorn and we decided to just make our own! Found this recipe, and decided to give it a try because of all the wonderful reviews it had! Well we were not disappointed at all!!! We added chopped pecans to ours to make it our own! I sprayed the pans with non-stick cooking spray also. We had already had dinner that night and we were so full, but we could not stop eating it!!! My opinion, its better the next day after it has had a chance to cool completely and get that crunchy texture which I absolutely ADORE!!! This christmas I will be making tons of this popcorn and sending it to my family members!! Thank you to whoever shared this AWESOME, DELICIOUS recipe!!

I loved it.  So easy and so good.  The only thing I would change would be to put the caramel popcorn on parchment paper to cool, as it stuck to the baking sheets.

I ended up making two batches of this recipe today. I altered the serving size just a bit so I could use my hot air corn popper. Two batches of popcorn made 12 cups so I increased the recipe size. I did cut back on the butter by about half....left the remaining ingredients the same.  The second batch I made I threw in some pecans, almonds and peanuts for variety. I have to say its absolutely delicious. Other than cutting back on the butter, I wouldn't change a thing.  Oh....i didn't warm my popcorn before coating with the caramel and it seemed pretty good. Also, 250 degrees seemed to work well also. I did alter the pans from top to bottom rack every 15 minutes as I stirred so that may have helped some. Recommend for sure!!

I kept turning it every 15 min like it said. Breaking it up, I should have done something different than what it said.  like putting it on a screen / baking sheet so the excess will go off. because some were more carmel than.  other than that it tasted good to me. I haven't made it since my boys were little, they are grown now. maybe 15 yrs... NOT cracker Jacks but a nice treat..

When I make this I like to mix in 20 or so fun size twix candy bars n mix them through. My husband and especially my 4 yr old daughter love it. This is the exact recipe for the caramel I use when I make mine EXCEPT, I DON'T put ANY vanilla extract in it AT ALL!!!  The extract makes a huge difference in the taste I the caramel n makes it taste very cheap n store bought. Takes away from the wonderful homemade taste n makes it taste disgusting in my opinion. Best to make it both ways and decide go yourself, however if u make it exactly as the recipe calls for, just omit the vanilla extract, it tastes amazing!!!! I do not cut down on the butter. I make it exactly as written just leave out the extract n it is by far the best caramel popcorn I've ever tried. I would just suggest not drizzling with melted chocolate if u add candy bars. Makes it too rich. Leave out the extract and I would DEFINITELY give it 5 stars!

Love this recipe...here's my twist to it...I added molasses instead of corn syrup plus I added a cup of Quarter Original Granola cereal to my popcorn mix then drizzled the caramel sauce with the combo then stir in the mix

My family love this! Thanks!

Add a pinch of cream of tarter at the very end (after boiling, right before adding popcorn) to make it set up perfectly.

TOTALLY...TOTALLY...IN L-O-V-E! I followed other reviews and only used 1/2 of the butter and left out the vanilla and that worked out much better. I used another post for the popcorn and mixed them together in a large baking dish. My husband and daughter request this every weekend for our movie nights. Thanks for the post!

I'm sure it will be good once we are able to finish it... do NOT boil the caramel mixture- it will burn your house down!  Seriously though, you have to find the perfect temperature because the caramel boils at like a simmer- we learned this the hard way (the directions suggest boiling) really- this means simmer...

Perfect recipe! I never rate recipes but registered specifically to rate this one. I didn't change a thing (except to add almonds), I don't know what went wrong for some of the other reviewers but I wouldn't change anything, just follow the directions and it turns out perfectly. Huge hit at work! Never knew caramel popcorn was so easy!

Absolutely loved it! We don't use microwave popcorn anymore, since I got my husband a stovetop popcorn popper for Christmas. I recommend white, not yellow, popcorn. When it came to pouring the caramel mixture over the corn I at first I thought I had done it wrong because my caramel was too thick to pour over popcorn in a "thin stream". But I mixed it well and baked as directed. Turned out very well. This is a keeper.

One tip is that after you pop the corn, shake the bowl to help settle the few unpopped kernels.  Then carefully using your hands scoop up the popped corn into another bowl, trying not to disturb what has settled to the bottom.  I trash the uppopped and small hard popped corn along with the husks that have fallen to the bottom of the bowl.  I pop into an 8qt bowl then scoop into a 5qt, once that's filled I then pour it all back into the 8qt for mixing.  Also you can reuse the parchment paper several times.  I have been using this recipe for several years to rave reviews.  I have co-workers trying to convince me to package and sell it!

Really good. Decreased butter by half and didn't miss it. Made half the batch in the microwave as other reviewers suggested and it turned out just as good with less time and less mess. I only make this every few months as it is totally addictive!

This was delicious.  I have to admit, that thanks to many interruptions from my young children, I neglected to add the baking soda and vanilla after boiling the caramel.  It still turned out amazing.  Next time, I'll try the vanilla, and see if it tastes much different.  The kids ate it so fast that I don't think they would be able to tell a difference.  I cooked for 40 minutes, to keep it a bit chewy, and it was perfect!

Great caramel corn recipe. I've used it with half the butter and the full amount of butter. The taste is good with half the butter, but the caramel covers better with the full amount.

this stuff is AMAZING!! I used 1 2/3 cup dark brown sugar and 1/3 white suga also 6 quarts or popcorn rather than 5. It was more than enough caramel to cover all the popcorn. 

I kept my popcorn warm in the oven (250) while making the caramel. I also added peanuts. Once the caramel was added in I only baked for 15 minutes. The result? A nice balance of crunch and chew. 

The only difference I'll make next time, and believe me there will be MANY next times with this recipe, is have someone else stir the caramel in. It killed my arm.

Easy and great.... 

I put my popcorn in the lid of my roasting pan. I than measure out the pieces with my hands shaking out any unpopped kernels into the bottom (pam sprayed).
 
I than pour the caremel right ontop in the roasting pan and mix with a big wooden spoon. i put the lid in, shove it in a 200 degree oven for one hour (lid on) . every 15 minutes I take it out and give it a stir which makes makes it break up nicely. Nice and crunchy and shiney

I have tried the half cup and full cup of butter. both are good, although the full cup of butter does coat better.

Because my granddaughter is allergic to dairy products I made this using coconut oil.  I only used a half cup as suggested by other reviews.  It was delicious. Scary delicious. Addictive delicious! Trying to think of an excuse to make more, as it was gone all too soon.

The recipe is awesome. Did not change anything. Made it last year (2011) and this holiday season (2012). Everyone loved it.

I made it again this Christmas season, 2014. Totally awesome and requests for the recipe. Does not last long! vjles

This is a fabulous recipe and recommend it to anyone.  My family found it a bit too sweet so we are now using 3/4 of the recommended brown sugar but keeping everything else the same (including the corn syrup).  This seems to be the perfect blend for our liking.

Turned out great! The mixture was just right for two cups of home-popped popcorn. Although, I suggest shaving 15 minutes off the total cooking time. My whole family loved it, and it will definitely be a do-over! Great recipe.

This recipe actually worked!  I did change the butter amount like many others.  I used one stick of butter and one tablespoon of margarine.  I also added peanuts to my mix to make cracker jax like goodness.  For people who are in a rush to get their fix I think it would be ready to go after 30 minutes....Well I am a satisfied cooker with this recipe.

Delicious!  I've made this twice now in the past week.  The first time I tried what others recommended and used half the butter, it was too thick to me to spread throughout the popcorn.  Tonight I used 3/4 c butter (50% more) and it was perfect...spread easily onto both pans of popcorn.  This recipe is definitely going onto my Pinterest board.  Love it!

I make caramel popcorn every year to give as gifts as Christmas. This year my recipe was MIA, so I came here to find another. This one looked the same so I read a few reviews and gave it a try. I reduced the butter by about 1/4 cup and otherwise followed the directions. After 15 minutes in the oven, I threw the whole batch out. The caramel was crumbly and the popcorn just tasted like popcorn and brown sugar. Yuck! I read a few more reviews, then tried again using the full cup of butter and *name brand* brown sugar. I think the generic sugar I used the first time really screwed up how the first batch turned out. My second try was a success! Smooth caramel and so, so tasty! This is exactly the caramel popcorn that my family waits for every Christmas. A tip that might be helpful... I buy the disposable lasagna trays that come in a pack of 2 for about $3. I split the popcorn up between the two pans and drizzle the caramel over the top. The high sides of these pans makes mixing a cinch.

This is really really good ... I used (2) four cup prepackaged corn and both sticks of butter. I definitely used the paper bag, that was REALLY helpful. I'm standing here now eating the tray that wouldn't fit in the oven. It's rich and has wonderful flavor!

Used microwave buttery popcorn - Orville! Absolutely perfect! Made this for an animal shelter bake sale!! Everyone who tried it could not get enough and insisted on having the recipe! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this, trust me follow the directions as stated and you will not be disappointed! :)

Mine is in the oven right now and so far the pieces I've snitched are SSSSsssssooooooooo good!!  Very easy to make!  I used 30 cups of popcorn and for the 15 minute stirrings I just dumped the popcorn back in my orginal mixing bowl, stirred it up and put it back on the backing sheet for the rest of the baking time.  Yummy!!!!!!!  I can't wait to add nuts and try other variations!!

I make this all the time and we just love it.  Dont bake it on a metal cookie sheet as this was the only time it burned, I use my stoneware cake pan which is deep enough to mix it in.  Also Only cook for half the time if you like the gooey caramel, otherwise the caramel perfectly coats the popcorn just like the store-bought stuff which is also good but I prefer the gooey :)

This is very tasty. I do have one helpful suggestion though: spread the popped popcorn out onto your baking pans and then drizzle the Caramel sauce, mix, and bake. This will alleviate the mixing bowl step (when the popcorn and Caramel sauce can be mixed in the pan), and because it is spread out into two pans before mixing, the sauce is more evenly distributed. I did this the second time I made this and it was awesome-and with less clean-up!

We quartered the saucy stuff, and it was just as good, if a little sweet. Very good!! I suggest dipping in wasabi, or eating inside a taco.

Everyone LOVES this when I make it.  Not too hard, just takes time, but doesn't last after it's done.  I've made it three times now.  Once I didn't boil for 4 minutes by mistake and it still turned out with rave reviews.

This recipe is fool proof.  I forgot half of the ingredients (salt, baking soda, vanilla) and it still turned out delicious.  I am excited to try it again with all the ingredients.  Happy Cooking!

Delicious, classic, fail proof! I would advise using popcorn that is not butter flavor. The caramel coating will stick much better to plain old popped popcorn!

This recipe is absolute yum! The caramel is easy is to make and seemed fool-proof (which is amazing to me, as I have messed up caramel in the past)! I halved the recipe and am already regretting that I did that, which is sad bc the popcorn is still baking!! (plus, I keep stealing bits when I go to stir the popcorn).   I listened to past reviews and oiled the pot that I used for mixing (I had to use my largest pot bc I didn't have a bowl big enough). Also, I am baking the popcorn in a large non-stick pan with high sides, which is working nicely.    this is a must make.

I followed others advice. Make sure you use a wooden spoon, metal will get too hot and sugar will melt plastic. I reduced butter to 1 stick (make sure you use real butter NOT margarine or spread). Took brown sugar down to 1 1/4 cup. I popped the popcorn in clarified butter (3/4 cup unpopped) on stove to give a richer nuttier flavor. Weed out the unpopped kernels and keep the popcorn warm in oven and spray whatever you are mixing popcorn/caramel in with non-stick cooking spray. I lined cookie sheets with parchment paper. Make sure you raise your oven racks a little higher and stir every 15 minutes or the caramel will get too dark and burnt taste. I only cooked for 45 minutes and cracked some sea salt over cooling popcorn to balance the sweet. Clean up was easy and the popcorn was delicious!

Made the mistake of scaling back the recipe to about a quarter of the original...don't do that.  You won't have enough, even if it is just you and another person and you have already had a full meal.

When ever we want caramel popcorn this is the one we make. It reminds of the Karmal Korn that used to be in the mall

So delicious. A huge hit at the house. I line the baking dishes with parchment paper for easy clean-up and find that dark brown sugar has a stronger flavor but burns quicker.

The only word that can be used to describe this popcorn is YUMMY!  I made it for the neighbors for Christmas and it was a big hit.  I mixed it up in my (clean) sink because I didnt have a bowl that was big enough to hold all of the popcorn without making a mess everywhere.  Keep it in a tupperware contanier and it will stay fresh and crunchy for a week!

I have made this recipe about 5 or 6 times now.  Each time I get compliment after compliment. It is so easy and amazingly good.  I will never pay for caramel corn again.   I have tried the recipe as is and have also tried the suggestion of 1/2 the butter.  In my opinion, there is no need for more than 1/2 cup of butter.  It was still just as good and actually found it to be less greasy.   It is becoming a staple comfort treat in my house!

The best, most addictive stuff ever invented!  Do spray the pan first with cooking spray and bake in a turky pan so it's easy to stir.  I also added a cup  of chopped mixed nuts, they stick better if they're chopped up first.

This was delicious.  Followed the recipe as is but with half the butter and a brown sugar Splenda blend.  Used 94% fat free Kettle Corn flavored popcorn.  Next time I will try it in the microwave as some suggested.

It was delicious! My husband used to be a chef so I let him make the caramel since he knows what to do more than I do. It turned out fantastic. I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl!

AWESOME recipe!!!   This was my very first time making caramel popcorn, and I was a bit intimidated at first with the whole process, but it turned out perfect! So perfect that I had to hide the batch while it cooled so that my family wouldn't eat it all!!   I followed the recipe as is and baked for only 45 mins (as recommended by a previous review) and the caramel coating came out nice and crispy! I will try using only 1/2 a cup of butter next time. For the popcorn, I used 1 1/2 cups uncooked popcorn, airpopped. My kitchen smelled like a day at the fair - SO YUMMY!!! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I recommend using 2 bags of store bought Chester's Puffcorn it is reasonably healthy and no husks. Also, buy a $3 aluminum turkey pan and spray with no stick. You will love this!

The hardest part of this was stirring it (besides trying not to "test" the popcorn) because I have carpel tunnel and my hands got tired.  I packaged several baggies with the popcorn to mail to friends in Afghanastan and they loved it!  The second time I made it I added peanuts; it reminded me of cracker jacks!  I'll definitely make this again.

It was good, very well covered, but following the directions it was all separate kernels not clumps. I prefer clumps. It probably was something to do with my stirring it.

I read many reviews before starting. I cut the butter to 1/2 cup as suggested.  I used three bags of store brand homestyle microwave popcorn. Keeping the popcorn warm while making the caramel is a good tip,  as it makes it easier to combine.  Also be sure to pick out all the unpopped corn.  This popcorn is delicious. It is so worth making. Yummy.

Really nice. I reduced the butter and it turned out great. I only kept it in the oven for 30 min or so.. the caramel kept burning. But it came out nice and chewy. Thanks for the recipe.

Edited to add:  You CAN make this recipe for people watching their sugars.  I did a batch today with half brown sugar & half Splenda, and it came out very well -- but it hardens in less than HALF the time of sugar - so I burned the first pan.  About 20 minutes would have been right, with at least one stir.

I was very worried about putting baking soda in, and when it started to foam up over the side of the little saucepan it freaked me out.  But this was EXCELLENT.  The coating didn't soak into the popcorn the way that others have, and it baked up perfectly crispy.  I should have baked it a little less, as some of it got a 'burnt sugar' flavor beyond what I like.  But the remainder was absolutely perfect.  Next time, I'll try cutting the butter a bit as others suggested, and will limit my bake time to 45 min or so.  We did pan-popped popcorn, and popped just before boiling the coating, so the popcorn was all still warm when we poured the coating on -- poured it directly on in the pans and stirred with a silicone spatula, stirred while baking the same way, and didn't need to break it up much at all.

Great recipe - make sure and use white popcorn and bake in SHALLOW pans as suggested. I put the whole batch in a large disposable roasting pan and it was too chewy. I made another batch and divided on cookie/jellyroll pans and it was nice and crispy!!

Just like my mom use to make.  All the other reviews were very helpful.  1/2 the butter, use a roasting pan, keep the popcorn warm before mixing and greese the pan.

This recipe is excellent.  I doubled it and used 6 bags of microwave "homestyle" popcorn.  It was the perfect ratio of syrup to popcorn.  Also, I add a little almond extract to pretty much any butter candy recipe...gives it a little something different! :0)

I love the recipe I did use 1/2 the butter and sure enough it's plenty. I added extra salt; a chef at a fancy winery in the Sonoma Valley gave me that hot tip in making caramel corn.  Also only baked mine 20mins (by my moms advise).  Perfect!

This is an excellent recipe, it worked out perfectly but I also warmed to popcorn in the oven for a few minutes, it helps when mixing the caramel. And I also added butter toffee peanuts to mine, it was delicious...

This is the same caramel corn recipe I've been finding everywhere. I'm using it, it's great, but it's a shame the author couldn't do us the favor of using CUPS consistently throughout the measurements, rather than switching to QUARTS and sending us on a conversion-hunt.

this recipe is awesome! everyone always raves! I do cut the butter by half and it works just as well. I always free up the popcorn before I let it cool otherwise it sticks to the sides and the fragile popcorn breaks.

Make it just like it is, except, scour your kitchen sink and dry.  pour popcorn into sink and add caramel.  Mix there and then you only have to clean your sink with hot water.  No extra pan!!

This is so good and yet so bad all at the same time.  Great Recipe!  I'll be making this for a Christmas party I'll be hosting in a few weeks, and plan to keep the caramel exactly the same.  I think if I ever make it again for us, I'll lower the sugar and butter. The only thing I changed was that I broke apart the popcorn to have individual pieces rather than clumped.  So yummy!

great recipe, thanks for sharing. Rich and buttery, but not greasy. I find that mixing popcorn in two batches works great, since I don't have a bowl large enough, as well as it makes it easier to ensure great coverage.

This is a HUGE hit every time I make it.  I've tried it with full butter and half butter and it wasn't missed.  Word of advice...have a very big pan to churn it in!  I've used home popped and microwave popcorn.  This recipe is good either way.

This was good. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter down to 1/2 cup. I only cooked this for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes and it got kind of grainy. I think next time I will stop at 30 minutes. Otherwise it does still taste good and I enjoyed it!

This was awesome! I made it with my 4 year old who is always wanting to "make recipes" with me. Only baked for about 30 minutes because the rest of the family was stealing it from the pan every time I took it out to stir anyway so I just gave up and said go for it.  It was perfect this way!

I used three bags of popcorn and the same amount of caramel sauce and it turned out great, but I like my popcorn completely covered in crunchy caramel.  I can't wait to make this again!  Next time I think I'll add honey roasted peanuts.

Dude...this stuff is to die for.  Every time I make this recipe, I'm treated like some sort of culinary goddess.  I've made it with the suggested amount of butter as well as the halved amount (per other reviewers' suggestions) and no one could tell the difference.  Also, this caramel corn is just asking to have nuts added to it...they make it even better!  I've used cashews and dry roasted peanuts, and both were delicious.

I love my whirley-pop popcorn, but I don't measure and sometimes get things a little too salty. This is our favorite way to "rescue" the popcorn. So much so, that my husband has asked me to over-salt a batch just so I'd make this again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

WONDERFUL RECIPE!  I've made this about a dozen times now and it always turns out great.  I usually halve the recipe and use 2.5 bags of extra butter microwave popcorn.  I also only bake for about 15 minutes because I usually have several kids breathing down my neck.  DELICIOUS!

This popcorn was really good. It tasted like a Cracker Jack version and I think I may add peanuts next time to make it exactly like Cracker Jack. I followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely keep this one!

This recipe is pretty darn awesome. The only reason it wasn't perfect is because I messed it up! Remember everybody, oven temps and times vary. But it still tasted great and everyone ate it all. So no complaints. I'll try it again and keep my eye on it...

I have never made caramel popcorn before and thought it would be difficult but this recipe is simple. It tastes just like Kernels, or even better! I used two bags of microwave plain popcorn and it was just the right amount.  I am going to make this all the time. Very addicting! Excellent recipe.

Delectable! Surprisingly easy and oh so delicious.  We made the recipe exactly as written; made another batch with the addition of pecans; and yet another batch using the brown paper bag method of mixing the popcorn and caramel mixture together.   The most difficult part of the recipe is following the last instruction, "Let cool completely..."

This is excellent popcorn! Definitely a keeper. I made some tonight with my 8 year old son, and needless to say, all of my kids enjoyed it. We used 2 bags of popcorn and I found that to be just enough to use for this recipe. I also did not add salt because I thought it would be overkill with the popcorn being salted already. Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly. 5 stars!

This has proven to be great no matter how I alter the instructions. This time I did not have baking soda or vanilla. I substituted the vanilla for about 1/8 cinnamon & about 1/16th each of ginger & cloves. It was great! I even burnt the caramel the first time I made it, and my husband didn't even notice!

I used three bags of microwave popcorn and it appeared to not be caramel-coated enough...but that didn't stop everyone from scarfing down every kernel!  It tasted fantastic and is some addictive stuff that I'll be making again!  Next time I may decrease the popcorn to 2 1/2 bags.  Great recipe!!

The best caramel popcorn ever!!! Everyone raves about it when I make it for them. I did follow the advice of other posters and cut the butter in half. It tastes better than any caramel corn from a popcorn store!!! Thank you for the recipe!

Used 4 bags of microwave popcorn to make this, don't worry when you make the caramel, looks like there is not enough but when it starts baking it melts all over, big hit with my son's hockey team!

Great popcorn!!!  I cut this in half and because I was just making it for my family I skipped the baking.  I just stuck it in the freezer for about 5 min for it to cool and it was great...very chewy, which I loved.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

I make this for my husband all the time and he says it like "gold" to him.  I always hated having to hang around the kitchen and stir every 15 minutes, so last night I experimented.  I turned the oven to 225, put the popcorn in for 30 minutes, stirred, and put it in for another 30 minutes, and then took it out.  It was perfect!  You do have to let it dry a tad bit more to get the crunch, but within 10 minutes after cooking, it tasted just like to original way of cooking it.  I give this to friends for Christmas, and they said they couldn't stop eating it!  Also, we use the popcorn that you cook over the stove (Orville Redenbacher) and it tastes fantastic- and way cheaper than getting it in a bag.  I cook the popcorn while the caramel is boiling for the 4 minutes so the popcorn is nice and hot when I mix the two.

Really good. A great gift treat for friends too. I have to be careful when I make it because I eat too much of it. Definetly blows the eating plan in a hurry. Share with friends.

Oh my gawwwd!!!!! I don't know what I really expected but despite the rave reviews and my deep rooted affection for all things caramel, the final product knocked my socks off! I will never buy caramel corn again.....NEVER! These little crunchy clouds of caramelized goodness have me saying to heck with the butter, I'll just have to rock my hip hop abs with a caramel corn butt!    I started with half cup butter, but at boiling time it looked a wee bit too thick so I added the second stick.   Seriously mix, boil, pour, dry. It's that simple, and even without nonstick spray (I missed a pan)it cleans up with a quick set in some hot water. I'm a pigpen cook (flour on the cabinet doors and in my hair every time I prep a pan)....my kitchen is still clean!  This is now and probably forever my favorite recipe. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Very Good! I live in Turkey now so its difficult to find corn syrup so I substituted it for honey. It turned out great, but tasted a little burnt to me... Maybe because I burnt some popcorn- I dont know.

THis is delicious! I halfed the recipe using one bag of microwave popcorn, added roasted peanuts, and hubby couldn't wait until it cooled completely! Once it did cool... OMG! It really needs the full one hour in the oven. We had taken some out after the third stir and it just clung to our teeth. We will definitely be making this fairly often, and great for get-togethers with family and friends.

Awful.  Not enough caramel to cover 5 quarts of popcorn.  I followed the directions exactly.  Awful.  Will not try this again.  What exactly is a "shallow" baking dish for this much popcorn.  I don't know about the rest of you buy my oven will not hold two "shallow" baking dishes for this much popcorn.  I wasted a bunch of pecans, not to mention some really good brown sugar on this recipe.

I've made this popcorn twice now, and it is very addicting! I've really only made one adjustment - the first time I made it I began baking as directed and the popcorn started getting really dry, especially after the 45 minute stir. The second time I made it I followed the review to up the temp to 300 degrees and bake for 20 minutes (stirring half-way) and that worked great! Enjoy!

I only used a half cup of butter and it was great. My family loved it!

Absolutely awesome! Just the combination of flavors that I love. Usually after making once, I play around with the recipe. I haven't touched this one. Thanks!

This is a classic recipe. I too have made a similar version for years and it always turns out yummy. (Our dogs go nuts for it too!) Like some other reviewers, i also cut the amount of butter in half and it still rocks. Sometimes i add a little almond extract or cinnamon oil in addition to the vanilla to mix things up a bit. Habanero or cayenne is also good mixed in with the caramel (before mixing with the popcorn) for adventurous fellow chile heads!

This recipe is the best!  I've been making this recipe for many years and everyone who taste it want the recipe!  I also add whatever nuts I have on hand, i.e., cashews.  Don't be intimidated to try it, as it's so easy!  To make clean-up a breeze, spray Pam on the baking sheets and the utensils used to mix the popcorn.  Because it goes so fast, I've been "1 1/2x' ing" the recipe.  Storing it in airtight canisters keeps it fresher longer.

Thank you for this recipe!  I just made it for the staff at my school to celebrate popcorn day and it was a huge hit!  I would recommend using a LARGE saucepan to make the caramel, because it really grows when you add the baking soda and vanilla at the end.  I will be making this one over and over again!

This is a great recipe! I made it for gifts this year and everyone loved it.  I think I didn't boil one of the batches long enough though because it didn't get quite as crunchy as I would have liked. It still tasted good though!

We loved it. I used 3 bags of Orville Redenbacher's microwave popcorn and it tasted just fine. I also tossed in some almonds.

I used to make a similar recipe but as I couldn't find it and after reading the rave reviews on this, I thought I'd make some for coworkers. I am arbitrarily giving this 3* as I don't know how it really should come out.  I don't usually make microwave popcorn, but knew it would be easier. I tried to find natural ~ old fashioned microwave popcorn as another reviewer recommended,but all I found were flavored ones. So, I decided I would pop my own.  But, how much?  Somewhere, a reader said 2 cups kernels.  WRONG! I had my roaster pan plus 2 lasagna pans full, but not enough syrup.  After wasting a couple of hours & $ on ingredients, I ended up re wrapping the holiday bowls  for next year. I'm really disappointed as I now do not have time to start w/ something else.  Next time, microwave!!

Best caramel corn I have ever made. I made a double batch and added 1 1/2 C. of whole almonds. Warm the popcorn in oven for a few min. prior to pouring on caramel. Excellent!

I thought this recipe was very good. The only thing that I will do differently next time will be to reduce the time in the oven to 15 minutes. It cooked for 30 minutes and had a burnt taste to it, even though I stirred it twice. Very good otherwise.

Never a morsel left when I bring this to get togethers. I use the salted popcorn, but without butter. The salt mixes with the sweet of the carmel perfectly. Friends can't get enough!

This was pretty tasty without going in the oven (I was too impatient to wait). The caramel had a great taste even though I cut down the butter. My only complaint was that the caramel was EXTREMELY chewy after it cooled, almost too hard to eat. This might be a result of not baking the popcorn in the oven. Because of this reason, I would recommend cooking in the oven (I will try this next) if it is going to last though the night.

I didn't put the popcorn in the oven after I put the caramel on, my mother had never done this and so I decided not to, and it turned out just the way she had always made it, so yummy and chewy, it makes you want to eat the whole thing!

This makes the best caramel popcorn I've ever tasted (better than the gourmet stuff you can buy from the mall)!  The only change I made was to add roasted peanuts and I think next time I'll try pecans! I also suggest stirring the popcorn every 15 minutes while baking to ensure that it doesn't clump. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Loved it! I wish I would've used a larger pot...my medium pot must not be that big and it made a big mess. So I would make sure to use a large enough pot...I will defenitely make this again but not very often since I couldn't stop eating it!

This was a huge hit at our Halloween party this year!  It was a surprisingly easy clean-up.  I have never responded to any recipe, but I had to on this one!!

I made this last night for a pumpkin carving party...and everybody loved it!  I loved that it was soo simple to make and had only a small mess to clean up later.  I wasn't sure how much 5 quarts was supposed to be, so I guessed and used three bags of lite microwave popcorn.  It was the perfect amount.  I also wanted my popcorn to be a little chewier and so I took it out 15 minutes sooner, but it still ended up being crunchy.

This is a really good recipe.  I make it all the time.  We usually can't wait for the whole baking time but don't worry, it still tastes great if your children (or guests) demand you pull it out early.  It happens almost every time in our house.

This is a five star for taste, but I tried one reviewer's easy way and microwaved the caramel popcorn instead of baking it. The taste is delicious, but I like my caramel popcorn crunchy. My kids love it! Next time, I'll bake it in the oven for the crunch factor. Thanks for a great recipe. Will surely make over and over again.

I didn't love this recipe, it seemed too 'sugary'. On the other hand, my guests loved it and raved about it. I would definitely recommend adding some sort of nuts to help balance out how sweet the caramel is.

Wow!  I had to give away the rest of this because I was eating so much.  I had tried caramel popcorn that other people have made and was unimpressed.  This, however, is out of this world.  It tastes like popcorn that you would get at a popcorn shop or at a fair.  I didn't change a thing.

No doubt this has amazing flavor but I find that it is hard to pour all the carmal mixture in before it hardens making it hard to stir.

Man - O - Man, this is SO good!  I love this recipe!  I did cut the butter down to 1/2 a cup, and microwaved it in a brown grocery bag as suggested for 4 intervals of 30 seconds.  That is so much easier than an hour in the oven.  We end up eating so much we're stuffed.  Since the average rating is 5 stars out of over 750 reviews, you can't go wrong on this one.  Great for a party or movie night!

This turned out perfectly!  So yummy and addicting.  Had people over to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympics and the whole batch was gone by the end.  So so good.  The only complaint that I have is that its pretty messy to make... hot sugar everywhere!  Definitly use a BIG bowl for mixing the caramel.

Just made this again today- i drizzled it with the caramel, but didnt even bother to put it in the oven - and it was perfectly crunchy-chewy consistency!...............MY HEAVENS!!! this is a pregnant woman's DELIGHT!!!!
i like my popcorn only "drizzled with caramel" (not covered/drenched LOL)
i used 4 bags of microwaved 3.5 oz bags of popcorn... it was PERFECT!! next time i'll try 2 bags, and only half the recipe...
was hard to stop eating it as i was putting it in the baking sheets!!!!
THANK YOU FOR SHARING SUCH A DELIGHT!!

This recipe is great. I have used it numerous times since finding it a month ago. I don't even buy caramel popcorn anymore. This is the first caramel popcorn recipe that I've used and it will the last. 

Also great with Pecans added.

I took the tips of all the other reviewers--half the butter, spray the pan & utensils, etc.  The only thing I disagree with is adding the nuts later.  They didn't get incorporated with the popcorn. I have a stomach ache from eating so much--I couldn't stop!

This came out excellent.  Very easy to make just be sure to have everything laid out in advance.  I used a large roasting pan to hold the popcorn and bake it in the oven. The higher sides of the roasting pan it made stirring it easier.  

For the popcorn I used a microwave oven popcorn popper.  The one we have takes 1/2 popcorn kernels and 2 minutes 20 seconds to pop up a batch.  It took two batches to make enough popcorn for the recipe.  This was less expensive than using plain microwave popcorn and easier than popping it on the stove.

There was just the right amount of caramel to cover all of the popcorn well.  This will definitely become a regular at our house.

One Word--Amazing!  If I could rate it more, I would.  I made this as a snack to eat during my son's baseball games and everyone loved it.  It was super easy to make.  We kept licking the spoons and spatulas once we made up a pan.  I used air-popped popcorn by Orville Redenbacher and it turned out very well.  I also used light brown suger and light corn syrup, since the recipe didn't specify.  I think it just made the color lighter.  This is one recipe I will be making for years for many different occassions.  

Make this and I promise you will not be disappointed.  Simply wonderful!

Also excellent to add pecans to this! And I used Aunt Jemima's pancake syrup instead of corn syrup, was excellent.

This was the best popcorn. I took half of the caramel popcorn and covered it with milk chocolate. Plus added pretzels to the mix. It was so good. Must try it.

My guests (teenagers) and I LOVED this popcorn!  I only used 1/2c. butter and it was fine.  We were too impatient to cook it the whole hour so only did about 35 mins and it was still crunchy and perfect!  Not sure why you'd need to bake it so long.  However, if you make it as written it makes a HUGE mess in your kitchen.  One pot, a huge bowl, and at least two cookie sheets covered in sticky caramel mess that has to be scrubbed off.  Not fun!  I will make this again, but will try the paper bag method suggested by another viewer or use a disposable roasting pan!  Thank you!

I have never before rated a recipe, but this one turned out soo well that I had to. The popcorn has such a great flavor to it. I can't stop eating it! Very good recipe. Would definitely recommend to everyone!

This was good.  I preferred the taste of it before I baked it.  After baking, the caramel flavor was still there, but I thought it kind of tasted like the popcorn was stale (I had just popped it).  Probably won't bake it next time, though I'm not sure if there will be any repercussions to doing that.  Also, I'll throw in some peanuts.

Caramel recipe is good and simple. But it was way too much for us--made the popcorn too sweet. Once I doubled the amount of popcorn, much better.

This is my first time making caramel popcorn. I just finished baking my last batch, whew! It's quite a process but well worth it and your family or friends will love it. (I hope) I tried using only 1/2 cup butter and the caramel was really thick and hard to mix with the popcorn. Using 1 cup butter is easier to mix with, the appearance is better and you can make more. Thanks!

I microwaved the ingredients for four minutes...watch carefully for bubbling over,then poured this on warm fresh popcorn. Left in the oven for almost an hour then truned the oven off. Great and easy!

This recipes yields perfect caramel popcorn every time... I love it! I've made batches with and without nuts, and regardless of the addition of nuts it turns out wonderfully. Don't be concerned if you can't get the caramel to coat the popcorn evenly before you put it in the oven. The 15 minute interval stirs while in the oven helps remedy any unevenness in regards to the coating. Makes a wonderful snack and gift, thanks for the recipe!

This is sooo good! I don't know exactly what 5 quarts are, but I popped 1 cup of popcorn kernals in my stir crazy popper and the ratio of caramel to popcorn was perfect. I will be making this again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty recipe and easy to make. However, I did not find that there was enough sauce for the 5 quarts of popcorn, which I carefully measured.

I made mine in two pans. Since there was not enough room for both pans on the same rack, I used two racks. The pans were staggered with very little overlap. The pan on the bottom rack burned. Next time I will try to find a larger pan that can fit all the popcorn and bake it all on the same rack.

I added some pecans, but I think peanuts would be better.

WOW. I didn't end up with nearly enough popcorn! I made the kind where you have to measure it out and pop it in a pan...I really don't know what 5 qts of popcorn looks like, but I ended up with WAY too much caramel. I'm still giving this 5 stars because it was my fault, and the caramel was really good!

This was delicious. A little hard to mix at the beginning, I found the caramel cooled very quickly and stayed where i poured it, but mixed once it was heated in the oven. Will defiently make again, good for snacking since it lasts for quite a few days! Only needed to be baked for about 30 minutes though to make a nice crunchy popcorn snack.

Very, Very Goood and very easy! I did NOT cut back on anything. I think the butter is the perfect amount. The only change I made, I put pure almond extract in instead of the vanilla. I also baked it on 225 degrees for 1 hour. Perfect!!!

I also halved the butter, still excellent.  This sets more chewy and hard than I think of  my ideal caramel popcorn but that could be because I don't have much experience with making caramel topping.  So tasty, but caution for your teeth!

Delicious and easy to make!  I cut back on the butter a bit as suggested by others but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great!  I will never buy caramel corn again...making it is much better.

Halved the butter like others have. Made a double batch and it wasnt enough. Be careful not to burn the caramel while cooking. Best to use a candy thermometer to ensure best flavor.  Time consuming, but worth it int he end.

Absolutely delish!!  Easy recipe.  I have made this recipe many times and turns out great every time.  I have also melted chocolate chips and drizzled over finished caramel corn.  Kids love it.

Wow was this good!  Aside from having to stir frequently, this was easy to make.  I added unsalted peanuts which added a nice flavor.  My only mistake was to leave in all the kernels that did not pop which then stuck to the other popped pieces and almost broke a tooth when I bit into it.  Otherwise a must have recipe for movie night!

This is a good recipe. It is not exactly what I was looking for. It resembles cracker jacks. If I were to make it again I would add peanuts or carmelized almonds. It was a pain have to stir it every 15 minutes.

I got a recipe very similar to this from the Karo syrup website. I doubled what they listed for the caramel mixture, and did not add the 3cups nuts as they suggested. The main differences I see, are that I used a full cup of Karo syrup & a full teaspoon of baking soda.  This was plenty for the popcorn I got from 1cup unpopped corn (didn't measure the amount). It filled a foil turkey roaster, heaping a bit. I cooked in on 300deg for 45m, stirring every 12-15min so it didn't burn. There was plenty of caramel for the popcorn. I would highly recommend keeping the popcorn warm while cooking the syrup, it prevents the corn from wilting better. I gave this 4 stars cause I think the extra syrup & baking soda are important.

delicious...kids loved it, husband ate so much he was ill...note...i found it tricky with the boiling for 4 mins..my copper bottom pots cook faster and by 3 mins it smelled a bit burnt, so i took it off, put in the soda  and vanilla, and poured it on anyway,. it tasted burnt...so i made a new batch, only let it boil unstirred 2 mins, then added vanilla, then soda and it worked perfect...i learned that if it smells a bit burnt you can taste that. so don't waste the popcorn, start over....overall fairly easy and delicious...

quick and fairly easy. the popcorn tastes good, but i honestly don't think it's any better than the kind you buy at the store. it's nothing special. but it did taste good so i'm giving this recipe 4 stars. to sum it up...you might as well just save yourself the trouble and go buy caramel corn somewhere. it tastes exactly the same.

This was really great popcorn. The only thing was that it was not as crunchy as I had hoped, but it had a nice flavor. Making it was a bit of a challenge, but it was worth it. I'll probably try it again around the holidays. Thanks!

The first time I made this I had the oven up too high and it burnt! Had to throw it all away.  Not one to give up, I made it again last night - it came out much better but was still a bit "chewy" for more, I prefer it to be a little more "crisp"  I think it might be my oven.  Everyone at work LOVES it!  I'm adding peanuts next time.

The only suggestion I have to this great recipe is once you've finished baking it in the oven, scoop it out of the pan and let it cool on waxed paper.  My batch was glued to the bottom of the pan!  I had to re-warm it to get it to let go.  Very yummy!!!!

Great recipe and easy to make!  I made it  with my two daughters - we all loved it.  I don't really think you can ruin this recipe - I was chatting to much while making the first batch and only put in 1 cup sugar, and it was tasty, not as sweet, but still good.  Thanks for a great recipe I will certainly be making again.

Delicious, I can't stop eating it! I only cooked it for 30 minutes to make it super chewy, the way I like it. Be careful not to let the butter/sugar mix burn though; it keeps bubbling for a bit after you turn the heat off, so it can burn easily.

this is an amazingly easy recipe that is so wonderful to make in the fall.  Reminds everyone of a childhood favorite!  One time I made it and added mixed nuts - no that was special.

This is a great recipe. I use an air popper to pop the corn. I found it is much better if I carefully remove the uncooked seeds before adding the caramel sauce. Otherwise, they stick to the popped kernels. The end result is definitely better than any gourmet carmel corn I've had.

Delicious and simple. Be sure to sample periodically while baking to make sure that you get the consistency you want and also so that the carmel doesn't start to burn.  Definately put tin foil down on the cookie sheet - major timesaver.

I made this after seeing it on one of the top ten lists. After entertaining my family the next morning I found myself eating what was left for breakfast! It was addicting. It tastes better then any store bought popcorn I've had.

This stuff is AMAZING  I"m at a dorm right now so I dont have that much to work with but i can use an oven.   I made it ober the sommer for my brother and sister and they loved it.  You can also just spread it thinly on waxed paper and eat it by itself.  Props for this one

This was so easy and very good. Make sure you layer it thin on a non-stick jelly roll pan. I will make this for my family. Also I added pecans.

This is THE best.  Perfect.  I like to use my old-fashioned stovetop popper for this, because it doesn't leave unpopped kernals...which can be a HUGE problem with caramel corn.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic!  Easy, delicious, inexpensive . . . what could be better?  I took another submitter's suggestion and lined my jellyroll pans with non-stick foil.  It really cut down on the clean-up.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks, Brian!

Excellent recipe and easy. It did help to have another set of hands to mix the hot caramel into the popcorn.  Everyone enjoyed it at a party we had and packed up leftovers to take home into individual snack bags.

This popcorn is delicious. The only problem I had was once it was cool to break into pieces, it was also stuck to the pan. I'm going to try greasing the pan or dumping it on wax paper right away. Also I only cooked it 30 mins before starting to burn. The final product is great though!!

I love this recipe! People couldn't stay away from it. It even beats my aunt's recipe, and that's hard to do! I like caramel popcorn that is absolutely soft and gooey and drenched in caramel so I made a little less popcorn and I only baked it for 15 minutes, but I'm not really sure it would need to be baked at all.

Pretty good. This recipe would have been better if the caramel were darker, and wasn't so chewy. I baked it for 45 minutes, and I put it all in an oven roaster pan to cook it in.

I made this for a New Years' Eve party and it was all gone.  The popcorn had a great flavour and was pleasantly chewy/crunchy.  I followed the recipe exactly and made my popcorn first on the stovetop.

This popcorn is very addictive so if you are making this for gifts I suggest making a double recipe so you can munch freely!!

Very good. Everyone commented on how good this was. Got a few comments that it tasted just like store bought that kind of made me wish is was a little more homemade tasting for the work of making it. I baked for 45 mins and it was perfect. Would be better I think with nuts.

I really like this recipe.  My intention was to use it to make gift baskets for x-mas.  Unfortunately, the first time I made it the popcorn had a burnt after-taste.  I decided to try it again, this time baking it for only 40 minutes thinking that I had baked it too long the first time.  I used foil-lined cookie sheets sprayed with Pam, but had the same result.  I would still recommend this reciped; obviously others have had better luck.  Thanks Brian!

This was wonderful stuff, but for some reason it was way too salty.  Probably because i used really buttery popcorn and then added the salt to the caramel.  That was my fault though.  Next time I will cut down on the salt and use plain popcorn.

Awesome!!!  Additive!!  Thanks Brian!!
Dec/2010 try using 1/2 cup butter, lots of reviews and they cant tell the difference.  foiled the cookie sheet and sprayed it with Pam.  Baked it for 30 mins. turning twice. It was gone in one night.  My husband went into auto-feed and devoured it, I also helped but of course just a little!!!  I will make this on a regular basis. 
Thanks again, Michele, cambridge, ontario
update: used 2 bags micro popcorn. Used large roasting pan to mix and bake. sprayed pan with cooking spray.  Added pecans!!!!

This was so yummy... I baked this for 30 minutes on cookie sheets lined with tin foil. Next time I will only bake for 15 minutes because we like it a little chewy.

I've never had true caramel corn so I wasn't sure if mine had turned out okay.  My husband brought some into work and a co-worker said it was better than the stuff he drove into the city for!  I knew I loved it (which was why he had to bring the rest into work or I wouldn't have been able to stop snacking!) so I was very glad to hear it was true caramel corn!

My boyfriend who says he does not like carmel corn loved this. Very easy. I added some walnuts, next time we are going to add spanish peanuts as we think it be really good with those. I have a partial and baked a little longer as the recipe stated. This did not get stick to my partial or crowns, that was a plus for me!.

This was soooo easy.  I didn't even bake it and it came out perfect.  I used 1 bag of microwave popcorn and 1/2 of all the other ingredients to make several servings for my kid's snack.  I boiled the caramel as stated then poured it over the popcorn, stirred well and waited 10 min. for it to cool.  Voila.  It was done and my kids ate it up.  I don't know what baking it does, but it wasn't necessary in my opinion.

I scaled it to 5 servings which made it nice for a night snack. I airpopped the kernels and placed the popcorn in a big bowl that was lightly sprayed with olive oil cooking spray. This made it easier to stir. I only had coconut extract so I used that instead of vanilla and I found no difference in taste. I followed RENEE BURTON's advice and used a brown bag in the microwave, yet i only did it 3 times and some pieces were burnt. The popcorn had a buttery coat on it so next time I will not use as much. Overall very tasty and easy to clean up!

OK, guys, you must make this!!! It is unbelievable!
   I made it last night to give away as part of our Christmas baskets. I had to make a bunch so I quadrupled everything and baked it in a huge disposable roasting pan (it worked great and cleaned up like new!)
   If we can leave it alone, some people on our list might actually get their share! Thanx!!!

One word...AWESOME!!!!  I had a similar recipe years ago but it has gotten lost.  I think this recipe is even better than the one I had.  My 15-year-old son who thinks caramel corn is "gross" can't keep his hands out of it.  We will have this often.  Perfect for movie night or anytime.  It is unbelievably simple to make for being so delicious.  Thanks so much, Brian!!

This was great! However, I baked it only 45min instead of one hour and it was just fine (I was really anxious to eat it!). I took this recipe a couple weeks back and I've made it for the third time tonight.
