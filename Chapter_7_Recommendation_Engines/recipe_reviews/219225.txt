I read the previous reviewers comments and decided to give the recipe a little "jooj" before I started it and it turned out 5 star. I seasoned the chicken with Herbs De Provence. This is a common spice blend that is available in any market and is just basically Italian seasoning with dried parsley and lavender added. If you don't have it, Italian seasoning and parsley or just Italian Seasoning is fine. I did not use the garlic salt but salted and peppered the chicken and added fresh garlic to the squash instead. I browned the chicken as the recipe stated but when I put in the vegetables I added 1 Tsp of fresh minced garlic, a dash of red pepper flakes and also LIGHTLY seasoned them with the same seasoning as the chicken. I also substituted the Hunt's tomatoes with the Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes because I seasoned the chicken before hand so I didn't want the tomatoes over seasoned. I also think the fire roasted are more flavorful with a fresher, sweeter, taste. I also sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on the top after plating and as I said, I think it was a 5 star dish! Thank you so much for the easy to vary recipe. These are the kind of recipes I like to see on Allrecipes.  Simple to prepare, Quick to cook and easy to personalize to my preferences. There is no right or wrong way!

This was ok.  It was healthy.  I think it needs a little more flavor, maybe some more herbs.

This was super yummy! I made it even better by serving it over egg noodles, and I topped it with parmesan AND mozzarella cheese. It was fast and easy. I'm definitely going to try it again.

I know so many dislike when a recipe is reviewed that wasn't followed, but with some tweaks, this was amazing!

I heeded the comment that said the original recipe lacked flavor. I used the garlic salt on the chicken breasts as stated and added some Greek Seasoning to them as well. After cooking the breasts and taking them out of the pan, I added the onion and 2 small zucchini along with 6 sliced, fresh roma tomatoes to the pan. I sprinkled the whole thing with sea salt and some rosemary and cooked as directed.

When I added the breasts back to the skillet, the breasts had let go of some juice and I poured that into the skillet, too. I cooked it all covered until the chicken was done.

It made a lot of liquid! I maybe would thicken the liquid next time. We ate the veggies and some of the "juice" on barley and the chicken on the side. It was sooooo goood!

I really liked this recipe. I did add some seasoning, such as garlic, more rosemary, etc. I also served it over quinoa (made with veggie broth), which gave it more texture and adds fiber. I found the recipe to be barely enough for my family of 3. I will double it next time.

This is pretty tasty. My chicken was pretty thick so it took a little longer to cook, but it was still pretty easy. I served it all over some brown rice
