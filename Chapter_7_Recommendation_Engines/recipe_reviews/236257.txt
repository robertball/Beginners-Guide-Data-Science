This was very similar to Taco Bell Home Originals seasoning. It did have the same flavor although it wasn't identical, it was close enough to call this a copycat recipe indeed. We actually liked this better than the packaged mix and much better than the take out from the fast food joint. I added this and about a cup of broth to the pan with the raw meat and then broke the beef up to look like a meat soup, then simmered until the liquid was gone. I didn't have boullion granules so I used a cube and changed the garlic salt to plain garlic powder so it wouldn't be too salty. This is mild and while it had some warmth from the cayenne, it isn't spicy at all. We ate tacos, tostadas, and nachos from this for several days and this was fabulous. My husband said this is his favorite taco beef recipe so make this from now on!!! I agree, this is really good and I will be using this now as my go-to taco filling. Thanks for the winner!

Family loved it! I think it was spot on! I did double the recipe because I used it on ground deer (which is a bit gamier). Wonderful flavor and I will no longer be buying the taco bell seasonings as I will be using this from now on! Thanks for sharing!

I needed a good taco seasoning, in a pinch, and had all the ingredients on hand. This is a nice spice mix and does seem to have a flavor reminiscent of Taco Bell. For those that found this to be bland, this recipe is only used to season one pound of meat. With that in mind, you will need to allow the meat/spice mixture to simmer, so the flavors can marry and/or use fresh, better quality spices. Thanks!

Worked perfectly in my seven layer dip. Thickened up the taco meat "juice" perfectly.

I used this for taco meat tonight, and it was very good. It was just a little too salty, so I'll cut back just a bit next time. I'm out of white sugar, so had to use brown sugar. And I only put a sprinkle of cayenne and then a sprinkle of black pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy for my son. My son gave it a thumbs up. *Update- this is my absolute favorite taco seasoning I've found. I make it all the time. I use 1/2 t garlic salt and 1/2 t garlic powder. Perfect!

Simple seasoning mix that is a fairly accurate recreation of Taco Bell seasoning.  Added olive oil and sriracha and made into a marinade for fajita veggies and beef.

Thank you for this recipe!  I found it searching for a taco seasoning mix that I could make at home using far less sodium than the pre-packaged blends, and this is it!  I can easily substitute lower-sodium bouillon and garlic powder for their higher sodium counterparts and life is good.  Thanks!

I LOVE TACOS!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!! This is a must try and keep prepared recipe! I used to be that package buyer, but not any more TO MUCH SODIUM, YUCK! Even the low in sodium packs. I've actually used this recipe 8 times already, the best thing about it is that I have control of whats to much or less for my tasting. I haven't changed a thing. I did lessened the "Cruched red peppers and Salt "after the 3rd time making BUT never omitted them. I keep air tight bags of this now, so when times get tight or I'm feeling too lazy to watch over a 3 course meal. Thank You!

This was really good but it didn't have enough Cumin. I doubled the Cumin and it was perfect. It tasted just like Taco Bell.

Thank you! I have a wheat allergy and didn't know the store bought seasoning had wheat flour in it until I ate it and was in a world of pain for days. With this recipe, I could get something close to the taco  brand I love while removing the flour that this recipe calls for. I just let the juice simmer down to the consistency that I like. So thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!

This was okay.  Only change was to use garlic granules instead of garlic salt.  I don't know if it was the mix or if it was because I had to use store-bought meat for a change (we have our own) ... or maybe my spices are getting old ... but we really didn't taste much of anything.  Ended up throwing some diced jalapeno peppers in to give is some kick.  Not bad, just not knock your socks off.  Don't really think it tastes like Taco Bell at all.  Thanks so much for recipe, tho.

I found this recipe about a year or so ago. It has become my go to taco seasoning recipe. I’ve used it both on chicken and beef and both came  out good. I usually double the recipe being that the recipe is designed for one pound and I’m feeding 8 people on most nights.  It can be a bit salty. If you find it to be so then switch out the garlic salt for garlic powder.

Kid Friendly modification- Everyone liked it. I didn't have dehydrated onions so I just used 1tsp of onion powder. Also, we have younger children who don't like "spicy" food so I dropped the 1/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper which made it more mild then I would have preferred but the kids were happy. My 12 year old said it was the best tacos she had ever had!

Decent recipe I'll make it again, but I'll either omit the garlic salt or use less or use garlic granules as another reviewer suggested, it is a little too salty, that and substitute 1 tsp onion powder instead of using the onion flakes just a personal preference. The recipe does have a good flavor, recommend.

I can't believe I actually still buy taco seasoning mix. But today I was out so I turned to AR to find an alternative. I've tried others before but thought I would try this one today. I didn't have onion flakes so I used onion powder in it's place. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I liked that I can alter the sodium and the heat when I make my own. I liked this and will make it again to suit our tastes.

I made the recipe as written.  It was very good.  I only used about 1/2 pound of ground beef, so only used about half of the seasoning mix.  I will not bother to purchase the package kind again. Very good.  Not Hot.

The recipe didn't indicate how much ground beef to use so I took a guess at one pound and it worked well. It was hotter than I expected, but very good.

I had no idea that cumin was the "secret" ingredient in Taco Bell's seasoning!  This recipe is fantastic!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and maybe added a little plain salt, but it was definitely flavorful and did taste like the packaged seasoning.

Excellent, and quick and easy to make.  Instead of bouillon granules, I dissolved a bouillon cube in 3/4 cup boiling water and added to a pound of browned and drained ground beef along with the seasoning.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  The bouillon provided sufficient salt.  The tacos were delicious without tasting too salty.  I will never use packaged taco seasoning again.

I found this on another website and the only difference was that it called for a TBLS of corn starch, in addition to the flour.  It thickened up right away and I had to add another cup of water in order to simmer it for 10 mins.  I will try just the flour next time however the flavor was very good.  Another thing I had to do different was use Better Than Bouillon since I didn't have any dry granules.  I boiled the water first and dissolved the bouillon in that, then mixed it all together with the browned meat.

I used garlic powder and onion powder and a veggie-based broth paste in place of the boullion.(sp?) Added a cup of water and simmered it with a pound of veggie crumbles until the water was gone. Used it for (vegan) nachos. It was really good and I'll use it often!

This is great seasoning.  My husband thought it was better than those seasoning packets, and those can be pretty tasty (but not healthy).

This didn't scream "Taco Bell" to me.  Although, a screamer, I'm not.  :D  It was spicier than I expected.  Not spicy, just more than I expected.  Somewhere between mild & medium.  I added a quarter cup taco sauce to help with that.   Eh.

I made this tonight using chicken for our tacos instead of ground beef. We are cutting back on beef consumption and love chicken tacos so I thought I'd try this. I left out the bullion and put 1/2 can chicken broth in with the pulled chicken and this great seasoning. I cooked it down to intensify the flavor. I will use extra lean ground beef next time for my grandsons but the chicken was delicious! This one is a keeper!

It was so yummy!! I was a little worried the Cheyenne pepper would be too spicy for our 10 yr old so I cut that I half. She LOVED it. We love tacos so we will be using this recipe from now on.

I made a half recipe to add to a half package of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix to use in Tortilla Rollups  IV from AR.  Since I was doing that, I didn't add the flour or beef bullion cubes (I was making for vegetarians).  It worked beautifully and added just the right amount of kick to the sauce.  I look forward to trying the recipe in tacos.

This had good reviews so I thought I would try it. It was easy to put together but the taste was awful.  There actually was very little taste.
 I kept adding chili powder, cumin and even cilantro.

This was a great seasoning mix!  We eat Taco Bell a couple of times a month and I think this recipe was definitely a copy-cat.  Thank you so much for the new Mexican go-to seasoning mix!
GREAT JOB!!

I searched for a decent taco seasoning recipe because I don't like any packaged mixes including Taco Bell. This recipe is a great mix. THANKS.  Better than store bought Taco Bell packets at fraction of price. Only change I made was reduce cumin by 1/3.  Personal preference because cumin is very strong and overwhelming for me.   I think the onion flakes, and bullion makes this mix pop and will certainly  make again.  I'm not a fan of TB supermarket products anyway. TB seasoning packets are no different than any other brands. And taste nothing like the resteraunt. Too salty and too much cumin.  Your mix is baby bear..Just right.   We all know TB ain't giving up their trade secrets either in a silly seasoning packet. Or taco sauce. The corn tortillas are just plain awful.  Marketing tricks

I was skeptical, but I made this recipe and it's no different from the flavor many of us know and love. I was actually out of beef boullion so I used a beef packet from ramen noodles as a sub and it was no different in flavor.

Not a bad taste,  but can be a bit salty (like Taco Bell was before they quietly too most of the salt out of their seasonings) unless you swap garlic powder for garlic salt - never no the ratio as every brand is different.  I wondered at the use of both cumin and paprika as well as chili powder, since most brands of chili powder are about 75-80% paprika and about 10-15% (or more) ground cumin, with the balance being a hint of garlic, onion, and oregano.  We did use garlic separate from salt (salt added at end to taste) and also use some ground oregano (made fresh in my spice grinder - a cheapo coffee grinder I picked up for about $10 some time back).  Also I like to use corn starch instead of flour to thicken anything other than straight gravies.

This is my go to taco seasoning mix.  Don't know how much it tastes like Taco Bell, but it's WAY better than the powdered Taco seasoning packet you buy at the grocery store.  Besides, who wants something that tastes like Taco Bell!

I use this recipe  ALL the time! The first few times, I only used garlic powder instead of garlic  salt. Now,  sometimes I change it up a bit.. Spicier/milder..But it ALWAYS stays in the spice cupboard as the original..

Just a note for thought. I use all co-op ingredients. Be careful with the Cayenne. It was way too hot. Made this time and time again and stored large quantities in a mason jar.

This was really good. I used garlic pepper (which contains salt) instead of garlic salt because that's all I had. I left out the cayenne because I used the garlic pepper and was making these for my kids who don't like anything spicy. The garlic pepper made it "spicy" enough for them. I will use this recipe again.
