This was the best vanilla cake I've ever made, and the whipped cream cheese frosting is magic. I was impressed, too, that the leftover cake was still in good shape the next day.

This also makes a great Layer cake for any occasion! Put the batter in two 8 or 9 inch round cake pans and bake for 18-20 minutes.

Wow!  This is one wonderful, moist, tasty cake!!
Made it as directed....although should have let ingredients sit longer  at room temperature....just had to mix longer.  I didn't make the frosting....I used it for strawberry shortcake instead.... hardly even needs frosting!!

Although not a white cake...its yellow in color....its better than any yellow I've ever had.

I made it exactly as called for but split it into two for a two day celebration. Will make it again and maybe not wait until Canada Day :D

Best vanilla cake I have ever made or tasted.  So moist, simple and delicious.  I brought it to a Canada Day party and there wasn't a crumb left.

I made a Halloween cake using this recipe. I used a bundt pan to make a pumpkin shape, layered the two pieces with purple buttercream frosting, then covered with white fondant. The cake held up very well. I followed the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of adding an additional teaspoon of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond extract. That is just a personal preference though.  I also added food coloring to make the batter orange. I will use this recipe for all of my vanilla cake needs!

This  came out great!  The cake is very tasty and the frosting is amazing.  I only had an 11 x 15 inch pan and it came out fine.  Next time I will have some sliced strawberries on hand to serve with pieces that end up without strawberries on them.

I made this cake for a July 1st, Canada 150 party.
Exactly as written -- it was delicious.  The best white cake I've ever tasted, 20 other people agreed and I had none left at the end of the night.  I will be using this cake and frosting recipe again.  Won't be waiting for next Canada day.
