As a professional non-baker. Love to cook measuring timing are not my strong point. Love Praline year round. A southerner transplanted to  The Great NW. Its not the same here. I have tried countless recipes through the years. With disappointing results. This recipe worked perfectly first try.  So easy very easy to follow. I did change a few things. Used Pam Butter non-stick spray. Used  3tbls. Tillamook Sweet cream butter  instead of Crisco butter flavor shortening. No problem there.

Good flavor but I rot at making this. Not sure what I did. Came out all crumbly. Guess I could sprinkle on top of a cake.
