Well I liked this but my husband didn't.  Hubby isn't crazy about dijon and the flavor of the mustard came through too much for him.  I think the ingredients are a bit scant for 6 breasts.  I used all ingredients for 2 large breasts.

You certainly can add whatever you want to this dish and it will always come out wonderful. I added garlic and onion powder to the bread crumbs along with crushed "Durkee Fried Onions". The chicken was tender, juicy and absolutely delicious!

This particular version of the recipe isn't as good I think as one that has you take a few tablespoons of white wine and whisk it with the mustard, and then add the butter to the breadcrumes and parmesean mixture.  Dip the chicken in the wine & mustard and then the bread crumbs.  That was my variation of the recipe and it was so much better!

I have never made any kind of chicken before... I'm 19, and I barely cook!  But the guy I was interested in came over one night and I made it for him.  He LOVED it and we've been dating ever since!  This recipe will easily become a favorite!

There seems to be missing ingredients.  The instructions don't match the ingredients.

I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added a little white wine to the dijon mustard.  While make my bread crumbs I mixed in some onion powder, garlic powder, basil, and oregano to add a little more seasoning and flavor.  I served the chicken with white rice prepared with a little butter and chicken bullion. The whole meal was DELICIOUS. I love to cook and this is probably one of the best recipes we've had for awhile.

Excellent.  I did add a bit more dijon mustard, only because that is the way I like it.  It turns out great every time.  And if you use chicken tenders, it is really fast!!

Delicious! I substituted 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs for the 6 breast halves. Next time, I think I'll coat all the chicken with the butter/mustard mixture at one time to get a more even distribution.

I've used this recipe a lot.  I use plain low-fat yogurt instead of margarine.  Also good for pork chops!
