I usually object when one reviews a recipe after they've changed it...but here I go. The ratio and proportions of ingredients make this salad delicious and nutritious. But its even better when you substitute toasted quinoa for the couscous and add pine nuts. I could eat a vat of it.

This was very simple and delicious. I was looking for dishes to serve my nephew, niece and her husband who are vegan and they loved it. The fragrance and flavor of the mint was outstanding.

I like to soak my grain in chicken broth for added flavor, and I use about the same about of fresh parsley as grain to add even more  nutrition, as if it needs more of that! Great stuff!
