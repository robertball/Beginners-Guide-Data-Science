This was very good, After I tasted it I did add some blanched squash and mushrooms with Italian seasoning.

It was delicious on three-cheese ravioli. I didnâ€™t have salmon so substituted bacon and mushroom. I thought it said 1 Tablespoon of tomato paste so that is what I used and it was just the right amount. Next time I will double the recipe for our family.
