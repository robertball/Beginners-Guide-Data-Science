This was good. I added bananas and mandarin oranges, as suggested. Next time, I think I'll mix all the fruit together, then add enough of the condensed milk/whipped topping mixture to moisten. The fruit seemed buried in the topping and I'd like people to see what they're eating.

My family has been making this salad for years. We add a can of fruit cocktail along with the other ingredients. Drain the fruit cocktail and the pineapple very well and the salad turns out perfect.

This recipe was very good.  I used strawberry pie filling instead of the cherry.  I also did as the previous reviewer suggested and added the sweetened milk & whipped topping as needed last so it wasn't too soupy.  I did notice that the leftovers become too liquidy by the next day so don't make more than you can eat in one meal.  I also added drained mandarin oranges and a sliced banana to this recipe.

I followed the recipe, and added 2 cans of mixed fruit and 1 can mandarin oranges.  I poured all of the canned fruit into a collander, to make sure it was very well drained.  This seemed to help, as the leftovers were not runny the next day.  I also added some extra mini marshmallows.  I did mix the condensed milk/whipped topping mixture first, as advised, and added to the fruit/marshmallow mixture until I liked the consistency.  I took it to a family party, and everyone enjoyed it.  I will definitely make again.

Yummy!  I made this this morning and it is delicious.  However, I added 2 large bananas that I'd let sit in lime juice for a few minutes, a 15 ounce can of oranges and used 2 cans of tropical fruit salad (with pineapple and papaya and the like) instead of the can of pineapple. Also used tropical fruit marshmallows (which I doubt really affect the flavor but are cute nonetheless). I really don't think just a can of pineapple would have been enough fruit for all that wonderful pink fluff.  It still would be good, but not really a fruit salad!  I'll make my version of this a lot because it was so yummy and so very cheerful looking!

Instead of cherry pie filling, I used regular fruit cocktail, but the results were fabulous!  It's got to be the sweetened condensed milk. Thanks for sharing.

I used a jar (without juice) of cherries instead of pie filling.  I made it for Christmas dinner, and everyone wanted to take some home!  A HUGE hit with the kids.

I added a sliced banana and used fresh pineapple chunks cut into bite sized pieces (instead of canned pineapple) - Everyone seed to really like it. I served it for a birthday dinner - the birthday girl asked to take the leftovers home!  It was really delicious!

good basic recipe. I made this fruit salad for a work even. We have a large staff so i doubled the recipe and made my own changes: all i used was 2 large cans of tropical fruit mix, 1 small crate of strawberries, 3 large bananas, 1 bag fruit flavored mini marshmellows and 1 package cook and serve vanilla pudding. i drained the coctail juice and used to make the pudding. mixed all the fruit together then added the pudding. this mix seems to be a hit, allthough most people think it is a little to sweet. i will try not using the coctail juice to mix next time.

This was good but sweet.  I think next time I make it it will be for a dessert instead of a side dish.  I didn't add the nuts because a guest I had over can't eat them, but I'm sure that it would have tasted even better with them.

I took the advice of a few reviewers and made this today with these changes: strawberry filling instead of cherry, added a small can of drained mandarin oranges, a small can of drained pineapple chunks, added 1 banana, used only 1/2 of the container of whipped topping (french vanilla flavor), 1/2 the can of condensed milk (used fat free version), did NOT add the pecans but added about 1/2-3/4 cup of toasted coconut, which made it more like an ambrosia recipe but all of this was a great combo. This was scarfed down by everyone in the family. My daughter said to make another batch ASAP! And since I still have 1/2 container of topping and 1/2 can of condensed milk, I have a good excuse to 'use them up'!

This recipe was very delicious! I think if I were to ever make it again, I would try it with some other fruits like strawberries. The marshmallows were my favorite part!

I grew up eating this and in my heart it isn't a holiday unless fruit salad is served.  We add a Lot more fruit though.  Cut up apples and bannas, mandarin oranges.  WE put everything in it.  In addition to pecans, my mom always added a splash of wild turkey or crown royal to the batch.

Overall, not bad. My mom loved it - thought it was very tasty! I thought it might be a little too sweet.  Will probably leave the sweetened milk out next time. I am surprised how well it keeps, too.  I had in it the fridge for at least 4 days and it was still great this morning!

This is such a good recipe, if you like something light and creamy this is for you.  My husband loved it and wants me to make it for a dinner we are attending this week.  Wow! That's another first.  Thank you.

Love this! I also make the cool whip & consd milk in a separate bowl and add as needed. I like to make it the day before (no bannas), and then freeze it. Take it out in the morning put it in the fridge to thaw by dinner.  This works great and keeps it a little firmer.  And helps it keep left overs better for the next day.  I have also re-froze it and it is fine, cause of the cool whip. Great receipe, and so easy.

I made this for a welcome home dinner as dessert and it was wonderful. I used fresh strawberries and pineapple instead of can and I also used walnuts instead of pecans and blackberries for decor and it is a wonderful recipe will be making for family reunion next month. Thank you for sharing.

This is a long time tradition in my family. I don't recall the original name as when we were kids we renamed it "Pink Stuff". My mother always froze this in a 9 x 13 pan and took it out of the freezer about 15 minutes before serving. She would cut it into squares just before serving. For our family, it was more of a desert than a salad. When eaten frozen like this, it's every bit as good as ice cream. I like to add blueberries (usually frozen) to the top before freezing. You can mix them right in, but if you are using frozen berries they may turn the salad purple. Of course, there is nothing wrong with "Purple Stuff". :-)

This was just okay. Really creamy and surprisingly not very fruity tasting despite my adding more fruit as others suggested. Will try another recipe.

This is a salad my family has made for years. It has never failed to please. Great reminder of exactly what my Thanksgiving meal was missing. I cant wait to give it a try with the strawberry filling!

I agree with others that this was way too much whipped topping mix.  I just used a little of it and it was plenty to coat and sweeten the fruits.  Everyone loved it though.

I used two small jars of marachino cherries instead of cherry pie filling only because I was afraid that the salad would be too sweet. I did add a little more chopped pecans. This was good but not great. Still too sweet, even with using the jarred cherries. This was a nice fluffy salad to make with the ingredients I had on hand and it went well with our "Thanksgiving" dinner in January. ;)

I made this for a birthday party and the kids-and adults-loved it! I followed the recipe as stated, but I also added a small can of mandarin oranges (drained) and a can of fruit cocktain (drained). I will definitely make this one again!

I don't know if I would call this fruit salad because there's not a whole lot of fruit with a lot of the mixture.  But it is very tasty for sure.  I added a lot of other fruit - apples, bananas, oranges, etc. to make it more "fruit-salad-y," but I think it would be better just as written and eaten as dessert.  The pink stuff is very tasty, though and super easy to make with usually on-hand ingredients.  Good recipe!

I've been making this recipe for 25 years now by request as a Thanksgiving must have side dish.  Some thoughts/suggestions.  If you find it too sweet, hold out the marshmallows.  It is best made the night before to let the flavors meld.  I think nuts are a must - but you can substitute walnuts, or any nut on hand.  You must use a good cherry pie filling.

Amazing! Light and fluffy! The sweetened condensed milk kicks this up a notch compared to whipped cream-only recipes. I also added 2 bananas, a can of mandarin oranges, and an apple to this recipe and it was very well received at my Christmas gathering. Even had to give a few people the recipe. Definitely will be making this one again!

This was delicious.  It stayed nice the next day also.  I used 1 large can pineapple tidbits and 1 can fruit cocktail, well drained.  I also added 1 tsp. almond flavoring, which wasn't quite enough.  Next time might add 1 1/2 tsp.  It was quite pretty, creamy, and very tasty.  Mother-in-law asked me to make it again soon!

Pretty good, but i added more cool whip(doubled) because i added the mandarin oranges and banana. Shouldnt have done that i think. But i wont know until i make it again.

This was very very good! I used a can of fruit coctail in place of the pineapple and also added some mandarin oranges! I served this on Christmas eve as part of our appetizers! Thanks for the great recipe. We will definitely be keeping this one around for many holidays to come!

My boys ate this right up.  My only complaint is that it doesn't keep very well.  Next time, I will keep the fruit and topping separate.

Love this recipe. I only used 1/2 of the milk and cool whip. Saved the rest for next week when I make it again.  It was a big hit. I used fruit cocktail in large can and drained all juice out.  I also used the pineapple and cut up fresh grapes.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. The kids and men all liked it, the women however thought it to be to sweet. I didn't care for the consistency. It's thinner than pudding, should really be served as a dessert in a bowl. I would most likely not make again. It was good but really really sweet.

I made exactly as written.  It had good flavor, but was too, too rich tasting (sweet).  I might make it again, however, I'll cut back on the sweetened condensed milk to maybe 1/4 can.

Love this salad. it never taste the same twice for me cause I always add different cans of fruit. The more the merrier. I don't have a problem with to much topping. I fill colander with canned fruit to drain then add bananas. very good and crowd friendly

I have made this recipe twice for family gatherings exactly as written and it has been a hit both times.  My aunt calls it "Pink Panther Salad".  The first time I made it the bowl was licked clean.  There were no leftovers to take home!

Great and versitile.  Recommend combine fruit first.  I put small can pineapple chucks and med can tropical fruit, with large can strawberry pie filling.  Mixed milk/whip top separetely and mixed into the fruit to cover.  Great!!
