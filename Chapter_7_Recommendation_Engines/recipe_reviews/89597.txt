I was hesitant that the halibut might be a little bland because there was no marinade. But, I was wrong. Because of some of the other reviewers, I omitted the lemon pepper and mixed the goat cheese with lemon juice and kosher salt and cracked black pepper. I added just a bit of balsamic vinaigrette in the bottom of the pan for a little extra flavor and it was awesome. Although, I think it would have been fabulous without it as well. Some of the other reviewers didn't make the cream cheese sauce, but, it really is a must. Thanks for this recipe! Coming from Alaska, where Halibut if abundant, we are always looking for great new Halibut recipes and this is a keeper!

Substituted orange roughy for the halibut because that's what I had, but the crust and sauce both were excellent!  A little heavy on the lemon pepper in the crust for my liking, but my beau loved it as is.

Bleck! I love goat cheese, cream cheese, lemon pepper, etc... This recipe was not good :( My husband and I started laughing as we realized we were both trying to choke down the fish with a straight face. If you insist on cooking this, reduce lemon pepper! Way too much.

YUM!! Absolutely delicious.  My husband made this, and I forgot I was at home and not at a favorite restaurant.  Next time, we'll add some almonds to the top just for a little texture.  Other than that, won't change a thing.

This sophisticated recipe is a real party pleaser.  The sauce is perfectly paired with the flavor of the crust... but it doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the halibut (which is rare for most recipes). It tastes best when the lemon pepper is reduced to 1 1/2-2 tsp in my opinion... but wow!!!!!!!!

Since there was already so much dairy in the crust, I decided to skip making the sauce, and just serve the fish and crust together. The result was ok - a little heavy on the lemon pepper, but not too bad. I think the sauce must be important, though, to deserve the praise of the other reviewers.

My husband just made this for me for Valentines day and I thought I was in a gourmet restaurant. It was so wonderful.
The flovors blend so well together and the presentation is is just beautiful!!
The flavor of the halibut is able to come through. Love it!!

Made this for a dinner party.  I thought everyone was going to lick their plates.  I received great reviews from everyone but hubby.  He is a plain eater so I wasn't expecting him to like it.  But everyone else raved about it and wanted the recipe.    
Thank you for this recipe I will make again. Easy and great for such an expensive fish.

This was so good! Based on other reviews I decreased the lemon pepper to 2 tsps. It browned nicely and looked as good as it tasted. Thanks.

This recipe was wonderful.  The sauce on the bottome was the star of the show.  I would omit the salt and reduce the amount of lemon pepper to a teaspoon.  The first time I made this it was like eating a salt block, but with these changes.....GREAT!

This was an awesome recipe! I made this for a party of 10 and everyone loved it although i used a fillet as opposed to steakes!  I did only melt 2 tablespoons of butter and lightly coasted the goat cheese crust witha brush. (I didn't use 1 tablspoon for each peice.)  I also took teh advise of others and decreased the lemon pepper to 2 teaspoons per serving! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Good!  I used Talapia because I had it on hand. I also added a bit more milk and butter to the sauce for the plate to make it thinner.  I will def make this over and over and have already shared it with some of my friends!  Thanks!!

Excellent with tilapia.  Used salt and pepper rather than lemon pepper.  I made the sauce even though I thought it would be too rich.  I'm glad I did, it was great.

I used Salmon for this and I can't even begin to tell you how good it came out!  I don't cook too much and it was so easy and absolutely delicious.

YUM!  I doubled the recipe and used wahoo steaks that my husband caught.  The only change I made was to use heavy cream instead of milk in the sauce.  I had a little left over that would have gone bad otherwise.  The sauce goes very well with broccoli!

I fixed this for supper tonight.  EASY and DELICIOUS.  I did knock down the lemon pepper and even the lemon juice in the sauce.  I don't really like the whole lemon fish deal.  Turned out great, and did I mention easy?

I would cut back on the lemon pepper and the lemon juice just a little, especially if you have fresh fish.  It was great!!!

Made this for guests and they raved...better than dining out!
No Lemon Pepper so I used a Lemon Herb mix and even cut back on that amount. Also a couple of twists from the pepper mill. Anxious to make this again!

This was fabulous. It didn't look as crispy as in the picture but I'll defiantly use this recipe often
