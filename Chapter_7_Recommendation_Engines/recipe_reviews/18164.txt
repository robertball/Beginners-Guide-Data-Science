WOW!!  I can not even express in writing how good this pasta salad was!!  I am a picky vegetarian who lives in a house full of carnivores and everyone LOVED it!!!!!  The only thing I added was a bit of melted butter right before serving!  It was superb, it was excellent!!  Thank you!

I loved this recipe and it was so quick and easy to make! I added pignoli nuts and a little extra olive oil.

My husband can be a picky eater at times, so when I told him the ingredients to this recipe, he was skeptical.  After the dish was prepared and served, he ate 2 bowls and couldn't stop raving about it.  Delicious!  Will definitely put into my recipe rotation.  Thanks!

I made this for a "Mediterranean" party last evening & it was a hit!  

I was hesitant about the spinach, so I only included enough to add color & texture/dimension to the dish.   Other changes:

*Tortelini instead of rotini (be careful when stirring & slightly undercook to retain shape).

*Added chunks of grilled chicken marinated in a mixture of lemon-pepper, olive oil, lemon juice, touch of balsamic, minced & powdered garlic, dill

*Included sun-dried tomatoes, marinated artichokes, olives

*Topped with toased pinenuts.

I like to make pasta salads a day in advance to allow the flavors to meld.  This usually means I end up needing more "dressing."  In this case, I simply used some previously reserved marinade (described above) & it did the trick.

The varying colors/textures were beautiful...next time I might consider adding diced cucumbers &/or orange or yellow peppers.  Adding some yogurt might be an option for a nice creamy version...may try that next time as well.

Thanks, Marian, for getting the ball rolling with this "spinach version"....it's a keeper!  :)

This recipe needed a little punching up, but it was an AWESOME base to start from, thanks! I sauteed some green onions with the garlic (in a couple of tbsp more oil than called for) along with a bit of crushed red pepper, then added fresh spinach to the pan and cooked until it was wilted. Added the contents of the pan to the bowl of drained pasta and then added cheese/dill/salt/pepper per instructions.

My husband loves this salad cold and I love it warm.  A variation is to add more spices to the spinach after is drained (vegeta), more olive oil or a TBS of Olivio, calamata olives instead of regualr black olives and sotee green onions or a red onion with the garlic.

used whole bag spinach, added olive oil, sliced olives, grated parmesan instead of feta, and of course, plenty of sea salt, no dill - turned out terrific!

I made this using chopped roma tomatoes and omitted the frozen spinach, threw in fresh dill (which makes all the difference)...the whole family went back for seconds...and thirds!

I am sorry to disagree with all the other reviews, but I made this and it was the driest pasta salad ever.  I made it for the 4th and didn't even serve it.   It might work with some kind of dressing on it, but not as is!

This was ok. It was a tiny bit bland so I added more garlic. But it ended up well. Would make again

This was a good recipe and even my 2yr old daughter enjoyed it. I forgot to add the dill weed though and found it a little dry. I would add a greek dressing next time just so its not as dry, still very yummy.

IT was good and very easy to make but, it would definitely be better if you chilled the noodles and spinach before adding the cheese

This was a great salad. I made it exactly as written, and it was one of those dishes that I wanted to gobble all up right away. I made it last for a couple of lunches, though. Worth making again!
