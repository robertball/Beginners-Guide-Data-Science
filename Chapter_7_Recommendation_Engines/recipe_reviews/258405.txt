6.11.17 I had to make one substitution based on what was in my pantry. I used cashew butter for the almond butter and think it worked great. Both my pineapple and bananas were very ripe so I ended up a smoothie with the perfect balance of sweetness for me. It was creamy not too thin the consistency was spot on. I drink a lot of smoothies and this is one I ll make again. Thanks for a new smoothie flavor combo!
