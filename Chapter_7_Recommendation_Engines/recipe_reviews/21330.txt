This is a pretty good start, however needs some improving in my opinion.  The Old Bay called for is way too much - also, when steaming the shrimp, make sure to "steam" - not boil them.  Use a colander inside a large saucepan.  I make mine using 12oz. of beer such as Fat Tire Amber Ale or Corona, about 3/4 cup of water, 3T Old Bay and 1/4 white vinegar - bring to a fast boil and reduce to simmer.  I also sprinkle a little Old Bay and Zatarain's Blackened Seasoning and a bit of Lemon Pepper over the shrimp - then into the colander (over the gently boiling beer/water/vinegar) they go.  Cover and steam depending on size of shrimp.  I use fairly large size and will keep the liquid on a low boil so the shrimp steam just until tails begin to curl.  Chill or serve immediately.

Hey, a Marylander here, I have to say, this is a tried and true technique. Steaming versus boiling. Great!

Here is my 5 star version. Put a ceramic plate in the refrigerator to chill. Use the largest raw shrimp you can find, ok if it is frozen; I like the 13-15 shrimp per lb. for a minimum size. Defrost, de-vein and shell. Rinse, pat dry and sprinkle lemon-pepper, Old Bay and whatever dry-rub you like to make spicy. I use Steve Raichlin's Creole Rub. Put a 12 oz flavorful beer, a splash of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of Old Bay in a giant steamer pot with a lid; when it begins to boil, set each shrimp in the steamer basket. Put the lid back on, and in 3 minutes, you will have the most delish shrimps ever. Eat one, then spread the rest on the cold plate, stick in the frig for 1 hour minimum, 4 hrs. max. In the meantime, make the cocktail sauce: I use a refrigerated brand of local horseradish that doesnt even have a brand name, it is basically coarsely cut fresh ground horseradish with a little vinegar and soybean oil. if you want GOOD REAL HOT cocktail sauce, REAL horseradish is required, not the processed  in the salad dressing aisle. I use any prepared cocktail sauce from a bottle, doesn't matter what kind; and mix equal parts fresh horseradish with the prepared sauce. You could use ketchup. Whatever! Then, I add the juice of a small lemon, whip it and whip it good and stick it in the frig (while the shrimpies are cooling down) to mix all those fine flavors. About an hour later my husband of 9 years begs me to marry him all over again. That is all. Good luck and have fun. Yeah!

I hate to stray from the recipe, but 3 ounces of Old Bay is a whole small jar!  I just used 3 T of the seasoning and it was still super spicy.  I could really only taste the Old Bay and not the shrimp.

Really quick and easy!  We did this instead of instructions on seasoning box and think it's better this way!  A quick rinse under cold water gets most messy stuff off and shrimp is still spicy.  Kids didn't appreciate, means more for us!
Thanks for great recipe!

Very tasty but I think my way is 5 stars instead of 4.  I roast the shrimp at 400 degrees just until pink on a baking sheet with a little salt, pepper, and olive oil.  Then I season as the recipe suggests.  Delicious and more depth of flavor when roasted instead of steamed.  Also, I think the texture is better this way, too.

steamed shrimp are ok, but being from Delaware, you DONOT ad the Old Bay till the end, take off the heat, keep covered and add. Even if you boil the shrimp(OK), drain and put back in pot and add the OLD BAY; I worked for steamed crab restaurant, they didnot add the seasoning till the end.

I had never fixed shrimp like this before and I'm telling you this is the way to fix em.  We do not have a steamer basket so here is how we did it.  I put the water in the tall pasta pot, then I got the collander to put the shrimp in, then I set the collander on top of the pot and it fit down in there perfectly.  This worked great.  Also, I only used about 3T of Old Bay.  It was messy to eat, but it reminded me of being at the beach on vacation.  Now I know how to steam shrimp.

This was a nice tasting recipe.  I would have liked it to have a few more seasonings than just old bay, but it was much better than boiling the shrimp.  Thanks for a good recipe.  I will keep looking for one that has other seasonings added to it though.

This was so easy and came out soooo great! I stayed pretty true to the recipe; only added 12 beer & vinegar to water for steaming.  Eye-balled the Old Bay and came to about 3 tbs like other reviewers had stated. DELISH!!! Thank you Wendi!

Excellent and simple. 
For timing, I always stop cooking shrimp before they curl all the way (for ANY shrimp recipe, whether steamed, sauteed, baked, or broiled.) Otherwise they may be hard to peel and chewy.

Wow - doesn't get any easier than this.  Made several times now, I use less Old bay and add garlic salt.  For a twist, try using your favorite BBQ dry rub.

I would suggest to use peeled shrimp in this recipe as all the flavoring stuck to the shells as you peeled them.  Will def use this recipe again.

Delicious, quick & easy.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and just put an inch of water in the bottom of my pot.  The shrimp steamed in a colander set inside of the pot.  I love Old Bay so I sprinkled it liberally over the top of the shrimp before steaming.  Much of it gets peeled away when you're eating the shrimp anyway.  Once the shrimp turned pink (about 3 minutes) I pulled out the colander and set it in a bowl of ice for about 5 minutes to cool the shrimp.  (I didn't want to rinse away all the spice.)  They were just perfect!

Good, easy recipe.  I agree that 3 oz of Old Bay is quite a lot; I cut it down to 1 oz and then kick it up a little with additional cayenne.  I make my own cocktail sauce (super easy), add some sourdough bread, butter and we have a great Summer meal.  I usually make this ahead of time and we take it with us when we goout on the Sacramento Delta for an overnight.

This is a great recipe that I've used many times.  Now, if you really want to kick it up a notch, throw in some eggs (still in the shell) and corn on the cob to steam along with the shrimp - you'll have a complete meal!

This was actually pretty good. Very fast too. Less mess than doing a boil but I still prefer to have it boiled cajun style. I like this and I will do it again. It is great to do when you don't have to cook a ton of it for a group. Perfect recipe for doing a small batch of shrimp.  For some added kick, I sprinkle a little cayenne directly on the shrmip as well.  Thanks  for the recipe!

11.21.17  Instead of cooking in the shell, I peeled and deveined the shrimp because I didn’t want to deal with the mess of peeling later. I didn't add as much Old Bay as called for in the recipe, rather, just sprinkled some seasoning over the shrimp before it steamed.   I cooked one lb. of 16-20 Gulf shrimp for 2-1/2 minutes for perfectly cooked, tender, succulent shrimp.  Also, I didn't want cocktail sauce overpowering that nice Old Bay flavor, so I just served with a wedge of lemon.

Steamed shrimp with Old Bay is a Maryland-must!  You don't necessarily need 3oz. of Old Bay, but sprinkle to evenly coat the shrimp.  Add about half a beer (the more aromatic, the better) to the water for a great flavor.

This was so easy and oh so good. I used spice island seafood seasoning instead of the old bay because I didn't have any old bay. Thanks for posting. This is so much better than boiling.

Love recipes with few ingredients. I made this as the recipe prescribed but used large shrimp and reduced the Old Bay by almost half. Served with spicy cocktail sauce. Gone in 60 seconds!

Good way to prep shrimp in a hurry.  Made this with just a mild sprinkle of the spice and ate with cocktail sauce.  Yummy!  Husband was happy!!

Five stars with my change:  Inadd 1 tbs. of cider vinegar to the boil. Simple and delicious!  I also make my own cocktail sauce:  ketchup, fresh horseradish to taste, dash of lemon juice, and a dash of worscteshire sauce.  You'll never use store bought cocktail sauce again!

We made this last night and really liked it!  After reading a couple of reviews, and after NOT owning a steam basket, I decided to try it this way: I used the thawed (but not peeled or deveined) shrimp .  This is unusual for me because I always peel and devein shrimp before cooking, but I tried it in the shell and it was great!  I used about a cup or a bit more of water at the bottom of a stock pot, put in three tablespoons of old bay plus a tablespoon or two of apple cider vinegar, brought to a boil, reduced to a simmer, and then placed a makeshift aluminum foil basket over the water so the shrimp would not be submerged.  I took about four sheets of aluminum foil and overlapped them so they were strong and so enough hung over the edge of the pan that it wouldn't fall, and poked holes in it with a skewer and then put the shrimp in the foil basket and snugged the glass lid down tight.  After about 15 minutes at a simmer the shrimp appeared to be done.  Lo and behold the shells had just about popped off and most of the deveining had been done by the steaming process, and the shrimp were yummy.  I adjusted my cooking time down as the shrimp I had were 41-50 count per pound and probably a bit smaller than others.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!  No need to make changes, just use the amount of Old Bay to your taste.  
I added fresh veggies (summer squash, green pepper, snowpeas, etc) on top of the shrimp.  OMG, Awesome!

Yummy! Thanks, my 11 y.o. son loves steamed shrimp in the restaurants down the shore and he enjoyed these very much.
