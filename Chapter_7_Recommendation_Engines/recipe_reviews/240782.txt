I mixed this up in the morning so the flavors had all day to meld.  I was a little worried as the dressing is very thin.  I mixed it with the slaw and gave it a few hours to blend.  The taste is very good, and it made a nice cole slaw, but there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl.  Would have liked it a tad better had the dressing been thicker.  Served it with 'Jan's Loaded Pizza Fries' from AR and we enjoyed a nice dinner.  Thanks rlt11_NMC, for sharing your recipe.

This dressing is exactly what we were looking for.  Creamy and delicious - not too tart, not too sweet.  I didn't actually measure the ingredients, but this turned out exceptional.  I used whole milk instead of lowfat milk because dairy fat is actually not your enemy and I probably didn't put a full 1/3 c of sugar but it was close.  That said, this recipe is great and I highly recommend it.  My people, whom are notoriously critical of all food, loved it.

I made this exactly as written except, based on some reviews about it being too thin, I left out the low-fat milk. It is Delicious!  The tanginess is perfect and blended beautifully with my broccoli slaw with dried cranberries and slivered almonds. My family loved it, too, and said it was better than any store-bought dressing.  Thank you for this Great recipe!

I had to make a change to this because I don't like sweet dressings.  I removed the sugar but followed everything else to a "T".  

She is right.  This is truly the best recipe I have tried.  I LOVE the buttermilk addition!  I am neither from the South or in the South but I love many of their recipes for the simple flavors.  

DELISH!

Very good. I will use this recipe from now on.it  does turn out quite thin . Use less liquid if you want a thicker dressing, which is what I will do next time.

Exceptional taste for just a few ingredients! I didnâ€™t have a whole lemon, so I juiced the half I had and then minced about a tablespoon of rind and tossed into the salad. Otherwise, made it according to the recipe. Delicious!

Creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. I made half the recipe for half of a 12 oz bag of shredded cabbage, carrots and red cabbage mix. In place of the buttermilk, I just added about a tsp of red wine vinegar to 1/4 cup measure and filled the rest with non-dairy creamer. In place of the herb seasoning, I just added some garlic and onion powders. Very good recipe!

This is a delicious coleslaw dressing!  I made it to use on one bag of coleslaw that I bought ready-made at the grocery.  I only needed half of the recipe for the whole bag, as I don't like to "drown" the coleslaw in dressing.  Just the right amount of sweetness for our taste, and even my husband - who is not a great fan of coleslaw - liked it very much.
