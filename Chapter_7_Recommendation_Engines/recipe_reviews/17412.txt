Very good and easy to make. I had never thought to use a cake mix as a crust for cheesecake. I used a white cake mix and added 2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. I also used all the egg instead of just the egg  white. Turned out well. I read the reviews that said the batter was too much for the pan so I made 18 cupcakes first and the rest went into the 9/13 pan. I used a small ice cream scoop for the cupcakes. I put 1 scoop of the batter and 1 scoop of the creamcheese mixture per cupcake. I then baked them both in a convection oven for about 20-25 min. I also substituted splenda for the sugar.
I will definately use this recipe again!!
Edited to add: I did not add the kirschwasser. Only used vanilla extract for flavoring.

This is a great recipe for gatherings/parties. It tastes like cheesecake, but with a light cake underneath. Simple and Clever. I followed the other suggestions and baked this in both a 9x13 pan and another smaller rectangular pan. I topped them with a ready made cherry pie filling instead to the raspberry(to make my life easier) and it was DELICIOUS! And the proof was in the pudding- people loved it and asked for the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

For a 9x13 pan this was A LOT of ingredients. The pas overflowed in my oven while cooking. 32 oz. of cream cheese seems like way too much.

This is a great cheesecake.  It does cook up big.  I made the topping and kept it separate.  Just added topping after sliced and put on a plate.  The topping needed more raspberries to thicken.  I did change cream cheese to fat free, and used Splenda instead of sugar and egg substitute instead of real eggs.  When I made the cake, I used egg substitute also.  This lowered the overall calories to under 180 per slice and almost no fat.  Lovely dessert.  Time consuming but well worth it.

What a great idea! I didn't have yellow cake so used white instead, it was very good but I think it would be better with the yellow cake (or really any flavor). The white cake and the cheesecake were the same color and the cake's taste didn't particularly stand out so that's why the 4 stars but it was my doing not the recipe. Will defintely make this again but change the cake to yellow or chocolate to bring a bit of adventure to the taste and look. Also, just used rasberry topping from the can. Everyone enjoyed it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this dessert in a 9x13 pan that is 2 inches high. I was able to add the raspberry puree and the Cool-Whip before placing the dessert in the fridge. It was amazing! I'll definitely make this again & again!

Very good taste. Next time I would bake it in a larger pan for less time.

I made this for my husbands birthday party, however, I must have beat the cream cheese and egg mixture too long because it came out too airy and cracked across the top, as well as was not very attractive looking.  I ended up making another cake for the party, however, my kids ate the creamcheese cake despite its unattractive appearance.

I used a chocolate cake mix and I couldn't keep the 2 layers from mixing together.  Tasted okay, the raspberry sauce is what saved it (I'll be making the sauce again--it was wonderful!  Used creme de cassis instead of kirschwasser).  Looked more like marbled brownies than cheesecake.  I made it for my Bible Study and they liked it but said they wouldn't have guessed it was cheesecake.

I made this for a potluck dinner. Reading the other reviews, I took some of the cake batter and put it in a small loaf tin and I reduced the cream cheese to 3 bricks (light), 3 eggs and 1 cup of sugar.
It came out great although it looked very different.... :-)  It was a success.

After reading the reviews I figured that since my ingredients fit into the pan and didnâ€™t run over while baking I was home free. My pick came out clean even though the middle was very jiggly. As it turned out the middle was not completely baked. My suggestion would be to only put 2/3 of the cake batter in the pan and 1/3 into cupcake pans. Put the same amount of cheese mixture into the pan and the rest into the cupcakes. Also, I should have known better and creamed the sugar and the cream cheese before any other wet ingredients. The cream cheese will not properly cream with the sugar if the rest of the wet ingredients are added at the beginning

It was a hit but the 13x9â€™ pan wasnâ€™t big enough to hold the whole recipe so Iâ€™d suggest using something bigger if possible

This was a disaster from start to finish. The cake mix and cheese filling just merged together before cooking and the result was a monstrosity. The raspberry sauce was too sour and didn't go at all. Only one taker at Thanksgiving dinner. Very disappointing.
