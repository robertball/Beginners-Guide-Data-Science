Fisrt, to the review/question to the person before me, I'm from Canada and here these drinks are known as Paralyzers. We just travelled to Vegas though, and there they were known as Bulldogs. So I guess what they are called depends on if you are American or Canadian, which is kinda funny.
Now, to the recipe it's self. I changed the quantities just a bit. This is what I used:
3 ice cubs in bottom of a tall glass

1 oz Vodka
1 oz Kaluha
2 oz Coca Cola (not diet)
1 oz whipping cream
Top the glass up with Skim Milk
Stir it all up, and Enjoy!

If I had 2% or Homo milk I would have just used that, but all I had was cream and skim, so I made it work. Anyway, REALLY YUMMY! My boyfried who doesn't drink and kind of  "hard stuff" (He's a beer drinker) tasted mine and asked me to make him one. Deffinetly be making these again!

Another variation for this recipe, can be to use Tequila, Vodka and Kahlua, if you are looking to mix it up just a little bit more. That's how my friends prefer theirs.
