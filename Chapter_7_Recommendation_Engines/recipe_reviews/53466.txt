Tried this last night for a "girls' night out" with friends.  It was a big hit - - - flavors are wonderful.  One tip:  to remove the "rind" from the brie, put cheese in freezer for 10 minutes and the peeling is a snap.

I absolutely love this fondue!
A little tip: I mix the cornstarch with a bit of water to make a sort of paste, then add that to the pot with the wine and cheese. I think that helps the cornstarch "set" and give the fondue thickness. Otherwise I've had it come out too lumpy.

This recipe has potential but not as is.  All you can taste is alcohol and LOTS of it.  My husband and I tried it because I was considering it for a party.  We ended up having to double the cheese and it still tasted like liquid wine.

I served this for Valentines Day for my husband.  We both loved it.  I did end up being a little on the salty side.  Neither of us seemed to mind it as it wasn't overpoweringly salty.  (I should have tasted it before adding additional salt)  I don't keep wine or sherry on hand but I did have white cooking wine and cooking sherry so there wasn't an alcohol taste like some of the other reviewers found.  Since there was only two of us eating I cut the recipe in half, except for the garlic, I still crushed up 2 cloves and it was perfect. I served this with beer bread, cooked chicken (seasoned with salt and pepper) apples and veggies.  We both loved it!

This is a great and easy way to make a cheese sauce.  Although I was apprehensive at first, I really liked the cornstarch tossed with the cheese.  Much easier than making a roux based sauce.  It melted nicely without getting grainy.  I also liked that it contained ingredients that I had around the kitchen. I might change up the cheese next time, it was a little too salty.  Could have been the butterkase cheese I added to increase volume.

I elected to make this fondue for a wine & cheese party based on its simple ingredient list and good reviews.  This was the worst fondue I ever tasted.  Peeling the brie also proved cumbersome.  It was very bitter and the taste of alcohal was stong.  I used a white table wine as opposed to a dry white wine and maybe this substituation, which I deemed minimal, caused the problem.

This was good, not my favorite, but my hubby really liked it.  I liked that it was not too thick.  Went great with granny smith apples and bread.

Let it sit a little before serving to let it coagulate a bit so it is not runny when you eat it. Other than that, this makes a delicious fondue! We used grilled chicken, apples, and baked french bread to dip.

This was delicious!  Next time I'm going to double the recipe... it was one of the first things gone at my holiday party.  I didn't even get to the nutmeg as everyone had started eating it without it.

I made a couple changes to this recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of wine.  I changed the cornstarch to flour and added a few ounces of jalapeno pepper cheese.  It was delicious.  My family loved it.

After shopping, I realized I had no corn starch, so I subbed white flour. I used chardonnay and cooking sherry for the alcohol. I made this for my hubby and sons (18 and 13) and another 19-year-old whose timing is always perfect. Used french bread cubes, steamed broccoli and apple pieces. Great hit! Everyone loved it. Probably made enough for 6, but we served with steamed shrimp. Definite make-again. Can't wait to try with corn starch to compare silkiness, but flour was fine, too! Thanks, OregonCoastGirl, for a great cheese fondue!

Amazing!  I ran out of white wine so I used chicken stock.  My 3 year old LOVED it.  We'll definately add this into our meal rotation more frequently.

I didn't like this at all....other reviewer was right; the overwhelming wine taste was awful.  Maybe the chicken broth would have been better.

This is nice because the flavour isn't as strong as some other fondues I've had.  Especially a brie one with a tiny amount of gorgonzola, which totally wrecked it.  This one works much better.

April is nuts.  If anything, this recipe needs MORE wine.  If You are getting alcohol flavors, then You havent simmered it long enough.  When I made it, it was too thick for dipping, and ended up nearly doubling  the wine, plus adding a little cream to thin it out.  My only Other modification was a little extra minced garlic in the first step.

Delicious! It is such a simple recipe but who doesn't like melted brie!?! I made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was the hit of the party. Get ingredients always make the dish so don't be cheap with this dish.

I followed this recipe to the letter - so I don't know why my review is so different then the rest.  But I threw it out rather then further subject my guests to it.  One attendee described it as 'tasting like communion'.  I will not make it again - I should have gone with the Baked Brie instead :(

Found this recipe here two years ago. It has been our favorite Cheese Fondue ever since December 2010!  I have been asked for the recipe by others.  If you like fondue, you will LOVE this recipe!

Other reviewers were right that it needs more.  I added the cheese,   About a cup and a half,  some cheddar and some jack,  but still needed something.  Garlic powder and a little cayenne really made it yummy!  My guests couldn’t get enough,  I will definitely make again with those changes.

This is an excellent, easy recipe. However, when you are making fondue you need the alcohol/acidity in the wine to help with the melting and to keep it smooth. Cooking wine is salty and less acidic which I don't care for. If you can not have alcohol in your fondue, there are other substitutions that you can use like lemon juice or vinegar. Keep in mind that Brie is a saltier cheese and if it's too salty for you, you can throw in a few pinches of sugar to help balance it out.  If you don't have a fondue pot you can use a double boiler. I really enjoyed this with bread, carrots, and green apple slices.

The Sherry amount over killed the flavor. I agree with the others who thought the wine took over. I tried to add cheese and nothing helped. Great color and texture, but the harsh bite made us grimace.

so, 5 stars for flavor, 3 for preparation. My fondue pot didn't get hot enough, so after 30 minutes without the brie fully melting, I moved it to a saucepan to finish it up. I skipped salt and pepper and used dried nutmeg. I used a proprietary blend white wine and cream sherry. used toasted bread, crackers, broccoli, pretzels, sausage as dippers. Would skip sausage next time and do potato and apple as well.
