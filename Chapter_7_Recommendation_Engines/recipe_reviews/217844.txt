Although the salt and pepper add some kick, it's not enough to make me swoon over this recipe. I was tempted to chop the cilantro and add that to the mix (and I still might!). 

For my taste, the seasoning doesn't really improve on the radish, as it is on it's own. Although I heartily agree with another reviewer: it's very pretty and would make a great "decorator food" for some table settings.

This recipe is a good one depending on the radish you use.  It sounded great, but the radishes I ended up this time were quite spicy without any seasoning.  The ground peppercorns proved a bit too much this time.  Next time we have radishes that aren't quite so flavorful, I will definitely pull this out again!

My 9 year old daughter LOVED these, but she has an extreme affinity for radishes.  I liked the simplicity and pure nature of this idea, but I think I would rather eat the radishes without the salt and pepper.  This would make a BEAUTIFUL decoration for a rustic or French themed dinner table!

Adding cilantro, sea salt, and pepper provided good flavor. The red radish, with the white trimmed ends, and the green cilantro is a colorful dish with kick. I liked the radishes prepared the way the recipe is written.  I also liked it when I added a squirt of fresh lime. It took me 5 minutes to make this healthy snack. This radish fan loved it!

Always been a family favourite for generations. with fresh bread and butter. Radishes must be kept crisp (in water). I'd ditch the cilantro. Simple and satisfying.,

Enjoyed this!  I chopped the cilantro and mixed it in. It complemented the radishes nicely. Simple, fast and good!
