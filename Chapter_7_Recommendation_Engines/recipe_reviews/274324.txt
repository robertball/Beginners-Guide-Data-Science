I add sour cream to many of my recipes.  This recipe doesn't fail to impress me.  It's moistness is amazing.  Blueberries the crowning glory.

I used GF flour and buckwheat flour for a GF diet. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup because I used vanilla yogurt.

These came out amazing! I didn’t have whole wheat flour so just used all purpose and I couldn’t find the sugar crystals for the top so I used course sugar. Other than those two ingredients everything else was as the recipe was written. I had no problems with consistency!

If you’ve experienced a problem with the texture, this is not a reflection of the recipe, but the baker. Over mixing will cause a “rubbery effect” because of the gluten being activated. You’ll want to follow the instructions and not over mix the batter. You want some lumps to still be in the batter.

I didn't have applesauce  so used the extra left over sour cream, so probably my own fault that they weren's quite as light as I would have liked
