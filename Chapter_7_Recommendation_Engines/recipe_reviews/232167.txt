We took dinner to some friends one night and this was our dessert. Three of us finished it in one night! Heavenly and lush. Full of flavor and bursting with fresh fruit! I added a splash of orange juice to the berries while they soaked. So good! I want more now! And it takes just a few minutes to prepare!

I've now made this three times and it's becoming a favorite! Made it with sugar free angel food cake and Cool Whip today! Yum!

Wonderful!  Five minutes to make (not counting letting the berries sit), beautiful presentation, and absolutely delicious. Made this for a family dinner. There were six of us and everyone had seconds...and most had thirds...it was just about gone. I used a variety of berries - strawberries, blackberries and raspberries (because my teenager ate the strawberries intended for the top prior to the dinner.) I changed a few things to reduce the calories even further. I used Splenda/brown sugar instead of white sugar (I would not do that for the berries on the top, though, since the brown color is obviously not as pretty.) Sugar-free angel food cake was perfect. I am sure I could sub sugar-free/fat free vanilla pudding for the mascarpone, but it *really* makes the texture and the taste special, so I left it in.

Great! Easy too! I have used this recipie a few times now.  1st time making it I did not "fold" the cool whip into the marscapone (I'm a rookie) and it turned out a little lumpy, but it was still wonderful.

This was so easy- and delicious!!
I followed the directions, but I added some fresh blueberry and pineapple in with the strawberries.
I garnished the top with the strawberry slices, and I sprinkled a little cocoa powder on the top to give it  a finished look.
It was very impressive looking, everyone loved it!

Very yummy.   Did need more strawberries than a quart to make 12 parfait cups.   First time to use mascarpone.

Great, simple recipe - made it for 4th of July for family. I made a few tweaks and here they are: 1) I used more strawberries, about 2 lbs total. I made a purée with about a cup of the strawberries sweetened with a little liquid stevia for natural sweetness, and combined the purée with the sliced strawberries for more moisture all around. 2) I used coconut sugar from Trader Joes on the sliced strawberries to draw out the juice. It's just a personal preference. 3) made fresh whipped cream and folded in room temperature marscapone cheese to keep it light and fluffy.  Everyone enjoyed it!

This was really good.  I even misread the amount of strawberries and only put in a pint instead of a quart, but it was still good.  Looking forward to using a quart next time!

Having made this for the first time on Memorial day wkend for our bbq I found I needed to double the whip cream portion of the recipe. I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 2 Tablespoons sugar to the whipped cream mixture. Came out delicious! I also made my angel food cake instead of store-bought. Would definitely make this again! Next time I will be sure to have a little more strawberry juice for more wetness

Easy to make and delicious. I added blueberries this time, just for color. I added a little water to the strawberry and sugar mixture for the extra juice. I put a little of the juice over each layer of fruit to make the cake more moist. Wonderful recipe and looks pretty in a trifle dish.

Loved this, and not only because it was so easy. It was delicious... perfect for a 4th of July party. Everyone loved it. Next time I might add blueberries for a red, white, and blue dessert.

It was great. I used a little more whip cream than it said to use on the recipe but it was so amazing like biting into strawberry heaven
