These are exactly what I remember eating in Ireland.  It can't be any easier than this.  (For those who don't have self rising flour add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt to each cup of AP flour.)  By lucky chance I had real buttermilk on hand and it came together in seconds.  Thanks for sharing Stace.

I just had to try this interesting recipe. I did make my own self-rising flour and shaped the dough into six rounds and baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  I was not disappointed.  They were quite good.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some buttermilk and I wanted to use self-rising flour. This perfectly fit the bill! I was initially suspicious about the very short ingredient list but these came out so well! I ended up using all the buttermilk I had and all the self-rising flour I had, which was not exactly in the same 2-1 ratio as the recipe but close enough. I had a TON of dough so I made larger farls and baked it (400 degrees on the lowest rack for 15-20 minutes) instead of using a skillet to cook. I also added raisins to half the dough, which was super good! I am definitely keeping this recipe in my back pocket the next time I need to use up buttermilk!!

Can't believe how simple these were! I did add 1/4 cup of old fashioned oats to the buttermilk and let them sit for a couple minutes before adding them to the flour.  Just finished baking them in my cast iron skillet.  Lofty, crusty and chewy, delicious as I remembered from years ago.
