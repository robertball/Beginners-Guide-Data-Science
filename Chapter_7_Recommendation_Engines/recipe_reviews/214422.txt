Perfect Coleslaw! Tastes wonderful, super fast and extremely easy. Followed recipe only adding a tiny bit more lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste. Also sprinkled with celery seed right before serving. Hubby and son are the coleslaw lovers here and they both said that this must be the new go to recipe, no more store bought stuff. Thanks for sharing!

Definitely the easiest coleslaw I've ever made.  Will make again with some tweaking to suit my family's personal preference.

Used angel hair cabbage cole slaw mix (cabbage only). Used it for pulled pork sandwiches and it was perfect. Doesn't hold at all. No longer than an hour or so. Don't make too much.

Really good....I used light mayo and added some celery seed. I have never made cole slaw with lemon juice before....usually use white or cider vinegar....but we really liked this! Super quick and easy to make....and I like to make mine 24 hours before serving ......gets nice and creamy and slaw wilts. Dusted the top with a little paprika for color. Thanks!

Very quick, easy and GOOD!  I like everything sweeter than most people so I added about a tablespoon more sugar.  Great recipe!
