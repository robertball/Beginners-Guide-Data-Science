I changed the recipe so that I could enjoy this!  I used plain yogurt instead of vanilla, and soy milk instead of whole milk.  I used equal amounts of ground coconut and water instead of cream of coconut.  Then, I forgot to add the ice cubes!  This turned into a smooth, rich smoothie!  Wonderful recipe, even with my adaptations!

Funny - made this for Hubs this morning and he slurped it up heartily- he said it was good, and that he really enjoyed it.  Only after he was done with it did I ask, "Do you wanna know what that was?  What was in it?"  Once I told him, he replied with a grimace, "Oh, THAT'S what that odd taste was."  Just like a kid.  Seriously, I did have my doubts but I had all the ingredients on hand as specified in the recipe.  And if it didn't work the avocado would have more than likely gotten tossed anyway.  It was creamy, smooth and different.  Delicately flavored, so it's hard to isolate what, exactly, is in it.  Pretty light green,  good for you (avocado is a "good" fat),  and a creative and different twist on the typical fruit based smoothies.  Try it on your hubs - just don't tell him it's AVOCADO he's drinking until it's gone - if ever.

I haven't tried freezing it, but it is one great smoothie!! I went with a friend to an asian restaurant and she ordered an avocado smoothie.  I wasn't quite brave enough to try it, and after trying hers I went looking for a recipe.  This one fits the bill! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

What is interesting, this is a typical Brazilian vitamine drink, as they call it. And normally here they add a banana also.  Avocado here in Brazil is considered a fruit, and not eaten at all the American way (very rare) in salads, with advocado hot sauce for chips, but cut it open, sprinkle sugar on it, and eat it that way.

This is amazingly good.  I've never had an avocado smoothie before, but love avocado so was intrigued when I saw the recipe.  It's delicious and not very sweet.  I don't like overly sweet things.  I made mine w/plain Greek yogurt and 1% milk, and it came out just fine.  Thank you to the OP.

Good! I would rate it 4 stars but my two daughers (ages 6 & 4)loved it so I'll give it 5 stars, I used coconut milk instead of reg. milk, after blending I taste it and it was lightly sweet so I added about 3 tbsp. of honey and it was perfectly sweet! Thanks Heather! Elvira S. Phx, Arizona.

I soo love this recipe, I can't get enough of this. I tend to add a bit more cream of coconut and  a bit more soy milk. I also added a banana the other day and that was real good too.

Can't give an accurate review since I did change it. However, the end result was great! I didn't have any vanilla yogurt so I used the natural/plain yogurt I had on hand. I added some vanilla, honey and a banana to sweeten it. Everyone loved it, even the avocado-hating kid who actually saw the avocado go in and was brave enough to try it!

For health reasons I altered this recipe and used plain Greek Yogurt and Almond Milk and it turned out great!!  I'm considering adding a bit of Stevia sweetner next time.  Thanks for the recipe, Heather! :)

I thought this was pretty good.  I added a bit more cream of coconut to sweetened it up a little more. I sipped half of it and made popsicles with the other half. I liked the popsicles better.

Great smoothie! I used coconut milk instead of whole milk. This is a great way to use those extra avocados that ripen too fast. I didn't use quite as much coconut cream because I don't like things to be overly sweet. This turned out perfect. I will make this a regular in my smoothie rotation.

Made this using coconut milk instead of whole cows milk, due to milk allergies.  Really good.  Tried it again the next day, but only had chocolate yogurt.  It was just as good.  Fruits or veggies could easily be incorporated to change up the taste as desired.  It was very thick, even without the coconut cream.  The cream really makes the smoothie sweet and thick.

This was good.  I used my keifer instead of yogurt.  I have made a similar recipe with banana to sweeten and thicken it - like a pudding.  I ended up using two avocados, and increased the cream of coconut just a smidge.  The first time I went looking for cream of coconut I had a heck of a time.   FYI for those of you still to go to the store - it's by the margarita mixes.

This is great - easy and kinda healthy.

I use whole milk and yogurt (low-fat doesn't cut it), no ice cubes and no coconut cream. Also, make sure you get real yogurt... not the crappy fake yogurt sold by most stores.

Great smoothie, I love avocados and coconut so as soon I saw this recipe I had to try it. only changes I made where instead of using vanilla yogurt I used coconut yogurt and added a hint of tequila, turned out amazing.

I made mine dairy-free by using all coconut milk instead of yogurt/milk/coconut cream.  I added a frozen banana for extra creamy flavor.  Yum!

Made the recipe as stated. It left a very greasy feeling in my mouthy and had an odd aftertaste. I won't make again.

Very interesting combination!  Seems kinda incongruous, though -  LOW-FAT yogurt with avocado, whole milk & coconut cream??  Why not Happy Fats all the way?  I tried it with my own whole milk yogurt (with vanilla and a touch of honey added) along with the rest of the good stuff, and omg, it was sooo creamy and delicious!  Beats ice cream by a mile if you ask me!  Thanks for the recipe.

A little too much avocado for me.  Next time I'll just try half an avocado.  I sweetened it up a little to try to mask the strong avocado taste with blueberries, nectresse and coconut flakes...much better.

I'm giving this 2 stars for the texture, but the taste is so bland.  Sorry!
