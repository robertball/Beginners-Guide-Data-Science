Ilona, Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. While the soup was simmering, the pleasant aroma brought back memories of my Hungarian grandmother's kitchen when I was a child many years ago. My husband and I both loved the gulyas. It tasted very Hungarian, despite the lack of beef. I only made 2 modifications. I had to use regular paprika (not Hungarian) as it was not available in my supermarket, and I did not use the vegetable protein. I will definitely make this again as my husband raved about it.

There is something seriously wrong with the proportions in this recipe. I had doubts at first but since there was a 4-star rating I decided to try it. First of all the recipe says it serves 3 servings at 1,000+ calories each. That's fine--I figured that had to be a mistake and should be, say, 6 servings instead.  Second, I had never tried TVP before, but had misgivings about using 8 ounces and putting it all in the broth so early. Still, that's what the recipe says, so I did it. It ended up soaking up a lot of the liquid, so I had to keep adding more. All in all, the combined amounts of vegetables and TVP made the soup very chunky and I had to double (at least) the amount of liquid. Didn't even bother making the noodles--I would have ended up with enough food to feed an army! This makes 8 to 10 servings for me.  I doubled the paprika and pepper because having to add so much more liquid made the soup more bland.

This passed for a meal but if you're a feeding a beginner-vegetarian family... this will cause havok.  Had to make the kids eat some with bribes of ice cream& fruit.  Hubby didn't like the thick dumpling/noodles much but he ate it because it's healthy.  We thought it was bland, flavorless.  Guess we're just not a Hungarian family at heart.  Used Sweet Hungarian Paprika and followed instructions , save for the vegetable protien, I crumbled two Original Garden Burgers in.  Even added some summer squash slices at the end because it just wasn't tasting like much. What do I do with the rest???
