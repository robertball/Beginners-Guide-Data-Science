This stuff is fantastic.  I used 1/2 cup onions, chopped them, placed them in a clean dishcloth and rinsed with  water then wrung the water out.  It worked perfectly .  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, made sure the  bacon was not greasy,  served it with cut up chunks of  French bread and it was gone in moments!

Pretty good! I took another reviewer's advice and used some garlic, too. Am looking forward to adding spinach next time!

I used Yancy's Fancy Buffalo Wing cheese instead because it's a favourite of ours, but this recipe worked very well and the dip came out delicious!! Thanks for sharing!
