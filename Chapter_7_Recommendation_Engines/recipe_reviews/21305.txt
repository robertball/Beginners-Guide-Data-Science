Good basic macaroni and cheese recipe.  Really easy to make.  I added a little dry mustard to mine.  Also, use a sharp or even extra sharp cheese to get the best flavor.

Just like Grandma used to make, although she used Extra Sharp cheddar and added little cayanne pepper to boot!  Make a huge batch, put some in lots of little tin throw away dishes, cook and freeze for later, just like Grandma did!!

This is the basic recipe that I have used for macaroni and cheese for years.  I always add some grated onion, or some onion powder, tsp. or two of prepared mustard and a little worcestershire sauce to give it a little zip.  Family loves it and it has got to be better for our health than adding a packet of processed dried cheese.

This was great!  I was very impressed how good it was.  I thought it seemed like a lot of milk but the key is to make sure you stir until thick and the milk just absorbed right into the casserole during baking. I also used shredded cheese rather than sliced b/c that is all I had on hand and it was perfect and easier.  I will definitely replace my old mac and cheese recipe with this one.

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe.  I was really looking forward to some good homemade macaroni and cheese.  My sons love the boxed stuff and I was trying to coax them away from it with this recipe.  I thought I would try layering the noodles and cheese so that there would be cheese throughout not just on top, however, it still didn't solve the problem of bland taste.  I'm not sure I would try it again but, if I did, I would try mixing it all together and see if that helps.

I didn't have enough milk for my regular recipe, so I decided to try this out for lunch.  It was very good, my family really enjoyed it.  The only change I made was the addition of bread crumbs on top. (family preference)  Oh, and I used shredded cheese, and mixed it together.  One note, my family loves salt, and we add it to everything.  This was salty enough, not even my husband added salt.  Just thought I would give a heads up to those that dont like it.  Anyways, thank you for sharing, this was delicious!!

I read through the reviews and I'm in agreeance that the cheese NEEDS to be added into the sauce and then the casserole topped w/ cheese.   I tried the sauce as written and it was bland so I added in 1 tsp worchestershire sauce and 1/4 tsp dry mustard powder, I also scaled the milk back to 1 1/2 cups.  Quality mac & cheese!

Delicious. My kids told me "don't make the stuff in the box anymore, only make this recipe". This recipe is really good, easy and has a homemade flavor to it. Great recipe Karen!

This was a pretty good recipe, although next time I will reduce the milk to 1 cup instead of 2.  Also, I grated my cheese and put that into the gravy mixture and then mixed that with the noodles (I used egg noodles instead of macaroni noodles) and then put in the casserole dish and put more grated cheese on top.

This was great!  I added some of Emeril's special seasoning, pepper, and some garlic salt to the gravy portion, and used shredded colby and montery jack and cheddar cheeses.  I mixed the cheese into the macaroni, then mixed the gravy into that.  It was wonderful; baked all together into a luscious dish.

This was great and amazingly the milk mixture did absorb into the casserole as stated in a previous review.  I made as directed but also mixed in some shredded cheese with the macaroni.  Will make again.

I, too, felt it was bland...next time would add some seasonings and I was wondering if anyone tried using shredded cheese???  seams like it would be easier to shred than slice...we prefer the sharp and extra sharp cheese also...with a bit of altering this would be easy and good

Unfortunately this one didn't turn out to be as good as I expected. My family felt the tast was too flat and didn't care for the texture. I might try this again and add more cheese and extra spices.

This was really good! The only things I changed were using shredded cheddar cheese and I sprinkled bread crumbs on top. Next time I would add some cheese to the sauce before pouring it in to make sure the bottom had some cheese too.

Very easy except waiting and waiting and waiting for sauce to thicken, but worth the work.  Used half extra sharp cheddar, half smoked gouda, and loved the result.  Added a pinch of cayenne to the sauce and could have added more.  DEFINITELY could have done the 16 oz of pasta with the amount of cheese and sauce!  Holy cow!

The rating would of been a 3 star if I didn't read the reviews and make my own decisions to add to it. I used sharp cheddar and sauted onions and garlic in the butter before I added the milk and flour. I also added onion powder. The recipe turns out as it should, I made no changes with the milk..it was just right. I think the next time I make this, during the last five minutes of baking, I will add those "Frenches" french fried onions.

Karen you're a genius. I was going to make the old boxed stuff as a dinner side dish tonight when I saw your recipe. It looked easy enough so I figured I'd give it a try. I followed the recipe except for an extra couple slices of leftover american & swiss cheese that I had floating in the fridge. This dish looks beautiful with a crispy topping and piping hot cheesy goodness inside. Thanks for this recipe!

No more boxed Mac and Cheese!  This was great.  The only thing I suggest is to ignore the time of 40 minutes from start to finish.  It's more like an hour or so.  If I knew that it was going to take forever to stir the milk, flour and butter to get it thick I would have started it when I started boiling water for the macaroni!  Reminded me of making gravy.  Went very well with Aussie Chicken from this site.  Thanks!

My husband liked this alot, although my 5 year old was not crazy about it.  I used sharp cheddar and mozzerella cheeses.  I also only used 1 cup of milk and rotelle pasta, because that is what I had on hand.  It was easy to make.  Makes a great side dish.

Overall a great starter recipe; if you like mellow and  creamy mac and cheese this is for you.  I prefer a little more punch in flavor and less creamy from the butter flour milk mix..

Changes:  First you should always cook the flour in the butter before adding the milk - helps with the flavor and thickening.

I added an organic free ranged whisked egg into the milk for more flavor.

I would use only sharp cheddar cheese rather than medium.

And lastly I would mix in more cheese near the end- more cheesy & less of the floury creaminess

I doubled the recipe and it turned out great! 
I added garlic salt in place of regular salt and topped it off with parmesan.

I changed it up a little. Used 2 cups of rigatoni noodles, garlic, 1 cup of milk, 3T of bitter and 16 ounces of sharp cheddar. It turned out amazing.

Good and not too cheesy.  We prefer macaroni and cheese with just cheddar or non processed cheese.  Very good.

This is the recipe I've used for years but never thought of heating the milk first with flour. I used the shredded cheese and this is now my go to recipe! Family said it was much better than my original version.

I love that this recipe doesn't call for processed cheese. It is very simple to make and delicious!  I didn't add paprika because although I like the flavor of paprika in mac & cheese, it tends to give it this odd gritty texture.  Oh!  When you make the cheese sauce, let your butter melt (over medium-low heat) next add your flour in stirring constantly until it turns a light, nutty-brown color then very slowly add milk stirring constantly until thickened.  When it's thick pour it over the macaroni.  I didn't bother to bake it.  I just mixed it into the pot of drained macaroni noodles.  Yummy!  The kids loved it.

When I made this my husband flipped.  He said it was the best mac n cheese he'd ever had.  I am gluten sensitive so I used Ronzoni Gluten Free Penne and instead of flour I used corn starch. I used a combo of shredded cheddar and American cheese, baked at 350 for 35 mins. Do not expect this to be "macaroni and cheese" like the stuff in the red box in the freezer section at the store.  This is more like potatoes au-gratin - only it's made with pasta.  This recipe is a keeper for us.

This was really good. I used shredded sharp cheddar and added a little sour cream and onion powder. I've made a lot of macaroni and cheese recipes I think I like this best.

Three stars only because I had to make modifications to make it really good.  I added some bacon bits, and put a layer of seasoned bread crumbs on top before baking it, but once those two were added, this was a great recipe.  It was the first dish that was eaten up at the potluck.

This was easy and declicious, after a couple of adjustments. For one, I added more seasoning to the milk mixture, and for two I also added some shredded cheese to the milk mixture. And I used shredded cheese instead of sliced as I didn't have any sliced cheese on hand.

The flavor was outstanding, but as others have mentioned, the texture was a bit grainy. I must say, since the flavor was so good the grainy texture didn't bother me. It still tasted great the next day, warmed up or cold.

I'm only giving it three stars and not more because of the changes I made. With the changes it was closer to five stars.

This was pretty good.  I used shredded cheese instead of cheddar cheese slices because that's what I had on hand.  I probably will make again.

Close to what my mom used to make for us...except she had some sort of ritz cracker topping sprinkled over the top....which I will do next time.  I shredded the cheese and it worked well.  After it cooled it became a bit thick, so I just added a dash more milk...perfect.  Thanks Karen.
