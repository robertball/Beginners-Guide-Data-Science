4.26.17  Blended exactly as written and felt the flavor was just a little weak, so I did add a bit more tahini and a fairly healthy shot of Sriracha.  I’d reserved the liquid from the beans, but didn’t need it because the hummus texxture was exactly how we like it.  Garnished with some chopped cilantro and a drizzle of olive oil.  Just super easy to make, and I think switching out the lemon juice for lime juice might be a nice variation as well.  This is a healthy appetizer, we have hummus often, and I’ll include this one in my collection.  Thanks Kim Lehman for sharing your recipe.
