Absolutely 5 stars (and then some) on this one!  A lot of prep work but OMG the end result is so incredibly decadent it's beyond words. I served this to a private group of friends and everyone,  I mean EVERYONE,  just about fainted from either the butter or the incredible taste!  Paired with a mixed salad and mashed potatoes...If you don't try it,  you will never know.  5 Thumbs up Chef John!  You hit this one out of the ballpark!

to stick the flattened chicken breast meat together more effectively, I would suggest that you add a touch of cornstarch (preferably organic!) to areas that you're sealing- it really makes a difference in how well the chicken holds together. I also use this for saltimbocca, and other stuffed chicken breast dishes. Flour works as well, but will affect the flavor, and may come loose.

I have been using allrecipes for years (9? 10?), and this is my first review. That should tell you how great the instructions were for making this dish. It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly spiced, perfectly timed, and the "how to" was perfectly explained. I have made this dish ONE TIME and it turned out divine. I am a pretty good cook, but I didn't think I could pull off cooking a wad of butter inside a chicken wrap without having it melt all over the place, but Chef John has explained things so that even the most novice cook could pull off a masterpiece. THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING; DON'T CHANGE A THING.

Terrific and delicious recipe. I followed it exactly as directed and it turned out amazing!! Thank you Chef John for the rolling technique as well, the delicious center stayed put until the final reveal. I'll definitely use that technique with other stuffed chicken recipes. Yum!

Chicken Kiev is my husband's favorite recipe! I've been using a very old recipe, which sometimes worked but wasn't always reliable. I'm so glad I found this one! The only change I would make is adding a little tarragon to the garlic butter. I love the taste of the tarragon with the other ingredients.

Look no more for another chicken kiev recipe! There are other kiev recipes with more reviews, but this is the absolute best! My family loved it as it tasted like something that you would be served at a 5 star restaurant.  Make sure you use fillets rather than the entire breast as it will take literally forever to pound it out into a thin layer.  I didn't use a mortar and pestle for making the butter but I'm ordering one because I can only imagine that it'll make the filling taste even better.  I froze the patties the night before and battered, fried, and baked the day of serving.

I would give this 10 stars. Delicious doesn't even begin to describe how this tastes. I do have to admit I did change 1 thing, I ground up my chicken in my food processor. When ever I pound out chicken breasts and try to fill them, I always lose the filling no matter what I do. Ground chicken was much easy to work with. The only bad thing was that the meat was sticky so I was wetting my hands a lot. The taste was exquisite, the absolute best I have ever had. The butter, garlic and parsley combo is perfect and the pinch of cayenne just brings it over the top. I didn't think the prep was really that bad, I think it was well worth it!!! Thanks Chef John :)

This was my first attempt at making Chicken Kiev and I followed eh instructions exactly for fear of messing it up.  When you follow a Chef John's great video instruction, you really just can't go wrong.  They came out absolutely perfectly!  My husband was impressed and he thought it was delicious.  I served it with roasted baby red potatoes and grilled asparagus.  It does take a little bit of time to to do these, but well worth it!

Thanks for the great recipe, i followed the instructions literally and it turned out great.
It takes much time but not much effort though.
For me i found it easier to prepare the buttery filling the night before serving to save time
Second tip is to hold the shape of the chicken ball while in oven i used the cupcake tin and when the ball leaked some of it's liquid filling it just absorbed by the crispy skin.
Great recipe

This is much better when you use tarragon instead of bland parsley in the butter mixture. Also, it helps to chill the butter very thoroughly. It's wonderful served over the best rice. Cut into it, and the wonderful butter pours over the rice and flavors it.

This was amazing!! It is definitely a bit of work, but so worth it!! I did everything it called for and just dipped it  in a touch of corn starch (from some of the other suggestions) right before I dipped the chicken ball into the flower. 
It really is a thing of beauty when it comes out..... my family loved it and I will definitely make again!

Made this today, and it was so, so good! Want to make it for a 12 person dinner party next month, and wondered if I could do everything except the baking the day before to make my life easier? Would I just have to add a bit more time to the cooking because they were put in the frig overnight? Would love to hear back if you know!

Fantastic recipe. I reviewed these before after the first time, now I make up eight at a time freeze them and bring them out for the final cooking stage. I have also made them with chicken thigh fillets which seems to be a better size for the kids and experimented with different fillings. Always using butter but with blue vain, cheese slices and spinach as one filing, diced tomatoes, two tables of tomato paste, bacon and slice cheese as another (tastes a little like chicken parmigiana,) and the traditional garlic with parsley and a couple of cheese slices mashed in. This makes for a thicker filling like the frozen packet shop bought ones. I have also removed the deep fry bit and opted for a light shallow fry. It means you have to turn them a couple of times but I am hoping they might be slightly healthier...?? Overall this is a fantastic recipe and while fiddly, you are sure to impress and enjoy.

A little time intensive, but not hard and well worth the time.  This is the best recipe that I have found for Kiev.  Fixed it for a dinner party and they all raved about the butter, herbs after cutting in.  The quick fry made the difference of retaining the juices.  Very gourmet and fancy looking.  Impress your friends, this is a winner.

Awesome recipe. I follow it to a “T”up to the actual cooking. I fry according to the recipe to brown them, then I stick them in the fridge overnight. Next day I bake in a 350 degree preheated oven for 45 minutes. Great way to make a day ahead!

This is a great recipe. The first time I tried it I used the chicken breast and didn't have much luck keeping them together. My son suggested ground chicken which is much easier to work with. It comes in 1lb packages. Simply cut in half, massage into a ball and flatten out like a burger. When you add the butter and fold over, you can create a perfect ball that is completely sealed. Once breaded, it looks like it could be restaurant quality. Also, I freeze mine a little longer.

This recipe is Delicious!!! Yes,  it's definitely time consuming but worth every bite!  Make sure you flatten the chicken breast evenly so it cooks thoroughly. But to solve that problem I fried and baked it a bit longer

Absolutely scrumptious! It is a bit time consuming, so I made several batches of the herb butter to keep in the freezer for future use.  Made this exactly as written, but air fried at 400 for 30 minutes in a Breville toaster oven with an air fry feature.  Placed just enough foil under the chicken breast to catch butter if it didn't hold solid. It held beautifully! Can out crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful throughout. Will be making this again!!

Exceptional! We substituted Parsley with Thyme and loved it. Will absolutely make again. A lot of prep work, but an exceptional reward at the end!

AMAZING!!!! Have passed this on to so many people! Everyone is amazed at how good they are. So much easier than the old recipe I used that required a bunch of toothpicks per chicken ball. Thank you so much chef john! P.S. FOLLOW THE RECIPE!!!!

This was an absolutely phenomenal recipe! I never knew chicken could taste this great. I followed the recipe pretty much to the T; however, I did not have any fresh parsley on hand so I replaced the two tbsp of fresh parsley with 1 Tbsp dried parsley and 1 Tbsp Greek Seasoning from our local NOLa Greek Festival. Every bit of effort is beyond worth it. My husband complimented me for days, regarding how well this turned out, and even my picky-eater 9yo loved this! They can't wait for me to cook it again and I can't wait either. This is def a keeper for sure!

I have made this for years. This is an excellent recipe but I suggest using 1/4 teaspoon of chopped green onion tops (green part) with the butter/garlic mixture. It is so delicious and the butter spurts out over the chicken when you cut into it. Oh my!

I too have made this and it's delicious; I intend to make it for a dinner party soon. I would prefer not to be cooking with oil in front of my guests;  could I pre-fry the chicken and then finish it in the oven later?

This was amazing! John is right...This is not an easy recipe but it was worth it! Everyone LOVED this dish. My fiancé has to be one of the pickiest eaters alive...he couldn't rave enough about this. I didn't change anything in the ingredients. I did leave the chicken in the freezer a little bit longer than it said and I took them out one at a time to dip. I also made John's mashed potatoes. Simple and great. Watch the video on this one. Very helpful. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have turned out if I didn't have that guide.

I made this recipe as written and it turned out great. I make a pretty good chicken cordon bleu and I've always wanted to try making chicken kiev. It's true it's not a quick easy recipe, but it's not difficult either. It just has a lot of steps, so if you've got the time, this recipe is worth the effort and the love that's required. I enjoyed myself immensely during the entire process from beginning to end. Yum!

After a few chicken roulades experiments pounding chicken breasts I came back to this recipe! It is awesome, I followed the video step by step, I even happened to use the identical mortar and pestle (bought it on Amazon a couple of months ago without knowing!!). It is tasty and a gorgeous way to elevate chicken breasts. I used the leftover butter and.egg wash to whipe up a delicious potato purée as side dish. I am a tiny better and gratified cook now :)

While it takes a bit of effort, the end result is incredible. Chef John's video really made it easy to prepare.  I never make changes to any first attemp and this was no exception. It was perfect as is. If there were more stars I'd give them.  My wife who dislikes chicken, and always drowns it with ranch dressing; didn't touch the bottle and ate 2 serving.

I made this last night for the first time and DEFINITELY not the last time. OMG it was awesome.  I made it just as is with a few minor additions.  I added Taragon to the butter mix. (glad I did)  and to the flour for breading, I added paprika and seasoned salt. Other than that I made it step-by-step exactly as stated.   If you have only read the recipe and not watched the video, I urge you to watch the video.  When I read the recipe it sounded like too much trouble.  When I watched the video I thought, "oh, I can do that".  Everything came out perfectly.  My husband asked that I make his "Cordon Blue" so I stuffed his with ham and blue cheese as he requested.  He said that was even tastier (he tried both)   THank you, CHef John,  this will become a staple for our dinner menus.

Tasty but a bit too greasy from the butter.
Also a bit time consuming to make although not difficult.
If you like the taste of parsley and garlic, nice!

There is no way to mess up this recipe!  If you watch the video and follow the instructions.  10 stars all the way around!  We are already thinking of other things to stuff chicken with!  It's AMAZING!  And btw we bought a mortar and pestle just for this recipe!!!

OMG! Chef John hit the ball out of the park with this recipe for chicken kiev (cotelettes de volaille)! I'm eating one of the two I made, and the flavor is out of this world! I made extra herb butter to melt over mashed potatoes. I didn't have a mortar and pestle, so I faked it by using the end of a heavy handle and bowl with high sides (worked great). I made my own panko-style bread crumbs, using sprouted grain bread that baked to a lovely dark brown and stayed crispy good. My chicken breasts were larger than Chef John's, so I baked for 20 minutes. I tested for doneness by tapping on the top and sides of each chicken kiev, making sure they were firm. I have never even thought about making a dish like this, but allrecipes.com has videos that really take all the mystery out. I followed the directions in the video, and voila! Thank you so much for publishing this recipe and video. I know I'll be making it again and again and again.

I have a source for very large breasts. Instead of going crazy folding everything together, separate the crappy muscle from the true breast muscle, and punch a hole in the breast from the large end. Just stuff everything in and tie a twine around the open end. Oh, and trim the very skinny end, as it will burn. Otherwise, everyone has an opinion on spices which might be added, or whether the garlic butter should be blossomed in a pot beforehand, with 50/50 olive oil and butter. You can stuff a chicken breast with butter, garlic, and darn near anything, and it will taste good with this method. The great instructions as to technique are unarguable.

This is a keeper. I did not pound the chicken thin enough and it still held together during the batter and deep frying process. Credit to you Chef John for the timing on the refrigeration and freezing. Takes about two hours from beginning to end. My wife loved it.

This was absolutely amazing!!!! I didn't change a thing...I enjoyed all the steps, and the whole process was pretty simple. The only thing I might do next time is let the butter soften just a bit before blending with the garlic and parsley, should make that whole process much easier. My BF said it was better than any Kiev he had in the Ukraine and could not get over the flavor! He was crazy for the butter sauce! This is now his favorite dish....and yes, there was a bit of a buttery-goodness that exploded when he cut into it....so perfect! Thank you Chef!

After carefully reading the recipe, reading reviews, and watching the video, I thought I'd give it a try.  Well, if you can't find 8 oz chicken breasts, don't bother.  The 12 oz chicken breasts that are standard these days have long muscle fibers and when you pound them to less than 1/2", the fibers separate.  If you leave them at 1/2", it is pretty much impossible to roll/wrap according to recipe instructions.  What to do when you have the butter made, the egg wash, and breadcrumbs (home made BTW) and flattened chicken breasts that won't hold together and can't be rolled?  Bread them, brown them in the seasoned butter, and finish them off in a 325 deg oven.  Disappointed for sure.

I love how easy this recipe is to follow. Very well written steps leave nothing to guesswork. 
I make this for my partner who loves it! 
This is the third time I 've made it, so I made some adjustments.
 I added the oil zested from half a large lemon to the butter. Instead of panko I used a mix of equal parts  grated Parmesan Romano, sweetened shredded coconut, and crushed tortilla chips with 2 tsp. onion powder as breading.
Next time I'm going to try a teaspoon of truffle oil in the butter as well. I'll also reduce the tortilla chips to half as much.

I used to cook Kiev all the time in the restaurant I worked in....It’s been 30 ish years since I last made them and had forgotten how lol
I got a random craving for it this week and the “freezer brands” are just not up to snuff. 
Came across this recipe and made them for supper tonight.  The whole house absolutely  Loved them right down to my picky 13yo  
They were so easy, quick and amazingly tasty. I even made one using some smaller pieces of chicken and it held together perfectly couldn’t even tell the scrap pieces from the whole breasts. 
Highly recommend you give this one a try.

It was delicious! I made some extra parsley/garlic butter to put on top of mashed potatoes. It was so good and a hit in my house.

It was awesome! I frozen the chicken for about an hour after rolling it, and again after breading it (15 min) I double breaded it to ensure a crispy coating and baked it for about 25 min at 375. It was great, the only thing I would change is to add more garlic to the butter... just because we love garlic. Overall, huge success, it looked beautiful and tasted amazing.

The flavor is fantastic, and I don't think this is difficult at all. I thought for sure the filling was going to leak out, but it stayed in place perfectly. 

I'm not a "finesse" cook, or one who does presentation well, but this impressed; the eye, the nose, and the mouth.  This was a real treat!

Quick and easy. My house guest, an accomplished cook, made it for dinner one night.  It was delicious, I'd add a little more garlic and it would  be perfect for my taste.
My compliments to the Chef!

Excellent!! I felt like I was a gourmet chef in a fancy restaurant!  I’m going to try some  cilantro with the parsley next time. Also, I am curious to know if I can freeze it after the deep fat fry step. I’ll try it.

Taste delicious.  There is nothing to change about this recipe.  Beating the chicken out in a way that it doesn’t tear us a lot harder than Chef John makes it look.  On of mine lost a lot of its butter in the oven, but the other ones worked really well.

I like this chefs recipes better than 90% of good networks chefs. This chicken Kiev  was surprisingly easy to make. yes lots of steps but man the end result I couldn't believe how perfect it was. Was beyond tasty and nothing beats that melted butter that oozes out.

Ever since my mom made this for me once I have been in love with this chicken Kiev I now make it for my husband with some garlic mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese or roasted broccoli or garlic green beans sometimes all of it if I’m lucky to have the time but it’s a top fav in this house!

I’ve been making chicken Kiev for special occasion dinners for years and this recipe very close to my own version. 
The major difference in my recipe is that I just crushed corn flakes instead of panko.  Much better flavour.  
And I always deep fry til cooked but am willing to try finishing in the oven. As long as the chicks is properly sealed, it’s probably  great done this way. And takes the guess work out of “is it cooked”. Ain’t nothing worse than having the butter seep out during the cooking process and cutting into dry chicken.  But there ain’t nothing better than cutting into the chicken and the butter oozes out

First time, ever, making Chicken Kiev, and it was total SUCCESS.  So delicious ... how to describe the tenderness of the chicken, combined with the garlicky-parsley butter goodness delightfully squirting out upon cutting into the middle of the chicken breast, combined with the perfection of a crispy outside....I can't do it written justice.  You will just have to try it on your own.  I was extremely careful about getting the temps just right with a meat thermometer.  Other than that, I found the recipe really simple.  Loved it and will make this again.

Wonderful indeed!  A lot of flavor--no, it wasn't "lacking something".  Husband enjoyed it as well.   We both really appreciated the panko crumbs as a coating since it provided a nice textural contrast.  I followed directions all the way through and watched the video several times, and yet some of my butter leaked out during the baking process--I just couldn't get the seal to be perfect.  This is not a recipe I will be able to do on a work night, but rather on the weekends.   I did not find the recipe to be "hard" as such since no part of the process was new to me as a cooking technique; however, it WAS relatively  time-consuming--all-told it took at least about 1 and a quarter hours before baking.  I served this dish with baked asparagus, cooked in the same oven on a lower shelf since they both cook at 400 degrees.  Very convenient and the asparagus gratefully took very little prep time.  Will make again.

I did make some tweaks to this recipe. I didn't have a mortal and pestle and used a jar of organic minced garlic. I also didn't have plastic wrap and used parchment paper to chill the chicken ball.  Though I could do without the cayenne pepper, this tasted real good. I served it with a frozen medley blend of steamed veggies.

Awesome, I increased the garlic, butter, Italian parsely and the amount of mixture inside the chicken. I made a total of five, everyone enjoyed them. My husband has already asked me to make again.

I baked them instead of frying and the were delicious!  350 for 20-30 minutes depending on thickness of chicken.  I served it will roasted broccoli and rice pilaf.  A little time consuming but totally worth it!

I need help. The butter went everywhere and the chicken completely opened up. 

Could you please describe, maybe with photos how to “wrap” the chicken around the butter?  I folder the narrow part up and over the butter, and then pushed the sides up and around the butter...and then what?  The sides just fall back into place and the narrow part sort of slumps back...do you bind it somehow?

Worth the time and effort put into this. Came out moist and and crispy.
Next time I would add some more seasonings and let the fried chicken rest on paper towels and blot to absorb some grease, since it came out very greasy.  I  would also put a cooling rack on the sheet pan so the grease can drip off while cooking. 

Will be making again for sure.

Very good and directions are easy to follow. I have deep fryer which worked perfect for the first part of the cooking process. Will use the the same process for cordon blue and other ideas.

I’ve tried various chicken Kiev recipes, and this one is the absolute best. Yes, it involves some planning and prep, but it is not difficult.  Watch the video before you make it. This meal will wow your guests and family.

This is really a great recipe. I've found and made others that use toothpicks to hold the Kievs together and they really are a pain. I'm so pleased that this  recipe has no need for the toothpicks. This is a great step-by-strp guide. My Kievs turned out beautiful and tasted great; not one leaked.

This method was PERFECT! It did not unfold or leak! I accidentally put a bit too much salt in the butter, but that is on me. It was otherwise perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I would highly recommend!

As the recipe states, this is not an easy meal to make but worth the effort.  My first mistake was not having a candy thermometer to measure the temp of the oil. It was to hot and my first batch burnt a bit.  I also found it important to not overcook as the inside juices tend to evaporate a bit. It was tender and delicious however and I will be making it again. Very good and impressive if you can pull it off but practice before serving to a picky person.

chicken breasts were larger than specified and took longer to get the pink out. Dinner guest thought it was king of spicy (the dash of red pepper?) but I didn't think so.
Flattening chicken breasts is an acquired skill but the meal turned out quite well.

This was  good but the butter leaked out so I didn't get the juicy sauce from the butter filling that I expected.  Time intensive but not difficult, especially with the video.  I started with thin sliced chicken and some pieces fell apart when I pounded it to 1/4 inch.  I may have fried it too long, too.

This was so good!  I didn't have the time to to let the chicken sit in the freezer in the middle of the recipe so it was a little difficult to handle when getting it fried.  All I could say was delicious, and I'll be making this again soon.

So good!!!  I've never had Chicken Kiev before but am sooo glad  I tried this recipe.  I watched the video first which was definitely helpful.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used my microplaner for the garlic--I would still be crushing it with my mortar and pestle if I hadn't deserted that method!  Time consuming but really not difficult.  I will certainly make this again.

Pretty spectacular. We followed the directions exactly and it turned out great, except for the smaller one. The meat in one of the folds was still pink and uncooked. It was probably more frozen than the larger one and needed another 2 minutes in the oven.

Chicken Kiev is one of my husband's favorite dishes!  We were both very impressed with this recipe.  It's very juicy and tender!
I won't be 'buying' kiev any more, but will always be making it from scratch!!

Really nice dish.  The chicken was very tender.  I had the oil too hot and it browned way faster than I intended.  Other than that, the dish was not as difficult as it seems.  Was a bit time consuming.

I picked up this version from a mystery novel some 50 years ago and, because I have severe arthritis in my hands, make it only for special occasions.  I pound the chicken breasts into 1/8" pieces (very carefully or they'll break away), salt and pepper, then put a finger's worth of mixed butter and parsley into each piece of breast,  wrap them up (tucking in the ends), then put them in the freezer for about an hour or so to set the meat.   In the meantime, I've taken a stick of Saltines, put it into a freezer bag, and crushed the crackers into fine pieces with a rolling pin.  When the meat pieces hold together well, I dip them in a beaten mixture of milk and egg then drop a few at a time into the bag of crumbs until they are well coated.  When they've all been coated well, I put them back into the freezer for another hour.  When I'm satisfied that they're holding up well, I ease a few at a time into the deep fryer.  They're done when golden all over, about 4-5 minutes.  Let them drain for a minute, serve, and let your guests cut into the meat.  Once the butter and parsley mix oozes out over and into the meat, you'll hear nothing but oohs and aahs.   The leftovers are terrific the next day -- if you have any.  I allow for two breasts per person.  The next time, I'll try adding some garlic and use tarragon instead of parsley, taking some good hints from Chef John and others who reviewed his recipe.

What I liked about this recipe was the method for stuffing the chicken breasts.  Fantastic.  It was time consuming, but if you want a stuffing that won't leak out, this is the way to do it.  I'll use this method for any stuffed chicken recipe.  The final result was a little disappointing due to lack of flavor.  Needed more salt.  I may have failed to use enough during preparation.  But It's my opinion that salted butter instead of the unsalted would have yielded a much more flavorful outcome.

Made this tonight served over rice and it was delicious. I had to use dry parsley as I was out of fresh and I do not own a mortar & pestle so I just minced the garlic and stirred everything together well.  I also had to bake mine a little longer but I did use big chicken breasts.  The detailed instructions made it easy. Will definitely make again.

A lot of steps… not sure I'd make it again, at least not for a while. But it was good! I made as directed, but found it tough to get the chicken to the right thickness. Then when I folded it up, it didn't quite stay put. The freezing step helped, though, and it fried quite nicely . I baked for about 22 minutes. When we cut into them, only one had the butter gush out. But they all tasted great!

Recipe is great, chicken is very tender and delicious. But it's called Chicken Kyiv and doesn't have anything in common with Russia or Russian cuisine.

Followed the recipe but the butter leaked on one of the chicken.  I've made this in the past using a different recipe, and wrapped both ends in before rolling it.  They seemed to stay intact better that way. Other than that, it was a good recipe.

This tasted amazing! My chicken wasn't as thin as the recipe calls for but still worked great. If it's not as thin, I recommend letting it freeze a little more before breading to allow the ends to stay together. Also, mine wasn't as wide so it was harder to bunch the tops together but using the plastic wrap helped! One of the balls didn't allow for the ends to come together so it leaked out a little, but still tasted fabulous!

This was outstanding! Not a week night dish for sure and worth the dirty dishes and effort. My mortar and pester is pretty small, so I started it there and finished in my mini food processor for the butter, garlic, and parsley mixture. I was kind of worried that the chicken wouldn't hold together, but it did! The only problem I had was different sized breasts. I cooked two not four. The smaller breast was perfectly cooked in 15 minutes. The larger one wasn't done all the way, so go with about 20 minutes in the oven. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I will definitely make this again and again.

Love, love this recipe.  I am one of your biggest fan, Chef John!  When I log into allrecipes.com, I always try searching for receipes under your name first.  I love all of your receipes -- they are never a disappointment.  I followed this receipe to detail and although it isn't a fast meal to do, it is very much worth all of the time and work.  My son and I loved it! Next time, I would just add lemon to the butter along with the parsely and garlic.  We just ate this for dinner last night (2/5/15).  I also made the Ultimate Chocolate Dessert last night for our dessert, which was the peak of our night -- delish!  See the photos of this meal I cooked.

Very good, but somewhat traditional. I use a very heart healthy recipe which is low fat and thus, low calorie. It is absolutely delicious. We have served it at fundraising events and people always rave about it. I will submit it to All recipies very soon.
