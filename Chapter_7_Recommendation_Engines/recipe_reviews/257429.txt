I have made this from another recipe and its very easy and tasty. The only difference is my recipe uses 1 tsp of sesame oil, 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1 tsp rice wine vinegar. I like those ratios better than this recipes. I think it is a matter of taste. But it's a great recipe and I recommend it highly.

This was a hit at my home.  I have made this twice.  I shredded a head of cabbage and a couple of carrots the 1st time.  This gave a much better flavor than the bag coleslaw, which was still delicious and much simpler to make on a weeknight.  I replaced the pork with  ground chicken and served over rice.    I also added some Thai chili spice to give it some kick.

Great taste even though I did not add lemon zest. Substituted chicken for sausage. Added zucchini for additional veggies and turned out wonderful!

I used hamburger instead of sausage and onions and portabella mushrooms also. Truly a quick and delicious meal. I omitted the sesame oil .

I made this in my Instant Pot using 1 lb of ground chicken. I also used Trader Joe's Asian Dipping Sauce instead of soy sauce and it was a home run!  I'll be making again.

I made this, with a few changes ,for a church dinner. I used ground pork/ ground beef mixture and added teriyaki sauce and just a little brown sugar. It  disappeared quickly  and I had numerous request for the recipe.
