Hello.  I am the one who submitted this recipe, however when AllRecipe listed it, a few things were misprinted.  I do not use ANY onions, and I sautee the mushrooms in margarine until they are fully cooked (actually they are pretty soggy), and top the chicken with them after the chicken is removed from the oven.  Then I top with the Honey Mustard (although, my Wee Ones dip instead)  I hope you enjoy!

OK So how do I give this beauty 10 stars?
It was moist, flavorful, easy and quick. What's not to love?? I am a retired chef with over 30 years of cooking chops to my credit and I found NOTHING to complain about here. "All things in moderation." We all need to relax and give ourselves permission to splurge occasionally.

This is a really good chicken dish.  I marinated the chicken over night and they came out so flavorfull.  However I did not broil them (I have had really bad "broiling" experiences I think its my oven WINK* WINK*)  I baked them at 350 and they came out really moist.  After they finished baking I topped them off with the bacon and cheese, but did not use honeymustard (I didn't have any) Will make again :)

Delicious! But my, how fattening! OMG!  I grilled the chicken and the bacon on my George Foreman grill to make the recipe a little bit healthier.  I then added the bacon to the cooked chicken and the cheese on top, and put it in the oven on "broil" for about 4 minutes to melt the cheese. Lastly, I sauteed half a small onion along with my fresh mushrooms, added that on top, and used a low fat honey dijon as a topping. Heavenly dish!!:-)  I hope I at least knocked off 20 grams of fat doing it my way though!  Ally

This is a keeper.  All my husband could say is "WOW!"  I marinated the chicken overnight and cooked the mushrooms in the same pan as the bacon.  Cooked the chicken on the grill and added the bacon and cheese at the end.  Served with steamed broccoli and fresh corn on the cob.

I've made this several times and I have to say it's the best recipe I've found on this site. It's easy but tastes special. I made it for a dinner for my friends and they loved it. One of them made a variation of it for the staff Christmas party at our church last year(50+ people). I also use a double-sided electric grill to cook the chicken then after assembling the other prepared(cooked)ingredients, I broil them for a minute to melt the cheese. DO use a good quality honey mustard dressing or make your own, forget the cheapos, they won't do. If you can find it in your area, "Brianna's" is the absolute best honey mustard dressing!!...high YUM factor!! Thanks :)

This is a fantastic recipe! My whole family loved it and we will be eating it again soon! I took the advice of other reviewers and I cooked the chicken a little longer than the recipe says and it came out perfect. I found that it required about 8-10 minutes on each side instead of 5 minutes each side. GREAT RECIPE!

This dish had so much flavor and was so easy, my husband thought I slaved for hours.  I grilled the chicken and used a one skillet method.  I browned the bacon and set aside, then the mushrooms and set aside.  Then I placed the chicken in the skillet topped with prepared honey mustard dressing, mushrooms, bacon and cheese and broiled until bubbly.  Ummm.  I can't wait to have it again and again.

This was just OK.  I'm really not sure what all of the excitement is about with this recipe.  To me it tastes like a recipe that you would find on a bun in some restaurant chain.  I wasn't too thrilled by the taste.  My husband said it was just OK, and he certainly wouldn't request that I make this again.  Only my son (12) liked it, but then again he would enjoy something like this at one of the chain restaurants.  A disappointment to me, as I find too many recipes here have 5 stars and they are just average.  I'm beginning to wonder if folks have never eaten really, really, good food.

Delicious!! I used a lot less Worcestershire sauce by wrapping it in a plastic bag and marinating at least half a day.

Very good, but similar to "Aussie Chicken" on this site, which I like just one "star" better.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for the family and in-laws for Mother's day and was a real hit.  The chicken came out surprisingly moist.  I'm a fan of Worcestershire sauce but it can be overwhelming...not here, was just right.  Tip: gently warm the honey mustard dressing before topping the chicken with it and slightly undercook the bacon before putting it on the chicken as it will cook further when it all goes back in the over and the small amount of bacon fat that cooks out gets into the chicken and adds a nice smoky quality to the chicken breast.  Enjoy!

I love this chicken dish as does all my family. It's one that is considered a "special" dinner as it is high in fat. Will make again and again!

I am still learning to cook and This was the first recipe I have ever made for dinner and it was EXCELLENT! It tasted almost exactly like the one at outback. My dad was so impressed, he didn't believe that I cooked it by myself. I made frozen fries to go with it, and I burned them. My father jokes "How do you make a main course as good as that, but burn frozen fries?" 
  I used half as much worchetshire sauce because alot of people said it was too strong, but I will use the amount called for next time. I marinated it for 4 hours. It was soo tender! and I used twice as much cheese. we love cheese

Delicious without any modifications. Luckily, it's easy to avoid the problem of fat and calorie content without any real modifications.  I simply use low fat ingredients. You can even use no fat cheese with little sacrifice in flavor.  For the dressing, making your own with low fat mayo (or even yoghurt) can cut the fat & calories dramatically.

VERY DELICIOUS!  and SOOO easy!  I grilled my chicken rather than broiling it, and topped with cheese and bacon, then broiled it to melt the cheese.  Cooked the bacon, and then added the mushrooms and cooked them in the bacon remains, rather than butter.  Served with Ken's Honey Mustard..YUMMY!  Will be making this again and again!

This recipe is good, but not that good.  First, you need to double the broiling time or chicken is NOT done.  Second, I used only HALF the 16 oz bottle of dressing called for, and the four breasts were completely drowned in it.  We couldn't taste the cheese, mushrooms, or marinade at all.  All we could taste was dressing.  I added some sweet cooked onions too, just because we love them.  Next time, I will make homemade dressing and just drizzle it on, or leave it off entirely and offer as a dipping sauce.  I'm also considering baking instead of broiling next time.

This was really good. But as much as I would like to give this more stars I can't because I modified it a bit and turned this into a sandwich recipe because we weanted samdwiches instead of a full meal for dinner. So here it goes. I pounded the chicken breast into filets and then marinated them in a mix of the honey mustard dressing and worcestershire sauce for about 4 hours.  I seasoned the chicken in salt , pepper, garlic powder, and paprika then put them on my george foreman grill.  About 10 minutes in topped each filet with pre-cooked bacon, swiss cheese, and monterey jack cheese.  Let the cheese melt and served on whole wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles. YUM! My family loved this.

Awesome recipe!!!  I didn't use the whole bottle of dressing just squirted about 1-2 Tbsp on before I put the cheese on to broil.  This was a great recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing

This dish was really good!  I used turkey bacon to make it a *little* bit healthier and substituted caramelized onions for the mushrooms since my roommate and I don't care for mushrooms.  Very delicious!

This was a wonderful recipie. I did, however, change a few simple things. I marinated the chicken in the morning and let it sit all day in the fridge- much better. Also, I use colby-jack cheese and it was perfect. Finally, I served the dressing on the side for individual dipping. Overall a fabulous recipie. One of my favorites!

Good eats!  I used real bacon bits instead of bacon (I do this with broccoli salad and it works great) and it really cut down on the prep. and tasted great.  I just sprinkled them over the cheese a minute or so before chicken was ready.  Anyway, I'm on Atkin's so I didn't use the honey mustard and it was yummy.  Thanks!

I am a chicken lover to start with, my husband is not a fan of chicken however and he loved this.I did make a few revisions to it. I did not use worcestershire to marinate though, I used fat free Italian dressing and I allowed it to marinate in the fridge for a few hours. I also did not saute my mushrooms in butter, instead I used a little bit of olive oil. I used turkey bacon in place of regular bacon and I made my own dressing so that it would be a little healthier.

5 stars. When I lived in NC there was an Outback steak house, everytime I went I would order the alice chicken. I now live in NY and there is not an outback, but this recipe must be theirs. It taste just like it.

Excellent recipe.  Cooked the mushrooms along with a chopped onion in the bacon grease with a dab of butter.  Used extra sharp cheddar because it's all I had, otherwise followed recipe directions.  Will make this again and again, much to the chagrin of my arteries.  =)

Yum:) Did not use honey mustard dressing.  I cooked my chicken on 375 for 30 rather than the broiling it for 5 minutes. My neighbor and I cooked this recipe together. She did as instructed and broiled hers and it took forever to cook through her chicken. So I cooked my as I normally would on 375 and followed the rest of instructions.  Turned out very tasty.  Would also recommend sliced chesse rather than the shredded so it would hold better.  My bacon kept falling off the chicken only using shredded cheese.  Will definitely cook again with sliced cheese.  Yum:)

Very good dish.  Used the Forman grill and used sliced cheese instead of shredded.  Tastes and ingredients are very similar to the Aussie Chicken from this site.  Thanks for the post.

This is the best!  I've substituted all kinds of different cheeses & barbequed the chicken, You can even make it a sandwich! YUM.  My husband hates mushrooms but LOVES this dish! The Creamy Honey Mustard (PC) dressing is the best. PC has changed their dressing it is now Blue Menu honey dijon yogurt dressing. Still great!

This turned out great!  My boyfriend only ever orders the Alice Springs Chicken at Outback and said he really enjoyed this recipe.  I used my George Foreman Grill to cook the bacon and chicken, then put under the broiler to melt it all.  I sauteed onions with the mushrooms in the butter and a little more worstershire sauce. Also used Marie's honey mustard from the refridgerated section of the produce department. Also used combination of cheddar and mozzeralla cheese.  Will prepare again!

The recipe was realy good. The only thing that would make more since is to use slice cheese rather than shredded cheese because shredded makes a mess. We used a mixture of cheddar and jack. Kids loved it, husband loved it, it was great!

Very moist! I cook the bacon on parchment paper in the oven and reserve the grease to cook the mushrooms in instead of butter. Very rich, but a nice treat!

The ideas & flavors are great in combination, but the health impact here is NUTS!
---
To adjust I cut the bacon to 1 thick slice per chicken breast, added a whole onion (carmelized), cut the cheese in half and used just 1 serving (2T) of the honey mustard per piece of chicken.  This brings the recipe down to 410 Calories from 930
--- Five Stars 4 taste, 2 for health impact as is.  I rated 4 stars for the quality of the base recipe.

So delicious.  My son said it was the best chicken he ever ate.  He claimed he was in chicken heaven.  He even ate and loved the mushrooms even though he claims he is allergic to mushrooms! That is a 9 year old for you!

I have made another recipe on this site, "Aussie Chicken" and it is exactly like the Alice Springs Chicken served at that famous "outback" restaurant....this one is a bit different, but the other one tastes just like the menu item at the restaurant....this is a bit easier and almost as good.

Excellent recipe!  I used thin breast fillets to speed up the cooking process, and the broiling method makes this recipe very speedy on a weeknight.  The only changes I made were to use pre-cooked bacon (i just heated it for a few minutes on a cookie sheet in the oven), and I drizzled the honey mustard over the chicken before I put the cheese on top.  We will definitely be having this one again!

this is just like my favorite dish at a restaurant chain, and when I saw it I had to try it. Fabulous. Very easy to make. I made the chicken on the stovetop, and added a garlic clove to the mushrooms with the butter. My family loves colby, so I used that instead - will make again!

Soo yummy! I did add a 1/4 of a medium sized yellow onion (chopped) with two minced garlic cloves to the mushrooms as they simmered.  I also used turkey bacon and lite honey mustard dressing to help cut back on the calories a bit, and it was very tasty!!!

I love Outback's Alice Springs Chicken, but when I go there a I want a steak.  Now I can fix Alice Springs Chicken at home and it tastes like the real thing.  I grill the chicken and finish it off in the oven to melt the cheese.  Also, I use a slice of Colby Jack cheese instead of the shredded Jack called for in the recipe.  Yum!  It is always a hit.

This was a wonderful dish. I grilled my chicken and bacon in my George Foreman grill to quicken the time up and cut down on the fat and calories. I used Newmans Own light honey mustard salad dressing and was very pleased with the flavor. We also put the chicken on a sesame seed bun with lettuce and tomato and baked french fries to make a quick and easy lunch. This one's in the recipe box for sure!

I made this months ago and forgot to rate it. I've made it a few times and it's always good, but we don't use the honey mustard dressing because we don't care for it in this recipe. I love honey mustard otherwise, just not on this chicken.

This recipe is fantastic, and incredibly easy. I used Mozzarella and Cheddar in equal portions instead of Monterey Jack, and I also placed the chicken breasts (still frozen) in a zipper baggie with the worchestershire sauce and let them thaw in the fridge for several hours.

This chicken was so moist.  It was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I didn't know chicken could be this tender.  I used large chicken breasts--and since I cooked them on a foil-lined (sprayed with a little Pam) jelly roll pan--I put the pan on the middle oven rack while broiling (so any grease would not ignite).  It took me a lot longer to get the chicken done--closer to 10 minutes on each side.  It only took 1-2 minutes to melt the cheese.  I also used cheddar cheese with the monterey jack.  The chicken is almost as good with less cheese and no bacon. We also liked the honey-mustard dressing on the side.  My husband actually said these were the best chicken breast I had ever made.  Thanks Misty.

I thought this recipe was really good, but I made it a bit differently (in my mind easier cause I hate using my broiler): I cooked the bacon (thick sliced maple syrup flavored) most of the way through.  Then I sautéed the mushrooms until they were almost completely tender/cooked.  Then I browned the chicken and used the Worcestershire sauce in cooking it (probably 2 - 4 tbs.).  Then I took the chicken out and cut it into large bite-sized pieces.  Then I put the chicken, bacon, and mushrooms back in the pan and set it on med-low and added the honey mustard dressing... just enough to have a couple of spoonfuls per plate after coating the meat.  Then I served it over rice and added the cheese.  It was delicious!

Love this recipe! Marinated in worcestershire all day and was most tender and juicy chicken we've ever had. My kid's liked this with French dressing instead of the honey mustard. Also, I think next time, I'll put the mushrooms on top of the bacon and then put the cheese on so they don't slide off!

What I did was sauté the chicken just to give it color then placed in casserole dish I put chicken ,mushroom,bacon then honey mustard and baked at 350 for 30mins last 5 mins I put Swiss cheese n they were perfect ! So good!

This was SOOOO out of my comfort zone and it was AWESOME!! I don't even like the smell of Worcestershire sauce and don't really eat mushrooms but I'm trying new things and the picture was what sold me so I figured I'd give it a shot. This was FANTASTIC! The only thing I added was sauteed sweet onions b/c I figured I could stand the mushrooms better if there was also onions with them. And another reviewer was correct when she said the honey mustard sauce made this recipe... Again, I don't use dips or sauces for anything and I wasn't planning on even trying it with the sauce but I'm glad hubby pushed me to at least try one bite, OMG what a difference!!! There is alot of calories in this dish so it won't be made often but it will defiantly be made again! THANKS!

Very close to Outback's.  I noticed some people didn't like because they marinated the chicken in the honey mustard dressing.  Only marinate in the Worcestershire sauce!  The honey mustard is for topping after its cooked!  I would recommend using fillets rather than thick chicken breasts.  5 mins on ea side was not long enough. With a thick breast it's closer to 12 mins on ea side.  Next time I'll use sliced cheese rather that shredded.  Very good recipe, that both my teenagers and I liked.  Will make again with just those two changes.

! I browned my chicken &cooked the bacon on the stovetop rather than dealing w/ the cleanup of the broiler pan (yuck!) . Then I put it together in a glass baking dish, topped the chicken w/ the bacon & cheese, & then stuck it in the oven @ 350 for about 5 minutes. It turned out incredibly good! I will definately use this recipe again!

I felt that the chicken was very dry even with the toppings. We ended up using ranch dressing because the honey mustard dressing doesn't taste well with it. I like the combo of topping but next time I will marinate it in something other than worcestersher sauce

Absolutely delicious! I flattened chicken before marinading. Then I grilled on my indoor JennAir grill.
Assembled as per directions and put under broiler for just a couple of minutes. Covered w/ sauteed mushrooms.

Fairly simple and Fairly decent. I used tad bit more worchestershire sauce (some things i measure visually) and only half of the dressing. Came out delicious and paired nicely with some jalapeno poppers for like a southwesterny meal. Might consider adding some onions next time.

This was amazing. I changed the recipe a bit though. I broild chicken until almost done. I placed sliced raw mushrooms on top of the chicken, the bacon on top of that, and then topped with a mixture of cheddar and smoked gouda cheese. Broiled for a few minutes longer. TUrned out great. I didnt use any honey mustard dressing. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will continue to tweek it. Tasty!

I truly can't understand the rating for this dish.  The Worcestershire is overpowering, and the bacon and cheese don't seem to belong here.  None of the flavors "click" together.  Your chicken would probably be happier in another recipe.

My whole family LOVED this recipe!  I baked it in a 350 oven (because I was baking something else as well).  Crumbled the bacon, put the mushrooms on & broiled the cheese over the top of it all.  Yummmmmy!

If you want to do this fast use the precooked bacon. For flavor and less calories, use Brummel & Brown. And for an extra kick, use 1/2 peppered cheese. You can save more calories if you use 1/2 can of either chicken or mushroom soup. I never get away with mushrooms, so made some with grilled peppers, over rice or fried potatoes in the drippings...it is a keeper.
I always have that on hand, the bacon, ready in 30 seconds.
Great for BLTs in the summer.
Another hint, use canned tomatoes in the winter, drain them and slice very thin. You will get away with it, much better than hot house in the winter...waiting for summer tomatoes.

Great dish. This is pretty close to the way resturants make it.

Made this tonight and was very pleased.  I have never broiled any meat so I was a little hesitant but came out perfect.  Followed the recipe except I found a recipe for the Honey Mustard off this site and used it.  It was excellent together.  The recipe is Honey Mustard Dressing I by dpapel.  My husband kept raving about how good this was.  I will be making this very often.  Thanks for your recipe.

I like this recipe but I didn't love it. I think it sounded better than it tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was good but not as delicious as I was expecting. It broiled perfectly, so no problems there.. I think it's just a taste issue. The tastes of monterey jack cheese and honey mustard dressing are very predictable and ho-hum to me. But thank you for posting nonetheless... it's always a joy to try new recipes regardless of the outcome.

I wrapped the bacon around the chicken without browning/cooking either one and baked at 375 for about an hour, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. We all loved it, and my husband and 14 year old daughter are not easy to please!

Wonderful!  It is a little hard to eat with the bacon, cheese, and mushrooms on top.  I would suggest butterflying the chicken breasts before broiling, then stuffing them with the bacon, cheese, and mushrooms.  That way, all the goodies won't slide out as easily.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! My wife and I loved this. I did sautee onions with the mushrooms and I poured the dressing on the plate and set the chicken on top of it instead of pouring it on top of the chicken.

This way ok, nothing great though.  If I was to make this again I think I'd just leave off the bacon and cheese, and just make the mushrooms into a sauce with the dressing and serve like that.

This was a great recipe.  Over the chicken, I put one layer of cheese, bacon, mushrooms, then topped with another layer of cheese, then stuck it in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes.  Great with rice, too.  Very filling!Thanks!!

This is just like "Alice Springs Chicken" from Outback Steakhouse. And if you want to make it like the restaurant, the mushrooms and bacon both go underneath the cheese under the broiler... not the mushrooms on top and garnish it with parsley.

My children wanted Aussie chicken again for dinner so I decided to try this recipe. I still omitted the mushrooms and my kids LOVE Lea & Perrins. Bought a jar of O'Charley's honey mustard sauce. This was a hit! With teens you never really know if they even tasted it as they inhale it, but they said that they did! ;-) This, too, is a very good recipe. I did brown the chicken in the pan I fried the bacon in and didn't use butter. Thank you.

Very easy to make.  I baked my chicken 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes, covered.  I sauted 3 tblsp. butter with portabella mushrooms, 1/2 large onion, and 1/2 tsp. garlic.  The chicken tasted great with Brianna's Honey Mustard sauce and mushroom mixture.  Served with a baked potato which I put in the same time as the chicken, corn and cranberry jelly. *Update* We had left overs the next day and the chicken had a lot more flavor.  I will try this recipe again and marinate it overnight.

This was a very good recipie, but how I hate cleaning those broiler pans - was finished much quicker than I expected - that was nice.  However, given the fat content and calorie count, I think I'd skip it or alter it for next time.

The directions are not completed well, in my opinion.  I decided to saute the mushrooms and onions both and add the dressing to them. I then topped the chicken with this mushroom/onion/dressing "topping." I didn't want to eat raw mushrooms with dressing- or maybe the directions just weren't complete. In any event, this was the best chicken I've ever made. 
It really is delicious!!!

This recipe is also terrific when using Mont Jack and Cheddar combined and then prepared on the grill.  The kids enjoy  dunking in the honey mustard.

This is simple and delicious. It has become my family'/ favorite weeknight meal. You must use Breanna's honey mustard dressing. It makes the dish.

Super, super easy recipe! Great with or without the mushrooms. I'll cut both a slice of monterey jack and colby jack cheese from the block cheeses. Very flavorful and if done correctly it shouldn't be dry. If the breasts are really large I'll cut them in half to make them thinner. Great to have leftovers for lunches! Definately have put this in the regular dinner rotation. I typically leave out the bacon just to save on fat and calories. I usually just make honey mustard from one of the recipes from this site. A note on the broiler: don't use the top rack of the oven with the broiler pan, drop it down to the next rack. I also put foil in the bottom of the broiler pan for easy clean up (of at least one part of the pan).

Wow, this was very good.  I did what another reviewer suggested and used the same pan for the mushrooms that I did the bacon in, removed most of the fat first...I only had cheddar cheese, no biggie, and I used the Honey Mustard II recipe from this site (very good!).  The end result was really really really good.  My husband was over the moon.  Thank you! ***edit to add, just a week later, that when I informed my husband that Tuesday after labor day our diet starts again, the first thing he asked was, "can you make that chicken again before we start?"  So, our last meal before getting back on the diet wagon will be Alice Chicken, we plan to thoroughly enjoy it =)

My teen daughter said, "This is really good, Mom" -- TWICE! This is unheard of. :) I added a bit of broth, onion powder, seasoned salt, and whole peppercorns to the marinade, mostly because I was running lower on Worcestershire than I realized. Also cheated with pre-cooked bacon slices, just for convenience. Ended up broiling about 8 minutes per side plus three minutes to melt the cheese (thick chicken!). Used Ken's Honey Mustard and let everyone add their own mushrooms to accommodate the non-mushroom-fans.  Served with rice pilaf and steamed asparagus. Thank you for this recipe!

I made and the entire family of 6 enjoyed and they all asked if I'd make it again.  I wasn't able to find honey mustard salad dressing so I used prepared honey mustard which is a lot lower in calories and it tasted great.  This is absolutely a keeper!!

Recipe sounds yummy but this a formula for a heart attack to clog your arteries.   930 calories is way too much - looks good but no way... Sorry

Very good, but I cut down the honey mustard by at least half.  I think next time I'll try serving these in a sandwich.

I am not usually successful when cooking meat but this was easy and turned out great!  I added some honey mustard glaze just before I put the chicken under the broiler and then again when I turned it.  Everyone raved!

This was so good! I made it without the mushrooms (Hubby HATES them) and wrapped the bacon around the chicken instead of frying it first. Most tender chicken I've ever had!

VERY similar to outback! Relatively easy but looks impressive. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and added toppings at the end. I think the honey mustard dipping sauce is a must. I used the Honey Mustard Dressing II from this website with nonfat plain greek yogurt instead of mayo...hubby couldn't even tell it wasn't store bought! Will make again.

Loved this recipe!!!  So easy and quick to make.  I put the mushrooms and some sauteed onions on top of the chicken along with the bacon and cheese.  A big hit with my family.  Will make many times more!!!!!

Delicious! I didn't have an hour to marinade the chicken, so I just poured some worch. sauce over the chicken while I prepped. I did put the honey mustard on the chicken, then layered the bacon then cheese and mushrooms and baked until cheese was melted. I loved this!!!

So good! Had this at Outback before & loved it. We are more ranch people than honey mustard so we substituted that, but either would be great! Thanks for sharing!

Very good - and so easy! I halved the bacon and cheese to save a few calories and it was still delicious. Made the Honey Roasted Red Potatoes from Allrecipes to go with it.

I made this with a few variations, using what I had in the house.  It was wonderful.  I just had a bit of mushrooms so I threw in a tad of spinach and onions I had left and only had Swiss cheese, I never vary from a recipe (I'm not that creative) but this turned out excellent.  I want to add that I believe the original recipe is great and I intend to follow that recipe the next time.

This recipe was delicious!  I always get this dish at Outback Steakhouse and never really looked for a recipe online for it; just stumbled across this yesterday when I was looking for something new to do with chicken.  A definite staple in my menu.

This was pretty good.  I forgot to marinate the chicken before hand so I just poured some worchs sauce on while it was cooking.  I cooked the chicken on the George Foreman grill because it is faster and gets a lot of the fat out of the chicken.  I used prosciutto instead of bacon because I had it on hand.  Other than that I followed the directions.  It tasted great with honey mustard sauce.  It was a little salty but I think that was due to the prosciutto.

Loved this! I did not have honey mustard dressing so I smeared honey mustard on the chicken and baked for a few minutes before adding the cheese and bacon. My husband called dibbs on the leftovers for his lunch the next day before he was done with dinner.

Made this exactly as written except for sautéing the mushroom in the same pan as I fried the bacon in to save a pan. (and left a thin coating of bacon fat in the pan instead of using butter).

It was a HUGE hit at dinner and everyone raved about it.  I thought the Worcestershire taste was a little strong, but everyone else thought it was great.

One thing I had a problem with was that when broiling the Worcestershire sauce that leaks out of the chicken when broiling really burns and set off all the smoke detectors.  I'll have to drain the pieces more next time or something.

Great recipe exactly as written.  Cooking time was perfect as well for me under the broiler. (and I am overly paranoid about chicken being underdone).  Will add this to regular rotation.

This is exactly like a menu item in a certain "Aussie style" chain restaurant.   Very delicious.  I couldn't find any honey mustard dressing at TJ's so I found a recipe on this site: honey mustard dressing II.  The dressing was wonderful and complimented the chicken perfectly, but if you make your own (I recommend it, the recipe is super easy) make sure you let the dressing sit in the fridge for at least an hour to let the flavor develop.   I served just like the restaurant would with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  I also feel they way I served was a lot less calories than the restaurant because we did eat as much and I made the potatoes healthier.  Great recipe, thanks for posting!

This has a nice flavor and cooking the chicken under the broiler kept it moist. I did feel it taste similar to a restraurant item called Alice Spring Chicken. I recommend it to anyone interested in making it.

Very easy.  I cooked my chicken on the george foreman grill.  I used canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh ones.  My husband was thrilled since it's his favorite dish from Outback.

I pounded the chicken so they would cook evenly.  Love mushrooms but they are not necessary to this recipe.  So if you don't like them, you can skip them.

Very good!  I thought it was a bit salty... but maybe next time I will tweak a few thing and try and make it less salty.  Other than that it was wonderful!  By the way, I used olive oil on the mushrooms rather than butter.

With more fat in one serving of chicken than you should have in a whole day, this better taste, look, and smell like a slice of heaven.  But it doesn't.

Very. very tasty. My family raved about it! I made a few changes to the ingredients to make it healthier. First, I removed the bacon, used grapeseed oil instead of butter, reduced the cheese from 8 ounces to 6 ounces and the honey mustard salad dressing to 13 ounces. The taste was still fantastic! Not bland at all.

This was so good that my picky-eater son declared, "This is the best chicken recipe you've ever made!"  He's 21 and apparently has endured more than his fair share of mediocre chicken dinners.

I use one of the other recipes for this and everyone loves it. Lately, I have started cutting the chicken into more "chicken tender" sized pieces before they are marinated.  I saute them for 5-7 minutes, brush them with a little honey-mustard dressing, put them in a 9x13 pan and layer on the mushrooms, bacon and cheese and put them under the broiler to melt the cheese.  This is easier for my grandkids to eat and I can make half with mushrooms and half without.  I also use the real bacon bits sometimes to save time.  It's always wonderful.

Though not light on calories, it was good.  Omitted the mushrooms and did sauteed onions and sweet peppers on mine instead.  Also used turkey bacon.  Gave kids their choice of dipping sauces: barbecue, honey mustard or ranch and all 4 of them actually ate it!  Broiling method worked better than I thought it would.

So good!! Tasted just like the Outbacks. WE loved it!! This is what my husband asked for for Fathers Day this year, since he loves Alice Springs chicken from Outback We served them with baked sweet potatoes, a salad, and my kids wanted some of the "Aussy" cheese fries like they get at outback. Thanks for a great recipe, it's going into my weekly meal menu!

We love this chicken and think it tastes just like Outback.  Who would believe that marinating chicken in Worcestershire Sauce would make such a difference!  we cooked the chicken on the barbeque (just because living in Florida we grill all the time!) and added cheddar cheese.  If you go looking for leftovers, they are always all gone, no matter how much we make! Just wish they were a bit healthier!

My husband, mother, and myself loved this recipe. We're not big fans of crunchy bacon, so I wrapped the chicken with the bacon and then cooked it. I took a casserole dish put my chicken in it, added salt, pepper, a little garlic powder, and some minced onions. Then wrapped it with the bacon and poured Worcestershire sauce over it. Covered it with aluminum foil and baked it for 45 minutes on 350. Then added the cheese and let it melt. I left out the mushrooms because I don't like them. All in all this was a pretty good recipe.

This has been one of my favorite recipes for a few years. I prepare as written. The only change I make is sometimes for time sake I will use the pre-cooked bacon and cook chicken on the George Foreman grill. I also add more mushrooms (as I love musrooms). After preparing this dish a few times it doesn't seem so cumbersome and comes togther perfectly.

This was DELICIOUS! I baked it in the oven @ 375 for 20 minutes. Then I took it out and put cheese bacon and more cheese on (didn't have any mushrooms) And put it back in the oven for 10 minutes. YUM YUM YUM!

This was delicious.  I seared the chicken breast then baked instead of broiled.  Added sauted onions to the mushrooms.  Used Honey Mustard II dressing recipe from this site as others suggested.  Was very very good. Will definately make again. Boyfriend loved it and said to give 5 stars.

Made this for my bf and a dinner guest and it was a huge hit! The chicken looks odd coming out of the marinade, which caused us all to give each other leery looks, but the flavor was perfect. We grilled them rather than broil them and used a Mexi-blend cheese since it's what I had on hand. I also used the Honey Mustard Dressing II from this site and it was wonderful.

So wasy and so good. I used to work for the steakhouse that served this and this is as close as you can get to it in my opinion. I served it with Honey mustard II recipe from here and it was delicous!

Tasty and very easy. You can lighten the fat content without sacrificing much flavor by using just 1 ounce of cheese per breast, just 1 slice of bacon per breast and by using a "light" honey-mustard dressing (I like Ken's Lite). Also, I find it easier to keep the cheese on the chicken by using sliced rather than shredded.

I made this recipe last night and my husband loved it so much that he had 2 servings.  The honey mustard dressing for dip topped it off. The only thing I did different was I grilled the chicken on my digital george foreman grill after soaking it in the worchestershire sauce and I brushed the honey mustard onto the chicken while grilling. I love this dish, definitely a keeper.

This was a very easy to make recipe and I enjoyed it a lot.  I made a few modifications...  When sauteeing the mushrooms, first I used canola oil to which I added chopped garlic.  Then I realized the garlic was starting to burn and the shrooms were sticking, so I added a splash of white wine.

I also cooked my bacon in the microwave.

FYI, the recipe doesn't really need a whole bottle of honey mustard salad dressing.  It's to taste as you serve; I used a few splashes and my husband heavily drizzled his.

Oh so good! I also cooked my chicken at 375 for half hour, and they turned out perfect. Next time, I would put cheese below AND above the bacon to keep it from falling off. A keeper!

I did this a little differently so I could throw it together fast for a dinner party.  I marinated the chicken then grilled in the Foreman grill a day in advance.  I also sauted the mushrooms in advance.  Then the day of the dinner, I just put the chicken, honey mustard, pre-cooked bacon, mushrooms and warmed in the oven for a short time, then covered with colby-jack cheese and popped under the broiler when company arrived.  Everyone raved about it.  Absolutly delicious.  I will definately make this again!

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly except I put the mushrooms right on top of the bacon and added the cheese on top of that.  It was like the Alice Spring Chicken at the Outback, but made by me!!!  This was great with cheesy scallopped potatos and fresh veggies!  We also used honey mustard and ranch for dipping.

My boyfriend and I are not honey mustard fans so I made the recipe sans sauce but served it next to a side of asparagus with Hollandaise...it was nice to dip the chicken in a little of the Hollandaise sauce. I think, if seasoned enough, the flavor of the chicken is too good to mask with thick Honey Mustard - a light coat of Hollandaise every couple bites was enough for me! Overall a good recipe.

This recipe was so easy to make. My husband and I really enjoyed it. I marinated the chicken about 3 hours instead of 1. I also served the honey mustard on the side because it makes it easier to regulate how much you are using. That way all of your dressing doesn't go to waste trying to use the entire bottle (not to mention that honey mustard has quite a bit of fat in it). I'll definetly make it again!

This was one of those rare recipes that I tried that the WHOLE family really liked.  I have a picky 12 yr. old who rarely likes anything and even he complimented it!  I used baby portobello mushrooms and found we only needed about 4 oz. of the cheese.  Some used the dressing, others did not.  It was fabulous - deserves more than 5 stars!

I have very picky boys and they all LOVE this chicken.  I cook the chicken on our BBQ after marinating and add the bacon/cheese during the last few minutes of grilling. I omit the mushrooms as no one in my family will eat them.  Also, I tried the "chicken" worcestershire sauce, but found the beef to be our favorite.

I marinated the chicken for the whole hour & flipped it about every 20 minutes. Broiling the bacon for about 6 minutes was WAY easier than frying it. The chicken was very flavorful; most people in my family didn't even use the honey dijon. OH! KC Masterpiece makes a Honey Dijon Dip...it's very tasty (it's what we used to dip this chicken in.) I will cook this chicken again soon! Very easy!

I didn't know if I was supposed to pur the whole bottle of salad dressing over the chicken. It seemed like an awful lot, so we just added it ourselves. We did not even use 1/4 of the bottle. It also seemed like a lot of cheese. I used canned mushrooms, drained. We did enjoy it very much.

This was a very good dish.  Only I broiled the chicken too long and it came out dry.  I did make it again varying the recipe by omitting the Worcestershire sauce, baking the chicken and putting barbeque sauce on the last few minutes of baking.

Alice chicken and "Aussie Chicken" from this site are almost one and the same, with the exception that the latter recipe makes your own honey mustard sauce. However, I have yet to find a good bottled version of honey mustard dressing, which I think attribuited to this recipe's demise. Still, wouldn't make again and I don't think either recipe is worth the positive hype they recieve, esspecially when there are much more creative chicken recipes avaiable. Thanks anyways.

This is a great recipe we've already made several times. I varied it a little for convenience.  I used real bacon bits instead of frying the bacon and I used hot pepper cheese, which gave it a little kick.  Also for convenience, I grilled the chicken on my Geroge Forman Grill and then put the mushrooms, bacon and cheese on and broiled it in the toaster oven for just a few minuets.  It was so quick and so easy!

FANTASTIC!!  This recipe has already become a family favorite.  Hubby came home from work last night and had me write down the recipe so he could take it to work and pass it along!!  The only change was that I used a cheddar/mont jack mix. Thanks Misty!

It was superb!!! I made an addition to the recipe, I sauted some onions and minced garlic, and put it with the mushrooms. I used canned mushrooms since I didn't have any fresh ones. I used the honey mustard recipe in this site, it really added to the flavor. I didn't use as much worcestershire sauce. Will definitely use this recipe in the future!

I made this recipe exactly how the recipe states to make it. I was not so sure about the honey mustard, but my husband said it was wonderful (big compliment from him since he "says" he doesn't like chicken!), so I tried it with the honey mustard. It was one of the best chicken recipes I have ever tried. Definetly on my list to make again. Maybe next time I will try it on the grill...Thanks Misty!

This was delicious, my favorite chicken recipe now!   Taste and presentation is perfect for guests or special evenings!  This really gives the chicken a different taste.  It was difficult finding the honey mustard sauce ... I got the last bottle in the store, and couldn't find it at all at other stores.

This was very good though I felt the chicken was a bit dry. I would marinate for several hours more than called for or possibly overnight and then bake chicken instead of broiling. Otherwise it was very good. My very picky son loved it!!!

This was so easy to make and very very flavorful! I added extra portobello mushrooms and cheese! It did take about 10min to cook on each side not 5. and I used one skillet and sautéd the mushrooms in the bacon grease! I slightly under cooked the bacon and it crisped up at the end on broil. I also layered on the honey mustard  first on top of the chicken then added the mushrooms and bacon then another layer of dressing then lots of cheese covered in more mushrooms!  It was amazing! and super filling! I will be making this again!

It was good. I wouldn't say amazing.  Honey mustard would not be my choice to serve this with. It would have been better with something else.  My boys hated it. They couldn't get past the honey mustard.

This turned out okay, but I will tweak next time. I will add things to the marinade, mabe some honey or the honey mustard itself (I actually bought some and then didn't use it because I didn't think it would taste good dipped). I also took the leftover sauce, added some garlic, salt and pepper, wisked in some cornstarch and baked the chicken in it for about half an hour instead of broiling. After the chicken was done, I piled on the bacon, mushrooms and cheese, and it tasted pretty good. I think with some tweaks it will be a new fav!

I really like this alot, however...the reason I'm giving it 3stars is because it takes so much longer to cook than the recipe calls for.  It needs to be broiled almost 3times as long...very frustrating especially once the toppings are on!

This was awesome. I prefer to bake instead of broil, so I did. I can't eat onion or garlic, so I had to sub a homemade Worcestershire, but otherwise I cooked it as written. My husband loved it too.

This recipe has some of my favorite flavors! I grilled the chicken after pounding it flat, rather than broiling. Then, I spread about a T honey mustard on each piece before topping with bacon, mushrooms and cheese, then popping it in a warm oven to melt the cheese.

Quite delicious... made it last week and family already begging to have it again this week! My changes: added 1/3 c. onion, sauteed together with mushrooms. On top of chicken (almost fully broiled already w/just Worcestershire), add first bacon, then onions/mushrooms, then honey mustard dressing, then cheese and broiled alogether. Worked out great to use leftover Bojangles honey mustard dressing/dip packets.
UPDATE - 2 years later and this still has not been knocked off the pedestal of favorite family dish!

I didn't think this had the pop to it that I was expecting.  The chicken needs a different, more flavorful, marinade.  I would also grill it, rather than broil it, if I had to do it again.  For all the work it took to make it, it was just ok.

This recipe was so easy and SO DELICIOUS! This was my first time cooking chicken and it came out perfectly. I'm not a fan of mushrooms so I left those out and it was still flavorful! Not to mention, it won my boyfriend (Mr. I-only-eat-fried-chicken) over. Love it!

It was a hot day outside when I made this so instead of turning on my oven, I grilled the chicken breasts.  My 12 year old said it was the best chicken he's ever tasted. (But then again, you can never go wrong with bacon, cheese and mushrooms!).

This was really good. I think marinating in the worchestire is key. Very very moist and flavorful. I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. Evenmoreso when hubby gave a double eyebrow lift of approval! Thanks for a great recipe idea!

My family was not crazy about the flavor of Worcestershire and Honey Mustard. DS thought it might taste better with ranch instead. We also used sauteed onions rather than mushrooms since that is what we prefer.  This is not a fancy dish; but, it is very much like something you would order at a chain restaurant.  I would say this would be a good recipe to keep for those days when you want to eat out but, cannot afford to.  We will make this again; but, next time we will marinade the chicken in honey mustard instead.  Also, I think this dish would be good marinaded and topped with BBQ for a variation.  Made as is I would give this 3 stars; but, a different marinade would make this a 4 star recipe for us.
EDIT: I served this dish using Perdu Simply Smart breaded chicken and it was a major hit!  This goes great over a quality chicken strip!

YES! I made it tonight and the whole family loved it. We grilled our chicken on the outside gas grill before broiling. We used Jack with Jalapenos and three pepper Colby Jack because that is all I had in the house. Delicious.

I sauteed onions and garlic along with mushrooms (used baby bellas). Instead of Monterey Jack cheese we used a blend of marble cheddar and mozzarella. Made our ow honey mustard dipping sauce using a recipe from AR. I didn't care for the taste of the Worcestershire sauce as a marinade/flavour for the chicken. I will try a a different base next time that is more sweet and savoury, like a BBQ marinade.

Great recipe! I cooked this for my very picky boyfriend and he loved it.  I grilled the chicken and bacon on my George Foreman as suggested by another reviewer and then broiled it with the cheese.  It was awesome....and the honey mustard dressing really makes it.

This was very good and not all that tough to make. I forgot to set the honey mustard out and my wife ate it without. I used the mustard and it is what made the whole thing meld together. Delish, thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was very good. I did not have enough worchestershire as called for. But it was very good just the same.  The kids loved it.  If it is just like the Outback recipe, then it is worth the calories and fat grams as we usually eat very healthy. So, what a wonderful treat that I didn't have to pay 12.00 a plate for!!!

i followed this recipe to the T. I did not care for the taste of all the ingredients together.  even my husband thought it was a lot of costly ingredients.  needless to say i would not recommend it.

I am a diabetic and determined to control my disease thru diet, exercise, and oral meds only.  I think this is a great recipe, and, of course, to make it diabetic friendly, I have to be smart enough to substitute a few things.  But I sure do appreciate new recipes that I can fit into my needs.  For those who would like to try it but with less fat and/or carbs and you don't know how to do it, just ask your dietician.

It tastes somewhat similar to the "Alice Springs Chicken" or now the "Aussie Chicken" from the Outback Steakhouse. Yes, it has a lot of fat and cholesterol, but it is one of the Outback's better sellers and it is a good combination of ingredients and very fast and easy to prepare.

This is absolutely delicious! I only marinated the chicken for 30 minutes, but it was still delicious! We will definitely be making this again! Definitely make your own honey mustard dressing too... worth it!

My family loves this recipe. Hubby usually complains that baked chicken is too dry, but not on this! I use a honey mustard recipe that I found on here instead of the salad dressing, delish!!

This is really a 10! Pretty much followed the recipe but the mushrooms where on the side. The chicken was marinated for 2 hours, an hour on each side. We may not put the bacon on next time, just out of personal preference. Buying good honey mustard really added to the flavor. Can't wait to make this again.

Tried this recipe and was quite impressed! I did change a few things... I sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon grease and added a few minced onions! So good! I also baked the chicken @ 360 degrees as apposed to broiling it. All in all the recipe was really good and I do plan on using it again! Thanks for sharing! :)

My family really loved this dish. I put the honey mustard on the last few minutes of cooking and then the cheese and bacon and mushrooms on top. It all melted together into deliciousness. My husband has asked that I serve this again. Thanks for the great way to fix chicken, we sure enjoyed this.

This is a good recipe. I changed it up a little by marinating the chicken in barbeque sauce and italian dressing which turned out with a lot more flavor that worchester sauce.

I made slight changes...as others suggested I cooked the mushrooms right after the bacon in the same skillet, I also put the mushrooms on the chicken under the cheese with the bacon. I nixed the honey mustard I don't think it needs it, quite tasty without it. Had to broil it for longer than 5 minutes on each side. Could be my broiler or my chicken pieces were too thick but it did take much longer than I expected. Overall it satisfied my party of four and I may make it again.

Great dish! I trimmed the fat and calories in half by using olive oil instead of butter, bacon bits instead of bacon strips and Newman's Own Low Cal Honey Mustard dressing. It still tasted wonderful and my husband was even a fan!

Meh, this recipe was alright. Followed it to the letter, but the chicken was very dry and tasteless. Thinking I'll try it again, but I'll cook it at a lower temperature for a little longer to keep it from drying out so much (apparently I can't "broil" very successfully) and try a different marinade.

Yummy!! Takes just like Outback's!! Chicken was very moist. We served with french fries, brocolli, bread, and even made honey butter like Outback's! Very easy to prepare too.

This was a great dish, very easy, and VERY tasty! I didn't want to buy a whole bottle of honey mustard dressing(we don't eat it often enough) so I just mixed about 1/4 cup dijon with about 2 tablespoons of honey. It was great!

Absolutely delicious. I made about 4 breasts worth in a single glass pan. Took a little longer to cook (about 10 min and 12 min) but still turned out succulent and moist on the inside. Made own honey mustard with spicy dijon, honey, and mayo, a great add on, although I left it on the side.

This was very good. Here's how I did it: I did not marinate the chicken, just fried it up in some olive oil. When it was done, I topped it with the cheese, bacon (I used bacon pieces), mushrooms and dressing. Very good. Will definitely make again.

I really love this chicken recipe.  I have had it in my favorites since Dec.'01. and have make it many times.  I can never follow a recipe exactly so we have had a few variations.  I make my own honey mustard sauce.  I buy  honey mustard add a little more honey and a small amount of mayo. But this recipe does not need much monkeying around.  I do bake this instead of broiling. Have served over and over again.

just about the tastiest dish! My guy also favors spicy so I heap his chicken with sauteed mushrooms and fresh slices of jalapenos then a sprinkle of shredded taco cheese and covered with a paper thin slice of habanero jack cheese.

This was delicious!  My boyfriend loved it, too.  I didn't use quite as many mushrooms as the recipe called for.  I also used 2% milk cheese, and Ken's lite Honey Mustard dressing.  I also broiled for about 10 minutes on each side.  I have never broiled before (only baked), but they were delicious cooked that way!

Excellent recipe!  I omitted the mushrooms, substituted turkey bacon and broiled on low for 10 mins each side to accomodate my boyfriend's particular tastes.  He LOVED it and after finishing everything on his plate, asked if there was more!

Can we give this 100 stars?! Made this in the crock pot as someone suggested and this came out wonderful. Used bacon pieces (always have a reserve of bacon grease). Used alot of cheese mix and also added chopped green onions! My family LOVED this- said it was my best dinner EVER!

This was really good, tasted like the restaurant dish to me. I grilled the chicken on a grill pan then broiled it to melt the cheese. I used turkey bacon and baby portabello mushrooms. Also made my own honey mustard by mixing dijon mustard and honey.

The best one! I made it now and then. My husband always ordered it @ Outback. Now we said good bye to Outback and made it at home to cut down SALT. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. It makes us feel like we're @ Outback again. :)

I did a combo of this recipe and the Aussie chicken recipe because I didn't have any honey mustard on hand. Instead of broiling, I baked at 375 for 20 min and then added the bacon and cheese. Everyone loved it - thanks!

This is absolutely wonderful! I'm always looking for something to add into my meal planning & this one was a winner. Easy to make and find ingredients a plus too! I broil the chicken a bit longer & them leave off the mshm. when plating for the kids - great family recipe!

Not bad.  Baked the chicken 350 for 20 minutes first then put on the extras.  Also used Ken's Honey Mustard Dressing.

This was great.  My husband loves alice  chicken as it is all he orders there and he said this was very close.  Next time I will add liquid smoke to the marinade as he thinks all that was missing was the grill taste.  Thanks so much for making him a happy hubby :-)

Delicious!  This is a favorite and pretty easy, but not an "any night" kind of dish (at least for me).  It's great for company, (especially if you know someone likes bacon like my husband and many men like him), but your house can really end up smelling like the broiler/bacon/chicken.  That's why I rate this a special night meal - and be prepared for the "after-smell."  I haven't tried baking it, so maybe that would help some.

One of our new favorites. We don't pour the honey mustard over the chicken though. I just allow each person to have their own dipping bowl with the dressing in it to accommodate to each one's perference. Also have made it without the mushrooms and it's just as good.

I liked this, but the Worcestershire sauce was a bit overwhelming for me. I didn't add the honey mustard sauce due to diet constraints, so that may have balanced the flavor.

Tastes just like the OUtback version. For the honey mustard saud I combined 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup of light corn syrup, 1/4 cup mayo and 1/2 of Dijon mustard. Served with herb roasted potato's (found in freezer section). It was awesome!

This recipe is a keeper. I used the wrong honey mustard though; I think I grabbed the honey dijon-too strong! I baked instead of broiled, as I have a strong aversion to broiling (traumatic past experience) and it came out just great. I put the not-so-crispy (whoops!) bacon on the chicken for about 10 minutes after the chicken was about baked through, which crisped up the bacon a bit, and after the bacon was crispier I added the mushrooms and cheese and let that melt up. Mmm!

This will impress your guests.  It ends up to be quite a heavy dish, so go light on what else is on the plate!  Strongly recommend marinating for a few hours, as the flavour really comes through.  Lastly, a quality honey mustard sauce has a huge impact as the final topping.

This was a very nice change to your ordinary chicken breast recipe. I actually forgot the honey mustard salad dressing & since my monterey jack cheese had seen its days & went into the trash, I used 1/2 sharp cheddar & 1/2 mozarrella cheese instead. It still came out good. Also I marinaded the chicken breasts in the worchestshire sauce for about 2 hours. Thanks for sharing!

I marinated for about 5 hours. I cooked the bacon in the microwave like i always do and cooked the chicken on my foreman grill. I served the honey mustard dressing separately and my husband thought it wasn't even necessary. My picky son gave it 5 stars and so did my husband.

I am so glad I found this version of the 'Australian' chicken.  I like it much better and don't thinks its so heavy.  I adjusted the seasoning a little for my chicken - cajun spice, garlic, onion powder and a smidge of soy sauce.  Don't really care for the sweet honey-mustard sauce so skipped that.  Will make this often!

I was a bit disappointed the first time I made this because it just was kind of bland.  I made it again seasoning the chicken to my liking, garlic, Greek seasoning, and added thinly sliced onions.  I like it better.

This is a very delicious quick and easy recipe!  I didn't have any worshishire sauce on hand, so I just completely left it out and it was still very very good! Only thing about this recipe is that the cheese makes it a little greasy, but it was a lot of flavor!  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is awesome!!!!  I used breast also and they were a little thick so I had to cook them a little longer than the recipe called for.  My family does not like mushrooms so we left those out and I put the bottle of honey mustard on the table and those who wanted it added it themselves.  With or without the dressing it was great and so easy to make.  We will definately be having this again. =)

I loved this recipe!  I've made it 3 times already and my boyfriend is kinda sick of it but i don't care because it's so good. i was kinda worried about the honey-mustard but it works really well with the other flavors, gives it a bit of an extra tangy kick. yum!

Great chicken!  For a super quick meal, I used chicken wings and drumsticks, which I just lightly coated with the sauce and seared them on the pan.  Then I topped it off with the cheese and some chopped green onions for color, which I broiled.  Turned out excellent even w/o the bacon and mushroom.  Served these with spinach linguine with homemade honeymustard sauce, everyone loved it!

It did not have as much flavor that I was anticipating.  Perhaps it was the honey mustard I used.

My husband is a finicky eater, honey-mustard...NO WAY!!  Guess what, he absolutely loved this and so did the kids, it is a new favorite in our house!  My daughter Alicen thinks it is great that it is called Alice chicken too.  Thanx for such a great recipe.

Few ingredients, but an interesting mixture.  Very pleasant to eat from beginning to end.  Not that tough (to make) either.

My husband and I are in love with this recipe.  I was out of chicken, so I used steak instead.  I don't usually eat steak, but it was so tender and flavorful.  I ate the entire thing!

This was great! I'm a big chicken lover, and this was such a easy and yummy recipe that I didn't even have to change to fit my taste. (except I did skip out on the honey mustard - but that's only the topping). I was so eager to eat this that I almost forgot about the topping of mushroom. This is wonderful with or without the toppings (mushroom/honey mustard)! The bacon gives that extra crunch, and the monterey jack cheese gives it that wonderful flavor!

This was a big hit with my boyfriend and....it was easy!  The flavors really complement each other very well.  It has been added to the "keep" pile!  Just cooked this again.  As a note, I saute the chicken in the worchetshire sauce using a large skillet.  I skip the broiling.  Gives great flavor.

One of my wife's favorites when we go "back out" to that well known steak restaurant is their "Alive Springs" chicken.  She thought this recipes was absolutely wonderful!

I altered this recipe a bit by grilling the chicken breasts instead of broiling.  Then I put the dressing and all other ingredients on top and broil just long enough to melt the cheese.  It was wonderful!  I've already passed this one along to some friends.

My family loved this recipe (after they picked out the mushrooms! hehe).  I had to broil my chicken an extra 5 minutes to get it cooked enough.  Very easy and very yummy...we'll be having this one again!

There are very few words that can accurately describe this, although "delicious," "fantastic," and "amazing" all are correct.  This wasn't excessively difficult, nor were the instructions hard to follow.  It takes a little bit of time, but it is definitely worth it.  My entire family loved this - it's at the top of our favorites list.

Yummy! I will definately make this one again. I simplified it a little by searing the chicken in and oven safe fry pan and threw the mushrooms in on top(instead of sauting)and baked at 425 degrees for 10 minutes or so. I think this method keeps the chicken more moist.

I’ve tried a LOT of recipes from this app, and this is the first time I’ve ever posted a review, because it was just that good! Even my picky husband was very impressed. I also loved the fact that the chicken was so simple and cooked so quickly in the broiler. I was pretty skeptical but it came out GREAT! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was I only drained part of the bacon grease, and added just a little butter to cook the mushrooms in. I also added a little garlic and minced onion to the mushrooms while they sautéed. Soooo good!

Most import part of this recipe is to get Kens brand honey mustard dressing. I sautéed the mushrooms in a little bit of bacon grease and butter along with some Montreal steak seasoning and salt. Baked at 350° for 40 min added mushrooms bacon and cheese and then broiled until cheese was melted. We added honey mustard dressing at the table as some wanted a lot and others just a little. I will be making this again for sure!!

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have found in a long time...and I don’t even like mustard and mushrooms... really!  I made this for a change of pace thinking that my husband would like it, but I think I was more impressed than him.  A must try, followed all the directions exactly.  No reason to change anything!

Made homemade honey mustard dressing which made it 5-stars. Super fattening, but so good.

I made this last night and was not disappointed. The chicken was juicy and the flavors were wonderful. I did add extra Purely Cajun seasoning to the chicken before broiling. I also added Purely Cajun Seasoning to the mushrooms while sautéing them.  Everyone loved it and I will be making it again !!!!

I made this recipe exactly as directed, using the Honey Mustard 11 recipe from this site.  It was wonderful!  The Hubby ate so much of it that he was unable to eat his breakfast this morning.  and he never overeats!!

I used MUCH less honey mustard & actually mixed the leftover worstershire (sp) with the honey mustard. It made something much more savory than sweet.

Don't throw out the marinade. Reduce it in a saucepan. Once it simmers add 2 tablespoons of honey mustard. Let it thicken then set aside. Pour it over instead of honey mustard dressing. Otherwise its a fantastic recipe! My guys loved it!

Sautéed the mushrooms in the bacon drippings. Layered mushrooms, bacon, honey mustard, and cheese in that order before putting in the oven.

I have been trying to replicate Outback's Alice Spring Chicken for some time.  My wife said this is the closest I have come; it just needed a little more honey mustard sauce.

I make mine  almost exactly as the recipe is stated just reverse some of the ingredients.  I just put the bacon on top of everything else, just our taste.  I add onions to my daughters portion because she loves 'em.  Anyway you can't go wrong with this one!

No mushroom fans in the house but made it as written less mushrooms.  A big hit.  If your a mushroom fan I bet you would rate this a 10.

We absolutely loved this dish. My kids don't usually like chickent, but they were asking for more of this.  I broiled on low and turned it from time to time. I used chicken cut up because I didn't have breast.

This was really good, even though I had to substitute the cheese for another and forgot the mushrooms! I cooked them but forgot to put them on. It was a busy day... Anyway It was a wonderful dish and the grandkids, 4 and 6 loved it and had seconds! 
I will definitely be making this again with all the right ingredients and it will sure hit the 5+ rating. 
One thing I will say, I did not buy the dressing I made it from a receipe on Allreciepes and it was wonderful.

Was very good and interesting.
Didn't have bacon so did without but was still great. I did as other reviewers and marinated longer than the recipe said. (I did it for about 3 hours)

I made this the other night for a dinner party and it was terrific.  Since I needed more breasts than fit in one skillet,  I baked  them at 400 degrees for 25 min.  [they were about 8oz each]  I baked the bacon and sautéed the mushrooms in the bacon fat before my guests arrived.   Switched the oven to broil, topped with bacon and cheese and broiled to melt the cheese.  I used Tuma cheese [suggested at the cheese shop]  and it melted perfectly.  I reheated the mushrooms, arranged  chicken on platter, topped with mushrooms and 
served a beautiful delicious entrée.  Will make this again for sure.

This is wonderful! I made the honey mustard sauce instead of using pre-made.  I cut the ingredients down for 2 breasts. I didn't have Monterrey Cheese so I used freshly grated medium Cheddar. I also poured the dressing on the chicken while cooking. My husband loves this recipe!

Made this easy recipe and it was awesome! Tastes very close to the original Alice Springs Chicken that they serve at the Outback Steakhouse that we used to frequently visit when living in the Grand Cayman Islands.  It does need more than 5 min per side as my chicken breasts were thick so needed a bit more time per side on broil.

Was very delicious! I did change a few things. I added onions, a little Worcester sauce and about four large gulps of beer to the sauté stuff. Used real bacon bits on the broiled chicken as well. Everything else was as on the recipe. Best meal in a long time!

Very delicious. The only thing id suggest on this recipe is to butterfly the chicken breasts you use. I also sprinkled black pepper, and garlic salt on the chicken. They were sooooo good.

Simple yet Delicious. I was a little nervous about the honey mustard sauce, but it really added a nice contrast to the Worcestershire. Plus my boyfriend loved it.

This was really simple and delicious. I had to use about 2 oz of soy sauce instead of Worcestershire. The grocery store was out! Other than that I followed the other ingredients exactly. Very flavorful and moist. We will be making this again.

This is surprisingly delicious, for how simple it is to make.  The flavors meld into a dreamy taste and rich too!   Normally I spend a lot of time/money/effort when cooking for a party and end up stressed.  This time, I made a simple spinach salad, Alice Chicken, brown rice, and watermelon.  I even used a bottled honey mustard dressing - Marie's.  It all took maybe 1 1/2 hrs total, except that I started the marinating early in the day.  It was gone fast!  Thanks for the post.

Awesome!  Entire family of 5 gobbled it up.  Rate it 9.5 out of 10.  Next time we'll try w/ a diff type of cheese & buy a good honey mustard dressing and see if it becomes a 10.

I loved the idea but had to sub just a little.  I  broiled the chicken cutlets and then added the bacon (cut up), sauteed mushrooms and poured alfredo sauce over all, broil another 5 minutes and serve. will def try the honey mustard next!

This was AMAZING! I baked the marinated breasts at 350 for 20 mins (1/2" thick only), then crumbled 1 piece of bacon on top, then the sauteed musrooms (sliced baby portabella's sauteed in the bacon grease), then colby jack cheese. Then I put under the broiler for a few mins. Served with honey mustard sauce (1 1/2c mayo, 1/4 c dijon mustard, 1/2 c honey, this makes a lot) and a side of Broccoli salad. The family devoured it!

Very good.  Based on other reviews we marinated the chicken in Italian salad dressing & baked it.  Tip: Make extra sauce for an easy side for another meal.  We froze a little dish of the sauce & used it later to pour over steamed cauliflower & broccoli.  Yum.

I thought it was good, my husband didnt like it. Didnt have breast so I used boneless skinless thighs. I did it a little different, I marinated in the Worcestershire, 1/2 c of honey mustard and 2 tbls of garlic powder. I added about 1/2 c of onions along with the mushrooms. I baked instead of grilled. I served with a remoulade sauce instead of honey mustard as not a big fan of honey mustard.

My wife loved it!  I made this one night on a whim and my wife went crazy for it and wants me to make it for her birthday dinner. This is the only way she will eat chicken.  I cook the chicken on the George Forman Grill as well.

Mmmm!!!  I made this as written, except I cooked the chicken in my grill pan on each side for about 5 minutes.  I then put it in a casserole dish, topped it (bacon, then mushrooms, then cheese) and baked in the oven at 350 for about 20-25 minutes.  (my broiler is on the fritz, or else I would have used it!)  I made the Honey Mustard Dressing II from this site to go with this- it is amazing!  I did marinate the chicken for about 4 hours...longer may have been even better.  The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is the chicken itself is a little bland.  It needs something to take it over the top.  Next time, I will try it with seasoned salt...or just a pinch of salt and pepper would probably do the trick.  Amazing dinner, really something special!

I was reading another recipe for chicken and I found a lot of reviewers mentioning this "Alice Chicken" so I decided to read this recipe and I stick with it, and OMG! my husband said that this is the best chicken he ever had.  He is the worst person to please, he is a very picky eater, he is a French chef! and he was very please. Thank you!

This was really yummy! I used chicken tenders, and drained a jar of mushrooms since that's what I had on hand.  I also had Muenster & PepperJack cheese and skipped the dressing altogether. Hubby loved it & asked that I add it to our dinner rotation.  I served it with sauted greens.

I added minced garlic to the Worcestershire sauce. We used Veggie Cheese in American and Pepper Jack. Omitted the Mushrooms.
My son dislikes mustard so we also omitted the dressing. Since we didn't use any dressing it was a little dry and needed a sauce. Next time I might use garlic flavored mayo or A1.

Really awesome recipe!  I enjoyed it.  I didn't have any honey mustard dressing & it still turned out great.  I added onions to my mushrooms.

AMAZING!!!  I would put "some" cheese on first to hold the bacon, mushrooms on better, then top with more cheese. Our topping slid off easily. Chicken was so tender. We used Kens Honey Mustard. Its nice & sweet!!  Great recipe!!!

The wonderful thing about this recipe is it actually *does* taste exactly like the Outback entree. The simple marinade for the chicken is what makes it so good. Fabulous recipe.

WOW! better than outback steakhouse! The only bacon I had was maple bacon, that threw the taste off a bit so next time ill use regular bacon. I saute onion and mushrooms together b/c to us they go hand in hand.I also diced tomato on top.That gave it just the perfect edge. served it with broccoli and corn. I felt like i had made a restaurant meal! a repeat for sure!

A definite keeper !!  Used Mississippi Honey Mustard Mayo instead of dressing and it was outstanding. We've made it for some friends already and they also loved it.

Love this chicken! All I had was reg. cheddar cheese, so that's what I used but it was delicious :) I sauteed the mushrooms (also added onions) in the same pan as the bacon (after dumping grease) and it was a great flavor meld. I have never broiled chicken before, so I was nervous.  It really did not seem like it was cooking!!! But it definitely did(followed the 8-9 min. recommendation)--and so tender and moist. Quick, easy, supa tasty!

This recipe was easy and delicious!! It did remind me of the Alice Chicken from Outback. I made my own honey mustard dressing and also grilled the chicken breasts rather than broiled them. It turned out wonderful! Thanks for the recipe! I have made this numerous times and my husband loves it!!

So good, I let the chicken sit overnight in the marinade and I think it added a lot of flavor. I would suggest adding some pepper to the chicken when cooking it (no salt is needed).

I used to always get this at Outback.  This was easy to make, and very good! I cut back on the fat by leaving out the bacon, and I used reduced fat cheese.  This makes it much healthier, yet it's still delicious!  The chicken came out very tender and juicy, partly because I marinated it overnight.

very good, but very greasy!  I didn't marinate the chicken because I didn't want to overpower any of the other ingredients...just like Outback's chicken which is the only thing I order when I go there...and so much cheaper!  you can feed the entire family for the same price as one person at the restaurant!  would def. make again!

This is fantastic!  I don't care for using the broiler due to the smell in the house, so I grilled the chicken outside then brought it in, put it in a baking dish with the bacon, mushrooms and cheese and placed it in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese.  Like others, we just used the honey mustard as a dipping sauce.  It was just like the Outback.  Will definitely make this again!

Really good and really easy.  I had thick chicken breasts (and a new oven) and 5 minutes each side was perfect.  Only marinated for about 45 minutes and the flavor was there but not too strong.  Chicken came out very moist.  Served with a spinach salad.

Made this recipe last year for my mom for mother's day, and it has become a family staple now. We love chicken, and this is a great dish full of flavor. My mom has even shared this recipe with all of her co-workers after she first started raving about it. We omit the mushrooms, but only because I don't like them.  ust typing this makes me want to cook a batch up right now.

We made this chicken last night for a few friends.  It was a huge hit!  The marinade (we went about 4 hours) is amazing- the chicken was juicy and so flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.  We didn't use the honey mustard, and the chicken was just as tasty.  My husband just ate the last serving for breakfast!  This is definitely a make again-dish, and it was my first sucessful broiling attempt!  However, it did take about 8 minutes per side under HI broiler.

Contrary to most reviews, I did not care for this dish. The flavors did not seem to meld at all.  Perhaps that's because everything's cooked separately? It wasn't the worst thing ever to come out of my kitchen -- I can say that for it. But, it wasn't worth dirting two pans and a baking sheet for, and I won't make it again. I only gave it three stars because my boyfriend thought it was okay. I would have given it two. Maybe there's a different way of preparation that would make it come together better. I don't know, but I'm not going to play around with it to find out. At least I'll know to avoid this one on the menu at that "popular steakhouse."

Great recipe!  My only problem is that I've never in my life been able to broil chicken breasts for 5 minutes on each side without killing someone.

Very tender and juicy. Tastes great. I too marinated my chicken longer for about 3 hours. Broiled for 8-10 min each side. Layered with cheese, bacon, mushrooms and more cheese garnished with parsley, broiled until the cheese melted. Came out great. However I thought the honey mustard dip masked the great taste of the chicken as is. Will definitely make this again.

Yummy!  We used the dressing at the end as a sauce to dip the chicken in instead of pouring it on the dish.  Hubby and the kids both thought this was a winner!

I love this dish at our favorite steak house, and now I can make a healthier version at home.  I use low-fat cheese, and turkey bacon and really load up on the mushrooms!

This is really good-the closest to Alice Springs Chicken at Outback you'll ever have!  Unfortunately, it's probably cheaper to eat there than to make it at home.

This dish tastes very much like the Alice Springs Chicken dish that you can order from the Outback. I felt like I was dining at the Outback....and it was so much more enjoyable because I had all the taste BUT NOT THE COST. Thanks for sharing!!!

We loved this! We didn't use a full 16 ounces of the honey-mustard salad dressing - more just poured a bit over to taste. Another reviewer suggested adding sundried tomatoes - I might try that next time.

This was very good.  I made it exactly as it was written, except I grilled the chicken because it was too hot to turn on the oven.  The whole family, children included, loved it.  I will definately make again.

This was very bland. Easy to make but needed something more. Won't make again. Remember to preheat your broil just as you would your oven. I made in my toaster oven.

With slight variations to save time and improve flavor, this was fabulous! After marinating all day with 1/2 cup each Italian dressing and w-shire sauce, I grilled the chicken. I sauteed a little minced onion with the mushrooms and used precooked bacon to save time. At serving time I just put the toppings out and let everyone make their own (wasn't sure if three teens would like honey mustard and mushrooms). Turns out they all loaded up on everything and loved it. Next time I'll top the chicken then broil it so the cheese will melt. This had the homemade taste that the restaurant doesn't! Thanks for sharing, it will be in the "Family Favorite" section of my cookbook.

This was excellent!  I broiled it for 8 minutes each side and it was so moist!  Even my 8 year old son said "this chicken is JUICY!"  I served the honey mustard on the side.  I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty!!!  I did not saute the mushrooms or use the honey mustard.  I was short on time but I know those two items would just make it taste even better.  This was very, very easy and good I will make again, and again.

The combination of the worcestershire sauce, bacon, and cheese was yummy. I marinated the chicken overnight because there wasn't enough flavor the first time when I did it for an hour.. I found it to be a LITTLE too strong, so I suggest putting it in the sauce in the morning. Skipped mushrooms and honey mustard and enjoyed it just the same. I will make it again

SOOOO GOOD!  I skipped the honey mustard, the chicken itself was too good to dip in anything.  The only thing I changed was I used sliced colby instead of the shredded.  I also served it with mushrooms AND onions, it was awesome!

My whole family thought this recipe was good but needed more seasoning.  Next time I would add some onion and garlic powder.  I would also use thinner chicken breasts.  I could only eat 1/2 of one and my husband who usually eats like a horse could only eat one.  I also made my own Honey Mustard dip just mixing honey and Dijon mustard.  I would definately make again.

Delicious!  Easy enough that my daughter made it when I was late getting home.  The only problem we had was that the chicken breasts were really thick and didn't cook through in the allotted time.  We used precooked bacon and it worked great.  Wonderful recipe!

Very good.  The only downfall was the dressing I used.  It was Wishbone honey mustard.  Very salty and very smokey.  I will make my own honey mustard dressing and try this one again.

This was pretty good.  Couldn't find the honeymustard dressing in the store so we used a recipe from here and made it.  We also made it on the grill.  We loved the mix of the flavors.  Though it wasn't as good the next day.
Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good.  I love the crunchy bacon on all of this together.  I did not think that you need the honey lemon dressing.  I had it on the side and did not like it, but it was wonderful besides that.

This was not a "bad" recipe.  I also would not classify it as great.  IF I make it again, I will substitue the worcestershire with italian dressing.  I would marinate all night with it too.  We all ate it though.  So with my family that IS a step ahead!

Really good and really easy.  I love that the side of mushrooms was included with this recipe, and it went great with the chicken.  The chicken came out a little bland, so the honey mustard did the trick!  I love this one!

Definitely a keeper! My son said "Mom, cook chicken like this all the time!" and I know my husband enjoyed it when he told me a couple of friends of his wanted the recipe -- he'd told them about the great dinner I'd made the night before. Easy to make and delicious.

Never having had the original, and tending to dislike most restaurant food in general, I didn't have very high hopes for this.  I was completely wrong.  It was fast, easy and really tasty.  Even considering all the butter, bacon and cheese used, it didn't sit as heavy as I expected it to.  Excellent recipe!

I use thicker style, boneless skinless chicken breasts which I sliced in half(length-wise). This reduced broiling time.  The honey mustard dressing is a must have.  I used Hellmann's Light, I find it to have the best flavor.  Wonderful recipe!

I've made this twice now.  My kids are picky & they love it.  I've never used the honey mustard dressing though.  Also, my son doesn't like mushrooms, so I just leave them off his piece of chicken.  You could do the same with the bacon or cheese depending on your preference.

This was absolutely delicious!! I made it for friends who loved it and asked for the recipe. The only thing I did differently was to use very thin sliced mozarella cheese instead of grated. Also, for a second-time-around variation I used lean, thin-sliced ham instead of bacon and the mushrooms may be sauteed in canola oil for those who desire to lower the fat content a bit. I found using a double-sided electric countertop grill for cooking the chicken(by itself)then assembling the toppings and microwaving for a minute to melt the cheese keeps the chicken soooo juicy!!I will definitely be making this again and again...thanks Alice!

Kids didn't eat it, but who cares!  I have made it several times and the key is to let the chicken marinate in the sauce.  Tried cheating once, letting it sit for only 1/2 hour and could really tell the difference.  Enjoy!

A sophisticated and tantalizing taste.  I used turkey bacon and made my own simple honey mustard dressing (1/3 dijon, 1/3 honey, 1/3 olive oil).  High yum factor!

The recipe calls for way too much worcestershire sauce, too salty.  Next time I'll use my usual marinade, but still use the bacon and cheese.  Also, it should be broiled a shorter time and allowed to finish cooking after bacon and cheese are added so it isn't so dry.

I thought this was very good.  Husband enjoyed it very much as well.  But by the reviews that I read, I was expecting something unbelievably wonderful.  This was very good, but not as great as everyone was raving about, but still very tasty, no doubt.  I may possibly make it again.  I only needed half the honey mustard dressing that the recipe called for.  Also, you must broil this longer than recipe states.  Chicken was still pink inside, we had to cook it for additional 10 minutes.

This recipe is great!  My husband only gave it 3 1/2 stars, but I wholeheartly give it 5 stars.  I'd definitely serve this to my guests.  I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I used parmesan instead and it turns out great.  I also omitted the dijon dressing and it was just as good.  Thanks!

I honestly cannot cook and it's been a long time since I've found a recipe that actually tastes good after I've cooked it.  This recipe lived up to it's name.  I thought I was at Outback Steakhouse...now all I need is the recipe for their Cinnamon Oblivion dessert!  Anyone?  Misty thanks so much...please let me know if you have anymore that are this easy and delicious.

I made this for me and my husband, and we both loved it.  It was so easy, and I already had all of the ingredients.  As for the mess everyone is complaining about, just put aluminum foil down on the broiler pan.  Then there is no mess.

I made this recipe for my guests and they went back for seconds. I served it with a baked potatoe and Ceaser salad. Note: I wouldn't marinade the chicken longer than an hour or it might be over powering.

My boyfriend and I loved this and to think I've been accused of not being able to boil water!  I had the honey mustard on the side since I don't like it but my boyfriend does but he said he didn't need/want it; it was delicious the way it was.  I served it with sauteed mushrooms and egg noodles.  I will definitely be making this again and plan on experimenting with different cheeses.  Thanks for making me appear to know what I'm doing in the kitchen.

This was delicious.  I only used about 1/3 of the bottle to marinate (it covered the chicken in the container I used), and I also used less cheese on top.  My 3 year old liked the chicken, but didn't want anything on top.  I think the prep time estimate is low if, like me, you fry rather than microwave your bacon.

I thought the recipe was really good.  I made it twice.  The first time I used the honey mustard salad dressing.  Neither my husband or myself liked the dressing as a topping.  I switched to a honey mustard sauce rather than dressing and it was much better.

This was referred to me by a friend, I actually went to the supermarket to pick up the ingredients...easy to prepare (ooh) and definitely very easy to cook. I cooked for three ppl including myself, we were in heaven. The mushrooms (oo-uh) Suuuperlicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It gave me a simple and quick way to make the usual chicken breast dinner a little more interesting.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  Something I think I will make again!

We all loved this recipe...I sauted onions with the mushrooms.  I was hesitant about the honey mustard dressing and that was the clincher for this recipe!  It rocked!

This recipe was great, I too used turkey bacon, low fat honey mustard and reduced fat cheese. It was so easy and so tasty!

This recipe is incredible and so easy to make!  My boyfriend loved it!  And I didn't need to buy obscure ingredients that I'd never use again, as the recipe calls for simple 'around the house' ingredients.

Alice Chicken tasted like it came straight from "Outback's" kitchen.  This entree was excellent.  Marinade left chicken tender and juicy.  I give it an A+.  Quick enough for someone on the go, yet tasty enough to sit down and eat.
