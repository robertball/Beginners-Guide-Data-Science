This turned out delicious.  Instead of the grill you can put them in a 350 F oven for roughly half an hour, or until they are to the desired softness.  Top with the berry sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it comes out perfect! This was a great dessert after the roast sticky chicken.

I loved this recipe! I used a mix of raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries with a little lemon zest. Yummy!

This was awesome. I was following the directions exactly but did forget to dot them with butter. This did not seem to hurt a bit so I will leave it out from now on. I served the peaches topped with ice cream and then the sauce. They presented beautifully! Thanks!

Fabulous dessert that you don't have to feel guilty about! It's the perfect ending to any BBQ meal! I did this a little differently - I cut the peaches in half and lightly sprayed with a little butter spray then splashed with a little vanilla extract, turbinado sugar and cinnamon.  I let the peaches set for a couple of hours then grilled directly on the grill vs. in a foil packet.  I also did a strawberry sauce vs. raspberry using fresh strawberries vs. frozen. No matter which berry you choose this is bound to be delicious - top with a little whipped cream and you have a wonderful dessert without a lot of effort.

I made this for a recipe club gathering with a BBQ theme and it was delicious.  The peaches came out so tender and looking delicious - everyone was very impressed and it was one of the only dishes that was completely gone by the end of the night - no leftovers!  I will definitely be hanging on to this recipe.  Also, another girl brought homemade vanilla ice cream that was a great complement to this recipe as well.

I really liked this recipe.  I wanted the "grilled" look so I grilled the peaches first to make the grill lines then wrapped in foil with sugar and cinnamon and butter.  The sauce was a great finishing touch, and I just added a small dollop of whipped cream to finish it off.  Great summer recipe, thanks!

Never having grilled a non-meat item, I was a little apprehensive about this recipe.  It was super easy, and turned out perfect! I didn't let the peaches ripen up the first time I made this.  The second time I let the peaches ripen a little more and it made all the difference.

Tasted great.  Next time I think I'll add some oats to the filling mixture.  I used unsweeteded frozen raspberries and added enough simple syrup to get it to mix in the blender.  My peaches were small so the filling could have filled more than two peaches.

If you add a scoop of vanilla ice cream you have created PEACH MELBA dessert!!

Excellent dish.  Makes it on the grill almost every time it's fired up, during peach season.

Disappointed with the results of grilling the peaches and with the overall taste of the dessert.
