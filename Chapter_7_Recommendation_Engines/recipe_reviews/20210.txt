As a Brazilian myself, I prepare Caipirinha in a slightly different way: the ingredients are still the same (although you can substitute the cachaça for dark rum - it will then be called "Caipirissima"). You should crush the sliced lime (unpeeled, please!) and the sugar in a glass, mix in the cachaça (or rum) and a few ice cubes. As for the comments on using either limes or lemons, I can assure you that what is sold in the US as lime is exactly what Brazilians call "limão Tahiti". So, go with the lime!

Being a Brazilian myself, I must say that our original recipe for Caipirinha takes lemon (Tahiti lemon), not lime.
One more hint: I know this could be hard for you to find in the USA, but try using the artesanal Cachaça, not the industrial one. If you have more than a few drinks, the industrial Cachaça (Velho Barreiro, Ypioca, 51) will probably give you a headache and a hangover the next day. A good quality Cachaça (artesanal), won't! Cheers from Brazil!!!

as a Scotsman who has been to Brasil on many occasions- here is my take - 1. Yes limes only please. 2. Cane sugar only, unrefined if possible. 3. Im sure its great with pineapple and many other things but then it aint a Caiparinha. 4. No matter how good the cachaca, or how well you follow the recipe or how good the company is - it'll never ever ever  taste the same as it does in a bar anywhere in Brasil with the samba music blaring and the beautiful multicultural crazy clientel all around you - so do yourself a favour and go visit the most beautiful, hospitable and downright loco country in the world! and Yes Scotland runs a very close second- we just don't get the weather :)

Very simple and straightforward recipe! Only problem is that some brazilians always insisted in mix up the things and translate "limão" as "lemon", what is completely wrong: "Limão"(the green fruit) is lime, and "lima" (the yellow one) is lemon, in portuguese. I believe that thousands of poor american citizens were instructed the wrong way on caipirinha recipe. Blame on brazilians bad english knowledge (I`m one of them - but I do not confuse "vital" things like that...). One more thing: caipirinha is made of lime, sugar and cachaça on the rocks. Everything else is not caipirinha. Period!

Nothing beats this on a hot day! I was in Rio for 10 days last year and had caipirinhas at a dozen different locations. Never saw a lemon. They were ALWAYS made with lime.

Being Brazilian I do assure you that Caipirinha is just great! I agree with the other reviewer who said that one should use lemmon instead of lime. Also, it would be better to use cachaça but there is a variation of this drink with vodka( it's called caipivodka) that is also quite nice. If you want to do something diferent you can use other fruits as well ( here it is quite common to use it also done with passion fruit). Cheers!

Way too little sugar in this recipe. I use a rounded tablespoon. You want enough sugar to saturate the mix. There should be a little granulated sugar at the bottom of the glass once it is all stirred together. Sugar should be ground into the lime. I use a mortar & pestle. You want to bruise the peel of the lime to bring out the zest.
I pour the lime and sugar into a glass with crushed ice, rinse the mortar with cachaca, and stir it into the glass. Wow! Best ingredients? As one reviewer says, good cachaca. Brazilian limes, way better than those I get in the States. And, O Samba.

As a Brazilian I've made many caipirinhas professionally.  You definitely want to go with a Handcrafted/Artesnal Cachaca.  I always use Cachaca São Paulo.  No hangover and excellent quality with a competitive price.  The half lime should be cut into cubes muddled with the sugar,  add ice then the Cachaca.   The secret is in the shake.  If your caipirinha looks like a carbonated drink you have made an excellent one.   Enjoy.

This is my favorite drink too, but I made a little different: I doubled the amount of lime and sugar, mash them together in a glass and it's very important to peel the limes otherwise it will taste too strong. Then add the ice and I used vodka instead of cachaca, just a preference.

In case anyone is interested or diabetic this can be made with Splenda as well.  Not an issue to toy with the amount of Lime or sweetener to taste This is a very good basic recipe.  Have also heard of substituting Vodka and calling it a Caipirosky.

I had one at a Brazilian restaurant and loved it, so of course had to make it at home.  The cachaca is very strong so I need to work on this recipe a bit yet.

Use good quality cachaca. There is no real mix to speak of, so use lots of ice and sip as the ice melts. Fabulous on a hot day. I found the amounts of sugar to lime were just right: not too sweet, not too tart.

Super basic and all you need for a perfect cocktail. 
**Limes are essential; lemons aren’t ever used!  Lemons are not readily avail in Brazil (&South  America)  
Peel and all are thrown into a glass and broken down quickly with ice using a pestal.

Whoa baby! I made these for ladies' weekend at the cabin to have with pulled pork. I put them in shot glasses to start and am so glad I did! These taste a lot like lemoncello, but more tart not so sweet. I will make again and want to mix in club soda for a refreshing summer beverage without ALL the kick!
