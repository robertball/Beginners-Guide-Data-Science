it's like drinking grainy yoghurt or something. Maybe it could have potential as a soup.

This is too thick to drink!  It is more like unsweetened pudding!  Once you get used to it, the taste isn't too bad.  I tried to add a spice to make it more appealing, but wasn't satisfied.  The lighting in my kitchen makes this look green, but it really is more of a grayish brown color.
