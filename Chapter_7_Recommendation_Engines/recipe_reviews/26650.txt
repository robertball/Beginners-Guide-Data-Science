BBQ sauce??!! Methinks you either boiled  the meat to death or it was not that flavorful to begin with. Did you use chuck? If you didn't that may explain the lack of flavor. The ingredients are fine the way they are and make sure you don't overwhelm the meat with too much water. Please don't add BBQ sauce or it is no longer machaca it is shredded BBQ meat that belongs on a hamburger bun not in a burrito.

The beef turned out exceptionally good...I boiled mine in the oven.  Meat could have been more flavourful...may want to add some bbq sauce to the mixture for flavour
