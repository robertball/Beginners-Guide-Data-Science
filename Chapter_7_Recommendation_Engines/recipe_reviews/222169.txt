Excellent! This is a bit time consuming and a little pricey but well worth it. The only change I made was in the olives and that was an accident. I grabbed a can of chopped instead of sliced. Same flavor just not as appealing to the eyes. Don't skip the jimaca... it is a real treat in this. I also think all cilantro instead of part parsley would be better. Whichever way you choose, this is excellent!
