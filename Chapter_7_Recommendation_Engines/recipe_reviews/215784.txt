I can't say this very often about my cooking but it was Amazing! Even my boyfriend loved it and he's a little leary of my cooking:) I will definately make it again. I didn't have any marinade so I melted butter and mixed it with a garlic and herb spice mix that I had already. Then I poured some into the holes that I stabbed into the meat. Also, when there's only about a 30 or 40 minutes of cooking time left (w/ a 1.5 lb roast)I start to slice the meat almost all the way through as if I were serving it. It was sitting in 1.5 inches of liquid, including the veggies so I spooned some of that on top after I sliced it. I think slicing the meat helped it cook a littler faster because pork always seems to take forever to cook for some reason.Easy and hopefully healthy but not sure how healthy my home made marinade was. I didn't even use the suggested gravy either, it was already moist and tasty enough.

Excellent recipe, but if your serving a group that do not prefer spicy dishes, ya might think about leaving out the red pepper flakes!!!

A couple precautions .... (1) make sure the pan in which you cook the shallots will hold the roast  :)  and (2) while I consider myself a more than competent cook, this took considerably more than 30 of prep time.  Other than that, my cajun family loved it.

EXCELLENT!! Didn't make it exactly, left out the red pepper flakes and didn't use the injectable marinade, but it was very tender and the veggies soaked up all the juice and were very peppery, flavorful and well-cooked. I would definitely recommend this recipe. It only took me 15 minutes to prep, cooked for 3 1/4 hours (I had a 2.5 lb roast) and it was just fabulous! 5 stars!

I did change a few things, due to not having an injector.  I took a tip from a previous reviewer.  I melted butter and whisked in creole seasoning.  Then I slit holes in the roast and spooned the butter/creole mixture into the slits.  I used a cast iron skillet to brown the roast, threw the veggies in the cast iron skillet, covered it with foil and roasted in the oven.  This was the most tendor and flavorful pork shoulder roast I have ever made.

It's really not fair for me rate this recipe as I had to make several changes due what I had on hand. I am giving 5 stars because by following the technique and overall spice/herb structure I ended up with the best "Grandma food" I've ever had and I am rarely satisfied with anything I make. I always want it too perfect. Thank you for the inspiration, I don't think I'll go back to beef pot roast again! I love heat and was very happy to experience a kick outside of my norm (mexican, thai, etc).

Fallin' apart, not so much. Flavor, not so much. I had high hopes for this one. Bf only ate a couple bites of his. I had to slather my meat in ketchup. Sorry, but i will not make this again.

First of all my husband LOVED this!!!!! He never loves anything usually his comments are this is pretty good etc. that means he likes it. His comment on this was Oh My God this is DELICIOUS!!! I really only did 2 things different, neither of them really changed the recipe. First I browned and cooked it in a dutch oven, 1 less pan to wash. And I didn't add the potatoes, I made mashed instead so we could cover them in the gravy. My husband is already asking for it again!

This was fabulous!  All 6 members of my family loved it, even the extremely picky 8 year old.  This will be a regular with us!

This is so tender and flavorful! I'm not sure what the other reviews did wrong but with all the spices and the creole injectable, this is amazing! The gravy is super yummy too!

Delicious!  Just be aware that this is very spice so if you are serving to someone with a distaste for hot just tone it down a bit.  This will definitely be a standard for pork roast in this house.

I made no changes to the recipe. Smelled wonderful but was too spicy for everyone but myself. Will try again with some adjustments. The pork was very tender and had a wonderful flavor.

Since my family doesn't like spicey creole flavors, I skipped the creole butter injection of the roast but I made no other changes at all to this recipe...it sounded perfect for our taste buds!
The aroma while roasting was superb so I  knew this was going to be a very well received delicious meal.
I paired it with cornbread and sauteed/stewed apples.
I will be making this fantastic recipe again and I highly recommend others to serve this yumminess!

I have made this twice now and both times my family and friends raved about it. It is delicious.  The only change I made was to cooking time.  In my dutch oven with both a 3 1/2 and 4 1/2  lb roast the cooking time was only 2 1/2 hours and the meat was perfectly done.

Great recipe that's easy to prepare, just takes a little while.  I found a Creole injection recipe that worked well and made the meat so very tender and juicy.  When I make it again, I may substitute the red pepper with chipotle for a sweeter, smokey flavor.
