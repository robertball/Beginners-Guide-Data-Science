We really liked these! I used less ground turkey and a whole packet of taco seasoning. I also ended up having to add a bit of water b/c it seemed dry to me. I didn't have any green peppers on hand, so I had to omit those. Served these with all the usual taco toppings. All in all, the family enjoyed this 'healthier' version of one of our favorite meals...Thanks for sharing. :)
