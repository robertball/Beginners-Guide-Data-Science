Really good recipe.  I made it in quantity for a charity.  One hint: for whatever reason, we are never told to wash rice first in the US.  Every culture that eats rice as a staple washes it first in cool water until the water runs clear.  It makes a huge difference in the finished product.

I made this using medium grain rice and it was absolutely perfect. Flavor is great. I omitted the celery and carrots since I didn't have any in the fridge and it was a perfect side to lemon chicken.

Tasty family pleaser. I prefer a little more spice, but husband and very picky rice hating daughter asked for seconds :) We had this as a lighter alternative to fried rice with chicken teriyaki skewers. Can easily be adapted to suit any taste (I always stay true to recipes as written the first time around)and has a much better chicken flavor than when boiled in broth.

I confess I was lazy and was looking for an easy side dish so I could cook all the dishes in the oven at once and forget about it.  I followed this recipe exactly, including using my homemade chicken broth which exceeds anything store bought.  This was perfect.  I did have to increase the oven time, but I have a slow oven.  It had the right amount of flavor without overpowering the main dish.  We loved it.

My guys really liked this super simple baked rice.  I liked the ease of the recipe.  You could add whatever vegetables your family enjoys to this dish.

This was okay.  I used a 2-quart casserole, leaving it covered the entire time, and the rice was a little dry for our taste. This is a nice basic dish; next time I'll use a smaller casserole and add a tiny bit more fluid and adjust the flavors a bit, depending on what else I am serving.  A nice way to use the oven for a side dish if you're already baking.

I appreciated that I was able to utilize the other half of the oven while I baked chicken but this was just "alright".  The only change I made, by necessity, was to use brown rice, because that's all I had in the pantry, but I don't think that white rice would have made this dish any better.  I found this bland.  Not awful--I might very well make it again to go with an exceptionally flavorful main course to avoid a clash--but it didn't stand out either.

Great flavour! I intended to make this as an oven baked rice, but my oven didnâ€™t work today so I made it in the stovetop instead, just covered and cooked until it was done, and it was fabulous! I will try it again in the oven once my oven is working again.

I bulked up the rice with extra veggies I had in the fridge...peppers, mushrooms, celery, onion and carrots. Perfect side with chicken and roasted cauliflower!!

This rice tasted amazing. I added red and green pepper and the dish was so colourful I just wanted to look at it . Serve with chicken wings and everyone loved it . Not a grain of rice left.

We really liked this, and thought it was way nicer than boring boiled rice.

Of course there were a few changes - I added some butter when frying the onion, garlic and carrot. No celery. I rinsed the rice thoroughly and added it to the frying pan to coat in all the butter/oil, and then added the two cups of stock. 

I covered it the whole time, and when I checked it at the halfway point it was drying out so I added an extra half a cup of stock, and some garlic powder and onion powder as it was a bit bland.

It came out really fluffy and tasty but did need a hit of salt - but I hadn't salted it as stock can be salty, so I waited till the end. A real lifesaver for me as I can't ever seem to cook rice on the stovetop with any measure of success.

I made this exactly as is and thought it was delicious. My oven was on anyway and this was really easy, the rice was perfectly cooked. Will defiantly make again.

Just tried this recipe and it turned out perfectly.  I was so proud of my work since I suck at cooking.  I used vegetable broth since it was the only thing i had handy.  I will make again and again!!!!

I ALWAYS have carrots on hand but on the particular day I made this I found my crisper void of carrots and it was already too late to run to the store. I managed to round up half of an orange bell and had to use it in place of carrot. Simple is right and this pairs nicely with most any meat. I served this with cornish hens I smoked in the smoker and then turned around and served it with ham from the smoker the very next day and it worked great with both. This will be my go to recipe when I am needing a side dish for my meat. Thanks for sharing Arizona Desert Flower!

I've been having the hardest time getting rice to turn out right at my apartment. I thought the oven-baked method would be fool-proof. I was wrong. After cooking 40min, 20 covered, 20 uncovered, almost none of the water absorbed! This oven cooks beef roast just right! And I did pre-heat it. The rice just took forever to cook, and then it turned out both mushy and crunchy just like it does when I cook it on the electric stovetop.

I halfed it for 2 people and skipped the celery. I used some preshredded carrots and it is worth making again.
