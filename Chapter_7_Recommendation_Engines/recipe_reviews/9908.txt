We loved these cookie/waffles! It's a cookie it's a waffle it's super waffles!! They didn't stick to my waffle iron either. I made them just for kicks and giggles to try something new. I will definitely be making these on a regular basis. Verrrrry tasty indeed.

This was a great recipe. I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and cinnimon to the batter. My kids loved it and so did I. I love the idea of baking without the oven and having to clean a ton of baking sheets!

My husband loved these I wasn't a fan. He loved the chocolate flavor. These would make a nice addition to a bowl of ice cream.
