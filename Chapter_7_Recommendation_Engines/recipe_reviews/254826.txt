These are really good. I made a big batch to freeze but ate a couple as soon as they were off the griddle. I used apples instead of berries, as mentioned in the notes. They stay moist when reheated, so these are definitely a keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

Love these for my 1.5 year old. I use whatever fruit I have on hand and freeze in batches. Itâ€™s perfect for a healthy, quick breakfast.

Very good. Made with a gluten free pancake mix and it turned out great.
