Maybe it was the fact I scaled this recipe down some, but the cookies really didn't stay together, very crumbly. They have a good taste because I like what's in them but my husband says they are too 'fibery'

The was a good recipe, the results was a very nicely balanced cookie that is a little chewy.  I got tired of chopping nuts and only used 1 cup of nut instead of 2 and the finish seemed right.  I tried a chocolate chip version of this recipe by cutting the white sugar in have and replacing it with brown sugar this turned out well too.

I am not a fan of coconut, but the macadamia was a good blend that made it flavorful. My family loved it.
