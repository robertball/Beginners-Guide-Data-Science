I sifted the powdered sugar first since I've previously used unsifted sugar and couldn't get the lumps out.  I needed less than the 1/4 cup of water to get the right consistance for my tube pan cake.  The icing has a shiny look and a fabulous taste.  This will be my new favorite chocolate frosting!
If you're making a layer cake I would double the recipe.

Great base recipe.  I just made a few changes after reading other reviews.  I used 3 squares of chocolate, then instead of adding all 2 cups of sugar at once, I added one cup, then slowly added the water.  Then I added more sugar until I got the taste I wanted, worked out to about 1 1/2 cups.  The full 2 cups would have been way to sweet for my liking.

I thought this frosting was just OK.  It was very easy to make which is a plus but it set very quickly and became very hard.  I guess I prefer a creamier frosting.  Maybe I should have added even more water.  I also thought the taste veered towards sugary sweet rather than chocolatey.  I would make it again in a pinch but wouldn't be my go to frosting.

Be careful.  I got it to the consistency I wanted which was not too runny but a little fluffy, and I was quick to put it on the cake but it was setting before I could finish icing the cake, which meant it stuck to the knife and my fingers and not the cake.

This is a fabulous, yummy frosting that works very well on cupcakes.  After I allowed the cupcakes to cool, I dipped them top-first right into the frosting.  Perfect!

I like this recipe a lot, it reminds me of the tub frosting you'd by at the grocery.  I like the fact it hardens quickly yet it's still creamy at the same time.  Thanks for sharing this, I'll use it often.

really tasty although I would recommend following the directions on the recipe.  I tried to make it using the microwave to melt everything but it turned out to be more difficult.  I added a bit of cocoa powder and cream of tartar to make it taste richer and to let it stiffen up a bit.  Overall a really delicious frosting!

This recipe is really easy and tastes great and became the perfect option for a chocolate cake I made with my boyfriend; he likes confectionersÂ´ sugar frosting that turns a bit hard and I, on the other hand, like a creamy and buttery kind of frosting. This has elements of both and works perfectly!

This was exactly what I was looking for: simple buttercream-style frosting that I can make without a lot of fussy ingredients.  But, beware that there's little to hide an off-taste chocolate or butter.  I only had sweetened chocolate, so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and I used milk instead water as I prefer the taste.  If your frosting starts to stiffen while spreading, beat in more liquid a little at a time until you achieve the desired consistency.

Terrible - the sugar completely dries up the chocolate mixture so that it is all nothing but powder and can't be blended no matter how much it is heated. I had to throw the whole batch out. Waste of ingredients.

I did make a few minor changes after looking at a few chocolate frosting recipes. In a saucepan over low heat I used 2 TBSP margerine and 1 TBSP shortening- (this makes it shiny) and then I used 1/2 C evaporated milk ( this is leftover from the coconut chocolate cake that I made) and 2 TBSP cocoa and 1 cup of 50% cocoa dark chocolate chips to give it a dark rich taste- just a splash of vanilla extract- then I added the confectioners sugar about 2 cups- since I wanted to make it into a glaze I wanted it runny and I poured it over the Coconut Chocolate Cake 1. VERY YUMMY!!!

Great recipe! I don't think this amount makes enough, so I do I little bit different portions, 3-4 oz chocolate depending on how fudgey I want it to be, 4 tbs salted butter, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and then I alternate confectioner's sugar and MILK (not water) until I'm happy with the taste and consistency -- that covers about 24 cupcakes. If you're looking for something rich and creamy to put on any cake, this is perfect. Much better taste than any recipe I've tried with cocoa powder, heating up solid chocolate is the way to go. Also works great for piping if you get it to the right consistency, but that takes a little knowledge of frosting and playing with consistency ;)

I really loved this frosting. The sour cream made it nice and creamy and not too sweet. What I did not realize is I never added the water. It does not need it. I would give this 4 1/2 stars.

I really ennoyed this. Not too sweet for me! I would advise to follow the instructions carefuly. I added the water too quickly (instead of gradually pouring in and watching for the desired constinency)... so mine ended up too thin. But that was completely user error!

I love this frosting.  You can do it all in the microwave - makes it so easy.  (put the chocolate, water, and butter in a microwave proof bowl - melt, then add vanilla & sugar - stir quickly).  Also - using margarine - it becomes a dairy free frosting!

Really good recipe!  I used butter and Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate chips.  It was delicious.  Consistency was perfect.  From now on, this is THE chocolate frosting I will be using for cakes and cupcakes.

This was just okay.  Too sweet for me, and I have a serious sweet tooth.  I would only make it again in an emergency, and then I think I would add another square of chocolate.

This is great for frosting a small pan of brownies, which is what I did.  It is rather sweet, so next time I might add an extra square of chocolate.  Overall it'a a good basic chocolate frosting!

This recipe was easy and yummy, although I doubled the recipe and I had to add a bit more liquid.  I also substituted 1/2 the amount of water with lukewarm coffee that I had already made for the One Bowl Chocolate Cake 3 that I made this for.  YUM!

I made the following changes:
2 3/4 cups confectioners sugar
2 tsp.  Almond extract
6 Tbs.  butter
6Tbs. flavored creamer (caramel  flavor)
I followed the directions as written, made changes
in recipe because that is what I had. I like to make 
changes, the end result was great. the frosting was 
just like it was store bought. love the Almond flavor
of the frosting. put it on a scratch strawberry cake.

To prevent the frosting from getting too hard try adding milk instead if water to the mixture. This also gives it a lighter flavor in terms of intense chocolate that this recipe may tend to give off.

I made this frosting and it was super easy to make and tasted great.  I don't have an electric mixer so I mixed with a spoon without any problems.  I added the sugar a half cup at a time and added a little of the water as I went and it turned out perfect.  Not everyone has an electric mixer but don't let that steer you away from this easy delicious recipe!

Very good!  I doubled this for a 13 inch cake.  Melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave without a problem.  Had a bit of a consistency issue so added 4 heaping tablespoons cocoa powder and 3 heaping tablespoons confectioners' sugar and it turned out well!  Very rich.

I took this recipe up to 9 servings this time because last time I needed a bit more for my tube cake.  It is by far the best chocolate frosting I've ever made.  I put it on a Mohawk Milk cake (recipe on site) and people went nuts!
