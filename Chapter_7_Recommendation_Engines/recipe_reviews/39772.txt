This is a wonderful recipe. My boys really liked it too. Very flavorful and moist. I used fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned. One good sized one did the trick.

I tried this recipe only because I had an extra can of sweet potatoes and was doing a search for recipes.  I NEVER thought I would end up with a cake.  We have an extended family dinner every Sunday and everyone really liked the cake.  (I didn't tell them what was in it for fear the kids wouldn't try it.) I will make it again for sure.  I had a few comments that were suggestions.  My mother thought it would be better without the chocolate chips.  My husband said it tasted better the second day.

This cake was excellent!  The chocolate chips added a sweetness that I prefer to the traditional raisins.  I will definitely make this one again.

I made this recipe for company and it was mediocre. I had put the cake in the fridge to "set it" a bit more, and this may have dried it out.  It was okay, but not spectacular.

VERY VERY GOOD!  Everyone thought it tasted like carrot cake.  My parents thought it would be better without the chocolate chips and to be honest....me too.  I used a regular cream cheese frosting and it was so good!!!  The only problem I encountered was locating a 16 ounce can.  Every can was smaller or bigger and I had to guesstimate.

Yum!  These were delicious - better after standing overnight.  Didn't even need the frosting but it IS delicious!  When using the icing I reduced the white sugar in the batter to 1/2 c.  I substituted 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil with excellent results.  Also, I was able to easily make 24 cupcakes instead of sheet cake and 1/2 a batch of icing will frost all 24 cupcakes.  I made 1/2 with the chocolate chips and 1/2 without and both tasted great.  This  seems like a recipe that would freeze well, so I froze a few too.  I will update my review when they thaw. UPDATE:  they tasted GREAT after having been frozen - just let them thaw in the fridge and they were as moist and yummy as fresh baked.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving. It was a hit with everyone, and has a taste very similar to carrot cake.
