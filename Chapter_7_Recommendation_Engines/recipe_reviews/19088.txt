I used butter instead of shortening.  The ingredients list should include additional 1/4 cup of walnuts.  I made the topping and placed it on top of the cake prior to baking.  The cake tasted wonderful.

This is just an OK cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, did not change a thing.  But although I enjoyed the taste of the cake, did not like the texture.  It was so dense, not a light moist cake at all.  Hopefully it will taste a little better in the morning!  Just did not wow me!

I made this for the photo contest and was amazed by how good it was.  The cinnamon sugar topping made the cake.  It was great warm or cold and will be perfect around the holidays.

This is a great recipie. It's not overly sweet and by using the whole orange you minimize food waste.  The cake was moist, tangy, and packed with flavor; it was a welcome alternative to the super sweet desserts.  Thanks.

YUM! Really good, as a coffee cake or a morning snack! I took someone's advice and added the topping before baking; it worked nicely. I might omit the cinnamon in the topping next time, because I'm not 100% certain it works with the orange flavour. But otherwise, very good cake!! And I love using the WHOLE orange!

This is a GREAT cake - very moist, very flavorful and a crowd pleaser!  I think you could easily serve this as a coffee cake with a crumb topping for breakfast.  I frosted it with cream cheese icing for a birthday party and had compliments galore (a nice change from carrot cake was a frequent comment).  This would also make great muffins w/
streusel topping - so many options!   I plan to make this a lot  at my B&B - thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

I saw this cake being made on PBS and looked for the recipe. It's a great breakfast cake/meal, not too sweet! An important tip I got from PBS is to use a grinder attachment for your Kitchenaid mixer as it does a great job w/ the nuts, then raisins, then orange.

This is a great cake and a great way to use up your entire orange. I ate it for breakfast all week long.

Great tasting cake; I substituted butter for shortening (and decreased it slightly) and added cardamom to the batter and used it for the topping instead of cinnamon. This is a comforting, old-fashioned style cake, not too sweet and great for brunch. I would use a smaller cake pan for a higher cake, and also the ingredient list is missing the sugar that goes in the batter.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, and he liked it as well as my friends.  It smelled great coming out of the oven!

I have made this recipe many times and it is delicious but credit is due to 1950 Pillsbury BakeOff winner Lily Wuebel of Redwood CA for this / her "ORANGE KISS ME CAKE"
This is not meant to be a light fluffy 'cake mix' style cake. it is dense, rich and moist.
