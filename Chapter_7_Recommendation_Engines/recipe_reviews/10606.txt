These cookies turned out delicious, with a the few additional ingredients that I added. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a pinch of salt and a half teaspoon of vanilla or so. Also, if you cook them a little longer, like 12 to 15 minutes and also let the dough sit for 10 minutes after being in the fridge for 15, they aren't so cake textured. A good substitution for the walnuts is almonds, and white chocolate chips. I loved these cookies with the proper adjustments.

I am not a huge chocolate fan (odd choice of cookies, but there you are), and these are right up my alley.  Not over-the-top in-yer-face death-by-chocolate, but a very delicate, mild flavor, cut nicely by the nuts.  The first bite actually tastes a bit bland, but maybe a teeny bit of salt or vanilla could fix that.  After that, they're very good, but subtle.  Also, I like that they stay pillowy soft for days.  Overall, I really like them, but know your audience: a die-hard choco-holic would need to add a generous amount of chocolate chips or something!

The weirdest thing happened when I tried to make these.  I wanted more cookies than it called for so I doubled the recipe.  When I was done mixing all of the ingredients the "dough" was more like a cake or brownie batter.  There is no way I could have made cookies out of the "dough", so I put it into a 13 X 9 in. pan and baked it like a cake.  My husband said they tasted like brownies and they were delicious!  I don't know why this happened, I've been baking for years and have doubled recipes countless times before.  Oh well, they didn't go to waste and we had a yummy treat anyway!  Maybe I will try them again without doubling the recipe and see what happens.

These cookies are a holiday tradition at my house.  Make sure to blend the melted chocolate thoroughly  into the butter/sugar/egg mixture before you add the sour cream.  Adding sour cream before the chocolate has cooled a bit will result in chocolate-flecked batter rather than a uniform color. 

These are a soft, cake-like cookie that should be stored in an airtight container.

These cookies are great!  The sour cream gives them a velvety softness, and the cookies are a nice compliment to a cup of coffee or a cold glass of milk.  I added about a tablespoon of cocoa baking powder and approximately 1/2 cup white chocolate chips.  Yum!  I took these warm from the oven to a meeting, and they were gone in no time.  Next time I think I'll try adding some instant coffee granules or flaked coconut for a different twist.  Thanks for the recipe; it's really easy and quick to make, and would be a good way to introduce children to the fun of baking.

I added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. vanilla because they had obviously been left out.  If I made them again, I would also add an additional 1/2 cup of flour.

With some revision I found these cookies to be quite tasty. As suggested previously, I added 1 tsp. vanilla and a pinch of salt. I also used cocoa instead of melted chocolate. The conversion is as follows: 1 square of chocolate = 3 Tbs. cocoa and 1 Tbs. butter. I used 9 Tbs. cocoa and 3 Tbs. butter so I did up the chocolate content, but they came out with a really nice chocolate flavor. To make them a bit healthier I used one cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour and raw sugar instead of the white. The consistency was just right and that may have been because I used the whole wheat flour. I would definitely make these again.

i made 2 recipes and ended up with about 200 mini cookies for a pot-luck session. After reading other reviews about the difficult batter, i dumped the batter into a piping bag and piped teaspoon sized cookies onto the baking sheet... this method works well and i finished the whole lot pretty fast. Gave it four stars cos i personally prefer crispier cookies, which can be achieved with increased baking time (i forgot about the last batch in the oven, it was perfect by the time i remember).

I too was surprised at the frosting-like consistency of the dough, but the cookies turned out quite well. Be sure to follow the instructions on allowing them to cool before removing from the pan....it helps the cookies "set" and not fall apart. Great mild chocolatey taste in a quick-fix recipe!

These cookies are good, but the problem with them is that their texture is not anything close to a cookie!  They are very sticky and "cakey".  The batter does have a nice taste to it, but I think next time I might just put the batter in an 8 x 8 square pan and make brownies out of them instead.

The texture of these cookies is very cake like and chewy, which I like. However, the taste is lacking. They're not especially chocolatey. I rarely use salt in cookies, but these might benefit from a little bit. They need something. I'm not sure what, but something.

Great! I had a HUGE tub of sour cream from Costco and this was a great combination for a chocolate lover. I read a few reviews before I made it and agreed to double (triple) the chocolate. They turned out great and like cake! We used macadamia nuts because we have a tree growing near us here and hand picked them. That made them even better to us.   I would use this recipe again.

These are brownie-cookies, not cookies. I added a splash (probably more than 1 teaspoon) of almond extract, did a *heaping half-cup* of flour in addition to the whole cup. Used the bigger cookie scoop. Rolled them in sliced almonds. Baked 11 minutes, one sheet at a time. The family loved them.

I don't know what everyone is complaining about-these cookies were great and easy! They are cake-like, so if you don't like cake-like cookies, don't make these. I used macadamia nuts and about half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. You can probably make many varieties of these. I will definitely make again!

OK. VERY cake like. I did add the salt, vanilla and a little cocoa powder to "spark it up." I don't think I would make them again.

I doubled the recipe. I followed the tip about using good cocoa powder and additional butter  from another reviewer (Nimimerle) and put the batter into a zip-loc bag and piped it onto the cookie sheets as suggested by Reviewer HoneyTree. This made it very easy to handle. Be sure to cool for about 5 minutes before removing from cookie sheets and cool additionally on cooling racks. I found these to be easy, but I did use the Kitchen-Aid with the paddle for a long slow creaming of sugar and flour. Others advised to add some alt and vanilla extract, which I did also.Very good, not real sweet.Thanks for the recipe!

To a doubled recipe,I added half again as much chocolate, 1 tsp, vanilla, 1 tsp salt and 2 cups mini M & Ms. They turned out great and tasted wonderful! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really tasty! I made with white whole wheat flour (it was all I had!) and they weren't unbearably heavy. Also, not tremendously sweet, which I like.

My daughter asked for these again. I thought I'd write about how I made them.   I added a pinch of salt and omitted the walnuts.   I rolled them in sugar and flattened them before baking.   They've got a great chocolate flavor and freeze remarkably well.

Just made these without the walnuts but with Reese's peanut butter chips for my husband.  I added the dash of salt and a tablespoon of vanilla & they turned out amazing!  I made my cookies big, so I got a yield of 18.

I liked these better after they cooled ... the flavor isn't very strong.  Maybe some extra cocoa powder would kick them up a bit, but they aren't bad.  I loved the soft, cakey texture.  I'll make these again.  I did add vanilla (1 tsp).

This is a great cookie because you can add a variety of fun things to make them festive. Not everyone in my family likes nuts so I have to find cookie recipes that don't scream for nuts. As suggested in prior reviews I added a few extra ingredients: a bit of salt, 1/4 t of vanilla. To my favorite batch I also added 1/4 t of mint extract and some crushed candy canes to the batter to give them that Christmas flair. To add some additional holiday flair I frosted them with a marshmellow frosting and red sprinkles.

I made these without the walnuts, and added chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and peppermint sprinkles before baking in an attempt to make them Christmassy. They tasted AMAZING. My sister called them "Peppermint Hot Chocolate Cookies," so that's what we'll be calling them this Christmas and for many years to come!

Fantastic finish to a meal. Added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt, as suggested. Added mini semisweet chocolate chips to batter. Finished each baked cookie with a dollop of melted semisweet chocolate thinned with a tsp of cream.

I have used this recipe for 80 years and it remains a favorite.  It is supposed to be a soft, rounded cookie.  Walnuts were optional, preferably black walnuts.  Never chocolate chips.  With a thin, white icing with some good vanilla.

I used dark chocolate for deeper flavor and peanuts instead of walnuts (walnuts used to be inexpensive, now $10/lb; even peanuts have more than doubled in cost to $5/lb) because I like peanuts in chocolate brownies.  Overall, better flavor with changes suggested by other reviewers.

In my recipe, I incorporated the suggestions that others gave here, adding 1/2tsp salt, and about 11/4tsp vanilla, as well as about 1/2c more flour.  My audience was after crunchy cookies, so I spread them thin and baked for 20min.  They turned out pretty well, I'd say.

I didn't taste much of the sour cream, as I was hoping to, though I will say, the sour cream was probably what gave the cookies a velvety texture.  I only made half the batch, so this time I'll try it after having set in the fridge overnight.  Also, perhaps I'll try a dollop of sour cream on top after baking (just for good measure). :)

I agree that these were very cake/brownie like.  The batter was a pain in the butt to work with, but hubby loves the cookies so its all good!

The dough is delicious by itself, but this recipe doesn't "work." The cookies were way too soft and fell apart. Plus the color of them doesn't look like they are chocolate. Thumbs down.

Consistency of batter was a bit unusual but the cookies turned out well. They were just a little bland and perhaps could benefit from 1/4 tsp. or so of salt added to the batter. My kids liked them.
