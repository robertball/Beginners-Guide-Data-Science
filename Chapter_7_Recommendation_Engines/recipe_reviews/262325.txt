A really good chili, that re-heats very well too! I scaled this way back since it was just for my husband and I. Used only about 2 lbs of meat, and it was all ground venison. I also added a chopped bell pepper, some chopped carrot, and some beans to it. The addition of the masa harina was unexpected too. It made the chili thick and added a little bit of corn flavor to it--I really liked it! I really enjoyed this chili; and I almost think it tastes better the next day!
