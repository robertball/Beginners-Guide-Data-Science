We love anything cranberry and this syrup is no exception!  I used 100% organic pure cranberry juice and added sugar - I don't buy juice "cocktail" so I compensated.  2 cups juice , 1/2 cup water and 1 and 1/2 cups sugar.  I boiled as directed until it coated the back of a spoon.  It is SO GOOD!  really, it is delicious .  I will be making this again.
