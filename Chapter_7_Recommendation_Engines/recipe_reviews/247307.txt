I made significant changes to this recipe, so please note the changes. I used 1 medium yellow onion cooked with the beef instead of dried. I diced the zucchini small and added it to the beef when the beef was still a little pink. I didn't have the specialty rice on hand, so I used 1 C rice + a beef bouillon cube in its place. I also used 1 C of canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I let it simmer it for 10 minutes, not 7. My family loved it and gobbled it up.

I increased the portions a bit to be able to feed my growing boys.  I didn't have the Knorr side dish, so I used 2 cups o instant rice and added beef bouillon to the two cups of (boiling) water.  The whole family loved the taste...of course my kids complained about zucchini being in it, but they ate it any way.

I made this recipe with 2 pounds of ground beef, 1 zucchini, 3/4 can diced petite tomatoes, 1/4 dice onion, and 5.5oz jasmine rice because that is all I had, but the recipe came out good. I followed the directions from this recipe just using my ingredients. It was very easy, but NY rice did take 15-20 minutes instead of 7.

Very good; there were no leftovers lol. Only thing I did differently was sub white rice and beef bouillon for the rice packet.

This was a super easy, busy weekday meal. Instead of the Knorr Rice Sides (because I didn't have it), I used 3/4 cup white rice & cooked it in beef broth instead of water. I will definitely be saving this one!

Easy and tasty. Seems like it could be very adaptable, and any vegetable could be used in place of the zucchini. The cheese at the end really ties the whole dish together. Bites without the cheese could use a bit of salt. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef, but I didn’t feel like I was missing anything.

This turned out wonderful. I am always searching for gluten free recipes. I used a different kind of rice, cilantro lime, but it had a great flavor and so easy to make. Adding it to my favorites

I sautéed onions with the ground meat replacing the minced onions. It was a good and quick weekday meal to prepare.
