This is quite good!  I made a few changes.  I'm not a fan of cilantro for cilantro's sake, so I left it out, but I used fresh mint and basil out of my garden to really give it that stronger herb flavor.  The dressing was good, but seemed to be missing something, so I added spicy chili garlic paste, lime juice and a pinch of onion salt to give it some zing.  Fantastic!   It really was tasty,and I bet the leftovers will be even tastier tomorrow.  Even my almost two-year-old son loved it, and everyone knows toddlers can be picky!

Little heavy on the lime, and I found myself making extra dressing to mix in - but a very unique flavor, and very good.

This recipe was a great way to add some excitement to brown rice. I served it with the Thai Breaded Chicken Fillets from this site and it was a very satisfying meal.

I tried this recipe over Memorial Day weekend with 12 members of my family including young children. They all loved it and asked for the recipe. Very light, refreshing, and healthy. Thanks!

This was the featured recipe of the day on allrecipes and I really wanted to try it. Poached a chicken breast to make it more of a main dish and made twice as much dressing to coat the red leaf lettuce I added to the toss.  Very, very tasty and a recipe I'm sure I'll make again...

Pretty good. I halved this recipe and made it for my husband to take to work for lunch. I added red onion, red bell pepper, and some grilled chicken. Amazingly, with all the flavors going on in the dressing - not to mention all the herbs, - as written, it was a little bland. I ended up adding lime juice, sesame oil, more soy sauce, and a little fish sauce to it and it turned out good. Thanks!

Okay ... I would give this 5 stars, but the rest of the family wasn't as wild about it as I was, so I'm giving it four.  It's different, great to make up ahead ... wonderful for summer!

I thought that this was very good. It was very light and refreshing on a hot summer day, and it was a great use of the basil and mint in my garden!

This was delicious -- my husband and I both loved it.  I halved the recipe for the two of us and it still made more-than-enough.  Next time, I might add some salt/pepper and perhaps garlic.
