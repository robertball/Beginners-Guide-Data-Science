Unfortunetly I am bias as I submitted the recipie. However I felt that I must defend myself as this being an original english recipie. My mother used to say that you "had to beat a lot of love into it" so I'm afraid those lumps only go away with a good beating....must be a strong Yorkshire arm that is needed or an electric whisk!!! It is also best left to stand for 10 minutes after beating. As for flavour it is best served with a rich onion gravy....a very english taste! And if you can get Linconshire Sausages or herby sausages even better. Good luck and enjoy.

This recipe got a thumbs-up from my British boyfriend - I used veggie sausage and added sage to the batter and it turned out well. However I have two constructive criticisms. Number one - the pan size was too large for the scant amount of batter. Using a smaller pan makes it more likely the batter will puff up with higher volume. Secondly I would reverse the order of the ingredients adding flour to the already-beaten liquid ingredients. I had a hard time getting the lumps out of the batter when adding eggs to flour.

Excellent. My missus got jealous that I could make this dish better than her. Didn't tell her I found the recipe here mind you.

I used an 8x8 inch pan and added sauteed onions and a pinch of thyme.I suppose you could use any other herb. It really helped to boost the flavor. Next time I think I'll try a different sausage. Overall a great easy basic recipe. Thanks! Larry

Recently returned from a trip to London. I loved this dish while I was there. This is a great recipe with a few modifications. First use a bigger casserole dish maybe 9x13 so it is thoroughly cooked. Second pick up a packet of brown gravy to pour over the top. A Definitely a new family favorite. Super quick prep time. I also used my mixer on the batter.

This recipe was OK. It's a little bland. Maybe more salt and pepper or some other type of spices would liven it up. I might make it agin.

Very easy to prepare and was very tasty and a very "stick to your ribs" meal. However after reading the other reviews prior to making it..I did add some garlic powder to the batter for a little more flavour. Don't forget to not open the oven door until puffy and golden. Enjoy!

This was wonderful. I made onion gravy (yum!) to go with this and was a perfect meal with some cucumbers and fresh green beans from the garden. ALL THREE KIDS ate with no complaints and there were NO leftovers. The kids even wanted it again two days later. One caution-don't peek while it's baking or it won't puff right. Thanks for a terrific recipe!!

I tried this recipe just for its names' sake tonight. Very easy funny and unusual here in Czechia. Also tasty. I had no problem with this recipe it is good just as is (don't know about a pan size). Unfortunately I've never heard of the onion gravy and had no time to explore so I added little dried garlic to the batter and ate it with mustard. Thanks!

I'm giving this five stars because fulfills all our dinner requirements: it's good filling cheap and my young son will eat it without complaint.:) The only ways we change the recipe: 1- After lining casserole dish with tinfoil spray tinfoil with nonstick spray on sides as well as the olive oil on the bottom (otherwise the dough sticks to the sides after cooking). 2- Add 1/2 tsp garlic powder to flour before adding eggs. 3- I bake the sausages for five minutes alone and then pour the batter over it for the normal 25-30 min cooking time to ensure the sausages are well-cooked. 4- We usually eat this topped with brown gravy (from a powdered mix) and with a side dish of peas.

This is a good version of Toad in the hole but I believe it is essential to cook the sausages in the roasting pan before pouring the batter over. The appearance is so much better and any fat can be used to cook the batter in. Don't fret over the lumps in the batter they disappear during cooking. I prefer much darker color than the picture. A teaspoon of Horseradish sauce stirred into the batter is a bonus.

We wanted to make something different for St. Patrick's Day so we tried this because I found a similar recipe on an Irish website but didn't want to do the metric conversions. We wrapped our sausages in bacon and put in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes with a little olive oil. After 20 minutes we added the batter and baked for an additional 35 minutes. I was disappointed in the breading as it didn't have much flavor. The sausage however was excellent. I just wish this dish had more zing.

The sausage was good (as it was bought as is from the store) but the "Yorkshire pudding" was bland tastless. In all this was a very bad meal in my honest opinion.

Made this twice now. Excellent results each time. Instead of 12 pork sausages we use 8 (usually honey garlic flavour) and half a pack of bacon (375g). This dish would be well suited, I think  with some gravy mix to pour over it, or add some cut up sausage and bacon with Yorkshire batter to a muffin pan and have toads in the hole for breakfast.

Used precooked brown and serve sausage and scaled recipe for two. Used dried minced onion and mushroom seasoning (1/4 tsp. each). Did not use the extra oil, rather used non stick spray instead. Seemed a little dry. Maybe serve with a cream gravy or maple syrup. Definitely would make again but probably would serve with maple syrup.

This recipe was very easy to make! I let the batter sit for about 10 minutes before I baked it as the author suggestion and it puffed up great for me! I experimented with spices in the batter and used rosemary which wasn't quite the right spice but it was still pretty good. I hate to say this but it tasted a lot like a corn dog (in a good way). Thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for this at all. It sounded real good and I made it for breakfast while company was over.... it didn't go over well at all. The mixture was just to dense. I think it would be better if you added cheese and took out the four all together. Will I be making this one again? No thank you!
