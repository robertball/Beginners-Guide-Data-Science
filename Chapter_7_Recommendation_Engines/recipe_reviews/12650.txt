Contrary to one reviewer's opinion, people didn't eat rancid meat in the middle ages. The spices they used were what was available at the time and pleasing to medieval palates. This is a delicious recipe--the version I use contains several eggs as well as a little roasted pork, another commonly used meat on non-fasting days. We leave out the nuts due to allergy, but almonds were a very common ingredient in the middle ages, so leave it in if you can.

Holy cow.... How delicious and, as one reviewer already said, filling!  :-)  Thank you SO MUCH for posting this recipe. It is a welcome addition to my family's favorites and a fun way to incorporate a History lesson into an everyday kind of event. Before tripping upon this recipe, I would not dream of eating ANY "pot pie" or "a la king" type of dish, as I found the tasteless, slimy fillings to be a complete turn-off. Dégoûtant! However, the rich, thick (thanks to the ground almonds), and well-spiced filling of this pie pleased the entire family. Perfect on a cold Winter's day. The only modifications I made were an egg-wash on top for a beautiful, golden brown glaze... and the addition of a handful of frozen peas/carrots (which I also HATE but ATE... LOL) in an attempt to sneak in some veggies for the children. Added those to the chicken's cooking water near the end of the cooking time. Oh, almost forgot - I added green cardamom pods to the chicken cooking water, too. However, they didn't lend much flavor... with the exception of a lone pod I missed fishing-out that exploded in my poor husband's mouth - a bit too much flavor there! Whooooooops. A tip to keep the edges of the pie crust from getting too brown:  If you're already brushing the crust with an egg-wash, try rinsing the brush and giving the edges a good soaking brush with just plain water. I did that twice once the crust edges had reached optimum color, and the edges stayed beautiful. The color was unifo

I was a bit skeptical about trying this but I thought why not? Thank goodness I did... The filling was absolutely delicious. I'm not a pie fan myself as I always find they never have enough filling but this was absolutley beautiful thanks :)

Authentic in the sense that heavy spices would have been used to mask the taste and smell of rancid meat (since there was no refrigeration until the 20th c.), but my husband and I did not find the taste at all appealing.  I had to toss over half the pie because neither of us were going to eat the leftovers.  I don't know how authentic the cheese part is and the peasant most likely wouldn't have had access to the myriad of spices this dish calls for.          It would be interesting to make for a school project but I wouldn't make it otherwise.  It might have been [slightly] better if I hadn't used chicken breast - fatty thigh and leg would probably be better.

This pie is delicious, and I would absolutely make it again and again.  It was pretty easy and not overly time-consuming.  I did have to make some changes.  I don't like almonds, so I did not include the ground almonds, although my boyfriend thinks it would be very good with them.  I also did not have any mace or white pepper, and because I used a bouillon cube to make the broth, I omitted the salt.  It does start out very soupy, but solidifies very nicely when baked.  And to answer my brother, no, you do not have to cut it with a sword!

I made this in individual sized pies.  A doubled recipe made 6.  It had a little too much liquid so in the future I would cut it back by 1/4th.  It was very good.  The different spices made it interesting.

An amazing mixture of spices and flavor. I use chicken stock for prepping the chicken. This recipe is excellent with lamb as well.

This was a really nice twist on a chicken pot pie-the mace makes a big difference in the flavor.

I was nervous about what my husbands opinion about this would be. No fear he really liked it. In fact I think that he liked it more than me. The only complaint was that I  over reacted a little to people who said that it was too soupy after cooking. My came out a little too dry. But the flavor and texture was still very good. I really recomend using the whole wheat pie crust.

This was a very interesting recipe.  I really liked the almonds.  Couldn't taste the dates.  The spices were unique.  I made it for a Society for Creative Anachronism party and everyone agreed it was medievalish.  I may make it again and play with the spices.  I think my palate is a bit modern for cinnamon with chicken.

This cooked up nicely but the taste just didn't really appeal. I felt like the filling should have been apple instead of chicken. Just not a pie for us.

This was certainly the best chicken pie I have ever tasted!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written... it turned out beautifully!  Next time I will add more dates and try a different mix of spices.  Very filling!

This is delicious!  I didn't have ground almonds so I omitted those and it was still fabulous.  My husband LOVED it!  Thanks!

Very nice! Feels really authentic and old.
Super strange spice combo with chicken, but it works like a charm!

This was very good, I loved it but everyone else said to just not make it again, which is surprising because we all like foreign and exotic flavors. I used a homemade whole wheat crust (could tell it was better), nutmeg instead of mace and used a dash of extra cinnamon for that (looked it up), two eggs, and about 1T flour to make it thicker (based on reviews). I would maybe add some thyme or sage for some herbal flavor and maybe some cardamom, but I like all of those a lot. One of the "haters" agreed that it was better cold than warm, but we both like cold food. A good recipe though.

I was very excited to find this recipe! However, when I was making it, My hope for it began to fade, because, it looked really disgusting. When it came out of the oven and was sitting on the plate, my hope for it had all but disappeared. Then, I took a bit of the pie.  Delicious! The flavors meld together perfectly. However, The presentation is definatly a bit... Medieval looking. But the the taste is worth it! thanks!

This recipe was surprisingly good! It's got a very excellent mix of flavours. Somehow, I ended up with too little liquid though, so my pie was a bit dry, but I think next time that can be avoided by making sure my stock doesn't reduce too much.

I've made this pie twice now. It's an odd or distinctive combination of flavors that I'm not used to but I rather like it. The second time I used more dates (maybe 1/2 cup?) and a whole wheat crust. My family gobbled it up both times. We ate some spiced peaches with it because they seemed to fit the medieval theme. I recommend giving this one a chance!

PS- For some reason, I enjoy the cold leftovers possibly better than when it was hot.

My family loved this pie!  It was quick and easy to make, and it was very filling, too.
