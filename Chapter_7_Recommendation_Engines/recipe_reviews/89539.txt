We live in Mexico and this is AS CLOSE TO AUTHENTIC as possible.  I love "cheater" recipes like this.  Open a few cans, dump it in, and wa-la!  In Mexico we buy the right variety of peppers, cook them down, throw them in the blender, etc to make meals like this.  This saves all that hassle for a genuine taste.  My entire family says it's as good as the tortilla soups served here in local restaurants.  That's the highest compliment a recipe can be given!  Don't bother cooking the chicken ahead of time.  Throw it in with the rest in the beginning and shred it 2-3 hours later.   Hint:  serve with lime juice, a tsp of sour cream, chopped avocados, or pork rind along with the cheese to really eat it like a Mexican.  BTW, I bought bagged tortilla chips and worked fine.

This was a hit!  Super easy and very tasty.  I threw in a couple of frozen chicken breasts rather than cooking them first and saved myself a step.  (I shredded them towards the end.)  I also used bagged tortilla chips instead of making my own.  I'm all about "easy".  :0)

This recipe would be a little more authentic if you skip the canned enchilada sauce and instead made your own. VERY EASY. Take 3-4 large dried ancho chiles (cut off the stems and remove the seeds) and boil them with a cup or so of water, garlic and onion. After a half hour, whir it all together in your blender with a small can of tomato puree. Add some cumin if you like. Salt to taste. I live in Mexico, and believe me, there is NO such thing as canned enchilada sauce here. Also - the shredded or sliced chicken is usually added as a garnish here, not cooked in the soup.

This was FABULOUS!!!  I used 1 qt. of chicken stock in lieu of broth and water, tossed in 3 raw chicken breasts (shredding 3 1/2 hours after cooking on high in the slow-cooker), doubled the garlic, used frozen roasted corn (Trader Joe's) and added 2 cups cooked brown rice (added the same time as the shredded chicken).  I topped each bowl served with shredded chedder, sliced green onions, a couple of cilantro leaves, the tortilla strips (be sure to make your own!) and chunks of ripe avocado.  I also added a couple of shakes of Tapatio (hot sauce) to my own bowl as I wanted more kick than my husband - who had thirds.  I can't wait to share this recipe!

Wonderful!  Definitely cook the chicken in the soup as suggested by previous reviewers.  This soup will only be hot and spicy if you use hot ingredients - I used mild enchilada sauce, etc. and my kids asked me to make it spicier next time - go figure! I also omitted the salt and used low salt products.  Used a 2nd can of chicken broth in place of the water.  Store bought tortilla chips are the way to go - try melting some sharp cheddar on the chips before adding to the soup along with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and a dollup of sour cream - yum!

Amazing soup!!  I took advise of other reviewers and added black beans - definitely a good idea.  Also tossed in chicken still frozen and shredded about an hour before serving - worked like a charm.  Just finished the leftovers yesterday and I can't wait to make again!! Tortilla strips are easier with cooking spray instead of oil and I like to add salt, garlic powder and a little cumin to them before baking.

This recipe, unfortunately, is only worth two stars--barely.  Too watery, too spicy, and tasted just like liquid enchiladas. And except for using broth instead of water, which really should have helped this, and black beans rather than corn, I prepared this as the recipe directed.  I had to try and save it! To start with, I removed the majority of the liquid from the slow cooker and replaced it with chicken broth--better, but there still was no substance to the soup.  So I cooked a cup of rice and added it to the soup at the end and...now we're talking!  MUCH better--now it's FIVE stars.  I topped each serving with sour cream, which really mellowed it out and added a rich creaminess, shredded cheddar cheese, and the tortilla crisps (which, by the way, didn't EVEN need 10-15 minutes so watch them carefully!)  Now I had a soup that was not only palatable, but it was just delicious.  But the effort I had to put into it to make it so was too much trouble, a waste of some ingredients, and just simply not worth it.  The soup I ended up with was downright delicious--but it was not THIS recipe.

Started this Friday morning for our church small group meeting Friday night. The house smelled great! I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and 2 more cups of chicken broth to make it soupier. I put "sides" in bowls  for guests to make their own versions (shredded cheese, fresh avocado, and sour cream). Used plain tortilla chips that guests could sprinkle over their own bowls, and made  a pot of brown rice. Add a scoop of rice to your bowl, then put soup on top, then add your choice of sour cream, avocado, and/or cheese, and mix together. Yummy and great for a cold night!

Truthfully, I don't know why you would need a slow cooker if all of the ingredients are pre-cooked...  And, it's probably true that the recipe is better than what you normally get in a restaurant, since most restaurant soups are from commercial package mixes (freeze dried ingredients)...  Truthfully, if you wish to make a good recipe, you really should make the broth yourself and NEVER use canned chilies and canned broth, unless your idea of a wonderful soup is a heated brine solution...

After reading a review from a reviewer in Mexico I followed his/her lead on preparing this soup. THIS IS THE BEST TORTILLA SOUP THERE IS. I used 3 good sized FROZEN boneless chicken breasts. I mixed ALL remaining ingredients (except the cilantro & lime juice) in a large mixing bowl ... poured it over the chicken breasts, turned on the slow cooker to low, left, and played golf .. came home .. shredded the chicken, let it go another 2 hours, added the lime juice and cilantro ... opened a cold beer ... crumbled some tortilla chips (from a bag) ... and had a GREAT meal. Next time I'll garnish with avocado chunks. MAKE THIS SOUP ------ TONIGHT!!!!!!!

This was great!  I used only 1/2 tsp of cumin and chili powder so it wouldn't be too hot.  And I threw in 2 whole chicken breasts and shredded them after they cooked.  (the meat was so tender it just fell apart)  My only change in the future will be to use tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas...it would be less work, same taste.

Yum!  I have to admit that I tweaked this a bit to suit my family's tastes, but what a wonderful starting point! I seldom even look at recipes that are rated less than 4 (there are just so many great recipes from all you wonderful cooks - and never enough time to make them all!).  And I always read the reviews first, before I start cooking (it pays to do so).  My changes: diced mexican-style tomatoes; one jalapeno, chopped (we like it spicy); a can of black beans; one package of frozen corn, black beans, and peppers; about 1 1/2 tsps mexican oregano; and 1 tsp. each of chili powder, taco seasoning (from this site), and cumin.  I just laid the frozen chicken breasts in the rest of the mixture and took them out after about 5 hours on low to let them cool so I could shred them.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used my immersion blender to puree the soup just a bit (while the chicken was cooling), and at the very end, I added about a T. of lime juice.  I served this with the Homesteader Cornbread from this site, and a green salad of romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, and avocado with the Spicy Cilantro Dressing, also from this site.  Thanks for a great dinner everyone!

Such an easy and wonderful recipe! I did make a few adjustments. I used chicken broth instead of water. I also used spicy rotel instead of the mashed whole tomatos. I also doubled the garlic, cilantro, and added a few dashes of cayennne pepper. I used some minced fresh jalapeno and the juice from one lime. The lime juice makes a huge difference...trust me. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of drained black beans,and I am really glad I did. I put three whole chicken breasts in and shredded it about an hour before it was finished cooking. I also have to say the tortilla strips are 100% worth making....brush with a little garlic olive oil for an awesome flavor. I served with a topping of shredded cheese, sour cream, and diced advocado. Thank you so much for this recipe! So easy and so tasty! This is going to be a favorite soup in our house from now on!

First there was silence as the spoons were lifted.....and then one by one my family (including me) uttered "Oh my gosh" and "This is incredible!" and then silence again as we savoured the next spoonful, followed by more compliments! I gave it 5 stars because it's an excellent recipe, and I'd give it 10 stars with the minor changes I made. First of all, I threw 5 medium-sized raw boneless skinless chicken breasts right into the crockpot. And then added the recipe's ingredients, including these changes: I subbed 1 can of diced tomatoes for the whole ones,  1/2 tsp garlic powder for the garlic cloves, and subbed a can of chicken broth for the water (for a total of 2 cans chicken broth), and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I set the slow-cooker on High,  shredding the chicken after 3 hours, then added 1 can of black beans and 1 chopped red pepper, and then set it on Low for another 2 hours to really let the flavours meld. We added shredded cheddar and sour cream as toppings, along with the home-made tortilla strips  (baked for just 8 minutes. Watch carefully so they don't burn!) and cilantro. We found the spiciness to be just right.  But if you want it "hotter", I'd suggest using "medium" or "hot" enchilada sauce. Thanks, Elena, for an awesome, awesome recipe!

I didn't know one could copy a recipe from a cookbook onto this website or I would have done it years ago.  This recipe is straight out (verbatim) of my crock-pot cookbook and I've been making it for years.  My husband likes it so much that I usually double the recipe so that we can freeze some and eat off it forever.  I get requests for this soup often; it always gets eaten right up and gets rave reviews every time.  My favorite ingredient is actually the enchilada sauce, as it makes the soup just spicy enough for everyone's taste.

My fella and I loved this recipe!  Preparation was a cinch, the ingredients are inexpensive, and it tasted wonderful topped with sour cream and cilantro.  Next time we'd both be happy without the tortilla strips, but the soup itself is divine.  Thank you!

This recipe was super-easy and absolutely delicious!! I took the advice of other reviewers and threw in raw chicken breasts at the beginning into the slow cooker instead of cooking them in a skillet first. I let all of the ingredients cook throughout the day on low while I was at work and when I got home the chicken was done and ready to shred (so easy to do). I topped off the soup with sour cream, fresh diced avocados and tortilla strips. YUM!!

My husbands family is all from Mexico and he grew up watching his Aunt's and Grandma make authentic Mexican food and had the pleasure of eating it.  He said that this was by far the best most authentic Chicken Tortilla Soup he has ever had!  I trippled the recipe (You need a very large crockpot or two to tripple it, doubling recipe you only need one large crockpot) so I could freeze the rest for dinner's throughout the month.   I used tortilla chips and crushed them to add on top of each serving.  To make it more authentic add shredded mexican style cheese, avocado and sour cream in each serving.  It looks beautiful and taste even better.  I also used chicken thighs, "put them in frozen" and at the end pealed off the fat.  Use two forks to shred the chicken off bone... it falls off the bone.  Put them back in the soup and its ready to serve. I did it the fast way (4 hours on high). NO NEED TO COOK CHICKEN BEFORE HAND, NO NEED TO MAKE YOUR OWN TORTILLA CHIPS.  It took me 10 minutes to prepare! Perfect for making for get togethers...

Very delicious soup.  I also just added a pound of boneless chicken breasts and broke them up later before serving.

I fell in love with this recipe after my first bite.  It's hard for me to find ingredients where I live so I was forced to make my own enchilada sauce (I used the 10 minute enchilada sauce from this website) as well as chicken broth from scratch.  This may have made the recipe superior to canned products but I cannot be certain.  I do know that it's wonderful!  I made mine a little hotter than called for but the recipe strongly held it's flavor without being overpowered by spice alone.  A little sour cream in the soup is a nice touch.  Also, if you feel daring, separate out some broth, tomato chunks, corn (everything but the chicken) and blend in a blender or with a hand wand.  The thicker texture is an improvement.

Been making for quite a while now.  I throw everything into the crockpot the night before (except for the chicken) then store in fridge.  Take it out in the morning and throw a frozen chicken breat in and slow cook on low all day.  I take the chicken out and shred it and return before serving.  A family favorite at our house.

My mom has been making this recipe for forever and this one from this site is better than hers! I tweak it to make sure I use low sodium, fat free, etc. And I also do not add any beans because my husband is allergic to them. All in all, this recipe is the best for a cool fall or cold winter day!

Worked out great.  Was spicy for some but I thought it was great.  To shorten time; the tortillas strips can be found near the croutons and/or tortilla chips.

The only change I made to this recipe is I baked some chicken breast first in the oven with some cumin and chili powder on top.  Then threw it in the crockpot.  This is a soup we will add to our rotation.

With a couple of slight changes this recipe is exceptional! First change was instead of putting the chicken in the crock pot cooked, I put it in raw. After 3 1/2 hours on high it if fully cooked and practically fell apart by itself. Second, I drained the juice from the tomato can before adding them (A true chicken tortilla soup is not supposed to have heavy tomato flavoring). Thirdly, I added a little less than the full can of chopped green chile peppers (Just to make sure it wasn't too spicy). The last changes I made was that I served the soup with a side of fresh sliced avodaco, and shredded cheese along with the tortilla strips,  all for optional additions. This recipe reminds me of San Antonio, TX so much!!! I've made this recipe twice and it is an absolute favorite amongst my partner and I.

This is a keeper, but there is no need to use cooked chicken.  I used frozen breasts, cooked it for 9 hours, shredded the chicken and added it back in.  No need to top with tortillas, either -- just use corn chips.  This is a really great soup that is much easier than the ingredient list looks!

This was very good. I didn't have the chili peppers  so I used 3 small cans of rotel instead of the tomatoes. I also added 3 frozen chicken breast and a can of black beans. I used bagged chips(time saver). Will make this again.

This soup was delicious! Since I had 3 quite large bone-in chicken breasts, I decided to double the other ingredients; seasonings as well. Used no water; all chicken broth. Didn't have any frozen corn on hand, so I just added a can of Summer Crisp, along with a can each of pinto and black beans. I cooked up 2 cups of rice on the side, which we added to the bowls in desired amounts along with crushed tortilla chips, grated Mexican blend cheese, sliced avocado, a sprinkle of lime juice and for my hubby, a dollop of sour cream with more freshly minced cilantro. Cooked on low 6 hours; shredded chicken and returned to soup for about 2 hours longer. This is great soup, Elena... thank you so much for the recipe. I have quite a bit in the freezer (without the chips and extras, of course... can't wait to try this on my kids this coming week!)

Great recipe, tasty and hearty and fits into any diet. I made this at the cabin while we were doing renovations, served with corn bread it was a treat for every one who was working so hard. Thanks for the recipe, will do again and again.

Delicious!  Like other users, I put the whole boneless chicken breasts in the pot at the beginning of cooking, then pulled them out, shredded them and returned to pot about an hour before it was finished.  I will definitely do that again!  Chicken shredded with barely a touch and the taste was excellent.  I also added sliced carrots and used tortilla chips from a bag, which were fine.  Will definitely make again!

So delicious! I heeded the warning from other reviewers that the soup was a bit spicy, so I used mild enchilada sauce and mild green chiles. I also followed the suggestion of putting 2 whole raw chicken breasts in at the beginning and I'll continue to do it this way. The meat was so perfectly tender after 6 hours that I just shredded it with 2 forks. I will definitely make this again and again.

This is an excellent soup!  I should add that I calculated all of my ingredients (which was everything except the bay leaf) and it came out to 152 cal, 4 g fat, 12 g carb, and 18 g protein per serving (about 2 cups).  I'm on a very strict diet and watch my calorie/fat/carb/protein ratio like a hawk.  This is an awesome soup that is pretty much an "all in one" meal!

Excellent soup.  I tweaked it a little and added 5 corn tortillas, DICED, directly into the soup in the beginning.  While cooking, they dissolve completely, add flavor and also thicken the soup without having to add flour or cornstarch.

Very tasty when made as directed.  It could be better with more complexity in the flavors, and if you like things spicy I might suggest adding a serranno pepper chopped in thin slices for the last hour.  Fresh lime wedges as a garnish is good, and squeezing the wedge into the soup just before eating adds a nice twist.

O M G this was the BEST tortilla soup ive ever had & my hubby declared this the best soup overall hes ever had! this was so easy to make. & it cost less than $ 5 to make.
i followed the recipe to a T except...
i added 1 lb of raw boneless chix thighs &
2 raw corn on the cobs, cut in half.
after 3 hrs, the chix was shredded & dumped back in.
honestly, all i had to do was buy the meat, unwrap it when i got home & plop it in the crockpot.
it would taken more time & energy to open a can of chicken &/or boil chicken & cut it.
i served this w/ avocado, monterey jack cheese, lime , cilantro & freshly fried tortilla strips. 
man, those strips were the cherry on top.
i will forever make this . & i think i found ONE reason to look forward to the fall/winter months...

SAFETY ALERT!  If you don't follow the recipe directions and decide to start with raw chicken, be sure to boil the soup or bring to at least 170 degrees, to kill bacteria.

One word...WOW!  I decided to make this for my family on ou rainy-Christmas day, 2008!  This was a fantabulous recipe for a crock pot!  I did some altering, of course!  I started with 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts, thrown in the pot first.  Followed by the large container of chicken stock.  Spice it up with about 3/4 of a large can of red enchilada sauce, cumin, chili-powder, poultry seasoning, bay leaves (2) salt, pepper and of course fresh garlic (3 cloves) and one whole onion.  I added 2 cans of sweet corn, dranied.  Then add one large can of cubed, mexican style tomatoes.  After cooking on high for 6-8 hours, assemble in a nice pasta  bowl.  First I slice white corn tortillas into 1 1/2 inch strips and fry in oil till light and crispy then lightly salt.  Put a small handful in thre bottom of a owl and top with shredded cheese.  Then ladle some soup into the bowl, making sure to include PLENTY of liquid.  Pull some cilantro leaves off the stem and add to top of bowl along with sliced avocado.  Then squeeze a lime wedge over top of avocado and leavethe wedge in bowl.  Top with a dallop of sour cream a few more tortilla strips and a sprinkle of cheese.  My 12 year old son, 8 year old daughter and I ate the entire pot throughout the day..and they BEGGED me to make more instantly!!!!  This is definitely the best recipe I have ever used for this dish, BY FAR, and  the easiest!!!  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY - The family is impressed therefore....I THANK YOU!!!!  To all who are re

My family didn't like this at all. If you follow the recipe as is, it's very bland and tasteless. Other reviewers added this and that and gave it a good rating but that makes it a whole different recipe. It was very watery and the homemade tortilla strips sogged up as soon as they were put into the bowl. I definitely will not make this again.

This was watery and bland.  It seemed pointless to use whole red tomatoes. It was like having red ping pong balls in corn, enchilada water. I don't understand why people are giving it such good ratings. It wasn't authentic or flavorful at all.

I add the chicken raw and let it cook in the soup. I add a can of black beans and rice to bulk up the soup. I garnish with cheese, avocado and sour cream. I've been cooking this for years, and it's one of my families favorites! Best of all, the leftovers are just as good or better! And it freezes well.

Top notch soup, even better the next day. Medium heat enchilada sauce keeps the heat level bearable, and fresh pasilla chile in place of the canned chiles adds an extra layer of flavor.

I am so disappointed in this soup!  I was expecting a really good meal because it has such high ratings,  but all I got was shredded chicken in enchilada water.  I sure didn't see that coming!  ***We ate on this the first night and still had so much left over.   I hated to throw it away, so I made up Taco Seasoning I and added 4 tsp. to the leftovers.  This seemed to be the missing ingredient all along!  Much better now!

My family and I love this recipe! I usually double recipe. I also use a can of Rotel in place of the whole tomatoes and can of green chilis. I put whole deboned uncooked chicken breasts in the slow-cooker along with all other ingredients and then shred chicken with a fork just before serving. This is great served with tortilla chips if you don't want to hassle with the tortilla strips.

Excellent. I added black beans and about a cup of milk/cream to make a creamy soup. I prepared it in the crock-pot and froze the rest. The good news, it's just as good out of the freezer!

I've made this twice now. It's really easy and delicious. I use chicken thighs and throw them in raw. I also included a can of rinsed black beans. My kids complained it was too spicy last time so I used a can of diced tomatoes with onions and green chiles, instead of a whole can of green chiles. I also omitted the enchilada sauce and put in a can of tomato paste and a packet of taco seasoning. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Served it with rice to make it more like a stew. Yummy!

I don't know what happened, I followed the recipe, but it just wasn't good to me.  I love tortilla soup, but not this one.  Just blah, not the great flavor I expected. I added black beans and it still was not very hardy.  Maybe because it is a slow cooker recipe, I've found stovetop recipes usually turn out better.

I don't usually review recipes, but this was not good.  We ended up throwing the whole thing away trying to eat a bowl.  Would not recommend, and i followed the recipe exactally

I made this recipe for company. It was easy to throw the ingredients in the crockpot but I didn't even have room to add all the water into a 6 quart crockpot and it was so bland with the water I did add.   I did not care for this recipe at all!

I love love love this soup!!!!  I, too, add black beans and throw EVERYTHING in the pot (chicken, too) to cook together. Couldn't be simpler. I live overseas and have been asked for this recipe so many times by non-Mexican food eaters.

Love this recipe and it's a favorite among my family. The only thing that bothers me about this recipe is that it's very thin and I'm thinking it's only an issue because my old roommate's recipe wasn't like that and I loved hers! Definitely one I would suggest regardless :)

We didn't care for at all.  Very thin and too much liquid and taste wasn't there for us.  Gave 2 stars because it is easy.  However, won't make again.

Wow I'm glad I tried this. Threw in rotel instead of the canned chillis and added black beans. I only added about 3/4 cup corn.  Was absolutely wonderful. I did make the soft tortilla strips in the oven with a little garlic salt and they were great too.

Very easy and quick low fat soup.  Did follow others suggestions. For the chicken I just defrosted it enough to cut off the fat. Instead of water I added two cans of broth.  I doubled the garlic and used dried cilantro. Used a can of diced tomatoes instead of cutting up whole tomatoes.  Also added a green pepper for extra flavor. Crushed up tortilla chips in it once served. Excellent flavor. Will make it again.

I wish I could give this recipe way more than 5 stars. This soup is literally incredible. I have never tasted any soup as delicious as this one. I could seriously put it in a cup and drink it. The broth is so flavorful it could be eaten by itself. Here's how I make it my own: I do cook the chicken beforehand. I use 1 1/2 pounds (a pound is not enough) of boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins or breasts. I season them with mrs. dash, oregano, garlic powder, and onion salt and bake them in the oven with a little bit of water at 375 for 25 minutes. I use all mild ingredients just because I don't like things too spicy. Instead of taking the time to chop up the onions and peppers I throw in a jar of tostito's chunky salsa. It adds a lot of flavor and also makes more soup in the end. I add 2 packets of chicken bouillon to the water and then an extra packet to the actual soup just because. I also put in more corn and add some oregano. I just use a bag of tortilla chips for convenience and always add lots of cheddar cheese. If you want it to serve more you could add a packet of mahatma saffron yellow rice. This soup is so good that even if you're stuffed you have to get more. My fiancé absolutely loves it. He drank the broth like milk at the bottom of a cereal bowl. Next time I'm making two crockpots of it. It's goes great with "Annie's Fruit Salsa and Cinnamon Chips" from this website for dessert!

I hate being part of the minority here, but we didn't like this. It was edible, but so bland! Even after increasing the spices. It was like watery salsa chicken soup. After we ate it, I said "Well, I'm not making this again" to which my husband replied "Thank you!" Ah well.

This recipe was good and I will make it again with a couple of changes. The next time I would omit the chicken as I don't think it added a whole lot to the flavor. I will also increase the amount of enchilada sauce, decreasing the amount of water and add some cheddar cheese right to the soup pot.

I don't like spicy food so I left out the chile peppers and the chili powder and I still didn't like it. DH wasn't overly fond of it either, so I won'd be making it again.

I love the ease of this recipe.  It is delish BUT I warn you it has some heat!  My kids would barely touch it.  I like hot things and it was almost too hot for me.  My hubby seemed like he was in heaven though.  I think I will try to tone down the heat a bit to make it more family friendly.

Very good!  Tastes like restaurant tortilla soup.  I followed the recipe as is, except I put the raw chicken breasts in the crockpot and shredded the chicken later.  I also omitted the tortilla strips on top.  I wouldn't change a thing except I would prefer less corn in the soup.

This is a family favorite!!!  Here are some changes that I make:  For large crock pot, substitute 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes w/zesty chiles, rather than 2 cups water.  Add a can of "Black beans with cumin and chili spices"; Double chili powder and add chipolte chili powder.  Cook for 6 hours on low then shred chicken. Cook 2 hours additionally. Top with cheese, sour cream, jalapenos and crushed tortilla chips. Excellent!!!

This was so fabulous!  I took the advice of a lot of other reviewers and made some substitutions:

1. Can of diced tomato with spicy red pepper rather than can of whole peeled tomatoes.

2. Jar of Hot Taco Sauce rather than enchilada (couldn't find it).

3. No water, just extra chicken broth.

4. Added a can of black beans and half a package of taco seasoning.

5. Used raw chicken thighs and they cooked with the soup and I shredded them before we ate it. 

6. Crushed our own store-bought taco's over top instead of making them.

This soup was SOOO good!  My husband kept going back for more and ate 3 bowls.  He said it was one of the best soups he had EVER tasted.  I will DEFINITELY make it again.

Tip:  If you make some of the substitutions I did, leave out the salt.  I added it, but it was a little too salty.

This is super tasty & super easy!  I used frozen chicken breasts, and added all ingredients(except for frozen corn), an cooked on low for about 8 hours.  I then took out the chicken & shredded it, and added the corn.  I added about 2x the fresh cillantro, and a can of rinsed black beans.  Yum!  Instead of making corn tortillas (none on hand...) I just served with crushed tortilla chips, sour cream & shredded cheese.  Good, healthy, low-maintanence & cheap!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is so easy and is sooo good!!  I usually try to follow the recipes as posted, but didn't want to make a special trip to the store, so I just used what I had on hand.  As suggested by other reviews, I threw in the chicken breasts raw and shredded them about an hour before it was done.  I also used two cans of chicken broth and no water.  I didn't have corn or black beans, but I did have a jar of Ortega black bean & corn salsa, which I used in place of the tomatoes and onions.  WOW!  Also added a pinch of cayenne pepper in place of the chilis.  Served with fresh slices of avacado, sour cream and crushed, store bought tortillas!!  Will definitely make this again!!

Two words here: terrific and quick. Made last night in a crock pot - only took about 10 minutes to put it together and let it go on high for about 5 hours. Used a turkey cutlet (a lot cheaper than boneless,skinless chicken breast)and put it in the pot in big chunks and raw. While it cooked the meat took on the flavor of the broth. Used no water - all chick broth. Had some with crushed tortilla chips as the only topping - really good. Later had some with a bit of sour cream, some avocado slices, and crushed tortilla chips for the topping - even better. Try it - you'll like it!

This was a great and easy recipe.  However, it was on the spicy side, but that was my fault.  I used southwestern seasoning on the chicken and accidently used "hot" enchilada sauce.

I doubled the recipe, but omitted the water (it brings nothing to the flavor party). An extra chicken breast added them raw let it go on high for about 4hrs then with a wooden spoon mushed/shredded the chicken. Added one can of black beans and frozen corn at the end. Served with sides for everyone to choose from of cooked rice, refrained beans (just put it in the bottom of the bowl and scoop the soup on top, cheese, hot sauce, diced onions, diced avacados, tomatoes, sour cream, tortilla chips and burrito shells to dip like bread. It is amazing! Froze some in ziplock bags to eats later. Open a ziplock bag put it in a cup fold edges over the lip of the cup. After a couple of scoops squeeze out as much air as possible zip it and let it cool on your counter then freeze.

Well I made this recipe without reading the bad reviews, I made this as written exept used all chicken broth and no water .  I am sorry to say when I tried this I was horrified at the taste and in my panic to fix this I added a little sugar, cream of chicken soup and more chicken stock improved this a little so I added a can of cheddar cheese soup. It is now edible but I would never try this one again

This was quite good!  I didn't have any green chile peppers so I put in some Cajun seasoning to give it a little kick.  The only problem was I was too heavy handed & made it too spicy for my wimpy pallet.  To salvage my blunder I threw in a block of cream cheese.  This made it so yummy!  I will make it again & will include the cream cheese :)

I love these cook all day long meals, and then one was terrific! I took the advice from some of the other commenters and added a can of black beans about 30 minutes before serving. I also used Mission Tortilla Strip chips, instead of making my own, and subd chicken broth for the water. Which was easy as it ended up using the entire 32oz chicken broth box. Added mexican cheese once served and it was delicious!

This was AMAZING...with the mods I made of coarse! I didn't really change much...I used green enchilada sauce and a pinch of sugar in with the 26 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes, used fire roasted green chilis in a can. Added a can of rinsed black beans. Didn't add cilantro to the soup, but instead as a garnish. Also, I used 3 baked chicken thighs, I would have added boneless skinless chicken to the crockpot, but I didn't have any and I didn't want to add the skin and all to the pot and worry about fetching it later so this time I baked em and removed the fat, skin and bones. I also used 2 pkgs of chicken bullion in the pot with the water. I let this cook on high for 4 hours since I added cooked chicken. I would go longer next time with raw chicken. The way to serve this is over some rice to make it more hearty and filling, squeeze some fresh lime juice over the bowl and top with a spoon of sour cream, green onion, cilantro, cheese and tortilla strips...I used bagged tortillas. OMG SOOOOO AWESOME!!!!! Thanks!   I personally think that you should read over reviews and take into count the changes ppl made, it helps make it better, so I never make things as written I always make changes to our liking. Enjoy cooking, I certainly do!!

Very good. I will definitely make again. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot (boneless, skinless chicken thighs) and shredded about 30 minutes prior to eating and put it back in the soup. The thighs work great in the crockpot. The fat melts away and flavors the soup and the meat stays very moist. I used a can of Mexican style diced tomatoes in place of the whole tomatoes and green chilis. Otherwise, I made it just as suggested. Served witha dollop of sour cream.

This didn't go so well for me. It was far too onion-y and the broth was much too thing.

Easy and delicious! As other reviewers, I started with frozen chicken breast (put in Crock-Pot first) and added all the other ingredients as instructed, substituting canned corn for the frozen. (Forgot cilantro, did not have it on hand.) Took up the chicken 1 hr before serving and shredded it in a bowl using 2 forks. One other change: I used Red Enchilada Sauce (recipe on this site, with my changes as specified in my review) in place of the canned enchilada sauce which I discovered had MSG in it (boo!). Served with a dollop of sour cream in the middle and topped with the tortilla strips, and a green salad on the side. Kids loved it. Next time I will add a can of black beans. Super recipe! Thanks!

This was one of the best soups I have ever had!  Not only was it good; but it was healthy as well.  I read some of the reviews and decided to add a can of Black beans, Brown rice, increased the chicken broth to 28 oz, and added water to make up the rest.  It was wonderful....It is a must to add some sour cream and shred some cheese into it.  Even my picky eater loved it.

This is quick & no fuss and full of flavor. I make my own enchilada sauce and chili powder, add my sisters salsa and a can of black beans and pinto beans.  Everyone raves about the aroma it gives off too.  Good enough to eat in 100 degree weather...which is what it is here in LA this week.

I don't know what was going on the day I decided to do this one. First off- I couldn't find enchilada sauce- and I tried to make the sauce based on someone's suggestion in the comments- epic fails. for me this was over spiced, in a bad way. the chicken was okay. just not the soup part.

I made this last nite, and it was a hit with the family!  I made 3 minor changes: added one can drained and rinsed black beans (wanted to stretch the recipe a bit), thickened the broth slightly before serving (we prefer a thicker style soup), and added the cilantro as a garnish on top prior to serving, rather than adding in the beginning.  So nice to walk into the house with the smell of this delicious soup greeting you.  Thank you so much for the definite 'keeper' recipe.

This was very watery..I wish I hadn't added the water to it and what's with all that corn? I added a can of white beans and used rotel instead of plain canned tomatoes...those were the only adjustments I made to this soup..it was a bit spicy, which is o.k. with us but I won't make this again....Sorry

If you live in the Southwest like I do this is just eh... Very BLAH even with additional spices. Might be all right without so much enchilada sauce, and definately without all the corn. I'll stick with my mother's recipe. Won't be making this one again.

This recipe is great and so easy to make. To save time, I used cubed raw chicken instead of cooked shredded chicken. I also used all chicken broth instead of water, omitted the additional salt, and omitted cilatro which I don't like. Hubby requested that I add this one to the rotation!

Very good soup, family loved it. I added a couple of zucchini to give it more substance. I also put the chicken breasts in raw and shredded them when the soup was done. The meat was very tasty and extremly moist. This will become a family favorite.

I came across this on a Sunday afternoon trying to get dinner ideas so I didn't have time to do the slow cooker.  I did it on the stove top and let it simmer for a couple of hours and it turned out great!

Yum Yum, the family loved it!!! My youngest who is 12 likes to add stuff and be creative with food, a future chef.. anyway she put a dollop of sour cream in her soup and it made it nice and creamy, tasted great that way too. I will eat mine like that from now on. The only thing I wish I would have done is to make a double batch!!!!! Oh, I also thought that throwing in some diced avocado might be tasty too.

This is a GREAT recipe.  Great because its so easy to prepare, and because it tastes fantastic.  With that said, after making this recipe a couple times, I tuned a bit to my tastes.  It is a tad watery, isn't spicy enough for me, and could be tad bolder IMO.  So, here's the changes I made.

I use 3 chicken breasts, or about 1 1/2 lbs worth.  Also, I add three fresh diced jalapenos to give it a little kick.  Double the enchilada sauce(my local grocery only carries mild) and use two cans of diced green chiles instead of one.  Instead of adding the two cups of water, I just dump in a second can of chicken broth.  Lastly, I throw in a packet of taco seasoning.  Now we're talking!

I made the recipe, as written, leaving it to slow-cook for for nearly 8 hours. It was OK, but seemed a bit sweet than I like. Reading through the ingredients again, the only thing I can figure is that my corn must have been the culprit, or maybe the enchilada sauce. If I were to make this again, I'd reduce the amount of corn by a third, and use taco seasoning rather than enchilada sauce.

I have made this several times and yes I changed some things. Yes using all chicken broth is better tasting for me and when I don't have any I'll use a few chicken bouillon cubes. U can pretty much add any vegetable and it's still good. I even added hominy one time and it was delicious. To the people commenting about this being terrible and Mexicans don't really do this and that and whatever. These are meant to be easy family friendly recipes. I am from Mexico and I am shocked at the amount of criticism this recipe got from people that say they are living there. Ok you have suggestions great! But there is no need to be mean. Just saying.

This was the best chicken tortilla soup recipe I've tried.  I would use a milder enchilada sauce for my younger two, but my husband, oldest son and I loved it!  I was in a hurry so used two cans of chicken breast from CostCo.  This could easily be a quick stovetop dinner.  I will use this in my weeknight meal repertoire.

AMAZING!!  We thought this was better than any restaurant tortilla soup we have ever tasted!  I basically followed the recipe, but I used 1lb frozen boneless chicken breasts and put them in the crock pot frozen.  I cooked it all for about 6 hours, then took the chicken out, shredded it, and put it back in for another 2 hours.  I also used 2 cans chicken broth and omitted the water.  I cooked 6 servings of brown rice seperately and then added it to the pot for about a half hour at the end.  It made the soup more hearty and perfect for a full meal.  Also, fresh lime juice added to each bowl along with a few strips of tortilla strips (I used Mission tortilla strips instead of making my own), and a dollop of sour cream and a pinch of mexican shredded cheese!  Perfect!!

Really good and really easy.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I added some fresh tomatoes, a few extra cloves of garlic and a can of mild rotel tomatoes.  This soup was so flavorful and heatlhy.

Great flavor soup! I made some modifications as suggested by others - made my own enchilada sauce, used only chicken broth, added frozen chicken breast directly to the crockpot,  added one can of pinto beans (rinsed), doubled the cumi, garlic and chili powder and did not add the cilantro but used it to top the soup.  Because of the "homemade enchilada sauce, the soup was kind of thick, but the flavor was fantastic! Topped with "queso fresco" (did not have sour cream), cilantro and slices of avocado. Although I do not like to make changes to recipes the first time I try them - the changes were a great recommendation. Great soup - so easy to make and so well liked by my crew at home!  Thank you for the recipe Elena! - it has been added to my favorites!

House smelled great all day.  I cut up the chicken and added it raw, since it was going to be cooking all day.  I also added black beans and wanted it a little thicker so I added some corn flour.  Yum!

This recipe is awesome. Before I decide to try a recipe out I always make sure that it has at least 4 stars and then check to see how many reviews there are. At the present time this one has 2,327 reviews and I now know why. I first made this about a month ago and again tonight. I put the slow cooker on low (6 to 61/2 hours). As others mentioned, I also added a can of black beans. Other then that I follow the recipe just as it’s written. Oh, I also use store bought tortilla chips instead of making them.  The smell through the house is sooooo good. This is a keeper and will be a regular on my list of recipes to serve for dinner. 08/07/11 update. When making this soup I now make my own tortilla strips and instead of putting them in the oven I put them in the microwave for one minute twenty three seconds. I also make these as a snack except I will add a little salt and grated parmesan cheese. Took me two trys to get it perfected but it was so worth it.

This is a great recipe that my whole family loves.  At mealtime, we add chopped avocado, fresh cilantro, a bit of cheese and sour cream for creaminess.  I've made this several times and it's always wonderful.  I have subbed a can of tomato sauce w/ increased amounts of cumin and chili powder if I don't have any enchilada sauce on hand.  YUM!

excellent!! I did not cook in crockpot, I cooked in heavy duty pot on stove for 3 hours. Used diced tomatoes instead of whole. Used medium enchilada sauce. Did not use the salt, it has enought on its own. served with tortilla chips, sour cream & shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

First I thought this was a bit bland but after cooking all day and sitting in the fridge over night it was MUCH better! I used less water and added more cumin and chile powder, and also black beans, but did not have a bay leaf. This soup definately gets better each day it sits, as a lot of tomato things do. My intention was to re-create a tortilla soup I had in Mexico and I totally failed...not because it was not tasty it just wasn't the same. When I had my first bowl I was really dissapointed but I think it's b/c I was looking for a specific flavor and did not accomplish it, rather than it not being a good soup. I chose this recipe from reviews that claimed it tasted the most authentic, but unfortunately I do not think this was anywhere close to the taste I got in Mexico. Don't get me wrong this soup does taste great, just not what I was looking for. In Mexico they had avocados and chunks of queso fresco, so of course I had to buy these items. They was great but maybe next time I will skip the expensive cheese (or make my own) and stick to whatever cheese I always have in the fridge. Also do not skimp on making your own tortilla strips, this was one of the best parts and it's probably cheaper too than buying chips. I sprayed mine on both sides and stacked 4 at a time and cut thin with a pizza cutter and baked. Also added fresh cilantro on top (a must!) with a touch of sour cream.

This is very good . . . and super easy!  The only thing I did differently was used purchased white corn tortilla chips instead of making my own as indicated. Great to come home to this tasty and easy meal!  Thanks Elena.

Was a good soup for a cold day.  Made this today on high for about 4.5 hours.  I did not cook the chicken, but instead put the 3 chicken breasts in with everything else and shredded it about 30 minutes before serving.  Next time I'll use diced tomatoes I think.

This shouldn't be as delicious as it is considering how little work goes into it, but I'm going to be eating a LOT of this through the winter. Nicely done!

I have made this many times and shared it. This soup is awesome and easy to make. Everyone loves it.   For all of you haters that whine about the ingredient list calling for canned broth and chilies...the important word is EASY. Some of us have full time jobs and like to be able to throw stuff together quickly. I'm sorry, I love cooking and eating, but I am not wasting my weekend slaving over the stove to make my own enchilada sauce and chicken broth.   While I am sure this recipe would be even better with fresh beans, broth, chilies and all that...it is fine the way it is! Rock on poster and much love to this easy to make and easy to modify recipe!

Really like this soup. It freezes well and tastes great. Made a couple of changes. Used chicken broth instead of water and added black beans.  I serve with extra sharp cheddar cheese and a spoonful of plain greek yogurt (trust me, it's really good and an excellent substitute for sour cream).

This TOTALLY hit the spot on a cold evening... Followed recipe exactly except I just put the chicken pieces in whole, removed & shredded them an hour or so before it was done, then returned them to the cooker... came out fantastic, the whole family loved it! ........I have made this 3 more times since the first review and has been a hit every time! A must try for any soup lover!..... Also, I was having company over and wanted to make it stretch a little farther so I added a can of black beans, turned out fabulous too!

Tried this recipe about 6 months ago and I love it. I made only a few changes since I like to stay true to the original recipe and have made it the same way every time. I pressure cook a whole chicken for about 45 minutes.  I use the chicken broth from the cooked chicken.  I think pressure cooking a whole chicken gives you a tastier broth. While the chicken cooks I measure out all the other ingredients and chop the onion. I use 1 (15 0unce)can crushed tomatoes and I leave out the green chile peppers. I add the rinsed black beans as another cook recommended. I measure out about 4 cups of chicken broth to equal the water and broth amounts found in the recipe and place in a large pot. While these ingredients are simmering I debone and shread the cooked chicken and add one pound of the chicken to the soup. I let it simmer a little while longer and it is ready. I like the way the added black beans add color to the soup.

This was pretty good...but I did make some adjustments.  I added a can of black beans and used homemade enchilada sauce (Red Enchilada Sauce from this site).  I cooked the chicken in the soup (great idea, everyone!) which worked out great...but I wish there had been more chicken for the amount of broth. I added a few ounces of cubed Velveeta in the last 30 minutes, and instead of the tortillas, we just ate it with Cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.  I'll make again, just using at least 5 chicken breasts.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I love to cook, but being a mom doesn't always allow time to cook a wholesome supper.  I tossed everything into my slow cooker (even chicken which was frozen into one big rock)and left it all day.  When I got home I took the chicken out and gave it a rough chop (my husband needs to see big pieces of meat or he thinks it's not a meal)  and made some corn bread instead of tortilla chips to put in the bowls.  Let's just say there's only 4 of us and there was none left for lunch the next day :).  I will certainly use this recipe again and again!

My husband loves this soup at our favorite Mexican restaurant and looks for it at others.  I made this for him as a treat and he loved it.  In fact, he said it was better than at his favorite restaurant (but, he is a charmer!)and less spicy, which is more appealing to him.  I didn't have shredded chicken ready, so I put partially defrosted chicken breasts in the pot and shredded it towards the end.  Adding fresh cilantro, however, in the beginning is a waste as you lose the fresh, piquant flavor.  I recommend adding that towards the end.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

I made this tonight and my husband thought it was awesome.  I used frozen chicken breasts and they just fell apart at the end of the cooking. I also used rotel tomoatoes with green chiles instead of the whole tomatoes and can of green chiles.  It was pretty spicy, but I added some sour cream, it came out perfect.  Also used store bought tortilla strips instead of making my own.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe!

FABULOUS! I loved this soup and it could not be easier. I threw everything in the crock pot in about 10 mins. and let it cook all day. I put the chicken breasts in whole, shredded them up about 30 mins. before it was done, and then dumped them back in the soup. I also added some frozen corn and a can of kidney beans. I wanted to use black beans, but didn't have any on hand. My husband is not a big soup fan, but he raved about this soup. It's thick and hearty enough to be considered a good meal. I will be cooking this one a lot this winter.

Very good.  The only thing I changed was adding 2 cans of chicken broth instead of water.  I threw the chicken breasts in frozen.  It was perfectly done when I came home from work.  Very tasty-- I will definitely make again.

Really easy and a big hit, who could ask for more? Thank you to the reviewers that suggested putting in the uncooked chicken right at the beginning, and to use all chicken broth (no water). I accidently used a can of enchilada sauce twice the size called for, but will do the same next time because it turned out so good.

I would rate this a 5 but I think I like Chicken Taco Soup (from allrecipes.com) more and it's even easier to make than this recipe.  Otherwise, this was a tasty meal.  Check out the other recipe for ease and taste.

Excellent!  I took the advice of others and added the uncooked chicken at the beginning and then shredded it.  It turned out perfect!  I didn't bother with the chips, just added sour cream.  Also, I didn't think this was spicy and I made it exactly as recipe stated.  I used a mild enchilada sauce instead of hot. Maybe that's why.  I know some reviewers said it was too spicy.

Wow! I just don't agree with everyone else. I found this soup to be bland and unimpressive. I felt the need to add more cumin and some italian seasoning just to give it some more flavour.  Tonight, I think I will add some sour cream as per other suggestions to see if that gives it some oomph. I did add skinned, raw drumsticks instead of cooked chicken - the meat was nice & moist.  But even having the bones in there did not offer enough depth.  Not a keeper for me...

This was so easy to make and very delicious. I think next time I will add some beans to make the soup heartier. My husband, who isn't a soup kind of guy, loved it! I will definitely make this again soon :)

This was very hot and spicy, way too spicy for us.  However, if you like that, this is a great recipe for you!  I even omitted the can of green chile peppers and just used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, instead of a can of whole peeled tomatoes.  Maybe it was the enchilada sauce (used a 12 oz. jar from Trader Joe's).  We had to add sour cream, and that didnt' help enough, so we added some half and half to cool it down.  The baked tortilla strips were a nice touch though, and I will do that again for other soup recipes!  I'm rating it a 4 because it's not a bad recipe, just too spicy for us.

First, I will say this is easy. I always take the 5 minutes to season the meat prior to cooking. In this case I season cut up ( bite size)boneless skinless chicken thighs with 1/2t.to 1t. each. Cumin, Garlic Powder, Oregano and chili powder. I took 15 more minutes to brown the meat in some oil. Onions and fresh peppers, and garlic can be browned in the last few minutes.

This is the ONLY tortilla soup recipe I will make. I never even liked tortilla soup until this recipe, now ALL my friends and family request it! I make only minor changes, like I use petite diced tomatoes and add a can of Ranch Style beans (OMG)! Also I use a small can of red and a small can of green enchilada sauce. Sometimes I serve it over a scoop of Mexican rice. YUM! Top it off with fresh ripe avo's, cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips and you will be the happiest person on the planet! Thanks for sharing!

Our whole family loved this soup.  Only changes I made were to sub Rotel for the tomatoes and green chiles, add black beans, and use all chicken broth instead of water.  I also put the chicken breasts in raw and shredded them at the end.  Only complaint is that it didnt make enough.  We have a family of 4 and we each had a bowl and there were no leftovers.  If you want leftovers or have a larger family, you may want to consider doubling.

I used this recipe as a "base" to clean out some pantry items.  Great results for my first try at tortilla soup!  It made me think of Boston Market's tortilla soup, which I haven't had in years.  I used can corn instead of frozen.  I did not have canned tomatoes on hand, but subbed in three fresh, peeled tomatoes.  I "made" enchilada sauce out of a can of mild Rotel tomatoes, red pepper flakes, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and canola oil, which I blended down in a 2 cup measuring cup using an immersion blender.  I added the suggested can of black beans mentioned by other reviewers (another pantry item utilized!).  Also, I did not want to use 1/2 of a 32 ounce container of broth, so I used the whole container to boil my chicken breasts, pouring all of the liquid into the slow cooker and omitting the 2 cups water.  We served it with tortilla chips from Costco that we had on hand.  And, I didn't have a bay leaf or cilantro, but it still came out great.  It really helped me knock out a few extras I had laying around with tremendous results.

This was a five star recipe for me!  I made as directed but did not precook the chicken, omitted the 2 cups of water and used 2 cans of chicken broth which I precooked and had on hand, also omitted the corn, torilla's and the black beans I wanted to add to cut down on the carbs... and VOILA!! Low Carb Chicken Tortilla Soup!  I really like the fact that this did not call for a can of Campbells soup as they are so salty.  Loved this recipe!  Thank you!

Omit the water, instead add a 1/4 cup of salsa. Double the spices. Add rice and beans. Top each serving with sour cream and cheese. Good soup, just little thin and bland as is.

i think that this is a good slow cooker recipe but i did alter it a bit, taking some cues from a few reviews.  i wanted more heat so i diced both a jalapeno and serrano pepper.  I also used 2 cups chix broth and 1 cup water and added the juice from a whole lime.  after cooking for 5.5 hours on high i thought there was too much broth so i added a can of pinto beans with jalapeno peppers and cooked for another 1.5 hours.  

i get that there are no beans in tortilla soup and i also get that making a traditional soup in this quick-style manner is not authentic.  BUT this is a slow cooker recipe, geared for simple, delicious quick meals.  the beans seemed to be the key to bulking this recipe up a bit and it was delicious!

we baked a few white corn tortillas brushed lightly with olive oil and salt, serving two on the side. topped with a bit of plain yogurt, this will now be a go to meal in the future!  Thanks for this!

I've made this recipe at least 20 times in the past year for just my family and for company.  It's always a huge hit.  I've shared the recipe many times.  I use broth instead of water, and throw frozen chicken breasts in, and just shread them an hour before serving with a fork.  We eat it with sour cream and premade tortilla chips.  Yummy!

This was a great cheater recipe.  But why waste money on chicken breasts? I used the leftover carcass from the Allrecipes "Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style" which I had marinated overnight in the spices for that recipe.  I cooked the carcass alone for an hour so that all the meat fell off, and then proceeded with the recipe for the tortilla soup.  Like others, I used a bag of tortilla chips, a can of black beans, and a can of corn. I also added a can of garbanzo beans since I had a lot of soup.  I served with lime wedges, chopped cilantro, avocado and sour cream and everyone had fun dressing their bowls.

I really enjoyed this and will make again soon.  I, too, cooked my chicken in the soup and used all chicken broth instead of water.  I used Hatch brand enchilada sauce and, also, Hatch chiles.  I didn't make my own tortilla strips, but, instead used the wonderful brand at my local market, Harbor Greens.  They are thin and crispy and I used the "chilepeno" flavor - perfect as a topping with my soup.  When I made this I didn't have corn on hand, but next time plan to add roasted corn.  Also, I'm going to try another reviewer's suggestion of cooking black beans in the soup instead of using canned.  Because I like my food spicy, I did increase, probably doubled, the cumin and chili powder and then added ground cayenne as well. :)  The only problem I had was that it was so good I didn't have enough left for the freezer.

Mmmm.... yummm!  I made a little different based on what I had on hand.  I used 1 can tomatoe sauce and 2 diced fresh tomatoes in place of the whole canned tomatoes.  I also seeded and diced 2 fresh jalapenoes instead of canned chillies.  Skipped the chicken broth (to eliminate sodium) and just used 2 extra cups water.  I increased cumin to 1 tbs, added 1 cup dry black beans and 1 cup frozen corn.  Per 1 reviewer I added 2 sliced corn tortillas at the beginning to add some tortilla taste and to thicken.  I put the chicken in raw and shredded after 3 1/2 hrs, then let it cook for another 3 1/2 hours till the beans were done.  The enchillada sauce blended well and gave a great flavor.  Some reviewers said theirs turned out thin and watery, but mine was thick and hearty.  I think the tortillas helped and adding dry beans probably soaked up some extra juice.  I squeezed the juice of 1 lime into the pot before serving and garnished each bowl with fresh avocado and a bit of sour cream.  Definately make your own tortilla strips.  This was oh so good.  I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch.

I've made this about 5 times now and my family has begun to request it so figure I have enough experience with this soup to honestly review it.

One of the tastiest and easiest soups to make. No, you don't need a slow cooker but it does help to meld the flavors when you use one. Yes, you can begin with raw boneless, skinless breasts or use leftover chicken. Sometimes I begin with raw breasts in the slow cooker and then throw in leftover baked chicken towards the end. Depends on what I have on hand. The recipe is very flexible and forgiving.

It's the enchilada sauce that makes this recipe so don't forget it or it won't taste the same. I use diced tomatoes that include the green chili's and don't add additional chili's as we aren't into really spicy stuff. I include the cilantro but reserve the most cilantro to put fresh on top each bowl. I also add chopped avocado to my personal bowl. My son likes grated cheese on his. Sometime I include a spoon of sour cream in mine. The basic soup is fantastic and each bowl can be personalized with additions. OH, the LIME, must have a squirt of LIME in each bowl as that really brightens the flavor. 

As for the tortilla, just use your favorite tortilla chip. Much easier and tastes great. 

I made a double recipe of this last night. It's gone today as my gang not only ate it for dinner - they finished it for lunch.

Good recipe, I always appreciate new slow cooker options for my hectic work schedule.  I threw the chicken breasts in frozen & let them simmer all day on low, and shredded the chicken right before serving.  So tender, it just fell apart.

Wow.  Just wow.  This is such an amazing recipe.  The only things I did differently were:
- used boneless, skinless, chicken thighs cooked in the soup (I HIGHLY recommend this.  The dark  meat really works well in this soup.)
- Used cayenne pepper as opposed to chili powder
- omitted the 2 cups of water (not enough space in my slow cooker and I am glad there wasn't.)
- used a bit more garlic (I love the stuff).

The soup is so simple, yet rich in flavor.  This recipe is going to be a new cold weather staple in my house.

I have made this soup several times and it has always turned out delicious!  So easy.  Like other reviewers, I added raw chicken breasts in at the beginning and about an hour before serving, I take them out, shred them and add back in.  So good, especially with a splash of lime juice and a sprinkle of Cheddar cheese.

Delicious!! My husband asked me to make this again & again....I think adding the black beans will make this a 5 star recipe....I will try that and maybe add some brown rice too.  I did add extra tomatos (stewed) and used chicken broth in place of the water.  Topped off with avocado, mexican cheese and greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it healthier. Easy & perfect for a cold day!
UPDATE! 5 STAR RECIPE because I added 1-2 cans of black beans & it really makes this recipe even better. I have made this several times now...added some cayenne pepper to spice it up even more...yum.

I thought this recipe was great.  I made it on the stove top in a large pot.  I read the reviews so I was aware of the "too much liquid" issue some of the other cooks were having.  Had to agree.  I just simply reduced the water.  I also added a can of black beans and since I love tomatoes, I added twice the amount (used Rotel).  Boyfriend tried to take some to work to share - NOT A CHANCE, I said!  Thank you for such a great tasting recipe.

Very good.  I definitely recommend adding beans (black or white or both).  Cook breasts in crock and shred 30-60 minutes before soup is finished.  Great heated for leftovers.  I'll make this again!

Yumm-o!  I made it as written and it was very good.  I will change it only slightly next time I make it.  First, I used mild enchilada sauce and mild green chilis just to see how it would turn out.  I will slowly ramp up the heat by picking either hot sauce or hot chilis next time.  Also, I love black beans in my tortilla soup so I will add some next time.  I may cut back a bit on the corn, maybe use half a bag.  It was pretty corn-y.  Also, I plan to use diced or pureed tomatoes next time rather than waste time crushing the whole ones.  I made my life easy by using a store bought rotisserie chicken picked over for the meat.  I topped with sour cream and used bagged tortilla chips instead of homemade, and it was delicious.

I dont like when you read a "5 star" review with enough alterations to make your head spin. I made this recipe exactly as is only subbing chicken broth for the water and adding corn and black beans just because I like them. This is a very simple "dump and go" recipe. Super easy and very tasty.

This recipe was pretty good. I used all of the ingredients called for. Instead of using a can of whole tomatoes and a can of green chilies, I decided to substitute with a can of crushed tomatoes with green chilies (Rotel). I also made homemade chicken broth by boiling the chicken before shredding. I didn't add any water. I added additional garlic, and about 1 tablespoon of lime juice. Topped with sour cream and cheese and regular tortilla chips. Yummy. Next time will add beans. I cooked it on the stove top for 2 hours. Edit: I made this again with the addition of white northern beans and an additional can of crushed tomatoes, that with the lime, put it over the top!

A hearty soup that doesn't require a side dish. I add a can of low-sodium black beans to help round it out, and I recommend using a plain low-carb wrap sliced and sprinkled with sea salt and lime juice in place of the tortilla strips. We've had this once a month for almost 2 years now!

This is really good.  I omitted the 2 cups of water tomake it thicker and added some black beans.

Very simple and quick!  I threw it all in the crockpot (raw chicken included!), added black beans, extra broth in place of the water, and omitted the salt.  Tasty!

Great!  I threw 2 BLSL breasts in frozen and just pulled them out and shredded them near the end.  Worked great!  I also used the enchilada sauce that you mix with tomato sauce and water since that's where most of the flavor comes from and I know we like it.  It made 16oz instead of 10 or 14 so I just reduced the water in the recipe to make up for the extra liquid.  Also the corn came in a 16oz bag so I went ahead and threw it all in.  I will make this often.

Excellent soup and very easy. I always leave out the corn and sometimes add black beans in their place. I like to add chopped jalapeno for some kick.

Perfect!  This is my favorite soup recipe of all time!  I recently had tortilla soup at a well-known restaurant and it wasn't nearly as good as I make at home with this recipe!  I sometimes double the recipe and use one can each of mild and hot enchilada sauce for more heat.  I do not add cilantro (not a big fan) and I certainly don't make my own tortilla chips. I simply use bagged chips.  Yummmo!!!

I brought this to a company gathering and it was devoured. Instead of using the canned enchilada sauce I followed another reviewers advice and boiled a few dried ancho chiles in water for about 30 minutes. After they were done I removed the stems and seeds and put them with some tomato sauce in a food processor. This was way better then the canned stuff. I also added a can of black beans, some lime juice and heap of fresh cilantro and parsley (love my spices). Topped each bowl with sharp cheddar, sour cream and crushed blue corn tortilla chips - YUM.

I made a doulble recipe and used a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes, Kroger Private Selection Roasted Enchilda Sauce, one tablelspoon of chili in adobe sauce, 4 chopped Jalopenos instead of green chilies. I increased the chilie power and cumin to one tablespoon. I used 4 whole chicken breasts and shredded after 4 hours and cooked one more hour on low and added 2 cans of black beans. 

I served with low fat shredded mexican cheese, low fat sour cream, and bite size tostidos. 

I brought it to a wedding shower and everyone loved it. There was not much left at the end.  I made chicken nachos with the left overs the next day.

What a delicious, easy recipe!!  I didn't pre-cook the chicken and I added the juice of 1 lime.  It turned out really nice and light and was packed with flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

This was fabulous! The flavors! I used 1 can of beans instead of corn, hot enchilada sauce, cooked 2 Tysons garlic/wine chicken breasts with soup and added one hot turkey sausage link (crumbled after cooked in soup), added an additional can of tomatoes with chiles, added a few jarred jalepeno slices, halved the salt as my additions included salted items, and used one chicken bouillon in place of broth and 2.5 cups of water. These changes were personal preferences (we like a kick!) and after reading some reviews - I would have not known where to begin without this great recipe!

Deliciously amazing soup!  Easy to make.  I made only 2 modifications: 1.  I put 3 uncooked chicken breasts in with everything and shredded it about 1/2 hour before serving. 2.  I used all chicken broth (no water).

I think I forgot to put the water in, but no worries, it was perfectly tasty and soupy anyway. I threw the chicken in pieces raw and it cooked up in 4 1/2 hours no problem. We had it with cheese, lime, sour cream, avocado and cilantro on top. BF said it was "good" which is what he says about EVERYTHING. What it really means is "make this again a few hundred times, I'll eat it every time".  thanks!

This was very good; however, I personally wasn't AS crazy about the broth as I could have been (but still very good!).  Everyone in the family loved it though and would rate it a 5 otherwise.

Excellent soup! I've made this a couple of times and it always turns out great. I don't pre-cook the chicken, I used boneless/skinnless breasts (2-3 depending on size) then I remove them & shred the meat right before serving. I have also added a can of black beans, rinsed & drained and that was good too. Don't use pre-packaged chips for the garnish! The tortillas are worth a bit of work--just make a few extras. My son & his friends at a lot of them while waiting for the soup to finish.  I sprayed the strips lightly with cooking spray then sprinkled them w/cumin & chili powder before baking. Perfect!

Have made this recipe a couple times. The first time exactly as written. I felt it was missing something. The second time I made these changes. I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes (great taste), used spicy enchilada sauce and left out the green chilis. I added chicken stock for the water and doubled the cumin. I added chicken breast to the top of the mixture and cooked on high. The last hour, I removed the chicken breasts and shredded them with forks and returned to the cooker. I also added 1/2 of a lime squeezed and 2 TBLS of MASA (corn flour) mixed w/ 1/2 cup water to thicken and to add the cornny taste it's missing. I serve w/ grated sharp cheese and tortilla chips.

This was a fabulous slow cooker recipe--restaurant quality (or better!)  My whole family loved it and we all took it for lunch the next day.  I shredded a deli chicken which made the prep even easier.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  The sour cream and corn chips were a nice touch when serving.

This soup was fantastic! All my husband could say was "This is SO good" over and over. I love how easy it was to prepare and it smelled very good all day. As another reviewer recommended, I put in frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts and shredded them when they were cooked. Instead of using water and chicken broth, I only used chicken broth. Towards the end of the cooking time I tasted it and it had a little bit of a bitter taste. I know that this is not a "traditional" ingredient in  tortilla soup, but I didn't want the bitterness, so I added about a cup of chopped carrots and that took care of it and it was perfect. I still can't figure out why it had that taste to it, maybe it is supposed to? When I served it, I garnished with lime, fresh cilantro, chopped avocado, shredded cheddar and tortilla chips. I am going to recommend this recipe to everyone!! Thanks for sharing it :)

Thank you so much for sharing!!  This soup is wonderful!!  I didn't have a can of peeled tomatoes, so I used Rotel tomatoes. I used a carton of chicken broth and no water.  I didn't have the Enchilada sauce, either.  I put 4 chicken thighs in and cooked with the soup. I will definitely make again and again!

We loved this soup, but before serving, added about 1/4 C cream cheese and a handful ofcorn starch to thicken it JUST a bit.  Also, added hot sauce (Frank's), onion powder and a pinch of cayenne to our taste, for a little more heat.  Topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream before the tortilla strips.  It was fabulous!  Definitely a "keeper"!

maybe I'm just not a chicken tortilla soup person, but I found this recipe to taste liked spiced water with chicken and corn. There was no depth to it. I made the recipe exactly as written. No one in my family thought it was that great. Probably will not make again. Too bad because I really wanted to enjoy this recipe.

I made this yesterday.  Didn't have frozen corn so I used fresh and used green enchilada sauce because that's what I had in the house. I also used 2 large frozen boneless chicken breasts. As soon as the chicken was "shreddable" I did and let it soak in the soup until we were ready to eat.  Didn't have tortilla's so I used french bread and topped the soup with sour cream. The soup had a sweet taste from the sweet corn. Not a bad thing but if you don't like a little sweetness, use regular frozen or canned corn.  Tried this recipe again with regular enchilada sauce,3 chicken breasts and added a can of red beans. Both versions were 5 stars but we preferred the green enchilda sauce.

Very good recipe!  I gave it 4 stars cause I tweaked a little, but it is a 5 star recipe.  I used green chilie enchilada sauce instead of the regular enchilada sauce.  I also added black beans, but not the canned kind.  They tend to get mushy and nasty.  So I used the kind from a bag.  I put everthing in the crock pot the night before and added the beans.  As a way to "soak" overnight.  The beans were a good addition.  Came out good.  We topped with fresh cilantro and squeezed lime juice on top with sour cream, cheese and baked tortillas!  Wonderful!  It would have been even better if had fresh avacado.

cooked chicken in all broth (no water) for extra flavor.  I love cumin so doubled the amount.  First time to make tortilla soup and loved it.  Thank you for taking the time to put this online!

WOWWWWWWWW!!!!!  A Keeper recipe for my family.  I added an extra can of whole tomatoes.  Instead of the 2 cups water, I used chicken broth.  Also cooked a package of "Knoll" brand Mexican rice and put that in the crock pot too with everything else (someone else added the Knoll Spanish Rice - did not have that on hand - the Mexican Rice worked out great).  Added another can of chicken broth about 1/2 hour before serving, because there didn't seem to be enough broth.  Topped with grated Montery Jack cheese.  TERRIFIC Recipe!  Thank you!

This is a GREAT recipe. Lots and flavor and so delicious! I've found it a good way to use leftover rotisserie chicken - this adds even more great flavor to an already amazing soup.

My daughter made this over the weekend and we had it Tuesday night for dinner.  It was the perfect recipe for a novice cook.  She used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked on High for 4 hours.  Delicious!

Fantastic!!!  I modified like others did: added 1 can black bean soup, used all chicken broth.  Added a little more chili powder.  I threw a couple frozen whole chicken breasts in the crockpot in the beginning.  I waited until about 30 minutes before serving and pulled them out to shred. They were so tender they fell apart.  Great with fresh squeezed lime--everyone loved this and next time I will make a double batch!

YUM! That's all I can say. This is a very easy, but very tasty slow cooker soup. You can make it as spicy as you want or as mild as you want. Add toppings or not. We use canned Rotel HOT tomatos in this as well as canned chiles...I omit the water and have always used canned corn...comes out just fine. My hubby likes to put this on top of tortilla chips, top it with sour cream, onions and cheese.  I only use low fat sour cream and a bit of cheese and onion. Very healthy... FIVE BIG STARS ON THIS ONE! :) BTW- It may be cheaper to buy a rotissiere chicken from the grocery store and shred it as opposed to buying a pound of chicken breasts. :)

This was even better than I could have hoped! I will definitely make this again and again. Spicy, but not painfully so. I followed the advice of other reviewers: used raw chicken that I broke up with two forks about an hour before serving; used additional chicken broth in place of the water; added a can of rinsed and drained black beans; and used pre-made chips from a bag.

This was really good.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used some salsa - one of those expensive fresh ones - about 3/4 cup.  The salsa had fresh parsley and cilantro.  

I used tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes, and added 1 can of black beans on the advice of another reviewer.  

Leftovers are delicious.

This soup was absolutley delicious! As other reviewers suggested, I added 1 can of rinsed black beans, used all chicken broth, and put in 3 uncooked chicken breasts which I shredded about an hour before serving - so tender and yummy! The whole house smelled terrific- I think the fresh cilantro really makes a difference too.  We served with shredded cheddar, sour cream, and store bought corn tortillas. My hubby and I gobbled it up and are looking forward to having the leftovers tonight!

This got a thumbs up from both my husband and 14yo daughter.  They are both VERY picky eaters.  My husband doesn't care for soup or Mexican food, but he told me at least 3 times how good it was.  I also added a can of black beans and used all chicken broth as several others had suggested.  I added 5 (uncooked) boneless, skinless chicken thighs and about an hour before it was dinner time, took them out and shreaded them.  Then other changes I made are that I added about 1/3 cup of salsa and about 1/3 cup of FINELY crushed tortilla chips half way thru cook time.  Adding the crushed tortilla chips kinda made it thicken up a little bit (learned it on The Food Networks "How to Boil Water" show)  SUPER SUPER GOOD!

This is easy and good. I do not put it in the slow cooker though. I have always made it just in a pot on the stove and it takes about an hour. I serve it in bowls with a dollop of sour cream. Great!

GOOD RECIPE with some advice from other reviews plus some of my own: Frozen Chicken breasts shredded when cooked, 1 bottle beer (no extra water or chicken broth), 2 TBS chicken boulion, canned diced tomatos with mild green chilis, no extra chilis, 1 can black beans drained and rinsed. Tortilla strips were not worth the extra work, the store bought ones would have been easier and taste better. Froze extras and were even better the second time around after the flavors melded. DO NOT FORGET TO ADD THE FRESH LIME JUICE, it makes the dish! 
****UPDATE****
I now make this soup overnight and let it sit in the fridge all day and let the flavors meld and it is the BEST!

OH MY GOD!  This soup was the best soup EVER!  And so simple to make!!   I love spicy so used all spices as instructed added some chopped jalapenos and crushed red pepper.  Also followed the advice of some reviewers and used extra chicken broth instead of water, added left-over brown rice, and corn tortillas to the soup while cooking.  I used raw chicken breast and shredded it about 15 minutes before serving.  Baking the tortillas was a nice touch! This is 1000% better than what you pay for in a restaurant!

This recipe was *wonderful*!  My husband raved about it again and again and the leftovers were gone in a flash.  This will be a definite addition to my permanent recipe collection.  I did add a can of black beans; also I used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies instead of plain tomatoes.  I used all chicken broth instead of water/chicken broth and garnished the soup with sour cream before serving.  Heavenly!!!

I found this soup to be a little bland, but once I added some salsa, more chili powder, more cilantro, and black beans it was very good.  This was nice and filling on a chilly fall day.  I will make this again.

I was rather disappointed in the final product of this recipe. After tasting the liquid before starting the slow cooker, and smelling the wonderful aroma all day, I was very eager for dinner that night. I was so disappointed to find a bland soup in my bowl! My family liked it, though, and I do plan to make it again. But I believe I'll just simmer it on the stovetop long enough to heat through rather than slow-cooking it next time. All that flavor must have escaped at some point during the afternoon, and I won't give it the chance again.

Someone had a question about a side dish. I made some corn bread and it went well with it. I would have liked to make the jalepeno corn bread I get from Trader Joe's, but they were out at the time. Just a suggestion.

It was really yummy.  My husband even liked it.  I cooked it all day while I was at work, and came home.  We ate about half of it, maybe?  And then I added half a cup of rice and let that cook on low for another two hours or so, and it made a great lunch for days to come.  (My husband actually said he liked it better after the flavors had married and with the rice.  He didn't come up with flavors marrying, that was my interpretation.)  Excellent.

I have to add my 2 cents!!!  This soup was amazing!!!!  Only change was that I doubled it and added 3 lb. chicken because we are a family of carnivours.  Had a small kick to it but not enough that the kids thought it too hot.  Will definitely add this recipe to the regulars, especially in the winter as it gets colder - a good rib sticker!!!!

This was delicious.  I just put the chicken in raw into the crockpot.  1 large whole breast seemed like plenty.  Then right before we ate, I took the chicken out and shredded it.  Yum!  I also added a can of black beans, used chicken broth rather than water, and added no extra salt.  What an easy and yummy meal to come home to!

Delicious!  I just threw 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts into the crockpot.  About an hour before serving, I took the chicken out, shredded it, and returned it to the soup.  This was great.  I forgot to make the tortillas so we used store-bought chips.  I'll try the tortillas tonight when we have leftovers.  Thanks!

I did not do this recipe in a slow cooker - I did it quick on the stove and it turned out great!  I will have to do it the slow way some time!  I topped it off with a dallop of sour cream which I thought really made it yummy!  I served it with the avacado slices on the side and slices of cheese which made it quite pretty when I served it up!  I added an extra can of chicken broth because I felt it was a bit chunky for soup...and that worked great!  It was spicey and delicious!

Yum - made this for dinner tonight and had to sneak a taste for lunch. Excellent! I also used Rotel Festiva tomatoes (w/lime & cilantro) and added black beans w/jalapenos and a can of pinto beans. Used the water I parboiled the chicken in and dumped everything in crockpot to simmer for an hour or 2 on low since chicken is cooked.  It's terrific and I'm not much of a "spicy" food person!

This recipe was excellent, even my kids liked it! I used cooked chicken, not because of personal preference, just because I had a lot left over (good to know that raw chicken works well too). I assembled the soup in a ziploc bag, then froze it for about two weeks. This soup is a great "freezer meal" because the ingredients hold up well. I defrosted the bag, then put in in the crock pot on high for 2 hours.

Oh yum! We have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. Only thing I changed was I used 1 can of RO*TEL diced tomatoes with lime juice & cilantro and 1 can of RO*TEL Original diced tomatoes with green chiles. I omitted the 4 oz. green chiles. I didn't make the tortilla chips, instead I cheated & used Fresh Gourmet's new salted tortilla strips. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent flavors, not too spicy at all.  It is only watery if you don't use some type of tortilla addition. It did need a bit more dimension in the ingredients. I crumbled store-bought tortilla chips and sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese to make the soup heartier. I added black beans for a third dimension in taste and presentation.

I didn't use as much water as called for, cut down to about 1 1/4 cups.  Soup came out delicious.  Hubby even liked it, and he's not a big mexican food fan.

This was just what I was looking for! No more having to go out for tortilla soup for me! I didn't add the chopped green chile peppers because the kids don't like super spicy food and left out the cilantro because I can't stand it. I was also out of chicken broth, but I boiled the chicken breasts and added a chicken bouillion cube to the remaining water and used that. Also, instead of baking the tortillas, I used tortilla chips instead. The soup turned out FANTASTIC! Both the kids like it. Too bad Dad was in LA and couldn't enjoy. Oh well, there's always leftovers!

My kids absolutely loved this!  My 10 year old, who does not like another version that I make, gave this 5 stars.  My picky 5 year old said he would give it 10 stars!  I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception (and only because I didn't have them) of the tomatoes.  I added a large can of crushed tomatoes.  I also added, at the suggestion of my kids, a large can of whole pinto beans.  They loved it.  I gave them tortilla chips which they used as a scoop for all of the great stuff in here.  For myself, to cut down on the calories and fat, I tore a corn tortilla into pieces and put those into the soup.  Yumm!!  It tasted so authentic.  Thanks for the post!

Fantastic! I added one fresh, sliced carrot and used "hot" enchilada sauce with "mild" green chilis and it was the perfect amount of spice. I also added sliced avocado & sour cream just before serving. I brought this to work and every person that tried it took the recipe home. I grew up in Texas where tortilla soup can be found everywhere and this one is the real thing. YUM!

Muy bien! :-) My husband had never tried tortilla soup before and went back for seconds! I used a can of corn (juice and all) instead of frozen corn, and I added a can of Mexican Festival Rotel for added spice & flavor. I also used fully cooked, seasoned, shredded chicken (12 oz.) from the grocery store instead of cooking the chicken myself which saved a lot of prep time. We topped with the tortilla strips (I used red corn tortillas for color) and Mexican blend shredded cheese. It was definitely spicy, but we like it like that. This will be added to my list of perfect foods for a cold day! Thanks Elena! :-)

Absolutely amazing. I made it with very few adjustments. I used homemade chicken broth instead of canned and used twice the amount and only 1 cup of water. I also used homemade stewed tomatoes (which I chopped). I added some black beans, too (my family loves them). I threw the chicken in the pot whole and left it all day on low, pulled it out and shredded it when I got home, added it back in with some cilantro (I used a lot of cilantro - we really like it - about 1/4 of a cup). Gave it a good stir, got the bowls out and served it with a good squeeze of lime (a MUST! Do not skip. I know for Americans this sounds strange, but you will LOVE it.), and little shredded cheese on top (personal preference), a small dollop of sour cream for some of us. My family adds crunched tortilla chips, but I like it without them. This is really amazing soup and so easy to make.

This is another recipe to add to my binder.  I like how it's a slow cooker recipe however, since I had to doubled the ingredients to accommodate 16 servings, I prepared this on the stove (My large slow cooker wasn't big enough.)  The only thing I changed is that I didn't pre-cook the chicken...it really isn't necessary to do that whether you use the slow cooker or stove.  Just place the raw chicken in when you put everything else and when your ready to eat just shred the chicken and add it back into the pot. I didn't add the corn until I was ready to simmer the soup (added corn, brought the soup back to boil, then simmered for 40 minutes).  I used boneless skinless Chicken thighs.  This soup is a bit zippy but not terribly.  However, if you have zero tolerance to spiciness then you may want to adjust the recipe accordingly.

This was a great soup.  I did make a few changes though.  I used raw chicken breasts which I think is crucial in getting the meat tender.  I wouldn't use pre-cooked.  I shredded the chicken after about 3 1/2 hours and then put the meat back in.  I also used only 1 cup of water, but an extra cup of chicken broth (low sodium).  Next time I'll probably only use the broth and no water.  I didn't have enchilada sauce on hand so I used a can of thick salsa (smooth, not chunky).  I also added some celery and diced red bell pepper.  Additionally, based on other reviews, I added a can of black beans.  When I served the soup I topped it with shredded Mexican blend cheese and avocado and warmed up some corn tortillas to eat with it.  Delicious!  My husband has been sick and said it was just what the doctor ordered :)

During the worst winter the Midwest has had in many years, my thoughts were "Time goes so fast and it will be spring before we know it. But in the mean time make some soup!" I found this recipe and was everyone's hero. I tweaked it just a little....I had boneless chicken breast that I cut in bite-size pieces and seasoned and browned in a skillet. I added the chicken broth to the pan to catch all the browned bits and then poured in the crockpot.I didn't have the canned chilis so used a can of Rotel tomatoes. I added a can of drained rinsed black beans. Didn't have tortillas so used tortilla chips. Served w/ avocado,cilantro and cheese. Yummy!!!!

I concur with others-- it works great with cut-up raw chicken, then take two forks to shred it. I also added rinsed black beans, chopped green pepper, doubled the garlic, and used all chicken stock (apprx 1 qt.) no water. Sprinkled with some broken-up bagged tortilla chips, shredded cheese and dollop of sour cream. Also, added some dashes of hot sauce for a kick. Hubby loved it, too. Definitely a keeper!!

This one checks all the boxes. Easy. Spicy with heat but not blistering hot. I like some others added a can of black beans,for the corn I added canned white shoe-peg corn with chipotle pepper, red pepper and onion, I also used chicken broth for the water. I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. Instead of chicken I added the leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Great soup that can easily be tweaked to suit individual taste. I will add this to my list of regular recipes. Thanks!

This recipe looks like trouble with a lot of ingredients but don't let that fool you!  I threw in frozen chicken and I didn't have cilantro so omitted that and used two cans of chicken broth instead of water.  Then added everything else and left it to slow cook all day.  WOW, it was so delicious!  I also don't measure the spices but just add what I think I will like (stuck to the intended ingredients though) so I can't be sure if it was spicer than normal or less spicy but it was just right for me.  I froze half and will enjoy it on the colder days as a treat.(I also just used store bought tortilla chips and they were just fine, I was all about saving time!)

LOVED this recipe. Even better than the soup at my favorite go-to restaurant.

I used a large can of whole tomatoes and a large can of green enchilada sauce and a 7oz can of green chili peppers. 

Also, used a rotisserie chicken for the shredded chicken.

This was super simple to pull together, and came out tasting great. Don't skimp on the cilantro, my grocery store was out and I could tell it was really missing. This tasted even better after the second day. Yum!

I used a 1-qt. crockpot to slow cook the chicken (for 3 hours) then shredded it before transferring to the 5-qt. crockpot to make the soup. I added 5 oz. of frozen corn because I didn't have canned corn. I also used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes with chipotle chilies (Hunt's makes many specialty diced tomatoes these days!). I had a 32 oz. carton of chicken stock leftover from the holidays, so I used that instead of the chicken broth and water. I used all of the other ingredients as described in the recipe. I ended up adding another cup of  water just to bring down the spicy heat. I did make the homemade tortilla strips, which are BY FAR better than salty, store bought tortilla chips (like Tostitos). The homemade variety is thicker and heartier and makes for a better dipping tool. I served my soup with shredded coulby-jack cheese, olives and a dollop of greek non-fat yogurt (see my photo). Great basic recipe because it leaves a lot of room for adding/subbing ingredients.

We loved this soup!!! I can't believe how good it came out! I added a rinsed can of black beans and used a can of Rotel instead of the whole tomatoes. I also used all chick broth instead of using water. WINNER!

Made this soup for our "End of the world" party & it was a huge success!  Delish!  For time's sake, I used a couple of roasted chickens from the deli at our supermarket.  It only took 3-4 hours to cook this way & was alot easier.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it not only tastes great but it so very easy to make. Just dump everything in the slow cooker and walk away! I'm a Texan living in Scotland where canned enchilada sauce is not available, so I use an enchilada mix packet. I just add that to the other spices and sprinkle it over everything. For the liquid, I combine tomato sauce (called passata in the UK) and the chicken broth. I like a thicker soup so I only put in enough liquid to just cover the ingredients. Great recipe! Thank you!

I made it per the suggestions to add black beans and one cup more of chicken broth. First attempt was with company. It was a hit. I didn't bother with the corn or bay leaf and used chips instead of tortillas which was a lot easier. I have added it to my favorites.

I made this recipe twice in one week.  It's very delicious and received rave reviews from my family and friends.  I used tortillas from a bag to save time and used home made chicken broth instead of a mixture of broth and water.  I will make this again.

Very satisfying and healthy!!  I added a can of black beans (be sure to rinse and drain well) & some fresh squeezed lime ( to taste).  Instead of a can of green chiles, I used one can of mild Rotel.  Also, instead of a can of enchilada sauce, I used dry packets of it and added water--it was cheaper. It says "slow-cooker" recipe, but I was in a hurry and made it on the stove and it was scrumptious!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and everyone LOVED it.  My only changes were that I did not make the tortilla strips (we just ate with tortilla chips) and I did not pre-cook my chicken breasts.  I had placed some in the fridge overnight to thaw, and they were still partially frozen in the morning.  I put them in, anyway.  2 hours on High and then 6 hours on low, and the breasts shredded very easily. The house smelled DELICIOUS! 
My 9 year old son is requesting I make this again on a daily basis.

Very good!. I used a can of black beans and green enchilada sauce. Added frozen chicken breast at the beginning. Used all chicken broth instead of any water. Too the seeds out of the can of green chilis (Hubby can't do spicy) And used tortilla chips. I added avocado cheese and sour cream at the end.

Really good and easy to make! Like some other people suggested, I just put the chicken in frozen and used tortilla chips instead of baking the strips myself - a little quicker and tasted great! I also put a dollop of sour cream and some avocado slices in each bowl just before serving.

This was very good.  Added black beans toward the end and the lime at the end is a must.  A little too spicy for the kids but that depends on the enchilada sauce used probably.

I followed the recipe exactly except for a few substitutions. I used the breast from a rotisserie chicken, which was perfect. Also used canned corn. I added a little chopped fresh carrot. I served it with a dollop of sour cream, some grated mexican chesses, a squeeze of lime juice and a couple of slices of avocado. I used store bought tortilla chips crumbled on top and it was spectacular!! I will make again!!

Delicious!!  Have made this several times.  I'm not huge on spicy so I used banana peppers instead of chili peppers.  I also cut down teh cumin and chili pepper a bit. Freezes really well.

This is a great soup!!  Easy to throw together.  And the family loves it.  When I serve the soup in bowls I add a dollop of sour cream and some kind of mexican cheese.  This is a regular soup in my house.

Very easy and was quite satisfying. I'm going to tweak it a bit next time with dark meat chicken and then I think it will be a 5-star for me.

I was pretty happy with this recipe.   After reading other reviews I didn't precook the chicken.  I cut the breasts in half and took them out about an hour before it was done, shredded it and put the chicken back in.  I also added a can of black beans because they are a favorite of mine.    I also dumped a little rice in there.   I have no doubts I'll make it again.

My family loved this soup.  The smallest one does not like any new recipe. Her brother must convince her that it is good.  She came home and said, "Something smells really good. Is it new?" I told her it was a new recipe.  She called her brother & announced, "I am going to like this one."  She loved this one.  She was upset that there were no leftovers for her the next day. This has already had requests for more.  Yay

I made this pretty much exactly as the recipe states, using a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket and it turned out really good. I did not make my own tortilla chips, just used store bought and crumbled them into the bowl. This is a really good recipe.

This recipe is excellent.  I use canned petite diced tomatoes and use black beans instead of corn for more fiber and less carbs.  I also use a bit more cumin, some minced garlic and some garlic salt.  I did as others suggested and just put raw boneless skinless chicken breasts into crock pot with other ingredients.  Removed and shredded about an hour before serving and returned to slow cooker.  Served with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and Golden Flake tortillas (The label says "Mazietos" and they are absolutely the best.  Since there are only 2 of us, 3 chicken breasts make plenty with enough leftovers for at least one more meal.  Yummy.

With the suggestions of the reviewers, this soup was very good.  I put the chicken in frozen, and shredded it an hour or two before eating.  I also used a can of black beans instead of corn, and more chicken broth instead of water.  
The soup was still pretty thin and I wanted it a little more stew-like, so I added a cup of cooked rice at the end.
I topped my bowl with some lime, avocado, sour cream, shredded cheddar, and chips.  Yum!

Made this soup exactly as directed and thought the enchilada sauce should be omitted to much acidity and gives it a tinny taste, made another tortilla soup on this site that had no enchilada sauce and it was great, so beware unless you make your own sauce, dont use the can, trust me you wont like it

This is exceptionally good on a cold winter's night.  Only changes I make:  diced tomatoes rather than whole... 32 oz. chicken broth (no water)... add a can of black beans... and top with sour cream and shredded cheese.

This soup is so good. I use uncooked chix breasts, either fresh or frozen, whatever I have on hand.  I just shred it in the crock pot about an hour before serving.  I also use another can of chicken broth instead of water and I add 1 fresh jalapeño chopped.

I was looking for a copycat recipe to recreate the soup I found a Granite Brewry in Sioux Falls, SD. This one is so much like it!!!!  I used half of the chili and cumin powders and still too hot. They also sprinkled sharp cheddar just befor serving. They also had cream in their recipe. But this one did wonderful!

I add everything in crockpot on high for 3 hour and didn't really measure any of the ingredients. 

I added adobo, sazon and sofrito to help kick up the spanish flavors. As other reviewers, I added a can of chicken broth and skipped on the water. 

I topped each bowl with smashed tortilla chips, (instead of the tortilla directions) Mexican cheese and sour cream. 

My husband raved!!

This is our favorite chicken tortilla soup! I just add the chicken breast at the beginning and cook on high for 3-4 hours. The chicken shreds so easily. I thought it might be a little spicy for my younger kids, but everyone devoured it. Thanks!

This couldn't be easier to make and couldn't be more delicious!!!  I used green enchilada sauce and threw in frozen chicken breasts with all of the other ingredients before going to work...by the time I got home the house smelled great and the chicken was falling apart (SO easy to shred).  We added some Tapatio sauce, chedder cheese, and then just crushed up some tortilla chips.  We also made some buttered bread to soak up all the juice.  This is beyond delicious, try it!!!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

This quickly became a favorite in our household.  The only downside that my husband never wants to each any other soups because this one is so good.  Make it exactly as written in the original recipe.  We use a Rotisserie chicken for the shredded chicken--I include the white and dark meat--and it's delicious and easy!

This soup was fabulous! Even better the next day! I added a can of hominy just because I love it so much and garnished with sour cream and shredded cheese. This is definitely a keeper recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it!

This is fantastic!  I add a can of black beans and some brown rice just to stretch it further.  Freezes beautifully.

OUTRAGEOUS! I doubled the recipe on all ingredients, except: Used 2.5 lbs. of chicken, singled the green chile (I have a 5-yr. old) and I used way more cilantro - an entire bunch. Didn't make the tortilla strips. Was fine with Mission brand tortilla strips as an optional topping. Also offered with avocado, low-fat sour cream, grated cheddar and lemon wedges. Everyone loved it and asked that it be made weekly!

Very good and flavorful.  Used some leftover baked chicken which I shredded and worked out great.  Also, instead of whole tomatoes smashed Used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes which added a little extra flavor.

Great recipe. I thought it was too spicy for young children, but a lot of foods are.  I added some cornstarch after it was ready to thicken it up a bit and I added a dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla chips when I served it.

I like it spicy. This recipes was easy and delicious. I did add a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies to give it a kick. I also added 1/2 can of black beans. I will come back to recipe often.

Let me start by saying that I'm giving this two stars because I made it exactly as listed and there was no "wow factor."  I'm quite disappointed because it has over 2000 reviews and almost 5 stars, I have never had that problem with allrecipes.com. Recipes that are rated high by a lot of users have ALWAYS turned out nothing less than amazing. This is the first time I have ever given negative feedback.

This was wonderful even though I burned it! I broke the lid on my slow cooker so I used my Dutch oven and forgot to come back and check it and the bottom burned pretty badly.  I scooped out the non burned and added more water and chicken broth and it still got great reviews from the family.  I am doing it again next week with a new slow cooker and really excited about the results this time.  Even with the charred tinge, it was wonderful.  lol

I made this last night and I am absolutely in love.  I order Chicken Tortilla soup at restaurants and I've always wanted to make my own and finally found this recipe.  Oh my goodness... it was perfection.  I did a couple things differently and they really paid off.  First, I cooked my chicken with a packet of Lawry's Chicken Taco seasoning and 3/4 cup of water in a pan, letting them simmer first.  Instead of 2 cups of water, I added a second can of chicken brother and a half cup of water.  I also added an extra TBL of Chili powder.  To thicken it and add a bit of creaminess, I put in a few spoons of sour cream.  :-)  Perfect!

Very yummy!  My family loved it.  I never really measure my spices so I doubt I used exactly what the recipe called for but it turned out delicious anyway.  I cooked flour tortillas in oil on the stove top and topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese.

OMG this tortilla soup is sooooooooo good! I've made this recipe a few times now. I follow the recipe pretty much exactly. The only changes I made was to the cooked chicken. First I did as other people said throw the chicken breasts in whole, then shred it a few hours into the cooking time which came out great. But this time, I took 2 chicken breasts, coated it with olive oil and seasoned it i mean verrry liberally with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper and baked in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, I get the slow cooker ready with all the ingredients as directed. When the chicken is done, shred it and pour it in with all the extra spices and juices left over. This gives it fabulous flavor! I cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours. It was so so good. The added flavor and drippings from baking the chicken is just divine and it just took 15 mins extra. Loved it!

Very good. 
It could have better to add chicken broth instead of 2c of water.  
Used frozen boneless skinless chicken thighs. After tearing up the meat, the stock tasted a bit gamey, so added 2 Tb rice wine, doubled crushed garlic, 1/4 ts grounded ginger. 
After tasting 2nd time, wanted more smokey flavour. So added 1/4 ts smoked chipotle chili powder.

My husband and my daughter loved this soup.  I made a modification, which, I wish I didn't make. I added a 1/2 cup of rice as well as an additional cup of chicken stock.  The rice REALLY absorbed the broth.  They loved the thickness of the soup, while I prefer mine "brothy".  Overall, the soup had a good flavor and, as suggested by other posters, I used frozen chicken breast as well as a couple skinless chicken legs.  I like how chicken legs add flavor and the meat fell off the bone, making the bones very easy to remove.

Delicious! I didn't have to be adjusted besides I added an extra 1/4 tsp cumin.  We used just tortilla chips from whole foods and I put out cheese, sour cream, and more cilantro for garnishing! So flavorful!!

Just had this for dinner--it had an overall good taste, just not mind-blowing. If I make this again, I'll definitely up the seasonings, add beans, and probably thicken the soup just before serving.

This was the best chicken tortilla soup my husband and I have ever had! This is now one of my favorite and easy recipes to make. When I served the soup I added the tortilla strips, some cheese, sour cream, and sliced avocado. It was excellent!!

I much prefer the Chicken Tortilla Soup II recipe on this site. This one was just ok - nothing too exciting. The other recipe is WOW. Tastes like a restaurant quality soup.

Wow, this was good! Read MOST HELPFUL reviews and they were great. I didn't have frozen corn so I just added canned. Great. I also added a can of black beans and made my own enchilada sauce. This soup was SOOOOOO good! Will make again and again and probably again. lol.

Only gave this 4 b/c based on others advice I made some changes and the soup turned out great.  If hadn't I'm not sure I would have been happy.  I noticed the cx broth to h20 comparison and thought that would be too weak in flavor - so we just used chicken broth.  We used 'hot' enchilada sauce, and it turned out nice and not too spicy, actually not much kick.  We added fresh/raw chicken to the pot - I thought why crockpot cooked chicken for such a long time.  Anyway we like it a lot and will make this again.

I think it depends where you are from. I live in San Antonio and tortilla soup is very different here. It wasn't bad, but it defiantly was not authentic. My brother-in-laws mother made us a soup just like this when she came down from Dallas and all the Dallas natives loved it, all the people from San Antonio politely did not. I guess it depends on how close to the border you grew up. Personally...blah

This is my new favorite chicken tortilla soup recipe!  I didn't have a can of tomatoes so I subbed an equal amount of salsa with great results.   I also added a drained, rinsed can of black beans-just because I love them.  I also didn't have time to slow-cook, so made it on the stove-top.

This soup was delicious! I used a pre-cooked, fresh, rotisserie chicken from my grocery store, so chicken prep was a breeze, too. The chicken stayed very tender and the soup's flavor was wonderful. Don't skimp on the cilantro - it adds such a wonderful layer of flavor. I will be adding this to my regular slow-cooking favorites for sure.

Loved this soup!!!  Excellent flavor, I made it according to the recipe with the exception of the bay leaf (did not have one on hand).  It came out perfect, the only thing I may do next time is add a little more chicken (just put the chicken in the crock pot frozen, it comes out great).  Also I made the tortilla strips from corn tortillas as directed, it was good but more work.  The next day I used tortilla chips from a bag with the leftovers and it was just as tasty.  I will definitely be making this one over and over again, thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe!  Easy, excellent flavor & stick-to-your-ribs goodness on a cold winter's day.  I followed 2 suggestions--added a can of black beans & used store bought tortilla chips.  I also couldn't find any of the frozen corn from last summer's garden, so I subbed a can of fiesta corn.  Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

So far so good. I forgot the bay leaf and I added adobo seasoning. I took others advice and didn't cook the chicken-shredded it right before serving.

Delicous and easy!  I halved the cumin/chili pepper for kids and it was perfect. Really good with the toasted corn tortilla strips on top and also sliced avocado- yum! I used leftover rotisserie chicken.

This soup is amazing!  I just served it at an office potluck, and it is GONE.  I did add a can of drained black beans, used all chicken broth in lieu of water, and added a can of RoTel with lime and cilantro.  Delicious!  Please note, if doubling the recipe, ingredients will not comfortably fit in one large crock pot.

Really really good. I threw the uncooked chicken in the crock pot and after about 6 hours, took it out and shredded it. I used a can of green chile enchilada sauce instead of red, I prefer the flavor of green. I also added a diced jalepeno for added spice then garnished with sour cream and cilantro to cool it off, very good

I tried this recipe today; I read through a lot of revews and modified it to suit me.   I used a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store. I used a jar of medium salsa rather than plain tomatoes, and I added in 1/2 a cup or so of salsa verde to boot. I did NOT use enchilada sauce. I used all chicken broth, no water, for more flavor; 30 mins before the finish time, I stirred in a mixture of 3 tbsp. masa harina (masa flour) whisked into 1/2 cup water to thicken it slightly and give an additional layer of corn flavor. I also added in a can of drained and rinsed black beans. I doubled the amount of cumin and chili powder, and only used half a can of green chiles - it was hot enough with just that much, for my family. I served it with some bacon and cheddar cornbread muffins.   Great base recipe from which to build; thanks for sharing it.

Very good and very easy. I love slow cooker recipes that don't require any work ahead of time-jsut dump and cook.  The only thing I would change would be to use a homemade version of enchilada sauce, and that is just my preference for healthier options.  Otherwise, it's great!!

Doubled well.  Used left over Thanksgiving turkey. A whole meal in a pot.  Very flavorful. I served with grated cheese, a dollup of sour cream, chopped avacados and a few crumbeled taco chips.(had cilantro and forgot it ...would have been great)

Just made this again last night and I love this soup recipe!  It is one of my favorites, so easy to make, but tastes like a lot of work!  I made a few suggested changes; added 1 can of drained black beans, use diced canned tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes, also use 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the water.  I garnish it with corn tortilla strips, shredded cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Made exactly as written (minus the bay leaf and cilantro) and it was good, but adding a can of black beans would make it a five star soup.

I made this recipe with modifications based on other reviewers and my friend (who is an excellent cook) thought it was great and spicy enough for people who like spice without being "killer hot" for people who can't take too much heat.  I used 2lbs chicken, (from frozen breast strips) 1 can of "hot" red enchilada sauce, half a 15oz can of green enchilada sauce, 1-15oz can of black beans, 4 cloves of garlic, 27oz container of chicken stock, 1/2 cup of water and one heaping teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder.  Kept everything else the same and it was great!

Wonderful recipe, thank you! I have now made this recipe quite a few times and still absolutely love it. My kids and husband like it just as much too. This has now gone into our regular rotation. Serve with tacos or a taco salad and you have yourself a meal!

I made a couple of changes to the original recipe but it turned out fantastic.  I used 3 or 4 frozen chicken breasts to save some time and hassle.  I subbed 2 cups of low sodium chicken stock instead of the water to give it more flavor.  I also added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed to make it more visually appealing). This was absolutely wonderful.  It made a huge batch and there was a lot left over for just the two of us but it was perfect for a super busy week.   Also, I cut up some leftover corn tortillas, sprayed them with cooking spray, sprinkled with salt, and popped them in the toaster oven for a few minutes while I reheated leftovers.  Store bought chips would have been fine but I liked the fact that the strips were warm. Don't forget to garnish with sour cream, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime!

This is my #1 favorite recipe!! I always follow it exactly as written and it always turns out great!! I use lime flavored tortilla chips, and garnish with fresh limes and avocado. I would give this 10 stars if I could.

This was a wonderful chicken tortilla soup enjoyed by the whole family.  I stayed pretty true to the recipe.  I didn't weight my cooked chicken, but I'm sure it was somewhat more than a pound and I pulled it into bite-size chunks rather than shredding.  The can of tomatoes I used was a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos.   I used a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth with roasted garlic and eliminated the minced garlic due to that.  I used 2 15 oz. cans of whole kernal corn, drained, because I was out of frozen corn.  For the tortillas I used commerial restaurant-style tortilla chips.  Each of us put a scoop of rice in the bottom of our bowls, topped that with the soup, added a fistful of Mexican-style cheese, added diced raw onion and chopped cilantro.  This is the best -- no need to look further for the best chicken tortilla soup.  It was so easy to throw together and let the crockpot do the rest of the work.

This was better than tortilla soup I've had in restaurants.  I made a couple changes - like others I just put in frozen raw chicken breast and cooked on high for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken and continued cooking on low for a couple more hours.  I also added a can of black beans.  I garnished with shredded cheddar cheese, the tortilla strips and sour cream.

I make a lot of recipes from this website and I have only given one other dish a five star rating.  This one is my second.  It absolutely deserves a five star rating.  I made this recipe exactly as is and it is perfect.  The longer it cooks, the flavors blend more.  The next day it was even better.  We served it with avocado wedges, sour cream, shreded co-jack cheese and the homemade tortilla strips.  do not skimp on these.  Some reviewers say to just buy the bagged but there is a huge difference.  It is easy to make them yourself and they add a fresh taste.

Wow - this was really great!!  Hubby said it was the BEST he has ever had!  As others had suggested - I just put a couple of frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot, used chicken broth in place of water, and added all the other ingredients.  The black beans suggested are a MUST.  I used medium heat enchilada sauce which was fine for hubby but a little spicy for me.  I toned mine down with a tsp of sour cream...excellent addition.  Served it with the homemade tortilla strips - which are definately a plus - so much corn flavor! Added some mexican shredded cheese.  Can't wait to add some avocado to it at serving tomorrow!  Excellent and easy.

BEST SLOW COOKER RECIPE EVER! I made this and ommited the water, used two frozen chicken breasts (which I shredded 3 hours into low heat cooking, then cooked an additional 2 hours on high) I drained my black beans and added a little jalapeno for kick. When it was finished I loaded it with cilantro and used a dollop of sour cream and a few crubled Mission Tortilla chips from the grocery store. It was good enough to eat as every meal for the next 4 days and make again the next week. In fact, I have a pot of it in the fridge right now. Absolutely easy and FABULOUS!

This recipe came to me in my daily email, and it's the first one I have ever tried from the email messages. Even though the soup was spicy, I think that it could have had a little more flavor to it. I did enjoy the fresh baked tortilla strips with it.

So good and so easy.  I just put frozen chicken breast in at the beginning and shred them at the end.  To serve I added a squeeze of lime juice, sour cream and cheese.  Next time I think I will add black beans to the soup for added texture and vitamins.

I make this all the time.instead of frozen corn use fresh if possible or if you want add hominy instead for a more authentic result. instead of water add  beef broth to your base. we serve ours over plenty of cheese and fried crispy homemade corn tortilla strips. yum yum. never have left overs!

My girlfriend has IBS symptoms but is trying to also have a low-carb diet to lose weight (I know, opposing goals) so after enjoying the original I also made this with a few changes and it was wonderful.  In an attempts to add as many vegetables as possible, I chopped green, yellow and red peppers and added them to the mix and you can also PUREE a can or two of the Southern Style seasoned Beans that Glory Foods offers, which adds body and protein without TOO much fat.  I also chopped some zucchini squash and used the method others mentioned of putting frozen chicken in the soup and then taking it out and chopping or shredding it later after it cooks.    I love corn, but it's not part of Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet, so it was out, but the other additions combined to make a delicious and filling soup that thankfully didn't cause my lady's stomach to hurt.

Great soup, perfect flavor! We added a dollop of sour cream to the bowl when serving, and used crushed tortilla chips instead of hassleing with the tortilla shell strips. Very good!

Pretty  good if I must say so myself.  I made my own enchilada sauce using a couple Tbs. of oil, about 1-1/2 Tbs of flour, 2-3 Tbs of chili powder (two different kinds), 1 Tbs cumin.  Stir over heat, add 1 small can of tomato paste, 1 can of chicken broth/stock/boullion (whatever) maybe two (I don't remember), simmer approx. 15 min.    I also used 1 can of black beans, 1 can of corn, 1 can of diced tomato's in olive oil, garlic & oregano. I threw in the about 8 frozen chicken tenders, all chicken broth, no water, more cilantro, 3 cloves pressed garlic, 1 teas. chili powder, 1 teas. cumin, and no salt & pepper.     I topped it w/mozzarella cheese & diced avocado w/little cilantro, and it was to die for!

Good soup, but slightly lacking in depth of flavor.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs since they have more flavor and are more tender than breasts (put into crock-pot raw; no need to pre-cook).  I added all the ingredients listed, cooked on high for 5 hours, pulled chicken thighs out at 4 hours and shredded with a fork (they basically fell apart they were so tender), threw chicken back in, then tasted.  Soup did not have enough punch or flavor for me, so I added another 1/2 t. of both the cumin and chili powder, then added a few dashes of Penzey's 4S Seasoned Salt and the juice of half of a lime.  The broth is thin, but that is typically how tortilla soup is.  Note:  I originally added one medium chopped onion, as recipe stated, but ended up pulling a lot of onion back out, as that's all I could smell when it was cooking, and it looked to onion-heavy.  Also, the onion was not soft for me until after 5 hours of cooking.  Crunchy onions are not something I enjoy in soup, so I cooked it for longer than the recommended 3-4 hours on high, waiting for the onions to soften.  Overall good, with the added spices, etc. I listed here.

This was a terrific recipe.  You can't taste the beer which made me happy since I am not a beer drinker.  Mine came out more like a stew than a soup.

I am having some friends over for a holiday dinner in a few weeks so I was making a "dry run" this afternoon with  this recipe and a batch of Hearty Chicken Tortilla Soup. It looked to me like these two recipes had the most stars so I figured I would try them both and see which one is the best. I followed both recipes EXACTLY except I added a can of drained  and rinsed black beans to each bath. When I served it (in bowl #1 and bowl # 2 so the family vote on the best one) I put some shredded cheese, sour cream and sliced tortilla chips (store bought) on top. The vote is in 3 out of 4 liked this recipe the best. It is a little bit spicier. I cooked it on the stove, not the crock pot. Boiled some chicken breast in a third pot. Cooked for about 40 minutes. I am thrilled, it was very very yummy!  I know my friends will love it too.

Wanted something hot on a rainy day after Thanksgiving.  This was perfect!  Used chopped leftover turkey, half a 14 oz can enchilada sauce, one can diced tomatoes with green chilis, omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any, and used bagged tortilla chips.  Everything else in the recipe I followed.  I dumped it in a pot on the stove, heated to boiling, reduced heat and simmered for about 30 min.  Didn't think I needed the crock pot since everything was cooked.  Really yummy!  Added cheese, sour cream and a few more chips on top.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe as stated, adding black beans like another reviewer suggested. Fantastic on its own!  However I found an additional item that takes this recipe over the top: I broke up some Hint Of Lime tortilla chips over the soup. Oh My Word! This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe since October and it's going on the menu for my annual cookie exchange.   Thanks Elena!!

This is outstanding! I didn't have time to slow cook, so I cut up my chicken breasts into small chunks and added them to a large stock pot with all the other ingredients, except for the cilantro, which I added about 15 mins. before I served it. I used Rotel tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and green chiles since that is what I had on hand. I simmered it for about 2 hours on my stove. To save time I served it with tortilla chips. My family thinks it is the best soup I have ever made (and I agree)! Thanks for sharing this Elena.

This was DELICIOUS! I took tips from other reviewers:  TIP #1: Use 3 frozen chicken breasts, shred when 1 hour left.  TIP #2: Dice up 5 tortillas and add to the beginning for flavor and to thicken the soup.  TIP #3: Add 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans.  TIP #4: Omit the water, just use 3 cups Chicken Broth. This will definitely be a staple recipe at my house :) Made lots so prepare to freeze some!

My husband and I are picky eaters and we both LOVE this soup.    I have made it for dinner parties and am told it rivals most Mexican restaurants.  I use fresh parsley instead of cilantro as a personal preference.  I garnish with a little sour cream, shredded cheese and tortilla strips.  A real winner.

I've made this quite a few times and it is wonderful! So easy and cheap to make, and just as good, no-better, than anything you can buy or get in a restaurant. I often add extra vegetables too, depending on what I have in the house - frozen okra, fresh zucchini, canned black beans... whatever. It's all great in this recipe! This is now a staple in our house. I make an extra large batch and put a bunch in the freezer for those days when we don't want to cook.

Wonderful soup! Added some red pepper flakes and doubled the other spices.  It worked fine to put the chicken breasts in frozen--they cooked nicely.  This is especially good with a large dollop of sour cream plopped in the middle of each bowl.

Perfect! This soup was super easy and tasted fantastic. We are from the south and like things a little spicy...so i added the medium enchilada sauce, but it was not overwhelming. I cooked it on high in the crock pot for 4 hours. I added a whole rotisserie chicken (from the local deli) at the end and simmered it for 30 more minutes. We topped it off with shredded cheddar, sour cream and the tortilla strips. My kids are asking when we will have it again. Great recipe!!!!

Wonderful!  Cooking chicken in the crock is about the best way to go and makes it super easy to shred, something I would normally despise doing.  (My chicken was also frozen so I stuck it in with some of the liquid stuff and let it cook all night first.)  I didn't use the green chilies cause I don't particularly care for them and I think that would have been too hot.  I think also about half the tortillas were enough.  I did start out baking the tortillas but they got soft after being in the soup anyway, so I used the rest as is.  Super easy.  I would say I think I'd like the chicken pieces bigger and would probably just rip it into pieces next time.

Leftover idea... I drained off the broth and mixed the remaining with sourcream and softened cream cheese for a fabulous dip - cold or slightly warmed.  This soup recipe was super easy...threw it together in the morning.  For us, it needed more seasoning...extra cumin, etc...  The whole family enjoyed it. Thanks!

This was a good start, however I found it a little bland.  I ran out to the grocery store and picked up a package of Knorr spanish rice, cooked the rice in a separate saucepan and added it into the crockpot.  I suppose I could have just tossed the rice right into the crockpot and cooked it from there but that would have been too easy.  ANYWAY, it was really, really good after that.  I'll definitely make this A LOT.  I also used frozen, uncooked chicken and I added a can of pinto beans.

I think this is a little bland without some additional changes.   Use Rotel instead of plain cans of tomatoes.  Use HOT enchilada sauce, add 1 can of black beans, and add several dashes of hot sauce.  I also added 8 freshly chopped jalapeno's (with seeds), which gave it an excellent zip!  You can just put frozen chicken breasts into the crock pot and shred them later, as other's have suggested.  Worked perfectly!  Friends keep begging me to make this again and again!

Outstanding and easy! Changes made were based on other reviews. Used 1 quart of Chicken broth (low fat/low sodium)and did not add the water or salt. Put the chicken breast in whole and shredded them about 1 hour before the soup was finished and at that time I added 1 can of drained and rinsed black beans.  I used a little more than 1 pound of chicken. I thought the spice and taste was just right and look forward to making this again.

I LOVE this recipe. Added all chicken broth instead of water. Added one can of beans, a little less corn, frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts cubed, and fresh lime juice at the end. I topped my soup with avocado, sour cream and cheese and it was so delicious!!!

This is a good base.  I needed more broth and salsa, I had lots of chicken but not much sauce.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of corn and 1 can of white kidney beans.  Next time I'll add 2 cans at least of kidney beans and double the salsa and broth.  Also, it has no spice, so if you like spice you'll need to kick it up.  I think I'll add zuchinni next time too.  It's needs more vegetables to me. I threw everything in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours and low for 1 or more.  The chicken of course was perfectly tender.  Really nice, I just think it could be much more.

This was excellent!  I used leftover juice from a slow cooker chicken and no water.  It was delicious.  Even made the strips and not the bag of chips (go me!!).  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was SUPER easy and SUPER delicious!!!!!!! I loved every minute of it! I took suggestions from others and just used whole breasts and threw them in raw. Then instead of the homemade tortilla I used the bagged kind...LOVED IT!!! A TRUE keeper!!

People are NUTS for this recipe, everyone asks for it!! I made it for 20 guys on football sunday and i have been famous ever since :) I have probably made it 10 times since that day! I dont make the tortilla strips(we just crush up chips and sprinkle over the top), but it is still the most amazing tortilla soup recipe EVER! I make only a few changes-i skip the green chile peppers(so the kids can eat it too), and add black beans (drained). Thanks for an amazing recipe!

So good!!!  It was easy also!  I followed the recipe almost exactly. Here are my variations:*I doubled the recipe to make sure I had leftovers. *I added uncooked chicken breasts to the bottom of the pot. Then poured the rest of the ingredients on top. *I used more chicken broth and used less water than called for. 
*I also added a can of drained black beans half way thru the cooking time. *I then took the chicken out an hour before done time and shredded it and put it back in the crock pot. I can't say it enough! Easy, easy, easy! You won't be sorry if you try this recipe.

If you are reading reviews to help you decide whether or not to make this soup, stop reading and start cooking.  This soup is fantastic. Add fresh or frozen chicken at the start and top with top with tortilla chips instead of making them. Beans or not your choice - either way is wonderful. Enjoy!

I make this recipe all the time and everyone that I have ever served it to loves it and asks for the recipe. I do make the following changes: I don't add any water, instead I use chicken broth, for a total of four cups chicken broth. I also add one can of rinsed black beans. I also add frozen chicken breasts at the beginning and then remove from the pot and shred before returning the chicken back to the soup. I also don't make the tortilla strips, we just serve it with crushed tortilla chips on top along with shredded cheese and sour cream. This is my staple for nights when I don't have time to cook. I just throw everything into the crock pot in the morning and cook on low for 8 hours. If I don't get it started until the afternoon, then I just cook on high for 3 1/2 hours. YUMMY! Oh yeah, I just skip the bay leaf as well and don't ever seem to miss it. This recipe is so easy that I often have my 10 year old daughter start it for me.

This is an excellent, awesome, super easy recipe!! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.    I used 4 or 5 boneless skinless frozen chicken thighs. If I can find it I use the El Pato brand tomato sauce (hot mexican sauce) that can be found in the ethnic food section at the grocery store. This makes it spicy so if you want to tone it down stick with the red enchilada sauce.  2 cans of Kuners tomatoes and chilies and added the Cilantro during the last 20 minutes.  This is a keeper recipe.

This is the best tortilla soup I've ever had!  I just threw frozen chicken breast in the crockpot and shredded it after a few hours.  Also, I added a can of black beans and substituted a 1/2 cup water for an extra 1/2 cup enchilada sauce. I would recommend using fire-roasted canned tomatoes, they make a big flavor difference. Served with corn chips instead of making my own.  Everyone that ate agreed it was delicious!

Just made this recipe this past weekend and it was wonderful. Made a few additions: Instead of water, I used all chicken broth. Used a small can of El Pato instead of enchilada sauce. Also used can of diced tomatoes rather than whole. It came out slightly spicy but not overbearing. Just how we like it.My husband devoured 2 bowls of it! Definitely a keeper.

Super!  I had all of the ingredients on hand (which is rare) and dumped them in the slow cooker.  Six hours later my family had arrived and devoured the whole batch.  Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, etc.  This is a keeper!

A little hint on the chicken broth/water issue - just cook your chicken in 4-5 cups of salted water. Use the flavored water instead of chicken broth + water, as the recipe calls for!

This is really, really good!  To make it even easier, I just throw the chicken in the crock pot uncooked, remove an hour before serving to shred, and toss it back in.  I also added a can of black beans, which was a great addition.  
I made this to take to our weekly soup supper and accidentally bought "hot" enchilada sauce.  I was worried it was going to be super-spicy, but it seemed to lose a lot of zing while cooking, so it turned out with just the right amount of spice - everyone loved it!  
Make your own tortilla strips - it's well worth it and store-bought chips just don't cut it after having the real thing!  Great recipe!

We loved this recipe!  I changed it up a bit based on others's suggestions.  Used a can of Rotel instead of whole tomatoes, used all chicken broth instead of water, added black beans, added raw chicken breasts from the beginning, shredding once tender.  My firefighter husband says this is firehouse worthy (quite a feat).  Will definitely make this again!

OMG, this was terrific!  I haven't had tortilla soup in years, and I was happy to stumble upon this recipe.  I tore up a rotisserie chicken, then threw everything in the crock pot on low for 7 hours.  I tasted it and I thought it was a little weak, so I added 3 envelopes of no sodium chicken boullion and a little sea salt.  Next time I'll use all chicken broth and no water.  I garnished each bowl with the toasted tortillas, a generous dollup of light sour cream, cubed avocado and plenty of chopped fresh cilantro.  It was out of this world, and I will be making it often!  Thanks for the terrific recipe, Elena!

Muy excelente! I did leave out the chile powder since I was using an enchelada sauce that was at the HOT level and I also had small children who were going to be eating it. It was still too spicy for the kids, but the heat was toned down substantially when cheese and sour cream were added. I also add raw boneless skinless breasts to the crock pot and pull them out later to shread. I will make this over and over again!

This was way too soupy for my taste. The only change I made was instead of one can of broth and 2 cups of water, I used two cans of broth. Maybe that's where I went wrong, but there was just a lot of liquid and I like thick soup. I also didn't think it had that much flavor. If I were to make it again, which I probably won't, I'd only use one can of broth and leave out the water.

Great soup!! I didnt have any enchalada sauce, instead I had a bottle of medium taco sauce and a jar of salsa. I used a half cup of each and pureed them with a can of diced tomatoes (hubby doesnt like chunks of tomatoes). Added  can of black beans and used frozen chicken that I later removed and shredded just prior to serving. Love it, will be making on a regular basis. UPDATE: Have made this recipe a few time now. Turns out you can use just about any combination of tomato products that you want and it still turns out great. I've used two cans Rotell, pureed can of diced tomatoes and another can Rotell, Salsa, taco sauce, or enchalada sauce as written and its all great!

This is really, really good.  I usually make a tortilla soup that I got off the Kraft Foods website which we have always enjoyed, but my family has requested that this be the recipe I use from now on.  As the submitter stated, do not be put off by the list of ingredients.  It couldn't be easier.  Just throw it in the crockpot and you are done.  Like some of the other posters, I put my chicken breasts in frozen, and then pulled them out later to shred.  Wonderful on a cold night here in Minnesota!!

Great soup... 5 stars from both my husband and I. I was a little bit doubtful about just dumping the raw chicken in with everything else, but it worked out fine. I would recommend substituting chicken broth/bouillion for the water. Also, DO NOT skip the sour cream or the cilantro... Little things that make a big difference in the taste! This one's a keeper.

This was great with my changes! I just bought some chips and broke up a few in each bowl on the bottom instead of the tortilla thing- I used a 28oz can diced tomatoes with garlic, crushed- I used about a bottle and a half of Trader Joe's enchilada sauce- I used a can of corn and added a can of rinsed black beans- also topped with cilantro instead of adding it in. Also used no water but added another can of chicken broth. Did not add salt. I used 4 bone-in breasts but pulled the bones off them after a few hours. Was great on a chilly day - we added the spice at the table bc of the kids - Thanks for the new addition to our menu!

Great recipe!!  I also used chicken stock instead of the water - rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (so fast)- a favorite salsa in place of enchilada sauce - extra garlic - and finally, tortilla chips, avocado, and monterey jack cheese as garnish.  So good on a cold day and was able to toss it all together with my toddler hanging on my leg LOL!!

I agree with the last reviewer from today!! 10 stars! I too didn't add any water but used 2 cans of chicken broth. I also used 28oz of whole crushed tomatoes instead of 14. This is SOO good. My chicken was slightly frozen when i put it in but it's perfect now. I'm eating it as we speak. I LOVE IT. A KEEPER! Oh yeah I also added a 15 oz can of drained black beans. I think it's perfect.

10 stars if I could!!!!!!!!!!!!! YUM!!!  I didn't make many changes- I did NOT use any water- but did add 2 cans of chicken broth.  I started with FROZEN like a rock chicken breasts- starting with frozen meat in the slow cooker keeps it more moist.  Also, I did not add corn or cilantro (personal preference).  THIS WAS "ROCK MY SOCKS" GOOD!!!!!!!!!!  YUM!!!!!  Thank you!!

I have been looking for a great chicken tortilla soup and this is it.  Don't be put off by the long list of ingredients - it comes together in a snap.  I used leftover rotissierre chicken I had in the freezer and also added black beans for some added fiber.  We topped with Mexican cheese blend and avocado.  Oh I also just lightly sprayed both sides of the tortillas with cooking spray and then sliced and baked them for 7-10 minutes and they tasted great.

This was pretty good.  I added 2 small frozen chicken breasts & that was plenty.  Shredded with a fork once cooked for a few hours.  Add sour cream and melted Mexican cheese to bowl.  For chips: used flour tortillas -brushed one side with olive oil, sprinkled some garlic, onion, & chili powder and baked- were wonderful with the soup!  I also did not have a can of whole peeled tomatoes so I used a can of diced.  No water used- just 2 cans of chicken broth.  Even husband to "doesn't like soup" ate this!

Yummy soup!  I thought it would be too spicy at first, but by the time you add cheese, sour cream, and the tortilla strips it is perfect.  I added a can of black beans, and it made it even better.  My husband loved it.  It is much better than the taco soup you can make by opening cans and using packaged taco seasoning.  Really yummy!  Thanks!

I made this recipe on the weekend.  The only change I made was I added black beans and I put uncooked bone-in chicken breasts because they're less expensive.  I shredded the chicken off the bone and added it back to the soup when it was finished and we LOVED it.  My husband thought it was the best soup I've ever made.

Excellent soup and easy to make. Like others, I used all chicken stock (no water), but it was very rich, so I might try it as written next time. I also put my chicken in raw, whole pieces, and then shredded it just before serving. I added some fresh lime juice and a handful of cilantro just before serving as well, and offered chopped avocado, sour cream and cheddar cheese as toppings. My boyfriend inhaled this and said he loved it!  Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I love this recipe! Easy to make! I was trying to think of a side item to serve with this to make it more of a meal. I made cheese quesadillas. I do agree with one reader that it was as filling...the soup seemed a little thin. I added a some corn starch and cold water to it to thicken it a bit....it helped a lot. Gave it a little more body! I will definately make this again. I also like the spiciness of it. Very happy that I found this and tried it!

This is the best soup I have ever eaten.  I am very picky about the soups I eat and the ingredients in them.  I love this recipe because I could use all natural ingredients to make it healthy.  I used corn chips instead of the baked corn tortillas with the leftovers and it was very yummy. I added cheese to each bowl and I did not use any water.  I thought there was already enough liquid.  I also used a can of black beans to add more protein and I use broth without salt so I can control the salt in my food.  This recipe is my new favorite comfort dish.  I will make it often.

My husband is such a better cook than I am and therefore is picky. He said it was so good!!! He gave it a 10+. I also think this is the best tortilla soup I've tried in my life. The only thing I changed was add about 1/2lb. more chicken and a teaspoon of diced jalapenos. I needed a little spicy-ness in there! When I served the soup, I added the tortilla stripes and cheese on top of the soup. THE BEST!!!

This was a good recipe.  I gave it a 4 star because I feel it's a good base recipe to build off of.  I took others suggestions and used all broth and no water, but still found it to be very watery, I like my tortilla soup to be a little thicker.  Also, chunked my chicken and threw it in the crock pot raw, I didn't shredd it and it turned out good that way and made it very easy.  I mixed everything right in the slow cooker.

This recipe has prompted me to post for the first time - it was awesome.  Everyone loved it, especially the cadets we had over after the football game. The only thing I did different is, I didn't precook the chicken - I cut it into small pieces and threw it in with everything else. This is a definate keeper.  Thanks!

This was a very good soup. Sliced avocado & cheddar shreds were delicious on top along with some crushed tortilla strips. Next time, I will make a few changes: Use more chicken, add black beans, all chicken broth instead of water. I may even rev up the spices next time.

I made this for a crowd (doubled the recipe) and every single person asked for the recipe.  It was so tasty, with enough heat to make it special, but not so much as to make anyone miserable.  I used one can of spicy enchilada sauce and one can of medium.  I also used the Moist Garlic Chicken recipe from this site (a microwave recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts), omitting the optional spices and the butter in that recipe.  I also added chopped avocado to each bowl before ladeling in the soup.  My family asked me to make it again the very next day.  I love that it is very healthy, while being so delicious!

This soup is awesome!  I also took the chicken breast straight from the package to the crock-pot.  I also used a 28 oz can of tomatoes (b/c they are my favorite) and a fresh jalapeno instead of canned green chilies.  Added some corn and black beans for a little extra protein, topped with some avocado and lime n' chile tortilla chips.  Delicious!

After reading all of the reviews, I was excited about this recipe. Unfortunately, I messed it up all on my own. I followed all of the original directions to the tee (aside from taking a que from reviewers and using corn tortilla chips rather than making my own)... then sampled the soup about 4 hours into cooking. It tasted like it might need a little more salt - so I added about 1 tablespoon more. BIG MISTAKE. Don't do that. If you add sharp cheddar cheese and store bought chips, that is all the salt you need. Otherwise, it was good. I also added sour cream, which I will leave out next time. It dulls the spices - which is what makes this recipe good. I probably won't make this again real soon, but it will be a good soup to make again on a cold weekend night.

So yummy and super easy!  Everyone LOVED it.  Instead of making my own chips, I cut up corn tortillas and put them in the last 1/2 hr.  I also added the cheese the last 1/2 hr.  It made it super hearty and filling.  Will definately make again.

VERY good! Big hit with the whole family! I added a small jalapeno for some extra bite. I only cooked the tortillas for 8 min and they were a little over cooked. Also, garnished with avocados and cheese.

I found this about a month ago and have made it three times already and given out the recipe twice!  I doubled it and made it a little "hotter" for us, less so for us and everyone loves it!  
I get everything ready in the slow cooker; keep the chicen breasts in the refrigerator overnight and before I leave in the morning I put in the chicken breasts and it's all done by the time I get home.  I take out the breasts to shred them, put it all back in, make a salad and dinner is ready!  Thanks for sharing this.

Everybody loved this--my 5YO and 7YO sons went back for seconds, as did my husband. I used taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce and it worked out fine. Thanks for sharing this easy, tasty recipe.

Tasted delicious!  I couldn't find enchillada sauce, so I used 1/2 of a jar of mild salsa with beans and corn.  I'm not a great cook and this is soooo easy to make.  My boyfriend is a chef and loved it!

Good stuff.  Added one more can of enchilada sauce and cornstarch to thicken it.  Used the leftovers to layer with cheese and corn tortillas to make an enchilada type casserole.

As other reviewers have suggested, I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and let them cook w/ the soup.  Chopped and returned to the soup shortly before serving - melt-in-your-mouth tender.  Used homemade chix broth in place of the canned.  Served with a dollop of sour cream and some shredded Mexi-cheese, w/ crushed tortilla chips on top (no need to make your own)  Easy and FABULOUS!  Saving the leftovers in the freezer to enjoy another day.

I really enjoyed this soup - what a kick it has :)  I served mine with a dollop of sour cream to take the bite off it but its delicious!  A keeper.  (I could have taken out the green chillies for less heat but it was still good).

The recipe is good without any changes however I seem to always change or add something different and I like spice. So I added a packet of hot and  spicy taco seasoning, a can of black beans and an extra can of tomatoes. It also freezes very well.

This soup was great. Flavors were right on. Not too spicy, but had just enough heat to give it that authentic taste. You can certainly add more heat to suit your own wants and needs.

I, like a lot of others, can't stand when somebody gives an outstanding review of a recipe, only to read a little further, and realize that they basically changed the entire thing, making it something that it was never intended to be in the first place. That being said, and in full disclosure, I make the following statement: I made 3 changes. 1. I added black beans. 2. I also added white beans. And 3... I put two frozen chicken breasts into the slow cooker at the start, and let them rock. There. I said it. I PUT TWO FROZEN CHICKEN BREASTS IN AT THE START, AND JUST LEFT THEM IN THERE TO COOK! Wow. You have no idea how good that feels to get that off my chest. other than that, followed the recipe to a T. To the letter. No changes. No if's, and's, nor but's.

You know what? In my mind, the base of vegetables, liquid and seasonings is pretty close to perfect. And after all, isn't that what makes cooking fun? Start with a solid base and go crazy from there. Like throwing frozen hunks of chicken in at the beginning.

This recipe is so easy and the outcome was perfect. My family of 4 teenagers (very picky), my husband and I loved it. I made very few changes. I used 3 medium to large frozen chicken breast. i  threw them in along with all the other ingredients. Instead of water and chicken broth i just used a 32oz container of chicken broth (no water). I cooked it on low in the crock pot for 5 hours. Then I came home and took the chicken breast out and used 2 forks and shredded it. It was so tender and I did not have to wait for them to cool to shred them. I put the chicken back in the crock pot and added a can of black beans and let it continue to cook on low for another 3 hours. I was a little worried that I did not shred the chicken at around three hours ( other reviews shredded chicken at around 3 hours) and I thought that I may be cooking it too long, but because I have 4 teenagers that are super busy, I had no choice since I was not home during the day. So in all, the soup cooked on low for 8 hours in my crock pot, and it was super delicious! We had tortilla chips and i also made tortilla strips with corn tortillas. I cut them into strips and sprayed Pam on them and baked them at 400 for about 8 min. Either one tasted great with the soup.  Because of other reviews, I set out sour cream, Cheddar cheese, avocado, cilantro and fresh lime to add to the soup if anyone wanted. This is a recipe I will

This was just as good as the reviews state, which frankly suprised me from the simple ingredients. I stayed pretty true to the recipe, but did add one fun enhancement: I bought a package of chicken thighs to use for the shredded chicken. Instead of cooking and shredding them ahead of time, I trimmed the skin and fat off them and set that aside, and just cooked the thighs in the soup, removing and shredding the meat near the end. But the really fun part was that I chopped the chicken skin/fat into bits, and then rendered it in a pan. Once the skin bits started to get brown, I removed them to a plate, and then used the chicken schmaltz in the pan to fry the tortillas in. Afterwards, I saved the remaining schmaltz for another use, and then put the skin bits back into the pan to finish frying them. Fry them until they are a dark golden brown and very crisp. You can sprinkle them on top of the soup, with the tortillas, or on top of salad instead of bacon bits, etc.

Excellent recipe! I used all broth instead of water, green enchilada sauce and used 1 can regular tomatoes and 1 can Rotel, tomatoes with peppers. And added 1 cup of Guy Fieri's green sauce to give it more spice. I also took about a cup and a half of broth and put it in a blender with about 20 tortilla chips and blended until smooth then added to soup. This acted as a thickener and gave the soup a nice body & subtle corn background flavor. This will definitely become part of our staple "go to" meals.

Followed the recipe completely (except no chicken) Family absolutely loved it so much they went back for thirds. Wouldn't change anything about this recipe, and next time will definitely make sure to make enough chicken to add to this dish! Will make again someday.

I changed it up a bit. Used half the amount of water and replaced it with more chicken broth. I cooked the chicken in the soup and shredded it when I got home. Before serving I added a handful of crumbled, store-bought, tortilla chips and a couple tablespoons of a mix of shredded mozzarella, Jack and cheddar to each bowl. Filled the bowls with the soup, then topped with chopped avocado, cilantro and some more shredded cheese. Absolutely delicious and super easy to make.

Super soup but this is the low down.  Omit the water.  Since tomatoes come packed in water and the canned chichi's enchilada sauce is thin, it doesn't need more water.  Instead I increased broth 1/2c.  The other thing is that i only needed to cook on low for 3.5hrs - i checked to make sure each breast was cooked through, so if anyone has complained chicken is dry then it is overcooked.  BEFORE you shred AND IF you have kids that don't like 'pieces' of veggies in soup, i highly recommend an immersion blender.  You obviously would add corn (microwaved instead of cooked in soup) at the very end, and you would also shred chicken AFTER you blend (pull out breasts before blend then add shredded after).  I prefer to add chips rather than bother with tortillas in the oven.  Part of the beauty of slow cooking is to eliminate extra fuss, imho.  Enjoy!

Every time I make this for guests, they always ask for the recipe.  I have also made this over the stove and let it simmer for 30 minutes and tastes just as good!

Just made this for dinner tonight. Can't wait to make it again. Delish. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe only because of what I had on hand. Instead of enchilada sauce I used mild salsa, used rotisserie chicken and added a can of black beans. Finally, added sour cream and shredded cheddar right before serving. So good!

This was fantastic...  I didn't change a thing except I did put the chicken in raw and shredded it later.  My family loved it!

Good ingredients, good soup, especially for a cold, winter day. Thank you!

Made it for the second time today, after realizing I had already tried it once! I used suggestions and added black beans, used chicken broth vs. water, and frozen chicken breasts. Low for 4 hours, pulled apart chicken, high for 3 hours. Delish!

Made it for the third time today, yummy!

This was easy and delicious. I used Taco Seasoning instead of Chili Powder since that's what I had handy and I served with grated cheddar cheese. I was thinking next time I might try adding some canned black beans as well

UNBELIEVABLY easy and DELICIOUS!  To give you an idea...I just had shoulder surgery three days ago and have been DYING to get back in the kitchen. Luckily this was in my g-mail box, had most of the ingredients (sent hubby for a few things) and, with one arm in a sling was able to pull this off.  THANK YOU for submitting this yummy recipe!

Flat out awesome.  This is of the heartier variety than the glorified chicken broth that some call Tortilla soup, and it couldn't get any easier.  I have not had soup at a restaurant that I would prefer over this one.  I'm all for tweaks, but this one doesn't need to be messed with.  Just make it as written and you won't be sorry.  Now, if you want to make it even a bit easier, you can A) use precooked shredded chicken like you can get at Costco by the rotisserie chickens, or B) just use frozen chicken breasts, take them out about half way+ through, shred with 2 forks, and toss it all back in.  I use about 1 1/2 pounds of chicken.  We like the home made tortilla strips, but use store bought chips because I'm lazy.  The shredded Monterey Jack or Pepper Jack cheese (not cheddar) and sliced avocado to add when serving is an absolute must.  YUM!  An across the board favorite with everyone in the family.

This is a winner, hands down!  It is SO delicious! My dear husband, who is NOT a cook, assembled this (we doubled the recipe which filled the pot to the top) into the slow cooker for me on his day off for a party I was hosting that night.  We reviewed the recipe the night before, I chopped and bagged onion & garlic, and measured out spices.  All he had to do was open cans and dump everything in.  Based on reviews, he added only one bag of corn and one drained can of black beans, adding chicken breasts whole - they were so easy to shred just before serving.  For ease, we used store bought tortilla chips and served along w/a grated Mexican cheese mix.  I also served a minestrone, prepared the night before, from this site.   Both soups were a hit, but this one especially so!  Ladies came back for seconds and two requested some to take home to their husbands.  We were left w/one scant serving.  Needless to say, hubby was so proud of his accomplishment that he now enjoys assembling slow cooker recipes on his day off.  He even does his own chopping AND the last recipe he chose himself.  Thank you Elena!  This is in my recipe box definitely we will be making it again!

We loved this recipe, I don't recommend cooking for 8 hours. Should've turned it off after 6.5/7 hours.  I also put the chicken in raw, not cooked.

I am IN LOVE with this soup!! Followed this recipe almost to a tee. I omitted 1/2 tsp of salt, added 2 cups of drained black beans that had been cooked from a previous dinner, and added 2 extra cloves of garlic. I ended up using 3 raw chicken breasts and cooked the whole deal in a cast iron dutch oven on my stove for 6-8 hrs at around 2-low temp. Shredded the chicken about 3-4 hrs in. My whole house smelled amazing! I followed the directions for the tortilla strips exactly and they turned out great! When it was serving time, I placed a few strips in the middle of the bowl with a dollop of sour cream in the center, cilantro for garnish, a couple slices of avocado and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Absolutely scrumptious!! I wanted to eat the whole pot! Thank you, thank you! I will make this over and over again!! :)

Fantastic and easy.  There's not much more to it.  I had this in for 6 hours exactly.  Started with frozen chicken tenders, which I shredded at about the 4-hour mark.  Am VERY excited to make again.

It was alright.  Not amazing.  Didn't seem to have any kick to it.  Good way to use kitchen staple foods though.  Served with quesadillas.

This was recommended by my cousin, and like her, I didn't have time to slow cook this recipe, so I did it on the stove in about 45 minutes and it was wonderful!!  I did omit the corn and cilantro, and even used canned cooked chicken to speed up the process...i know, lazy as it gets, but so super yummy.  :)

As soon as I saw "2 cups water" I started questioning, but decided to follow the recipe and give it a try.  I should have trusted my gut!  Next time I will just use all chicken broth, because the soup ultimately tasted like tomato flavored water.

Love this! It's so easy, especially with left-over chicken. To make it even easier, instead of making our own tortilla strips we crushed up some tortilla chips. While it is good on its own, I like to add a dollop of sour cream and a bit of shredded cheese.

This is a good recipe to start with and can be tweaked to your liking.  I followed others' tips and added beans (I used white beans) and just threw in frozen chicken tenderloins instead of pre-cooking.  A jar of salsa is a great sub for the canned tomatoes.  I also stirred in a can of refried beans at the end, which really thickened it up and kicked it up to 5-stars.

Good recipe. Live in Southern California and have spent tons of time in Mexico and I thought this had a very authentic taste, especially considering how easy it was. I made some changes based on what I had a available and our taste. I used a hot enchilada sauce and also added some hot sauce. We like spicy and this had some serious kick! I skipped the water and added more broth. I made this on the stove top. I added raw chicken breast to my broth and let it simmer on really low for a while, pulled it out and shredded it and then added it back in. We topped it with a little queso fresco, lime, cilantro, avocado and greek yogurt (in lieu of sour cream).

Just had this soup tonight for dinner and it was just what we needed. We just finished a juice detox this week so we were looking for something light and healthy to start eating again. We followed the recipe as is, but of course, we like things spicy, so we substituted the canned green chili peppers for three medium jalapenos and one serrano chili (finely chopped). It gave it just the right SPICE =) Tip: for crispy wavy tortilla strips, be sure to slice them thin.

This has become our family all-time FAVORITE soup! I have tried lots of recipes and this is the only one that tastes as good as a Mexican Restaurant. Make sure you add lime juice and avocado right before eating. Yuuuuuuuuummmm!

The best recipe for Tortilla soup that I have found yet. It's cold out now so we are eating this a lot. Try it and add in some shredded cheese and crunchy tortilla strips when serving...  Awesome!!!

It is good but not better than restaurants I've had. :( disappointing. What should be said is to sauté the I onions and garlic before adding to the slow cooker. I also think it would have been just as good on the stove top.

Loved this recipe! I've made it twice already.  Very nice on days where you just want some soup, added some sliced avocado as a garnish.  Served with tortilla chips instead of making the strips.

OMG I LOVE this soup! And everyone who's tried it loves it. I've given the recipe to several people and they love it. I use chicken broth instead of the water, add a can or two of black beans. I cook the chicken in the water w/ some vegs for flavor. I also go ahead and add the lime juice at the end of cooking cuz I freeze it in individual bags to take to work for lunches. Not going to drag a lime w/ me. I don't do it in the crock pot, just cuz I make it on weekends to freeze, but would have no problem doing that. This is my FAVORITE soup.

I made this and even my super-picky, hates onions husband loved it!  Like a few others I made a couple of changes.  Instead of water I used a whole box of chicken broth.  I also increased the tomatoes to 28 oz, used 4 frozen chicken breasts, and omitted the corn.  I also used store-bought tortilla chips.  It was delicious!  Next time I might try adding in a few more veggies but it is definitely great as-is as well.

I like mine spicy so I doubled the chili powder, and I added an extra garlic clove.  Instead of canned chilies, I diced a fresh jalapeno.  I could have added one more jalapeno honestly.  The recipe calls for 1 tsp of salt, but it probably needs 2.  Make sure you squeeze lime juice when serving; it makes the world of difference.  I would also suggest topping it off with real Mexican cheese like queso blanco, which is similar to Monterrey jack.

This was fantabulous!!!!  I left out the enchilada sauce, threw in 2-3 frozen chicken breasts and let the cooker do its thing.  Have made this several times and always get rave reviews.  With the weather turning colder, ready to make another batch very soon.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I made the following adjustments:  

2 large cans imported Italian tomatoes with sauce (more flavorful) instead of green chiles
4-5 chiles in adobo sauce (added some of the sauce as well)
1 box chicken stock (no water)
Doubled the cumin & chile powder 
~ 7-8 cloves garlic pressed
4 chicken breasts.

I brown the onions in olive oil in a cast iron skillet first (add garlic for last minute) before adding to slow cooker.  This adds a smoky flavor.  We like lots of tomatoes so the 2 cans might may be overkill for some.  My adjustments pretty much double the recipe.  Like others, I add the chicken breasts thawed but raw and let it cook 6-7 hours, shredding chicken after 3-4 hours.  I also mash the fomatoes before adding them.  Yummers.  We eat it for days.
 
This recipe gets rave reviews from family/friends.  We are native Texans/ transplanted North Carolinians so I have to do my own Mexican.  This is a first-rate soup.  You will spoil your family where they don't want restaurant tortilla soup!

I love this recipe. I decrease the water (to about a cup) and add an additional can of enchilada sauce. I also add 3 cans of chopped green chiles instead of one.  I buy the tortilla strips instead of making my own . This soup always is a hit when I make it.  I serve with cheese, sour cream on  the side  and lime juice (adding a splash of lime juice to your bowl really adds to the flavor). Serve with bread (either Italian or French).  This soup is yummy.

This was a great recipe! My family loved it! Oh! and there's no need to pre-cook the chicken, I threw all the ingredients in there with the raw chicken and the chicken was so soft it fell apart. I have made this recipe in my Dutch oven and it turns out just as good.

This was so, so good. I will confess that I usually put my own twist on everything I make. I prepared this dish as written, and the whole family loved it! It is better than any restaurant soup I have tried. So simple to assemble.  I was actually on a huge budget this week, had leftover chicken and most other ingredients on hand. The homemade tortilla strips are out of this world! (I did season those after I brushed with oil and before baking). I think I may always make my own chips from this point on. This is a keeper. For sure!

Turned out even better than I thought it would!  I love chicken tortilla soup in restaurants but have never attempted it at home.  I tweaked a few things based off reviews here and what I had in the house:  1.) Like others said, no need to cook the chicken first.  I threw in 2 large chicken breasts, partially thawed then shredded them up after they were cooked in the soup. 2.)  Added 1 can of broth plus the 2 cups of water...then got nervous it would taste too watery, so I threw in a chicken bouillon cube for some extra flavor 3.)  Had a ton of jalapenos and tomatoes from my garden so I used them instead of canned tomatoes and green chiles and 4.) not a fan of corn so I subbed a can of black beans and added some chopped celery for extra veggies.  I also used store bought tortilla strips (found by the croutons) instead of making my own.  I'm surprised seeing anyone call this recipe bland!  The result was a very flavorful restaurant-quality soup that even my husband (who loves everything as spicy as possible) really enjoyed.

Wow! My family loved this recipe. It is so tasty and easy to make as a busy weekday meal. I added a can of black beans and Trader Joe's precooked brown rice which added to its heartiness. I also used corn starch to thicken it just a little. This will be in my regular rotation of meals throughout the fall and winter for sure.

I love this recipe, but I don't use it as soup.  My husband and I drain the broth off, and use it as taco filling. I also omit the corn, and ad a can of black beans. My husband doesn't like the sweetness corn adds to things. I've tried it as soup, and like it, but I enjoy it much more as a filling in a warmed corn tortilla. Very easy, and very yummy.

This was good. I cooked it on high, and thought the onions may have been a little firmer than I would have liked. Maybe sautéing them a bit before putting them in the crock pot would have been a good idea.

Great recipe! I usually make extra to freeze for an easy weeknight meal. Great topped with shredded cheddar and served with cornbread or tortilla chips. (I just buy tortilla chips instead of making them.)

One of the best "cheater" recipes I've ever had.  Thanks for sharing!  One suggestion, when I garnish each bowl, I make a little raft of tortilla chips on top of the soup, and top it with a dallop of sour cream, diced avocado and chopped cilantro.  The chips retain some crunch and the presentation is beautiful.

I LOVED this recipe after a few adjustments:
Left out the 2 cups of water
Used frozen raw chicken breasts
Added 1 can of black beans at the end

The chicken shredded perfectly after 6 1/2 hrs. The soup turned ou fresh and flavorful. Topped it off with avocado and sour cream.  Will definitely be making this again!

I have to admit, I used green enchilada sauce since that's what I had in the pantry (which I didn't realize until I started throwing everything together).  Even so, it turned out pretty tasty!  A little on the bland side, but easy to kick up a notch with some more spices.  Don't forget the cheese and lots-o tortillas when you enjoy. :)

I loved the flavors! It was just the right spice level for me, but one of my friends thought it was a bit spicy. However, after putting a dollop of sour cream inside she said it was perfect (it lowers the spice level). 

Personally, I would have liked it to be a bit thicker. I think next time I'm either going to use less water or add some sort of thickening agent.

I give this recipe five stars for the idea and concept.... anyone that cooks knows their preferences and how much work they want to put into it and can make adjustments from there.. since we are using a slow cooker, I used raw chicken.. I am married to a Mexican and he prefers fresh so we just used a chicken we raised... also used tomatoes cilantro garlic onion and chilis from our garden... just chopped them up and let it cook all day... made my own enchilada sause with chili ancho... and the tortilla strips are amazing when you make them from hand made tortillas... added black beans that i had washed and sorted.... they cook in plenty of time to not have to use canned... and used fresh corn as well... just shaved it off the cob... it is more work to eat fresh, but ohhhhh so rewarding.... the taste was absolutely amazing... we just served it with jazmine rice.... smelled great and the kids and husband loved it! not to mention my brother in law who is from Guatemala... so all in all ... very good!

I love this recipe and have made it a number of times.  I live in Mexico and have served this to my Mexican friends to rave reviews.  I used my own enchilada salsa, though.  You can find my video on how to make that salsa at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b19BPRoBcFc

Enjoy!

This was awesome! Great flavor, and I love that most of the ingredients are things I keep on hand anyway. Probably next time I make, I'll add some black beans, but it's tastey without them. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is delicious and flavorful. A shot of lime juice right before serving and adding black beans really diversified the flavors.

Have made this several times now and each time everyone loves it. It is so easy and pretty much fail proof. I put in extra chicken broth in leiu of water and the raw chicken is like others suggest. So good!

Wow, I've never tried making homemade tortilla soup.  This turned out better than I expected.  I did throw in raw chicken breasts and shredded about 20 minutes before serving; worked fine.  Glad I did add the splash of lime juice, it really gave it a nice kick.  Did the short cut and used bagged chips.  Will make this again.

Good mix of flavors, but I have to agree with the other criticisms of this recipe.  Definitely use dried chiles to make the "enchilada sauce"...
No need for a slow cook, the flavors will blend well by simmering for an hour or so on the stove...
Lastly slow cooking already cooked chicken meat results in a stringy, chewy mess.
Would make again with this ratio of ingredients (and fresh red chile sauce) but saute the onions, garlic, and spices first, then add all but the chicken, cilantro, tortillas and corn to simmer for a while before adding the remaining ingredients to heat through.

This was absolutely delicious! I did make a few very minor changes but this would still be amazing if made as is.. 1. I added 1 can of rinsed red kidney beans. 2. I did not add any salt to compensate for all of the sodium in the canned goods. 3. I used tortilla chips I already had. 4. I put 2 raw chicken breasts in, cooked on low for 4 hours, took them out and chopped them and then threw them back in. So, the flavor of this was incredible. It is most definitely a keeper and I WILL be making it again. The whole family loved it. Oh, and don't forget the avocado, cheese, and sour cream or plain Greek yogurt (healthier and just as yummy..) when serving! WOW, totally kicks the flavor into high gear! I added some diced avocado, a sprinkling of sh. cheddar and a T plain Greek yogurt to the top once in the bowl - divine!

This is absolutely one of my kids favorite meals! I've made it about 4xs now and when I say this is for dinner, everyone is very happy!

Now, for ease, I've made a couple changes, but nothing drastic. I use 1+ lb frozen, boneless, skinless chicken thighs (I just put them in the crockpot FROZEN). For the onion I use 1/4 c dried onion (because my daughter hates the texture of onions and she doesn't notice these). 32 oz chicken broth (one of those cartons). At this point, all the rest the same except I do not add the corn or cilantro yet. I cook it on high for 1-2 hours (until the chicken is fully thawed and stating to cook) then low for the rest of the day (probably low all day would be fine too.) 1-2 hours before eating I take out the chicken and shred it, add it back and add the corn and 1 can drained beans. Black and canolini so far. (Cannolini are the favorite.)

Serve in a bowl. Top with a handful of Fritos, some shredded cheese, a blop of sour cream. Omg...sooooo good!

Very good and very easy.  I did not have canned tomatoes or corn...so substituted salsa along with a can of drained black beans and a handful of brown rice.  It is one of our favorites! I like to top with shredded cheese, avocado, sour cream and corn chips.

This is SO good!  It's the second time I made it and it was just as great as the first.  The first round I couldn't find enchalada sauce at my store so I made my own.  Tedious but it was worth it.  This last time I bought the sauce and it was just as good.  I have been using a whole pound of corn instead of 10oz.  My family loves it!

Delicious!  I had leftover pork loin that I was trying to finish, so I substituted that for the chicken.  Also, since my husband does not like cilantro, I used dried cilantro (less noticeable) and went a little light.  Then I left the shaker out for anyone who wanted to add more to their bowl.  We topped the soup with a Mexican four-cheese blend and crushed tortilla chips (didn't use the corn tortillas as indicated in the recipe).  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Very good and easy. I doubled this and added black beans and used all chicken broth rather than adding water. Toward the end I realized I forgot to double the chicken broth so this was very thick. I was also having chili and made this as an alternate "low spice" option for my guests. So I just added some more enchilada sauce and called it "chicken chili". Everyone loved it and went back for seconds and thirds.

This was surprisingly simple and very flavorful.  I am keeping this as a crockpot fave.  Some reviewers complained about it being too soupy and not having enough substance.  But, I think it needs to be that way because it is tortilla soup and it needs to be soupy for the tortilla chips to soak up the soup.  The tortilla chips soaked in the soup make it what it is in my opinion!!  Oh and sour cream and fresh limes are a must!!

This soup rocks!  We didnt have green chilies so we used a 4 oz can of diced jalapenos instead which made for a deliciously spicy soup. Also added a can of black beans. Next time I will cook the chicken IN the soup to speed things up and there will Definitely be a next time.

Phenomenal!  Please try this!  Here were my changes:  I put frozen chicken in the crock pot and opened it up for shredding about 5 hours in.  I also put in extra cilantro and a squeeze of lime at that time.  I also used crushed store-bought chips and topped with sour cream, cheese, cilantro, chips, and avocado.

I don't write reviews but this was fantastic! So easy and very yummy! I used homemade chicken stock (Ina's is the best!), added a can of black beans and finely diced a half of a jalenpeno. I also cook the chicken in the soup and took out at 3.5 hours to shred. I also made the tortilla strips (very easy) and definitely a great addition to the soup!

Loved this receipe, have to admit I'm not big on canned food to make meals but, this served such a good purpose, it allowed me to rotate and use some of our older cans.   I added a bit of Queso cheese, used both diced can of tomatoes and sliced stewed tomatoes.  I increased the servings, added some brown rice, black beans, bag of corn, fresh cilantro, basil.

I like my soups hearty and I read a few reviews that stated the recipe was a bit watery (not for me).  I added a total of 3 lbs of chicken, 1 large breast was cut extremely small which helped to thicken the soup.  Just used store bought tortilla chips due to time contraints, but I'm confident it would taste a bit better if you take the extra 10 min to make some.  Will make again!

My wife made this last night and it was wonderful. We added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and that made it perfect. In addition to the tortilla strips, we topped it with some shredded cheese, sour cream, and fresh avocado. It was so good, I brought some to work for lunch today.

This is such a great tasting and simple recipe!  I  shredded left over roasted chicken (you could easily use a grocery store rotisserie chicken).  Because of time, I didn't slow-cook the soup.  Instead I heated all the ingredients to a boil, then simmered on low for 1-1.5 hours on the stove.  I didnt have whole canned tomatoes, so used canned diced (love it!).  The enchillada sauce I used was "medium" which added a nice heat.  Next time however I'll try "mild" so our toddler can enjoy the soup.  I served each bowl with a squeeze of lime, tortilla chips, shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  It tasted complete, but next time i will add cubed avocado too.  Also, next time I will add the salt at the end.  The particular canned enchilada sauce i used pushed the sodium level up a little high for my tastes.

We did like this recipe but I only gave it 4 stars because I think it should call for raw boneless chicken and fresh peppers.  I think the spices should be increased too.  I used 1/2 of fresh poblano, minced (I will use whole pepper next time) and boneless breasts and thighs.  I wanted to serve it as the main course and my family thinks soup does not a meal make so I thickened it with corn tortillas at the end and called it stew.  Also added black beans.

Made this on the stove. Used diced tomatoes, all lowsodium broth, no water or salt or bay, and doubled the spices.  Simmered for 30 min then added corn and black beans for another 15 min.  Only thing I'd do differently is make double!

This has become my all time favorite go-to soup.  I can prep it in 15 minutes and it is so good.  My alterations are as follows.  Keep in mind that we enjoy a heartier (and spicier) soup that isn't quite as brothy.  I use hot enchilada sauce and also add a can of hot Rotel.  I drain everything and eliminate the water and the bay leaf.  I put 3 very large chicken breasts in the crockpot frozen along with the ingredients through the pepper.  In my opinion, the soup needs more cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper.  After it's cooked on high for about 4 hours, I shred the chicken and add a can of black beans (drained), the corn and cilantro.  I let it cook a little while longer on low.  I have given out this recipe more than any other one ever!!  It's so good.

Excellent. I added an extra 2 tsp of cumin and a bit more chili powder. I also added 1 tbsp of canned chilis. Instead of water and chicken broth, I just added one tetra pack of chicken broth.

Wonderful recipe! Definitely a keeper! Very easy to make. I started with raw chicken diced up and put in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients. To give it more flavor I used 2 cups more chicken broth where it calls for water (cut back on salt though if yours contains salt). I also used frozen fire-roasted corn from Trader Joe's and it worked out great! Like another user suggested, definitely good with avocado slices and grated cheese on the top, lime juice and extra cilantro on top for garnish (don't skimp on the cilantro - I used an entire bunch-- gives it a more authentic mexican flavor).

I definitely scoured the other reviews to add in a few items that came up quite often. Cooked brown rice. Dollop of fat-free greek yogurt (FAGE) instead of the sour cream works beautifully. Added avocado chunks/slices. Cotija cheese from the local mercado. Tons of cumin. If you can find freshly made mole poblano paste, I'd add some to taste. Also, the canned black beans — should have drained it, but was in a hurry. Tons of garlic. Shredded a rotisserie chicken from Costco (for $4.99) and put the bones/carcass in the slow cooker. Didn't add the chicken til right before serving. Lots of bay leaves. Grabbed a pack of frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's. The 4oz can of green chile peppers was made up of jalapenos. Totally swapped out the water and chicken broth with organic chicken stock in a box from Costco.

Excellent soup. Can't stop reheating for meals, it's been my dinner for 4 nights. My "mistake" was using a 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes because it's what I had on hand. I was prepared to add more spices but didn't need more. I used a hand blender to smooth out chunks of tomato (my preference). I added 2 TBSP of pre-shredded Mexican cheese to my bowl before adding hot soup, and then put my tortilla shreds on top. Highly recommend cheese for added yumminess. Thanks for great recipe!
** Oops- Forgot to add I cooked the chicken breasts from raw in the slow cooker soup for 6 hours. Then shredded and added back for another 30 minutes. I see no point in cooking chicken prior to soup prep.
Update- A big hit at the Super Bowl Party last night. Wanted to say that I now always use a 28 oz can of tomatoes and a 14 oz can of enchilada sauce. Remove the chicken breasts and use a hand blender to make a smooth soup. Then add back shredded chicken. I serve the soup with a tray of garnishes, which include Mexican shredded cheese, green onions, tortilla crisps, and extra raw tomato.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and its so easy! To add extra spice, I usually do 1 1/2 of what each seasoning calls for and I also use HOT enchilada sauce instead of regular. I usually substitute hominy for the corn because I like the texture better. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone! I have family members that request their own batch anytime they are sick.

I make this soup all the time! It's everyones favorite!  I di however make fresh enchilada sauce, since I hate the canned version. I use a roasted chicken, homemade roasted tomatillo enchilada sauce, all chicken broth instead of water and cook it overnight. It gets better with every day you have leftovers. I make huge batches and take whatever the boyfriend doesn't eat to work!

This was delicious! I didn't have time to cook the chicken so I just added FROZEN chicken thighs into the crockpot with all the ingredients and cooked it for 8 hours on HIGH. I also added avocados and a dash of Tapatio hot sauce when serving. Yum!

We absolutely love this recipe!! I made a few changes just to make it easier. I don't use a can of diced tomatoes and a can of diced chilies. I use 1 can of Rotel tomatoes. Also, I usually toss the chicken in still frozen and come back about halfway through after it's cooked, shred it and let it cook a little longer. And I don't bake my own tortilla strips... we just use tortilla chips. When it's done, I usually sprinkle some cheese on top add some avocado and dig in! We have this frequently since it's so easy and so good.

Very good. It turn out to be too spicy for my husband so I added 1 more can of chicken broth. I omitted the water, so I used 3 cans of chicken broth, 1 chicken boullion, 1 can of corn, 1 can of black beans rinsed. I added a handful of cilantro right before i served it. It was awesome!

I followed MexicoKaren's advice and made the enchilada sauce, which was a huge improvement over the canned one. Still, I had to do a lot of doctoring up. It was watery, and lacked depth of flavor. I tripled up on the spices (cumin and chili powder), added two chicken bouillon cubes, 1T fresh chopped oregano, and a cornstarch slurry to thicken it. Only THEN did it taste good. I'll try it again using 3 skinless bone-in fresh chicken breasts and 1 quart chicken broth to boost the flavors.  The frozen chicken and frozen corn could have contributed to the wateriness, and diluted the flavors, not to mention drying out the chicken.

Only changes I made were in lieu of the 2 cups of water and frozen corn, used a can of corn with juice and a 1 1/2 more of the chicken broth. NO WATER!  also,  in addition to the spices, added a full pack of taco seasoning (hot & spicy), but kids thought maybe too spicy (perfect for adults who like spice though).  Very good once these changes were made!

This is exactly like the tortilla soup we often have in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico except it has more "stuff" in it.  They are kinda chintzy at the local dive that we frequent.  The only changes I made, by accident, were to add a 14 oz. can of enchilada sauce, forgot the garlic and put in 32 oz. of chicken broth for the water and broth originally called for.  I did not add the fresh cilantro until serving time.  I added 1 packet of True Lime per large serving bowl, 1 chopped avocado and used crushed store-bought tortillas to save time.  It was outstanding!

My family and I did not care for this recipe. I think the seasonings were off and the tomatoes seemed out of place.

Delicious and easy!  

Subbed 14.5 ounce can fire roasted diced tomatoes for whole peeled mashed.  

Could not find 10 ounce bag or box frozen corn so used 12 ounce.  

As others suggested I put my chicken breast in raw and about 30 minutes before serving removed and shredded the chicken.  The breasts were cooked perfectly and shredded like a dream.

A great cold weather treat that will certainly stay in my rotation.

Thanks Elena!

Full of flavor. I made this just as stated and my teenagers loved it. I made this ahead of time and then reheated in my slow cooker on warm while I was at work for my kids to enjoy after school. All they had to do is scoop, add tortilla chip crumbles and enjoy. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I halve the chili powder and cumin just because it's a tad spicy otherwise.  I usually don't bother making the tortillas (funny, I know, since it's TORTILLA soup) but serve it with corn bread instead.

Very tasty even without the enchilada sauce and bay leaves;  it might be even better with them--I just didn't have any.  I did not add as much water either--just 4 cups chicken broth total liquid--and it seemed perfect.  To make it a 5 star though I would just say add a dollop of sour cream, some cold avocados slices, a sprinkle of Monterey Jack cheese, and then a squeeze of lime in addition to the tortilla strips, of course. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe!  We're trying to eat less meat so I used half the recommended amount of chicken and added a can of white beans. I also cooked the chicken breast in the soup and then shredded it. So good...this is going into the regular rotation.

I took this soup to a potluck and it was a flop.  Two people out of 100 even dared to try it. Those who did try it thought it was "OK" but pretty thin.  I had some and I LOVED it.  I guess it doesn't look good enough to be enticing at a potluck.

After all the positive reviews I decided to try this recipe.  It always makes me laugh when reading the reviews and people post that the recipe was bland and had no flavor.  Well cooking is all about taste and adding seasoning until it hits your palette.   After cooking for eight hours it was missing a flavor so I added a corona beer and BAM that did the trick.    Everything else was kept the same.  I did use raw chicken breasts and they were fully cooked and tender after simmering all day.   Thanks for posting this recipe.

Easy to make and so good! I added hot sauce to my bowl for added taste but my family loved theirs just the way it came out of the slow cooker. The tortilla strips and shredded cheese added the finishing touch. Even my boyfriend said it was very good and he is incredibly hard to cook for because he doesn't like ANYTHING. Will definitely be making this soup again.

I used homemade tomatillo enchilada sauce, and cut the chili powder to 1/2 tsp., I also sauteed a chopped carrot with the onion and garlic before adding it to the slow cooker.  It is delicious!  Thanks for a great base recipe!

So so good! My family all agreed that this a recipe to make again (and again). Super easy! Didn't change a thing except cook the chicken breast right in the crock and then shredded before serving. Taste is great and spice level is perfect.

I didn't have cilantro so I left that out. I also used store bought tortilla chips and added a can of black beans as others suggested and sprinkled some cheese on each bowl of soup. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious!

This is good but better w mods.  Used 4 cups chicken broth, no water.  Added shredded carrots, can of black beans, diced green and yellow peppers.  Topped each bowl with bit of sour cream, shredded cheese (american/cheddar blend works best), fresh cilantro, and dash of tabasco. Good and healthy.

Yummy and easy!  I used three boneless, skinless chicken breasts and put them in uncooked.  After about three hours they were fully cooked.  I removed them, shredded them and then I returned the meat to the pot for another hour of cooking.  The soup was delicious.

4 stars for taste (very good) and an extra star for being so easy.  I basically followed the directions but for the following:  I started w/ frozen chicken breasts and just shredded it once it was done.  I subbed chix broth for water (next time I will cut back on the salt to balance it).  i used diced tomatoes , not whole peeled.  I skipped the chile peppers b/c of the kids......but next time I will just use rotel.  Added one can black beans.  Next time i will also add an extra cup of broth and adjust the spices accordingly.  It needs more broth.

This was so good, but I have to admit I made a couple of changes based on earlier reviews.  I used ALL chicken stock and no water, and I added a can of black beans.  This will be in my what-to-do-with-all-this-leftover-turkey? file for after Thanksgiving also!!  Thanks for sharing!

We all enjoyed this.  Follow the suggestions of adding black beans, one jalepeno pepper, and brown rice.  Used one can of corn, one can of cream corn b/c I had it on hand.  Make more than 2 cups prepared rice- probably 4.

So easy & really good. As many reviewers suggested I used raw chicken (1.5 lb of skinless boneless thights) to the mix in the beginning & shredded after 4 hrs on high. I also substituted a 10 oz can of diced tomatoes with chiles for the whole peeled. I didn't add the can of chiles. It's a good base recipe that can be customized. I will make this again many times!  Added guacamole & sour cream as a garnish.

Absolutely loved this soup!  So easy and delicious!  Like the others, I threw the raw chicken right in the pot and shredded it later which worked out great.  We used mild enchilada sauce but it still seemed to have a good amount of spice.  The kid thought it was too spicy!  Next time I will definitely add some black beans and probably some bell peppers as well.  This was a great and easy soup!

This is a great recipe that I turn to again and again. It is very simple to make. I do use chicken broth in the place of the water, though. The chips are easy to make as well and fun to add my own variations. I add raw chicken instead of the cooked and it falls apart perfectly into the soup.

Great basic recipe! I opted to use fire roasted tomatoes instead of regular, and beer instead of water. Overall, had a great taste and super easy to make. We'll definitely do this again!

When I make this, I like to cut up my chicken into cubes and cook it in a mixture of olive oil, hot sauce and cayenne pepper and pour it all into the crock pot when the chicken is done for a little spice. I also like to add the juice of one lime. This is one of my favorites! I make it a lot and it freezes really well.

I used a large can of diced tomatoes and a small can of original (medium) ro-tel instead of green chile peppers. I used 2 c. of water and 1 chicken boullion cube. I also put in a can of drained chile beans and 1/4 block of velveeta.

used frozen chicken and shreaded after 4 hours.   Otherwise made as directed using medium enchalada sauce and mild chilis.  The soup had just the right amount of heat, very flavorful and satisfying.  Everyone loved it.  This is a fantastic recipe and so easy!  thanks for sharing!!!

This soup is absolutely amazing. The only thing I changed was I used two frozen chicken breasts at the beginning, and shredded them at the end. Awesome.

This Chicken Tortilla Soup is the best recipe ever!  I get 5 star compliments on it from friends and family, and I've shared it numerous times.  I use a rotisserie chicken.  Other than that, I follow the recipe and it always turns out GREAT!

Looking for perfection? I think I found it with a few changes. I used a large/26 oz can of tomatoes with the juice, a 32 oz box of low sod chx broth instead of the water + broth, bumped up the cumin and chili powder to 1 1/2 t each, used a whole 16 oz bag of corn, added a couple teaspoons of worcesterchire, a 1/2 t of Tastefully Simple Mexican seasoning, added an undrained can of low sodium kidney beans and didn't add the cilantro while cooking as my husband doesn't care for it. The rest I used as listed. I brought it to a boil in my dutch oven and then simmered on low for an hour or so. I topped all the bowls with a generous squeeze of lime, cilantro for mine and just crumbled up a few black corn tortilla chips on top. Seriously, really great and good for you, too! Highly recommend it whether you do it as is or with a few changes. Yummo!

Use 2-3 chicken breasts, put raw whole breasts in with other ingredients and shred them 3 hours later. bagged tortilla chips work fine.

I made this for the third or fourth time, used red enchalada sauce this time and it was spicer. Better with the green enchalada sauce, more mild in flavor,  I used browned chicken legs so that my kids could have them on the side. They like to eat "chicken on the bone" as they call it. My mom loved this soup too, she had tasted it for the first time. My best friend makes it too. So easy and a great recipe for leftover baked or rotisserie chicken.

Fabulous soup!  The whole family loved it!  I did serve it with two tablespoons of brown rice in the bottom of each bowl as other reviewers suggested - good tip!  Making the tortilla strips didn't work out the best; I suggest checking them after 7 minutes so they don't burn like mine did.  I always have corn tortilla chips on hand so that's what we ended up using.  Worked well.

I love this recipe - I make it all the time. I actually cook my chicken (whole) in the crockpot, take the meat off, and keep it in the freezer for anytime I need cooked chicken. Be sure to make your own tortillas for the top...take a flour tortilla and fry in oil in skillet until golden and puffed. Cut into strips with a pizza cutter....so much better than corn chips or  tortilla chips on  top - really makes it super yummy....also, add a dollop of sour cream. YUM!

This soup is amazing. I use turkey cutlets and veggie broth instead of the chicken. The turkey cooked into the crockpot; I skipped the precooking step as other reviewers suggested. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a very simple and easy to prepare dish. It is better and more healthy than any restaurant version that I have tried. I did add shredded Colby jack to each serving at the table. I served an Argentine Pinot Noir which paired very well. I also think a mild Shiraz would also work well. This is now in our main recipe box.

Thought the recipe tasted really flavorful. I made recipe as the author specified. Used rotisserie chicken and medium enchilada sauce. Will definitely make again! Only change will be the type of tomatoes maybe diced or stewed. I hate having big clumps not a big tomato fan either though..

I followed the others reviewers advice and dumped 2 frozen chicken breasts in at the beginning.  I set it on low for 10 hours.  The chicken was very tender and super easy to shred when the soup was done.  I also only used chicken broth, no water.  It was very very good, better then some Mexican restaurants in town. :)

This was an easy recipe and it came out really delicious once I changed it up a bit to fit my family's taste. I threw everything in the crock pot, including 2 large whole frozen chicken breasts, and let it cook all day. I omitted about 1/4 cup of the broth since some water would come out of the chicken as it defrosted & cooked. I shreded the chicken & threw it back in to absorb the flavors of the soup about 30-45 minutes before serving. I didn't have a fresh onion on hand so I used about 3 tablespoons of dehydrated onion flake and it worked fine. I added a 10 oz (I think) can of Original Rotel and 1 packet of Mahatma Spanish Rice mix (with the seasonings) to the soup. It gave the dish a little more flavor and texture. Also, instead of mashing whole tomatoes I used diced tomatoes. My family and friends loved it, so it's now in my regular monthly rotation for the colder months.

Man, this recipe has become one of my favorites, so easy, it is literally dump and go.  I do not cook the chicken ahead of time, cooking the whole thing on low all day cooks the chicken thoroughly and it shreds easily right before serving.  Oh, and of course, I just use store bought chips.

So delicious! Perfect Spice!! I garnished with a dollip of sour cream, crispy tortilla strips, avacado and more cilantro. I also added a few more cups of chicken stock to make it more brothy. A new house favorite!

I added an extra 1/2 t cumin, a little extra cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice.  Even my 3 year old loved it...with cheese and "cream" on top, of course. :)

I really love this but I changed a few things. I added a can of black beans and since I am on a special diet right now (minimally processed foods and lots of other restrictions) so I didn't add enchilada sauce. Instead I did 2 cans of tomatoes and ended up having to add more of the salt, pepper, cumin, garlic, and chili powder at the end to make up for it. It probably would be more rich with the enchilada sauce.
I also cut up some raw chicken and cooked it in the soup. 
I also cooked up some rice and served the soup over rice.

Outstanding!  I did what others recommended and just put the chicken breasts in the crock pot uncooked, and shredded them an hour before serving.

I usually put everything into the crock pot the night before, stick it in the fridge, then put it on to cook the day of serving.  Still turned out fabulously!

Word of warning - if you have hungry adults, the soup will go fast, and I would double the recipe.

good, not great. WAY too salty if you add the extra salt it calls for. The recipe has enough salt with the enchilada sauce and chicken broth. Next time will use less liquid too.

Very easy and very good. Changed it up with browned chicken breast with taco seasoning. Had to add black beans and only used chicken broth. Also added just a bit of andoulli sausage.

This soup was good but not amazing.  It definitely improved when we sprinkled cheese into each bowl.  It was very healthy and easy but I felt it was missing  a little something that I couldn't put  my finger on.  Could just be my taste.  I followed the suggestions to cook whole chicken breasts in the soup for 4 hours and shred- definitely the way to go!

This is so easy and great. I dumped everything into my crock pot set it and went about my day. This is a great soup to make for a pot luck because only extras you have to bring is a bowl of chives and cheese and its a full meal.

I LOVE tortilla soup. If it is on the menu, I am ordering it. With that said, I have had some average chicken tortilla soup and some amazing chicken tortilla soup. This homemade recipe is great! Plus .... with 2011 just starting, I know I am trying to watch my sodium and calorie intake. Making your own soup allows for this.  So try this recipe, you will not be dissapointed. SUGGESTIONS: I like my soup spicey. I am a Latina who only knows spice. I bought the "hot" enchilada sauce which added a kick! Plus ... for added heartiness, I added black beans. The soup was delicious and filling. Think fiber, fiber, fiber. Enjoy!

First of all, I would like to say how EASY this recipe is! I think the recipe could call for black beans in the soup and avocado as a topper (especially for lactose intolerants like myself). Anyway, I've pre-tasted the broth, and it is AMAZINGLY tasty. Also, when I was mashing the tomatoes, I pureed and added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce which kicked up the spice and smoky flavor.   Hands down my favorite recipe of Allrecipes.com thus far!

Very good soup!  I did not use a slow cooker due to time constraints, but I doubt that would change the outcome of this recipe.  I'd have to agree with others that this is restaurant quality.

Christmas dinner appetizer for a 20 person group = all smiles.  Seriously, the most delicious soup I have ever tasted.  We did take the recommendations from other reviews: added black beans (w/jalepenos) and put uncooked chicken breasts in from the get go and shredded 4 hours in.  Make this soup!!!

I thought this soup was wonderful. I made it exactly as the recipe stated with only one minor change... I used 3 cups of water and two chicken boullion cubes. Other than that, I kept it the same. It is very liquidy without much substance, but I think it is supposed to be that way... more room for tortilla chips! This is how I prefer my tortilla soup in any case. Lots of broth, lots of chips, and lots of cheese! THis is one of the few things that I cook that I prefer over a restaurant. Some have complained about the soup, but it must just not be to their liking... I cook ALOT and there is nothing wrong with this recipe at all! IT comes out great and flavorful. If I could give it more stars, I would.

This soup was amazing!  I took the advice of the reviews and I added a can of black beans and instead of 2 cups of water, I only did one and I also did 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth instead of only one.  It turned out wonderful and my family loves it!

This is good...tastes like a vegetable soup I make with hamburger so I can't call it outstanding.  If making your own tortilla strips I recommend using the Jalepeno-Cheddar wraps to add some zing.  Blue corn chips are also good.  I will cut back on the amount of chicken broth though and add diced jalepenos to kick it up a bit.  Nice base recipe.

Have made this many times now, it's a very adaptable recipe.  I've added more tomatoes, zucchini, black/kidney beans, etc.  Every time it's still great.  I also use the tip about cooking the chicken in the soup, it's the easiest thing to do!

Definite keeper! I used chicken broth rather than the water, mild enchilada sauce but added some spice by doing 1/2 of the chopped green chile peppers and 1/2 spicy jarred jalapenos. It was just the right amount of kick! I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes rather than whole mashed. The tortilla strips, cheese and sour cream brought it all together. I also added black beans after the soup to my own portion after the soup was done because my husband does not like them. They were also a great addition.

So good! I've been fighting with the tortilla soup recipes on this site trying to find one that was just right and this is THE closest to what I want, with a couple easy tweaks. I always use chicken broth in place of water, and I made homemade enchilada sauce, a lil more than 10oz. I doubled the garlic and all seasonings and added one low sodium chicken bouillon cube. To me, Mexican food isn't right without oregano so I added 1.5 tsp. I used about half the chicken, but the full amount would be good if you like your soup very chunky. I keep hominy on the side to add to the soup bowls too. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

Great recipe!  I made it using left over cooked chicken - happy about that!  Added black beans per other reviews.  I used my immersion blender for about 5 seconds to give it a thicker consistency and it was delicious.  Served with biscuits and salad.

What an easy and delicious soup!  I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of cooking in the crock pot, I put everything in a stock pot and simmered for about an hour.  I would recommend the crock pot if you're going to be gone all day; otherwise, the stock pot is faster!  Tastes even better the second day.  Thank you!

delicious! i exchanged pork for chicken (threw in raw), used green enchilada sauce and used two chicken bouillon cubes instead of chicken broth. i separated the pork with a fork after 7 hours and the soup was complete. the flavor was on point. for those weight watchers members, this is a 4 point meal!

I made modifications to duplicate the Tortilla Soup I was craved and devoured while I was pregnant! Such as...cream of chicken soup and broth-no water (to thicken a bit), and instead of enchilada sauce taco seasoning! My favorite tortilla soup had (substance ;) large chunks of veggies: potatoes, carrots, onions, celery and black beans...not just corn!It was very hearty and filling. This recipe is my base for re-creating my favorite soup ever so I recommend being creative! Use your imagination if something doesn't look or taste the way you hoped/ think it should!This is something I have learned after trial and error and overcoming fear of the kitchen...As the cook we get to taste before we serve, right?

This is really great! I never have enchilada sauce on hand though so I just throw in a jar of salsa and it seems to do the trick!! I don't really follow the recipe anymore, just work with what I have on hand. And I put full chicken breasts in the crock then shred it after it's cooked!

Everyone liked this--old and young alike.  I used Hot enchilada sauce and people generally thought it was just right in terms of heat---even people who don't like spicy food.  Really tasted, stayed good in the fridge for several days and still tasted great when warmed up.  Will make again.

Loved this recipe!  I took the suggestion of others and simply put my uncooked chicken in the slow cooker at the beginning.  Right before serving I shredded the chicken in a separate bowl then added back to the soup.  I also didn't make my tortilla chips, but used store bought instead which was fine.  Topped with shredded cheese, a spoonful of sour cream, and cubed avocado - Yummy!

This was the first soup that I have ever made and it was AWESOME!!! I put 4 frozen chicken breasts in my crockpot on high for 3 hours, then removed and shredded and cooked for another 2 hours on low. (I threw in a can of black beans at this point)  I used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones and a carton of chicken stock and 1 1/2 cups of water. This soup was incredible, will def make again!

I made this for a small dinner party last night. The guest of honor doesn't eat gluten or dairy, so planning the meal was a bit of a challenge. Everyone loved the soup and asked for the recipe.  I used leftover chipotle fried chicken from the deli section of my grocery store; shredding the chicken was the only time-consuming step of the recipe.  It simmered nicely all day and made the house smell wonderful.  I also created a salad bar, which included a taco station.  People could add salad bar items to the soup if they liked; these included habenero shredded cheese, black beans, chopped green onions, chopped tomatoes, and sour cream.  I'll make this soup again and again.

Excellent soup I didn't use a crock pot, I cooked it on the stove slowly all day.  Also I used homeade enchlada sauce from this site which was very good.  3-4 ancho peppers seeded boiled in 3-4 cups of water with onions, garlic and salt for about 30 minutes then put all of it in a blender including water with a small can of tomato sauce blended; added directly to soup.   Also this soup goes very well with the southwestern eggrolls from this site.  Wonderful meal.

I emailed this recipe to my husband to make for dinner one day when I was working.  He followed the recipe as written and it was good but I would make the following changes:  I will use chopped tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and add another teaspoon of salt, I would cut the corn in half, and add a chopped onion and a little cayenne for more heat.

Good soup! i was worried about the amount of spices because my son doesnt like anything spicy at all....not chili...not salsa....nothing...no matter how mild....but he just ate 2 bowls of it! its very good....i used all chicken broth and no water and store bought chips.  Omit the salt...it doesnt need it especially if you use the store bought chips...they are salty enough without adding more. I forgot corn...but i know we would have liked it with the corn....ill remember for next time :)

Absolute best Chicken Tortilla Soup that I've ever had.  We like to use the white meat leftovers from our store bought rotisserie chicken for this recipe.  It's a really great meal to come home to after a long day, to take to a pot luck, or to stay home and smell it cooking on a rainy day.  Thank you very much.

I left out the enchilada sauce altogether, used canned chicken, and store-bought tortilla chips.  I can't say how "authentic" the recipe is, but I can say that it's one my absolute favorite soups (and soooo easy to make!).

I literally crave this every few weeks! I agree with several other viewers' suggestions-- black beans are a must, use chicken broth instead of water, and frozen chicken breast works JUST FINE! We did try the homemade baked tortilla strips vs./ store-bought, and it's definitely worth the extra 5 min to make the homemade. Lastly, don't skimp on the fresh cilantro and sour cream. Works equally well for both a cozy winter brunch, and a summer evening light supper. YUM!

I just made it using shredded beef roast and it tastes like a can.  Someone please post a recipe using fresh ingredients.  Eating metal can't be good.

This is very good- the only change I would make is to use flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas - I didn't care much for the taste of the tortillas, but overall it was very good. I will make it again!

Very good recipe! I modified a bit for a low sodium option. I started by put frozen chicken tenderloins on the bottom of the crock pot. The tomatoes were diced canned (no salt), no broth, 2 cups water with no salt chicken bullion, only had a half package of frozen corn & a can of (no-salt) chili beans. Chopped up some fresh spinach, put on bottom of bowl, poured soup over making sure to get one chicken tenderloin for each bowl. Garnish with a dab of sour cream, reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese & crushed reduced fat tortilla chips.

This was excellent.I am always wary of recipes that use packaged ingredients (enchilada sauce here), but it was really good and really easy to make. I followed other reviews that said to put whole, raw chicken breasts (I used 4) in at the begining and then shred with a fork,; couldn't be simpler and cuts down on clean up. The baked tortilla chips were yummy, but I would cut my strips thinner next time. I will make it again.

Loved this soup! Everyone including the hubby who is the pickiest eater in the family had seconds. I followed the recipe almost exactly....used two cans of enchilada sauce and omitted the can of tomatoes. Also, I put raw chicken right into the slow cooker along with everything else and cooked on high for four hours...the chicken was so tender and shredded easily. Oh, and I also used a large can of hominy instead of frozen corn. This recipe will be making repeat appearances at my house!

This is good! I set this up the night before and stuck it in the fridge. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and shredded them at the end of cooking. I am searching for a recipe to mimic my favorite soup from a local taqueria and this isn't it, but it IS good, easy, and reheats well. I would make this again.

This was fabulous! So easy and just spicy enough for someone who likes moderate spice. I didn't have any frozen corn on hand, so I substituted with a can of hominy (drained). Just the thing for a cold winter day!

I thought this was a great recipe!!  I actually just cooked it over the stove.  Let it simmer for 3 hours on med heat.  I took the suggestion to use a rotiserre chicken and it made it a ton easier and tasted great!  Added some avacodo and green onions when serving -- yummy!   Loved it -- wish I would have added black beans.  Next time.

This was very good and very easy to put together. I used frozen chicken breasts and then shredded them about 1/2 hour before serving. Made as written except I didn't use the full amount of chili powder. We don't care a lot for hot. Good thing I checked my tortilla strips at 10 minutes because they were starting to burn.  And, my oven usually takes longer to bake things. Will do this one again!

I make this soup constantly! We love it here! The only things I do different are: I use cayenne pepper because I didn't have chili pepper on hand at first and I just crush regular tortilla chips on top in stead of making the tortillas. Also, I add black beans. This is so savory and spicy!

Made this Sunday for Tuesday reheat.  My husband could not stop eating it!  My only change was I reduced the chili powder to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of Chipotle chili powder.  Added a nice smokey flavor.  Will make again!!

From the advice of other reviews, I added a can of black beans, a bunch of zucchini and crumbled store bought tostada shells.... sooo flavorful! I thawed and cubed about 4 large chicken breasts although I think I will add more chicken breast next time. I served it for my finace and my future in-laws and they all loved it!!!

WOW! What a great recipe! I added more chicken than it called for, also I don't like chunks of onion in my soup so I used onion flakes. LOVED IT!!! I like crockpot recipes with little to no prep and this is a great one!

This soup was excellent - my husband and children finished the entire pot in one sitting!  I added an additional tsp of cumin, pepper and chili powder. I used medium salsa in lieu of the enchilada sauce, and also added additional fresh cilantro.  To serve, I put scoop of refried beans in bowl, then added soup, sprinkled with shredded montery jack cheese and dollop of sour cream - super good!  I will add black beans the next time.

My husband and I think this is by far the best tortilla soup than any restaurant. The aroma while it cooks smells so good. The changes I made to the recipe are to just add 2 frozen chicken breasts and take them out 1/2 hr. before serving and shred. I used Las Palmas Red Enchilada Sauce, S&W Italian Style tomatoes, added triple the garlic, added 2 cans of chicken broth and omit the water, about 1 cup of black beans (soaked overnight), about 4 bay leaves, and few dashes of cayenne pepper. The heat was just perfect. Garnishes: tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, jalepeno, lime, sour cream, mexican style cheese.  I missed the review to omit the salt to lower the sodium content, which I will do next time. There's so many garnishes, the salt is really not needed. I baked the tortilla strips with cooking spray, garlic powder and cumin. The next day, however, we just ate the soup with warmed corn tortillas. The soup is very filling so get extra helpings in small batches! We thought that the tortilla strips weren't really needed and just an extra garnish. Warm tortillas work just great. There was so much leftover, I even served some over a bed of lettuce for lunch and another meal over warmed tortillas like a tostada. Definitely will be eating off it for a week.

Everyone loved this soup, even my picky eater! I tweeked the ingredients a little. I added a can of vegetarian refried beans, used creamed corn and added double the chicken. The refried beans help make it a creamier soup. I'll make this again for Superbowl!

This is a very good soup!!! I followed the directions except for a few previously mentioned changes. 1. i substituted water in recipe with chicken broth.  2. I also used 3 frozen boxed chicken breasts and shredded them toward the end of cooking time. 3. I just crumbled tostitos on top. 4. I added rice to the bowl as i served it. 5. I added black beans  Overall it was amazing, wasn't salty at all and it smells great.

I use a recipe similar to this, but I use the slow cooker only to stew the whole chicken while at work.  I remove the meat & use the stock (plus additional over the counter if needed).  I add all the same ingredients, but leave out the enchilada sauce and, cumin & chili powder add 2 pkgs of taco seasoning.  I also add 1 can of rinsed black beans &/or kidney beans, and a couple of handfulls of crushed Mega Thin tortillia chips.  The crushed tortillia chips absorbe liquid, dissolve and thicken the soup.  Also, the whole chicken & stock stock is worth the extra work involved.

The smell coming from the kitchen was so delicious when we got home and the soup was just as good. We of course were all about quick so we used tortilla chips instead of making our own and we only had green enchilada sauce so we used that instead of the red. Not only did I add fresh chopped garlic and onion, but I love garlic and onion so I added some garlic and onion powder also. Yummy!!

We thought this was great!  Next time I will try adding chunks of avacado just before serving.

Yum!  Very good, a nice amount of spice -- I added a can of black beans (rinsed) and used 1 lb. chicken tenders.  They were frozen, so I thawed them enough to cut them into chunks, then just threw them into the mix.  Worked great and was super easy to do!

Liquid enchiladas.  I just added broth and red pepper flakes and it was much more taste.  To me anyways.  I would not bake the tortilla chips for that long.  They will burn.  Try around 5 to 7 minutes.

I don't normally leave reviews but this one is worth it.  Found this the other day before they featured it.  This is restaurant quality recipe.  Bought a store rotisserie chicken easy as pie to make!  If you like tortilla soup this it the recipe.

I love Chicken Tortilla soup and found this a simple, not fuss way to a good soup.  I added 2 tbs of masa to make it slightly thicker.

While I haven't tried this exact recipe it is very similar to my own version so I'm sure it will be delish!  Instead of frozen corn I use canned Mexicorn and also add black beans.

This was just ok. A little bland and the enchilada sauce gives it a slightly odd aftertaste. I didn't cook the chicken before as other reviews suggested and it did turn out nice and tender. Next time I would leave out the enchilada sauce and maybe add more seasoning.

I thought this was excellent, DH felt it only worth 3 stars, so I gave it 4. A few minor changes I made: Used frozen chicken breasts that I shredded an hour before serving, unsalted canned corn, fat/salt free chicken broth, and added black beans. I left out the 1 tsp of salt--not needed with the enchi sauce, imo. The dispute between this soup came from the enchi sauce. DH felt it either needed to be left out (and replaced with broth) or greatly reduced to make the soup more authentic. He also felt it needed a squirt of lime juice. I had chips on hand that turned out to be a little stale, but worked great with the soup. I also served with sour cream and shredded cheddar.

Delish!  The only change I made was to throw in the raw chicken and shred 3 hours after it's been cooking!  So easy and so good!  I also topped with lime juice, cheese, avacado, and sour cream!  Will be making again and again!

This soup was a hit with my family of 8!  I did cook the chicken and shredded it up before adding to the crockpot, but I think I will just throw in the breasts as suggested in a previous comment and shred it up before serving next time.  I used the hot mexican chili powder instead of regular, and also set out a bottle of Tapatio hot sauce (as suggested in a previous review) for those of us who wanted to spice it up a bit.  I toasted the corn tortilla strips with garlic salt, cumin, and hot mexican chili seasoning. Everyone really liked the added flavor the strips added to the soup.   Definitely keep an eye on the tortillas.  I made 4 batches and some seemed to cook faster than others (I accidentally burned one batch).  The only other thing I would add is if you have a large family like mine, double the recipe so you can have left-overs!  We ate ours up!

So easy & satisfying! I used frozen, uncooked chicken breast, chopped up then added to the crock pot, cooking on low for 6-7 hours.  It was yummmy! Even my hubby, who doesn't like cooked tomatoes, enjoyed!

I haven't tried this as written,because I didn't have the exact ingredients, but it still came out great. I used half of a leftover rotisserie chicken, no corn, and crushed tortilla chips instead of flour tortillas, then ran the immersion blender through the crockpot. Also, since I didn't have the can of chicken broth, I used a can of cream of chicken; that also made it creamy instead of broth-like. 
It tasted great, and I do plan to repeat the recipe as written for an upcoming party. I'll update then!

Wow, this was ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! Can't wait to make it again, it was so terrific. I used diced tomatoes instead of the whole peeled; I don't care for the big chunks. I also used canned kernel corn instead of frozen and it turned out great. LOVED loved loved it, thanks for the recipe!

I read the recipe wrong and it still turned out great! I forgot the chile peppers and I bought green enchilada sauce over red--because I like it better. It was still tasty as heck! I don't have a slow cooker, so I used a regular pot and only simmered for 2 hours. Great for a cold/rainy day!

I made this last night and it was fantastic, my boyfriend loved it too. I did make a few adjustments. I added 2 serrano peppers, diced. I also omitted the water and used a 16 oz box of chicken broth (I like my soups thick). I also used a large can of green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. We like our food spicy and it was perfect, for our taste. I will be making this again. I served it with shredded cheese, sour cream, and baked Tostitos scoops chips.

very very yummy!! having it again for lunch today :) the only things I did different was I tossed in 4 frozen chicken breast and shredded then about 3 hours later, also I only used chicken stock, no water and added an extra clove of garlic oh and also used bagged tortilla chips. Next time, I think I will saute the onions first to make sure they get nice and soft. For some reason I could still kinda feel the crunch of the onion in my soup and I just can't stand it. I like the flavor, but not the crunch, lol, weird, I know. Oh and next time I will also use the tomatoes that are already diced. Oh and my 4 year old and 11 year olds ate this. I used mild sauce and they thought it was a little spicy, but they still ate it :). Then again they are part part Mexican so maybe they are just used to the spice. I'm sure I will be making this soup a lot this winter. Huge hit and super easy!! Thank you Elena!!

This is an awesome soup!  I really liked the flavor, and it was easy to put together.  I didn't have a bay leaf and I forgot the onion, but it still turned out well.  As for the chicken I used a left over rotisserie chicken from the previous nights dinner and I just stuck the whole chicken in there (bones and all) and the meat just fell off, and then I just removed the bones.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe if kinda pressed for time and love to use your slow cooker like I do. Followed the recipe except for a few changes. I used a pre cooked roaster chicken(costco)cut up, 1-7 oz.can chopped gr.chilies, 3-3/4 c. water with 1T. chicken bouillon, 2-1/2 t. cumin, 1 T. chili powder, 1-14oz. can corn, (drain, rinse) 1-15 oz. can diced tomatoes, 2-cans black beans (drain, rinse). Small hand full chopped cilantro. Omitted the salt used bouillon instead. Remember to taste and adjust spices including the salt content before serving. Add chopped cilantro shortly before serving. Serve on the side, grated cheddar cheese, lime wedges, sour cream, chopped fresh cilantro, crushed tortilla chips. And there you have it. Enjoy!

Don't use store-bought tortilla chips!  It really is very easy to just bake corn tortillas as in the recipe and the taste difference is incredible.  I used baked tortillas for dinner, then for lunch the next day I was in a hurry and packed tortilla chips.  Big difference.  Don't be lazy if you have time!  Also, this recipe was a little spicy for me, but I'm sensitive.  So if you're sensitive, you may want to make it a bit less spicy.  I could still handle it though; it was so good I couldn't stop slurping it down!!

Wow! This was super easy and tasted wonderful! I used ingredients I had on hand. Instead of frozen corn, I used a drained can of corn. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of canned whole tomatoes. I did not have chili powder, so for extra kick, I added half a cup of taco sauce. I followed other recommendations and put the frozen chicken into the crock pot. FABULOUS! I will make this again and again.

Incredible!  I made three small changes...sorry.  Added black beans, used one 32 oz. box of chicken stock instead of can of chicken broth, and cheated with tortilla chips instead of home made.  My toppings included choice of sour cream, avocado, chopped cilantro, cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.  Whole family loved it.

This soup was disappointing.  I was so excited to try this because of all the great reviews and unfortunately I was surprised to find out it was not all that great.  For one there was way too much corn and it did not have too much taste.

This was not a big hit with my family.  I've had this soup at restaurants and loved it but this wasn't anywhere close to what I've gotten before.  It was very watery and had very little flavor.

I made a double batch of this and couldn't get enough! Also shared with a friend and my daughter and they agreed it was excellent. I did use more chicken broth than water and a can of Rotel HOT tomatoes (by mistake) and was glad I did - we liked the extra spice.  Also added black beans, cannelli beans and brown rice.

This soup was great! I have made it 2 times now, the first time I made it exactly like the recipe posted. The 2nd time I made some changes, took others advice and put the chicken in frozen and shedded at the end, I used an extra can of chicken broth, no water, I used 2 cans of rotel 1 mild and 1 cilantro and lime- instead of seperate can of tomatoes and chiles. I also added black beans. MUCH better the 2nd time! I loved the flavor with the rotel (lime and cilantro rotel made a big difference). Topped with cheese, avacado, and sour cream. Used store bought chips. I will be making this again!

Great family pleaser and easy, easy, easy.  Used mild enchilada sauce due to small children and had just enough spice without taking away from the soup.  Yum!

What a wonderful and simple soup to make.  The author is right, don't let the long list of ingredients fool you!  I'm overseas and don't have access to enchilada sauce so I substituted some salsa.  I also just used a back of corn chips, but otherwise I followed the recipe closely and it was so yummy!  Thanks for the recipes, we'll keep this one!

Huge hit in our house! I used hot ortega chiles for little spicer feel and added one can of drained kidney beans with 1cup of Mexican velvetta cheese all melting so deliciously.  Also Im a big garlic lover and used 4 cloves with some celery salt. For additional topings had a some bowl of extra cilantro and onion to go with chip! ;oP

This was an excelent soup. I think women like to say the name, men pretend like they dont know what it is, but when I make this everyone goes back for seconds..............Hmmmm. I'de bet if they re-named Quiche and started calling it scrambled egg pie more people around here would be eating it. I have made my own chips and used store bought, either works fine. I have used home made enchilada suace as well as store bought and the home made is better, if you have the time and ingredients and don't mind the extra mess. I have also added black beans with good results. I like to serve with sour cream and a lime wedge.

This was so good! I made it when I was sick and couldn't do much. It was super easy. The changes I made to it was to add frozen chicken breast with all the ingredients and shred it after a few hours.  I added a can of black beans (strained and rinsed) and instead of water I added more broth.  I used green enchilada sauce. I also left out the peppers and the chili powder, I was scared it would be too spicy, I'm sensitive to spice.  You must add lemon or lime and of course avocados before serving, it makes all the difference.  Used store bought chips.  It was soooooo good!  I might add the peppers or chili powder next time just to try it out. My husband added cheese and he even liked it, hes not a soup person.  Thanks to all for the suggestions and for the recipe!

Wow, I just recently made this soup and I can't overstate how much I loved it. I changed a few things, like using all chicken broth instead of water and adding some extra serrano chiles (i like things spicy), but for the most part the recipe is right-on, and its incredibly easy to make. I followed the advice of other reviewers and just threw the chicken uncooked into the soup, and after a few hours the chicken was just falling apart, you don't even really need to shred it. My boyfriend actually said it was literally the best soup he had ever had :) but then again, he may be a little biased...

This was delicious....I omited the water and just used chicken stock and fried my tortillas in oil instead of baking them, topped with a little cheese and sour cream.  Will be making this again very soon!

Wonderful - I added black beans, used a can of Rotel and a little extra broth to stretch it.  I also used store-bought tortilla chips.  We topped it with avocado and lime.  An added bonus - we all have colds and this was just the right spice to help everyone breath and enough flavor we could taste it!

This was an excellent soup.  We served it to company for dinner and got raves all around.  I used all broth and no water, bumped up the seasoning quite a bit, and added a can of rinsed, drained black beans and some uncooked brown rice to make it a more filling, complete meal (which required the addition of more broth and therefore even more seasoning toward the end of the cooking time, as the rice absorbed a lot of the liquid).  I also threw in the chicken breasts straight from the freezer at the same time I tossed everything else in the crock pot, and shredded the chicken an hour or so before serving.  I let it go in the slow cooker about 8 - 10 hours on low.  Just prior to serving I added the juice of an entire lime to the whole pot, which made a HUGE difference in the taste -  I definitely recommend not skipping the lime juice.  We garnished with sour cream, avocado, and tortilla strips made as directed in the recipe. It made excellent leftovers for lunch the next day, and I made the last of the leftover soup into a hearty, creamy dip for tortilla chips the day after that.  It was a huge hit all around - thanks for a great, versatile recipe, Elena!

I followed this recipe exactly as every word is stated......except: instead of using chicken I used a phone. Also, instead of using all those cans and spices I called Domino's. They omitted the slow cooker and used an oven. Prep time: 3  minutes. Cook time: less than 30. Turned out delicious!  Seriously, I've never had tortilla soup before. This is a nice new meal to me.

I LOVE this recipe and will make it again and again and again.  I did two things SLIGHTLY different.  I had two Anaheim pepper to use up so I decided to make this soup.    I roasted my peppers over an open flame (my gas grill) and then put them in a paper bag for 5-10 minutes. I then peeled the skin, chopped them, and added them to the soup.  Also, I added two split chicken breasts and then shredded them about 3-4 hours later.  I garnished with some avacado (lots for me 'cause I love them!) and some Kroger Quesadilla cheese.  WE also just used up some thin tortilla chips we had leftover, instead of making our own tortilla chips.  This will be a regular rotation for our fall/winter meals and an occasional meal in the summer!

This soup was absolutely delicious!!  I did make a few changes to suit our needs (vegetarian). I used 1 can of chick peas, 1 can of brown beans with tomato sauce (both in place of the chicken), a jar of salsa and a fresh tomato (in place of the canned tomato), and veggie broth in place of the chicken broth and water.  It was so yummy!  The only other thing I changed was to add sour cream.  The kids wouldn't eat it because of the spice, but that was ok, more for my husband and myself!!

This soup is wonderful. The day before I precooked my chicken breasts in chicken broth and the chili powder in the crock and shredded it when cooled. I followed the recipe to a "T" the next day, except substituting the water for more chicken broth as others had suggested. Had friends over for dinner, we all loved it, will make again for SURE!

Great tasting and so easy to make. I threw in 2 frozen chicken breasts, after 4 hours I pulled them out and shredded them with forks, dumped them back in for 2 more hours. Let the soup sit overnight. Will be making this one again for sure. Thanks!

This soup is sooo good!  Even my mom who is a very picky eater really like it and told me five times how good it was.  We all had clean bowls at the end!  I used all chicken broth instead of water, used uncooked fresh chicken from the store, and forgot to add the green chillis but it turned out great!  I also added the cilantro with about half and hour left.  We garnished with lime juice, cheese, avocado, and light sour cream which really made it great.

This was so good and so easy!  I also skipped cooking the chicken and put a package of boneless, skinless breasts in the bottom of the crock pot and shredded them at the end.  I also used all broth and no water and crushed tomatoes (it's what I had on hand).  Very yummy!  Update: okay, I love this recipe as is, but as a variation tonight I tried it without water or chicken broth so it wouldn't be soup...and it turned out to be delicious chicken!  I melted some cheese on top.

This is awesome!! I have to wonder why some of the reviewers who hate canned ingredients and sauce would even bother trying this recipe and then complaining. All I know is I like easy and I like delicious... and this recipe is both for sure! The flavor is great, the ingredients tasted fresh, and the amounts were perfect. Only changes I made were adding a can of black beans, using canned corn, and using frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot. I also used cooking spray for the tortilla strips to save a few calories. Perfect! I will keep this in my recipe box forever.

Great soup, really easy, substituted chicken broth for the water, and spicy enchilada sauce in place of the mild.Put the chicken in raw and shredded it after it cooked.

You have to try this! Using frozen chicken breasts worked beautifully. I shredded them about 1/2 hr before serving. I followed the recipe exactly, only doubled it for my family's size. Only other addition was black beans. It was a huge hit with everyone. Since it was Saturday & I had the extra time, I made the homemade tortilla chips. I used flour tortillas as that's all I had on hand and spritzed them with lime juice and sea salt before baking. The chips, light sour cream & shredded cheese were great toppers to the soup. This truly was delicious & the house smelled so good all day while it was cooking. "Souper" easy & "souper" good.

This soup was excellent, I added a little rice, so it would be more of a meal. Also I sprayed the tortillas with Pam, and sprikled with lime juice and a little bit of sea salt before baking...yum.

This recipe was incredibly easy, and very tasty. I just threw a couple raw chicken breatss in the crockpot, instead of worrying about using cooked chicken. I shredded the chicken once its cooked. Yum!

My husband has been begging me to make a soup like this for a very long time.  We had all the ingredients in the cabinet, so I went for it, and was very pleased with the results.  I added black beans and more spices, but this is a great base to customize to your family's tastes.

Very good and very easy! I added a can of hot ro-tel and left out the cilantro (my family doesn't like it much) and it was awesome and deliciously spicy. Perfect.

Loved This one!!  I took leftover Chicken from the "Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style" recipe... And just chopped it up to use for this recipe...Wowza was it good!!    I reduced Salt to 1/4 Teaspoon and made up the difference in Black Pepper...Also to make it extend further, after the first servings of this soup have been eaten, I add some brown rice (about 1/2 cup uncooked) to the soup and let it cook for awhile longer till the rice is incorporated.  Or to save that step, you can take precooked rice, put it in a bowl and ladle the soup over it if you like...but being from New Mexico, I rarely do this unless I'm really tight on the budget, and trying to stretch my soup as far as I can.    Just letting you know that it does work...but Brown Rice tastes better than white for this purpose.    Enjoy this wonderful recipe..It's Yummy on a Chilly Evening!   PS..I leave out the corn for this recipe.

I must say I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe. It came out very bland. I had to add much more seasoning and still couldn't get it right. What a disappointment after smelling it for such a long time. It sure smelled better than it tasted.

This was easy and had great flavor! I boiled the chicken for about 5 minutes just to get the "yucky" frothy stuff out of the chicken and then I threw them in the croc pot and finished cooking them there. Shredded about an hour before the soup was served. I did make a rue with butter,flour and milk because I prefer my tortilla soup to have a slightly creamy look to it (and a tad thicker). I didn't make my own tortilla strips so I can't comment on how that would have tasted, but we used bagged tortilla chips and it was yum-mmy. Will definitely make this again.

This was great soup! I took some advice from other reviewers and just added the raw chicken breasts and shredded them before serving. Instead of doing the tortilla strips I just crumbled some tortilla chips on top of each bowl. We also had it with sour cream and cheese on top and it was excellent!!!

I love this recipe!  I added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with the juice and also add an extra cup of chicken broth to the soup.  I've made it with red and green enchilada sauce and definiately prefer the green.  I use the dark meat of a whole chicken (shredded) that I cook in my crock pot using lime, cilantro and garlic so the meat brings a nice Mexican flavor to the soup.  Yum, definately a keeper!

This recipe was simple and very good.  I baked 4 chicken breasts in the slow cooker on a spiral of foil and drained the liquid and fat.  This brought the weight down to just about a perfect pound.

I used two cans of chicken broth and no water.  I used a teaspoon od dried cilantro and then served with fresh cilantro instead of adding to the crock pot.

Next time I make this I will use a larger oval crock pot.  I made this in the 4 Quart size and it was a bit fuller than the pot should have been so I cooked it extra hours.

This soup was a major hit in our house. My husband wants it at least once a week now. The only difference I make is I add some black beans to the soup. Other than that it is wonderful, and sooooooooo easy to make!

This kind of bombed in our house. I have no idea whether our chilli powder is just sxceptionally spicy or what, but even after using only 1/2 a ts of the the chilli it was a lot spicier than expected...and we love spicy. I've had this soup before at a Mexican restaurant and remember disliking it because I felt like I had just spent my money on a bowl of broth...and the same problem exists here. I know I would be ruining the authenticity of he recipe...but I feel like it needs some substance. Maybe a few carrots, chopped green beans, and a can of black beans? And I used uncooked chicken cut into chunks, and am very glad I did. Cooked, shredded chicken in the slow cooker? Wouldn't it just completely dissolve into chicken mush? 
And I know everyone said that they went out and bought the chips...but that ended up being our favorite part. I hate tortilla chips, but these were great: crispy, not greasy at all. And of course, I couldn't stop myself from dolloping plain yogurt on top( like I do with everything) but it really tempered the spice. Overall, I liked it more than my family...just like most things I make;)

The BEST tortilla soup I've ever had! This is better than restraunt soup in my opinion. Followed recipe exactly except for the corn, we just don't like corn in soup. Delicious! We had it the next night for leftovers and it was even better! Served with sliced quesadillas (which the kids loved dipping in the soup). Family hit!

This is a fantastic recipe! I love how easy and delicious it is- I get requests for it once or twice a week! I don't use a slow-cooker, I just put it on the stove with my dutch oven and it works great. The only thing I do differently is add 2 boxes of chicken broth instead of the can and water, and I add tomatillos to the onions and a can of black beans at the end- it's delicious!!

Excellent. I used Chipotle chile powder. I was making this to freeze to save for when my kids from college come home so I didn't bother with the tortilla strips since I was just trying a bowl tonight by myself. I did garnish with tortilla chips and a little light sour cream. This is really wonderful and easy to make. The flavor is deep right out of the pot, I can only imagine how it will be after it melds. I used chicken from a precooked grocery store rotisserre chicken and mexican style stewed tomatoes.  I will make this again.

This was really good.  I'm new to cooking and I was so excited that this tasted so good for lunch for me, my fiance and his sister.  I followed advice of other reviewers and put frozen chicken breasts instead of regular or precooked and I omitted a cup of water.  I just took them out before serving and it was incredibly easy to shred them. (something I've never done before) I put it all together and cooked it over night.  I woke up just to turn off the crock pot, then let it sit there for a couple of hours until lunch time.  I turned it back on to heat back up, while I prepared the tortilla, then shredded the chicken.  
I served it with a side salad and self-serve bowls of avocado, grape tomatoes cut in half, grated mexican blend cheese, sour cream, the suggested baked corn tortillas, tabasco sauce and medium salsa.  It was fun and like tacos or something, everyone could doctor it to their tastes if they prefer it hot or like a lot of cheese, etc.  It really was yummy and easy.  
Not that cheap for me, because I didn't have all those spices and ingredients already, but now I have them for future recipes!  
I definitely recommend it.

Absolutely awesome!  The only changes I made were the addition of 1 can of black beans and I reduced the corn by half.  I also added about 1t of crushed red pepper, we like a little more heat.

Anytime my very, very picky kid will eat, ask for more, ask for leftovers, and ask for it to be made as soon as all of it is gone, that recipe gets 5 stars!  Thank you!  The only changes I did were to replace the tomatoes & chilis with a can of medium heat Ro-tel, used all chicken broth (no water), and purchased tortilla chips to put on top.  Oh...and I used the slow cooker (using raw chicken which easily shredded when it was done--just by stirring it!

Quick...Easy...and YUMMY!!  Just as good (maybe even better) than the Chick. Tortilla soup my husband & I buy all the time from our local grocer.  This will save us money making our own & it's just as good!!

Time Saving Tip--Omit the water & just threw in about 3 large frozen chicken breasts instead of already cooked chicken...they shredded so easily just before serving.

Didn't have a bay leaf, so I omitted it & it turned out fine.

This soup was SOOO good! I had never eaten chicken tortilla soup before so I gave this a shot...My 6 year old and 2 year old loved it! I made some homemade guacamole to serve along with sour cream and cheese. I followed everything exact expect for buying the tortilla chips. My brother who loves tortilla soup was having a birthday coming up so I made this along with the guacamole for his birthday. I did had some jal. Peppers in his because he likes heat. I also made the chips homemade for him.. They ate it up! thanks for this recipe I will def. make it again and again!

The only change I made was to use red onion instead of white or yellow. My kids and I thought the soup was great. Would use tortilla chips instead of homemade. 3/4 c- 1 c canned, rinsed black beans could be mixed in, if you like. My husband (the tortilla soup "connoisseur") said to increase the spices.  I will definitely make this again.

Very very good!  I added black beans, canned corn and used diced tomatos with green chili's.  I also substituted chicken broth for the water.  Cook the chicken in the crock pot and cut up after 4 hours on low.  I let it continue cooking for about 3 more hours. I have been looking for this recipe for a long time.  It's perfect!

I recently tried a chicken taco soup that was delicious, so I was excited to give this a try after having read such positive reviews.  I followed the recipe precisely as it was posted and it was just ok.  The flavor was a little strange, but I couldn't pinpoint whether it was the enchilada sauce or the cilantro. There wasn't a lot of bulk, and the soup was very liquid/thin.  I think if I were to try it again, I'd definitely reduce the amount of water.  My husband enjoyed it but the kids did not.

Wow! This was really easy, and very delicious! I didn't change much, other than using all chicken stock, adding some zucchini, and using chicken breast. Definitely a keeper, and a must have recipe!

Loved it!  Used Mexican Stewed Tomatoes (whirled them a few seconds in my blender to smooth out as I don't like tomato chunks in my soup).  Also used "green chili" enchilada sauce.  Just the right amount of spicy for me. Very good as leftovers as well.  Will definately make again.

This was a GREAT dinner but I made the following changes: used all chicken broth instead of water, added 1 can organic black beans and 2 small chopped zucchini. Also threw in 2 frozen chicken breasts. Cooked it on high for 4 and 1/2 hours and shredded the chicken at the end. Served it with bagged tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and sour cream. Yum!

I thought the tortilla soup was a little bit mild for my tastes; I had to add quite a bit of tabasco to get it where I felt it was spicy like I am used to. Granted, I live in Texas and have had more Mexican/Tex-Mex food than most, and I am very accustomed to spicy food. Other than that, it is a very easy recipe and quite tasty! Don't skimp on the cilantro!

I started with frozen chicken and shredded it after about three and half hours to save a step.  I also added a box of 'dirty rice' to it.  It came out more like a stew, and was one of my most popular dishes so far! Definitely a repeat recipe!!

Delish!! Takes no time to prepare. I actually prep the night before and add frozen chicken and everything else in the pot, stick in the fridge, and turn on before I leave for work in the morning. Changes: added one can of rinsed black bean, avocado slices, a few fresh chopped serranos (instead of canned green chilis), and used pre-packaged tortilla chips. It turns out perfectly every time.

This was really good. Like previous reviewers I add frozen chicken breast to the crock pot. My husband thought there was too much broth. I enjoyed it.

This is the best soup recipe I have ever made. I made it when my boyfriend's parents came over to see our new apartment and I really wanted to impress them, and they surely were impressed! It tastes so good and it doesn't take very long to make... just throw it all together and walk away, just like it says. It IS better than anything in a restaruant

Super easy!  I made this on the stove instead of the crock pot and it took 35 minutes from start to finish, including defrosting, cooking, and shredding chicken.  I bought tortilla strips to put on top instead of making my own.  My picky husband, who refuses to eat anything healthy, had two full bowls of this soup!  I will add this to the dinner rotation!!

This was great!!!!  I used chicken thighs (they were on sale) and cooked them in the crockpot along with the soup, then pulled them out and shredded them. It was wonderful!  This is totally a keeper!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes ever!!  I've made this so many times I can't even count anymore!  I like to add black beans, pink beans and chopped bell pepper to mine.  Make sure you top it off with cheese, sour cream and I like to scoop it all up with Fritos "scoops".  Soooo good!!  Everyone must try this recipe!

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times and it always turnes out great.  My family has been know to comment about a dish they didn't care for all the much as saying "Its no chicken tortilla soup".  I add the beans which has helped my family to realize they do like beans after all and replace the water with chicken stock.  Putting the frozen chicken in, in the morning works perfectly.  The only issue is that with so much really good stuff in this soup it becomes more of a stew.  You can add more liquid either water or stock if your slowcooker still has room or just add some more liquid when you eat the left overs just make sure you also add some of the spices or it will make the soup more mild.

I am very afraid of soup recipes.  If I don't like it, my husband is going to have to eat it for a week!  Not with this one!!!  This was GREAT!!  I went back for seconds.  I am not a big fan of cilantro or chili powder, they can over-power a dish, but this was perfect!  I can't wait to make again!  Top with sour cream and shredded cheddar and it is like heaven in a bowl.

I first made this for SuperBowl Sunday and my husband has requested it many times since.  I use a can of crushed tomatoes instead of mashing them myself, and I substitute a can of black beans for the corn.  I also leave out the water.  It's great!!!

This soup was excellent!  I just threw 2 frozen chicken breasts in with the rest of the ingredients in the morning, and they were cooked perfectly for shredding at the end of the day.  I didn't make my own tortilla chips, I served the soup with shredded cheese, sour cream, and avocado.  I will make this again and again!

Husband loves this. Used chicken broth and water; too much liquid, will use only broth next attempt. Added red and green bell peppers, onion, corn, black beans. Sauteed onion, chicken, and jalapeno peppers in cumin, cayenne pepper, chili pepper with hot sauce til brown before adding to pot. Served with fresh cilantro and grated Cheddar, side of corn bread.

We LOVED this soup.  The only thing I would change is using a can of crushed tomatoes in place of canned whole tomatoes that you have to mash.  They sprayed everywhere when I mashed them!

I just got a slow cooker and this was the first recipe I tried with it; I have to say it was very yummy! However, after halving the recipe (it's just my roomate and I) I made some changes since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand- Like other reviews suggested I threw in the chicken still frozen and shredded it about an hour before serving, I used 2 fresh tomatoes rather than canned, 1/3 Cup of Spicy Salsa to replace the enchilada sauce, instead of chicken broth I used tomato soup, added a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, added 1/2 Cup of black beans and topped it off with sliced avacado,and served it with cornbread...mmmm yummy!

Tasted good, I added salsa verde instead of enchilada sauce and doubled all ingredients except for the liquid which is good because there was a lot of liquid. I also added some cornmeal paste (cornmeal mixed w/water) to thicken it. o yeah, and mine was a little too spicy so I threw in 2 heaping tsp's of cocoa powder and it was just right.

I'm suprised how easy and tasty the soup is. I added a can of hominy to it. Next time i will try to mush maybe half a can of black bean to thicken the soup texture (learn that tip from a magazine).

This soup is wonderful! I threw in frozen chicken breasts (whole) and they ended up perfectly cooked. I shredded them about 20 minutes before serving, and then stirred in some half-and-half per another suggestion to add some richness. Top with shredded cheese and crumbled tortilla chips (I skipped the homemade tortilla strips) - perfect!

This is my "go-to" chicken tortilla soup.  I never bother with the tortilla strips (lazy), but I like to add black beans and/or cooked rice.  Thanks so much for the recipe Elena.

Absolutely amazing! One of the best recipes my wife and I have ever made in 13 years! We have tried several recipes like this, and have found this one to be our favorite. We did not use the enchillada sauce though; instead we used 10 oz. of garlic lime salsa from walmart. We put the tomatos, salsa, onion and green chile peppers in the blender to give the soup a thinner consistency. We also made some white rice to throw in the individual bowls of soup. Probably the best soup I have ever had. Make this - you won't regret it!

Outstanding! I made a few small changes, like adding the black beans, and since I used Ro-tel tomoatoes I did not add extra chiles. I didn't drain any of the canned goods and this was so tasty and could not be any easier.

This recipe was a hit in our family! Many copies were requested. The only changes I made were that I followed the advice to put in raw chicken (mine was even partially frozen) and cook it on low for about 4 hours. I then took it out and shredded the chicken which made the chicken very tender and fall right apart. Also, I added hot sauce (as a good Southern girl should!) which gave it a good kick. I also used all chicken broth in place of the water. Try it with Mexican cornbread! MMM!!!!!!!!

We absolutely LOVE this recipe. I do puree all the vegetables in the food processor prior to placing them in the crockpot. We also like to squeeze lime wedges into the soup before topping with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips.

This was very yummy but it seemed like an awful lot of ingredients.  Not sure it was worth the work.  It's been awhile since I've made it but looking now it doesn't look like too much work.  Perhaps I'll try again and update.

This recipe is awesome! I read several other reviews which really helped...I used 3 frozen chicken breasts, which came out nice and tender when I pulled them apart...I also added blackbeans, and a can of rotel...this is a keeper!

Excellent! Absolutely great. My husband had two huge bowls, and he always said he doesn't even like tortilla soup! I chopped everything up and mixed all the spices together the night before, to make it even faster in the morning. I also cooked the chicken in the soup like everyone else was suggesting. The chicken was very tender and easy to shred. Thank you!

Yummmmm! I loved this soup! I think  8 hrs is a bit too long to simmer in the crock pot, even on low. I used chicken thighs and they were done in about 6. I also added blackbeans to beef it up a little. This is a flavorful and easy dish. I will be making this one again for sure.

This is really great.  I made it on my stovetop and it was delicious - particularly the next day after the flavors mature.  The only changes I made were to use low-sodium chicken broth in place of half the water, and added 1 can of black beans.  The enchilada sauce really makes this dish - green or red sauce, you can't go wrong.  Next time I'll puree half the soup and return it to the soup for a thicker style.

This is my best soup yet! My husband and I really enjoyed this! I replaced the corn with black Kirby brand beans, and I added some lime juice to the crockpot as well as a tad of red pepper for some spice, and some extra garlic. VERY flavorful, and the chicken was so tender! (I just threw in raw chicken breasts and shredded them after the soup was cooked.) Cheese and sour cream are essential toppings. This soup took about 20 minutes to put everything in the crock. Simple, and tasty. You won't be disappointed.

I like strong flavors, so I omitted the water and replace it with more chicken broth. I also doubled the enchilada sauce. I used store bought tortilla chips as it is less work. I garnish it with sour cream and avocado. An excellent dish after the modification. Turns out even better than the tortilla soup at my favorite restaurant.

This soup was delicious.  I had many recipes to try but I am going to stick with this for now.  My entire family loved it. Even my 2 year old asked for more. We put a handful of cheese at the bottom of bowl before soup so it was nice and cheesy with every bite and sour cream and my mother put guacamole on top. So easy to throw together and just yummy!!

If you're looking for an easy dinner, just try this one!!  I loved this recipe for the ease of cooking!!  As per other raters, just put the frozen, raw chicken in and when you see it is done, take it out and shred it.  I normally don't like my chicken "boiled" but this was just fine.  The only reason this got four stars is that my husband liked it, but didn't RAVE about it.  Oh yeah, I used flour tortillas, instead of corn  because that is what I had, but they turned out awesome too.

I think this recipe is 5 stars when you make modifications.. don't add water! I didn't even add more chicken broth based on others reviews on how it is watery. So the only liquid I added was the one can of chicken broth and the liquid from the canned tomatoes. That's it. It was thick and delicious. It turned out very flavorful, and tasty! Also I added a can of black beans, rinsed and drained. 
The homeade tortilla strips are a nice touch, and they are also delicious! My husband said they were the best tortilla strips he's ever tasted. (I guess he'd never  had them homeade.)

I've made this a few times now, it is a new staple in my house! I add the 15 oz size enchilada sauce, as I like it spicy, and cut the water a bit, but otherwise, perfect as written. I freeze them in small ziploc cups and they are PERFECT for taking in to work on a cold day, thanks!

This was my first time making tortilla soup, and I have to say that it was super easy and DELICIOUS!!!  It's my new favorite soup!  My husband loved it too....I followed the exact directions to make 8 servings (for my husband and me) and we ate every last drop!  Definitely 5 stars!

I've made this recipe twice now. The second time, I simmered it on the stove instead of in a slow cooker. The flavor was much better cooked on the stove in my opinion. The tomato cooks down and gets less acidic and the spices blend and mellow more with stovetop cooking I think. I used the ingredients as directed except I added a can of black beans and extra chicken broth. My husband didn't like the slow cooker version, but did like it cooked on the stove. The tortilla stips really make the dish, their flavor is awesome, don't skip them!

I am well aware that this recipe doesn't need yet another rave review, but I am going to give it one anyway! The soup is simply incredible and extremly easy to make! One of the top three soups I have ever tasted -- let alone made myself!! I kept pretty close to the original recipe, with the exception of: adding chipotle in adobo sauce and jalepenos instead of green chili peppers (because I didn't have any), using homemade enchilada sauce, and using only chicken broth (no water). What I love about it the most is that it isn't just spicy, it is wonderfully flavorful too. Thanks for a great recipe, Elena!

Maybe one day I won't be so skeptical... this is very good! soup. I, too, added extra can of chicken broth (in place of water), added corn and zucchini, extra garlic and cilantro, and used HOT enchilada sauce. It was too spicy for the kids, but we loved it (we like spicy food) BUT I added a 28oz can of whole, peeled tomatoes and their juice rather than only a 15 oz can and I think that helped bring the spice down a bit. Otherwise, maybe a can of mild enchilada sauce (in addition to the hot) would have the same effect?  Also, I added the Tyson individually frozen raw chicken breasts (4)and it was a perfect amount. cooked 6 hours on Lo, 1 hour on high. (chopped the chicken before putting on high)

This is definitely a 5 star soup.  LOVED IT.  Took others advice and added a can of drained black beans, used uncooked chicken, used 3 cups chicken broth vs water and topped everyting with sour cream, shredded mexican mix cheese and sliced avocado.  this is good enough to be served in a restaurant.  Absoltuely fabulous.

This soup is awesome!  The only changes I made on the 2nd try were to drain and rinse a can of black beans, and add 2 10oz. cans of enchilada sauce to make it more "tomatoey".

This is the best soup ever!  I threw everything in a crock pot and cooked it all day and it was delicious.  I will make this again and again.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and everything came out great!

My hubby says it best "Best soup to ever cross my lips".  I made this soup egg-zactly as the recipe calls for.  The only additions I made were to top it with a dollop of sour cream, sprinkle of green onion tops, and some packaged tortilla chips when serving. We have made this twice now and the second time around we doubled so we could freeze in containers for a quick soup lunch. mmm mmm GREAT !

This was really good.  I did what others suggested and used another can of chicken broth rather than the water.  I also, in the interest of time, used a store-bought rotisserie chicken and shredded it rather than boiling or roasting my own.  I also added a can of whole pinto beans (drained) rather than black beans (I'm not a black bean fan).  Together with tortilla strips, sliced avocado and shredded cheese... YUM!

This was good.  I gave it ony 3 stars due to a few changes I would make to the recipe, as per other reviews.  Also I'm still on the hunt for the 'right' recipe.  Excellent flavor and spices.  My husband and I both thought it was too watery so I would probably add some black beans, omit the water and substitue another can of chicken broth.  Tastes great when garnished with a dollop of sour cream, generous amount of shredded cheese and some crushed tortilla chips.

This was awesome!  My family loved it, even the kids ages 9 & 11.  It was also very easy to throw in the crock pot and gobble up after the kids swim practice in the early evening!  I added  a tsp of oregano and a can of rinsed black beans with the corn to add to the nutritional content.  We put some diced avocado in the bottom of the bowl, topped it with shreded mexican cheese and store bought chips!  YUMMY!  This is a definite keeper and not to spicy for the kids!

I put frozen uncooked chicken in the crock pot as well and then shredded it after a few hours.  I didn't have any enchilada sauce so I used a bottle of beer and a packet of taco seasoning instead.  I also added two cans of black beans just because I like them.  It turned out perfectly delicious, especially with the sour cream, cheese, and tortilla strips on top.  Thanks so much for the yummy recipe!

This soup is awsome! I don't add any water and put my chicken breasts in whole, then took them out and shredded them when we were ready to eat. My husband doesn't care for whole tomatoes, so I buy the "petite cut" ones at the store and then smash those up more...he doesn't even notice.  I also put it all together the night before and refridge it and then when I go off to work just turn on the crock and throw in the chicken. I have passed this on to my friends and they love it! Super easy and YUMMMY! Thanks.

This was good. I added 1 cup brown rice and left out the corn. It definetly was not runny like other users had said, I think the rice changed the texture. I also added sour cream and avocado at the end to each bowl. I doubled the recipe because I was feeding 4 growing boys. We only had 1 serving left over.

My favorite recipe I've found yet on this site.  This soup was SO GOOD, even as leftovers.  I made it exactly as is with no adjustments and loved it.  Store bought tortilla chips may be easier, but the homemade strips were very good and not hard or time-consuming.

The only change I made to this was adding the can of black beans suggested by others.  My husband and kids loved it.  I'll make it again.  Be warned it makes lots of soup.  It's better the next day.

Excellent, but a couple of suggestions:  add 4-5 diced corn tortillas to the broth while cooking to thicken and enhance the flavor, use all chicken broth instead of any water, add black beans.  

I used leftover thanksgiving turkey shreds and it worked out just great.

This soup was awesome. Very authentic and so simple. I am not a good cook and my husband makes a chicken tortilla soup that is very time consuming and with all fresh ingredients and this one tasted as good as his. I did follow others advise and used 2 cans of rotel in place of tomatoes and green chilis. I also put in 3 cups water and 3 chicken boulions. I also placed 3 frozen chicken breasts on the top and then removed then at the end, shredded them and put them back in. This is a definate KEEPER!!!!

Took others advice and substituted 1 can of chicken broth for the water, used Rotel with green chilies, and added 2 cans drained and rinsed black beans about 1 hr before serving.  Also used leftover chicken and about a large palmfull of chopped fresh cilantro.  Wonderful.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of all the changes everyone recommended.

I made this on the stove instead of the crockpot.  It was pretty spicey probably due to the kind of enchilada sauce I used.  So I decided to add a can of cream of chicken soup and it gave it just the right flavor and also made it thicker.

Fantastic!  I had a quick and easy chicken tortilla soup recipe that everyone really liked so I wasn't even going to try this one out but I'm so glad I did.  It was easier and tastier!  I also added a can of black beans (rinsed) for the last half hour or so.  Delicious!

This soup was fabulous!  I started it late on a Friday night and let it go in the slow cooker until lunch Sat! I also used 3 frozen chicken breasts whole, used only chic. broth and added a drained and rinsed can of black beans as others have suggested.  My only personal change with to finely chop 2 canned chipotle plus a tablespoon of adobo sauce and toss them in at the beginning. (I like my mexican "muy picante")This will be a constant in my winter diet!

I loved this soup - it was so easy to make, yet tasted so good!  I used 1 can rotel instead of the tomatoes, a can of chicken broth instead of water, and added black beans.  I also went a little heavy on the cilantro, which added some extra kick!  Wonderful recipe, I'll definitely use it again!

Great recipe! I'm a newlywed and trying out new recipes, this is pretty no-fail. Loved the tips from others: I used a can of Rotel tomato & chiles, 2 cups of rice, splash of lime juice to serve. When I make it again I'm going to use blue corn chips and jack cheese to top it off.

This receipt was the BEST!  Its a healthy version also.  I used 2- 10 oz cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies and Medium enchila sauce for extra spice.  As others suggessted, I cooked the chicken in the soup.  Easy and very tasty.  Just take them out and shred when done cooking.  I also left out the water as others suggested.  It is watery until you shred the chicken and then it is a very thick delicious soup! Great Flavor!!! I ate it every day til it was gone!

This was really great. I added the chicken breast to the slow cooker, uncooked, and removed it   at the end and shredded it. I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of the onion and peppers, which worked well. I also added more chicken broth instead of the water. I cut the tortillas into strips and fried them in a small amount of oil in a frying pan. This was a great dish to come home to.

I made this recipe and it was GREAT! I followed another cook's suggestion and just added 1 lb of boneless skinless chicken breasts raw to the mixture and let the soup/crock pot cook the chicken. Then, about 30 minutes before time was up, I fished out the chicken to shred it, and then put it back in the soup. I served it with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips on top - couldn't have been easier and better!

A bit on the salty side, even for me. But WOW! I added sour cream to each bowl of soup when served, it made it creamier. YUM! A winner at my house. Thanks!

This soup was absolutely delicious. I garnished with sour cream, shredded cheddar, and avocado, along with the tortilla strips, and it was so filling and perfect on a cold, rainy day. I'll be making this one again, that is, after we finish the bucket of leftovers!

This soup is great.  I didn't have a lot of the ingredients on hand, so I had to change a few things, but all in all it turned out wonderful.  I also mixed in about a tablespoon of sour cream and a little cheese in each bowl.  The only complaint I have is it's not very filling.  I would like the base of the soup to be a little thicker.

Excellent and easy!!  I made this for a pot luck and it was a hit.  I actually used canned chicken and you couldn't tell. I also added 1 can black beans (drained) and used chicken broth instead of the water.  Instead of using tortillas, I used chips which worked just fine.  A keeper!!!

Great tasting and very easy!  I used 1 uncooked boneless skinless chicken breast, diced small, diced tomatoes instead of whole, 4 cups chicken broth and omitted the water, pinch of salt and dried cilantro, served with bought lime flavored tortilla's!  One of my new favorite soups!

Good recipe! The soup was very similiar to many chain's recipes.I cut up chicken tenders and put in uncooked as others suggested,it turned out moist and tasty. I accidentally added chili pepper instead of chili powder so it was a bit spicier than it should've been.Topped with a little cheese. A quick and tasty soup.

I have made this several times, first time added raw chicken breast simply let it cook in the soup, came out moist and tender. The next time I had some left-over Rotisserie chicken and Turkey breast in the freezer and I added it. Both ways is very good. I use a little under a box of chicken stock and no water, doubled the spices and added a tsp of Chipolte Chili pepper. Also added a can of rinsed and drained black beans. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese and fried home made tortilla chips. Perfect!

Delicious and full of flavor!  I added one can of red beans. I smashed about 1/4 of the beans and stirred them into the sauce to give the sauce some texture. My husband loved this soup, we will definitely make this again!

I made mine on the stove top and sauteed the onion, garlic and a chopped serrano before adding the other ingredients.  I also used 2 lbs of chicken and used chicken broth (homemade) in place of water and canned broth.  Nice and thick (with the added chicken) and a delicious flavor.

I really enjoyed this, but it was a tad too hot, and I like spicy food.  All my roommates thought so too... and we're in Texas!  I suggest halving the chili peppers, and maybe a little less chili powder.  I will definitely be making this again with those modifications.

Very good and easy to make.  Might be a bit too spicy for some people, but it was just right for me.  Just like many I used tortilla chips and that worked just great.  Only change I might make next time is adding potatoes.

My picky Mexican husband LOVED this soup.  It really doesn't require a slow cooker.  I made it on the stove top following the exact same recipe except that I cooked 2 raw bonless, skinless breasts in the soup.  I brought the soup up to a boil then turned the heat down to low and covered the soup until the chicken breasts were cooked through (About 1 hour).  I removed the breasts to shred the meat, placed the meat back into the soup and we were ready for dinner.  SO EASY and so yummy.  We topped ours with totilla chips, cheese and diced avacado.  It's a meal in a bowl that we will make again and again.

This was great!!  As previous reviews suggested, I cooked chicken tenderloins in the soup and shredded about 2 hours before serving.  Also, I used tortilla chips instead of cooking corn tortillas.  I omitted cilantro although I will give it a try next time.  Three out of four people stirred in sour cream, which really made the soup for me.  We also sprinkled a mexican cheese blend on top.  It was great!

This is the best thing I have ever made in my crock pot! It wasnt too spicy either, even my three year old loved it! I served it with white rice and lime wedges. Next time I will use store bought tortilla chips to top instead of baking off the corn tortillas. Thanks for the great recipe! I will definitely make this again and recommend it to others.

I really enjoyed this recipe. A lot of users complained about it being too spicy but it wasn't spicy enough for me. Probably because I used a can of mild green fire roasted peppers as it was all I could find in that size of can. However that worked out great because everyone could make it just as spicy as they desired by sprinkling in some Tapatio (hot sauce). I used two whole chicken breasts still on the bone but minus skin and cooked them right in the soup from the beginning. The chicken came out very tender and fell right off the bone. Simply take it out, shred it and plop it back in the soup. I wanted something a bit more hearty so I made some instant white rice separately and let people add in as much as they wanted. I also used store bought tortilla chips and just crushed them between my hands into my bowl. I served this with crema Mexicana and it added great dimension and flavor to the soup. And for anyone who made their soup too spicy this would really help out. I sprinkled in some shredded oaxaca cheese which was also good but a tad too mild so I’ll probably use Jack next time. I will definitely make this again. Oh and I used all chicken broth and no water. Left overs were great!

Everyone one in my family loved this except the child who doesn't like tomatoes. The only thing I changed was that instead of enchilada sauce I added a large jar of corn and black bean salsa. It was awesome! I will definitely make it again and again.

The soup was wonderful, full of flavor! I had cooked it for our family all day, but ended up bringing it to a friends house for an emergency babysitting help. Out of 11 kids and 1 adult, they ALL loved it! I am making it again tonight.

I made this today and what can I say it was outstanding. I used a jar of taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce and it turned out great. I garnished with mozza, cilantro, and sour cream.

Excellent! I did add about 1 tsp. or so more cumin. I also boiled down my own chicken and used that chicken and stock which adds great depth of flavor. Using store bought tortilla chips is great too. Sour cream, shredded jack cheese and avacado are great accompaniments. My husband who has been sick with a cold LOVED it and found it very soothing. This is a keeper!

Awesome recipe!  My husband & I loved it!  Made it exactly like the recipe except used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas. It is kind of an adult soup, my kids didn't like it.

My family loved this soup!  It wasn't too spicy for us (we love spicy), so next time I'll jazz it up a bit.  Great flavor though and so easy. I, too, will probably just use tortilla chips next time to make it that much easier.  We also topped our soup with a dollop of sour cream and used Mexican Taco cheese. Great for a dreary Fall day!!

It may not be quick, but it is the BEST!  The only thing I do differently is to boil a whole chicken, and instead of using a canned broth, which usually is fairly tasteless and salty, and  I use the broth from boiling the chicken.  I don't care for enchilada sauce in chicken tortilla soup, so I leave that out.   A plus of boiling a chicken is having a lot of good shredded chicken to add to the soup. It's perfect and exactly like they make it at my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I live in Texas and there are a lot of good Mexican restaurants here. Lol!

Great recipe.  Following suggestions of others, I cooked the chicken from frozen with all ingredients except corn and tortillas; I added those in the last hour after shredding the chicken.  I did add considerably more cumin than called for, but that might not suit all tastes.  Served with avocado and extra tortillas.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! Followed recipe exactly for my first run and we all LOVED IT!!! I doubled so we’d have leftovers and just put it on the stove. We also love to eat it with jalapeños cheese bread. DELISH. Will definitely be making again.

This was an excellent crockpot recipe that I tweaked a bit based on other recipes I have tried.  I used 1.5lbs of chicken, a 10 oz can of rotel tomatoes with green chiles, a 32 oz can of enchilada sauce due to the added 0.5 pound of meat and black beans, a 32 oz can of chicken stock instead of adding water and reduced the salt by half due to the added salt in the chicken stock, and a can of black beans.  I also put some avocado on top when serving, which added a nice creaminess to the soup.  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

Very good soup. Just the right thickness, great flavor. My changes: used all broth instead of water, added one can (drain/rinse) black beans, one chopped jalapeno. Also upped the chicken to 1.5 lbs, and used whole breasts. About two hours before serving, take out the breasts, let cool a couple minutes, then shred with a fork, dump back in. They will literally fall apart. I also added chopped green onions as a topper, in addition to cheese, lime juice, tortilla strips and avocado.

Get a nice fresh bread at the store, slice thick, toast, and serve with the soup. Makes for a nice juice soaker-upper.

BTW, this may taste too hot during cooking if you sample, but when it's served, with all the toppings, it comes out perfect, just the right spiciness.

I've made this recipe many times and it has always come out great. This time I was having a large dinner party and  I doubled the recipe. I had to cook it on the stove top., but it was no problem! For serving, I simply filled the slow cooker,  put it on low and everyone serve themselves.  Many raves!  I did cut down on the hot stuff so everyone could enjoy it!

It's in the rotation at this house! I've taken it to family functions and office potlucks, always a big hit. The only thing I do different now is using diced tomatoes with green chillies and I add a can of rinsed black beans. Enjoy!

Loved it!  Very flavorful.  I added chicken still frozen, black beans and canned jalapeños and finished it off with some cheese on top.

This is SO GOOD and easy!  Can't ask for much more than that.  Made it exactly as written, even the tortilla strips (which I should've let get a little crispier).    Made the full recipe so will have enough to freeze  for a few more meals.  Win win!!

Amazing. I used raw chicken, and will use crushed or diced tomatoes in the future just to make it easier. Highly recommend--even my pickiest child wolfed it all down! I skip the tortilla strips and cheese and just use avocado to keep this lower carb and healthier for me, but the family used all of the fixings and raved about it. So happy I gave this recipe a shot!

Warning - I am rating my version of this recipe... I put the chicken in raw as others suggested. Left out the chiles. Used minced onion. All chicken broth instead of water. Was out of corn so I added a can of black beans. Took the chicken out to shred after 4 hours on high. Tomatoes were still too chunky so I used my immersion blender to smooth it out (which yes, puréed the beans, too). Added the shredded chicken back in, along with 1 cup uncooked quinoa and a can of pinto beans. Cooked on high for another 20minutes or so, then stirred in a couple of tbsp of whipped cream cheese (trying to calm the heat down for my hubby). With the exception of the cream cheese, this was a protein packed, clean eating yummy supper. I "ruined" that with corn bread on the side, but the whole family enjoyed it. My daughter wanted thirds!!

This soup is delicious, I did make a few changes though. I used diced tomatoes, I'm not one for re inventing the wheel. I shop at Aldi and they don't sell canned green chilies but they do have diced tomatoes with chilies so I used those. As far as the chicken goes, I put frozen breasts right in the crock pot and dumped all the other ingredients over them. When the soup was done I pulled the cooked chicken out, shredded it the dumped it back in. My family loved it!

I made this pretty much exactly as called for in the recipe.  I didn't have chicken broth, so used a couple of bouillon cubes and that worked out fine. The tortilla strips were OK, but it would be just as easy to use store bought tortilla chips on top.  I served it with sour cream and avocado slices on the side so guest could top as they liked.  Now, here's a surprise... with the cost of avocados, I didn't want to risk wrapping up the leftovers in plastic wrap as they usually still turn brown.  So, I simply added them to the soup leftovers.  I just had a bowl today, 2 days in the fridge and the avocados in the soup are still nice and green!  This soup is seriously good, ever so easy and just as good as restaurant quality.

After reading numerous reviews,  I added the following.   2 T taco seasoning,  a can of black beans and a can of corn.  I squeezed half a lime in each bowl of soup and garnished with cilantro and a little Greek yogurt.   Very, very good and not time consuming at all!!!

Great easy recipe!  Used my own homemade enchilada sauce and as many organic ingredients as possible.  Cooked the chicken breast in the soup and shredded it after 2 hours.  Came out rich and delicious.  To add a little spice I used a  Mexican tomato sauce with jalapenos and to make it more creamy added an 8 oz package of low fat cream cheese at the end. Served with tortilla chips , chopped avocado and lime wedges!  My guy commented tonight "Best tortilla soup ever, hope you have some left over for lunch tomorrow~!"

I followed the recipe mostly as written, I did not use tortillas ... I went and bought Tostitos scoops and crushed them up.  The recipe did not say red or green enchilada sauce so I used red, also added some chicken stock cubes to my 2 cups of water and a can of drained black beans (based on prior reviews).  The one thing I did was to put the spices in a container the night before, chopped up the onion and stored it, and the liquid type stuff including the green chili peps into a container the night before ... along with the shredded chicken ... it was so easy to open those 4 containers and put them into the crock right before I went off to work !!! the cumin adds such a great smell and taste ... well worth the try and will definitely makes again.

Absolute best chicken tortilla soup recipe! This is so easy to put together and is by far better than any other tortilla soup I've had.  I like to add some zucchini to it just to add some more vegetables, but wouldn't change anything else! It's great on a cool fall day!

This is delicious and easy to make!  I don't bother with making the tortilla chips as directed at the end of the recipe.  I just garnish the soup with broken up, store bought chips and some cheese.  The only thing I do differently sometimes is throw in frozen chicken breasts, then I'll shred them up in the crock pot after they're cooked. Otherwise, I don't adjust anything else.  So good!!  It's a favorite of my entire family!

I live in New Mexico, and have always sought out the best tortilla soup at just about every restaurant  in Albuquerque,   This recipe ranks with some of my favorite restaurant's version of tortilla soup here.  Tastes authentic .  I double the chicken, and use fresh roasted green chile when available instead of the canned.  But if you MUST get the canned, I recommend the "hatch" brand, as that part of NM is famous for it's amazing green chile.

This is a family favorite, I use the frozen skinless chicken breasts, and I use 2 bags of Southwestern veggie mix, plus 1 can of Seasoned black beans. no enchilada sauce, and I add cumin spice, garlic and onion powder and cilantro.  No water, but extra chicken broth. I try and use one box of low sodium and one regular. Family loves this and it is healthy too.

I thought it tasted great the way it is. We can't really do spicy, so this dish was perfect with mild enchilada sauce. The one thing I will do next time is add black beans, as others have suggested. It seemed like it was missing something  and beans would probably make it perfect.

We loved this soup!  I did use crushed tomatoes instead of whole ones (we like the taste of the tomatoes in our soup, but not chunks) and I added a can of black beans.  Used flour tortillas instead of corn as that was what I had, but cooked as the recipe called for (with some seasoning salt on them)  and they really made the soup special!  Used three cooked chicken breasts from the grocery store shredded and that worked great.  Next time I will try frozen, uncooked chicken breasts as many reviewers suggested as I usually have them in my freezer.  Thanks, Elena.  We will be making this one often!

I added a rotisserie chicken and added twice as many chilies as well as more  chili powder. Adding half a lime into it while it's cooking. I didn't have time to put it in a crock pot so I just caramelized the onions and garlic first, then added the rest of the ingredients and let it boil for about 10 mins, then high simmer for 1 hour and it came out delicious! However I don't think this makes 8 servings! At least not for my family :) Will definitely make it again but double the recipe!

This recipe should be called "Cure your Cough Chicken Tortilla!" I feel like it could have used a little more salt, but I don't know if that's just because I'm sick and my taste buds are out of whack. I did make some changes. I read some of the reviews, and decided to go without adding water, and instead just put a little more enchilada sauce. I also got 2 12 oz bags of a frozen blend at the store that had corn, black beans, poblano peppers, and onions, so it made life a lot easier, as far as the onion was concerned, and I got to add beans, which was a plan anyway. I also added 2 cups of brown rice, and I felt like it thickened it up the perfect amount. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy, and I thought it might be a little too spicy with the peppers in the corn blend, and the chillies, but it actually wasn't spicy at all. Next time I'll probably add more chillies or get hotter enchilada sauce. I also just threw the chicken in the crock pot raw, shredded it about 15 mins before it was done, then tossed it back on to soak up the sauce. I loved this recipe though. It was so good, and not too much prep work at all, which was nice.

This is awesome!!!

Ok have to celebrate. Last night I cooked dinner and at the request of my hubby I tried Chicken tortilla Soup.
This all started from the need to have to cook the thawed chicken breasts that were not used as intended.
So starting at 3:00pm put the breasts in the slow cooker on high with some water and jar of salsa, then to the store to get the ingredients of the recipe below.
Now if anyone knows me and my husband you will know there are quite a few things we are picky about. So the recipe was slightly altered to meet the picky substitutions and necessity of ingredients on hand. 
1. Had to double the recipe as we had more chicken we had to cook.
2, Only one can of enchilada sauce so Added 10oz of Chunky mild salsa. 
3. Garlic wasn't really measured so heaping teaspoons for each clove needed.
4. And probably the most important - the frozen corn was replaced with corn cut off of four fresh ears of sweet corn. (No need to cook before putting in soup)

What we had was INCREDIBLE!! 
Of course topped it with shredded monterrey jack cheese and broken tortilla strips.
CAVEAT - There isn't enough juice, as this is a really really hearty soup. So I ended up adding more chicken broth and water, so had to add more seasoning.
However if you start with a rotisserie chicken you can cook this in your slow cooker real easy. We will definitely be cooking this one again!!

The perfect chicken tortilla soup! After moving from CA to MT, I have been searching for a great recipe and this is it. Didn't change a thing other than making on the stovetop instead of slow cooker. Flavor was incredible. Garnished with cilantro, greek yogurt, and chips!

Cook chicken in soup and shred at end.  Black beans are a good addition with more garlic of course.  No salt.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  We LOVE this recipe.  It is so easy and versatile.  You can use any pieces of chicken or even a rotis chicken if short on time.  Very healthy.

I love this soup! My family loves this soup! I use chicken, tomatoes and chicken broth that I have canned in quart jars, so I double the recipe and freeze half for later. I also like to add a 15 oz. can (two if doubling) of black beans. Don't skip the fresh cilantro! It makes a big difference in the flavor. I turns out almost like a stew rather than soup. We just crumble a couple tortilla chips on top of the soup rather than bake the tortillas and cut them up. Although I am sure it would be delish, I have never added cheese, avocado or lime. Just stir a little dollop of sour cream in. Yummy!

Side note: The rest of my family would not agree, but I actually prefer a bit less chicken than called for. If making this to suit my taste, I would probably use only half the amount of chicken.

This recipe is sooooo worth 5+stars!!! Every time I make it I do a double recipe so I can freeze the left overs. I don't bother shredding the chicken in the beginning, I usually put it in the crockpot straight from the freezer. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

Very good ! My son is a picky eater and he loved this soup. I added a can of black beans and increased frozen chicken to 1.5 pounds. Next time I might decrease the water by 1/2 cup or more.

I usually don't post reviews but this is amazing!!! One of my go to recipes because it's so good, easy and very figure friendly! At least try this once as is  EXCEPT just throw the raw chicken or whatever chicken in the pot to begin with, then shred at the end. I add avacado, and lime juice just before eating and  buy hand made corn tortillas to dip in the soup. Thanks!

My wife loves the recipe of all the Tortilla Soup recipes we have used to cook with; we slice up some avocado's and place in the soup when ready to eat.
I tried the cooked chicken version with the best results; experimented with uncooked chicken. Rotisserie did have the best results.

My family loved this, even my husband who is not big on soups. Followed reviews  and added 1  14-15 oz. can of unseasoned black beans and adding 2 chicken breasts frozen ( they were definitely ready to shred when time was done). My husband doesn't like spicy foods, so I reduced the spices a little. But truly a great recipe for prepping in a.m. and having dinner ready when you get home.

This was ridiculously good! And so easy! It took me seven minutes to throw all the stuff together. I took others' suggestions and just put the raw chicken straight into the slow cooker. No need to waste time cooking it ahead of time. I also just dumped the tomatoes in... Didn't mush them up or anything. I actually used skin on, bone in chicken breast halves (about two... So it was more like 1.5 pounds of chicken and it turned out great). When the whole thing was done I took the chicken out, removed the skin and bone, shredded the meat, and threw it back in. I think the skin added some much needed fatty richness to the soup and the bone added some more flavor. To save time I just topped the soup with crushed white corn tortilla chips. And shredded cheddar and extra cilantro! Definitely add avocado if you've got it! This one is a keeper! Tastes like a restaurant soup!

This is a easy soup recipe with great favors. Anytime my husband says, "this is really good", I give 5 stars. Not only is the soup a beautiful color with the enchilada sauce added but all the ingredients compliment each other perfectly. (I added a picture that proves it's beautiful color.) Even though this is a slow cooker recipe, I decided on this recipe last minute and made it up in a flash. Even without this stewing in the crock pot for hours there was no disappointment. Note: the corn tortilla strips also turned out yummy.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil just because that is my oil of choice. Don't skip out on making these! They just add something special and even stay fairly crunchy in the soup.

We enjoyed this dish.  I chose to make it on the stove-top and it turned out just as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup was delicious!  I took the advice of other review-writers, and cooked two large whole boneless chicken breasts in the crock pot to save time.  I removed them about 30 min. prior to serving the soup, shredded the chicken, and returned the shredded chicken to the mixture to simmer for the last 30 minutes or so.  I like a heartier broth, so I replaced the 2 cups of water with 2 additional cups of chicken broth.  I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used dried cilantro.  It was good, but I'm sure the soup would be even better with fresh, if available.  The crispy tortilla strips that topped off each bowl definitely added flavor.  I didn't need to leave them in the oven as long as specified- watch these closely so they don't burn!  My mother ate our leftover soup during a visit, and asked for the recipe to make it herself.  I will definitely make this again!

I loved it.  I've never tried chicken tortilla soup before but it reminded me of vegetable soup the only difference is the little spice and the chicken.  The only thing I would change is when baking the tortilla the recipe calls for 10-15 minutes (my burnt within that time).  5 minutes was good enough for me.

This is my go to for tortilla soup, I absolutely love it and so does the family. I use the HATCH enchilada sauce with green chiles so it is nice and blended. I usually buy a roasted chicken from the grocery store and shred it, just one less step I guess. We top it with avocado and Jack cheese. Delicious!

Wonderful soup! We usually skip the tortilla part and just do the soup. Very delicious and very easy. I love a recipe that calls for whole conatiners of items. 1 can of this 1 can of that, dinner!

First time making homemade soup, and this was a good choice.  I used a rotisserie chicken to save time.  It smelled so delicious slow cooking all evening!  I would suggest keeping a close eye on the tortilla strips baking in the oven, mine were done long before the 10-15 minutes listed on the recipe.....and they added a nice crunchy garnish to the soup.  I also took the suggestion from another reviewer, and added a squirt of lime and some shredded cheese (I have used reduced fat sharp cheddar, and 4 cheese Mexican, and loved each bowl) on top before serving.  This soup was worth the wait, will make again in the future!

My family enjoyed this and I will make again.  I thought 10 oz of corn was too much and I will decrease by half the next time I make it.  I used 1/2 of a small can of tomato paste instead of the tomatoes (my clan hates tomato pieces in anything) and I thought this gave the soup nice body--less watery than as written?  This soup is easily kicked up with whatever spices you like, and cheddar, lime tortilla chips, lime juice, cilantro and sour cream for garnish.

I think this recipe is great! I of course tweaked it a bit. I added I can of corn, one can of black beans, the juice of about 1 lime, and about one tablespoon tapatio. When finished I topped with shredded Mexican cheese, a dallop of sour cream, fresh sliced avocado and crushed tortilla chips on top. Its delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

The best Chicken Tortilla soup I have ever made. The second time I substituted black beans for corn and added a can of Rotel chilies with cilantro and lime. Yummy.

This is GREAT!!! you can use any kind of cooked chicken you want.  Instead of making the tortillas... I crumble up corn chips over top of prepared bowl, squeeze a little lime in it, and add shredded cheese.

This was great.  Made enchilada sauce using recipe from other rater (ancho chilis...). No water...extra chicken broth.  Will not use as much tomato next time.  

This was really good.  Can make spicier by adding extra chili powder.

Wow, great recipe! I adjusted just a few things. I put a lot more fresh cilantro in than the recipe called for. I added a small can of black chili beans. Instead of the two cups water, I used the chicken broth...no water. I used a fresh green chili instead of can. When serving I added cheese, and sour-cream to each bowl. I also used store bought tortilla chips..fast and easy. My daughter added crushed red pepper to her bowl for some added zing.

Made this for dinner last night and wow! Knocked the socks off both myself and my boyfriend. It was actually so good that I went to the grocery store this morning to restock the ingredients so that I can make it again before the weekend arrives since we killed an entire pot between the two of us! It was that good!!!

Great recipe! I made this almost exactly as written and it was one of the best chicken tortilla soups I've had. The only changes I made was to not pre-cook the chicken and I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed). Will definitely make this again and again and again!

Delicious! I followed the advice of other reviewers: added a can of black beans, used all chicken broth instead of water, and used raw chicken tenders and let them cook in the crockpot, shredding with forks with about an hour to go. This was super easy and very flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

As a note, bake your tortilla strips at 350 degrees,mi found 400 was too high a temp and burned the strips quickly.  I cubed avocado and added it to the bowl before ladling the soup for a traditional Mexican version.  Very tasty and super easy recipe, this soup is a hit!

The family love it! I made it as is and it was wonderful. Keep an eye on the tortilla strips - they may not need 10 minutes. The fresh lime gave a nice fresh kick at the end. I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch. I'm on my way to make some fresh tortilla strips right now. Great recipe!

This was really good. Very easy to throw together and had a rich flavor. I didn't expect it to be as good when I saw the uncooked ingredients in the pot. Agree with other reviewers--don't cook the chicken in advance. I threw frozen thighs in ( let everything sit at room temperature for an hour or so) and it was fine. Forgot to put the lime in at the end and I think that would have made it even better.

Super easy crock-pot meal.  I used Frozen boneless breasts from Costco and a can of Rotel, rather than the whole tomatoes and the green chilies.  Just dice up the chicken when you get home. I leave out the Cilantro as that is a love-it-or-hate-it herb...and I HATE it.  I found the broth a little thin the first time I made it, so I tossed in a handfull of crushed tortilla chips the second time.  These break down and the Masa helps to give the broth a little more body for a great mouth-feel.  Couldn't be simpler to toss it all in the crock before work and come home to a hot and tasty meal minutes after walking in the door.  Makes the house smell heavenly and inviting after a long day and leaves plenty for the three of us to take for lunch leftovers. This will go in the regular rotation.

This was a delicious way to use left over chicken. I did not cook it in a slow cooker but on the stove and it was ready after a few hours. I added black beans but any beans would do. Easy and very tasty. A hit!!!

This soup was great! I used about 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breast instead of the rotisserie, although I'm sure rotisserie would have been better. I used hominy instead of corn and added 2 more cups of chicken broth. This was perfect on the cold days we've been having lately! I will definitely be making this again!

I had no idea I would love this soup so much! I really don't eat much soup, but I had a leftover rotisserie chicken  I wanted to use up and it was a cold day (perfect for a slow cooker  meal) . I omitted the corn (which I'm sure would be delicious) and I actually omitted the tortillas  (due to laziness) and it was still wonderful. I ate this for every meal for three days. I can't wait to make it again. I served the soup with diced avocado , extra cilantro , and cheese. Great recipe! Thank you!

Whole family loved it.  Added diced zucchini because my daughter felt we needed a green vegetable.  I will say I used mild enchilada sauce. This came out mild using the called for chili powder. If you really like spicy you may want to add more spices or a stronger enchilada sauce.

Not quite sure why I didn't much care for this recipe,but I'll try. I followed the recipe true, with the only change in chicken broth. Instead of using 2 cups of water I used chicken broth in addition to the chicken broth  it asked for. I think it was a little too watery. I like my soup on the thicker side,but ok.  Maybe next time I'll forgo the 2 cups of water. Maybe the brand of enchilada sauce was wrong. I should try a different brand. It has lots of flavor. Maybe a bit too spicy for my family, but that's typical.  I added chicken that was bbq for added flavor. Even tried eating this the next day to help with the flavors, but to know avail. I'm not sure I'll try this recipe again.

Excellent! I made this as is except used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and cumin, as that was what was in my cabinet. I also added cannellini beans for extra nutrition. It is not a thick broth, but delicious as is. Baking the corn tortillas gave a nice, crunchy addition - easy too!

We thought this was VERY DELICIOUS.  Took the advise of reviewers and did not use water, but instead used all chicken broth.  Also added raw chicken breast and shredded it befor serving.  I added a dollop of sour cream for a nice presentation. Used bagged tortilla chips instead of making my own.  
Will be making this again..

Amazing soup, and it was a very easy recipe to use!  I will use this one again.  My whole family loved it and went back for seconds.  I didn't have the ready to use enchilada sauce, but had a McCor**** Enchilada sauce mix, which worked out fine.  I added a whole can of reduced sodium black beans, rinsed thoroughly, and shredded cheese for garnish.

It was really good!  The subs I did were chicken stock for the water and a squeeze of lime in each bowl when it was served.  I added rinsed canned black beans.   I also cooked the chicken breast in the soup and it shredded so easy.  I also used mild everything since I have a kid that doesn't like spicy things and she loved it. I will be adding this to my regular rotation.

This is late post but I'm thinking of making it again.  I made this last year and it was the easiest thing to put together and was so delicious!  My husband & daughters loved it.  I knew this recipe was a keeper because even my picky eater of a daughter asked for seconds!  Definitely recommend this one:)

After a little tweaking to better suit my own preferences I really liked this soup. I don't like anything too spicy so I cut out the chili peppers and cut down on the chili powder and cumin. I also added more chicken broth. I was nice to let it set in the crock pot all day and come home to a great smelling house and some tasty food :)

I chose this recipe since it had many reviews and ratings were high. Loved it,  Instead of slow cooker I boiled chicken 30 min., shredded it, put all ingredients in and simmered 30 more min., easy & delicious.

I followed what others suggestion, I put my chicken in raw, shredded at an hour before done.  OMG this was sooo amazing.  I did leave out the green chiles because I know my kids don't like spicy stuff but it was still amazing!! I used a whole box of chicken broth and a 19oz can of enchilada sauce and I just used crushed tortilla chips.  AHHHMAZING!

Absolutely delicious.  I short circuited the cooking process just a bit by throwing everything on the stove (including raw chicken) and brought it to a boil for about 30 minutes.  Then I transferred it to the crockpot and cooked on low for about 3 hours.  I took the chicken out and shredded it using my mixer and paddle attachment and returned the chicken for another hour. Yum!

We had this for dinner last night. I don't precook the chicken, I just throw the frozen breasts in there in the morning and then shred them about an hour before we eat.  I made a couple revisions, they are as follows: I didn't add the peppers, as my family doesn't like things spicy. I added a little extra chili powder and cumin to compensate for the missing peppers.  I did add a little green pepper for color also. My family LOVED it, but they thought it could have used some beans, so next time I will add some black beans.

This is great soup.  I did not have enchilada sauce so i added more cumin, chili powder, and tomato sauce.  I also added a little oregano.  I added black beans and it gave the soup a more filling feel.  Great recipe.

I used this recipe more as a basic outline substituting the closest resembling ingredients with what I had on hand. Like everyone else, I added two raw chicken breasts. I had a bad experience once with enchilada sauce so I used 8 ounces of Wolfgang Puck's arribiatta marinara sauce. I used one can of black beans drained, not rinsed and one can of corn not drained. I use one can of diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled and one green bell pepper, instead of green chilies. I added about 3 tablespoons maybe 4 of chicken paste about 4 cups of water (didn't measure) and one can of tomato paste. It was not watery at all. The rest of the spices I use were the same except I had no cilantro, I added 3 small bay leaves, I don't usually use black pepper so I didn't & I forgot to put in garlic. I am a huge garlic fan and always like a pungent garlic flavor so I always save fresh garlic until the last five or 10 minutes. This time I was so excited to taste it, I forgot to put the garlic in. I just shredded the chicken and enjoyed myself with some sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled restaurant-style tortilla chips. I still enjoyed the flavor.  My five-year-old enjoyed it as well. So glad to have another easy winter staple.

One of my favorite recipes. As with other reviewers, I throw in a frozen chicken breast in the morning and shred it later. Using tortilla chips is a bit easier, but I much prefer making strips from the corn tortillas. They really add to the flavor and texture of the soup, much more so than the chips. I also like to add a little shredded cheese as a garnish.

Have made this multiple times and family loves it and requests that I make it regularly. I use Trader Joe's canned chicken - 2 containers of it due to my teenage boys appetites; it makes it a little more hearty. They also like to add chopped green onions, sour cream and grated sharp cheddar as toppings. Although making your tortilla strips from corn tortillas is more time consuming; it is worth it. You can always shortcut by purchasing those or crumbling regular tortilla chips on top.

Yum! I was a bit pressed for time so I just simmered it on the stove for about 30-40 minutes. I also cooked the chicken by boiling it with some garlic cloves and salt - it wasn't the most tender, but it tasted good and was quick.

Super tasty. I forgot to buy tortilla chips, so I cut wheat tortillas into strips, sprayed them with olive oil spray, and baked them for about 10 min at 400 degrees. Turned out delicious!

I made this in my crock pot on low 8 hours.  I used 4 cups chicken broth and added 2 cups water with 2 tablespoons chicken base.  I added the 2 cups because I wanted to add 2 yellow squash and 1 zucchini sliced to the soup.  The soup turned out great and by son
liked it.  I used On the Border tortilla chips instead of making 
chips for the soup.  I would recommend this recipe to friends and family.

Delicious!!  I've been searching for a good tortilla soup (for my hubby) and my hunt stops here.  We both loved this soup - thanks for the recipe!  Only change I made- cut the onions in big chunks (my husband does not like onions...but I wanted them in there for flavor).  Before serving, I added Monterey Jack cheese to the bowl and topped with broken potato chips (in lieu of the tortillas). Wonderful and tasty!

I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly; only things I did different were to use fresh opposed to canned whenever possible, made my own chicken stock using raw chicken, water, and chicken flavored Better Than Bullion, and made my own enchilada sauce using the ten minute enchilada sauce recipe from site. For the stock, I cut about 1-1/2 pounds of raw chicken breast, then cooked with the water and BTB. It came out ten times better than it would by just opening and dumping cans of stuff into a crock pot. It could easily be made on the stove but I think slow cooking it marries the flavors better. If you don't like things too spicy, use about half the amount of chili peppers (and if you're using fresh, wear gloves before chopping!!!). Absolutely delicious.

This was simply amazing. I followed the directions exactly, adding a tiny bit more salt to taste and one small can of Goya black beans. I also only put half the bag of corn in. I'm more of a bean person than a corn person. Those were the only changes I made though. This soup is phenomenal. I cooked mine on HIGH from 4pm to 8:30 and had a late dinner. So good. I put the rest in tall soup containers, one for the refrigerator and the other went into the freezer. Just awesome.

I kinda redid this recipe but it was a great start.  I work full time with two children, one who is disabled. I am thankful for all the help from people who post recipes and try to cut down on time spent in the kitchen so I can spend it with my family. Make broth and enchilada sauce etc sorry. I also added raw chicken, 2 cans black beans and only chicken broth, no water. Sprinkled a little cheese and warmed chips on top. Family loved it and still had time to play Candyland!

This was good, but I think I'd try another recipe for tortilla soup next time. Didn't have the flavor I was looking for.

Flavor is okay but seemed too watery and it overall didn't wow me. It was fast and easy to prepare in the morning which is great, but I have other favorite taco soup recipes that I'll stick with. I'd also recommend adding beans to add more substance to the chicken and corn.

A slow cooker recipe that's good enough to invite guests to dinner for!  Can't beat that!  This is a wonderful recipe with a very authentic flavor.  I cheat and use tortilla chips, but other than that I love the recipe as-is.

I followed the recipe and although the flavors were great, the soup was extremely salty. We are not a low sodium family but we actually had trouble eating this. I will definitely make this again but cut the salt way down! Can always add more at the end.

This is such a yummy soup!! I took the advice of other reviews and added a can of rinsed black beans and the soup turned out great. I did accidentally buy green enchilada soup though, but I think it added a nice zest. I'll definitely be making this again.

I just attempted making this soup for thr first time and WOW! Delicious and super easy. I made my own broth and added a scoop of cooked white rice to each bowl. Trust me, do not leave out the black beans(El Mexicano brand) and corn. Fresh tortilla strips is the best way to go!

The flavor was good, but it was too salty and too spicy for me. I did not add the salt or the green chilies and used half the chili powder. I added some elbow macaroni and chili beans. It thickened up nicely in the slow cooker like a thick chili. Not sure if I would make it again.

I make this recipe all the time. As somebody else recommended, I add frozen chicken breasts instead of the cooked chicken. I also add a can of (drained) white kidney beans or similar for the last hour or so, at the same time as I shred the chicken and add the corn. It is also great for leftovers, no problems freezing it for a fast dinner another time. Thanks for the recipe :-)!!

This is a great,"what do I have in my pantry?" recipe.  Didn't have chicken or broth but had a 3.5+lb pork shoulder in  my freezer. I seared the pork in garlic salt and chili powder, added heavy dashes of seasoned salt, sea salt and smoked paprika to about 3 cups of water and tossed it in the crock pot. Seared up 3 slices of thick cut bacon and covered the top of the pork with it and added the rest of the drippings to the pot.  Cooked on low over night, switching to warm around 4 a.m.  Shredded the meat with tongs in the morning. Found some bell pepper/onion mix in my freezer that I sauteed with garlic and cumin then added to the pot.  Used canned Mexican corn, seasoned black beans, red enchilada sauce (though considered adding green).  Used 2 cans of Ro*tel and added two dried chipotle peppers to the pot.  I did time and a half the recipe since there was so much meat.  Garnish with cilantro, avocado, sharp cheddar and lime juice.  I bought tostadas and Salsa Verde Doritos for garnish, too!  

I disagree with other reviews that said this was too spicy or too watery.  But again, i changed the recipe quite a bit.  I do agree, however, with a reviewer who said it doesn't need to be a crock pot recipe. You can EASILY do this on the stove top in 30 minutes.  Buy a roasted chicken and shred it up, toss everything else in a stock pot and bring to a boil.  The flavors come together nicely once the soup has sat over night as well. Makes great leftovers!

Prepared this for the family last night. I followed the suggestions from many reviewers and tossed uncooked chicken into the crockpot. About midway through the day, I took the meat out and shredded it, returning it to the pot for the rest of the day. 

Everybody went back for seconds. That was all I needed know. Yep, this one is a winner!

I'm sure, as some of the more critical reviewers point out, it could be improved by changing out certain ingredients, but for those of us who don't have enough time to make enchilada sauce from scratch or prepare fresh tomatoes, recipes like this are a such a welcome gift!

Substituted green enchilada sauce for the red and added twice the cumin and chili powder and added a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  Used only chicken stock instead of the water.  Results were amazing.  Used store bought tortilla chips and added cooked rice to the bottom of the bowl.  Topped with more cilantro, cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.  Will definitely make this again.

I think this is missing some essential umami depth, but I couldn't quite find the right add to make me feel I got "it." (I tried a bit of tomato paste, which helped.) It's still delicious, though. I doubled the recipe, used about 1.5 quarts of chicken stock instead of water, I sauteed the onions first and then added about 6 good sized cloves of garlic to the saute and them added to the pot. I used uncooked chicken breasts that I pulled out to shred about about 2.5 hours (and then added back in for 2.5 more hours). I also served over Cilantro Lime Rice from this site, which was delish, along with monterey jack cheese, avocado slices, generous squeeze of lime per bowl, extra cilantro, and sour cream. I'd definitely make again but I'd try to figure out the missing ingredient for the depth I was looking for. Maybe chipoltes in adobo...

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  A few MINOR tweaks - instead of water/chicken broth, use a whole carton of chicken broth (4 cups), why not add the extra flavor?  I also thrown in a can each of rinsed pinto beans and black beans to make it more hearty.  This is one of our very favorites!

This soup is wonderful!  It is a staple in our house now, thanks!  I almost have it memorized, so now I can make it without checking back AND when I am at the store I automatically know if I need anything to make it.  
I usually don't add any water, just all broth.  My husband is hispanic, so he needs his beans, lol!  That said I typically cook up some beans the night before and add about 1 cup to the soup.  I typically add diced tomatoes just cause I have them around the house.  I always throw the chicken in frozen, it shreds beautifully when done cooking.  Other than that I keep it pretty much the same.  I sometimes use corn, or depending on the mood I throw whatever veggies I have on hand.  I made it with frozen peas once and I was concerned that it would be gross but it came out just great.  I don't think there is any way to mess this one up.  Simple and worth it every time.

This dish came out great! The only thing I changed was to put the chicken breast uncooked in the crock pot with all the ingredients. When it was ready I simply pulled the chicken apart in the crock pot with a fork. It was so tender it practically shredded itself.

Deeeelish!  Instead of making this in the slow cooker I used my pressure cooker and cooked it for about 35 minutes.  Also, I didn't add the cilantro until the end as a garnish.  I also garnished with shredded cheese, sour cream and avocado.  It was AMAZING!!

I don't usually leave reviews but this was so amazing I had to share. First of all, this was SOOOO GOOD I can't believe I made it. I usually suck at cooking. This soup was better than anything I have had at any restaurant. Here are a few pointers I wanted to share: you should definitely taste the broth as you start to mix things up, don't follow this recipe to a T or it will be bland. I used semi-thawed chicken breasts and took em out and shredded them and then added them back in 30 mins before the slow cooker turned off. I had to add more Enchilada Sauce and spices cuz it was bland originally, next time I would probably only use 1 cup of water and not two. Chop up your onions super small, you don't want to eat big chunks in your soup. I topped the soup off with Green Onions,Avocado, Cilantro, Sour Creme, Cheese and Thick cut tortilla chops from the store. So amazing!

With a few modifications this is an excellent recipe, but given the amount of tweaking that I had to do (based on previous reviewers suggestions) I can only give this recipe 4 stars. Changes I made: Started with raw boneless chicken breasts, after two hours on high they were done and ready to be shredded, I added the chicken back into the slow cooker with a can of corn (frozen is nasty) and a can of black beans. Doubled the cumin and chili powder and used all chicken broth, no water. The cooking times on this are way too long. Like I said, after 2 hours on High, a raw chicken breast was done and ready to shred, not sure how long it would have taken on Low. I also didn't add the cilantro to the slow cooker, I garnished the soup with it, I really like fresh cilantro, as opposed to cooked to death cilantro. And, since I'm doing the low carb thing, I served this on a bad of cabbage, and didn't make the tortilla strips. This recipe is super easy, I will definitely be using it again.

OMG this recipe is soo good.. I did throw a handful of raw pinto beans to help thicken up soup and instead of baking the tortilla chips I cut them into small squares and put directly in soup in the last hour..to soften them up..that's how we're use to eating it... It was a big hit though..Hubby ate it for days!!

For the chicken, I used three breasts that I put in boiling water with salt, pepper, garlic salt and Adobo seasoning. When cooked, I then shredded them with a fork. I also added one chopped zucchini and 2-3 fresh jalapeños. Also, a can of black beans, and used canned corn instead of frozen.  This turned out amazing!!

I made this on the stovetop (I cooked the chicken first and cut up into small bite-size pieces) and it came out great!  Watch the cumin and chili powder and green chili peppers, as it gets very spicy very fast.  I thought it might so only put a couple of dashes of cumin and chili powder in.  I used all chicken broth and hardly any water.  Definitely add lime juice.  We had leftovers for lunch today and it tasted even better. I'll make this soup all winter long.  Thanks for great recipe that doesn't HAVE to go in the slow cooker.

This was so good and so full of flavor! I will def be making again for a cold winter's night. Like many others, I used only chicken broth and added in a can of black beans...delish! My only complaint (and more of a preference) is the whole tomatoes - I didn't care for them much. Next time I will use diced tomatoes or Rotel. Thank you for a great recipe!

This soup was awesome!  I doubled recipe for a school luncheon but tweaked only slightly due to other reviews. Threw frozen chicken breasts in crockpot, used cans of diced tomatoes w/jalapeño, no water but instead a 32 oz box Swansons Mexican Tortilla infused broth plus 1 can reg chicken broth, and added 2 cans rinsed black beans. Cooked overnite and in morning shredded chicken (which falls apart easily) and returned to crockpot. Used store bought tortilla chips slightly crushed which tasted fine. Entire crockpot was eaten up and many requests for recipe. Will make again and again!!

Great as written!  Just make sure the enchilada sauce is "mild" if you have kids eating it.  My 6 yr old and 3 yr old loved it.  Only thing I changed was I added 1/3 of a block velveta to it closer to the end,  Made it creamier!

The soup without the tortilla strips gets 5 stars!  I used hot enchilada sauce and loved the spicy flavor of the broth.  The tortilla strips are bland. Will definitely make the soup again just will not include the tortilla strips!

Made this over and over again. My family loves it. I sub some items to make it easier. I used diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of whole peeled. I double spices, add entire bunch of cilantro chopped and use chicken broth instead of water. At the end I dump 2 cans black beans rinse. Beans makes this soup a bit more hearty. You cant make a mistake with this recipe and what you like!!

Ive made this 3 times already & I like it best with red enchilada sauce. Dont forget the cilantro or think you can leave it out!! Then again I love cilantro & every time I've put it in the soup I put extra & then fresh once it's done. Im going to try dried cilantro next time, its a pain buying an entire bundle for 1 tbsp.

I made this on Monday with a few changes and it came out EXCELLENT! I did not brown the chicken first - that is a waste of time and will make little difference in flavor. Instead, I threw it into the bottom of the crock pot raw. I used a fresh, finely diced tomato in place of the peeled, mashed tomato. I did not have enchilada sauce on hand so I used a small can of tomato paste, a guajillo (dried, stemmed, seeded), and additional (maybe about 2x the amount) cumin, chili powder, and black pepper. I also added cayenne pepper, dried cilantro, red and yellow bell pepper, and celery. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and shredded the chicken with forks after about 7 hours, but you can also cook it on high for 4 hours. I served it up with fresh sliced avocados, "Mexican" blend cheese, sour cream and salsa. (Don't forget the fresh margaritas!) This came out so awesome, we each had two servings that night and ate left overs the next day. It is now Wednesday and it will be gone by lunch for sure!

Got this recipe the day I found out that my broken fridge was going to need another week for the repair parts.  Lost everything and no way to store new groceries so I delighted in the made from cans part which I would usually be too snobby to try!!  Didn't read the reviews in advance but had no chicken or corn so substituted a can of black beans.  Doubled the cumin and chili powder and used crushed restaurant chips which I prefer.  Garden had fresh cilantro so that was my garnish.  Low expectations but I was still blown away, delish!!  Will be making this the rest of my life and working on my food snob issues!!

This was okay. My preference is thick over brothy soup. I even added some sour cream to my bowl, but did not care for the consistency this created - it was too watery. The next night my hubby cooked rice and added it to the soup - much better.

I thought this recipe was delicious! Especially since it's a crock-pot recipe! I made it one day as a diet thing (to eat some soup before each meal to eliminate calories) and I've thoroughly enjoyed it--which is not common for me with tortilla soup. I usually feel like they have too much chili powder, but this one is not like that. The only thing that I think is a little less-than-great is the canned tomatoes. I want to try to find some jarred peeled tomatoes next time because I feel like canned tomatoes taste a little like aluminum (but that's just a personal preference thing). Also, for the chicken, I used about 5-6 chicken tenders and boiled them in salted water, then shredded them myself.

This is my favorite chicken toritlla soup of ALL TIME! I've tried plenty. I follow this recipe (pretty much) to the letter. I do put in roasted diced tomatoes in place of the whole ones and use store bought chips.

This was awesome.  It will become a regular dish at my house because it is very easy and amazingly delicious.  I just put raw chicken breasts in with all the other ingredients and shredded them at the end (making it even easier).  I also substituted chicken stock for the water.  Definitely a keeper!

This soup was so good. Competes with any restaurant's version. Very easy and perfect for the working person.  Instead of cooking the chicken, I just threw in frozen chicken breasts and then shredded with a fork 3 hours in.

This was just outstanding soup.  Definitely will make it again.  I used the meat from a whole rotisserie chicken, 4 cups of chicken broth and no water, ancho chili powder rather than regular.  Served it with chunks of avocado, juice from a 1/4 lime, monzarella cheese, tortilla chips and a dollup of sour cream.  Awesome!

As is, this is a very good basic recipe. I added frozen chicken breasts at the start of cooking and shredded them 3+ hours into the cooking time.
I suggest adding extra spice and rinsed canned black beans to make it less bland. I really had to add a lot of spices to give it any kick.

I made the following changes based on other's recommendations:  Took out about 1/3 of the liquid and pureed it, then added it back to the pot.  I also added 1 cup brown rice (uncooked, not instant) to the soup about an hour before serving....tastes great with tortilla chips!

I've been making a recipe very similar to this, but this one is better. The secret ingredient here is your favorite enchillada sauce! WOW! This is the first time my kids have eaten this soup with enthusiasm. I use Las Palmas green chili sauce as it's sweeter without the acid of red sauce. I sauteed my garlic and onions (plus bell peppers) first. Just add bagged tortilla chips. And I use red beans, but any bean is a great addition for extra nutrition and flavor. Great recipe - thank you!!!

Love it! So easy and simple. I have made it several times when we have a lot of people over and I get rave reviews each time! I just get a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, leave out the bay leaf (if I don't have it- flavor is great either way) and add the fresh cilantro an hour before it is done on low or half hour on high to keep the flavor fresh. I serve it with tortilla strips, chopped cilantro, and shredded cheese on the side for my guests to garnish to their liking.

This is the best soup I have ever made. I usually boil chicken breast halves (with bone in) in some water with bay leaf and seasonings until it's done, and then shred it into the soup. It's amazing to have it cook in the slow cooker, and it makes the house smell wonderful. My husband likes some kick to the soup, so we add in some fresh diced jalapeno about an hour before it's ready to serve. Absolutely full of flavor and texture is great, and is wonderful on a cold rainy day.

More enchilada sauce (more than 10 oz.)
More cilantro
Don't add water, use broth only (chicken or beef) 
Chop in some celery
take the top off of a jalapeno and add it to the simmer
Black beans makes a nice additon.

AMAZING...with a few mods
First, i used a 28 oz can of enchie sauce, i used mild and with the other spices in there it still had a kick.
(using more enchie sauce might work for the people who complained it was too watery, mine was not watery at all)
Second- I only used half of a medium onion
Fourth- i prob used 2-2.5 lb of chicken to make it nice and hearty
Third- another thing that prevented mine from becoming too watery is i added the water last, i only used two cups of water and added one chicken bouillon cube, essentially omitting the water from the broth, yet still giving it the broth flavor
I cooked my chicken first, mainly bc i was pressed for time and wasnt sure if i could get this done in the alloted time.  Threw all the ingredients in and turned it on high.  Prob had it cooking for about 4-5 hours.  I cubed up some avacado, shredded some cotija cheese(a mexican cheese), squirted fresh lime juice, and used the crispy corn tostadas instead of baking my own and YUMMMMMM!!!
In the end, a really healthy(if youre not on a low sodium diet) and protein packed meal!! This will definitely be in the regular mix of meals.  Super easy to make and packed with flavor(i am a very picky eater, so take my word this is a great recipe)
Notes: I would prob omit the salt next time since there is so much salt in broth and enchie sauce and the whole tomatoes.  I prob wouldnt spend the money for one bay leaf, not sure how much that would change the taste.

Made this last night and absolutely loved it.  Only change I made was subbing another can of chicken broth for the water per other reviews.  Mine was quite spicy!  I was worried since I read another review that talked about it being bland...hubby and I were both sweating with runny noses!  I will probably halve the green chiles next time I make it.  Could also have been the enchilada sauce...my grocery store only had Medium so that was what I used.  Overall really good though and will definitely make it again!

I have made this several times and people loved it and wanted the recipe. I did add black beans and I serve it with cheddar cheese and chips. Easy to make, I don't put the chicken in until about an hour or two before I am going to serve it. I do not like my chicken over cooked.

This is now one of our favorites!  I followed some of the suggestions in previous reviews to make this simpler and a bit healthier.  
*I toss boneless chicken breasts in and shred at the end right before serving.  
*Add a can of low sodium black beans (rinsed). 
*Substitute a can of low sodium diced tomatoes for whole peeled.
*Use 1 tsp. of dried cilantro instead of 1 T.
*Eliminate the 1 tsp. salt altogether.
*Add 1 reduced sodium chicken bouillon cube or 1 tsp granules to the 2 cups water.
*Serve with Baked Tostitos and a little shredded sharp cheddar.

I made this recipe last night, omitting the cilantro for my family's taste, and it turned out great! I used 3 boneless skinless breasts (whole & raw) in the cooker, and shredded right before serving. I served it over tortilla chips, and my wife & son ate theirs over white rice. Both ways were good with lots of flavor and no heat. This will become a cold weather staple at our house.

Total winner - very easy, inexpensive, and super delicious.   I've made this twice now and wouldn't change a thing - except that like so many others, found that using frozen chicken works just fine and shreds easily after 2-3 hours.

This soup was very good. I will be making this one again for sure. I did as others suggested & used chicken broth in place of the water & added can of black beans. Had 2 small boneless chicken breast & only had 4 thighs so added them. Would like to add the hot enchilada sauce to give it a kick, but hubby not too into the spicy thing. This is worht the 5 stars here.

Great soup! Easy to throw together and wonderful soup. Have made it a few times and thickened it with either a can of refried beans or some dried corn masa mixed with water to make a slurry, then stir it into the soup when it's almost done. Any way I've tried it the flavor is outstanding. Thanks for sharing!

So Delish!!! Family loved!!! I've never made tortilla soup before, & I was so happy my first attempt came out perfectly! Only change is, I will add the tortilla strips to individual bowls, as they get mushy in the soup. Thank you for a wonderful new addition to our family menu!

My family of five LOVES this recipe!  I did make a few small changes to make it quicker.  I toss diced raw chicken in the crockpot rather than pre-cooked shredded.  It saves time, and works great!  I also thicken it slightly with corn starch (2-3 Tbs mixed with about a cup of cold water) - Last but not least, we crush corn chips into the soup rather than making our own strips.  Wonderful recipe... thank you!

I used the suggestions of others and put in 3 frozen chicken breasts that I shredded after they cooked.  I used 15 oz rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of the whole tomatoes, and also added black beans (drained and rinsed).  Added about 1/2 packet of taco seasoning as well.  And we LOVED it - I will definitely make this again - very easy and very tasty!

I wanted something to eat with my Margarita and I didn't want to wait 4-6 hours so I did this in the pressure cooker.  Added the ingredients and one, frozen chicken breast half.  I brought it up to pressure then maintained it for 15 minutes.  I shredded the chicken and returned it to the pot and *VOILA* Chicken Tortilla Soup in 30 minutes.  I put tortillas in the bowl, added the soup and garnished it with a lime wedge, avocado, and shredded cheese.  Been awhile since I had Sopa de Tortilla back in Mexico, don't know how authentic this is BUT it was quick, easy and best of all tasty!  Will add this recipe to the "Soup" section in my recipe book for sure!!

This was a great Recipe. I thought it might be too hot for the kids with the green chilies, but it wasn't. My husband added some tobasco in his. I did like others and added a few splashes of lime juice, cheese on top and sour cream. Next time I am going to try adding black beans. It was very easy to make. I put my chicken in frozen and shredded it about an hour before serving. I will be adding this to my regular menu.

I am in university and this recipe is very easy and when I have other students for dinner they love it! I don't think you really need to put it in the slow cooker. It is a great way to use a rotissorie chicken! I serve it with cheezy biscuits instead of tortillas.

I don't even normally like chicken tortilla soup that much but this was fantastic! Very savory and easy as pie. And healthy! Will make again and again.

Fantastic!  Super easy and tastes amazing.  We refridgerated the left-overs and enjoyed them for a couple of days.  The soup was as good on days two and three as on day one.

I lightened it a bit by using low fat- low sodium chicken broth and garnishing with low-fat cheddar cheese and low fat sour cream.  This is going to be a fall staple in our home!

Just made a really full crock pot of this soup.  Used frozen chicken breasts and just threw it all together.  Also added black beans. Highly recommend adding lime juice on top.

This soup was delicious. I don't like brothy soups, so I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of water, and omitted the 14.5 oz can of stock. I also added about a tablespoon of coconut milk to my bowl just before I ate it to make it a bit creamy while still remaining dairy-free. I am not a soup fan, but I will definitely be eating this again!

This was delicious and easy! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I had to almost double the spices, it was a bit bland for my taste. I also added a can of black beans about 30 minutes before we ate, I really think it made a difference.

The soup was pretty good. I like many others made my own changes. I use 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth and no water. There was plenty of liquid even though it was shy 6.5 oz from the original recipe. I also added a can of kidney beans. There is defiantly a kick to the soup but I it wasn't too spicy. I also just used store bought tortilla chips and crushed them into the soup.

I have to say this recipe was easy to make and certainly smelled delicious. It had a nice spice to it, but lacked flavor. Everything in the dish tasted the same like the broth.

After a few hours in the crockpot, it tasted like cumin water, too spicey and just blah. I had used chicken stock instead of water even and it still had no real depth, just watery cumin. I fixed it by adding a can of tomato paste. I also added black beans at the start. After some doctoring, brought it to work as a treat, and it was gone in no time! Overall a good recipe, just needs some tweaking

This recipe is amazing.  I only give it four stars since I think it is so much better with the addition of a can of black beans.  I also just use store-bought tortilla chips as the topping.

This is the best tortilla soup I have ever tried. I love the lime taste that is shown in the pic, but not mentioned in the recipe, I also topped it off with fresh sliced avocado. Making your own enchilada sauce is even easier than I thought. And the left over sauce makes awesome taco seasoning.

I changed more in preparation than I did ingredients in this recipe.  I did as others suggested and left my chicken breast whole and I also added it frozen.  I added all ingredients except the corn to the crockpot overnight.  All I needed to do in the morning was remove the chicken to shred it.  It was so tender and falling apart that it was almost self shredding!  And the flavor was amazing!  I added the corn and some chili beans and let it cook on low heat for another couple of hours.  One of the best things I have ever made and so easy!

This is the best tortilla soup ever! Thanks Elena! I also made it even easier by using whole uncooked chicken breasts (frozen) and taking them out and shredding them after  8 hrs in the crock pot (kept it on high the entire time)  Good topped with cheese too!

Excellent!  Flavors were just perfect.  Not too spicy and consistency was just right.  Instead of shredded chicken I used 2 packages of foster farms precooked chicken breast strips cuts up.  I also added boneless dark chicken thighs I had from leftovers and cut up.  Next time I am going to add in a can of black beans towards the end of cooking.  Will make again for sure!  Yummy!!!!!

This tortilla soup was delicious! I put less encilada sauce than called for, less corn, and more chicken. I also put more chicken broth and less water. I will definitely make it regularly!

This recipe is awesome. I'm sure the sodium content is on overload but with a few changes this recipe can be super healthy and tasty. I peeled two whole tomatoes and chopped them instead of adding the can of whole peeled tomatoes. Then I boiled my chicken in water( just enough to cover the chicken) until it was tender and shredable. The water used to boil the chicken of course was now broth so there was no need to add a can of broth. I omitted 3/4 cup of water and added some mrs. Dash herb seasoning. There were no left overs!

Awesome!  I followed the adivice  of the previous reviewers and didn't bother cooking the chicken first, and i added a can of rinsed black beans.  The avocado and the fresh lime juice when serving makes this a definite 5 star!  Wow, I didn't even bother with the tortilla chips.  Next time am adding just a little bit more chilipowder.  I LOVE THIS!

The changes I made were used all chicken broth instead of water.  For the enchilada sauce I used 1 10 oz can of red and approx 5 oz of green chile sauce.  Substituted 1 can of hominy for the corn and added black beans.  I did use rotel spicy in place of the whole tomatoes (So I only used 1/2 can).  Added 1 Tbsp lime juice and used the crushed tortilla chips.  Was very easy, will make again.

Great soup! I make it at the office for lunch. It's convenient and filling. I have made it twice and I definitely prefer medium enchilada sauce, cook the chicken in the soup, take out chicken to shred and to blend the soup before adding back the chicken. Substitutions that work...creamed corn, add carrots, water instead of chix broth. No problem, tastes great anyway you make it. Everyone likes it too. Same additions/ garnishes as others suggested.

Recipe is outstanding, I've made it a few times using this recipe and its always great.  I love green chile so I get the 7oz instead of the 4oz can.  Don't skimp and cut out the fresh lime and fresh cilantro.  I used dried cilantro and it wasn't as good.

love, love, love this soup!!!! My husband said this was the best soup he ever had.  Instead of chopped green chili's, I used Rotel tomatoes w/green chili's and lime.  It added a great flavor to the soup.

This is Just as good as authentic restaurant or better. I used 1can of Rotel instead of the diced green chiles. Added 1 Small can of tomatoe sauce and used diced tomatoes instead of the whole ones.
Garnished with diced purple onion, fresh cilantro, sliced advocado, squeezed lime juice ontop then placed the tortilla chips from the recipe. 
This will be placed into my favorite recipes.

One of my favorites! For this one, I use frozen chicken breasts and shred them with a fork in the crock-pot, just before serving. I also use about 2/3rd can of enchilada sauce. (My son doesn't like it too spicy.) And I use a "southwest" blend of frozen corn with peppers and onions in the mix. Then I serve with shredded cheese & avocado on top of the soup with tortilla chips on the side. The hubby loves it too.

This was super easy to make and came out GREAT!! I did season the chicken with garlic and onion powder before cooking I also added black beans to add taste and color. Next time I would salt and season the tortillas before baking. I also garnished with shredded white queso cheese instead of cheddar witch really pulled it all together and some sliced avacados.

Delicious! But I minced the cooked chicken & put it on the bottom of the bowl with tortilla strips & then poured the hot soup over the top.
Also, I doubled the chili powder & added 1 can of Campbells Creamy Chicken Verde...!  
(To make it thicker, I used half as much water & I added 1/4 cup of corn meal.)

I am not the best cook but this was so simple and super EASY to make! I did what one reviewer recommended and put the chicken breast in the crock put whole and shredded it with a fork when it was almost done. Put everything in the crock pot in the morning before church, and when we got back around lunch time, we didn't waste money going out to eat! it was WAAAAAY better than any tortilla soup I've ever had...and it tasted very authentic. It was a HIT! The only change- I added a spoonful of bouillon to the soup for added flavor. :) Topped with shredded cheese, avocado and drizzled with lemon juice (I didn't have limes) IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!

Delicious soup and very easy to make!  Shredded the store-bought roasted chicken the night before and threw everything in the slow cooker the next morning before work.  I used a 32 oz can of whole tomatoes with the juice instead of the 15 oz.  I put a dollop of sour cream, homemade tortilla strips and freshly squeezed lime in the bowls to serve.  Perfection!

Made this yesterday and it was HIT --- I started the recipe with the raw chicken in the crockpot in the evening with broth and water and spices on low and added the rest of items in early morning.... Around noon I was able to quickly and easily use two forks to pull apart chicken into shreds. Used drained 14oz can of corn instead of frozen and used 2 10oz cans of diced tomatoes and green chili peppers instead of separate can of tomatoes and separate can of green chilli peppers. Also added chopped celery.

I made this soup (last night)based on the comments/reviews and everyone was RIGHT this is an amazing EASY recipe.  I too put the chicken in frozen, used all broth.  The only change I made is that I added finly chopped SPINACH--couldn't tell the difference.  My only difference is I made it on the stovetop on med/high heat for 2/5-3 hours; shredded the chicken and simmered for 30 min.  However, as it simmered it thickend so I had to add 1 more can of chicken broth.  THANK YOU TO ALL WHO REVIEW RECIPES

Oh my gawd, this was so good!  Only change I made was to omit the corn and to add frozen chicken breasts and shred an hour before serving, as other reviewers suggested.  Also, instead of using tortilla chips we ate it with warm tortillas.  It was so easy and so delicious, I WILL be making this again.

Fantastic recipe! I agree with other reviewers that there's no need to cook the chicken. I scooped it out with a slotted spoon and shredded it half-way through.

I love tortilla soup, but hate cooling. This recipe was was easy, healthy and tastes great. I also threw in the frozen chicken breasts and shredded them on completion.  My husband and son said that the soup was too spicy and cut it w/ some broth. I found it just fine.  Will definitely make again.

Wow! Fantastic soup! I didn't use enchillada sauce, but I did use the same mixture I use for enchillada's which is Jalepeno Salsa and Salsa da chile fresco (both of which are found in the mexican food section of the grocery store) and with a-a-a-a-amazing results! Thanks for the recipe:) I also just put the chicken in whole and shredded when done.

This was so yummy! I followed a lot of reviewers advice and did the following: used frozen chicken breast (so easy!), used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, doubled the cumin and chili powder, and added a can of black beans. I kept everything else the same, and it was awesome!!!

I followed the recipe word for word, and the soup was very bland and watery tasting.  I used a canned enchilada sauce, and those are sometimes hit or miss for me - some taste good, and others don't.  So my choice in the sauce may have negatively impacted the soup.

Looking at other reviews, I added half a package of taco seasoning and half of a lemon.  Without those small changes, the soup would have been depressing, but I would make it again with the taco seasoning and lime.  Very tasty.  The posted recipe still needs some work in my opinion.

This was a great, quick recipe!  I followed the suggestions of others and tossed in 3 frozen chicken breasts which I was a little concerned about since it was raw and I'm a little paranoid about that kind of stuff but 2 bowls of soup later, I'm still kickin'.  Also, I added a can of black beans and some tapatio, omitted the salt, bay leaf, and cilantro.  I cooked this on low for 6.5 hours...perfecto!  This was so great, I will definitely be sharing this recipe and making it again!

This was a big hit with my family.... I did however double the recipe.. The serving size say 8, however, we use bigger bowls (like chili or rice bowls) and my family of 5 likes to eat... I also like to have some leftover.  Doubling the recipe ensured that my entire family had a nice bowl of soup and there was enough left over for seconds and even some for lunch the next day.  I did not cook my chicken before adding to soup.  I simiply added everything together and cooked it in a big pot right on the stove since I had doubled it.  I did shred the chicken after 3 1/2 hours...  I did add cooked brown rice after shredding the chicken as one person suggested.  Once the soup was served in bowls, I added chunks of avocado, some shredded cheese and a squeeze of fresh lime to each bowl.  Lime is a must!!  Adds great flavor.   I tried to make the tortilla strips, but they burned the first time in the oven, make sure to keep an eye on them, 15 minutes is way too long... I then tried them in the microwave for 4 minutes on half power.. Some of them still managed to burn but those that didn't were very tasty... I ended up using regular tortilla chips in the soup and everyone loved them just the same!  My 12 year old daughter wants me to tell you the soup was phenomenal!  Again a big hit!  Will most definitely make again.

My family loves this soup! I also add a can of rinsed black beans and top the soup with sour cream, cheese, and tortilla strips, it's great! I also use all chicken broth instead of water. If I want to make the soup in a hurry, I simmer all the ingredients in a large sauce pan and I use a cooked rotisseree chicken from the grocery store.  It works great and is very fast to make, a great soup for busy families!!!!

We swapped pinto beans for the corn, because my husband doesn't care for corn, and used bagged tortilla chips. Also just chopped the chicken into small spoon-sized pieces and let it cook in the slow cooker - did it on high for 4 hours rather than low for 8, and it turned out WONDERFULLY. 

It was super easy to make - took me maybe 15 minute before church on a Sunday, and we came home to a mouth-watering aroma. Will definitely make often!

the flavor alone deserves 5 stars; maybe the enchilada sauce makes it so scrumptious.  I did press an additional clove of garlic. No point in crushing up tomatoes so I just used the fire-roasted diced.  Cut the chicken breasts into chunks and tossed them in raw.  I like more substance in my soup so did add some black beans, but still wanted more substance so added some rice and that did the trick.  this couldn't be any easier; just throw it all in and let it go.  so flavorful.  did use all homemade chicken broth in place of the water.  also used a bit more cilantro.  don't skip the cilantro; this really adds to the flavor.

Loved it! I am a college student with two kids and this was super simple and delicious. It was perfect for when me and my kids got home at six and were really hungry. Just a note I added about half a cup of white wine!!! Delicious!

This was really good the first time I made just as the recipe reads. The second time I made it I did not have chopped chilis but I did have some jalapenos so I added those. I sometimes add a can of black beans.

YUM!  Great healthy recipe.  Used 4 cups of chicken broth and no water - added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed).  Extra garlic and cumin too.  Cooked chicken in slow cooker with everything else and shredded about 4 hours in on low.  This was delish!

I made this recipe as part of the hidden treasures blog by mis7up.  I have had this recipe in my box since July 2009.  My 9 year old and I really liked this soup.  My husband on the other hand said it was to “tomatoe.”  That may have been my fault because I used a quart of tomatos that I canned instead of the 15oz can the recipe calls for.  I was also unable to add as much water as the recipe called for because my crock pot isn’t that big which probably contributed to the overly tomato taste.  I used frozen chicken breasts instead of cooked shredded and then pulled them out and shredded them before I was ready to serve which worked great.  I would make this again with a pint size jar of tomatos.

This is the best soup. The entire family likes it which is hard to ever have happen.  I double it and put in a large crockpot before going to work.  Great on those winter evenings when you get home. I put cheese on top with the baked tortillas. The only thing I change is that I take the tomatoes and put them in the blender before putting in the crockpot

Yum! I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken and added corn. It turned out super tasty and flavorful. I added some tabasco sauce for a little extra kick. I had leftovers for a couple days after!

This is really yummy. I doubled the recipe as many had suggested, but  I ended up simmering it on the stovetop for about an hour as I wanted it in a hurry.  With the doubling I substituted a can of rinsed black beans for one of the packages of frozen corn.  Everyone had seconds and there was some leftover for the next day.

Great recipe.....if you use canned chicken (I know...it sounds bad..but it works great for the working mother in these kinds of recipes!!) you can make this up in 30 minutes (don't need the slow cooker).  If you like it spicy use the medium to hot enchilada sauce.  If not, use mild!  Easy!

Just delicious. 

Hate to say I "tweaked" it, since we're supposed to be rating this recipe, but I did use a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and 3/4 can of green enchilada sauce. Also used about 2 cups of chicken stock instead of water and a can of broth.

The results - yummmmmmm

this soup was fantastic!! i altered it slightly, only because i didn't have the exact ingredients. i couldn't find enchilada sauce, so i used mild taco sauce instead. i also used a combination of onion powder and minced onion spices to replace a fresh onion. i pureed the tomatoes and chilies on accident, but it actually came out better that way. go easy on the tortilla strips, they soak up most of the soup. i will definitely use this recipe again and again. delicious!

This recipe tasted great, but I did alter it a little.  I added corn masa because I thought the soup was too watery.  It thickened perfectly.  Instead of using canned tomatoes and peppers, I used fresh ones.  And to add a little cayenne pepper for extra punch since I love spicy food.  My whole family loved it!  I will make again.

Great easy recipe, with a lot of flavor. I use a bag of frozen corn/onion/black beans/ and peppers- even easier! I have used raw and even frozen chicken breasts.

I also added frozen chicken breasts and shredded toward the end, and used store bought tortilla chips.  Had to leave out the cilantro b/c I didn't have any.  This was so tasty and easy!

OMG, this was so delicious! I'm not much of a soup person, but the tortillas made it wonderful! You HAVE to make your own tortillas, they taste so much better than store bought and are very easy to make!

I'm a novice cooker and this was really easy to do!  It tasted excellent and I can't wait to make it again!  Like other reviewers, I added uncooked chicken breasts at the beginning and shredded the meat after a few hours of cooking on low.  I also added (rinsed & drained) black beans.  I served it with avocado, cheddar cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips & cilantro on top.  Definitely delicious!

This soup was great - I only added a few things to kick up the spice. I also added cayenne pepper (to taste, depending on how spicy you like it), a pinch more chili powder, red pepper flakes and a drizzle of hot sauce. When I served the soup, I squeezed a lime over each serving, and topped with a pinch of Cheddar Jack cheese (which melted right in). I also added a can of black beans for some protein, and since the corn was frozen, I didn't add water and used 2 cans of chicken broth instead (I figured there would be some water when the corn defrosted). 

All in all, a great soup and my husband says is a "repeater."

This tasted INCREDIBLE!  Followed the recipe to the letter except for the chips (store bought, I was feeling lazy!)  After dishing up the soup, I sprinkled some shredded mexican blend cheese on the top also, absolutely marvelous dish and so, so, so easy, thank you so much for sharing!!!!

This recipe is delicious. I make it over and over again. Everyone craves it and I love how I can throw it all in the slow cooker, go away, and come back to a delicious meal! What I do to change it up sometimes is to cook my own chicken (heavily seasoned. Don't be afraid to experiment with flavors), add a can or two of black beans, and add a shredded mexican cheese blend. To taste. I've done 1 cup to 1 pack. Just play with it.

This is a excellent recipe that has gotten great reviews from anyone who's tried it and I make it often.  I serve it with toppings such as cheddar cheese, avocado chunks and sour cream or ranch dressing. To save time I use yellow corn tortilla chips as a topping on the side as well.  Its a great way to use up leftover chicken or turkey. Its quick to put together in the morning and great to come home to.

Sooooo Soooo Sooooo Good!  & way easy!  My husband & i LOVED it.  I used chicken broth in place of the water.  Put frozen chicken tenderloins right in with all the other ingredients.  Shredded chicken a few hours into cooking (on High). I melted cheese on top of reg tortilla chips to add on top instead of baking & cutting tortillas, etc etc.  Also topped with Sour Cream & Sliced avocado that was salt & peppered.  Definitely a keeper in our house.  :)

I used this recipe for a Teachers Appreciation luncheon and everyone loved it.  We had it for dinner the same night and my family loved it too.  It's easy and very flavorful.  There is a lime shown on the picture, I highly recommend serving with sliced lime even though the recipe does not call for any.  One squeeze of the lime makes a very yummy difference in your bowl of soup!

I don't know what I did wrong, but this soup did not turn out good.  It tastes like the brine from the can.  It has a metallic after taste.  I am disappointed because all of the reviews made it sound so good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added black beans, put in 2 bone-in breasts and shredded at the end, and used 2 cans of chicken stock, no water.

Very, very flavorful.  I loved it!  It is a spicy dish, so you must like that.  The tortilla strips were a nice addition.  I would also add a dollop of sour cream to "tame" the spice a bit- or if serving to children.  Makes a nice main course if you serve a big bowl of corn chips and Guac. on the table.  I used Old El Paso enchilada sauce med. and a Vadalia for the onion.

Love this soup !  Instead of cooked chicken, I add raw boneless skinless thighs to the slow cooker and cook soup on low for 8 hours.  Flavor is awesome.

Very good BASE for a good soup...with a few changes. 
Like other reviewers, use 2 cans broth instead of water. I also used red enchilada sauce, because we like things HOT! Used about 1 T of chili powder and double the cumin...even with these changes it was still a little bland and had to add more chili powder to taste. Also added 2 extra cloves garlic. DEFINITELY cook the chicken in the slow cooker with the rest, and serve topped with shredded Mexican Cheese Blend =)

Wish I could give this more stars! Absolutely delicious as is, but yet so versatile.  I have made this many times.  It is definitely a keeper and so easy!  Don't need to have cooked chicken. I just throw frozen breasts in and shred when they're done cooking. Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I love this soup - make it all of the time.  It is so easy - mostly just opening cans. It is great for a pot luck.  Some changes:  like someone else suggested, don't bother cooking chicken in advance.  Just throw it in the crock pot.  1/2 hour or so before eating, shred up the chicken and throw back in.  Instead of whole tomatoes, I use fire roasted diced tomatoes.  Also, leave the cilantro out and serve as a garnish when eating.  Otherwise, it turns brown and isn't fresh.  I serve this with basmati rice, shredded cheese, lime wedges and sour cream.  For a twist, throw in some black beans.  If you want to make it with a kick, use hot enchilada sauce and diced jalapenos.  If you make it mild, you can always spice up your bowl with a spoonful of habanero salsa.  Love this recipe!

This soup is awesome!  I made it exactly to the recipe and loved it!  Not too spicy, but spicy enough!  I usually just use store bought chips and that's fine, and I add avocado as a topping.  Yum!

A new family favorite...we have had this every other week for about 2 months now.  We leave out the cilantro and bay leaf just because we don't have those on hand and it turned out great without it.  We also add 1 Tablespoon of chili powder rather then one teaspoon.  Make sure your chicken is shredded prior to starting the soup, it really makes a big difference in the end result..believe me, that batch didn't turn out very well. :)

The only thing I'd change is use diced tomatoes...i think I will also use spaghetti sauce instead of enchilada sauce (but I haven't tried that yet).

Also if this is the main course with no sides double the recipe.

YUMMY!! I loved this soup more than I thought I was going to. I did change it up based on what I had in the house. I used Las Palmas Green enchilada sauce, I didn't have a can of green chilis so I ended up using 2 cans of rotel instead of the can of tomatoes and chilis. We wanted it spicy so we used about 3 oz of diced jalepenos from a can which added a nice kick to it. I didn't have cumin or bay leaf but it still had a lot of flavor!! I also just put 1 1/2 raw chicken breasts in the crockpot and it cooked the meat and also made it fall apart tender. Thank you!

Made this several time but do not use the slow-cooker.  Loved by all.  Everytime I fix this for company they ask for the recipe.  I serve with wedges of lime, corn chips, sour cream, cheese, and sliced scallions.  YUMMY!

Very good and hearty.  I found it a little bland though, would add some beans next time and hot sauce, and would reduce the amount of liquid- it was too watery for me.  My 10 year old did not like this which surprised me- he loves Mexican and is generally not too picky.

This soup was sooooo good!  I made a few modifications to the recipe though.  I used shredded chicken leftover from a whole chicken I had made the night before, so I made this on my stovetop instead of the slower cooker.  Used 4 cups of water for more broth (in place of water and broth the recipe calls for), added 4 chicken bullion cubes, a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes, and a can of black beans.  I brought the soup to a boil and then let it simmer for two hours, and didn't put the corn and beans in until the last half hour of cooking time.  I also used store bought tortilla chips crunched up over the top instead of making the strips myself.  I also served flour tortillas on the side.  I will definitely make this again!!  We looked forward to the left overs the next night because it was that delicious!

Excellent recipe! Only addition was the can of black beans (rinsed). I probably should have cooked the chicken in the crock pot to save time, but didn't read the other comments until after.

Absolutely amazing! I took the advice of other reviewers and just threw 4 whole chicken breasts in then shredded them a few hours in to the cooking, I was a little pressed for time so I cooked for 4 hours on high and it was great! I added 4 cloves of garlic instead of just 2 and used 2 bay leaves. I also used medium enchilada sauce and 1tspn of cayenne pepper, just to add a little extra kick. Didn't have regular cheddar so I topped with Colby jack. I will definitely make this again, and again!

Super easy to make and delicious.  I put a dollop of sour cream on the top along with the tortilla strips.

Totally delicious! I cringed a little when I added the 2 cups of water, but with lots of tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese, the soup tasted great!

This was absolutely delicious! So quick & easy too! I did as others suggested & cooked my chicken in the crock pot w the rest of the ingredients. The only modification I made was I only used 1 c water, the rest was chicken broth, thus I didn't add any extra salt. When finished, I topped w a sprinkle of shredded cheese, a blop of sour cream & some crushed tortilla chips. Came out great & will definitely be making again~even my hubby who isn't a soup fan enjoyed a few bowls of this!

This recipe is wonderful. The only thing I added was canned corn and black beans and used chicken stock instead of water.

I have never made a home made soup before, and this was perfect. I just got a very nice slow-cooker and wanted to make a healthy tortilla soup. I followed the recipe step by step (which I normally use it as a guideline and add more/change, etc.) except I used chicken boullion (one square) because the chicken stock flavor didn't really come through. Make sure you break up the tomatoes really well, and they will break up more as time goes by. I used a small onion and 1/4 cup parsley. Thanks for this recipe!

Great and EASY!!  I have made this twice now and put the chicken in frozen as someone else had suggested.  I take it out at the end to shred.  I substituted chili powder for one whole dried serrano and pequin that I crushed, I did not use a bay leaf, and I added a chopped/seeded chipotle (yum) at the end.

Excellent, even better the next day. I added 2 cans of chili beans (did not drain), 1 cup of salsa and a 16oz bag of frozen corn. I doubled the cumin and chili powder.  I added 2 cans of chicken broth and no water.  I thought the 1 pound of chicken breasts was enough and it works out great to just put the chicken into the slow cooker raw and let it cook that way, then remove, shred and return to the cooker.

I have made this several times in the last few months. It is such an easy meal to put together. I have made it in a large pot using pre-cooked chicken and I have used the crock pot also.  I now get requests from friends to make this soup. It is a hit and a regular recipe on my menu! Don't skip the cilanto - it makes a good soup GREAT!

Loved this!  I made this on the morning of a blizzard and it was the perfect meal for such a cold and snowy day.  I honestly made this the laziest way possible.  My pound of chicken came from a can (along with the majority of the ingredients)!  Even so it was really delicious.  Instead of doing the tortillas, I just crumbled tortilla chips on top.   Definitely a keeper!

LOVE this recipe! I have very little time in the morning, so I make ahead the night before, with a few minor changes: xtra chicken breast, already cooked and shredded. Diced tomato instead of whole peeled. No salt (there's plenty in the enchilada sauce & the chicken broth). No bay leaf. Take it out of the fridge & throw the crock pot on low in the AM on the way out the door, and this is excellent when we get home! The kids like to crush up tortilla chips & sprinkle on top. A new family favorite - thank you!

I have been making this recipe for some time now and my boyfriend and I love it. It can't get much easier. I put all of the ingredients in the slow cooker on low in the morning before I leave for work, and when I come home all I have to do is shred the chicken and dinner is ready. It's delicious and filling. Also really good served with a little sliced avocado on top.

This was AWESOME!  Bonus that it was so stinking easy.  I was really leery about using the enchilada sauce but it was so good.  Very close to restaurant in AZ I used to eat at.  Added little chunks of cheese and avacado to the bottom of the bowl then added soup...the cheese got all melty and gooey.  Yum-o! I used 2 skinless chicken thighs and one frozen chicken breast (added last minute because I didn't think the 2 thighs would be enough).  I pulled the bones out and just broke apart meat with a fork.  It was the perfect amount. I also added 1 can of rinsed black beans and 1 small can of niblets corn about half way through....LAWDY LAWDY so good!

I really liked this recipe alot, but I did change a few things: for one, I used a bit more chicken (probably closer to 2lbs) and coated it in taco seasoning mix and then seared in my dutch oven. This made it more like a stew than soup. I then added 3 cups of chicken broth (no water), didn't use the enchilada sauce and I also used crushed tomatoes vs. whole peeled. Next time, I am definitely going to add black beans, 2 cans, and puree one of them w/ the crushed tomatoes.  I did this for another soup recipe and it just adds a ton of flavor and makes the consitency a little thicker.  Great recipe though! Very easy and delish!

I found this recipe months ago and have made it many times now.  It has become a family favorite. I have also served this at a few parties I have had and it was a big hit.  Like some other reviewers suggested, I used crushed tomatoes instead of the whole and I add a can of black beans.  I also used a large container of chicken stock and 3 cups of water.  This is the easiest thing to make.  Also, you don't have to cook it in a slow cooker.  I have also just cooked it in a large pot on the stove for an hour.  Turns out great.

This is as close to the tortilla soup we had in Mexico as we've gotten so far (& I've been searching for 20+ years)!  I doubled the recipe and then ran out of room in the crock pot so I left out the chicken broth.  It didn't need it.  We served it with the tortilla strips, diced avacado, crumbled goat chees & sour cream.  Everyone went back for more!

This was really good.  I thinly sliced raw chicken and tossed it in with the rest of the ingredients.  I will totally make this again, but next time, I will add less water.  It had really good flavor, but I think it was a bit too liquidy.

I changed the water to broth and about halfway through the cooking time I added a can of black beans(rinsed) and a 10 oz bag of frozen instant brown rice.  I think that any cooked rice would do. This was just excellent!

I love this guilt-free recipe! I've made this soup twice, once with traditional red enchilada sauce and the other time with green chile enchilada sauce. Although the red enchilada sauce soup was very tasty, the batch with the green enchilada sauce tasted SO much better!! It still had the nice reddish-brown color and tasted like something right out of a restaurant!

Great!!!  I put the chicken in frozen as others suggested.  Cooked perfectly!  Will add a can of Rotel next time.  I also cooked rice to mix in, and served with sour cream, green onions, and cheese.  My kids are not soup eaters, so I sprayed a flour tortilla with cooking spray and sprinkled it with cheese and chicken from the soup.  I cooked this on medium high heat, and they loved it.  Will make this meal again!!!

Love this recipe, so easy. I know the ingredients list looks daunting, but remember that you are dealing with a slow cooker recipe. Just dump everything in and go.  My suggestions: I omitted the extra 2 cups of water. Would have been much too broth-y had I left the water in. I used drained canned corn in lieu of frozen. Also, a whole onion was way too much. I did a half an onion and it was still too much. I doubled the cilantro because I love that flavor. Also I used medium heat enchilada sauce and it gave it just the right amount of kick.   The recipe made more than enough for my fiance and I to have two bowls of it and enough leftovers for two days, so I'd say they are right on the money with the yield.  We will be keeping this one in our recipe rotation for sure.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it is one of two that I didn't have to change anything. This recipe is perfect as is, though I did add some black beans just for health reasons. I threw the chicken in the crock pot frozen and cooked on high four hours. After two and a half hours I shredded the chicken. What a great recipe! Tastes just like tortilla soup you would get from an authentic mexican restaurant here in texas if not better.

This is great! I put the chicken in uncooked just like others and i add 1 Taco seasoning packet instead of the individual seasoning suggested. Tastes Fantastic!

My boyfriend and I both were not fans of this soup.  I have never had chicken tortilla soup before, but I wasn't a fan of the enchilada sauce.

My wife absolutely loves this recipe, and so do I.  It is relatively easy to make and has a unique and delicious Mexican taste.  The kids really like this one too.  Make sure you garnish with avocado, cheese, and chips.  Oh and don't forget that sour cream!  I will be making this over and over.

This soup was wonderful. I added black and white beans, extra corn, an extra can of enchilada sauce, no water (all broth), and used frozen thighs. This is a super easy dinner to throw together in the morning. To save more time, combine it all at night, stick it in the fridge, and bring it out the next morning before you head out for the day. I really liked the idea of throwing cheese on the tortillas before adding them too. This was a huge hit in my household and we will DEFINITELY make it again. Thanks so much for sharing this with all of us! So yummy!!!

Delicious and so easy!  Made it almost exact but I am snowed in at the moment and did not have any cilantro which would have made it even better! I was also out of garlic so I added 2 tsp of garlic powder.  I added a can of black bean and added only chicken broth (no H2O).  Per the recommendatios, I added some lime juice to the individual bowls and topped wth shredded monteray jack cheese and crushed corn tortillas.  YUM!

Awesome dish. The family loved it. I followed the recipe but added jalapenos, black beans, carrots and potatoes. I steamed the potatoes and carrots and added it to the soup about 30 min before I served it. I added more chicken broth and less water, and added just a little more enchilada sauce to spice it up. (Our family loves spicy.) I also bought tortilla chips from the Mexican market down the street. They make fresh ones. I will make this again for sure. Thanks for such an easy great recipe. :)

This was sooo goood!  I followed others advice and put in frozen pre packaged breasts that i had on hand. Shredded those few hours into the cooking and added all the ingredients in the beginning, used the low sodium chicken broth and only half a cup of water (the rest was the broth)  Came out amazing, I was sick and I had it for left overs made me feel much better

This was wonderful.  I changed it some.  I put in a can of diced tomatoes, no green chile peppers, and 2 cups of white rice.  My husband is a picky eater and he loved this.

This was delicious. Took the advice of others and used uncooked chicken for this recipe and shredded shortly before serving. Used Rotel but next time I will add the green chile peppers along with that. Added black beans as well. This was a very easy and delicious meal. On a very busy and cold day I had one very happy family including our 14 month old daughter.

I made my own changes  to this recipes. I added hominy and a handful of celery to the soup for more veggies. The flavor was delicious, but I think I had to cook it for much longer. I put it on high for 3.5 to 4 hours and the celery and onion were cooked but not as soft as I like. It was still yummy though and my bf loved it.  Serve with Mexican cornbread and it is a very filling meal!

I have a usual taco soup recipe but it's more of a meal and we wanted some tortilla soup that was light and brothy. This was definitely that and we really enjoyed it. The only changes I made was omitting the cilantro and adding some extra cumin, chili powder, and tossing in some garlic and onion powder. I also used only chicken broth instead of water. Oh, and I threw in raw chicken breasts and just let them cook, shredding them with about 30 minutes left. There's really no need to pre-cook the chicken. My only recommendation to make this better would be to use an extra chicken breast because it's a lot of broth without a lot of chicken. A little more chicken would make it perfect. It was very much like restaurant tortilla soup so if that's what you're looking for this is a good recipe to follow.

Absolutely wonderful! I wasn't sure this would be as good as cooking it on the stove, but not to worry, it's even better. The first time I made it, I thought I had all the ingredients, but as I assembled it, I did not have the enchilada sauce. I substitued it with a can of rotel tomatoes, and it was very good, but it seemed like something was missing. The next time I made it, I had the enchilada sauce, and what a difference it made - was really delicious. I don't always have the fresh cilantro on hand, but we always top off with grated cheese and sour cream. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Very good.  I added a touch more salt, but not really necessary since the tortilla chips are salty.  Squirt some lime, add a topping of shredded cheese, a dolop of sour cream - yuuuummmmm.

I have been making this recipe for months now.  My family loves it, this tortilla soup is excellent with homemade tortilla strips, avocado, lime, monterey jack and sour cream as a garnish.  This is a great recipe for incoming guests that are travelling to your home.  It can cook all day and whenever someone shows up-its ready!  My FAVORITE

This soup, WITH the garnishments was pretty good.  The soup all by itself would just be "ok" I think.  We garnished it with shredded mexican cheese, sour cream and lime juice.  And I was surprised at what a difference the lime juice makes!  It adds just the right touch.  We also baked the corn tortillas brushed with oil and seasoned with salt and pepper and they were great!  My kids loved eating the little crunchy strips!  Even though this wasn't the best soup I've ever had, it was good and I will probably be making it again.  Almost forgot~ I made a few small changes...used all chicken broth instead of chicken broth and water and I doubled the chili powder.  Also put in a slightly larger can of green chilies than what it called for.

Very good.  Enchilada sauce is a MUST.  I skipped the cilantro, just because I forgot it at the store, and unless you really like the flavor of it - don't bother, still very good without it.  Serve with sour cream, cheese and chips.  I get requests for this recipe every time I make it!

I really wasnt impressed with this recipe as a soup. I eventually drained the liquid and we used the filling in tortillas, which was good.

Oh so yummy!  I left out the bay leaf and added a can of black beans to it! I also used the larger sized enchilada sauce. I love this soup. You should definitely try!

Best recipe I've found on all recipes!  I add black beans and sometimes remove the chicken.  Trader Joe's has the best enchilada sauce for this soup!

Excellent!!  I used the 10 Minute Enchilada Sauce recipe on this site instead of canned and added a can of drained black beans.  Soooo delish...can't stop eating it and so simple to make.

This was a quick easy recipe, especially with cooked leftover chicken and homemade chicken stock. Dosen't necessarily need to simmer in a crockpot but it probably helps the flavor. Will make again. Also used Bill's taco seasoning from this site instead of all the spices listed.

Easy to throw together.  Used a 5 quart crock pot - doubled the recipe and it filled the pot.  Added 1 can of black beans drained + some cooked rice.  Used some leftover turkey.  The tortilla strips and shredded cheese complete the soup.  Will add this to the rotation.

I thought I was following the instructions exactly.  I am not sure why but it just didnt "wow" me like I thought it would.  My husband dutifully ate it after adding his habinaro sauce but the kids were suddenly full after only a couple of bites. It just smelled better than it tasted to us!  I think I will try something else next time though.  We like to really enjoy our food and this wasn't it.  I want a "Wow-zer" for a chicken tortilla soup

Yum! I usually make the slow cooker chicken from this site and use the left over chicken the next day for this. I love this the way it is but my husband thinks it's missing something, so I now add black beans.

Excellent! I bought a cooked rotisserie chicken which is easy and delicious. Throw in a can of black beans to give it more substance as a meal, and top with tortilla chips, cheese, and fat free sour cream. I have made this twice, but been asked for the recipe by every person who has given it a try!

Loved it. Used 3 frozen chicken breasts and added a can of black beans rinsed. I must have used too much spices because it was pretty spicy, but oh, so good. Perfect. Will make this again for sure.

This soup is better than the restaurants, and I am in California. We have some of the best Mexican restaurants around! Give this one a try! I shred some jack cheese and sprinkle it in the hot soup. Top it with some sliced avocado too! So good!

Fantastic, everyone in the house loved this soup- in fact I got requests to make it again 3 days later!  I only made a few small additions to this- added black beans, and hominy and used only chicken stock instead of any water. Superb!

This is the BEST tortilla soup I have ever had!!!  As other reviewers have mentioned, I too use frozen chicken breasts, I start off on high for the first 2 to 3 hours, remove the chicken to shred, then return shredded chicken to the pot and turn down to low for several hours.  I always make a double batch, as this soup goes quickly at our house!  I top the soup with packaged tortilla strips purchased at a local food service and shredded cheddar...YUMMO!!!

I made this soup for a team potluck at work and it was the first thing to get eaten. Everyone loved it! Just like most of the other reviews I only used chicken broth (no water) and i added corn, black beans and rice. It made it so much better and more filling. And you dont have to use the slow cooker if you dont want to. This is easy to make on the stove in a pot. Also, use pre-cooked canned chicken to make it even easier. Either way, I will be making this again and again and again!

I threw everything in the crock pot this morning and it turned out wonderful :) SO easy to make and perfect for those of us who like to be done with dinner early in the day so that they can focus on other things. I did make the tortilla strips from corn tortillas as the recipe says to do and I really believe this added a little something extra. However, I am sure chips would work fine too. If you make your own, you could add whatever seasoning you like before placing them in the oven just for extra flavor. I just added salt + pepper. I do believe this soup needs MORE salt than called for in the recipe. Maybe an extra teaspoon? Overall, this dish was a hit with our family. Thank you!

Very good recipe.  I cubed raw chicken and seasoned it with Goya's Adobo and browned it in a dutch oven.  I then cooked the soup right in there for about an hour on low.  I also added an envelope of Goya's sazon, and used my own home grown jalapenos instead.  Yummy!  A keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a very good idea for a soup but not 5 star worthy as is. I added all ingredients into the crockpot and like others, I used 3 frozen chicken breasts instead of pre-cooked and let them simmer with the soup. I also added 2 cans of Rotel in lieu of the tomatoes & green peppers separate. Finally, I added a bag of frozen Southwest Veggies which contained Corn, Bell Pepper, Black Beans and Broccoli bits. With the added ingredients/changes I feel made this a MUCH better soup.

This was great. I made this for the boyfriend and I.  We are still enjoying the leftovers.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of black beans.  But other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I may have put in a pinch more of chili powder, but I like it a little spicy.  I don't know if it even needed that, it was plenty spicy for me.  I put in chicken breast raw into the slow cooker and just shredded them right before serving.  So easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I pureed the onions, garlic, chiles, tomatoes, and spices together before adding to the crockpot.  I used 2 frozen chicken breasts and heated on low for about 7 hours.  I used a can of corn instead of frozen, adding it about 30 minutes before serving.  I shredded the chicken at the very end and topped each serving with 3 drops of (not fresh) lime juice, fresh cilantro, avocado slices, and 1/2 T sour cream.  Tortilla chips were served as a side.  Big hit.

OUTSTANDING! I love the flavor of this recipe and the ease of making it. My husband said I could make it every week!  And it's so healthy, too.  I followed the recipe, except I added raw chicken breasts to the crock pot, then shredded them and put them back.  I also made it mild, since I have a toddler, so I substituted green peppers for the chiles.  I also added a can of black beans.  Served it with tabasco sauce, crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheese, cubed avocados, and cornbread on the side.  Delicious!

My husband and I loved this and so did our 2.5 yr old son.  I used extra chicken broth instead of water and added a can of black beans, plus diced a tomato I happened to have sitting on the counter.  I used 2 chicken breast halves, didn't pre-cook the chicken, and I shredded it about half way through.  We topped each serving with shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.  10 minutes was way too long for the tortillas.  After only 8 minutes I had to throw my first batch away.  4 minutes was about right - another 30 seconds and I think they would have been inedible.

This one is darn tasty!  I did put more fresh lime juice on it when it was done and also used hot enchilada sauce.  I'm a cilantro lover and put tons more in it!  This is a keeper folks!!!

The first time I made this, I didn't have regular red enchilada sauce so I used green and LOVED it.  I have made this several times and there are never any leftovers despite how much it makes!  This recipe is requested in our family often.  The fresh lime is also a must.

Very good soup! Even my picky eaters loved it.  Didn't have time to put it in the crockpot so I just made it on the stove.  Only had green enchilada sauce so I used that and added black beans instead of corn.  My husband said it was one of the best soups I've made.  Definitely a keeper!  Instead of the tortilla strips I made cheese quesadillas for everyone.

I wanted to love this after reading the reviews but it just fell flat...really flat. I followed the recipe but it just was not was I was expecting. Adding 1 1/2 cups of rice at the end helped. I used black beans and 4 frozen breasts on the advice of other reviewers. I won't be making this again. :(

I thought this recipe was great. It's one that you can play around with. Just like the other reviews say, I would totally add more broth and try adding black beans. It adds more to the soup. Also, I threw in 2 frozen chicken breasts and it worked out great. Cilantro, lime and cheese are great garnishes as im sure sour cream would be as well. Very good!

This was really good and really easy.  I took other reviewers advice and put in three frozen chicken breasts at the beginning and shredded them right before serving.  I also used all chicken broth and no water.  I added a can of drained and rinsed black beans for more fiber and deliciousness.  I served it with sour cream, avocado, tortilla chips and shredded cheese.

Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  My husband, who likes nothing with shredded chicken, loved this soup.  I only tweaked this recipe a bit for our taste.  I didn't use any water.  I used 3 cans chicken broth.  I used diced jalapenos instead of green chili peppers.  This first time I made it, I used the whole 4 oz. can.  Too hot even for me.  Cut back just a little.  I threw in a can of black beans drained and rinsed.  Used petite diced tomatoes.  Next time I make it, I am going to add some cooked rice at the end.  Will make again and again.  Probably one of my favorite soups.

very simple slow cooker recipe; very well accepted by all my guests with no alterations; one could alter the heat of the dish by simply garnishing with a hot salsa; addition of lime and fresh cilantro is important to overall taste

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was amazing!  As suggested in some of the reviews, I garnished it with avocado, fresh lime juice & a dollop of lite sour cream.  I didn't have cheddar cheese so I shredded a little pepper-jack instead, which worked really well.  I will definitely be making this soup again!  Yum!!

i have tried many tortilla soup recipes. This is the best. I didnt have time to do it in the slow cooker. poached the chicken in the broth and the juice from the canned corn i used(adds flavor). Then cooked the rest of the ingredients until done and then added the chicken and cilantro at the end. I use corn chips crushed on top. I wanted the leftovers for luch, but my husband beat me to it!

This is a great basic recipe.  I added considerably more enchilada sauce, so my base would be a bit hardier (I essentially doubled the recipe, but tripled the enchilada sauce). Also, instead of using water, I used chicken broth. Definitely a keeper!

Short and simple, FORGET the WATER, add EXTRA Enchilada Sauce, add 2 LBs plus of chicken instead of 1. The rest is perfect.

I put everything but the corn in the pot in the evening including 3 whole frozen chicken breasts and let it set in the refridgerator. In the morning I turned the crock pot on high for 3 hours, shredded the meat, then turned it down to low.  I used a medium spice enchilada sauce and a 7 oz can of green chilies. WONDERFUL!

Family favorite.  I make it easier by tossing in a couple of frozen chicken breasts in the morning then use forks to pull the meat apart when I get home from work.  I also just buy a bag or tortilla chips and use them on top after serving in bowls.

This soup is great by itself, and so amazing with a topping of sour cream and cheese! I left out the green chili peppers and added two cans of black beans and a diced red bell pepper, then spiced to my taste (heavy on the listed spices) with the addition of some homemade extra hot hot sauce, cayenne pepper, and oregano. Instant favorite!

I liked it, because I love spicy stuff, but my girlfriend didn't (and she doesn't like spicy stuff). So if you like spicy food, give this one a try.

I tried this version of chicken tortilla soup and it is by the far the best I've ever had.  I have made it on several occasions and every for friends.  All agree it is better than restaurant quality.  One change I did make was substituting chicken stock for the water portion.  I also add black beans.  It is delicious and a family favorite!!

My crockpot was engaged this morning so I made this in a big pot. I used the last of my pre-cooked chicken I had in my freezer, organic diced tomatoes (that was all I had on hand), homemade enchilada sauce made with organic tomato juice/sauce, I eliminated the water, used two cans organic chicken broth and tripled the spices. Because I'm trying to watch my carb intake and bump up my veggie intake, instead of corn I added three chopped zucchini, half a head of cabbage and two large organic red peppers. So far, this soup is awesome. I'll update my review once it's had time to simmer and combine flavors. With any recipe, it's really all about the quality of ingredients that you use. I think using organic ingredients and more spices, this made my soup really sing.

I  thought this would thicken up some how but it was just really brothy.  I liked the flavor but it needed some binding, I thought.  I made Mexican Rice II and then put that in the bowl and put some of the soup over.  That was very good.  I also added a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  Since I used rice I didn't use the tortilla chips.  Adding a dollop of fat-free sour cream hit the spot.  With these changes, it's a great recipe and very easy to throw together with the frozen chicken tenders.  Beware, it makes a TON, but from the other reviews I see that it is freezable.  In the freezer the leftovers will go, into individual ziplocks for later meals.

This was decent. I'd leave out the corn next time. And add fresh avocado slices when serving.

This was delicious! The only change I made was I used a lot more chicken broth (2 quarts total) since I have a larger sized Slow Cooker and love a soup that has a lot of broth. Other than that, I followed everything else exactly and it turned out perfect in the end..compares to El Torito's famous tortilla soup!

Love it! I was running late and just threw everything into a large soup pot on the stove and simmered it for 30 minutes..... turned out perfectly! Garnish it with a little grated cheese, avacado and sour cream.... YUM! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Wonderful!  I added some canned black beans and fresh carrots and celery to give my daughter some extra veggies.  I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on each individual bowl, and this was a huge hit with my husband and daughter.

very good soup! I did do some tweaking - I used a quart of chicken broth instead of water, I added two cans of "Ranch Style Black Beans" (not drained), I added the chicken in frozen at the beginning and then shredded it about 6 hours into the cooking time, I used dried cilantro instead of fresh and canned corn instead of frozen. I served it with lime flavored tortilla chips and shredded cheddar. Yum!

This is delicious!  I just put 3 large raw chicken breasts in the bottom of the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients on top and shredded them before serving.  It was perfect.  This will be added to our dinner rotation!

I used all chicken broth, no water and added a can of white beans and a can of black beans. I also had some leftover rotisserie chicken that I threw in at the last minute. My boyfriend who doesn't usually like any kind of soup loved this and said it was a keeper!

Very easy to put together.  Tastes Great.  It is very runny so next time I make this, I will add some instant potato flakes to thicken it.

Terrific recipe. Even better when you use fresh chiles and only half a can of the enchilada sauce (so that it doesn't overpower the soup). I also added some homemade chicken stock to give it a little kick in flavor. Yum

Wow, I thought this was fantastic!  Not quite spicy enough for me personally so I added a touch of hot sauce, just right for the rest of the family though.  As of now this will be my go to recipe for Tortilla soup.

This was fabulous! I made the enchilada sauce from scratch and because I had a full batch I nearly doubled the enchilada sauce it calls for....my hubby ate a great big bowl. We added some rice to bulk it up for a heartier dinner and I served it with corn muffins instead of tortilla strips (again, we like a full belly). Definitely will make again and plan on sharing this recipe with my friends!!

Great soup!  Just the right amount of spice for me.  I used hot enchilata sauce and omitted the can of green chilies.  Don't mess with cooking the chicken ahead of time and shredding it.  I did this about a half hour before I served it.

Excellent recipe to start off with. I am a beginner soup maker so I was a bit nervous but read others reviews and took their tips. The chicken shredded quite easily after about 3 hours on low in the slow cooker. I used chicken stock instead of water and broth. I also added black beans to help this be a more hearty soup. Its simple to make the tortilla strips yourself and worth the effort as they keep their crispness longer than any bag tortilla chip would once it's in the soup. We also served with optional monterey jack cheese blend. Easy to adjust how "spicey" this can be with measurements. Got good reviews at church today and Serving this to my kids tomorrow for dinner. My husband was quite happy with this as well. I would recommend keeping extra chicken stock on hand should more cook off than expected.

This gets 5 stars for both taste and ease! When my husband came home and saw that Mexican was on the menu he said, 'oh, I ate at Chiptole like 3 hours ago.' So he wasn't really in the mood for it again... or very hungry, for that matter. Anyway, the man went back for a heaping second helping! Both of us commented on how amazing it was! I took the advice of many previous reviewers. I threw 3 large frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot and replaced the water with more broth. I also added some sweet white corn. I shredded the chicken about 30 mins before serving and plopped it right back in. I had bowls of cheese, chopped avacado, and tortilla chips for everyone to add on their own. This was SOOO good! I'm so glad there are leftovers for tonite. My only change I would make next time would be to double the cilantro.

Absolutely fantastic. I served this at an impromptu dinner gathering and it got rave reviews. As other reviewers suggested, I started with frozen whole chicken breasts and took them out and shredded them before serving - which I believe kept the meat from drying out. I also used frozen fire-roasted corn (which they sell at Trader Joe's) which really gave it an added authentic punch. A squeeze of fresh lime was also very helpful. I put out a host of possible toppings from which guests could chose - lime wedges, diced avocado, fresh cilantro, sour cream, blue and yellow tortilla chips, diced green onion. It was a lot of fun!

So good!  I put frozen breasts in the crockpot, pull them out right before serving, shred them with two forks, then dump them back in the crockpot. I use a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole because my life is easier when soup doesn't have ingredients that are bigger than mouths of children. Plus, I find it silly to buy whole tomatoes and crush them when chopped tomatoes are available for the same price. I don't bake tortillas and just used tortilla chips instead. Tastes great and saves a bunch of extra work.

One of the bets slow-cooker recipes I've made, by far. The only things I did differently were cook the chicken in the soup and use a couple of fresh jalapeno peppers. Delicious!

This is an awesome soup.  Used homemade chicken stock for all liquid instead of water. Used Rotel for tomatoes and chiles. Did not have that much chicken - so there is maybe 1/4 cup there.  The major change I did was add a premixed 1/2 cup flour and 1 1/4 cup milk to the mix - so good.

I thought it was a little too spicy and watery, but my husband loved it! I think the next time I make it I will cut back on the water. Very good for those who like spicy foods!

This recipe is awesome!  To make it easier, I use rotisserie chicken.  I use green onion instead of the medium onion.  My kids love this too even though it is pretty spicy.

This was amazing!!!!  The picture doesn't do it justice! I discovered this recipe about 5 years ago and it has become a regular for us.  My family LOVES it!  They have 3 or 4 bowls.  Definitely use the crock pot.  I cook it on high for 4 hours ....  and I even add frozen chicken breasts at the beginning and it turns out fab.!   Just a note:  use GOOD quality enchilada sauce!   I also add olives (cause my family is nuts about olives) and a jalapeno to spice it up a bit.  We like spicey!  We also fry the tortilla strips (rather than bake them) for the topping (yellow corn tortillas).   When it is time to dish up, we also added a few more toppings to our bowl: mexican blend shredded cheese, diced avacado, the fried tortilla strips, and a splash of lime juice.  YUMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   FYI - is freezes beautifully ...... comes back to life, no problem!

Fantastic and easy! Every ingredient plays a part. I love the corn in this especially. I would agree that freshly made enchilada sauce is easy enough and worth the time. This is a fantastic soup.

Wonderful soup!  I added a can of drained/rinsed black beans and used petite diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

When my mother was carrying me in her womb, Mexican food was always her treat & now I'm heavily addicted to Mexican food & I must say that this is easy, authentic and VERY delicious!  I've been trying to find ways to use this crock pot that a friend gave me for Christmas over a year ago.  I took ILKAHAD's advice and just placed the uncooked chicken in with everything else and shredded the chicken about 4 hours in.  Also, I used fresh peppers (serrano & a hint of habenero) and squeezed juice from one lime into the soup mixture.

Excellent soup...very easy and my fairly picky family loved it! I used the roasted chicken, but would try it with chicken breasts cooked right along with the soup next time. My family doesn't like corn, so I used a can of small white beans. The tortilla strips are so much better than bag tortilla chips...tossed them with a pinch of salt before baking. Make extra, because everyone picks at them before they go on the soup! I topped mine with sliced avocado and served with grilled cheese on a snowy day. Perfect!

Awesome soup!  My husband loved it too!  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I substituted a few things;  I used frozen lean ground beef  and broke it up about half way through cooking; instead of the enchilada sauce I used a jar of mild salsa and about a cup of strained tomatoes, roasted chipotle peppers in place of the chile's and I put in about a teaspoon of lemon juice.  I used other people's advice and used multigrain nachos.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream and Tex Mex grated cheese.  The mild salsa with the chipotle peppers gave it a sweet/hot flavour.  My husband had 2 bowls and then took it for lunch the next day!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  It's okay as a base or starting point, but if you don't dress it up I think it's kind of bland.  I added 1/2 tsp more of cumin and chili powder and another tsp of salt and it was still flat.  I added the juice of 1 lime wedge, shredded colby and monterey jack cheese, and jalepeno cheddar tortilla strips to each bowl.  With the extras it was excellent.  Be advised if you make this recipe you better dress it up with something before you serve it.  And the recipe made as-is is not spicy at all, so if you like some heat you better add something for that also.

This was the very first recipe I tried from this site. My mother requests it all the time. When I took a batch to work for a Black Friday potluck, my boss and two other coworders HUGGED me! (This experience also convinced me that I need a slow cooker with a locking lid, but that's another story.) My modifications: more broth instead of water, golden hominy, black beans and southwestern corn instead of frozen corn, no chicken (vegetarian), 1 tsp of cayenne for added flavor, and a dash of lime juice just before serving. I also dump a truly ridiculous amount of shredded cheese in my own bowlful.

Wonderful recipe!  As others had suggested I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and then shredded them towards the end of the cooking time.  I also used store bought tortilla chips to keep it simple.  It turned out great.  Very rich and hearty!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I cannot believe how delicious and EASY this soup is.  I made a few minor changes b/c of what I had on hand, and it still turned out good.  I used 2 frozen chicken breasts, a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes instead of whole, 2 cans of chicken broth instead of water, and a can of black beans drained and rinsed.  Just dumped all into the crockpot and turned on low all day.

We all loved this, even the kids (ages 6,9,14).  I crushed tortilla chips into my bowl because I was not up to making them from scratch.  Maybe next time.  There will definitely be a next time!  I used green enchilada sauce because we love it but next time I will try the red sauce and see if we still like this soup.

This was a wonderful base recipe from which I made more of a southwest style soup. I took advice from other  reviews and added black beans. (worth it!) I also added rice. (eh, so so). And Zuchini (mmmm buttery & spicy). A rotissere chicken from local mart shredded. (easy and good.) Be careful if you make the homemade strips. (They go from golden to oh #@*% quick). I used mexican style stewed canned tomato (easy/effective).  I garnished w/ fresh pico (hail the food processor) sour cream, fresh lime wedges, and avacado chunks. This recipe is a definate keeper either to use to the T or adapt your own querky spin off.

While this was certainly an easy soup to make it wasn't anything special. Both my husband and I commented that it had no distinct taste.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I omitted the tsp of salt (why do you need to add salt to a recipe that has over 900 mg of sodium in each serving??????).  I was excited to find this recipe that so many raved about only to be disappointed.

excellent! put the chicken in frozen and chopped up with 2 hours to go. Added corn chips on top and avacado/sour cream/cilantro. Only used half can of green chiles as I have small kids and was worried about spice. Used no water, just extra enchilada sauce and broth..made it more stew like that way as well. Fantastic, will make again!

I use a can of Rotel in place of the tomaotoes and use all chicken broth instead of water.  I also sliced zuccini for the last two hours as well as a can of drained black beans the last hour. We like it spicy so I use a large can of enchilada sauce and up the cayenne pepper.  Even the kids love it.  We garnish it with avocado and cheese.  Tastes even better the next day!

We loved this at my house. Even my 2 and 5-year-old kids ate it! I put 2 uncooked chicken breasts in the slow cooker instead of cooked chicken and shredded it an hour before serving. For the liquid portion of the recipe I used all chicken broth except for 1 cup of water. I also rinsed a can of black beans and added them with the other ingredients. My tortilla strips didn't turn out well (maybe I didn't put enough oil on them) so I just used tortilla chips and that was easier and extremely tasty. Finally, we ate the soup with diced avocado, sharp cheddar cheese, and sour cream. I can't wait to eat leftovers!

I really liked this recipe!  Very little work, but very good taste.  Instead of enchilada sauce I used a packet of enchilada seasoning.  I also threw in some black beans and a few tablespoons of salsa.  Delicious!

Very good!!!  The only thing I'm going to change the next time I make it is to add a splash of hot sauce.  It just needs a little bit of zing, and I think once I do that, it'll be perfect!

This is a family favorite. Hubby likes the fact that it's more authentic, and less like chili. I make my own enchilada sauce, which gives it a little bit more kick.

This was good.  I made it in my stock pot on the stove because I didn't start it until the afternoon.  It still came out fine, just simmered for a few hours.  I altered a few things just because of what I had on hand: I did not pre-cook the chicken, I took 2 large breasts, cut them into bit sized pieces and added them as called for (I would do the same in the crock pot too); I chopped up some banana peppers instead of the chopped chilis.  We'll keep this and I'll continue to make some changes here and there, all in all a good recipe.

This was a great recipe!  I added a can of rinsed black beans.  Halved the recipe because of just two of us, and it was fabulous.  Used chicken breast I pre cooked in the microwave.  I don't care for uncooked chicken in crockpot broth, it gets foamy.  Didn't have cumin, so I used red pepper and only used half the amount.  Will make this again!

So good!!! This soup was amazing. I put the chicken in frozen and then shredded about 4 hours later. I added black beans, corn, minute rice, 2 tsp garlic and it was perfect. We topped it off with lime, green onions, cheese, avocados and chips. Amazing!

Oh, my gosh....is this soup ever so good!!  This is the first time I've ever had Tortila Soup.  The ingredients looked healthy and low in fat so after reading some of the reviews, I made it over the weekend.  I also used one can of black beans.  Loved the tortilla strips as well.  Plan on making more of this soup this coming weekend.  Oh, make sure you put in the cilantro-it's a must!  Also, I put in my chicken raw and shredded it when my soup was done.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Thanks!

This soup was amazing!  It was a hit with my husband and kids too!  I did what other people said and to make it easy I just threw in 3 uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  When the soup was done I picked the breasts out with a fork, cut them into pieces and threw them back in.  I used 3 cans of chicken broth and no water.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  I bought the pre-made tortilla strips from the store (Santa Fe Style) and otherwise everything else was the same.  I garnished with avocado, sour cream, grated chedder cheese and the tortilla strips.  Excellent and easy to do!!

Awesome recipe!  Added a jar of salsa and black beans.  Threw in chicken breasts raw as others suggested and shredded after a few hours.  Used bagged tortilla chips, garnished with jalapenos, sour cream, cheese, green onions, lime juice.

Incredibly easy to make. I was running really late and decided to make this quick recipe. Cleaning was easy because our pot was scraped-clean and my picky-eater (my husband) had 3 servings, and my two year old cleaned her own plate, twice! I used canned corn and packaged pre-cooked chicken and was amazed by the quality, the richness, and flavors. If you don't like thing to be too spicy, you can use less enchilada sauce (or buy a milder one), as well as use bell peppers versus spicy peppers, and don't use as much chili powder. It will definitely be one of our most used recipes.

This was very easy to make but the heat and spices we so overwhelming I had to dilute it to make it edible.  My husband loves spicy food but this was over the top.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated so I don't know what went wrong.  I even made my own chicken stock for the base.  The only thing that saved it was adding some salt, more cilantro and lime juice to cut back on the heat.  Way too spicy for me and my daughter for sure.  I will not make this again.

I loved this recipe!  I cooked my thighs the night before, and saved the juice for my broth.  In the morning, I mixed everything together and used more broth than water.  I forgot the green chilies, so I used some Rotel.  It was ok, but next time I will get mild Rotel instead of original because it was kind of spicy, but not bad.  I have hard time eating much spicy food, but this did not bother me.  It is definitly one that I will make over and over again!!

Excellent dish.  My whole family enjoyed it.  To save time I serverd it with tortilla chips from the store and I used canned chicken breast.

This soup is amazing.  I live in San Antonio TX and actually have a hard time finding really good tortilla soup. This is the best Ive had by far.  Followed this recipe almost to the T.  I did use bullion instead of canned broth and also added about 3/4 can of Rotel that I had left over.  All else was the same.

Wow, this looked to easy to be good, but I was so wrong.  It is outstanding, and I am usually a pretty critical cook.  The only sub I used is putting 3 fresh chicken breasts (raw) in instead of the cooked chicken.  I let it cook for 8 hours and it shreds itself. I topped the soup with crushed tortilla chips from the bag and reduced fat coby jack shredded cheese. DELICIOUS!!!

This was so good.  I don't change recipes I just have to use what I have sometimes instead of what it calls for.  I used diced tomatoes instead of whole and I used garlic salt in place of garlic cloves.  I cooked the chicken in the soup all day and then shredded it.  This was extremely good with a lot of flavor and so easy.  I will double it next time to have leftovers.  Also I figured out that the whole batch is only 17 points on Weight Watchers so it is very healthy.

This is a really good recipe. The only reason it only got 4 stars is that I changed it slightly. Instead of the enchilada sauce and whole canned tomatoes, I substituted one 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (healthier -less sugar), used a can of Trader Joe's canned corn (not drained) instead of frozen corn and added the cilantro as a garnish. Absolutely de-lish!!!

AMAZING!  This is the best chicken tortilla soup I've had.  The only changes I made were: adding a whole chicken breast and letting it cook in the soup, shredding it just at the end of cooking time and I omitted the tortilla strips.  I will DEFINATELY be making this again!

I was so excited for this after seeing the rating.  I have to say this was nothing special.  If we hadnt added all of the shredded cheese and crumbled chips on top, it would have been just very ordinary.  We will not be making this again at my house.

This soup was just what we were looking for on a cold winter day. I saw no reason to cook the chicken first so I took it out at the end and shredded it and put it back in. I think next time I will add more chicken and less water so it is a little thicker. I liked the idea od using enchilada sauce. Very flavorful. I did need to add a touch more salt to bring out the flavor. Could'nt have been easier. I will put the tortilla chips in the bowl first instead of on top. I think that will give it more tortilla flavor and a better texture. Will definitely make again.

I omitted the enchilada sauce and water, and instead used 4 cups chicken stock (2 cups reduced-sodium boxed broth, and 2 cups sodium-free boillion type broth). I used defrosted chicken breast tenderloins and shredded after cooking 3 hours on high, then continued on low for 2 hours. It was AWESOME!! Thanks for the recipe and sorry I changed it (my husband needs low sodium foods only due to high blood pressure)

I used all chicken thighs, chicken broth and no water. I added black beans, canned fiesta corn and two tablespoons canned chopped jalapenos. I also chopped the chicken and put it in the pot uncooked. This turned out great with the perfect amount of kick. Will be making this over and over and over. I might add more chicken next time is all.

this is delicious! my husband ate 3 bowls! next time im going to try putting some corn tortillas in the broth about 20mins before serving, just to try to give it more of a tortilla flavor. used corn chips as a topper with avo, cheese, sour cream & cilantro, and im happy there are leftovers!

Chicken tortilla soup is one of my favorites, and this one was super easy and very good!!  I played around with the ingredients just a bit, added a little here and took out a little there, but nothing major.  It had a great taste, and was even better the next day!

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times.  I put in raw, washed chicken breast and shred them an hour or two before serving.  Works great.  Also freezes well.

Suggest just tossing in the chicken frozen/raw into the crockpot.  Seems to cook more moistly this way.  Great recipe!

Delicious soup. Very simple to make, and easy to make personal additions to. I didn't use enchilada sauce because of an allergen issue so used an extra can of tomatoes.

Ive been making this recipe for a couple of years now.  I've tweaked it a little and wanted to share.  Instead of using a bag of corn, I use one can of corn, one can of of a light bean and one can of a dark bean (usually black or dark kidney)  It is so versatile.  I add the chicken raw or even frozen and it breaks apart later in the day.  I only use bouillon and water and no salt.

This was wonderful!  Did add a can of black beans but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Took everything to a friend's house and we were both truly satisfied.  I'm so glad I have some left over for tomorrow.  Big freeze going on here now and this really hit the spot.

This is a keeper if your looking for authentic taste. This was super easy to make and my entire family loved it! We go to Mexico twice a year and everyone in my family eats this several times while we are there. They only reason I gave it 4 starts was b/c I added a few toppings that it is served with in Mexico. I served this was toppings on the side---cubed Monteray Jack cheese, sliced avacoado and sour cream. I also added a splash of lime juice. Delicious!!!

i thought this was a wonderful tortilla soup! it really had a wonderful flavor. Im from california and grw up with a big hispanic food influence, but my hubby grew up in the south so he has never tasted tortilla soup and really he did not understand why thee was lime and avacado etc etc so for him he just isnt used to this type of soup... me i loved it i just need to figure out how to make just enough for me instead of cooking it for the family!!!

The whole family like this one. It was slightly too spicy for the kids...so next time I'd take it easy on the peppers and chili powder...otherwise this was very good. I would definitely recommend!

I have made this recipe for years!  It is delicious, and is really 'restaurant quality' tasting.  Sometimes if I don't have corn on hand, I add black beans instead.  Versatile recipe worthy of experimenting with or making AS IS!

This recipe is great.  I did change it up a bit by adding 1 can of Cream of Chicken Soup and 1 can of Chili Beans.  Excellent base however. I ate mine by crushing some doritos, then added the soup, with sour cream and cheese on top.  My husband ate just the soup and loved it.  Thanks, Elena.

My daughter made this for us as a light meal when we arrived at her home the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and I couldn't wait to make it. It is so easy to put together and it is just great to come home to a delicious dinner with no fuss after a long day at work. Add a salad and you are set.

Amazing!! I doubled the recipe and there still wasn't any left.  Followed others suggestions and did not use any water, just chicken broth.  For a doubled recipe, I used 1 1/2 quarts total because we like our soup chunky.  I also added 1 large can of black beans (drained).   I made it with boneless chicken breasts and boneless thighs.  You can definitely put them in whole and shred them once they are fully cooked. This is a definite keeper.

Replaced cumin with red pepper. Added 1 can black beans and heaping tsp of paprika. We all loved it, and it was very easy!!  We just used the scoopable chips, not the tortilla that the recipe called for

My family LOVED this!!!  We ate it as a meal and my family does not eat soup for a meal - my son asked for more corn lol...I think I will add some pinto beans and hubby said it needed more chicken - I used canned for ease, next time I will shred 2 lbs of boiled or grilled chicken.   Awesome Recipe!!

I love great slow-cooker recipes!  This soup is really good, wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.  I probably would be inclined to give it 5 but I have several similar recipes that are all very good.. guess I'm holding out for one to be "the one" and knock my socks off.  I would definitely make this one again.  Has some spice to it but we added even more.

Super easy, super tasty! I also used frozen chicken breasts and added some black beans.  I realized I ran out of cumin so I used some taco seasoning.  We topped it with cheese, sour cream and corn chips.  I am looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks!

Easy and delish - the meal to make when you're not in the mood to cook.  :)  Like several others suggested, I used chicken broth in place of water, plopped frozen chicken breasts in to save time and even used a bag of tortilla chips -- mega time saver and just as scrumptious.  I also serve with a spoonful of sour cream in each bowl and sprinkle with taco cheddar cheese.  I've made this several times now for various people and always get rave reviews.  A sure thing!

I wanted something that tasted like Resaurant Tortilla soup and this is very close. I just make it on the stove. and make is very simple and it tastes great. boil chicken breast in sauce and then shred. I add black beans and use diced tomatoes with chiles. My family loves this dish!

This soup was wonderful!!  I have tried it using homemade enchilada sauce and roasting my own chilies, and it is richer as some others suggested, but for a fix it and forget it recipe this is the best!  If you follow the recipe, and throw the chicken in frozen and leave it alone all day, you end up with a great soup that everyone will want seconds of!  I have passed this recipe on to many friends who have raved over it! Thank you :)

Amazing!  I changed it just a bit.  I left the chicken raw and just diced it up finely.  They were so moist when the soup was done.  I used 2 boxes of broth instead of using water and broth.  I added green beans along with the corn for some extra veggies, and substituted a can of lightly drained diced tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes.  And finally, what made it perfect was adding a cup of cooked wild rice about 30 minutes before serving!  This soup was amazing! It's not very spicy, so don't be scared!

I would have to say that this is the best recipe I have tried from this site.  The only thing I really changed was I used a large can of Rotel instead of the individual cans of tomatoes and green chiles.  I also took everyones suggestions and added a cup of cooked white rice right before serving as well as avacado, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.  I think making your own tortilla strips really makes it!  It was a big hit and something I will make it again and again!

I followed a few of the other reviewers and just added the chicken in uncooked, I also added a can of black beans, drained and instead of frozen corn I used a can of the Trader Joe's corn. It turned out wonderful! Served with lime wedges, sour cream and shredded sharp cheddar. I am totally adding this to my basic crock pot recipe rotation!  Also, I made the tortilla strips with reduced fat tortillas, a tiny bit of olive oil and some chili powder and sea salt and they turned out AMAZING!

I made this a few nights ago and it was delicious!!! I did use a 19oz can of enchilada sauce instead of 10oz, about 1.7 lbs of chicken, & the 2 cups of water I kept as is. I followed advice of another and used some corn starch at the end to thicken the soup. I made at least twice as many of the tortilla chips as we really loves these is the soup. put some chips & cheese in the bottom of a bowl, ladled the soup on top and put sour cream, more chips & lots more cheese for garnish & flavor. If you plan to use cheese & sour cream don't add too much corn starch since these will thicken the soup as well. An absolutely amazing soup, thanks!!!

I was surprised at how much my family liked this - especially the homemade chips, which I'll be making for snackage!  Next time I make it, I will use a little less onion, a little less corn, and add black beans.  This time around I added a little rice, which I'm not sure I'll do again.  Be sure to use fresh cilantro!

It was decent. I used mild enchilada sauce and just regular diced tomatoes. We also didn't use the corn and used black beans instead. I would try using rotel next time for a little bit more of a kick. Definitely serve with lime, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, and chips.

Followed other poster's suggestion and used all chicken broth instead of part water. Threw in frozen chicken breasts and shredded after 3 hours on high. Then threw in a cup of raw brown rice and cooked another 2 hours.Omitted the corn and cilantro and we don't care for them and i thought it turned out excellent. Topped with tortilla chips and shredded cheese. Great left over too! Not too spicey. Kind of like a great new chicken soup!

This was good - subbed crushed tomatoes for the whole, mashed but other than that I followed the recipe.  Could use a little something more, not sure what.  Overall a good soup though!

I know that many things might have come from a can w/this recipe, but it was amazingly good and tasted like a restaurant quality tortilla soup. (: I did use freshly cooked chicken, chicken broth, and incorperated 2 cans of kidney beans instead of corn. A total time saver, and therefore a keeper. Garnish w/ avacado, cilantro, cheese of choice, dried chile ancho (as per taste), and lime juice if you want a real authentic taste.

My family really enjoyed this soup. Great for a chilly Fall dinner.  I used uncooked boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts, a 15 oz. can of enchilada sauce, hot green chile peppers which added alot of heat, chicken broth(no H2O)and black beans. I also added a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes, for extra flavor. I served this with avocado, sour cream(a MUST to cool the heat from the peppers) and bagged tortilla chips which were perfect (and easy!) I would take other readers suggestions and add the corn closer to the end of cooking so it would retain its flavor. This is definitely a Keeper!!!

The good thing about this recipe is that it's relatively healthy.  The bad part is that it's a really strange tasting chicken tortilla soup.  It seems to be missing something in the flavor department.

I tried this recipe and it's GREAT. I did make a couple of changes though/ I substituted the broth and water with chicken stock. And used rotisserie chicken from Costco. And I added a can of black beans. My family loves it. I will definitely be cooking this again as well as sharing it with others. Thank you for the great recipe.

This is a great recipe--it's easy to make, tasty, and there's plenty to share!  I adapted a few things to make it easier on myself--instead of buying the tomatoes and chilies separately I used two cans of Rotel, and as recommended by others I bought a bag of tortilla chilps and put my chicken breasts in the crockpot frozen.  Took it to a tailgate party before our son's football game and everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe on allrecipes.com!!

This soup was phenomenal!  I used chicken broth and a little water (I didn't have quite enough broth to use all broth) and added some black beans too!  Like other reviewers, I put the chicken right in the crock pot instead of cooking beforehand and that worked great!  It didn't cook for long enough because of a power outage and still turned out wonderfully!  Edit: I've made this soup lots since my first review.  Since then, my husband and I have cut down the amount of meat we eat.  Usually I use less chicken and add a can of black beans to beef up the protein.  We love it that way!  We usually make some brown rice and serve this over rice!

So yummy! Avocado and tortilla strips on top are a must. I added the chicken frozen and shredded it when the soup was almost done. Froze well too!

For once I followed the recipe exactly as written! This is a good soup, perfect for a busy Monday. I did not find it spicy. Since I didn't have any queso fresco we garnished with crumbled feta (plus the cilantro and fresh lime).

Excellent recipe all around! I used a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store to fork apart and shred. This gave a much richer flavor. Also cooked in a crock pot for 8 hours on high and it helped bring all flavors together.

Delicious! Definetly just throw the chicken breasts in frozen and shred towards the end.  I topped it with store-bought tortilla chips, avocado, shredded cheddar cheese, and a lime sour cream that was divine! Mixed about a 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream with a tbsp lime juice, diced red bell pepper, diced jalapeno, and chopped cilantro! YUM!

This was soooo good!  Instead of the water, I used a can of cream of chicken soup.  It had the perfect consistency.  I also added a can of rinsed black beans during the last half hour of cooking time.  I added Tapatio hot sauce to my serving to make it a bit spicier.  I used regular tortilla chips since I was short on time, but I will make my own tortilla strips next time.  I'll definately be making this often this winter.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Loved it, even the kids ate it!  Took the advice of other posters and added the chicken to cook and shredded it after it cooked and used store corn chips for ease, but will try it the other way too.  Great dish on a cold day!

This was an excellent soup!!  Very easy to prepare too!  I used a few tips of other reviewers, i.e. used frozen chicken breast, 2 cups chicken broth instead of water, and added the black beans.  I even made the homemade tortilla strips which were simple enough to make and made the soup even more authentic!  WOW...family loved it, especially my husband.  Definitely a keeper!!

Didn't have red enchilada sauce, so I used green and added some mild red taco sauce (about 3T.) and 1/2 a package of taco seasoning (omitting the seasonings called for in the recipe). Also added kidney beans for some extra substance. This came out SO delicious! I was very impressed (as was my husband and 3 year old picky son).

This is one of the best recipes I have ever come across. Honestly, make it like the recipe says or make a few adjustments, and it will still taste as great. WARNING if you want it to be a huge let down, use green enchilada sauce instead of red. This is awesome!! I make it rather often now because everyone loves it so much!

This soup is unbelievably good!  I made it without altering any of the instructions or ingredients and it was perfect.  There are only a few recipes that when you come across them you know instantly you are going to put them in the family recipe book... this is one of them.  We ate the entire thing in one night and wished there was more!

Awesome easy recipe.  I use frozen raw chicken breasts and just throw them into the crockpot w/ other ingredients.  It shreds up nicely.  I also add carrots and celery, cooked brown rice at the end, top w/ montery jack cheese, avocado, and some store bought tortilla chips! So good!!!

Delicious and very easy to make! I added a can of black beans (we love them and add them to lots of dishes) and used store-bought tortilla chips. We also chopped up a fresh avocado and added some to each bowl along with shredded cheese and a dab of sour cream. The additions definitely added to the fat/calorie count, but they were well worth it!

This recipe was excellent. When I first make a recipe, I follow the recipe exactly like it states,then when I make it again I make a few changes. The only  changes I made, I added 1 package of sazon by goya some adobo by goya, a can of rotels  (hot)diced tomatoes with chile , and a small 4 oz can of fire roasted green chile. You can find these items in the spanish aisle in your grocery store or any latin store. Next I prepared everything put it in the crock pot the night before, so that the uncooked chicken would marinate in the ingrediants. I also did what another person recommended and added black beans. When the soup was ready I garnished it  with fresh squeezed lime or lemon, sour cream, mild cheddar cheese, avacado slices and I bought a bag of tortilla chips by El Ranchero. Everyone enjoyed the recipe the original way I made it and the way I added ingrediants. Just your preferance

I found this to be the best tortilla soup I have ever eaten!  Its easy and when it got to the table I used store bought tortilla strips for garnish and it was just as good as if you prepared them in the oven yourself.  You can't go wrong with this recipe and one more thing, I boiled chicken thighs the day before, skinned them and reserved the liquid, skimming off the fat the next morning before I put it into the pot.  I find this cut of chicken much more tasty than the breast, a lot more flavorful.  Ole!

Cooked this the other day and the whole family loved it, even my son and that's saying something. I did like others mentioned and threw in frozen chicken breasts and then shredded a couple of hours later. Next time I am going to add 2 cans of tomatoes and some black beans too.

This is a fantastic, hearty, filling soup recipe. The baked tortillas and a lime wedge squeezed over and then tossed into the soup is what really took it from "very good" to "awesome." I am always looking for healthy, filling, easy recipes! Next time I might try adding some black beans and green onions as suggested by others.

TRy using fire roasted tomatoes in place of a can of crushed tomatoes.  adds a little different taste to it.........Then add some sour cream on top of the tortillas at the end.  This will change the diet quality of the recipe but is NUMMYY..................O TOTALLY AGREE with the review of akm5.......this is a quick but AWESOME recipe  for winter nites too............

By far, the BEST chicken tortilla soup I have EVER had!!!  We ate it for dinner for 4 days, and loved it every time!!  I cooked it on the stove top, as it was a last-minute dinner decision, and it was still super easy.  I used frozen chicken breast tenders, slightly defrosted in the microwave, and they were falling apart in the soup in less than 15 minutes.  Added a can of black beans, and topped with sour cream, cheddar, and store-bought tortilla chips-- I will be making this weekly!  Thanks so much, Elena!!

I use frozen chicken breasts, and by the time I get home from work in the evenings the chicken is super tender and falling apart.  I also add a can of drained, rinsed black beans.  Phenomenal!

As written, this recipe is 'ok'.  It really needed some additions to make it a hit with us.  We added black beans and more spices and heat.  We loved it once we doctored it up.

I took this in to a potluck at work and ran out early!  Did the avocado and it was perfect.  I used store bought tortilla chips for work.  When I made this at home I made the tortilla chips but I fried them, not baked them.  For some reason they just were not coming out correctly.

Yum! This was so good. Didn't have corn on hand, so left it out, but still was awesome anyway. Was having tile floor grout repaired while it was cooking in the slow cooker, and the repairman even asked me for my recipe it smelled so good... Tasted good too!

My family loves this soup!  Like others, we add black beans, skip the water and use extra chicken broth instead, and also skip the green chiles (because of texture, only).  We also use petite diced tomatoes instead of whole ones.  Sour cream was a good addition just before eating, but avocado was just too much for us.  We crumbled cheese and store-bought tortilla chips on top and served it with corn bread.  SUCH A GOOD MEAL!  I'm glad we found this one!

I bought my chicken from the deli at the grocery store. They shredded it for me right there.  Adding all the ingredients was no problem, just took a while.  I didn't see that a can of chicken broth was required, but luckily had an extra can on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly, not leaving anything out or adding extra (except for the baked tortilla strips).  I probably could have bought already mashed or sliced tomatoes instead of whole, but they were no problem to mash.  The soup turned out pretty good.  If I were to do it over again, I might add a spicy green chile mix, instead of mild, and maybe more chicken broth.  I ate it with whole wheat tortillas.  This is definitely a good crock recipe:)

Pretty darn good. I added a can of black beans as suggested by another member which was a great addition. Also, I just used a can of diced tomatoes. Leftovers were even better!!

This was pretty good. I did have to use a can of Rotel instead of separate tomatoes & Chilies because it's what I had on hand. I also did not pre-cook the chicken. Will make this again.

It was delicious! My husband loved it. I added a can of black beans and used oregano instead of cumin. I also used the juice of one lemon at the end. It was just as delicious the next day as leftovers.

I added 2 cups of cooked brown rice, black beans, and canned corn. I used all chicken broth instead of water. I took the advice of other reviewers & used frozen chicken breasts & shredded right before serving. Topped with toasted corn tortilla strips, cheese & sour cream. Amazing.

Great recipe; however, I did make some changes according to some reviews.  Good foundation though..better than any restaurant tortilla soup i've had.  I actually added 1/2 tablespoon of cumin; chili powder and salt.  I added approximately 4-5 tablespoons of chopped cilantro (i'm Hispanic so I love my spices)...I added 1 cup brown rice; 1/2 squash/zucchini; can of black beans.  I also topped with 2% shredded mexican cheese and diced avocado with squeeze of lime.  yum!!!  Both my husband and I Loved it!  We also had baked tortilla chips either on top or on the side.  We mixed all ingredients and brought to a boil and then we simmered for 30-45 minutes.  Perfect if you didn't get to do in the morning prior to leaving to work.  Thank you!

This is fantastic! I'm not a big fan of soup - but I LOVE this one.  The only additions I make to this recipe is I add 1 teaspoon of fajita seasoning and about 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro.  I also add diced avocados & a dallop of sour cream when serving.  The fresh lime juice squeezed in at the end is key! Fantastic recipe Elena :)

I rate this more than 5 stars! I make this weekly. Sometimes I add to it with extra things in my pantry. I really like to add in black beans and I like to use canned corn rather than frozen. I squeeze a lot of lime juice in mine.

I made a special trip to the store to make sure I had the exact ingredients. By the time I got home it was too late to use the slow cooker, so I tossed it all in a pot. I had leftover roast chicken.  This was THE best chicken tortilla soup I've had. I'ts so easy too. Thanks!

We will definitely make this again. It was so incredibly easy. We had our friend from Puerto Rico over for dinner, and said this was just like soup he has had there. My husband went back 3 times for more. The only thing I added was 1 chopped jalepeno.

This was delicious! But I'm only giving it 4 stars because of all the adjustments I made. I followed one suggestion and used frozen chicken breasts. That step made this incredibly easy recipe even easier! I omitted the water and used 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth. I added 1 can each of black, red, and pinto beans (drained and rinsed) to make it a heartier soup.  I also followed another suggestion and added finely crushed tortilla chips halfway through to make it thicker. The measurements for the spices I kept the same because the whole family likes spicy food. This soup also freezes really well. Thanks!

This was a great soup.  Used fresh tomatoes instead of the canned.  I also used EL PATO sauce instead of the enchilada sauce.  Very good. Thought I had chicken but ended up using steak.  Served with sourcream and cheese. Very good!!!

I made this for a friend for her birthday. Only I forgot about starting it early enough to slow cook so I just cooked it on the stove. Came out great. Even though we didn't use any spicy options, it still came out spicier than expected. Must have been the enchilada sauce?

This was so good, I went ahead and made the homemade tortilla chips  and as I read from some one else its worth it, I did not have any enchilada sauce so I used a jar of salsa that I had and it was great...somewhat hot but that is how my husband likes it...oh and I used 2 frozen chicken breasts and after they were cooked I just cut them off the bone and put them back in the soup. Hope you try it!  Thanks for the recipe

I've had much better versions than this.  Great idea, and I generally like this type of soup.  But this one is rather watery and there's not much in it.  It needs beans, more veggies.  And top with cheese.

My family love, love, loves this recipe. I always double it. I add extra chicken,  leave out the bay leaf and corn, use one can of mild & one can of medium enchilada sauce and use only 7 ounces of green chilis instead of doubling the four ounces.  I'm so thankful to CookinBug for coming up with it!!!

I was very skeptical of this recipe since the only CT soup I have ever had was from Chili's...Don't laugh.  I decided to try this recipe because of all the great reviews and it was simply delicious.  Put all the ingredients in the night before and it was done when I woke up the next morning.  So easy, and tastes so good.  I also threw the chicken in frozen.  It streads so easy after simmering all night.  Used 3 chicken breasts but next I will only use 2 breasts so it will have more broth.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

So delicious!  I didn't use the crockpot, instead just did it on the stovetop and it was ready in less than an hour.  I sauted the onions and garlic in some olive oil and then cut up 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and fried them until no longer pink and tossed everything into a stockpot to heat through. I also added some pinto beans and then served the soup over some rice (as suggested by another reviewer) and garnished with more cilantro and sour cream and added a bit of lime juice.  Great with the "hint of lime" tortilla chips!  Kids loved it too!

I have made this soup twice now and love it!  It's very healthy and super simple to make.  The best part about it is that I use frozen chicken breasts (we buy the large bags from Costco and always have them in the freezer).  The chicken literally falls apart at the end of the cooking time... delicious.  I added a can of black beans both times and used canned corn (because that's what I had on hand).  Both were great.  I am watching my weight and did not make the tortillas but I'm sure they're delicious too.  This will become an easy, go-to staple for our family!

This is a really one of the best recipes on this site i have tried. My daughter just loves it. The reciepe is fine as is but I make a few changes to mine...I added a little more chili powder and cumin, used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of the plain, and added a can of drained black beans. Oh also all chicken stock no water and the juice of one lime. And i agree with other reviews about making the chips yourself, my daughter like to help with that part and its really worth it! Thanks for the recipe!

This is definitely a keeper!  I used a qt of chicken broth, 3 large frozen chicken breasts and 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes.  Cooked on high for 4 hours and it turned out PERFECT.

I followed a reader's suggestion and added four frozen chicken breasts, then shredded them after they had cooked about 5 hours. This was extremely easy to make and very tasty. I cut the spices in half so it wasn't so hot.

I followed the advice of others and added frozen chicken breasts to the soup instead of cooking the chicken beforehand. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The soup was fantastic and my husband has been begging me to make it again!  This will definitely be a regular menu item in our house!

YUMMY YUM YUM!  I customized a bit (of course). Used approx 3 pounds boneless skinless thighs rather than breast, poached in 4 cups of chicken stock which I then strained and used as my liquid. Added the chicken back to the soup right before serving. No canned enchilada sauce (made my own), and served the soup over home made Mexican rice, topping it with sour cream, shredded jack, and crispy tortilla strips. Really, it tasted like we'd ordered it in a restaurant. Very good.

We loved this soup!  I followed the recipe with these exceptions: instead of using water, I just added more chicken broth.  So I used 1 carton of broth (32 oz.) instead of 1 can of broth and 2 cups of water. Also, I only had a 28 oz. can of whole peeled tomatoes, so I just threw in the whole thing.  AND I had accidentally opened a can of crushed tomatoes at first, so I also threw in about half of that (14 oz.).  (I thought it was a LITTLE too thin before the crushed tomatoes and I think they did the trick.)  Also added 2 cans of black beans. I did make the corn tortilla strips - YUM!  Worth the trouble, IMO.  And really, they were so easy to make!  Here's the secret - use a pizza cutter to cut the strips - I cut the tortilla in half first, and then just zipped through cutting the strips - the pizza cutter made it EASY, EASY, EASY!!!  (Also, I lightly salted the strips before baking with Kosher salt.) I did cook brown rice as some suggested and added a scoop of cooked rice to each bowl, pouring the soup over the rice. Finally, I served it with the following toppings: sour cream, sliced avocado, shredded cheese, and of course the tortilla strips.  I will definately make this again!

The soup was wonderful.  I had a problem with the tortilla strips.  10 minutes in the oven was way too long.  They were completely burnt.  I made a second batch and 4 minutes was perfect.  It probably depends on the size/brand of tortillas that you are using.

I made a couple of changes which I felt saved this soup (hence the 4 stars instead of 5): 1) DO NOT add water.  I used another can of chicken broth - can't imagine how bland this would have been with water; 2) at the end I added the juice of 1 lime (next time I might use 2).  These two things gave it a lot more flavor. I also used 7oz of green chiles just because that was the size I had on hand.  Next time, I will add some jalapenos or something to make it just a bit more spicy. It was very good after these changes.

This was superb.  I doubled the recipe for my family of seven and had plenty of yummy leftovers for lunch.  I cut corn tortillas in strips and deep fried them and sprinkled with Adobo seasoning.  It was an excellent topper.

This soup is fantastic!  I added a can of kidney beans and substituted hominy for the corn.  Crumbled baked blue corn tortilla chips on top along with grated cheese and diced avocado.  It literally took me 15 minutes to throw the ingredients into the slow cooker, but the flavor developed into a really rich-tasting delicious soup.  Will definitely make again.

Really tasty! Instead of cooking the chicken beforehand, I just added them raw to the slow cooker and shredded them after several hours. I added a can of pinto beans and replaced the water with more chicken broth. I skipped making the tortilla chips; everytime I try to make them at home I never like the taste. I served with Tostitos on the side instead. Thank you :)

Excellent! I didn't use the slow cooker because i didn't have time, but i'm sure it would be great.  I cooked everything with bone in chicken instead of already cooked chicken.  Shredded the chicken after about 3 hours then added it back in. I didn't add any chili powder because of a few sensitive guests but i will add next time. It was definitely better the next day.  it was really very tasty and will make again in the crock pot this time!  Thank you.

This recipe received 5 stars because not only was it delicious but I didn't need to change the recipe as written-gotta love that!  I did, however, use 1 can of black beans rinsed and drained because I only have 1/2 lb of chicken.  This is in my favorites!

This was SO good. I do not like really spicy foods, so I bought the mild versions of the enchilada sauce and peppers, and it was perfect! Great leftover, too. And it didn't have a funky smell like a couple of other similar recipes I've tried... it smelled delicious and the taste didn't let me down. For toppings, I used store bought tortilla chips, crushed them up on top, and put cheddar cheese and sour cream in it. Delicious!!

Awesome full flavor! I did add black beans and hot sauce to the mix! This is definitely going to be a regular! Was very cheap and easy to make!

This was really good. I made it without the enchilada sauce since I didn't have any, and it still turned out really well. Enjoyed it for days!

I thought this was VERY easy and pretty good.  Not FANTASTIC, but will make again.  I did not have sour cream on hand, that may have given it the extra touch it needed.

I really loved this soup.  It was really easy, especially since I followed some of the other reviews and put a couple of frozen chicken breasts in with the other ingredients.  How much easier can it get?  The only change I made was to put an entire quart of chicken broth and omitted the water.  I think it would probably be fine the way the recipe was written too... We topped with sour cream, avocado, mexican shredded cheese and store bought tortilla chips....really yummy and makes great leftovers!

Very good for a weeknight meal.  I had been making a chicken taco soup, but this one is better.  Besides the crispy corn tortillas, I also added chopped flour tortillas in the last 30 minutes.  They thicken the soup and make a dumpling type texture, which is a nice addition.  Definitely a keeper.

This soup is great!  I followed teh advice of several reviewers and added a can of black beans.  For a little more flavor, I used Mexican Style chili powder and Mexican style canned tomatoes.    I will definitely be making this again.

This is always a huge hit when I take a crock pot of it to work!!!  Sometimes I cube the chicken instead of shred it and I don't put in all of the water.  Using frozen Iowa sweet corn makes it extra special!

My family loves this soup! We added some diced tri-color peppers for taste, color and vitamins, as well as a little  more shredded chicken than what the original recipe called for. We also used a full bag of frozen sweet corn kernels, a can of diced tomatoes instead of mashed, and a little more of all the spices. We cheated and used bagged tortilla chips instead of making our own-- who has time?! This soup tastes even better the next day. Yum!

Very simple and delicious. However, I recommend not adding the salt until the end and adjusting to taste - I didn't add any salt as the salt in the tomatoes and other ingredients was enough. I also take issue with using store bought chips unless you use unsalted chips. The chips were not difficult to make and were an excellent addition to the soup.

This is the best tortilla soup recipe I have tried and I've tried MANY looking for that perfect blend of ingredients. I think the Enchilada sauce really makes it work.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding some thickener toward the last hour of cooking.  I found it too thin in consistency.  I mixed some regular flour and corn meal together and added water.  Cooked this in the microwave just long enough to get the mixture to a wet but pasty consistency.  It mellowed the taste of the soup and thickened it nicely.  I followed the advice of others and cooked the chicken breasts in the soup and shredded it. The flavors really melded into the chicken breasts very well and the chicken was easy to shred.  This I will definitely make again!!

I would give it 5 stars, but I think it would of been to bland if I had followed the recipe exactly. I put a bunch more spices, and even added some Taco Seasoning, red pepper flakes and Tapatio to it. I didin't make it to spicy, but it just gave it a little kick. I also put about a tablespoon of lime juice and 1 can of black beans. We topped it with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips and it was DIVINE! This will definitely be in our dinner rotation, everyone loved it!

This soup is  FABULOUS.  Being from Canada,  I had never even heard of this soup.  After I tried it on one of my US travels I was hooked and set out to find a recipe that lived up to the good hotel version.     I have tried others on this site but this one is the best by far.  The enchilada sauce makes it, as well as the canned green chilies. (Do not substitute- I tried a packet of taco mix once instead of enchilada sauce, and it was terrible- right into the bin.)I use chicken stock in a box, and don't forget tortilla chips and shredded nacho cheese to finish - it gives it the needed "body". A sour cream dollop on top, then sprinkle with some fresh cilantro (I love that stuff).   Best use of a slow cooker I have found....yummm.

This is probably the best recipe I've tried in several years of recipes from this site. I really can't say enough wonderful things about it....it tastes amazing, and even more amazing the next day. It's easy to put together, most of it comes out of cans. The recipe calls for slow cooker, but I've also made it stove-top when in a hurry, and it's honestly just as good. The only thing I do differently is I use prepared tortilla chips and crumble them on top of soup, along with a sprinkling of cheese. My kids, my hubby and my friends all love this soup (me, too!).

This was really good. It was even better the next day. We added a can of rinsed black beans and cooked fresh chicken breasts in the soup. I took out the chicken near the end and it practically fell apart while I was trying to shred it. I put it back in for a little while longer added cheese, low-fat sour cream fresh lime and fresh avacado on top. Would have added cilantro but didn't have any. We'll make this again!

Made this stovetop instead.  Browned partially frozen breasts, and left the water that came out of them in there... used that water as the water it called for.  Followed recipe but added drained black beans.  FANTASTIC!!

This is awesome chicken tortilla soup!  Both my kids (picky) and husband loved it.  Even my son who doesn't like soup and doesn't like spicy (which it's really not) asked for seconds.  I just plopped the frozen chicken in the bottom and also added a drained can of black beans.  Absolutely a keeper recipe!

I will add one more comment but it really doesn't need it. I love this recipe... my whole family has seconds, even my 2 year old. I have altered it slightly by using a costco precooked chicken, carrots, celery, black beans and two cans of chicken broth (no water). I look in the pantry to see what kind of tomatoes I have on hand and use 1/2 tsp of cummin (because of the little ones) and skip the chilli pepper. It has a mild enough spice and I put hot sauce on the table for anyone needing more kick. I have served it to guests and it has always been a winner. THANK YOU!

Great recipe!  I made this on a rainy, cold day and it was perfect.  I used the reviewers' recommendations and put frozen chicken breasts in (and cut them into cubes later), I used 2 cups of my own homemade chicken stock, and only half of the corn.  When we went to eat it we used prepackaged tortilla chips, sour cream, cilantro, and Cheddar cheese.  My husband loved it--thanks!

I have made this soup with ground beef, too! Easy and Delicious! The crock pot just makes it easy to assemble ahead and leave it to heat. I don't toast the tortillas, we like to cut them into strips and add them to the soup like noodles.  Great quick recipe! Thanks!

great recipe! I made on the stovetop and boiled for 2-3 hrs, the homemade tortilla strips made a difference I added a little salt to the strips. I would add some kind of bean next time (red, black etc) perfect amount of broth still soupy but filling....Excellente!

This is by far the best tortilla soup I have ever had next to Four Season's tortilla soup!  I will be making this regularly!  My husband and I both devoured it.  Best thing I have ever made.

Delish!  Very easy, too.  Like other reviewers, I threw in some chicken breast uncooked, then shredded it a few hours later and returned it to the soup.  Was soo easy and the chicken had a very nice flavor.  Great recipe, thanks!

Great recipe!  First of all you do NOT need a slow cooker for this.  It is kind of a heat and serve deal.  I used the 32 oz can of chicken broth and 2 cans of rotel.  You dont need extra salsa and because i didnt use water there was no need to cook in the slow cooker or boil for long periods of time to "reduce" the broth.  Didnt have fresh cilantro cuz the store was out, so I used dried instead.  Also added black beans in addition to the corn.  End result was very tasty, filling and quite spicy (due to the hot rotel).  I like spicy though.  I topped with sour cream and cheese which helped to simmer down the heat.  Skipped the onion since I was feeling lazy and didnt feel like the soup truly needed it.  Enjoy!

This soup is AMAZING! I am very picky about my tortilla soup and LOVED this one!  I ended up cooking it for an entire 24 hours on low because I forgot to turn the crock pot off before I went to bed... oops!  I also added in a can of black beans and jalapeno because I like them.... This is easy and delicious!

We loved this recipe. Based on some of the other review I omitted the water and just added 2 cans of chicken broth and also added a can of rinsed black beans. I also put the chicken breast in frozen and then took them out and shredded. A perfect meal for a cold day!

This was great! I did add two chicken breats and this was much easier! You could even use three. I also added a can of drained black beans, this also tasted great! Before serving we also crushed some tortilla chips and put them in. We really liked this!

This is so good!  I let the chicken cook in the crockpot instead of precooking it.  All the people that say the store bought chips are just as good are wrong!  Make your own at least once and then decide for yourself.

I really enjoyed this recipe as did my husband and friend. I kept the heat mild for my husband, but I am a Texas girl and like it hot. I ended up topping mine with some pico to add a kick. Very good, very easy.

I think the recipe is great and very flavorful.  It was easy with pre-cooked chicken that we had left over, might be a good way to use leftover turkey.  I added some chipolte chili and it was way too hot, I think that was it so will definately leave them out or cut back next time. vaa

This recipe was awesome! It was my first time using my crock pot, and I'm glad I chose this as my "debut" meal! I cooked the chicken in the soup, as other reviewers suggested, and it was so amazingly TENDER and flavorful!  My husband LOVED it!!! He added shrimp and turkey sausage to the leftovers the next day for lunch, and it was even more delicious.  This will definitely be a favorite for years in our family. Thanks for sharing! :)

This was excellent. I used one fresh green chili pepper and a jar of fajita sauce (all that was available). I took the advice of other reviewers and just threw in the uncooked chicken. Four hours later it was ready to eat and my guests were quite happy with it! The lime juice, sour cream and regular tortilla chip ideas were great ones, too. Yummy!

Yum! I added a can of rinsed black beans and sprinkled cheddar on top and it was delicious! Not too spicy - my DH added hot sauce to his liking. My 2 year old liked it too. Next time I'll cut my tortillas thinner and probably double the amount.

This is great! Easy to do and yummy to eat!!! And not too bad for points either; it is only 5.5 points per serving for you Weight Watcher Folks. It says 8 servings per crock pot so I think that is about 1 1/2 cups?! We really enjoyed this! Definitely will become a family favorite for quick Sunday meals! Throw in the ingredients before church and it'll be ready for lunch!

This is a great soup!  I made a few adjustments and spiced it up a bit, and it turned out wonderfully.  I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I added hot salsa instead.  I also added extra enchilada sauce (medium), chipotle pepper (about 2 t), a dash of spicy taco sauce, extra cilantro, and lime juice.  

I topped each bowl with avacados, sour cream, chips, and white onion.  Fantastic and sooo easy!

We loved this recipe! I was dying to have Chicken Tortilla Soup (something like Max & Erma's) without a lot of work and this turned out to be perfect! So delicious!  I used about 1.5 lb. of chicken (just my pref). I did not cook it first to save a step and the chicken was fall apart tender. Used the larger sized can (15 ounce?) of enchilada sauce since I had more chicken. Oh, and I used a can of corn instead of frozen. Made the tortilla strips just as directed - they are so easy to make - but I don't ever buy the store bought ones (YUK) so didn't find it inconvenient. Some might, but they should seriously reconsider that.

I was pleasantly surprised how easy this recipe was yet super delicious!  I followed several suggestions from other reviewers.  Definitely use 3 chicken breasts (yes, throw them in frozen with everything else and shred them right before serving...falls apart with no problem).  I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilies included; therefore, eliminating the 4 oz can of green chilies.  Also, I eliminated the water and used a 32 oz box of reduced sodium chicken broth.  I really liked the black beans suggestion as well.  Topped with sour cream, tortilla strips (local grocery might already sell these), and shredded cheese (Mexican blend) makes this soup a yummy dinner!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  I did not have enchilada sauce or tomatoes on hand, so I opened up a jar of ChiChi's chunky salsa!  It smells so good!  Tastes marvelous.  Thanks for the recipe!

I forgot how great this soup is, I made it several times last winter and forgot to give a review. I follow the recipe almost exact. However, I was short on time tonight so I made the following changes: Store bought rotisserie chicken, used chicken broth, and added everything else to big pot and boiled. It was amazing, we topped with Lime Tortilla Chips and pre-shredded Taco Cheese,Perfect!!!

This by far the best soup I've ever had. This recipe is a great base to add you own taste to. I how ever don't use the slow cooker I have made my own stock with a small chicken with the usual carrots, celery, and onions and I've also took a shortcut and used one of those great already roasted chickens and canned broth. Is just as great either way. I like to add carrots, blackbeans and I always top each bowl with avacado chunks with fresh lime juice and ofcourse the tortilla strips. I make mine by cutting corn tortilla into strips and fry them in a sauce pan in an inch or so of canola oil and salt them as I lay them on paper towel to drain. My family loves these. I'm sure baking them saves calories I'll have to try it sometime. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty and easy but slightly liquidy so next time I'll reduce the amount of stock/water.  This recipe definately needs beans but other than that, it's delicious.  Thanks!

This is a really easy and great tasting soup to make. I just put frozen chicken breasts in my slow cooker to simplify it some more. Definetly will make again and again.

This was really good. I didn't do this in the slow cooker, and don't see why you have to...I cooked the chicken ahead and in this way made my own broth, so that saved some money there and tasted better too (also had extra broth for another recipe). I used more of my homemade broth and cut the water to one cup.
I used the vegetable oil spray on the tortilla strips and they came out great.
Only regrets - forgot to buy avocado/lime and that's such a delicious garnish to have one this. Additionally, I added red pepper to spice it up more and made it a little too spicy.

Has a deep, satisfying, savory flavor! I used green onions instead of a regular onion. Make your own tortilla strips in the oven if you have time. They're worth the effort and really dress up the taste.

This was fantastic. Used raw chicken breasts (a little over 1 lb.). Added 1 extra can of broth and an extra teaspoon of both cumin and chili powder. Added a can of black beans for more substance, I think I will add some rice next time to make it heartier. Husband loved it, this will be a winter favorite!

Really good soup and so easy! Some modifications I made:
1. Used only chicken broth, no water. Added a cup extra.
2. Doubled the chili powder. 
3. Omitted the onions, substituted with onion powder
4. Put the chicken breasts in frozen and cut them up later after they were cooked.
5. Used corn tortilla chips (broken up) instead of actually baking tortillas.

Definitely good stuff. I think next time I'll add some more vegetables, maybe zucchini and carrots.

This recipe was great. I followed the advice of others and added whole chicken breasts to the soup, which I shredded towards the end of cooking. Next time, I'll use a spicier enchilada sauce for a little more of a kick.

So easy and fast!  It turned out totally fab!  I will be making this one often!  As others, I just threw in frozen chicken breasts and then shredded them at the end.  I also did not add water just more broth.  Definitely add a can or two of black beans. Make this...it will make you happy!

I make this every fall, as soon as the weather turns chilly. I love to put this in the cooker before I leave, to then come home to the savory smell of this soup cooking. So cozy! I add a can of corn and a can of black beans for texture during the last hour of cook time. (I rinse both in a colander before I add them to the soup.) I always give extras to friends or freeze single servings in tupperware, as this makes a TON of soup.

This recipe is delicious, but the best part is how quick and easy the preparation is (5-10 minutes!). I took the advice of several other reviewers and did not cook the chicken prior to putting it in the slow cooker, and it was beautifully cooked, tender and moist, when I got home from work. I also added a can of black beans to make it a little heartier. Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. Some of the best tortilla soup I've ever had. I served it with avocado slices, sour cream, cheddar, and cilantro sprinkled on top, and chips on the side for scooping it out of the bowl. It was a big hit with my family. This is a perfect recipe for a busy mom (or dad)!

I love this recipe. So Quick, So Easy. Good for a chilly day outside during the work week. I also made my own changes to suit my families taste. 

I included 1 big can of Crushed tomatoes, a can and a half of chicken stock and Jalapenos right from the beginning. I cook the chicken right in the soup (like others suggested) and take it out an hour or so before we're ready to eat to shred it. After shredding I throw the chicken back in and mix it well. This time I also decided to add in some Bell Peppers when I put the chicken back in to add some crunch and tang. I top it with Cheddar cheese, Sour Cream and Crushed up tortilla Chips. 

So Good. My Family Loves it!

This is a fantastic recipe- simple, inexpensive, and healthy!  I do a few minor changes: add 1 can of black beans, use all chicken broth instead of water (2 cans total), and place frozen chicken in with all other ingredients in the morning, then take it out, shred, and put back in for an hour when I get home.  It's a lot easier and less time-consuming!

This recipe is great for the fall/winter.  It is always a huge hit and packs a lot of flavor.  I usually skip putting the corn tortillas in and just serve with chips and homemade quacamole.

We found this soup to be too watery and less flavorful than others we've tried. However, I will use the slow cook method using our favorite recipe, tossing in frozen chicken breasts as another reviewer suggested.

OMG thanks for this recipe.  I've tried 3 others with no success and this one is fabulous! I made it a little soupier by adding more chicken broth, then I think that may have blanded it, so I gave it a shot of cayenne pepper at the end.  Also added black beans.  The crunchy tortilla strips are awesome.  Try this one!

I made this last night and it was very easy.  I used the recipe spices as stated but replaced a couple ing. with suggestions.  I used cubed (not shredded) raw chicken breasts (raw not frozen), canned sweet corn (not frozen), 100% fat free less sodium chicken broth, did not add water, and mexican mild rotel (instead of green peppers and crushed tomatoes).  There was more than enough liquid from the broth and sauce to make a soup that I'm glad I eliminated the water. I also made and topped with the homemade tortilla strips but used whole wheat tortillas and Pam spray olive oil - they took a little longer to cook then stated (added 10 minutes) but I wanted them very crispy.  I cooked all the ing. together for 3 hours on high and it was plenty done.  We added a scoop of steamed brown rice to each bowl for more substinence, as we were eating this as an entree.  Also topped it off with low fat cheese and lite sour cream.  My changes were to make the recipe as healthy as possible  while not losing the flavor.  It turned out amazing and will now be a staple in our house. One bowl filled me up!  The leftovers were great the next day.

This recipe was BOMB, literally!  I added some chopped jalapenos to make it fabulously spicy.  We served this with cheese quesadillas on a rainy sunday afternoon.  Delicious!  I also thought this tasted even better the second and third time I cooked it, I'm guessing all of the flavors had time to meld together.  My husband ate this as leftovers with rice too.

This recipe is wonderful. My husband usually does not like this sort of thing, and he was bringing the leftovers for lunch! I did put grilled chicken breasts in, and shredded them before serving. I also added some brown rice.
Excellent recipe!

I LOVE good meals that are easy to make, and this one tops the list. I've adapted this one to suit my personal taste and it's just tasty, warming, and comforting. I throw in frozen, whole chicken breasts, make sure they're completely covered with the liquid, and when the soup is done I take a minute to shred the chicken with two forks - SO EASY. I leave out the chiles and cilantro (I'm a wimp when it comes to spice) and I substitute tomato sauce or paste for the whole tomatoes, depending on how thick I want it - paste will make it thicker while sauce will keep it soupy. I also add lime juice, a can of chili beans (with the sauce), and a can of drained and rinsed black beans. I use all chicken broth instead of broth and water. Like other users, we've found that just using tortilla chips is an easy way to go - and the lime flavored tortilla chips are extra tasty. I top it with sour cream and shredded Mexican cheese blend. This is my go-to meal when I can't think of what else to make, and is good with beef, too!

UPDATE: Made this the same way as before. Still a good healthy soup. I'd make it again. 5/5/2008 I didn't have a can of enchilada sauce so I improvised, using V8, extra garlic, cumin & chilli powder and some tomato paste. This recipe was great. My boyfriend and I loved it.

I loved this!  Like others, I just put the chicken breasts in raw, frozen in fact, and removed to shred when the soup was nearly done.  Also, added lime juice prior to serving.  That added the perfect touch.  I put the leftovers in the freezer that night and the following week warmed some up on a leftover night and it tasted just as good, if not better!  It's making me hungry right now just thinking about it.

Terrific Soup!!  I use 2 cans of Ro-Tel for the tomato and green chiles, skip the water-just use chicken broth, and use 2 cans of black beans.  I like it a bit more spicy so I replace the can of green chiles with a can of diced jalapenos. Jalapenos add a nice spice to the dish without becoming fiery or overwhelming.

Very good. Some modifications I made were-used turkey instead of chicken (because I had it on hand), fire-roasted diced tomatoes instesd of the whole, added black beans per suggestion,used all chicken broth in place of the water, and sauteed the onion and garlic before adding.  I also just broke some blue corn chips instead of making some and added a little cheddar and a dollop of sour cream-very yummy!

Very Easy and so Good! I had some unexpected visitors come by and to stretch I added a couple cans of pinto beans. Loved the cilantro and lime. We like spicy, but my kids don't so it was mild for them and we just added a couple dashes of hot sauce in our bowls. Served with cornbread and was a great meal...thanks!

Delicious and easy to make! Added 3/4 tsp cayenne.  Left out the cilantro because I forgot it at the grocery store. Used one 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos and didn't add any add'l green chile peppers. Used only 1/2 the enchilada sauce and 2 tbsp. dry minced onion in place of the whole onion. Put a small spoonful of sour cream in the center of each bowl when serving & the family loved it! What a nice change from plain old chicken soup. Will use this recipe again.

This recipe is GREAT!! I'd never made this soup before and tried it and am sooo pleased!! This is the best slow cooker soup recipe ever. I didn't bake the tortillas, I just crunched up some tortilla chips.Add a dollop of sour cream also. To shread the chicken I just let the chicken cook all the way and when it was done just tear it apart with a fork. The cilantro might seem like a little thing but the flavor really makes a difference so don't skimp on it.

Recipe was awesome. I doubled all ingredients in recipe, including using 5 frozen chicken breasts. Great recipe to come home to after a long day at work. Just shred the chicken and enjoy. Next time I will use less enchilada sauce since my husband really does not like tomatoes.

This was easy and delicious. I didn't have a can of chiles so I chopped 1/2 a large pickled jalapeno instead. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was great with or without garnishes.

Very good and very easy. You can add the chicken frozen which makes it even easier(and shred later toward the end). I used a larger sized can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the whole, mashed(too much extra work), I also omitted the water and used extra chicken broth, and I added a can of black beans. This was a terrific recipe with delicious flavor.

This was very good. Instead of the enchilada sauce, I put in a jar of salsa, used more chicken broth instead of the water, and added a tbsp of lemon juice. I served it w/ monterey jack cheese on top and sour cream w/ cheese quesadillas. Yummy and satisfying!!

Fabulous.  The only substitution I made was a jar of medium salsa for the enchilada sauce--I forgot I only had one jar of red in the cupboard, and I used it a few days ago.  I will most definitely be making this again.  ETA:  This is better every time I make it!  Now I always substitute salsa for the enchilada sauce, and I always add a can of black beans to make it even heartier.

Yum! I added a can of black beans and doubled the recipe. I also cooked the chicken breasts with the soup in the crock pot, and it was soooo tender!  I think it's worth it to make your own chips as stated in the recipe. I had never made them before, and homemade tortilla chips are very good! I used Pam no-stick spray and seasoned the tortillas with seasoning salt.  My hubby loved this soup topped with cheese.  What a comfort food!  Serve with chips and dip on the side and margaritas to wash it all down.:)

Very easy, very good! This was the best soup! I followed the recipe with the following exceptions - the tomatoes I used were diced instead of whole and I cooked the chicken in the crockpot and shredded at the end. My husband, daughter and I loved this soup! My picky eater son already had his mind made up that he wouldn't like it because of the tomatoes, onions, and chilis - oh well - it left more for the rest of us! My husband wants this again - in fact he said he could eat it three times a week!

We changed the recipe around and it tastes great. Instead of enchilada sauce we used a mild chunky salsa. We also added about a cup and a half of mixed cheese. Adding the chicken whole and shredding it about an hour before the soup is done works great. The recipe is delicious and we make it all the time now!

I kept the ingredients the same but only changed one thing. Instead of shredded chicken I did frozen chicken breasts and shredded them about 30 minutes before serving. Also the tortillas burned so I would just store bought chips or fry them instead. But I love this recipe and will make it again.

This is a very good recipe but i only gave it 4 stars mainly because I add a few things to make it more to our liking.  I only added a cup of chicken broth and added an extra can of chile's.  I took advice and add can of rinsed black beans.  I also tasted it and decided to add some cooked rice which was really really good.  Before I served it I add a squeeze of lime juice which makes it awesome and topped it with sour cream and cheese.  Made the chips also and it turned out awesome will make again!

Great recipe. I recommend adding a can of black beans for taste and color.

FABULOUS! Took this as a side dish to a tamale-making party. LOVED by everyone and was the first dish to disappear. Instead of mashing tomatoes, I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. Used hot enchilada sauce, 2 cans chopped green chile peppers, chicken broth instead of water, and added a can of black beans. Served with sour cream and cheese. FABULOUS!

I didn't care for this at all. I made it just like it called for except that I used all chicken stock in place of the water.  My husband and our friends that we had over really like this soup though so mabey it just isn't my thing.  Sorry but I won't be making this one again.

I grew up in Texas and Santa Fe, and this recipe had the heat and flavor I look for in tortilla soup. I used all broth instead of the water, a little less corn, added black beans, used spicy Hatch enchilada sauce (you could make your own pretty easily, though), a can of spicy diced tomatoes and doubled the chili powder and cumin. Topped with some sour cream, diced avacado and cilantro, it was very satisfying. The chicken shreds easily w/ 2 forks at the end of cooking time. Use boneless thighs for extra flavor.

I love this recipe! I have made it multiple times and like other reviewers I use two cans of broth instead of the water.  I also added a can of black beans (and left out the corn b/c I don't particulary like corn).  I add a little more cilantro and use hot enchilada sauce.

This turned out very well and was simple to put together. I left out cilantro (hubby doesn't like it) and served with tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese instead of the corn tortillas. Make sure to use mild salsa if your family doesn't like spicy soups!  This one is a keeper!

Absolutely one of the best Chicken Tortilla soup recipes I have tried, and so easy. I add some variances to the mix: I grill one pound Chicken breast and add to it one pound Ground Chicken. It taste like many soups I have had in restaurants. I also substitute one 12 ounce can of beer for half the water and then double the recipe. A winner everytime.

Awesome recipe!  I have made it twice on the stove instead of in the crockpot.  I use rotisserie chicken and a lot more chili powder and cumin than the recipe calls for.  Definitely sub the chicken broth for the water and add black beans.  I also used diced tomatoes with jalapeños to make it a little spicier.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

What a fabulous recipe. Just the right amount of spices to give it some kick. I made the recipe exactly as is, and everything turned out just perfect! Great with some crumbled tortilla chips on top.

FABULOUS!  I threw frozen chicken breasts and cooked with everything else.  I used diced tomatoes, one can plain, one can with chilies.  I did not use onion or garlic or cumin and in place of chili powder I tried chicken chili seasoning.  Definitely better than tortilla soups I've tasted in restaurants!  This one is definitely a keeper, I shared it at work and everyone raved about it and now wants the recipe!  Thanks for sharing this fabulous dish!!

This was really good! I used frozen bonless skinless breasts. I threw them in w/ everyhting else in the morning before work and by the time I got home the house smelled great and dinner was ddone.  I left the tortillas whole and cooked them on a griddle on top of the stove.  When they were done I crumbled into the bowl of soup.  I added some sour cream, cheese & avacado to my bowl and it was FABULOUS!  I will be making this again.

1. Use a few (I used 4 small) frozen chicken breasts. Before serving, pull out the chicken breast and pull the meat apart to shred. Put the chicken back in and it's ready to eat. 2. use chicken broth instead of water (more flavor) 3. add lime juice 4. add a can of black beans 5. I didn't go through the trouble of making the tortilla strips. 6. I didn't have chopped green chile peppers and it was still good. This recipe is super good and you don't really have to follow it to the T to have an awesome soup. Thanks!!

OMG, this soup is awesome!  I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker like others suggested, worked great.  I reduced the chili powder to ½ tsp, added 2 chipotle peppers in adobe sauce (only because I had some left over from another recipe), reduced the corn to ½ a package and added 1 can of black beans. My kids told me that this is their new “most favorite food”.

To be completely honest, the soup tasted and looked like veggie soup with chicken in it when I got home after cooking for 8 hours. I was so dissapointed. So I went to the store, bought some light cream, black beans and tortilla chips and add them to the soup to cook for another hour or so. I only added about 1/2 cup of the cream and maybe 1/4 bag of crushed chips- which gave the soup that "tortilla style" consistancy that we're all looking for. Ended up being delicious..I would highly recommend trying it that way. Garnished with fresh avocado and low fat Cheddar...was a huge hit. I will def make it again that way.

This was great!!!  I followed the recipe but used all broth instead of water, and omited the onion since we're not huge onion fans, but I'm sure it would be fine with some onion. The kids gave it an acceptable, but they're hard to please in the kitchen so I call that good.  Perfect for chilly fall weather!

By far the best recipe I've tried on this Website! I took other reviewers' advice and added black olives and black beans. I thought my kids would like it, but it was too spicy for them, even though I used mild chiles and enchilada sauce, so next time I'll cut the chili powder in half. Definitely use the recommended garnishes--shredded cheese, sour cream, lime, homemade tortilla strips, and I added lots of cilantro on top.

This is sooooo good.  I was a little worried because we usually dont eat "Mexican" style soups, but this was so delicious. It tastes like something you weould get in a restaurant. I used a large can of tomatoes and all chicken broth instead of water. I will be making this again for sure, probably when we have guests!

Absolutely delicious! Made this for a church fellowship and had lots of people asking for the recipe. Only problem was the tortillas got soggy real quickly. Next time I might just serve it with tortilla chips.

very yummy!  great with some sour cream and cheese on top!  I put frozen chicken breasts in with the rest of the ingredients and after a few hours took it out to chunk it and put it back in.  I also added 1 can of black beans which really made it yummy and thicker that it would have.  Also added some black olives.  MUST TRY!!

Everyone loves this and it always turns out wonderful.  My son in college makes it for his friends.  It will always be one of our all-time favorite soups.  We buy a roasted chicken every time and add extra cilantro.  I plan on making it for my co-workers this fall.  I know they will just love it.

This recipe was so great and so easy to make.  I took the advice of others and cooked the chicken with the rest of the soup, pull out once cooked and shredded.  I also used a medium enchilada sauce, which was perfect and offered enough "heat" to the soup.  This will be something I make over and over again!

This was the best soup ever.  Even on a hot day!  I did add a few things however, I used hominy instead of regular corn, added black beans, used fire roasted tomatoes, added a can of rotele, used all broth and no water, and added chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  It was pretty spicy but that is how I like it.  My roommate said it was the best tortilla soup she had ever had

Absolutely delicious! Read many reviews and made some adjustments: 1) omitted water and substituted with more chicken broth, 2) added black beans (drained/rinsed), and 3) threw frozen chicken breasts in pot and shredded later. Came out great! It came out a bit spicy – just a little zing – and this is coming from a person who LOVES spicy food. Husband just loves it. Tastes even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good once you get get all the garnishes (lime juice, cheese, and tortilla pieces) in it!  Plus it's really easy to make... I put frozen whole chicken breasts in and shredded them later as suggested and it turned out great!

Pretty good stuff. I especially like the fact that it is so easy! It definitely needs more cilantro, in my book. And don't forget to squeeze fresh lime juice into each serving just before eating! To each soup bowl I added cubed avocado, cheese, and a dollop of light sour cream. Next time I'll add carrots and zucchini for more veggie goodness.

This is my new FAVORITE FOOD!! It was so good. I'm not one to try new things like this. But my husband and I agree, it was awesome. It was definately spicy, but the corn was the perfect sweet to balance. We used tortilla chips (I'm a busy mom), the soup wouldn't have been nearly as good without them.

Fantastic recipe and so healthy!  For chicken, I bought one of those 'slow roasted' chickens that they make at the grocery store.  All I had to do was pull the chicken off the bone and toss it in the crockk pot with the rest ofthe ingredients.  I will make this again and again!

This soup is incredible. I did not add any water, all broth. I also added frozen chicken breast, and shredded it after 4 hours on high. I did not use green chili's, and by accident i read red pepper, instead of chili powder, but only added 1/2-3/4 of a tsp. You must make the homemade strips. They are the essence of the soup, and absorb the flavor when dipped, without getting soggy.( It is not called chicken tostito's corn chip soup!) I did make about extra tortillas in the oven, and added cheese to about half. My husband and I both thought it was perfect! Just added shredded cheese for a little thickening. My husband and I loved it !!!!!

very good....I left out the corn...used one box (I think it's like 4 cups) of chicken broth and NO water.  I used one of those precooked chickens you get in the grocery store deli section....just picked the meat off the bones.  I have a special way I like to make toritlla strips.....get a stack of about 7-8 small corn tortillas....starting on one edge, slice them into very thin (no bigger than 1/4 inch wide) strips....then fry them in hot oil in batches till just brown (watch them closely b/c they can go from light brown to BURNT TO A CRISP very quickly)...drain on paper towels.  They are extra crunchy and good to just nibble on too.

GREAT! I gave it 5 stars, because even though I made a couple of changes, it was one of the best soups I've ever made.  Like others, I added a can of black beans, chicken broth instead of water, and I used uncooked chicken and let it cook in the soup, then shredded it when done.  Is a keeper!

My earlier review of this recipe was that it was so easy, I made in my living room because my kitchen was being renovated.  I wish to add a couple of other suggestions.  1) I added frozen boneless skinless chicken tenders rather than cooked chicken. 2) I added a jar of salsa con queso and about a 1/4 cup of half and half to give it added richness and thickness. 3) THIS SOUP FREEZES EXTREMELY WELL!!!  I just reheated it on low in my crockpot all over again.  It tastes even better the second time around.  The whole time I'm at work eating this I'm saying "darn, I should have brought more in."  So I'm going to have it for dinner.  Once again, thanks for the absolute best soup EVER!!!

Love this soup - very filling and super easy to dump all the ingredients into the crock pot and walk away.  I even left out the cilantro and just seasoned to taste and it was great.

The next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will saute the onions, even after 8 hours in the slow cooker they had a little too much crunch. Following others advise I put the chicken in at the beginning and shredded it shortly before serving. I also used more broth instead of water. This tasted great and was sooooooo easy for a work day!

This was good but I like the "slow cooker taco soup" from this site better. I agree that another can of chicken broth would be better than water. It seemed like it was missing somthing so I added a can of black beans to it.

AWESOME! I've made this quite a few times, and will continue to do so. I usually throw in a handful of rice or two for texture. I'll be passing this one on to future generations. Seriously.

Excellent and easy recipe. Don't be turned off by the list of ingredients. I actually just put it all in a pot and let cook for a while. Used a rotiessere chicken from the grocery and boiled the remainder for stock. 
Next time, I won't use the whole tomatoes, just diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers. I also would half the amount of water. I added about 1-2 TBsp tomato paste-don't know if it made a real difference. Served with cheddar bay biscuits with monteray instead of cheddar cheese and taco seasoning mixed with butter on top.

We thought this recipe was lacking in flavor. It did have a lot of heat to it from the chili powder. We added extra cilantro, 2 teaspoons of dried oregano, a can of black beans, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. After the additions, it was more to our liking. Seems like a recipe you can accommodate to your own tastes. Next time I would substitute chicken broth in place of the water; the soup tasted too watered down to us.

This is the best soup ever!!! I also add one can of Rotel tomatoes. I saw this recipe in the Houston Chronicle years ago and have used it ever since. If you use mild red enchilada sauce, it's not quite as spicy for those that can't handle the heat. But I always use the medium because we like it SPICY!!!!

Delicious!  I used canned corn, added 1 can of pinto beans, and a fresh red jalapeno.  I dropped two raw chicken breasts in at the beginning and then shredded them at the end.  The flavor was great & and the chicken was really  moist and juicy.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent and very easy.  I will be sharing this recipe with my friends. I put the chicken breasts in frozen & shredded after it cooked.  I also added more cilantro and less chili powder.  This was something easy that could cook all day while I was gone.

This turned out pretty well but I don't think I cared for it as much as tons of other reviewers.  I recommend cutting down on the amount of onion.  Half an onion would be plenty.  I pureed my tomotoes so it would be more appealing to the kids.  I added black beans but I think pinto would be a nice addition as well.  I replaced the water with chicken broth for more flavor.  I took the advice of others and cooked the whole boneless chicken breasts in the liquids till the end.  I then cut it up into small pieces.  It didn't seem meaty enough so next time I will cut the meat into larger chunks.  It just seemed too brothy at the end so I added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up a bit.  That definitely helped but something still seemed to be lacking.  My husband and one of my sons enjoyed it but my other 2 didn't care for it.

A very comforting soup.  I followed the recipe with the only change being that I bought already shredded chicken.  I don't think it made any difference.  I added sour cream and shredded cheese when serving.  The tortilla strips are great.  This I will make again!

EXCELLENT!!!!! I omitted the water and added an extra can of chicken broth, as the other viewers did. Next time I will consider  more of the enchilada sauce with some more spice other than that this  is so good..thank you for sharing.

Good chicken tortilla soup!  Can't say much more than that!  I did reduce the spices by half because I can't handle spicy very well.

My husband was very leary about trying this soup because he doesnt care for chicken breasts. I used boneless breasts and shredded them after they cooked.Instead of whole tomatoes I used some leftover sauce that I had had hot sausage in. He doesnt eat corn so I added black beans and a little rice the last hour. Finished it off with crushed tortilla chips and grated pepper jack cheese. He loved it :) definately a keeper.

My husband thought this was great but it wasn't what I expected.  Don't know exactly why.  Would make again on a cold day - really will warm you up.

Excellent recipe.  Doubled it for a large crowd and added drained/rinsed black beans.  Served with fresh avacados, sour cream and tortilla chips.  Everyone raved - will definately make again

I took the suggestions from other members: cook chicken in slow cooker and shred later, used can tomatoes seasoned with chiles, added extra garlic, used tortilla chips, and served with cheese and sour cream. A bit too spicy for some family members but DH and I love it.

Perfect!  I threw in 4 frozen chicken breast halves with all the ingredients and removed to shred and replaced to continue cooking.  The breast were so tender they just fell apart and gave th soup a great texture.  I used an extra can of broth instead of the water, used canned corn instead of frozen and just put it in when I replaced the shredded chicken.  I used a medium enchilada sauce so I left out the cumin and chili powder.  Husband doesn't like spicy food so I just added a little zip to mine own bowl.  I used Tostitos tortillas chips instead of makin my own strips and it was yummy.  Also added some sour cream, fresh cilantro and some sharp cheddar cheese.  Froze the left over and it made another meal.  This is a monthly at our house now!!!!

Hubby raved about it and he was right; this IS good. I did use the tortilla chips and next time I'll make it a little hotter. I also topped it with thin slices of avocado. Yum!

I was so excited to try this soup.  I decided to make it the day we had an ice storm.  Smelled delicious.  It was just "ok" and I must say a little spicy for my taste.  I couldn't eat more than one bowl and never re-heated the leftovers.  Sorry.

I tried this recipe today and it was wonderful!  I was looking for a recipe after having some of this soup at a local restaurant.  This is as good as, if not better than what I had at the restaurant and I made it easily at home.  This recipe also got raves from my husband.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

I made this recipe with one cup of water and substituting a small jar of tomato sauce for the 2nd cup of water.  My husband LOVED this recipe.  He loves to order chicken tortilla soup when we go out to eat at restaurants, but he says this is better.  He has me make this every other week now.

This was the best soup EVER.  This soup was to be made for a church function.  My boys got sick so we stayed home.  We enjoyed the whole crock pot of it.  
I followed the recipe pretty much as it showed. I boiled the chicken first and then shredded the chicken and used 5 pieces of chicken to make more.  I also used more frozen corn and a slightly larger can of enchilada sauce.  The chili pepper was a hotter chili pepper.  The recipe was delicious.  As the previous post said, I think I will use more chicken stock instead of water.  But, it was fine the way it was so if I don't have extra chicken stock I wll make it the exact same way next time.  I used corn tortillas and it was great.  I cooked the corn tortillas at 350 for like 9  minutes.  
This is definetely a recipe to try out on a cold night.  Enjoy it like we did

We had a houseful of people watching a football game and they all loved this soup! The printed recipe went home with a friend that night. I added in a can of garbanzo beans for extra fiber and tripled the spices because we love flavor. We made it simple and omitted the tortillas for a bag of tortilla strips and also sprinkled on monterey jack cheese. Can't wait to make this again!

Great soup and very easy. I added black beans and lots of cilantro and hot peppers. Once you have the base of this recipe, you can add what you want and not screw it up.

Most excellent! I added a can of black beans and some cooked rice that I had left over. I don't think you could mess it up.
I served it with sour cream and tortilla chips and cheese that I had toasted in the oven.

I loved this! I made it with a little less chili powder and about 3/4 of the chile, as I don't like things too spicy! It was the perfect flavor.  However, if you want to have some left overs, this really only gave us about 5 bowls of soup, so I will definitely double the recipe next time!

I would definitely make this soup again!  I made a few alterations to the recipe, as other reviewers suggested.  First, I added a can of black beans (rinsed).  Then, instead of using water, I used a 12 oz. can of enchilada sauce and about 3/4 of a can of chicken broth.  The soup wasn't too "soupy" and tasted great.  Buying a can of diced tomatoes with the peppers already in them was a nice time saver.  This was so easy and ended up tasting so good!

This was so good and so easy! I omitted the cilantro and bay leaf, and used a second can of broth instead of the water. I also added a can of rinsed black beans. I started out with raw chicken and shredded it at the end, like many others did, and it turned out really really well.
We garnished with lime juice, avocado, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and store-bought tortilla chips. This recipe is a DEFINITE keeper! Plus it makes the house smell wonderful while it is cooking.

I didn't have enchilada sauce, so I used a larger can of diced tomato instead. Also, I made this an all slow cooker recipe by throwing raw chicken breast in at the beginning. If you take it out about fifteen minutes before you plan on eating and let it cool, you can pull the chicken apart and add it back to the pot. I was very good! We ate it with homemade tortilla chips.

I followed reviewers' suggestions: chicken broth instead of water, added black beans, cilantro on top instead of cooked in, and tortilla chips instead of all the fuss. And I put 6 corn tortillas, cut into strips, into the soup early on ... Fabulous!

My whole family loved this soup.  I did take the advice of some of the reviewers and substituted the water with the chicken broth as well as used lesser amounts in the seasonings.  Yum!  Definitely a keeper.

This is awesome. I ditched the bay leaf and half of the cumin and it still had a good flavor... and it's super easy to make! I used frozen chicken and it shredded right up with a fork after a few hours. If you make the tortilla strips, be sure not to use cooking spray... I did that on my second batch and it tasted putrid, but the veggie oil works great. Also you only need to put the tortilla strips in there for like 8 minutes, 15 would probably be a little too crispy! I think it adds something to the presentation and is better than plain old corn chips. I'll definitely make this many times again - yum!

Made the soup yesterday, and the house smelled wonderful!! I modified the recipe by adding black beans, 4 cans of chicken broth, Rotel instead of the tomatoes and green chilies. Then once the soup was done I added precooked Spanish rice and garnished with avocadoes.  I also toasted corn tortillas in the microwave, so I didn’t have to fry anything. It really tasted great! Was absolutely perfect for the cold weather! A for sure keeper in my recipe box! Thanks for sharing!

This was really good and easy.  I tried a few other tortilla soup recipes before I found this one, I will be sticking with this one.

I love enchiladas, but don't like making them.  This tasted like enchiladas in a bowl.  For some reason it was too runny, so I added some flour/water to thicken it up.  Definitely will be making again!

I made this soup again and it came out beter than the first. I made it for a pot luck and it was gone i mean every bite. I mad a double batch at that too. This time i used a rotessouri chicken and just shreded the chicken i used all the same ingrediantes but since i doubled it i doubled the water and all the spices i used a 24 ounce can of mild enchilada sauce, an extra can of chicken broth with garlic seasoning, a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, and one serrano chili. It was the best tortilla soup i've ever had at any resturante. Tortilla soup lovers loved it.

This soup is great!  I made it in the morning and had some at lunchtime (I cooked on high for 4 hours) and then let it continue cooking on low all day - it was great at lunchtime but was much better letting it cook for the full day.  I did modify the recipe slightly - I added a can of tomato puree so the soup wasn't as thin.  I also sprinkled the top of the bowl with shredded cheddar cheese when I served it.  Yummy!

I followed the advice given by others and poached raw chicken breasts in chicken broth (rather than water), a 12 oz can of tomatoes, 1/2 can of hot enchilada sauce and 2 cans of the green chilies. I was concerned that it was going to be too "soupy" but shredding the chicken absorbed lots of the liquid. The black beans was also a great suggestion by the other reviewers.  I added shredded cheese to each bowl before serving and made my own tortilla strips. It ended being a really good hearty meal that everyone enjoyed.

It was super! Looking over the reviews, I added both the black beans and the dollop of sour cream.. and I used my already cooked n shredded leftover turkey in lpace of the chicken- What a great way to eat leftover turkey! My dubious husband was into it quickly and for a guy that doesn't think soup is filling, he was patting his stomach quickly quickly after stuffing himself! I WILL make this again!

Delicious! I even omitted the Chili power since my 9 year old is very picky. The enchilada sauce had plenty of flavor! The tortilla strips and shredded cheddar were a hit!

This soup was a huge hit with my family. The only changes I made was to use 1 tsp of dried cilantro instead of fresh, and I used 3 cups water with 3 bullion cubes instead of the chicken broth.

I thought this soup was great. I'm not much for tomato based soups, but this one had great seasoning.  I left out the water, bay leaf and added a can of black beans.  I also used hot chili powder for extra kick.  We garnished it w/sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese.  Yum!  I'll be adding it to my recipe box.

Disappointed in the very enchilada sauce taste to this soup.  Was very easy though.  I think I might try again but use more chicken stock and less enchilada sauce?  Thanks though.

Excellent!  Came out as good as I could have expected for a first try.  Like several other reviewers, I too added black beans, diced tomatoes w/green chilies together, and cooked the chicken along with everything else.  I also used two cans of chicken broth without adding any additional water.

This soup is in regular rotation at our house....it's easy, healthy and everyone loves it. The only real change I make is to add the juice of 2 key limes (limones), and the final result is very similar to the sopa de tortilla that I ate frequently while living in Mexico. 

While the soup is easily a meal all by itself, I often accompany it with store bought taquitos, and combined, it's an easy after work meal that lasts our family of 4 for 2 nights.

Wonderful!!  I added a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese to the top of mine.  It was excellent.  The only thing I would change is to use regular tortilla chips rather than going through the hassel of baking the tortillas.

This was a really good recipe.  I've had better Chicken Tortilla soups in the past, but for something to make at home, and especially with the ease of using the slow-cooker, this is a keeper.  Like others, I used all chicken stock, no water.  I also used homemade enchilada sauce, but only added about a quarter cup, as mine is very spicy.  I also added a handful of small noodles for interest.

This was great. I used some of the other tips such as adding 1 can of black beans. I did not have cumin, and it was still great. I also used chicken breast cut in small chunks. I received lots of compliments...this is going to be a cool weekend staple.

I thought this was great.  Unfortunately my husband thought it was way too spicy for him, even when I cut back on the spices. He only tried one spoonful, oh well, his loss!! My 2 1/2 yr old daugther put her seal of approval on it though!  I will probably make it again, but for my parents and siblings who like spicy foods!  Great recipe!

This is fabulous! The only subsitutions I made were 2 cans Rotel w/ green chiles, replacing the canned tomatoes and green chilies. I eliminated the water and cooked the chicken breast along with the soup in the crockpot. Yum

This was delicious! I used stewed tomatoes, thats what I had on hand. I also used 3 cups of chicken broth, and 1 cup of water to give it a great soup taste without being too thick or to watery. I also followed others suggestions by using frozen chicken breast to save myself a step. The meat was soooo juicy and tender. This is a great recipe!

Yum.  Cooked the chicken in the soup and shredded it and put it back in about an hour before serving.  Cooked on low 8 hours.  Used all chicken broth.  Also used a big can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole and added a can of drained black beans.  Topped with chips, avocado, cheese, and sour cream.  Very good and will definitely make it again.

This was a yummy soup.  My husband raved about it and he never likes any type of soup.  I did add some things to it so that it why I am only giving it 4 stars.  I added a can of black beans, a can of diced tomatoes, and another can of chicken broth instead of water.  It seemed a little too thin so I added some cornstarch but I cooked it on the stove which might have been the reason for that.  Overall very good and I will be making this again this winter.  Thanks for the recipe.

A good, easy to make soup that comes together well. I did what others suggested by adding raw chicken breasts at the beginning and shredding them after they'd cooked. As suggested, I also added black beans and 1 cup rice. In the future I wouldn't add rice. It absorbed tons of  liquid made it too mushy.

This is pretty good (especially with a dollop of sour cream as previously suggested) but I want some more substance to it.  I may add some macaroni or something to it while it's cooking next time to make it a more complete lunch.  I took some suggestions - all chicken broth, sour cream.  I think this soup doesn't feel filling enough because it is so watery.  If it could be thicker that would be great.  like a chowder.

Delicious!!!

This was a great tortilla soup and pretty quick prep time.

I did replace the water with chicken broth, placed frozen chicken breasts directly in the slow cooker with the other ingredients and then pulled it out and shredded it and put it back in and used tortilla chips instead of making my own.

I also started later in the day and so cooked on high for about 4 hours instead of on low for 8.

A couple of friends and I ate almost all of it that night.  Really good soup, especially if it's cold and rainy outside.

Absolutely authentic and delicious.  I braised the chicken breast and shredded it before throwing it into the pot.  I followed directions exactly.  It was just perfect. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE.

Really good, my boyfriend asks for it once a week! I add a can of black beans and a cup of uncooked rice. Also, I use whole, uncooked chicken breasts, then pull them out and shred them right before we eat.

A little too spicey for our taste so I'll reduce the spices next time.  I added a about a cup of black beans (cooked) which added more fiber, looked attractive  and worked well with this recipe.

WOW!!  This was really nice!  Cooked it on HI for 1 hour, then LO another 7.  No cilantro for me, extra garlic and Tapatio sauce.  Mom and I loved it.  Then spiced up (!!!!) with 1/2 can of chipotle chilis in adobo sauce and reheated for my heat-seeking boyfriend.  He raved.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been in search of a great chicken tortilla soup for years.  I have finally found The Recipe!  This is great in a slow cooker or on top of the stove.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good, very easy.  A hearty, good for you soup.  I had to bring a meal to a woman at church in need of assistance.  It was easy for me, healthy for her and she could freeze it if she didn't want to eat it right away.  If you don't like corn (it's high in sugar), I suppose you could substitute another veggie. I added a can of kidney beans which complimented it well.  I also didn't want to deal w/ cooking fresh tortillas so I bought "Fresh Gourmet" tortilla strips available in the produce section.

I made this for our bible study group and everyone just raved about it!!!  I actually (like another review) did not have time to crock pot it, so I did it on the stove for 3 hrs.  Added fritos, sour cream and cheese as we served it up. It was so easy esp. if you can cook some chicken and cut it into small chunks the night before!  A definate fav of our family!

This soup tasted great and was easy to make.  I think it was even better left over the next day. I used can chicken as suggested in another review and you couldn't tell the difference.  I will definitely make again.

I made this for some friends, who really liked it. I had gotten a late start and had to prepare it on the stovetop, so I'm sure it would have been even better in the crock pot. Several people asked for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My wife was not as fond of it as was I, but doesn't like dishes with too much spicyness. This one doesn't but it came too close for her... Still really enjoyed it and it makes great leftovers.

I followed the recipe, except to cook the chicken in the soup then shred before serving as other reviewers suggested.  I found that the soup did not have enough tomato flavor for my personal taste, so I ended up adding a couple of small cans of tomato sauce before serving.  That addition brought it up to 4 or 5 stars for me, but without it, the soup was not my favorite.

I was really not to impressed with this soup.  It was quick, easy and very bland.  It was missing something, maybe more chicken??  I probably won't try this one again.

I made a Chick. Tort. Soup another time and it went poorly, I was apprehensive about this but time was short & the day was HECTIC and hubby WANTED soup!  SO, I started this recipe at noon & it was done (at high) at 4, I just shredded the chicken breasts (I used three) up right before serving, topping with restaurant style corn chips, crushed, and mexican-style cheese.  My husband smelled it, said (as always), "this better be good!" and then wolfed down two heaping bowls full!  He told me that night that this was EXCELLENT soup, like he would expect from a restaurant!!  Super meal, low-fat and SO good!  Thank you!  (Makes loads of soup, too!  Get ready to freeze some & use some for left-overs for lunch, tomorrow!)  My 2 yr.old loved it, 4 yr. old didn't, 7 yr.old ate all & no complaints, and 11 year old LOVED it!  I did, too.  I'm keeping this one!

This was a super easy soup to make.  I love how you can just put everything into the crock pot and go.  I made a few adjustments: added creamed corn instead of frozen, added black beans, and topped it with cheese, sour cream, and green onions.  I also boiled the chicken in cayenne, cumin, and coriander.  I used the water the chicken was boiled in, in place of the two cups of water.  Make sure to really toast the tortillas or else they are too chewy.  I will definitely be making this again, thanks.

I adore this recipe!  My husband says it is "restaurant quality."  Unless you are going to serve all the soup at once, you can cut down on the tortillas you cook up.  I figure one tortilla per bowl of soup.  Then I just make more as we eat the leftovers.  I make a couple minor changes on the posted recipe when I make it.  They are: I only use 1/4 a can of chiles, I use 1 can of corn instead of frozen corn, and I use petitie diced tomatos in stead of mashing whole tomatoes.

I made this for dinner last night, and it was a big hit!  I used Quorn instead of chicken to make it vegetarian.  The chilipeppers I got were quite hot, so I halved the amount and it still gave enough zip to clear the sinuses, but not so much that you couldn't taste the great flavours.

Love it!  Will definitely make it again.

I followed a reviwers advice to use all chicken broth and no water. IF you do this don't add as much salt (if any!) Otherwise, follow the directions as Elena suggests and it will turn out a 5 star. So very yummy!

Oh my GOODNESS this was sooo good!! Definitely cook the chicken IN the soup. We used tortilla chips- good choice. Sliced avocados on top was the perfect finish. If you have ever had authentic tortilla soup in the southwest, try this soup and you won't be disappointed! My whole family loved it!

This soup was very good.  I loved all the flavors in it.  My family came over and ate it, and my dog even loved it!  I had to save some for myself!  I will definitely be making this again.

This soup is really awesome-a perfect recipe.  I couldn't even wait for it to finish in the slow cooker, so I took some out and nuked it for lunch!  My hubby will get to try it tonight after it simmers all day, and I am sure it will be even better then.  I used crushed taco shells instead of making the tortilla strips, and they work very well.

This was very good! And so easy! I also put the raw chicken in at the beginning. Next time I may add a tiny bit more cumin and chili powder. We used tortilla chips instead of fried corn tortillas. It makes a lot...3 adults and two kids had it for dinner, and we had leftovers the next day.

This was so good and so easy.  I added quite a bit more cumin and chili powder than the recipe called for because we like our food spicy.  Topped with crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. YUM!

I LOVED THIS SOUP
I HAVE HAD 3rds tonight
Some changes I made
-I didnt have time for the slow cooker so I simmered it for about 45 minutes
(i put everything in a pot to simmer while the chix poached & then I had to shred)
-I poached the chicken in broth before I shredded it
-I added 1 1/2 cups of celery
         1 cup carrots
         2 cups zuchinni 
that made it more stew like them soup like but it was a great way to get some extra veggies in and to use them up before they went bad. 
-crunched up store bought tortilla chips for the top instead of corn tortillas
-omitted the corn because I forgot to buy it
A local restaurant makes the exact soup on their menue with all the veggies I am sure of it.
next time a bit more broth to make it a bit more soupy and some avocado on top as well
MAKE THIS SOUP TODAY!

My daughter and I always go to this local restaurant because we love their Tortilla soup but now after tasting this we have found a recipe that is just as good(I think even better)as the restaurants'. Thanks this definitely a keeper.

Warning: The recipe says to cook the tortilla stips for 10-15 minutes. I checked on them at 10 minutes, and they were already way over cooked...but still tasty.

Other than that, this recipe is fantastic. Easy to make, some kick but not too much, and a great flavor.

This soup is awesome!  I did not cook the chicken breasts before adding them to the pot and they cooked thoroughly and shredded easily. I used diced tomatoes w/ green chilies in place of the whole tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. I cut back on the onions and used a little less than half of the chili powder and omitted the green chilies entirely (because of the kids)  To compensate, I  used 4 cloves of minced garlic and a bit more cumin.  It still had a little kick but everyone enjoyed it.  This one's a keeper!

Very good recipe! I used tortilla chips like other reviewers... made a very simple and delicious dinner. I used the amount of spices called for in recipe and it came out too hot for my husband's taste though. Next time I will lessen the spices. Note: topping with cheese and sour cream really make this dish!

This is a great meal--and one that is SUPER easy!  My future mother and sister-in-law came into town and got home before I did.  The house smelled so good and they couldn't wait to test the soup.  It was a huge hit!  Can't wait to make it again!

Really really good! This is the first recipe I ever made in my slow cooker; it was very easy and now I'm hooked.  Like others, I cooked the full chicken breats right in the soup and shredded them before serving.  Also used taco sauce instead of enchillada sauce - still awesome! Thanks!

I love Chicken Tortilla Soup--and this was one of the best I've tried!  My husband who had never had Chicken Tortilla Soup loved it as well--add that together with how simple this is--I gave it five stars!  I didn't bother toasting my own tortillas--I just topped my soup with crushed tortilla chips and Monterey Jack cheese--yummy!

I love this!  To make it even easier I use canned chicken.  I use 2 big cans (12.5 oz) I think and just drain water.  We eat this for days and enjoy every bite.

My sister recommended this recipe...It was great! Even my picky 2 1/2 year old ate it. I put a litte bit of water in his so that it wasnt too spicy. But for Me it was perfect. I didn't feel like heating the oven up so I just used tortilla chips for a nice crunch. This recipe is definitly a keeper. I will be making it again soon.

This is fantastic and easy tortilla soup! A friend of mine owns a Mexican restaurant and this is as good if not better than his (once you add some sour cream.)The only change I made was adding more chicken. I really like this recipe. yum!

This soup is so good.  It only took about 15 minutes to prepare, and most of that was just opening cans. I used tortilla chips, broken up rather than baking the tortillas. Grated cheese and a dollup of sour cream.  YUM!

This recipe was fabulous.  I added an undrained can of black beans instead of the water and cooked the chicke right in the pot like others suggested.  This was quick and easy and provided a really hearty meal.  I combined it with the Spicy Black Bean Cakes.

Excellent! My family devoured this. We ate so much that we were literally stuffed and could barely move. I cooked some white rice and some pinto beans in separate pans on the stove. We kept everything seperate so everyone could add what they liked to their bowls. We kept it mild so the kids could eat it but my husband and I added chopped jalapenos to ours. We also added a spoonful of sour cream to our bowls which made the soup creamy. My family asked me to make this every week. We will be keeping this receipe and passing it on to other family members. Thanks for a great receipe.

Easy to make.  Everybody who has tasted it loves it.  I added potatoes the second time I made it, at my husband’s request.  This has become a 'go to' recipe in my house.

Very good and easy soup to make! I made this tonight substituting salsa for the enchilada sauce. Also, I did not have fresh cilantro to garnish. It was a very good soup but think it could have been better had I followed the recipe as written.  I will definitely try this again.

Awesome leftovers too! I cut the spicy spices in half and it didn't taste spicy at all, but still great flavor. At first I thought there were too many onions, but it turned out great. 
I gave it 4 stars because next time I will add more veggies--celery, carrots etc. plus more tomatos and broth--I also used to raw chicken breasts and a can of corn (with the juice). Thanks, will definitely make again!

This recipe is awesome!  I added the chicken breasts uncooked as previous reviewer suggested and because I love cilantro, doubled the quantity.  Store bought chips are also the way to go.

So easy, and so delicious!  I will definitely make this again!!

The soup came out very good. I added some canned beans and cooked rice towards the end to add a little more substance to the soup. After doing that, I found that it didn't even need the tortillas.

Great tasting and fairly easy to make. I followed the instructions exactly so I could judge it by the chef. Others loved it, so I will be making it again in the future. Only 2 points if you're on WW or watching your diet.

I would give this a 5 because it is one of the best soups ever. I have made this a 3x  already and always so good and so easy, just throw everything in the slow cooker. The only different thing I did was used canned corn.It is an absolute must to add the lime, some grated cheddar cheese and avocado.It definitely enhances the flavor of the soup.

Wow! This was such a hit.  Only changes ( if you can call  them that!) was to use  diced tomatoes instead of whole..why bother mashing whole ones , dried onion and cilantro and I substituted paprika for the chili powder because we aren't too fond of 'spicy' .  Garnished with Farmstyle Thick Cut Tillamook Mexican 4 Cheese, sliced avocados, a few sliced ripe olives and  a splash of lime.  Didn't have leftovers because the neighbors finished it off before I could fill containers for the freezer !

Loved this soup. So easy to make. Will be on our regular dinner menu.  Prep shredded chicken in slow cooker before making recipe. Place raw chicken, taco seasoning and quart of  chicken stock in slow cooker and set on 4 hour high setting. Once cooked, shred chicken in slow cooker and add tortilla soup ingredients and cook for additional 8-10 hours on low. One pot dinner. Delicious!

Great tasting soup!  I just put the raw chicken on the bottom and shredded when the soup was done.  I used 4 cups of homemade chicken broth and no water.  I added a rinsed can of black beans.  I used mild chili peppers and ended up adding 1/4 tsp more of chili powder to spice it up more. Next time I'll use hot chili peppers.  Topped with some cheese, sour cream, and bagged tortilla chips.

Loved this recipe - tastes similar to Saltgrass Steak House's Chicken Tortilla Soup.  Only a few adjustments:
* Used raw skinless boneless chicken breasts - cooked on high to a temp of 170 degrees before shredding the chicken and lowering the heat.
* Used Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and mild green chiles instead of the whole peeled tomatoes.
* Used a 32 oz carton of reduced sodium chicken broth in addition to the 2 c water.
* Added 1 c converted long grain white rice (cook on high) 30-60 minutes before serving.

Excellent!!! I did as others and added a can of black beans, a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and substituted rotel for the tomatoes. Also made some white rice and put some in my bowl, then added to soup, some cheese, sour cream, and premade tortilla strips. Next time I will make sure to get an avocado but other then that forgetting that it was delicious! Definitely will make again!!

Extremely easy and tastes just like the tortilla soups I've eaten at restaurants! The only alteration I made was replacing the water with low-sodium chicken broth. I also already had plenty of tortilla chips so I ended up skipping the last steps making my own. 

Note: I used pre-cooked and shredded chicken from the supermarket deli but I think I'm gonna use raw chicken the next time I make it.

This was so easy to make! I added beans to it and jalapeño for a little kick. I also used pre shredded chicken. It is a good recipe for busy families. Just dump everything in the crock pot and you are set!

I love this recipe.  I have been making this for several years, and it is always a hit.  I don't usually pre-cook the chicken.  I usually just cut it up and toss it in with the remainder of the ingredients.  You can add more cilantro if you are a fan of that ingredient like I am.  It freezes well, and makes for great leftovers.  I also like to top mine with sour cream and cheddar cheese.

I made this with things I had in a pinch and was pleasantly surprised! Used 3 large (Costco) cans of chicken (each net 7 oz. chicken) drained, and left out the salt.  Family approved and will be adding it to the soup rotation!

I made this soup as directed + 1 can of black beans (drained & rinsed), and it completely filled my 5-quart slow cooker. Since it's just hubby and me, we'll have leftovers + some to freeze! It's yummy with just the right amount of 'kick' from the spices. Will definitely make this again!!

Love, love, love this soup!  I always doctor it up a little based off of what I have on hand.  Like last night, I forgot to buy the canned tomatoes, so I poured in a small can of tomato sauce.  It made it a little thicker and it was still so yummy!

I love ordering chicken tortilla soup at restaurants.   Sometimes, however, it is too salty or too spicy for my wife and too acidic for me.   I made this at home and only used 1 teaspoon of mild green chili pepper, no black pepper, and I added more cilantro.     This tasted great and I woke up this morning with no acid reflux.   This will be in regular rotation at our house.

I love making and eating soups. This  one is so easy and so good that it will become a regular in my house. And the tortilla strips. What a gift. Spouse asks that I make them all the time, just for snacking. Did I mention it was so easy?

Very tasty, but a bit watery.  I prefer my tortilla soup to be a bit thicker.  I added some rice and that helped.  I also think adding some shredded cheese would thicken the broth as well.  Ill try that next time.

Delicious and so easy.  I could not envision any taste left in the chicken if already cooked and then cooked for another 8 hours, so I used frozen, whole chicken breasts.  My crockpot cooked them perfectly in 7 hours on low.  I garnished with sour cream, fresh cilantro, lime wedges, and ready-made tortilla strips.  This recipe will be on the family “repeat” list.

Made this as written and it is fantastic. It's super forgiving too, if you like more tomatoes, add them.  We like black beans, so we throw those in there too. I also like to throw in some Basmati rice also. You just have to top this soup with some shredded cheese and sour cream, it just makes it creamy and takes it over the top. It's just so good. The kids all like it and so does the husband and he is picky about all his Mexican food. It's a winner and in my permanent rotation.

Made this recipe at 6am this morning:  Nevermind using cooked chicken.  It’s going in the crockpot anyway.  Put your boneless chicken breasts in the crockpot uncooked, pull the chicken 30 minutes before the time is up and put it back in and stir.  Also if you’re not a fan of spicy, omit the cumin and replace it with maple smokehouse seasoning.  The soup was super delicious.  And by the way, you can buy tortilla strips if you don’t have time to make your own.

Very bland, flavourless. Followed directions exactly, minus making tortilla chips. Had to add crumbled store bought tortilla chips to make it edible. Maybe lacking salt? Will not make again.

So easy and adaptable to whatever you have in the fridge.
I omit the water and use all broth for more flavor..  Throw  in a frozen bag of “southwestern” veggies - corn, black beans, peppers, onion, green chile. Add chopped carrots, potato and zucchini..  My kids love it.

Very good recipe. I was happy with end results. My husband, who never really compliments anyone's cooking, said it was really good. That is saying something!

It Only took 15 mins to throw everything in crock pot. I left my chicken breast whole and just cooked it in crock with everything else. I shredded at the end. I topped mine with Lime juice, sour cream, and monterey jack cheese. I cooked mine on low 6 hrs and it was perfectly done. The Chicken was easy to shred.

The Corn Tortilla Strips burned the first time I made them according to directions. I suggest testing one in your oven to see how it does before ruining a whole batch. Mine browned and got crispy in about half the time...7 mins.

I made this recipe and it turned out great, but I made a couple of great enhancements.  I had fresh boneless/skinless chicken breasts so I boiled them in water with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder to kill two birds with one stone. Cooked shredded chicken with homemade chicken broth. Used the broth from the fresh chicken in the recipe instead of store bought. I also added green onions, green and red peppers to give it more flavor. Btw - I did this over the stove. Just bring everything to a boil and let simmer for 20 minutes. Everything is already cooked...no need to wait 3-4 hours for this goodness!  Garnished with shredded colby and cheddar cheese, sour cream and lime juice. Devine!!!

I made this for a work pot luck. It was a hit. Everybody loved this soup. I made a few changes...only because I can't seem to keep to a recipe. Easy to make.

The only thing that I did differently was added a can of black beans.  It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

The only thing I changed about this recipe - I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, instead of the mashed peeled tomatoes. My family loved it!

Skipped the corn and threw in a can of pinto beans to thicken things up- will do black beans next time since the pintos seemed to lose their structure by the time dinner was served. Then garnished with a dollop of sour cream and a splash of lime. Yummy!

This recipe is so good and easy to make. I added a little extra chili powder and omitted the bay leaf because i didn't have it on hand but this is definitely a keeper.

Loved it. Add Black Beans, cut chili powder in half.  Cook chicken in the pot with the rest of the soup then after 3-4 hours tear apart with forks.  Used mild enchilada sauce and canned peppers and it had just the right amount of spice for us.  For the torillas, I used flour and lightly brushed with veg oil and cooled for 10mins at 350. The family requested I make it again soon!!

We don't like corn at our house so we put black beans in instead. I also used twice as much cilantro as called for but I have made this recipe multiple times over the past 5 years!  It is a very versatile yummy soup!

I have made this recipe numerous times since I discovered it here. I absolutely love it. The only alteration I make is to use whole chicken breasts or even frozen chicken. It all cooks up, shreds easily and tastes amazing! I can't attest to the authenticity, but I can certainly say it's so easy and delicious you'd be nuts not to try it.

This was such a hit with my family. We loved it. It was so simple to make, that part I loved.  The things I changed were adding the shredded chicken at the end, just to warm through. It seems to me when you add already cooked chicken to the slow cooker at the beginning, it gets so overdone and dried out. This way the chicken is still moist. I also added a 14.5 oz  can of Rotel tomatoes. We topped the soup with chopped avocado, tortilla chips, cilantro, sliced radishes and cheddar cheese. I'll definitely make this again. YUMMMM!
Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

This is sooo good! My crockpot died a few weeks ago so I made this on top of the stove. I baked the chicken ahead of time in the oven. My husband loves to shred chicken using a hand mixer! (Works perfectly)!!
Flavors are fabulous and it’s definitely a new family favorite. I used green enchilada sauce because I like it better than the red. 
Like other reviews, we just used store bought tortilla chips for the garnish/topping.

Ok, so I didn't plan too well.   I did this on a Sunday when I had some time.  I had a pound and a half of boneless, skinless chick thighs that I browned (not cooked through) and added them to the cooking liquids instead of the pre-shedded chicken.  I also used a half can each of mild and spicy enchilada sauce because that is what I had leftover in the freezer.

Set the Crock-Pot on low for 3hrs, took the thighs out, fork shredded them and put it back in the pot for another hour on low.   I also cut up some corn tortillas and fried them to top off the soup.  A dollop sour cream, sprinkling of cheese, some diced avocados and a squirt of lime.....oh man!!!   My picky husband LOVED it!  Said it's the best winter time you he's ever had.

Definitely going into the "make again" file!

Excellent flavor - everyone enjoyed! The only change I made was to cut the green chile's portion in half for the young kiddos. Still spicy but they could take it. Topped with sour cream and cheese.

This was great! I doubled the recipe.  I  put the chicken in raw and shredded after 6 hours.  Used all Chicken Broth. I used TJ’s fire roasted corn and added 1 can of rinsed black beans.  I didnt add cilantro but did use it to top with along with sour cream, sharp cheddar and tortilla chips.  So delicious!

My family loved this recipe.  I made a few changes based on the reviews that I read.  I had some fresh tomatoes that I needed to use so I chopped those up and added them along with frozen chicken thighs, some black beans, two chicken Maggi boullion rectangles, 4 cups of water, and the rest of the ingredient list (sans the frozen corn because I didn't have any). I cooked it on high in the crockpot for 2 hours then removed the chicken to cool a bit so I could shred it.  I then used my emulsifier and blended the soup right in the crockpot.  I was worried that it was looking too thin but when I put the shredded chicken back in it was excellent!  I added white beans and the liquid from their jar and one cut up red pepper. 
It cooked another hour.  It was amazing!  It was served with shredded cheddar cheese, green onion, fresh lime juice (a must!), and cilantro.  We added a bit more salt and pepper per person based on preference.  I will definitely make this again!

Added canned black beans as one suggested and also a couple of tablespoons of Trader Joe’s pepito salsa (mild). I also bought a roasted chicken and deboned it. Awesome recipe!

Soooo great. I've made this twice now, and I only recommend adding a little extra chili powder and cumin to get the kick it needs, otherwise, 10/10!!

I thought this was pretty good for a slow cooker meal. I did hold back 1 cup of water and add much more cilantro however. 
It was ready in just a few hours and had the house smelling amazing. Its one of those things you snack on all afternoon.

This is a really good, easy recipe. I make it often. I use just a little extra chili powder and omit the bay leaf. It seems out of character for a recipe like this. THANK YOU!!

Very easy recipe to follow and was done in no time. It is in the Crock Pot as I give this review. 8 hours from now I’m sure I’ll be chowing down on something fantastic.

Loved the amazing flavors in this soup!  I was a huge hit at a party I brought it to.  I listened to some of the other reviewers and put semi-defrosted chicken breasts in and cooked on high for 3-4 hours.  After 3.5 hours when I went to shred the chicken, it wasn’t quite done so i pulled the breasts out and poached them for about 15 minutes in some of the soup in a separate pan until they were cooked through. I followed the recipe otherwise.

This soup was absolutely and delicious. My husband enjoyed the crunch of the frozen corn. I did not use the shredded cheese or avocado or the corn tortillas, but I will with the leftover soup. Also I just put chicken breasts in the soup uncooked and it turned out great for shredding. It was in the crock pot for about 7 hours on low, and turned out wonderful.

Delicious! Tortilla chips should work too in a pinch but I really like how the toasted corn tortillas don't get soggy as quickly and don't add extra  salt.

When I saw that enchilada sauce was needed, I have to admit it made me a little skeptical. But clearly I don’t know anything because this was literally the best chicken tortilla soup I’ve had.  I didn’t bother cooking the chicken beforehand.  I threw some chicken breasts in the pot with everything else and then shredded them before I served.  Definitely offer some avocado, Mexican crema, and cilantro as garnish.

Delicious soup! Tastes great the next day. I added a can of black beans at the beginning and stirred in about a half a pint of heavy cream once the soup was done cooking. I also cooked my chicken right in the slow cooker, allowing me to easily shred it at the end.

Used turkey instead of chicken. Added mushrooms and barley. Had a bit of kick, but it tasted good. Wanted to add white beans, but didn’t have any. Didn’t make tortilla strips, just served with pre-made chips.

Delicious! Just the perfect amount of spiciness. I add a can of rinsed black beans as well. Top with avocado slices, cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  It's also good poured over steamed rice.  YUM!

I made this for the first time and have eaten it every night for 3 days because it's so delicious! I added black beans and a little taco seasoning. I topped it with sour cream, fresh cilantro and avocado. I skipped making the tortilla strips and ate it with lime store bought tortilla chips. I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe was easy and very tasty!  I made it exactly as written. It didn’t specify red or green enchilada sauce, so I used green. I’m sure it would be just as delish with red. My husband ate two bowls at dinner!!

I've made several different versions of chicken tortilla soup and this was the best one by a long shot. I think it has to do with using the enchilada sauce. I used the red sauce, not green. Definitely tasted like something from a restaurant...maybe better!
A few modifications:
I used 3 large chicken breasts and just shredded at the end. I didn't have frozen corn so I added a can of drained corn at the end as well. I didn't use cilantro and bought tortilla chips and just broke them into pieces for topping. Also used shredded cheese, sour cream and avocado as topping options.
Delicious! Everyone raved about it.

This is a staple in our house during the colder months. We use all chicken broth or stock instead of water which makes it rich and throw in a can of rinsed black beans and half a pkg of frozen okra. I’ve used larger cans of whole tomatoes too with fine results. We usually omit the chicken as that is my wife’s preference but I love it both ways.

Loved this recipe but I must admit, I was in a hurry and didn’t have time for the slow cooker so I made it on the stove in a big pot. I used all the ingredients as stated and added a can of corn and black olives, plus some chili pepper. It was a hit with the family and I’ll definitely be making it again. Often.

I made it for my family of 7 and they loved it. Instead of slow cooking it I made it on the stove top and it only took 45-60 minutes. And I made the tortilla strips too. I used cooked chicken shreds from target. It was a good soup for my first time!

Easy to do in Instant Pot!  Awesome recipe! I’ve made it before in my slow cooker and I loved it. Now I have an Instant Pot pressure cooker, so I put everything in at the same time (chicken breasts whole, uncooked). When the pot came to pressure, set time for 10 minutes, natural release. I then remove the breasts and shred them with my hand mixer in less than a minute, return to IP, and dinner is ready in about 30 minutes.

OMG a soup I can put together in the slow cooker, with the chicken raw at first? I definitely had to try this! I subbed petite diced tomatoes for the can of whole peeled, included a can of drained/rinsed black beans and eliminated the can of chile peppers and water.

Everyone in our family loved it. I added black beans and a extra chicken broth. we ate the whole crockpot in one night and it was great to see the kids enjoy it. This is going to be a staple dish for us. my wife and I were able to spice our own bowls up with some habanero sauce while the kids dishes were not too spicy for them.

Love this!  There's a restaurant near where work that I  always get this soup from, but I had to wait until Wednesdays (and that's only if they made it or didn't run out).  This recipe/soup equals in comparison and is a tad better since I can make it spicier if I want and also add avo, cheese and tortilla strips at my leisure and liking.  I followed recipe 99% except I added more spice.  Perfect as is.   Have 4 co-workers that agree and have since asked for recipe.  =)

I thought it was great! Was a big hit at a meeting.  Very easy.  I cut chicken up still half frozen and let it cook all day and voila! Super tender and one pot- no mess.  I opted for ease and did the tri-color tortilla strips in the bag for people to top off their soup.  Also had shredded cheddar cheese.

Very bland, needed twice the amount of spices + others so make it tasty. Once I doctored it up it was good though.

Followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Has the right amount of heat for our taste. Made a full crockpot full so will have soup for a few days. YUMMY.

I made it as directed. There was not enough chicken in my opinion.  My husband felt it needed more kick/spicy flavor.  I felt the level of spicyness was perfect since the kids had to eat it too. Great flavorful recipe.  I added more chicken after the fact and it was still great! Thanks a bunch for posting.

Have made this many times and family loves it.  Cooked chicken in slow cooker, shredded and added remaining ingredients to finish it off.  Added a can of black beans.  Served with tortilla strips and optional toppings.  Delicious!

This was delicious and spicy! The only thing I added was black beans. If you are not much of spicy person, I would suggest only using half a can of green chilis, instead of a whole can. I made this soup on a day my roommate and I were sick, and this soup was amazing and cleared up our sinuses.

The flavor of this soup is awesome!  I used fresh -from-the- garden, vine-ripened tomatoes, because I have a ton of them this year.  I also substituted a can of  white beans instead of the corn. My husband raved about it, and the kids loved it.  I  topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and served it with  tortilla chips and my son (who is 9) used the soup as a dip for his tortilla chips.

Very tasty and was a hit.  I think it might be even better if it let the chicken cook in the soup rather than requiring precooked chicken. But I had some shredded chicken in the freezer left over from instantpot and was able to use it.

Added some rinsed navy beans- fresh green chilis - extra cumin- half cup of salsa and used rotel (crushed) instead of canned tomatoes - a few squirts of lime-"just chicken" from Sprouts--Made some rice for it as well--I used the big crockpot not the small -lol! Very good!

It  was great, so easy. I think the only change I'd make would be a little less enchilada sauce. I didn't  have any cilantro and I missed that freshness. In the middle of a heat wave, this gave my family a hot meal with little effort on my part.

Made exactly as directed. My son who does not like anything hot liked it and I, who likes lots of flavors including spicy also liked it. If it were just for me, I would add more cumin and chili powder. Definitely needed more salt. Served with chopped avocado over top. Some black beans in the pot would not be amiss.

I used 946mL of no salt added chicken  broth instead of  just water ad the broth, diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes, green pepper, and an extra clove of garlice because I like the flavour it adds. I also added a bit more chicke than the recipe calls for, approximately 700g. I added some more corn and didn't add any extra salt, but more pepper. It turned out amazingly flavourful and hearty, there was a really good broth to solids ratio. As well, I made quesadillas with the corn tortillas, just with cheese and some green onion and dipped them in as a side instead of having them on top, and it was to die for. I would definitely make this again.

This is my absolute favorite soup in the world, and I LOVE soup! Usually I just use tortilla chips instead of baking my own because I always seem to burn the ones in the oven! I put sour cream, Cholula and crumbled tortilla chips on it and avocado and lime when I have them. Best thing in the world!

Super easy and tasty. I use a rotisserie chicken and add a can of black beans. Instead of minced garlic I had garlic powder, so used a teaspoon of that instead.

This is now my favorite soup!  I have made it 4 times in 2 months if that.  But I make it in a dutch oven on the stove with adding the corn shortly before serving.  I add 2 Tbs of chili powder because I love it.  1/2 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp.  I use a rotisserie chicken and just use a bag of tortilla chips.  Also I tried adding chopped avocado to my bowl and poured the hot soup on it with the fresh cilantro on top to serve.  SERIOUSLY  This stuff is good!

I love this recipe, I make it all the time.  I don't make the tortillas, I just throw some bagged chips in.  I used mild green enchilada sauce and it was just spicy enough for me.  I also omitted the salt, it does NOT need salt.

This is a go-to family favorite in our house.  I use raw chicken and let it cook in all stock (omitting water).  I also add extra of all the veggies and add black beans.  Just makes it a bit heartier.  So flavorful and makes a ton!

This soup is fantastic.  I used a shredded rotisserie chicken and it was great.  I used a 28 oz. can of the tomatoes instead of 15 oz. and it was just as delicious.  I also sprinkled the tortilla strips with a little chili powder for a little extra kick.  I've had nothing but rave reviews on this soup and I'll make it again and again.

I made this for the first time yesterday. Didn't add corn because I'm not a big fan. I placed raw boneless chicken thighs in the broth and cooked it all day. Before serving the soup I shredded the chicken. I also took the advice of other people and used chicken broth in place of water.  I also placed a teaspoon of dried oregano in the soup. Will make this again.

First time I made this I omitted the extra water and salt (and I omit these every time). The second time I didn't have green chilies. I now add dried black beans to it. It's SO delicious even with little tweaks. A+

It was awesome! My family really liked it. I did everything the same except the onion was a red onion. Its what I had. I aslo used black beans because they were sitting in the closet and I kept forgetting about them. I decided to use them after reading the reviews and saw that someone else used them. Either way this soup was a hit.

I made some adjustments based on reading. Use Rotel 14 oz instead of tomatoes.  I held out on the green chilis for after cooking to add as a side. I also used frozen chicken breasts so I lessened the water by 1/2 cup.  I also threw in a can of black beans because my husband likes his soup a little thicker. I liked it, but he thought it was too spicy. it was probably more the size of his helping.

It's delicious. I've made this twice, first time using Ortega. This time, I used a can of Hatch chilies marked mild. I had NO idea these would be blasting hot - I'd not tried them before. I had to toss the whole batch, sadly.  So...if you don't like blasting heat in your soup - beware. I'll definitely make this again, but I learned my lesson to not try something new unless I know what it will be. **Have also made this using a can of Hormel no-beans chili once since I didn't have a can of enchilada sauce on hand. Also good.

I took advice from others of using all chicken broth and not adding water, and adding rinsed black beans. Instead of the tortillas we use blue corn chips with sea salt. In addition, we have cilantro, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and sour cream to make it your own.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I've added is bell pepper and black beans. I make this for my coworker every winter and everyone loves it! I put all of the fixings in bowls so that everyone can customize it to their taste. The only other thing I do differently is I don't cook it in the crockpot, I don't like the way food tastes when made in the crock. KM

Instead of doing this in a crock pot I did it on the stove top. I was looking for a really good tortilla soup since I've never made it before. This recipe is good but the enchilada sauce made it too red. I was looking for a more clearer broth. Plus I added only half of the can of chiles and it was still a little too spicy for me and my son to eat. Great for cleaning the sinuses. :)
This recipe is not bad just not what I was looking for. Still everyone should give it a try.

Easiest sou to make! HUGE hit with everyone who tried it.  I tripled the recipe to fill an extra large crock pot.  The only thing I added was some extra cumin, chili powder and fresh lime juice  to the tortilla chips before baking.  yum!!!!   Definitely making this again!

Turned out pretty good. I did not bother pre-cooking the chicken. I tasted the soup when I took out the chicken to shred after about 6 hrs cooking.Tasted like it was missing something. I added a can of black beans which I think enhanced the soup.

I loved this soup! It was super easy to make! I pretty much followed the direction. But I also added a can of drained black beans, added a 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes & 10 oz can of green chilies instead of smaller size cans. I like chunker soups. I also put in a pound of frozen chicken breast and let them cook with the soup and shredded when we were ready to eat. I think you could even do a 1.5 pds of chicken for a thicker soup. This recipe is very versatile, you can do many changes based on your liking and taste preference.. Great base recipe! This is one of the best recipes I've found in a while. Thanks!

Great easy soup! We can’t find enchilada sauce so instead of the chilies and enchilada sauce we substitute a jar of tomatillo salsa and it turns out great!

This soup is wonderful!  The only thing I did differently is I added a can of rinsed black beans to it to make it a little more hearty.  But it's absolutely good just the way it is written.

Best tortilla soup I have tasted! The changes I made after reading the reviews were using a can of rotel tomatoes instead of plain tomatoes, used all chicken broth instead of broth and water, tossed the chicken in frozen to be shredded later and used Tostitos chips with shredded cheese on top as a garnish.

I tried this as is and was unimpressed by the tortilla chips. I'll settle for store bought. There felt to be some missing flavors. in our second batch I added lime juice and store bought tortilla chips. it is a good base.

This recipe is really good and really easy to make. I usually make base of the soup the night before and keep it in the fridge overnight to let the flavors marry a bit. You can throw in the chicken in the morning, it isn't necessary to shred the chicken beforehand. You can even throw in frozen chicken breasts. I used the Verde enchilada sauce instead of the regular sauce.  My mother doesn't like onions,so I substituted onion powder and minced onion. I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and left the parsley out. I added black beans as well. I cooked it on low for about 6 hours, and had my mom stir it a few times during the day. I took the chicken out of the pot, it was extremely tender and very easy to shred with a fork and a knife. I dumped the chicken back in, stirred it up and served it with sides of cheddar cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream as optional toppings,as well as hot sauce for those that prefer a little heat. The soup is great for chilly days, and only gets better after a day or two in the fridge.

I made it stove top. Sautéed the chicken and onion. Added all the rest and brought to a boil. Served with store bought chips, sour cream, avacado. Had enough to have left overs and freeze some. Makes a lot!

I did this in instant pot for 5 minutes on manual and then pulled the chicken and returned to pot . Used one extra onion and subbed chicken broth for water! Yum

Four stars for the base ingredients. A great recipe to play off of. I am one of the most impatient and hangry people of all time, and was craving a good tortilla soup recipe. I made this meal in about 30-40 mins. I used all the can ingredients, 3 big pressed garlic pieces, the corn, plus one more can of chicken broth and a can of black beans. I combined all the ingredients into a large pot and set them on high. I added rotisserie chicken (shredded), 3/4ths of an onion, and a batch of chopped cilantro. I then added garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, pepper, extra salt (to taste), and a big spoon of sour cream (for thickness). I DID NOT add water. I stirred everything together while my two corn tortillas baked (400 degrees, lightly rubbed with vegetable oil on both sides) and once they were done, turned off the heat. I put the soup in a bowl, added shredded mozzarella cheese, and the tortillas. Incredibly good and will last for a few days!

Made it just like the recipe said and husband said it was awesome. He sprinkled some Fritos on it, that was the only adjustment from the original recipe. Two Thumbs Up!

This was so easy and everyone loved it!  I went with another reviewer and just put the chicken in raw.  Just pull it apart in a few hours.

This was pretty good. My family enjoyed it. I did as directed except I followed what a few others said and used broth instead of water. I also bought tortilla chips instead of making my own. Yum!  My only complaint is I had a LOT of fluid. So much so we ate and we're able to add chicken to the rest and make a 2nd batch the next day. I'll cut back on that next time. I'll definitely make it again.

Fantastic recipe I only wish some of the values were in Cups in stead of pounds for measurements as many of the amounts in ounces are impossible to find when you buy it. I did find a great conversion and it came out fantastically. No need to use water in it. If I had I think it'd be too watery. Nice and spicy too if you use hot enchilada sauce.

Excellent! So easy and fast to put together. A bit spicy for my husband so I cut chili powder in half and doubled the cumin.   Also used diced tomatoes. Next time will add some black beans. Made a pot for a friend. To make it easier to transport I added the water and broth after I got to her kitchen.

Super Delicious. To make it even better, I seasoned the chicken, grilled the breast so they'd have that grilled flavor, then I put them in the slow cooker and followed the rest of the video. This is a 5 star go to recipe which always works. Winter or Summer

Yum.  I omitted the water and used all chicken stock.  Also I reduced the corn by about half and added a can of black beans.  Leftovers freeze great.

Delicious! I made this last night for the family and everyone loved it (hubby and 2 daughters, ages 17 and 14).  Used 2 bone-in chicken breasts, which stayed nice and moist.  Just put them in raw to cook with the soup.  The only thing I did different is I added 1 can of pinto beans.  Topped the soup with fresh lime, cilantro, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips (store bought).  Will definitely make this again.

This is wonderful! I have a couple of tips. #1 if you don't have shredded, cooked chicken, you can brown a couple of large chicken breasts in olive oil, and throw them in. A few hours later, fish them out and shred using 2 forks, and return to the pot. #2 A cup of cooked black beans is a good addition! #3 As others have said you don't need to add enchilada sauce, which is just more tomato and spices. Just up the garlic and maybe add a poblano or other fresh pepper, to taste. This is a flexible recipe, or delicious as written, and has become one of my go-to dinners!

It Seems that every cook has a different idea of what is the perfect tortilla soup. For me this recipe is it, thin, flavorful broth with just the right amount of spice! I made my own chicken broth by simply boiling the breasts with garlic, onion , salt and pepper and used a premium brand canned enchilada sauce. Thanks for sharing this great recipe !

Made this soup once before and forgot how good it was! Made as written but added about 4 big tablespoons of tomato soup to thicken and to add a little sweetness. Used dried cilantro only because that's what I had on hand. Delicious served with grilled cheese! Thanks!

Great recipe! I made an error that turned out great! Instead of the green Chile peppers, I accidently got diced toma toes with green peppers. It worked out lovely. I also used Chile like seasoning for my Chile powder seasoning. I'm wondering if I  can I add black beans to it.

Very good. Will definitely make again. I, like many others just added frozen chicken breasts at the beginning and shredded towards the end once fully cooked. I also added a can of rinsed black beans. Topped with cheese and tortilla chips. The whole family loved it!!

Used chicken stock to make the shredded chicken, so put this in the soup instead of broth+water.  Incredible taste.

My husband loves this soup so I always double the recipe.  I serve it with a lime wedge or two squeezed on top, and crumbles of queso fresca, chopped fresh avocado, and then the tortilla slivers on top.  That is how they serve it in Cabo.  I use more chicken broth and don't add the water.

We do Mexican food every Monday in my house, and this soup is in heavy rotation. We LOVE it and it's very diet-friendly. I use chicken from the Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken recipe on this site. (That recipe makes enough shredded chicken for this and two more Mexican Monday dinners!)

This soup is delicious!!!  Everyone loves it!  I make it plant strong by replacing the chicken with pinto, red, kidney or cannellini beans and the chicken broth with vegetable.  I also like to replace the water with more broth.  I use whatever frozen veggies I happen to have -  we actually love using a broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix in addition to the corn.  I've even used green enchilada sauce in a pinch and it was still delicious.  For those who do not like spicy food use mild enchilada sauce, mild green chilis or eliminate altogether, and skip the chili powder.  It's still very flavorful.  Top with a little lime juice and chopped avocado - WOW!!

Very good, tasty, wholesome soup. I added some cayenne and chia seeds, giving it a bit more flavor. Fairly easy to fix, it is also an excellent recipe to reheat later.  It's good with guacamole or crackers and cheese.

Robb&Sandra made this. They used 2 cans of corn instead of frozen & dumped in all the liquid. Skipped the can of broth and instead added better than bouillon to the 2 cups of water.  Turned out very good - even Isaac liked it a lot.

This is delicious.  My husband loved it even though this is usually not his favorite type of food.  Since I doubled the recipe, I cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven because the crockpot wasn't big enough.  The lime juice garnish and avocado really makes it.  So fresh and light tasting!  I also garnished with some torn cilantro leaves, cropped green onion, and a dollop of sour cream.

I like how easy it is to make this soup!  I used some shredded teriyaki chicken I already had in the freezer and it tasted fine in this. I also added a can of black beans and used a can of corn I had. This is really yummy but a little spicy for some of us.  Next time I make I will probably nix the chili powder and perhaps the chiles. Very good flavors nonetheless!   This just in: my brother said this is "the bomb". So there you go. ;)

I LOOOVVVEEE this recipe. I cook it for potlucks at work, when a friend or family member is not feeling well or when I just want some soup. I have shared this recipe with family, friends and even randos in the grocery store. I can't get enough of it. I use canned chicken chunks and a lot of garlic taste and it is just as good as the original recipe with a lot less hassle of boiling a chicken.

This is the best recipe EVER!!! I never rate recipes but this one is rate worthy! It is
super easy to put together, healthy, and a complete meal I'm planning on keeping everything on hand (besides the rotisserie chicken and cilantro) to be able to make this all the time! 
My family is a difficult crowd to please. Rarely do we all enjoy the same meal but for this one, plan to double the recipe for your family as they'll want it! Even my vegetarian teenager raved about it once I strained the chicken out!

Love this recipe! Easy, tasty, and loved by everyone that tries it. I always double the recipe to freeze container for later.  I wouldn't change a thing with the recipe provided.  My only recommendation is to use split chicken breast with the skin on and not boneless, skinless chicken breast.  I usually boil the chicken beforehand and use this water for the soup.  The small amount of fat from the skin and meat adds more flavor to the soup.  I would highly recommend this recipe for all soup lovers!

This is a VERY good chicken tortilla soup recipe and will be added to my typical rotation.  I did not cook the chicken ahead of time.  Instead, I cut up the chicken into smaller pieces to have the flavor cook through, and shredded the chicken about an hour before serving.  Great with a bit of lime, sour cream, and cheese on top.

Also, the amount of cilantro is no issue for those who think it tastes like soap.  Highly recommend with a corn and black bean salad with chipotle ranch dressing.

SO easy and so delicious! Like other reviewers, I ended up using fresh chicken breasts and shredding after about 3 hours cooking on high. Then I just let it cook for another hour to let the flavors mingle. Came out perfect!

Very good!  I would omit the corn next time though.  (I think that would also make it more authentic?).  It's hard to find chicken tortilla soup that isn't more like stew (yuck... should be more like light broth).  It is spicy and I used probably about 3/4 the amount... if you don't love spicy you should really cut back.

Absolutely delicious!  After reading all the reviews,  I also did not precook the chicken and added black beans.  There were no leftovers, which is a good sign.  You won't regret making this.

Soup was amazing! I added black beans, a little cayenne pepper and a cup of heavy cream at the end of the cooking time. Will make this again!

Works perfect with fresh/frozen chicken too!
I dump in a frozen pkg of (uncooked)chicken breasts from Costco and all the other ingredients before work, put it on low and when I get home, do the shredding and top with chips and cheese. (I don't bother making my own chips)

This was super easy. I did not precook the chicken. I added with all other ingredients. Chicken was cooked perfectly and I shredded near the end. It was not as flavorful as I would have liked. I think I will replace the tomatoes with a jar of salsa next time and maybe add some some chicken bouillon. Overall this is a great recipe and has a lot of room to add other ingredients to your taste.

Really tasty and really easy!  I think it needs some hot sauce to add some heat, but it's good to start mild and heat it up based on personal preference.  I topped with grated cheese, sliced avocado, and a dollop of sour cream.  My only complaint is I would have like it to be a thicker soup.

Was really delicious.  I changed only two things so I think I can legitimately review the recipe.  I used low sodium chicken broth and added a can of black beans.  Was great and even better the next day!! Enjoy!

I had made my own chicken stock by simmering the chicken bones, celery, cilantro stems and onion for about 40 minutes and then added salt. I added more of the spices to the soup, 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce and a can of black beans. Due to lack of time, instead of using the Crock-Pot, I just sauteed the onion and garlic, added the rest of the ingredients and let it all simmer on the stove for about 20-30 minutes.

Love this recipe. It's super easy to make and it's delicious. I have made it several times both using cooked chicken and other times using  raw chicken and shredding it after it's done cooking. I usually add 2 cans of green chile because I love spicy food but either way it's delicious!

This was awesome and so easy!  I added a can of hominy, drained, and didn't make the tortillas....just put crushed corn chips on top.   I used 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken.

My family loved this soup!  I made a couple of changes by adding 2 cups of brown rice and  a can of black beans so it became thicker with less broth!! I also used a can of Rotel in place of the green chilis and diced tomatoes.

This is an awesome recipe...the only tweak I did was to add just a bit of freshly ground cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  Seemed to us it actually tasted better the second day!

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it several times. I have done it in the crockpot but actually prefer to do it on the stovetop. I'm not a big fan of chicken in the crockpot as it tends to dry out. Sometimes I add the juice of a lime and some lime zest at the end.

Lives up to it's 5 star rating even for my picky family. I can never find something everyone likes but they all enjoyed this soup. Didn't change much except used chicken broth versus water.  I have made with both red and green enchilada sauce, hubby liked both but I prefer the red. I also garnished w chopped avocado and the kids liked some sour cream to cut the spice down although it is already mild.

Flavor was good but it turned out a bit watery. Wondering if I needed to drain one of the cans first. I added some yogurt to thicken it up; I'm sure sour cream would have worked well, too.

I made two different batches and added my own chicken broth, frozen whole tomatoes from the garden, white beans and shallots instead of onions because my husband forgot them. I made a spicy and mild version.  It was a huge New Year's hit!! 
I learned from another site to shred the chicken in my Kitchen Aid and it was so quick and efficient.  
I will make this again!

This is my go to Chicken Soup recipe, especially when me or someone in my family is sick with a cold or allergies. It has a way of helping you breathe, as well as tasting so good. I do change a few things though. I like less of the tomato taste, so I add very little crushed tomatoes. If any at all. I do however add 1 can of rotel, and 3 small cans of green chiles.  I also use mostly chicken broth and very little water. Throw in some Black Beans and it's good to go for me! This recipe by itself is wonderful and a uniform recipe for tweaking.

This was easy and great tasting, but I did switch up some things. I doubled the amount of corn, I used two cans of rotel (tomato and green chile blend), one 4oz can of diced green chiles, half an onion, and rice. I cooked the cilantro and green onion in with everything instead of waiting till the end. Also, I put the uncooked chicken in the crockpot in the beginning, but after about 4-6 hours into everything cooking that's when I shredded the chicken. I minimized the amount of water, and used both chicken AND veggie broth. 

The tortilla strips were made by cutting corn tortillas into strips, frying them, and lightly sprinkling them with salt. 
I topped the soup off with sour cream, avocado chunks, sharp cheddar cheese, and a crisp lime. 

TO. DIE. FOR. !!!!

My adjustments:  took advice in other reviews and put two raw chicken breasts in the bottom of the crock pot, and shredded on a plate with two forks then added back to soup.  Instead of whole tomatoes, I used diced.  Increased garlic to 4 cloves, used 1 cup water, 2 cups of chicken broth.  Instead of frozen corn, I used a can of the "mexi" corn (corn with red & green peppers).  I did not add any salt (I figured between the broth and enchilada sauce, it wouldn't need any).  I also used medium spicy enchilada sauce, it gave it just enough kick that me and my family like.

I doubled the recipe, used chicken broth, red and green enchilada sauce,  no corn, but added two cans of white beans.  Plain yogurt as sour cream, mexican cheese and some crumbled tortilla chips and you have a soup that is a meal!!!!

Loved it.  Made a few minor modifications; used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chilies (instead of 1 can of tomatoes and 1 can of chillies), used 1/2 the recommended amount of salt (really glad I did that), used 3.5 cups of stock and 1 cup of water (I wanted more broth for a soup instead of a stew), added a can of drained/rinsed black beans, and threw two chicken breasts in and cooked them with the soup then pulled them out, shredded and added back in.  Healthy, spicy, easy to make.  Definitely doing this one again.

This was very good, but I think if you are using frozen chicken breasts you need to cook it for 7-8 hours otherwise it takes a lot longer for it to heat up.  I cooked this on high for 4 hours and the onion was very crunchy and I don’t like crunchy onions in my soup.  After cooking on high for about 6 hours, the onions finally softened and the flavors in the soup came out better. I did substitute a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth for the 2 cups of water and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  My husband and I both really liked this and I’ll be making it again, but probably sticking to cooking it for 6-7 hours,

After reading other reviews, I used whole skinless boneless chicken breasts right out of the package.  Used chicken broth instead of water, and added a can of black beans when I shredded the chicken breasts.  Left cilantro out and served it on the side as a garnish along with shredded cheese and sour cream.  Everyone loved it.

I did this in a slow cooker, but was short on time.  So it only sat in there for about 3 hours.  It was awesome!  Will definitely make again.  Added a can of black beans, as chicken tortilla isn't soup without black beans for me.  :-)

Good recipe!  Put whole boneless, skinless, almost thawed chicken breasts in slow cooker then shredded them near the end of cooking time.  Sauted onions and garlic before adding.  Used diced tomatoes instead of whole ones.  Used Medium heat Green Enchilada sauce.  Used all chicken broth in place of water. Added some cooked wild rice at end.  Soup still kind of thin but no complaints on taste. So very easy!

Good, but I read the other reviews after I had made the dish that it might be hot with spice. I didn't think it was too spicy but my stepdaughter that it had to much. 
I did add a can of black beans, skipped the corn and added honimy instead and some extra water.  Served it over rice and some Greek yogurt.  Good overall meal.

The soup turned out good.  I read some of the other reviews and took their advice and replaced the water for more chicken broth, I added 1 can of black beans, I replaced the whole, mashed tomatoes with 1 can of spicy Rotel, and I placed 3 raw skinless, boneless chicken breasts into the Crockpot and shredded it 5 hours in.

Next time, I will make a few modifications:
-Since I'm not a huge onion fan, I will likely only use half of an onion.
-I would add 1 more can of black beans (or another bean type to add more color and variety).
-I would also add some rice.   I love hearty soups.
-I may follow the original recipe and season/cook the chicken separately for additional flavor.  I may even play with using chicken thighs instead of breasts.

This was incredibly good. I had to improvise a bit and the end result was delicious. I had leftover taco seasoned chicken that I used and only had green enchilada sauce, otherwise followed recipe.  
Had flour tortillas leftover that I cut into 1/8's and deep fried to serve with the soup.  Will definitely make this again!

Doubled recipe.  Added 2 cans rinsed black beans, 2 cans  drained corn, 1 can rotel mild, 1 lg can enchilada sauce, 1 lg can chilis.  5 frozen chicken breasts.   1 can chicken broth.  No water.  1tsp chili powder.  1 tsp cumin.  4 cloves garlic.  1 chopped onion.   1 tsp dried cilantro.    Crock pot the entire day.     Maybe a little too much tomato taste?  Still really good.

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked the chicken in the soup. I think it came out bitter/sour. Upon first tasting it I wondered if I had already added a lime but no I hadn't. I don't know how to save it at this point. I added more water and dash of sugar but it barely helped reduce the bitter. I think the bitter/sour is coming from the canned chili's and canned tomatoes, maybe the cilantro. I will not be making this again. I'm thinking of adding a can of black beans as a hail Mary to try to save it.

I only used chicken thighs, 
I did not add water after tripling the recipe there was no room,
I substituted hominy for corn, 

"It is very seldom that a soup haunts me like this....but I loved that soup!
Could I get the recipe?
It's supposed to be very cold and rainy tomorrow...perfect day for soup!  And a crock pot is like having
a good wife...dinner is ready when you get home. Lol", my sister.

I usually make the recipe exactly as given the first time but reading reviews I did make minor changes.  I added 4 cups of chicken broth, 2 teaspoons cumin and a tablespoon of lime juice.  I really enjoyed the outcome and will make it again and tweak it a little more for my personal taste.

Made this for the first time tonight. Read all the reviews and appreciated the suggestions.  Used chicken broth instead of water. Added the black beans with jalapenos and chose to use hot enchilada sauce because we like things with a kick! Smelled great and tasted even better. Will be making this often!

Delicious! Followed recipe except used all chicken broth instead of water. I used 2 chicken breasts and 2 chicken thighs. Probably a bit more chicken than recipe called for so more of a stew consistency than soup consistency. Shredded chicken after about 6 hours in slow cooker then returned to slow cooker. Had it the next day for lunch- oh my. So good! Enjoyed every spoonful!

Yum! So easy to make, and very tasty! As others suggested, I used three frozen chicken breasts. Shredded after 4 hours on low. Topped it off with hot sauce that has a hint of lime. I'll be making this one frequently!

Added all ingredients along with 2 frozen chicken breasts, cooked on high for 4 hours. Shredded chicken then Added 1 cup rice, 1/2 cup half & half, 2 oz of cream cheese, and 1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, cooked for another 1. A local restaurant makes a creamy tortilla soup...the few easy changes made it taste just like it.

Amazing recipe, I've made it many times. Instead of using precooked chicken, get some chicken thighs and throw those in the crockpot to cook with the soup. Replace the chicken stock with water if you do this. So much better this way.

Works well as a vegan recipe if you replace the chicken with some black beans and use veggie stock

Great soup for those with busy schedules.  Prep and drop everything in the crock pot and good to go.  I have also made it via stove top and achieved similar results, just gotta let it simmer for a while.  As For variations; I reduced the amount of corn, added a whole  32oz box of chicken stock, and since my family does not like a lot of spice all the can goods are of the "Mild" variety.   It is a hit every time I make it!!

My husband and I thought this was very good.  I made recipe as posted except I used two whole uncooked chicken breasts.  Shredded chicken before serving.  I also added one large zucchini and a can of black beans.  Served with avocado, cilantro, green onions and cheddar cheese.  Made cornbread instead of tortillas.  My only issue with the recipe is that it cooks in much less time than recipe states.  Very good and will make again.

This is my go to recipe for years! My only changes thru the years are way more cilantro- 3- 4T of fresh snipped...i love cilantro, 2T chicken bouillon and a little less corn-about 1/2,  can of drained pinto beans, 1-2 T sugar. Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup uncooked rice the last 1/2 hour or so.  Sometimes i cut the corn in half and add a small can of drained hominy. So Yum!

This is a good recipe that you can throw together before leaving for work and come home to a complete meal. I followed the directions exactly even though I was worried the spices would be too much for my son. He had no problems and the hint of heat really added to the dish. I may cut down on the tomatoes next time, since they seemed to take over.

Quick and delicious!

And since I can't make a recipe without making changes:
I put two bone-in (with skin for flavor!) chicken breasts in a pot with all of the ingredients.  Added one can of drained and rinsed black beans and an ear of corn and omitted the salt.

When I first taste tested it, it tasted very strongly of the enchilada sauce, which I wasn't a fan of.  I diluted it with some water and everything came out great! The first time I made this recipe, I took the soup off of the heat and stirred in some sour cream to add a little richness.  It's fine either way!

I let it simmer for about 1.5 hours, shredded the chicken, threw it back in the pot and everything was fabulous!

Pro-tip:  If you're a fan of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, use bone-in and skinned for soups...all the flavor and none of the bones or skin once it's shredded.  Also, waaaay cheaper!!

I'm not a great cook, but this is EASY! Most difficult part is shredding the chicken, and that's not too much to ask. Very delicious and a great leftover meal too.

This is so delicious and super easy. I added some rice to help thicken it  and shredded the chicken. My boyfriend can't get enough of it. I'll definitely be making this again.

Will definitely make again! Dee-lish-us!!! And very easy to make. I'm handicapped and spending hours in the kitchen making homemade (my favorite) food is next to impossible so I mostly exist on frozen store bought dinners-exist being the key word and not a good existance. This was very quick, easy to make and was so very HOMEMADE GOOD! And there is not a huge mess right now clean up afterwards.

Changed this recipe around with canned salsa instead of enchilada sauce and saluted red peppers I had on hand,  and served over Spanish and plain rice. The toasted  corn tortillas were easy and satisfying.  It's Mexican soup the way  I like it, brought compliments, "this is is a good meal." Will make it again. A great basic recipe!

My only complaint about this recipe is that we rarely have leftovers of this soup!  :)  To please the various palates and texture issues we have in our family, we made a few changes.  We omit the tomato chunks and just use  14 oz. tomato sauce with 1 tbsp of tomato paste, and we leave out the green chiles.  I also add a can of black beans, and I add an extra 1/2 lb chicken and more corn.  I also love that even if you forget to ready it for the slow cooker, it's an easy recipe to whip up in 30-45 minutes on the stovetop (although it tastes SO much better after it's been simmering all day!).    

This is a favorite in our household, enough so that my daughter has requested this for her birthday meal for her 7th, 8th, and 9th birthday.

I basically follow this recipe only put two or three chicken breasts in uncooked and shred just before serving, add a can of drained and rinsed black beans, use a 16-oz. bag of frozen corn, add about 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, omit water and salt and add chicken broth to the top of my slow cooker.  When ready to serve, shred chicken breasts and add salt to taste.  I serve with chopped avocado, grated cheddar cheese, sour cream, lime wedges, additional chopped cilantro and tortilla strips on the top.  A family favorite!  *I've made this on the cook top when I'm in a hurry and/or when I need to double the recipe.  Very easy, very good!

Love this recipe!  I have made it several times, and lately have been adding green chile to it.  I leave the tomatoes whole- I like chunky soup and they're easy to cut with a spoon while eating.

This is so easy and so delicious. Definitely don't pre cook the chicken, just throw it in raw and shred At the end. Also, throw in a can of black beans. Or maybe a bag of the frozen "southwest blend" veggies, it's beans and peppers and corn.

Best tortilla soup.  we like to use gluten free tortilla chips instead of tortillas. Mix in avacado, sour cream, and cheese in a bowl right before eating and scrumptious!

Loved this, with two changes. First, there is no reason to precook the chicken. I just threw in a FROZEN boneless chicken breast and shredded it with two forks before I served it. I also added a can of black beans. This soup tastes amazing!

This was very easy to make.  I followed this recipe exactly as is, except I used cayenne pepper (only 1/8 tsp, which gave a mild kick).  I also took another reviewer's suggestion and added 2 fresh chicken breasts (1 lb), and shredded them about 30 minutes before serving.  I served the soup with cornbread, and provided sour cream, shredded cheddar, and limes for toppings.  My family and guests loved it!

It was good! The homemade tortilla strips were a nice touch. I appreciate the full flavor without all the extra calories of heaps of salt and fat, like some recipes use. We did not have a bay leaf, and we used a 20oz can of enchilada sauce, just because that's what we bought. I would recommend sticking with the 10oz can, because whoa was it spicy. But it was delicious nonetheless! The only hard part was cooking and shredding the chicken, but it was well worth it.

I've made this several times and it's one of my husband's favorites! Of course, changed a few things to meet our tastes. I made this for company so I increased the amount of chicken to 2 lbs, cooked them whole and then shredded about 1/2 hour before serving (added back to soup at end). I used all very low sodium chicken broth instead of water + broth. Added more garlic (we love it), 1 1/2 tsps. regular chili powder and 1 1/2 tsps. chipotle chili powder. Also added a 4 ounce can of fire roasted green chilies, 1 can low sodium black beans, and used diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of whole crushed tomatoes. I added the cilantro at the end when I added the shredded chicken and lime juice. Seems like I changed a lot but really just modified for the degree of spice and texture to what we like. Everyone loves this recipe.

This was fantastic!  After reading a couple of reviews, I made a couple of changes.  To save time, I used a rotisserie chicken. I did not use the Cumin or Chilli powder.  This would have tasted more like a chilli in my opinion.  I also used a 10 ounce can of Ro-Tel Diced Tomateos w/diced chiles.  This was great.  I will be making this soup again today!

I have made this 4 times now.  Of the 2 other recipes, this one is the easiest & best tasting by far.  I agree with many others that adding more chicken stock, or broth, helps the liquid base flavor become more robust.  I just add in an extra 12-15 oz of chicken broth on top of what is in the recipe.  Also, I did have to reduce the chile pepper, and this is coming from a Mexican food loving San Diegan.  I think the heat depends on the freshness and the intensity of the chilies used, both fresh and in the powder form.  So, if you don't like it hot, reduce the intensity &/or amount of chile & powder in this recipe by 1/2.  QUICK TIPS:  1.  shred chicken from an already roasted grocery store chicken.  2.  Just crumble up good quality tortilla chips, like blue corn tortilla chips.  Still tasts great, but is less work. 3.  Of course!  Add shredded cheese, avocado & some lime juice to finish it off.  It won't taste authentic without those elements.  Enjoy!

So amazing, added to favorites for many future times, thanks for sharing Elena! We sped this up in the slow cooker on max high and it was ready in two hours. Instead of green peppers, we used jalepenos and roasted a poblano pepper in the oven to add. Gave a nice roasted pepper taste. Topped with fresh avocado, white onions, cheese, lime juice, and Fage yogurt (healthier alternative to sour cream)

I wanted to make it heartier so I added a can of drained black beans and 1 cup of brown rice with 2 cups of chicken broth.  The rice got soggy so next time I will cook it separately (in the chicken broth) and at it at the end.  With the additional ingredients it might be best to increase the amount of cumin

I doubled this recipe and served at a potluck lunch at work.  For toppings, I served the soup with store bought tri-colored tortilla strips, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and fresh cut limes.  I used chicken stock instead of broth because it has a stronger flavor.  Because I doubled the recipe and had to use two cans of enchilada sauce, I used red and green.  Everyone loved it and there were endless compliments!

Love this soup! Have made several times. We pour this soup over  a recipe of black beans and rice, then top with sour cream & cheese and it is divine! I use Red Gold diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, as well as the can of whole tomatoes. I also pressure cook my chicken, then use the chicken stock as my broth in the soup. I also do not make my own tortilla strips, buying them is much, much easier and tastier!

The only changes I made was to substitute chicken stock for the water, and I skipped the enchilada sauce completely.  I also deep fried corn tortillas.  My kids do not like tomatoes, and are leery of anything "spicy".  They still loved it.  One of my kids had many servings.  It was very similar to the restaurant version that I had and loved.

Excellent and so easy to make. Gluten free too! used Rotel in lieu of plain tomatoes and it was great! Whole family loved it. If I'm cooking stovetop, I sauté the onion prior to adding to the soup.

This was great! I did follow a few other reviews and made a few changes. I made it for a small family get together and I sent the leftovers and recipe with them! IF feeding more than 6-8 people  double the recipe. I though it could use a little more broth, I will do that next time. 

The changes I made were: 3 large raw chicken breasts in the crock pot, used all chicken broth and no water, added a can of rinsed and drained black beans. Squeezed a fresh lime in the soup about half way through cooking.  Turned out AMAZING! Will def make again!

Made as is except use chicken broth instead of water, and put in raw chicken and shredded 2 hours before it serving. Covered with premade tri colored tortilla strips. Very good.

I have to say something about this site. I have perfected so many recipes with the help of All Recipes. This recipe was one of the winners. I threw in 6 chicken breasts and shredded them at the end and added a can of black beans as other reviewers suggested. This is a very good recipe. Use it to entertain guests. It will be a hit guaranteed.

I've never been a fan of the thought of tortilla soup.  But this soup is AMAZING!! I can't stop eating it while I make it!!  I use chicken stock instead of water and broth.  I also use frozen already shredded chicken, cuts down a lot on prep time!

Great and easy recipe.  I will make it again my family loved it.  The changes I made I used all chicken broth no water and I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker with everything.   The chicken was shredded after cooking for 3.5 hours.   It was delicious.

Very Good and super easy to make. I agree to use fresh homemade green chili sauce if possible.  Fresh is always better!

Loved it!  Was super quick and easy to make and came out perfect.  Used about 2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast.  No need to pre-cook, just throw in the bottom of the crock and shred with 2 forks about an hour before you are ready to serve.  I also added 1 diced seeded jalapeno for a little extra kick.  I skipped making tortilla strips and just bought a bag of pre-made ones at the grocer.  I served with some shredded mexican cheese on top and some more fresh cilantro.  In the future some sour cream, creme fraiche, cotija cheese, and/or avocado slices would be nice as well.  Should have served with some lime slices, woops!  Maybe adding some drained black beans in the beginning would work well.

Great start on the base of what you are doing.  First time I made it, I followed everything.  Once I got that down I kicked it up.  I added tomato paste to make it thicker, added crushed, diced and tomato sauce.  I also kicked up the heat. Very awesome.  Big thanks for the recipes.

This was okay but there was something missing... I like a fresher soup made with zucchini and a lot more kick!  Next time I'll go back to my "go to" for this soup.  If you are a working mother/ father this crock pot recipe is suitable for lots of palates.

This is definitely a keeper! Instead of using cooked chicken I used frozen chicken thighs. That saved me time. I shredded the chicken towards the end and added it back to the soup. I also used 2 lbs of chicken. I want my soup meaty. As one of reviews suggested, I added mexican style cheese and sour cream to the soup (restaurant style). It cuts the spiciness.

Easy and delicious!  I used half of the amount of chili powder just to make sure that it wouldn't be too spicy for my toddler.  It came out with just the right amount of kick.  I put two chicken breasts uncooked, shredded them after 3 hours and threw them back in.   I topped it with cheese and sliced avocado.  I will be making this again.

This was fine. It needs a little bit more spice. If I make it again, I would double the pepper and chili powder.

So very yummy.  Will make this again and again. As others advised, I added a can of black beans and a cup of fresh mushrooms.  I also doubled the cumin and bay leaves. Everybody raved about it.

I simply put raw chicken breasts (still 1lb) in the crock pot after I combined the other ingredients. After it was done, the chicken shreds pretty well with a fork (use tongs to hold the chicken while shredding) Came out amazing!

Very tasty soup! I followed another reviewers advice and used raw chicken thighs with skin removed instead of the precooked chicken. I cooked it on high for 5 hrs and the thighs were very tender (I removed the thighs after 5 hrs and pulled the meat from the bones and returned the meat to the crock pot). Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I gave it 4 stars because I reserve the 5-star rating for recipes that are absolutely superior in taste. While this soup is very good, it doesn't meet my standard for superior taste. However, I do highly recommend this recipe.

Love, love love, this and will make it again and again! Only change I made was adding a seasoning mix that I make (Reata blend) I'm a Texas girl..  it has all the seasonings in it that the recipe called for. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T!! SO DELICIOUS!! My husband and daughter are sooo picky and they loved it!! The  tortilla strips I only baked for about 8 minutes. Had to make more because they were eating them!!  Perfect !! Loved everything about it and cannot wait to have the leftovers tomorrow !! Thank you for sharing!! :)

I made this for my Bunko group yesterday and they all loved it!  Rave reviews, went back for seconds, and requests for the recipe!  I will definitely be making this again.  The only change I made was to add the chicken breasts frozen and let them cook all day in the slow cooker.  I took them out, let them cool, shredded them and added back to the soup - fabulously easy! Oh, and I doubled everything for the larger group of 12.

This recipe turned out great! It was very easy to make and pretty inexpensive. I used raw chicken which I cut into strips. After a few hours it was shredding when I stirred.  I also garnished with Mexican cheese and sour cream. The cheese melting into the hot soup is amazing!

Amazing recipe. Frozen chicken breast works great--just add some cooking time. I use Frontera enchilada sauce in the jar and I skip the tortillas. I usually make some rice to serve it over.

Very good.  I used a roasted chicken from the store (skin removed), added black beans (rinsed), and all chicken broth instead of the water.  I didn't add any salt, and used low sodium everything.  Needs some lemon or lime juice.  Tortilla strips are super easy to make, and cheaper than buying.  Highly recommend.  Thanks for posting.

This was my first time making this soup. I used my crock pot and made it for our ladies bunco night. 
It was a hit!!
I added the black beans as previously suggested. 
Had cheese, onions and sour cream on the side. 
Love, love this soup.

Made this exactly how the recipe said, no changes and it was amazing. 

I garnished with lime juice, Mexican blend cheese, and sour cream.

I don't know that it made a difference, but I did the 8 hours on low instead of 3-4 on high.

This was delicious! My picky husband asked for seconds! I did add a can of black beans as suggested by others. I bought a rotisserie chicken from the store and just shredded the breast. Perfect meal for this cold weather!

This is my daughter's favorite soup, and I make it at least twice a month. Here are my modifications, since I own  Ninja slow cooker that allows me to brown meat and then turn it to slow cook mode.  1)  Brown chicken (with bone in, I use thighs).  Add onion and brown in chicken fat for a minute or so, then add garlic.  2)  Add the rest of the ingredients, but double the enchilada sauce and instead of using chicken broth, use the cans to add water then use chicken boullion cubes (I add three).  3) Add one SMALL head cabbage chopped then cook as directed.  4) Before serving, take the chicken out discard skin and bone and readd to the soup.  Made this way, the soup is very filling and satisfies my mother instinct to sneak veggies into everything.

This recipe was very spicy.  I followed the recipe but did not add the chili powder because it was already so spicy.  It was way too spicy for me to eat that I added sugar, milk and cheddar cheese to it. I will not be making this again.

This was great...I changed some stuff.  I used stewed tomatoes and blended them to purée...3 frozen chicken breast and removed bay leaf and shredded 2 hours prior to serving.  Used 3 tsp garlic, 16 oz enchilada sauce, 1/2 lg onion, 4 oz green chiles, 1/2 tsp salt, 2tbsp chopped cilantro and 3 cups chicken broth plus all other spices as directed.  No corn and serve with  chips and garnish with lime juice, shredded cheese,sour cream and avacado.

Used the original recipie with the exception of using chicken broth instead of the water and added a can of jalapeños.  It was delicious! I added sour cream and cheese as well as crumbled corn chips on top.  Yum!

After added much more seasonings than called for it tasted great.  I'm still giving it a 4 because it was my fault that I had to add more, I had about 2x the chicken in it.

This soup is DELICIOUS. And so easy and light. I use rotisserie chicken that I don't add till the last 1/2 hour. I also roughly chop the tomatoes and add a rinsed can of black beans. Instead of the water I use all chicken broth.  The recipe as written is great, these are just some tweaks I've made over time!

I have made this soup many times. I love it! The only alterations I make are that I use canned Tyson chicken (to save time) and rather than enchilada sauce I use tomatillo salsa. Fantastic recipe.

Delicious soup.  So easy.  I used frozen chicken breasts and just shredded them and added back to the soup before serving.  I also added a can of black beans, drained and rinsed.  Definitely be making again.

So yummy!  Used 1 can crushed tomatoes and 1/3 can whole plum tomatoes.  Added 1 can rinsed black beans.  Used 2 raw split chicken breasts (skin removed). And shredded chicken 1 hour before serving.  Topped portions with extra cilantro, avocado, cheddar cheese, squeeze of fresh lime juice and crumbled tortilla chips.  AMAZING

Great recipe! Put in raw chicken tenders because it's what I had. They were actually frozen. Then red kidney beans instead of corn. I used old El paso enchilada sauce, 1 can green chiles, 1 can diced tomatoes, 3 cups of water and 2 chicken buillion cubes, 2 tsp diced garlic from a jar, 2 tsp cumin, salt & pepper.  I wanted to use up some bell pepper that was going bad so I chopped it up and threw it in. 3 hrs later I shredded the chicken. At 4 hrs I put some in a bowl, topped with a fiesta blend of cheese, cilantro and avocado with some chips (regular Tortilla chips I crushed in my hands) Soooo good!!! I might throw in some jalapeños on the next bowl.

Made this for a sick friend on a cold winter night.  Absolutely awesome!  Next time, I will wait to add the water after all the ingredients are in the crockpot.  You know, make sure all the good stuff is in already.  I doubled the recipe and ran out of room!

Our daughter works at Rubios and I love their tortilla soup so I came on to look for a homemade recipe since I was craving it. I had some pork roast & mexican rice and black beans leftovers I thought would be great in this instead of using a chicken. Everything else was the same, I also added in 2 more cups of chicken broth at the end since mine thickened up a little. Added a bunch of toppings and it came out GREAT!! Mr. loves it!

I made this tonight, & it was delicious!!  I didn't use enchilada sauce, as I could not find any pre-made in the store, I also substituted tortillas for Toastido Cantina chips that I broke up & heated in the oven. I also used chicken from a rotisserie store bought chicken to speed up the whole process. I topped the soup with Mexican cheese, the chips, & some sour cream. My boyfriend said it was delicious & rated it a 10! I will be making this one again for sure!!

Delicious. I didn't have any stock on hand so I added in the chicken carcass in to create the broth while it slow cooked. I also opted for black beans instead of corn and didn't add the chiles. Topped the soup off with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese. Will definitely make again.

followed direction exactly.. came out great.. i bit too spicy for kids...... Also, i bought low sodium chicken broth, so ended up having to add 2 tablespoons of Knorr chicken flavor bouillon.. this made it so much better. will try next time with beans and more chicken.

Very good soup. I used all the ingredients as listed except for the added water, which I planned on adding if it was needed (it wasn't), and I used frozen chicken breasts instead of pre-cooked chicken. I also added a can a black beans to stretch it a little further.

The hubby and I loved this soup! I too cheated by using 1lb raw chicken breast cut into thin slices. I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of water and a can of black beans (with it's liquid). To serve I used a divided appetizer platter with cilantro, shredded cheese, sliced avocado, and lime wedges.

I followed a lot of the suggestions. Cooked the 3 boneless chicken beasts in the soup, then shredded. Added can of black beans in chili sauce, used can of crisp corn, used broth in place of water, used Rotel tomatoes with chilies in   place of tomatoes/chilies and added the juice of one lime. Topped with shred cheese, sour cream, fresh avocado and additional cilantro.

Fantastic recipe for the busy mom. My husband loved it and said it didn't upset his tummy. Even the kids ate it.  I served with sour cream, shredded cheese, and some added Chalula or Tapatio for some spice.

My entire family loved this, even my picky 5 year old. I followed someone else's suggestion, and just put the chicken breast in frozen. It was well cooked by the time 8 hours rolled around. Easy and delicious! Who could ask for more?

It came out fantastic!! Tons of raves from my family. The only thing I did differently was to add Green Enchilada sauce and omit the green chiles. This is absolutely a favorite now. Thank you

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times. I always throw my chicken in frozen, add black beans, and a can of mushrooms, and use chicken broth instead of water. I made this for my parents when they were visiting once, and now my dad regularly requests it. It tastes even better the next day after sitting in the fridge overnight. I generally just pop it back in the slow cooker on low and let it simmer again for a few hours the next day.

This was SO good! I mostly followed the recipe, choosing hot enchilada sauce and hot green chili peppers - it added a tiny kick, but tame enough so that my 10 year-old enjoyed his meal.  The two alterations I used were fire roasted diced tomatoes (slightly drained) instead of mashing up whole, peeled tomatoes, and substituting one of the cups of water with a light beer. We served our soup with sliced avocado, shredded cheese, sour cream and slices of lime.  It was amazing and full of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit with my family!  I cooked the chicken first and shredded it which was a pain.  Next time I think I'll try other suggestions and just throw the chicken in the pot to cook.  I also used Mrs. Espys Enchilada sauce recipe from this site.  After putting it in serving bowls I added some cut up avocado, shredded cheddar, and a squeeze of lime.  Delicious and not too spicy!   This is a keeper!!

Like other reviewers suggested I put my chicken in frozen and was able to easily shred it 3 hours later on low. 

The soup itself was flavorful though I definitely felt it was lacking in heat and fresh peppers. Next time I'll be using medium or spicy enchilada sauce, jalapeno, and perhaps a Serrano or poblano pepper. Other than that it was great topped with cheese, avocado, cilantro and lime! Very filling.

Absolutely fabulous!  I used dehydrated cilantro and added a can of corn near the end because I didn't have frozen corn.  I just put in 3 small chicken breasts and shredded them after they cooked all day.  When served, I added a bit of cheese and fresh avocado - ummm!  I'm one for changing recipes all the time, but this is very yummy just the way it is - my honey & 7 year old agree!

Made a few small changes! Used rotisserie chicken....used a can of Rotel....threw in extra tomato and a can of ranch beans....not enough broth so I boiled the rotisserie chicken and more seasoning in water to make extra broth so there was more soup. Love chicken tortilla!

Everyone raves. I use only Mexican enchilada sauce (e.g. La Victoria) because there's no MSG, and I cheat even more and used crushed tomatoes instead of whole. Love!

This was delicious! Everybody loved it. I served with avocado slices, lime juice, extra cilantro, cheese and tad bit of sour cream. Yum!! UPDATE: there is no way to go wrong with this recipe. I have made it with many substitutions and it always turns out tasty. I now add a bottle of dark Mexican beer and homemade taco seasoning. This time I threw in sofrito and that was delicious. I have also substituted tomato sauce for enchilada sauce and usually used Rotel for the tomatoes bit. Also good with a dash of Thai chili peppers. Limes avocado and cilantro are a must. I love cheddar cheese and Fagé Greek yogurt (I always sub that for sour cream).

I have made this recipe numerous times and always forget to leave a review, so here it is. I LOVE this recipe,  it is quick to throw together. The only changes I made were, I add 6 cloves of garlic, I add 1 can of Black beans and 2 cans of green chilies.  I also poach my chicken in chicken stock for 20 minutes and then I shred it and throw it into the slow cooker.  This recipe is one of my favorites to make!

The list of ingredients might be a little daunting, but this recipe is SO easy, just open up the cans and dump in the slow cooker.  You can easily save yourself some time by putting raw chicken in the crock and cooking it with the soup.  Just shred it up before serving.  The only other changes I make are using petite diced tomatoes instead of smashing the whole ones, and decreasing the green chiles as I don't like it to be too spicy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made it exactly as the recipe called for although I did add a can of black beans (rinsed) and I put 2 chicken breasts in the pot raw and shredded 2 hours before the soup was done. Everyone loved it.  Only change I may make next time is to use crushed tomatoes instead of the whole ones. Will definitely make again.

I really like the flavor.  I cooked 8 hrs on high and my onions were still crunchy.  I also used fresh chilies and they were a little crunchy.  My husband suggested Carmelizing them before adding.  I know it's another step but it might be a good solution.  (He had seconds ) I added black beans as suggested and I would add more next time.  Just a personal preference,  not necessary. Definitely will make again.  An added bonus. ..I had this soup planned and it rained in So  California  today.

This is a wonderful recipe...and very versatile. I add rinsed/drained black beans. Serve with shredded cheese and sour cream. I've used frozen chicken, canned chicken, frozen corn, canned corn, added green chilies...basically, whatever is in the house at the time. It's ALWAYS come out wonderful! Easy to add extra ingredients (more broth, tomatoes, etc.) if you need to stretch it out to feed more. Freezes well (if there are any leftovers - ha!). I make it in my slow cooker, or if pressed for time, in my pressure cooker! Definitely a "must try"...and is always a top request by my family (kids included...they always ask for "taco soup").

Yum! I don't precook the chicken breast, and like to puree most of the whole tomatoes before adding them. Very flavorful soup.

Really delicious! I made a vegetarian version of this recipe for a get together and everyone raved! Changes I made: used veggie broth instead of chicken, subbed 1 can pinto and 1 can garbanzo beans for the chicken. I added a zucchini and some celery and followed reviewer mexicankaren's suggestion for homemade enchilada sauce with dried peppers boiled on the stove. Served with cheese, avocado and sour cream. I'm making it again a few days later, because everyone ate the first batch!

Made this for a little gathering we had (along with a bean salad and green salad).  It was a hit!  In addition to the garnish recommended in the recipe we added a little sour cream and I feel like that took the soup up another notch of 'yumminess'.  Will definitely make again.

I followed many of the suggestions made in the comments & reviews of this recipe. I cooked the chicken breasts in the soup, I swapped in broth for the water, added in black beans, used 1 can of Ro-tel tomatoes with chilies and 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes (double recipe). I pureed some of the black beans with some of the broth to help thicken the soup, but the broth was still really thin, which I didn't love.

Everyone loved this soup! I doubled the recipe and added a can of black beans. Also, the soup seemed a bit thin, so, I puréed some cooked corn in a little of the soup's liquid and stirred it back in. This gave the soup a richer body.

Loved it!  I left out the green chilis because I don't really care for them but the soup did not suffer because of it.  I really liked it the way it is however next time I will lessen the amount of chili powder to see how it comes out.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! This is something I'll make again, and worth a try if you haven't! Wonderful flavor, tasted kind of like an enchilada in liquid form, and I love enchiladas. Used rotisserie chicken, broth instead of water and added 4 jalapeños. Used tortilla chips out of a bag and did not feel this compromised the recipe.

It was great!  I used Costco’s rotisserie boneless chicken for the soup.  I garnished it with a dollop of sour cream and tri-colored tortillas.  Maybe I will add avocado next time.  I will make it again soon.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes because it's easy to make, healthy, and delicious!

I've made the recipe exactly as stated and it was wonderful.  I've also substituted the water with more chicken broth, I've made it in a slow-cooker or (when no slow-cooker was available) I cooked it for less time in a big pot on the stove. Delicious any way I've made it!

The only thing I've changed after about 10 times of making this is that I don't cook the chicken first. For the sake of cleaning one less thing, I just throw the raw chicken in with everything else. Then about 15-20 minutes before I'm ready to serve it, I take it out, shred it, and throw the shredded chicken back in. I garnish with everything the recipe recommends, and sometimes add a dollup of sour cream too. Thanks for sharing it!

Love this recipe!  Due to time constraints, I made this on the stovetop.  I will be making it again and my husband agrees that it should be added to our rotation.  Thank you so much for sharing  :D

I have made this recipe about 10 times now. My whole family loves it. I usually add a bag of 90sec rice at the end. It is very hearty. Even my 5 yr old daughter loves it. We also squeeze 1 lime in it. The rice can make it like mush the next dat but we then scoop it w tortilla chips. :)

Great! I added small white beans and used green enchilada sauce.  I also used a pablano pepper and halfed the chili powder so the kids would eat it.  The lime juice at the end is key.

Very good. Used 2 cans of  Rotel tomatoes with chili peppers, added 2 can of black beans and 1 can white beans.  Put chicken in crock pot raw and shredded later.  Didn't add the chips, but topped with cheddar cheese.

Great foundation for tortilla soup! These are the changes I made and it is SUPERB! 
I always boil chicken pieces with skin on. Long enough to get REAL chicken broth. Followed the basic recipe though. Place chicken (removed from bones) in the crockpot, along with all broth from the cooked chicken about 5 cups or so. Added 2 cubes of Knorr Caldo de Tomate bouillon, chicken base 2 tsp or to taste (I prefer the brand Better than Bouillon...so flavorful B-)  i added 2 chopped pickled jalapeno- didn't have green chillies in a can....plus its cheaper! Added 3 tsp. of McCormick Enchilada seasoning mix INSTEAD OF enchilada sauce! (You will find this in an envelope in the spices section of your local grocery store..also cheaper) Just remember...its not necessary to use can chicken broth when you boil chicken pieces versus plain breasts ...YUCK! Also....you can use MORE water and add a little more enchilada seasoning OR bouillon/ chicken base. I realize its more involved not using breasts...but it tastes like Authentic Tortilla Soup ...as we call it in Texas. Thanks for the recipe! Just love this KEEPER RECIPE!

I've made this so many times now, and each time it's a huge hit! The first time I made it, I made a few substitutions on accident, but my family liked it, so it stuck. The recipe calls for a 10oz can of enchilada sauce, but I use the entire 28 ounce can. Also, I replace the water with chicken broth, and omit the green peppers. We like to buy some home made tortilla chips from a local Mexican market, and when it's done cooking, sprinkle those on top,  with a bit of cheese, and it's the best! This has become a staple for us!

Delicious!  I added black beans and more chicken stock in lieu of the water.  Two fresh chicken breasts were added directly to crock pot, saving a step. (Shredded it after about three hours.)   Served the soup with fresh cilantro, lime wedges, pepper jack cheese and cubed avocado.  My entire family loved it!!

I've made this soup more times than I can count and it's a hit every time. I add this and that to the recipe each time I make it but I always add black beans because we love them. I also use mild everything to control the heat. Fire roasted tomatoes are a flavorful addition. Also a squeeze of fresh lime at the end adds a brightness to this soup. Yum!

It's pretty good, but lacking flavor. Per the reviews, I used only chicken broth & frozen chicken breast. I cooked it on low for about 8 hours- the chicken was perfect. For my taste, I'd probably double the spices. I added some homemade roasted padron pepper puree to add more spice. But still needs something.

The only change to the recipe I made was to add the tortillas TO the soup, then give it another 20-30 minutes.  The tortillas soften, then devolve, giving the soup a thicker quality.

It is extremely important to stop cooking at that point or the soup will burn on the edge of the slow cooker.  Ask me how I know ;->

The soup freezes very well and keeps practically forever.
I am the only one in the house who eats it, and it keeps me going all winter.

Love this one!

Made this for my boyfriend and we both loved it! I reduced the amount of salt and added some cajun seasoning (probably 1/4 tsp or so), along with a few dashes of chipotle hot sauce. I couldn't find enchilada sauce at the store, but Ortega taco sauce seemed to work fine. 

As some other users commented, I found it easier to throw in some raw, boneless skinless chicken breasts (I used almost 2 lbs for a heartier soup) then shred them towards the end. 

I also cooked some rice on the side and served the soup over it instead of using tortilla strips - stretches it farther and tastes great!

I made this last night and it was amazing! Definitely better than anything I've has from a restaurant. Living in Southern California, I have easy access to authentic Mexican cuisine, so feel I have a good comparison :) After reading several reviews, I did make the following adjustments: used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of black beans. I cooked it on high for 4 hours in my slow cooker and shredded the chicken towards the end. Yummy!!!

Delicious!!  A few simple changes but nothing that would change the overall recipe.  I omitted the water & used all reduced-sodium chicken broth instead.  We reserved the cilantro to put on top versus cooking into the soup.  I took another reviewers advice & put the chicken breasts in whole & shredded them after they cooked....very easy & not time-consuming at all.  I skipped making my own tortilla strips & just picked up a bag of tortilla strips from the store & they were great served on top.  *Slow-cooker friendly, perfect for a cool day, & a good pick me up when you're sick with a cold.  Will definitely make again.

One of the best tortilla soups I've ever had! I used a large can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole, peeled tomatoes. I also didn't use any water but used chicken broth to fill my large crock pot once all the other ingredients were added. We topped with shredded cheddar and the tortilla strips and everyone in the family raved about it, kids and adults. Can't wait to make it again!

Everyone loved it. My picky son even ate it all up. My husband said to put it on the revolving menu. Followed recipe except I didn't cook the chicken before hand. I put in the raw chicken in the crock pot in the beginning, on low for 7 hours. Topped with sour cream, store bought tortilla chips and I put hot sauce (Cholulu) in my bowl because I like it spicy.

This recipe was so good, that it propelled me to write my first review.  The only thing I did different was to buy pre-made tortilla strips to cut down on time.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Absolutely delicious!  All 4 of my kids ate it up, and that is saying quite a bit--they never agree on dinner!

I tried this taco soup a couple of years ago and it has become one of our favorites. I have been asked for the recipe several times and was glad to pass it along.  It has also become one of my son-in-law's favorite soups. He cannot have anything that had milk or milk products in it and this fit the bill to a tee.

I put the chicken breasts in raw and let them cook until just before eating. then I take them out and pull them apart with a fork and put back in the soup.  Very easy to do.

I really really loved this! Tastes like what you get from a Mexican restaurant. I used 2 cans of tomatoes, because I love them. I also put the onion and green chilies in a food processor and made a puree because my family and I don't like chunks of onion in our food but we like the flavor. Worked out great! Will definitely make again!

Trying to eat healthy, I didn't complete steps three and four. No doubt, the baked ships would have been an excellent addition. That noted, this soup is an excellent combination of ingredients. It's a great fit for the slow cooker since the long cooking process allows the ingredients to combine for a long time.

Tried this for tonight for dinner.  Wasn't as good as I expected, but my husband loved it.  I made it exactly as specified but it had too much tomato for my personal taste.   I may make it again, but cut down on the tomatoes, maybe use fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

A good basic start. The best way to fix it when it's too watery is to crush up some tortilla chips and cook them in the soup to act as a thickening agent. I too put in frozen chicken breasts and shredded them just before serving.  I also use pinto beans rather than corn, so throw a can of drained pintos in just a bit before serving.  Throw on a bit of shredded cheddar cheese, a couple of avocado slices and garnish with chopped cilantro and crushed tortilla chips and you have a great main dish.

I make this almost every Sunday and eat it for lunch throughout the week. I don't use a slow cooker or chicken breasts. 

To make this more economical (and tastier), I use about 1.5 lbs chicken drumsticks or legs. Heat a bit of oil in a stock pot, salt and pepper the chicken, and brown it (~6 minutes, then turn for another 6 minutes). Throw all the soup ingredients in (plus a can of black beans). I also do not use water, I use chicken broth for the entire amount of liquid called for in the recipe. Simmer for however long you'd like. I usually do 2 hours.

Then,remove the chicken with tongs, place on cutting board and shred with a fork or your hands, removing the fatty skin and then throwing the chicken from the bone back in the soup. Let simmer another hour and it's done. Really great. Thanks!

I replace the water with chicken broth and cook the chicken breasts all day in the crockpot. I dump an entire 32 oz box of chicken broth in the crockpot since the crockpot cooks all day. When done ladle into bowls and add Mexican cheese and tortilla strips. Yummy! This is one of my family's favorite soups.

Have made this a hundred times and it's always a winter favorite. Lots of corn and chicken and petite diced tomatoes make it so good. And it lasts for a few days since there are only two of us so it takes no time at all deciding what to make for dinner!

Very delicious. Not as thick as a more traditional tortilla soup but a delicious broth based soup. My family loves it and super easy to make. I did read through other reviews and added a can of black beans as suggested and used lime juice. Great soup!

This soup is very good! The only change I made is that I only added 1 cup of water, and I am glad I did. It would have been to soupy for my tastes had I added 2 cups. Other than that I followed the recipe as written.

This is my go-to chicken tortilla soup recipe. I add a can of black beans and a can of corn, rather than the frozen corn. Serve with lemon or lime wedges, crush some tortilla chips into it and add some sour cream before serving. You can also add some shredded cheese, too.

Love this recipe. I use 2 extra cups of chicken broth instead of the 2 cups of water. 
It's my go-to recipe when I'm having a bunch of people over and I don't want to slave away on a dinner for hours. 
I also add some black beans to add a bit more protein to the soup.

Tortilla Soup is one of my favorite soups ever. This one BLEW me away... so delicious! My Honduran husband and I kept talking about how good it was. So flavorful :) We added more cilantro, squeezed lime in it, and a dollop of sour cream. Muy Bien.

I thought it was very bland.  Next time I will use hot chili's and sauce, less water and more broth to see if it gives it some flavor.

My family loved the flavor of this soup. It's a great base recipe. I'm making it again tonight and I'm adding in carrots, celery, and chayote. The original recipe seemed to be missing something... We wanted more veggies.

This recipe rocks!  One reviewer recommended putting the chicken in raw which makes even easier.  I think I will try adding the black beans next time too!

I love this recipe. I have made it several times.  The only change I made is that I use a 32 oz organic low salt chicken stock instead of the can and water.  I also add black beans. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very easy soup.  I gave it 4 stars because I used an 11 oz can of corn and it was way too much corn.  I also would use chicken broth next time instead of the water.  You don't have to have cooked chicken on hand - you can cut boneless skinless chicken into spoonful sizes and add to crock pot.  Cook for 4 hours on high.  I also added cooked shrimp about an hour before done.

Super easy and I was actually surprised I had made it because it turned out so well. The only alterations I made were: used fresh roma tomatoes (chopped and squished), put chopped raw chicken breast straight into the slow cooker, left out the bay leaf, and used tortilla chips to top. It came out perfectly. Husband had quite a bit of it for dinner and he's usually not a huge soup person. I used a can of hot red enchilada sauce and it added a bit of a kick but wasn't too spicy. Will definitely make again.

To go with the easy method (which is great) I skip the extra water and add another can of broth. I don't us a crock pot as this works just fine on the stove top in under 90 minutes. I don't precook the chicken. I use a half quartered skinless chicken raw with half breast, a thigh, and a leg. Take the chicken out after an hour, discard the bones, and shred, then put back in for another 30 minutes. When I have more time I roast a chicken the day before and have half for that dinner, remove skin from other half and save remaining meat for soup. Boil the other leftover carcass with onions and celery for the broth. There is so much more flavor in fresh broth and meat roasted on the bone. Either way, it's a great recipe.

WONDERFUL!!! I am not a soup eater, just reminds me of being sick as a kid and eating chicken noodle soup, eeeew! But this soup I can't get enough of. I make a huge pot and freeze individual bags for later. Best tortilla soup recipe ever.

This is great! I didn't follow recipe exactly. I used 1 1/2 raw chicken breast, all chicken broth- no water, and no tortillas- didn't have in the house. I have to say, that this will become a main stay during the colder monthes. I am going to try using more chicken breast and frozen chopped peppers and onions (instead of corn)- to make an awesome chicken taco filling.

Delicious and really easy to make. I was a little pressed for time so I pre-cooked the chicken a bit before putting it into the slow-cooker. I put it on high for three hours and the soup tasted wonderful. 

I bet letting it cook for the full eight hours would make it even more flavorful.

This recipe was like the base to build on. I also thru in three raw chicken breasts after the base tasted ok instead of cooked.  they cooked and shredded nicely.

It all tasted great in a different combination.

LOVE THIS! I added some hot sauce to kick this up a bit (we eat a lot of Cajun dishes here). I even used hot enchilada sauce! I also added some leftover cooked brown rice and black beans, found I needed more chicken broth because the rice sucked up so much. Next time I make this I'm adding cayenne pepper, but otherwise it was a hit in my house!

This recipe was delicious! I made the chili sauce the way a previous person suggested. I added 4 ancho chilies to a saucepan with water, 2 cloves of garlic and a quarter of an onion. I boiled it then threw it in the blender with a small can of tomato sauce. I added all of it to my soup. I increased the amount of cumin and salt to maybe twice what it asked for. I used cayenne pepper and doubled what the recipe asked for as well. It had a nice spicy kick. I served it with some sliced avocado and muenster cheese. I am Hispanic and felt this recipe tasted very authentic!

This is a favorite in our house, it's SO good!!  I add a can of black beans (rinsed). Also I'm not a huge corn fan, so I only add a cup of frozen and then also add a red pepper-diced and a cup of diced carrots.  If I want to speed up the recipe for a non slow cooker meal, I sauté all the veggies until tender and use a rotisserie chicken.  When I do slow cook I put in whole pieces of breasts and thighs and just let them fall apart in the cooking.

It ended up incredibly watery. If I were to make it again I would leave out all of the water and use maybe half of the chicken broth.

I am a person who loves flavorful dishes.  I found this recipe while looking for crock pot recipes.  This in my opinion is absolutely the best soup I have every had in my life (I'm 47).  My wife made this and the only modification made was that instead of 2 cups of water we used the broth created from cooking the chicken.

As some reviews suggested, used all stock instead of broth and water, also added black beans for more substance.  Threw the chicken on frozen and shredded shortly before service. Served with fresh avocado. Absolutely fantastic.

So easy and so good! It's very healthy too but of course I made it less healthy by adding cheese and a dap of sour cream. I would recommend adding a bit of avocado and squeeze some lime in as you serve. Yummy!

This is one of our go to recipes at our house! I make a few changes, but they are just based on my families taste preferences. 
- use two cans of rinsed black beans instead of corn
-sub water for chicken broth
-sub crushed tomatoes for whole peeled 

The last thing we do that I think really makes it a hearty soup instead of a watery one is we add rice. Once everything is cooked I add a cup to a cup and a half of minute brown rice and cook it for 10 additional minutes. It absorbs a lot of the liquid so we've played with the quantity. Like I said very good recipe! This is just how we tailor it for our family.

Made it today.. Got a plain roasted chicken from Sprouts pulled it apart and followed the rest of the recipe then added black beans.  Was good! And I had to cook it on high in 3 hours.  Still was tasty!

One of my husbands favorites! A quick short cut: I use a whole rotisserie chicken (pre cooked) or 2 chickens if you like extra meat. I also buy the salad tortilla strips from the salad isle. Enjoy. Fantastic soup!

Made this for my SO and his buddies and it was a huge hit, which is high praise considering he grew up around authentic Mexican cuisine (and is very skilled at cooking it himself). Add a little salt to the tortilla strips before popping them in the oven, and you're good to go.

This is my daughter's most favorite soup! She even requested it for her graduation open house.  The only thing I different was I used fresh boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead of the cooked chicken.

Simple and delicious. Garnished with sour cream, fresh chopped cilantro, and sliced pickled jalepenos. I used bagged tortilla chips. Easy prep because I had left over chicken I was able to shred and throw in the pot.

So amazing! Made it today, first recipe in my first slow-cooker. :) some people said there was to much liquid, not the case, followed it to the T, execpt I used a whole  rotisserie chicken, mashed tomatoes( hubby don't like eating them and I enjoy it more because it didn't seem like a minestrone that has the whole peeled tomatoes also) and didn't have chili powder so I used hot sauce instead (4 splashes). Just enough heat for me and the hubby. I had a lot of room in the cooker so next time going to double the recipe and had beans. :) 

Wondering if I use "Wondra" if the soup would be thicker and still taste good.

I have made this recipe both by the book (mostly) and by substituting the enchilada sauce with dried peppers, per one reviewers recommendation - both ways were delicious, but using dried peppers gave the soup a deeper, more complex flavor. For the soup, I used two negro chiles (also known as pasillas or dried poblanos), and one chipotle, tops and seeds removed, then soaked in hot water and pureed (I learned how to make enchilada sauce from this recipe http://www.homesicktexan.com/2011/04/beef-enchilada-recipe-chili-gravy.html) Both times I added more cumin, one can of rinsed black beans, and I gradually added water, so that I could adjust as needed. You can do this recipe on the stove top if short on time, it's fine. Smoked sea salt made this recipe amazing, if using low-sodium ingredients. I always cook the chicken in the soup then shred it. A little fresh lime juice is a great addition, also.

I made this recipe and loved it, but me and my husband both thought it had way too much cilantro! It overpowers the entire soup. I'm doing it without the cilantro next time.

Love it! I added frozen chicken Breasts, HyVee Fire roasted tomatoes w/ garlic, onions & peppers, 32 0z chicken broth (no extra water).  I let it cook all day, then shredded the chicken when I got home.  I didn't add cilantro on day 1 but did add it to leftovers on day 2 - wow - it was even better.  I was lazy & used brighten chips.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

I added in 1 can of black beans. The enchilada sauce I used was medium and was the perfect amount of spice. Leftovers went in the freezer for a quick dinner after work. My grocery store always has the rotisserie chicken on sale and I keep all the other ingredients on hand so this is super quick and easy to make.

Great tasting soup, but be careful with the tortillas in the oven.  The recipe says 10 to 15 minutes but if you leave them in that long they'll burn to a crisp.  They only need about 7 minutes at 400 F.  

If you deep fry them instead of putting them in the oven they'll taste even better, but if the oil is too hot they'll burn in less than five seconds so be careful there too.

Excellent.  I added black beans and upped the heat using medium enchilada sauce.  Also used low sodium chicken broth in place of water.

This is a great recipe. I did not do it in the slow cooker but I simmered it to perfection in consistency. Husband really loved it. Feel free to tweak to your preferences such as home made this or fresh verses canned that. It is very very good.

I used this recipes to make dinner today and my family loved it. I did not substitute anything because I was nervous to ruin it. It could of used an extra kick of something (spicy) but I thought it would be too spicy with the green chile peppers. So now I know that for next time. I did make the chips from scratch with the tortillas which made a big difference versus the regular tortilla chips you buy at the store. We also added sour cream, lime and avocados to top it off on our bowls. I highly recommend this dish.

The whole family loved it, including my 10 and 14 year olds! I added 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice before serving and salted the tortillas before baking. I agree it could use a little less water. Next time I make it I'll only put in 1 cup of water. I also added the black beans and used fresh chicken breasts and let them cook in the soup. I'll definitely be making this again!

I may have guessed on the chicken broth amount, and had to use dried cilantro but this turned out very good. I think using diced tomatoes next time will make it a bit better for me. I also topped it with a dollop of sour cream and some shredded cheese which I really think helped this soup out.

I made this tonight and we loved it! We normally buy Chicken Tortilla Soup at a local favorite when they sell it, but I think we are done doing that since this was so much better and cheaper to make ourselves! :)

Good soup! First time making soup in my slow cooker. As I was adding all the ingredients i quickly realized my cooker wasn't going to hold it all so I omitted the water, instead just kept the liquid to 1 1/2 cups chicken broth. I added a can of kidney beans, and used 1 can of peaches and cream canned corn instead of frozen. I added a bit of tobasco and used the cilantro, plus monterey cheese and the tortilla strips as garnish. Delish!!

Soup was delicious.  Super easy to make, and perfect as is.  
Though- I did add hominy instead of corn.  I think corn would have been better because of it's sweetness, hominy was good as well.

ok- I made a few changes based on reviews and what I had in the kitchen: I added brown rice, more hot peppers, and made the home made enchilada sauce that another reviewer suggested- although I didn't have ancho chiles,  just frozen jalapenos- I chopped and boiled- seeds and all the peppers w/ 2 garlic cloves, 6 frozen chopped tomatoes, salt and  cumin for the canned enchilada sauce. I also did not have cilantro, so subbed 4 frozen cilantro 'cubes'-  We had lots of cilantro this June, so chopped and pulverized in my food processor w/ water and froze into cubes in the ice cube tray, then threw into zip lock bags- wa la- fresh cilantro taste to anything...I also made home made chicken stock and added that instead of broth and water.. very very good soup! I plan on making this a lot with the chicken stock I canned, along with a few frozen chicken breasts and the seasonings and corn..it's a huge hit!! Even my husband can make it when I am out of town!!

Yum, yum, yum.  I enjoy crockpot recipes and this one was so easy.  I used leftover turkey from Christmas dinner, homemade flour tortillas and homemade enchilada sauce.

Loved it! Husband requested to add cabbage next time. Tortillas only need to be in the oven 10 minutes or less. I sliced my chicken and family requested shredded next time. Don't know how to do that part yet.

Wonderful soup! I made this on a very snowy and cold day. It was wonderful. I did not add cilantro as my daughter doesn't like it but everything else stayed the same. I didn't find the soup too watery. I used rotisserie chicken from Costco and did weigh out the chicken. In my opinion they have some of the best chicken and the best value. Real time saver.

This was great and easy too.  I found Mexican flavored broth at my grocery so I used the entire 32 oz container and didn't cut it with water. It had a little bit of heat which I liked. I put the chicken in uncooked and shredded after about 3 hours.  Boyfriends son went back for thirds.

Love this recipe and so easy! I omitted the shredded chicken but love the enchilada sauce base. I read one review to make your own and I do make my own when making enchiladas and will try it but for a quick soup recipe I use the canned  and of course add cheese as a topping with the corn tortillas but will DEF make this recipe a lot more!

Definitely cook the chicken in the soup.  I thought this was good, not great.  Will make again, but will "spice" it up a little more and add black beans next time.

I found this recipe over three years ago…I’ve made it multiple times without straying off course of its original recipe.  It’s awesome…beloved by all and great for a cold winter day.  Make it initially by way of the instructions before manipulating it…so good.  I’ve added more “heat” by way of spices and added more chicken…everyone loves it.  It’s a staple dish in my house along with chili, chowders and soups.  So good.  As I write this review a batch is cooking up during our Nor’Ester…  Love it.

Alright, I have 4 semi-picky kids including one that is gluten intolerant and another that has food texture issues due to autism and this was a hit!  Not too spicy, not too bland.  I had to omit cumin because I ran out, added more chili powder, added black beans, and used shredded rotisserie chickens because that is what I had available.  Served with a little shredded cheese and tortilla chips (kids love dipping).  Hit with the adults, too.

I have tried so many different tortilla soup recipes, trying to find one my family will like.  This one was simple and so flavorful...and EVERY ONE of my kids loved it! In fact the next day one of my girls asked if there were any leftovers for lunch.  I finally found it!

This recipe was simple and delicious. I even went as far as to just grab a rotisserie chicken and toss it in- 10 mins prep time, easy. After a little too much red wine, we didn't end up eating it until the next afternoon, the extra time did nothing but good for it. Came in from work and it was done and ready. Added avocados and tossed in some tortilla chips.

Delicious! Cooked this on the stovetop instead of crockpot.  After reading other reviews, I threw in 2 uncooked chicken breasts and added the rest of the ingredients plus a can of black beans.  Brought it up to boil , then simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  The enchilada sauce is what makes this recipe.  I used Gebhardt, my fav.  Also, no water, just a quart of homemade chicken stock I had.  Everyone loved it.  thanks.

Simply Awesome. I add a quarter cup of lemon juice and one jalapeno to spice it up a bit. Otherwise it is fantastic. Made it 3 times in the last two months. Also it is great for leftovers.

Amazing  recipe!!! Husband loved it! I'm making it again for him. The amount of spice is just perfect for us, and if you add sour cream and cheese it tones it down. I used up my leftover chicken cubed up and added green and yellow peppers chopped up. Great fix it and forget it recipe.

Great soup and easy to make. I didn't cook mines in the slow cooker, simmered it for a couple hours. Used chicken tender breast and shredded after they were cooked all the way through. Sautéed by garlic and onions before putting them in the pot. Added a tomato cooking base from Goya in addition to the enchilada sauce and a little of coriander, and cayenne pepper. Also, watch the tortilla slices in 10 min. They turned into a burnt crisp. Garnished it with a slice of lime and a dap of guacamole.  Didn't have fresh avocado or sour cream. Will definitely make it again.

I thought the soup was okay, my husband loved it.  I think I just prefer the creamier based chicken tortilla soups more than the tomato based ones.  I also wished it was a bit spicier.

This dish is so easy and delicious. I put it on before church, and it's done by the time we get out. Everybody in my house LOVES this soup. I make it like twice a month now!

The garnishes are a must: 
-Tortillas (We use a whole package (not just 10) and fry them in coconut oil
-Mexican Crema or sour cream
-Crumbled Queso Fresco
-Avocado
-Lime wedges

Thanks for this recipe!!!!

Absolutely delicious and a very easy recipe. We like more heat so I added extra green chiles and substituted El Pato mexican sauce for 1 cup of the water . I also used more chicken (frozen chicken breasts)than it called for to thicken it up a bit. Yum!

Wonderful tortilla soup and I've tried many recipes but this one will be my new go-to recipe for tortilla soup.  I cooked the chicken breasts the night before.  Before leaving for work; I cut up the chicken and threw everything in the crock pot and put it on low.  When I got home, my husband had already eaten some as he couldn't wait for me to get home.  I took it to work with me the next day and served lunch there.  Husband was mad I took his soup.  I will definately make this again.

This recipe was ok. 3 stars just because I found a lot I could add.. I started out with the base of this recipe and added the raw chic breast as others did. A quarter of the way (on low heat) I beefed it up with a cup of rice, cup of chopped celery, 2 more C of chix broth and juice of a lime. The lime made it! Thank you for sharing this, I will be making this again!

My family absolutely loves it! I enjoy how simple it is and how you can play by adding other ingredients and it still tastes the same. I usually cook the chicken ahead of time but I add it later on, otherwise it tastes overcooked and flavorless.  We like to add sour cream, lime, avocados and cheese on it. Absolutely delicious!

Very authentic recipe.   This is a hit in our home, even among the kids (4, 11).  I add the frozen corn (small white kernel) at the very end, so it is very taut on first serving... and taut on reheats as well. :)

Delicious!!! The only addition I made was to add three small sweet potatoes. Making the tortilla strips was easy and so much better than store bought.

I made this at the last hour for a neighborhood Halloween party & it was devoured by both adults, high schoolers and kidlets.  I doubled it for my crock pot and used two mojo rotisserie chickens from the grocery store.  It didn't taste processed or like a canned soup at all and I'm pretty picky.  Thank you for this easy cold weather treat!

Excellent.  I have tried several Tortilla Soup recipes, and this one was by far the best.  I will be including this recipe in my regular line up from now on.

We absolutely love this recipe in our family! We have made it for several parties and the response is always the same... Can I get that recipe?

It was o.k... was very easy to make, but I wouldn't think to make it again unless I had all ingredients in my pantry already.

Loved this - added some pinto beans, used packaged tortilla strips.  Just threw in a partially thawed chicken breast, shredded after 3 hours.  Great meal on a chilly fall evening with cornbread.  Does anyone know how many calories in this soup?

Followed the recipe to a T.. (so not like me - lol) Family and I were disappointed in the way this soup turned out. Enchilada sauce was way too overpowering plus it wasn't spicy at all. I used cheddar cheese as a topper... Will not make this again as a soup.

Love this soup!  Quick and easy using items from pantry and freezer (I threw frozen chicken breasts in w/out cooking).  Used green enchilada sauce and it turned out great, getting rave reviews from friends and boyfriend.

I love this recipe, though to bring it up to a 5 star rating I make some adjustments. I double all ingredients except the chicken broth and remove the water, and also add 2 cans of black beans. I've made it in the past both doubling the chicken broth and/or adding the water, and doing so just makes the soup far too thin.

This is, by far, one of the most amazingly delicious things I have ever tasted.  I am shocked.  I knew close to 3,000 reviews couldn't be wrong!  I will make this every week.  My husband loves it, too.  Oh, and could NOT be easier.  Throw everything in the cooker and plug it in.  I am not a cook and I screw up a lot.  I could do this again without the recipe it was so easy.

My suggestions - just throw the raw breasts in the pot and after three hours take them out, shred, and throw it back in.  I used store bought tortilla chips.  In the bowl top with avocado and shredded "Mexican" cheese.  Oh, and finally, I made my own enchilada sauce.  The stuff in the grocery store was full of ingredients I couldn't pronounce.   So I found a simple recipe online, took 20 minutes, and used that.

I LOVED this soup, and so did my husband. Only 2 substitutions because of what we on hand- coriander for the cilantro and no bay leaf. Topped with cheddar and sour cream with tortilla chips. I would take this in place of many restaurant soups and with just two of us lasted only two days!

Made this last night for my family and extended family and all really loved it.  I added about 6 chicken breasts and extra corn and doubled the dry seasonings. I seasoned, browned and then chopped up each chicken breast before adding to the crock pot. It was delish! A keeper for my recipe box!

I liked this alot and the boyfriend loved it (he gives it 5 stars).
I added a can of black beans (drained) and a cup of cooked rice.  I also added a little bit of fresh lime juice (two squeezes) and a little bit of taco seasoning.  I only used 2/3 of the chili peppers so it wouldn't be too hot.  Also, I cooked the chicken breast in a pan first and shredded. Very good and very easy.

Very good soup.  I used all chicken broth instead of some broth and some water, and it still needed salt, so no worries on it being too salty that way.  Started with semi-frozen chicken breasts and they were cooked and ready to shred on high in about 3 hours...so definitely no need to precook the chicken.  Also added the can of black beans, drained, as others recommended.  Added some additional cumin, served with limes, cilantro, shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips (didn't have time to make my own).  Pretty tasty, and reasonably healthy (except for high sodium content).

best tip from other reviewers.  I season the chicken with extra taco seasoning.  Sometimes I do this and then stir fry the chicken strips.  I add the chicken to the slow cooker and cook for less time.  Then about a half hour before serving i shred the chicken.  I am asked for this recipe more than any other recipe I serve to guests

Just at the end when serving have some more fresh Cilantro and fresh grated Monterrey Jack cheese. Put on top of individual soup bowls and on top of tortillas. MMMM much better.

Great soup! I did not add onions nor green chiles but I did add some taco seasoning and then at the end, I added some cooked white rice to it and my family loved it. The crockpot was empty after dinner. Not a drop left over.

Cut water in half based on other reviews. Chicken was dry so I would add raw next time. Delicious flavor. Will try adding rice and beans on the side next time to add in.

This soup was absolutely delicious!!!  I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, so I only used half of the can of chopped chilies and it was so good.  My wife was so impressed with how good it tasted, she said it tasted like we bought it from a restaurant!

i think without using all broth and the addition of a healthy few shakes of cayenne, the soup would have been a little too bland for us.. also added a can of black beans and used a can of corn instead of the frozen.. didn't precook the chicken.. i like my soups really thick.. more like stews.. so i'd use less broth next time.. ty for the start of something great.. we really enjoyed the end product

I thought this was a great comb.  I did exactly what it called for and it was flavourful, not sure why some people didn't like it, maybe if you think it's to watery add something to make it thicker, like tomatoe paste. Everyone in my house hold thought is was great. I will make this again.

This was great. I had a larger amount of chicken that I put in. After shredding I saved part of it and froze it for Chicken tacos. I also used the leftovers for many other things like wrapping thicker portions in tortillas with sour cream and cheese, my husband loved that. Also mixed leftovers with chili beans and chili powder and rice and put it in the oven. That was really good. Next time though I am going to try to use hominy instead of the corn tortillas just to see how it turns out.

I loved this soup! My husband said it was "pretty good" because he didn't like all of the onion in it.

I added the chicken in chunked instead of shredded so that it would not disintegrate. I also had to leave it in the slow cooker for 10 hours on low and 2 hours on warm and it was fine.

My fiancé loved this recipe!! I made a few adjustments; 3 cups chicken stock instead of the can chicken broth and water, used 3 fresh chicken breasts (took out of crock pot after a few hours, shredded and added back into crock pot), added a can of drained black beans, used fresh plumb tomatoes (with skin removed) in lieu of canned, used a red onion, topped with lime juice and fresh sliced avocado.  The more fresh ingredients the less sodium/preservatives.  So delicious and easy!

I never have all the ingredients. I have never put in the enchilada sauce but usually double the green chiles. Also to cut down on time I just throw the chicken breast in to cook with the soup then remove, shred then throw it back in... I like to add some beans and never forget the fresh cilantro!!! Thanks very much :D

Very nice base. I added chipotle pepper (dried), a half cup of black beans (left over from another recipe) & garnished with cilantro, avocado, and a lime wedge.  I will definitely make this again.

No major complaints but the soup was just a bit bland.  Not one of those recipes that we wanted to save to make multiple times.

This is so yummy!  It tasted almost exactly like the version of this soup at my favorite mexican restaurant.  I didn't use corn - don't like it.  And for convenience sake, we just crushed tortilla chips over the top at serving time, along with a wedge of lime, a dash of hot sauce, and a pinch of fresh chopped cilantro.  Forgot the avocado, but that would have been great too.  Delicious and so easy!

Delicious! My boyfriend raved over this and ate it again the next day for lunch. I added raw chicken breast with everything else, plus extra garlic, and cooked on high for four hours in the slow cooker. I served over rice and beans, with cheddar cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips! SOOOOO good! Will definitely make this again.

This was very good and super easy with a few adjustments.  I threw in 2 frozen chicken breasts with all the other ingredients.  Used all broth instead of water, added some diced peppers, just because I had some to use up, and added a can of black beans.  About 30 mins before serving I shredded the chicken and added it back in.  When serving top the soup with shredded cheese, sour cream, and avocado.  Also I used premise tortilla salad strips.  Hubby said it was better than my usual chicken tortilla soup recipe.  This is definitely ALOT easier so its a keeper.

Wonderful soup.  I have taken other suggestions and used frozen chicken breast to increase the cooking time for our busy schedule.  Does well with 8 hours cooking on low

Great recipe.  Great for a chilly day and all you have to do is toss it in a crockpot and leave it.  There is no need to follow the recipe exactly you can change as you like and make it you own variation.  I make it at least once a month during the winter.

I gave this 2 stars because I had to make significant modifications to make it tasty.  It is a good starting point, but AS IS, the recipe is not that great.  I think many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that there are many variations in the ingredients (different canned enchilada sauces, chicken broths, sizes of onions, etc.).

This is one recipe that I have used for years and how I make it varies  with what I have on the shelf.  I substitute frozen chicken breasts, rotel (we like everything spicy so I use the hot variety), and a carton of low sodium chicken broth for some of the items listed and it always comes out great.

Nice and easy. I also used more chicken broth and didn't add the water. Added a can of black beans, and frozen chicken breast. 4 hrs. on high in the crockpot. Served with chopped onions and cilantro and sour cream. Yummy

So easy-- throw everything in the crock pot in the morning and come home to delicious soup!! I added a can of black beans and used low fat, low sodium chicken broth. Next time I will add some red pepper to kick up the heat. Great healthy winter soup-- thanks!

This is delicious! I make exactly as is and sometime throw in a can of black beans. Always have to make more tortilla strips - can be made quickly by spraying tortillas with canola oil and cutting with scissors. To make seasoned strips, sprinkle with garlic powder and cumin. Good toppings for soup are cheese and avacodo.Thank you for this great recipe!

This recipe was super easy and I had everything on hand, except for the frozen corn so I used canned corn instead.  I couldn't believe how good this turned out.  I used left over boneless chicken breasts from the night before and just diced them up.  I served it in a bowl and topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Yummy!

I love this recipe. I really love that this doesn't have beans in it. It wasn't that big of a hit with my kids thought. I followed the recipe except I didnt cook the chicken prior to putting it in the slow cooker.

This was very good!  I didn't have green chiles, so instead used about two tablespoons of diced, caned jalapenos.  I also added roasted, frozen corn from Trader Joe's and half a can of black beans.  I will make again!

Everyone loved it but it needed salt and something else I cannot quite place. Possibly more cumin. I added the raw chicken whole and let it cook all day, then removed it and shredded it. It basically fell apart. We did not do the actual tortilla part, just ate the soup with a side of homemade pico and chips!

Loved this soup.  I am no expert on authentic latin soups but just loved all the different textures and flavors.  I doubled the cumin, chili powder, and cilantro.  Used frozen chicken and shredded about an hour before done.  I happened to have frozen okra and threw it in when I shredded the chicken and it was a perfect compliment to the flavors and added a nice new texture.  I did add a portion of white rice in a bowel before ladelling the soup on top, then added shredded cheese, sliced avocado, and some fresh lime on top.  I was able to get a different flavor and texture in each bite.  Yummy....

Great stuff. I added a few things like using red and green enchilada sauce and black beans, but I think it would easily stand on its own. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is phenomenal!!! I used two 10 oz cans on rotel since I was out of tomatoes. I garnished with a heap of shredded mozzarella and tortilla chips. I highly recommend mozzarella with this soup. It melts wonderfully and tones down the spiciness of the soup the perfect amount. I can not wait to make this again and again!!

Great recipe! I added a can of black beans and put 3 raw boneless chicken breasts in with the rest of the ingredients. I took the chicken out after about 6 hours, shredded it and put it back in for another 2 hours. I didn't bother with the tortillas; I crumbled tortilla chips over the individual bowls along with some shredded Mexican cheese. I'll definitely make this again.

This was a great soup, honestly didn't make it exactly as written but the main ingredients were the same.  I used a rotisserie chicken that I shredded, used diced tomatoes with green chilis and a cilantro cooking base and turned out great!

This was wonderful. Cubed and browned the chicken with garlic and onion, then added it to the other ingredients. Let it simmer on the stovetop for about an hour and my family almost devoured it. I was hoping to have more left over but guess I'll have to make it again this week!

Very easy and delicious. Instead of tortillas, I made cornbread muffins.  With more chicken it was almost like a stew than a soup.

My family loved this soup!  I added no extra salt.  Used tortilla chips to top off the soup.  I added black beans and rice.  Use canned crushed tomatoes.  And I added more water.

I loved It! EXCELLENT! I made a few changes based on other reviews.
Omitted the corn and added a can of black beans. Might add two next time. I added another can of chicken broth and left out the water. I doubled the cilantro and added at the last hour of cooking. YUM!

I thought this was fantastic.  I used a 7 oz can of green chilies and 4 frozen chicken breasts--took them out and shredded them towards the end. I added the corn and cilantro at the very end.  Super.  We loved it.  EASY, too!!

Very good! I heeded the suggestions and added a can of black beans and 2 cups of cooked white rice, and replaced the water with chicken broth. I made it with mild green chile enchilada sauce and it came out fabulous! I wouldn't change much else, and with these changes I have a 5 star recipe. Serve with a helping of shredded cheese, the tortilla strips and avocado and you're good to go. My family loved it.

I wish I had cooked the onions before I added them.  I wish she had said whether to use green or red sauce, I used green and I didn't really like it.  I've had better.

I really liked this soup. I added a can of rinsed black beans which was awesome. I would use only one cup of water and not two next time. I like my soup to be a little thicker. Overall my family said it was a keeper.

This is an excellent recipe.  Of course I have added my own little touches to it. Cooking the chicken with the soup is a great time saver. Love it, love it!!!   I added a can of Rotel  and some white rice. Topped it with slices of avacados and tortillas chips when served.

Awesome.  So simple, I was skeptical.  But, trusting the reviews, I made it for a party and it was a huge success.  A half dozen people must have asked me for the recipe.  I used low sodium chicken stock instead of water and dumped the raw chicken breasts in with the ingredients and let them cook in the soup.  And I served with store-bought chips.  A+++.

We enjoyed this recipe a lot! It's super easy. With a few tweaks (added a can of black beans, also tried it with 1/2 cup of rice to make it less watery), it is a staple in our house!

This recipe, nothing short of AMAZING!!! I am not a cook and have never made soup before. I had to make a soup for a church function and the crock pot was picked clean! I had a bowl myself and couldn't believe it was so good. I did follow the advice of using 2 cans chicken broth in lieu of water and cooked the chicken in the soup from the get go and pulled it after about 3 hours. I served it with store bought tortilla chips, mexian shredded cheese blend and sour cream. Can't go wrong with this recipe. If I can make it and it turned out this great, anyone can!!

Made this today and even my picky teenage daughter ate it. I didn't change the recipe at all and it was a hit. As my husband says, it is a definite "do over".

This recipe is delicious!  I added hominy to it and it came out wonderful!  It also made the house smell amazing.  For the chicken, I bought raw chicken breast, seasoned it myself with red chili powder, paprika, salt and pepper.  I let it bake in the oven til fully cooked then added it to slow cooker, it came out great!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I will for sure be using this recipe again in the near future!

As others suggested, I put the chicken breasts in whole, then shredded and added them back in, an hour before it was finished.  I did brown it first in a skillet with chili powder and garlic salt.  I also added a can of rinsed black beans.. This was so awesome.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't make the tortilla strips.. just served with store bought ones and taco cheese... This is definitely a keeper!

Great slow cooker recipe that is as good the day after as it is fresh from the crock pot. We usually just buy tortilla chips instead of making the strips but the strips are a fun addition when we have time.

Easy and tasty.  I just tossed whole chicken breasts into the crockpot.  Then, about 10 minutes before I wanted to serve it, I took the chicken breasts out, shredded them, and put it back in the crockpot.  MUST have fresh cilantro to top the soup - so tasty!

I found that adding  roasted veggies to slow cooked soups deepens the flavor.. It is a way to counter the 'blandness' of so many slow-cooked dishes, in addition to sautéing ingredients and  adding your favorite herbs and spices. Here are my modifications--used trader joe's roasted tomatoes with roasted green chiles (for the mashed whole peeled tomatoes and can of chilies), 5-6 cloves roasted garlic, and roasted corn (frozen). I used 3/4 lb of chicken which was plenty. Quite a delicious, thick hearty soup. Freezes well. Will make it again.

I'm not used to enchilada sauce so this was a different taste for me, but overall it was good and easy.  It freezes easily also and makes a great lunch weeks later.

Delicious! The easiness key, as others have noted, is to throw the chicken in raw and let the slow cooker cook it, shredding it 30-60 minutes before turning off the slow cooker and serving.

simple and delicious. chicken broth instead of h2o makes it a more fuller soup. i do spice it a bit more, but that is personal taste. also the juice and zest of one lime, if you have it on hand. i am having a hard time not devouring it as it cooks the last little bit. smells great and taste better than that. simple simple simple. let me say it one more time. simple :D and oh so good.

I made this recipe exactly as it reads, except I didn't have banana peppers, so I just added a few shakes of red pepper flake to give it some zing.  I made the mistake of making a double batch of it the very first time making it, because of the high rating and I'm sorry I did.  Now I have a huge slow cooker full of really mediocre soup.  It's basically strips of chicken floating in spicy water with chunks of tomatoes & corn.  I'm really disappointed.

I'm going to go back through all the reviews to see what others have done to tweak it and see if this batch can be saved.

This was great! My husband even liked it, and he is picky about his soups. I used Hunts mexican tomatoes (with cilantro and rosemary) instead of regular tomatoes but otherwise followed the recipe! Will serve it again for sure.

Amazing recipe and so simple.  This soup was to die for!  Sadly, I forgot to add the corn, and I love corn.  It was good with out it, but I imagine even better with.  Also, I added green onion and a little cheese as garnish, and replaced the homemade chips with store bought to save time.  I will be making this again soon!

I LOVE this recipe! I did make a few modifications though. I used a 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes instead of 15 oz. and I omitted the 2 c. of water. I also added a 14 oz can of black beans (not drained) and the juice of 1 lime. I added 3 extra tbsp of cilantro as well.

And, instead of cooking and shredding the chicken beforehand, I just placed 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts in the pot. An hour before serving, I fished them out and shredded them and then placed them back into the pot. Delish! A family favorite!

This is always a hit with us. I don't cook the chicken first, just buy two chicken breasts with bone and skin and then shred it at the end. I serve it with tortilla chips.

One of my favorite soups ever!  I have made this several times, and it is delish!  The first time I made it, I mistakenly picked up lemon pepper frozen chicken breasts at the store instead of plain.  I used them anyway as it was all I had, and it was amazing.  Now, I usually keep some in the freezer just for this recipe, but it is still good with plain chicken as well.  The only change I make is to leave out the cilantro until the end.  I use it as a topping instead.  I sometimes add a can of black beans, too.  Following one reviewers advice, I top with cheese, avocado, a dollop of sour cream, cilantro and lime juice.  Instead of making the tortillas, I purchase a bag of the salad topper tortilla strips found in the produce section at my store.

Everyone loves it!! I tried it with and without black beans. Since i like my soups a little thicker, i definately like it better with black beans.

Amazing!  No alterations needed.  It's perfect as is.  I just suggest making your own enchilada sauce.  So Yummy!

I love this recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I didn't use a crock pot, I cooked 3 large chicken over the stove and shredded it.  I used 32 oz container of Chicken Broth and no water, added the Black Beans along with the corn. I did add a small can of rotel tomatoes which made it too hot for my husband so the next time I eliminated it.  I added 3 TB of cilantro.  Serve with garlic bread, VERY YUMMY, family loves it

I LOVE slow cooker recipes for many reasons and this one was no exception. I used all chicken broth instead of water and had some roasted Hatch chiles in the freezer so diced those and used in place of the canned green chiles.  I fixed this for company a week ago and am planning on using the recipe again this week for some other company. SO much easier entertaining when the work is done, kitchen is cleaned up and dinner is waiting in the slow cooker!

Fabulous recipe. Easy to make. My husband and I loved it! We like this type of soupy version better than the creamy version as some people have wished this was. We used chicken breasts instead of the shredded chicken, about 3 hours into cooking we took the chicken out and shredded it and put it back in to cook with the can of corn we used instead of the package (since the corn was fully cooked just needed to heat up). At that point it was pretty spicy, even he said so and he’s a spicy kind of guy! But an hour and a half of cooking more the flavor mellowed slightly and it turned out delicious. With cheddar cheese, sour cream, avocado, and the tortilla pieces it is definitely something I would make again.
Differences: 
--I used 1 can a broth and 1 cup of water since there was liquid from all the other cans and it was more than enough and had more flavor. 
--I did use skin on, bone in chicken which I won’t do again (it was in the freezer so I used it), it had a lot of oily fat from the skin and bones but the flavor was fantastic regardless! 
--I also would take the tomatoes and instead of just smashing I would dice them up or just use diced tomatoes because after 4.5 hours they were still too chunky, I had to take them out and chop them up.

I've made this multiple times with small variations depending on what I had on hand.  Everyone loves it to include unexpected visitors who've stopped by.  Its simple and the flavor is delish.  Making it again for a chilly, rainy, New England day... goes great with football.

I've never had this soup outside of making it from this recipe.  Yummy yummy.  I made it for a Pot Luck and EVERYONE loved it.  It wasn't too spicy.  I brought along some hot sauce for anyone who wanted to kick it up a notch.  And they did...almost emptied a new hot sauce bottle.  lol.  I will be making this recipe again tonight, but since I have a garden full of jalapenos I'll be using those in place of the canned green chiles instead.  :).

It was easy enough to make but I felt it lacked a lot of flavor.  Before serving I added about 1/2cup of lime juice and it helped but overall it was just okay.

Fantastic! Easy! With the left overs from the first day, I changed the soup a little, by adding light cream, and cheddar cheese, cooked it down! It was even better!

This soup is soo good!  I made it for my girlfriends at the cabin on a cool day and everyone raved not a small feat as  my gf's are amazing cooks!  I added 1 can rinsed black beans a few sliced fresh jalepenos while it cooked and after topped w/ sour cream, fresh cilantro, cheese & cubed avacado.  So filling and so easy to throw together.  My family loves it and we have it often.

Fantastic! I love Mexican food and this recipe is great. I'm from the Southwest, so I know when I find a good one. I was surprised that this tasted so good with all of the canned ingredients. I skipped the corn, but did take the other reviewers' advice and used frozen chicken breasts, I've also made it with leftover chicken, and boneless, skinless chicken thighs. 

When I'm all out of chicken broth, I just use chicken bullion cubes. I always double or triple this recipe because it doesn't last long enough for my family of 5 to have decent leftovers if I don't. 

It's a versatile recipe - I've even added rice to it. Tonight I'm going to add black beans because I have some left over, I'll update and let you know how it goes.

Shortcuts are my thing, so we too use bagged tortilla chips. I've sliced avocado in it and a dollop of sour cream, sooo good! My kids love it - even the toddlers. :-) This one is a keeper! Don't judge it til you try it!

added frozen fire roasted corn, black bean, and rice. This was a little spicy for my liking. Im not sure if it was because i blended the can of green chili peppers before adding. Just beware if u dont like spicy try adding half of a 4oz can.

4 stars for following the recipe exactly. When making changes, I liked it more. I used frozen chicken, doubled most of the spices, and added some beans. And I didn't bother with frying the tortillas - just used leftover chips I had lying around. Just use whatever is lying around, and you really can't go wrong with this one. Fresh avocado on top with cheese and tortilla chips - great for a chilly day!

I have made this several times, although I make it on the stovetop instead of the slow cooker.  I don't like chunks of tomato so I use a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the mashed whole peeled tomatoes.  I combine all of the ingrediates and cook on the stove for approx 30-45 minutes.  The tortilla strips are very good with the soup (a pizza cutter is easy to use for cutting the strips.)  When I haven't had time to make my own, I have used hearty (thick) bagged tortilla chips, which work well also.

Excellent recipe. Will make again. It definitely had the famous restaurants beat!  I wasn't thrilled about crisping up the tortilla strips at the end of my long day, so if you can plan ahead and do them a little earlier or even easier, crumble a nice brand tortilla chip (see if you can buy a bag from the local restaurant?) it's nearly the same.

Fantastic! There's nothing better than being at work and knowing that dinner is in the crock pot at home! 
This was easy and very tasty, my 9yr old son just polished off 2 bowl, he added grated cheese and tortilla chips crushed on the top! I added sour cream to the top. I had forgot to buy the corn tortilla's so I substiuted...........it has a little kick to it so you may like to cut down on the chilli seasong.
Next time I would cut the onion and tomoates smaller though so my kids couldn't see them at all, maybe the magic bullet?!
No question about it a make again!

So easy and delicious.  I used all chicken broth (instead of water) and make my own mock enchilada sauce.  Added a teaspoon of sour cream in the serving bowl...No One could stop eating it...now I have to make more as they cleaned out my crockpot!

I made this. It came out great! It had just the right amount of "heat" to it, and it was very hearty. Not really all that difficult to prepare either.

Excellent. Used 1/2 pound of chicken and one can of black beans rinsed. Will definitely make again.

I used spicy red enchilada sauce and gave it some extra zing. I also put rice in a bowl, a small handful of cheese on it, then placed the soup on top. It was delicious!

This is really fabulous.  Friends request it when I cook.  I add a can of black beans and a few dashes of Outerbridges sauce.

A little too much chicken called for but really great.  I did however use home made enchilada sauce I just couldn't bring myself to use the canned stuff.  It froze really well too.

A little bland - not enough cumin.  I grew up in San Diego and this soup doesn't taste anything like the classic chicken tortilla soup I'm used to.

My guests raved over this.  I doubled the recipe in order to serve 6 grown young men.  Just enough leftover for my lunch today!  

Two swaps, skipped the corn as I didn't have any and added two tablespoons Sriracha, which I do to anything containing some spice.  I must answer when the rooster crows.

This is wonderful!  Super easy to make and I made it easier by using 2 TBS minced dried onion instead of chopping a fresh one (I've got strep throat and this was what I could handle today).  Also used 32oz chix broth and no water.  I also didn't use any chicken parts in it and it still tasted great!  My husband and I both love it.  Have to get a bigger crockpot to make a bigger batch!

Wonderful recipe, and very healthy and easy. My husband loves it. I add a can of black beans. I don't make my own tortilla strips. Store-bought chips are easier and still taste great. Try buying tortilla chips with a hint of lime. I cook the chicken in the crock pot first, then rinse off the fat, shred, and then make the rest of the soup.

This is sooooooooooooo yummy!  I put my chicken in the crock pot uncooked and then shredded it later.  I made the corn tortillas like it said and it was worth it.  I added the soup in my bowl, the tortilla strips, cheese, avocado, and sour cream.  I love this recipe and I can not wait to make it again.

The soup was very good.  My son in law said it had a "whang" to it yet it wasn't too spicy.  My husband ate two bowls of it.  He tried crackers with one bowl and tortilla chips with the other.  We all liked this soup!

Loved it, with the following changes: added a can of kidney beans (rinsed and drained), used one less cup of water (too liquidy otherwise), and threw in frozen breasts as others have suggested and shredded them about 3 1/2 hours into the cooking.  My family ate it all up!

I will give this recipe 5 stars with some changes that I made.  I never just add water when a recipe calls for it instead I add broth.  So I added chicken broth in replace of the water + yhr chicken broth it called for.  I doubled all the spices and added some jalepenos.  I saw some reviews complaining about it being too liquidy so at the end I added 1 cup of slow cook rice and also some frejoles negros (black beans) which added more substance.  It turned out amazing!  I topped it with crushed tortilla chips, shredded mexican cheese mix, green onions, sour cream, and cut up avocadoes.  Thanks it was easy to make and delicious!

This soup is absolutely delicious.  Next time I will use Rotelle tomatoes as well as the green chilis.  We like it spicy.  Other than that 6 stars.  Thanks so much for your wonderful recipes.

Delicious. I altered slightly for our family and cut back on the corn and I added roasted yellow squash for a yellow veg. It was great. Served this with lots of sides to add to soup...sour cream, sliced avocado, diced tomatoes, and cheese so everyone could dress it to their liking. It's great plain or dolled up.

This was delicious.  The only things I changed was that I added a can of black beans, used all chicken broth instead of any water, and I put the whole chicken breasts in and at the end took them out and shredded and added back into the soup.  Really, really tasty!!

Easy and delicious!  I think the secret is the enchilada sauce?
Thanks to the reviewers, I put the chicken breasts in uncooked.  When I got home, I took them out and shredded them, then put them back in with the frozen corn until dinner time (about an hour more).
I had also added fresh tomatoes and a can each of kidney and black beans (next time I might even add more beans).
You could also add chopped zucchini or grated carrots.  Such a healthy, filling, fun treat for dinner - the kids loved it!
Thank you for a great recipe!

My very picky husband loves this soup. I love it as well.  I let the chicken cook in the crock pot with the other ingredients and it turns out great every time.

I loved this in every way, as did our football game party guests. The only complaint was that I didn't make enough for everyone to have seconds! I used rotisserie chicken -- so easy. Serve cilantro on the side as an add-in/garnish for those who don't like the taste.

Loved this soup!  Dump all ingredients in a crockpot and go ... perfect kind of recipe in our busy household.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes, a can of shoepeg corn (didn't have frozen on hand), and skipped the cilantro.  Served with bowls of crushed up Tostitoes. sour cream, and shredded cheese so everyone could add what they wanted (of course, I used all 3 ... delicious!)  Super easy!  Will definitely make again.

It is fast, easy and great tasting.  I also added a can of black beans and I also added a 4oz can of chopped jalapeno (if you like extra bite to it). I found a new cheese out, shredded green/red jalapeno jack cheese. Excellant choice. I loved it.

This is one of my favorites for cold weather time. I've made this at least since last year and it is a favorite. I brought it to a church party once and it was a success and there were no leftovers. The only thing I change is to add a can of black beans and use diced tomatoes instead of crushed.

This was so good.  A little too salty for me though.  Next time I will use half the amount of salt.  Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful soup!  Super easy and as close as I've been able to come to authentic restaurant style tortilla soup.  After cooking, I garnish with some fresh chopped avocado, monterey jack cheese and crushed tortilla chips.  Delish!

I made this for the first time yesterday for my boyfriends birthday. He originally wanted me to get the recipe from his ex's mom. Being the amazing GF I am, I attempted to get it from her. With no luck I went searching for a recipe, and found this one. I made a few changes. (used all broth no water, added black beans, added a little more minced garlic, and swapped out the tomato's and chilis for rotel.) I am a novice cooker. But this recipe was easy. And in his own words. " It tops the ex mother in laws." One word SUCCESS.

Delish! I made this thinking we would have a bunch of leftovers. However, my parents and brother came over and they practically licked the crock pot clean. So needless to say, there are no left overs. 
I cooked the chicken for 3 hours in the crock pot and then pulled it out to shred then added back to the mix. It made it easier to not have to cook first. Turned out excellent! Garnished with some shredded cheese, fresh avocado and sour cream. YUM!

This turned out so well! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I used chicken broth instead of water and my tortilla strips came didn't come out as crunchy as I expected.  It's definitely a keeper.

I plopped this into the crockpot before soccer practice and came home to yummy.  The best part about this soup - besides how stinking good it was - is that we ate it ALL week without getting sick of it.  I did add a can of drained black beans, used fresh/vs frozen corn and added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper b/c hubby loves a lot of spice.  Kids don't however, but sour-cream, avocados, cheese and fresh tomatoes took the spice away for them - and they ate it as well.  Perfect busy night food!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this.  I followed the recipes as read, using dried cilantro at first.   I decided 1 tbsp was too much of the dried cilantro so I scooped a bit out and added fresh cilantro later in cooking.  I also chose to added 1 small jalapeno, chopped up, for a little extra heat.  Adding a little jack cheese and a small scoop of sour cream before serving made this amazing.  I didn't even bother with the tortilla chips.

My fiance and I loved this! We followed the recipe but made a few changes - instead of a canned whole tomato, we got two smaller cans of RoTel diced tomatoes and green peppers. We also added in a can of black beans and a lot of paprika and cayenne for heat (we love spicy food!)

Topping this with more fresh cilantro, avocado chunks, the tortilla strips, and colby jack cheese, and it was glorious. It tastes better than most of the tortilla soups we've had in restaurants, with the added bonus of homemade satisfaction. 

Next time we'll add in another can of the tomato chunks with peppers, and get a tiny thing of sour cream as a topper. We might also follow the suggestion presented by other people - using two cans of chicken broth rather than water. 

All in all, this is a great recipe. For just the two of us, it made a ton of leftovers. This would be a great recipe to bring to a pot luck or to share!

This recipe is great! My family likes a thicker soup, so I don't add the water and it comes out just right. I also add chopped green pepper. I've also made this a few times with BBQ sauce instead of the enchilada sauce and added a can of pinto and black beans to make BBQ chicken chili!

This was a good easy to follow recipe. I tweaked it a little bit. I added velveeta cheese to it. My family loved it. It is one of the best chicken tortilla soup we have ever tried. Try it and you'll see.

Amazing!  One of the best soups I've ever made and I have made A LOT of soups.  I added a can of corn and can of black beans.  Served with scoop of sour cream, shredded cheddar and fresh cilantro on top.  So yummy!

Fantastic recipe! I made this for my husband and inlaws and they all loved it. I did change a couple of things: I used hominy instead of corn, diced tomatoes instead of whole, and I used El Pato and tomato sauce in place of the enchilada sauce (to give a brighter, fresher tomato tast). I have only made this twice and I am already getting recipe requsts from people who have only heard how good it is from my mother in law!  This soup also freezes very well.  I just put it into individual serving sizes, froze, then microwaved for a few minutes when ready to eat.

Yummy. I am trying to eat light so the soup is awesome and tasty. My husband and son loved it also with cheese on top and a side of cornbread.

this was only an OK recipe.  after trying it the first night, i reheated it and in a separate pan made a rue and added lots of milk and cheddar cheese until it was smooth, and then added that into the tortilla soup to make it creamy.

This soup was amazing.  My 4 and 2 year old even loved it, they ate 2 bowls!!  I used frozen chicken and shredded it at the end and did not use cilantro because I do not like it.  It was better than any tortilla soup I have had at any resturant.  I will definately make this again but next time I think I might add some black beans.  We also put shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips in it.  But it was great just by itself.

I used uncooked chicken, cut into pieces, used diced canned tomatoes, all chix broth instead of water, and omitted the bay leaf (i was out), after 8 hours on low heat the soup was cooked but felt the consistency was a little thin and the spice overwhelming,  added Mexican blend shredded cheese to taste (i didn't measure, just added a little, stirred, tasted, i would guess between 1-2 cups in total) Perfection! Better than restaurant and very close to authentic, i actually like this version better than authentic because there is more chix and the addition of cheese and sour cream garnish.

I had to modify it to the point it no longer resembles that original recipe. First off, definitely add a squeeze of lime prior to cooking. Since most of ingredients are canned, I was wary of the salt content - l used 'no salt added' tomatoes and homemade enchilada sauce. Next, I doubled the onions (yellow) and doubled the garlic and spices. I added one packet of Sazon Goya w/ Safron. I used 1/2 fresh Jalapeno (chopped) instead of canned chilies. Added Hominy instead of corn per another user's suggestion on here. 

Also, I browned onions and garlic in olive oil before adding to crock pot due to habit.

I didn't use a crockpot.  Also, I used chicken tenders that were partially thawed.  I cut the chicken tenders into small pieces.  I put the chopped onion, corn, chicken, a diced yellow bell pepper,chicken broth and water into the pot and boiled on low for 15 minutes.  Then I added all the other ingredients and brought back to a boil and then simmered on medium low for 20 minutes. I serve with tortilla chips and a grated mexican blend of cheese.  This is tasty a tasty soup that I will make again.

Yum!  I've made this recipe with breasts and boneless thighs - both are great.  I toss them into the pot, uncooked, with everything else and shred the chicken at the end.  I also use all chicken broth instead of water.

This was awesome! My family is very picky, but everyone of them loved it. The only thing I did differently was that I used a "hot" enchilada sauce instead of mild. It gave the soup a slight kick, and it was great!

Love love love, have made once a week or so since I got the recipe from a friend.  Like some others, I used all chicken broth instead of broth and water.  I also added some shredded cheese.  Definitely a regular in our rotation.

Delicious!  I put the chicken in raw and just shred it up with a fork when I got home from work (~9 hours later). I also added black beans as some other reviewers suggested.  The leftovers tasted even better! :)

This was great. I used 2 cubanelle peppers instead of canned as another recipe suggested. I also used a 28 oz can of tomatoes. Poored soup over bite sized pieces of montery jack cheese and served with cheese quesadillas - WONDERFUL!!

AWESOME! Cooked it for the first time last night and can't wait to share it with family and friends. Instead of getting frozen corn, I just got it from a can. Before serving I added white rice to the bowl and topped avocado slices and ate with homemade chips.

This couldn't be easier OR yummier!  It has become a cold-weather standard and family favorite.  I don't change a thing!

I served this at my book club dinner this month and everyone loved it!  I had read the reviews left by others and added 3/4 cup of cooked brown rice and a can of black beans.

YUM! My house smelled so good while this was cooking!  I made two exceptions, I put two raw skinless chicken breasts instead of pre cooked shredded chicken and I used store bought tortilla strips.  It saved two steps, but did not alter the flavor one bit.  This is a very delicious soup and oh so easy.  Thank you so much!!!

Like others I cooked the chicken breast whole and shredded later in the process (allowed at least 1.5 hrs to absorb flavors after shred).  Added additional salt and Cayenne seasoning for heat.  Very big hit, everyone LOVED this soup.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe! The only omission we make is to leave out the cilantro because I don't like it.  We garnish with mild cheddar cheese, fresh avocado and tortilla strips.  The first time we tried the recipe, I baked my own tortilla strips.  The next time around I ended up using store bought strips to save some time.  Both worked just fine.  We'll definitely make this again in the near future.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could!!!!  I threw frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot, threw all the other stuff into it (minus cilantro), turned it on high. Cooked until the chicken was done, took the chicken out and shredded it and threw it back in and let it cook another hour.  Served with lime flavored tortilla chips. MMM MMMM MMMMMMMMMM.

I have to be honest I had never even tried chicken tortilla soup until I went to a restaurant a few years back. Ever since that trip I had been trying to find a great recipe for it and this one is a 5 star winner! I have had many ask me for my recipe and this is the one! Thank you for sharing! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

This recipe is ok.  I think it could use more flavor. Maybe more salt or chili powder or garlic, or all three.  I did add black beans as others had suggested, but it only added a little to the overall effect.   I had to add a dollop of sour cream to each serving to make it better, but still not amazing.

Delicious and easy! I didn't have frozen corn so I used canned. I actually cooked a whole chicken and shredded the meat then added everything together in crockpot. yea, I know it's more work but either way it was YUMMY! I also sliced the tortillas then tossed them with a little oil insted of the otehr way and they turned out nice and crispy!

Wonderful recipe! My fiance and I love it! Only thing I did differently was add more of each seasoning (I'm a heavy seasoner) and cut down on the corn and substitute some minute rice. I've made this recipe several times and it's always gone in just a few days. I serve it with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheese on top. Delicious! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This is AMAZING.  I've made it twice now, and I added one extra can of broth to make it a bit more soupy.  My family loves this and my mother-in-law even said it was the best soup she's ever had!  GASP! Will definitely be making this one often!

How can you complain with the simplicity! I sub crunched up chile lime tostito chips on top instead of using tortillas. That, green onion, and shredded cheese on top when its done make people think your a restaurantuer.

This soup is wonderful. I've made it a couple times now and everyone loves it. The only thing I do differently is to double the cilantro and I don't bother with the tortillas, we just eat it with whatever is on hand or on it's own is great too.

I was not impressed at all with this recipe. It tasted thin and lacked depth. Not sure if I did something wrong. I wished I had made chili instead, something a little more hearty.

perfect soup on a cold day. (or any other for that matter) I added flour to the enchilada sauce to thicken it up, I also added a can of black beans.   this is now a favorite in my house.

This is by far our favourite tortilla soup recipe.  The broth base is just fantastic.  I did this quick on the stove top, frozen chicken and all.  Added a can of black beans as well.  We tried it over rice, but just not as good.  You have to do the real corn tortilla's baked in the oven, the chips just won't do and seriously alter the taste.  Also topped with a wedge of fresh lime, cheddar, avocado, diced tomato, fresh cilantro and the chips!!  Amazing flavour...oh the only thing I did change was doubling the liquid (broth no water and enchilada and spices) The 1st night it had too much chicken, beans, etc. with the liquid doubled it was perfect.

YUM!  Perfect soup for a cool day.  I omitted the onion and added black beans, and it was super good!  I love that this recipe doesn't call for packets of ranch seasoning or anything, because I like to be able to control the spices and salt in a dish, and this recipe's seasonings are perfect.  Definitely a keeper.

Great soup! I added slightly more enchilada sauce to give it more flavor. Maybe next time i'll add some beans, and maybe season the chicken when it's cooked ahead of time.

This soup is amazing! I love how I can just dump it in the crock pot and be done with it.  Made a couple of changes just based on what I had in the cabinets. Used Rotel tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes and used taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce, otherwise I made it exactly as stated.  When done I topped it with mozzarella cheese...DELICIOUS! Hubby absolutely loved and devoured the leftovers the following days...he even added pico de gallo for a little extra kick.

UPDATE: I've been using this recipe for years now, love it! I share it with everyone I know. Definitely add black beans and we use the salad topping tortilla chips to give added color on top.

I added a can of cheddar cheese soup for more substance and used diced jalapenos instead of the green chiles.  EXCELLENT, but very spicy!  Will definitely make again.

Made this per the recipe except I did add a can of black beans and didn't have a bay leaf so I left that out.   My husband and very picky 4 year old both loved it!  Made a ton of soup, too.

Great recipe with a few modifications. I cooked the chicken & shredded first before putting in slow cooker. Added black beans, extra 1/4 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of oregano & increased pepper to taste. Used only 3/4 cup of water & added 1 tsp of chicken flavor bouillon. Didnt use corn tortillas, just tortilla chips on top, with cheese & sour cream! cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours and was great! definitely a keeper!!!

Was a little thin, so I added a mixture of flour and milk (2 pts milk, 1 pt. flour) towards the end to thicken the soup. Adding black beans and rice thickens the soup up nicely, too!

This was fabulous and SUPER easy to make.  I wish all meals were so easy.  If you want to make it even easier, buy prepackaged tortilla strips.  HOWEVER,  I wouldn't have liked this as much if we hadn't added a ton of cheddar cheese and tortilla strips on top.  Without the cheese mixed with the tortilla strips, although tasty it was kinda boring and bland after two bites.  I give it 4 stars because it is so easy for a great tasting meal, but nothing to write home about.

This recipe has become a staple in my house.  Everyone loves it, and it's easy.  I don't actually use a slow cooker, I throw everything together in a big pot, so fast!  After I scoop it into a bowl, I add some tortialls chips, cheese and maybe some avocado slices.  Good stuff!!

to quote my 18 year old son 'mom, you know the only problem with this soup, is that you havent made it sooner' LOL - I added a dollop of sour cream, some shredded cheese, and some southwest style tortilla strips (pre packaged, meant to be sprinkled on salads) - it was a super simple soup to put together, and its ready when you are!

A big hit with my family on a cool fall weekend.  I served tortilla chips instead of making my own strips on a busy day.  Absolute Mexican Cornbread and a fruit bowl alongside made a meal that really hit the spot.

This is an excellent soup.  I have made it twice now and each time it was fab!  Mine always turns out a bit spicy but that is how we like it.  Just depends on how much heat is in the enchilada sauce.  I did as others suggested and put my frozen chicken right in the pot to cook.  Shredded it just before serving.  This makes it so easy.  Dump all ingredients in the pot and go.  Also added black beans as other suggest.  Serve with sour cream, avocado, crushed corn chips and fresh cilantro.

We made this tonight.  It's great, but I dropped it a star because all of the alterations we made to it.  I still think it would be good the way it is, though.  I didn't use the crockpot, just made it at dinner time & it didn't take long at all.  As another poster said, it's all precooked ingredients, so the slowcooker isn't necessary but handy to have as an option.   Anyway, I used chicken stock I made from scratch, a can of diced tomatoes, a can of black beans and some frozen corn.  I didn't use enchilada sauce but instead minced some garlic and onion and threw it in, along with cumin and oregano.  Right before serving, I added the juice of a lime.  I put little bowls of "add ons", like diced avocado, baked tortilla strips, lime slices, shredded chicken, queso fresco, diced onion and cilantro.  And of course a bottle of hot sauce.  Everyone dressed up their own soup, which my kids were excited about.  It was so delicious, I had 2 bowls and about am about to burst.

Fantastic!  I added black beans as well, and a bit of spinach only b/c it was about to go bad.  I did not add any extra salt b/c the broth has salt.  I added about 3 cups more water than it called for, so there would be more.  GREAT RECIPE, easy and tastes great.

I love this recipe! It's quick and easy to make. I have yet to find a better tasting soup at a Mexican restaurant. I added 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes instead of the whole peeled tomatoes. I also added 4 cups of chicken broth and one cup of water to give it more of a soup base. Like the other cooks I cooked the chicken breast in the slow-cooker, bone in, skin on, and removed the bone and skin, then shredded it after about 4 hours of cooking time. I also added chili flakes along with the chili powder because I like it spicy! I also left out the corn because I don't really fancy corn. Thanks for the fun recipe!

Excellent blend of flavors. I added a cube of chicken bullion just to give it a bit more flavor as I cooked it. Loved it and took it to work for lunch throughout the week. Flavors blended even more!

Everyone loved it and even asked for the recipe :)  I like this a lot, especially with the tortillas mixed in there at the last minute, but I thought it called for way too much onion (texture wise, but taste was good).  In my opinion, the enchilada sauce is what gives it the main pop in flavor, so choose a really good sauce.

Very good and easy too.  I didn't bother cooking the chicken first--just dropped in frozen chicken breasts and shredded when they were done.  I also just used regular tortilla chips to top the soup.  Bf and our visitors seemed to enjoy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great soup!  Very quick and easy.  I used Mission tortilla Strips instead of making my own.

This soup was so tasty and flavourful! There is very little prep work (aside from the chicken) which makes it an easy work week one to make.   The soup is filling because it has the chicken included which isn't typical of tortilla soup so this makes it more of a meal which I liked.   I've saved this recipe and will definitely be making it again. Thank you for sharing!!!!

FANTASTIC!!!! Made this last night fro dinner and it was a hit. I did make a few changes...I used frozen chicken breast (threw it in the slow cooker that way), did not use canned chilies but 1 large chopped poblano chili, 1 can of black beans that I rinsed before using and then half way through cooking I added 6 corn tortillas that I tore up. This gave the soup a little thickness that I like. I am certainly making this again!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous.  I did change it just a bit.  I added 2 bags of frozen corn and I also added one can of white beans.  I just threw everything into the crock pot including the uncooked chicken breasts about 1 1/2 pounds and I let it cook all day.  Then I just broke up the chicken.  It was absolutely the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever tasted.  When I served it I put the tortillas on top and a dollup of soup creme.  Fabulous!!  And the easiest thing to make ever.  People will think you fussed and the crock pot did all the work while I was at work.  A++++

Like many others have said - this is a great recipe!  My husband and his family LOVED it.  I also added the black beans, and I thought that was a nice way to add some more protein - thank you for the recipe!

I added a twist to this I used diced tomatoes (hunts with onion and garlic added to it) I added the juice from half a lemon and half a lime then added black beans and some fresh avocado once finished, and cooked it on my stove top on med-high heat for 45 mins.  It tastes amazing and is a huge hit with everyone!!

I have made this several times and it is always a big hit! I used diced tomotoes instead of the whole tomatoes and omitted the corn, but kept the majority of the recipe the same.

This recipe is delicious and very easy! I added a little mexican cheese to the top when I served it. This is among the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had and is perfect for when you don't have time in the evening to cook.

FANTASTIC!  I even used leftover chicken breasts from containers in the fridge and shredded them at the end of cooking time.  SO easy and delicious!  Altho spicier than I was prepared for, this was a hit with even the pickiest eater in the house.  My husband ate two bowls, said he was gorging himself and couldn't stop :)  A new favorite recipe in my home!  Thanks for sharing!

Really good soup. I did not add the enchilada sauce, onions, limes or cilantro b/c I didn't have any of those ingredients and I still liked it. Next time though, I will make sure I have those items on hand and add black beans.

Excellent recipe. I was short on time and cooked the recipe on the stovetop rather than in a slow cooker. It turned out great! Family loved it!! Very flavorful and just the right amount of spice. Really liked the tortilla strips.

The entire family loved it! I did however make some minor adjustments to the recipe. I didn't cook it in a croc pot. I added an additional can of diced tomatoes and chiles, a can of black beans, another can of corn, and half a container of cream cheese to thicken it up! It turned out delicious and only took about hrs. total to prepare and cook!

This soup is incredible and just perfect as written. I'm thinking about having a second bowl for dessert!  In order to be able to throw it in the crock pot and go, I cooked the chicken the day before by boiling it in chicken broth and then shredded it.  I also pre-chopped the onions and garlic.  In the morning, I just put all the ingredients into the crock pot (had to quickly chop the cilantro) and went on with my day.

This was OK. We put some shredded mexican cheese and sour cream on top of it. My husband thought that it might be better with black beans and maybe some hot sauce. It needed a little bit more flavor in our opinion, but we couldn't figure out what to add.

I didn't have time to do this in a slow cooker so I modified it by using shredded rotisserie chicken and canned corn. I just put everything in a soup pot on the stove, brought it to a boil and then reduced the heat and let it simmer for about 15 minutes. It was delicious and super easy. Definitely going to be a repeat.

DO NOT use water.  Use cream of chicken instead.  Add red pepper or a packet of ranch dressing to give it some flavor- recipe is very bland otherwise.

My sister said it tasted like I had used all "fresh" ingredients.  I used 5 frozen chicken breasts and shredded them a few hours before serving.  I had some leftover rice that I put out as well, and everyone really liked the soup with the rice together.  It also stretched the soup and we had more leftover for the next day!

A great soup, and so simple!  Full of flavor; my whole family loved it.  I used a rotisserie chicken to cut back on time. Definitely follow the suggestion to garnish with grated cheddar, chopped cilantro and fresh lime juice.

This was great! I put 2 frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts in, poured everything else over, and added a can of black beans (rinsed & drained). 8 hours later, soup! I ladled into bowls, squeezed a bit of lime juice, sprinkled a little grated cheese, and added diced avocado, a little sour cream, and the tortilla strips. Soooooo goooood! Even my kids liked it, including the one who will only eat one brand of mac n cheese. My 10 year old ate a whole bowl and then THANKED ME for the soup.

Delicious! I added extra garlic (as always) and homemade chicken broth from chicken soup I happened to have, but it was great! We added sharp cheddar and fat free sour cream on top and rice to put in and it came out great! The following day I forgot the rice and didn't notice, but my husband and his brother liked the extra heartiness.

For soup that is richer but still healthy, add 1 can (15oz.) cream of corn. This makes a world of difference! Also I use mexican style tomatoes. Great recipe otherwise!

This was a great, easy, fast recipe. My husband and I added more cumin, chili powder, and onions. We also threw in some diced jalapeno and serrano peppers. We also threw in some corn, rice, and extra veggies in order to make the soup go further. We served it with tortilla chips, limes, and avocados.

Very good soup and super easy to make, I did cut the chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon and it was still a bit spicy for our taste. Will make this again!

This was soooo yummy! I left out the corn, because I don't like it. And, I also added some leftover rice in the last hour. It was delicious!

Delicious and easy soup!! I used a whole chicken, put it in at the beginning, and let it cook on low for about 4 hours. Then I shredded it about an hour before serving, so it had a very good flavor! I added additional amounts of the chili powder and hot sauce, and we actually found it not spicy enough, so next time I will make it spicier! One note though, do not taste this before it has had time to cook and the flavors have blended, because the taste when you first put all the ingredients together is VERY different (in a good way!) from the taste of it after it simmers together! Check for flavor about an hour before you serve it, and make any additions to spices and such then! YUM YUM YUM, can't wait to make this soup again!

This was very easy and very tasty! I used packaged white corn tortillas and substituted a can of fire-roasted tomatoes for the whole tomates. Also added a dash of hot sauce. Will defintely make again!

The soup was good, but it was nothing like tortilla soup. Wayyyyy to watery and not the amount of flavor you expect from tortilla soup.

Followed it pretty much by the recipe but used jalapeno peppers roasted in olive oil and 4 Cups chicken broth rather than the 2 Cups water and 1 can chicken broth.  Very good soup!  Highly recommend!

We enjoyed this soup. Next time I'll add the salt at the end, if needed. The canned ingredients I used must have had a lot of salt in them! Delicious with tortilla chips, sour cream and cheese.

I added more spices (red pepper flakes, more cumin, chili powder) and black beans.  I served this at a work potluck with some crispy corn tostada shells I picked up at the local discount grocery store. I got many compliments on the flavor.

I would give this recipe more stars if I could... I made it for a fiesta in Spanish Class.... Everyone that tried it loved it.... and the whole class room smelled great as it cooked there all day... I like the homemade tortilla chips but I am sure you could use store boughten chips if you were short on time... great recipe... and to make things better my spanish teacher said it tasted pretty authentic :)

My family loved this soup! I used homemade chicken stock (put it in frozen b/c I forgot I had it) and added a can of drained/rinsed black beans. Also, I threw in 2 good sized frozen chicken breasts and shredded them after a few hours as someone else suggested. So easy and so good! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the most versatile soup.  I have made it with smoked meat before.  I forget the cilantro a lot.  The basics for this one just work and you can always just use something similar from your pantry, I've done that quite a few times too.  I also have used just store bought tortilla chips instead of the baked corn tortillas.  I give this a high rating for its versatility and its taste is great.  Hope this helps.

Great easy recipe!  I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store and it turned out fabulous.  The whole family loved it.  I also did what the others suggested and used bagged tortilla chips.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Very good, very easy, and easily modified to suit your own tastes.  I cut raw chicken breasts into large chunks and put in at the beginning, shredded shortly before serving.  Per another reviewer, used 1 can Rotel 'cilantro & lime' flavor and 1 can Rotel 'Hot' (instead of separate tomatoes and green chili peppers), and added a can of black beans (undrained).  Used about 16 oz chicken broth and no water, and added about 3 Tbsp cilantro shortly before serving.  I find most soups just get better and better the longer they cook, so I cooked this on High for almost 10 hours and it was delicious.  Served with plain non-fat yogurt and a bit of lime juice. Bought chips would be fine, but the homemade are better. Thinking about adding okra next time, as this will become a regular at my house.  It would also be good for my vegetarian friends and family if I use veggie broth and eliminate the chicken.

This soup is delicious! I needed a recipe to get back into using my crock pot again and this one sounded amazing. I followed it pretty much as it reads, except that I added a can of drained black beans. I also put in two defrosted chicken breasts and then shredded them after about three hours. My husband and son both loved it! My two year old actually licked the bowl and ate every bit of it. For him, this is a very rare thing! Thanks for  a great recipe that I will definately make regularly for my family!

This is a super easy dish and it is a winner every time. I suggest putting thawed uncooked chicken breasts in the soup, removing the cooked meat before serving to shred--saves you a step. I even use left over chicken from other meals to make this. It's a consistent winner. Adding black beans is nice, too. Serve with sour cream and shredded cheese.

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make and not time consuming at all. I throw in all the ingredients in the morning and by the afternoon it's ready. I've made it twice already. I like to use the rotiserrie chicken from costco and I like to add a package of powder enchilada sauce in addition to the can of enchilada sauce. I also like to squeeze the juice of one lime into an hour before I serve it. I like to use the Rotel tomatoes with chile pepper in a can I found at our grocery store. I will make this many more times.

My kids LOVE this.  If I don't have all the ingredients, I do a bit of improvising and it always turns out great!

This is my favorite recipe for my slow cooker. It is great for when we have weekday dinner guests. Instead of using whole tomatoes that I have to mash I just use a can of crushed tomatos. And I add a can of black beans if I have them on hand too. Yummy!!

Pretty tasty.  I added a can of black beans, about 
1 1/2 cups of cooked spanish rice, 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash towards the end of the cook time (enough to cook the veggies).  I served it with some avocado slices and shredded cheddar as well.

Amazing! Just like La Madeline's, yummy! I did however, only use half the amount of cream and added more basil leaves for taste. Everything else I followed exactly. Thanks for the great recipe :)

I've been craving for a chicken tortilla soup that one of our chefs in my former hotel made and this is as good as hers! For someone that doesn't really like to cook, this was real simple and easy PLUS delicious! I'm surely making this again!

This is SOOOOOO good!  Like others, I use store-bought chips, and I cook the chicken in the slow-cooker and shred half-way through (I use chicken tenders).  It's great served with fresh avocado, cheese, and sour cream.  It really is SO good.

I used stock to replace the broth and water, very tasty!  Be aware that slow cooking does send to nullify spices, so dont worry about the amount of chilli your putting in, itll mild out a bit, converslyl if you like your food hot add some more half hour before serving...

I took the advice of many of the reviews.  No added salt, used a can of chicken broth instead of cubes. It turned out amazing! We usually don't make it through leftovers in our house, this was all gone by the next day!

This is a very good tortilla soup recipe. I've made it with the slow cooker, as well as the stove top and it comes out delicious every time. I serve with a side of tortilla chips, sour cream, Monterrey jack cheese, limes, and avocado cubes. Even my finicky mother loves this recipe! :)

Me and my family love this soup!  I follow the recipe as directed but add a spoon full of sour cream and some avocados when served.  Also I just use tortilla chips instead of make strips but just out of ease.  GREAT RECIPES!

This has become our new favorite soup! Like others suggested, I also substituted a can of Rotel for the tomatoes and chiles, added black beans, used extra chicken broth instead of the water, and went a little heavy on the spices. Definitely add a few crumbled up tortilla chips and chunks of avocado to add even more delicious flavor. This soup has INCREDIBLE flavor!

We thought this was delicious. We did think it was a little mild for our taste-next time I'll probably use some Mexican flavored diced tomatoes and use spicy enchilada sauce. We topped ours with sour cream, chopped avocados, and a little cheese. MMMm..mmmmm...good!

Absolutely delicious! So easy even a novice cook like me can't mess it up. The flavors blend well and the green chiles and chile powder really give it that kick you look for in a tortilla soup. Thanks!

excellent. i used chicken thighs, which i browned first  (this may have been unnecessary... you could try putting them in frozen as other reviewers have suggested) and shredded towards the end. i also used tortilla chips instead of tortillas. i omitted the chiles. i served this with cheddar, avocado, lime juice, and sour cream. so good!

This soup was delicious....the only change I made was to use a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the 15 oz can of whole peeled.....loved how the crisp tortillas get kinda mushy in the soup....lol....very tasty....served with a lil cheese and low fat sour cream. Love the easy crockpot recipes!!!  Will make again!

Very good, easy to make and great for the freezer.  I doubled the recipe and then put leftovers in the freezer for times when a hot bowl of soup is the order of the day and I am too lazy to cook.

I put in just a half a clove of garlic (garlic isn't my thing) and did the two cans of chicken broth instead of water (as someone suggested). I served this with homemade quesadillas on the side, and it was great!

SO yummy! Only changes I made were: Cooked the chicken first in a can of ckn broth and 1/2 packet of taco seasoning. Added smoked paprika only used about 3/4 of the can of green chilis 1 8oz can of tomato paste (only cuz the chilis made it spicy and kev's not to crazy bout spicy stuffs!) used Kosher salt instead of regular salt and used cilantro flakes instead of fresh (but only cuz I forgot it at the store)  Served with cheese and a dallop of sour cream and OMG had like 4 bowls of it today!!!!

This was delicious! I gave it 5 stars because my husband and kids ate it and even ate the leftovers the next day!  I was worried this wouldn't taste right because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but the flavor was outstanding. I think it was because of the enchilada sauce! I did not cook the chicken beforehand.  I used 6 chicken breasts and put them in the crockpot with all the ingredients piled on.  Another recipe called for hominy, so I used 1/2 c since I didn't have corn. Instead of the tomatoes I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce, a large box of broth (6c) and used crushed tortilla chips and cheddar cheese on top.  It needed 5 hours on HIGH for the chicken to break apart.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

this was good. I used 2 chicken breasts with bone in, 1 sm can fireroasted diced tomatoes (in place of the whole peeled tomatoes), 1 sm can RoTel Tomatoes with Green chilis(in place of the can of chpped green chilis), 1 32 oz can chicken broth ( no water) and added 1 sm can rinsed black beans. I only used about 1/2 a medium onion. I cooked on high for 4 hours. The last 1/2 hour I took out the chicken, shredded it and then put it back in. I also very finely shredded some dark chocolate in at the end to add a little depth of flavor. Used store bought chips, sliced avocado and wedges of lime. Easy, tasty and looks good, too.

Wonderful soup escpecially on a chilly day. I followed the recipe exactly but added one more garlic clove and more cilantro at the end. I recommend making your own tortilla strips shown in the recipe, delicious! The only thing I thought it could use was a little bit more of a kick spice wise. Next time I will try hot enchilada sauce and some hot sauce.

This is a fantastic recipe and it's quick and easy to boot :) The only change I made was to replace the water with a 14oz can of chicken broth and I added a can of rinsed black beans. My very picky children love it and even ask for seconds. I serve the soup with diced avocados and cheddar cheese, sometimes sour cream as well.  Thanks so much for  posting!

We added 3 dried NM red chiles and a bunch of green chile powder...it was amazing. Loved it.  We also just put tortilla chips on it...too lazy to toast our own tortillas.

Wow!  I made this exactly as described the first time around (except we cooked the fresh chicken breasts right in the slow cooker to save time) and it immediately earned raves from my family.  We tend to like our soups/stews to be hearty though so the next time we added lots more onions, garlic, and green peppers along with red peppers and black beans.  Also, due to sheer laziness we tend to just use bagged tortilla chips instead of making our own.  Very tasty and very easy to modify to your tastes.

Delicious! The first time, I made it exactly as called for (garnished with sour cream and shredded mexican blend cheese). It was perfect! The second time, I made it vegetarian by replacing chicken broth and water with just vegetable stock. I also added black beans. It was a little waterier, but still very good! NOTE: I didn't make my own strips. This dish is really amazing with store bought tortilla chips.

Great soup, we loved it. Way better than some of the restaurants I had eaten at. Great, great.  We had to do some substitutions, used fresh tomatoes, pickled chillis and my husband burned tortillas in oven, so put readymade tortilla chips.  Great one again, we loved it.

Oh, happy days.  An easy, tasty slow cooker soup (a working girl's best friend :-)  I used raw diced chicken, fire roasted tomatoes and fire roasted (thawed) frozen corn.  I cut corners at the end and topped the soup with pre-made tortilla strips (designed to top salads).  I am happy to add this soup to my quick-n-easy dinner arsenol.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times and am always very pleased with the outcome. I would agree that the beer can be skipped and just use chicken broth as a substitute. I've done it both ways and prefer the chicken broth version. Love the flavor!

Delicious and easy! Definitely something I would order at a restaurant. I used hominy instead of frozen corn and salsa instead of onion, garlic, tomato, salt.

I LOVE THIS SOUP!!! It is so full of flavor and perfect as is. I make this on cold days and it is the only soup my toddler will eat all the veggies from. I use green enchilada sauce and a can of diced tomatoes and follow the recipe to the T. I also throw the chicken in frozen and shred it about an hour before serving. Perfect perfect recipe, thanks Elena for sharing!

This is a wonderful recipe that I found easy to assemble.  The first time I prepared it I pre-cooked my chicken but after reading other reviews, I now just wash my boneless chicken breast, pat dry and place in the crockpot with the other ingredients.   I used the corn with the first batch but have substituted a can of black beans since and actually like it better!  For an extra "kick" I add a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with Habaneros!  This is not for the faint of heart!

WOW!  This is the best soup I have ever made!  I did substitute adobe chipotle chilis for green which did make it super spicy (which I like) but the flavor was great without... and it was easy to make!

Followed the directions exactly and served with cornbread.  It was very good.  Next time I'll add a can of black beans as well.

This has become one of our "go-to" slow cooker recipes that never disappoint!   Like others, I substitute the water for all chicken broth. I also substitute the smashed tomatoes with rotel mexican (has the lime and cilantro).  Lastly, I add a can of drained black beans and one diced jalapeño. Take the chicken out one hour prior,shred with two forks and then place back in the pot.  Tostitos brand lime flavored tortilla chips work well if you don't want to make your own.  A dollop of sour cream and a few dashes of Sirracha top it off nicely!

Very good - made in the crock pot with frozen chicken breast and just shredded before serving. Didn;t have corn so subbed a can of black beans. Delish!

I've made this recipe 5 times already and and I'veonly seen it two months ago. PERFECT for those times you've got a mild cold (spiciness and chicken soup? XD!) or it's just cold outside.  I keep tweaking it everytime, but this is a fantastic place to jump off into making your own version.  Thank you for taking the time to share this recipe!

Wow....fabulous, simple and healthy.  I agree...no need to pre-cook the chicken, just throw it in and shred it later.  Top w/ fresh avocado a little sour cream, shredded colby/jack cheese and tortilla strips.  What a wonderful dish:)

Wow! This is my first attempt at tortilla soup, and it turned out great. I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. I will be making it again. It's one of those dishes you can have on ingredients in your pantry and whip it up. I actually made it over a burner instead of in the slow-cooker. I served with a little sour cream on top.

This turned out excellent, I used rotisserie chicken, black beans, and added one cup of brown rice during the last two hours.  Should have made more, it was gone within in a day.

good recipe. I used low sodium chicken stock and no salt corn and no salt black beans. Also added a TBS of fresh squeezed lime juice. And didn't add the can enchilada sauce and salt to make it healthier.

To make this heartier, I followed others' suggestions and added black beans and a bag of uncooked brown rice.  In the last hour, I transferred the soup to a heavy-bottom pot, brought to rapid boil, and then covered while it simmered.  This helped shred the chicken (I started frozen) and steam the rice.  I also added garlic salt and a cilantro base (Goya).  Lastly, I used the juice of a whole lime while cooking (and then at end for garnish with avocado and fresh cilantro).

I forgot the chilis and it still turned out good.  Here are my modifications after reading others:  I used canned bay leaves, red pepper instead of chili powder, added a can of black beans, 2 cups of rice at the very end.  Also, I used 6 frozen chicken tenders and shredded them at the end.  I used 6 cloves of garlic.  I added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl and topped with tortilla chips. My aunt, husband and picky 7 year old cousin loved it!

Absolutely 5-stars in my opinion! We're not particularly fond of really spicy foods so I used mile enchilada sauce and mild green chiles. I also made it even one step easier by using the 'salad fixings' tortilla strips that are available in the produce dept, ready to use. It was a big hit and I'll make this one over & over!

To make a fantastic recipe even more memorable, drop a CINNAMON STICK in the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients-- sounds strange, but it's the last thing this recipe needs to make it truly amazing.

This is great! I actually didn't even use a Slow-cooker! I just let every thing simmer for abou 20 mintues. I had a 32 oz box of chicken broth so I didn't add the water and I also forgot the cilantro, but added avacado instead. Still perfect! This is a quick (no slow cooker) yummy recipe to make any time!

I'm not a huge fan of this soup and to be honest, can't compare it to something you'd get in a restaurant since I never order it but made it because my husband is a fan.  It was easy to make and overall, thought it was pretty good.  He said you could just buy tortilla chips rather than making them.  For me, with mild chiles and medium enchilada sauce, it still was setting my mouth on fire.

I doubled the recipe to freeze but there were no leftovers!  I took the suggestion of others and added black beans and all chicken broth. I also like a hearty soup so I cut up 5 corn tortillas into tiny bits and put it in during the last hour. It absorbed some of the liquid and made it heartier. Next time I'll add even more chicken broth to offset the lost liquid. Will also add more cumin and chili powder to make it spicier as my kids can handle it.  Great recipe. Will make again and again!

Based on previous reviews, I was expecting something amazing. My kids loved the soup, but my husband and I thought it was just good, not necessarily 5 star quality. I did add a can of black beans because the soup seemed kind of thin and we like hearty soups, and used only about 1 cup of water since I used the juice from the cans of everything else, except I drained and rinsed the beans before adding at the end of the cooking time.  Will make again, just not the best tortilla soup ever.

Not my favorite.  :(  It tasted very similar to the posole recipe but watered down.  I'll probably make it one more time since I picked up the ingredients.  I'll add black beans the 2nd time.  Hopefully, I'll change my mind with the next time I make it.

Topped with sour cream and cheese. Everyone loved it. Didn't have enchilada sauce so I used packaged and added water.

We had this soup last night for supper- and it was a great hit.  Incredible flavor and not too much spice.    I did add a can of drained, rinced black beans because I thought they fit the recipe.  My family started eating before I had a chance to add the tortillas, so we didn't really have tortilla soup.    It was so easy, I will make it again.

This soup is so good. I cooked my chicken in the soup then added a can of black beans once I shredded the chicken.  Make sure you give it a quick shot of lime juice when you add the cheese and tortilla chips.  I also used tortilla chips. Saves time.

This was easy and tasted great!  The only thing I did was add some extra corn, a can of black beans and a can of cannelini beans.  Just my personal tase, I like a heartier soup.  The flavor was delish.  I also threw the chicken breasts in the slow cooker still half frozen, and shredded them later about an hour before serving.  Great with a dollop of sour cream on top, some fresh cilantro and a squirt of lime.  I ran out of tortilla chips so made some plain cheese quesedillas--they went with it great as a side.  Its a keeper!!

I made it with 3 frozen skinless chicken breasts, no water only chicken broth and I used a whole 16oz bag of frozen corn. Threw everything in the Crockpot at night and had beautiful soup in the morning.   I serverd it at a party and everybody loved this recipe. Some with lime, sour cream and avocado at end and some without depending on their personal preference. I found that the core recipe is just a really nice balanced soup. I did not use beans because the guest of honor does not eat beans but I imagine a can of black beans would add a really nice touch.

This was a hit with my husband and three kids!  I cooked the chicken with the soup, shredded it and returned it to pot about an hour before serving.  Garnished with tortilla strips,avocado and sour cream.    Yummy!

This soup was perfect. There are a lot of ingredients, but it was easy to just throw it all in the crockpot. As recommended by another reviewer, I added a can of black beans. I topped with tortilla strips and shredded cheese. I thought I would have leftovers for work tomorrow, but we ate it all tonight!

Absolutely delicious.  This was by far the easiest, best tasting chicken tortilla soup that I have ever made.  I too, placed the chicken right in the slow cooker raw.  I used 3 boneless chicken breasts, and ended up shredding only 2 as that was plenty.  We had one on the side and it was ever so juicy.  Can't wait to make again.

Added red, green, yellow bell peppers with onion, put in cuisinart to chop along with whole peeled tomatoes. Use roasted green chili that I had in freezer then just cut with scissors into thick slices.  Came out great. Made with cornbread on this site. Really easy, can't go wrong.

Great Recipe.  I did make a few changes to it.  Instead of a 15 oz can of whole tomatos, I used a 28 oz can and added a 15 oz can off petite diced tomato.  I used 2 pounds of chicken breast, and 2 cans of chicken broth instead of water. I put a spoon full of sour cream at the end with lime juice, broken tortilla chips and shredded chedder cheese in each bowl.  My husband, who is not a soup lover, loved this soup and said it is a keeper.  My son ate 3 servings.  I served it with quesidillas.  Yummy!!

we LOVE this soup....its our favorite!  i make it every time we have family or friends coming over and i dont have to prep as much when i get off work.  i do add a can of black beans and a can of corn as well as use all chicken broth instead of water.  i throw in a couple raw chicken leg quarters, set it for 8 hours on low and when i get home i shred it and let it cook until our company comes over.  its DELICIOUS!!!

We loved the flavor of the soup.  We went with the mild sause and used only half of the chili powder so my toddlers wouldn’t complain of it being spicy (thou I love Spicy!).  I gave it four stars rather than 5 because it needs more consistency, so like others I added black beans and white rice, then delish! Yummy! Plus the extra topping made is sooo good; I never new putting a squeeze of limejuice in your bowl would give you a totally new enhanced flavor!  We made a double batch (and we too added the frozen breast in the crock pot) on Sunday and now its Thursday and I just ate the last bowel at lunch!  We love it.

I doubled the recipe, so it didn't fit in my slow cooker.  I had to transfer the ingredients to my dutch oven.  I followed the recipe, but I added 2 teaspoons of powdered chicken consomme and used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added 1 can of vegetarian refried beans.  I served the soup over rice and added grated cheese.  My family said it was a keeper.

My entire family loved this - my 7 year old said it's the best thing I ever made. I did modify it though... I didn't have enchilada sauce or chiles so I tossed in half a jar of medium Pace salsa which helped make it a bit thicker - no onion because it's already in the salsa. I did 2 cups of chicken broth and no extra water.   In a pinch - and my kids preference - multigrain tortilla chips crumbled up on top.

I pureed some rinsed navy beans and added them to the soup which made it thicker and added the protein I can't seem to get my daughter to eat.  She LOVED it and so did everyone else! YUM!

This soup was a hit and super easy to make. Thank-you for sharing! The only thing I changed was I added the frozen chicken while cooking and took out and shredded it after 4 hours. I made a double batch in hopes to have leftovers for another night and no such luck. There isn't enough left to feed all 6 of us on another night.

This is wonderful!  I took other reviewers' advice and added 1 can black beans and 1 can white beans.  No water, just more broth.  Everything else I followed exactly.  VERY yummy!  I will serve this to company next time.  :-)  Thanks so much.

Very good as a base.  I added 2 cans of black beans, and an extra can of green chilies (for a total of two).  I tripled the cumin, and doubled the cilantro.  I also tossed in some blackening seasoning, and also added 1 tsp of curry powder.  I didn't use any water, but instead used chicken broth (not low sodium).  I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.   With the changes I did, I'd give it a 5 star rating. As is, to me, it's a little bland and worthy of 4 stars.

This was a nice and easy recipe! The list of ingredients is long, but you just throw everything in together. I bought a rotissere chicken from the deli because it was already cooked, shredded it and put it in the cooker. I personally prefer creamier soups, so next time I'm going to try for a creamy soup instead of broth. Despite that personal preference, the flavor was awesome! yay me!

I cubed up a chicken breast and sauteed it in butter instead of shredding one.  I also put in a can of drained black beans.  Delicious!

Great recipe as written although I did make a couple of very minor changes.   First I used leftover chicken from Allrecipes - Roast Stick Chicken Rotisserie style, used 32oz carton chicken broth and omitted water, omitted 1 teaspoon salt as called for.  (Already a lot of sodium in the canned items) Will definitely make this again.

This soup is definitely easy, but a bit on the salty side. I like a thicker tortilla soup and I found that the frozen corn adds alot of moisture so I didn't add the 2 cups of water. I kept everything else the same. I used the leftovers from a rotisserie chicken and that added flavor.   It's a nice change from plain old soups and it's not spicy at all when you use a mild enchilada sauce.

Super easy and tasted fantastic!  Added a dollop of sour cream, some cilantro leaves and shredded cheddar on top of each bowl, then squeezed a section of lime into it. Definitely make your own corn chips!  I made 8servings for my family of four and there were no leftovers; next time I'll up the number of servings.

This soup was amazing! Made it exactly as written and it was delicious! Will definitely make this again.  I too put the raw chicken in and slow cooked it all day; shredded it later. The only thing I'm planning on doing different is adding 1.5 lbs of chicken. Also, will not use sour cream as a garnish. It wasn't needed and actually looked unappetizing in the soup.

My Family loved this I have made it 3 times this fall  I did make some changes that I felt made it a better recipe for our family!  I made the corn chips via the recipe the first and last time... the chips got very soggy once in the soup and the flavor wasn't all that great....   My Additions/ Changes: •Boil the chicken breast with2 garlic cloves and onion the night before. •Use only the chicken stock instead of using water •Add a can of Black Beans •Add an extra can of green chilies  Serve with:  Tortilla Chips Chopped cilantro Sour Cream Jalapenos

Loved this recipe! Very easy and so good!!! I added some chopped jalepeno which gave it the perfect flavor - not too bland but not super hot either. I also added some rice on the side with some lime slices. SO good.

This recipe is great for a quick, filling meal. I added a can of white beans for a little something extra. I would definitely suggest baking your own tortillas...the flavor is so much better than store bought chips. I used flour tortillas and sprinkled them with sea salt and garlic powder. yum! Will be making this again soon! :)

Great recipe and SO easy!  I added a couple sliced jalapenos to add some spice, may need to cut that down to one next time.  I also used tortilla chips to save time.  This is a keeper!

I loved it! Made a great lunch on a snowy winter day :)   I used Vegetable broth and added the chicken right before serving because my parents are both vegetarian. We had prepackaged tortilla strips in the house so that was cut out as well.  The recipe was a huge hit with my brother as well, which is definitely no small feat. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was exactly want I was looking for.  I  thawed the fr. chicken breasts in the microwave and cooked it the rest of the way in the cockpot, as many recommended. delicious.  The second time I made it I doubled it for a party.  I accidently bought one red enchilada sauce and one green enchilada sauce.  It added a great flavor and everyone loved it at the party!  I also use tortilla chips instead of making tortilla strips.  great short cut for a busy mom!

Love, Loved this recipe. It is awesome and boy does my house smell amazing. I did cook the chicken in the soup all day with it and it is so tender and juicy and absorbed all of the flavor for sure. Will defenitley make this again hands down. Thanks Elena for the wonderful warming soup recipe.

This is our go-to recipe when we want something hot and spicy on a cold winter night. If we don't have any leftover chicken, I will boil some chicken with complimentary spices, and then shred the chicken for the soup. We use more chicken broth and less water, less chiles, and add sour cream while eating. Lastly, we use Fritos instead of the tortillas. That part was too much work, and you get the corn/salty flavor added with the tortillas. I just dump it in around 10 AM, put it on low and serve it up at 6:30. Enjoy!

I've made tortilla soup several times, but my family thinks last night's recipe was the best ever.  I made a double batch and shared it with a sick friend and her family.  I've got two crock pots, so it was easy.  The kids loved the smell when they came home from school.    I didn't have all of the ingredients and made the following substitutions:  1 can of Rotel and 1/2 can tomato sauce (instead of enchilada sauce, tomatoes & cannned chilis).  I used a heaping tablespoon of chili powder because I didn't use the enchildada sauce, regular tortilla chips (although I'd like to try this idea), an extra can of chicken broth, and 2 lbs of chicken instead of one.  Didn't have frozen corn and used a can of corn instead.  Oh, I also added a can of black beans (a must!)  We served this with cheddar cheese and sour cream.  The kids always like to cool their hot soups and chili down with cheese and sour cream.  Made enough for our family of seven with several bowls of leftovers.    Great!

Delicious. First time making a soup. Very easy. I omitted the chili powder and peppers because I don't like things spicy. I also used chicken broth instead of water. Save half the cilantro to garnish soup right before eating and the flavors are wonderful! Will for sure make again!

This is so easy to make and so yummy!  I used a rotisserie chicken from wal-mart and doubled the cilantro, because we love cilantro, but other than that I followed recipe exactly! This soup reminds me of On the Border's tortilla soup! I put shredded cheese on top, a spoonful of sour cream, and instead of making the tortilla chips I just used Misson brand tortilla chip in the strips shape. I garnished this with a few avocado wedges which is delicious in the soup! I will be making this again!

WOW!!  This was soooooo easy and delicious.  I served this for my small group Christmas party and everyone enjoyed it.  I will definitely be making again.  I too just threw in frozen chicken breasts and shredded prior to serving.  This recipe is a keeper!  I think I will add more corn next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this tonight and let me tell you guys this is soooo yummy!! I didnt change anything except that I used tortilla chips instead. Warning though, if you dont like spicy omit the green chiles and chili powder, although I cant imagine it without a bit of heat. Cant wait for my hubby to try when he comes home from work.Will def make again. Thanks for the recipe Elena ;)

Absolutely delicious and super easy! This is one of the best soups I've ever made! We topped with sour cream, avocado and crushed tortilla chips.

We love this soup.  We make it at least once a month.  I substitute shredded turkey for chicken - and that is as good or even better than the chicken.  Yum.

I didn't have any corn on hand, so had to skip that ingredient. And since I didn't have canned enchilada sauce, I made my own from another recipe on this site. But something about the whole combination just didn't quite work out for me. It was a good consistency, especially with adding cheese and sour cream before serving. But it just wasn't "amazing." Maybe I'll try it again with a canned sauce and see if that makes it different, or with a different type of salsa.

I made this recipe for a party of 30 and it was really easy!  I like the option to adjust the serving size and it calculates the ingredients list for you.  Adding the frozen chicken breast to the slow cooker at the beginning was a definate time saver, chicken shreds great about 3 hours after cooking.

This is a great soup. I add fresh, diced avocado and fresh lime juice to my bowl.  I do not do the whole corn tortilla part, just crunch some tortilla chips.

This was pretty good and very easy.  The changes I made: I used frozen chicken breasts, used Rotel, onion powder, 2 c chicken broth, 1 c water, and 1 can of corn.  I also used store bought tortilla chips. When serving, I offered sour cream.

Great recipe.  As others had suggested, I added a can of black beans.  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the can of whole tomatoes so I could skip the "mashing" step.  I did not add as much water since I have a smaller crock pot.  This made it come out more like a stew, which I consider a plus.  I added a lot more than a tablespoon cilantro, and I added it near the end so it would remain fresh and green.  I ate it for a week and never got tired of it!

We had our first snow here today, and this was the perfect soup for a cold day, just absolutely excellent!  I didn't have corn or cilantro on hand, so I omitted those items.  I replaced with one can of pinto beans and one can of white hominy.  I did precook my chicken as the recipe suggested.  Also, I needed it done faster so I brought everything up to a boil on stovetop, then lowered temp to simmer for one hour.  We garnished with crushed tortilla chips, bagged variety, and shredded cheddar.  My three year old ate his entire bowl, that's rare, and we thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  It's definitely something I will make again and again, simply delish!  Thank you for such a great recipe.

Excellent!  We added a can of pinto beans and a can of Campbell's Nacho Cheese Soup.  I would recommend sauteeing the onions first, and adding cornstarch as others suggested.

I added a few frozen chicken breasts in at the begining & shredded them about an hour before serving. This recipie is amazing :)  I usually add a can of black beans & some tomatoe juice, and substitute the can of whole tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes.  Its one of the few things my whole family will eat :)

This soup was delicious and super easy.  I added the chicken in frozen, as suggested by others.  It came out so great, and fell apart just with the touch of a fork!  I chose to saute' the onions first, so they would be translucent and not crunchy in the soup. I am glad I did.  I agree with the others, the the tortilla strips were a waste.  The soup stands great on it's own, or with store bought chips if you must!  This soup will definitely be added to our short list!  YUMMY!  My husband loved it!

Defintely one of my favorite slow cooker soup recipes.  I did as other reviewers and subbed  another can of chicken broth for the water and added a can of beans, but this would have been great without the beans, too.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This is so easy and is the MOST delicious soup!  I have made it several times and only made a couple changes.  I added a can of black beans and a can of pinto beans.  I also added a can of Cream of Chicken soup to add a little creaminess.  I love to put a bunch of toppings on the table to go with the soup (sour cream, crushed tortilla chips, green onions, salsa, and limes).  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best.  I too used frozen chicken breasts and shredded them towards the end of the cooking.  It is so easy to add to this recipe too...beans, extra chiles or less to your taste.  Everyone raved about it.  Great winter meal!!  Loved it!!!

My husband, who says he doesn't care much for soup, absolutely loves this soup. It's got great flavor and we like it spicy. The homemade tortilla chips are easy to make and are sooooo good. This is definitely a winner.

I used all chicken broth, no water; added black beans & some rice.   I put the chicken breasts in the crock-pot frozen and shredded before serving. Also, I don't brush my tortillas with oil, just bake them. Garnished with cilantro, chips & sour cream. YUMMY!! This was a wonderful, easy soup!!

I really liked this soup. Turned out great though I didn't use a slow cooker. I added green onions, lime juice, and black beans to the soup. i did two cans of broth and a can and a half of sauce. It turned out really well and the whole family enjoyed it.

I've made this recipes more times than I can count. It's an absolute favorite of my family. I strongly suggest you bookmark this one for leftover turkey and turkey broth after Thanksgiving! It's delicious! Sometimes I find precooked meat tastes dry after yet another day of cooking, so I usually just stir in the shredded precooked meat in the last 15-30 minutes before we eat. We also use crushed tortilla chips - blue or yellow - instead of making our own. Also - there is enough salt from the tomatoes/enchilada sauce/broth that you can omit the 1 tsp salt and it's plenty salty. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

WOW is the only thing I can say about this recipe!!  The flavors just blended deliciously.  Took advice of others & added 2 frozen chix breasts & shredded about 1 hr before soup was done.  ALSO, HIGHLY RECOMMEND dolloping cream fraiche on top instead of sour cream..it just adds that silky, luxorious flavor that makes the soup such a winner & PERFECT for company!

This soup is so easy and so good. I highly recommend. Took advise of others and used raw chicken breasts and shredded it before serving..It basically fell apart anyway. Used store bought tortilla chips. Please don't leave out the sour cream if you can allow for the extra calories. Next time i may stir some low fat sour crean right into the soup after cooking.I dolloped mine on top of each bowl and we just ended up mixing it in anyway. Super delicious

Very easy to make and tasted good but wasn't what I was looking for. I thought of it like a Spanish style veggie soup. Not spicy at all either.

Good soup. I'm usually not a big fan of buying anything in a can so I was not sure how this would turn out since I prefer the freshest ingredients. The soup was good and I will make it again. I doubled it and the only thing I might change is not putting the corn in at the beginning. I used frozen corn and I will add it at the very end next time or used can corn.  It was SUPER EASY so I will make it exactly like the recipe again as well as taking some advice to change out the enchilada sauce with fresh peppers. I had friends that LOVED it, so maybe I am just a bit of a food snob. I enjoyed it very much though.

I really can't get over how wonderful this is!  I used a rotisserie chicken and pulled the meat off of the bone before adding it to the soup.  Store bought tortilla chips worked just fine with a dollop of sour cream when serving.  Next time I will add black beans for additional veggie yumminess.

This was really tasty. I do agree more broth should be added and I also substituted broth for water. I used a mild enchilada sauce and it was just the perfect kick. As others suggested, I added beans,kidney beans.

This was good - but I was expecting more after all of the reviews. I couldn't find the right oz specification of enchilada sauce, so mine had more than the recipe called for, and perhaps that was the problem. The recipe appealed to me because of the ease of throwing everything in the crockpot- and I MAY make it again. I may also look for another recipe. It was good, just not great.

This soup was really good.  I think more broth is needed, so I will add more liquid next time.  I used chicken thighs and cooked them in the soup and they were so flavorful and juicy.  Yum!  I also pureed the whole tomatos to make a smoother soup.  (My kids and husband will eat veggies but only if they can't see the "chunks").  Overall a very flavorful soup.

I used all chicken stock, omitting the water, and added black beans. It is perfect for flu season, the heat did wonders.  Next time I think I will try a vegetarian version because I am not a huge chicken fan.

Ok, I have to agree with everyone else, this soup is so good! I too used all chicken broth (no water) and added a package of raw chicken thighs. My boyfriend wasn't sure about it this morning when I was making it, but he loved it!! Will make again soon!

So good and easy! I followed the suggestions and used frozen chicken breasts and then shredded the chicken during the last hour or so of cook time and added a can of black beans. Delicious! Then garnished it with avocado, sour cream, shredded cheese, and of course, tortilla strips :)

This was Exceptional!!   I used the suggestions and used frozen chiken breats and it was fine.   I also added Lime-Flavored Tortilla chips (Store bought) and it was a good addition.   My only comment from my family was to add more 'stuff'...so more stuff next time..

Fantastic! I didn't use tortillas at all, and used 2 cans chicken broth, 1 (almost full)can water, scallions, can of diced tomatoes (not whole)and garbanzo beans (not chili beans - what I had onhand); tossed 3 frozen breasts in on high for 4 hours/shredded when cooked. SO yummy with a spoonful of sour cream and shredded cheese stirred in. I LOVE this flavor, but hubby won't touch it (stomach can't tolerate onions/beans - his loss : (

This was really yummy!  Very close second to my favorite soup at Avila's!  I made as the recipe called for, didn't sub anything.  I used up a store-bought rotisserie chicken I had leftover and it was great.  Wouldn't use the green chiles next time as it was too spicy for my kids, but I loved it!  Thank you for sharing.

A regular recipe in our rotation with a few modifications. I use fresh jalapenos and add in more beans plus poblano and red peppers. To make it vegetarian, I omit the chicken and add in Quorn chicken strips for the last 30 mins of cooking. Serve topped with shredded cheese, diced avocado, and baked corn tortilla strips.

This was really good! I made it for my family and I doubled the recipe. My family is not a fan of anything spicy (I am) so you might want to cut down the chili powder and chilis. This is even better the next day, it just soaks up the spices. Sooooo good and very easy to make!

This soup was very good. I was short on time, so I used a can of Costco's canned chicken (drained) and you couldn't even tell it was canned. I also added a can of black beans(drained and rinsed). Shredded Mexican cheese blend and store bought tortilla chips on top were the finishing touch. This was so quick to throw together in the morning before work. Thanks.

very good tortilla soup!  as other suggested, i put the chicken in raw and let it cook with the soup.  with about an hour to go, i shredded the chicken and added cooked brown rice - a must.  served with lime juice, chopped avacados, green onions, cilantro, cheddar, and sour cream.  my fiance loved it!

This recipie is very easy to make and stretches far. My husband is always requesting it, it is definately one of his favorites. The only thing I can  is garnish the top with the baked tortia chips along with chopped avocado, it really adds something! Enjoy... :)

Best Soup Ever! I love mexican food, and I loved this. My wife loved it and my guests loved it. I'm making it again this weekend. I put the chicken breasts in the pot, added some red pepper flakes to add a little more spice to it, and I also substituted the 2 cups of water with chicken broth as suggested by other reviewers. Grade A soup!

Just ok...I followed everyone's advice on letting the chicken cook in the crock pot. It was a little too spicy for my taste and overall just an ok soup. It was easy, but I probably wouldn't make this again.

If I could give this 7 stars I would.  I did use frozen chicken breast, let cook with liquid ingredients, shredded and added rest.  I also added 1/2 cup water with a T of cornstarch at the end.  I like my tortilla soup a bit thickened though.

This is the exact same recipe from one of my slow cooker cookbooks.  It is perfect as is, but I think I wlll try some of the ratings suggestions next time.  I just use store-bought tortilla chips for a topping along with cheddar or mexican cheese and some chopped onions, preferably Vidalias.

I must admit that this was the first thing that I made from this site and it turned out fantastic!! I agree with the others that if you have time to let it refrigerate at least a day before actually eating it (but honestly, who can wait that long!)because the flavors do meld together overnight. Like others I didn't add the water and use more chicken broth instead and used the stove instead of a slow cooker, because mine was too small for the recipe and it turn out just fine. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was very good. Excellent for a cold chilly day.  It is a little too spicy for me. Next time I will omit the green chiles.

I cheated a bit and used a store bought rotisserie chicken. I also switched the recommended amounts of water and broth, and added both rice and black beans.  Great topped with avacado and lime juice. You might kick up the spices a bit if you want some heat. Got rave reveiws on this one, and I'll definitely make it again.

Tasty, but it could use a little work.  It needs more acid (I recommend lime juice), and some cheese melted over the top goes a long way.  A bit of bacon couldn't hurt, either.

This soup packs some serious heat and tons os flavor! If you love Mexican like I do, try this one. Save yourself work and use a rotisserie chicken. Added black beans and used fritos and lots of cheddar cheese on top. MMMMM!

Amazing.  I just throw it all into a large pot and let it simmer all day.  I take out the chicken after a couple of hours and remove the skin and bones and shred the meat.  I also add a can of black beans (rinsed and drained).  It is so easy and delicious!!  It also freezes well.

I made this following the recipe exactly except that I added a can of black beans per previous suggestions. My family really enjoyed it. Even my picky-polly son ate some. We topped it with a sqeeze of lime juice and ate it with store-bought tortilla chips. It's definitely something I'll make again.

It was delicious and my first time ever making tortilla soup. I used a can of rotel which has tomatoes & green chiles as a subsitute as well has I cooked my chicken with fajita seasoning. Other than that, I left the recipe the same. In the future, I will cut the teaspoon of pepper in half because it was somewhat spicy.  Great recipe! Thanks!

My family love this soup.  I do it right on the stove instead of the crock pot.  I also use a broasted chicken and just shred it, one chicken is perfect.  It is wonderful and freezes well for a cold winter day.  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED the soup- easy and delicious! I did add 1 teaspoon oregano. Added 1 more teaspoon chili and 1/2 teaspoon extra of cumin. Also used fresh corn and a drained can of beans.  I served the chips and grated cheese on the side for individuals to put on as much as each liked on the top. My husband had thirds!!

Fantastic recipe!  I also added black beans.  I didn't have enchilada sauce so I used taco sauce instead, and it still came out great.  We also have tons of leftovers.

This was an amazing recipe, not only was it easy to make, it tasted great! It also is very economical for a family on a budget. I did add a few more things to the pot: Green onions,black beans,corn and some tomato soup. This is definitely going to be a part of our family menu!

I Loved it!!! My 3 year old ate it up and asked me to make it again sometime! BIG hit in my family! One month later a family member was taking care of my kids. They asked my son what he wanted for dinner (thinking he would say McD's) he said mommy's tortilla soup! I think it was a hit! :)lol

We liked this! I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker, shredding it after 2-3 hrs of cooking, and added a can of black beans. We ate this with a bit of sour cream, along with tortilla chips from the grocer.

This recipe is great as a starter recipe.  I do what most people do and mess with it.  Sour cream, lime, avocado, beans, extra cilantro as a garnish.  Not perfect as it is, but a great recipe for experimentation.

The best I've ever had! I did change some things though-omitted the water and used chicken broth instead, added 1 cup of minute rice (uncooked), added 1 can of drained and rinsed kidney beans, a squeeze of fresh lime juice (right before I served)and a slice of avocado! PERFECT!

I followed the directions, except subbing half of a jalepeno pepper. for the canned pepper and eliminating chili pepper, and add some leftover cooked rice.  Very spicy.  Tasted amazing when topped with mexican cheese and pan fried tortillas.  The leftovers were even better because they were not as spicy and they were thicker when reheated on the stove.  I will definitely make this again!

The whole family loved this.  I left out the cilantro and added it as another topping for everyone to add to taste.  Unfortunatly there are no leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Will have to double the recipe next time.

I used bone in chicked and browned it then added to the slow cooker on top of the other ing. when it was all done cooking I shredded the chicken. I also added black beans. For the tortillas I used whole wheat sprayed with pam then sprinkled with chili seasoning and seasoning salt then I cut them with a pizza cutter and baked the strips until they were crisp. don't forget the fresh lime juice.

Great! I added a can of black beans and 1T of a cornstarch slurry. Topped with dollop of sourcream, chopped avocados and squeezed lime on top.  I can't think of any way I would improve this recipe beyond those small things. Loved it!

I found this to be good but not fantastic. I didn't use the enchilada sauce. I put boneless skinless frozen chicken breast into the crock pot and then added the rest of the stuff. You really do not need to pre-cook the chicken. It turned out good.

This was good. Not great, but good. However, good, along with easy, quick, and cheap makes it perfect for a busy working mom of two. I actually found it sort of bland, though my husband (the wimp) thought it was quite spicy. I don't like corn, so we subbed kidney beans. I think some lime juice would make a difference, kick it up a bit, maybe some hot sauce too or jalapenos. We will keep it in our rotation.

Other than a dash of lime, & tossing in some hominy and black beans (just because we like the flavors) .....I didn't alter anything and this came out PERFECT, I'd love to make this for company.

I used bite size tortilla chips and added just enough tabasco hot sauce to give a little more heat. I will make it again...soon!

I used frozen chicken breast as others had suggested. I also added one can of black beans(rinsed)and two cups of fresh zuccini squash,diced in small pieces with seeds removed,to a double batch during the last hour of cooking. I used crushed tortilla chips on the top with fresh lime juice. This soup was so good not one drop made it to the next day.

I had a few substitutions because of what I had in my pantry (fresh jalapenos instead of canned chilies, red chili sauce instead of chili powder)and added mushrooms just because I love them! I can't wait for my mom to come home from work so I can show it off!

I used rotisserie chicken and I waited to add the frozen corn until the last 20 minutes of cooking and it was perfectly crisp instead of soggy. . .great soup!

Great basic recipe.  Of course, I did not have everything!  I did not have enchilada sauce or peppers so I used a can of tomato sauce and a cup of Pace sauce.  I was out of onion also, used celery.  Soup came out really good and tasted like any tortilla soup I had in any restaurant. Goes to show you can make any soup your own.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the easiest chicken tortilla soup recipe I've across and it is tasty!  So easy to make.  Just dump everything into the slow cooker and in 6-8 hours you have a fabulous meal.  One of my favorite dishes to make in the wintertime.

This is a winner for my family & friends.  Sometimes I make a double batch (on stovetop) because they like it so much!  I sometimes substitute crushed tomatoes for the whole ones and add a few cubes of ancho chili buillion. Or I may use one can of hot enchilada sauce and one can of medium.  It freezes well which saves time in the kitchen!

Very good!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used all chicken broth (no water) and threw some uncooked chicken breasts in at the beginning.  Almost tasted like QDoba!  Picky husband said it tasted more like veggie soup than tortilla soup, but he still liked it.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent!!!  Per others' advice, I used frozen chicken (SO easy) and store-bought tortilla chips.  I know homemade tortilla chips are better, but this made for such a quick, easy, delicious meal!  Thank you Elena!

Agreed! This is a great dish to make any time of year. I doubled the recipe and just dumped the ingredients in before work, came home and shredded the chicken and mashed up the tomatoes a little more (didn't have time in the am). Don't be shy with the seasonings. I didn't add as much water-- will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! I added beans at the end. I've also made this soup the exact same way, but instead of enchilada sauce I put BBQ sauce in for BBQ chicken chili! I prefer a thicker soup so I only used 1 cup of water.

I love this recipe.  I also add a can or 2 of black beans.  I just throw in frozen chicken beasts and this recipe always is just delicious.  This is the recipe I use when I prepare a dish for a friend in need (loss, new baby, etc)and they can just warm it up with the tortillas and have a great meal.

One of the easiest recipes, very adaptable to taste.  I add black beans for the extra protein and toppings always make it for the kids.  I make this recipe at least twice a month and never have leftovers.  I just don't get tired of it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This soup is fantastic! I too made some adjusments but only for my picky taste. I threw in frozen chicken breasts and replaced the enchilada sauce with 1 can of "El Pato" sauce. Other than that I pretty much stuck to the recipe. Too easy!

WOW! This recipe was fantastic! I decided to make this because this was my husband's favorite dish at a restaurant we used to go to when we lived in the city. So when we moved into a small town he wasn't able to eat this anymore. When I came across this recipe I decided to give it a try. My whole family loved it! My husband had more than 2 helping so that says a lot! I didn't change anything in the recipe except add the chicken frozen to the slow cooker and shredded it hours later. I served with baked corn tortillas, avacados and shredded cheese. Delish! Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper!

This needed a lot more salt than the recipe called for.  There were a few reasons for this:  Used organic strained tomatoes with no salt added, low sodium chicken stock(4 cups instead of using stock and water), no salt added drained canned corn, and sea salt.  I used a shredded rotisserie chicken, and cooked for 8 hours.  Once I added extra salt it was perfect.  I garnished with fresh cilantro, shredded cheese, blue corn tortila chips, and dollop of greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe.

AMAZING! This soup was so easy to make and was delicious! I found it spicy, but I think that may be becasue of the brand of chili powder I used. I garnished the soup with sour cream, tortilla strips and a avacado, tomato, cilantro,lemon juice and green onion salsa. This recipe is definately a keeper!

I was a little skeptical of some of the ingredients, but wow!!  This was so delicious.  I used regular tortilla chips.  Also used raw chicken breasts.  Did not add cilantro until I served it.

Very good!  Listen to other reviewers and do NOT bother to cook the chicken first.  I just put 2 big chicken breasts in the slow cooker and put everything else on top. Cooked on HIGH for 6 hours.  I shredded the cooked chicken one hour before serving  Yummy! I also added a can of drained/rinsed black beans and a teaspoon on coriander. Very tasty and very easy!

This was very tasty and very easy.  I used pre-cooked chicken from a rotisserie chicken, but next time will just put chicken breasts in to cook and shred them.  I didn't put in any corn because I didn't have any - thought I did!  I am not the biggest cilantro fan either, so I omitted that.  Also next time I think I will use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole because the chunks ended up being too big.  But the flavor was great and I really enjoyed this!

This soup is completely amazing!! YUM! So easy to make and full of flavor! I left out the corn tortillas as I do not need the extra calories. I eat very healthy and this will certainly be one my top soups to make! Thank you for submitting it!

I love this receipe!  I made it for the first time last week and my family loved it too.  This will be a regular at our house.  I only added half of the can of green chile only because I have small children and they don't like their food too spicy.

This was great!  I used diced frozen chicken breasts, and I substituted Rotel tomatoes for the canned tomatoes and chiles.  Also, I added a can of Spicy V8, which I've found improves just about any crock pot recipe.  This one's a keeper!

This soup has been made exactly as-is 3 times now, and is delicious every time. I've never seen corn in another recipe, but I think it's a great touch. I would prefer it to be a bit heartier and less brothy, but that's just a personal preference.

This was EXCELLENT. As others suggested, I put raw chicken breast in the slow cooker at the beginning.  I made a couple of other small changes: -In place of the whole peeled tomatoes, I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce because I'm weird and don't like chunks of tomatoes. -I think I used 15 oz of enchilada sauce because that's what size the can was. -I probably used more garlic than called for because I love it. -I used tostitos instead of making my own.  Really, though, this was awesome. My skeptical boyfriend loved it and I had coworkers poking their heads into the kitchenette next day asking what smelled so good when I heated it up for lunch.

Quoting my wife, "this is the best meal I've ever had...every bite is like a party of flavors." Stuck to the recipe, although I cooked the chicken in the soup instead of pre-cooking. We thought using the baked corn tortillas was much better than using tortilla chips.

This was good.  I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and threw them and a can of rinsed black beans into the soup.  I also used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of any water.  It turned out pretty good, but still felt like it was missing something.  Next time I will use the hot chilis instead of the mild and I think it will turn out better.

so good. I was short on time and had pre-cooked chicken in the freezer. I threw everything in a pot, brought it to a boil, then let it simmer 20 minutes or so...delicious.

An excellent base to get creative with. I, like others, cooked breast in crock and used all broth(no h2o). I also tossed in a can of black beans. Use fresh cilantro, dried just doesn't cut it. Very good and simple.

It was great but I just added a few fresh ingredients to lower the sodium (my son is on a low salt diet) I also added chopped cilantro while cooking and a bay leaf. I did it over the stove and it turn out great.

This soup has become a family favorite in my home. I have been making it at least once a month for 2 years now! I love the recipe as it is! I have also added rice or more chicken, we top ours with chedder cheese or pepper jack cheese for an extra kick!

Excellent! The only changes I made: used diced tomatoes with green chili and threw skinless, boneless uncooked chicken breast in at the beginning of cooking time: also added a can of black beans, rinsed. My BF RAVED about it for days! Thanks for an excellent, easy, tasty recipe!

Best recipe for tortilla soup.  Only recipe I have ever used as is.  Make it quite often, have taken it to soup parties, always a hit.  Don't change a thing.

This is the greatest chicken tortilla soup recipe in the world.  Made it for lunch today and it was the BEST.  My wife kept going on and on about it.  Seemed niether one of us could get enough.  Think I am making it again for a church social coming up.  Took me all of about 10 minutes to put it together in the crock pot b/c I used frozen chicken breast and canned corn.  It's the BEST (Can't say that enough!!).  Seasoning was perfect with a larger can of enchilada sauce.  Not too hot and not too bland.  JUST THE BEST!!!!

This was oooo easy and very flavorful.  I followed suggestions of others and used canned corn (not frozen), chicken stock (in place of the water) and added a can of black beans.  Started it on my lunch break and was ready for dinner at about 7:45.  Next time I will add a bit more of the spices to give it a little more kick.  All in all though, super tasty and ridiculously easy to make!  Added cheese, avocado, and a dallop of sour cream at teh end for presentation (and lets be honest - cuz they make everything better).  Awesome

Gee, wish I could give this SIX stars! I did add a can of drained black beans and raw chicken breasts. That way, the chicken cooks with everything else and enhances the broth you've already added, and you can shred the breasts up later after it's all done. Great crockpot recipe!

A little bland.  I ended up adding a half a packet of chili seasoning to the soup because it was just tomato flavor.  My family ate it and liked it, however I would not make it again following the recipe.

i made this soup today....it was soooo good!...i did make a couple changes due to my picky husband....i had to leave out the green chilis and onion b/c he does not like either...i used a little bit of onion powder instead....still turned out great!....also as another reviewer suggested i used chicken broth in place of the water...used frozen chicken and just shredded about half way through and then let it cook the remainder of the time shredded....this is a definite keeper...thanks for a great recipe!

This was fantastic!  I did make changes, based on what other reviewers suggested, as well as out of convenience.  I pretty much doubled this recipe (froze half...not sure how that will reheat) because I had a 28-oz can of whole tomatoes.  I used 2 cans (14 oz each) of chicken broth, one can of chopped green chiles, one can of mild red enchilada sauce, and one can of green enchilada sauce.  I did not add water.  I added a can of black beans and golden hominy and used one can of corn instead of frozen-all drained.  I pretty much doubled the spices, garlic, and cilantro.  I added three large frozen chicken breasts and shredded them right before serving.  We topped our soup with lime juice, cheese, tortilla strips, and sour cream.  My 4-year old helped make the tortilla strips.  He brushed the tortillas with oil and used a pizza cutter to make the strips.  We had a great time and a yummy dinner (and lots of leftovers!).

Followed others comments and just threw frozen chicken breast in there and chopped before serving.  This has become a staple in our house.

Simple and easy. The taste was right on. I fallowed this recipe to a t, except that I added black beans because I find them pretty darn delicious. The night before I made some killer caribbean jerk chicken phillies, so I used a little bit of that left over chicken and added it to the fresh chicken to amp up the flavor. I'll be making this bad boy again

This is a huge hit in my family...and every time I make it for guests, I am asked for the recipe.  My only change to the recipe is adding black beans.  If there is any soup left, it's even better the next day (imo).  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 cans of chicken broth (no water), 1 can of corn, and 1 can of black beans.  I threw in 2 frozen chicken breasts and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  For everything else, I followed the recipe as written.  It turned out very good!  Sour cream, cheese, and extra cilantro are a MUST with this soup!

This was very good and satisfying. I took the advice of others and used another can of Chicken Broth instead of water and added 3 frozen chicken breasts which shredded very nicely. I also, used pre-made tortilla chips. The enchilada sauce I used did say hot so it was bit to spicy for my little one, but delicious for the rest of us. Thanks for the Recipe!

My husband asked for seconds!  I rinsed some dry black beans and throw them in the pot.  The beans fully cooked although made the soup a little darker which is fine.  Other then that I stuck with the recipe and just topped with some Cambell's fiesta cheese soup and avocado.

Very tasty! Made this last week and I tossed everything into the slower cooker on my way out the door in the morning, including a frozen chicken breast. I also added a can of pinto beans.  The chicken was so tender when shredding.  This is very easy and very delicious!  I am making it again today since we just had a huge snow storm here in Denver.

This is a delicious recipe.  I am usually skeptical about recipes and assume they don't include enough seasoning, but this was actually perfect as is.  I make it all the time.

Fabulous! I ate this for lunch and dinner 4 days in a row! I've been looking for a tortilla soup recipe that tastes like my favorite restaurant back in Texas, and this is better! I made a couple changes. I used 2 cans of Rotel instead of the whole peeled tomatoes. I also used 4 cups of water with 4 packets of powdered chicken broth seasoning. I also added 1 can of black beans the last hour of cooking. This was not mild or hot - perfect amount of spice in my opinion. I garnished the soup with avocado, shredded mozzarella, and tortilla chips!

This soup was awesome, nice flavor!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly but it is a great recipe to add and subtract ingredients as you see fit.  Next time I will put less water and buy the HOT enchilada sauce as we like spicy foods!

I've tried a few Tortilla Soup recipes and this is my favorite so far.  I put cheese, sliced avocados and a squeeze of lime in each bowl.  Fantastic.

I loved this recipe! My three year old did too, he had two bowls!!!! I added a can of black beans for a little more substance and may try adding rice the next time and do without the tortilla all together. It's also a great recipe to use as a base and add your own flavor to it. Will be making this one over and over.

This is a really good recipe.  I made it on top of the stove because I had the time.  I will make it again.  I added a can of black beans rinsed and drained to it.  Also added a can of rotel tomatoes.  The colors were really nice.  I didn't have the tortillas, so I served over crushed corn chips.  Added grated colby jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream to the top. All I can say is "YUM YUM!!"

This recipe was great. I used a cooked chicken from Boston Market and let it cook with the bones in. I added a big can of chopped tomatoes and a big can on green chilies. It was yummy. The tortilla strips were also easy to make and worth the effort.

Soooo Gooooood! I made this today for dinner earlier this evening and it was a huge hit. Tasted just like my fave mexican restaurant. Served with tortilla chips, grated monterry jack cheese, fresh avacado, and diced sweet onion. I just threw in the frozen chicken breasts and shredded them right before serving. My new fave recipe!

This was delicious soup, everyone loved it and the kids had seconds. I omitted the green chili peppers and used a half tsp of chili pepper and cumin. Also used broth instead of water as suggested per other reviews. Topped it off with cheddar cheese and sour cream. Yummy!

As our 1.5 year-old son said, "YUMMY!" This recipe was easy to make, especially following the advice of other reviewers to put the frozen chicken breasts in at the beginning and shred them later. We changed very little of this recipe and the flavor was exceptional. Our only notable variation was a 15oz can of enchilada sauce since we couldn't find a 10oz can at the store. We highly recommend this soup, topped with sour cream and cheese for optimal flavor.

This recipe was good, and full of flavor and vegetables. I just followed what other users said and threw the chicken in frozen at the beginning and took it out with about an hour or so left to shred it. It worked out great. A good recipe, I will definitely make it again!

This was fine and of course a good weeknight option.  But for me, this soup was lacking and I've had many similar soups that just have more flavor.

This soup was great, I did make a few changes though. While I wanted a soup, I felt it was a bit soupy. During the last 30 minutes in the crock pot, I added a package of Lipton Spanish Rice. It was perfect! I didn't have any cilantro, but wish I had some on hand...I love the stuff! I will be certain to have that next time I make this! The tortilla strips gave this dish an extra flair, it was worth the extra few minutes to make them. Yummy!!!

Quick, easy and very tasty. I used hot enchilada sauce as we like our food a bit spicier as well as chipolte chilli powder. Definitly something I will make again.

This soup was pretty good, almost as good as Chicken Tortilla Soup V (from this website).  I used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of black beans.  I served it with shredded cheddar cheese, tortilla chips (instead of the corn tortillas/oil), olives and sour cream.  Yum!

My family and I thought this was the best tortilla soup ever.  I put frozen chicken in and shredded later.  I also used McCormicks packaged enchilada sauce mix.  Make the sauce as directed on the package.  We never liked canned sauce.  I have passed this on to several friends who all loved it!

this is a good "red" tortilla soup. i simplified it by eliminating the chili powder and cumin, the enchilada sauce gives it enough flavor. i added a can of black beans, drained and rinsed for extra variety. i also simply used tortilla chips, and had cheese for people to add. great way to use leftover chicken, and not too spicy for the kiddos.

So easy and great flavor!  I bake the corn tortillas so I do not have the mess of frying.  I cut them into strips, spray them with non-stick spray, and bake 10 or so minutes, stirring once.  I make this one once per week in the winter!

This one was a big winner in my house.  I did put the chicken in frozen then shredded it toward the end.  We also used the last of the bag of tortilla chips (where they are all crunched up anyway).  Then it needed sour cream.  The next day we ate leftovers and it was even better, still needed sour cream on top, but then we also added some Pico Pica (hot sauce) to liven it up even more and that made a huge difference.  I will be making this one again at the condo on the ski slopes for a nice warmer up for lunch.

Because some people in this household hate to see little chunks of onion or whatnot floating in a soup - this is what I did:  About 3/4 of the way into the cooking time, I took out the whole chicken breasts (that were put in frozen) and then I pureed the soup, put the shredded chicken, black beans and corn in for the remainder of cooking. I used HOT enchilada sauce - we like things spicy around here. EXCELLENT!!!!! Everyone loved it- even my picky children!  I will definitely make this a lot! Thank you for an excellent recipe.

I made this for a family party and everyone loved it! The kids thought it was a bit too spicy, but they're kids so it was expected. My father and sister in-law asked for the recipe!

Great Recipe! The only thing that I did different was use chicken broth instead of water and added a can of black beans. It was SO good, I will definitely be making this again!

I make this at least once a month year round.  It is a family favorite and so easy to make.  I use the pre-cooked shredded chicken that you buy in the meat department.  It adds the perfect flavor.

This soup has become a regular-- especially frozen in small containers for quick lunches.  I've made a couple of modifications-- adding hominy, cooked chorizo sausage and black beans.  I usually add the corn (preferably roasted) at the very end of cooking to keep it's texture.

Really good and easy to make.  I would like it to be a little spicy, so I'll add some more chili powder next time, but that's just personal preference. Thanks!

I made this tonight for my husband and I and we loved it! So easy! I added black beans, 1/2 teaspoon more of chili powder, alittle bit of salt. I omitted the cilantro (my husband doesn't like it) and added a pre-packaged frozen corn/onion/southwestern package. It turned out great!

Awesome and easy! Ingredients I always have on hand. Only thing I don't keep on hand is canned tomatoes with chilies.  I used a 16 oz. jar of salsa.  Even my kids liked it.  I followed another reviewers idea and made my own taco mix. Much less sodium.

I made this exactly as posted except I did use frozen chicken breasts which I removed and shredded at the end (great, great, great idea! Thanks to everyone who suggeested this). After smelling this cooking all day and drooling over the scent, I was a bit disappointed.  We found this soup to be pretty bland.  I ended up adding extra cumin, extra chili powder and a packet of taco seasoning to make it more flavorful. My two-year old devoured it!  My husband and I like things spicy so we added hot sauce individually to our bowls.  I'd make this again but only with my own modifications.  Also, the tortilla chips were a fun, delicious alternative to bagged chips.  I recommend giving it a try if you have the time.

This was a great soup for a cold day. I followed other suggestions and put the chicken in whole and shredded it towards the end. It fell apart. Other than that I followed the recipe exacly and loved it. Especially with shredded cheese and sour cream on top!

This was great and easy soup. I threw everything in the slow cooker (including a can of black beans simply because I love them) and it was ready when I got back from teaching. The chicken was so incredibly tender and the broth was so delicious. I also accidentally grabbed green enchilada sauce instead of red but it turned out fantastic. My picky husband ate several servings!

This was good, but not great.  I followed some other reviews and switched Rotel for the tomatoes (made it too spicy for my, but my family thought it was just right), and added black beans.  Will make it again.

This soup was sooo easy to make, just dump and pour. I put it in the croc pot very early in the morning and used 2 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and by the time I got home from work in the late afternoon all I had to do was shred the chicken breasts. My husband said "I think this could be the best soup you have ever made" And I am a HUGE soup/croc pot cook. Well done! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

My whole family loved this soup! I did add some hot sauce, as we do like things spicy. I also have served this soup with cornmeal muffins instead of the tortilla strips, which can get a bit soggy in the soup.

We really liked this soup.  It wasn't spicy for my children.  I just put in two raw chicken breasts in the beginning of cooking and at the end shredded them and put them back in.  They were perfectly cooked through.  Thanks!

I give this 5 stars because both my 5 & 1 year old kids liked it.  I used uncooked skinless boneless chicken and it cooked up beautifully.  After about 8 hours on low I removed the chicken and shredded it.  Before putting the chicken back in, I thickened the broth with a little cornstarch & water mixture.  My husband had to add some hot sauce to his bowl, which was fine because it was mild enough for the kids.

This was fantastic!!!  I used store bought tortilla chips and also added frozen chicken breasts to the crock pot and let them cook all day,these suggestions made it very easy with little to clean up.  My 5 year old daughter had 2 bowls and gave it a thumbs up and my husband said it was delicious!! Thanks for the great recipe :)

Fantastic recipe.  My girlfriend who lived in southern Mexico for a year said it was just like her host family use to make.  I recommend using spicy enchilada sauce, otherwise it is a little mild.

I followed the recipe almost exact with the exception of having fresh cilanto and using dried. This soup was very easy to make. You through a bunch of things in the cooker and it's done! I like the soup but didnt give it 5 stars because the Tortilla soup at Baja Fresh is way better but it's most likely becasue it has something in it that's fattening. I would make this again.

This is a great easy recipe. I did use 3 frozen chicken breasts but would be a good recipe to use up leftover chicken also. I ate 3 bowls of it last night, it is very very good.

This was awesome!  My hubby & son love to order this at restaurants & they said this recipe is so much better!!  My other son that normally doesn't like tortilla soup tried it & he's hooked now too.  I steamed the chicken for 35 minutes, shredded it, then I added it to the rest of the soup that was already cooking.  I was going to just cook it all together but then I didn't want any of the fat from the chicken in the soup.  Will for sure make this one again.

OMG this is good!  I used the frozen chicken breasts and left out the cilantro (which I think is evil stuff).  I think this would also be very good with hominy instead of corn!

I make this all of the time.  I cook large batches of chicken breast in the crockpot and keep packages of cooked, cubed chicken in the freezer so this recipe is so easy to throw together.  In addition to being easy, it is healthy, and so good.  I usually add a can of black beans (rinsed and drained)to the mix.

I made this, and it was very good. A few adaptations to note: Use a 32-ounce carton of broth instead of water. Putting frozen chicken breasts in at the start worked out fine. I added one can of drained black beans and used one can of canned corn. I like a lot of stuff in my soup, so next time I might be inclined to use at least 1 1/2 cans of each. I might also be inclined to use more cumin and chili powder, just because I like things spicy.

Simply awesome.  Cooked the chix breasts then removed and made chix quesadillas.  Used to love tortilla soup in restaurants -- no more!  I no longer order it because it doesn't stack up to this recipe.  My husband, who is not a soup fan, gobbles up the leftovers.

Great recipe - I only wanted to say that I didn't have red enchilada sauce, so I used green, and it was wonderful. I also threw in black beans and some other veggies in my fridge that needed to be eaten (red bell pepper and zucchini) and served the soup over rice. My whole family LOVED it!

Totally awesome recipe. Though I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, canned corn instead of frozen corn and white pepper instead of black pepper (for extra kick), this soup turned out really well.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! Based on other reviews I added a can of black beans and omitted the water, using chicken broth instead.  As far as the reviewers who suggested it was to 'soupy', once you add the cheese and tortillas in it thickens up.  I am making it today for the second time and can not wait for dinner!

Almost 1,000 reviews, I have to weigh in too. Quite good, I enjoyed it. I too put the chicken in raw, although putting cooked shredded in may give a bit of thickness. I added rice after tasting it without. Liked both. It's very easy, and good.

Not quite as spicy as I thought it would be.  This recipe did not taste bad but it wasn't as "deliscious" as I thought it was going to be based on the review and rating.  And I wish I would have read the review about putting in froven chicken and shredding it later, that would have lessened the prep time.

We all enjoyed this very much.  I didn't have a can of green chiles, so I threw in a Serrano pepper.  I used green enchilada sauce and let it cook on high for several hours.  It seemed a bit thin to me, so I tossed in about 1/2 cup of rice to thicken it.  Now it tasted a bit bland, so I added some dry chicken bouillon.  Served with tortilla chips (from a bag!) and realized I didn't have to put so much rice in since the tortilla chips would have sufficed nicely.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the first thing that I cooked with my new slow cooker, and it turned out pretty well.  I put the chicken in frozen, as suggested by other reviewers and this seemed to work.  It was a bit spicy, and possibly a bit watery, however.  I am a fan of spicy foods, so this worked for me, but it was a bit too hot for some others.  I might try using the black beans next time to thicken the broth.  Leftovers did not last well in the fridge.  I will be making this one again though!

Great recipe and very versatile.  I only had green enchilada sauce and rotel tomatoes so that is what I used.  I also did not cook the chicken ahead of time but let it cook in the crockpot.  I then removed it, shredded it and then returned it to the pot.  I added the corn and a can of pinto beans during the last hour of cooking.  VERY YUMMY and the perfect soup for those cold fall/winter days!

Very good.  Although we tend to like spicy food, the degree of heat was a little unexpected.  Would suggest starting with mild enchilada sauce (we used medium), and then adjust it in the future if you want it spicier.  In our case, we will probably switch to the mild sauce.

My kids and husband love this recipe and it's easy, too! I don't add the chicken until later in the recipe. To get my children to eat all of the vegetables in the soup, I cook everything until tender (minus half the corn and the chicken). Then I pour the soup in the blender, blend and put back into the crock pot. I add the remaining corn, chicken and a can of black beans and let it cook a couple of hours longer. I serve it with chips, cheese and cilantro and everyone loves it. My daughter, who hates most vegetables, asks for this when it's her turn to pick what's for dinner.

I love this recipe, have made it several times and ALWAYS get rave reviews!  Use hot enchilada sauce for more spice.  This last time I made it I used medium and thought it needed a little more kick.

This is a great recipe, I have made it about 10 times for all different occasions.  Always a hit with everyone. Only addition is a can of rinsed black beans and I used 4 frozen chicken breast.  We use for toppings, sour cream, cheese, a little lime juice and lime tortilla chips. Very easy to make.

I've made this recipe about 10 times now - sometimes in the crockpot and sometimes on the stove. We love it. I usually use a rotisserie chicken and add 1 can of rinsed black beans. I serve with chopped cilantro, cheese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips.

Oh wow! This soup was absolutely delicious! I added a can of black beans and the recipe ended up being too much for my crock-pot so I cut back on the water and corn. I'm glad I did! The consistency was perfect. I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

Love this! So easy!  Added large can of black beans, used large can of enchilada sauce and large can of stewed tomatoes. 
Had it with sour cream, cheese and tortilla chips, was really good. Even my kids liked it.
Great for a cold day and so easy to make ahead. Great for company.  With a tossed salad and dinner done!

This was a good base recipe, but it could use a little tweaking. The corn gave it a weird aftertaste. I would recommend adding it near the end so it doesn't impart too much flavor to the rest of the broth. I followed a suggestion and cooked the chicken in the broth, shredding it at the end. It turned out very flavorful and moist.

love this. next time I would double the chicken. I added 1/2 c. diced peppers, and would do that, even more, next time. Double the chili and cumin powders. Probably be ok to use 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of whole tomatoes and chilis. Maybe add some black beans. Maybe add some brown rice.

Great flavor.  Definitely put the chicken in raw and let it cook with the rest, then shred it an hour or so before you serve, makes the chicken taste great and be very tender.  I added two cans of pinto beans, but black would work even better (the wife prefers pinto).  Not spicy at all though, so if you want that, add more chili powder or maybe some fresh/diced jalapeños.

This recipe was awesome!  I also added uncooked chicken breasts and shredded it after about 3 hours.  I also added black beans and used rotel.  We topped with shredded mont jack and cheddar, sour cream, and crumbled tortilla chips!  A great winter soup!

Do not let the long list of ingredients fool you! This soup is quick, easy and most of all, DELICIOUS! I bake the chicken in the oven for an hour, shred, and refrigerate overnight. The next morning, I throw all ingredients in the crock pot and let it simmer all day. I fry up the tortilla strips and use shredded cheddar and a squeeze of lime to top off the bowl of goodness!

i made a variation of this but it turned out really good. I used all the spices but the bay leaf and the green chilies. Instead i used chipotle peppers in adobe sauce (not many cause they are spicy). i also didnt use the chicken broth. Just tomatoes, enchilada sauce, water, and chicken (which i pan fried cause i didnt want to wait. Overall, it was really good and totally adaptable to your family's tastes.

I eyeballed most of the spices, but used 2 fresh tomatoes & 1 can condensed tomato soup since I didn't have canned tomatoes. I also used frozen "chuckwagon" corn-the corn with red peppers and onions, and that saved some time. Since I cubed and cooked the chicken in water before adding to crockpot, I added the fresh broth & left the chicken cubed. For the most part I actually followed this recipe and served with shredded cheese and rice as sides to add to the soup. It tastes great with cheese (of course!), but adds more body to the soup when adding a cup of cheese. The rice I made in my rice cooker, plain, no spices, and just added it to my bowl of soup--served buffet style to guests & family. The rice helped me stretch this budget meal farther.

Our family loved this soup made as it was written with and without the cilantro and loved it both ways. Only thing is that we felt there was not enough chicken in. Next time i will make it with a bit more than called for. Other than that it is a definite keeper.

This was fantastic. I didn't use the slow cooker, and used chopped rotisserie chicken to save time. I added a can of rinsed black beans and 16 oz of frozen corn, and used a 15 oz can of green chile enchilada sauce. I just topped with tortilla chips to save time and energy -- it was a big hit! Adding this to my recipe box.

Wonderful!  My picky kids loved this!  The only things I did differently were to add a can of black beans, and leave out the chilis (I didn't have any)  I garnished with a dollop of sour cream, some shredded cheddar cheese and some baked flour tortilla strips. YUM!  This is something that I will make again and again!

Great soup! Made this tonight for my bf and I. I made this last week for my dad (he was coming up to my place to work on a reodeling project so I wanted to have something hot for him to eat). Unfortunately, my dad forgot to put the slow cooker insert (with the leftover soup) into the fridge before he left. I got home around 9:30 that evening, and, to my dissapointment, the soup was still on the counter! I had to throw all the left-overs away!!!!! I love that this is so easy to prepare... literally, throw all ingredients into the slow cooker and walk away. Served with crushed blue corn chips (skipped the homemade tortilla strips due to lack of time/ingredients), a sprinkling of shredded Mexican blend cheese, some freshly chopped cilantro and a Sangria on the side, this makes for a truly "authentic" meal. I have made a similar soup (Chicken Tortilla Soup I by Star Pooley), and my bf actually likes this one better b/c it is less tomato-ey. I like both about the same, but do like the addition of hominy and black beans in the other one which this doesn't have (but I like the broth-like consistency of this one better also). All in all, this is a great recipe that anyone who appreciates convenience must try. I'll have to make more to see how well it freezes. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome!  I love easy recipes and this was SUPER easy!  I followed the tips on using the frozen chicken breasts at the beginning, as well as a can of black beans.  I shredded the chicken an hour before the soup was done and the beans made it a hearty soup.  I could only find mild enchilada sauce and my husband said it could be hotter.  We added hot sauce to the soup and it kicked up the temperature.  Using crushed tortilla chips and shredded mexican blend cheese as toppings completed the meal!

I made this for the teachers at school.  This was yummy and easy to make.  I made mine with chicken breast but I put them in the slow cooker almost frozen.  I didn't put corn in my soup.  Instead I put two cans of homney in and it was SUPER! Also, I didn't used water, I used an extra can of chicken broth.  Next time I think I will add a little more chili powder.  Easy and yummy!

This had the perfect amount of spice for us.  I put the chicken in frozen and it turned out great when I shredded it.  I will add black beans next time.  I served it with cilantro, lime wedges, sour cream, cheese and chips.  It was so good.  I can't wait to make it again.

Not only is this recipe excellent and delicious, it is easy and fast to put together.  We topped it with the homemade tortilla strips, sour cream, cheese and avocados, it was very good!

I prepared this recipe last weekend for my family and I and LOVED it. It is really easy! The only thing I noticed is that there was too much chicken and not enough liquid/soupiness. After I served it for dinner I noticed everyone had a bunch of chicken at the bottom of their bowl. So I remade this soup this weekend and instead of 1 pound of chicken I used 1/2 pound. I also substituted fresh corn from the cobb for the canned corn and omitted the 2 cups of water for 2 cups of chicken broth. I also added carrots because my husband asked me "Where are the carrots"? Overall this recipe is fantastic. I also recommend frying up your own tortilla strips. It just gives it that homemade touch!

This was a complete hit at my house.  My husband and kids really enjoyed this soup!  I cheated a bit...the shredded chicken I used was from an already cooked whole roasted chicken from the  store and also I added (1) can of black beans.  I decided to cook this on the stove top instead of a slow-cooker.  Great Recipe!!!! Thanks!

This recipe is very tasty! I give it 5 stars. I did not cook this in the slow-cooker, but on the stove. Changes I made: I boiled chicken breast in broth and water until it was shredded. I did not have cumin, but added about 1 Tbsp taco seasoning. I also bought sliced stewed tomatoes with mexican seasoning already added. Everything else was the same. Very yummy! I do have to say I think it is a little too spicy for my one-year-old son. The soup is not too spicy for older children though, very mild.

Pretty  good, if not very authentic. I used hominy instead of corn. Needed more heat to it. Our cheap way was to add hot sauce after the fact, but next time I will use some real chilies and blend them into a sauce. Boyfriend said it was  good. He told me we have to keep this recipe.

This soup was awesome!  I can now throw away any other Chicken Tortilla Soup recipes I have.  The only changes I made were as follows:  put it together the night  before with raw chicken.  It would be cooking for close to 10 hours so I figured I was good.  I put a quart of tomatoes in and left out the 2 cups of water.  I used a handful of fresh cilantro instead of dried.  When I served it I put leftover rice (Goya Yellow Rice) in mine and topped with cheese and bagged tortilla chips.  This was so hearty and thick it filled us right up.  I might have to make it again this week.  Thanks!

This recipe was FANTASTIC! In the slow cooker first thing in the morning, and by supper time, my husband and I had a wonderful smelling house and a very filling dinner. I used some left over shredded chicken from a crock pot chicken earlier in the week. I used onion flakes instead of chopped and didn't add the chili's (only because my onion went bad and it turns out I didn't have a can of green chilis) and it was great any how. Substituted the homemade tortilla chips with some gold corn mini tortillas from the store. Wonderful left over soup too! All my coworkers were jealous.

Love it! This was an excellent soup, will absoultly make again! Like others I put the chicken breast in whole and then shredded about an hour before I served it. Also added a T. of taco seasoning and tsp. of cayenne, I like a little heat.

Very nice!  Needs a little more spice for my tastes so I'll customize it next time but I'll definitely make it again.  I'll also skip the baked tortilla step and use tostadas instead.  Too much effort for the difference in my opinion.

Awesome flavor.  We used HOT enchilada sauce.  I usually am not a spicy foods lover, but the flavor was so great, I couldn't put down my spoon!  We crushed tortilla chips over the top instead of using the corn tortillas.

Absolutely delicious. As recommended by a few others, I added black beans and used frozen chicken. Also, I just used regular tortilla chips rather than making the strips myself, same concept but less involved. This recipe is so easy to make and it turns out great! Oh, and when it says that it serves 8, it really means it! My wife and I will be enjoying leftovers for a while :)

We make this recipe often. I use a can of diced tomatoes rather than the whole tomatoes, and can of corn rather than frozen. I serve with sour cream, fresh lime, cilantro, fresh tomatoes, and tortilla chips. It is delicious!

I pretty much made this recipe as stated, minues the garlic (because I forgot!) and cilantro (b/c I had none) and added black beans, and pastina....I also used only chicken broth, no water, and also used 5 frozen chicken breasts..Finshed it off with some low-fat sour cream and shredded cheddar. The house smelled great when I got home tonight and my husband and 11 month old both gobbled it down!!!

Excellent Soup! I made on the stove-top, and it still turned out amazing. To adjust for stove, I made the following adjustments. 1.) Put chopped onion, green chilis and all spices in a dutch oven with a little veggie oil. Cooked until onions were soft and spices were fragrant. 2.) Added all other ingredients, except I reduced the water by at least a cup of water --- I then brought it to a boil, and reduced to a simmer for 30 min - 1 hour. 3.) I thickened a little with a flour slurry. Honestly, very little effort to make a wonderful dish!

Oh wow, this was good! As we all do, I made a few modifications. First, since it calls for shredded chicken, I put some chicken tenders in a dutch oven and added water about 2 inches over the chicken. I threw in a bay leaf, salt, pepper and a dried red chili. Then simmered until done. Not only did my chicken get cooked and flavored, but I had a nice broth to use in the soup. So I strained out the 'stuff' and added a little water to make the ammt needed. next time I will try to add more water to cook so I dont have to add water. but, there was no loss of chicken flavor. I added a can of crushed tomitillos which really made the flavor pop. I also added sliced baby carrots (they didnt cook completely through but the slight crunch made a nice texture). Yum. For the tortillas, I cut them in very thin strips, tossed them with pam, salt and chili/lime powder and baked them in a 350 oven for about 10 minutes or so until crisp. I set it up like a soup bar. I had the crock of soup, my tortilla strips, cheese, sour cream, sliced avacado and cilanto and let everyone build their own. My whole family loved it. Will definitely put this in my keeper file!

I have to say I was a bit apprehensive when I started making this, seeing as I'm a far better baker then chef. However, this recipe was so foolproof that even I could do it! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and put in frozen chicken and substituted more chicken broth in place of the water. The soup turned out to be so delicious! I'll be freezing the leftovers for work and after telling my Mother about it, she begged me to bring her some. This recipe is way better than any soup I've had in a resturant. I'll definitely be making it again!

Just ok. Even after adjusting the spices, it was still too hot for me. The crockpot dried out my previously moist left over rotisserie chicken. If using cooked chicken, I suppose you should add it last minute. Too similar to chili to be a distinctive dish.

I like this soup. I used a medium enchilada sauce. It was too spicy for us. I would suggest the mild. I made this on the stove top for 4 hours. I also used canned chicken.

What a great recipe!  I served with avocado slices and a dallop of sour cream in each bowl and the whole family loved it.  I have 2 small kids, and 2 older kids, so I used Mild Rotel, cut down on the chile powder & cilantro, and it was not as spicy.  (My husband and older 2 kids added a little chile powder to their bowls to spice it up a tad)...it's hard to find something that everyone likes - this is a keeper.  I served it with a quick taco salad and viola, dinner was done!  Hubby took leftovers to work and said it was better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a dinner party one Christmas and everyone loved it. The hostess wanted the recipe. I put a little less onions than were called for, but this one is delicious.

I thought this soup was very good especially considering the minimal effort to prepare. I did add extra jalepenos and chicken bouillon for personal preference. Served with avocado it is delicious!

Oh my goodness.  This was delicious.  Better than a restaurant.  Made it when I had a friend over for dinner.  She asked for the recipe and made it herself 2 days later.  Very easy to customize.  I, too, used frozen breasts, no corn, and no cilantro (personal taste).  Cooked on high 2 hours, then low for 3.  Topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Crumbled tortilla chips on top instead of making the strips...too lazy this time, but will try it that way eventually.  Will make again and again!

This recipe was okay, but I have found other ones that are much better.  I added more cilantro, and topped the finished product with cheese, avocados and sour cream.  Nothing was wrong with it, but it was just watery and bland compared to the Chicken Avocado Tortilla Soup recipe I had found on here a few years ago and am thoroughly addicted to now.  Thanks for the recipe though, I'm always looking for new ways to use my slow cooker!

WHOLE family loved it! Even my picky eaters! I used a can of tomato sauce instead of whole tomatos and only used half the water it called for since I had used tomato sauce and didnt want it to be too watery/runny. I also added extra cilantro since I loooove cilantro. I also added a handful of shredded cheese to each bowl. PERFECT! Didn't do the tortillas, instead I served this with tortilla chips on the side. This will be a regular meal at our house!

Yum!  The first time I made it, I didn't have enchilada sauce, so I added taco sauce and a small can of tomato paste.  Delicious.  The second time, I was out of cumin, and it STILL turned out great.  To a beginner like me, it's magical that I can mess it up and it still tastes good.  I recommend Rotel brand tomatoes with green chilis.

This is an awesome torilla soup.  I had a tortilla soup recipe for the slow cooker that I had been making and decided to try this one for a change, and it blew the other recipe out of the water!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a can of black bean during the last hour of cooking, and it was fabulous!  Definitely a keeper!

We really liked this soup.  It has a good flavor.  Only thing I changed was add a few hotter spices and cooked the chicken inside the crock pot with the other ingredients.  Thank you.  Super quick, simple and easy...

Really, really GOOD!  This was so easy to make, with things I usually have on hand in my pantry.  I have made this several times and it is always a big hit with my family.  They enjoy it served over hot cooked rice, but it's fantastic "as is", especially on a cold night.  Definitely a favorite in our house, as good as any restaurant's tortilla soup!

Really good.  Next time I might add something (sugar?, sour cream?) to tone down the acidity of the tomatoes.  Overall very good recipe though.

VERY good! Entire family enjoyed. I processed the tomatoes, chopped onion and chiles to a chunky salsa type consistancy to thicken up the soup. Added black beans per previous posts.. Garnished with cilantro, little cheese, freshly squeezed lime and low fat sour cream.. Enough for leftovers tomorrow which will include the crushed tortilla chips!

I thought this was very tasty.  I didn't have a can of enchilada sauce, so used a packet mix made with water and tomato sauce.  I put all my onion, tomato, garlic and green chiles in the blender and chopped them all fine - I don't like a chunky tortilla soup.  We just crushed tortilla chips over the top and sprinkled some grated cheddar on top as well.  Yummy.  The kids even liked it.  The leftovers were just as good and a bit spicier after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious! I did use 2 cans of chicken broth and no water and made it less spicy by halving the spicy ingredients since we don't handle spicy foods too well. We also put the chicken in right away as others suggested. Super Easy and Super Yummy!

This is a very flexible recipe that can be personalized to the spiciness of your your own taste. Very easy to throw in in the morning and have dinner ready that evening. This has become a regular at our house.

Easy to put together, healthy, and very tasty. I cooked the chicken right in the pot and used all broth, no water. Grated cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro, and avacado toppings make it special.

It's a very tasty soup and great for a winter night.  I eliminated the water and used a total of 4 cups chicken broth.  In the future, I would substitute a can of diced tomatoes vs the whole to make the prep easier.  Top with some shredded cheddar and good to go.  Update - made again and used diced tomatoes and also added some red beans.

Absolutely delicious! I have already made this soup twice and my husband is asking for more! My only complaint was the tortilla strips that go on top. They were a bit time consuming. I looked for the ready-made one's at the store but we live in a small town and I could not find them anywhere. I think they would be just as good. Other than that this recipe is perfect!

We added a LOT more chicken to this recipe - probably twice the amount it called for.  With that addition this was awesome stuff!

This was so awesome, my husband and I absolutely loved it.  It went great with a bad of tortilla strips.  I wouldn't change anything but cutting back on the corn, too much for my taste.

I made this recipe for the first time for a work function.  It was a big hit and has been requested to bring in many more times.  It's easy too, which is a big hit with me as well.

One word- YUM! The only thing I changed about the recipe was extra cilantro and chicken chunks, not shredded. Next time I might add an extra can of green chilis but it's great with just one.

Fantastic! My husband loves tortilla soup and he thought this recipe was one of the best he had ever tasted. I wish it wasn't so filling because I could have eaten more! I can't wait for the leftovers. 

I followed the recipe pretty much as is and was happy with the way it came out. Probably could have used a little more spice but that is easily fixed for the next time I make it. Might try hominy next time instead of frozen corn.

The absolute BEST Chicken Tortilla soup on this site or anywhere!  Follow the recipe to the letter and you will be very, very happy with your soup.  I change the beans to whatever I have in the pantry, but everything else stays the same. The only exception is that I boil my chicken and use the homemade broth instead of canned to keep this fresh and healthy.  If I've got a bag of tortilla chips, we just crush them up and toss on to the soup - with or without a spoonful of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese.  No disappointment with this recipe - definitely a winner!

This is my first shot at tortilla soup, but it couldn't have been any easier!!!  Like others I used another can of chicken broth in place of water, and added a can of drained black beans.  Personally, I think I'd add another can of beans, whatever kind.  I was a little confused which kind of enchilada sauce to use (red or green) so I used red, but next time I think I'll try green... or maybe both! I'd also add more cilantro, but really, on it's own this is a GREAT recipe!!!  I am loving it!

This is better than any restaurant tortilla soup. I have made it many times and it's always a hit in my house. I add a can of drained black beans and make sure to have avacados to garnish with. The avacados soak up the broth and taste so yummy in the soup!

Good! I added the black beans to the soup, and served with store bought chips, sour cream, and cheese. It was great! I worried about it being a little hot for the kids but I feel like the sour cream neutralized some of the chile powder heat. Will make again, it was super easy.

Fabulous!  I used the chips, added an extra large can of Enchilada sauce and chicken stock instead of water and I increased the cilantro and garlic quanities. I also added garbanzo beans and pinto beans.

We absolutely loved this recipe. The soup was so filling and hearty for a cold Wisconsin day! The only thing I would change next time is use diced tomatoes instead of whole so that there were more tomato bites, but other than that, this one is definitely a keeper!

Good flavor! I cooked the chicken with all the ingredients. The chips turned out funky, and would probably not make again. Maybe use store bought next time. This is the second time I've made the soup. I added black beans and used lime juice as a garnish. Really tasty.

I, too, added the chicken breasts frozen and shredded about an hour before we ate.  I skipped the water and added more chicken broth.  Also threw in some beans because I had some.  This was as good as I was hoping it would be.

I used frozen chicken breasts and took out to shred during the final hour. It was perfect and so easy. I'm making it again this weekend for a family party. Good, easy comfort food.

This is a great recipe and very forgiving. I added sauteed celery, bell pepper, onion and 2 minced habanero's. I didnt have enchilada sauce but a can of tomato sauce, 1 cup water, 2 tbsp oil and 1/4 cup chili powder made a perfect substitute. My husband LOVED this soup. I served it with grated jack cheese sprinkled on top. The only thing I would do differently is bake my tortilla strips with less oil next time; they came out a little greasy and tough.

Wow! We just can't get enough of this soup. If I serve this for company, almost everyone wants the recipe.
I just tweek a couple of things, my boys don't like to see chunks of tomatoes, so I blend it up, and put lots more cilantro.. the more the merrier I say. It's addictive.

I just cooked this soup last night and it is one of the best chicken tortilla soups I have tried, and it is so easy to make! I added some chopped zuccchini and served with lime and avocado. I even put some in the food processor for my 14 month old and he absolutely loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.

The recipe was delicious!! I made a few changes: 1)Frozen chicken breasts and left out the water--once the chicken defrosts it lets out enough of its own. 2)I added 2 cans of green chilies and waaaaay more cilantro. 3)Left out the cumin (didnt have any) and added a can of rinsed black beans. 4)Used "Chuck wagon Corn" that already had red peppers, onions and green peppers in it but I still added more chopped onion. I also added a pack of ranch dressing mix--this really added some flavor!! I garnished with sour cream and Cheddar cheese and just put a few tortilla chips around the edge of the bowl for dipping/crushing. We all loved this recipe and I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. Thanks so much!

We took this to a Christmas party (everybody was going to bring sweets), and they loved it!!! Did not add salt. Excellent taste. Thanks for sharing.

Holy cow this was great!! I didn't have chile beans so I put in a can of red kidney beans. I used chicken broth instead of beer. I didn't have any onions either but we never missed them! I broke up whole wheat tortilla chips for the top and added shredded cheese. Everyone in my family loved this. Even my picky 9 year old. Will make again and again!!!

Great recipe.  Used store purchased rotisserie chicken.  Just sauteed onion and garlic added a can of black beans and threw rest together as recipe calls for.  Then cooked an hour on the stove.  Wow, spicy, delicious and healthy too.  Gotta love it.

Nice flavor, but depending on the enchilada sauce, differ on spiciness. I made it for a friend and tried it. My preference is for a heartier soup with more veges, but that could be my preference. My friend thanked me for it.

Delicious! Like other reviewers, I added two raw chicken breasts directly into the soup. When the soup was done I pulled them out to shred and added them back into the soup. Has a nice kick with medium spicy enchilada sauce. My husband loved it too!

Let me just say, this is the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever eaten. I don't think I can order it at a restaurant again. My family loved it. This is something I could eat every week. I didn't change the recipe at all. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this- just had it tonight. I made a couple changes per our tastes. I threw the chicken breasts in raw (4 of them) and omitted the corn at the beginning. After 87 hours in the crockpot I removed the chicken and strained the soup.  I blended the tomatoes, onions and chilies and returned them to the soup, as my hubby doesn't like chunky vegetables in his soup. This actually helped to thicken as well, which was great. I shredded the chicken breasts (they fell apart easily) and returned them to the pot as well. I then added some frozen corn as well as a drained can of kidney beans. Cooked for another hour and a half and it was perfect. Topped with tortilla chips, sour cream, cheese and avocado. This is going to be a staple for us for sure!

Fantastic recipe. I used 2- 14oz cans of Del Monte Stewed tomatoes (Mexican recipe) in place of whole peeled and added canned black beans.  I fried tortilla strips as stated in recipe and topped with sour cream.  Yummy!

This was so good.  I added black beans, used Chicken broth instead of water, added long grain rice, and slow cooked for 4 hours on low, and then the last 2 hours on high with the lid removed off the slow cooker, to thicken soup, since come of the users said it was watery.  It turned out perfect.  Topped off with Tortilla strips, avocodo, cheese and sour cream.  Yummy!

Very Good! My husband and I aren't big soup eaters. So we omitted the water and added only half a can of chicken stock. Added black beans instead of corn and had like a Mexican chicken chili. It was fantastic!

I have made this sooo many times and it is always great! I boil the chicken breast first then shred it. Top with avacado, cheese, and sour cream and its's graet on a cold day. I also add black beans on occasion.

I love this recipe! I feared it would have too much of a "canned" flavor, but it is fabulous! My family loved it!! I add a big can of the enchillada sauce because I think it tastes more flavorable, but that might be too intense for others. Definitely try - you will not be disapointed!

This is SO GOOD!  Super easy, really yummy, and filling.  My boyfriend and I ate until we couldn't take another bite, and still wanted more.  Then we fought over the leftovers the next day!  As far as the recipe goes, I made a few small changes. I used 2 frozen chicken breasts and shredded them halfway through, omitted the onions, used more chicken broth instead of water, used canned corn instead of frozen, added a can of black beans, and used a bag of tortilla chips instead of making my own.  Also, make sure to add a squeeze of fresh lime juice just before eating -- mmm, tasty!

This is delicious!  Following some suggestions from other reviewers, I made a few adjustments: used all chicken broth instead of water, and added some black beans.  I used tomato puree instead of whole tomatoes because I dont care for chunks of tomatoes and used 10 oz. can of Mexicorn instead of frozen corn. I also put the chicken in crockpot cut into strips but not cooked. 6 hours on low was perfect and garnished with sour cream, cheese and purchased tortilla strips.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

My family loves this stuff! My 11 year old wants it 'every day'. :) Do put in the chicken breasts raw and pull it apart a few hours later. Also, add the black beans that everyone suggests. And the homemade tortilla strips are a major part of the hit of this recipe. If you have not tried to make them...it's very easy, give it a try! This is my very favorite "gotta be gone all day, what can i throw in the crockpot in 5 minutes and leave for a few hours" recipe.

This is a regular in our house.  I put the chicken in frozen in the morning and shred it before serving.  In a pinch, I've use tortilla chips, but really, the baked tortillas are better.  I think that a can of black beans would be a great addition, but my kids wouldn't eat it then.

This soup was perfect. I made as directed except substituted crushed corn chips instead of baking tortillas. Served with sliced avacado, Monterrey Jack cheese, and lemon wedges. We ALL loved this one! Will definitely make this again.

I used skinless boneless chicken breasts which I browned in a little olive oil prior to placing them in the slow cooker with the other ingredients. I opted to use commercially made tortilla chips rather than taking time to make my own. We topped the soup with grated Cheddar, sour cream and passed the salsa. This is a wonderful soup for a cool autumn evening. Spicy and yummy.

We used 3 raw breasts and let them cook in the soup, as others suggested. Other than that we followed the directions exactly. It was SO good! Sprinkled some shredded cheese on top and a little dollop of sour cream - perfection!

This soup is better than any I have ever tasted!!!  It is sooo easy and soooo delicious!!  Thank you for sharing.  I made it last night...and didn't want to wait all night for the slow cooker.  I bought a roasted chicken from Walmart, deboned it, put all the ingredients into a stock pot and brought it to a boil.  Let it cook on medium heat for about 30 mins. and IT WAS DELICIOUS!!  I topped it with crushed corn torilla chips and shredded cheese. YUM!YUM!  Can't wait to fix this for my friends!!

LOVED IT! This is a keeper. The only suggestion that I have is to use diced tomatoes rather than the whole. I served it with avocado, lime tortilla chips, lime wedges, cheese. I wish I would have had black olives like others suggested-that would have been great. Next time.

This was really delicious!  I used tostadas, crushed up, instead of frying my own tortilla strips.  I also cut up my raw chicken and let it cook in the crock pot.  Really good garnished with sour cream and black olives.

This was a great, satisfying meal! I added a can of black beans and used homemade enchilada sauce.

Delicious! It's so easy to throw everything in the slow-cooker in the morning and come home to a wonderful meal already ready! Once I scoop some into a bowl, I add cheese on top for that special kick and instead of corn tortillas, I fry flour tortillas on the stove top. So good!

I wasn't crazy about the flavor of this soup. I think it was the enchilada sauce. I like the Southwestern chicken and rice tortilla soup on this site much better.

This was a good one - very flavorful, a little spicy - but not hot. I also used 2 cans broth instead of water, and 2 cans of enchilada sauce which added a little extra flavor/spices. I used a rotisserie chicken for convenience.

So yummy! I added 3 skinless bone-in chicken breasts and shredded after about 3 hours. I used a 25 oz can of diced tomatoes, and 1 14 oz + 1cup of chicken broth instead of the water. I also added blackbeans, halved the chili powder, and added extra garlic and cilantro. My kids loved it too. Definitely serve with tortilla chips, sour cream and cheddar cheese.

I hadn't thought about throwing frozen chicken in to cook with the soup so instead I bought a whole rotisserie chicken from the deli and deboned it. The meat was already juicy and tender. Instead of mashing the tomatoes I used a can of diced instead. In the end we topped each bowl off with some fresh lime juice, diced avocado and 4-5 drops of Cholula Hot Sauce. The whole family loved it and I loved the leftovers!

EXCELLENT!  First time cooking this dish and the recipe is fantastic!  I made very few changes, and it will require no further changes.  I threw the raw chicken breasts in the crock-pot with the other ingredients and cooked on High for 3.5 hours (as another reviewer suggested) then pulled the chicken out, shredded it with two forks, and placed it back in the crock-pot for another hour or so.  I used one can of Hot enchilada sauce, and in place of the water used about 1 cup of Mild enchilada sauce.  This gave the soup a nice thick consistency.  I had bought a bag of tortilla chips instead of making my own, but as I served the soup with a cheddar and green salsa quesadilla I totally forgot about the chips - still great!  I garnished with shredded cheddar cheese, lime juice, shredded lettuce, green onions, and avocado - YUM!  The best part of this dish is the mouth-watering smell that warms the house on a cool, rainy day!

Easy and tasty! I added about 4 sliced carrots and 3 ribs of celery in addition to black beans.  I wanted it thicker, so I only used 2 cups of chicken broth as liquid.

I too made this in a pot on the stove, as I don't have a slow cooker, and it was excellent.  I omitted the chili powder and cilantro (didn't have either) and the salt, and it still turned out plenty flavorful, probably due to the particular enchilada sauce I used.  I also replaced the corn with black beans and hominy.  This recipe will become a regular at our house.

Terrific soup! I followed a few of the other reviewers and just put raw chicken breast strips. My crockpot isn't working so I simmered mine 1 1/2 hours on the stove. I also used frozen corn but added it at the last few minutes.

Beyond super yummy!  I broke my crock pot at the beginning of summer and just got a new one this week and broke it in with this fabulous recipe. I used 1 1/2 lbs. chicken legs, frozen, that I put in the crockpot along with salt, pepper, and 2 cups chicken broth and let that cook 1 hour. I added the remaining ingredients and followed the directions to the letter, but did add the juice of 1 lime and put the cilantro in towards the end.  My husband ate two huge bowls and my son ate three!  They loved it and it had great flavor that required no tweaking. This is unusual as my husband usually wants it spicier and my daughter thinks it is too spicy.  Not with this recipe.  Everyone thought it was perfect!  Great recipe!

This recipe was GREAT!!!  My whole family loved it, even my picky son.  We served it with tortilla strips, avocado slices and sharp cheddar cheese.  As others recommended, we substituted 1 14.5oz can of chicken broth for 2 cups of water.

I followed the recipe and thought the soup was pretty average. I've had canned soups that taste similar so I only rated it 4 stars. I had one small bowl and found it to be really filling. It was an okay soup, just not quite what I was looking for.

This is a GREAT soup. What a great meal from a slow cooker! The soup is broth-y but thickens with the addition of some grated cheese and sour cream in the serving bowls. I added all the meat from one average sized rotisserie chicken which seemed to be too much. Next time I'm just going to add the breast meat.

My husband ate 4 bowls of this the day I made it!! I used hot enchilada sauce but I think we would have liked it a bit spicier. The flavor was outstanding and I strongly recommend taking the time to do the tortilla strips instead of using regular tortilla chips. They were great in the soup.

Terrific tortilla soup!  Like some other reviewers, I added in a can of black beans and cut the liquid back to 2 cups of chicken broth.  I also garnished with lime juice, avacado, cheese and sour cream!  Very good recipe and very healthy!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and 1) used all chicken broth, 2) added 2 cans of drained black beans, and 3) cooked the chicken right in the  soup.  It turned out wonderfully!  We'll make this again-- probably a lot.  :-)

Very good recipe, I made my own enchilada sauce to put in it.  I did not use the 2 cups of water, I used 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup of cream and depending on how much liquid you want you can either leave out the other can of chicken broth or add it in.  Next time in place of the frozen corn, I will add in hominy.  Very good recipe.

Delicious! I just throw in the uncooked chicken and shred before serving. The homemade tortillas I am sure are great but to save time I buy a bag of tortilla chips. All my picky kids love it and its great for potlucks.

We absolutely love this recipe, including my 8 year old son.  It is so easy!  We probably make this once every couple of weeks.  Rather than use the cumin and chili powder, I mix in a packet of taco seasoning.  Otherwise, I follow it exactly.

Very easy to make and uses ingredients I almost always have in stock. I added black beans and more chili powder. Next time I will omit the water and just use chicken broth as I had to add more salt to enhance flavor - I think by omitting water, it will enhance the flavor. I served with hot sauce and jack cheese.

This soup is delicious!!  I followed the directions -- put in 1 lb of raw boneless chicken breasts (shredded and returned to soup after 3 hrs), added 1 can Rotel and a can of black beans. We all loved it and I will definitely make it again!

WOW!!! Easy and tasty I added black beans and omited the water for a heartier soup, also added more chili powder and hot sauce for a KICK!! My guy LOVED it and so did I. I put the chicken in raw and shreded it an hour before serving, made easier when you use two forks.

Very good. A little spicier than I personally like, but I like my stuff on the "wimpy" side.  Froze and reheated well in individual portions.

Delicious! I'm not sure why you'd need to cook the chicken first. Just throw it in raw or frozen and it comes out perfectly.

Good soup!  Hold off on the Cilantro for individuals to decide if they want to add it those picky eaters.  Avocado, cheese, sour cream and fried tortilla strips make this a five star!  Also I added a can of black beans which thickened this soup.  It was even better day two!

This soup is delicous! Very flavorful. I used diced tomatoes w/ jalapeno's rather than the whole tomatoes for a little extra zing! It's great for left overs!!

My husband did not care for the corn.  "Too sweet" he said.  I used a small can of chipotle peppers in place of green chiles, which was fabulous for my husband, but too hot for me.  I do love spicy, but this was atomic.  The homemade baked tortilla chips were delightful.

I think I have prepared this about 3 times a month (I freeze it in individual containers and pull it out when I don't want to cook). This is my favorite meal! My only changes: I add a couple of cans of black beans and use blue corn chips instead of preparing the tortillas.

Another 5 stars! I served this for company (the slow cooker aspect makes it so easy) and everyone loved it. I halved the spices and it was heat-appropriate for everyone. Served with quesadillas for the kids, everyone was happy. I did make the tortilla strips too, easy and tasty.

This was so good and easy. I used a can of black beans, diced tomatoes, and followed others and placed the chicken in frozen.  It cooked up so nicely and was a great soup on cold winter night. Served with corn bread and a dollop of sour cream.

Awesome! I used whole frozen chicken breasts (defrosted just enough to trim off the fat)and shredded them about one hour before serving.  We topped each bowl with shredded colby-jack and store-bought chips. So easy!  This will be in frequent rotation at our house during the winter.

I love this soup! Like other reviewers, I did not add any water and substituted an extra can of chicken broth. I used low sodium broth, added a can of black beans and did not add the salt called for in the recipe. This recipe is so much more fun if you cook your own tortillas! Serving with fresh cilantro is a must. I cooked this for friends and they LOVED it!

I loved this recipe.  It is my favorite soup to make so far.  I used raw chicken in my crock pot and it was very tender.  Chopping up the ingredients is a little bit time consuming, but the outcome is worth it.

This recipe is a keeper.  I only changed a few things.  I added 4 raw chicken breast and let them simmer in with all the ingredients at the very first.  When they were done, I removed them and deboned and shredded the chicken and put back into crock pot.  I also added extra chicken broth in place of the water. I served with grated Colby Jack cheese and Blue Corn tortilla chips.  My family loved it.  Will be making again & again.

per other users sugg.  I cooked thawed chicken in the stew and shredded after a few hours.  I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of recommended seasoning.   Next time I would like to use some beans and maybe thicken the stew a bit. Added frozen corn the last half hour of cooking.  Nice alternative to beef chili and so easy.

I would have given this 10 stars, and I'm not a fan of soups or mexican flavors.  I did leave out the cilantro and tortilla chips.  It needed more salt so I added another 1/2 teaspoon.  Served with a side of corn bread.  I also thought that 1 lb. of shredded chicken was not enough so I boiled a cut-up whole chicken in water with 3 stalks of celery, cut up carrots and an onion cut in half w/1 tablespoon of whole peppercorns.  Boiled it for about 2 hours or until the meat was falling off the bone.  Let it cool, discard veggies, shred.  Makes for a very hearty meal.

Good, but lacked flavor.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I will tweak next time.  On a good note, this is VERY easy.

I liked it, though a bit bland.  It needed some more salt.  My kids (2 and 6) were a bit wary.  The tortilla chips and cheese topping helped.

This was wonderful and so EASY!  It is a little spicier than I normally like, but it is so good it didn't matter.  I used raw, whole chicken breasts in the recipe, then shredded them shortly before serving.  I garnished with Tositos to save time.  The kids loved it too.  Perfect to warm up a cold winter night.

Very easy and delicious.  I used chicken tenders and sauted them with a little taco seasoning, shredded then sauted a little longer with more taco seasoning before adding to the crock pot.

Very good. My 4 year old complained about the peppers burning her tongue, but, as soon as they were picked out, she finished off her bowl. I started with frozen chicken breasts and just shredded when it was done. We added cheese and sour cream when it was served. Will definitely make again, but just leave out the peppers entirely.

I made this using the high setting for just under 4 hours and it was really delicious on a cold day.  I precooked 1lb. of thin sliced chicken breasts in a skillet and they shredded beautifully when cut/scraped on a diagonal.   While the directions didn't note to, I stirred the soup at least once per hour. I also tossed in shredded cheddar cheese and a tablespoon of sour cream to mix it up just before serving with the tortilla crisps and it was delicious.  It also reheats very well. This soup has quite a bite!

Simply amazing!  I omitted the water and can of chicken broth and used a 32 ounce carton of chicken broth instead as recommended in other reviews.  I also added a can of rinsed and drained black beans.  Even my picky husband who hates eating soup for dinner enjoyed this!

Absolutely delicious for cold days.  I added extra cilantro and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of crushing the stewed tomatoes.  The freshness of your spices will add to the flavor this soup.  This is a keeper...I've made it three times in two weeks!

Very Yummy!  I left out the green chile peppers and the bay leaf.  I used canned corn instead of frozen.  I also put the chicken in raw.  I added black beans and kidney beans.  Topping with sour cream and cheddar cheese makes it perfect!  I also used store bought chips.  I am making it again tonight!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!!!

I made this for my husband and me at home, and it was delicious!  Next time, I think I'll cut back on the peppers because it was a tad too spicy.  Also made it for my dad, who is a chicken tortilla soup lover (he orders it wherever we go), and he absolutely loved it.

Delicious!  I used one fresh habanero and jalapeno instead of the canned.  We love spicy but it wasn't too hot!  I also used low salt tortilla chips crumbled on top instead of tortillas with oil.  I wish the slow clooker held a double batch!

This was great.  I did add black beans since thats what we grew up on.  Using chips or baked tortillas work.  I also added chedder cheese to mine.  Loved it.  Thanks for a family favorite that has been lost for many years.

This was great! My husband actually had thirds even though he was stuffed! I added a can of black beans as others had suggested & used packaged grilled chicken & just tore them into pieces. I know you don't have to use a slow cooker using pre-cooked chicken, but it is so nice to just throw everything in & let the flavors blend. Plus it takes me awhile to put all the ingredients together since I'm also playing Thomas the Tank Engine & dancing to Hi-5 with 3 little ones!!!

This is great soup and very easy.  I think the Enchilada sauce really gives it a nice flavor.  The only thing I would do different next time is to not mess with cutting up the corn tortillas and toasting them.  Instead I will just buy some chips because I don't think the extra work with the tortillas really added anything.  However, if you do decide to toast your tortilla strips, a toaster oven works very well and is much faster.

This was great! Made it for Christmas Eve dinner, when we had all of our children and grandchildren. Even the picky eater of the bunch loved it. I did add black beans and a handful of rice. Just to make it go further. I will be making this one again and again. Thanks

I following some of the suggestions in the reviews. Substituted tomatoes and green chilis for 3 cans of the tomato and green chilis. Inserted whole skinless chicken breasts into the slow cooker and the chicken easily shreds right before serving.
Added a can of drained black beans.
Turned out good!

If I could give the more than 5 stars I would!  Did you all realize that if you check your ingredients in the enchilada sauce, this will become a gluten free soup?  I have made this (in the last month) 5 times and have loved it each and every time.  With this recipe, you can make it as hot and spicy or as mild as you like it.  I think I would like to try it with black beans and maybe some avocado - who knows!  This recipe is AWESOME and it is good the way it is.  Thank you for posting!

So good!!!  The only change I will make is to decrease the liquid to either no water or maybe one cup.  It was excellent and great for left overs too!  I used whole wheat flour tortilla's and they were incredible on top of the soup.  Thank you for sharing!!!

Delicious!  I used the tip from others and put whole chicken breasts in (uncooked) and after a few hours took them out, shredded them and put them back in the soup.  Garnishing with sour cream puts it over the moon!  Healthy, too!

Very good.  Not to spicy, not to mild, just right on a chilly night.  I really liked it, although next time i will leave out the water and use all chicken broth as others have suggested.  I think this would be very good with rice too.

This was very good, and easy to make.  I used Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chiles instead of the separate tomatoes and chiles, and beef broth, because that is what I had on hand.  I also used purchased tortilla chips, and my whole family loved it. It was even better the next day, and we all devoured the leftovers.

We absolutely devoured this.  I will definitely make it again.  I didn't bother with the tortillas though, we just used Tostitos chips and crunched them up in our soup.  The second time I made this, we used the "scoops" chips and ate the soup with them.  Excellent

The flavor in this soup is fantastic!! I was hoping for it to have the thickness of a stew rather than a thin soup. I did add the chicken frozen to the soup and shredded it once cooked through. This may have added a little more water. I did reduce the water by a half cup but it was still thin. I may add some cream next time and cook the chicken ahead like the recipe says. I also added black beans which I will add to the soup about 45 min away from being done next time. I got started on this soup late so it will be our dinner for tonight. I can't wait. Very spicey!! Yum. Keeper in my book!

Great slow cooker recipe. I precooked the chicken but will try it in the slow cooker next time.  Cilantro, sour cream, and black beans a must.

It was a really easy receipe to make! I put it in the crockpot before going to bed and we woke up to the wonderful smell the next day. I'm watching what I eat and this recipe at 243 calories was a winner! I just added 1/2 of the cumin and the chili powder for less spice, however, I did add chopped onion, chopped cilantro and an avocado slice for garnish before serving (I know, it pumps up the calories), but it is soooooooooo goood.
Thank you for this recipe Elena!

This recipe was very tasty!  I followed the advice of other users and cooked the chicken breast right in the soup and shredded it just before serving.  I also made my own Enchilada Sauce with the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe on this site.

With modifications, this is definitely a 5-star recipe!  I made as directed, except I threw in 3 frozen boneless chicken breasts instead of the cooked chicken, added i can of drained rinsed (you do this to get the salt off them) black beans, 2T of lime juice, and omitted the bay leaf.  After a couple hours on high I checked on the chicken and it was just thawed and not cooked yet, so I pulled them out and cooked them in a pan on the stove, then shredded them and threw them back into the crock pot  for another hour.  The first day my fiance and I ate it it tasted delicious, but wasn't thick enough for my taste (I was looking for omething comparable to Max and Erma's :)).  The second day, I put the leftover soup back on the stove and whisked in about a cup of flour/water and cornstarch to thicken it.  We had it topped with Fritos and sour cream and it was AMAZING!!  Thanks for a delish recipe!

Absolutely one of my favorites. Like others, I put the chicken in raw & shredded it near the end. I also added a can of black beans, used canned corn, and bought the tomatoes with chiles in them.  Topped with diced avocado, sour cream, shredded cheese, and tortilla chips (didn't fry my own)...delicious.  Definitely on my list of regulars.

this soup was very good.  I didn't have chili powder, so I substituted a 'hot & spicy' Mrs. Dash blend I had... i won't do that next time.  It was so hot we could barely eat it!
Also, I followed another users advice and added Rotel instead of the can of chilies.  
Other than that, I pretty much followed the directions.  
Very good soup.  Will definitely make again!

This was fantastic!  I also threw in raw chicken breasts and shredded later and added a can of black beans.  I like my soup thicker so I left out one cup of water and substituted chicken broth for the other cup.  Hubby said he could eat this every week.  It had tons of great flavor and it was so easy to make!

This recipe was so good and so simple! I followed the recipe pretty much to the T, but added a liitle paprica and crushed red pepper. My boyfriend loves spicy food, and he absolutely loved this soup. I also followed other reviewer's suggestions, and put the chicken in frozen, and it came out perfectly. I will make this again, soon!

Made this last night and we enjoyed it.  I made double the recipe for left overs.  My guest thought it was too spicy although had very good flavor.  Added kidney and black beans, used all chicken broth, used store bought chips, no bay leaf. Pretty tasty!  Next time I will omit the chili powder to reduce spicyness and I will use diced tomatoes.

This is a fabulous recipe.  Adding sour cream is a must, even if it's just a touch.  I also used several of the other suggestions: Using two cans of broth instead of broth and water, adding a can of black beans, putting frozen chicken straight into the crock pot, and adding a few slices of avocado on top.

I LOVE this recipe...i used stewed tomatoes instead... and i put sour cream and cheese on top at the end. Sometimes I skip getting a spoon and eat it all with the tortilla chips. My boyfriend and I make this once every three weeks.

This is good soup. I will probably make it again next week. I think it needs less water so it will be thicker. Also, I will just cook the chicken in the soup.

EASY...TASTY...HEALTHY!  I used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes crushed and used a jar of taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce.  I boiled a large chicken breast cubed for about 5 minutes,drain, and put in soup, instead of left over shredded chicken,and added 3/4 can of drained black beans. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED IS REALLY A GOOD RECIPE TO MAKE SOUP.

Delicious soup. I didn't use tortillas, instead I crumbled baked tortilla chips into the bowl. My daughter is vegetarian so I am going to make this next time with the black beans and serve it with sliced avacados and shredded cheddar cheese.

This was delicious made exactly as the recipe states but I have also made it with low sodium chicken broth as others have recommended and a can of light red kidney beans to make it a little more filling.. One thing I also liked about it, was that no matter how we have made it, it can't be ruined. Also very simple to put together.

This is wonderful and soo easy! I used chicken that I cooked in my crock pot with rotel this weekend.  I didn't have cilantro, but I bet it would have been wonderful! Next time, I will add celery and carrots, plus some lime juice.  But honestly, it was great as is! A little mexican cheese sprinkled on top was the perfect finish!

This is a great recipe. I love all the flavors.  My kids love it too. I start with a pre-cooked rotissierie chicken from the grocery store. I didn't make my own tortilla strips. I used a bag of multi-colored tortilla strips.

Although I didn't have any of this soup(too spicy), my boyfriend absolutely loved it.  He had never had it before, but saw a recipe for it and asked me to make it for him.  He said it got better each time he ate it!   I used thinly sliced chicken breasts which literally fell apart as the soup cooked.  Thanks.

This was great...we thought it was better day two.  Next time I will use a little less of the spices.  We added half a can of drained and rinsed black beans the last half hour and served with a dollop of sour cream.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I made no changes to this recipe (unusual for me) and it turned out great.  I did follow the advice of others and cooked the chicken whole in the pot with everything else (mine were frozen when I threw them in!) and then took it out later to shred it, to save time.

This is the 2nd time I've made this and the only thing I added was a can of black beans.  It is delicious, my whole family loved it.  Tastes better the 2nd night.

This was very good and easy!  I saved a step and added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis rather than adding the tomatoes and chilis seperately; I also cooked the chicken breasts in the slow cooker rather than using cooked chicken, as another reviewer suggested.  I garnished the soup with shredded cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips.  Yum Yum!  Will be making this again!

Had some inexpensive chicken breast pieces - went perfectly. Hearty, tasty soup that went puurrfectly with Poor Man's Caviar,(from this site-appetizer) and Margaritas. Highly recommended for a Slow Cooker Soup dish.

This soup is the best!!!!  My 9 year old even loved it.  It was so easy to make - it was ready when I got home from work.  I also replaced the water with an extra can of chicken broth.

This was soooo good. I added a fresh jalapeno and some  chipotle pepper powder. I didn't add the chicken until the last couple of hours. I threw them in whole and then removed and shredded the chicken just before serving. My husband is still talking about how good this is 3 days later.

Fantastic, reall tasty. Bit hot for me though as had to put natural yoghurt in to cool it down a bit. Will only put half the seasoning in next time and will also try cooking the chicken in it as suggested.

Mine turned out thick enough and with plenty of kick. I used a fresh green chili pepper instead of canned.  I also added 3/4 cup of dried black beans at the start of cooking. As for spices, I added several dashes of ground red chilis, cumin, paprika, and chili powder. I also added two tsp of chili sauce (I love foods with a punch). I cooked it on low for 7 hours, then high for the last hour to make sure the beans were done through.

This is a great soup!  I have a small lunch business and people loved it.  I even had a regular customer call me to tell me how much she loved the soup.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the store and crushed tomatoes ( by accident) and added an envelope of taco seasoning. Came out sort of like tomato soup but it is a hit in my book.

This was absolutely wonderful!  My whole family enjoyed it, the kids included.  I followed all the directions except that I put uncooked chicken breasts in the slow-cooker.  I took them out towards the end of the cooking time to shred them, and then put back in.  I also cut my corn tortillas into thin strips and fried them in olive oil before serving.  I used cheddar cheese, chopped avocado, sliced olives, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges as toppings for the soup.  I will make this again and again!  It's healthy and makes for a very filling meal.

WOW- I was really impressed with this soup it was fantastic and met with rave reviews from my dinner guests. I tried this recipe again and used beef broth, and pot roast beef (browned before tossing into cook fully) and it was excellent. If you haven't already, try this recipe!

This was great!  I too used chopped raw chicken (1.5lb).  I added black beans when I got home from work and let it cook for another hour.  I was worried it wouldn't be spicy enough, but was great with crushed corn chips, avocado and cheese.  Yum - definitely a keeper!!

This turned out great and was pretty easy to make.  I simplified it slightly by using crumbled tortilla chips instead of going through the steps of baking toritillas.

This was a hit with my hubby and myself.  Topped it with fryed corn tortilla chips. Yummy!  Dh said the leftovers were even better.  I cooked my chicken breasts in the microwave because I started this late in the day.  I then put them in the cockpot to cook whole.  I pulled the chicken out and shredded it about 2 hours before serving.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a wonderful soup! I came across this recipe late yesterday morning and normally would have started this in the morning and cooked on low but it was a cold day-perfect for soup-and I couldn't wait to try it.  I cut up two chicken breasts and put them in uncooked, cooked on high for a good4-5 hours or so.  It was a huge hit with the family.  My husband was feeling a little under the weather and this hit the spot.  I did not think it was too spicy and I don't care for spicy food. Did not have cilantro but I don't think it would have made much difference.  Love it!!!

A little too spicey as is for little ones, but husband and I loved it. I added a little extra enchilada sauce and 3/4 the green chiles. Added 1/2 C corn. Worked fine to add 2 frozen chicken breasts to the mix.

I made this last night to take over to a friends house.  My boyfriend tried before we left and he wanted to keep it at home and take something else.  It was very good.  We added a little grated cheese on top and store bought chips.  I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the chili's.  I will definitely make this again!

Great meal! My family loved it. It was VERY easy to make. One thing I would say is that it may be a little too tomatoey. Next time I will cut the can of tomatoes in half.

Excellent!  I haven't had tortilla soup this good since I left Texas.  Used less water and added shredded cheese to make the soup a little thicker.

This was excellent, we all loved it! I had to leave the tortillas in the oven longer, I may have put too much oil on them.

This was incredible! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. We just crumbled tortilla chips on top with shredded cheese and chopped avocado. Purely delicious!

I do a great deal of cooking during the NFL season and decided to try this recipe during week #2.  I excluded the corn to gain acceptance from my children.  Wow! Everyone raved about it!  This stuff ROCKS!

Great recipe. The 2nd time I prepared it, I added a cup more chicken and changed the whole tomatoes to diced tomatoes with chilies and garlic. I also used medium hot enchilada sauce. Family favorite already.

Excellent!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I took the suggestion to top the soup w/ avocado, shredded cheese and lime wedges as well as the tortilla strips and was really happy with the result.  Thanks for sharing.

DELICIOUS!  Better than tsome tortilla soup I've had out.  Mine came out a little on the oily side, but I'm not sure why since I used only lean meat.  But it was still great!  Definitely a keeper.

Very very good and soooo easy. i just used leftover chicken from last night and threw it all in the crockpot before bed. Took it out of the fridge today and viola! dinner. Didn't bother with the tortilla strips tonight but I think I will in the future... and add some sour cream too. Thanks for this easy recipe.

This was really good.  First time eating this soup.  I was alittle concerned about the onions and I didn't add the peppers.  But once I added the chips, sour cream and cheese it was wonderful.  Will make again but I will chop the onions finer.  Thanks for introducing me to tortilla soup!

This recipe pleased all of my family and my dinner guests, noone had tasted anything so delicious and flavorful...they ranted about it the rest of the night. The only thing different I did, was cook the corn tortilla in evoo on the stove, and I had to make alot more they just couldn't get enough of this!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I used fresh cilantro and added an additional tablespoon upon serving. I also stirred in a chopped ripe avocado upon serving.

This turned out really well.  I just wanted it to be a bit thicker so I added some mexican rice and it was great!
