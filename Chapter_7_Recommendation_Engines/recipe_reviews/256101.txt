My first review after years on Allrecipes - they were that good!  I was concerned because my dough wasn't particularly sticky - moderately stiff and elastic - but, although it was difficult to roll out they turned out just fine.  I did use about half of the salt in the dough since I felt the additional salt on top would make them salty enough.  I poked holes in half the recipe, but didn't dock the other half and could see no difference.  I baked them for about 15 minutes, removing the ones that were done earlier and putting the others back until all were a nice golden brown.  They were excellent accompanying the Sun-Dried Tomato Tapenade from Alexis May Tanner (itself an awesome recipe that I might now have to review!)

Great recipe! So easy, quick, minimal ingredients, and I agree the cost of those small bags of artisan crackers now seems outrageous! I followed the basic recipe, including parmesan, but did not have rosemary or any other fresh herbs so I used dried dill. Tasted great! Also, first batch wasn't quite thin enough - they're still tasty and somewhat crunchy, but I wanted more snap - so I made sure to roll second batch thinner. This will be my go to recipe, trying new flavors always, and will probably never get store bought again. PS Loved the video! :-)

These are very tasty, although I liked them better without the added sea salt on top.  Because handling the crackers was so difficult after they were rolled out, resulting in sadly mishapen crackers, I started rolling them out, cutting and pricking them right on the parchment I then put onto the cookie sheet.  They came out great.

Certainly the key here is roll them out thinly but you've got to be careful about over-baking. The taste isn't pleasant. In the video, Chef John returns half the tray to the oven to get the remaining pieces equally brown. I did that with a few but in the end, I prefer the look of the variation in colour .  They look very presentable in the serving bowl and all the crackers are quite crispy.  I had only half the amount of fresh Rosemary and though I'm not so keen on a strong Rosemary taste, these do need the full amount.  Also, I think next time I might pulse the salt a bit to make the bits smaller - to make for a lighter and more even distribution of the salt. Lastly, these can be placed very close to each other on the baking tray - they don't expand.

This recipe is so simple and quick to make! 

I didn't have fresh rosemary or parmigiano reggiano, so I substituted finely grated marbled cheddar cheese and dried rosemary ground in a mortar and pestle. I also added in some dried dill weed, a little onion powder, garlic powder, and some black pepper. The crackers were a hit with my family! I definitely will be making these again.

These are so yummy. The second time I doubled the batch and grabbed Adagio cheese by accident. It was a great mistake. I am not sure which is better. Pricking with a fork did not seem necessary and I did cut back on the salt.

Wonderful! We made these, just half a recipe because we are having to use gluten free flour and don’t want to waste it. We were thrilled with the results! I used seasoned olive oil that had Italian herbs, then per recipe, and we love them! Definitely planning to make more. Soon.

I’ve bumped up my spices each time I’ve made these.  This is a great jumping off recipe and is super mailable to create crackers that compliment your topping selection.  The batch I made tonight I added nigella seeds, double rosemary, garlic, and ground, smokey crushed red pepper flakes. They are addictive!

Made these for company the other night without the rosemary because I didn't have any.  Didn't make a difference in the end product.  They were really easy and delicious - love Chef John - never lets me down!

I didn't have the fresh cheese so I used the grated cheese that come from the aisle section. It turned out great. I will definitely make again

I just made these !  They are easy (the longest part was poking them with a fork)  and they taste wonderful! I added a bit of fresh grind Italian herbs and pepper to my dough!  I probably could have rolled them out a bit thinner, but they were great nonetheless.

These turned out great and I am not a chef! We are trying to reduce waste by buying less processed stuff and cooking at home, so this is my first attempt at making crackers from scratch. This is surprisingly simple and they taste way better than store-bought. It is challenging to get the thickness and shape consistent, so I will say that just adds to the richness of home-cooked food!

I made it according to the recipe and it was great. Next time I will roll the dough thinner. 
I plan on trying different herbs and spices each batch I make. I will never have store bought crackers again. 
Thank you Chef John.

I’ve made these twice. Both times I found the dough very crumbly to start but continued hand kneading in the bowl brought it together. I used my KitchenAid pasta roller starting with #1 setting and stopping after #3. This made the rolled out dough consultant in thickness and baking. I didn’t have parmesan so I used old cheddar with a fine grater and mixed in the flour as I grated to avoid lumps. The first time I used Rosemary but found it a bit intense for my taste so I used a half teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon on basil for the second batch. And will stick with that.

This is the best cracker recipe I‘Ve tried. Easy to make but... they don’t last long. It’s hard to go wrong with a Chef John!

Wunderbar. for handling, after i rolled out the dough, i transferred to parchment *then* trimmed out the crackers.

i pull them out just as they started to brown: to finish, i put them into a 275 oven for a few minutes getting them cridpy but not burnt.

These were easy and really good. I rolled each half of the dough  on a sheet of parchment, cut the dough into squares and slipped the parchment onto a cookie sheet to bake. After 10 minutes I removed the crackers that were browned, turned the others over and returned the sheet to the oven, checking every two minutes for more browned crackers.  
The only change I would make next time is a little less salt in the dough.

I found these to be a little bit dry but I used the cheaper shelf parmesan instead of the real stuff, so that might have made a difference. The first batch was also a little less crisp than I had hoped, for the second batch I rolled them out thinner and that seemed to help a bit.

These were a hit at the banquet as a appetizer. I served them with a cream bacon ranch cheddar dip and didn't have any to bring home. My grandkids were disappointed.

GREAT! I only had  dried rosemary and Kraft grated parmesan and they turned out really good. I adjusted the rosemary to 2 tsp. I will reduce salt to 1 tsp or 3/4 tsp next time - just a little too salty for me, but my kids loved them. Since we are such big cracker eaters, we will make these weekly.
