This was a very refreshing salad. I used crumbled goat cheese instead of feta and chopped raw almonds instead of honey roasted since that's what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again. It's quick enough for a busy weeknight but fancy enough for company. Perhaps a drizzle of balsamic reduction would take it to the next level. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it for company, and they really liked it. I thought it was better the next day when the mint had permeated the melon more.

I omitted the almonds and added 1/4 cup of thinly sliced red onion.  I will decrease the red onion by half when I make this again.  Very refreshing!

Served at a dinner party & everyone enjoyed it! Add 2x or more mint leaves.  Make 4 -6 hours before serving so mint flavor will marinate. Serve with perforated spoon. Highly recommend.

I brought this to a dinner party and everyone raved about it. It was very refreshing and it certainly is a unique combination of ingredients. I can't say I was totally crazy about it, but definitely glad I tried it. Thanks for sharing.
