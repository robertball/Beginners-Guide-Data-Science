I heeded  the advice of the submitter. I added spinach, bell peppers, and a habanero pepper to the mix. Having added ingredients, I had to add extra eggs and added extra bacon, well, because: it's bacon. I changed up the method too. I cooked the bacon in a skillet then used the bacon grease to cook up the veggies, instead of using butter. The timing was about the same. The muffins were ready in 25 minutes. Thank you for the recipe.

I'm very satisfied with the results! I was disappointing that the ham did not turn into the crust on the bottom, but still satisfied! It's nice to have these for breakfast, thank you for giving me this recipe and breakfast to eat! I  shared them and everyone wanted more, haha! That's a good sign! Also, they're the cutest, little muffins I've ever saw!

Easy peasy. Add what you want to the recipe. My only concern was not enough eggs to make 12 muffin tins. Next time Iâ€™ll add more veggies and see. Or just more eggs.
