This was an odd one, I had caught my own lingcod and wanted to try something different with it.. The frypan method with five minutes on each side cooked the cod through. When I tried to switch it to the baking pan for the oven portion the cod fell apart. Should have just done it in the oven by itself or even the pan on the stove. Didn't need both. It was bland as well, wouldn't make this recipe again.

Yummy! I had ling cod bellies and didn't brine it. Was a little stingy on butter, but sauteed the salted fillets in butter in cast iron pan skin side last so the meat side was up on the flip, then added the toppings except additional butter and cooked in the oven, leaving it in the cast iron pan (saved on dishes). Would make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I skipped frying the cod. I just put it in hot 450F oven. After 10 min I added crumbs and lowered the temperature to 400F. It was done in next 20 min.

I thought this recipe was just okay. Made as written, the ling was cooked almost all the way through by the time i took it out of the pan. The breadcrumb topping was good. I  felt it needed more flavor though there was just something missing as the fish was kind of bland. Next time I might add capers and/or shallots or fennel to the pan sauce to give it a bit more flavor.

I went to a local fresh fish market looking for salmon fillets for a dinner with guests. They were out of salmon but had Ling Cod fillets. I want sure what to do with it so I checked out Allrecipes for ideas. I'm so glad I tried this recipe! It was delicious! everyone raved about how flavorful and moist the fish was. thank you!

I've made it twice. It's a little on the salty side so the second time I made it, I didn't brine it and it was perfect.

I reduced the amounts in the recipe because it was only a dinner for two. It was delicious. Our first try with ling fillets. I served it with a wild rice and edemame pilaf.

It was pretty good for something super quick. Next time I'd take the time to batter the fist though.

I used fresh speckled trout instead of cod. It was delicious and my husband said it was as good or better than any restaurant dish!! I followed the recipe from April/May 2017 magazine which is a little different than the one featured here.

I just finished eating this. It was good but to be honest I found it to be a bit bland. I feel 4 stars is generous but oh well :) served with green beans and mini golden potatoes. For cod, I prefer the torsk recipe on this website.

So delicious, and very easy. We are new to the PNW and therefore experimenting in the kitchen with  lot of new fish! This week was Ling Cod, and this recipe was perfect! I was only able to brine it for half the time due to time constraints, and did not have lemon pepper but everything else was as written. Loved the flavors, and the combination of pan searing and then baking crusted was perfect, I will definitely be using this again, as well as a springboard to experiment with more fish in the future!
