The salad was light, easy, and great the next day as left overs! Saving this to make again and again for SURE!

I added another tablespoon of lime juice for more flavor. I wish I had doubled the dressing because it was short; upon serving I had to offer my guests more store bought vinaigrette to add to dish.

This was a good recipe. I would leave out the onions in the dressing. I think they clash with the garlic. I did not care for the olive oil taste. I would use something lighter next time like sunflower oil. All in all, a good recipe for a summer's night dinner.

The salad was excellent.  I made it as is with the exception of the olives.  The dressing was the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, it was far too olive oil tasting.  I plan to make this again; it would be a tasty, healthy, satisfying meal by itself although we paired it with baked maple glazed salmon.

I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and it gave an extra yummy flavor. It will definitely be placed in my recipe file for easy, quick summer salads!

Just simply terrific. I added more garlic and lime juice to our taste. And I made my own black beans in the pressure cooker to avoid the additives in prepackaged beans.

Used 3/4 c. zucchini instead of avocado. Added +1/4 t cayenne pepper and 1/3 c. Parmesan. Delicious!

I used a favorite citrus dressing I had and made the quinoa with no sodium added chicken stock. This was so fresh and yummy and you can adjust the ingredients to customize to your taste. I preferred it at room temperature.

The only change I made was that I used Wishbone EVOO dressing instead of the recipe dressing. My family loved this!

This was a great salad. Because the garlic is raw, i would use less next time and I would add more citrus, maybe some zest to bring that out more!

I quadrupled it, yes, quadrupled! My family of 8 helped make it & ate their fill. We have enough left over for another meal. Yay!
It was delicious! We substituted lemon juice for the lime juice (that's what we had on hand) & enjoyed the olive oil dressing (we use olive oil in most of our recipes). The onions were great & will only get stronger tasting the next day. We also used garlic powder instead of garlic (I would have preferred garlic) to save time. Its flavor will intensify. We served it with sliced kielbasa & roasted asparagus for a complete "spring" meal.

I liked the look of this salad but found it very bland. There are better quinoa salads on this site.

I liked the simplicity and healthy ingredients of this dish. I was in the mood for quinoa salad, so tried this recipe. I'm not a stickler on following recipes, but stayed pretty close to this one. I left out olives & used chopped Visalia onion & poblano pepper,  plus added a cup of shredded chicken. I was out of olive oil, so I used coconut oil.

It tastes fresh and delicious. Thanks for the helpful hints.
