Theses cookies are delicious. A word of caution:make sure you wait until the cookies are completely cool, like suggested. I left mine for two hours to cool, if you try and remove them too soon, the small outer circle, around where you pushed in the peanut butter cup will be pulled off~of course you can still eat the bottom of the cookie but it's best to wait. Also mine took about 12 minutes to bake, they don't really brown but they start to look dry and a bit cracked when done. Thanks for sharing!

I loved these cookies. My only suggestion is to put the pb cups in the freezer for a little while, and it makes them easier to put into the cookies when they come out. They won't melt in your hands! Overall great recipe!

These came out wonderful!  I would suggest, however, to not press down the dough in the mini muffin pan.  Just roll it into 1 inch size balls and place it into the pan.  Also, the peanut butter cup will take a while to cool off completely.  I would put them in the fridge for about an hour (after you cool them to around room temperature) before you try to stack them without smudging.

Made two batches of these for a Christmas party over the weekend. Should have made five. They were the first to go, and everybody kept asking for more.   The only change I made was baking them at 350 instead of 375 for 9 minutes, turned out perfect. make sure you freeze the peanut butter cups before you unwrap them and put the unwrapped candies back in the freezer until the cookies come out of the oven, makes them much easier to work with. Also, I used mini-muffin liners, they're cheap and it saves a lot of trouble getting them out of the pans.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!!

I have been making this exact recipe for quite a few years.  The only difference is I use closer to 42 mini p.b. cups and I only cool in the pan for a few mins., then move to a wire rack.  I make these every year for the school bake sale.  They present well and always get snatched up quickly.  A really  quick and easy recipe to make.

These are in Demand every Christmas at our house. We  have the mini muffin pans 4 that make a dozen. We times the recipe by four , and usually make two to three times. Our Kitchen-Aide Pro gets a workout making the dough! Each Adult(child) wants two times the recipe as a gift. When they are at home they clean us out of the rest and save theirs.We make them and let them cool over night before packing them. YUMMY !

I made some of these as a tester for the upcoming Christmas season and they are delicious! The cookie is chewy, yet soft at the same time. Very delicious, very peanut buttery overall and I added Christmas jimmies which added a bit of crunch - very nice texture contrast IMO. I only have one beef with this recipe, I really should have followed some of the other reviewers advice and line my muffin pan cause even though it is non-stick and I greased it up, these cookies were still a pain to get out! But I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

I made these for our annual Christmas cookie exchange at the urging of someone who had had them before.  What a Great cookie recipe.  I rolled mine in Christmas sprinkles before placing in mini muffin tin and didn't press them in at all. It made them stand out even more while on display. Or, You can add holiday sprinkles to the tops of the chocolate as it melts also. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly--though I do prefer to refrigerate the dough for a bit before handling it. They seem to stay fresh longer than most of the other cookies we exchanged.  Have already made additional batches for gifts and for family since our first 6 batches were exchanged. I will keep this one as a holiday/any day tradition.

I didn't have a mini cupcake pan, so I just baked as normal cookies and put the peanut butter cups in the middle.  I put the cookies in for about a minute to let the peanut butter cup melt, and they looked like sandies.  They were absolutely delicious!!

These were really good, however, you really need to watch the baking time. The first batch I baked the minimum amount and when I removed them from the pan they were rather dark and when cooled became very dry and crumbly. The next batch I underbaked a bit and came out golden brown and stayed soft but not doughy when cooled. These are very very rich and peanutbuttery so be prepared.

Great recipe.  Family favorite.  Never thought that I would critique a recipe.  I have made these many times, especially for my mom who has a tough time baking...long story.  One change that I have made; use mini caramel cups instead of the peanut butter cups.  Nice change of pace and my family prefers the caramel.  Short cut for the dough; use the packaged peanut butter cookie mix.

These are a great cookie, my dough was a bit sticky so I couldn't roll them, so I scooped out about a 1 inch glob. The smaller globs worked better, not as much hung over the side to break off. My kids are going to love these. Thanks!

These are amazing and attractive. I was in a hurry, so used a bag of the betty crocker peanut butter cookie mix, prepared and baked according to package directions, and then added pb cups. Helps to reduce fingerprints on cups in you freeze them for about 15 mins first. Everyone RAVED about how cute and tasty they were.

These cookies were the biggest hit this year at our house. I would not change a thing. I made some for my husbands coworkers (some of his coworkers were raiding other coworker gift tins for more of them). I used mini muffin paper cups to bake them in(like the picture) and then I put them in small tins to give away. Made a nice gift. My kids (there are 4 of them) loved to help by rolling the dough into balls and pressing the peanut butter cups into the cookies.These will be a christmas cookie tradition from now on.

These were sooo good!!!  I made them for a bbq for the 4th of July, not one leftover.  I used the Pillsbury refrigerated cookie dough to save time.  Also used the peanut butter cookie dough for some and chocolate chip cookie dough for the others!!  The chocolate chip dough is a bit harder to press up on the sides of the muffin pan because of the c- chips, but I soon found out that you don't have to press these up on sides.  Because of the moisture of the dough, they will spread out anyway. All you do for that is to press the reeces in the center after baking, it looks and tastes marvelous!!!!!MMMMMMMMM

I’m not a peanut butter/chocolate fan personally, but Hubs is and I recognize a “Hubs Hit” when I see one.  This is it.  Tonight, sometime after supper when his sweet tooth has fully developed, he will be digging into these with gusto.  They’re peanut buttery, chocolaty, chewy and gooey all at the same time; right up a peanut butter/chocolate lover’s alley.  These are peanut butter cookies on steroids.  Not to mention they’re cute as a button.   The only tip I have to offer is to refrigerate the dough a bit to make it less sticky and easier to roll into 1-inch balls.  Other than that, there is no rocket science here.  Make these just as the recipe directs.  Worked for me.

Much like the peanut butter cup cookie recipe from this site, this recipe is a guaranteed kid pleaser.  I make these all the time for parties and gatherings for my kids, and everyone loves them.  Sometimes I use different seasonal sprinkles on the tops to fit the occasion.

worth the time it takes to make them (and really, the time consuming part is waiting for them to cool in the tray before removing them)... delicious!

MMMM, little bite sized pieces of heaven!  Made these little treats for my boys - used all natural crunchy peanut butter as I had some to use up and baked at 350 instead of 375! These were SO GOOD!!  Peanut butter and chocolate, a winner every time in my books!!!  Repeat for sure, yummy!

Best Christmas cookie ever. And I am NOT a chef. But people LOVE this! I mean, they ask for it every year! Good for non-holidays too :) and super easy! If you want to impress people, this is definitely the way to do it. Put them in cute cupcake holders. MMMM beautiful!

I didn't have any Reese's peanut butter cups and my candy mold was too big...so I opted to use Rolo candy pieces...WELL 
absolutely awesome!  Took them to work and they were "gone in 60 seconds"! That was three weeks ago and they are still asking when I am bringing in some more!

Everything I was looking for in a cookie! I followed the recipe and did what other reviewers suggested as far as sticking the mini peanut butter cups in the freezer for awhile...about 20 minutes. Turned out PERFECT!! If you love peanut butter you have to try these

I MAKE THESE EVERY CHRISTMAS AND EVERYONE LOVES THEM. I CHEAT A LITTLE THOUGH. I BUY THE PACKET OF PB COOKIE MIX THAT YOU JUST ADD BUTTER AND EGG TO. THEY STILL TURN OUT WONDERFUL. ALSO, FREEZE THE PB CUPS FIRST. THAT KEEPS THEM FROM MELTING RIGHT AWAY.

We made these as a Father's Day gift. They were so yummy the reciepient asked for more the next day. These are so quick and easy to make. Using our tiny muffin pan made more cookies than we had frozen peanut butter cups so next time and there will be a next time and a next and a next we will be sure to freeze another dozen. UPDATE: We have made these 3 times already and they are the most requested cookie I've ever made.

I made these in a large muffin pan with cupcake papers, they presented very nice at Christmas time with decorative papers. Very rich indeed for the peanut butter lover. I did make some with a hershey kiss in the middle since I ran out of peanut butter cups, they were just as good.

I followed the suggestion to insert refrigerated cups five minutes into the baking time, and they turned out perfectly.

I made thes for my granddaugter's 1st grade class for her birthday and the kids loved them. I made chocolate dog and cat suckers (she loves animals) and the cookies. Each child received one cookie and one sucker. The kids all wanted more cookies and her teacher loved them too! They are a peanut butter cookie with a soft creamy peanut butter cup in the center. Yum!

This is a great recipe.  I love to bake these all the time because my sons are peanut butter cup lovers.  But this is one cookie that really is pretty on a cookie tray at Christmas time!  And they smell awesome as they bake.

Very good.  Dough is hard to work with since it is sticky - much easier if you refrigerate for about 15 minutes first.  Be sure to have the peanut butter cups unwrapped before taking the cookies out, you don't have time to unwrap before the cookies start to set.  I got 48 cookies from the recipe.

FANTASTIC recipe!  These were a big hit at our gathering.  As other posters mentioned - very easy and very tasty.  Freezing the pb cups before pressing them into the cookie worked very well.  Thought they had stuck to the pan, but a little nudge with the point of a knife and they popped out easily.

This recipe was fantastic. They end up looking so cute, and they taste amazing. I made these at a friends house, and now I love this recipe so much, I'm going to go buy mini muffin tins just so I can make them.

This was one of the best recipes I've found yet!  My husband loved it!  The only problem I had wasn't with the recipe it was with the peanut butter cups.  When I was unwrapping them the chocolate was sticking to the wrappers and didn't want to come off in one piece so what I had to do instead was throw them in the fridge for about 10 mins before unwrapping them fully.  I will DEFINATELY make this again!  Very easy and very delicious!!!  Thank You!

Delicious. Following other reviewer's suggestions, I froze the peanut butter cup candies, then unwrapped them (with a 3 year old's help!), put them back into the freezer until the cookies came out of the oven. The young'un lined the mini cupcake tins with paper liners and I plopped dough, sometimes rolled in balls, sometimes not. No difference in final product. The cookies took 9 minutes, 10 minutes was almost overdone and dry. The recipe made 42 cookies. So fast, tasty, and kid friendly for young cooks!

I made these just as directed.  I used half peanut butter cups and half caramel cups.  They did crack a little at the top but held together and still looked great-I sold them at a bake sale.  I used natural peanut butter which had a very soft texture so maybe that was was why they cracked.  I also used mini muffin cup liners and popped the chocolate cups in the freezer before using as suggested by other reviewers.  I got about 42 tarts, not 36.  Great recipe, my boyfriend doesn't like peanut butter and even he liked them!  I will definately make again!

These were delicious and super easy to make.  I also put the peanut butter cups in the freezer while the cookies baked so they didn't melt as fast.  Will DEFINITELY be making again and again!

Mmmmmm...these were so good - I had to make them twice they went so fast!  Followed recipe exactly except when it came to cooking them.  I rolled dough into 1 inch balls and placed in mini muffin pan.  Next I pressed a PB cup in the middle (dough will surround PB cup perfectly) and baked them for exactly 8-1/2 minutes.  I got 48 tarts out of this recipe.

I must have PB Temptations I in my arsenal because it is a tiny bit different than this one.  My recipe taken from this website a few years ago calls for 1 1/2 cup of flour and cooks for 10-12 minutes.  Also - have extra Reese's on hand.  I find I usually use more like 50 cups.  Do not press the dough into the cup, just drop a ball in there and you will be good to go.

These area BIG favorite of anyone I have served them to!  Just make that tiny adjustment to the original and you'll be in pb heaven!

This is the first time I made these cookies and they came out great!  Leave them in the pan to cool for about 20 minutes before taking them out.  I put mine on a separate tray and put them in the fridge for about an hour to cool.  They are in the freezer and waiting for Christmas!

Awesome!  I used mini muffin liners you can find at the store during the holiday and they came out perfect.  I also agree that it's best to refrigerate dough, as it is MUCH easier to shape than room temperate.

I have made simmilar cookies...these taste delicious using chocolate chip cookie dough as well...

A tip for getting them out of the pan - use mini muffin tin liners..pop the cookies out of the pan while they're hot THEN press the candies in. They look festive and allow you to keep baking more cookies!

AMAZING! I made these for a family party and I was really glad I decided to double the recipe.  Everyone loved them and even asked to take some home with them.  I ended up with only 4 cookies to take home for myself!  I will definitely be making these often!  Super easy!  I did freeze the pb cubs (unwrapped) while I made the dough and it made it much easier to handle them. :)

This was a great recipe even without the peanut butter cups, since I was looking for a cookie that I could bake in my muffin pans.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had.  I added 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of raw turbinado sugar, 1/8 cup of regular splenda, 6 tbsp corn oil, and whole wheat flour in place of the sugar, butter, and all-purpose.  I also used Skippy Honey Roasted Chunky PB.  This was my first time baking with Splenda, and it made the cookies too sweet and the aftertaste of the sweetener kind of ruined the cookie.  Otherwise, the recipe was perfect.  Couldn't even taste the difference between the whole wheat and all-purpose.  Bake until the tops of the cookies crack, as the browning occurs only on the sides of the muffin pan.

Very good cookie and a very good base dough.  I took this dough and wrapped it around a Rolo and then made a ball, and baked it.  They turned out so good and chewy, I drizzled melted chocolate on top and they looked very pretty.  Great recipe, will be using this recipe every Christmas!

These are a good "kid cookie"; adults ignore them, but kids go crazy for them.  They do taste better the day after they are made, and my daughter likes them best straight out of the freezer.  White whole wheat flour worked fine here.

My mom has been making these for the family for as long as I can remember.  When we were younger, the kids at school always looked forward to our birthdays because this was always the treat we would bring.  My mom recently switched things up with this recipe and now adds a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and drizzles melted chocolate and melted peanut butter over it.  Sounds like a bit much, I know, but for a chocolate/peanut butter lover like myself... it's heaven!

after eating these the same night  i made them, i was going to give them 4*... but not anymore!  these are so much tastier the next day.  incredibly easy to make and fun as well.  i did add a bit more flour (1 1/3 c. instead of 1 1/4 c.), and i chilled the peanut butter cups first, as per a previous reviewer.  makes the removal SO much easier.  i'm going to try this same idea with a brownie mix and PB cups.  great recipe! thanks!!

These came together quickly, looked good and tasted great. Use silicone mini muffin pans to let the cookies pop out perfectly every time.  My three sons loved them.  We topped them with the peanut butter cups, but tried M&Ms and Rolo candy, too.  Delicious!

EXCELLENT! These were devoured! I made these and gave them away as Christmas treats to friends and neighbors. They stacked beautifully in tins. I didn't have butter, so I used margarine and they were still delicious.  I also used the Hersey Kisses instead of the peanut butter cups. This will be a new tradition for us. Thanks!

Initially I put the peanut butter dough in mini muffin wrappers because in the picture that's how it looked.  They ended up sticking to the paper.  So for the second batch I put them straight into the muffin tin & they worked much better that way. My  husband was satisfied either way.  Nice twist on my usual peanut butter cookies w/ kisses...more peanutbuttery and a different look from the other cookies on my platter!

I normally bake from scratch but I cheat with this recipe.  By using refrigerated cookie dough instead of mixing it up yourself, these are done in a flash.  I prefer chocolate chip cookie dough instead of peanut butter.  They are devoured!

These were easy to make and tasted good but were very heavy and a little oily. I made some with PB cups and some with jelly like another reviewer suggested and it cut the heaviness a little but was too sweet. They look really cute and I love peanut butter but I don't think I will make them again.

My golfing friends loved these!  Easy to make ahead of time too!  Ran out of candies so used a dab of grape jelly--even better than a PB&J sandwich!!!!

Simply THE BEST.  I took them to work & not only were they quickly gone but I got quite a few requests for the recipe!  And 6 months later, they were still talking about them & a co-worker requested I make them for her home party and she paid me to do it!     This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is SO tasty!  My dad is a BIG Peanut Butter fan and these did the trick!  Very easy and fun to make!  Eat them right after you put the Reese's in the center or cever with plastic and eat them after a few days they are still very soft and yummy!!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and used chunky peanut butter, otherwise used the exact recipe and these were hard to keep around. Everyone loved them, by doubling the recipe I made about 90 which was great for a larger group.  I refrigerated the dough before making the balls and kept them refrigerated when done as well so the chocolate wouldn't melt in the summer heat.  Need to make again soon!

One of my husband's favorites!   I tried both the dark chocolate Reeses cups and the milk chocolate Reeses cups.  I also froze the Reeses cup before unpeeling them from the foil (handling while peeling will melt the cups)...and put them back into the freezer until the cookie part was baked.

These oddly enough were not my absolute favorite but have been the most well received baking I think I have ever done. Quite tasty but for me just one does the trick.

I finally got a chance to make these and they were terrific and very, very easy. It took me all of like 1/2 hour to make them. I used PB cups from Trader Joes since I'm not a fan of reeses and they were very peanut buttery, delish!

Love this recipe...and I agree with the other reviews...they must cool!  I get antsy and remove them early.  I loose half the batch because the outer ring comes off.

These are sensational!  I make them every Christmas (and they always get devoured).  I cook mine for exactly 8 minutes.  It makes it easier if you freeze your peanut butter cups for a few minutes before you start to take the wrapping off.  As for waiting for them to cool, I do mine for like 15-20 minutes and they are hard enough to come out.  Also, I use lots and lots of Pam on the bottom of the pans so they won't stick and just slide right out (respray before each batch).

I used a cookie scoop and made 24 of these and ate (gasp) 9 in 2 days. YIKES. Better send these out before I finish the whole batch!

I made these to give away as Christmas presents last year and they were a hit!! My only problem was that when I would take them out of the pan, they would break apart, but looking through the other reviews I now realize my mistake was that I didn't the cookies cool completely, SO MAKE SURE YOU LET THEM COOL! Otherwise a really easy and delicious recipe!

Delicious!
I followed the recipe exactly.  I used mini muffin trays - without muffin liners.  I put the unwrapped mini peanut butter cups in the fridge so they were cold when they were placed in the cookie.  I let the tarts cool for about 45min and removed them without any trouble at all.  They were so easy to make and look great - perfect to bring to friends' houses etc. I put half of the batch in the fridge and served them cold (as some suggested), the other half I left at room temprature.  I preferred them at room temprature but a few people did like them cold.  They are also very rich so one cookie is plenty to fulful a craving!  DELICIOUS!!!

These cookies are pure bliss!!  I always double the recipe because one batch just isn't enough.  Try them straight from the oven (just let them cool for a couple minutes so you can get them out of the pan) and also try them frozen.  YUMMY!!!

I make these all the time. They are always a big hit. I don't always use the mini muffin pan. Sometimes I just line up the mini paper cups on the cookie sheet & drop the balls into the cups. The paper cups hold it together just fine. The only difference is that mini peanut butter cups do not go all the way down flush, but they do still fit in there pretty snug and they never fall apart. Yum!

These cookies were rich and delicious! To make them extra over-the-top, I pressed a peanut butter cup into each cookie after taking the pan out of the oven, and once the pb cup got soft and gooey, I pressed another one into it. Double delicious!

I make these cookies every Christmas as part of my cookie giveaway.  I use the printed liners.  They have been a favorite in my house for many years.They are great to give in a pretty box too. Use the different liners for any holiday.

These were excellent cookies!  I took the advice of many other reviewers - unwrap and refrigerate the reese cups before you put them into the peanut butter cookie part.  Also, I tripled this recipe, and it still turned out beautifully!  Once they are cooled, they are easy to stack, too.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  Absolutely delightful.  I made 3 batches of these, kept one for home, took one to work and one to a friend's house for the holidays.  There were none left at any place!  They were gone within minutes.

A real keeper recipe - made with peanut butter cups received at Christmas. There were only 24, so for the final 12, I used a Hershey chocolate kiss (with the flat side on top). It worked great.

Wow these are great!  I made them for little goody gift baskets.  Each batch made 22 for me.  I filled the cups a little below the top.  Also, I ended up spraying each cup with cooking spray after the 2nd batch stuck really bad.  I had a person who hates chocolate, so for hers I put a dollop of peanut butter in the middle instead of the chocolate pb cup.    Thank you for a delicious way to feed my chocolate/peanut butter cravings.

I have made these 2 years in a row for Christmas and they are one of my favorites. I followed the recipe exactly, it didnt need any changes. I did freeze the peanut butter cups so they didnt melt as much and put my pan out in the snow to cool. I always make 2 batches because one is not enough.

I made a batch without the muffin tin and it came out much better.  It didn't look as fancy, but it was better.  Kids agreed.  I also added a mini M&M in the middle of the PB cup and let it set in.  I used red and green M&Ms for the holidays.  Big hit with the kids!

This is a super version of the peanut butter cookie topped with chocolate.  I love the idea of insetting the cup into the mini pans, it hold so much better than the kisses that I used to use on a regular cookie sheet.  My kids devoured these last night and now I have to make another batch for Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe, it's fantastic and a keeper in my house.

OMG!  I am snowed in and thought I would get my Christmas cookies made ~ these are AWESOME!  I followed the recipe except for I doubled it.  I ended up with 84 of these ~ I think some might have disappeared before I counted ;-) 
I baked for 8 minutes ~ these are perfect to make with "little helpers"  they can roll the dough and drop into the cups - then press the candies into them when they come out of the oven.  Very easy and yummy!! 5 STARS!  These have made it to the list of "regulars" for Christmas cookies...  Thanks for the recipe!!

I have to say, these were absolutely FANTASTIC! It's true what others are saying, they are very rich! If you have a sweet tooth, then these are for you! My Niece almost died when I told her I was making them, she devoured 6 of them in one go! lol Will definately make again! Thank you so much for the great recipe! *Edit* I also wanted to mention that I use the peanut butter dough for peanut butter cookies and they are so amazing, I would never use any other peanut butter cookie recipe...this works out perfect for them!!!

My sister and I have been making these cookies for about 20 years.  They are always a hit with kids and adults alike.  I make them every year to take to my husbands family reunion and everyone loves them.   They are better if you store them in the refrigerator. 
This year I melted the butter instead of just softening it.  It did make it easier to mix all the sugar and peanut butter.  Enjoy--they are excellent

These are EXCELLENT!!!  The only change I made was using 1/2 tbsp of vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp, and that was by mistake.  They were awesome and people at my Christmas gatherings loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!

I used regular cookie sheets instead of the muffin pans, and they turned out fine. You definitely dont have to use the muffin tins if its a pain to get the cookies out!  They turned out really yummy and everyone loved them.

These are awesome! They're fairly easy to make, look like you spent hours & are fancy enough to give as gifts. What we don't eat before Christmas, we plan to give to friends. I'm thinking of trying with ROLO candies, too.

These are fantastic! So easy, and they look like you slaved over them. We saved even more time once by using a roll of store-bought sugar cookie dough (which made 34).  Make sure to spray the mini-muffin pan between each use!

The whole family loved these!  I need to experiment on ways to make them look better.  The sides of the cookie ended up quite a bit higher than the peanut butter cup after everything cooled.  It didn't seem to bother anyone who was eating them though!  Very tasty and soft cookie and it all worked great together!

Great recipe overall!  Make sure you give yourself enough time to let these cool.  The peanut butter cup becomes soft and runny until the tart cools.  Enjoyed by all!

They are now my favorite snack, delicious.  I found out if you  don’t have a cupcake pan available, use a cake pan and pat the outside dough.

The reason I am rating this recipe a 3/5 is because not only was it not the easiest thing to make but when it came out of the oven it  was very sticky and collapsed. So when I went to put the Recces in the shell they basically melted in the shell and so we had to put them in the fridge! We also tried using Peppermint Patties which worked better but not perfect. Even though they basically fell apart on the plate and were hard to make they tasted very good! I think this is a good recipe for someone who doesn't really care about presentation but more about taste. I am not that person so that is why I have to give this recipe a 3 out of 4

This is easily 10 stars. Everyone loves these. They are perfect for cookie exchange.  The best tip I can give you is definitely unwrap whatever chocolate you want to use ahead of time. You need to put them in the minute you take cookies out of oven. This is especially true for Rolos with the caramel in the middle they dont melt unless the cookie is hot.

Pretty sure this is a very old recipe,  I have been making them for over 30 years in full size muffin tins. Personally, I like a little bigger cookie, makes a few less, but worth it! I do chill the candy before unwrapping and remove from the tin quickly to retain chewy texture!

This recipe makes regular peanut butter cookies just fine, too.  You don't HAVE to have the muffin pan and kisses.  I just roll them in brown sugar and flatten with a fork.

Delicious and simple. The puffed-up appearance is normal. Do not put in the Reese's upside down; it just looks weird. Cooked for 9 1/2 to 10 1/2 minutes for each batch of 18-20. Quick to make, though the Reese's cups must be prepared ahead of time (for freezing/unwrapping).

FAST EASY FANTASTIC. Double for sure. Really no reason to prepare pans, drop by teaspoon is fine, 10 minutes good.
Halloween minis seem quite small, I used 2 they melt together. They came out well and did not cool for very long.
Doubling made 2 1/2 trays 48 plus cookies. Grandchildren are going to love I am sure.

One of the best sweet treats I've ever made!! I make these twice a month in double batches and bring them to school for my friends and I always get the sweetest compliments about them. I also always leave school empty-handed because people love them so much... Follow the recipe to a tee to get the best results. Oh and I'm not sure about the exact baking time but I like to leave mine in the oven until there's the slightest hint of browning at the edges. I also recommend you make a double batch if you're planning on keeping some for yourself since these are pretty popular and won't last long if people knew you had 'em. Happy baking!! :)

p.s: I dunno what I'm doing wrong but I always get around 18 instead of 36 cookies per batch.. maybe it's because I use too much dough per cookie but really I'm sure if I used any less, the treats would be kinda flat. :P

verrrrrrry rich. basically the same as the standard peanut butter cookie with Hershey Kiss in the center, but cuter. i topped with a Reese's Pieces candy for extra presentation points. i followed other reviews and didn't use paper liners, just rolled into ball and placed in each muffin cup. turned out great. might try with Rolos or Hershey Kisses next. Thanks!

HA! "you will need a mini muffin pan" is even in the title and somehow I missed that key ingredient. Lol. Oh well. My husband likes them, thats all that matters. I made due with a regular muffin pan, but I'm sure they would be better had I been able to make them smaller, as the poster instructed.
