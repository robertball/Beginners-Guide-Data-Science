I used this great idea for my casserole tonight.  Sliced squash, mushrooms, onions, and jalapenos with sour cream, salsa and cheese.  Topped with a mixture of breadcrumbs and tortilla chips.  I modified it to accomodate what ingredients I had on hand.  I also didn't microwave it; baked at 350 until squash was tender. Thanks so much for this tasty alternative to bland, mushroom soup squash casseroles.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I baked it like someone else mentionioned, and the squash stayed alittle crispy.  I also added some fresh tomatoes.  I used half the amount of sour cream and cheese it called for and it wasn't watery at all. I will definitly make this again.

Excellent change of pace for squash.  I added a drained can of black beans which made it a potential main dish and tasted great!  I also baked at 350 for about 40 minutes and added a teaspoon of garlic powder, and I think fresh tomatoes would also be an excellent addition.  It did come out a little watery from the vegetables cooking down, and I want to try throwing in a little flour or cornstarch next time to try to combat that, but this is a definite keeper.

As it is written this recipe sucks. I ebe tried sauteign the mushrooms, red peppers and onions in olive oil and garlic. I guess if you want a squash dish that squishes the flavor this would be the one for you.

Loved it! It does take awhile to prep it all and I did add a can of drained black beans like someone mentioned. Also cooked it in the oven and used some of the cheese to sprinkle on top of the tortilla chips..HMMMM My husband and I loved it!!

I lightened this up with reduced fat cheese and fat free sour cream. the sour cream probably made it a ilttle watery but overall tasted pretty good and had quite a bite to it (in a good way). Good recipe to use up extra squash from the garden. I would make it again.

Delicious!  I used fat-free sour cream, added left over cauliflower, fresh tomatoes, fresh spinach, left off taco chips and jalapenos, added a dash of red pepper.

I halved the recipe and used a medium-sized casserole dish. My microwave is small and the dish did not fit! So I used a microwave-safe dish and followed all the directions. I finished the recipe by adding a bit more cheese and chips and baking it another 10 minutes or so. It was very good. Flavorful, nutritious and easy-to-make. Great recipe!

A bit of flour stirred into the sauce helps with the watery factor for squash dishes, but truthfully we found this dish to be quite bland.  It really needed a healthy dose of bold spices to jazz up a plain cream sauce.

Great option for all the summer squash we have in our garden...always looking for a new recipe.  We baked it in the oven and followed the original recipe ingredients.  Might add tomatoes or black beans next time.  Thanks for sharing!
