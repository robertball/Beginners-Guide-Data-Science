Just didn’t think this had a whole lot of flavor.  For the most part, all I could taste was the cream cheese.  Garnished with black sesame seeds for a little contrast.  It was OK, but nothing that I would make again.  SouthernChef, sorry, wish I’d been able to give this a better review.

I love this stuff on bagels as a sandwich spread. I hadn't thought of the sesame seeds, but I love them. Toast them a little first, for best flavor.
