If you love lemon, these cookies are the BOMB!  I was looking for a lemon cookie to make from scrath (I don't like using cake mixes), and tried this one with a few modifications - and it's a keeper!  I used unsalted butter and lite lemon yogurt.  I doubled the grated lemon peel and the lemon extract in the cookie.  (Don't be shy about the lemon - it won't hurt the taste at all!) "Drop by tablespoonfuls" is probably an heaping teaspoonful, since a tablespoonful would have to be level to make the right sized cookie (not too big, not too small).  They cooked for the full 12 minutes, and came out a bit puffy and chewy with a nice brown underside.  I didn't quite end up with 18 (only about 16), so if the amount is important to you, be careful!

For the icing, I used "True Lemon" instead of lemon juice (2 packets equal 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, so you need 4, and just add 2 tablespoons of water to the powder and mix) and threw the lemon peel in now (doubling it, for a total of 4 teaspoons).  I also added lemon extract (about 1 teaspoon, maybe a bit more) to the icing.  I double-glazed the cookies with the icing, and sprinkled with yellow decorating sugar.  WOW!  These really are addictive!

Excellent cookie!  Did not come out like picture, flattened out a bit, but a quarter cup more flour should help that next time.  Used lemon yogurt instead of plain. Flavor is perfect, not too honey or too lemon, but a great blend.  Cookie looks cake-like, but is almost chewey when bitten into.  Love it!

This has to be one of my all-time favorites. I AM very impressed with the soft, but held-well-together texture (no crumbling) and balance of lemon-sweetness. I followed the recipe mostly- but put in the full stick of butter and used 2 full cups flour, and baked them 15 minutes because I like them blushing brown. Just excellent. A few years ago, I tried playing with some recipes to come up with the best lemon cookie, and couldn't do it, but it's ok now because wonderful Betty has shared this recipe! Thank you!

This is a perfect tea cookie with a hint of honey and a nice balance of lemon.  Tea cookies are really cakes and should be creamed as such to achieve a tender, rather than chewy, crumb.  I did add the zest to the icing mixture for a more uniform distribution.  Follow the instructions on creaming the ingerdients and this tea cake will be perfect.  Note the descriptor states this recipe makes 3 doz yet the recipe states 18 cookies.  Using a #60 scoop which is about 2 tsp I made 56 that baked to 2 inch cookies.  I will make them smaller next time as I prefer a two bite cookie served with tea.  Wonderful recipe, thanks, Betty!

Great!  Used Fresh lemon juice instead of extract, so I upped the flour by maybe 1/2 cup.

Assuming you like good lemon flavour, you will love these.  I found it better to simply blend the grated lemon rind into the icing and then spread on warm cookies rather then sprinkle on top.  Very nice, soft & moist. I would not change a thing.

These were soft and cake like and the flavor was good.  I would like a flatter chewier cookie with more honey flavor so next time I may decrease the flour, up the honey and maybe add coconut for texture.

I've made these twice now.  First time I followed the recipe exactly (using greek yogurt and real lemon juice) and they were delicious.  Second time, I tried a few tricks to make things easier and less messy.  I put parchment paper down on the cookie sheets and when done baking, let them cool right on the sheet.  While cooling, I brushed with the lemon glaze.  I slid the parchment and cookies off the sheet and onto the counter and kept on going (made a double batch).  Super easy clean up.  They turned out great.

Loved these cookies.  Made 2 batches and it was gone in one day.  Then made 4 batches for my brother to take to work (he's a teacher) and the staff LOVED them.  They were a hit..thank you.  Didn't change a thing and loved it.  SO moist and soft and delish.

I followed this recipe but for two slight adjustments, using sour cream for the yogurt and and an extra two teaspoons of lemon zest in the cookies as I had no extract. The cookies are wonderful on their own without the glaze, soft and buttery with a lovely lemon essence, so I only lightly drizzled the tart lemon glaze on top with just a bit of lemon zest for color. Next time I would leave off the glaze altogether. This is the perfect cookie to have with a hot cup of tea.

Exactly the sort of cookie that I was looking for. Soft, chewy and decadent. I followed the recipe to the T except for adding 1 tablespoon of 3-fruit marmalade (which is a citrus marmalade comprising of orange, lemon and bitter orange). Yum! I skipped the icing 'coz everyone wanted the cookie as is with no aditional sweet in it. lso, mine took exactly 12 minutes for the bottoms of te cookies to turn a lovely golden. I dropped them by teaspoonfuls and got perfectly sized cookies. These do spread a wee bit so dropping them by  teaspoonfuls (or smaller) is advisable. Ofcourse that also means you ge lots more than 18 cookies ... but we're not complainging. =D My mom LOVES these cookies so much. Thank you Betty for sharing such a lovely recipe, this will definitely be made over and over at my place. :)

These smelled SO good when they were baking. I had to use sour cream instead of yogurt, I only had half the amount of honey required, and I added a tsp of vanilla extract. Next time I will add more lemon zest, and a bit more salt I think. Thanks!

These were not bad.  An interesting combination of flavours.  The sourness of yogurt and honey came through the strongest.  It was sweet and sour; soft and were like miniature cakes.  I personally would leave out the honey next time and may be add a 1/4 of a sugar more to make up for it.  I didn't add the glaze as I thought the cookies themselves were sweet enough.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the recipe had honey in it...honey and lemon are my favorite flavors! I made these exactly like the recipe, except I added lemon yogurt. They came out pretty good! Not what I was expecting as far as consistency (the best I can describe it, is almost a moist biscuit texture) but I guess that's what they are supposed to be! A "tea cookie" which I had never heard of (I am a baking newbie) so the key for me, was to make the cookies pretty small, since they were a little dense. And the lemon icing on the top was so good too, definatley the finishing touch.

Nice, soft cookie-holds shape well.  I used 1/2 cup butter and upped the flour to 2 cups.  Substituted sour cream for yogurt.  Used 1 tsp pure lemon extract and 1 Tbsp. fresh squeezed lemon juice because I didn't have lemon zest.  Used raspberry honey-the flavor is quite nice.  Sort of teases the palate with lemon and honey.  Not overpowering.

The taste is delish! But the texture and consistency was way off, I stuck to the recipe EXACTLY and they are almost like pancakes instead of cookies.

OMG!!!  I am SO grateful that this makes a small batch of cookies because otherwise I would have eaten all of them without sharing!  Those of us in my family who adore all things lemon just scarfed these down!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a single thing!  You can plan on one good-sized lemon for a teaspoon of zest.  Don't skip the frosting--it is the perfect touch!  YUM!

Wonderful.  I made these for a blood drive and everybody loved them.  I live at 6,500 elevation so I had to add more flour, but once I got the right amount of flour in the batch (so they didn't cook flat) they were great :)

OMG I think I died and went to lemon heaven! I didn't have any extract so just used lemon juice (fresh lemons) and didn't up the flour. turned out nice and puffy didn't flatten out at all. also was a bit short on icing sugar but the glaze was probably better that way because it tasted more like lemons and less like sugar. Yum! Only wished I had made these cookies while I was pregnant and craveing lemons all the time!

Very light.  I think most ppl would prefer to eat this with the icing, since it adds sweetness.  I was in a rush, so instead of searching for the a.p. flour, I used self rising and didn't add any extra salt or baking powder.  It turned out fine. (I refrigerated half the batter and baked that later, too cakey.  So if I were to make this again with s.r. flour, I'd use room temp dough.)  I had a bit of difficulty getting the cooking time down, since mine were definitely not golden brown at 12 min.  But I looked at the pics, and nobody's were golden brown.  To get any sort of golden color, I had to bake long enough that it invariably over browned the bottoms.  Still, the flavor was good.  I'd repeat this recipe again if I need to use up some lemon zest.

This is a nice little cookie to keep around. I used lemon juice, since the tree in the backyard is having it's best year. I also used 1/2 C butter and added the zest to the dough and icing. these were a real hit. I ended up with 4 dozen, using an 80 scoop

Super yummy.  I added a full 2 cups of flour and 1 tsp lemon extract.  I cooked them for 12 minutes on a silpat.  They came out soft and delicious.  I got 23 cookies.  Do not skip the glaze!  This makes the cookie.  Otherwise there is not much of a lemon flavor.

the taste was good, but mine baked into big, flat cookies. It was probably my fault that they didn't look anything like the picture. My husband liked the taste of the raw batter better than the baked cookie, and he also liked them better without the lemon icing. Refrigerating the dough for 5-10 minutes before scooping onto baking sheet makes th process easier.

This came out so tasty. I skipped the icing because my husband prefers not to have things to sweet.  It really has a lovely taste  even without the icing.  I made them on a Sunday afternoon & by Monday evening there was not one left to be found.  Big thumbs up from our crew.

Excellent recipe. I used lime juice and zest instead of lemon. To make lime extract, I simmered kefir lime leaves in a little orange liqueur, but lemon extract would do just fine. For the icing, I added half again as much juice to the powdered sugar, for a zestier flavor, and mixed the peel in with the icing instead of sprinkling on top. Hardened just fine, and was a little simpler than the recommended process. Delicious cookies, soft and light.

These were quite tasty and something I will definetly make again. The flavor combination of lemon and honey is truly a winner, and presented in a cookie form it makes for a nice snack and companion with a cup of hot tea. Mine turned out rather soft and chewy, with nicely crisp edges, which is fine by me because I prefer chewy cookies, but I think a more fluffy, cake-like texture would be much more fitting for the flavor. Overall, a nice solid recipe and I look forward to having these again soon!

These are SOOOOO good.  I used real lemon juice, but that was the only change I made.  The texture is light and soft...they're just so good I think I'm going to go eat the rest of them.

Very tasty, but if you don't like really sweet cookies (like myself) I would cut down on the sugar. I listened to the other reviews and used lemon yogurt and they turned out great! I did not put the glaze on because the added sugar would have been too much for me.

Amazing!  I absolutely loved these.  So lemon-y and light.  Again, used Ideal sugar substitute instead of sugar and my plain yogurt was fat free. Made the perfect amount w/o a tonof leftovers. Great Easter cookie!

This was a pretty good cookie, it was a nice change from the chocolate, peanut butter, or oatmeal cookie. It was very different from any cookie I have tasted before. It almost melts in the mouth. It has a nice light lemony taste and is soft like a cake but slightly chewy like a cookie. Make sure you use a medium to large bowl for the creamed ingredients because the rest of the ingredients will be added to that at the end. I subtituted sour cream for the plain yogurt. I also only had half the honey needed, so I used half honey and half corn syrup. Some honey is needed, as it seems to add to the taste. And, then I used lemon juice instead of extract. I didn't have it, and the lemon juice gave it a nice lemony flavor, anyway. I think it would be a really good cookie for the spring time or for a baby or wedding shower, etc. The recipe made about 20 cookies.

I made these with fresh lemon juice instead of lemon extract and vanilla yogurt since that's what I had in the house. They still turned out amazing. I also left out the zest on the top, since they were plenty lemony. I used this same recipe and had 26 cookies instead of 18, so I had to go light on the icing for each. The icing is really sweet, though, so I don't think I'll make more next time.

These were awesome!  I changed the plain yogurt to lemon yogurt as some suggested.  Took them to Tuesday church gathering and I didn't even get to eat one.  They were all gone!  Wonderful! When I make them again I will double or triple the batch so there are more.

I made an almost vegan version of this cookie (I kept the honey) - substituting Earth Balance, pure cane sugar, enner g egg replacer, and soy yogurt. It was just okay for me.. a little too cakey..

I made a few changes because it was 102*F here today and I didn't want to go to the store- but I have no doubt it would have been great as written! I doubled my recipe. I only had 1/3C honey, used  Yoplait lemon non-fat, light yogurt and lemon extract as I had no lemons on hand and only enough lemon juice to make the icing. I also mixed the honey mixture with the yogurt/butter mixture for ease of combining with no problems- and I did have to add about 1/3C extra flour due to the yogurt containers being 6oz(more than required)   Took this to a church function and was asked for the recipe more than 10 times! Moist, cake-like and the small size was appealing. I made over 60 cookies, and came home with none!

I made these because I love lemon cookies and they looked easy.  Plus, I had some plain yogurt I needed to use up.  Most of the soft lemon cookie recipes here seem to be made with cake mix, and I wanted one from scratch.  Well, I am so glad I tried it because we LOVED them!  The only reason I went with four stars (4.5 if it was possible) was that the icing was too tart.  But when I added more powdered sugar and a little milk, it was perfect.  I'll be making these again!

My mom recently had me try these lemon cookies she bought from a local Italian deli near Boston.  They were made by a little old Italian woman from her home and sold at the deli.  They were incredible.  I have searched and searched for a lemon cookie recipe that could come close and have failed miserably until today!  SUCCESS!!!!  These are better than the deli cookies (Sorry, Little Old Italian Lady!) Cakey and moist...just enough on the lemon!  I did as others have said and used the lemon yogurt.  I served them when we had couples over and everyone was crazy about them!  Guess I better make a double batch next time!

A cake like cookie that goes fabulously with tea.  I'll make them again, but add a bit more lemon extract to the dough this time.  Elegant but not intimidating.

These are awesome!  Perfect for a tea party.  I mixed the grated lemon peel into the glaze, which looked beautiful.  I'd add even more peel to the batter and glaze for a more lemony flavor.  I made these using Meyer lemons.

This is a great recipe! Took them to a bar for a b-day party. As soon as I got people to eat them, they flew off the plate! Two guys actually confiscated the plate from me and hid with them! The only reason I gave less than five stars is my husband says it needs to be "more lemony" I will figure out what that means by tweaking the recipe to his liking. He's my ultimate critic.
