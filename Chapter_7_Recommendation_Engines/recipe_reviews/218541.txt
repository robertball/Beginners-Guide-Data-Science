I'm the submitter of this recipe, and I thought I'd give a few tips and pointers! First, this recipe is very versatile. I tried many different measures of the coffee and sugar and they all worked just fine, I settled on the final measurements just as a personal preference. If you like strong coffee flavor, you can easily add more coffee granules. If you like it more or less sweet, you can add more or less sugar. It's up to you! Also, I always use really ripe bananas. The blacker the better! As for the glaze, I've never had a problem with it, it always comes out just fine. So here's my advice. Make sure you PACK the brown sugar. If you are having problems with the glaze separating, then you might not have enough brown sugar, you can try adding a touch more. Make sure you bring it up to a full boil and simmer for at least 2 minutes (that's usually what I do). I let it cool only long enough for it to stop bubbling, then pour it over the loaf. I just tried tonight adding the vanilla after boiling, and that works great too. Good luck! And I hope you enjoy this bread as much as my family and friends do!

I used CoffeeMate's White Chocolate Caramel creamer, melted butter instead of vegetable oil and half/half AP flour and whole wheat flour. I made muffins out of this recipe so baking time was 20 minutes at 350*. I was up early enough so I could bake the muffins and let them set a bit before I glazed my muffins. I set the muffins on cookie cooling sheets that I set inside baking sheets, then I used a spoon to drizzle the glaze over the top. This way, any excess glaze would be caught on the cookie sheet. This banana bread is one of the best we've ever had. I've had two muffins myself this morning but my oldest had four and my youngest ate three. We love it. The flavors are just wonderful and I love the hint of coffee combined with the banana, white chocolate and caramel. Really fantastic muffin recipe--thanks for the new twist! We'll make this again soon. EDITED: All gone. My boys finished off the rest of the muffins by lunchtime. Huge hit, Dianne. Guess I'll be making these again!

I had heard others rave about this and couldn't wait to try it. It turned out wonderful! I had three bananas that needed to be used so I used all three. I also have instant espresso so I used that. It is moist and delicious. I read on the Buzz that others had the glaze turn out crunchy. Make sure that you lower the temperature and just simmer for three minutes. Otherwise, you'll make penuche. I was taught to always add vanilla at the end off the heat to preserve maximum flavor so I did that in the glaze. I want to try this recipe again using pumpkin puree in place of the bananas. I bet that will be great, too. I will update my review and let you know!

I was in a hurry so I used Self-rising flour, omitted the salt and baking soda but did use the baking powder.  I used one big bowl and put everything, all ingredients in at the same time, including the glaze ingredients and mixed with my hand mixer.  I did not melt the butter, just cut up in pieces so it would mix easily and sliced the bananas and mixed them with mixer too. I then made muffins instead of bread, baked 350 for 15-20 minutes.  They are the tenderest, moistest, banana bread muffins I have ever had, a definite keeper.  Easy too.

The caramel macchiato is my husband's favorite drink at the coffee stand.  He also happens to love banana bread, so when I saw what Dianne had created, I knew I had to try it.  The bread is so moist and flavorful, with all of the flavors being subtle and not overpowering.  My only minor issue with the bread was the glaze.  After boiling the ingredients together, mine was very watery and without constant stirring, the butter kept separating.  To make it into a spreadable consistency, I added in some powdered sugar.  Not sure how much, I just dumped some in and mixed it to a light brown frosting.  It was perfect, and we were licking the pan clean after the bread was glazed.  I am sure this will be a repeat in this house!  Thanks for another wonderful recipe, Dianne:)

Very tasty indeed!  I used a caramel vanilla creamer and otherwise followed the recipe for the ingredients.  I made muffins of them because they are easy for me to share that way.  I got 12 regular-sized and 6 mini-sized muffins from the recipe---perfectly domed in 20 minutes for the regular size and 15 minutes for the minis.  One note regarding the glaze---do not let it cook and/or cool too long!  I found THAT out!  Very nice recipe!

The only word to describe this banana bread is PERFECT!  I stink at making banana bread, but had to try this one because of all the good reviews...boy am I glad I did.  It came out absolutely moist and delicious.  It had the perfect blend of coffee, banana and caramel.  The icing just put them over the top.  I made them into muffins after reading Sarah Jo's review, just because I know my family would eat the muffins over the bread.  I baked them at 350 for about 18 minutes and they were perfect.  I will make sure I have the ingredients for this at all times, because I know it's going be made quite often here (already my second batch in 2 days).  Thanks Dianne for sharing this awesome recipe!

Thank you Dianne! I did not make the glaze as I really don't like extra sweet. Only added a tsp. of vanilla and it is to die for!

We never got to the glaze....OMG!!! the bread was fabulous. I'll have to make the glaze the next, because there be a next time. My hubby said right off the bat...this is da bomb! And I had already tasted the batter and had to keep my spoon out of it. Then the dreaded wait. It just looked, smelled and tasted fabulous. I totally am amazed on how all the flavors worked together in this recipe. Amen!! TY Dianne. It's wonderful.

Just made this without the topping.  It was OK.  I used 3 bananas because I wanted a strong banana flavor. Unfortunately, even with 3 still not a strong banana flavor.  My bananas were ripe but not very ripe.  Does that make a difference.  I have 3 bananas left maybe I'll wait another few days and make another loaf to see if that makes a difference.  Wish someone could tell me if using very ripe bananas is the trick.  Don't get me wrong, bread was moist.  I only had to bake for 50 min.  I also think it could use a little more salt and even sugar especially if you are not using the topping.  We don't like sweet sweet but this just felt like it needed more.  Again, maybe if the bananas were riper they would be sweeter and then you wouldn't need more sugar.  Hmmmm??? Guess will have to try again..

Really good recipe but I think I will add an extra tablespoon of coffee next time as we didn't really taste it. As for the glaze after reading the other reviews I added approx. two to three tablespoons of powdered sugar. This helped the glaze set up a little and crust slightly so I could wrap the bread in plastic wrap so we could mail it to some friends. Thank you for the great recipe.

This recipe intrigued me. Alas, I am in the category of people who found it not to taste very banana-y, or very caramelly, or very coffee-y. I made a double batch, which used an entire $8 box of Starbucks VIA coffee powder, I expected a coffee flavor. This bread is tasty, but it is not flavored like any one thing, except perhaps the glaze, which I didn't have a problem with other than I ate too much of it cleaning my pot and whisk and feel a little bit sugar-shocked now :) The better portion of both loaves are going with DH to work; if the flavor has matured overnight and this is well-received at his work, I might come back and bump this up to a 5 even if it isn't exactly what I thought I was making. I did use the macchiato flavor creamer, which is quite nice actually. Regarding the glaze: if it's bubbling and you still have "loose" butter floating on top, add another packed TB of brown sugar and keep stirring. Keep doing that until the butter is no longer "loose". Measurements can be fiddlier than you'd think when you're talking about brown sugar, which varies VASTLY in terms of water retention. Thanks for the recipe, Dianne!

A very moist and delicious bread.  I am not a coffee fan, but did enjoy the faint hint of it in this recipe.  The caramel macchiato coffee creamer is wonderful.  I could not get the glaze to set up, so I added powdered sugar to it and a little of the creamer and it worked perfect.  I baked the recipe in 3 small loaf pans for about 35 minutes.  Worked perfect and came right out of the pans.  DS took one loaf to his girlfriend, one loaf back to school and managed to eat most of the third loaf before leaving for school.  Thanks Dianne for sharing this recipe.  It would be a great addition to Christmas gift baskets.

The bread is really good. Did anyone else have trouble with the glaze? After two attempts, I gave up. It didn't work for me.

I turned mine into muffins. Took 15 minutes to bake. I also used 3 bananas to give it extra moistness. Stirring the caramel topping constantly (even as it cools slightly) will help keep it from breaking down. It takes 8 individual creamers to make 1/2 cup. And I used salted butter. Tasted great. The frosting will be hard to spread if it cools too much or the muffins are too cool so work quickly.

I was already baking one batch of traditional banana bread when I ran into this recipe. I was intrigued and just happened to have a brand new bottle of caramel macchiato creamer in the fridge. I followed the recipe as listed, except that I omitted the glaze because the best part about banana bread is the moist crust at the top! I have to say that I was skeptical at first, but it was even BETTER than the traditional banana bread I baked. I think I'll try the glaze next time I bake this just to give it a shot.

Yummy! I had to use a different flavor of creamer, but I think a lot of flavors would work.  I want to try it with the Caramel Macchiato too.  I also added a cup of chocolate chips.  What a wonderful treat with my coffee!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Dianne!!!

Yum! I used a loaf pan so I could fit it in my electric roaster (Nesco) which I've moved to the patio for the summer.  The flavors were wonderful, and the caramel glaze really makes it special.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Great new twist on a banana recipe.  
Two changes to share:
I added only 1/4 cup caramel coffee creamer and a heaping 1/4 cup of caramel sauce (think ice cream topping).
Also, for those that said the coffee flavor was mild...try Starbucks Via microbrew packets.  Just 2-3 of those packets will give you a powerful coffee punch!

This was a very moist and yummy banana bread. With that said, there was no distinct caramel macchiato or coffee flavor. I didn't tell my husband what the recipe was called and he just thought it was a normal banana bread. Either way it is a good bread, but if you want to taste the coffee or caramel macchiato flavor you will have to adjust the recipe. I also made the frosting which separated and was really runny. I'd suggest skipping the frosting, save your ingredients for one that works!

For a more caramel-y flavor,   use brown sugar in the batter, instead of white sugar! I do this in every banana bread recipe I make.

This has become my go-to recipe for banana bread! I skip the glaze though, because I like to think I'm making it a bit healthier...lol. 
I substitute hazelnut creamer, as well, hubby liked it better that way. I also use espresso rather than instant coffee-I love the richness it gives. Freezes beautifully, I always keep one on hand. Great recipe, flexible to different loaf sizes,  too.

The bananas I used for this recipe were small, so I wasn't sure if the taste of the bananas would come through, so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of banana extract. The baking time was right on. The bread was done baking within 60 minutes. Had trouble with the frosting, so next time I'm going to use a brown sugar frosting I've been using for years to top banana bars, or I thought I'd make a powdered sugar glaze, and add a bit of the Caramel Macchiato creamer to it. Whether you frost or opt to frost this bread, I do think this is one of "the best" tasting banana breads I've had in a long time. I do however, think the 2 tablespoons of instant coffee, gave the bread somewhat of a bitter coffee taste to it, so next time I'm only going to add 1-tablespoon. From now on when I make banana bread, I'm going to use this recipe, as it's a keeper! Thanx for the recipe Dianne!  4/29/2013: In regards to the coffee creamer to use in this recipe... This morning I happen to do a taste test between Coffee-Mate's Caramel Macchiato and International Delight's Caramel Macchiato. Over all, I prefer the Coffee-Mate's brand, it has a really good caramel flavor, (while the other brand does not), and it's not overly sweet as the International Delight brand is. The Coffee-Mate only has 5 grams of sugar, the International Delight has 6 grams. I'm so glad I did this taste test, so now I know which brand of flavored creamers I'm going to select when shopping at the stores.

I had made this without the coffee (I like to drink it, don't like coffee in other foods) and used Splenda Blend.  As with others, my "frosting didn't turn out (I boiled it for 3 min. - let it cool a little and added the vanilla which is what I thought was suggested).  So I decided to add a little more of the cream and added powdered sugar - beat it until smooth and then drizzled it over the bread after cooling and froze it.  Didn't get a chance to eat it until Sat. because I made it for a seminar.  I really enjoyed it - very moist and excellent flavor.  Next time will add more cream to the batter to get more caramel flavor.  Great recipe - thanks.

This didn't have the coffee flavor I was looking for, but that's because of a substitution I made. I couldn't bring myself to purchase instant coffee which I don't drink so I just got a cheap packet of instant cappuchino. Still a great recipe though and next time I'll try it with the instant coffee.

Loved this banana bread.  It came out super moist.  The only changes I made was that I used Baileys Toffee Almond Creamer instead of the Caramel Macchiato and did not make the glaze.  It was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! Super moist and nice flavors... I was hoping for a stronger coffee flavor, but my husband really liked that he couldn't taste the coffee in it, so I guess it worked out!  It was a little too sweet for my tastes, so I think I would skip the glaze next time. Thanks for sharing with us!!! :)

We all really liked this.  Definately a great combination of flavors.  For the first time in my life, I liked the bread better alone without the frosting!  The frosting was good, but it took away from the subtleness of the coffee and cinnamon flavors in the bread. Will definately make again though - the family all agreed. Thanks!

Delicious! This is so moist & a great mix of flavors. I didn't make the glaze, but I followed the rest to a T. Yum, thanks for sharing a fantastic recipe! Next time I make it, I'll make muffins. I have a hard time judging when a loaf is done. My ends were a bit overdone.

I made it into a Bundt cake and added 20 minutes to the time most of the people served suggested a thicker glaze I think I got impatient and poured it while it was too thin next time I’ll let it thicken All in all it got good reviews from the family and church

I used 1 1/2 T. espresso powder instead of the coffee granules.  Also, per someone else's recommendation, I drizzled some caramel syrup into the batter when I was folding it.  I love the flavor of this bread!  So good!  For the glaze, I cut the butter down to 5 T. and as I was spreading it on the bread it seemed to separate.  So then I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top to kind of soak up some of that butter.  It worked.

I'll definitely keep this recipe and make it again!

I loved the idea of a caramel macchiato banana bread but felt this fell short of my expectations. I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't taste any caramel macchiato flavor in the actual bread, only the glaze.  My glaze came out gritty; I guess I didn't cook it long enough.  The bread was good but nothing outstanding.

Not sure what I did to this recipe, I followed the instructions exactly and was very disappointed with my end result. The bread itself had no flavor and the glaze was a gritty mess. I love banana bread and actually have a recipe for regular old banana nut that is amazing. I was very excited to try this recipe and I was so upset it didn't turn out. X

Awesome flavor combo!  I made a few changes to fit our lifestyle and ingrediants I had on hand.  I subbed applesauce for half the butter, disolved the coffee in 1/4c of water, and stirred 2T of powdered caramel vanilla creamer into the flour mix.

I made this for my grandparents and it was good if you have a sweeter taste for breakfast. Some of the family enjoyed it while others passed as they didn't like the glaze. I would recommend to bake two loafs. One with the glaze and one without. Make sure to watch the glaze as I had a hard time getting the consistency I wanted.

I made this according to the instructions.  For me, the coffee taste over powered the banana a bit.  My glaze...I may have used to high of a heat because all the brown sugar did not dissolve like I thought it should.  I will try again and maybe decrease the coffee to 1Tbspn, add a 3rd banana and cook the glaze on a lower heat setting.  Very moist though and the house smelled amazing.

Best banana bread recipe I've ever made.  I changed a few things.  Replaced vegetable oil with virgin coconut oil (You might have to melt if it's cold in your house).  Used 3 bananas instead of 2.  Replaced Caramel Macchiato Coffee Creamer with Starbucks Caramel Macchiato (more natural with more coffee flavor).  I don't like the oily taste of International Delight coffee creamer.  Added vanilla extract right after caramel icing off the stove.  Warning, caramel icing isn't easy to get right, a lot can go wrong from temp. to humidity, expect mixed results, but when you get it right it's the best thing ever.

Delicious!  I used oreo-flavored creamer because I didn't have caramel creamer,  and I didn't make the glaze.  Also did not add the coffee granules....so I guess I didn't really make this recipe, but adapted it for another flavor.  Could really use any flavored coffee creamer, with or without the coffee granules, and it would still be delish.  Was gone within a day!

I used southern butter pecan flavored coffee cream and 3 Tblsps of powered dark hot chocolate mix.  As I am not able to get Macchiato flavored coffee cream.  It came out super!!!!!  Will be making more later this week.

Wonderful!  I used caramel coffee syrup and some 1/2 and 1/2 cuz that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, followed the recipe. It was a hit.

I made it yesterday and I loved it.  I really don't want to know how many calories there are in it, but I would make it again regardless.  I am passing this recipe along to family as I know they will love it too.

I substituted hazelnut flavored liquid creamer for the caramel macciato. I also accidentally included the melted butter and brown sugar in the batter, not realizing those were for the glaze! I added another 1/2 cup of flour to balance out those extra ingredients and the bread turned out fine. My family loved it! Definitely a dessert bread.

I opted  for the eggless version, Still turns out delicious!  I also add a touch of the creamer and a few butterscotch chips to the glaze!

I must have done something wrong making the frosting, it came out as hard candy when it cooled.  I'm making another one as we speak.  Icing free.

My kids loved it and my husband really liked it. I used three medium bananas and it did not have an overpowering taste at all. It took the entire hour to bake and came out moist and delicious. I personally would like a stronger coffee flavor so would definitely use more coffee next time. We couldn't taste it at all. I also would try to get a smoother caramel glaze next time as well. It tasted more like a sugar topping than caramel glaze. My kids and husband loved it so its fine either way. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing. I will definitely make it again.

Awesome recipe.  I always follow the recipe, then make my tweaks in subsequent rounds.  I never have flavored creamer or instant coffee.  But I always have milk or half and half, a bottle of Giordellos Caramel for sundaes, and french press, espresso or pour over coffee.  So, I substituted the half cup of creamer and instant coffee with a caramel latte (let it cool, espresso, half and half or milk, caramel topping).   Worked out great.  My daughter made mini cupcakes and rather than use the recipe topping, she used the sundae caramel and salted it with flakey sea salt, hard not to like, get your sugar early I guess...

Followed the recipe directly, and I think the coffee and caramel taste overwhelmed the banana. In the future I think I'll stick to a plain banana bread, but it was a nice change.

I found this recipe rather bland. Like my regular banana bread recipe much better. The taste was a little off putting. Icing WAY too sweet.

The flavour is excellent!  I added chocolate chips because I like that in my banana bread but it definitely doesn't need it.  I used a Vanilla Caramel creamer because the Caramel Machiatto was sold out and it tasted great.  I did half the vegetable oil and a quarter cup of cold brewed coffee (because I didn't have any) and it was great.   It's definitely not banana, coffee or caramel forward but it's really tasty!

I made this exactly as listed, I thought it was ok, it needed something else to take it to the next level, maybe more salt. Family thought is was ok but liked my banana chocolate chip bread better.

I love this recipe so much that I made it four time in this month. Friday I made one and a frosting came out fantastic. I just made it tonight and the frosting came out terrible LOL but I pour it on there anyway. then I put the bread in the fridge with defrost in just two get it to form for like 2 minutes pull it out the fridge tap on the frosting and it's like a turtle shell LOL so I peel it off the bread and good thing the bread is still in tack. but I'm eating the shell anyway ??. thank you so much for this recipe I just love it.

Only change was the coffee creamer, store was out of caramel machiatto... salted caramel instead.
I was going to get a pic of it when I was finished, was letting it cool for a few minutes before putting the glaze on, and my wife snuck a piece...

This recipe is outstanding. I didn't have instant coffee granules, so I substituted 2 teaspoons of espresso powder. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, which made 12 muffins at 350 degrees for 24 minutes (in my oven). I spread the warm glaze over each muffin, and it hardened nicely. My family raved over these muffins, and I highly recommend them!

I followed the recipe pretty much as it was written and it turned out pretty good. Very moist. It was hard to taste the coffee or the macchiato flavor. I will probably make it again, but maybe try some of the suggestions in the other reviews.

This is a very moist cake! It is delicious! I didn’t have Machiatto cream so I used Half & Half with 1 tsp of caramel extract.  I omitted the salt and cinnamon.I used butter instead of oil and coconut sugar instead of regular sugar. I added 1/4 tsp of maple extract + 1/4 tsp of butter extract + 1/4 tsp of vanilla. Instead of butter for icing I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream whipped to peak. Then, I added 2 Tbsp of coconut sugar, 1/2 tsp of Nescafé, 1/4 tsp of coffee extract, 1/4 tsp of vanilla. Whipped all together and topped the cake. I sprinkled the icing with coconut sugar for decoration. My mistake was not waiting for the cake to cool. Consequently, the whipped cream icing melted. It still tasted good ! It took 1 hour and 10 minutes to bake.

This turned out fairly well, but I have a few techniques to work on. 

I pulled this out at about 50 minutes, and it was already slightly overdone.  My oven is a bit inconsistent so that's the first challenge to overcome.

My bananas weren't quite as ripe as they looked on the outside--total brown outside, but still white inside.  They were soft, but not sticky sweet like they probably should be.

My glaze is sandy... I also used dark brown sugar, but probably could have used light.  If I make this again, I'll reference the submitters suggestions on the glaze.

I may also opt for more banana and coffee, and may also add some walnuts.  I found mashing the banana to be annoying with a fork so I may look for an easier way to do that step... got a few minutes logged on the Fitbit because of the banana mashing.

Because I am Gluten  Free, I substituted Gluten Free Pancake Mix (it already has baking powder and baking soda in it) for the flour and used Hazelnut Coffee Creamer (all I had in the fridge). It came out amazing. I love taking recipes and tweeting them to fit my dietary restrictions.

I made this but I did not make the glaze as we didn't want more calories/sweetness.  I also dissolved the coffee granules in the liquid coffee creamer and heated it slightly.  Otherwise, I find the granules don't dissolve and you get these crunch bits in your product.  The flavor is good but not fantastic. It was not as moist as I had hoped.  I've had better banana bread recipes but if you're looking for some thing different, this would be it.  Not sure if I will make it again.

I made it exactly as per the recipe, and it makes a nice loaf.  Kind of hard to tell it’s banana bread, though.  I didn’t like the glaze.  Again, made per the recipe, but it was gummy.   I think I’ll make this banana bread again, maybe use 3 bananas instead of 2, and use another glaze on it.

I used brown sugar in the bread instead of white. I used a 50/50 mix of oil and applesauce. I added a dash of rum extract in the glaze.

Amazing!  This banana bread is scrumptious!  I was a little apprehensive about using the instant coffee granules, but I took that leap of faith and it really paid off!  The flavor was perfect.  I have two other comments:  #1)  Since I didn't have unsalted butter for the glaze, I used regular salted.  This gave it a delicious salted caramel flavor.  Yum!   #2)  I love nuts in my banana bread, so I was tempted to add chopped pecans or walnuts.  Since the recipe didn't mention nuts, I resisted.  Believe me, the nuts are not even missed.  I will definitely make this banana bread again!

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  I followed the exact recipe, but none of us could taste any coffee flavor or caramel macchiato flavor at all. It was a little on the dry side too, not as moist as my regular recipe. It just tasted like banana bread. And not the best banana bread either. I have my go-to banana bread recipe that I use, and I either add chocolate chips or butterscotch chips to it and it is fantastic. Always gets rave reviews from the family. This recipe got an "eh".  Won't be making again.

The bread turned out moist and delicious. The glaze separated and never came together so I used my own maple glaze. Good recipe for the bread! Banana bread can be tricky sometimes with the middle being undone. This was perfect all the way through.

Thought it would be too sweet.  It is not but didn't make the carmel topping.  
Very good texture, light but with good body.  
Nice adjustment for banana bread.
Great use for overripe  macchiato.

This is sooooo awesome!  Followed the recipe with one exception I switched out for gluten free all purpose flour.  It rose nice and high (took about 75 minutes to bake though) which is unusual for gluten free. My husband asked for a small piece for dessert and immediately asked for seconds.  Thanks Diane we will be having this again!

I think this is great. It’s also versatile. The 2nd time I made this I followed the recipe exactly but for a twist I switched out bananas for carrots. Came out great.  This is a really good base as is or to experiment with.   Thanks for the recipe ??

Oh, I made changes. No caramel coffee creamer so I used half&half + almond extract and used coconut oil for the veg oil. I’ll make the caramel sauce normal... will get back to you when it’s ready. It’s in the oven now. Oh, expresso crystals instead of just coffee. I’ll eat it if no one else will....
It’s great though needs to chill. The coffee flavor is a plus.

I really liked the taste, I changed it a bit to make more diet friendly and I couldn’t find the creamer so I used caramel coffee favoring and milk plus I didn’t make the glaze. It was really moist and had lots of favor.

I followed the directions exactly and unfortunately wasted my ingredients and afternoon making a dry bread that doesn't taste like coffee and is topped with an icing that is sugar gritty because the sugar didn't melt despite me simmering for exactly 3 minutes.   I am so frustrated that the pictures looked so good and it didn't turn out anything like the recipe claimed.

My family, coworkers and neighbors absolutely LOVE this bread.  I make it at least once a week, 4 loaves at a time and share.  Moist wonderful taste and I don't drink coffee. Not heavy.  My only problem is I can't get the glaze to turn out.  I quit after 3 tries . The butter separates from other ingredients and I just have an oily glaze.  What am I doing wrong?

Oh yum.  Dense. Moist. Lightly sweet.

1. I wanted to make this but didn't have the ripened bananas so I subbed 1 cup of Greek yogurt and applesauce mixed (didn't have enough yogurt for a full cup.  Apparently it's time to go shopping).

2.  Added a full cup of sugar to compensate for the lack of banana sweetness.

3. Added 1 extra Tbs of coffee granules. I still couldn't really taste the coffee in the finished bread, but it was certainly delicious so I'll add the same 3 Tbs next time.

4.  Used 1/2 cup melted butter in place of oil.

Made the "glaze" as written, only barely simmering it for the last 3 minutes.  The sugar didn't dissolve so it was almost gritty, but not in a way that's as unpleasant as that makes it sound. 

I will absolutely make this again.  I imagine the addition of bananas would be tasty as well (because, well, it is banana bread), but it's good to know that substitutes make this a delicious and versatile recipe I'd be proud to serve guests.

I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in how this came out.  The end result was a nice sized bread, but dry.  Lots of flavors going on and the family that tried this stated they had a hard time picking out the banana flavors, and it seemed the flavors were stepping on one another.  It tastes good but for my dry version, the saving grace was the icing.  Without it, it would need something like a scoop of ice cream to make it edible.  I'd probably make this again but remove the cinnamon, add 1/3 cup of sour cream and possibly a 3rd small banana to get the moisture content up and add some banana flavor back into this banana bread.

Ohhhh I'm so happy !  This bread is delicious .   I have to say  my glaze didnt look the glaze in the photo but that is not an issue at  all (read  and re-read directions twice).   The glaze made this bread so moist. ..big hit with my boyfriend and coworkers.  I will make this again for sure!

I made these as mini muffins since I was feeding a bunch of boys. I liked the recipe a lot but the boys were not happy with these and asked me to stick to banana bread with chocolate chips, but definitely keep doing mini muffins and they are easier to pop and eat...

Our family really enjoyed it. As several others have stated, you can change up the creamer which was what we did so we could use what we had in the house. A good recipe that will be used again in the future. Might have to work on the glaze a bit more.

It was a coffee-chocolate-banana bread for us ( replaced the creamer with same amount of milk chocolate vermicelli ) as I had no creamer. But I think that this good recipe is allowing little changes without suffering at all. The reason of the 4 stars comes from the icing : for some reason it worked for me only after I took off 1/4 of the butter. Also watch the cooking time : exactly following the recipe at first the center of the cake stayed wet, so I let it in the oven 15 mn more but then Id say it was 5 mn too much... Anyway all in all it was a very interesting change for a banana bread and I shall try it again.

Nice, rich flavor. I didn't include the banana because I wanted a strong coffee taste. Also, I didn't add the salt, which is usual for me. For the creamer, I used caramel macchiato from Coffee Mate. The cake was dense, which was what I wanted. I made the topping too and it soaked the top. This is  good for people looking for something different from the sugary pastries available everywhere. Perhaps next time I bake this, I'll add the banana.

Very good recipe.....
I'm out of commission (broken ankle) since planning to make this bread so I was missing just one ingredient the macchiato creamer....
I subbed mudslide creamer for it and actually had a supply of caramel used in making Kansas City BBQ sauce....
It turned out very well.  I realized too late that I used too much salt but still just fine....
Very high five stars....

I scaled to 48 servings, which yielded 40 largish muffins that baked at 375 for 20 minutes.
I used white whole wheat flour for the all purpose, 2 1/2 tbsp baking powder and 2 tsps baking soda for the leavening,  melted butter for the oil and halved the oil amount, omitted the salt as it was salted butter, doubled the bananas, used brown sugar for the white, and 1/4 the instant coffee as I used espresso powder. 
I skipped the topping because I was worried it would be too sweet, we enjoyed the muffins a nice flavour change from the usual.

Delicious, I added walnuts because I put nuts in all my quick breads. Some of the yeast breads too, we love nuts. We don't use instant coffee so I didn't have any.

Delicious.  I made it with 3 packs of Starbucks Via instant coffee packs.  When making the glaze, stir continuously to prevent separation.  Let cool a little and then pour on top.

Absolutely delicious!  I just made this for the second time this week. I used Namaste gluten free flour, used all spice in place of the cinnamon, and used Earth Balance dairy free, soy free sticks in place of the butter for the glaze. My banana bread usually runs out gooey in the middle, but his baked up perfectly, and you'd never know it was an allergy friendly version.

I made this yesterday, and it was very good. I felt like I couldn't taste the coffee creamer, and my husband said he could kinda taste it. I might try more next time, or a different flavor. I had a problem with the glaze as well, it kept separating so I waited till the bread was cool, made the glaze and poured it on as soon as it was made. I also dug out some of the middle, so that some of the glaze went into the bread as well. I will make this again for sure!

The banana bread was fabulous . Since the only liquid coffee creamer I had was Italian Sweet Cream, that's what I used. Instead of instant coffee granules, I used a mocha instant espresso mix.
Now for the icing - It was a disaster! It turned into a gooey, buttery mess. I salvaged it by adding in powdered sugar. 
All in all, it turned out great!

This is ok! Nothing about it stood out. I used Starbucks via coffee packets. Had a bit of a coffee taste, no caramel taste and not enough banana flavor.

Too, too sweet. And I couldn't taste the caramel flavor at all. I won't give up, though, now that I've read Dianne's comments.  I do love caramel.

This is ok. I do not taste coffee or caramel in the muffin. I did not do the glaze which might have helped. I have better banana bread recipe that I will stick to.

OMG, so delicious! I couldn't find the caramel macchiato coffee creamer so I used toffee vanilla instead, yummy! Can't wait to make it again with the caramel creamer.
