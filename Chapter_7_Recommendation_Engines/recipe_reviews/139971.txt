I had never had beet greens before and I loved them in this recipe! I used red onion and it looked so nice I will serve it to guests. Tastes like strong spinach. I am thinking of all of the beet greens I have waisted before......and all of the nutrients that went right in the trash!

Let me say, WONDERFUL! I bought three large organic beets. I added 3 scallions, 1/2 med. onion, 5 cloves of garlic chopped, all the greens, and followed the recipe with a little more organic olive oil added. It was a great dish! I will serve this again, definately a favorite. Watch out to be red handed when you take off the skins. Even the baked stems were tasty

I really love beets but had never eaten the greens before. This recipe was delicious! I also added finely chopped cabbage after the onions were carmelized and a little bit of balsamic vinegar.

My two favorite ways to describe dinner: cheap & easy! This was awesome! I didn't want to wait so long so I peeled & diced the beets then roasted them. I tossed in a few diced carrots and radishes too. The combination is great. Next time I think I'll add some whole garlic cloves too. Love it! You have to try beet greens!

This warm beet with greens and carmelized onions was flavorful and a nice change. Great recipe. Next time, I will only wilt the greens and discard the stems.

I love how simple this recipe is.  I was skeptical about the greens, but they are suprisingly tasty.  The whole family loved them.

Very easy and tasty! I added some garlic and a touch of cider vinegar at the end! I will definitely make this one again! For those of you who complained that the beets were hard to peel here's a little trick. When the beets are done roasting in the oven wrap them in aluminum foil to let them cool. The foil holds in just the right amount of steam. When you open them up put on some rubber gloves and just rub the skin off right over the trashcan. I also leave the gloves on when slicing them up. Keeps your hands from staining red.

Wow delicious! I had never made beets before and when I received them in my food pod I tried this recipe first-simple, easy and YUM! Even my husband who does not eat anything green ate this! Thanks!

Wanted to try something different. First time cooking with beets (which I hated as  child!) This was a really good recipe, most people liked the greens better than the beets! The only thing I changed was I added some spinach leaves because there weren't enough beet leaves in my bunches to me. I also added a couple of splashes of balsamic after the greens were done to try and bring out the sweetness of the beets.

Really delicious, though a bit time consuming (the cutting and peeling and whatnot).  I added some diced chicken breast and halved raw almonds at the end of the cooking process then tossed each serving in a small (1 tsp) of balsamic vinegar.  Holy moly that's a tasty snack.    (I also tossed in some halved roasted brussels sprouts and leftover green beans 'cause I had 'em.  They added texture and flavor aplenty.)

I had beets in the garden I wanted to use and found this recipe. I really wanted to like this but just didn't. Maybe it's just me because I have never eaten beets before except for pickled.

This is something I’m quite familiar with and have always loved.  The difference with this recipe, for me, is the preparation – roasting the beets vs. boiling them.  Both work of course, but it sure seemed that roasting them better preserved their vibrant color.  Unfortunately, however, they were more difficult to peel than when boiled.  It also was a lengthy process, taking much longer than I expected (delaying my dinner).  I added some fresh minced garlic along with the onion, just because I typically do.

Yummy! Made it with carrots (didn't have a lot of beets, so these were filler). Small beets took 30-40 minutes. Served with a splash of balsalmic vinegar - yum!

Outstanding! I just ate the whole plate! Did add garlic to the onions and a sprinkle of kosher salt when done. Doctor Oz says beets are good for you!

Very tasty recipe. I belong to a veggie co-op and had some dandelion greens too. I blanched the greens in salted water first, added some sugar after the onions were sauteed and finished with a bit of red wine vinegar.

This recipe came out really good. I think it was missing something though - not sure what - just think that another complimentary flavor would have been beneficial. Maybe I will try with bacon grease next time instead of olive oil for sauteing the greens.

Peeling the beets was tough after they were roasted because I had to do it with utensils instead of being able to hold them. I think next time I will try pealing them first. Or, maybe check to see if beat peals are edible, like potato peals...

Thanks for the recipe! The kids and husband loved it.

While I do like the simplicity as well as the result, I must say that my beets took waaaay longer to cook. After 90 mins in the oven, they were still not easily pierced by a fork - but they were still very good, nonetheless.

Plan your time accordingly. Finishing them up in the oven early won't hurt... but if yours take as long as mine, it could delay your dinner plans.

Very easy, pretty tasty. Not mind-blowing or anything, but I thought this was a very satisfying side dish and a good way to make use of beet greens. I made it as called for, with no extra seasonings beyond pepper, but it benefited greatly from a little garlic too. I think in future, though, I'll probably just save beet greens for soups or to put in lasagnas or something like that. But this was a good introduction to beet greens, so thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! This has opened my eyes to beets as I try to expand my vegetable horizons. Next time I might try microwaving the beets like potatoes in the microwave to save a little time with the roasting.

My family really liked this recipe!  I am part of a co-op and received beets this week.  I've never made them before and was very very pleased with the results!  I added cabbage, carrots, and scallions because I had them in the fridge.  I do not think I would put the cabbage in again as I found it make the recipe a bit bitter.  However, the carrots and shallots were AMAZING in the recipe!  Aesthetically, it is a beautiful dish.  It will definitely be added to our normal go-to dishes!

Tastes good, but an awful lot of work for a side dish. Great to find a use for all those greens - thanks!

First time using the greens. Came out great. I cut the stems in small pieces and put in pan w/ the onions. Chopped the greens and added last.

This is perfect! I used red onion b/c it was all I had. I don't know if it made a difference, but this is the most delicious beet recipe I've tried.

This was very good and Bob liked it a lot. Got us out of the broccoli rut. I used golden beets. I roasted the beets in the morning so it would be quicker in the evening to put this together.

I love beets and all greens (collards, spinach, turnips etc) but this way of preparing greens was a big no for me.  No flavor, blah texture. I should have went with my instinct knowing that this was lacking in many elements that makes greens so tasty like bacon or hambone, vinegar, garlic, sugar and a long cooking time.

I always try to pick beets with nice fresh greens because I love the greens too but I never thought to put them together...Delicious. I added rough chopped garlic and served with a sprinkling of gorgonzola. I ate it hot and just tried the leftovers cold. Delicious both ways! I added toasted almond slices to the cold salad. Yum! this is my new beet recipe! Pretty too.

This recipe was great! It was my first time making beets. The only thing I did different was I chopped up the stems, cooked them until tender-crisp in salted boiling water, and then added them along with the leaf greens. I don't like to waste and they taste great along with the rest of the ingredients in this recipe.

Excellent very flavorful I added more fresh garlic, and garlic power, red onions I sliced the beets before I baked them, speeds up the baking cycle.

I made this to go with dinner tonight. Not a do over for my family. I am a huge fan of caramelized onions and beets, but found the beet greens to have an odd bitter flavor. I also didn't much care for peeling the beets after they were cooked, not fun. Next time I will substitute spinach for the greens after having peeled and cubes the beets before roasting them. Points on incorporating all of the beet though.

I looked a recipe for beets because my husband wanted to try them. To be honest, I had very low expectations because beets always tasted like dirt to me, but figured what the heck?  I followed your instructions but read what other folks did and added green cabbage, onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar. I actually coated the beets in olive oil, mixed with salt, pepper and white balsamic vinegar before roasting. Then I added regular balsamic I eFax to the greens and cabbage mixture while sautéing. I have to say that they were delicious! My kids kept coming down while I was cooking to see what smelled so fabulous and when I told them, beets, they turned their noses up. Curiosity got the best of them in the end and there were no more beets left by the time my chicken was cooked. Thank you for this amazing recipe! We no longer hate beets! ???

Growing up, my mother boiled beets often and I hated them.  Because my husband keeps asking for beets, I looked to Allrecipes for direction.  This recipe was great!  Because I live in Arizona, I quartered the beets and roasted them on the barbeque to avoid heating up the house.  The only other alteration was to add turmeric (my current go-to spice) and a little garlic. I did not peel the beets at all, just rinsed them well. The result was great and I love the idea that every part of the beet was used!  My only regret was that my son finished off the leftovers so I did not get a second 'go'.  I bought more beets this week and will try it again.

We really liked this. Alwys looking for new ways to use vegetables. We grew beets in our garden so we  had fresh greens as well.Since I don't use beet greens often I needed anew recipe. This was really good.  I was also making chicken broth this day so I used some in cooking to deglaze the pan after sautéing the onions and 1 cup of chopped stems I included. Added a pinch of sugar and a splash of vinegar at the end and it was oh so good. Thanks so much for this recipe I will use it often!

This is really good- particularly with fresh beets from the Farmers market!  I added some garlic, and would recommend adding a little wine or liquid to the greens when cooking them...before adding the beets back in.  Husband loved it!  :)

I had never eaten yellow beets, or beet greens before. With this recipe, both tasted delicious! I am not an expert cook, but this was easy enough, I feel confident that I could make this for family/company.

I have never had beet greens and have only eaten pickled beets.  I followed the recipe with no changes and I loved it.  I like pickled beets but roasted beets and greens are way better.
It wasn't easy to tell if I had gotten all the skin off, but since this was the first time I cooked them, I figured the next time I make them, I'll know what I'm doing.  Easy to make and worth it.

This recipe is great as is! I've made it several times, it makes the beets and their greens taste great. This is my go to recipe for beets if I happen to pick some up at the farmers market.

I love this recipe and make it often.  For those who are looking for a little extra zing, try sautéing the onion with a couple slices of bacon, and add crumbled feta or goat cheese when serving.  Toasted walnuts or pine nuts are also a good addition.  This is a full meal for us with deviled eggs and grapefruit slices for a garnish.

Really liked the idea of eating the entire vegetable instead of throwing out the greens. Took the suggestions of others and added garlic to the greens. Wondering whether sprinkling it with goat cheese crumbles before serving would add visual interest and nice flavor. My issue:  peeling the beets after roasting. There has to be an easier way.

A little messy to peel, but then again, this is the first time I have ever cooked with beets.
I felt it was missing a little acid, but will definitely make again: maybe with a splash of apple cider: any ideas fellow cooks?

This was SO delicious!  I used beets and a small red onion from my garden, and some small garden carrots.  I sauteed the onions and greens in butter instead of olive oil; otherwise kept true to the recipe.  Served with roast pork tenderloin and a salad.  We loved it!

I am adding this to my keep list. I had goat cheese on hand if people wanted to sprinkle a little on top but did not need it. I just prefer beets paired with goat cheese.

Loved the recipe. Bought organic beets with greens at the Farmer's market.  First time to try eating the greens.  I cut off the stem and stem rib from the leaves.   I used coconut oil instead of olive.  Also added some butter.

I'm pretty inexperienced with beets, so this may take a second go for me. I had two small and one large, so I tried cooking them for 30 minutes - they probably could have done with at least 40. Unfortunately, the greens had wilted before I had a chance to use them, so I substituted kale and added a bit of goat cheese. Very tasty!

Enjoyed this so much.  Several steps and can't make it in a rush, but no matter, it was sooo good.  I used gloves to cut and peel after cooled.  Thanks for that tip!  A keeper

I didn't want to wait for them to cool off so I peeled them and cut into wedges before roasting. My teenage daughter loved it.

I thought I hated beets but I was completely wrong.  I, too, peeled the beets beforehand and roasted them sans peel.  I also added some feta cheese while they were roasting (and a touch after they came out.)  I sauteed the greens with some onions, put it all together, and lo and behold - I'm a beet lover.  I would say my face is red from embarrassment, but it's more than likely beet juice.  My husband's already requested that this be put on regular summer dinner rotation!

I loved its simplicity and flavor!  I served it as a side dish for the rest of the family, and ate it as a main dish and added crumbled goat cheese to the top of mine.

I had only eaten pickled beats, but I got beats in my bountiful basket so i went searching for a recipe. This one is simple, easy, and tasty! The greens were lovely and the roasted beats were wonderful. We will definitely do this again!

I have tried SO MANY ways to eat beets and this was the recipe that won my affection to beets. It is incredible! Now I want to grow beets in my garden just so I can eat them more often.
