Simple and great tasting. I can't believe I have never come across this before. I plan to make many more times. Great for dipping tortilla chips; can also see using as a salad dressing and condiment for tacos, chicken, fajitas. Next time I will try putting in a little cilantro.

I needed a change from my go-to lo-cal dip, No-Guilt Zesty Ranch Dip. This was a welcome change. I used the dry ranch seasoning mix from this site(minus the salt) and used FF sour cream. Very good.  I might stir in a little hot sauce to make it a little warmer for my taste.

Of all the allrecipes.com recipes I have used this is by far my favorite!!  Easy, quick, inexpensive, versitil (I'm a better cook than speller, obviously).  We use fiesta dressing on most everything, except ice cream. Ok, maybe that's taking it a bit far.  But seriously, we put it on baked chicken and fish, tacos, chips, raw veggies, steamed broccoli, even use it as a sandwich spread.   And if you are watching your carbs, it has very few!  Rotel makes a variety of diced chili and tomato flavors (Italian, Mexican, etc) to extend your choices even more!  You really must try this!!

Very good.  I used this as both a dip for a veggie tray at our NYE party, and the leftovers the next day as a salad dressing.  Got great reviews at the party!  Thanks!

Pretty good! Its a little thick to use for a typical salad but when mixed in with a large taco salad, it was pretty good. Perfect amount of kick. I could see this be good for dipping veggies, which I may try next time. Thanks Marsha.

Fabulous as a veggie dip! I won't change a thing when using it for this purpose. A little thick, however, for a dressing. For my salad, to spice it up a little bit, I made the following additions: garlic and mustard powders, onion salt, splashes of lemon juice, vinegar, and worcestershire, and thinned with a little milk.

This is really good with a taco salad... I use a hot salsa because I like spicier food!!  I have also served it by itself as a dip with vegetables!

This is so good!  You can even use fat free or light sour cream for a low-cal dip with vegetables.  I got lots of compliments!

I made this with the hot chiles and tomatoes. Delicious for a dipping sauce for vegetables. For the salad dressing though, I wouldn't drain the tomatoes and chiles and it wouldn't be quite so think.

Thankyou, thankyou I have searched for a yummy mexican ranch dressing and this is it. I've already made two batches of it and will be making a third tonight. We've used it as a dip for tortilla chips and on a grilled chicken sandwich.

Yum! I'll be thinning it with buttermilk, but I like the flavor. Will be awesome on a taco salad! I used Fat Free Sour Cream to take away a bit of the guilt.

This was very good and simple. Perfect topping for a spicy taco salad, as the sour cream cools it off a bit. I used light sour cream and think I will add a splash of hot pepper sauce to liven it up a tad. I plan on using this again, thanks! UPDATE: I made this again using salsa, light sour cream and a couple of dashes of Cholula   .........THAT is worth 5 stars!!!

Very good.  I added garlic powder (as I do to most everything) and used lite sour cream.  I think this was MUCH better after it sat in the refrigerator a few days.

Yummy! My whole family enoyed this, including 9 year old who usually will not eat any type of tomatoe, even canned. First time followed the recipe exactly and used it as dressing. However, I recently added a can of refried beans, green onion, and cilantro and served it as a dip. Very good too.

This was really good - quite spicy though (I used Rotel brand, and used only 1/2 of the can).  Note that you can use fat-free sour cream and it's not even noticed!  Thanks for the recipe!
