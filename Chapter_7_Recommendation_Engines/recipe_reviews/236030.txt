I am giving this a five for taste - absolutely delicious filling.  I put the cheese inside instead of outside just as a preference.  I made this recipe as stated except I used fresh chicken breast because I had some on hand I needed to use.  My husband loved this.  It didnt come out as pretty, I used pillsbury crescent dough sheets.  I got tired of making the crescents so made balls instead.  I have filling left over(only used one crescent) so I am making a calzone for dinner. Will make again!

Delicious! I did make a few changes (below). Everyone was raving during the New Years party, my husband commented at the end of the night AND next morning about how good they were, and my mom called to tell me how much my dad liked them and that when he went back for more, they were gone.  My changes were: 1. pulled meat from leftover buffalo wings (meat only, skin tossed).  2. Replaced chopped onion with chopped celery. 3. used half the cream cheese and added chunky blue cheese. 4. didn't stir in hot sauce. ..dribbled a little on crescent roll dough first, then added mixture, and rolled up. 5. omitted cheese on top. 6. didn't serve with dipping sauce. I forgot to, but it certainly didn't need it.  Will definitely make again....I think I'll be requested to.

This was amazing!  I cut recipe in half due to using Grands crescent rolls.  Absolutely delicious.

Made these today.. I took advice of others and put the shredded cheddar in the filling instead of on top. I also used fresh chicken, not canned (personal preference) and canned biscuit dough instead of crescent dough (forgot to buy crescents). I split each biscuit in half, flattened them, added filling to the middle, pulled the dough up over the filling & twisted it to make a purse. I also reserved about a quarter of the “sauce” before adding the cream cheese and chicken, which we used as a dipping sauce. We loved them so much I can’t wait to make them again! Next time, I will brush them with beaten egg white instead of melted butter because I think it will improve both the taste (the dough was very soft because the butter soaked into it) and I prefer the look of a shiny top. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

Great recipe!  I paid attention to the reviews and doubled the amount of crescent rolls (4 tubes).  We filled all 4 and still had some filling leftover, which we used for dip.  I added 1chopped celery stick, and omitted the ranch dressing.  I also put cheddar cheese inside and on top of each bite, and found that it was just as easy to roll the filling up in the precut crescents, rather than rolling and cutting into rounds. These bites were a big hit with all our guests and I will definitely make again.  Thank you!

Excellent!  The only change I made was using Mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  I had extra filling so I baked it and dipped crackers in that.  Very versatile

Yummy recipe, but heads up that you actually need 3 packages of crescent rolls.  Otherwise you get 24 appetizers with lots of filling left over.

Really good, I added a bunch of red onion and used chicken that I cooked in a slow cooker overnight and pulled apart the next day for this.... I just can't bring myself to ever use chicken from a can

great recipe - went over real well at the pre-Superbowl party - I varied the spice mixture - the milder ones I used a Sweet chili sauce and for the hotter ones I used Siracha sauce (and lots of it).
