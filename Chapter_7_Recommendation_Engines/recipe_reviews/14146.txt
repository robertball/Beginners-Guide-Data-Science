Such humble ingredients for such big flavor!  Pared down the fat content in the dressing using low fat mayo and 2% milk and added onion powder for an extra boost!  Left out the salt as the bacon provided enough without adding extra....  This is a great salad to use up cherry tomatoes that seem to flourish profusely in the summer garden.  Only addition was an avocado which was the perfect finishing touch!

I didn't use a whole pound of bacon, just half of the package that was left after I made meatloaf. I used a mixture of fat free sour cream and lowfat mayonnaise and a spring green mix. We all enjoyed this a lot, especially my oldest who has a real thing for bacon. He takes after his mother. ;) Next time, I think I'd just use a homemade ranch dressing.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! What can I say, but YUMMY! I did make a few changes to this recipe, but nothing really out there. With my husband on a diabetic diet, I immediately knew the regular mayo had to go. I replaced it with Hellmans Just 2 Good, used skim milk, and added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the dressing. I used a mix of Romaine, Spinach and Red Leaf lettuce, Halved cherry tomatoes and in place of the bacon (that pesky diabetic diet again) I used one bag of the Hormel Real Bacon Pieces. I also tossed in 1/4 cup of finely shredded sharp cheddar.  It's also great with shredded or sliced chicken breast added, it makes it taste like a chicken club salad.Even my extremely picky 6 year old loved it. Wonderful!!

I made this recipe for a holiday get together and it was a hit!  I did modify the recipe a little based on others reviews.  First, I baked the bacon on a foil-lined cookie sheet at 425 degrees for 15 minutes.  It took 2 batches to cook 1lb of bacon.  Baking the bacon seemed to work well for this recipe b/c I was able to do some of the prep work while the bacon was cooking without having to constantly check and turn the bacon.  Second, I used 1 cup Hellmans lite mayo and 2 tbsp daisy sour cream.  I added garlic and onion powders then added just enough 1% milk to get a good dressing-like consistency.  Without the milk I thought the dressing would be too thick.  I chopped 4 roma tomatoes and placed them on a plate with paper towels to soak up the juices.  I chopped and peeled 1/2 cucumber.  I used 1 and 1/2 heads of romaine lettuce and gave a generous sprinkle of finely shredded cheddar cheese.  I mixed the lettuce, cucumbers and cheese in the serving bowl.  I placed my crumbled bacon in a ziplock and my chopped tomato in another zip lock.  I placed a lid over my dressing and took a bag of Texas Toast garlic croutons with me.  Once at the party, I threw the bacon and tomato in the bowl, tossed with most of the dressing and sprinkled croutons on top and viola! As a side note, when I tasted the dressing before I put in all together, it didn't taste all that spectacular, but mixed with all the ingredients it was delicious.  Also I think only real bacon (not precooked/bacon bits) wi

I didn't expect this recipe to be a big hit since the ingredients are so basic but it was. Everyone liked it and asked me to bring it again at the next gathering. I've been asked to email the recipe to people. You must use Romaine or Spring mix or Mediterranean mix. Iceberg does not work at all.

This is an awesome tasting recipe but the fat content is terrible. Use Hellman's low fat mayo (1/2 cup instead of 3/4) and mix in some low fat sour cream and a bit more milk (adjust to desired thickness) as well for a fresher, healthier taste. Use less bacon and substitute chicken breast.

I made this for a baby shower---it was good. Added grape tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, avocado, extra bacon, and adjusted the dressing as others suggested--garlic powder with parsley, sour cream, Miracle Whip, milk, Whipping cream, and shredded cheddar cheese. used store-bought croutons. Baby spinach and cut-up Romaine lettuce added a nice texture. Great for summer.

I cooked 3/4 pound of bacon in the microwave, then crumbled it using the blender.  Then I poured out the bacon bits and mixed them thoroughly with the chopped tomatoes so the bacon and tomatoes could flavor each other.  There were lots of bacon bits still clinging to the side of the blender, which I then used to make the dressing.  For the dressing, I used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and 2 heaping regular (non measuring) teaspoons of sour cream but no milk (I did not need any additional salt).  I also used slightly less garlic powder than the recipe called for, even though I LOVE garlic.  I used some bagged romaine lettuce this time, but next time I will use green leaf.  This was really, really good!  The mayo/sour cream/bacon bits dressing was delicious.  I kept the lettuce, tomato and bacon mixed together, but added the dressing and croutons at serving time.  EXCELLENT!!

This is very similar to a recipe my sister gave me. She owned a restaurant about 18 years ago. We never measure anything except the sauce. Just use own judgement. We used  about a head of iceburg lettuce, fried up some bacon and crumbled, added some cooked chopped up chicken(can be light or dark meat), diced tomatoes. The dressing was 1-2 cups mayo mixed with 1/3-1/4 cup bbq sauce. Add 1 tsp. lemon juice.(use own judgement on how much dressing to use). Minced onion is optional(I don't use it). Add the dressing just before eating. This a little variation from this recipe and it is so good! Thanks D.L.!

I enjoyed this salad, but did make some changes after viewing the reviews from other people.  I used 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of onion powder, 1 tsp. of oregano and a hefty dose of freshly ground pepper.  Thanks Mooney for a great recipe.  Definately a keeper

Delicious! And being that BLT's are great sandwiches it would make sense that with the proper variation they'd make a great salad. Well, logic did prove correct and this was very good, quick, and easy. All I added was a little shredded Swiss cheese over top. This is a perfect summertime salad when tomatoes are fresh from the garden!

loved this recipe!  Even my small children are eating their salads.  This is great for hurried moms.  Moms who want a lighter summer entree.  Also, moms that want greens in their kids but need to  fool them into eating it with a name thats a favorite with most.  BLT's-we all love 'em.

The taste was good.  I took this salad to a picnic and I was disappointed that it wilted so quickly.  I wait until just before serving to add the dressing and it was still mush 10 minutes later. I will not be making again.

This is now my husband's favorite salad and nice company fare as well.  It's quick and easy to make.  I use a 3oz. package of Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits in lieu of having to cook bacon.  I also used half the amount of garlic as I felt the garlic was just a bit overwhelming.  Once I added minced red onion and it was excellent.

Excellent salad, and super crowd pleaser!  Everyone raved over this salad, and the dressing was so simple and delicious.  Very quick prep with the exception of cooking the bacon.  I'm too frugal to buy the pre-cooked stuff.  I used my electric skillet which fit most of the pound of bacon.   I'm doing a low-carb thing, so I served the croutons on the side. It gave me all the pleasure of a BLT without the bread.  For the dressing I used low fat mayo and 1% milk. I highly recommend this recipe.  Oh, I added fresh mushrooms, too.

This is the PERFECT summer slad, it felt like summer today so we made it!  I used a romaine and baby spinach mixture and used halved grape tomatoes and half of the bacon called for in the recipe.  It was fabulous and nothing was left in the bowl!

We loved this salad! I cooked the bacon in the oven until crisp. For the dressing I used 3 cloves of garlic, which I minced first in the food processor before add the other ingred. Took the tip from TALCOTT and added 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp oregano.

I thought this was a very tasty recipe, but the dressing was just a little bit bland and watery.  Next time I may try adding some sour cream and some more pepper, but I liked it the way it was, too.

This is one of my most requested recipes!  I've been making it for several years now.  I usually chop the bacon up first before frying and sometimes only use 1/2 pound.  I don't add salt to the dressing as the bacon has enough to season the entire salad.

I was very disappointed in this salad.  I was hoping it would taste like the BLT salad at the Waterfront in Cinci.  No such luck.  The dressing was too runny and kind of bland.  It needs more of a kick.  The salad was very easy to make, but not a hit with my family.  We'll stick with the real BLT.

We liked this OK, with the exception of the garlic powder. I don't know about you, but I don't put garlic or garlic powder on my BLTs. So why put it in a BLT salad?? As others have noted, be sure to serve dressing on the side, as it goes from well-dressed to soggy before you know it. Don't leave out the salt, which will save the dressing from blandness. Great summer salad when tomatoes are at their best and can hold their own against the bacon.

AWESOME!  I made about half the dressing, and it had a fabulous flavor in the salad.  I used a glass bowl and hand whisk instead of a processor and it turned out fine.

I told my hubby that I was making a salad and baked potato for our dinner.  Boy, was he surprised!!  He loved the BLT salad and the dressing was spectacular!  I don't care for mayo, and now I am craving that dressing!  I used thick sliced bacon and made my own croutons with a sour dough round...  yummy!!  My husband is already asking for this again and he never eats salads!  Thanks D. L. Mooney!

This tasted just like a BLT! The only downside (WHICH WAS MY FAULT) was not using good tomatoes; I used grape tomatoes, which are usually fantastic...but this batch of tomatoes wasn't. I'll try it again in the summer when tomatoes are in season!

My husband didn't like this salad, but what does he know!  I thought it was delicious.  I added a little onion powder to the dressing to give it a bit more flavor.  This is a keeper!

I make this salad all the time, but i do not use the croutons, they get too soggy, i use tri colored spiral pasta instead! i also seed the tomatoes, dressing holds together so much better. Splurge and definitely use WHOLE milk, it is only a 1/4 cup and really makes a better dressing!  Enjoy!

Very easy & tasty.  Used light mayo, skim milk, turkey bacon, and homemade croutons.  Left out the salt as it wasn't needed.  Was able to wisk the dresing, so no need for a blender or food processor.

Yummy!  I stupidly read this too quickly and thought it called for iceburg.  The iceburg was sort of bitter, but that's not the recipe's fault, so it still gets 5 stars.  Yummy homemade ranch type dressing with bacon.. how can you go wrong? :) Delicious!

This is Tremendous! 
I cooked the bacon, and then crumbled it using the blender. Then I poured out the bacon bits and mixed them thoroughly with the chopped tomatoes so the bacon and tomatoes could flavor each other. There were lots of bacon bits still clinging to the side of the blender, which I then used to make the dressing. It didn't need any  milk and I cut the mayo to 1/2 cup and used 2 heaping TBS of sour cream. The mayo/sour cream/bacon bits dressing is scrumptious. I kept the lettuce, tomato and bacon mixed together, but added the dressing and croutons at serving time.

This was yummy! I originally went looking for a recipe for my leftover bacon and figured maybe there'd be a BLT salad. Sure enough!...And how delicious it is! I added onion salt to the dressing as someone else had suggested. I also just used a bag of romaine lettuce instead of shredded. I forgot about the croutons but they weren't missed.
I'd use the food processor to crumble the bacon, remove that and then use it to make the dressing...there'll be little bacon crumblies left and you can get every bit of that yummy bacon flavor! This is a keeper!

This salad had wonderful flavor and really did taste like a BLT sandwich.  Our 2 1/2 year old ate it up too.  I only rated the quickness area a little low because of the time it took to fry all that bacon.  I will definately be making this again.  Took some for lunch the next day and just kept the croutons and dressing separate until ready to eat.

I haven't tried it yet but it sounds great. A tip for cooking bacon. Line cookie sheet with aluminum foil, place bacon slices on cookie sheet, bake in 400 degree oven (do not preheat oven). Should be fully cooked in 10-15 minutes. No turning, no splatter burns, bacon cooks evenly and doesn't curl up and cleanup is easy.

Yum! 5 stars after I totally tweaked the dressing.  No mayo at all! Instead I used ff plain greek yogurt, 1/4 cup skim milk and whipped in fresh lemon juice till the consistancy was right. Then I did add some sugar to give the right "tang" of sweet and tart! I also added cucumbers to the salad and quartered cherry tomatoes.

I made this salad with nonfat mayo and skim milk. I added a little more milk to make it thinner. And I also used turkey bacon. So, even with those low fat "tweaks" it was a 4 star recipe. Probably would have been a 5 with the higher fat original version of the recipe!

Very good salad. One reviewer said omit the salt - don't. It needs it. The dressing needed a little more kick. Next time I'll add something else. One son wanted more bacon. I used thick bacon and I think thin might be better because it seems to be crispier.

This salad is stellar. Mmmm. Disclaimer: I must admit I didn't exactly follow the recipe. So my version was stellar. I only used about 1/4 cup mayo and 1/2 cup plain yogurt.

OMG--this was the biggest hit of the party.  I trippled this recipe only to have to make another two servings ... I can't tell you how many compliments I received on this recipe.  Thank you thank you thank you!  I made [a good amount of] dressing earlier in the day and used fresh thick bacon; it really gave this salad exceptional flavor.

One of the few times I give a recipe five stars! It was a quick and delicious summer meal we all enjoyed. Only thing I did different was to use precooked bacon, which cut down on prep time. Thanks for sharing.

This was an awesome recipe. I made the dressing ahead of time so that it was chilled and the ingredients had a chance to blend.  My husband just loved it.

Makes for a light and refreshing meal!

This was deeeeeelicious! Way east and fast!

I had a bag of pre-cleaned and chopped salad greens in the fridge so I used that.  I also had about 1/4 cup of GOOD Bleu Cheese dressing so I substituted that for part of the mayo.  I also tossed in a tiny bit of minced onion.   I followed another cook’s advice and I mixed the tomatoes, onion, and bacon together so they could get “happy” for a few hours.  What I really liked about this was that I was able to have it ready to GO when my company arrived.  I had all the components of the salad ready to assemble a few hours before I needed them.  About 5 min before we pulled the steaks off the BBQ I just tossed it alll together, and added the croutons.  YUM-O!  It freed me up to enjoy my company which was great!

This ercipe was really tasty.  To cut down on the sodium, i substituted sodium free bacon.  I also used miracle whip light instead of mayo.  It was awesome.  Even my kids had seconds!!!!

This was way easy, as I bought precut romaine lettuce and precooked bacon.  I didnt use a food processor to mix dressing, and it turned out fine.  I used low fat mayo, tasted great!  I actually bought the croutons, but forgot to put them in...we really didnt miss them.  I will make this again...very very easy.

What a great recipe!  I have also added a couple cups of diced turkey and some grated swiss cheese and served it to a group of ladies.  How delightful!

Took this to a 4th of July potluck where there were a lot of other salads and quite a lot of it got eaten up, so it must have been liked. I thought the dressing was excellent though 1 teaspoon of garlic powder is WAY too much for my taste. I used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder along with a couple of teaspoons of minced dried onions. With all the reviews saying the salad got soggy fast, I left out the majority of the milk in the dressing, using about 2 tablespoons and substituted sour cream for the rest. I also seeded my tomatoes before chopping them. My only complaint, and I think it is my fault, is that there was too much lettuce so you really didn't get much of a taste of the bacon and tomato in each bite. I had scaled all of the ingredients for a batch and a half of the dressing and bacon but I used two heads of romaine. Next time I'll use less lettuce.

I thought this was good.  It was very easy to make.  The only thing that took any time, was cooking the bacon.  Once I made the dressing I threw it in the pan I had cooked the bacon in (I had already drained the grease) and scrapped up the little bacon bits stuck to the bottom.  I thought there was a little too much dressing, so next time I will toss a little in at a time, instead of the whole batch.

I, too, used turkey bacon to lower fat content but it just wasn't the same. Next time I will splurge on regular bacon. I added a little lemon juice to the dressing too. Tip for adding dressing to salad: Once salad is in serving bowl, pour the dressing only around the inside edge of the bowl so it flows to the bottom of the bowl, then toss. Add croutons after dressing is added to retain crispness. Good comfort food.

I made this for my mother's club meeting and a smaller version (using vegetarian bacon) for those of us staying in last night. My father hungrily eyed the progress as he prepared to leave for his meeting. It was a big hit with everyone. To suit my family's taste, I made extra dressing and reduced the amount of vinegar to 1 Tablespoon per cup of mayonnaise (the initial result was far too tart for our taste). I also added a bit of sugar and a great deal of grated Parmesan to the dressing. The fresh basil is KEY in achieving the special taste. The vegetarian version was equally delicious. This recipe makes a lot of salad but don't be surprised if all is devoured! My nephew declared it "Delicious!"

A delicious, fast and filling recipe for hot summer evenings when you don't want to cook a lot. Making your own "croutons" makes the difference.

This sounded good, not to mention ideal, for my supper tonight. It's light yet substantive, refreshing, easy, fast, and with  minimal clean-up.  Besides, who doesn't love a BLT?  It just follows that, in theory at least, you'd love this salad. But I wasn't impressed with the dressing, which tasted too simply of thinned out mayonnaise. I knew I wouldn't enjoy the salad with this, so I did some doctoring -  a little chili sauce, a little horseradish and mmmmm, now we're talking!

The flavor of this salad was great.  It is high in fat, but we didn't need to use nearly the amount of dressing recommended (we maybe used half).  We made this about 10 minutes before we served it, and it was starting to get a little soggy by the time we ate, so I'd say to mix the dressing right before serving.

The bacon and tomatoes are delicious together. Next time, I may add bit of sour cream to the dressing and up the garlic a bit. Enjoyed this for dinner tonight.

I used Greek yogurt instead of mayo, and turkey bacon instead of pork bacon. Absolutely delicious, and a great way to use leftover tomatoes.

Very good, and I'll make it again. However,  the dressing was too mayo-strong for me. Next time I'll do what others have done, and replace some of the mayo with sour cream. I think that'll help with the strong aftertaste. I made croutons from elsewhere on allrecipes. No extra salt in dressing. Croutons and dressing served on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a salad for people who really don't want to eat healthy... a pound of bacon! 2 cups of croutons! Oy. For as many calories as are in here, I expected a lot more. It's kind of bland. It needs cheese. A nice sharp cheddar will improve this greatly. All-in-all it's fine, but I wouldn't make it again.

I was trying to find a recipe for the BLT salad available at my local deli.  This recipe although not the exact same is pretty similar.  I did add cooked pasta in place of the croutons and also some sliced cooked eggs. The dressing was ok but I think needs a little tweaking.  Thank you for sharing.

I cut this down to three servings, but otherwise followed it closely.  My wife liked it, but I thought it was quite flat.  I would prefer a brighter dressing.  If I make it again, I shall use something more peppy than mayonnaise and milk.

With 2 diabetics in the house, this salad fits the bill when we're starving! Good on the carbs, filling, and tastes wonderful. We do add other veggies at times to use them up or just pad an already yummy salad. The dressing makes it. We use normal mayo and 2% milk so we get good flavor. Tend to have this roughly once every other week or so no matter the season.

I made this as a side dish to go with soup so I cut the bacon in half and used less croutons I left the lettuce, tomato and dressing the same. My bacon was maple which I think lended a little sweet to the dressing but nobody seemed to mind it with the potato soup. Excellent and easy.

Awesome.  I added 1 cucumber and some green onions because I needed to use them or lose them. The dressing is fantastic. I was very pleasantly surprised.

This was great!  I used lowfat mayonnaise, skim milk, and turkey bacon - still tasted great!  I used 1/8 tsp. salt, and thought it was the perfect amount.  I think the garlic powder was a bit overpowering, so I will try just 3/4 tsp. next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had some mushrooms that needed used and I also ended up sprinkling some seasoned sunflower salad topping on it but all in all a good recipe. This is one that is easily tweaked to your own individual taste.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I didn't actually try the dressing yet.  I used store-bought creamy ceasar dressing, and the salad was awesome!  It's a simple salad with classic summer flavors.  I've made this salad before finding this recipe, but figured since it's so good it deserves a review!

This was a great salad especially the dressing. I was getting so tired of ranch they all started to taste funny. This simple but flavorful dressing is just what I was looking for. I made sort of a wedge salad because I did not have romaine. It was better than the restuarant wedge salads that I have tried. Thanks I will be using this from now on.

Been making this for years.  I've never met anyone that didn't enjoy this salad.  Just a note. Be careful when dressing the salad, it very easy to over dress.  Then you end up with a soggy mess.

Wow! This is g-o-o-o-o-d stuff!!!!! Made this as an accompainment to a BBQ "smorgasboard"/Bday party with friends last weekend. My fiance grilled brats, burgers and corn on the cobb. I cooked up some baked beans, made this BLT salad and baked a Bday cake! Everyone really enjoyed this (except for my fiance - he doesn't like salad...). I do have one suggestion though. I would add just a tad more milk to the dressing (to thin it out a bit; as is, it's too thick for my liking) and serve it on the side as opposed to tossing with everything else (the salad gets soggy very quickly otherwise). I also think using iceberg lettuce would help alleviate the sogginess issue, especially since romaine is delicate to begin with. Actually, I think I'll use iceberg next time (it is what I'm accustomed to eating on my BLT sandwiches). Oh, If you are short on time, just use a bag of pre-mixed salad greens (I used a bag of Dole romaine, but they sell bags of iceberg as well). Additionally, to speed prep, I suggest using a handheld immersion blender to mix the dressing ingredients (no use in digging out your blender or food processor if you have one). To make cooking your bacon easier (and less messy), try JOYCE's recipe for Bacon for the Family or a Crowd (her recipe is for exactly 1 lb. of bacon!). And, if you are debating whether or not to give this a try... YOU MUST, MUST, MUST DO SO!!! This REALLY does taste like a BLT! Thanks for sharing your idea, Mooney :)

My family all liked this a lot.  I will try it with iceburg lettuce next time since we prefer it to romaine.  Don't add the crutons if you expcet to have leftovers....they will get soggy! Just serve them on the side.

Nice, easy, not full of preservatives like those store bought dressings.   Skip the croutons for the low carb diets.

During dinner my husband commented "this really tastes like a BLT--very, very good!" So this is a home run in my book, because my husband, who doesn't eat tomatoes on anything except bacon & tomato sandwiches, loved this & wants me to make it again. I used iceberg lettuce, and for the dressing I used part fat-free mayo, half buttermilk & half 1% milk, about half the garlic powder, and added in a sprinkle of dried basil. Campari tomatoes really put this over the top. This one will be in the 5-star keeper file!

I made this for dinner today and my whole family loved it! I did omit the salt as suggested by a previous reviewer and that is a good idea since the bacon does add enough of a salty taste. Start the meal with a good soup followed by this salad and you have a great simple meal!

I get requests for this salad all the time!  I chop semi frozen bacon first, then fry it up--it saves time and it's all nice and crispy.  I omit the croutons and add sunflower seeds instead.  YUM!!!!

This salad was awesome! I brought it to my in-laws for Thanksgiving dinner and they all loved it. And they asked for the dressing recipe! I also added 2 hard boiled eggs and some shredded cheddar cheese and both complimented the salad very well.

What a delicious salad!  I added more ingredients eg: yellow capsicum, sliced mushrooms, small chopped apple and instead of the dressing (because I had no mayo) I used bottled Ranch Dressing instead!  Mmmm...flavour explosion!!!  Yum!!

Who knew something so simple would be so good. Our family loves BLT sandwiches and they loved the salad just as much.  The only thing I did was used 2/4 real mayonnaise and 1/4 miracle whip just to give it that zip my family loves.
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Really good salad! I used just regular salad mix and it worked great! When mixing the dressing together I  used my little hand whisk instead of having to clean the food processor or the blender. Saves on dishes! Also waited to toss the tomatoes with everything until all the other ingredients were incorporated. Give this salad a try! YUM

Terrific recipe and so easy to prepare. The dressing is good just by itself. I wasn't expecting too much from this and was very surprised at how good it tasted. Husband loved this and I can see me making it many more times. Again, simple and great tasting. It really did taste like a BLT sandwich.

YUM! I can't say enough good things about this salad.  I excpected it to be good because I love BLT sandwiches, but I didn't expect it to be so good that I was licking my bowl clean!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I served this for brunch and everyone liked it.  I used turkey bacon to cut back on the very, very high fat content and it was still good.  Will probably use light mayo next time too.  I scaled the recipe to serve 36 people and it made an over-abundance of dressing and probably only used 1/3 of it.  I will definitely make it again!

What a great combination.  I made this for the first time for a family gathering - it was a huge hit.  I have since made it two more times with the same reviews.  Thank you D.L.

I made half the recipe for my husband and me as a main dish.  It was just the right amount and it was DELICIOUS!  I added grated aged cheddar as well. The dressing was suprisingly REALLY TASTY - perfect for this salad! (The salt in the dressing wasn't necessary due to the bacon and cheese.) Thanks a bunch! :o)

I have made this salad for so more years than I can remember.  I don't add milk to the mayo since I wouldn't add it to the mayo when I make a BLT for dinner, the bread would get soggy. Depending on the size avocados I have on hand I add between 1 or 2 cut in a large dice to the salad or 1/2 to 1 whole mashed onto the bread for each sandwich. As much as we like garlic I never put garlic powder on a BLT so I don't add it to this salad. I have only home made mayo in the house made from an old recipe put out by the Wesson oil Company back in the 1930s. My Grandmother made it, my Mom made and this old man still makes it. It takes about 1/2 cup total, I think 3/4 of a cup would drown out the taste of everything else. Since I make our BLT sandwiches using a local cracked wheat sourdough I cut the same brand of sourdough into cubes and add them to the salad untoasted when I am ready to serve it. Try dicing your bacon before cooking it to whatever degree of doneness you like it, it seems to cook quicker that way. Since this is all we are going to have for dinner the whole recipe makes 2 nice satisfying servings

Delicious! A new favorite of my wife's. I'll add one caveat, as most other reviews have, and say to keep the dressing/croutons out if you intend to save any for leftovers. Adding the dressing causes the leftovers to wilt incredibly quickly.

This a simple but delicious salad recipe. What's not to like about a BLT? I did make my own croutons because I don't care for the "added" ingredients in the store-bought kind. I must add, though, that all those people fretting over fat(unless of course you have a health issue) must read the latest guidelines on fat. It is GOOD for you! Really! Look it up. Everything in moderation is the key.

We've been making this recipe in my family for years - it's always a hit no matter where I bring it.  However, instead of croutons, we do pasta - usually just elbow maccaroni.  I use dreamfields pasta to cut down on carbs, greens, tomatoes, bacon and Hellmans.  Can't get much more simple than that!!!

Great for a quick family meal salad- I used the pre-cooked bacon and croutons. Fast and delicious for a no-cook meal in the summer.

I love this recipe.  After eating at PI a very popular pizza place in STL I had to know how to make this salad.  I have had it there several times and crave it.  So I was very happy to find this recipe.  First off I added banana peppers.  Diced them up I just used some jared ones (they have them in the salad at PI), next I did add a half packet of Ranch Salad Dressing  just to give it some flar if you do this you do not need the garlic.  I also used baby tomatos and cut them in half.  Of course use the REAL bacon it taste so much better!  Other than that I stuck to the basics, iceburg lettuce does not work at all.  Thanks for sharing this is a huge hit and I make it all the time!

My husband loved this (imagine that).  I though the dressing was a tad thin, so next time I'll cut back on the milk a little bit.  I doubled the pepper and added a just pinch of salt as the croutons and bacon added quite a bit on their own.  This is a very quick, filling weeknight meal.

Excellent & easy salad.  I'm a gastric lapband recipient & cannot eat bread.  The crunchy croutons take the place of bread/toast and go down so heavenly.  Thanks D.L. Mooney!!!

Great, simple, fresh tasting recipe. I used cabbage (greeen or napa) since you can mix it up ahead of time and it won't get soggy like romaine and iceberg can. I also added a drizzle of sesame oil to the dressing; gives it a smoky flavor. I skipped the croutons, used half and half instead of milk, and added avocado.

This was such a good salad.  I used some left over homemade ranch dressing (about 1/2 cup) with the 1 cup of mayo that the recipe called for.  What a hit.  I will definetly make this one again.

Since BLT sandwiches are my favies, I knew this was a winner.  I DID tweek around on the dressing according to some of the other reviewers.  I didn't use any milk but did put (1) Splenda packet and vinegar (to taste) for some zing.
This one goes to the head of the class.

This was great! It really reminded me of a BLT sandwich. I didn't have a pound of bacon, so I just used 5 slices of turkey bacon and it still turned out fine. The only thing I didn't like as much was the spiciness that the garlic powder added to the dressing. But my husband loved it and he is not a salad guy!

I got so many compliments on this salad for the potluck we had.  I substituted with full cherry tomatoes and pretty much went with my instincts with the dressing.  Used no salt and still managed to come out delicious.  I also added shredded mozarella cheese.

This was a good salad...needed a little more garlic for my taste and use real mayo for the dressing...I also added a little lemon juice to the dressing. Next time I may try it with some grilled chicken for a club salad.

yum! Needs double  the bacon. I used light sour cream instead of mayo, and it was delicious. Next time I'll add sliced boiled eggs for more protein.

Dressing was a little too garlicky for us. My daughter said it actually burned her mouth! Very yummy though. Will definitely make again, only next time, will only use 1/2 tsp garlic powder.

I love this on a hot day when it's to hot to cook.  I used APPLEWOOD bacon (yum).  I chopped bacon in food processor after I had baked the bacon at 425.  I added bacon to the cherry tomatoes to blend the flavors.  I added thin sliced red onion and a hard boiled egg.  Really good

Our family of five loved this salad and I will definitely make it again.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five because of the garlic issue.  With so many garlic-loving reviewers saying that the garlic was overpowing, I knew to back off because I am not a huge garlic fan in the first place.  I started with a 1/4 teaspoon, tasted the dressing, and thought it was just fine with that amount.  I don't know if anyone else mentioned this (I didn't read all 400+ reviews), but I seriously cannot see any reason to drag out your blender or food processor for the dressing.  I really don't like the clean up involved with either appliance, so I just whisked the dressing in a bowl.  I swear I only had to whisk it for about 30 seconds until the dressing was a perfect consistency.  Thank you to D. L. Mooney for this recipe ... my husband has already said he can't wait to have it again.

This salad really has the flavors of a BLT.  I used fat-free mayonnaise and it was still delicious.  I also added a little bit of cheese.  My one complaint is that the garlic in the dressing is overpowering.  I like garlic, but I was tasting it for the rest of the day, even after eating other food.

Okay - I jazzed up the dressing with a little chopped red onion. - This would be better if the bacon were mixed in with the dresssing before hand to give a little more flavor. I will probably make again, but with some modifications.

This is a delicious recipe, however, I never had a BLT on garlic bread. I made it as written and that's what it tasted like. I will reduce the garlic powder by half the next time. Really easy and good tasting recipe. Thanks D.L.!!

This salad was very tasty, filling, easy to make, I could go on and on.  We eat salads for dinner at least once week and are usually snacking at some point in the evening.  Not so after eating this.  And did I mention easy?  Most time consuming part was cooking the bacon, but, it's bacon!!  So who cares?  I did keep the dressing on the side until we built our salads and ate.  So nothing got soggy.  YUMMY, this will be added to the rotation.....

So delicious. My go-to salad recipe when I want something special! Update: I have also made pasta salad with the dressing (adding some cheddar & bacon on each serving) and I like to 'squeeze' a tomato into the dressing for an added BLT taste! Still a 5 star!

Tastes like a BLT in a bowl. I used a tablespoon of buttermilk powder in the dressing and tossed in a chopped cucumber that was in the fridge. This salad is hearty enough for a main dish or great as a side.

I decided to have a dinner party for my sister and aunt birthday, and the guests thought the BLT salad was the best item on the menu.  I added lemon juice to the salad dressing, a red onion to the salad and mixed it together.  It was absolutely divine.  I will begin to experiment with making more salad dressings and leave the processed dressings in the store.

this is excellent.  I used a blender to blend all of the dressing ingredients together and also threw the bacon in the blender too! dressing turned out great, but then i had to fry another pound of bacon to crumble in the salad!!  This was so great.  I thought at first the dressing was too thick, so i added a little more milk, SHOULDN'T have. That made it a little to runny and didn't stick to the lettuce.  Will definately make again.!

Just okay.  Not out of this world like I was expecting from reading other reviews.  The dressing was nothing special...perhaps just a classic Ranch dressing would be better???  We did eat it and enjoyed it...but definitely not a recipe that warrants 5 stars.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I made homemade garlic croutons but other than that, left everything else the same (which I rarely do).  It was awesome.  Leftovers weren't so great, as the tomato and croutons get a little mushy, but there wasn't much left anyway, so it wasn't a big waste.  Thanks D.L.

This was very good and very easy! I crumbled a box of the pre-cooked bacon that is now out in stores, added 2% milk shredded cheddar cheese, used low fat mayo and lactaid milk and this did very well. As usual, I used a bag of pre-shredded lettuce. This is going to be our first 80 degree day today, I am off from work, life is good! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this salad at the last minute for about 10 people and it was wonderful!  Everyone raved about it and loved all the great flavors in it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I chopped up 2 hard boiled eggs in it.  Even my picky husband and kids loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Thought this was OK at best.  Followed exact and the dressing was tasted "funky", don't really know if I would make again or how to improve it.  Guess I was expecting something fabulous by the reviews but was disappointed.

Great salad - the dressing tastes so much like Cesar Salad Supreme on this site with less than 1/4 of the ingredients. I chopped fresh chives in the dressing and green onion on the salad. Really good - thanks for the change!

Great salad! The bacon really sets it off. I used a whole package of bacon and did a half romaine/half iceberg mix. The dressing is amazing! A must try for anyone who's looking for a variation on their typical salad.

This was good, and the bacon and dressing were especially great.  However, next time I will make more of the dressing, it was pretty close to not enough.

Used 1 bag of Dole Classic Romaine (chopped) and substituted real bacon bits for the bacon.  Also added hard-boiled egg, shredded cheddar and chopped turkey.  Served dressing on the side to avoid wilting.  I was looking forward to a great tasting "club" salad.  Maybe it was the shredding of the lettuce, but this was rather wilty even before adding the dressing.  Dressing flavor was ok, ranch may have been better.  Probably would not make again.

Fantastic, my family loved this!  A few tips:  I made the dressing ahead of time so the flavors could blend.  Instead of using romaine, I used about 2 (~10 oz) bags of an iceberg salad mix and I used 2 cups of sliced cherry tomatoes.  Be sure and mix this just before serving to avoid a soggy salad or toss ingredients and serve the dressing on the side.  I doubled the "Garlic Croutons" recipe on this site and used them in this recipe, turned out really good!

I've made this salad many times taking the easy way out, i.e. bottled ranch dressing instead of the homemade dressing listed.  We love it that way and could eat it nightly!  This weekend I made the salad the real way, with the mayo/milk/garlic/pepper dressing for a picnic.  I wouldn't make it again this way.  Perhaps it was because I used light mayo and 2 cloves of fresh garlic, but we thought the dressing was sweet tasting and we didn't like it at all in combination with the other ingredients.  I'll stick with my bottled ranch dressing!

I was looking for a new "ladies lunch" recipe and decided to try this one. I left out the croutons and stuffed pita bread with the salad and drizzled the dressing over the filling. It was a big hit.

This salad is so delicious that it has become a staple in our house.  We'll make it as a side dish with dinner or we'll make it and add chicken breast to it and it becomes dinner.  Absolutely wonderful.
The only thing I have changed since I first received the recipe was to use buttermilk in the dressing instead of regular milk -- gives it a very nice zing!

This salad was fantastic!  I used Hellman's Light mayo and 1% milk.  I also added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 2 T. parmesan cheese, 1 tsp oregano and a hefty dose of freshly ground black pepper.  I made the dressing early in the morning and let it sit in the fridge all day.  I made the garlic crouton recipe from this site and left out the tomatoes.  I tore up 3 romaine hearts and put each serving in a large bowl along with some turkey bacon (cooked in the microwave till crisp) and a couple of spoonfuls of dressing.  I tossed it all together and poured it out onto each plate.  This way, all the lettuce was covered in dressing.  Will make again!

The appeal of this salad is that it is so reminiscent of the familiar comfort food for which it is named.  It is not exactly gourmet but it is quite good and certainly has a familiar taste.  I made this with turkey bacon instead of pork in order to cut down the fat content.  Served with bread instead of croutons this can easily make a satisfying meal.

This was great!  Bacon doesn't sit well with me, so I used turkey bacon and it was great.  I also added some green onion and red pepper flakes to the dressing.  I think next time, I'll add a jalepeno for a little kick.

This salad was good but I don't think I will make it again.  Unless you don't care about how much fat is in it.  With all that Mayo and bacon in it, I felt guilty eating it.

This was a great salad. It worked on finicky people too. I used the Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon and it made the recipe even easier to make which I didn’t think would be possible.

Although the flavors on this was great, and everyone who tried it, liked it, it was not a "big seller" at my family's annual potluck - why??? Because it looked like a plain salad with croutons and bottled ranch dressing. Need to be sure to use romaine or other "fancy" lettuce, otherwise looks too plain when there are 5 or 6 other salads available. But would be ideal for a smaller family gathering.

This is my husband's favorite salad.  Of course, how can you go wrong with these ingredients?  I only put in about half the bacon and I add some spinach leaves so that I don't feel quite so guilty about eating it.  Yum.

Great Salad.  I cut back a little on the garlic though.  It was a bit much for me.  But otherwise a wonderful dinner and makes enough to share.

This recipe really reminds you of a BLT.  I used homemade french bread croutons. My entire family loved it. I had the leftovers for lunch the next day and I think the dressing was even better.

This was good, although a bit too salty for my taste. I think that the recipe calls for too much bacon. Also, I would suggest making sure that the croutons used are not seasoned very much, as they can make the salad overly salty like turned out.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I made it for a girlfriend and she went back for second, which she never does!  The dressing is fabulous - the simplicity of the whole thing is wonderful.  I used little grape tomatoes, cut in half and they were tasty and pretty!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I might cut back on the amount of bacon next time as I noticed people left bacon on their plates. It does include a lot of bacon! Very good, though.

Cooking a pound of bacon took way too long, and then you could hardly taste it in the salad.  The dressing tasted too much like mayonnaise.

This was a great way to sneak some veggies into my bacon-loving four-year-old! Plus she got to help me crumble the bacon, which was lots of fun. One note---make sure all the salad gets eaten the same day, because the leftovers are all soggy and not very good.

What a great salad! And it's such an obvious good idea -- why didn't I think about it? I rated it only so-so as far as kid-friendliness goes, only because I know few kids who'll eat salad!
I've shared this recipe four times already.

My family really enjoyed this salad. We eat low-carb and lots of fruits and vegetables.  Sometimes you run of ways to make another vegetable or another salad.  The family just loved the way that it had such a different flavor compared to regular old salads.  I added cheddar cheese on the side as an option and we all liked that,too. The flavor of the dressing was perfect with the flavors in the salad itself.  Definately try it if you're tired of salad the same old way!

This is a great summer recipe that is quick and easy to make.  It's a perfect mixture of ingredients that your sure to have on hand during the summer. I substitute cherry tomatoes (sliced in half)and they add a wonderful sweetness. This recipe is definitely kid approved!

Made this tonight, with no changes. I thought it was a bit heavy on the mayonnaise, otherwise, very good. Great mix of flavors, with very few ingredients and it definitely tasted like a BLT when you got a bite of lettuce, bacon, and crouton. Will definitely make again, but slightly lessen the amount of mayonnaise used, and maybe add avocado just for fun.

Excellent!  The dressing is simple and delicious.  I used roasted garlic powder and I really like how it worked in the dressing.

Cooking for my in-laws...obviously wanted to make a good impression...this did it!  I added a little garlic and onion powder to the dressing and ditched the pepper (just personal preference).  Easy peasy and wonderful!

Excellent and quick salad. I followed other reviewers' advice and used low fat Hellmans  and a bit of sour cream along with the 2% milk. I used a mix of spring lettuce, romaine, and kale. We also sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese on top. Even my non salad people and it up!

Very tasty and filling plus perfect for summer. I did reduce the amount of dressing and bacon used. I also added a spring mix with the iceberg. I think next time I'll use lowfat mayo too.

Simple and good! It's like a BLT minus the carbs! Instead of the dressing recipe given with the recipe, I used ranch dressing (suggested by a reviewer) that I wanted to use up. It turned out great, not overpowering it. I'm sure I'll make it again and try the recipe's dressing. Thanks D.L.!  UPDATE 4/1/17: Made with a spring mix salad blend and the dressing in the recipe - just fabulous!

The garlicy dressing was a nice call...watch how much salt you put in it though, with bacon and seasoned croutons it can get salty in a hurry.

Made this for a pot luck and it tasted fabulous!!...but I wouldn't bring it to another one.  It becomes a slimy unappealing mess when left on the table for very long, thus the three stars. This recipe needs to be tossed with the dressing and eaten immediately!  But other than that the salad is easy, flavorful and goes over very well!  I will be making it again.

Nice idea, quick and easy. Made for a nice summer dinner. I added sliced hard boiled eggs, cucumber, sliced mushrooms and red pepper slices. The dressing was delish, I served it on the side not to drench the salad.

Great salad, make the dressing up early in the day separately so flavors have time to marry and toss everything together when your're about ready to serve, to avoid a soggy lettuce. I also added in some onion powder, dried basil and scant amount of bacon drippings for a more favorable dressing. I am going to add some avocados next time, that would really take this salad over the top.

Super great salad!  I omitted the croutons & used fat free mayo to bring down the calorie count.  I added more garlic powder to bump up the taste.

Loved this!  Adjust to fit Weight Watchers program by using fat free mayo.  Next time I will get more bland croutons because it was a little too much garlic between dressing and the garlic in the croutons.

This salad was really good.  Like a lot of the other reviewers said, the dressing was REALLY garlic-y and I will probably reduce by half next time.  I will also take others' suggestion and maybe use half mayo and half sour cream for a lighter dressing.  I added cooked rotini pasta and some cooked chicken to make it a complete meal and my family loved it!

I didn't like the dressing at all. I couldn't even put it on the salad. I ended up using Italian dressing and the salad was just ok.

This is excellent!  It really nails the taste of a BLT.  Just a suggestion though: serve the croutons on the side, otherwise they get soggy pretty fast.

Based on other reviews I was expecting more. I love BLTs and was really looking forward to this salad. I was disappointed. I made it as directed and found the dressing pretty bland. This salad is a good idea I'll probably make it again just use a different dressing.

I made this for a potluck yesterday. It was okay but the mayo taste was too overpowering for my taste. Love the idea, but I'm wondering what I can do to make it lighter in mayo flavor. I'll read all the reviews to see if this has been an issue with others and maybe tweak it.

I used turkey bacon.  For the dressing I used 1/2 c. lite mayo, 2 heaping Tbsp lite sour cream and added the juice of one lemon, otherwise it was the same.  I planned to add avocado but mine weren't ripe yet, so I'll try it next time.  My husband ate 3 bowls of this!!  I give 4 stars simply because the original recipe was way too fatty for my tastes.

Great recipe!  Such a nice change from regular old salad.  But, 6 hours later I'm still tasting that garlic powder from the dressing - I'm cutting that back a little bit next time.  Perhaps 1/2 tsp or 3/4 tsp should do it.  Very easy and yummy salad!

Didn't really care for the dressing. It basically tasted like mayo with garlic powder in it. It's a good thing I didn't toss the salad in this dressing, because I was able to take another reviewer's suggestion and fix it up by adding some barbeque sauce to it. It definitely made the salad much more enjoyable. I also added avocado, egg, and cheese to it and substituted grape tomatoes for regular tomatoes.

This is ok.  The dressing suggested was not too good.  Luckily, we were hesitant and made the dressing on the side before we put it on the salad.  Would not do again.

I make a similar salad regularly.  Try adding sliced avocado and some shredded monterey jack cheese.  Heavy on the fats, but oh so good.

This was fantastic! The flavors really came together, and the flavor of the dressing was great. I lightened it up considerably by scaling the dressing down to 1 serving (2 Tbsp mayo) and using it to dress a full head of romaine. There was plenty of dressing to lightly coat all the lettuce; I'm sure the full dressing amount would be delicious, but I think it would be very heavy for a lot of people's tastes. I used Veganaise because that's what we keep in the house. We also vegetarianized the recipe by using 2 strips of Morningstar Farms Veggie Bacon crisped in the microwave. I also used quartered grape tomatoes, which we find are much more delicious in the winter than regular. This will definitely enter our regular rotation.

This is a great little salad. I actually made the dressing ahead of time and let it sit a few hours in the fridge before putting the rest of the salad together right before serving. A little cheese or red onions next time might be a nice addition. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for my son's b-day party and received tons of compliments. My BIL commented that it tasted "restaurant like". Took the recommendation of another reviewer and added three slices of bacon to the dressing while in the blender, therefore, omitted the extra salt. Would be excellent with grilled chicken for a summer meal.

This was a great "light meal" for a weekend with company.  Thanks so much to IndyDiva79 for the instuctions for baking bacon -- what a fabulous way to free up your hands to do other things.  Next time I will reduce the garlic powder.  It tasted good, but stayed with us a bit longer than one would like, if you know what I mean.  I put only about 1/2 of the dressing on the salad which was still plenty.  Overall a good, simple, easy lunch for guests.

This salad is amazing!  It is by far my favorite salad and I always get asked for the recipe.  I do skip out on the Romaine lettuce and buy the prepackaged/chopped kind, as well as the microwave ready bacon.

Yummy! At first I thought...ok this is going to taste like any other salad that I have prepared, I was wrong! The garlic powder adds that extra "oomph" to the salad. The only changes I made were: **I was out of milk so I microwaved the mayo mixture just a little to achieve a consistency similar to dressing AND I cheated by using the real bacon pieces found with the bagged salad in the grocery store (this just saves time and tastes like freshly cooked bacon when you warm it in the microwave)**. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very good salad.  I only used about 1/2 of the basil that it called for and that was plenty.  I made it for a party and everyone commented on how much they liked it. I will definitely make it again.

My family absolutely loved this salad and it was so easy to make. Even my husband who is not a big salad eater had seconds. This will appear on our menu again very soon.

Don't know how many times I have made this salad and after giving the recipe to my daughters who make it often, must admit, we are addicted to it.  However, we call it 'heart attack salad' as it has so much cholesterol in it but too good to not have periodaclly.

Very easy! I used grape tomatoes along with yellow pear tomatoes to add some color. I also added about 1 T. of dry ranch dressing mix. Will make again!

I LOVE the dressing on this salad!  The garlic is so tasty, with just a hint of pepper.  The salad is so easy to put together, too.  I used cheese and garlic croutons since they were the only ones I had on hand, and turkey bacon instead of regular.  It came out FABULOUS.  Definitely a keeper for quick dinners after work

This was fine. No raves from my BLT loving family. Be judicious with the garlic powder.I love garlic, but I only added 1/2 a tsp. and the garlic powder flavor stuck with me for hours.

Delicious salad as written, but did a few things to cut down on the fat content(without sacrificing the taste):  used reduced fat mayo and skim milk in the dressing, only use a 1/2 pound bacon (instead of a whole)and used fat free croutons...try it!

This is SO delicious!  I'll be making it for the second time tonight.  I add a little sharp shredded cheddar.  Served with a baked potato, this is a perfect summer meal.  My husband actually stopped me mid-sentence during dinner, and said, "Oh my God, is this good!"

This was such a nice change!  I would compare it to a Casear salad with flare!  Very tasty and delicious!  I will try it with pieces of chicken breast next time!  
If you are looking for a health salad - this is not it...

I thought this was pretty tasty.  I did make a few changes, though.  Since I was pressed for time, I used bacon bits instead of real bacon.  Next time, I'll go for the real stuff!  Also, I used low fat mayo, which tasted ok.  I bet this salad is wonderful with the full-fat mayo.  I will be making this again, next time following the recipe as is.

This was good.  I made exactly as written.  It is a good recipe that you can add to.  next time i will add some diced chicken and sharp cheese.  This would also be good with homemade ranch dressing.

I don't gravitate towards salads, but this one caught my eye at a dinner group. It was great. I ate way more than usual. I loved the surprise of the bacon in my bites. I will definitely make it and I recommend it.

Made as is, except used iceberg lettuce as I don't like romaine, and perhaps that's why mine didn't get soggy.  I just blended the dressing with a fork -- not smooth that way but I didn't see where it mattered.  Thought this was really good, and even though it didn't really taste like a BLT, it tasted as good as one

This IS the best salad I've ever had!  I put a bit of a "club salad" and a "chopped salad" twist on it by chopping my lettuce into small bite size pieces, adding chopped avocado and cucumber, then topping it with some (still slightly warm) cut up hard boiled eggs (which I am normally not a fan of).  Since I am a garlic lover, I also added a bit more garlic powder than the recipe calls for (you can mix your dressing in a bowl by whipping the ingredients with a wire wisk and it turns out just as good).  Love the garlic after-taste!!!

My husband thought this tasted like a BLT, I just thought it tasted good!  We are going to use the dressing recipe as a regular but decrease the garlic by half. I have never had too much garlic before but my husband complained that his garlic breath almost killed him bouncing off the phone receiver! Excellent recipe...definately a keeper.

Received rave reviews when I took this salad to a church potluck. I added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the recipe; may add chopped avocado next time. Everyone could not believe the dressing was so simple.

I have made this several times now and everyone I have served it to loves it. My family is addicted to ranch dressing but after having this dressing they are now asking for it instead of ranch. Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this salad tonight for my two non-salad eating guys (husband and son)...they loved it.  To cut fat, I only used 1/2 lb bacon and added some rotisserie chicken breast, shredded (sort of turned it into a "Club Salad" rather than BLT), and didn't use all the dressing.  Used the garlic croutons from this site (which were delicious by the way).  My son asked me to make it again soon.  All in all a great recipe!

This is sooo good! Now that my husband has tried this, he is disappointed if I prepare any other kind of salad for dinner.  I make it easy on myself and use bacon bits/pieces instead of real bacon.  Great!

Everyone enjoyed this salad.  If you anticipate that you will have leftovers you may want to reserve some of the salad and dressing.  Once it is mixed it gets soggy if not eaten within a few hours.  This salad would probably be a good dish for a potluck dinner.  : )

Excellent salad, but I ommitted the salt the second time I made it.  The bacon seems to add enough to it already.  Great salad to have with bbq'ed hamburgers.

My daughter and I made this recipe together and we both enjoyed it very much.  Very delicious and pretty easy.  We will definately be making this again.  There was a "slight" bit too much dressing and will probably not put it all on next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this salad for a family cookout.  Every last morsel was eaten, which is rare for a salad in my family.  The croutons are worth it, they are delicious.  I also added a little milk to the dressing to thin it out a bit.

Very good recipe, even the kids liked it.  I added 1 teaspoon of cooled bacon drippings to the dressing just before serving....gave it that extra punch and was delicious. Thank you.

Delicious, simple to prepare, everyone loves it. I know this has all been said but I seldom review recipes and just had to add to this review list. We jokenly refer to it as 'Salad of Death' due to cholesterol but it did not stop anyone from begging for more.  Could cut cholesterol but why change a perfect recipe.

Fabulous!!  Serve with soup and you've got a complete meal.  Or all by itself since we all went back for seconds.  Be sure to add dressing just before serving or the croutons will get soggy.  I used low-salt bacon.  Cut recipe in 1/2 for a family of 4, if serving with something else.

Darn this was good!  I didn't make it for a long time because I thought that it was just like any other salad......I usually put tomatoes, bacon, and bunch of other things in my salads.....but the dressing in this, and the tomato/bacon mix was the best.  Had friends over and they kept eating, it was all gone.  I can see how it would be soggy the next day, but would be surprised if you had any left!!  this is sooooooo good!

This recipe is wonderful, and so quick and easy! I just popped the bacon in the microwave and threw together the dressing...I was sitting down to eat in less than 10 minutes! It was quite yummy...in fact, it was so good, it was my whole dinner!

I used more sour cream than mayonaise and it was very good. It does take some time to cook all the bacon, next time I might buy the bacon that is already cooked. This does taste just like a blt sandwich, it was very good.

My husband and I loved this salad!  For a little more flavor, I added 1 tablespoon of the powdered ranch dressing to the mayo and milk mixture.  It was delicious!  I also substituted bacon for Turkey Bacon.  Tasted just like real bacon but a bit less fat!

I was very upset over this recipe.  For some odd reason the lettuce got very soggy.
The salad still tasted good but the sogginess ruined it.  Next time I do it, I will
cut up the lettuce right before I serve it.

I made this salad the other night for dinner. This is the best salad I have ever had. I highly reccomend it to everyone. You wont be dissapointed. I used precooked bacon in a glass jar. I cut the garlic powder down to one half teaspoon. And I dont have a blender so I just mixed it by hand. I used iceberg lettuce instead of romaine also. Im trying to put more salads on our dinner table to be a bit more healthy and im really glad I tried this one.

We loved this salad! I will use a bit less garlic in the dressing in the future, but thats a matter of preference. I suggest using low/no fat mayo and plain no fat yogurt for the dressing,to cut down on calories, and low sodium bacon. It makes it a little more "guilt free"

My kids aren't big on salads but the little ones had a great time making it fora surprise lunch for their big brothers. It's a nice light meal on a hot summer evening.

Delicious!  We use more black pepper, but that's just a personal preference.

This salad was really good, but I used Hidden Valley Ranch dressing instead. I will also not be using the lettuce in it. It was just slimy as a leftover. Also, I used a box of rotini pasta in the salad. So easy and good.

Since when is there garlic on a BLT?  So glad I had more mayonnaise and milk because I made the dressing a I threw it away. used less milk and NO GARLIC. Then, for a more realistic twist, I used iceberg lettuce, added cooled caramelized onions, shredded cheddar cheese, bacon croutons and took it up a few levels.

I have this 4/5 only because it’s not life changing. It is very easy and very good though! The only thing I did differently was use a little grated Parmesan; maybe two tablespoons; onion powder as suggested by other reviews and some co-jack shredded cheese. I didn’t add the bacon, croutons or shredded cheese until I was serving it and like other reviews suggested, I didn’t mix in all of the dressing at once because I knew there was too much for two of us to eat. I mixed what was left the next night and had it alone for dinner, though I had a little thick cut deli turkey to it. I will make this again, especially the dressing which was very good.

Really tasty. I made my own garlic croutons. Took slices of white bread and tore it in pieces. Tossed in olive oil and garlic powder and toasted it in the toaster oven till golden brown and crispy.

Good but way garlicky. I read a lot of the reviews and didnt see others complaining about that. My teen daughter made the dressing.    im starting to think she doesnt know the difference between a teaspoon and a tablespoon.

We enjoyed it very much.    We used Iceberg lettuce (because we had no  Romaine) and we used about 1/2 lb of bacon.   We will make it again and soon.  We will try it with Romaine lettuce and probably with a full lb of bacon.

I loved this idea! I used light  Miracle Whip salad dressing in place of mayonnaise as hubby can't have mayo, mixed with 1/4C fat free italian dressing, no milk, and it just felt decadent! Will make again! I can only imagine adding ham, salami, pepperoni and sharp cheddar cheese to make this incredible, (and very fattening)

Loved it. I read lots of reviews and followed a few. Used only half the garlic powder, and substituted the other half with onion powder. Also added shredded cheese. I put the dressing on the side so it didn’t get soggy. Delicious.

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   This recipe was a “10” in my family.  Everyone simply enjoyed this dish and a lucky few were able to get “seconds.”  Which means the next time I make it I will double the ingredients.  This dish will definitely be in the monthly family rotation of meals in the future.

I made this into a single portion just for myself. It was a great alternative to a higher calorie BLT! I  did 2 c spring mix lettuce, 1 roma tomato, and 3 crumbled slices of bacon.  For the dressing, I whisked together 1T mayo (15g), 2 T milk, 1/8t garlic powder and 1/8 t black pepper.  The dressing was just enough! I thought I would share just in case there are other calorie counters out there!  I estimated about 350 calories for the recipe I made.

This is a keeper!  The only change I made was using light mayonnaise and subbing some Greek yogurt for part of the mayo.  I also added some finely shredded cheddar cheese.  I did not add all the dressing because when I tossed it, I added a little at a time and stopped when it looked right to me.  I took it to a dinner for 12 people and only a small part was left (I doubled the recipe) and everyone raved!  I will be making this again.

This was awesome!  I used the grease from the bacon and a loaf of Italian bread to make the croutons.

Delicious and easy! My sons high school baseball team ate it all. I used double the romaine and had plenty of dressing. No need for a pound of bacon, I used 3/4 and it was plenty.

This was so simple and so delicious! I'm trying to cut bread out but wanted a BLT tonight. I found this recipe and only tweaked three small things for personal taste. 1) I used part Greek yogurt and part vegan mayo with 1/4 c milk. 2) I used fresh minced garlic. 3) I added avocado because avocados are goodoing. It's honestly better than the Sandwich.  I only did 4 stars because I changed some things ;)

Made a single serving of this salad and I'm glad I did because had I made more I would have eaten it all! Made this in no time at all since I had leftover bacon from this morning. Will make again.

Delicious salad with a wonderful homemade dressing. We lightly dressed the salad, and then served the remainder of the dressing off to the side for people to add more as they desired. Also kept the bacon separate for those who do not eat pork. Added cucumbers!! Delicious!!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I halved the amount of bacon and added 1/8 teaspoon of bacon salt to the dressing. I kept the dressing on the side in a bowl for adding to a serving of salad. It was the right dressing for salad.

this one's a keeper. I used iceberg lettuce and left the romaine for the wife so she could mix it with the rest of the weeds she eats. I also used Sriracha croutons and grape tomatoes. The dressing is spot on and is so easy to make.

Having the salad for a cookout today.  Always wanted the mayonnaise dressing part to be more like what goes onto the BLT sandwich - and not Ranch dressing.  This dressing does the job!  Thank you!

This is a delicious salad that appeals to everyone.   I didn't add salt and didn't miss it.  The bacon added enough salt. I serve this as a family dinner salad. I recommend dressing it right before serving.

Delicious!  Used bacon "ends and pieces" and didn't have to crumble.  So easy.

Also topped mine with blue cheese crumbles.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  This will be a regular feature at our house.

Still awesome.  Never disappoints.

I made this salad for the employees at work and everyone LOVED it!! I got alot of compliments especially on the dressing. The only changes I made were to use bacon bits and I diced up tomatoes instead of using the cherry tomatoes. I made about 100 salads that week. Thanks for the great recipe.

VG! Next time to make it faster I might just use Ranch dressing or mix sour cream ranch power and a bit of milk to make it like a dressing.

Great flavor and so easy! I got to use the abundance of cherry tomatoes from the garden and followed other reviewers suggestions and baked the bacon.  I found that one head of romaine was not enough for all that dressing. I used 2 and added the dressing gradually until it seemed right. Still had some left. Not a fan of so much garlic powder. 1/2 t. was fine.

So easy, so delicious. I really like the homemade dressing, much lighter than store-bought Ranch. I chopped the bacon before cooking it, I find it faster to cook and I am always in a hurry. Best if you eat it fresh because tomatoes always get mushy in the refrigerator.

I thought it was okay, but nothing great. The dressing was fine for my tastes, but when mixed with the lettuce, it became mushy quite quickly. Probably won't make again though.

I made this salad and the dressing was terrible!  Am I the only one who thinks it has WAY too much garlic?  We threw the dressing away and enjoyed the salad.  I'm quite sure I followed the directions, but man it was strong!

I added two hard boiled eggs, 1T chopped fresh onion, 1cup cheddar cheese, and for the greens I used a mixture of spinach romaine lettuce and kale.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  I made it 3x in 4 days :)

Very good, added onion powder and some lemon juice as suggested because I like a little more "zip" in my dressing. Will make again.

I made this salad exactly as written and was very pleased with the results.  I assembled the salad  a couple of hours ahead of time and tossed with the dressing immediately prior to serving and it held up nicely.

This salad is delightful. The dressing took less then few minutes and was very tasty, just enough for the amount of lettuce. I cooked the bacon in the microwave, it turned out fine. I made every thing ahead of time and put it together at  dinner time. I will keep this in my collection.

This is possibly the best salad in the world!!!!! I could eat it as a meal every night. But unless you want it to be mostly bacon and tomatoes add about two or three more heads of romaine. you should definitely make this.

This is more like a 4.5 stars. It was easy to make and I had all ingredients on hand. I chopped up the bacon instead of cooking it in strips. I made the dressing and it lacked something. I added about 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and that was the missing link for me. It gave it more of a tangy flavor. I forgot to add the croutons, but it was ok since we had a side of garlic bread. I did omit the salt since the bacon provided it. It was quite good and had it as a main dish for dinner.

Just got done mixing up the salad dressing and it is FABULOUS!!  Only thing I added was a little bit of the bacon grease.  No need to mess with perfection.  So simple and easy too.  Always have the ingredients on hand also.

Was just like eating a BLT but in a salad - I added fried chicken pieces to make it a meal. Hubby said he thinks he found a new favorite salad. Thanks for sharing!

AWESOME! Very tasty and filling salad for my family and I. I will be making this in the future. After all, how can you go wrong with bacon? I added shredded cheddar cheese also.

I cut the recipe in half because we only have 3 people in my household.  I made a skinny version by using Hellmann's Light Mayonnaise and Skim milk.  I also used grape tomatoes, cut in half.  I eliminated the salt and the croutons.  This was so good!  It was like eating a BLT without the bread and the added calories!  I didn't use all of the dressing or bacon so I will be having another salad tomorrow :)

I make this salad all the time. Tonight I will be adding 2 hard boiled eggs along with peanuts on the side. Tastes just like a BLT sandwich without the carbs.

A really great summer salad! Per other reviews, I did make the following changes, which I thought made the dressing great on its own: 1 c. mayo, 2 T. sour cream, 2 cloves of garlic, minced, finely diced red onion (about 1/8 c.), doubled the pepper. Definitely let the dressing sit for several hours so the flavors can meld. Added cheese and avocado to the salad as well.

I made this salad on very short notice. The mayo was added last minute to prevent sogginess. I added quite a bit of shredded chz and forgot to add croutons, but they didn't seem to be missed. I also left tomatoes on the side b/c DH doesn't care for them. Folks scooped them in as they pleased. All in all a winner. I was joking with my friend that I didn't even need to write down the ingredients.. B-L-T Salad.. speaks for itself!! Very good! Used romaine, btw.

Honestly I'd give it more of a 3.5, it was a good mixture except for I felt there was way too much garlic.  Even my kids noticed it seemed almost spicy due to the overpowering garlic powder and I am a garlic lover. Maybe it will be better with less garlic next time.

This is the best salad I have ever fixed! I decided to be daring and try a new recipe for a baby shower, and am I glad I did! It was a hit! I received several emails the next day asking for the recipe. I can't brag enough about this salad.   Just a note, do not mix this salad until you are ready to serve! It gets extremely mushy! I prepared all my ingredients the night before, placed them in seperate containers and mixed 20 minutes before the shower. I also used shredded lettuce made for tacos. It made the salad much easier to eat and a lot less work!

Great salad!! I used store bought real bacon bits instead of cooking up a pound of bacon.  Less time consuming that way and was still delicious.

I made this salad for a dinner at a friends house.  It was very well received and got great compliments.  Very easy to make.  I made the dressing with 1 cup light mayo and 1/2 cup fat free mayo and no one could tell (doubled amount).  The reason for 4 stars is that I doubled the dressing because I doubled the lettuce but it seemed like there was a little too much garlic if you double the amount posted.  Other than that it was great!!!

This was a tasty salad!  I was in a hurry so I used 2 bags of romaine mix with shredded carrots, 2 pouches of REAL bacon bits, low fat mayo (instead of the real stuff) and 4 vine tomatoes.  The garlic powder really picked up the flavors.  The next time I make this I will fry up my own bacon and it will be even better.  ALSO if you are planning on having left overs, add croutons separately because they get soggy in the fridge!

Even my husband, who hates any dressing besides French and Italian, raved about this salad (and he never raves about any food!).  I took it to a party and everyone loved it and I got several requests for the recipe.

Wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be, but it was good. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup of sugar, and liked the dressing better. After reading previous reviews, I felt horribly guilty after eating it, due to the fat content. Not sure if I'll make it again.

Wonderful!! It was all the rave when I took it to a gathering at which the hosts provided baked potatoes and asked the guests to provide salad or dessert.  Everyone LOVED it.  That was some time ago; I think it's time to make it again for my family.

I took the advice of others and used a bit more bacon and added avacado.  I also used whole grain store bought croutons.

The salad is great and will become a go to for summer picnics and group gatherings.  

If you used ranch dressing instead of making the dressing, pre-cooked bacon rather than cooking yourself this could even be picked up on the way to a get together and assembled there.

I used turkey bacon for this recipe and it tasted great.  And instead of croutons I slice french bread, butter it, and bake it for 5 minutes.  Then I cut each slice into 5-6 pieces and sprinkle that on the salad.

No, this isn't the healthiest of salads, but it's a meal in itself!  And putting that aside, this is a great recipe.  The dressing tastes amazing and it's quick and easy.

My husband raves about this salad, and it is just such a wonderful twist to boring green salads.  My sister-in-law makes this tossed with blasamic vinegarette instead of the dressing in the recipe and it's really good too...TONS of flavor!!

This salad is a great hit with my family!It's a light, refreshing salad perfect for the summertime heat of Houston.  The only downside is it makes so much and you can't keep the leftovers.  My favorite salad by far! You've got to try it!

We have been making this since fresh tomatoes started coming this summer.  My husband and I laugh at how unhealthy this is for a salad, but we keep making it!  I don't think it would be worth it if we didn't have fresh tomatoes though.

When I made this the other night I was excited because it has been so hot so we have been on a salad kick...when I mixed it together I was nervous because I thought it was going to be bland...I was so happy when we ate it, I was pleasantly surprised! It was great! The only change I made was I added cucumber because I had some and also a little pasta to give it more of a main meal for us.

I made it for a July 4th picnic.  It only took a few minutes and was easy to transport and serve.  It is also a good recipe for low carb dieters if you don't add croutons.  I will definitly make again.

This was an excellent idea, however the dressing was WAY to garlicy for my kids and even a bit intense for me.  I'd reduce the garlic powder by at least half, maybe more.  I also skipped the croutons and went for a nice crusty warm portuguese roll with butter instead- Yummm!

My 7 year old daughter said Mom you just have to make this again! The ony thing I did was to add a touch more milk to make the dressing thiner. Was so good, this will be a family fav.

This salad is so YUMMY. Shared the recipe with family and have been told how much they love it also. The only thing I did different was to slice the bacon before cooking,it cooks faster.

Instead of ingredients 2 through 5, just buy your choice of salad dressing.

Otherwise, it's just a SALAD.  Throw in the fridge's leftovers, such as onions, brocolli, carrots, cucumbers, whatever. 

I use this recipie only to remind me that I need to make and eat more salads!

Fantastic.  This is a great change from your normal potato or macaroni salad.  The only change I made was that I used one pound of bacon for half of the recipe because it was just my husband and I and it still would have served 4 as side salads. Since bacon shrinks so much the extra bacon really made this delicious.

This was a good salad, both of my children liked it, I did cut my bacon up before I fried it and will not do that again, I like my bacon crispy and cutting it first got some of it a little to done. One thing I'm going to try next time I make it is add some chicken to it. I think it may make it taste a little better

We loved this recipe I changed a few things instead of bread I split a pita bread in half and buttered the one side and sprinkled garlic powder on it baked it until crunchy and added a little sugar with fresh basil in the mayo my husband thought the pita part was the best part of this salad delicious thank you

A very tasty salad.  Make sure you do NOT add the salad dressing until you're about to serve the salad--otherwise the lettuce will wilt and the croutons will be mushy.  Otherwise, this is a fun salad that everyone will enjoy!!

Delicious recipie.  I omitted the croutons because I'm on a low carb diet, and used non fat mayo.  I also added a touch more garlic powder to the dressing and some sliced green onions to the salad. I also recommend leaving the dressing as a side to pour for, as the romaine wilts so easily.

This was very good.  The only thing I will change next time is decreasing the amount of croutons.  I think after sitting for awhile it makes the salad taste a little salty.  I also highly recommend that you do not put the dressing on until ready to serve.

Good salad for the BLT lover.  The mayo\milk dressing didn't appeal to me so I replaced it with Ken's Bacon Ranch dressing.  Will make again.

Yum yum yum!  Doubled the dressing, adding just a little more garlic and a little less mayo.  Loved it!  I leave the dressing on the side and next time I may leave the tomatoes on the side to keep the romaine from wilting so soon.

This was good but there was just more bacon than I like to eat at once.  I tried less bacon but then it seemed to lack flavor.  Maybe next time I'll dinker with the dressing more:  add vinegar or lemon juice to zing it up or something.  Notice I said "next time" meaning we liked it well enough to make it again!

GREAT salad!  I've made this several times for company and everyone simply loves it.  I have even used real bacon bits for a faster (but more expensive) version and it worked great.  I do prefer to use the lower salted bacon though as it seems a bit too salty for me with regular bacon.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this salad!  Instead of regular bacon I used turkey bacon and it came out just as well.  Only one problem.  I took it to a Christmas party, 2 biggg bowls of it because I thought just one would get gobbled up in no time, and I ended up taking 2 biggg bowls of salad home with me. I still can't figure out why it was hardly touched, but it could be because of the crowd I was serving.  At any rate, this one gets 2 thumbs up!

Excellent salad, very easy to make. You can make up the dressing the day before and toss in final ingredients just prior to serving. I recommend using a lightly seasoned crouton to avoid too much salt.

Just a delicious salad with a wonderful texture. Even my husband who usually doesn't use anything on his salad but lemon juice, loved it.

This is maahvalous,dahling. To speed thingsup, I broiled the bacon( with some water in the bottom of the pan to prevent the bacon fat from smoking while the bacon cooked). Mean while, i washed the lettuce,made the dressing. Everyone practically inhaled this incredible dish. Thanks.

This was a huge hit.  The dressing is so simple. I now use it all the time for all kinds of salads .  My 14 year old son only liked Ranch dressing until he had this - now he always wants me to make this one.

Yummy! It was a hit. My husband loves BLT sandwiches and he loved this too. I didn't quite use all the dressing the recipe made and I also added avocados. It's a keeper. Serve with bread and you've got a meal!

I liked this recipe.  The only part that was time consuming was cooking the bacon, but I did it ahead of time when preparing another recipe, so it wasn't bad.  The rest was VERY easy, and it tasted GREAT!!  I brought a double recipe of this to a potluck, and it was one of the first salads to be finished.  I received lots of compliments.  I will make this one again.

This was a wonderful salad, the dressing was great, and the bacon gave it an amazing flavor.

This is a fantastic salad.  My husband's family is very picky and I always have leftovers, but they love this salad. No vegetables to pick out and the dressing was liked by all.  Turkey bacon made a great substitute and cut down on fat.

Really good salad.  I did not add any extra salt, and the salad was plenty salty from the bacon. I would not have wanted it any saltier. I am anxious to try this recipe in the summer with FRESH tomatoes!

Great! Quick! Delicious! My sister loves this so much that she makes it almost once a week!  I changed the mayo for 'mircle whip'...gave it an incredible kick!
