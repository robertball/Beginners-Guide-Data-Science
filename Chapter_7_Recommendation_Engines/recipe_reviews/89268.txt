Here is a really easy tip to check the temp of your oil - if you place the tip of a wooden spoon in the oil, and little bubbles form around it, the oil is ready to go.

Ok, I have been searching a lot of different sites for a great friend chicken recipe and I finally found one.

I think the overall mixture make for a great crunchy texture, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland without the use of the dip.  I believer a good friend chicken should not have to be dipped (or chicken strips in my case)

I followed the recipe exactly (including the beer, I used my favorite Icehouse) anyways, I used Granulated Garlic instead of Garlic salt and after I tested my first piece I decided it needed more flavor.  In the batter I put 2 table spoons of All Season Salt and 1 table spoons of Celery Salt and WOW!  They are awesome to eat even without dip.

Anyways, I wanted to leave my .02 cents because this recipe really is very good and worth it.

This chicken is really good and easy to prepare. Here is how I did it. I used legs and thighs which I removed the skin from. Heated the deep frier to 360 degrees and fried the legs 10 minutes and the thighs 15. I didn't  think it was spicy but very chrispy.

I tried this recipe after reading the reviews so I also doubled the spices, except for the black pepper. I also added a dash of tabasco to the wet ingredients. To boost the flavour of the chicken, I marinated it in buttermilk with garlic salt, poultry seasoning, and a dash of tabasco. Chicken was flavourful and moist and the coating was crispy and delicious. Make sure your oil is hot enough and, if you fry in batches that it comes back up to temp between batches. This will prevent greasy coating.

Wonderful recipe, very similar to my great-grandmother's old family recipe. I added seasoned salt instead of regular salt, added an extra tsp paprika and a tsp of chili powder, 1/4 tsp cumin and I also used shortening to fry the chicken instead of vegetable oil. It was amazing.

We recently made this recipe prior to a hurricane so that we would have something to eat after we lost power.  Several hours later, even after sitting on the counter, it was by far the most cripsy chicken I have ever eaten!  KFC's secret recipe has nothing on this one.  The spices were a little more salty than I like, but it was still a great tasting treat.  Next time I will use plain garlic instead of garlic salt, and maybe try some crushed red pepper or chili powder to bump up the spice.  This will definitley become a hurricane necessity along with bottle water and flashlights! Thanks for the post.

This recipe was absolutely outstanding!!
I have tried so many times to perfect fried chicken that is light, juicy and crispy that I had almost given up hope!
Now I have a family favourite that will grace my dinner table for years to come! This chicken rocks!! I am also going to try this batter with halibut.  Thanks so much for posting.

This was GREAT!  Finally, I know how to make a chicken coating that doesn't fall off when frying and stays crispy!  I even tried this on Chicken Fried Steak and it was delicious!

Delish!! I cooked this for dinner in the deep fryer and it was perfect! The crunch was fantastic! I used chicken breasts instead of chicken pieces. Very very yummy! This will replace my normal fried chicken recipe.

I left out all the spices except salt and pepper since I didnt' have them and it was still AWESOME. I've tried a few beer batter recipes on this site, and this has to be the best! It was great on onion rings, which I just ate, and the chicken is amazing too!

The texture of this batter was amazing!  Exactly what I was looking for.  It needed more seasoning for our desires, but is a fabulous base to start from.  The cooking time and temp was perfect!  The chicken was so juicy!  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I look forward to making it for years to come.

***************UPDATE********************

We made this again for a birthday party we were hosting.  Our family friend with leukemia barely eats due to her illness/medication.  She polished off 2 whole pieces!  Her mom was thrilled.  I think that says a lot about any recipe!  I'm changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.  Thank you again!

******NOTE****  I add 1 TBS dry mustard   1 TBS cayenne pepper to my recipe. (per 6 serving recipe)

We found the chicken to be very bland and definitely needed more salt. The dredging process worked very well for an crispy crunch, but I would say add salt to the flour mixture, perhaps a tablespoon for bigger flavor.

To those who found the chicken bland, try soaking in buttermilk with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning or a buttermilk-ranch dressing mix for at least an hour, or defrost the chicken in this mix. Adds juiciness and flavour to the chicken. 1-2 tbsp of vinegar or lemon juice plus milk to make one cup is a great buttermilk substitute.

This is a pretty good base for me...I like to spice it up a bit. My fryer wont handle more then one large chicken breast at a time,so I cooked them in the fryer for 5 mins each and then finshed them in the oven at 350...came out very nice and crispy.

The BEST fried chicken that has every come out of my kitchen. It was so crispy and juicy. Until now I haven't been able to find a batter that won't fall off during the frying. This recipe got more than a few WOW's from my husband. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Made this but I cheated.  I read the reviews about something was just missing with this recipe's indgredients. So I used my Emeril's original Essence Spice instead.  It has salt, paprika, black pepper, garlic, onion powder and other spices in it.  I know I'm strange, but I love fried chicken livers and they came out great  with this recipe.  Oh and I also used Olive oil instead of veggie.  Don't know if that made a difference.

My husband & I loved this recipe!! We pounded the chicken breasts thin and cut up in to slider size pieces before dipping in the flour and batter. We then added the cooked chicken to biscuits and they were amazing!!

This recipe is awesome!!!  Made this tonight for dinner and it turned out great.  Deep fried @ 350 for about 18 minutes for legs and 12-15 minutes for boneless chicken breasts.  Husband said it was the best fried chicken ever.  I will definitely be making it again.  I think next time though I might add a little more garlic salt and some season salt.  Just as a personal preference.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I bought a deep frier just to try this recipe.  It was soooo good.  Not very spicy, as others suggested, but you can always kick it up with your own spice mixture.  I've done this now with legs, thighs, and boneless strips...all good.  I also use 100% canola oil...expensive, but healthier.  I also used Panko bread crumbs in the wet mixture....had a REALLY good flavor, but you still have to add alittle flour, or the mxture will be too wet.

I am sooo happy! Finally found a recipe for perfect crispy fried chicken where the batter stays put! We buy a new Poultry Seasoning EVERY Thanksgiving so I couldn't believe it when there was none to be found in my pantry. So, I used granulated garlic in place of the garlic salt and added Lowery's (sp) seasoning salt to the flour. Also, used half beer and half water in the batter. Next time, I will make sure to have the poultry seasoning for more flavor but this was still delicious and very, very crispy. We loved it and will use this from now on. Thank you so much for sharing and making my life a little easier and happier!

This is a great recipe for crispy fried chcicken!! I too made a few changes; 1. I soaked my chicken in buttermilk for 30 minutes, and used it for dipping to give the chicken it's second coating. 2. I used montreal steak spice for the seasoning!! I know steak spice on chicken!?!? It tastes just like the colonels secret recipe!!!

I gave this recipe five stars because it's great for what it is and this may be the first time I've had the crispy part turn out similar to professionally made fried chicken, especially that it mostly sticks to skinless/boneless chicken breasts, and the meat itself was tender and tasty.  Bravo!

That said, I'm tempted to change up the recipe to give it more spunk: 1) Increase the spices somewhat, maybe substituting McCormicks' Montreal Chicken for the poultry seasoning and adding a bit of cayenne pepper.  2) Substitute corn meal for part of the flour.  3) Substitute milk for the water. 4) In the case of using skinless/boneless chicken, perhaps use the set-aside egg whites mixed with some milk for an initial coating to help with making the crispy coating stick better (yeap, this makes it quadruple-dipped!).  For the initial try, I only changed it to fry in shortening (the way my grandma did it), used water in place of beer, and because I thought I didn't have garlic salt, I combined garlic powder and salt.

The chicken was oh so crispy on the outside, mouth-watering juicy on the inside. The beer makes a huge difference, but my family has tried it both ways and loved it.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!!!! I have a very similar recipe but i've never tried triple dipping. anyway, we had this tonight and the whole family loved it! i used chicken breast for DH and kids. For myself, i used drumsticks, thighs, and wings(yes,for a little asian, i probably do eat more than a person who weighs 300 lbs). Dark meats are awesome! so much tastier! i did a little adjustment to the recipe. i doubled(well,almost) all the spices except for the salt/ garlic salt. i also added about a tablespoon of chili powder. SPICY....yummmmmmm!!! im heading to georgia in a few hours and i had already prepared the mix to share with the in-laws....just add water and egg yolk!! thanks for the recipe

This was excellent, actually reminded me of KFC extra crispy chicken wings (with a few modification it was the KFC hot wings)...The only thing I noticed was that it was bland, so on my subsequent batches I seasoned the chicken, added some Italian seasoning to the dry mixture, and added some hot sauce to the wet mixture (also I didn't have enough AP flour so I used self-rising).

I never follow a recipe exactly, so for the liquid part I used a can of beer, a healthy squirt of mustard, and two eggs. I used a big mound of flour, a few punches of pepper, and lots of Tony's Cajun seasoning. This was the best fried chicken of my life. Way better than any I've gotten from a professional restaurant. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and FULL of down home southern flavor. I absolutely plan on making this again:) ps...it was awesome as a midnight snack served cold!

This is pretty good fried chicken. I loved how thick the crust was on this. I only had boneless chicken breast, but wanted to try this recipe. I am sure the bone in would be great. For the 6 chicken breasts I cut all the ingredients in half including the cooking oil. I kept all the ingredients the same just cut the black pepper in half for personal choice. I thought the poultry seasoning gave it a nice flavor. I wish my chicken had a little more taste like the crust, but I could have seasoned the chicken to. It was skinless, so that probably didn't help. This is definitely a weekend type recipe, as it is kind of time-consuming. However, I have yet to see a fried chicken recipe that wasn't! TY

Oh my gosh, I have finally made fried chicken that was actually delicious! I'm so happy! Seriously, I try a few times a year to make a good fried chicken with little to no success. This was perfect! I did go a little heavy on all the seasonings and added some cayenne to the batter because we like a little more spice and it came out just perfect. It was light,crispy and juicy. The leftovers were scarfed up for lunch boxes the next day. Thank you for posting this recipe!

These were very good!! super moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside... I used some of the batter for some onion rings & it worked out really well also. Overall a great recipe for breading too!

EXCELLENT!!!! I've never made my own fried chicken before, but was in the mood to try, so I gave it a shot...YUMMY! After reading the reviews, I opted to double all the spices and add in 1 Tbsp. onion powder as well. I had no issue with flavorless, bland chicken by doing this. This was a messy project, lol, but sooooo worth it! I used my deep fryer and that made the frying process easier for me. The chicken came out moist and tender, just as I had hoped it would. I will definatley be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Simply FANTASTIC!   I followed recipie but also went heavy on paprika and chicken seasoning since most reviews say it was somewhat bland. My husband said it was the best chicken he has ever had!

I've made these twice since saving the recipe. The first time, I used 2 whole chickens with skin and bones, and the beer was a Boddington's Cream Ale (which is all we had but isn't anyone's favourite beer). The family were a little disappointed, as was I. A lot of work for not much flavour.

The second time I made it with skinless/boneless chicken breast, Newcastle Brown Ale (one of our preferred beers) and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. The family LOVED this result and have asked for more.

The amount of liquid called for in the recipe makes a batter that is, IMO, a little too thick to work with, so I used 1.5 times the beer called for and was happy with the consistency, but the coating wasn't quite as crispy as it was when I first made it with the liquids as listed in the recipe.

All things considered, definitely a keeper.

I have been impressed by many recipes on this site but this one takes the gold!! I have used this recipe not only for chicken but for pork chops and chicken fried steaks and my boyfriend has been eating chicken fried steak for many years and says this ws the best by far! Two things I did differently was one by mistake was I halved the recipe but still used 2 eggs and didn't deep fry but used a cast iron skillet.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!!! thanks so much!!

This chicken was amazing! I used garlic powder, instead of garlic salt and added more sage instead of paprika. The batter was thick, and crispy the way my family loves it! I used chicken breasts cut into strips and each batch cooked in about 15-20 minutes without being too brown or too oily. After each piece finished cooking, I placed it on a plate with paper-towels to soak up excess oil. Superb!

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe. I have one word for everyone out there that had the same idea. NO!! The triple dipped chicken first of all is way too much work, doesn't add anything and comes out way to battery with the batter falling off the chicken. I opted to take the wet mixture out and just use the flour mixture with my normal egg and milk mixute to dip the chicken in first. Then my chicken came out great with my revised recipe.

Loved the crunch and texture of this chicken, but like other reviewers found it very bland.  Added onion salt, more pepper and poultry seasoning and a pinch of chili powder to the second half of the batch and it was awesome.  Will triple the seasoning from the beginning next time as well as adding onion and garlic salt to the batter.  I also soaked the chicken overnight in buttermilk, salt and pepper, which made it incredibly juicy.  Will certainly make again with these small changes.

I read the reviews and thought this would be a good one to try.   We did not like it at all !!  To much coating and it had no taste. I followed the recipe exactly and thinned the batter, but it was so heavy and thick.  The chicken did stay moist but it had no flavor.  Will NOT use this again!

We've made this a number of times and it is always delicious, though tonight's was the best.  We used an IPA which was warm, so it was extra foamy and it was the lightest, crispiest fried chicken ever.  We will make it this way from now on.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good, and easy to make, but I agree, there was something missing. My son loved it and asked that I make it all the time. Hubby and I agree that I need to add something, dont' know what, the next time. I did try the celery salt, needs more. Also, made one package of chicken strips, could of halved the recipe and still had plenty of coating, and it only needed 8-10 minutes to cook.

This has to be the crispiest chicken I've EVER fried!!!  One thing though , I used a small amount of Lawry's seasoning salt, some cayenne pepper (LOVE cayenne pepper) and lemon pepper in the dry flour batter because my first batch came out pretty bland.  Otherwise, this is the best!!!

Tip....instead of draining on paper towels use a colander or wire rack. This allows the stream to escape and will keep the crust crispy :-)

Coating process is great! Good recipe but a little bland for us so we added cayenne pepper, onion powder, season salt, oregano and more garlic salt.  We used boneless skinless breasts cut into strips.  Honestly was as close to KFC we've ever made at home. :)

MOUTH WATERING! It's a very mild chicken batter, but I wouldn't change a thing.  Super crunchy, I made chicken strips and they were fabulous. I would have posted a picture, but it was gone before I could get to it!

Best fried chicken I have made.  Like many others, I found it to be a bit bland, but that is subjective.  I will just eventually find the spices and amounts that I prefer.  But the base is very good.  Crunchy. My first piece stuck to the aluminum basket in my deep fryer, so that caused the crust to come off.  I ditched the basket and just used tongs after that and all of the rest came out perfect.  Best thing is if you reheat the left overs in a 400 oven for 5-10 minutes, the chicken crisps right back up.

This is the BEST chicken ever! I batter dipped 1" strips of boneless skinless breasts. They only took about 10 minutes to cook. (Verified at 180 degrees with a meat thermometer.) After coating the chicken, I took the leftover flour and wash, and mixed it together with about 1/2 tsp. of baking powder. It scooped wonderfully and made delicious hush puppies. The hush puppies cooked for about 7 minutes at 350. Thanks for the great recipe!

Crunchy, but lacking immensely in flavour. I read the reviews and many stated the chicken was bland so I used a tablespoon each of onion salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and seasoned salt as well as a little over a teaspoon each of white pepper, paprika and cayenne. Skipped the poultry seasoning. Added Dijon mustard to the wet mixture and used Bud Light beer. The seasoning just get lost in the batter, though the chicken is moist it has nothing distinctive about it. I have a recipe given to me by a friend that is much better, though is less thick on the fried coating. I barely managed to eat a full piece... It was okay to try, but really wasn't worth calories or the 'yucky' way I'm feeling after eating it. Served this with "Dora's Dandelions" from AR (it's like a potato salad).

This turned out wonderful! The batter was thick and really easy to work with. I added a little tobasco to the wet mixture to give a little extra kick.

This calls for a bit too much flour in the recipe.  It drowns out the rest of the herbs/spices with it, so I cut it in half the 2nd time I made it and it was wonderful.  I highly recommend using half as much flour and adding more black pepper to your liking.  Paprika and red pepper are a must as well.

Like another reviewer, I found this recipe way too bland.  It stuck well to the chicken though, so maybe with a lot more seasoning it would work for my family.  I'll try it again with more spices.

This is fantastic!  The crust comes out exactly like Popeye's.  It's perfectly crispy and absolutely not the slightest bit greasy.  Even if you are doing it in several batches.  The first batch has to wait for the last batch and you'd never know the difference when it was put on the table.  Everyone was wowed at how enticing this looked.  I cut chicken breasts in to 3 pieces before battering and it was so good.  This is saved in my recipe box and I'll be visiting it again soon I'm sure!

BEST fried chicken EVER. I increased the seasoning amounts a little (3 cups of flour is A LOT and needs a lot of seasoning to stand up to it), but I didn't tinker with anything else. Perfect recipe in every way.

This is the best chicken ever! I have searched and searched for a recipe like this and never found it until now. I used Mississippi Mud Black and Tan Beer as that was what I had on hand. I will use this recipe for all my fried chicken. I may even use the suggestion and make Chicken Fried Steak this way. Will let you know how that turns out.

AWESOME & Super Crunchy. Hubby loved it! On the advice of other posts, I nearly doubled the spices and added a bit of tabasco in the wet mix. KFC has nothing on this.

This is a fair recipe. Not spicy with pepper enough for my taste and not nearly enough salt. Though cooked to specific directions, it was lacking a good amount of the crunchiness. I will make again but double the pepper in the dried mixture and add a little more salt to the batter.

This is really good fried chicken! I used tenders and didn't have garlic salt so I used a mixture of garlic powder and season-all salt. Mine could have used a little more salt in my opinion. Also a little messy battering but definitely worth it!

Awesome. Worked great with chicken strips and fish, too. What's more: I was all out, so substituted a bit of honey for the egg yolks ... worked fine. My kid loved this dish, and had a great time helping me triple-dip. Thanks!

This is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten!!! It was so crispy. I cant wait for the oportunity to make it again. We did not have the mess that everyone talked about. We dont deep fry in the house so I set a table up outside and placed the dry ingredients in a brown paper bag and the wet ingredients in a bowl. The only cleanup was the bowl and the deepfryer. The best!!!

The chicken was alright but the batter was very difficult to stick to the chicken. I used chicken legs and thighs - skin on. I thought it was very messy and took forever to fry. The end result was dark brown on the outside and a little pink on the inside even when i cooked them on low. Totally not worth the mess and effort. I will not be making this again.

I substituted butter milk for beer and this blew my soxs off,  I have a new fried chicken recipe!  For seasoning,  put the flavor in the flour you want and a level you like.  Garlic Salt and Black Pepper and poultry seasoning go a long way in this recipe.

If you want really crispy fried chicken, here it is. It works on whole cut up chicken, boneless skinless breasts, or boneless skinless thighs.

This will be my go to recipe for fried chicken. If you like a crispy crunchy chicken this for you.  I did sprinkle the chicken with seasoned salt because I thought the chicken would be bland without some salt on the actual meat.

I have made several different fried chicken recipes and this was by far my top favorite. My husband was saying over and over how good it was. i made this exactly as said and had plenty  of flavor. I  cut the chicken tenderloins in half to make chicken little sandwiches I  used Cuban rolls. Only thing I did extra was marinated my chicken in buttermilk and seasoning. I will make this my #1 fried chicken

When reading other's reviews, they said the chicken was bland, well I have a fix for you... we brine every piece of meat before we do anything with it overnite.  place your chicken in a gallon plastic bag, add 1/4 cup salt, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, about 10 peppercorns, 1 tbs poultry seasoning, fill bag with cold water, place in a bowl in the refrigerator overnight..drain dry and make your fried chicken! (or if you are from NYS - try the "cornell chicken marinade" I am sure you can find it online, but if you do use that marinade only brine 4-6 hrs. Hope you enjoy!

If you like seriously crispy fried chicken...the type that makes crumbs when you bite into it, then this recipe is for you. I love this kind of fried chicken. It's totally worth the extra dipping and the potential heart attack.

This recipe was very vague. I tried tweaking it and varying the thickness of the wet ingredients and no matter what I tried it did not work. The wet batter would not stay on and I cooked in the right temperature oil and the outside burned while the inside was raw. Will only try again on chicken tenders. Not a very good recipe at all.

The crust was really crispy but the breading could have used a little more flavour and some kick.  On the whole I will make it again but maybe tweak the spicing just a little...

I followed this recipe to the letter . In the frying all of the coating came off burning what was supposed to be the crispy part of the chicken, and yes I did use a thermomiter to make sure the oil stayed at the correct temp. I definatly will not be making this again . I will stick to my grandmother's tryed and true  recipe. Thank You Anyway.

I should've read the reviews since this is a 5 star recipe WITH CHANGES/ADDITIONS (according to previous reviewers). I made as written & the batter was very bland. It fried up picture perfect, just had no flavor. I'd actually give this a 3.5.

Really good idea on the triple dip to make it crunchy, but i didn't think it was at all spicy.  But really when I think of fried chicken i don't think of spicy.  Next time i think i will cook it in an outdoor fish fryer and have a party.

I must have fouled something up, because my chicken turned out a little hard in the crust. Granted my 7 yo helped me roll in flour mixture. I think the recipe is good, need to find my mistake.

This was by far the crispiest chicken I've ever had.  It was fairly easy to make and a big hit on our chicken and waffles night.  I would definitely make this again.  The coating is extremely thick and crunchy.

I made this recipe exactly as directed but my first few pieces of chicken came out as if they were encased in cement!  Added a bit more beer which helped a bit.  Not excited about the flavor so I reverted to my old standby.... sprinkle heavily with flour, garlic, salt, pepper and mix with either cream or milk to form a batter.  Was hoping this recipe would be a nice alternative but not this time...

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I'd cut into tenders and only cooked them for about 10 minutes. Perfectly cooked, moist fried chicken. Before this recipe I'd given up on making fried chicken, the breading would never stick, chicken would overcook, etc. This recipe worked perfectly!! Have made it 5 times now in the past 6 months and will continue to make it! Have made it in both a cast iron skillet and a deep fryer. Delicious!!

This is a GREAT chicken batter recipe.  I had to tweak it a little due to not having everything on hand...instead of using poultry seasoning, I used another seasoning blend I had on hand and instead of using beer, I used white wine...and it turned out excellent!  I was a little hesitant putting TABLESPOONS of seasoning into the flour, but after tasting the chicken I feel it was the perfect amount of seasoning.  I have a spiral notebook full of hand-written recipes that I write down when I run across something that's so fantastic I want to make it over and over.  In 13 years of having that notebook, I have only written down about 30 recipes.  THIS recipe got hand-written in that book tonight.  Thank you for sharing!

Recipe as is is just ok- texture was good but flavors VERY bland. Read other comments for ideas to spice it up to make it taste better. The 5-star ratings definitely are from people who made substitutions and liked what THEY made, so spice it up for sure. Also, if you use 3lbs of chicken cut into strips keep in mind that you will probably need more wet batter- I tried about 2 1/4lb and it was just barely enough.

Added a dash of chili flakes to the dry mix. Other than that, I followed this recipe to a 't'. 

CRISPY HEAVEN! It could really use a bit of jazzing up in the spice department, hence the 4 stars. But my husband loved it and I thought it was good too, especially for a first go at fried chicken! Will make again and looking forward to trying the cold leftovers :). 

CHANGES I will make next time: will add dash of tabasco to wet mix, and will add more chilli flakes to the dry mix.

The tip about using the tip of the wooden spoon to check oil temp was useful - thank you! :)

My family liked it, but next time I will use way more spices like others suggest. Chicken breast naturally doesn't have that much flavor (in my opinion) on its own so next time I will season chicken overnight or brine it first. I needed to add some beer to second batter after coating half of chicken because it became too thick from first few pieces being dipped. Adding the beer helped keep subsequent chicken pieces crispy and light. I also "sifted" out the doughy pieces that accumulated in the dry mix and that helped too.

Chicken came out moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Our kids thought is was amazing, so next time I'll make chicken tenders out of them. My wife and I thought they were a tad bland though, thus the reason for only 4 stars.

This definitely needed more seasoning. The chicken was crispy and tender but I think if I make it again I will season the chicken prior to putting it in the dry and wet mix.I think all the seasoning was lost in the batter.

Love this recipe! A flavorful beer makes all the difference! I don't have a deep fryer and cooking it on the stovetop is still amazing! All of the spices needed to be doubles when we did it with water instead of beer though.

This was my first time trying to make fried chicken without bread crumbs. It was the crispiest I've ever had! So delicious, I added more spice like other reviewers suggested, but to each their own. The base and texture is really what makes this great, seasoning is all personal preference. Thank you!

Made this today. I've never had luck with frying chicken. Either the center is too raw or the coating isn't good. But, this got an A+ from everyone at the table. I was worried that coating would be too spicy based on other comments so I used about half the pepper, but I wish I had used the whole amount because you couldn't taste it. The chicken breast was partially cooked in the crock-pot first and then I cut it into large strips, from there I followed the instructions above. The coating was crispy and had a great texture, but my batter was a bit thick and I found there were spots were it was a bit mushy under the outside crust after frying. Next time I would thin it out so it was more like waffle batter and less like drippy cookie dough and will cook evenly. Served these with waffles and corn and they were awesome! Would definitely make these again!!

The family LOVES this recipe and requests it all the time.  Great flavor, just remember to season chicken before you start the dipping or it can get bland.

I can't have gluten and couldn't even tell you the last time I had fried chicken. I made this using gluten free flour and used water instead of beer. I almost cried when I had the first bite. Soooo good! I used the leftover batter for onion rings.

This is by far the BEST fried chicken I have ever had. My very fussy family of five is still ranting about it two weeks later. FANTASTIC!! I would rate it five stars ++

I am not a great cook by any means and I am constantly afraid of messing up new recipes, but this was awesome!  Chicken turned out great the very first time!  Crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  This is definitely going to be my go-to-recipe for fried chicken.

I really thought this recipe was good. Developed a real nice crust but, I thought it was a little bland, needs more seasoning but with a few tweeks this would be a fantastic recipe.

I had to add a lot of seasonings to save the taste of this dish only to have my efforts fall into the oil as the chicken cooked. This was disappointing.

My husband and I tag teamed this recipe. We had been wanting to try it for awhile. I have to say we were REALLY disappointed. The breading had no flavor whatsoever and we even doubled the spices based on the reviews. I'm really not sure what happened. We may try again as we liked the concept of this but maybe make more tweaks to make it better. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe definitely gets 5 stars for presentation.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and crunchy.  However, it tastes bland without sauce.  It is definitely missing something.  This was my first time making fried chicken so I will have to experiment.

Editing my previous review... I accidentally made a comment related to a completely different recipe! This triple dipped fried chicken looks and tastes just like something you would get from your local supermarket's deli!!  Delicious! :-)

Loved this reipe!  I only had 8 chicken pieces; therefore I halved the recipe and it was more than enough. Had no beer, so used sparkling water. I seasoned everything according to our taste and what I had in the spice rack and it turned out GREAT! Even the next day it was crispy and delicious. Nothing bland about this! I will never bother with another fried chicken recipe. This is IT.

OK but bland, until I doubled the seasonings and added sage, paprika, and Pampered Chef Parmesan and Garlic mix.  Instead of water, used buttermilk cut w/a little milk.  Lowered the heat a little--didn't burn, stayed crispy.  In vegetable oil, added a smidge of lard and a smidge of butter.  Time to dump the oil anyway.  Turned out really good.  Made it 3 stars because I had to tweak so much.

Very good recipe.  Next time, I would dip the chicken only twice because I prefer less breading.  The beer adds a different taste.

Me and my boyfriend cooked up this dish tonight.  Overall, the chicken turned out great.  The coating was crunchy and the chicken was moist.  It was a bit time consuming to make.  It took us about two hours from start to finish.  One definite thing I will change next time is to add more seasoning to the dry rub.  Cayenne pepper is going to be this recipes new best friend.

I made this with a few variations. Instead of poultry seasonings I used 1 TBSP Greek seasoning in both the wet and dry mix. I didn't use the paprika. I also added about  2 TSP of Rosemary and 2 TSP of Oregano to the Dry mix. My family loved the chicken like this.

I was surprised how bland this was with all of the seasoning in the batter.  It looked really pretty, the coating puffed up nicely and the chicken was really moist but very unflavorful.

Sorry, this may have worked for some folks but I followed directions to the letter. I used fresh peanut oil kept my temperature at the prescribed 350 degrees.
I used chicken thighs of equal size,,,just did not work for me at all. I make an oven fried chicken with ranch dressing and potato flakes and it would blow this recipe miles out of the water,,,sorry.

Wow!! Thought that it was best chicken ever. I wasn't conservative with the spices. I also added some tobasco. Had plenty coating left over, so I fried spoonfulls of it. Everything got ate. I really did make a mess of the kitchen though.
Thanks for sharing.

EXCELLENT....I actually made 2 batches, the first as specified but with about 3/4 of a tablespoon of poultry seasoning and while that was cooking, I read some reviews and added a teaspoon of Mccormicks chicken spice and I liked that one better, will still be tweaking around with the spices but OMG it's GOOD :)

Oh this is really good! I did up the spices just a little bit but I didn't really measure. I didn't have a regular beer on hand so I used a Guinness that I had left from St. Patrick's day. Worked really well, nice flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing! I brined the chicken first and I found it made the chicken juicier. I also took the recipe's advice and used beer rather than water  and I found that it made the skin a lot better; more crackly!

I followed the recipe proportions and used water, not beer.  Like some other reviewers I found the chicken not spicy at all but it was crisp and the batter kept the boneless breast tenders moist.  I'll make this again, but next time will add much more spice, maybe Chef Paul's cajun seasoning blend.

I made this again and added Lawyers season salt as well as Franks hot sauce in the beer batter, also whole egg no yokes only..this chicken is awesome!!  Did it outside on teh side burner of the grill and kept it warm on the top burner inside the grill!!

Wow...ono!  I added a few strips of bacon to the frying oil, brown, then remove before frying the chicken and it enhanced the flavor.  I've made this a few times and have since adjusted some of the spices and even add cayenne powder for a nice kick.  Never thought of trying this recipe on onion rings and will try it today for a potluck blessing.  Aloha.

Good not wow.  Upped the spices based on feedback from other reviewers, but otherwise made as described.  Have to say even with upping the spices it could have used more flavor.  Just lacked something.  I soaked the chicken in buttermilk, 1 T dijon mustard, 1.5 tsp dry mustard, 1 T salt & 1 T cayenne for 2 days prior to making. Added 2 T garlic powder, 1 T salt, 2 T celery salt, 2 T onion powder, 1.5 tsp baking powder & 2 T Adobo with cumin to the existing dry mix ingredients.  Otherwise cooked as noted.  Tasty, but nothing to write home about.

I reduced the recipe to serve 3.worked out great.I did add celery salt (1 1/4 tsp),onion powder (1 1/4 tsP) and  1 1/2 tsp seasoning salt.Very tasty yet still need a little something to lift up the flavor a bit.My kids loved it as well myself but we all agreed it need's to be a bit more spicy.Next time i will add a dash of cayenne pepper.Also i will marinate my chicken over night to give the meat some added flavor.Was very crispy and that is what i was looking for.Thanks for a great base recipe :) oh and i did use whole wheat pastry flour and you could not tell it wasnt white flour!

Mmmm good!  This a great recipe!  I made it today for the first time, and everybody raved about it!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I cut into tenders, substituted a teaspoon chipotle pepper for the Tablespoon of black pepper.  Those were my only changes.  I'm thinking of trying finely ground corn flakes for the third dip next time for a richer color.

I have never battered chicken before frying it but I am sure glad I read this recipe and tried it tonight! I usually just dip in flour, egg, flour again and fry but I wanted to try something different as to make a thicker crust on the meat. The crust was so crispy and delicious and the chicken was moist and melted in your mouth! I will be using this recipe every time I fry chicken now and can see myself using it on veggies, too.

These were in a word...YUMMY! I used boneless skinless breasts cut into strips and made chicken tenders, cooked 4 - 6 minutes per side, other than that the recipe was followed exactly. Both my kids and bf said they were the best chicken tenders they ever had. I've made them twice now and both times the crust was crispy and the chicken juicy. I plan on using the batter recipe on perch and possibly country fried steaks. Thanks for the recipe!

This was the best fried chicken recipe I tried so far. I will continue to use this. Make sure you use enough paprika and you won't need extra spice. Instead of dipping it into 2 bowls I put the egg in one bowl and the flour mix in the other. Dipped in the egg, then flour and again, coating it twice. Super crispy! Also try to let the chicken sit for about 20 minutes before frying it. The coating will have a chance to set better to prevent it flying off.

It WAS crunchy, but the overall flavor wasn't anything special.  The deep frying takes quite a while, so for me, the reward was not worth the effort.

The crunchy coating is deeeeelish...  A little bit spicy (but not hot) and much better than my boring flour, salt and pepper -old- version.

Well, I certainly found out that my culinary skills are nowhere near sufficient to attempt such a laborious tasking. What I did find out was, how efficiently I was able to discard any example of my incriminating evidence. I tried my best to follow the recipe as it was written. I was able to hide the contents of both my flour bowl and my batter bowl in a freshly dug hole next to the birdbath. I tipped over all of the birdbaths dirty icky contents' directly on top of the covered hole. I am just glad that there were no witnesses! I think that I'll stick to eggrolls, Crabcakes, and Crab Rangoons next time. Making Great Fried Chicken is an Art form. I'll never say. "It's a snap, I will whip some right up for you, again!" It's a really great recipe, I still received WOW's on the Chicken that I was able to salvage!

This recipe is the real deal.  Its the first fried chicken I've ever made that seems to taste better the second and third day. At the risk of sounding lame, I did change the recipe a bit.  I brined the chicken before  cooking. But that lovely cracker-like crust is just amazing.

This chicken was excellent. I didn't have poultry seasoning so I just used paprika, a little cayenne and the rest of the ingredients. The wooden spoon tip in the review comments was a great idea!  Definitely 5 stars in crispness!  Even leftovers!  Will definitely make it again!

This batter actually stays on the chicken! I agree that it needs additional spices which is why I went with 4 stars and not 5. For the batter on its own, it gets 5 stars just for staying on the chicken and being crunchy!

I made it with Morning Star Veggie patties. Makes a great chicken fried steak for vegetarians.  When I was a carnivore, 15 yrs ago, this is the recipe I used when frying chicken.  I learned it from my father in law, who use to cook when he was in the army. 
He was a great cook, and a wonderful guy. Taught me alot. Thanks, Dad Peeples.

The  SEARCH  IS NOW OVER !!!! This truly thePERFECT FRIED CHICKEN RECIPE EVER !!!
I have been experimenting  with  other recipes  for  YEARS (this  is not an EXAGGERATION) on Fried chicken but they did not come out so good. The coating in this recipes does not fall off when frying nor when taking it out,it most definitely does stay on.  I took some hints from  the other readers stating that the flour mixture was to bland so following the recipe I added in some more spices like my husband's Weber 
K C BBQ rub,long with just a dash of cumin, seasoned salt, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. the suggested time for frying  and at  350 was just perfect , I cooked  the drumsticks at 350 for 18 minutes and the chicken came out a PICTURE PERFECT GOLDEN BROWN . I will definitely  will used this recipe again . 
P.S  I also used the article  here in  ALL RECIPES by  Carl Hanson on How To Fried Chicken and the tip about using  parchment paper and letting  the coating  sit for a little  while.

This recipe is decent fried chicken but for such a large amount of work and mess it's really not worth the effort.  You are better off just doing a flour dredge letting it sit for 30 minutes and frying as usual.  Close but no cigar.

No changes. 
What a mess! With all the batter stuck to my fingers, I'm lucky they didn't get cooked. 
Use one hand for this. 
 I sliced chicken breasts and made strips with cream gravy and mashed potatoes. 
This chicken came out great.  Totally love this method! The chicken came out perfectly. Nice crisp coating. 
My next go, I will let rest 10 minutes after first dredge and double the flour mixture of the second dredge and let several pieces at a time remain for just a minute before putting in the oil. I cooked just a few at a time.
Leftovers were just as good.
Excellent!!!

I like mine with more spice, so next time I'll add some hot sauce to the wet mixture.  It was perfectly crispy, even the next day when I ate the leftovers cold.

I have a infrared thermometer that I checked my oil temp with.  Make sure it doesn't get above 400 because canola/peanut oil will start to smoke and give your chicken a rancid flavor.  Also try to keep the temp above 350, that keeps the oil from soaking into the breading and making it greasy.

The chicken was juicy and the crust was crunchy, so a ***** for texture. The batter/breaking was very bland, as written, so only *** for flavor. I'd make this again, but next time I'll put a lot more spice/herb flavoring into the coatings; maybe marinate the chicken before dipping, as well.

I made this recipe as is and I felt like it was very bland. No kick to it like described. Great crunch though. I would add more spices and salt to give it more flavor.

I altered to use less bowls for clean up and also used the spices that I and my family like.  Seeing it was my first time I used the bowls but next time I may use gal. zip lock and use as shake n bake. I also used whole eggs and a splash of beer.  Beer goes to the cook. I also eliminated one bowl of flour and just seasoned my flour and egg. Dip wet chx. in flour, dip in egg and dip in flour again. You can't over spice flour so put the spice back in the flour.  The base is perfect for crunch. The Colonel has nothing on this.  Made fried chx. for years and this is ultimately the best.

This was a nice recipe.  The flavour was really very nice and I adjusted the salt to my liking.  The only thing I found was that either I didn't thin the batter enough or something because it was too thick on my chicken.  I think maybe next time I will not triple dip OR just do the flour coating which was more than enough flavour and crispness

EXCELLENT! Instead of frying a cut-up chicken, I made nuggets from boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Great for a party.

Very crispy coating and easy to make. I would spice the beer batter up with a little heat and (as I noticed on another review), some of Emeril's Essence. Overall very good way to make fried chicken!

This was the best fried chicken I've ever tasted. I followed the instructions exactly except I also salted both batches of flour. It was awesome. I ate all of the crust it was so good. My chicken breasts were very large so I transferred them to the oven so that the crust didn't get too brown. Took another 12 minutes at 350 degrees.

Absolutely the most crunchy, juicy and flavorful fried chicken I've ever made. Didn't have beer so I used chicken broth. Also added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Have mercy!! So delicious. I'd give it 10 stars if could.

This was my first attempt at chicken in the deep fryer and we would call it a success. The meat was perfect. I did brine the pieces for an hour which always helps with the juiciness. 
I will use this recipe again and for my own tastes I will likely try it without the 2nd dipping in the dry mix as I ended up with more coating than we prefer. I will also knock up the spice a bit (cayenne?) because I just like chicken with a kick. Anyway, this was an awesome starting place for someone who was new at this.

Yesterday I marinated 9 chicken breast in the same spices. Today I googled "crispy fried chicken recipes" and clicked this one. Read some reviews and followed the recipe. Added an extra cup of flour, one extra egg yolk, tbsp of salt and used nearly all of a 12 oz bottle of Heineken beer. The house smells amazing and my husband keeps coming up from the garage to steal a taste. Our three yr is hard to please but she's following me around the kitchen for another taste. This recipe is the closest to the KFC flavor I've tried. Fam fav recipe for the books! Wouldn't fry chicken any other way! Thank you

This is by far my family's favorite fried chicken recipe. It's a great recipe, but personally I find it a bit bland. If you go heavy on the seasoning, it's better. Using a deep fryer makes the coating more uniform. I usually make a double batch of chicken strips with the batter. It's great on a salad for lunch the next day, or the kids eat it cold with dip.

Excellent fried chicken. I used water instead of beer and doubled the dry ingredients except for the flour and black pepper, after reading that some didn't think it had enough flavor. However, it made it just a little bit too salty. I may cut it by a teaspoon or a teaspoon and a half.

I made chicken strips with this recipe, not only did my kids like it, but it's the first time that my wife said I did a good job cooking something!!! I think I want to add a little cayenne powder next time to give it a nice spicy kick.

I made this with boneless breasts, and it was very light and crispy.  I made a few adjustments, because I ran out of oil..I started with Safflower Oil, and then added non-hydrogenated shortening.  I also sprinked Trader Joe's Garlic Salt on the chicken before dipping, and added Lawry's season salt to the dry mix.  It turned out amazing!

Great recipe definitely needs some extra luvin though on the flavor i had to add lots of all season salt, garlic powder, ceyenne pepper, and chicken bouillon. And the Idea with the triple dip is great for a good crunch 

Ps. I used cisco... already making fried chicken might as well make it with the best 

Pss. And the beer I used was Samuel smith's pure brewed organic lager

Wow--I've never made fried chicken that turned out so crispy before!  I was looking for a recipe for chicken to take to a picnic and this definitely delivered.  My husband thought the spices could be kicked up next time but I thought they were perfect.  I soaked my chicken in buttermilk for a few hours before frying (just because I had some) and served with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was awesome, although i missed a step because i read the directions quick and only dipped the chicken in the beer batter first then the dry batter it still turned out excellent... the spice content was just right but I added a little more salt after reading some other excellent comments... recommend this recipe to anyone who doesnt like things too spicy. picture was under 960px and wont accept it.

This recipe was out of this world. I added a tsp of chili powder but that's it, and this was the crispiest, most flavorful fried chicken I have ever had. I used some of the batter for onion rings and they were terrific as well.I did change the oil temp from 350 to 400 (as stated in my fryer directions)because it took longer than the estimated time. THIS is my go to fried chicken recipe and no other one will do!

this is a terrific batter recipe. its super easy to modify, and its great on fish as well as chicken.  I use a deep fryer to cook either and they always turn out delicious. people at work want the recipe,  my wife loves it.

Triple Dipped Fried Chicken was amazing! Easy recipe, great crunchy texture, it wasn't spicy at all so next time I will experiment with other spices to give it a bit more flavor. It was a big hit with the kids!

The recipe itself was great, but I have an issue with it sticking to the basket in the deep fryer. What am I doing wrong?

Saw this come through in my email the other day - and since I've never been able to get a decent crunch to my chicken, definitely wanted to try this.

Awesome. Worked wonderfully. Used exact recipe minus just a little pepper as the gf is not into spicy foods.  Should have left it in, but will next time and maybe even ratchet it up a bit.  Also used boneless breasts sliced into half to thin them down a bit.  Had to cut down the oil temperature to about 300-325 to get the crust crunchy and brown properly without drying out the chicken.

This will be my NEW "go to" fried chicken!

Made this last night, so yummy! I added the cayenne and the cajun spices like the video suggested for the extra kick... absolutely delicious and crispy! This is definitely going in the rotation.

Love this chicken. The hubby and kids love it too. Perfect seasoning.  I found that depending on how crispy you like your chicken,  you might not need the 15 -18 minutes for cooking.

Nice and crispy, but the coating was bland.  Would add more seasonings/salt/pepper/different ones as well?  I made a half batch.

The flour coating was too thick. After  frying, it was hard and crunchy, not crispy. There was not enough seasoning so the chicken was bland.

The spices need a bit punching up for my taste, especially the basic salt-and-pepper components. But the triple-dip technique is solid, and the results are crispy and delicious! I used a package of chicken thighs we had on hand.

Its amazing I change some things, I used a can of beer and instead using all the condiments I only used TONY'S!!!  And i marinated the pieces with buttermilk so it was really juicy! !pieces of chicken were small so the time to cook was like 10 minutes I burn some pieces so I reduce the temperature to 325, the chicken was really good!!

Phenomenal recipe! I made this using my own gluten-free flour blend and a sorghum beer and it came out wonderfully! My only comment is to not be stingy with the salt.

Also, frying the extra batter in the remaining oil makes insanely delicious (although ridiculously unhealthy) treats.

I made this recipe as written, however did add more pepper, paprika, salt and poultry seasoning.  It cooked very well, was very crisp, and the chicken was very moist.  However, despite being able to actually see the spice in the breading, we could not taste any of it at all. Honestly, the most bland chicken we have ever had.

I attempted fried chicken a few times and it was never really good - until this recipe.  It is hands down the best fried chicken I have ever had.  I "marinated" the chicken in buttermilk for 4 hours, but it isn't necessary for it to turn out fantastic!!

I substituted pancake mix for flour in the wet mix and used boneless chicken breast cut into large nuggets. These came out so amazing that my husband thinks we've outdone the secret recipe of the local restaurant famous for their chicken nuggets!

This is some great st**f but I like spicy and added a table spoon store bought ghost peper sause and hobinero sause a tble spoon each and it was awsome. On the last piece I did 5 times dipped and it was the best. It gave it the little more of a bite I was looking for. I know your thinking WHAT GHOST PEPPER?!!! its actually not thant bad it just has a delayed kick and lasts longer and the hobinero has a right away kick. Also the hobinero has a great taste even if you don't like hot and thin the hot out even more. This was the best recipe I've found in over a year.

Two words!!  Tony Chachere's!!!!!!   You want this fantastic recipe the BEST it can be! Put a 1/8 cup TC's in dry and the same in the wet. Thats right...THAT much. (But I made a FEAST of wings n drummies...so maybe cut that back a bit for just a family..lol)  I tried it a few ways. ALWAYS came out great.  I'm a spice lover so I beefed it up from the get go. I could tell from the written recipe it didnt have enough spice for me..lol.  This is a wonderful recipe though!

I made this chicken using bone in, skin on chicken breasts and the end result was ok - but not super. I only soaked my chicken in buttermilk for as long as the recipe called for, so my chicken was a bit drier than I would have liked. I may try this recipe again, being sure to do the buttermilk step for 6-8 hours and I may try boneless skinless breasts.

Very good.  Was happy to find a breading that actually stuck to the chicken.  The breading was a little bland but nothing that a few extra spices can't cure.  It is a keeper.

It came out crispy, but bland.  I think there needs to be more spices added to the coating. Still searching for that perfect fried chicken recipe!

Soak your chicken pieces in cold salted water overnight in the frig.  Add garlic salt, too (optional).

Just finished eating it for dinner. GREAT! Based upon other comments I decided to add the spices to the batter as well as the dry. I also dropped the poultry seasoning for oregano. It was outstanding. I made some popcorn chicken with it that was great. This is a recipe I will use frequently. Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe for dinner tonight...fabulous!  The only thing I did additionally is I brined the chicken in a basic salt, sugar, soy sauce brine ahead of time.  The chicken was tasty and juicy.  The breading was light and crispy!  Great recipe!

Wow!  Hubby and I just loved this fried chicken!  He said it put extra tasty crispy to shame.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

*Update - The Next Day
Holy cow!  I have never liked cold fried chicken, but several reviewers said this chicken was great cold, and I didn't have a lot of time for lunch, so I thought, why not.   Wow!  I think I like it better cold than hot.  Who knew!!!

I have been looking for something to replace KFC chicken in our meal cycle (too expensive) - this works! By far the best fried chicken I've ever made and one of the best I've ever had! I used the cheapest beer I could find, and used boneless chicken breast cut into thirds. Awesome!

My kids don't like anything and they LOVED this!  My husband on the other hand thought it was a little too much batter, but that's the point right??? Triple Dipped Fried Chicken, thus the name.  We love this one!!!!!!

i loved it, but my kids thought it was too spicy.  i'll definitely try it again, but i'll ease up on the pepper.  i actually thought it was tastier the next day even if it wasn't as crispy.

Nice and crispy, the first time we made this I let my girls help with it. My twelve year old miscalculated the garlic salt and used one cup  OOpps :) was way to salty to eat but we pulled off the skin and chicken tasted fine. 
The coating stayed on and it fried up perfect. I always fear making fried chicken because of the coating falling off. This one works great!

Excellent crispy crust.  I wouldn't say its spicy and I added cayenne pepper.  I used boneless skinless cx thighs.  They cooked in approx 5-7 min. 2 of us gave it 5 stars 3 gave it 4 stars.  Next time I'll try w/ a cut up chicken.  I used 3 lbs cx thighs, but started to run out of the wet mixture.  I will definitely make this again.

I would have given this more stars if I could have.  I used boneless chicken breast that I had pounded thin for a southern chicken fried chicken dinner served with cream gravy and it was awesome!  Thanks so much!

This chicken has the best coating I have ever made from scratch.  Great recipe the whole family loved including the kids!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

The best fried chicken I ever made.  I started out using a frying pan- works better with a deep fryer.  This is a no fail, best batter with or without skin chicken.  It does not dry out and even after a day in the fridge - it was even better.  Hint:  I use milk instead of beer and I was a little more "free" with spices. Thanks!

Was delicious.  Loved the crunchy coating.  I think the only thing I will change is to add more seasoning.  But other than that, great!

Crispy, yes, too crispy, yes, cement like.  Although I followed the recipe, I was very disappointed.  The only thing I changed was to triple the seasoning, and it still had no heat.  Will not make again...ever!

Followed the recipe exactly as written using the beer in the wet mix.  This was bland and the breading was way too thick for my taste and seemed to really absorb the oil.  Will not be making again.

This recipe sounded delicious and my mouth watered as I made the dry mix and the batter.  I did not like how this turned out at all.  It formed more of a hard shell rather than turn "crispy."  Once you peeled the shell off in one piece, the skin was still in tact underneath.  I love batter so I tried nibbling on it but it had no flavor.  I will definitely stick to the basic flour, salt and pepper.

After three days of waiting to cook this chicken... (life kept happening). All I can say is...   MY grandmas would have been proud.  The recipe was amazing, tasty and so simple to follow.  
I was apprehensive to use this recipe...  Does Triple dipped mean triple work and triple messy!   NO
It was easier than what I was doing, The flour really stuck and my frying pan was easy to clean!
By Far the Best Tasting Chicken.  Many have compared it KFC, in my opinion this leaves Popeye's and KFC in the dust!!   Thank you for submitting this!

Great recipe.  I added a little cornstarch to the liquid batter because it was a little runny.  Very crispy and flavorful.

I used this as a coating for chicken nuggets.  The only thing I did differently was to add some panko bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and instead of paprika I used essence, to the dry ingredients.

This is a good recipe thanks for sharing

This recipe is wonderful I like spicy so I added lots more garlic, paprika, salt and I used my favoite beer. I was in a hurry so I sliced up 3 chicken breasts into fingers, battered them then fried them about 5 minutes covered, microwaved them for 4 minutes, then fried them an additional 5 minutes covered and they were awesome. KFC could never beat this recipe.

It was good chicken, this is what i liked: loved the crunch on the chicken, it was not that hard to make, overall all good recipe and similar to KFc,  BUT things that I was not crazy about were: mild taste kind of not spicy and needed some kick in it, also because of the triple flour dip - that thing took so much flour i was shocked (and used whole wheat next time... lol)... for me 4 star recipe - if improved on spicing yes I would have given 5 stars no problem! thanks for sharing it with us. It's a keeper!

I used more seasoning than called for. I used onion powder, garlic powder and seasoned salt on the bare chicken first and then I seasoned the dry flour and then i seasoned the wet batter. I likealot of flavor in my chicken and by adding a touch more than called for it came out excellent. I used a full bottle of bear because the batter was to thick. I followed all directions and I must say this was some of the best chicken I've had in ages. This recipe is a keeper.

I gave this 4 stars only because it wasn't at all spicy.  It "was" the best crust I have ever tasted on chicken, just needed a little more salt.  I was trying out my new deep fryer with this and I will have to play with the cook times.  When the crust was done to perfection, the chicken was still raw in the middle.  I made drumsticks with this coating and everyone loved the chicken once I put them in 375 degree oven for a 1/2 hour.  I will definitely make this my permanent recipe for fried chicken.

I first used this recipe with pork loin chops - excelant! I believe that this could serve it's purpose with anything that is deep fried, meat or veggies. 
                    Thanks,

This makes amazing fried chicken.  It is well worth the mess and the work.  I used two ziplock baggies for the flour and the batter.  Worked great!  I fried it in my electric skillet.

Wow. Wow. Wow.  I cut up chicken breasts into strips and came out with a PERFECT fried chicken meal.  Didn't have poultry seasoning, but did add 1 Tbsp seasoned salt and 1 Tbsp celery salt.  Nice flavor, juicy  chicken.. SUPER crispy!

I made this recipe with party wings, and used water instead of beer.  I threw them in my fry daddy so they cooked pretty quick.  Dropped some "Franks Red Hot" on em and enjoyed.  The batter was a lil thick but addictive.  My girlfriend enjoyed this, she says we need to open up a chain of chicken stores.

We really liked this recipe a lot. I used bone in chicken for my husband but bonesless, skinless chicken for myself and they turned out great. I made the mistake on the first batch of putting the chicken in the basket of my deep fryer on the first batch (I'm a beginner!) and that was a mess but once I realized I should just drop it right in the oil it turned out perfect.

I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 only because I found the gravy to be very bland until I doctored it up. The chicken was great, if you like it crispy this is the recipe to use, though I would suggest a bit more seasoning in the batter. To the gravy I added some salt and pepper and about 1/4 tsp each of thyme and sage. I also added about 1/2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. With these additions the gravy was delicious. Next time I will also add some Old Bay to the batter for the chicken too.

Absolutely delicious.  As suggested by another reviewer, I added some crushed red pepper to the flour mix yet, it still wasn't at all spicy. Nonetheless, I would make again.

I liked how crispy the chicken came out, in my opinion the chicken needed a little more salt but other than that it was quite good. It is a little messy with the beer batter but well worth it. I used garlic powder with 1 tsp. of salt since I didn't have garlic salt. Other than that change in the recipe I followed it and it was delicious.

This recipe is awesome!  A definite keeper.  I used beer and made it exactly as written with no changes and it was excellent.  The batter was very flavorful and the chicken was definitely crunchy. I think I will use 1/2 cup more beer to thin it out next time because it was almost too crunchy for me, but my guests loved it. I then decided to try some as others did, (cold) and it was very good, maybe even better.  Thanks for this recipe.

My husband just bought me a new deep fryer and this recipe works great. I used the beer instead of water which gave it a great taste. With us living in West Africa you can't get KFC chichken here and this recipe it just as good as KFC even cold as a leftover too. I will use this recipe again.

The chicken was crispy, but the flavor was bland (it did not taste like KFC to me though it was very crisp).  I think that I will stick to grilled or baked instead.  The mess, and time it took to make this chicken was not worth the finished product.

I absolutely love this recipe. I rinse the chicken in water and by adding some baking powder to the dry mix, I find you don’t need to dip in the dry then the wet. I go straight from the strainer to the wet and coat thoroughly with the dry. Deep fry it and the family eats it all!

This was a hit with the family. I did use “Slap Yo Mama” Cajun seasoning instead of poultry and chipotle for the paprika and it was like eating Popeyes spicy chicken. We used chicken thighs with bone and skin and boneless chicken thighs. My son made sammiches with the boneless thighs and a mock Raising Canes sauce he made.

I cook this recipe all the time. I add some more spices to it(usually some Louisiana Cajun seasoning as I live in Louisiana)  but it is such a perfect recipe regardless. My wife and kids like a thick batter and thats exactly what you get...Thick, Crunchy,moist and full of flavor.

THIS WAS A HIT!!! reason why I chose this recipe was bc everything was in my pantry and spice cabinet, which was perfect. My 9 year old helped me make it and she absolutely loved making it and of course eating it with a side of honey BBQ sauce!!! We used filleted chicken breast and added a tablespoon of Cayenne pepper (no Cajun) spiciness was on point.

I used this recipe with an air fryer so maybe that’s what the issue was, but this was the worst tasting fried chicken I’ve ever had.  I followed the recipe to a t and it tasted awful.

My first time making fried chicken. It was super crispy & delicious. I only used chicken breast. Next time I will try other pieces, but I wasn’t sure if I would need to par boil. My son loved it too and he’s really picky.

I have NEVER had  homemade fried chicken this perfect and delicious before in my life.  This method is easier and less messy than pan frying and definitely tastier!  (I removed the skin as suggested by another reviewer)

If the recipe didn't turn out for you, the problem isn't the recipe.

The picture is of two bone in breasts after 18 minutes in the deep fryer.

Make sure your oil is not too hot.  375 degrees then it should fry at around 350.  Don't crowd the chicken in the fryer.  Its delicious said everyone.

Was very crispy and not dried out at all but you need to double all the spices it calls for , even then it's still a little bland just throw a ton of spice in it and salt

I changed the seasonings, and used my personal spicy chicken rub. But breading technique is spot on. The most completely breaded and most crispy fried chicken ive ever made.  I have pictures but not sure how to upload.

The crunch was decent but the recipe was very bland and tasted too much like straight flour. I read the other reviews that said the spices were lacking so I doubled up on the measurements and still not very good. The dredging method was good, but everything else was just kind of meh. On to the next recipe!

This is a good solid breading for chicken. As someone who has tried well over 10 breading recipes, I can confidently say that while this isn't the best one - it's pretty good. Not too hard to do, and tastes good.

Taste was excellent!  I added quite a bit more seasoning in the flour, as it never seems to be enough.  This again was a great tasting recipe, but it requires a lot of  work, and frying chicken in small batches goes on forever....start early!!

So delicious!

I do think the flour and batter mixtures were a bit much. I had a ton left over!

I used Pabst Blue Ribbon for the beer batter. Was the only beer I could find in a single can, and it worked well!

I would definitely add about 2 tbsp of cayenne instead of 1.

I recommend keeping the chicken out until it's close to room temperature. It's helps prevent the crust from burning and will cook at a more even rate. Do the larger cuts first like the breast and thighs--then about halfway in, toss in the drumsticks and wings. If you put all of it in at once, cooking will not be even because the meat will cool the oil down. Or you could do the larger cuts as the first batch, then the smaller cuts as a second batch. The larger cuts will still be pretty hot when the smaller cuts finish.

I would also use less beer/water than is suggested so you can get a creamier/thicker batter instead of runny.

This is the best fried chicken that I've ever made. I used boneless breasts and cut into strips. The triple dip gave a great cripsy coating that stayed crisp. Excellent.

I loved this recipe the only one I found to make it so crispy but my roommates and I love spicy so instead of beer I did 1 1/2cup of Red Hots hot sauce and about 1/2 cup of water into the batter and mixed until it was not too thick. And in the flour mixture I added red pepper flakes and extra hot Mexican chili powder and it’s very spicy but really good.

Made it as written the first time, and the chicken (boneless, skinless breasts cut into strips) came out juicy with the breading nice and crispy. I used my small deep fryer set to 350, and cooked two strips at a time for 9-10 minutes, keeping the done strips warm in 170 degree oven. BUT, the breading was bland and had no taste.

Second time, I doubled all the spices, but in place of garlic salt used garlic powder and salt separately, added 3T onion powder, 1t cayenne pepper, and used sage instead of poultry seasoning. I also added  a T salt to the wet mixture. It was perfect!

For those having trouble with the thickness of the wet mixture, use an entire 12 oz bottle of beer initially. Err on the side of it being too thin rather than too thick. As the dry mixture begins to thicken the wet, add a splash of beer at a time to thin it, and whisk again to incorporate the dry clumps.

I love fried chicken. I have to stop myself from making this recipe. I suggest you brine the chicken first. Depending on how you do it, it adds flavor, and always makes it more tender and juicy.

Really good fried chicken that stays crispy.  I bumped up the spices per reviews advice and added a bit of hot sauce to the wet beer batter.  Next time I will take the skin off the chicken before breading to make sure the breading stays on better when biting into it.

Tonight was a two allrecipe recipe night! This recipe was easy to make. The chicken was so moist and juicy. The prep work was messy but the chicken was worth it! I have not been especially good at fried chicken, but this recipe made perfect chicken. I paired it with an easy homemade mac n cheese from allrecipe and southern cooking appeared.

Loved being able to taste the beer!   I've made it twice, and the second time I salted the raw chicken directly before the dipping,  and this was a mistake.  The breading didn't stay in tact when done, as it did the first time.  Also, a darker beer was more flavorful than a lighter beer.  And I added just a little extra beer which i think was a good idea.

There was nothing wrong with the flavor of this chicken, but there was simply way too much crust for my tastes.  It was crisp and crunchy, but there was more of the crust than chicken.  I ended up soaking the remaining uncooked chicken in buttermilk, dusting it in seasoned flour and baking it in the oven.

1st off, anyone who looks like Colonel Sanders own mother is someone to take seriously!! I marinated chicken in buttermilk, granulated garlic, Tony Chachere's Spice N' Herbs seasoning with a few drops of Crystal Hotsauce and let it soak for 6 hours. Also, instead of garlic salt, I substituted granulated garlic. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FRIED CHICKEN!!

So good! I added a bit of hot sauce just because my family love it a bit on the spicy side. I made 18 chicken legs for my family of 5 and it still wasn't enough. They have requested I make fried chicken every week!

I make fried chicken about once every 5 years so I was looking for something quick to make chicken for a road trip. This is perfect. I did use a dry rub mix in the seasoning flour instead of the individual ingredients (Native Texas dry rub mixed with Kansas City dry rub spices) and it was easy tasty and just what I was looking for.

Yes! Wonderful recipe! Added  1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper to make a little more tasty. To deep fry you need enough oil that lets chicken strips float as they get closer to done.

Great crispy chicken! Our house likes spice so I was heavy on the garlic salt, paprika, salt & pepper to kick up the spice but that was just personal preference. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

Best fried chicken we have found on this site! I cut 4 chicken breasts into strips and used the batter to make chicken tenders. Chicken was crispy, juicy, and not too spicy. This is now my go to recipe for chicken, the whole family loved it!

Absolutely Delicious!  I ate the entire chicken breast and I rarely do that.  I didn't change a thing except I used Water instead of Beer and I added some All Purpose Seasoning to the Chicken, before I dipped it.  Thank you!

Finally, fried chicken that gets & stays crispy after cooking off! 
I see alot of complaints about it being bland- the batter here has a decent flavor, it's your chicken itself that's bland. You need to brine your chicken for several hours first. Mix up a batch of brine (simply salt and water- try 1/4 cup or so salt dissolved in 2 -3 quartsof water depending on how much you need to cover the chicken) , soak your chicken pieces in it for about 1 1/2 -2 hours or so, drain, rinse and pat dry. If you want even more flavor, let sit in brine a bit longer next time.

This was a very simple to make recipe and delicious results. I used only Chicken Legs and made a lot of them (15 to be precise) and my wife and daughter enjoyed them. Very crispy outside and juicy inside, took about 15 minutes per batch to deep fry as I was using a Pot vs Deep Fryer. When it comes to taste, use your own judgement as everyone has there own taste for things, just don't over do things like salt is all.

I used Better batter gluten free flour and added celery salt and oregano to the seasonings in the flour mixtures. I also used boneless chicken breast. Finally! Gluten free crispy fried chicken! No one would know the difference.

This is a very good recipe which makes a terrific crust, but flavoring the actual chicken has been neglected. What you want to do is, the day before, rinse and cut up the chicken into pieces. I have a large stainless stockpot into which I pour about a gallon of water, and then dissolve 3/4 cup of salt and 2 tsp. of Accent (msg) into it. Add the chicken and allow to marinate for a full 22 hours. Then just follow the recipe here and you've got yourself some real Southern fried chicken!

This has become a house favorite!! I've doctored the spice blend some, stealing from some other recipes (KFC spice blend) and others to suit our tastes, but the method remains the same! I use it on breast cutlets for delicious chicken sammiches too!! Slathered in my homemade wing sauce is also outstanding!

It was ok. I liked the amount of crisps left on the chicken but nothing overly special about the taste if you follow the recipe exactly. I will use the triple batter technique but add lots of my own spice and flair to the batter

Best Fried Chicken. I have made a lot of different fried chicken over the years and this is by far the best.

It was okay, you must use a nonstick pot and the batter is so thick clean up is a biotch.  You need to really, really season your flour or else it won't have much flavor.  On the bright side it was very crunchy.

Another opportunity to air my lessons learned.  First, make sure your chicken pieces are not too big.  I used combined leg/thighs as that is what I had on hand.  Should have separated them first.  The bigger the piece, the longer it will take to deep fry and the more over-done coating will be.  Get the picture?  I eventually started taking pieces out earlier when I thought coating looked good, and finished in oven.  Guess you could alternatively pre-cook in microwave.  But having smaller pieces would have likely prevented having to do either.  I may try again, now that I have learned this lesson.  But thought the final coating was a little too crispy...think outer shell

Be prepared to get your fingers sticky, but I loved the outcome!  Took a bit longer to cook than I anticipated, but the hint of spice and so crispy outside made the wait worthwhile.  I will definitely make again - only made with thighs because that was all I had.  OH delicious cold as well.  Thanks!

Spicey? Far from it. The batter was definitely crispy, which I liked, but very bland. I amped up the spices as others suggested but still bland. I would be willing to try it once more but really add the spices.

I alway's follow the recipe exactly as given.  How else are you to give a valid rating?  Why people modify the first time makes no sense. 
On that note this recipe was just OK. The consensus of my wife and daughter was it was good but bland. I concur.
I am modifying  the seasoning and trying again, if successful, I will post a new recipe as mine.

This recipe was a disaster. I have no idea what went wrong but the batter was too thick on the first two pieces I made, so I added some more beer to thin it and then the batter cracked and separated from the chicken during cooking. When we went to eat it, it was extremely bland and all we could taste was flour so we ended up removing the battered coating and dipping the chicken in ranch sauce to give it some flavour. I would not recommend.

This chicken was crunchy and fairly easy to make.  I would suggest doctoring up the flour mixture with your favorite spices because it was bland.

I followed the recipe exactly, except adding more spices.  Way to much breading.  Not sure if I did something wrong but I will try this again with only the batter part.

I made this tonight for my boyfriend and I. It was very good, but I did add about a teaspoon of onion powder,  a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little added flavor and kick. Very delicious and crispy.

Absolutely delicious. I've tried many recipes with great reviews. I never like the way they turn out. The beer batter did it though. I used extra dark Guinness stout. To those complaining about flavor...season your chicken with salt and pepper. Always season meat before doing anything with it. I figure it's common sense which is why some recipes don't mention to do it. Seriously, always season your meat directly.

It was very good, just need to find an easier way to dip from bowl to bowl...maybe use bags....my hands were a mess, and it was hard to get them covered after awhile because of the mess.  But it was VERY good!

We tried to satisfy our kids' petition with this recipe.  Very easy-to-follow instructions, already accesible ingredients, and truly amazing results!  Our chicken looked like the ones in the video! Our kids couldn't believe it.  Sad part is there was no left overs.  ;)

I made this last evening for the third time (requested by my wife), and have never made a single change. I cut the recipe in half since it's just the two of us and it turns out great every time. 
Oops ... just realized I did substitute Canola oil for the vegetable oil.

It was meh. Only difference I did was I seasoned with adobo before dipping in flour because I knew they were going to be bland otherwise. The batter was too thick even after thinning out. It stuck so heavily to the drumsticks they looked huge afterwards. Not good unless you like to take a huge chunk of batter every time you take a bite of chicken. Seriously, there was more batter than chicken! The batter didn’t really have good flavor either. Husband didn’t like it and out of 4 kids, only one enjoyed it.

Awesome recipe! As a long time fan of fried chicken I've never achieved the level of crispy EVER until trying this recipe. Typically I  season my chicken directly rather than in the flour. I used a Cajun meat injector and injected each of the wings, I then season the wings with garlic and onion powder, parsley, cayenne pepper, black pepper and Cajun seasoning before dipping in the flour and wet batter mix. My wings turned out AMAZING! This now my go to recipe for frying EVERYTHING!!

Crispy is a understatement. I would recommend adding a lot more water/beer to batter making it about half the consistency as recipe calls for. I also added 1 TBL spoons of cayenne pepper to dry mixture for some kick. Had great flavor just a bit hard to bite into.

This recipe is wonderful! I did read the reviews so I  made a couple of changes. I marinated the chicken in buttermilk seasoned with 1t. Mrs dash, 1t. Garlic powder and 1 t. Season salt. I also added  1/2 t. Chili powder, 1/2 t. cayenne, 1/2 t. Garlic powder, 1/2 t. Salt and 1/2 t. Mrs dash to the 3 cups of flour along with the seasoning it called for. I used beer instead of water in the in the batter. Everything else was the same. Everyone loved it! Absolutely my new favorite fried chicken!

Turned out terrible.  Blackened outer layer and uncooked chicken on the inside.  Oil temp was slightly higher than what was stated but shouldn't have made that much of a difference.

way too much effort.  the first 'dip' causes the 2nd wet solution to become thicker and thicker and the third dry dip becomes clumpier and clumpier.  If you're only cooking one or 2 pieces, this is fine, and it tastes good, but if you're cooking a lot, you'll have to keep adjusting the mixtures throughout the process in order to get a consistent coating on all pieces.

Very crispy and delicious. It had a little too much breading. I will only double dip the chicken next time.  I used cayenne pepper and chili powder and a little more salt. Perfect amount of batter for 4 lbs of wings, drumsticks & thighs.

Excellent. Changed beer for buttermilk (didn't have beer, but I'm sure it would be good) and used for fried green tomatoes.. Best I've ever made. Going to try for chicken next time.

I thought the chicken was very good but it was too much breading for my liking. Also, I would've added even more seasoning. I will try this once more without the third dip.

Great for legs, thighs and wings, breasts needs to cook too long and get very hard and crunchy, cutting the breasts into 3 might help or finish cooking in oven,  definitely enjoyed my legs and wings.

I added loads more salt pepper paprika onion powder garlic powder and msg to the flour. I like it spicey. Bout a table spoon of each. 

That being said your method of cooking this chicken was spot on. I have tried and failed making fried chicken for over a decade until i tried your recipe. It came out exactly how i wanted it to. Crispy and moist. God bless you for sharing this.

OK - Wow! This was great.

The texture and crispiness of the finished product reminds me of the Hot and Spicy style KFC, without the heat. I followed the instructions  but personally, I would double all of the spices next time - and probably add even more salt. Oh and I added onion powder too, about 1/2TB. 

I used three joint chicken wings and just divided each joint, discarding the tips -so i had those half sized wing pieces,that's my favourite type of chicken to use when frying. 

I also did a buttermilk soak for about 20 mins before frying, so rather than wetting each piece with a bit of water before the 3 step dipping process, I just pulled mine straight out of the seasoned buttermilk and then hit the dry then wet then dry. 

I cannot recommend this recipe and process more highly! Thanks for this - I used cheap old 'blended vegetable oil' at $4 for 4 Litres and it worked a charm. I made about $60 worth of KFC in my own home for around $10 - you can't complain about that! Thank you so much for your recipe!

This chicken was delicious and crispy. I adjusted the seasonings a bit for my families taste and used more salt. I used pre-boiled chicken legs.

Really tasty. My advice would be don't be afraid of frying it until the batter is a dark shade of brown. First of all, you don't want the chicken to be under cooked. Second, if the batter isn't super crispy, it's kind of rubbery.

It was delicious! We used buttermilk instead of water for the initial wetting of the chicken. We Also used water instead of beer. It was so crispy and moist. My 3 year old loved it and he's fairly picky.

Holy fried chicken. This is so so so so so good. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne to the dry mix and fried two pieces at a time in the fryer at 355 degrees for about 12 minutes per batch. I'll add hot sauce to the wet mix next time. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL NEXT TIME!!

The guy I cook this for likes it really hot so I added 4 tbs of crushed red peppers, 2 tbs of hot chili powder, and 2 tbs of paprika to the dry mix. He also loves oregano so I put 4tbs of that in the dry mix and doesn't like garlic so I used celery salt instead. To the wet mix I added 2 1/2 tbs of crushed red pepper and oregano. 2 tbs of paprika and chili powder.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I use it to make chicken nuggets and my family cannot get enough of them.  It is messy and a little bit time-consuming, but totally worth it.

Too much flour for seasoning and spices to shine..
Double seasoning and spices. 1/2 the flour. instead of 3 cups. use 1 1/2

Besides needing a little more salt this recipe makes the best fried chicken! The crunch is unbelievable.!

I modified this recipe a little in that I didn't have any beer and I wanted something more flavorful than water so I used pancake mix for the batter and just added paprika, salt, and pepper. (It added an element of sweetness that was actually really nice). I also just had chicken breasts I needed to cook up so I sliced them into strips. This was so easy and by far some of the best , crispiest fried chicken I've ever had. I can't wait to try it with the beer batter next time.

This recipe is identical to one that was taught to me MANY years ago. Been cooking it this way a long time. The only modification I made to the batter recipe was to substitute 1/3 of the flour for the wet mix with Italian breading mix. Also, I slow cook my chicken breast (I don't use whole chickens) before I batter and deep fry.  It reduces the fry time, and it's super moist.... YUMMY!!!!

This is definitely the crunchiest fried chicken. As I didn't use a deep fryer I did shallow fry till golden on both sides then 10 minutes in a 180• oven for ten minutes. Still super crunchy. Hubby says. THE BEST

Followed recipe minus beer, but had to cut in half due to only using two chicken breasts. Chicken came out tender, crispy-crunchy, and juicy. Although I will add more salt next time, it did taste a little on the bland side. And, yes there will be a next time. My husband loved this recipe!

This is absolutely fantastic. We used the batter for chicken strips and it came out thin, crunchy, evenly coated, and the seasoning is delicious. I didn't bother measuring out spices. I just shook in the ones written, and used Lawry's for the poultry seasoning. I cut the recipe in half since I didn't need as much. This recipe is definitely going down as a family favorite! Definitely husband approved!

Winner winner chicken dinner! When I served this for dinner, all I got was silence. With intermittent and repeated... Oh my god.....  this is amazing..........I think this might be the best fried chicken I've ever eaten. All I changed was I upped all the spices and salts in the dry mix except the pepper, and added one Tablespoon of roasted garlic and red pepper seasoning  plus half a teaspoon of cayenne and msg free season all salt to the dry mix. Feeling pretty thankful for this amazing response after never cooking fried chicken before!

I also soaked the chicken a whole day before in 1 cup milk, 1 T white vinegar, half Tablespoon of poultry seasoning and salt.

All parts of the chicken were wonderful but the breast cut into tenderloins and cooked a shorter time was hands down the favourite.

Amazing! Absolutely the best fried chicken we have ever tasted! Talk about an amazing crust, this recipe sets the bar. The triple dip method really works and the thick beer dip was a killer, I will not be using any other fried chicken recipe from now on. If you don't like crispy thick chicken you could lighten the wet mix. Seasoning was awesome, just the right amount of everything, if the Colonel was still around I am sure he would approve. I am going to try this recipe in my actifry air fryer & see how it turns out.

The star was the batter not the chicken.  Much better out there to try first.
For those trying to duplicate KFC, sorry, it can't be done.  You need those restaurant style pressure cookers that are not available to the public.  It is not the recipe with KFC it is the cooking method that makes it special.

The reviews aren't kidding when they say this recipe is bland. The crispiness is fine, but it needs more salt. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added some celery salt and seasoned salt and it was much better.

You will definitely have to add seasoning - I strongly recommend adding your favorite seasoning immediately after pulling from the fryer. It's perfectly crunchy and otherwise awesome

Fabulous. After I fried these I dipped in equal parts of butter and hot sauce. I then threw in convection oven 300 for 10 min. Crispy Buffalo wings. Yummy.

I always have problems adequately seasoning my fried chicken. I add 1/2 container of every spice and it still turns out bland. So when I decided to use this recipe, since it used at least 2x the spices that I normally use for my dredge only chicken, I thought I was safe. However, even with the wonderfully extra crunchy crust, it was SO bland that no one in my family could eat the coveted skin/crust. Normally I adjust recipes as I see fit like others on this site...this time, I truly regret not doing something to make this recipe better. Not good.

it fired up nicely, but it is too bland. too much flour in the dredge; all the seasoning gets left behind in it.  also, 1 teaspoon of salt is never going to be enough for 8 pieces of chicken. especially when it's in the dredge where it gets left behind.

I would have given this a 5 star but because it lacks some salt it ended up a little bit bland. Next time I make it I will add more salt. Having said that, the chicken ended up very crispy and moist.

Horrible!  The batter formed a cocoon around the chicken and cooked, while the skin became rubbery and nasty just like boiled chicken. 

Try this recipe exactly at written and then omit steps 2 and 3 and you will have a much better dinner!  That's how grandma did it and she is always right!

better than KFC 's . followed recipe except for using 1 Tbsp of poultry seasoning (adds to flavor).  had a little trouble at 1st knowing when chicken was cooked, about 6 min per side did the trick.   DON'T ADD MORE SALT...chicken is perfect by itself, but if you want it saltier, go the healthier route and dip in homemade honey-mustard

I used some chicken I'd had marinating overnight, seasoned with some adobo and my homemade sofrito.  I also cooked it in my old oven at 400° for 30 minutes instead of the deep fryer. It was phenomenal and I would make it over and over again!

I did use extra spices as suggested and it came out great. Fantastic texture and flavor. I did brine the chicken beforehand.

This isn't what I was looking for. My first batch I cooked at 350 turned way too dark after about 10 minutes. I frantically got online to see how long chicken thighs should cook. 15 minutes was right but one person said that some batters brown too much and it's necessary to finish off cooking in the oven for 20 minutes, which is what I ended up doing after frying to a golden brown after about 8 minutes. The crust itself was way to hard. And yes my oil was 350...i used a thermometer. And I didn't care for the poultry seasoning either. So... a lot of work and poor results. I'm really disappointed but will keep looking.

Great tasting recipe although I found the triple dip was too much breading on the chicken, also I advise doubling the suggested amount of cayenne and Cajun seasoning if you wanted your breading to have a little heat, and please soak your chicken in buttermilk salt and pepper overnight so your chicken stays moist and tender.

Delish! Lots of work for 4 teenage boys to devour in 10 minutes! But very easy to follow and so good. Only diff was I used cayenne instead on paprika and went a little heavy on the other seasonings.

It's really good, but the first step needs to be split into two. I messed it up and put water into what should have been the dry bowl. I was just skimming the list of ingredients like I always do (which always works fine except this time).

Somehow I managed to salvage it but it was a pain.

Needs a bit more spice and the breading can be quite thick.  If you don't have temperature control (like a pot of oil on the stove), keep the temperature low as though frying; too hot and the outside will burn long before the inside is fully cooked.

12-15 minutes for drumsticks
15-20 minutes for thighs

We liked this chicken. It was crispy, but it was not moist. I felt like it needed a dipping sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  My family raved about its crispiness.  The only change I made was I substituted House Autry chicken breader that I had left over instead of using the flour and spices.  The rest of the recipe I made verbatim.  I plan on making this again, but trying it with the flour and spices instead of a ready-made breader.  This is a "keeper" in my recipe box!

Very good crunchy fried chicken. Basically used my own mix of spices and pan fried in skillet with 1\2 inch shortening so I could make pan gravy. Husband loved it.

I didn't care for this recipe. Not because the crust wasn't good but the skin didn't cook and none of the flavor soaked through to the chicken. As soon as I bit into it the crust outside broke off, the skin was underneath and was not crispy but mushy and the chicken was flavorless. I might try this with boneless breast strips or something but not bone in, skin on ever again. No one in my family ate it.

We weren't really crazy about this recipe. Actually, the recipe was okay as far as flavor and preparation goes, and I suppose it turned out just the way it was supposed to (a LOT of breading!). It tasted pretty good the first night, but left overs to the next day, not so much. The crispness lost its crunch, leaving the breading soggy and soft. And, although the first night was the best, the crunchy coating fell off the meat too easily. Maybe I breaded it TOO much.

This recipe was absolutely outstanding I thought that the breading was going to be too thick I was going to be hard at the breading was just right flavorful and the only thing different that I did I brined my chicken and 2 quarts of water with 2 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Again I must say absolutely outstanding

After experimenting with this recipe we have deemed it our family favourite. It is better than KFC! I changed the recipe somewhat in that I cut the flour down by 1 1/2 cups and I added 1 tsp. of cumin and I didn't use beer. My son declared that he never wanted to eat KFC again because this was the only fried chicken he liked. We have now made it several times.

I did enjoy this recipe however I was afraid to use all the salt called for since I don't use a lot of  it normally. Next time I'll use all the salt called for plus add the cayenne pepper and Cajun seasoning for a little more zip.

This was a very good crispy batter.  It had good flavor but it was not spicy.  I had been looking for a spicy fried chicken recipe and this came up.  The comment at the top of the page said this was the spiciest and crispiest fried chicken recipe.  While it was very crispy it was not spicy.  to make it spicy I recommend adding red pepper or whatever hot pepper you like to boost the spice level.

Per previous reviews, I did a salt water brine beforehand. I also substituted salt for seasoned salt and added 1 tablespoon of celery salt to the batter. Everything was fantastic and I will definitely make it again! Next time though, I will add cayenne pepper for some heat and may have two Dutch ovens going to cut down on my frying time.

Loved it. Doubled the spices as we like spic in our food. The chicken was  moist and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Everyone liked it better than my  chicken tenders.  It is how I will fry chicken and chicken tenders from now on.   (I added a pinch of ginger).

I like how the triple dip gives the chicken a wonder crispy coating. I used it with chicken wings which was very good.  I would suggest adding more seasoning since the batter is very thick. I doubled the seasoning and marinated my in some mild hot sauce & lemon . They turned out great. Definitely worth making again. Hubby keep commenting on how good & crispy the coating was.

This will be short and sweet.  The chicken came out crispy and moist inside.  I rated this 4 stars because of the amount of effort and the degree of mess making this chicken recipe caused.  I doubt I will be making it again for that reason...it is also hard to have sides hot and ready to go at the same time.   Plan your side dishes wisely.  Your hands will be full with the triple dipping and frying of so much chicken.  You will not have time to pay much attention to sides so pick things that don't take prep time just before serving.

This was my first ever attempt at home made fried chicken. We really enjoyed it! I think i'll thin the batter a bit more &  add more spices. All in all it was delicious.

I already made  it many times, my favorite coating for my chicken wings but mde a little bit of twist.  Marinate my chicken wings overnight with salt and pepper to have a taste. I havent try using beer, i use water instead and still turn out very good. Add a little bit of cayenne pepper on the dry coating.

We thought it was excellent.  I added garlic powder, hot sauce, and red pepper to the wet ingredients.  Not a lot, just enough to let you know it's there.  I marinaded my chicken in my own marinade for fried chicken for 24 hours so the chicken had lots of flavor.  Chicken was moist and crispy,,,oh,  and delicious. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made no changes to the recipe and it was awesome.   I agree with other reviewers; it could probably use a little more seasoning.   I'd probably go with a little more garlic and salt and pepper.   It was a hit at our recent Sunday family dinner.   Yeah, it's messy frying that much chicken, but it's worth it.

This turned out so good!  The only thing I did different was to let the coating dry for 15 minutes or so before placing the pieces in the fryer.
I fixed three chickens for a dinner I was hosting and there was nothing left!
I'll make this again and soon!

It was our first try making fried chicken with the turkey fryer.  The chicken was good; however, we would skip the double dipping of the flour coating.  It was too thick and fell off the chicken when you but into it.

I made the following changes: I used adobo instead of poultry season and I pre breaded and let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple hours. I recommend using a thermometer for oil and checking the chicken.

So I had fun making this, and I think I will do it again! One big change I did was I used one whole egg and not just the egg yolk I believe it is a big waste to not use the white. Also the beer I used was Hoegaarden! Delish!!! One problem I did have was the first batch came out very dark because the oil was just too hot. The second batch came out beautifully golden and much crispier.

I'm a simple man of simple tastes, so when my great aunt Gretchen suggested I partake in the culinary experience that is triple dipped chicken I was a little taken aback by her audacity.  As I scanned through the recipe outlined by the amateur  QUIRKYIQ my doubt for this dish only deepened.  The crass, almost insulting, way this excuse for a gourmet artisan hamfistedly drowned such pitiful amounts of garlic salt in an overwhelming sea of paprika called to mind an image of the great Michel Richard rolling over in his grave.  However, I respect nothing more than the culinary insight of my beloved Gretchen, so I threw caution to the wind and through gritted teeth prepared a dish of the so called "Triple Dipped Fried Chicken" for myself and my sweet ferret, Annabel.

It was pretty good, will make again.

a really good and simple way to make fried chicken. Anyone can add their own twist to this. I found that the basic set up of making the batter was the most important thing. Only fried chicken I have made that didn't fall apart. My kids enjoyed this and so did my husband.

I made this chicken & it was absolutely delicious! The only poultry seasoning I had was an A-1 steak & poultry rub. I added some of that to the flour & I added season salt & I added more garlic salt than what is posted here. I basically seasoned to taste. I would dip my finger in the flour mixture & taste to see if it had the desired flavor. I also used water instead of beer. I have always seen chicken dipped in a flour mixture & in the eggs, but I've never seen the eggs mixed with flour, pepper, etc. It made the coat thicker & really gave the chicken a good crust. I will definitely make my fried chicken like this from now on! Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe! =D

I never made good fried chicken until I tried this recipe. I used skinless breasts and they came out so deliciously crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Forget KFC; this chicken is the BOMB.

This was tasty but, for me, not worth the effort and the smell of grease that took days and days to get rid of.  Yes, fan was on and windows open.  Will probably not make again.

Loved it!  After reading some of the reviews, I took someone's advice and added 2 Tbsp All Spice  and a bit of celery salt (I didn't measure it, just shook it a few times).  I also used water instead of beer.  I made chicken strips and they were nice and crunchy and so yummy!  I will make this again, for sure :)

Easy to make. I did add a couple shakes of franks hot sauce to the wet mix to spice it up a little. Tasted very good. Would definite make it again.

very good! I added 1tsp of Tony Chachare's Creole seasoning to add a little heat, and it was perfect! Definitely the crispiest I've ever been able to make my chicken, so...thank you!

I added a lot of Old Bay   I also triple dipped half and double dipped the other half .   Both ways delicious.  Would probably double dip just to save time

This was really good, but needed more salt and the batter can be a little too thick (which may be partially my fault as I had to mix more wet batter as I went).  It was better hot, but the thick coating was a little doughy with the cold chicken. I soaked the chicken in buttermilk with salt before, but it still could have used more salt in the actual batter. Overall one of the better fried chicken recipes on here though!

Followed the recipe and took advice of others to add additional salt to the dry mix as well as some seasoned salt.  It received so many compliments this will be used again and again.

Presentation and texture are perfect. But the amount of seasoning suggested makes it extremely  bland. I would add a tablespoon of salt the both dips (dry and wet). I would note, though, i did not use the chicken seasoning. So perhaps that would have added the saltiness needed. Other than that, this is the most successful friend chicken recipe i have ever used. It looks like  i got a recipe straight from the colonel himself.

Our go-to fried chicken recipe.  Deep fry in a cast iron Dutch oven and you're gonna love how crispy this chicken gets.   Just watch the oil temp and you're good to go!

I made this recipe at a cooking demo that I did today at the Lodge Factory Store in Commerce, GA. It was stellar!!! I in the wet mix, I used 1 Tbsp of salt instead of 1 tsp. Also in the wet mix I used beer - Yuengling Lager. It was absolutely perfect! I was making this chicken to be a part of another recipe, but the chicken on its own was amazing. One note - after dredging in the dry mixture for the second time, allow the chicken to rest before cooking until the dry mix forms a paste-like consistency. This creates crispier chicken with no residual flour in your oil. Very, very good recipe! I cannot recommend it enough!

Great recipe! Just as everyone else says...the coating stays on, and they stay crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside  Just add more spices to the mixes.  Made mine with water because I didn't have beer, but it tasted great nonetheless. I also used chicken tenders.  Wish I had taken pictures because they looked like they were prepared by a professional!  Nomnomnom!!!

My family loved it so much. I had to modify some ingrediantes to suit my family  food intolerance.  I used gluten free flour, and soda water.  I omited the egg, as my son has allergy. The result was amazing . The chicken peices were crispy from the outside and moist from the inside. Thanks so much for sharing.

Ultra crispy! Mine didn't store well though and became soggy the next day. I probably didn't drain enough grease out... Otherwise, this is a great recipe!

Wanted something different so tried this recipe.  I added more seasoning after reading other reviews.  The breading was very hard like eating rocks. The prep was very messy.  The breading browned very quickly at 350 degrees so I had to finish cooking in the oven.  Family did not like the breading either.  To much time spent on getting chicken done.  Will not make this recipe agin.

I loved this recipe. It had the crunch I've been looking for. The only change I made was to add more of the poultry seasoning. I used the Montreal seasoning. Great recipe.

This is my fifth or sixth time making fried chicken (experimenting with different recipes each time) and I was mind blown when the batter actually stuck to the chicken in stead of sliding off everywhere. Now I know the secret: triple dip. Seriously this is better than any other recipe

Lovely batter - moist chicken.  Definitely needs more salt and pepper.  A little more work than regular fried chicken but it definitely worth it.  Will make this one again.

Amazing, it really is crispy. After reading the comments I doubled the amount of spices and tripled the amount of salt, but it was still a bit bland, so I will use more salt next time!

This is now my family's favorite fried chicken recipe. I used beer and the second dip mix was nice and creamy. I followed the recipe exactly and we thought it was perfect.

This recipe is great,  chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy.  My personal opinion... I think it's needs more salt and other spices to give it more flavor. Other than that, everyone loved it!  Definitely a keeper, thank you for the recipe :)

This is the best battered fried chicken recipe
Ever! It was so easy and delicious. I make my husband rate every new recipe and he rated it a 10. I made 10 wings. I cut the flour mixture in half and added more seasoning. I had batter and flour left over so I made onion rings for tomorrow.

Followed the recipe and it just was not good. I think there was way too much garlic which is odd because I put garlic in almost everything and it was not as crispy as I would have liked.

We don't have a deep fryer. So I prepped the chicken following these instructions, then put them in a glass baking dish filled with 1/8" of oil. Cooked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, rotated them and then cooked for another 30 minutes. Turned out crispy and delicious!

By far the best coating I have ever tried.  I tweaked the spices, but as far as coating and crunchiness this is the best.

Loved it! My kids don't like bones in their chicken (LOL) so I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into thirds. It was like chicken tenders but because its a thigh it stayed moist. Only had to fry it for 5 minutes because of smaller size and no bone. Totally awesome!

This was a 5 star recipe with some changes. I used garlic powder not salt and added about 2 tbsp. seasoning salt and 1 tbsp. onion powder. Only used 2 cups of flour vs. 3. in the batter I used about a tbsp. Dijon and a whole can of beer. probably slightly less flour, too. Yum!!

Not really any changes...I followed the recipe but I didn't have any measuring devices so I just kinda winged that. It turned out very crispy but needed more salt which could have been my fault. I did use coors light beer instead of water..me and my son, Taylor, loved it! I will definitely cook it again just adding more salt. Shout out to my wife Shannon! Love ya!

Best fried chicken I have ever made! Hubby had been asking for restaurant style breaded chicken so I found this.  Unbelievable.  Tastes  just like a country restaurant. Of course I used the same principle with a chicken breast, cut it in cubes and fried it up like that. I'll never use another recipe.

Made this tonight. It was very good. Nice and crispy. Just thought the coating was a little to thick (maybe that's because of the triple dipping?!?) and the chicken needed salt. Next time will salt and pepper the raw chicken before starting the dipping process and will thin out the batter even more. Instead of wetting the chicken with a little water before dipping, just sprinkled a few drops of beer on each piece. Thought this added a little more flavor directly to the chicken. Overall, it was delicious!

Awesome recipe!!! I used chicken tenders and spiced the dry and wet mix up a little with some seasoned salt and Everglades heat. Came out amazing. I've never used a wet batter before and it was easy as could be. Not much better use for some  light beer anyway.

This was really good! I have been making cakes all day, and was running low on flour, so I substituted a cup of Bisquick in the breading, 1/3 cup in the the batter, and I added about a tablespoon of ground cayenne pepper to the flour mixture for an extra kick. Before I found this recipe I had already brined my chicken pieces in a mixture of kosher salt, garlic powder and onion powder for 48 hours. The breading put my usual chicken over the top! Well done and thanks for sharing. :)

This is the most amazing recipe for fried chicken! Well, actually, I use the recipe to make chicken tenders. I followed the recipe pretty much as written. The chicken is light and crispy without being greasy. I also used this recipe for onion rings. Equally amazing! The only thing I really changed was to use Maple Farms Sugar Free Pancake Mix instead of flour (I am on a low carb diet.) Wow! Fried chicken on a low carb diet! Thanks so much for this recipe. It is restaurant quality!

This chicken came out so great. I used Newcastle beer for the marinade and upped the salt for more flavor. Very delicious.

No one in my family would eat it. The batter is very crispy, but does NOT have a good flavor.

Hands down the best fried chicken recipe I've ever had. I use cajun seasoning in place of paprika but it is amazing. Light and crisp and sticks to the meat. I've also used it on chicken fried steak with equally amazing results. A lifetime go to for our household. My children (5, 3.5, 2, and 3 months) don't really care for most meat. My older 3 devour every last bite and ask for more every time I make this recipe (the baby will as well I'm sure, once he has some teeth). Absolutely delicious!

This recipe was extremely easy and very tasty! I pretty much followed the recipe to the "T" except for seasoning my flour with Adobo Orange in place of my all purpose seasoning, my chicken thighs came out to be a beautiful golden brown that I made my last two pieces without skin & the final thigh I deboned & de skinned just to try & get the same effect. All variations had the same crispness and great flavor, you can virtually season yours however your heart desires I feel & will still make a slam dunk with this recipe! I wouldn't change anything aside from me doubling up on the spices as others suggested.

Have to strongly disagree with "most crispy chicken ever". Just flour makes a crisper chicken. This recipe is good dont get me wrong but the batter does not add to crispyness, actually makes it a bit less crispy compared to just using flour. Also agree with lots of other comments that its a bit bland and need to add more seasoning.

I tried this recipe for supper and it was great!  
I did add just a "sprinkle" of cayenne pepper and used Leinenkugel Oktoberfest beer instead of water.  I used just chicken breast and it was perfect.  
It would have gotten 5 stars but the timing is alittle off.  I used a deep fryer to cook it with and had it set at 350 and it did not take 15 minutes to cook, more around 10-12 minutes.

This didn't turn out for me.  We ended up peeling off the battered coating, and I got a lot of ribbing over how it didn't work out.

I loved the way my chicken came out! I have never been able to make fried chicken without the batter falling off or apart. I gave this review 4 stars because you have to add more seasoning than is stated or else the batter will be bland. I followed the advice of many others who left reviews and added extra seasonings. I used Coors Light for the beer. yumm!

De-lish!!! My favorite part of fried chicken is the crunchy coating, this is perfect!!! I would include a photo, because it came out beautifully, but this chicken was gone so fast, there wasn't time for a photo! The only pictures I could include would be my friends and husband in a food coma. Fat and happy after this chicken dinner!! My only change was a bit more seasoning. More paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger, ( even a bit of soy sauce in the wet mixture) we never measure anything, so season to taste, after a bit more flavor, perfection. ;)

Best recipe for fried chicken that I've ever attempted.  I did everything except that I seasoned the chicken with the suggested seasonings, covered in mustard, then marinated overnight.  Superb!

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight and LOVED it! It holds the juicyness of the chicken and has a beautiful taste smell texture. It's as good as it gets with out crossing the rail road tracks! My one suggestion is to not do it in a Fry Daddy. It stuck to the basket. I should have known that, I was just craving Fried Chicken.

I really enjoyed this easy recipe, I used chicken breast and sliced them into inch wide strips, followed the recipe, and I had to reduce the cooking time to 9-10 minutes per batch. I added some Cayenne pepper for a slight kick. It was delicious and everyone in my family enjoyed it!

This recipe was okay..... I guess it really depends on your taste buds.  It was a little bland so I had to add additional seasoning while eating. I will continue to search for the best fried chicken recipe.

It was NOT the promised ultra crispy chicken I anticipated. I also agree with other raters that it needed some extra umph, such as more salt. I do not like to deep fry food at the best of times, but if the special taste is worth it, then it is ok on occasion. However, this did not make the mark at all. I have seen ultra crispy chicken in supermarkets, so will go that route if I want crispy fried chicken again.

Made this for dinner tonight and loved loved loved the appearance but had to cook a lot longer. Maybe pieces were too big. Kicked it up a notch with Tonys in the dry mix and hot sauce in the wet, very tasty!

I have not had much success with fried chicken. I found my fry daddy...so I thought I would give this a whirl. We did not have beer...so I used 1/4c tequila in 1 1/4 c water....Crispy? YES Juicy? YES ...other reiewiers are correct...bland! ...I will keep this recipe and play with the seasonings until I get it just right for our tastes. If you don't mind a little trial and error...its a keeper! :)

I found it pretty bland the first time around.

The second time around I doubled and tripled on all spices.  For starters, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, montreal chicken seasoning instead of poultry seasoning, and I added celery salt. 

Came out absolutely incredible!! Cannot wait to make it again!

Considering everything that goes into this I expected the chicken to have more flavor than it did. Despite that, it was everything you'd hope for in fried chicken. I'll just be making a few adjustments the next time I use this recipe.

I applied more heat which made the flavor pretty good but it's just way too thick for us.

This is the CRISPIEST chicken I ever made!!!!!! I have tried many recipes and this is the best! I did find it lacked a teeny bit of flavor, that is something will have to tweak. I give it ten stars on crunch and technique alone. The boneless breast I used remained moist too. My new go to recipie for fried chicken, bone in or boneless THANK YOU :)

This was good chicken but lacking in the spice department. It needed a little something more. The triple dip idea was easy enough. I really think it was lacking salt which is a prerequisite for chicken. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good chicken. I made this for my husbands birthday and he really liked it. I used chicken boobs with back attatched. I used beer instead of water. It was very crispy, and looked like KFC chicken. It did not, however, taste quite as good. I think it needs more flavor. I heard of using dry italian dressing mix, so I will give that a shot next time. Or maybe just more spices. Possibly more paprika, salt and pepper, oregano, poultry seasoning, garlic and onion powder....

Entertained some friends from North Carolina who were feeling homesick and missing fried chicken. This recipe is the best fried chicken any of us had ever tasted. I made it exactly as written, but added some cayene pepper.

Very good.  It fries up cripsy.  Not too messy.  My only complaint is that it is very bland.  I will certainly use this receipe again, but will add more spices.

This was definitely crispy. I think next time I'll use more spices. I also think I'll try boneless chicken next time, that would make it pretty close to perfect!

Very good batter, need to add water to it because it thickens quickly. Good cold and the next day as well. Only problem was the seasoning was not strong enough.  Will cook it again but add more  seasoning to the batter.

This was a decent basic recipe in need of some tweaking. I skipped the last dip into the flour, I just didn't feel like dealing with the mess. I used tenderloins and soaked them in buttermilk for about 30 minutes to get them juicy and tender. Three cups of flour seemed like such a waste, so only about 1 1/2 cups of seasoned flour were used. This batter is definitely crispy and I had no trouble getting it to stick to the chicken. Even after adding more spices, it seemed like something was missing. These would be great with some buffalo ranch dressing or honey mustard.

This was ok. While I was impressed with the batter, the chicken itself didn't taste very good. My husband said it was boring and my 6 yo ate only half of one drumstick. I might try the batter with chopped steaks, but probably won't use with chicken again. Thanks anyway.
