I made this for Christmas dinner and it received rave reviews.  People thought it was pumpkin pie. I did substitute the almonds with pecans and I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup (brown). Delicious.

After researching different ways to get the squash out to mash it (still not sure I did it the right way) but it was FABULOUS...my family hates squash...or so they thought.  They now love it!  It's almost like eating dessert.

I used kabocha squash, added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg, subbed brown sugar for all the sugar called for and used pecans instead of almonds.

Excellent recipe!  Followed recipe as is.   The only change I made was to double the toppings for a somewhat complete coverage on top for a crust.   Lots of compliments at the Thanksgiving potluck meal from family.

Awesome Awesome dish! This was so yummy! It was very sweet- so next time I might consider adding a bit less sugar, but I have a sweet tooth so I highly doubt it! I used frozen winter squash, cooked it, and threw it all together. Can't wait to make it again for more people.

I used a food processor to mash up the squash and baked it before doing so. i only added a few table spoons of brown sugar. i added Cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and a cap of vanilla. i only sprinkled cinnamon and a tiny bit of brown sugar on top. also i only used 3 tablespoons of butter. way healthier version. VERY GOOD.

This is a high-fat, high-calorie dish, but it tastes SOOOO wonderful.  I had to substitute pecans for almonds since that was what I had on hand and my butter was a bit too soft so I had to plop, not crumble on the topping.  Cook time in my oven was also closer to 60 minutes, but this recipe was well worth it.

This was tasty, but a little too sweet for me. I did appreciate the crunch of the almonds and the nice squash flavor. Many winter squash casseroles cover up the flavor of the squash. Since I LOVE squash, I was pleased that the flavor came through so well. The topping was very nice. Next time, however, I will reduce the amount of sugar in the mix.

This was excellent! I made squash for Thanksgiving and it wasn't as deep orange as I would have liked it so I looked for recipe that I could use the squash puree in and found this one. EVERYONE loved it!! It was delightful! I didn't have almond so I used pecan instead and it was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. In fact, I'm making it again for Christmas dinner! This is definitely a sweet way to get everyone to eat a little squash, even the fussy ones!

This recipe was delicious!  I did substitute, but it still turned out excellent.  Here is what I did:  I used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar, I halved the amount of butter, then used half of that in butter and the other half as coconut oil.  I used coconut flour instead of flour, and doubled the topping.  This was absolutely delicious!  Coconut sugar is not as sweet as regular sugar, so it was not too sweet at all.

This recipe is so yummy!  I love squash and I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it.  The combination of flavors reminded me of carmel popcorn.  Very sweet, but an excellent side to any main dish.

Tasted a little too eggy and was overly sweet.  The egg/sugar flavors masked the natural flavor of the butternut squash I used.  I probably would not make this recipe again.

We really liked this casserole even without the topping, which I didn't put on because of the extra calories, and I didn't want it to seem like a dessert.
You could taste the eggs in it, but I thought that was really delicious.  Will definitely make again.  To cook the squash, I microwaved large about 8x8 inch unpeeled pieces for 12 minutes and then scraped the cooked squash off the peel.  Worked quite well.  Update:  Made again for company, and they wanted the recipe.  Really liked the dish.  One of my favorites now.

Delicious! Perhaps not the healthiest way to eat one's vegetables, but I will definately make this again.  My two-year-old kept asking for more "pie". I just used frozen winter squash to make this.

I very much enjoyed this caserole.  It's a great way to make squash more interesting.  I personally cut back on the sugar, since I'm not that much of a sugar fan.

Very good! I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and it was still really sweet. I might decrease it even more next time, unless I am serving it as a dessert.

A few years ago, my assignment for Thanksgiving dinner at my sister-in-law's was just " Bring the squash". Ok. So I came across this recipe, it was a huge hit and I've been making it ever since. I didn't change a thing, except to increase the servings to about 20!

Great recipe for winter squash.  I followed the other reviews advice and cut back the sugar as well. Could have cut it back more.  Definitely will do this recipe at Thanksgiving.
