I really enjoyed these bars. In previous reviews there are complaints that they are too dry. I substituted the white sugare for 1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar. White sugar tends to give foods a crispier sandier finish. My bars turned out great!

I really enjoyed this recipe- especially the fact that it had no added fat and was nice and light- a good balance to the density of the gumdrops. I found the bars dried out very fast and they were a little on the sweet side. You might try replacing one of the eggs and some of the sugar with some applesauce for a moister more flavorfully sweet bar. But overall this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made the first batch exactly following the recipe and the bars turned out rather dry although I liked the flavor. The second batch was identical except that I substituted half of the sugar with an equal quantity of unsweetened apple sauce as per the suggestion from LMCBSOP. Now they're perfect. I agree; this one's a keeper.

I followed the recipe to the letter as I always try to do the first time. I took them out of the oven at 25 minutes and they tested done. I agree they are a bit dry but what I liked even less is the "eggy" flavor and the texture. If I were to make this again I definitely would cut back on the eggs my gut was telling me that 4 was too many and I should have followed my instinct. Also I didn't want to add additional calories or fat to the bars but I think a glaze would help presentation. The bars will be eaten but overall this just didn't work too well for our tastes and I doubt I'll make again.

The bars were dry and the flavor did not compliment the gum drops.

People are commenting they found these to be dry. I found them very much like a biscotti. They were a hit!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it was dry I thought it tasted some what like a sugar cookie with gum drops in it...did not care for it at all. My kids did not even eat it.
