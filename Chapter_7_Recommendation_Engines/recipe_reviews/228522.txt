It turned super thick for us super quick.  I over cooked mine so I thinned it out with a sweet vermouth.  Everyone loved this jam!

This is the best fig preserves I have every made.  The preserves have the flavor of the Jell-o, I made strawberry, blackberry, and raspberry. I only used 2 cups of sugar and be sure not to use sugar free Jell-O.
