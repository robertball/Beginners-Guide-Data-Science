I love these things. I just read the reviews and had to respond to a few things. You don't/can't activate nutritional yeast, it's just not that kind of yeast. You can make your own gluten easily, though slowly, by mixing half all purpose white flour, and half wheat flour into a stiff ball (for 2 cups gluten, use 4 cups flour total) nthen cover with cold water and let rest an hour. then knead until REALLY cloudy, change water let rest, etc. until kneading leaves almost clear water. tada, gluten!

This is a good recipe ingredient wise, but the instructions make it more complicated than necessary. Try this instead - mix all ingredients in a large bowl, except the wheat gluten, till smooth. Then add gluten to the bowl and mix with a spoon till most of the gluten is moist. Then you can knead for a minute or two. Now your ready to break into chunks, shape and bake. I also found the bake time to be a bit long- try 10 minutes less.

Awesome! served this to a bunch of carnivores, vegetarians and vegans alike (check your  bbq sauce carefully, could have fish in it). This is AWESOME -- these are not supposed to rise, the nutritional yeast gives flavor, and is not a leavening agent. You can get Gluten at a Health food store usually called "Wheat Gluten" or "Vital Wheat Gluten". It sometimes comes in bulk sections, or in specialty flour sections (even in our 'natural food section' of our regular grocery).

These were very tasty.  I notice that the recipe has been edited since the last time I made these, the water being reduced to 2 cups. I added onion powder to the dry mix and used Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of salt. Heated peanut butter in microwave so it would spread easier.  Reduced the oil to 1/3 cup & realized I'd cut the onions too chunky -  pureed them in the blender after they cooked.  The dough mixed up much nicer and looked and tasted like something I'd serve to company. Baked on parchment paper.

I haven't eaten meat in eleven years, and ribs are the only thing I miss.  I happen to be very forgiving of any vegetarian "meat" substitutes; because it's been so long, I can hardly tell anymore that veggie burgers don't taste exactly like the real thing.  So I had high hopes for these, especially given all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, they're not to my liking.  I wish I had something to compare them to, but the texture isn't like anything I've ever had before or ever care to try again.  Despite the attempts of the paprika and onion to add flavor, these taste like some kind of bland, chewy blob soaked in barbeque sauce.  Which makes me like barbeque sauce less, since it's meant to enhance flavor, not BE the only flavor.  I had some amazing vegetarian ribs at B. Smith's when I was visiting a friend in DC, but unfortunately I live in Milwaukee... and they were $19.  So I will continue searching for a recipe that calls for carmelized sweet potatoes, in the hope that it will be closer, since that's what those were made of.  If you're going to try these, I suggest cutting the recipe in half the first time, since it is a huge waste of a lot of expensive ingredients if it turns out you don't like them.

Great flavor!  I followed this recipe to a "T", but I did have some issues with my gluten dough.  I think the water really should be cut down to 2 cups, instead of 3 cups.  My dough was very wet and never once resembled the "ball" the recipe talks about.  I had to drain a LOT of water, and I felt like all my paprika was being washed down the drain!  When I went to make the "ribs" there was no pulling or twisting going on with the dough...it was more like slopping it into the pan and hoping that it would dry out in the oven!  I would also cut the amount of BBQ sauce to 1 or 1 1/2 cups...2 cups was way too much.  Other than too-wet dough, the flavor was really quite delicious, and the texture would be better if I used less liquid.  I will definitely give this one another try!  Good luck....stick with it, even if it seems like all hope is lost.  They are very tasy.

Just made my first batch. As others have suggested the recipe needs tweeking to make it simpler. 1. Saute onions in 1/4 c oil. 2. Add all spices, seasonings and PB to cooked onions. 3. I also added 1 T liquid smoke and 3 T Braggs. 4. Add 1 1/2 c. water( you could use a broth here) to onion mix. 5. Now add the Vital Gluten and mix just to moisten all ingredients.  Knead if you like. 6. Ready to break off chunks and bake.  And YES, reduce the baking time by at least 10 minutes.

My children absolutely loved these even though they looked nothing like they were supposed to.  I think a few more details in the recipe would have made this easier e.g. the recipe probably should have specified "warm" water to help activate the yeast. My "ribs" came out flat like hamburgers.

I have made these several times now and passed the recipe site on to many people. I followed the recipe except to cut the water to only 2 cups, the salt to 1/2 T. and the oil to 1/3 cup or less. I used crunchy peanut butter last time because I was out of smooth. I took them to a large church potluck and they were a big hit. My kids love them also. I still haven't made them with barbecue sauce. I just served them as they come out of the oven, cool over night in the refrigerator. I hope to try them barbecued for 4th of July!!! Thanks for a great recipe.

I love these!  When I take them to potlucks, I will call them BBQ Breadsticks to refrain from scaring the carnivours.  The flavor is awesome, and the texture is way better than what I expected!  Thanks for a winner!

I have tried multiple different versions of seitan and this one is by far the best.  Like another reviewer suggested, I just dump everything together and stir and it still turns out amazing every time.  Thank you so much for a deliciously quick and easy way for vegetarians to enjoy that bbq!

I found this dish to be a whole lot of work for a mediocre result. My whole family thought it just tasted like odd bread with bbq sauce. Ordinarily I wouldn't post a negative response, but I made this based upon all the stellar reviews, so I just think it's only fair readers see another opinion. It was edible but by no means meatlike.

I have been looking at this recipe for a very loooooong time and I FINALLY tried it and I must say that I regret the precious years that I have wasted NOT trying this. 

These are DELICIOUS!

I was hesitant to try this as I have yet to find one gluten recipe that I liked as they all tasted like strange dough to me. This did not. Not sure what the one star reviewers are saying. Maybe they are doing it wrong. I dumped everything in the bowl, like one reviewer suggested and it was quick and easy. Chango! Presto! 

It was even delicious before I put the BBQ sauce and I will use this as an overall base for meat substitutes in my recipes. Chopped up in eggs, lo mein...ah the possibilities are endless.

Even my finicky son and carnivore husband loved this. Try it!

I love seitan, it's so versatile!  I've made a lot of it and this recipe is wonderful, albeit more complicated than it really needs to be.  I made it as I usually make it (dry ingredients mixed in one bowl, wet in another, then mix together and knead until it starts to act a bit rubbery, a couple minutes tops).  I also didn't feel like fooling with cooking an onion and waiting on oil to cool so I used onion powder.  I added 2 tsp of Liquid Smoke and 3 tblsp of Bragg's Liquid Aminos to the wet ingredients.  They're fabulous!  I'm eating one on a sandwich right now and will definitely be making them again soon!

The amount of water has been corrected to read "2 cups". You may need to use more water depending on the consistency of the gluten.

We love these things.  I melt the peanut butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make it spread easier and we eat them with wing sauce(anchovy free) and they're delicious!

Okay. I enjoyed the meaty texture and drizzled it with Sweet Baby Ray's spicy bbq sauce. Take care not to overbake. I prefer a mostly similar "ribs" recipe I found on fatfreevegan.com.

Wow! This was great! One of the things I missed when going vegetarian was ribs and this is a great alternative. My only problem was spreading the peanut butter on the mixture- it didn't seem to want to stick at all until the onions and oil were added. This recipe impressed my skeptical friends, too!

I brought this recipe to a potluck and it was a hit!  People were surprised how rich and substantial they are.  My only complaint is all the strange steps but I think now that I've made this once, next time it would be even better.  I will also try to create a "bone" for each "rib" using pieces of sugar cane.

I really was hopeful about these after reading the reviews, but I just couldn't eat them. My parents thought they were tolerable. It was fun to make though, the dough is like play-doh.

Wasn't so sure about these as I was putting them in the pan.  It reminded me of wet silly putty!  But I baked them up and they were excellent (for vegetarian ribs)!   I haven't eaten meat in a year and I really miss bbq sauce.  I really enjoyed this meal.  My kids and husband ate them up also!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!  My husband and I were missing biting into something "meaty" so I found this recipe and was sooo impressed with the texture and flavour.  The recipe was very quick, easy and very forgiving: I made a couple little changes, like others, by adding liquid smoke and some browning liquid, as well as mixing everything together instead of bothering with coating the gluten mixture.  Even with these changes it still worked great.  It's now a definite "regular" in our meal plan.

These were AMAZING! My carnivorous husband said it was the best vegetarian food he's ever eaten in the 16 years we've been together. The only thing different I did is used sunflower butter instead of peanut cause I have an allergy. It only took about ten minutes to prepare.

For me, this recipe was very frustrating to make.  A big mess and I was unable to make anything that resembled ribs.  It looked like little dumpy hamburgers.  HOWEVER, this was quite tasty, and when you cut the cooked gluten, it did look and have similar texture to meat, not to mention the little "bites" were quite addicting.  I would make this again, but I will be more prepared for that "shock" factor of the mess.  To save on costs, Make your own gluten!  (Thank you Scurl!)

These are great. Use a rocking pizza cutter to cut the dough (just easier and you get better leverage than with a knife). Form the dough into rib-like sections and bake.

these were great, I didn't add the yeast and it still had a great flavor.I have made it twice now and the first time they cooked a little too long and were crunchy, the second time i cooked them less than recomended and they turned out great.

After reading some of the reviews I got a little nervous but pressed on.  My mixture never turned into a ball it was pretty soupy but the onions and oil mixed in nicely and they worked well on the baking sheet.  I baked for 35 minutes and had the bbq sauce on for 20 because I like the flavor of cooked sauce and it turned out very well.  Will definitely keep on my summer menu for get togethers

Very good for the first time making it. My family was not impressed at first with the big blob. I added liquid smoke, onion powder, and garlic powder. Once it had baked they all thought it was very tasty, meat eaters and vegetarians alike. The only one who did not like it was my youngest son because he hates peanut butter and he saw me coat it in peanut butter (you can't taste the peanut butter). Next time I will make it and tell him I did not use peanut butter. I plan to still tweak the recipe maybe less water since I had a blob instead of a ball.

I love this Recipe! I does take some tweaking. I cut down the onion in my second batch, and added a couple cloves of garlic. I tried a similar recipe that did do the onion/oil and called for a good deal of needing. the texture came out like  bad hamburger steaks rather than ribs.  I appreciate the author mentioning what kneeding would do. If you want that 'bite' don't knead. It won't fool a meat eater but I'd admit as a 2 year vegetarian I felt a bit guilty eating these. 

One side note for those of you on the go like me: These freeze GREAT, and reheat in the microwave very well, similar to the frozen ribs you buy. I'm freezing a entire batch (I got 6 smaller riblets) for quick meals. I bought most of my stuff bulk. Each rib comes to around .35-.50 cents per rib, compared to 3 plus bucks for a box of two. AND these taste a heck of a lot better.

The flavor was of bbq sauce and the texture was a cross between jello and bread.

I made this recipe exactly as listed. We ate them with our hands and they're just like real ribs. The texture is perfect and authentic. Definitely a must for vegetarians like me who miss ribs :)

I just made these for the first time and I didn't have the nutritional yeast to add, so I omitted it.  They were still very yummy!  I'd use less salt next time.

Amazing!  As a couple who are doing a one year vegetarian challenge, this recipe was so welcome as it was delicious and makes you feel like you're eating meat.  
The gluten mixture seemed very liquidy but baked up really well - a bit too well with a convection oven so we will try the regular setting next time, and perhaps baking it a little less.  All in all - LOVED this one.

These are really good! I had it with salad, but I don;t recommend. A better side dish would be plain rice or a baked potato, because the taste in these "ribs" is really strong. I added more seasoning to the mixture, including roasted garlic. I think I might have made them not thick enough, because the bottom was somewhat crunchy. Or perhaps 50 min in the over is a bit much for some ovens. Anyway, will definitely make it again when I am craving meat!

It was fun to make! I had cut the recipe in half and it worked out great. I did cut back on the water as others had suggested. The first bite was weird, but they were yummy and I ate them for days! Great idea (kinda expensive)!

I made these because my boyfriend wants to become a vegetarian. He hated them. The texture is what got to him, I think - he compared it to eating stale bread. I had no problem eating it and, if I wasn't told, I would think these ribs were meat. I thought they were excellent, some good spice to them if you use Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce...but tastes differ for everybody.

I have been a vegetarian for a a while and have been more than happy ditching meat.  However, my wonderful husband just chose to be a vegetarian and has been missing meat a little.  So, on a whim I tried this recipe with no expectations.  I followed it to a T and they turned out amazing.  I was worried when I pulled them out to slather on BBQ sauce because they were dry and crispy.  The sauce finished them nicely though and they ended up with the yummy taste and consistency of meat.  YUM!  Can't wait to try again but will use 1/2 recipe.

I love these 'ribs'. They are so delicious! There are two things I miss most about eating meat - buffalo chicken wings, and BBQ ribs. These are extremely satisfying alternatives and making them is quite fun. Kind of reminds me of playing in the mud, in a good way. It was a new experience and I am sure I did some parts wrong - but it came out great anyway. I used a very sweet BBQ sauce to coat them and used way more than 2 cups. I am a person who loves texture in food, and the texture in these were amazing! Chewy, a tad crunchy on the outer edges, and tender in the middle - they were perfect and reminded me of real meat. I will make these again and again! Now if only someone would make a convincing buffalo chicken wing substitute, my life would be complete.

Delicious! Highly recommended, crispy, chewy, and very filling. I am SO glad you said to keep going with this recipe. It seemed odd, and possibly awful. Instead, everyone in my family loved it! I just left the BBQ sauce off a few pieces for my 2 picky girls, they liked it with ketchup.

The flavor was quite delish!!! I served it on a bed of spinach and had it for lunch quite filling.   I too did not have a ball but instead scooped it on to the baking sheet;maybe next time I'll experiment with the water ratio. Thanks for a great vegetarian option.

The texture was a little off for me; but, it definitely wasn't bad at all.  My carnivore husband said it wasn't bad after he talked about how it looked while I was preparing it.  I tweaked some by adding bell peppers with the onions, it really brought out the flavor well.  Pair it with baked beans, corn on the cob, and potato salad and the meal is complete.

I'm vegetarian, my hubby is not, and I just made these. I liked them but did not love them. My hubby didn't really like them, but he did take a few bites without much complaint.  Generally, these were easy to make.  The dough is pretty impliable!  The ribs do come out resembling bread sticks but honestly, it was a great alternative to processed fake meat. I'd make this again - hopefully I'll improve on the recipe over time.

I'm sorry but, I really did not like this.  Neither did my husband or my stepdaughter.  I've never met a food my stepdaughter didn't like until now.  It tasted like a mushy, chewy lump of dough.  It was very bland.  What flavor it did have was somewhat bitter.  I thought the flavor of the BBQ sauce would mask the odd flavor of the "ribs" but, it did not.

Almost as good as the real thing!  My kids had no idea and my husband really enjoyed them.  I add a little honey and A1 steak sauce to my BBQ sauce for an extra kick.  Super easy to make as well!

HOLY COW!  These are so delicious!  I have made the recipe twice and my husband and I are hooked.  I tried to reduce the oil, but the ribs burned in the oven, so I won't do that again. I did, however, add some garlic and onion powders and cayenne pepper to the dry ingredients to add a little more flavor.  I have been craving ribs, but don't eat meat anymore and these really satisfied my craving.  These are excellent left over and are delicious in a sandwich too!

Messy Messy! took a lot of work too. A little on the expensive side too, I thought it wasted a lot of my olive oil and paprika. I found it to be chewy but good as long as you have a delicious BBQ sauce coated on them things your good to go! As I said good but not great we might make try to make them again. Thanks for the great idea and recipe!

Sorry, I'm retyping my review since I got fast fingers on the first! Anyways, second time making this, still love them, but I find it impossible to handle them well enough to form them into anything decent! Perhaps next time I'll do Alicia's (sorry for misspelling your name) recommendations, mix all them add gluten. Man, once that stuff gets wet, it's all downhill from there! And yes, I agree with baking time, both times I cut it by 10+ minutes & the BBQ baking down to 5! They always turn out awesome they just look like...

I made these to try something new,  I added garlic powder and onion powder to the dry ingredients and garlic to the oil mixture.  I used about 1/4 cup less of the oil too.  My vegetarian family thought they were tasty.  I am always happy to make a different recipe and would certainly make it again.

Amazingly delicious!  Anyone who gave this recipe less than 5 stars, clearly did not follow the directions or perhaps used a yucky BBQ sauce.  We used Sweet Baby Rays - the BEST!!!  The first time I made it, was for some vegetarians that were going to be at our WING COOK-OFF Contest - we had to have something yummy for them.  When the ribs had cooked for 40 minutes in the oven, I put them in fridge planning to cook them off the next day before the party.  Well, they swelled up really big in the fridge over night and I cut them into smaller pieces added the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ and cooked them on a very low heat until the party.  THEY STOLE THE SHOW - Everyone was asking for the recipe!  And they actually came in the top 3 on the wing contest!   Now, my sister made them and did not refrigerate them and she said they were not as good - so maybe something is to be said for refrigerating them before you cook them off in the BBQ sauce!  Just one word about these ribs: DELICIOUS!!!

These are soooooooo good. They really satisfy that meat craving I get once in a while. I made them for my carnivore boyfriend the same day his brother was making real ribs and he liked the veggie ones as much as he liked his bro's.  (At least he said he did.  :)  )

I think I must have not mixed well enough, I could taste pockets with peanut butter!   The flavor is good I added beef better then bullion to the onions instead of the salt.

I really did not like these at all.  I am a vegetarian and I enjoy most vegetarian foods, so I really thought these would be good, but they just weren't.  I had no trouble making them, but I guess I was not expecting the chewy weird texture (and I like tofu!).  I don't know how people could call them breadsticks, really the texture was nothing like bread.

These were really good.  They did not look like the pic, though.  The dough was very wet, I couldn't roll, it basically was one big blob, so I cut it when it was cooked.  Next time I would use less liquid.  Otherwise, they were very yummy!!  My husband loved them!!

What a strange recipe, but it works!! I kept draining any excess water and my ribs turned out thick with great texture. This recipe may work  in other ways...I'm going to try making balls and adding them to a sweet & sour dish and also try them with ketchup (instead of BBQ) for more of a 'meat loafy' dish.

I loved this recipe and, like everyone else, thought I'd messed it up.  They are really tasty!  I would like to know how to make them thicker, though.  Mine spread out quite a bit.  Any ideas?

I have made a variation of this recipe several times.  I like it a lot. However, the step to make holes with a skewer and massage peanut butter and onions in is messy and never seems to work.  I prefer to mix the liquid I use veggie broth and peanut butter together in a blender then add it to the dry ingredients.  This evenly distrutes the peanut butter throughout the mixture.

The barbecue is the flavor, so make sure you like your barbecue sauce. We did the chewy variant, and the ends were crunchy/burnt, like a cookie, so try and keep the thickness even throughout the rib. The batter is super weird (I called it "horrifying" more than once), and I thought I messed up. I did not. Texture was stupendous, very dense and meat-like. They're extremely filling.

Nutritional Yeast has a somewhat cheesy flavour.  As well as a flavour enhancer, it's an excellent source of thiamine and B12...with protein and iron. It's pretty important when you're veg.  I sprinkle it on my prepared food, as well.

It's true it looked odd while I was cooking it, but it was fantastic. My boyfriend and I are vegetarian and it makes it so much easier having delicious recipes to share with our non-veggie family members in the house.

Help!  Tried this tonight, first time using vital wheat gluten. Followed all directions, but reduced oil to 1/3 cup, and water to 2 cups.   All seemed as described, I did knead it for a minute or two, as I wanted it slightly less chewy. It smelled and looked heavenly, but we could barely eat it, it was soooooooo cheewwwwwyyyyy, and the texture was more bread-like, not dense or meat-like.  I know you warned about cutting or rolling, and I definitely did NOT do either..

I was really hopeful about this recipe since one of the things I really miss as a vegetarian is barbecue. But the end product was mushy and tasted like bread. I don't think I'll be making this one again.
