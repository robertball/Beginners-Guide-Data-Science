These were great! Just like my mom makes them. If anyone else wants to make them, I'd like to suggest the perfect homemade salsa for them: tomatoes, dried red chiles, salt, garlic and oregano. That's it! Just boil quickly and blend into a smooth sauce. I think it complements this simple taco perfectly.

Loved this! I added some onions and peppers to the potatoes for color and taste.

Never thought to use leftover mashed potatoes for tacos....even though I have tried potato tacos at Mexican eateries and loved them!!! I am going to have these for lunch today. You can customize your potatoes and fillings in many ways too!!!

I didn't make this recipe as written. I made real mashed potatoes and mixed in sour cream and bacon. I also added minced garlic to the onions when sauteing (in bacon grease). And I added some cumin and a little chopped up jalapeno into the mashed potato bacon onions cheese mix. But I'm rating this recipe at 5 stars because it is a GREAT starting point for a simple dish that can be tweaked a hundred different ways. Mashed potatoes fried in a taco...what a fantastic idea!
