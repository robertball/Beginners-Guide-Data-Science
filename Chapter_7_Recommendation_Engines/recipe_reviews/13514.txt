This was great. I did change the preparation method, however: I tossed all of the vegetable cubes in olive oil and roasted them for about half an hour while I reduced the apple cider & wine. I added the cider-wine glaze to the pans and roasted an additional 15 minutes or so, until the glaze caramelized and any extra liquid had evaporated. I didn't use the butter, since I'd used olive oil for roasting. It looks like a ton when you're making it, but I think the number of servings is pretty accurate.

This was really good.  It even turned out despite my errors. I was impatient and didn't boil the apple juice and wine enough before adding the butter and pouring over the veggies.  I felt guilty and pulled them out of the oven after 5 minutes or so, drained it and put the apple juice and wine back on the stove to reduce further.  Then I reduced it too much!  I poured the mixture over the veggies again and threw it in the oven for a second time.  I let it cook for about 35 mintues and it turned out great!  So yummy!  I used a couple of sweet potatoes, some carrots and parsnips.  The veggies had a nice flavour and had a bit of a gourmet taste to them.  Not your typical cooked veggies.  I'll make this again; thanks Christine.

These were fantastic!  I used Brussels sprouts, cut in half and no rutabaga, and the Brussels were almost my favorites!  Except for maybe the parsnips - I love parsnips! Who knew?  I roasted this a bit longer than the recipe, until the liquid had boiled away to a nice glaze and the veggies got browned a bit.  I will definitely do this again!

I really liked this dish. It is a sweeter variation from traditional root bake (usually just garlic, herbs & oil oil), but  a nice change. I added beets and the juice mixed with the apple cider to make a nice sauce. Watch the cider/wine reduction it may take longer than 30mins, but make sure you are down to 3/4 cup before using. A great dish and I have already passed along the recipe! Thank you!

The slightly tart flavor from the apple juice didn't really fit with the veggies and it could use more seasoning of some sort.  Not really sure what would make this better.

This was fantastic!  It's rare that a recipe is worthy of a repeat in this kitchen, but this is one of them.  I've eaten way too much, I'm afraid.  I already know that turnips and rutabegas are disgusting, so the vegetables I used were:  parsnips, brussel sprouts, celery root (also known as celeriac), and carrots.  I feel it's worthy of a Thanksgiving side, but for a less formal meal, I chopped up some Al Fresco chicken sausages and added them in for heating up during the final toss.  A nice, easy, frugal, very filling meal, dirtying only one dish.

YUM!  I had no idea that I loved all of these root veggies!!  Roasting is the way to go!  I've made this several times and this last time, I took it to my husband's fire station during our Thanksgiving meal....here are the changes I made:  added fresh brussel sprouts - after cutting the veggies, toss them in olive oil and sprinkle w/ kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper - roast until slightly tender - meanwhile reduce the butter, wine and juice mixture - pour over veggies and continue roasting until thoroughly done - occassionally stirring.....

A yummy addition to a fall dinner, but these portions are huge - I made half the recipe and it was enough for 8. Also, it needed to stay in the oven for 75 minutes.

This was good but not what I expected.  I thought it would be more carmelized or candied but it really was just a roasted vegetable dish with a slightly sweeter flavor.  I would make it again, just nor for Thanksgiving like I did this time.

This was a wonderful dish. I did not use the sweet potato in mine and I added a chopped fennel bulb to the mix of vegetables.  I seasoned the vegetables with kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper, dry italian herbs and garlic olive oil. I started the roasting process while reducing the white wine and apple juice and then added the reduction to the vegetables and continued to roast them until tender. I served this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I coated in seasoned breadcrumbs, sprayed with cooking spray and baked in the oven. I had never eaten a parsnip, rutebega or turnip until I tried this recipe. This was hearty, filling and delicious!  My husband proposed to me again when he tasted this dish!

Yummy! I followed the instructions as written, except I added beets in addition to all the listed veggies. I don't know what some of the other reviewers were doing that gave them problems -- maybe not reducing the juice/wine enough? (It really does take 30 minutes.) I'll definitely make this again.

This was fantastic.  I did not include turnips and parsnips.  As a consequence, I probably had about twice as much sauce relative to the amount of vegetables.  

I used 1Tbs butter and 2Tbs olive oil.  After reducing the sauce volume, I added ~1/2 cup apple juice so there would be enough volume for all of the veggies to "boil" in the sauce.  I cut the veggies to 1/4" thick slices, and covered the casserole dish with aluminum foil while cooking. 

I served this with a chicken dish, and drizzled a bit of the sauce from the chicken dish on the veggies before serving. Yum!

Although the recipe looks like it would turn out great in the end, for me it didn't.  I don't know if it was my fault or not, but when I started to boil the white wine and the apple juice together, it got too thick (I boiled it for about 20 minutes), and it ended up sticking and burning the bottom of the pot.  That's as far as I got with the recipe.  I already had the veggies cut up by then, so I poured a little apple juice over them, added some seasonings and oil, and baked them.  I don't know if it was the pot I used or what, but I will definately try this recipe again.  Sorry about the negative feedback.
