We improvised on this, instead of bread, we used bread crumbs, 1 cup and a half, instead of barbecue sauce, we used ketchup, these were the ingredients we had on hand.  Quick and easy, with pretty much all the ingredients in the fridge, this will not disappoint!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is meatloaf to perfection!!! It is just yummy and everything about it is perfect, taste, texture, everything.

I halved the recipe for two persons and instead of 60 + 15 minutes, I cooked this 45 + 15 minutes. Turned out perfect!

Easy enough to prepare, but not as flavorful as I would've liked. I followed the recipe exactly, but should've trusted my "scratches-head" instinct at only adding the soggy bread, and not using a breadcrumb/egg as binder. I like my meatloaf to stay together well enough when sliced that I can use it for sandwiches as leftovers, and this one was too crumbly for my liking. I enjoyed the funky change of using BBQ sauce, rather than ketchup or marinara, on top, so that got thumbs-up from the family, but otherwise, I think I'll go w/ a different recipe next go around.

This was very good. I doubled the recipe, used homemade breadcrumbs (whole grain/french bread combo) and added about 2 cups shredded colby-jack cheese. I used a mixture of bbq sauce, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire, ketchup and black pepper for the topping and baked it as one "cake" in a bundt pan. Thanks for the recipe.

I really liked this meatloaf. I have been trying to make good meatloaf for years and was either not satisfied with the taste or not satisfied with the texture.  This meatloaf had it all, taste, texture and it was moist.  This is now going to be my meatloaf recipe.  The only thing I changed was I used bread crumbs (1/2 cup) instead of the bread because I didnt have any.

This recipe has now replaced my old meatloaf recipe. My old meatloaf recipe was too fluffy and was sometimes hard to swallow because of the fluffy texture. This meatloaf is fairly dense which is much more pleasant on the texture side of things. Plus, I'm also partial to fireman because I married one. :-)

If you like the taste of Hunt's Manwich sauce, you will like this.  The salsa adds the pepper kick, and it has just a slight sweetness from the BBQ sauce.  This was very juicy and not too firm and bready.  I used dried minced onion and it worked great.

I loved this meatloaf. The salsa adds a nice twist and the soaked bread keeps it moist.  I add a few of my personal favorite spices like celery salt and also fresh italian parsley, but it has become my husbands favorite meatloaf recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

This was so good! I didn't use the soaked bread, just a 1/3 cup of plain bread crumbs, it held together just fine and was plenty juicy. If you put the bbq sauce on before it goes in the oven, it glazes better. :) yummm its a staple recipe now.

Made this meatloaf for my grandfather and aunt last Sunday. They are ages 90 and 93 and I tell you I have never seen so much eaten at one sitting.  They both raved about how great this meatloaf was and wanted to know when I could make it again.  The only changes I made was used Italian seasoned bread crumbs rather than bread.  I like the texture it gives the meatloaf.  This recipe is a keeper....

Liked it, but can use some additions. I too used breadcrumbs and egg the second tme around, and that helps. More onion, and more Dijon. I love the Dijon component, and made a glaze using that and worchestershire. I like jalepeno, and suggest adding that as well, but my family prefers without. Use lean beef or this can be way too moist.

I followed the recipe except I used a brown sugar BBQ sauce and a bit more of it.  I chose very lean ground beef.  I made 8 mini loaves instead of 1 big one so I only cooked it for 45 minutes then 15 minutes, respectively.  A family friend joined us for dinner.  He and my husband both thought it was very good.  I think we all prefer the ketchup, not because this was bad, but because it is the taste we are accustomed to having with meatloaf.  However, I set a bottle of ketchup out and nobody used it.  I would make this recipe again.

Not awesome, but still pretty tasty. Was pretty crumbly so I might add more bread or bread crumbs. Also put in a TBSP of horseradish. Have to trust our Canadian firefighters, from all reports they know how to cook. will probably make again, was very quick and easy.

Despite not having the green onion and using picante sauce in place of salsa this turned out well. Crispy on the outside but moist on the inside.

Good stuff! I hardly ever follow a recipe unless I have everything it calls for. This was another one I didn't follow. 
I had made bread so I used that for the bread not wheat. I didn't have BBQ so I made my own. No Dijon just yellow mustard. lol no salsa just 2 slices of tomatoes and 2 slices of bacon from a BLT my honey never ate. Oh and no green onions chives from the garden. added A1 Sauce. I know its not what you were wanted us to try. But you gave me the jumping off point. I liked your recipe a lot. Thank you very much. :0)

This recipe was awesome.  I don't eat red meat so I don't usually eat meat loaf, but I really wanted to try.  So I used ground turkey instead of beef.  It tasted great, but if you're not familiar with ground turkey, it's a little drier than beef so you should reduce your cooking time by like 5-8 minutes.  It's not only tasty, but a healthier alternative too :)

As is, this was just okay. I would use more bbq sauce and some liquid smoke. I would also add an egg or two to bind it together. It was very moist it just didn't stay together like I wanted it to. Otherwise I enjoyed the different flavors, it was just a bit too bland for me.

Never been a fan of meatloaf but this is fantastic! We'll probably make this 2x a month. Definitely a staple for our family :)

This is a 10 star. I doubled the recipe and there was barely enough for 1 sandwich the next day.
The taste is rich and addictive.

Delicious. My new go-to meatloaf. Took out the green onions and used one whole small white onion, and added a little cayenne pepper. Fantastic!

Amazing amazing!!!! This was I think the best meatloaf I've ever made. The only thing I did different was use ketchup on top instead of bbq sauce, and I put it on before cooking, and then again halfway through. The flavor was perfect all round, and it's such a comforting food, I loved it. Will be making again many times to come.

I make this time and time and time again! It's foolproof and yet you can feel safe to add a little touch of your own here and there-i.e. shredded Colby cheese, hot salsa, more green onions, etc. I form it into a loaf and then place it into a shallow baking pan; makes it more rustic. Wednesday nights is Meatloaf night!

awesome recipe!  for those with squeeemish hands, I always use those latex gloves you can get at groc or drug stores called Exam Gloves or similar.  They are super for cutting onions, garlic, meat, and other food as well as near hot food (like near the hot oil in the frying pan), cleaning house, etc.  Try em out!

Very moist and tasty meatloaf! I substituted bread crumbs for the rye bread, and added extra mustard along with a dash of hot pepper sauce & worchestershire sauce. Also 'upgraded' to hot salsa and it turned out great. Instead of topping with bbq sauce or ketchup, try this: Mix beef boullion powder with 1 1/2 cups water and pour over top for entire duration of cooking time. When the meatloaf is done cooking, drain it off into small pot and thicken with cornstarch/water mix. Yummy built-in gravy!

This was delicious.  I had to sub in some ground turkey because I didn't have enough ground beef but followed with the rest of the recipe.  Turned out great anyway, the family couldn't taste the turkey at all.  And of course it was even better as leftovers.  I'll be making this again.  Thank you!!

Very good recipe. I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork which gave it even more flavor. Very moist and the BBQ sauce was a perfect compliment.

Sorry, but we did not like this recipe too much.  The meatloaf was crumbly (I even added an egg) It was too chunky(kids didn't like that)from the salsa and way too moist.  We did not like   the combination of salsa, mustard & diana sauce either.

I have always been one for hating meatloafs... ever since I was a kid I've disliked them. Well, my husband has finally converted me. This week is the second time we've made this one and it's been great both times! Not dry at all. It's very moist and actually has very good flavour. I'm quite impressed with it.
I would have again for sure.

This dish was a winner in our house last night!  My husband LOVES meatloaf and this delicious twist made him a very happy camper!  My son, age 10, said, "Ooooh Mommy!  This is YUM!"  I can see why the Canadian Firefighters love this!
I used ground turkey, added 1 extra-large egg, ground black pepper and my husband added a slice or 2 of the bread, unsoaked.

My son was able to make this.  I did not give it a 5 star, because we have one meatloaf recipe that tops this one.  It has oatmeal, milk, and cheese in the recipe.  A meatloaf recipe done right is moist, and it was!  My son could not interepret what it meant to soak the bread.  We used 2 Texas toast and 1/3 cup water.  We didn't drain anything.  We topped it off with our favorite BBQ recipe.

Very, Very flavorful! I compromised and used bread crumbs, about a cup only. Also, don't make the mistake of smothering it with BBQ Sauce, as it can have conflicting taste to it, use the posted amount of BBQ sauce as it is just right to give it that little zesty taste to it. Enjoy!

I'm not sure what went wrong, but this didn't go over well here. The meatloaf was fairly moist and flavorful, but the we found the salsa off-putting, and the flavor a bit odd.

Pretty good.  A good mix of favorite flavors.  Very tender.  Served with roasted potatoes and carrots.

this was a terrific recipe and very easy to do. I added bbq sauce at the front end as well as a topping in the final stage. It was especially tasty the following day when we had the leftovers. I know a lot of firemen as I was a police officer. Those ladies and gentlemen know how to cook and keep it simple!!

My hubby even enjoyed this one.  The only issue was soaking the bread.  I have no problem mixing up the ground beef with my hands, but wet bread is another story. YUCK! That's my own hang up though. :)  Did have to add a few crushed whole wheat crackers since was a bit too soft.  Next time will add an egg as many others suggested.  Will make this again (but think will stick to crackers or bread crumbs) Tasty!

The meatloaf was ok.  It just didn't have enough flavor for our tastes.  It was edible, but I will not make it again.

I love this meatloaf. My husband and I eat it a lot. I add more barbeque sauce. I put it in when I am mixing it and on top. Makes it really moist.

My husband wouldn't finish it - though the spices were weird.  I thought it was okay but nothing exciting.  Might try to do something based on it with diced tomatoes and herbs instead of salsa.  Also, I had too much ground beef - I couldn't find a 2lb package so it wasn't quite cooked in the middle but that was obviously my fault not the recipe's.

This was good but not the best meatloaf we've ever had. For what ever reason it was salty although we didn't add any extra salt to the recipe. I made it in the crockpot as we love how tender that always makes it and once again that method was top notch but we are still looking for the perfect meatloaf recipe!

This is a pretty good meatloaf.  I added an egg to help it stay together and didn't soak the bread as other reviewers had said not to do.  It was very moist and my family liked it.  My husband, however, is not a fan of mustard and said he could taste the mustard, so next time I might try to substitute the mustard with ketchup or bbq sauce.  All in all a a great recipe!

This was delicious! My husband is not much of a mealoaf person and he went back for more!  The only thing I did differently was mixing my own "barbeque" sauce with ketchup, mustard and brown sugar.

My DH and his 3 buddies loved this meatloaf. It was a flavorful tummy filler for 4 hard working electricians. My DH is traveling for work right now. He works away all week and is home on weekends. So all week I am cruisin' recipes of food that I can make up and freeze for him to take and cook. I mixed this all up and froze it, he baked it later the next week. He said it was perfect, just what 4 hungry men were looking for! Thanks for the recipe!

The meatloaf was good but was not any different than any other meatloaf I have had.  I used the wet bread and 1 egg, and my meatloaf stayed together perfectly.  My husband actually liked a different recipe I had better than this one.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  The salsa, onions and garlic give it a nice flavor and just a nice little kick.  I forgot to put the barbecue sauce on at the end, because I was anxious to taste the meatloaf, but it tasted just fine without it.  I will keep this recipe and make meatloaf using it from now on.

This recipe was awesome!! I loved the combo of flavors of the mustard, salsa and BBQ sauce. The only reason that I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because it did fall apart quite a bit. Next time I will use an egg and maybe more bread to hold it together. I will  be making this again.

You know, this was actually very good and very filling.  Just be sure to squeeze all of the water out of the bread, not just pour it out of the bowl.  Mine came out a little too wet because I didn't do that.  My husband loved this and it was great for leftovers for about a week!

This is a huge recipe!  Next time I'll put it in two regular loaf pans and freeze one.  For the two of us, we have almost made ourselves sick of it this week trying to get the leftovers used up.  Opted to use more salsa on top as BBQ sauce is not one of my favourite flavours.  This is a great recipe and a keeper; thanks.

I followed the recipe exactly. I found that my family and I didn't care for the mustard, salsa, and BBQ sauce mix too well- too bad, it smelled amazing! Perhaps I should have used some other brand of salsa? I don't know.

It was good but I think I deviated too far from the recipe to give it an accurate rating.  I used a lot of BBQ sauce, an egg, and bread crumbs.  I liked the salsa in it, it's a welcome change from the regular ketchup in most meatloafs.  It's not phenominal or much different then any other meatloaf, but it was good.

Tasted like a loaf of Manwich sloppy Joe. I usually make a meatloaf using salsa,onion,egg,breadcrumbs,cheese and thought I'd try something a little different. I think this is more a sandwich fixing meatloaf than one you would have with mash potatoes. Kind of dry and could have used an egg.

This is now the only meatloaf recipe I use!  It is such a hit in our house that I won't bother using anything else!  The only variation that I make is that I use meatloaf mix: Pork, veal, and beef.  It sets up nicely and doesn't fall apart.  It makes a nice sized loaf and of course, that makes for nice meatloaf sandwiches.  I use my handy Cuisinart Griddler to make meatloaf quesadillas and meatloaf paninis and the guys couldn't be any happier.  Really, really good recipe!

This meatloaf was great, everyone loved it. it would get a 5 star but i think next time i'll use bread crumbs, not soaked bread. I found it didn't mix as well. 

Other then that it was awesome.

I have been making meatloaf with salsa for a while.  It really makes a good meatloaf with less effort, as some onions and peppers are right there in the salsa.  I will have to try the Dijon mustard, though.

My husband says out of the 3-4 recipes I've tried for meatloaf, he likes this one the best.  I personally liked the salsa in it however my 2 1/2 year old did not each much probably BECAUSE of it even though I served it with gravy...and he's normally a good eater.  I'll try it again and see if he changes his mind but if not, I don't think I'll use this recipe again.  If so, next time I'll used less salsa and add an egg to help hold it together.  Also, I found that 60 + 15 was not long enough in the oven.  Other meatloaf recipes I've used say to cook to internal temp of 160.  I had it at 400 to begin since I was pressed for time and it still took me the same amount of time with the last 10 @ 450.

This is ok.  I would recommend using an egg and crackers not bread.  Will not be making this again. Will stick to the traditional meatloaf.

We rarely have meatloaf because they are usually uninteresting. This one has good flavor, probably because of the salsa which I love. Adding an egg to the mixture helps keep it together.

This was good, but it's not like a traditional meat loaf.  It has no ketchup or eggs in it!  I only gave it 4 stars because my husband didn't really care for it; he said he'd rather have "regular" meat loaf.  But I thought it was good!

By far the BEST meatloaf I've ever had. I'm so glad I found it. I've made it at least 10 times over the last few years. Everyone loves it. Thanks for sharing! It's got a ton of flavor and the perfect texture. I use panko crumbs soaked in water as a replacement for the bread sometimes. Still comes out amazing.

Wowowow this recipe was wonderful. I did make a few changes with the recommendations from other reviewers. Just omitted the bread added breadcrumbs and an egg And used garlic seasoning. Used a bundt pan as well, good suggestion. Also used ketchup on top, personal preference. My husband loves meatloaf and really liked this. Definite keeper!!!!

I decided  to make this tonight despite the irony that my boyfriend and I are both cops and this is a firefighter’s recipe lol! Needless to say we absolutely loved the recipe. I mean a firefighter's recipe should be good since they have plenty of time to perfect it in the kitchen when they are sitting around doing nothing in the station (just a little cop/hose humor)! 
Anyway....back to the recipe....I didn't have the bread on hand so I used 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs.  I also added one egg because I wanted to make sure the loaf stayed together and didn't break apart.  Due to the job and busy schedules I actually made this in the morning (minus cooking it), put it in the fridge, and in the evening sat it out for about 20 mins while the oven heated up and then cooked it exactly how the recipe states.  My boyfriend originally grabbed a bottle of ketchup to drown the meatloaf in but I asked him to take a taste first before he ruined it. Needless to say he loved it so much he forgot all about the ketchup (he even went back for seconds).  This will definitely be added to my regular rotation of recipes.

I made NO changes.  Wanted to give 4 1/2 stars. My husband HATES meatloaf but really liked this one. No, its not as firm as some like their meatloaf but I thought the texture was perfect. Thats just how I roll :)  Very flavorful.

First, this was really good as is. My wife said, "Don't get a big head, but this might be the best meatloaf I've ever had." She doesn't like meatloaf or ketchup so that's saying something. Here's what I changed, no bbq sauce (seemed weird but I'll try it next time), added some breadcrumbs to the wet bread, and because we looked at each other and said in unison, meatloaf with no egg?, I added one. Delicious but still fell apart trying to slice it. So next time, TWO eggs, breadcrumbs and no wet bread, the moisture in the salsa was plenty to keep it moist, more green pepper and maybe hot salsa. New go to meatloaf so I'll make this over and over, with those tweaks. And I'll consider doubling it because this won't last through lunch tomorrow.

With the addition of an egg for a binder, would give this recipe 5 stars...and changed the glaze from bbq sauce to 1/2 cup ketchup with 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar instead...yum

Made it the first time with no spring onion, and the second time without. I preferred it without. It was really good and moist

Very nice recipe.   I wouldn't soak the bread again it made the meatloaf too moist so it fell apart.   The flavor was really good.
I added honey mustard because I didn't have dijon.  I also used Jack Daniels barbeque sauce.

I would not make this again. It had no flavour except for the bbq sauce.   I went with the recipe but it needed eggs to bind it all together for slicing, and breadcrumbs would be better.

A very moist, soft and delicious meatloaf.  The seasonings were perfect and not overpowering.  This is an excellent meatloaf. .

No green onions, but added a half green pepper, a few chopped sweet peas, celery, brown mustard vs Dijon... top with ketchup, serve with a side of instant mashed potatoes and pretty darn good meatloaf!

We thought this was just ok.  I cut the recipe in half for just me and my husband.  Instead of the bread, I used bread crumbs (about 3/8C) and an egg as a binder.  Maybe that was the issue.  We found that it lacked flavor, other than the BBQ sauce on top.  We wound up putting more BBQ sauce over the rest of the meatloaf so it had more flavor.  I suppose it could have also been the salsa I used (Pace Picante).  Despite cutting the recipe in half, it took about 1 hour + 20 minutes to cook.  The texture was pretty good but there were some mushy areas.  There's no way I could slice it, it kind of just fell apart.  I think overall, I'd use a different recipe, one that we know we like better.

I made this according to directions. Based upon texture I added more bread crumbs.  The flavor was good, but like other comments, this needs eggs and crackers for binding.   I would add in the future.

Didn't care for it.  Bread didn't work to bind it nearly as well with the salsa as when I normally make a meatloaf with bread crumbs, egg, and milk.

This was pretty good! Very moist! I used my homemade salsa, and white bread instead of wheat because it's what I had on hand. I didn't use the bbq sauce either.  I will make this again!

All I can say is, Canadian firefighters must have a strong taste for the irredeemably bland and tasteless. Every meat loaf I have ever tasted is the same: dull and pointless, and this one is no exception. Is there a substance on this planet that can get ground beef cooked in a loaf pan to taste like something anybody would want to eat? I've tried onions, soup mixes, salsa, garlic, peppers, tomatoes and variant sauces, seasonings of every stripe and none of them can break down that wall of defiant and impenetrable nothingness. This recipe goes to the shredder.

Very Good! Accidentally added the bbq sauce to the meat mixture, but half way through cooking time I topped the loaf with thinly sliced tomatoes and another drizzle of bbq sauce. Also, I soaked the bread in milk. Next time I might add more salsa to the mix for a bit more flavor or maybe a salsa with a little more heat than the one I used. Leftovers made a great sandwich!

I thought I had a good meatloaf recipe.  I decided to make this one to mix it up,  The reaction from my family was amazing, they ate it up so quick it was the only way faster if made it a liquid and gave them a straw.  This is a quick, easy and awesome recipe, try it.

Made this for my family tonight.  Everyone loved it.  Only change I made was I tore the bread into small pieces and then added all the other ingredients except the beef.  I mixed this all together and then added the beef.  I think it blended the flavors more.  No need to add water to bread. Turned out delicious and my daughter-in-laws asked for a copy of the recipe.

Absolutely loved this! My 8year old loved it too. Only thing I changed was I added more BBQ sauce on the top then what it called for.

It was delicious; I love meatloaf, so I thought I'd try this one. It smelled great while it was in the oven, too!

Made according to recipe, using 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs and an egg in place of the bread as another reviewer suggested. Could have used at least another 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs in order to make it hold together better. Taste was great! Husband and son loved it! I even had the good fortune to have some Diana's bbq sauce on hand. :) The onion, green onion and salsa are the real flavor players here!
I formed the  mixture into a loaf in a 9" dish and just because i had it,  laid partially cooked bacon slices over the unbaked meatloaf after brushing it with the bbq sauce. Brushed the bacon with bbq sauce, too and baked it about 40 minutes at 350 (it was a glass dish) till the bacon was crisp and the meatloaf registered 170 degrees. Really, really good! Will definitely make again, with or without added bacon!

Only thing I did different was put ketchup and mustard mixed on top instead of bbq sauce. Very good! Made homemade mashed potatoes and salad with it.

Delicious! I can stop searching for the best meatloaf recipe now because I finally found it. It is moist and delicious both hot or cold! The only changes I made were minor because I used what I had on hand. Oatmeal bread instead of wheat, Ingelhoffer stone ground mustard instead of Dijon, excluded green onion but added a little more chopped onion, & I didn't top the meatloaf with sauce.

This was fantastic. I've been eating my mother's recipe since I was a kid and needed something different. I used hot salsa but made no other changes. Will definitely make again. Maybe with some chipotle peppers....?

I soaked the bread (3) slices  in milk (not water) and added two (2) eggs. Instead of salsa I substituted ketchup.
 For onions, I used granulated onion powder. The loaf had a wonderful aroma before it went into the oven. 
I give this variation a thumbs up approval . Can't wait for an hour to bake

Flavor was wonderful, moist and juicy, only thing I didn't care for was the texture (too soft, crumbly).  Will definitely make again, maybe with breadcrumbs. Thanks for sharing!

Tasty meatloaf! I scaled to 6 servings as I had 3 lbs ground beef. I used fresh breadcrumbs that I made from rye bread and did not soak with water, used dried minced onion for the onions, omitted mustard, omitted salt and added 1 egg. Baked 1 hour at 375 then 40 minutes at 400 for the augratin potatoes. Needed more than 1 tbsp BBQ sauce, personal preference.

This was OK, though I think I added too much salt so that was my fault. I did make some changes (1 cup panko instead of bread, 2 eggs, chopped bell pepper that needed to use up, chipotle-garlic seasoning, picante instead of salsa) and it held together well and had good moisture. Would probably make again, with less salt and maybe some cheese. Not a fan of the BBQ sauce on top though.

Have made this several times now and it is fantastic. It's even better when you put some mozzarella on top during the last 20 minutes. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who says they don't like meatloaf.

This was a great recipe.  I modified it by adding two eggs and using meat loaf meat (beef, veal, pork) instead of ground beef.  Also threw in a little chopped spinach.  Will definitely make again.

Didn't have green onions but it was still great. Don't pour out too much fat before adding cheese, as it makes it a bit dry and that was my fault. Great flavor!

Exchanged 1 1/2 cups plain breadcrumbs for the bread and added one egg.  I always thought my meatloaf recipe was pretty good but everyone who ate this said it was the best  meatloaf that I had made.  Great recipe.

Best meatloaf I ever made. It was months ago and I forgot to rate it. When I went looking for this recipe I had to search for it. For some reason it was way down the line. Finally copied it to my favorite recipes and will not have to hunt for it again.

My son hates meatloaf, but he actually ate this one! My boyfriend always asks me to make this recipe when we are having meatloaf for dinner! It is so good. I have also substituted hot and regular Ro*Tel when I didn't have salsa and it was a great substitute. Definitely recommend this recipe to all meatloaf lovers

Absolutely delicious! So moist and tasty. 10/10! Only a couple of minor changes - used dry breadcrumbs in place of bread and added bbq sauce directly to meat mixture and topped the meatloaf with the remaining salsa in the jar. However, the meatloaf was breaking apart when I lifted it from the tin. I should have realised that this needs a binding agent such as an egg or two to hold it together. Will do that next time - and there will be a next time! Awesome recipe. Thank you for this.

Instead of bread, used italian seasoned bread crumbs - one heaping cup- and added one egg.. I substituted ground elk for beef. Made this recipe for guests and made it again 2 days later it was so good. It's a keeper!

I loved it, but did have to make a few adjustments as far as salsa goes.  I only had hot and mild so I mixed it but it's the best meatloaf I've ever tried!

I thought the flavors in this meatloaf were great.  I followed the instructions  and it turned out fine and everyone enjoyed.  I will make this again with the following changes:
This meatloaf turned out to "soft" for our tastes and mostly fell apart.  I would eliminate the two slices of wheat bread and instead add one cup breadcrumbs and 1 egg.
The barbecue finish on top was beautiful.  Don't miss that part!

It's time for low-carb meals after the holidays.  I usually don't care much for meat loaf, but hubby likes it.  I decided to try some different recipes that wouldn't make the hubs suspicious that I was doing something 'weird' to it.  I fixed this one just as directed except used gluten-free bread.  This one hit the bull's eye.  The salsa adds a savory dimension that those without just don't have yet you really couldn't pinpoint that there was any salsa or even any tomatoesque ingredient  in it at all.   Then the smidge of BBQ sauce added just a little sweetness to it.  I will made this again!

I'm not typically a fan of meatloaf, but my boyfriend loves it so I tried this recipe. It was very, very good! I swapped 1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs for the bread. I'd also suggest adding an egg for binding.

I was planning on leftovers.  Not with this recipe though.  My family ate it all before I could even taste it!

I combined this recipe with the Easy Meatloaf. My husband likes ketchup as the topping and I prefer barbeque sauce. So combining the two recipes made it perfect. I'll be making it again soon!

This makes a tender, juicy, meatloaf that doesn't fall apart when sliced. We cut the recipe in half and, using other suggestions because of what we had on hand, substituted Italian bread crumbs(3/4 cup) for the soaked bread, onion powder for the onions, catsup for the barbecue sauce, and horseradish Dijon mustard for the Dijon. Cooked for 45 minutes before topping with catsup and cooked another 15 after that. Thank you for the recipe and thank you ARCEL16 for your suggestions

This was delicious.  I can't eat wheat so I substituted 1/3 c of finely ground Kasha (toasted buckwheat, which is not wheat despite the name) and soaked it in 1/4 c of water.  I had bought a meatloaf mix of beef and pork.  I read through a bunch of reviews before making it.  I took the advice to add an egg to hold it together.  I didn't have green onions so I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of dried onions.  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used spicy brown mustard and some horseradish sauce.  I layered the BBQ sauce on the top.  It was wonderful.  My son and I ate FAR too much, but there was still plenty of leftovers for the fridge and freezer.

I don't personally eat beef but my boyfriend does so I made this for him. He raved about it and asked me to make it again. The only thing is that he wanted ketchup on top of it every time. He told me it was a winner.

I really liked this meatloaf. I found the ingredients amounts sort of odd, esp. the onions though. I only had 1 lb of ground beef, so I could only make 1/2 recipe which was fine. I used Trader Joes 96% lean ground beef and their Kansas City BBQ sauce. I think the salsa was ChiChis brand, just a simple basic salsa. I finely minced the white onion, being as there wasn't much. I am glad I did, because after one hour of baking they were still oddly sort of crunchy. Unless, that was the salsa. I didn't have wheat bread, but I had parmesan bread sticks from Sam's club. For 1/2 the recipe I just used 1/2 of a bread stick. I didn't soak it in water. I just poured the salsa on top while I measured out the rest of the ingredients. I didn't have to do the draining part as my ground beef was so lean. I baked it in an oval shape in a foil lined pan I sprayed with cooking spray. It seemed done after an hour. I sprinkled it with a little garlic salt and topped with the bbq sauce. I probably added a bit more bbq sauce than suggested. I have never added that, that I can think of to a meatloaf, and liked that. I put it back in the oven for 5-7 minutes with the oven turned off. This was easy for a last minute meal. I would make it again. A nice change to salty seasoning packets. With the salsa and bbq sauce it is a little bit different though than the usual beef gravy type meatloaf. 1/2 the recipe, made as written here, yielded 4 good sized servings at about 220 calories each. ty

This is the best moatloaf I have had yet.  I made it just as the recipe describes, though I did add a couple of squirts of sriracha.   I also added an egg to bind it together.   It must be the addition of salsa and the whole grain mustard.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious!  My husband and I added a bit of cayenne, chili powder, and some chopped jalapeno pepper to give it some extra kick.  We also topped half of it with barbeque sauce, and half of it with ketchup.  We preferred the side with the ketchup on it, because it didn't take away the taste of the seasonings, as much as the barbeque sauce did.  Barbeque sauce also made the dish too sweet for our taste.  Very good!

This was great! Only thing I did by mistake was mix the BBQ sauce in,and later realized it so ended up putting more on top (per the instructions). We really liked this a lot.

This Meatloaf was tasty, but just was not my favorite. All of my brothers loved it and went back for seconds! I put BBQ sauce in it and made a mustard/ketchup mixture for the top.

Made this for a family reunion and it disappeared in minutes. Obviously tripled the ingredients. Awesome meatloaf.
