Wow - this was awesome!  I did not make the cheese sauce (too much work so early in the morning) or use shrimp - but followed the recipe - adding only some fresh chive to the eggs - and it was rich and lovely.  I had some crab that my husband brought home from Alaska and we were saving for a special occasion.  It is always a risk making something for the first time when using expensive ingredients.  All I can say that the crab was not wasted on this dish - it was perfect for showing off the decadent nature of the seafood.  It was lavish and heavenly.  Many thanks for a great recipe!!!!!!!!!

A lot of work for what is really just scrambled eggs with shrimp in cheese sauce. And the scrambled eggs are a lot easier and faster than the rolled omelets which get cold or dried out while assembling them.

I made this for dinner and wouldn't change a thing. I didn't think it took too much time like the previous post.

Unbelievably good!! I made this with snowcrab legs and fresh shrimp (they're SO cheap atm). The only things I did differently were to make the omelettes with milk instead of cream, I used extra-Sharp Cheddar cheese (upped the amount a bit), and I omitted the nutmeg. Also sprinkled some sliced green onion over the top. What a delicious and decadent Christmas Day breakkie. Thanks, Jennyw!!

I was a little worried reading some of the reviews that it was just OK.  Boy, with some very minor modifications, it was amazing!  I doubled the recipe to serve several of us.  

I also had fresh crab, so I used 12 oz. of that rather than 1/2 shrimp 1/2 crab.  This was more than enough meat, so I did not double that part.  I used a few shakes of Old Bay seasoning in the filling sauce, a bit of paprika, and about 3 shakes of Louisiana hot sauce for some kick.  Any time that heavy cream was called for, I used evaporated FF milk.  

As for cooking the eggs, I cooked 1 cup of the eggs in a 10" skillet, and just kept rotating the pan, rather than trying to flip it.  I made 2 large omelets, instead of several small ones.  I used 1/2 the crab filling in each one on half the cooked omelet, flipped it over, and topped with cheese sauce.  

My husband thought it was to die for, and it takes a great meal to truly impress him.

Sorry...this just was "ok"....nothing special.  I had really looked forward to surprising DH with this one.  He liked it but said it needed alot of "stuff" added to make it over the top, so to speak.

Very good. We had some leftover Dungeness crab from the night before and this was a perfect use for it. We did not need the shrimp as we had enough crab. The filling was a perfect mixture that accented the taste of the crab without overpowering it. 

Also, instead of using the sauce part of the recipe, I used hollandaise sauce to top the omelette with.

I had such high hopes for this one. I was very disappointed in what turned out to be a major mistake in serving this to my family.

This was tasty but rich.  Too much for breakfast, but we did enjoy it for dinner with a glass of white wine. :)
