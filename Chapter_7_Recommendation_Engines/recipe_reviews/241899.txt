I have made roasted red pepper hummus numerous times and thought I would change it up with this recipe. Definitely don't skip the tahini. Overall, the recipe is very fresh but a bit too lemony for my family. I would reduce the zest and juice by half or use a very small lemon.

I brought this to a kids birthday party and it was a huge hit!! Fresh herbs are a must in this dish.  I was glad our garden had all of the herbs listed. I have a severe allergy to sesame so I substituted EVOO for the tahini. Tahini is a rich flavor so I used an pretty expensive olive oil to compensate for the missing sesame. Turned out delicious! The vegetables garden looked great too! Will be making this again soon.
