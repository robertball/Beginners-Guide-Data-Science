Best crackers I have had; better than anything I can buy. We topped ours with an egg wash and rosemary & sea salt.

Some times for easier preparation. We cut parchment paper to the exact size of the baking tray, then rolled the dough between the parchment and freezer paper, enabling us to get the dough thinner. The parchment was slid onto the baking tray without the freezer paper. Finally, we perforated the sheet of dough, so that the crackers broke apart perfectly when they were done baking.

Absolutely yummm! I made these without the onion powder (didn't have) and I added black sesame seeds and poppy seeds and they turned amazing =) One thing to add: first batch was a bit more unsalted than expected (everyone liked them still) so for the second one, I sprinkled a dash of salt on top of each unbaked cracker...just the touch they needed!

I've made these once just as the directions indicated and really enjoyed them. Be forewarned they make a lot, next time I'll halve the recipe since it's just me who eats them. Next time I'll roll them out thinner since mine were thicker than say a Saltine. Also, I cooked mine a lot longer since I wanted them really crunchy - I just bumped the timer in 3 minute increments. They have a very earthy flavor and pair well with hummus. Next time I'll experiment with different seeds and such. (To be completely honest my dad and husband didn't care for these, and ironically my husband said they tasted "artsy", which was fitting considering the name). :)

I didn't have all of the ingredients that were used so I subbed in a few items .  the crackers were delicious.  Left to rest too long, the dough became more elastic and tried to shrink back on itself when I was rolling it out, but I made it work.  I found that cutting them into the size I wanted the crackers to be worked better for me than just piercing the dough sheet with a fork.

My family really loved these crackers, I did not have dried Chipotle powder, but I did have smoked Paprika and used it instead. Very savory crackers!!  I made them about a month ago, everyone who tried them liked them! They made a large canister full. 
I will use this recipe again today & possibly make a few variations & update my results!  Thank you Jennifer Ranger for a wonderful Homemade Cracker recipe!

Nice base recipe with a lot of room for switching stuff up. This yields a TON of crackers. I'm taking this batch to a party so I'm glad of it, but I'll probably half the recipe if I make it again for at home. The spices don't really pop, so if I make this again I'll probably increase them or add herbs/salt as a topping.  Make sure to roll the dough super thin. I found that it should be about the thickness of the seeds themselves. They'll raise up some once they bake, and don't expand outwards much at all.

I love love LOVE this recipe! Versatile enough that you can flavour your crackers any way you like. These have been a smash hit wherever I take them, delicious with cheese, and cost a fraction of the price of artisan crackers you buy at the store. And better quality, if you ask me. Easy to make, too!

We loved these crackers! They vanished off the table fast. I second the instruction to roll them out as thinly as possible. I baked them more than the suggested 8 minute--baked them until they were just beginning to brown at the edges, because I wanted them really crisp. I didn't have onion salt, and I halved the regular salt, but that and the garlic salt made them almost too salty. Will make them again! So easy and they look great on the table.

These are so GOOD! Used crushed red peppers, didn't have chipotle. I also brushed the tops with rosemary/garlic salt and evoo. Definitely will become a favorite!

I made these as written and rolled out thin as others suggested and they came out perfect. This recipe does make a lot of crackers! Next time I will experiment with other spices. I don't think I will ever buy crackers again.

I have never made crackers before, and this recipe was so easy! I replaced the chipotle with: hungarian spicy and smoky paprikas, and chili powder (we didn't have chipotle). I really liked the reviews about how to thin out the dough... but i kind of liked how they turned out without altering the recipe. Took 12 minutes instead (the oven i used might need to be calibrated based from previous experience). Thank you for sharing this recipe! Btw if you like salty crackers.. add a little more salt. I think its balanced well for whatever topping one prefers.

I didn’t have the proper seeds or all the spices so I was winging it a bit on that. Wanted a late night savory snack and nothing fit the bill; so I whipped up a half batch of these lovely crackers! So glad I did! They were delicious! Even DH enjoyed a few before he turned in. I enjoyed mine with some hummus. I will definitely have to make these again, properly following the recipe and rolling as THIN as possible. Mine ended up being a variety of thicknesses, even though I thought I was consistently thin. Think you’ve got it thin enough, keep going! They puff slightly!  All were tasty, but the thinnest ones were delightfully crisp!  Thank you for the recipe.

I changed 1/2 the flour to whole wheat flour, used 1/3 cup flax and 2/3 cup sesame seeds (I don't care for chia seeds), used smoked paprika instead of chipotle, and sprinkled the top with sea salt.  Very good.  I like that this recipe is so versatile.  Will definitely make again and possibly experiment with other changes.

TOTALLY YUMMY!   We can't get enough of these.  I love that this recipe is so versatile and open to making them "your own"  I have made these over and over and they are a hit every time.  They have to be put up high so we don't devour them all at once!  I have made several changes which we like but I'm sure the original is just as good.  Here is what I did differently:  1.)  I used 1 cup white and 2 cups whole wheat flour. 2.)  I used toasted Sesame Seeds instead of the flax.  3) I used a smidgen of cayenne pepper and the rest smoked paprika instead of the chipotle.  4:) I used Coconut oil instead of butter (the aroma free kind).  I roll them thin as suggested, and then sprinkle them with Herbamare Original before baking them.  Hope this helps but obviously you can put whatever seasonings you want in them  or on them and make changes to your taste ??  Enjoy..

Great simple recipe.  Ground sunflower seeds instead of flax and it worked great.

Fantastically delicious and easy.  Thank you to Hobbesque for her suggestion about rolling them out.  I rolled mine out between my silpat and a piece of saran wrap.  It was easy to get paper thin, then remove the saran wrap, cut with a pizza roller, pop in the oven and bake on the silpat.  The crackers slide off easily.  My hubby eats them about as fast as I can make them.

These crackers were easy and tasty.  Mine were not quite as crisp as I would like--possibly cutting in the butter gave it a more short (like pie crust) quality.  But the dough was much easier to manage than other cracker recipes, and I was able to roll it very thin.  This is definitely a keeper, and the crackers were of good enough quality to package in little plastic sleeves, tie with a bow, and give along with a cheese ball to those friends who can't eat sweets.

These are absolutely delicious! They taste clean and fresh, so much better than any store-bought crackers. They are amazingly easy to make and are attractive, which makes them perfect for entertaining.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have flax seeds so I put hemp hearts in instead. I also didn't have the pepper so I put in paprika in instead. My first batch I didn't make thin enough, but they still turned out tasty. I will be making them again!

I made a batch of these crackers yesterday, though I didn't get them thin either. They still ended up being fantastic. I made a triple batch this morning with caramelized onions. IThis recipe will be a forever favorite. Love them.
