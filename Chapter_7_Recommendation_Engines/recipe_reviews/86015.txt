What do you make when you don't have kids but you have your 5 year old niece and the next door neighbor's little girl over? This would be it! It's an easy, quick, healthy and delicious snack that I felt good about giving them. I got one bite because I can't resist peanut butter and it was really good. I didn't have the additional nuts, but I really don't think they're necessary.  You could put in mini chocolate chips if you want to be bad...

My kids thought this was beyond awesome. I used Craisins instead of raisins, organic honey and Trader Joe's organic peanut butter. My kids ate all four.....so much for four servings. I'd like to try this with almond butter or even Nutella. I swear, my kids were mmmmm'ing the whole time.

Easy, sweet and delicious! I used whole wheat tortillas and natural peanut butter to make them a bit healthier.

I just made these for two hungry tween boys.  They loved them!  Very easy to make. They were really messy though.  Make sure to provide napkins!

Wow!  The taste is amazing!  I'm not a huge fan of honey, so I used Agave nectar instead and used 1/2 tsp of McCormicks cinnamon sugar instead of plain cinnamon.  I sliced it into pinwheels (like the picture shows), but it kept falling out when my kids tried to eat them.  I will try to wrap it tighter next time, but probably just cutting in half would be better.

I used freshly made peanut butter with no sugar in it. It was delicious.

I really enjoyed them, made them for my daughter and wife and my daughter didn't like the peanuts and my wife said she could live w/o ever having them again. So split decision in the house.
