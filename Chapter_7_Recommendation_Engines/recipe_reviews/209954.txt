I made this for Thanksgiving and my adult sons who always insist that we also have ham cause they don't like turkey loved it.

I used this recipe for our Christmas Turkey yesterday. It did not disappoint! Wonderful flavors, sealed in moisture, beautiful color bird! It was a great hit. The recipe's a keeper! Thank you.

Just made this for Christmas dinner.  After spending all day basting the turkey every 30 minutes, I was very disappointed.  Had to put foil over turkey 3 hours into cooking as it was browning very rapidly.  Turkey was dry and did not retain any of the flavor of the glaze.

This recipe is fantastic. Quadrupled the recipe for a 25 lb turkey. I also added an 1/8 tsp of grated ginger to the sauce. When the turkey was finished I added 2 tsp of diluted corn starch to the left over sauce and served it. What a huge hit as a Christmas turkey. I highly recommend this recipe!

I used a 4-lb turkey half breast from Trader Joe's to make this glaze, cutting the recipe into 1/4 of the ingredients to do so.  I only used a spoon to glaze the turkey every once in a while, and it took about 1 1/2 hour to cook.  I thought it could have used pepper or even a little ginger or cayenne to "up" the seasoning a little.  But it did make a great easy dinner, and I'd make it again.  Thanks, keeky27!

Used this glaze over grilled pork tenderloin. Excellent!
