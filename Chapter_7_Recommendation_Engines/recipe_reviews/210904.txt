I  made this for Christmas dinner.  Recipe was GREAT, although I added more parmesean cheese and some fresh garlic.  Even my non-veggie eating relatives had seconds.  A tip about the 'runny' comments from others...I wasn't aware that you need to press out the water from the spinach...luckily my mom arrived early enough to save it from simple draining vs. pressing the water out using a colander.

This turned out a little runnier than i thought it would. However, i ended up using the leftover as sauce over some penne pasta and it was amazing!!!

This is very good. Since I live in the south, collards are more plentiful than spinach so went with collards and I had to use cream of mushroom because it was all I had. It still turned out great.  Served it over some fettucini. Will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I would make this again (and plan to for Thanksgiving in a few weeks).  My only change was to not use the entire container of French fried onions.  It seemed like a lot for the smaller casserole dish I used.  I used about half and I'm sure my husband will "snack" on the rest!
