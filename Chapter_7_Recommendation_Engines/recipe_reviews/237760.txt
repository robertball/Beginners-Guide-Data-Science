Delicious! I halved the dressing (I used dijon for the mustard since it didn't specify) and it was plenty for the salad. The only thing I think I'd do next time would be to reduce the sugar a bit, as we though tit was a little too sweet. Other than that, this was a great, simple combo of ingredients that I will be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Okay I cheated and used poppy seed dressing out of the bottle.  My Fam loves this.  Also as a special note - when in season I used Girl Scout Sea Salt Cracked Black Pepper Cashew.  Yummy.
