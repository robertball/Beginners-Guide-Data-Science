Made this recipe and cook time was perfect! I didnâ€™t have red pepper flakes but did have chili oil so used it instead. The flavors were great but I would double the amounts to enhance the flavors.

The only change I made was to add freshly grated Romano  cheese when they were done.   I'm not a fan of green beans.........until now.     Will also make a great healthy snack

Maybe it's my air fryer but the green beans NEVER cooked even when I doubled the time.  Awful!

Cooking time is way too long. Burned the first batch. Second batch done in 5 minutes total. Way better.

These are delicious. I didn,t have fresh garlic so used 1 tsp of the jarred garlic. I also cut up an onion and used the feft over marinade. Cooking right now in airfryer, expect they will be delicious too. My new fave way to do veggies.

I think my air fryer would hold the entire recipe in one batch.  Other that a little salt needed, it was great!  Great alternative to steamed green beans.
