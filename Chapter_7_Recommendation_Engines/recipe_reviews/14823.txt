Incredibly easy to make, very simple ingredients, and amazingly delicious! Who needs bagels? I could eat this stuff with a spoon!

I used reduced fat cream cheese. I whipped the cream cheese before folding in the crushed pineapple and diced strawberries. I spread this inside two pieces of bread and made stuffed french toast. After cooking, I sprinkled the french toast with powdered sugar. The kids thought this was great--they asked if we could have it again tomorrow.

Ugh.  I went back to the original recipe thinking I must have missed something with this simple combination, but I made it as stated and it simple was dull and tasteless.  I tried it again after it had been refridgerated overnight - no improvement.

I made this for a pot luck breakfast at college and it went over great!  We spread it on bagels and on toast :)  I think it would also be great done with peaches (chopped up) and strawberries!

This was good . I served it with ginger snaps and vanilla wafers.. The vanilla wafers were far better.

I used frozen strawberries and pureed in the food processor with pineapple.  You must make sure the cream cheese is completely soft before mixing or you will have lumps.  I served this with the hawaiian loaf recipe from this site.  Yum.

Excellent fresh tasting recipe! 

I doubled the recipe using one package fat free cream cheese and one regular. I used hand mixer to combine pineapple and creamcheese, then folded in the sliced strawberries. The only variation I made was adding 1/2 tsp vanilla to bump the flavor.  I had to stir it well to recombine liquid right before serving. Served with Vanilla Wafers and Cinnamon Bagel Chips. 

The sweetness is all natural and such a refreshing change from the sugar-laden store bought. I will never buy from the store again!

I pureed the strawberries with the cream cheese in the food processor, then stirred in the pineapple by hand, using only half the can. I used this as a bagel spread.  It could maybe be just  a little sweeter (like maybe a tablespoon or so of powdered sugar) but it's great as is, and pretty too, as it turned a pretty pink with flecks of the yellow pineapple.

It was pretty good but not as fruity tasting as I had hoped.  I added vanilla as another reviewer had done, also a packet of Splenda and a little bit of strawberry extract I had on hand.  It tasted better than the store-bought strawberry cream cheese!
