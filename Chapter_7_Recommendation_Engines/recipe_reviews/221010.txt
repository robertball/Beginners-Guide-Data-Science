This wasn't bad but it wasn't good, definitely different. I think the soy sauce is out of place in this and was throwing me off. If I made this again I would omit it. I did not add salt due to the soy sauce. I did like the zip from the red pepper. I think with tweaking this could be good.

The red pepper and the soy sauce were a little too much for my tastes.

In honor of The Masters, I made egg salad! I use this recipe and love it. I double up on the eggs because I like a more chunky egg salad.

We love this recipe! A great twist on plain egg salad. Mr Man even asked me for it to make himself.
