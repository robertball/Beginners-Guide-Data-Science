This was AWESOME!! Once everyone tried it I had to make more it was going fast. Only thing we modified when we added more was I added only a little bit (about 1/8 cup,just poured some in)of both sugars since some were saying it was a bit sweet & no more cinnamon sticks. I started with a double batch.

Delicious! After several comments of too sour, I added a bit more sugar. And, to the adult cups, I added a shot of spiced rum...yum!

Great recipe! This was so easy to make and it tasted fabulous. Not a drop was left over! I only made one substitution. I didn't have any cinnamon sticks on hand, so I put powdered cinnamon into a coffee filter, tied it off with twist-ties, and let that hang out in the punch while it brewed. It worked very well.

Loved this punch.  I've usually served hot apple cider for parties, but this was much better.  Just enough sweetness and tang.   I've been drinking the left overs cold but I prefer it hot.

This recipe is extremely easy but proves that simple can be delicious. I cut the recipe in half, but still had 1/4 cup of each sugar. This recipe made it into my book! I'll make it often in the winter.

Simple and delicious. I used cranberry grape juice to make it a bit sweeter. I put the leftovers in the refrigerator and heated it up one cup at a time.
