OH WOW! This is an incredible recipe! My husband about fell over it was so good! Ever have those meals where when it's over you could eat it all over again? Well, this is one! The only note that I would make is that I just used what I had on hand i.e. a white onion. Otherwise....no changes and delighted with the results! When a 1 year old, a 2 year old and a three year old will eat a meal....that's a winner in my book! Thanks for the recipe! A must make....and now a family fav! Awesome!!!!!

Must admit that I was skeptical about this recipe because it was so simple.  Sometimes simple is best. It turned out to be just outstanding--one of the best recipes I've discovered on this or any other site. I broiled the dish for a few minutes at the end. A handful of olives or some capers thrown in at the end would be good. It's great with greek salad and red wine.

Very good.  I made it pretty much as written, except that I used chicken thighs.  My husband and I both enjoyed the flavors.  I squeezed a little lemon on mine after cooking.

This is wonderful! I used onions, red potatoes, carrots, red peppers and Brussel sprouts for the veggies. I put the oven on broil the last few minutes to brown the chicken.

This was a fantastic dish! The only thing we changed was we used chicken thighs with skin. My husband made a bed of lemon slices, put the seasoned chicken on top and threw in diced red potatoes and fresh string beans! It was a quick dinner and healthy. The chicken came out perfectly juicy. Although we didn't really eat the skin on the chicken, it gave great moisture to the veggies! Really great and versatile dish.

This dish was very good and easy. I'd recommend boiling the potatoes for about 10 mins prior to putting in the baking dish. That way they will be cooked evenly by the time the chicken is fully cooked. I also set the broiler on to make the chicken look more appetizing.  I added feta cheese and cut the chicken so I could eat it in pita bread.

Very simple and tasty.  I used a large baking sheet instead of 9x13 to get more crispy edges on the veggies.

Oh So Good!!!!  Going to add my word of praise to all the other 5 star reviews.  What a delicious, healthy meal!  My hubby and I are watching our carbs these days so I substituted the potatoes for green beans and mushrooms that I had on hand.  Also after the 30 minutes I tasted it and decided it needed more lemon flavor, etc. so I drizzled more EVO, lemon juice over it.  Then sprinkled some Citrus Grill Seasoning from Durkee,  an All Herb Blend and a Mediterranean Sea Salt that I really like, over the top.  The flavor was phenomenal!!!!!  We kept dipping our chicken in the juices to mop up all that deliciousness!  Can't wait to try this on company.  Thanks joecraig for a great recipe!

The flavors are amazing! Especially the peppers, so I use two. The only change is to cut the potatoes into smaller cubes or they won’t be done by the time the chicken is. This makes a delicious sauce I think could be served over rice if you want to leave the potatoes out.

This was an extremely good recipe!  Loved it!  Watch your chicken carefully with the cooking time and temp, as written it will make the chicken dry.

Fantastic recipe! I made it as written but I did take the chicken out to rest while potatoes continued to cook. I should have cut them smaller as they were pretty big to begin with. I WILL be making this again so will do that next time, Thank you joecraig for this awesome recipe.  :)

I made it as the directions stated except that I added some capers to it. I cooked on a jelly roll pan at 375 on convection roast, and it cooked in approximately 20 minutes.

Very good marinade. I added zucchini to the mix, and the zucchini and onions were the high point. I also used skinless boneless chicken thighs, which I prefer in recipes like this. The chicken was unexceptional; next time I will either marinate the chicken or just use the marinade for vegetables.

So mine turned out dry in spite of my basting every 15min.  But flavor is awesome.  I did white sweet potatoes and mushrooms and added a bag of little frozen  shrimp.  It was a really good dish!

Great recipe. My family really enjoyed it. I do think I will use thighs next time as they are so much more tender and flavorful to me.

This just didn't come out well for me. I think maybe my 9x13 was just too deep or something. I'd try this again on a jelly roll pan so that everything can get roasty good. My chicken came out sort of poached-looking and so did all the veggies that were not right on top. Not my cup of tea. Husband ate it fine, though.

Big hit when I made this for my hosts while visiting friends. For me, I would have added two tsp of xxxthai chili to kick it up a notch, but with kids in the house, they enjoyed the milder version.

Trying to add photo. The only real change I made was fingerling potatoes instead of red potatoes (I didn't have red potatoes). It's a really delicious meal, I will be making again & again.

Overall we liked the blend of vegetables and chicken with lemon and oregano.  However, it found it a bit too lemony and the cook time for the chicken I believe is way off.  I cooked the vegetables for 40 min and added the boneless chicken for the last 20 min.  The chicken came out perfect -- registering 165 degrees and was plump and juicy.  You would only need to cook the chicken an hour if it was bone-in.  Next time, I will cut back on the lemon juice and leave lemon wedges on the table for anyone who wanted to make it more lemony.

So this is delicious. The mixture you out over the chicken is to die for. I did change a few things: 1) I split the chicken breasts so they were thinner, thus only had to cook for 30 minutes. I didn’t want the vegetables to over-cook. 2) potatoes are the devils food so I skipped the potatoes and made dill rice instead. YUM.

Really enjoyed this recipe. The flavor was awesome!!

Only changes I made and suggest:
1. Slice the potatoes on a mandolin to 1/4” thick for more even cooking. 
2. Sprinkle some crumbled feta cheese on the finished meal. 
3. Use bone in skin on chicken instead of boneless skinless chicken breast. Then remove skin and bones before serving. 
4. We used a larger shallower pan than was suggested and put the oven on broil the last couple minutes.

will NOT make it again!
There is something wrong with the instructions concerning either the oven temp. or the time for cooking!
Instructions say to cook at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, baste chicken with the juices, then continue baking for about another 30 minutes until the chicken temp. is 160 degrees.
after the first 30 minutes the chicken temp. was 165. I pulled out the chicken covered with foil, then continued cooking veg. for the remaining 30 minutes. The potatoes were still no done. I had to "nuke" the potatoes for another 3 minutes to get about 80% of the potatoes soft enough to say they were done!
the flavor was good, but the timing/temperature was incorrect!

I absolutely love this recipe! I went by the recipe to the "T", and it turned out beautifully.  The chicken was juicy and all the flavors flowed well together. I did brine my chicken breasts in a salt water mixture an hour ahead of time because I always do this with breasts to ensure avoiding dryness. I highly recommend trying this recipe!!

DELICIOUS! I used a fraction of the suggested garlic because I have someone sensitive to it at home, otherwise I made no changes. This chicken was juicy, lemony and succulent. It made a simple, healthy dinner for us the first night; I threw the leftovers into a pot pie that we LOVED. I will be making this again and again!

I made it exactly according to the recipe. I'd say the lemons and onions are for flavor, but not meant to be eaten as part of the medley. The chicken was moist and done according to schedule. The potatoes and peppers were scrumptious.

This came out AMAZING!!! I used a foil lined baking sheet and butterflied the chicken so it wasn't thick. It roasted perfectly and tasted divine. I added some green beans and cauliflower for extra veggies.

Good basic recipe.  Used carrots, onions and sweet potatoes with drumsticks(what was in my kitchen). Added extra lemon juice, oregano, oil, salt and garlic. Marinated the chicken for 30 minutes and then dumped it with the vegetables into a 13x9 glass pan   Roasted, covered with aluminum foil for 45 minutes. Turned up the heat to 425, took off the aluminum foil and cooked another 20 minutes. Everyone liked it. Will make it again.

I always try to make a new recipe “as is” to see how it turns out, so I made it exactly as written.  It was good, didn’t knock my socks off, but tasty. I would probably make it again, but not sure what I’d change!

This recipe was just OK for us. I think more garlic and lemon is needed as the chicken was leaning more on the bland side. Also, the potatoes took forever to cook. Definitely halve and then quarter the potatoes. I was surprised as I used a jelly roll pan to cook everything instead of the 9x13 baking dish (would take a lot longer to cook) in my experience at least. Just check the chicken and remove from pan when done to avoid overcooking. Overall, the recipe is pretty good, but needs some tweaks for our liking.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a big HELL YEAH!  I doubled the recipe using chicken thighs because they are so much juicier and the fat from the thighs helps with additional  savory flavor for the veggies.  I used rose blush potatoes (all I had) and both yellow & red bell pepper. Will absolutely make this again & again.  Perhaps I throw it all in the crock pot on my next ho round!

The flavor of the sauce was delicious, but the chicken was dry, and I even took it out 10 minutes earlier than suggested.  Next time I might try legs so the meat stays juicy, and I'll check it earlier.  I'll definitely make it again-- very healthy and full of flavor.

This was delicious. Only changes I made were to use a white onion,italian seasoning mix(didn't have straight oregano) and only used 2 chicken breasts cut in half which were pretty well covered by the veggies. Cooked for about 45 min...did check and baste frequently . Chicken was not dry at all. Very tender. Served with crusty baguette to sop up juices. Husband loved it. One of the few meals where there were no leftovers.

Good flavors, but my chicken was dry too.  I followed the recipe for two servings which worked out just fine.  I would also watch the coming times.  Maybe reduce by 10 minutes, Otherwise a great recipe.

My chicken was well done and dry before the hour was up so I would check temperature frequently.  The lemon dressing was good but would be better if it was used to marinate the chicken for a few hours.  Nice basic recipe but be sure to reduce and or watch cooking time.
