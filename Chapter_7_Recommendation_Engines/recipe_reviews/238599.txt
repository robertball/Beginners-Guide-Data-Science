I didn't have chile ancho so I used a Serrano pepper and added a clove of garlic and a handful of cilantro instead of just a teaspoon... also replaced the fish seasoning with kosher salt... it was bomb!

Perfect blend of flavors. The ground ancho chile pepper lends a mild heat and a sweet fruity flavor. I have also tried this with ground chipotle chile pepper for more heat and a smoky flavor. Either way this is a 5 star recipe.

The base of the sauce was very good and I didn't have dried ancho chile powder or the seafood seasoning... I used Goya adobo seasoning, garlic salt and a dash of sriracha sauce and it was very flavorful and added the kick we needed for our shrimp tacos!

I added more of everything.....more old bay,smoked chipotle, garlic, lime and salt trying to get more flavor. I ended up adding about a T of ketchup and that did the trick. Provided a much needed sweetness and brought the whole thing together nicely.

This added greatness to our fish taco night. We added green hot sauce to our tacos as well since this doesn’t add much heat. This made more than we needed for dinner so we’ve been using a thin layer on quesadillas all week.

Delicious baja sauce!  I used it for chicken tacos, so instead of the seafood seasoning, I doubled the ancho and added in a small amount of smoked chipotle powder.  The seafood seasoning would be excellent in it also when serving with fish.  I also added in some pepper and a touch of onion and garlic powder.  Thank you for the recipe!  The perfect addition to any taco recipe!

This is so good!  I made this exactly as is, minus the cilantro because my husband can't stand it.  I've also made this with Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and it is just as good.  This is our go to when we have fish tacos!

Made this to serve on Asian Tuna paddies. Loved the flavor it added. So easy to make and usually have all the ingredients on hand. Will definitely make again.

Adjusted by adding more lime juice due to we love lime.  Used Old Bay for seasoning.  turned out great!   Son even dipped other foods into the sauce, he loved it that much!

I was unsure of this recipe at first.  I didn’t really care for the taste by itself.  Once it was added to shrimp tacos with mango salsa, it was a a great addition.  I didn’t use the cilantro because the store I went to didn’t have any.  I doubt I’ll use it in the future.  Also I didn’t measure the lime, just squeezed a little in.

Used this sauce for fish tacos. It was good, but we would have liked it spicier. I skipped the cilantro and used 1/2 the Old Bay, to reduce the salt, and added chopped jalapeno. I substituted chipotle pepper for the ancho chile pepper to give it a little smoky flavor. Overall a nice sauce.

I will file this recipe away for future use as  we thoroughly enjoyed these tacos. I made one slight change to the recipe.  I love the taste of toasted, dried chiles. so I substituted freshly toasted and ground Guajillo chiles instead of the ground anchos.  I also used Seafood Magic as the seafood seasoning. Yum!

This was so very good. I had a little left over and put it on a breakfast burrito and it was even good on that. I will be making it a lot.

I loved this simple sauce. I did replace the sour cream with nonfat plain greek yogurt giving it a healthier twist... still a nice sauce for not only shrimp but grilled tuna!!

Delicious! Left out the ancho chili pepper. It was a little salty - I may have added a tsp of Old Bay.

This needed more lemon and seasoning and cilantro. All in all very tasty though.

Lack of ingredients in the house made us tweak this: subbed cilantro paste and some mild green chiles for the ancho pepper. Perfection with our fish tacos!

I made this for shrimp tacos, it was really good. Full disclosure, I mistakenly added more old bay  seasoning, so I increased the lime juice to offset. It was still delicious.
