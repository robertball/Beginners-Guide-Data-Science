I thought this was a slightly odd recipe but gave it a try because my hubba likes anything with a "rum raisin" combination. It's a very soft and moist cookie. I added vanilla and rum extract to give more flavour.

I added roughly another 2/3 - 3/4  cup flour. I soaked the raisins over night in 50 ml rum and and 25 ml rum extract. I used the left over liquid which wasnt much, as an extra flavoring. I did cook them at 375 and not 425. I made 3oz cookies, and they took about 20ish minutes. Cookies turned out great...my husband likes them alot.

First - I used 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup craisins and 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips.  I let the fruit soak overnight and saved the liquid which was a good idea b/c I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (that someone else suggested).  The reserve liquid was used to break up the brown sugar.  I also cooked agreed with the idea of cooking it at 375 for about 10-12 minutes. My personal name for these cookies is rum-a-licious cookies :)

So bland  :-( I tasted the batter & it was not good so I added ginger, vanilla, and cinnamon. I also thought it needed extra sugar. Even still they were not good. But I have never had a rum raisin cookie so maybe this is a good recipe & I don't like the cookies in general? Also, there is no baking soda or powder so the texture was weird.

This recipe provides a very dull flavor and a mildly greasy texture. I must agree with other reviewers, the recipe does not make the yield provided. It claims 3 dozen cookies, but in reality makes about 1 and a half dozen. 

This is a very easy recipe that is great for making with small children, and the subtle flavors are great for kids younger than four years old (since they are often sensitive to strong flavors), although my own principles force me to soak them with artificial rum flavor versus actual rum. 

All in all it's a good enough cookie.

These cookies turned out tasty but the recipe only yielded about 18 small cookies. I also added a little more flour than the original called for. I also soaked the raisins in spiced rum for a whole day. I cooked them at a lower temperature for longer in order to cook them through evenly.Take them out when the tops have really browned, then the middles will be nicely baked through.

Cookies were flat. Soaked the raisins for more than few hours and yet not much flavor. Added some vanilla for flavor. 
Definitely a soft cookie, at least the way mine turned out. Followed the recipe exactly.

4-6 mins seems to be too less.
had a hard to adjust the heat.
but maybe because i put the wrong portion, i put 2 tablespoons rather than one. 
it turned out to be very soft, bit like...not fully baked cookie.
maybe will give another shut.

I really should have read these reviews before making this.  It was not great.  I followed the recipe exactly but for some reason my first batched totally melted in the oven so I made some more with a little extra flower and this time they at least resembled cookies but were very very dry.
