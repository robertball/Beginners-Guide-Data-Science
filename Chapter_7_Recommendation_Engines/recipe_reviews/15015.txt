This is always a hit!! I use a can of crescent rolls - it's definitely the best way - just roll out the rolls - & follow the rest of the recipe - wrap the dough to cover the cheese & bake. its awesome. (Also, crumble some brown sugar over the egg wash befor baking.)

This is SO easy to prepare, but it looks impressive and tastes divine! Everybody will love it -- and you, for bringing it. A few changes: CHEESE - I always use brie wedges because they're more readily available than the circles. They work fine. Even though I don't LOVE the rind when I eat the cheese raw, I leave it on in this recipe and it all just tastes delicious when cooked. Also, the technique of freezing the brie before you cut it in half works splendidly. PRESERVES - Don't hold back. I use about half an 18 oz. jar per recipe and, like I said, it tastes SO good. ALMONDS - Yes! Add the shaved almonds in between the sandwiched halves of brie and preserves. You'll love it! TEMPERATURE - 400* F works well for me.

Everyone raved about this! I cut my brie in half and placed the preserves on the cut side. I made one with peach preserves, and one with 1/4 cup walnuts toasted in a tablespoon of butter and a tsp. of cinnamon then mixed with 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I rolled the puff pastry out with a rolling pin to stretch the dough for the two halves.Just be sure to seal the edges of the puff pastry well.I didn't brush it with egg and it was fine. You could use any kind of preserves and it would be fantastic. It went so fast,I should have made two more!

Loved, loved, loved this simple and elegant recipe!  I actually used a 13 oz round of brie, and had plenty of pastry to cover.  I was a little concerned about cutting the soft cheese in half, so I put it in the freezer while my pastry sheet was thawing.  Cut beautifully.  I used raspberry preserves, made beautiful pastry leaves and berries for the top, and served on a cake platter with fresh raspberries around. Wonderful!  This would be terrific for the holidays.  Thanks so much for sharing! Addendum 12/28/08: please note, I place the brie in the freezer only 30 minutes, I do not freeze it, just give it a good chill to set it up for easy slicing!  Hope this helps clarify, Wendy

This is by far the best appetizer recipe I've ever made and it turned out perfect!  I made this for our wine club and people raved about it.  I used a 19 oz. wheel of Bire and 6 Tbl preserves.  To help keep the preserves from leaking out the sides, I scooped out a small amount of the brie from the center of one side and filled with the preserves. I also used two sheets of puff pastry using the egg white as glue between the sheets.  It looked beautiful and thanks to all the egg white - no leakage.

I made this for Christmas Eve.  I used philo dough because that is what I  accidentally bought instead of puffed pastry.  I used 7 sheets and brushed each sheet VERY LIGHTLY with melted butter.  I baked in a little hotter oven (400 deg) for only 20 minutes.  Also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top before baking.  It was delicous!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thank you, Susan!

This is a very good brie recipe.  Some advice, make sure you bake it on a pan that has sides, so that if the pastry brakes open, the oils from the cheese don't melt all over your oven (speaking from experience).  2 of the 3 times I have made it the pasty has broken open while baking, which makes it messy, but it is still worth making!  It is a very yummy mix.  I have received many complements on it.  I think next time I will try using half a wheel of brie, so the pasty wraps around the whole thing and I can wrap it a little more loosely so that maybe it won't break!  Good luck and Bon Appetite!

Very good idea with the perserves we used a sugar free strawberry from Polaner. We generally make brie and serve an adriatc fig spread on the side so this was a nice deviation from the normal.  To keep the brie from leaking you need to brush each fold you make with the pastry dough with egg, egg acts as glue and fuses your pastry dough together which the recipe does not tell you to do.

This is incredible.  I used a generous amount of preserves, added blanched almonds and substituted crescent roll dough for the puff pastry.  My family and friends loved it.  As a matter of fact, my husband didn't even get to taste it because the kids polished it off.  This is definately a keeper.

Simply magnificent! Couldn't be easier to prepare. My guests absolutely loved it! Can be an appetizer or a dessert - either way, for the amount of effort it took, this was a big, big winner!

I used 2 sheets of filo - the first with the tuck on the top, the second on the bottom. One sheet alone appeared to be too thin/flimsy.

The advice to use a pan with sides to prevent leaking is an excellent idea. While baking I had to pull mine out too scoop up around the sides so it wouldn't flow off the baking sheet.

I just had a few friends for wine and cheese tonight. They were in Awe of this recipe. They could not believe that Martha Stewart herself had not personal dropped this off. I had put the brie in the Freezer for 30 min. Then It sliced in half perfectly. Made it with jalapeno jelly, then on top of the jellyI put dried cranberries rehydrated first and sliced roasted almonds. Tnen used Phyllo dough to wrap it. I first layed the brie on top of 3 sheets of phyllo dough and wrapped the dough up the sides then layed 3 more sheets on top and wrapped the dough down the sides so that the whole brie was now all covered up.I did the egg wash over the whole thing then topped with more of the cranberries and almonds. Baked it at 350 for 30 min. it got a beautiful golden brown. It held its shape beautiful. The phyllo dough turned out very buttery and flaky.  I used a large brie round    19.6 oz. Not much was left, but what was left, my guests wanted to take home. I will ABSOLUTELY make this again !!

Silly Question? Do you cut off the rind before putting it in the pastry ? I would think so, but it wasn't mentioned in the recipe.

I would give this 10 stars!  So good!  Leave the rind on the Brie.  Doubled the amount of apricot preserves, sprinkled sliced almonds in the middle, and used crescent rolls to wrap it up.  Served with apple slices.  My guests loved it!  Very delicious and easy!!!

When Googling this recipe I found varying oven temps and times. I settled on 400 degrees for 25 mins and it came out perfectly brown. I let it sit for about 15 mins and dived in! It was delicious!

Pillsbury makes a non-perforated crescent sheet that works wonderfully to cover the brie. Bake at the same time that the recipe calls for. After the first time, I cut it into quarters to put more preserves in it because it didn't seem like there was enough. If you skip the egg white at the end, it will expand more than you realize. I have found spraying a pan, putting down foil, and spraying the foil before putting the brie down helps reduce residue on the pan. Also, the recipe does not state to remove the rind off of the brie!  This is an excellent recipe for parties. Everyone wants you to bring it again!

Love it!  Just like everyone else has said, this tastes amazing!  I used the non perforated crescent rolls and several spoon fulls of apricot.  I cut the dough in half.  I used one half on the bottom and draped the other half across the top of the brie.  I smashed all of it together and bunched it on the top.  Unlike the recipe says, to put the seam on the bottom, I felt it worked better to keep the seam on the top. I brushed all of the dough liberally with egg white and I had no leakage. It turned out perfect.

Excellent!! My first try was wonderful!  I wasn't serving a particularly large group, so I took two brie wedges and placed them side by side to create a rectangle.  I did not have to chill the brie and was able to cut it as it was.  I used unperforated crescent dough and raspberry preserves.  I did not oil the pyrex dish in which I cooked it enough and had a hard time getting it out of the pan.  Also, use the preserves generously.  I thought I did when I made it, but it wasn't enough.  But, overall, wonderful, SUPER EASY recipe.

Fabulous! I used a large Brie wheel and a can of crescent rolls.  Brushed egg whites between pieces to keep them from pulling apart.  Used apricot preserves and walnuts....so good, served for app on Thanksgiving and everyone raved.  Definately recommend putting cheese in freezer for 30 mins to make cutting easier

Brought this to a party.  Everyone loved it! Took about 3 minutes to put together then just pop in the oven.  I used 16 oz wheel of Brie cheese, about 4 to 5 tablespoons of apricot preserves.  Only used 1 sheet of frozen puff pastry (1/2 package) worked perfect even though it was a larger wheel of cheese.

LOVE brie cheese. I have made this recipe so many times and change it a little every time I make it. I have used many kinds of preserves and nuts. One favorite is apple butter on top of the cheese, wrap, seal, the top with 1/2 c. honey and crushed walnuts. Bake and enjoy. Sinful and great with white wine.

So easy and delisious. I used this for a Mother's day appetizer and used the rolled out cresent rolls for the crust. The crust was thick, which I thought it should have been thinner at first but when eating it turned out great as you use the thick crust and the dipper. I also served with sliced apples. Great recipe which you can change up however you want.

So easy and so delicious!  Definitely a hit!  I used raspberry preserves this time; I'll certainly keep rotating fruit fillings.  Thanks!

I used rasberry preserves..this was great..I made a ton of apps and this one was completely gone. Everyone raved about it. Served with fruit..cut up apples, strawberrys..etc. Edit: Next time I made it I did cut the brie in half to add the preserves..the brie melted all out of the pastry. I went back to adding preserved to top and bottom..this works best.

This is so simple to make yet tastes delicious.  My husband accidentally picked up a wedge of brie cheese instead of the wheel, but it still worked fine with 1 puff pastry sheet folded over it.  I left the rind on the brie,  brushed all the places where the puff pastry sealed up with egg white and baked it in an 8x8 Pyrex container.  I slathered on the Apricot preserves without measuring it and only a tiny bit leaked out.  Although it says to serve immediately, I wonder if letting it set might not be better so the cheese doesn't ooze out like liquid since it's so hot.  I enjoyed the leftovers more, maybe because the cheese wasn't oozing.  I cut off just enough to eat and microwaved it on high for 30 seconds.  My husband tried it this way and thought it was delicious. I didn't need to have crackers with it, the puff pastry was enough.

The taste was good, but I must've overcooked. Mine had a very flat shape and was visually unappealing.

I also love this recipe!  My recommendation is to use several sheets of philo pastry to wrap the brie (prevents leakage and also forms an attractive, tasty crust.  Also, as an alternate centre filling, garlic and sundried tomatoes works well.

Great fancy yet simple treat to take to a party. You will get many 'wow's when you bring this dish.  Trust me, remove the rind. If not, it has a vague nasty aftertaste. Go all out and use extra preserves, almonds etc.  Make sure you seal the pastry well.  If it leaks, the cheese melts out and it looks messy.

So easy and so good! I used pear instead though, just cut up little pieces (maybe dime sized) of fresh pear and piled it on top of the brie, then covered it in pastry. UHMAZING!

Wow!!! I could have eaten the entire appetizer by myself. It was amazing! 
I used crescent rolls (so easy) for my wrapping. The egg wash really helped hold everything together. And I followed the advice of one reviewer who put the brie in the freezer for a half hour before slicing in half. 
Such an easy appetizer that looks and tastes like it takes a lot of work! :)

A really impressive and delicious appetizer for parties.  I used 1/2 Pillsbury French Dough loaf instead of puff pastry (because that's what I had in the fridge).  Turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks Susan!

A hit! Very tasty and easy to make! I chose to use blood orange marmalade (about 5 tablespoons) in between the slices of brie and topped with sliced almonds. I rolled the puff pastry out so that it would be large enough to completely cover the brie. I cut off extra lengths of dough to make a beautiful topper. Brushed with egg white and it was beautiful AND delicious! * I do recommend baking it on a cookie sheet, as some of the filling can leak out if the seams aren't sealed completely. Then transfer to a nice serving dish surrounded by crackers..

It was pretty good! I have no idea why you would freeze the cheese though - it is easy to get it into two circles. If you go the crescent roll route, you can buy dough in a can without any perforation marks on it. But make sure you put the seam on top and seal it with egg white - I sealed mine on the bottom and there was gooey dough on the bottom with all the seams and excess. So next time I will be wiser! :)

Easy and delicious appetizer.  I covered the sliced brie with pineapple/apricot marmalade and toasted almonds.  For finishing touch I cut out stars from the corners of the pastry sheet to decorate the top, sprinkled with more toasted almonds and served with Ritz Crackers.  I also baked at 400 for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly browned.

This is a delightful way to serve brie cheese.  I have prepared it many times, and even the skeptics enjoy it.  Easy to make, sounds fancy....I never have left overs.  Wheat Thins seem to be the best to eat with this from all the times I have served this.

This recipe is definitely good. I used a Pillsbury French Loaf and it was okay, though mine also leaked all over the pan too. I'm not sure what to do to stop the leaking, but my guests enjoyed it. I didn't know how much my husband liked it until he asked where the leftovers went. I will work with this recipe until I figure it out. BTW, my grandmother used to make monterey jack cheese and apricot jam sandwiches for me as a kid so I already love the combination of cheese and apricot. Also, maybe I'm uninformed, but do people normally prepare this with the rind or not? I peeled it off.

This recipe has earned a place of honor on my
Christmas buffet table!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and it was a huge success.  I even
found myself wishing I could hang around the Brie as everyone else seemed to be doing!  Thank you 
for the recipe, Susan!

So good, so easy and so impressive! I made exactly as stated, only used a bit more preserves (used Bonne Maman - yum). I also added slivered almonds to the top and sides - just brushed on along with the egg whites with pastry brush. Super yummy. I served with crackers and apples. Next time I will skip the crackers as this was best with apples in my opinion.

I agree, this is so easy to make and impressed my partygoers. I used crescent rolls, since I don't know how puff pastry works. Pinched the seams together, wrapped it around and cut off the extra sheet stuff on the sides and used it to make the cute leaves as in the picture. It was really wonderful. I loved that it took 10 minutes to make! I used the freezer tip of freezing the cheese 30 minutes and it cut like a dream.

I KNOW this recipe is amazing! But I managed to royally screw it up and need some help :( So I followed the directions exactly EXCEPT I used two sheets of puff pastry. I had it in the oven FOREVER and it never cooked both sheets. The outside was crisp and the inner layer mushy and doughy. And i used too big of a brie wheel. When i took out of the oven, it still tasted great on parts that were done but I could not serve it like that. I really want to make this again and am mad at myself lol!  Thanks for the great idea, I hope that I get to actually serve it soon!

This was delicious! I missed the tip to freeze/chill the cheese first so the cheese doesn't run out of the dough. I used a pepper jelly and it was great! Good the next day too! I made it for Valentine's Day and cut hearts out of the corners of the dough to put on top.

Delicious and sooo easy -use more preserves than called for though. I have also used jalepeno jelly (it is green for Christmas!) instead of apricot  and it was so incredibly good. It was not hot or spicy -it tasted sweet and paired nicely with the brie.

Wonderful!  This was extremely easy and fast (the hardest part is cutting off the rind), and everyone LOVED it!  I used a 15 oz. wheel of Brie, filled it with strawberry-rhubarb jam, and covered it with crescent rolls.  Although some leaked out of the bottom, once I transferred it from the cookie sheet to the serving dish, it looked perfect!  This was a huge hit at my party and I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe is to die for, if you like brie.  I used crescent rolls, and added sliced almonds inside with the apricot preserve.  I served with crackers and granny smith apples.  Yum!!

GREAT flavor. Very easy. EVERYONE was impressed, even though they saw how simple it was to prepare! It was a hit! Use as much preserves as you want--the only recommendation I have is to make sure the pastry is sealed tightly around it so you don't have leaks. ENJOY!

This is the first time I've ever tried to make anything with Brie cheese, and it'll probably be the last. I followed the recipe to the letter, and mine turned out very salty and bitter. It was so bitter that we couldn't eat it. The whole thing had to go in the garbage.

I have made this recipe with the fruit preserves in the center and it's fantastic. But when I'm in the mood for savory I brush the inside of the dough with melted butter and sprinkle with granulated garlic (instant garlic bread) then put Zesty Red Onion Preserves (Ball's Blue Book) in the center. Talk about wonderful! There is just enough sweetness in the preserves yet it's still considered savory. Serve with garlic crostini. Let it cool down a bit before cutting so it doesn't run out all over your platter.

If you love cheese - this is so good.  Excellent recipe and so easy.  I use the large wheel and both crusts - one on the bottom and then one on top and pinch both crusts together.

SOOO good.  SOOO easy.  The perfect appetizer!  I made it with apricot preserves and added shaved almonds both in between the brie slices and on top of the pastry.  Everyone at our get together LOVED this!  The best part is - it looks as though you spent so much time making it, and it really only takes a few minutes to put everything together!!  Thank you for this delicious and sophisticated appetizer!!

This is one of the tastiest things I've ever had.  I pretty much followed to recipe exactly, but I did way more preserves to suit our tastes.  There is no reason to freeze the brie before cutting it in half.  It cuts just fine.  Also, be very careful not to cook it too long.  The consistency of the brie will change and it will become gelatinous.  Love this!!!

I made this as an appetizer when we had some friends over and it was a huge hit!  I served it with Ritz crackers and everyone raved about it.  Just a few suggestions:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE ADVICE TO FREEZE THE BRIE!  I did this and I couldn't have cut it straight if my life depended on it.  It is much easier to cut just plain cold from the frig!  Also, I couldn't find a Brie wheel at the store, so I had to buy a wedge.  If using a wedge of Brie all you have to do is cut it in half (not length wise, but like you are cutting the narrow end off a triangle) and put the halves side by side in the pastry to make it like a square of brie.  That makes it easy to fold up inside the pastry if using a wedge.

I have been making a baked brie appetizer for years but when I saw this twist on the old favorite I had to try it.  What a brilliant idea to add the preserves to the middle of the cheese!  Less mess and a lovely presentation.  I have made it exactly as written 3 times already over the holidays this year and it is always a crowd favorite. Only problem is there are NEVER any leftovers!   Thank you so much for posting!!

This is excellent!  I make it with different fillings.  The apricot preserves is great.  You can also use caramelized onions with a bit of sage.  Another great option is dried tomatoes and pesto.

For a more savory filling:  Thinly slice 4 medium yellow onions (mandolines work great) and slowly saute with 1 Tbsp butter until carmelized (takes about 45 min).  Stir in your apricot preserves and about 1 tsp salt.  Cook slowly until well combined and flavors blend.  Follow rest of recipe (or you can pile the onions on top of a brie wheel and bake at 350 until gooey and bubbly if you want to skip the puff pastry.  Serve with wheat thins.)

We had this for our Thanksgiving appetizer. I used about 6 sheets of Filo instead of puff pastry. It was a huge hit. Next time instead of apricot preserves I will try something savory for the filling--this is more of a dessert than an appetizer.

Made this recently and everyone gobbled it up! I added the shaved almonds per other reviews. It's best when it cools down and is almost room temperature. At that point you can really taste the wonderful flavors. Great recipe!

My guests loved this!  I bought a wedge instead of a round cheese and cut it in half to form a rectangle.  This worked out great and was easier to wrap with the pastry.  I would liberally butter the cookie sheet as I had a hard time removing it without breaking through the puff pastry.  I also trimmed off the excess rind on my brie.  The combination of the apricot preserves and cheese had an incredible flavor.  I would definitely make this again.

Very yummy and gooey! I added more preserves than it suggested, cause I really wanted the flavor. I also added some preserves on the top and sides of the brie before wrapping it up. YUMMY! Guests loved it!

If you love brie, you'll love this. I sprinkled sliced almonds over the preserves, which gave a nice variation of textures and added flavors. Chopped green onion (1 tbsp) also adds some zing.

I made this with pepper jelly, and it was awesome. I've been wanting to make it with the pepper jelly but was afraid to ruin the brie. It's the only way I'll serve it now. It was a big hit!! I also baked it in a round dish so whatever leaked out was absorbed by the dough and, it didn't look so messy.

I have had this recipe for awhile and was very dissappointed in it.  It might be my fault- I took the suggestion of other reviews and used crescent dough and made individual appetizers.   That is all I changed but it still didn't turn out as I expected.  It was salty and more bitter than I wanted.  I think mine needed more preserves.  However, it gave me other ideas.  Rolling the crescent dough with just the preserves (of any flavor) would be great I think.  All in all, it needs some changes but was a good idea.

Yummy and easy.  I used peach preserves instead of the apricot and crescent rolls instead of the puff pastry. This is going to be a weekly treat for the family.

These were a huge hit at my New Year's Eve party.  They were the first appetizers to go, and everyone asked for the recipe.  As a footnote, these taste awesome when paired with red wine!

Per the recommendations of other reviewers, used Pilsbury crescent roll dough to wrap the brie.  Had gotten an almost 20 oz. brie, due to several people being over, but we were also having dinner, so that size was far too much food and it didn't all get eaten...but I have to say I got lots of oohs and aahs over it, it had a lovely presentation, and it was very luscious.  Great party food.  Hopefully I can salvage the leftovers!

This is truly a crowd pleaser.  I put very generous amount of apricot preserves in it, and it came out wonderful.  Hard to stop eating!

Flavor was delish.  I used 1 can of crescent rolls for the dough and apple jelly instead of apricot preserves, since we had it on hand.

This was wonderful. I followed another rater's comment of freezing the cheese before cutting it and that was not successful, I think you have to thaw it for a bit if you choose to freeze it. It was way to hard to cut into. so I put the perserves on top of the brie and continued with the directions. I will definately try in again with the perserves sandwiched but it was great on top too.

This recipe has gotten me more accolades from friends and family than any other that I have in my collection.  It is an incredible dish for wine and cheese parties. The fruit cheese and pastry really brings out the flavors of white and medium body reds.

Have made this several times and it's AWESOME!!  I always use extra apricot preserves and add sliced almonds, and top with the brown sugar (over the egg whites). Serve alone or with crackers.  So tasty!

FANTASTIC.  Made it for an appetizer on Thanksgiving Day ~ was gone in a flash!!  Do not need to serve crackers with it as it needs nothing to enhance flavor/taste.  People asked for recipe!! You cannot fail with this appetizer ~ it's easy!!  I purchased package of puff pastry (contains two sheets) in the frozen foods section of grocery!!

This is great!  The way I make it is with pie crust.  I use 1 wall of brie, and 12oz preserves.  Cut the brie in small cubes, place in pie crust, pour preserves over. Top with pie crust.  Bake @ 400 for 25 minutes, serve with crackers.

Great method.  I opted for a hot red pepper jelly but followed the instructions.  This turned out great.  I used a large wheel of brie and the entire package of puff pastry.  Fantastic way to do it!

Just served this at a girl's night dinner party tonight.  It was a huge hit.  I ran upstairs to visit other guests and came back and it was gone...I only got a small piece.  But it was delicious.  I used phyllo dough and an entire can of apricot preserves.  The preserves helped with the strength of the Brie.  I'll be making it again for Christmas.  It's officially become by 'go to' potluck dish.  The prep time was well under 10 minutes.

The 8 ounce wheel of Brie I found was too large for the largest sheets of puff pastry I could find (and I have a lot of nice groceries in a metro area).  Since I was concerned about sealing multiple sheets of puff pastry without the cheese running out, I decided to try other reviewers suggestions of crescent roll dough.  We loved the taste of the brie and apricot preserves, but weren't fond of the dough which seemed heavy for what was inside.  Another time perhaps we'll try doing half wheels of brie since they might fit inside the puff pastry sheets.

Who would have thought how good this would be??  Messy to cut into but it didn't matter!!  My family was scooping up all the overflow with a spoon.  I'm not a brie lover and think I might like this better with a different type of cheese, but when I brought that up my entire family screamed out, "NO!"  So there you have it.  It's perfect as it is!

My Guests liked it.  I wasn't so keen on it.  Most of the Apricot leaked out in the baking process.  I'm tempted to try this with roasted garlic puree in the middle next time instead of the preserves.

I am always looking for new ways to and prepare Brie Cheese( it is my absolute favorite!!!!!)I used another person suggestion in the reviews and used crescent rolls instead of the puff pastry, used apple butter for the filling and after putting egg wash on the outside I topped it with honey. THIS ONE OF THE BEST CHEESE APPETIZER RECIPES THAT I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!! I did have a little bit of leakage, but end result was still terrific. thank you so much for this recipe I will be using it time and time again!!!!!!

Thanks for a great appetizer.  Followed the advice of another review that said to freeze the cheese before cutting and to use both sheets of puff pastry.  I cut off the rind. Although edible, I don't prefer to eat it.  I used raspberry preserves and a 15 oz. wheel.  I had to pinch the pastry seams well and use a rolling pin to make it stretch to cover the wheel.  I covered it once and brushed the entire thing w/ egg white.  Wrapped the second piece the opposite way and just made a 'pinch' at the top.  Also covered that w/ egg white.  I did bake it longer, probably about 45 minutes and waited about 10 minutes before cutting. Baked in a buttered casserole, but could have used a cookie sheet because there was absolutely no leaking w/ both sheets of pastry.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a little hard to eat.  I had to pass out forks, but everyone loved it.  Thanks again!

Absolutely wonderful - A great appetizer everyone will enjoy.  Froze cheese overnight, sliced in half and topped with orange marmalade (apricot preserves work great also), dried cranberries soaked in water (this plumps them up) and toasted almonds.  Wrapped it up in the pastry and baked 40 minutes at 350.  Served with thinly sliced bagette bread.  A definate keeper!

Like others, I added alot more apricot preserves AND added blue cheese.  It was the hit of the party! Even those that said they didn't like blue cheese, loved it.

Tasted delicious but was quite gooey and messy.  I thought the pastry would carry on it's own, but I ended up needing to serve with crackers.  Lots of compliments.

I'm giving this recipe a two because while the taste was good, there were a few things wrong with my finished product. The directions don't say anything about what to do with the rind, neither did any of the reviews (I left mine on). The directions did say to serve immediately, but when I cut into mine, the filling just oozed out all over the plate. The puff pastry was chewy, and the whole thing was kind of oily. I wrapped it up and put it in the fridge and will try it again when it is cool. With the price of brie, I just don't think I would risk making this again.

I made this with homemade Strawberry Jam for a party and it went really fast.  Several people commented that they loved it.  Unfortunately 2 other people brought a brie appetizer to this party, so I was really "bried out" by the end.  I rated 4 instead of 5 because the brie was swimming in grease when I pulled it out of the oven.  I'll try it again with a few modifications.

This is a wonderful and elegant appetizer.  I made it for a Christmas party and people thought I went to so much trouble.  I used the herbed cheese which I thought would be nice.  It really complemented the Brie.  Will serve this dish again.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I never tasted it since my guests ate the whole thing before I made it over to the table.  So I guess that means it is really, really good!

I LOVE this appetizer. I make it all the time and when I make it, I load up on the apricot preserves, very thickly coating the brie. Also, slivered almonds taste wonderful when added on top of the preserves (inside the pastry). 
A NOTE: Make sure you give this time to cool of the whole thing will pour out of the pastry. Also, I serve this on water crackers (and recently, apples as well). Guys never seem to like it much but all the women LOVE it (no meat?)

Just made this over the weekend for a Christmas Party and already had to email the recipe to 4 people.  It was a huge hit.  I made exactly as written, but used Raspberry preserves instead.

First of all, DO NOT forget that egg white wash it will change everything for you. I was not crazy about the recipe the first time around, but it seemed like everyone else really liked it (hence the four stars). Next time, I will definitely be trying a different flavor with the brie, possibly a cranberry filling

This was gobbled up fast!  I added toasted almond and pecans on top of the jam layer and on top of the entire thing, and while it was good, I think this recipe is perfect as written too.  I think it does look pretty with pecans on top though!

Let me stress that this is not the fault of the submitter of the recipe!!!

This was relatively easy to put together, even though I made homemade puff pastry since I didn't have any on hand.

This was tastey, just incredibly greasy, though.  So much so that I couldn't eat more than a bite, then I felt ill the rest of the evening from the grease of the cheese.  Having never had brie before, though, I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not going to make this again (though, let me stress, it was tastey).  I think I'll stick to my regular cheddar cheese ball w/ strawberry preserves.  Thanks, though, for a good tasting recipe, even if it's not for me.

I love this recipe!  I have had it many ways too.  If you are having Italian food you can just use the brie and sprinle some italiam seasonings on it before you wrap it.  For abreakfast pastry just use the brie and sprinkle it with brown sugar and pecans before closind thwe wrap!  Different types of preserves are good too, like jalepeno jelly!  Go crazy and try something new!

I bought the pastry shells instead of pastry sheets, so I ended up using 2 shells to create a big bundle of brie cheese & apricot preserves. The result was still great! My family loved it! Thank you for such a wonderful & easy recipe!

I had never tried Brie before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I forgot to brush the egg white on, but it turned out fine without it.  I think that I may try cream cheese next time to make it more  dessert than appetizer.

I read the reviews and also checked another recipe and made the following changes: I froze the brie for about 30 minutes to make slicing easier. I toasted the slivered almonds and put them between the brie halves with the apricot preserves. 
I used a parchment lined baking sheet and bathed the top and sides in an egg wash. I also baked the brie at 425 degrees for 20 minutes. It came out golden brown, the pastry was crispy all over and the cheese was just warm enough to be slightly melted in the center. The flavor was wonderful! 
I think the higher baking temperature is key as the pastry needs to be browned but the cheese needs to be warm but not completely melted. Also, the egg wash is extremely important to achieve browning and letting the brie stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
I'll make this again with cherry preserves and walnuts!

Fantastic appetizer and it was loved by all. I used raspberry preserves, but I've had it with apricot preserves and it's just as good!

First time ever making baked Brie and it's delicious; I substituted raspberry preserves and accented with fresh raspberries when served. This was a big hit and so easy!

If you do this right it is elegant and delicious!  I substituted honey for the jelly and add blackberries and raspberries.  You really need to use the puff pastries for it to taste and look right...all flaky and scrumptious. -Deb

I will serve this at every party- what a hit!  I used sliced almonds between 7 Tbsp of apricot preserves...a party in your mouth!  Just make sure you pinch the puff pastry well, or you'll have leaks.

I've made this twice now. Once with the apricot preserves & once with peach preserves. I also use way more than 3 Tablespoons, probably more like 6 Tablespoons, so I have enough to cover the wheel. I've only had to use one puff pastry sheet each time and I added toasted slivered almonds to the top to make it look nicer. Good stuff.

Been making this for years. So easy to do and has always been a bit hit at parties. I follow the recipe exactly except i may change out the preserves flavor once in a while. I serve with a french baguette and sliced granny smith apples.

So easy and delicious!  Everyone loved it.  The egg whites didn't seem to provide a golden color so I tried brushing it with butter the second time making it.  It was perfect.   I also folded the pastry in a pinwheel fashion and placed a cut out star at the top with a cookie cutter instead of flipping it upside down.  Oerfect size for twelve guests when served with other appetizers.

I'm no regular in the kitchen, and to be honest, this treat intimidated me a little because I was used to just the typical basic garlic and Brie melt method (tons of garlic of course!). But my nephew hates garlic, says it burns his mouth, and so I gave this a shot. Result: Delicious! Presents sooooo amazingly too, easy way to impress guests. After it all was done, had to wonder what was so scary, just takes a little bit extra for a whole lot of WOW...

This was a big hit.  I used raspberry preserves and threw a handful of sliced almonds on top for the last few minutes it was baking.  I will definitely make this again.

I have been making this for get togethers for every. It is always a big hit. I use more than 3 TBS of apricot and never brush the top with egg white because I am lazy. It is so yum. I have also made this with SEEDLESS raspberry jam, also very good but I always go back to the apricot. Serve with French bread or a high quality cracker such as table water. Also I always make and serve this in a Pyrex pie plate for ease, again I am lazy.

This was a big hit at a candy making party that I had.  I put blackberry preserves in the middle, but kept the rest the same.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

I also used raspberry preserves - my favorite.  The preserves sorta leaped out of the cheese and seeped into the dough and was absorbed.  I served it with warmed preserves for dipping and that returned us to super yummy.  I don't know if that would have happened with the original apricot, which aren't as runny as berry preserves.

My guests and I never had Brie and did not know what to expect.    All 15 and myself waited for it to come out of the oven then dived in and wished I had bought more brie to make another.    It was delightful to say the least.    I can't wait to make it again using different flavor of preserves.     Yummy!

This is amazing!!  My new favorite appetizer for parties!  Everybody loves it!  I put a few sliced almonds on top of the preserves before I sandwich it together for some crunch, but otherwise I follow the recipe!  This made me a star at the last get-together!  Thanks!!

I'm not big on mixing my sweet with my savory, however, I must admit that this was not only delicious but elegant too. The slight sweetness of the preserves offsets and certainly compliments the strong taste of the brie. Wonderful Susan!

The best! I served it for an appetizer party with girlfriends and they even licked the plate it was so good. I also added apricot preserves to the top of the brie, and the next time I used almond slivers in the middle as well.

Had trouble getting the dough to seal so the insides don't spill out, but it was still a hit at my party.  Everyone loved it!  The taste was great.  My only recommendation, serve it within 5-10 minutes after pulling from the oven.  As soon as it cools off, it's not as good.

I probably should have paid more attention to the puff pastry wrapping - I had a bit of a (VERY tasty) brie-splosion and a bit of a mess.  A very delicious mess to be sure though.

I loved the idea of apricot with the warm brie and the tips from reviewers were so helpful in reducing the intimidation of doing something so fancy without anyone to show me.   I did roll my pastry sheet out a bit on a floured surface.  Using the cardboard container from my cheese, I lightly pressed it into an area leaving enough room to wrap pastry generously all around the cheese.  Used a few small star cookie cutters in the excess pastry to put on top.  I used a whole beaten egg, not just the white and did freeze the cheese for about 30 min and it sliced very easily.  Added the preserves and some toasted almonds in between both rounds, leaving the rind on, but I added some preserves and almonds into the lightly marked circle I made on the pastry.  I put the cheese round on top of that and loosely folded the pastry around it as cheese expands as it bakes.  Generously used the egg at the seams, then all over.  Added my stars and added more egg over them.  The pastry dough box recommended 400 degrees for 20-25 min.  I used that temp and in 20 min it looked dark golden and puffy.  I truly regret that with my guests arriving early I did not take a photo before serving.  My suggestion to those who thought the cheese too runny is to disregard the "Serve Immediately".  The cheese is really very hot and needs to set up a bit.  I let mine cool for about 20 min.  It was warm and gooey, but didn't run all over the plate.  While there are several steps in making this, none of them is h

Went the savory route, added finely chopped mushroom and spinach.  My husband and boys nearly fought for the last bite. It was gone in minutes. :))) Success! Thanksgiving day appetizer. I'm adding a photo.

I made this for a party recently and it got rave reviews (although I had leftovers...hmmmm).  Super easy to put together and it's an impressive looking appetizer.  I used more than a few tablespoons of the preserves based on reviews I read.  Next time I will use a stronger flavor for preserves, like maybe raspberry?   Also I will remove the coating from the edge and top of the brie.  The recipe doesn't say to remove it but I didn't like the flavor it added.

Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.  It was a big hit at Christmas Eve dinner. I read other reviews and follow these tips:

- put cheese in the freezer 30 minutes before cutting.
- use one can of crescent rolls, roll out & baste with beaten egg white.  Wrap the dough over cheese wheel.  Brush with egg white and sprinkle with brown sugar.

It looks beautiful.  I put some more jam on the side of the dish after baking since I didn't taste much of jam in the middle.

Super easy. And delicious. Disappeared. Everyone thought it was elegant, and difficult. Might put more preserves under the Brie on the sealed side.

Always a hit!  I add more preserves than directed. I also add brown sugar and chopped walnuts to the inside. I use filo sheets and brush each layer with butter as I wrap it. Always delicious!

I am not fond of the rind that is on Brie. So I shaved it off with a potato peeler. WOW what a difference it made to the taste. I could really taste the cheese with out the rind. I also used Polaner apricot spreadable fruit. The combination was spectacular. I made this for Easter and was not sure if my family was going to like it so I made the small wheel. I wished I had bought the large wheel of Brie, it went so fast. I loved this so much that i made the small triangle of Brie about 3 days later for my husband and I. I added the picture of the triangle above. It did ooze out the back a bit but it was still great!.

Amazing!  And super easy. I got a wheel of brie,  cut off the rind from sides,  and put a few spoonfuls of cranberry apple preserves on top. Then I wrapped in one sheet of Puff pastry.  I didn't bother with egg white. It baked up beautifully,  looked fancy and tasted delicious. This is a keeper.

I used peach preserves because that's what I had. I made it with cresent roll dough. I used up all my eggs when baking so I just sealed it well with my fingers. No leaks whatsoever. Everyone loved it. I will be making this again. Delicious!

I make this often when we have company and it is always a hit.  I sprinkle brown sugar, on the wrapped brie,  and then drizzle maple syrup on top of the brown sugar.  I also buy the seamless dough sheet crescent rolls since it is easier to wrap the brie and it looks neater.

First made this for Mother's Day 2016. Big hit with the Selfs and Mel (not sure about Tom). I also added some chopped almonds to the apricot preserve layer. Didn't use as much preserves as indicated because I wanted the cheese to not be "runny" or discolored.  Easy to make. Puff Pastry browned well.

I make a very similar recipe and it is always a hit.  One thing that I add is some toasted almonds to the center of the wheel.  It really adds to the apricot flavor.  I also make some wine jellies that are great additions.

This was a different way to enjoy my favorite brie cheese, and pretty good! I will say, I really enjoyed the apricot preserves- the sweet to salty ratio was wonderful. However, I did have an issue with the cooking & consistency of this dish... Definitely use a pan or dish that has sides to it! Otherwise, if the puff pastry breaks open while cooking (which mine did), you will have an oily mess ALL over your oven! Next time I will use more of the apricot preserves- a generous amount is a good idea if you want to taste it through the puff pastry. I did find the pastry part to be a bit thick and overwhelming. And I also did not brush mine with egg whites, so I will try that next time. I just found the cheese to solidify pretty quickly, again, after baking, so it was a bit difficult & messy to cut into the longer it sat. Maybe making smaller portions would work better? Either way, I really enjoyed the taste & it was very quick and easy to make!

Delicious and very easy! Everyone enjoyed it. It's certainly a more elegant alternative to the usual cheese and cracker appetizers. I followed the recipe except I did add extra preserves as suggested by another reviewer. The apricot preserves were delicious, but I think I will try cherry preserves next time.

Took this to a French-themed dinner party. It was a hit! It looked beautiful and the men in particular kept coming back to get more. It was the first time I'd made this and my husband said, "You'll have to make this again!" I definitely will. Btw, I made it with just the apricot preserves. I followed the suggestion in another review to freeze it before I baked it and I did it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.

Baked brie rocks. We used a wedge of brie, cut in half and filled with apricot preserves, wrapped in pastry dough and baked for about 35 minutes. Was lovely. Next time will add a little more preserves; we liked the sweet of the fruity preserve to cut the richness of the cheese. Yumm!

This is my standby cocktail party appetizer.  I also have used fig preserves or diced jalapeno peppers (remove seeds with cooking gloves) and apricot preserves. Delicious! Don't forget to serve with tart green grapes or Granny Smith Green Applies.

Made this recipe - used fig preserves, almonds on top of "cheese sandwich" and crescent roll dough.  Did not need to freeze in order to cut brie in half.  It did not bake/brown quickly on 350 - increased oven temp to 400 and it browned right up.  It was fantastic!  Got rave reviews & comments like - "it's to die for."  Will definitely make this again, and again!

I used croissant pastry and made individual appetizers for some dinner guests.  It tastes great! I just needed to find a way to keep the Brie inside the pastry without it oozing all out.

Superb.  I piled on as many preserves as I could fit onto the brie wheel.  My skeptical husband was all over this and even ate up all of the leftovers.  Easy to make and delicious results.
