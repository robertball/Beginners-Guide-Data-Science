Made half of the recipe and decreased the flour to 2 cups.  Used my doughnut maker and baked for 6 minutes.  Came out perfect.  Makes 10/12 doughnuts this way.

This recipe is so easy and makes wonderful doughnuts. Sometimes I add cocoa powder or maple syrup to the glaze.

Wow! So easy, I can't believe nobody has rated/reviewed this yet! Quick and delicious. No waiting as for yeast doughnuts and not near as heavy as a traditional cake doughnut. Will certainly be making again. The family loved them dusted with powdered sugar right out of the fryer and it "melted" and glazed all over them. Might try w/cocoa in the mix next time w/out the cinnamon and nutmeg.

These were great. We needed to add more flour so they weren't too sticky to work with and then preferred to roll them into thick ropes and turn those into circles.

Delicious and easy, once I got the hang of it. I had never made doughnuts before. The dough needed more flour by about a cup in order to make a soft dough that was able to be kneaded and rolled. The glaze needed lots more milk to make it more of a glaze, otherwise it's just a rather stiff icing. I added quite a bit of milk and had to keep warming the glaze as I brushed it on the doughnuts to keep it the right consistency. But all in all, this was a great recipe and my family loved it.

Holy cow delicious and quite easy. I would like to mess around with the glaze a bit to make it taste less like straight icing sugar but I'm sure the comments that other people have posted will help me with that. The recipe makes a ton so I sent hubby to the office with a batch. Thanks for the great recipe!

I liked the consistency of the dough, but it was a bit flavorless to me, so I would double the cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter.

Taste and texture were very good.
If you make this recipe there are two
pitfalls. Start with 6 cups flour and much
more milk for the glaze. This recipe made 3 dozen.

This recipe was amazing!! I didn't have any buttermilk so I thinned 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt with 1/4 cup of milk instead. According to my daughter they were "amaze-balls"!!! I made half the batch tonight and froze the other half of the dough. We ate every last donut!!! I will definitely be making these again!

I've been on a doughnut kick lately, and this is probably the best tasting recipe I've tried in the last few weeks. Once I got a handle on this sticky dough, it turned out airy and fried up crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. I opted for cinnamon sugar and chocolate instead of the suggested glaze. The dough itself is plenty sweet, so the glazes and such aren't necessary, IMO. 

This is truly a cake doughnut... the others I've tried have been more like fried scones -- tasty, but not very sweet, and the perfect canvas for glazes. 

I'll definitely make these again, but I'll leave them naked.

The dough was too runny, the texture was not so good, the inside was still raw because 375 is too hot.

Excellent recipe for Cake donuts 
Easy recipe that comes together fast and tastes great.  I rolled mine in sugar cinnamon and left a few without.

Just on a whim, I halved the recipe and made doughnut holes instead. OMG they are so soft and fluffy. I used cinnamon sugar and maple syrup as a dipping sauce. My mom, the breakfast queen who would never touch a doughnut, ate 10! These are so good, quick and easy to make you would kick yourself if you pass up the chance.

I adjusted the recipe to make half a recipe.  Love that it adjusts it for you.  I was amazed at how simple the recipe is.  They came out perfect.  I used a citrusy flavoring which really gave the doughnuts a great taste.  It's a little messy to make, but the more you make them, the better you can judge on the flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made for Mother's day today, amazing!!!  Premixed wet ingredients last night and put in fridge.  Also premixed dry ingredients and put into covered bowl on counter overnight. Mixed all together today and then made them.  Easy and best donuts ever!  Made with a batch of crispy bacon so the salty/sweet tastes together was so good!

The dough was like goop. I had to add an additional cup of flour in other to be able to knead it.
