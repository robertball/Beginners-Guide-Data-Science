This recipe was so easy to make and absolutely DELICIOUS! The meat came out moist and yummy. The only thing I did differently was used fresh tomatoes AND a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. Definitely will be made again and again!

Besides the ingredients in the recipe, I added a tbs of tomato paste, 3/4 tsp Italian herb seasoning and zucchini strips.  Great!  Since I had to use some bone-in thighs, I covered the pan for the last 10 minutes of cooking.

After reading the reviews about being "bland", I substituted one can,  24 oz., pasta sauce for the diced tomatoes. I also added Italian seasoning to the flour. Everyone loved it. It took about 5 minutes longer to cook the chicken.

The chicken itself was a little bland, but I think it will turn out better the next time if I add some spices to the initial cooking of the chicken.  The rest of the dish was tasty.  Will definitely make again.
