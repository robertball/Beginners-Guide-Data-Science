Oh, we LOVED these!  Great flavor for dinner, and the leftovers were yummy too.  I subbed a 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes (minus a little of the juice) for the tomato, plus a bit more chicken broth instead of the wine.  Served them with a side of penne I tossed in a bit of butter and garlic powder.

Quick, easy and very tasty!  I only made one change and that was using canned tomatoes with Italian spices in place of the fresh.

This Italian gal says.......EXCELLENT!  When I'm away from home I want good, old-fashioned comfort food when I return. This hit the spot and was exactly what I needed and what I had in mind. I didn't see the need to pound the pork chops to a 1/4" thickness so just left them as is, about 1/2" in thickness. This way they were not overly large and it also reduced the chance of overcooking them.  Mindful of Hub's sensitive innards I omitted the red pepper flakes but it wasn't missed. I blanched the tomato in boiling water for about 30 seconds to remove the peel, and didn't bother to measure either the broth or wine.  Just poured in a glug or two of each, reduced it a bit, then swirled in a couple of pats of butter at the end to thicken the sauce and make it silky and smooth.  I served this over sauteed polenta (taking the easy way out and using already prepared polenta) and I'm telling you I was in "Welcome Home Dinner Nirvana."  Great recipe!

Yum. Yum.  My husband and I loved this dish, and then I made it for my in-laws.  They loved it too.  The only change I made was to add 3/4 tsp of dried sage leaves.  I suspected it would be bland.  The resulting flavor was very rich and savory.

Very nice dish. I added twice the wine and Chicken broth, along with some rosemary and basil.
Also upped the garlic by 2 cloves, and used boneless pork shoulder strips.
Cooking time was a bit longer, but the pork was very tender and sauce was delicious over buttered egg noodles.
Thank you, GEORGIAK!

I can't believe I let this sit in my recipe box for over a year before trying it.  This was amazing.  The pork chops were so tender and the sauce had such an amazing flavor.  This was loved by all.  I was hesitant on adding the red pepper flakes because my boys are so young but I added them anyway and they do not overpower the dish at all.  Every flavor compliments one another nicely without any being overpowering.  Thank you Georgiak for my new favorite pork chop recipe!

I made my own pork cutlets by buying a pork tenderloin, cutting it into 6 pieces and pounding them to 1/4 thickness.  Much more tender and cooks quicker than what some supermarkets sell for boneless chops.  I added 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar to the sauce to balance the other flavors and garnished the finished cutlets with Parmesan cheese.

I was so surprised at how fast the whole meal cooked up.  The flavor of the pork chops was wonderful and the sauce was superb.  Everyone really enjoyed this.  I took anothers sugestion and used a can of Italian diced tomatoes, with the juice and since I only had white zin on had I used that instead of the dry white wine.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This is a very good way to prepare the chops.  I didn't use that much olive oil--only used 1 TBS.  Also, used dried parsley instead of fresh--forgot to put fresh on the list.  Will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I make this recipe quite often and I absolutely love it.  I like spicy foods, so I use canned tomatoes with chiles, and I use a little more crushed red pepper.  I also took another reviewer's advice and add a little butter towards the end to make the sauce smooth and rich.  Served over garlic butter noodles, it makes a delicious and very filling dinner!

This has become a favorite in our home.  I had the butcher run the boneless chops thru the cube steak machine, much easier than pounding them.  Wonderfully tender.

Easy & delish, I added lots of nice fresh basil in place of the parsley and served over angel hair. I doubled the sauce. Yumm-o!

Oh my!  We thought this was very good!!  I'd make this again in a heartbeat.  I didn't have pork chops so I used a 1 1/4 pound pork tenderloin, cut into thick medallions.  I cut way back on the oil and used a total of maybe 1 1/2 T.  I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano, drained.  And only one tablespoon of chopped parsley with a little extra for garnish.  Served over mashed potatoes with some of the extra broth drizzled over all.  It was heavenly!  Thank you!

I enjoyed this and would consider it a "low calorie" dish as it does not contain any cheese or butter sauces.  I did not use all of the oil to brown the cutlets.  I used a can of diced drained tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil and thin sliced pork sirloin cutlets which were about 1/2 in thick.  I did not pound them.  Will make this again and probably will try with chicken too.

I had pork cutlets and a hungry spouse... I found this recipe and within the hour I had a delicious meal. I made the recipe exactly as written and the pork was moist and flavorful. Thankfully I had leftovers in the fridge of boiled yuca and cabbage salad to serve as sides. Somehow it all worked. I will make this pork again.

This is one of my favorite meals to make. The most helpful critical review says that it was not spicy enough for them but never measure the pepper and just add until I think it is good. I had left over turkey stock from Thanksgiving and I have even subbed that for the chicken broth.

I was amazed at how good this dish tastes.  I used a pork loin, cut it in 3/8" thick I had about 7 slices. Used extra fresh tomatoes from my garden, and extra wine and broth.  It was so delicious my hubby wants me to keep making this from now on.  My side dish was a pasta and cheese it was a great dinner.

Very colorful dish.  You need to have all of your ingredients ready to go before starting this recipe.  Very easy to make.  If you like garlic...this recipe is loaded with it.  A nice dish to make to impress a first date.  Will probably make again.  Might even just make the sauce and serve over pasta.  Pork tenderloin medallions would also be great instead of boneless pork chops.

This was so good and the easiest dish in the world to prepare. Perfect weeknight supper.  I, like others, used diced tomatoes (with garlic, oregano,etc) instead of the fresh tomatoes.  That is only change I made!  Served over sauteed polenta (stole this from another reviewer) accompanied by crusty bread, tossed salad and vino!  Yummy.

I just want to tweak this as it's my recipe.  Do not use pork chops on the bone.  Pound out boneless loin chops to about 1/4 inch thick and sautee very quickly, no more than a minute each side.  Chicken breasts or veal prepped the same way can be nicely substituted.

I used a pork tenderloin cut into 1/2 inch thickness. 1/4 inch would have been too thin. Pork came out very, very moist. Wish the sauce was thicker, but the flavor was GREAT!! A little too spicy for me but my boyfriend loved it, and he is a picky eater. I followed ingredients and directions exactly except for pork thickness. Will def make again!!!!

This recipe is very easy and delicious and I have made it a few times now.  I used canned tomatoes the first time and it was good, but it is better with a fresh tomato.  Once I substituted a dash of cayenne pepper for the flaked chilis and it is good both ways.  If you serve with broad egg noodles the sauce goes well on them.

My fiance commented on how good the sauce was every few bites. I made a few alterations. I added an onion & too extra cloves of garlic, a tsp of basil & a tsp of flour to thicken. I think I will use this as a base for chicken, adding red pepper. thanks for a keeper

Great meal! I prepared this dish with a little more chicken broth and wine, and made the sauce about a half hour before browning the thin cutlets. Instead of just oil, I added 2 tbsp. of butter with the recommended amount of oil--it browned the cutlets quicker (about 45 second per side). I added them to the warm sauce for about two more minutes before serving over thin spaghetti (which I reserved 1/2 cup of broth to mix with after draining so it wouldn't dry out). The cutlets, as thin as they were, were moist and not dry at all. A great, easy dish! Yum.

This is a super easy and delicious meal! I pounded pork tenderloin and added a light Italian bread crumb coating. I followed others' suggestions with a spicy can of tomatoes. I served it with fire roasted balsamic butter veggies (from the freezer aisle) tossed into trottole spiral pasta.

I made the recipe as posted and found the dish to be lacking...something. It was like eating cutlets in marinara sauce, but somebody left a bunch of stuff out of the marinara sauce. The dish was quick and easy, I will give it that. I'll just go back to the old cutlet cooked in marinara with a little parmesan on top recipe.

Delicious! I was so worried about undercooking it, that I may have overcooked it a bit, but pork chops are tough by nature, so it was still yummy. The red pepper flakes also added a nice little kick. Definitely a keeper!

Very good and I will definitely make it again. The only changes I made were to very lightly flour the pounded chops and to use a can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh. So I added only about 1/4 cup of broth, since the canned tomatoes included some liquid.

Unique way to dress up pork... and full of flavor!   Didn't have chicken broth in the house, so we added a flour/water mixture to thicken the sauce up a bit.  Worked out well.. We will definitely make this again.. maybe next week!

WONDERFUL!  My family loved this recipe.  I also used canned tomatoes slightly drained.  Also, I did not have parsley and used basil instead.  Turned out great!  Thanks!!

My family loved this.  After cooking it, the pork just didn't look very appetizing so I was worried I was going to have to make a fast food run to make up for a flop, but was very pleasantly surprised.  I served it over wide egg noodled & will definitely make again.

Thanks!

If only I could give it 6 stars!! I made some changes: used balsamic vinegar (instead of wine) and added sliced cooked potatoes before the pork (because I didn't have pasta). Also, to add some Italian taste, I added sliced black olives 5 minutes before it was ready. Ciao!

I've made this multiple times (both for an easy weeknight dinner & with company over) to rave reviews.  I usually add extra pepper flakes, and I find it takes longer for the sauce to reduce than the recipe says, but the real benefit is that you can thicken the sauce a bit with the chops in & not have to worry about them coming out tough & over cooked.

I remove the chops & cover with foil to rest for 5 minutes at the end & turn up the heat to help reduce the sauce.

Hmmm... yummy

Very tasty - I subbed the fresh tomato with canned seasoned tomatoes, and added a few sprinkles of hot sauce to the cooking mixture.  Oh, it just added a little pizzaz!!   So very tasty I think I may use the tomato mixture and try it with fish!

Really enjoyed this. Did use canned chopped tomatoes. Will definitely make again. Don't let the "spicy" scare you. Used the red pepper flakes & it wasn't hot at all, just gave it a nice flavor.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful! I made just minor modifications for personal preference...sauteed sliced mushrooms with garlic and used bone in chops that were about an inch thick, so had to cook a bit longer. I used Italian stewed tomatoes because that's what I had, and they added great flavor, and I did add about 1 tbls butter to the sauce when chops were done as one reviewer recommended. Served sauce over rice and on chops. Moist, tender, very flavorful. Yummmm...delish!

Five stars from me based on the ease it took cooking these, and five stars from hubby based on taste (I don't really eat meat).  I loved that these weren't breaded, and the aroma as I was preparing them was phenomenal!  I eye-balled the wine and chicken broth, and upped the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp for my spice-a-holic hubby, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Served with yummy roasted potatoes also on this site, and salad.  Will definitely make again! (Hubby said hopefully soon :)

Followed the recipe as is except that I used dried parsley. I used savignon blanc for the wine. The sauce tasted great and, surprisingly, you could taste the spiciness. It was a very tolerable 'American-grade' spiciness...but was still at a pleasurable level for spicy food lovers like myself.

We don't like diced tomatoes, so we modified this recipe by adding steamed fingerling potatoes. We also added rosemary and basil like another reviewer suggested. Even my picky three year old liked it and asked for more!

This was fabulous! I made a few minor changes though. I sliced up 4 cloves of garlic, seared 1lb of pork cutlets and put them on a plate while I sauteed 3/4ths of the garlic in 1 tbl of olive oil and added only chicken broth (no wine) and a can of diced tomatoes (with some corn starch to thicken it up) and then put the cutlets back in on medium for 10 minutes. While the pork simmered I boiled butternut squash stuffed pasta from Trader Joe's and made an olive oil/butter/leftover sliced garlic sauce to toss them in. When I served everything I put parmasean cheese on the pasta. The hubby LOVED it and so did I.

I absolutely love this recipe! I have used it on pork cutlets and pounded chicken breast.  I had to used dried parsley last time, and it turned out fine.  Thinly sliced garlic it fantastic in this recipe.

It was late and I had not gotten anything out for dinner and, quite frankly, I did not feel like cooking. Then I saw this recipe. The pork cutlets were a quick thaw and this meal was done in no time with with great praise from the whole mob. Fabulous and fast. Thanks!

this recipe made a delicious, moist meal. I was really shocked that the pork chops came out so moist!! I used a can of diced tomatoes (partially drained but I would recommend using all the juices) and chicken stock (no wine in the house). No need to bake the chops if you pound them out--let them simmer in the sauce while the side of pasta cooks--YUM!

Overall I think this one was decent, but not something I'd crave.  It was interesting because I really enjoyed making it; however, I think that the pork cutlets at that thickness may be too thin.  Mine were a little dry.  I would make it again, but I would use thicker cuts of meat.  The sauce was flavorful and for us was a different taste with pork.

These were delicious! I don't usually measure for recipes like this, so I added extra garlic and 'eyeballed' the main ingredients. These turned out really easy and very yummy; a definite keeper. Thanks!

I could not rate it more because it was not knocking my socks off but it was very very good and I will surely keep it in my dinner rotation. I appreciated the new flavors to introduce to pork and I really appreciated that the ingredients are everything most cooks will have in their kitchen. Thanks so much for sharing!

Added about 1 1/2 tsp. balsamic, also sprinkled some onion powder into the pork chop seasoning, and sprinkled shredded parm/romano on top at the end for garnish--just wonderful!! I made extra sauce to have over fettucine on the side(doctored up with some butter and parm), served with garlic bread --we were in heaven!  Thanks!

This is a very plain dish.  I think if you've ever eaten at a 5 star restaurant, you would certainly give this no more than 2 or 3.  As another reviewer said, the sauce does not thicken until there is nothing left but mushy tomatoes. If you brown those thin pork chops and then cook them for an additional 5-10 mins, you will not be sure whether you are chewing on shoe leather or a piece of meat.  I don't mean to be this critical, but lately I've tried a few too many recipes from this site that have been rated 5 stars and are not worthy.  Like I said, this is a fine dish for a weeknight dinner, but 5 stars?????  I would never serve it to guests.

What awesomeness. We substituted white vinegar + 1/4 cup of sugar for the white wine and got a very nice sweet sauce (nobody had white wine). Compliments brown rice quite nicely. We've also added finely minced onions (sauteed before putting in the tomatoes, and after searing the pork), chopped olives (after the pork is added to the tomato mixture). 

This recipe also works well with garlic powder -- give a light dusting to the pork before it is tossed into the pan and sprinkle in a bit more after everything is sitting in the pan.

Used thin, boneless cutlets (buy one package, get one free week!).  I served with mashed potatoes but think I will use thin spaghetti next time.  Very tasty.  Pork gets tough when overcooked, and these thin cutlets cook rapidly!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Wow, really good.  Normally with these sorts of things the spice is overwelming but the flavor is italian, but surpringly subtle.  Complements the flavor of the pork amazingly.

WOW! These were GREAT! I think this will become my standard pork chop recipe. The only thing the sauce needed was onions, other than that, delish! I tenderized the chops with a mallet before I seared them to make them super tender. You can't go wrong with this.

This is an excellent recipe for those wanting something healthy, tasty and quick. I didn't have a fresh tomato so I used a small can of plum tomatoes and also added a teensy bit extra wine. It was really delicious, I will definitely make it again!

wow! EASY!!  this was the first time i made pork - EVER.  and everyone loved it!  (funny thing is, i don't eat pork, so i never tasted it - haha!  i did enjoy the tomatoes tossed with pasta, though.)  i followed the recipe exactly, except i added a small onion to the garlic.  i served it over al dente spaghetti tossed in olive oil and parsley with salad and rolls - what a great presentation!  thanks for a great recipe!

Wish I could say this was delicious, but was very disappointed.  Meat was tough and dry.  Sauce was just ok.  Maybe the meat should have been cooked on lower heat.

I torqued up the spice on this baby to 1/4 CUP (not teaspoon) of red chili flakes. I also added 1/8 cup of korean chili flake (Gochugaru). Suffice to say, I was sweating so good when I was eating these. The garlic flavor still came through. I also added a 1/4 cup of Newmans marinara sauce because I didn't think there would be enough to spread around my 4 chops. The only think I disliked about this recipe is that I think the cook time given for the chops is a bit generous... but then again, thickness matters. The extra sauce goes nicely on a piece of real bread (no wonderbread stuff) and a nice full bodied red wine with some acidity helps to deal with the incessant throbbing of the mouth as the spice does its work.

My husband and I thought this was excellent.  We both really love garlic, so instead of the 4 cloves of it I used 2 whole garlic heads, and drained canned tomatoes, I also upped the red pepper flakes,  gave it a little kick.

We just moved back into our home after water damage and I needed a meal in a pinch. We had on-hand 5 fresh, small pork cutlets, 1/2 an onion, canned, diced tomatoes, the oil, broth and wine, but we had no garlic, no fresh tomato, and no fresh parsley! I seared the cutlets as directed, but sauteed 1/4 diced onion in the olive oil before adding canned,  diced tomatoes and dried parsley. I added garlic salt for more flavor. They came out tender, juicy and flavorful. We served it with canned green beans and buttered noodles. The meal was quick to prepare and a winner for my little family.

Served over buttered noodles.  Added some mushrooms . Followed recipe except the mushrooms and used rotel tomatoes and left out the pepper flakes. Came out perfect  and very  tender and just the right amount of heat  and spice. Quick,  easy, and delicious.

This is an excellent recipe for any kind of boneless pork- I used loin chops & the sauce was delicious! Like other reviewers I doubled the wine & broth for more sauce- and we actually ate Stove top cornbread stuffing with it & it was so good! I did use fresh tomatoes which I think really enhanced the flavor- will definitely be using this recipe a lot!

Nice simple easy meal. I'll definitely be making this one again. I make something like this with steak and never thought to do it with pork chops. Made it exactly as stated except that I also used a 14.5 oz, can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Came out perfect. No complaints. Husband was happy with the meal.

It was good but nothing special. I added twice the amount of pepper flakes and added a large pinch of oregano and a bit more wine, but it didn't taste too strongly of anything. It mostly tasted of pork. If I made it again I would add much more spice.

Tasty, easy, and I would ,make this again. I didn't pound the pork, and I definitely should have to make it more tender esp for the kids. I think I prefer to mince the garlic, too, rather than slice it, and definitely more red pepper flakes for more spice.. Smelled heavenly!

I used Italian Seasoning in place of the parsley and Burgundy Cooking Wine instead of White.  Very tasting sauce -- the pork cutlets tasted great over mashed potatoes.

Loved it!  

I didn't have a fresh tomato, so I was happy to see so many people used canned, it worked great.   I added a little more red pepper, because we like spicy!   Served over egg noodles, and the SO says, "YUMMY".  

Edited to add: I've now made this many times, I've followed some of the different options that people mentioned in their reviews: Made with chicken, lightly dusted in seasoned flour, used it as a base for adding other veggies in (currently eating this with chicken and fava beans!)  I can't thank you enough for posting this recipe!

Thanks for the great recipe!  I'll try this with chicken next, as  the original poster suggests!

Wow, I was worried it would be bland as there is not many spices used in this recipe but I was pleasantly surprised. I used chicken stock instead of wine, added a small squash and Italian seasoning. Otherwise, I followed the directions and it was very good and prepared in no time.

It was very good & very tasty.  It was also super easy to make. My husband had 2 servings.  I seasoned my pork chops with a little salt and pepper but added a little garlic powder and red pepper flakes. I also substituted a can of 14.5 oz diced tomatoes  instead of the diced tomato.  After adding chicken broth, white wine, red pepper flakes, and parsley-I added a packet of Splenda and some fresh chopped basil.  Will definitely make this again.

I read some of the reviews and then made some modifications.  I added Italian seasoning in addition to the parsley. I cooked some penne pasta (al dente) which after draining I added it to the pork/tomatoes mixture after the pork was cooked.  Then to dress it up a bit, I sprinkled some fresh Italian and a tad of feta cheese over the dish before serving.  Will be making this again!

This is a fantastic recipe! It's fairly simple, uses very few ingredients, yet the flavor is delicious. My whole family loved it. I more than doubled the recipe and so had to make it in batches. I found I had to be very careful not to over-heat the oil as I was saute-ing the garlic. I increased the broth as needed, to make enough of the 'gravy.'

I served this with loaded mashed potatoes and whole green beans. I used Cupcake pinot grigio for the white wine and it was a wonderful pairing.  My husband found this a bit too spicy for him, i found it delicious. Used canned rosemary and garlic diced tomatoes instead of fresh and it turned out great. I'd make this again! Thank you!

we loved this.. i'm sure we used less than 1/4 cup of olive oil total.. instead of pounding the cutlets we just sliced them in half and tenderized them.. cilantro for parsley per usual with us.. served along side Oven Roasted Greek Potatoes and Sauteed Swiss Chard with Parmesan Cheese (both on this site) ty so much for the recipe

I went a little overboard on the red pepper flakes so it turned out super spicy. I subbed the dry white wine with white wine vinegar and put in a little extra broth. I also wanted it just a bit thicker so I added some canned tomato sauce. Probably would've been a better dish had I not gone overboard with the red pepper.

I used a can of tomatoes vice a fresh tomato.  I made it Italian -style as noted above the first time. Added some dried basil, oregano, parsley. The 2nd time I had a can of Ro-Tel with Lime and Cilantro. I added that with fresh cilantro for Mexican-style pork.  Both ways DELISH!  This is a keeper and i very versatile.

Excellent.  I also used a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  I also used minced garlic instead of clove.  A ton of flavor in this recipe.  I had a little more liquid left over than I would have liked but still tasted great.  May reduce the broth a tad next time.

Great recipe! did make some changes b/c of things not on hand. Sauteed onion before adding garlic +. Used 1 c chicken broth, no wine. Used dried parsley and added extra red pepper flakes. Turned out fabulous! Will make again and will make the tomato mix as a bruschetta(sp?)mix, too. Yummy!

I could never imagine how this recipe turned out to be as delicious as it did but wow.  I just followed it as stated except for only having red cooking wine which I substituted instead of white.  It was amazing and I will make it again and again!!

This dish is divine, so much better than I expected. I did use canned diced tomatoes (have tried fresh and like diced better). I also did not use chicken broth, just more wine. Also, browned the pork in olive oil and fresh garlic and sauteed additional garlic for the tomato mixture as well.........all I can say is YUM

This was so tasty! Instead of pork, I used chicken and followed the recipe exactly. I think it was a bit spicy for me, though my husband loved it, I will cut the red pepper flakes by a bit.

This is quick, easy and delish! Thanks for a tasty low-carb dinner. Didn't have quite enough of the topping, so I would probably double that next time. I used Sake for the white wine and I didn't pound my chops. I seared them about 3 mins on each side and then simmered in the sauce for about 5 minutes. They were perfect. I only used a small pinch of red pepper flakes and it gave just a hint of a bite - which was nice for us.

So quick, so easy and so tasty!! I didn't have any extra tomatoes so a 14.5 oz. can worked and instead of draining the liquid, I just added a little dry chicken boullion and no broth. Maybe not such a good idea, since my sauce didn't thicken, but it still tasted great and I'll definitely have this again to I'll try to do it right the next time. Thanks SO much for the recipe - we'll have it regularly.

This is my husband's new favorite meal !  I've made it with pasta as well as rice.   Penne pasta was outstanding.  I even have to make extra sauce and store it in an empty jar in the frig for him to use on almost anything.

Yum!  I made a little adjustment...I tossed the pork cutlets in some Italian bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese before  searing them. And I used 4 Roma tomatoes instead of one large. Other than that I followed the recipe. It was delicious.  I served it with sauteed potatoes, onions and peppers and Italian salad.  Thanks!

So good! I didn't have wine or chicken broth so I subbed beef broth to make up the difference. I think that might have made it a bit more robust. Also added a frozen cube of basil. Nice and spicy! I served over some bow tie pasta that I tossed with olive oil and parm. Quick, simple and oh so good!

I really liked the flavors together although I did use a bit of cornstarch with my chicken broth to thicken the sauce a bit more. I used the fresh tomatoes of summer and it was great.

This recipe is a keeper! I have a son who hates tomatoes, but he actually enjoyed this recipe. I personally thought it was alittle to spicy for my liking, but the rest of the family loved the spicyness of it.

I made this last night and it was amazing!!!  I used a can of diced tomato instead and served over thin spaghetti. I also like to add some onion and more chicken broth to the mix to enhance the texture and increase the amount of sauce.

I've been making this recipe for years. When I have fresh garden tomatoes, I use one. When I do not, I substitute a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes. This evening, by mistake I grabbed the beef broth instead of the chicken broth. Due to that, I decided to use red wine (a Shiraz that I happened to have open) instead of white. Both of these were excellent substitutions and provided a little more flavor.

Delicious!  Easy to make -- great for a weeknight dinner!  I cooked a portion without the red pepper as our 4 year old doesn't like spicy food and even without the pepper it was great!

I made this with two huge chicken breasts  and it turned out very well.  The breasts were so thick that after searing them I put them in the oven and baked for about 15-20 min.  The sauce was very flavorful even though I realized at the last minute I was out of red pepper flakes.  My bf doesn't like tomatoes and even with scraping them off he still thought the chicken was good.

Pretty good. Overall I enjoyed it, however I think it was just a tad two dimensional. It's a good taste and I'll be using it as a base to move on from.

Very nice...I used some pork cutlets that I had on hand.  Canned diced tomatoes and veggie stock, also all I had on hand.  No white wine, as we're red drinkers, but didn't add any red either.  Everyone enjoyed it, but the kids scraped off the tomatoes.  Picky eaters!

This was just okay for us.  Followed recipe exactly - sauce didn't thicken up, but it still tasted good.  The cutlets were rather bland, though.  I'd like to try this again maybe marinating the cutlets first....

My husband LOVED it.  I thought it was pretty good, and I hate pork chops.  I did the canned Italian tomatos as suggested, and that was a nice addition with the spices.  The only recommendation I make is to hold off on the pepper if you have kids that are going to eat it.  Between the pepper and the garlic, it was too spicy for my 6 year old.  Also I made the sauce first because it needed quite a bit more time to thicken up than the recipe said.

This was perfect.  I added diced zucchini and doubled the liquid so i could drizzle it over the pasta.  I put in a teaspoon of cornstarch just to make it not so thin.  It didn't thicken it much but just enough.  The red pepper added just a small kick, not to spicy at all.  My  husband HATES PORK, but this he went back for seconds on.  Just a great easy recipe.  Thank you

It was good but I forgot to pound thin the pork chops, so I increased the cooking time a little. The chops turned out moist and beautiful. I eliminated the red pepper flakes because I was serving it to my kids. I sprinkled on Mrs. Dash Garlic and herbs during cooking instead.

My favorite recipe to make.  I added mushrooms and sprinkled in some Wondra to thicken the sauce.  Not too much because it can tend to become a bit chunky if you dont watch it.  Otherwise, fantastic recipe I have made several times for several different people who all love it.

This wasn't bad...I used thick boneless pork cutlets, because that's what I had in the house....let cook about an extra 20 minutes....pork was tender....but I served it with Spanish Rice and I think it overwhelmed the dish with tomatoes...

I will try again with egg noodles so I can really appreciate the sauce!

Really easy weeknight recipe. I didn't have any fresh or diced tomatoes on hand, so I substituted crushed tomatoes instead. Sauce was DELICIOUS! I also substituted rissotto instead of the pasta which gave it a richer taste. I think next time I will make it in the crockpot so the pork will be more tender.

I think the reason it didn't taste good may have been that I didn't have garlic cloves so I used minced garlic from a jar.  Maybe I'll try again another time.

This was very good and very easy.  I omitted the parsely b/c I had none, and I used a can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have a fresh one.  I couldn't tell the difference.  It was a nice spin on regular old pork chops!

The sauce had a wonderful flavor.  It did take longer than a couple of minutes for it to thicken, but it was worth it.  I will use the sauce on chicken, pasta, and whatever else I think of in the future.  I didn't have a fresh tomato on hand, so I used half a can of diced tomatoes that I drained.  Turned out great.

Very good!  I had thin bone-in pork chops, so I used those, but didn't change anything else.  They were very yummy and we weill definitely make them again.  My sauce didn't really thicken and I cooked them for less than 10 minutes so they wouldn't be overdone.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this took a long time to thicken up, so it ended up more of a tomato mush sauce.  The taste was ok - I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  I probably won't make it again, but it was a nice change.

Nice fresh taste, and really easy preparation. Great recipe for this time of year when tomatoes are at their peak.

We loved this one and it looks great, too.  I served with buttered pasta and steamed veggies.  Next, I'll try it with chicken.  Loved it, loved it, loved it!  Thanks!

Simply tasteful.  I prefer to use chicken instead of pork even though the pork tastes great too.  I also added pasta al dente to the skillet prior to simmering an extra 10 minutes.  Very flavourful!

Yum!  At first I was going to give this 4 stars - but the flavor after we ate this meal was so good.  My husband is raving about it!  We both agree that the flavors are so fresh and full.

I was looking to spice up my usual pan-baked pork chops in a simple, quick manner and found this little gem.  The boneless cutlets I used turned out delicious!  I altered the standard recipe a bit by adding more chicken broth instead of white wine.  In addition, I tossed in about 1 tbsp. of minced onions.  I ate this dish with a side of Cuban-style black beans and rice...  Loved this combo with extraordinary pork chops!

This was surprisingly good!  I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding onions as other reviewers suggested).  My sauce would not thicken and I was afraid to keep cooking it for fear it would boil down to nothing so I finally added the pork while it was still thin.  The sauce did end up thickening during the last 5 minutes of cooking the cutlets. Thanks submitter.

We loved this recipe. I am not much of a pork fan, but this was very good. I love the sauce and plan to try this same recipe with chicken. The sauce is awesome. I also didn't add salt as this would be to salty. Very good though. I usually don't even give reviews, but I thought this one deserved a review.

I first tried this with chicken cutlets and it was good.  But with the pork cutlets the flavors mesh perfectly.  I would serve this to company.

Five stars for the sauce. I used turkey cutlets, doubled the garlic and tomato. I also added fresh
lemon juice to the sauce. I think using fresh tomatoes really makes to sauce thicken instead of canned. This sauce is very versatile. My husband doesn't use salt so I spooned some of the sauce over steamed green beans and he loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic recipe! I really don't cook pork very often but I'll make this recipe a lot. I did double the sauce for some extra to put on the rice.

These were so good!  Very tasty and easy.  I will be making these regularly.  I used a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes rather than a tomato, and dried parsley rather than fresh and they were still great.  The sauce did seem a little thin...next time I'll use a tomato.

I made this last night for dinner and both my husband and I loved it, but it was a bit too spicy for my kids. This was fairly easy to make and used ingrediants that I typically have on hand.  The meat was tender and so full of flavor. We will definatley make this again.

YUM!  More importantly, my 9 y/o stepson liked it too!
I had no noodles, so used rice instead for a side.  I cooked mine a little bit longer than 10 minutes, and covered for part of the cooking, chops were tender but firm.  I also sprinkled a little chopped cilantro over the chops and rice just before serving.  Quick, too.

Flavor was excellent, but the pork was not tender.  Maybe I had bad cutlets...
