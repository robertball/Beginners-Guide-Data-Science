Very easy to make and fun to eat!  I plan on making these again, but with some variations:  almond extract instead of peppermint, or mini chocolate chips mixed with the meringue (or sprinkled mini chips on top of the unbaked cookie).  Another possible variation: a well-drained maraschino cherry (without stem) in the center instead of the chocolate kiss, and omitting the peppermint extract.  While my young daughter likes to eat these cookies, I still plan on making them by myself  (raw egg whites).

I didn't give this recipe 5 Overall stars because it seems to need something, mainly presentation-wise.  I think some finely shaved chocolate or jimmies sprinkled on the unbaked meringue would "dress up" the cookie a bit.

Tips on making the cookie: avoid air-pockets between the meringue and the kiss, and use two baking sheets -- you can fit the whole recipe on both sheets and get the whole batch in the oven at one time.

I love these and make them every Christmas.

I use mint chocolate kisses in one batch and add a little green food coloring. Before popping it in the oven I add green and white sprinkles. 

Another batch gets well-drained (and patted-dry) maraschino cherries and a little red food coloring and red & white sprinkles.

A third batch gets regular chocolate, no coloring, and chocolate sprinkles.

The result is a very Christmassy platter of colorful treats. It gets decimated at any party I take it to.

I made this every Christmas when my children were little and now for my grandchildren.  I use mini-chocolate chips folded into the meringue rather than the kisses.  Also don't care for the peppermint, instead used almond.  Sprinkled white edible glitter over the cookies and they are beautiful and festive.

I have made this kind of cookie before and never with these results.  I tried 4 batches and none of them turned out for me.

My mother used to make these every Christmas and I've been looking to find a recipe so I could make them for my kids.  This is the one to use!!  AWESOME.  Just like I remember my Mom making.  Love them.  Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any cream of tartar.  I used two drops of vinegar instead; did the trick wonderfully!  Meringue was lovely and thick and shiney.  These are now on my must have list for Christmas.

Sooooooo good, with or without chocolate.  Loved the peppermint.  Also sprinkled crushed candy canes on top before baking... Very pretty.  Mine were still a little gooey inside so I may try cooling inside the open oven next time instead of removing the cookies promptly; but I really liked them this way too.  Might just be the Seattle humidity... Always hard to make meringues here!

I was looking for a recipe for meringue nest for easter and came across this one.  Growing up in the 60s in our town, we had a Woman's Bakery on the main street.  I remember buying meringue nest in different colours at easter time for 5 or 10 cents. I wanted my children to have the same experience as me to remember.  This recipe worked great.  Didn't bother with any flouring, just a little food colouring.  Then piped birds nest on the cookie sheet and baked as directed.  We finished them off, by putting some tiny easter eggs in them.. so easy and so good... thanks

Made very minor changes--no peppermint extract but used Candy Cane Hershey's Kisses. There are 44 in a package! Will definitely make again.

This one is right out of an ancient Tupperware cookbook I have.  Best liked without the peppermint flavoring but in place I have also used other flavorings:  mint, strawberry, orange, almond.  I like them all but everyone else I know prefer the cookies with just the vanilla.  I've also used some of the fancier Kisses that are filled or even just nuts.  A little more work to cover the nuts.

Use an electric beater and beat on high for a LONG TIME to get stiff enough!
I had to go through 2 batches of this before I got it right for them to be "stiff" enough. I had to beat the egg whites with my kitchenaid mixer for about 10 minutes on high for them to get to a soft peak. Then I had to beat the cup of sugar for at least another 10 minutes on high speed for the batter to get to consistency that was firm enough. It is right when it is the consistency of cool whip. 
 I did not use the peppermint extract. I put Hershey's CHERRY kisses in the center of these and then used a knive to cover the kiss with enough batter. I sprinkled some with red sugars, and others I swirled a toothpick dipped in red food coloring to give it a candy cane effect. They are beautiful and taste awesome! The only reason I didn't give full stars is cause I had such trouble figuring this recipe out and wish I would have known it could take so long to get firm using a heavy duty electric mixer.

I had to make this twice before it 'kind of' worked.  I think maybe because my peppermint extract was oil based?  I'm not sure, but the first batch wouldn't peak at all (I ended up baking it spread out on the cookie sheet) and the second one I added the peppermint after the peaks formed and it took a lot of extra beating to get it to somewhere between soft and firm peaks.  I ended up just making little meringue stars with red sprinkles because I don't think it would have held its shape any bigger.  Tastes really good though.
