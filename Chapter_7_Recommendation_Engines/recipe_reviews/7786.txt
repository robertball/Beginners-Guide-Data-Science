This is THE BEST CAKE ! I made it for a baby shower(shaped & decorated like a bib) and added a chocolate mousse filing between the layers...chocolate heaven! I got so many compliments, everyone said it was the best choc. cake they had ever eaten and wanted to order one! I think I'm now in the cake business. The only substitution I made was 1 cup of hot strong coffee for the liquer and I melted the choc. chips with it. The recipe was perfect for a 12 inch round cake pan to, then I just made 2 batches to layer it. Tres Magnifique !

This cake is excellent! Moist, semi-dense, rich - all of my favorite cake adjectives. I followed recipe exactly, except for usuing 3/4 cup mini chips instead of 1 cup regular. I was going to make a ganache and decided at the last minute to follow the recipe directions for the icing - glad I did! I used a dark chocolate fudge frosting with the Kahlua. We took this to a party and all of the very full guests had to have some. H didn't want to leave it and ate one more piece before we went home. I'll make this again - thanks!

I used this batter for cupcakes and they were the best!!!!!!! As suggested in a review below, I used coffee instead of liqueur and it worked great. I also used the allrecipe "Coffee Butter Frosting" to top the cupcakes.

Perhaps this recipe would be wonderful without this much oil. It made the cake heavy and greasy tasting. One cup of Kahlua is way too much unless you want to taste nothing but the liquer. I would recommend cutting the oil to 2/3 and the liquor to 1/2. Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

Excellent cake! Well, mine turned out good because I used 2/3 cup of Kaluha. Also, by accident, I read it wrong and put it 2 tablespoons of oil. Actually, that made the texture just right! Definetly making this one again!

This is definitely a make-again cake! Rich, dense cake with a hint of Kaluha. Delicious. I sliced it lengthwise and added a coffee whipped cream to the middle. (Called "Mocha Cream," in the fillings and frostings section). That added a nice light texture and coffee flavor to break up the dense chocolate-y goodness!

I love dark chocolate so I had to give this a try.  I brought this over to a super bowl party.  The first thing that popped out of everyone's mouth was, "Does this have alcohol in it?"  The coffee-flavored liqueur may be a little bit too strong so you might want to hold off on it.

It's a nice chocolate cake, but not quite a mocha. 
3~4 tablespoons of oil were perfect for this cake. 
1 and 1/4 cup of sour cream was also good for more moist. 
I rather use "coffee butter frosting" from allrecipes than prepared chocolate frosting. It was too sweet and too much chocolate.
You might want to sprinkle some coconut flake or chopped nut on top for decolation. Without deco, the cake looks so boring.

This was very good. My family voted it 5 stars but I give it 4. I subbed coffee for the coffee flavored liquer. This was so super easy, maybe I should give it a 5? Thanks!!!!

2 yummy!!  Wow my family loves this cake!
I had to substitute a yellow cake mix for a choc. mix because I didnt have choc. I also only used 4T of oil like others suggested it was plenty.  I also decreased the coffee liquer too 1/2 cup that was just right.  I used the coffee butter frosting from this site, soooo much better than the prepared kind.   THANKS for this rec. will make many more times.

This cake is excellent!  Everyone always raves about it.  I had one friend who begged me to give him more after eating 1/2 of the cake!  It is very rich and chocolatey and tastes great with a caramel or chocolate glaze.

I've made about 3 cakes in my entire life, but I wanted to do something special for my roommate's birthday.  I used one reviewer's idea of filling with the mocha cream, and it was very easy and turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This cake was excellent! Everyone raved about this cake when I made it. I am new again to baking and I used some suggestions here (1/2 cup of oil, and substituting for the liqueur). I used espresso in place of the double strength coffee. it turned out great! thank you for the suggestions!!

I agree with some other posters who said the cake called for too much liquior. I used a dark chocolate mix and used just under one cup of liquior. Then I used my favorite chocolate frosting from Betty Crocker. Didn't add anything; just nuked it for 25 seconds to make it so I could pour it over the cake. I do think that beating the batter for the required 3-5 minutes is what ultimate made this cake rise so well. I didn't have a bundt pan but made an 11 inch round that was dense and moist. It would even be good without frosting and just dusted with some confectioners sugar.

I followed directions to the spot and followed other's direction of reducing the oil. The texture was fabulous (soft, not too oily, spongey) but the taste was not high on my list of ever want to taste again. I will keep the recipe to manioulate for other cake flavors but I won't be making the "mocha" part ever again.

I "accidentally" purchased a dark chocolate cake mix; not a huge fan of dark chocolate so I looked for something to "help" it out. This was a delicious recipe! I didn't have coffee liqueur, and didn't read the suggestion about using strong regular coffee until later (I'll try that next time). I substituted 3/4 cup water for the coffee. I forgot to mix in the chocolate chips and had already put the cake in the oven, so I sprinkled them on top. They sank about midway for a semi-sweet creamy center - loved it! The cake was super moist.

Yum, yum! I LOVE this cake - chocolate is one of my fave flavors...of course, when I make cakes, I use applesauce rather than oil, egg substitute for eggs, and fat free sour cream and/or puddings. My family is always fooled by the taste!
