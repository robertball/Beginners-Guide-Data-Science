This is better than 5 stars! With only 24 hrs notice of making this ice cream I couldnt find peaches that were super ripe so....I used fresh blackberries! So good! It took about 8 cups of fresh to get the five cups puree (I actually just mashed them with my pastry blender leaving lots of chunks). Any fresh fruit would be awesome. You have to try this.

So rich, thick, and creamy!  Definitely better than store-bought!  The original recipe fills a one gallon ice cream freezer.  Use 1/3 of the recipe to fill a 1.5 quart freezer.  I have made it several times, always with rave reviews.  I had to substitute evaporated milk once for the whipping cream and it was still delicious!

I usually don't care for fruit ice creams, but this was fantastic. I only made a half batch and it is still a LOT of ice cream! I used splenda instead of sugar to cut down on the calories, and it was really good. Nice peachy flavor.

This is the BEST peach ice cream!!!  I usually don't care for peach ice cream, but I could not get enough of this.  I used Georgia Belle peaches, which was a great choice.

Excellent!  Only problem was on my part, wasn't able to find peaches that were ripe enough.  There wasn't a very strong peach flavor.  I am curious to see if anybody has tried frozen peaches??

This was really good.  My boyfriend and children loved, though I thought it to be a bit too sweet.  But that aside, it was good.  Thanks.

Since I have been getting lots of peaches from my neighbor and a co-worker gave me an ice cream maker I searched and found this recipe.  My kids never want to eat peaches but they raved about this ice cream and my husband and I thought it was very good too.  Will make it again many times!

This was one of the best ice creams I have ever had, better then haggan daaz!  It took minimal effort and the awards were to die for (well almost)

I have a cuisanart 2 qt. ice cream maker and did as a user suggested to minimize the recipe to 11 servings.  This did perfect, in fact I might have even been able to do 12 but no more.

I followed the directions to the tee for the exception of adding one fresh vanilla bean (split and scraped) and added freshly ground nutmeg (about 1/2 tsp I would say).

My peaches were very ripe being they are taken from our tree in the backyard.  But to make a more intense flavor I peel the peaches on top of my food processor bowl to catch the juices and simply sliced in half and took the pit out.  I then pulsed my peaches so that it was slightly pureed with some chuncks in it.  I added this mixture to the egg and sugar mixture I whipped in my Kitchen Aid.  I added the rest of the ingredients and blended on low until well incorporated.

After that, I poured into my ice cream maker and set the timer for 25 minutes.  I then scooped it out into a freezer safe container to freeze to the consistency of ice cream.

Thank you so much for sharing.  A definite keeper to hand down to my children and their grandchildren.

This came out very rich and the texture was perfect.  I halved the recipe and the amount was perfect for my ice cream maker.  I don't really like using raw eggs, so I heated up the sugar, half-and-half, and heavy cream to about 180 degrees F and tempered the eggs.  Then I took everything off of the heat and added the rest of the ingredients.  Chilled for about 4 hours in the fridge before putting it into the ice cream maker.  I will definitely make this again, perhaps with mango or berries.

I have made this recipe twice already. Both turned out great, way better than the ice cream in the store. Here is the measurement that I used for a 2-quart ice cream maker:

3 eggs,
1 3/4 cup sugar,
2.5 to 2.45 cups pureed peaches (2.45 cups will  give more fresh fruit favor but 2.5 would do ),
2 cup heavry cream,
1 cup half /half cream ( the 2nd time I used 2% fat milk, it still tasted good but less creamy ),
1 teaspoon vanallia extract,
1/4 teaspoon   salt,

I'm fairly experienced at making ice cream so when I read over the recipe it seemed like there was an awful lot of sugar for the amount of cream and half-and-half.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt, however, assuming the peaches must require that extra sugar.  But I still reduced it somewhat anyway. Rather than peaches  I used mango, kiwi (fruits I had on hand) and a smidge of coconut extract and was really looking forward to this!  I mixed it up, added the cream and half-and-half, gave it a taste and was SO disappointed to find it still too sweet for my taste.  I had no choice but to add more cream, which I knew wasn't going to hurt the ice cream, but would indeed affect (weaken) the flavor.  Thank goodness I tasted this before I churned it so that I could try to fix it!   While this ended up being rich, creamy and delicious since I had to dilute the mix with extra cream, it was hardly "peachy."

We all agreed: This was the best peach ice cream ever.  The only thing we did that the recipe didn't call for was this:  we prepared the recipe the night before, refrigerated the mixture overnight, then put in the icecream maker in the morning.  Unforgettable.

Hands down, this is a fabulous peach ice cream recipe. It is very smooth and creamy. The only thing I did differently was added two more peaches that were diced instead of pureed. It is a true, old fashioned ice cream....wonderful on a hot summer evening with friends!

Easy & Delicious! I used Egg Beaters because they are pasteurized. Peeling and pitting peaches is a pain--next time I might use frozen peaches instead...but the taste of fresh, ripe peaches is still better! I did use only 3 cups sugar with fairly ripe peaches and it was not too sweet and definitely not under sweet. I love that it's a no cook recipe too! YUMMY!

This is an awesome recipe!  I did make a slight change in that I cooked the mix to 160 degrees, then chilled it for two hours before putting it into the mixer/freezer.  Creamy and smooth, very good ice cream.

This is an excellent recipe due to the richness and creamy texture!  One thing for readers to know, there are pasteurized eggs in the shell that you can buy.  They are not stocked in every store, so you have to look for a store that carries them. But they are great to have because then you don't have to worry about eating raw eggs! I get them when I want to bake for my grandkids so that they can eat the batter!  Also great for ice cream that is not cooked.

This stuff is terrific!  I've never made ice cream before, and after reading all the comments on the homemade ice cream article, I made some changes that fit our budget and our Cuisinart ice cream maker better, and it turned out great!  I had it recalculate for 11 servings (to round out the eggs), used 1 cup sugar, 4 peaches, 2 cups heavy cream and no half&half.  I only puréed half the peaches and added the unpuréed ones in the last few minutes.  I also beat the eggs pretty well and then beat them quite a bit more when I added the sugar to get it kind of frothy.  It came out very rich and smooth and the leftovers froze up perfectly, no super-hard ice cream here!

The eggs in this are not cooked into a custard and 6 eggs is a lot. I could taste the raw egg with every single bite. My children ate it, but I did not. It had that gooey texture of raw egg and the flavour of raw egg. This filled a 1 litre container and six eggs is a lot, so no wonder I could taste it. I like it when the eggs are cooked into a custard a lot better.

Will definately make this recipe again!  Perhaps a little less sugar or a few peach chunks next time as the sweetness seems to outshine the peach flavor a little bit.  If you don't have an ice cream maker, freeze in a metal bowl, stirring occasionally.

Wonderful!  I used fresh Red Haven peaches...delicious.  I couldn't get the peel off of the peaches, so just left them on...didn't make a bit of a difference.  No need to peel them.  I left about half in small chunks...would probably puree more.  Overall, a wonderful, creamy treat!

This was very very sweet but DELICIOUS and so creamy! As a reviewer above suggested, I cut the recipe by 1/3 and it fit perfectly in my 1.5 quart ice cream maker.

I have another suggestion if the fruit isn't as tasty as it should be...if you have a recipe like this, where the fruit is so important, and if you possibly can, DON'T buy the fruit at your local gigantic-box EverythingMart grocery/shoeshine/laundry place.  Go to your local farmer's market stand.  That's where I got the peaches for this ice cream and it was soooooooo worth it!  My peaches were so ripe they practically peeled themselves.  This ice cream will be so many times better if you use quality peaches.    :)

I love this recipe, and so did my mom who ate a lot of it! The only thing I did differently was I left some small peach chunks. It was AMAZING!Oh, I also cut the recipe in half, b/c it was only for the two of us. GREAT!

I have not used this recipe myself. I just wanted to say that my recipe is the similar. I substitute EggBeaters for the raw eggs when feeding the young and elderly. Works perfectly.

One big problem with this recipe is that it measures peaches in units rather than in cups or ounces of prepared fruit.   Depending on the size of the peach, this can make a huge difference in the outcome.  Also, since sweetness of peaches varies tremendously, my suggestion is that you taste the product before and perhaps during freezing, to add sugar accordingly if needed.

I cut this recipe in half and it still  made too much for my icecream maker, so I made the 2nd batch the next day.  Not complaining, it was delish!  I did cook the milk and eggs as I think it makes it creamier.  I will make this again, such a good way to eat fresh peaches!

Kudos to you, Chris!  I took a chance on a $3 flea market ice cream maker from 1970-something, as well as your recipe.  I am thoroughly pleased with both!  This is very close to my dad's recipe for homemade peach ice cream, (which I haven't had since 1970-something!).  THANK YOU SO MUCH!  Muy excelente!

This is an awesome recipe. I've tried it with peaches, strawberries, and bananas. Because it's Fall, I tried pumpkin, which turned out amazing. I halved the recipe to 16 servings, instead of peaches, i used a can of pumpkin, 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice, half brown sugar, half white sugar and added walnuts (only because I didn't have pecans) about 5 mins before the end of the ice cream maker cycle. Easy and delicious!

Amazing.  I combined this recipe with a peach gelato recipe for two reasons:  I wanted a more intense peach taste (I had awesome peaches) and being pregnant I couldn't do the egg part raw.  My ice cream turned out AMAZING and intensely peachy.  Here are my alterations:  (1) I did not puree the peaches, I just peeled and chopped and let them sit out a few hours, occasionally mashing with potato masher, this kept some of the texture  (2) I only used 2 cups of heavy cream, and I used 2 cups of whole milk instead of cream.  (3) I used 4 egg yolks and an egg white (the gelato recipe called for only yolks), and only 1 cup sugar (the gelato recipe called for 1/2 cup sugar).  I stirred these together and gradually added the cream/milk mixture, which I had heated, whisking all the while.  I then transferred the egg/cream/milk back to the saucepan and heated until almost boiling, definitely steaming.  I put that back to room temp before adding the peaches and remaining ingredients, this hopefully killed the bacteria.   Amazing recipe.  I think the quality of the peach is key.

Made a half batch of this as the whole batch would have overflowed our ice cream freezer. VERY good. It is possible to just heat the mixture to 170 degrees to cook the eggs and then cool in fridge before making ice cream. This is helpful for those who don't have 'homegrown' eggs. Also a pastureized egg substitute will work as well.

This ice cream came out great! Be sure to use very ripe peaches for the most flavor. To ripen your peaches, place them in a brown paper bag a let them set on your counter for a day or two. Check them each day for softness and a sweet smell, then they're ready to use. I cut the peaches in half, then used a grapefruit spoon to scoop out the 'meat,' this was much quicker then peeling and chopping. I used 10 peaches, and only came out with 4 cups of puree, but it worked out fine. I used a 4 qt. ice cream maker, and the mixture came right up to the fill line - perfect! But, if you are looking for ann intensely peach falvor, this isn't the one for you, it is more of a peaches 'n cream taste, very subtle. Once the ice cream maker was done, the ice cream was more of the consistency of soft-serve ice cream, so yoo  probably want to freeze it for a firmer ice cream.

I have a Cuisinart Small Ice Cream Maker. It only make 1.5 quarts, NOT 4 like recipe calls. I was SO worried this recipe would not come out correctly scaling it down. I read x2 other reviews of scale down and I tried it. I scaled it to 11 servings except I used 4 peaches, not 3 1/2 as scaled recipe called for. Everything fit to a "T" inside my little machine, to the top PERFECT! What was more perfect was how it tasted when it was done. OMG-O-S-H, this ice cream was AH-MAZING! It brought me back to hand picked peach ice-cream that I made via a TURN crank on my grandmothers porch 32 years ago. I closed my eyes and was back there w one bite. My family, small kids, raw eggs OK, ate it up and BEGGED for more! This recipe is everything you want, simple, and simply delicious! Don't shy away because of raw eggs. Try this recipe and you'll agree w ALL these other reviewers that it's AMAZING! My take on fat-free....I use whole fat everything. Moderation is the key. There are more chemicals to make something fat free vs bad calories from eating something every now again. Enjoy this ice-cream, let it take you back to g'mas porch (minus the arm cramps from the crank) and SMILE.....I sure did! TY so much for sharing this! :)

Really wonderful!  Made it with incredible fresh peaches and I'm sure that helped but it was really creamy and delicious.  Will try to remember to chill the mixture thoroughly before putting it in the freezer next time to help speed the time.  Will most certainly make it again!

Oh yeah!  Good stuff here.  Left some peaches out and minced them and cooked them up with some of the puree and then added into the mix after it began to set up.....even better.

This is not only the best peach ice cream I have ever had, but one of the best ice creams I have had period.  EVERYONE who has even tasted it loves it.  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I cut the sugar down by 1/3, and 25% of the sugar used for I used brown sugar (1-1/2 cups white, 1/2 cup brown on a half recipe).  I also added a pinch of cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and fresh ground nutmeg.....FABULOUS!!!  We only have a quart size ice cream maker, so we used a half recipe, and it still filled the thing twice.  Definite keeper!

I took a tip from another reviewer and subbed almond extract. I added some freshly ground nutmeg and saved some peach slices to add to the mixture at the very end so that there were some chunks to give it more texture. So good! A big hit among everyone that I gave containers to.

Very disappointing!  We made this for my husband's work party and began freezing it 3 hours before we were to arrive.  It NEVER froze!!!  We continued freezing it an hour after we got there...still NEVER froze!  We sadly served peach milkshakes instead.  Most were very un-appetized by the idea and didn't try them.  We don't know what went wrong....we followed directions perfectly...very disappointing.

Just made this today for Father's Day.  It was awesome and everyone loved it!  It was the very first recipe I made in my new Cuisinart Ice Cream maker.  The machine only holds 1 1/2 quarts, so I halved the recipe.  I set aside some extra chopped peaches and added them at the last 5 minutes of the cycle.  Next time I'll go a little less on the sugar, just to see how it turns out.  But the overall consistency was rich and creamy and EXCELLENT!

My first suggestion on this recipe is to half the serving amount. Most home ice cream makers make 2 quarts ....... half of this recipe makes a little over 2 quarts. The flavor is really quite subtle and very nice. Vanilla varies in it's strength and mine is from Mexico and strong ... be careful that it doesn't overpower the peaches. I suggest using 6 peaches for half the recipe and be certain to skin them - even though that isn't mentioned. Good recipe!!!

Just a delicious recipe. As others suggested, I set the yield to 11, which was just right for the Donvier Ice Cream maker. I left the peaches in small chunks (didn't puree them), substituted 2 % milk for the half and half, and blend (10 % butter fat) for the whipping cream, and substituted almond extract for the vanilla. Just a great flavour. Easy to make. Thanks Chris.

this worked well with fresh mango.  also, i swapped the proportions of heavy cream and half & half to reduce the fat content slightly and it worked fine.  i agree with others that it would taste fine with less sugar.

BEST homemade ice cream EVER!!! Being from the South, I have tasted numerous homemade ice creams. This is the creamiest, most flavorful recipe I have ever come across. The no-cook recipe is so easy to "whip up" and makes a generous batch. If you have fresh peaches on hand (or even if you must make a trip to the farmer's market), this recipe is a "must try"!

Absolutely delicious!  I had very juicy peaches.  I was worried the ice cream would come out runny, but it didn't.  Followed the recipe exactly.  It was a bit too sweet, but heck, it's ice cream - we enjoyed it!  NOTE: Homemade icecream is always very soft right after making it.  Even 2-3 hours isn't enough to firm it up.  Best if it is stored in an air-tight container overnight for best (more firm) results!

This recipe is unbelievable.  I used small white flesh peaches from Fredericksburg (which took an hour to peel).  I peeled them and cut them over a bowl, to catch the juices.  When I halved the recipe (to make 1 batch in a normal ice cream machine), I needed just over 2 cups of the peach/juice mixture to get the right peach flavor.  As others have suggested, I did use slightly less sugar.  The other thing I did differently was temper the eggs to kill off any potential bacteria (since I have a one year old and am pregnant).  Fresh farm eggs wold be safe, but I don't trust the ones from the grocery store.  To do this, I mixed all of the ingredients EXCEPT the peaches in a sauce pan on the stove top and cooked JUST until the mixture reached 170f.  Doing this (cooking, cooling, and peeling tiny peaches) took a really long time, but it was SO worth it.  I don't know what peach recipe I used last time, but it was nothing compared to this.  Yum.

I'm thinking my ice cream machine doesn't work that well.  This recipe made something more like a granita than ice cream - and I did use 1/2 & 1/2 plus heavy whipping cream.  I did decided to peel all the peaches  before pureeing them - for a nice smooth consistency.  The taste was good, though.

I am not a fan of peaches or ice cream but picked this recipe out for a family dinner dessert item. What a huge hit, the texture of the ice cream was great and the peach flavor was just right.  I will make this again!

OUTSTANDING!  I made this with fresh, perfectly ripe, Fredericksburg (TX) peaches and this was by far the best peach ice cream I've ever had.  I cut the recipe in half to accommodate my 2 qt. ice cream maker and it worked perfectly.  I used this same recipe but substituted strawberry puree for peach puree and it turned out just as delicious.

I don't get it...followed the recipe to a 'T". NO flavor...Tasted like I froze up the cream and ate it. The consistency was weird, too. Peaches ARE very much in season right now, too... Very sad because I spent about 17.00 for the ingredients. What a great disappointment...

My 5 year old Emma helped me make this ice cream last night. It is delicious! The only warning is the recipe actually makes 2 batches for the standard size ice cream maker. I reccomend cutting the liquids in half. It's yummy!

It was way too sweet for my family, even though I put less sugar than the recipe indicated.  Also, I couldn't really taste the peaches.  Texture was unfortunate as well.  There were ice crystals in it, probably a result of not cooking it.  I'm sure the texture wasn't the fault of the ice cream maker, because I have made successful batches using other recipes before.

This recipe works great for coffee ice cream! just substitute (8) shots of Starbucks espresso and 8oz of Starbucks Coffee in place of the peaches (24 servings). I have made it several times with great reviews.  I have also used used fresh or frozen strawberries instead of the peaches and it was wonderful.

Excellent as-is.  Better when you substitute 3 TBS of half&half with 3 TBS peach schnapps.  If you do add almond extract (as one reviewer did) add two or 3 drops of it, no more.

This is a delicate dish.  The peach is there, but almost elusive.  If it isn't enough punch, you can add diced frozen peaches after the ice cream freezes.

"Cooks Illustrated" recommended the Krups ice cream maker that I have.  But it only allows for 1 quart of ice cream, and I didn't realize this.  Ice cream expands, so I wasted a ton of product (could have put it in ice cube trays and frozen it, though).

It froze perfectly.  My ice cream maker paddle makes a back-and-forth motion when the ice cream is done, so there's no guesswork.  My ice cream maker took 1/2 to freeze (probably longer than usual because of the Schnapps).

Perfect texture, taste and sweetness.

I made this recipe, but wanted more peaches in it, so I drained a can of freestone peaches, chopped them up and added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of butter extract. The result tasted like homemade peach cobbler..Very good recipe.

This ice cream is amazing.  I made quite a few changes suggested by other reviews.  I halved the recipe which was still too much for my ice cream maker.  Next time I would do a third of the recipe/change the calculations to 11 servings.  I used one mango and the rest peaches.  I used a potato masher in a glass measuring bowl to make it easier and a little chunkier.  I also changed the milk quantities to make it not so creamy.  I used 1 cup whole milk, 1 cup heavy cream, and 1 cup half and half.  Next time I will do as another reviewer suggested 2 cups half & half and 1 cup cream.  I also cut down the sugar a little to 1.5 cups.  I will definitely make this again.

The fresh peaches taste so good, and it's very rich! Next time I use very ripe peaches, though, I'll cut back on the sugar.

I LOVED this ice cream!!!  My family agrees that it's the best homemade ice cream we've ever had.  I was initially worried it would turn out a little strangley because it is mostly cream and no milk, and other recipes I've tried like that make little bits of butter or something.... but this one was GREAT! It turned out PERFECT and very smooth and creamy.  DEFINATELY a keeper! Thankyou!!!! :)

I read a short story in the summer by Bill Crider about a sheriff who loves peach ice cream. His description of the ice cream was so good, it made me want to try some. Alas, as we don't have easily available such the huge variety of flavours over here as you lucky guys in the US have, I would have to make one. I halved the quantity but must admit I used less sugar than the recipe called for. A half quantity of sugar is 350 grams but I used 250 grams of sugar. The only other change I made was to use nectarines as we don't grow peaches over here and have to import them. As a consequence they do not have quite the same depth of flavour and are often disappointing. Nectarines are also imported but seem to be more consistent in quality. The ice cream wasn't quite as strongly flavoured as perhaps I'd have liked but it was still cool, creamy and unctuous. Yum!

I have never rated anything here but have used AR often. *THIS* is the best, fastest, easiest ice cream recipe I have *ever* found. I cut it to 10 servings to fit in to my self freezing Cusineart ice-50BC ice cream maker. My wife ate a quart in the last 3 or 4 days with me helping a little. I want to try this base recipe for vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and any other fruit and such I can find. Oh and also I just used 2 cups of heavy cream. I didn't mess with half and half.

This recipe was way too sweet as others said. I suggest you cut sugar in half and then add more sugar as desired in between tastings, mixing well after each addition. I cut the recipe in half, but next time I will probably cut to 14 servings to fit my icecream maker. Cut calories by using, all half and half, instead of part heavy cream if desired. Had a good peach taste though. I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I will use it in the future but only with changes. I like to leave a few larger pieces of fruit instead of all pureed for texture...just big enough to tell it's a tiny piece of peach.

Fabulous!  I used Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste for the vanilla, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg to give it a peach cobbler ice cream taste.  It would have been great without the spices...just wanted a different taste today.  This will be my new homemade peach ice cream go-to recipe!

Very good recipe! The only thing that I did different was to pasteurize my eggs first to feel safer about raw eggs for my children. I used the method from the baking bites website.

Most kids will love this peach ice cream recipe because it is so sweet.  For adults, I would cut the sugar in half and include some chopped up peaches, in addition to the peach puree.  I think it also would be better if it had more of a peach taste, though this could have been due to the peaches we used - Spring Snow peaches... the first of the season.   We're going to try this recipe again with Elbertas and Georgia Belles, once they come in.  Overall, a good recipe!

I did not care for this recipe.  I'm sorry, but, ice cold peaches definitely lose their fabulous flavor.  What did help was the addition of GINGER, which always goes fabulous with peaches and enhances the flavor.  Still...it doesn't "cut it" for me. I used my own elberta peaches off my own tree and this is NOT a way to enjoy them.  THUMBS DOWN on this one...sorry.

Made this last night. Excellent consistency, but I could have used more of a peach flavor. The vanilla seemed to overpower it. I have some base left over, so I will add more peach puree before freezing it tonight. Overall, great recipe.

We have made a similar recipe to this for years and years.  It is without a doubt the best ice cream recipe there is.  If you can't find fresh peaches buy the package of frozen peaches, thaw them out and puree them before adding to the ice cream - you'll never be able to tell the difference.  Substitue strawberries, or any other fresh or frozen fruit - you will never use another recipe again.

This is THE BEST ICE CREAM THAT I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Peroid.  I did reverse the half and half and cream.  I used 2 cups of heavy cream and four cups of half and half.  I also cut the sugar to 3 cups instead of 3 1/2.  It was perfect.  The peach flavor was excellent!

I can't stop eating it out of the ice cream machine, and it's not even done completely haha! The flavor is out of this world! It's like an explosion of sweet sugary peachy goodness with every bite. mmmmm! I scaled the serving size down to 11, and used half 2% milk and half half-and-half in place of all the cream. Excellent:)

Very good. I  only used 3 cups of sugar & used strawberries instead of peaches.
I used 2 cups of cream & 4 cups half & half. We all thought it was great.

This was good and certainly easy. Does not need the salt - hard to distinguish the tangy from the salty taste.  I halved the recipe and it made a ton, would cut in half again next time for two people.

I made my first batch of ice cream following the recipe, but it was way too strong on vanilla. The second batch i added more peaches and less vanilla. A total hit!

Very good. A couple of suggestions: Temper the eggs after heating up the cream; taste test the flavor after adding one teaspoon vanilla--two teaspoons can be too strong if you're using a high-quality vanilla. Canned or bottled peaches work for this recipe, as do fresh apricots.

Unbelievable!!! Not only is it easy, it tastes divine. New family favorite. I'm going to buy fresh peaches and make some pulp to freeze so I can enjoy this in the fall-winter too!

Awesome! My first try at homemade ice cream and this was the perfect recipe.  Better than I ever remember from childhood.  Smooth and rich. My fresh peaches weren't that ripe or sweet so I cooked them in half of the sugar first and then puréed.   I did put the ice cream in the freezer to firm it up but the taste was fabulous either way.  I recommend you follow the recipe exactly because it works!  I did not cook the eggs and no problem at all. 
   I only made this because my husband had fond memories of making ice cream as a child.  I never liked the home made ice cream, always watery or just not that good, but this totally changed my mind.

Almost too sweet. My guess is you will have to reduce your sugar based on how sweet your peaches are. I'm giving it a 3 because it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.

I over-picked when I went peach picking and have been making a gazillion peach-inspired dishes for the last week. Thought I'd give ice cream a try and this had to be the easiest, fastest, most inexpensive and yummiest ice cream recipe ever! The only addition I made was adding a few teaspoons of tiny diced candied ginger left over from another peach recipe. I'm making gallons of this stuff to share.

Delicious!  I added extra chopped up peaches to give the ice cream some chunks.  It reminds me of the homemade peach ice cream I had when I was little.  Yum!

Very yummy! Not a bit left over!  I didn't have fresh peaches so I used a quart of some I had bottles, just drained most the juice off. I also didn't use the half and half since I had enough cream and it needed to be used. Turned out rich and creamy!

I was disappointed in this recipe. I could tell that it was too sweet for us as written (and as many of the 5-star reviews will also tell you), so I did cut back the sugar by a cup. The flavor is great after that change, but I also found the texture unfortunate. I wouldn't try this no-cook method again for a creamy ice cream. I'm in the process of melting this and re-churning it to see if I can get a better texture. Otherwise, it's really only good for shakes (which won't kill us). Thanks anyway.

Loved by everyone that tried it.  It was "the best homemade icecream I've ever had" was a very common phrase.  And it doesn't turn to rock in the freezer.

What a great tasting recipe! I cut the recipe in half and made with 2 cups of whipping cream and 1 cup of 1% milk (what I had on hand) and it came out peachy and delicious.

This is the best peach Ice Cream EVER!!!  I made it last year after the Knott's Island Peach festival left me with too many peaches to eat.  I needed to find the recipe so that I can try it with Strawberries.

Wow! Delicious!  I halved the recipe and used 4 cups peach puree, 3 eggs, 1.75c sugar, 2c heavy cream, 1c 1% milk, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4tsp salt.  It was still too much to fit into my 1.5 quart ice cream maker...had to make a double batch!  Delicious with "Apple Crisp II", with peaches substituted for apples.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make and will definitely make again when peaches are in season.

I would recommend letting the mixture sit for a few hours or even overnight before churning in the ice cream maker to get more flavor :)

This recipe was just too  sweet.  It had a very smooth texture, but I omitted the peaches and just made it as a straight vanilla ice cream...Plenty to make in a gallon ice cream maker, 3 cups of sugar is ok, 3 1/2 is just too dang much, next time I make it, I will only put in 2 1/2 cups then the rest too taste.  I wouldn't eat the ice cream as is, but add it to one of those foo foo drinks like  a pina colada...Jerseymaid ice cream is still my favorite...

Wow! Double Wow! I made this for my family and was almost recieved a standing ovation. Really creamy and delicious.  It made too much for my ice cream maker though.  I ended up putting half of the mix in the fridge and using it about a week later.

Great recipe!! I used fresh from the orchard peaches, splenda instead of sugar and 2 eggs and the equivalent of 4 eggs worth of egg beaters. Everyone had seconds - it is great.

first time ever making ice cream and had a ton of fresh peaches from my tree that had to be used. This was good and is a versatile recipe. I cut the recipe down to 6 servings for just the 2 of us so we can make it 2 more times. Not too crazy about the fact that there are raw eggs in this though....

YUM!  This is some amazing ice cream.  I halved this recipe and it still made a ton.  Followed recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  So happy peaches are in season right now because they made this taste awesome.  I also pureed with the skins on, and it makes very pretty darker flecks in the ice cream.

I made this as written and it was easy and delicious.  Fortunately, peaches are in season, so I taste tested 3 different types of peaches at the grocery...Locally grown (Texas), yellow (Georgia) and Donut Peaches.  I have to admit, I was very leery of the odd-looking Donut peaches, but they were the sweetest of the bunch.  Being closer to white, I did add in about 20% of the locally grown, yellow peaches to give my ice cream a more "peachy color".

I used 15 peaches total and mashed them in the Vitamix...keeping it slightly chunky.  

The result couldn't have been much better...very fresh and easy.  Not sure I can say much more, but if you are a peach ice cream fan, give this one a shot.  

I'll continue to use this recipe until I find one I like better - not because I don't think it's a great recipe, but like I suspect most of you are, I am always looking to find "the best" recipe.

Incredible! After two failed ice cream attempts I've finally found the perfect recipe. This was easy to make, tasted great, and even stayed delicious and soft after freezing. I will definitely be using this as a base for my future ice cream endeavors! Yum.

My first attempt at making homemade ice cream was a delicious success with this recipe!  I added some peach nectar to the peaches in the blender.  That was my only change and my family just loved it.  Perfect for a hot summer day!

I will usually only make vanilla homemade ice cream because I really don't want to be disappointed with something added, but this ice cream was so yummy!  I cut everything in half and there was still too much for my cuisinart counter-top ice cream maker.  So we'll have more tonigt!  Will not disappoint!

This is wonderful ice cream. I made it up last night, and it wouldn't seem to set. Finally, after running my ice cream maker in the freezer for an hour, it thickened up to milkshake consistency. I thought it might get better after sitting in the freezer for a night, and voila, this morning we had perfect peach ice cream.

This was so easy to make and came out tasting absolutely amazing!  I had hundreds of peaches from my peach tree that I didn't know what to do with.  This was an easy way to use some of them.  It's creamy and rich.  Maybe it was a little too sweet, but I'm not complaining.

This is the best ice cream I've ever had. I made it for the fourth of July holiday and my grandsons birthday. Why not he's a "peach of a kid". My 7 yr old grandaughter helped me. It was easy. The batch was a good size. The peaches I used were big and ripe. The end product was fabulous. I had more than five cups of puree so I added the little that was left and it was a amazing.

I cut the recipie in half and it turned out well. It needed more peach flavor and as one of the reviewers said to ripen the peaches in a paper bag.  I'll try that next time.

Excellent ice cream recipe. Just a couple of small changes: I cut the recipe in half, but I used 8 peaches and cut the sugar in half. There is a film that left on the spoon, but I didn't experience the film on the roof of mouth (from another reviewer). I was a great recipe, but I may cut back on the cream in the future.

I made this for a group of friends, none of which were crazy about it.  It is a very rich, heavy, ice cream.  It leaves a greasy texture on the roof of your mouth.  I will not be making this recipe again without reducing the heavy cream ALOT!!!

What is half and half cream and where can you get it?  I spent so much money just getting the ingredients, I could have just got some ice cream from the supermarket!  seriously.   But it is pretty cool to have fruit ice cream.

This recipe is great, It makes it so nice
when you can go back to your back yard
and pick the peaches when they are nice
and ripe. That way you can get all that
natural sugar.this recipe is so easy.
one of God`s little pleasures.....

I've made many recipes for peach ice cream but this is the best! It's creamy and has a good peach flavor.  I chose to cook the half and half and sugar mixture, then temper in the eggs. I cooked it about 15 minutes, cooled, then added the peaches and heavy cream. The recipe makes a lot and I had to do three batches in the ice cream maker.

This is a keeper!

I made it but reduced the sugar as others indicated. I only used 1 cup. I also simmered the dairy and tempered back to the eggs and brought back up to temp then cooled, added the peach puree and vanilla. Turned out great!

Very rich and creamy. Excellent texture and mouth feel. This recipe makes at least 5 quarts. Since I have a 2 quart Cuisinart ice cream maker I will cut recipe in half next time. And maybe cut a bit of the sugar as it a bit sweet for my personal taste.  I can certainly agree with other reviewers that this would be a good base recipe for other fruits.  I'm thinking mangos or very ripe persimmons. I also whipped the sugar and eggs very well and I think this contributed to the smooth texture.

Made it just as written except I'm not real keen on raw eggs so I substituted a 16 oz carton of pasteurized egg product. I had to spend about 10 minutes rummaging through the peaches at the grocery store to find enough that were really good and ripe but it was worth it. I've used many recipes over the years and this will be my "go to" from now on. Thanks for sharing..

Amazing! 
I only had 7 small peaches  so I added  a handful of fresh strawberries.  I left the peach skin on to add to texture. Everyone in my house loves this.

My husband exclaimed, "This is the best peach ice cream I've ever had!" We will definitely make this again when we have fresh peaches. I used whole milk instead of half and half.

I have a smaller ice cream maker so I cut it back to 11 servings as recommended by another reviewer.  It worked out perfect.  I added a little more peach puree than was listed and the results were fabulous.  Be sure to use the fresh, ripe peaches.

So delicious! The only I would do different next time, is to add more peach purée because the peach flavor could have been just a little stronger. Otherwise it was perfect!

Taste of Peach definitely comes through.   Everyone that I fixed it for definitely thought it was way too sweet.   I would scale it back by at least 1/2 cup if not 3/4 cup.

I substituted mango's for peaches and it is awesome!!!! Next time I would rather cook the egg mixture before adding in the milk just for protection from salmonella but other than that the recipe is awesome!!!! and I felt it was a little too sweet and I will adjust the recipe the next time I fix the ice cream!!!

Good thing I cut the recipe in half. I use my Kitchenaid ice cream attachment and it was just the right amount. Be sure when you adjust the amounts that the directions needs to be adjusted as well in reference to number of cups of peach puree. I used 5 peaches and it was exactly 2.5 cups.  Also, the recipe does not mention to peel the peaches and may think it is a given but it should say peel, pit and chop.  another tip is to chill the mixture before pouring into you ice cream maker.  It helps.  I was in a hurry and did not do this so it did not freeze as usual.  Very creamy, peachy and easy to make. Finding ripe peaches was probably the more challenging part.

Amazing! Truly amazing! I cut the recipe in half and it puffed up TO four quarts! The flavor was, must I say it, BETTER THAN peaches and cream! I had a bunch of people tried it and it almost took them to their knee's. Don't be scared to try this, it's easy and great!

WOW! This was great. This was my first Ice Cream try. It turned out PERFECT. I used fresh eggs from my chickens. The ice cream never got too hard like I've read about. It was smooth, creamy and full of flavor. For my second try, I used a custard type recipe for blackberries. The custard curdled and the whole thing was ruined. I'm returning to this recipe and substituting berries.

I halved the recipe and used whole milk in place of half & half.  I also heated the milk for a couple minutes in the microwave and then added it to the eggs & sugar with the idea of cooking the eggs just a bit.  I added the remaining ingredients and refrigerated them a couple of hours before churning.  Turned out great!

I have used this recipe for both fresh peaches and fresh strawberries.  My only complaint is that it gets a little icy, even after churning.  Maybe that comes from too much liquid in the recipe?  I have halved the recipe both times, as my ice cream canister does not hold that much liquid.  Leaving it to chill overnight has been a great third step to the simple first two.  I have also made the some changes to reduce fat and calories, but the taste still remains awesome.  For my halved recipe, I use:  3 eggs, 1.5 cups white sugar, 2.25-2.5 cups of fresh fruit, 1 cup heavy cream, 1.5 cups half and half, .5 cup skim milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract and .25 tsp salt.  After I puree the fruits and mix the other ingredients in a seperate bowl, I pour all into the blender to get a great concoction before pouring into the canister.  GREAT recipe!

Excellent. I cut the recipe in half so it would fit into my Cuisinart Ice Cream maker. Still had some left-over, so I let the kids make "ice cream in a bag" (put the ice cream mixture in a ziploc, and then put that inside a ziploc with ice/salt mixture...shake).   I liked that I didn't have to make a custard on the stove...  so this was so much easier.  I think next time I'll use 1-1/2 cups of sugar vs. 1-3/4 cups (half recipe), as it was a little too sweet.  Delicious nonetheless! Perfect summertime treat.

Brought this to a couple of 4th of July cook outs and it was a big hit. Even my friend's young son liked it, who is normally a picky eater. Recipe makes a huge batch. Had to divide it into thirds to run in the ice cream machine.

I live in Georgia and had a box of peaches delivered to my house by a friend. I immediately thought of making peach ice cream. We used this recipe and it was delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time is to add a little less vanilla extract. Other than that it was yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe. I cut down the amount of sugar and added sugared pecans.  We now call this ice cream Southern Delight!!!  I look forward to using this as a base for many more variety of ice creams.

Delicious and easy! I used a potato masher to crush the peaches and it worked perfectly.  Small chunks of peaches throughout the ice cream.

Very good recipe.   The peaches I bought weren't ripe enough, so I used strawberries and followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  Given the heavy ingredients, I was surprised at how light the ice cream tasted.

Wow!  This was one of the best ice cream recipes I have ever had!  It did make WAY too much for just my husband and myself so I would cut it in a quarter next time.  I followerd the advice of others and added almond extract and enjoyed the mild flavor.  Also, next time, I will leave in some "chunks" of fresh peach.

Made this with the kids, 1/2 batch, boy this makes allot! Taste wise, best ice cream I have made ever, just don't want to know how may calories. My GF from N. Carolina says it reminded her of home. That says something doesn't it?

Really yummy and very rich.  I will use less vanilla than called for next time- it almost overwhelmed the peaches (but it was still delicious).

This peach ice cream is delicious and easy to make.  My ice cream maker only holds 2 qts so I halved the recipe.  I only needed 4 peaches to get 2.5 cups of puree because the peaches were so big. I used almond milk instead of half and half.  I added some chopped peaches at the end of the cycle which was a bad idea because they froze.  Great recipe!

Followed the recipe to the letter, and the result was creamy, delicious peach ice cream. Will make a batch today, using this recipe, but w/ strawberries to serve at a July 4th party.  The ice cream was soft initially, but after an overnight in the freezer, it had the perfect consistency for scooping.

This was the first ice cream I’ve ever made and it turned out perfectly! One of my husbands fondest memories of his childhood was making homemade ice cream with his mom so I decided to make it for him for Father’s Day since he hasn’t had it for over 20 years. I think I only got one serving out of all of it and he ate the rest. He asked if I could make it again this weekend. Definitely a winner at our house. I loved the richness it has and even though I’m not a huge fan of peach, this might be my favorite ice cream now

I've made this recipe so many times. So creamy and delicious! Even the leftovers (if there are any) are still easily scooped after being placed in the kitchen freezer. I get requests for my peach ice cream every year at the family reunion. TIP: I like to buy fruit in season and freeze it to use for ice cream all year long.

Overall, this was a delicious ice cream. I gave it four stars instead of five because I heeded some of the other reviewers who said it was too sweet. I used fresh ripe Texas Hill Country peaches which are delicious and sweet. So, I set aside 1 cup of the called for sugar to add at the end if needed. It was not. So, 2 1/2 cups of sugar was plenty for me and my sweet tooth husband. I also set aside about 1/2 cup of chopped peaches, instead of puréeing all of them. When you have great peaches, the chunks add texture and highlight them.

This is super yummy and rich! I halved the recipe to fit in my machine and then only used a cup of sugar as my peaches were nice and sweet and it seemed like 1 3/4 cups would have been too much.

LOVED this ice cream!  I did cook the mixture on low until it was a little thick and just about to boil. Then I sat the pan in ice water until it cooled enough to put in the fridge for about 4 hours. I used 2 large packs of strawberries which is 4 lbs.  This made 8 c. of purée. It was perfect and had a beautiful pink color and great berry taste!  This recipe is definitely a keeper and we will try with other fruit.

The custard base is versatile.  I pasteurize (cook) it, unless I'm using eggs I got on the farm -- so long as you add the peaches after the base has cooled, there's little or no affect on flavour or texture.  I often add a bit of ginger or nutmeg, depending on my mood.  Most important -- this recipe makes 4 qts, about twice what most home ice cream machines can handle.  Adjust and enjoy.

Easy recipe!  I made 1/2 batch since my ice cream maker is small and I still had to do it in 2 batches.  I went off other's suggestions to reduce the sugar, but I wish I hadn't.  It could've used the full amount, in my opinion, but I guess that depends on the how sweet your fruit is.  Overall, a great base recipe that I will use again.

Made this using exact measurements but tempered the eggs as other reviews have stated. It turned out beautifully. One thing to note, this makes a large amount and I had to process half at a time for my smaller ice cream maker. That took 2 days because I needed to freeze the bowl again between batches. I will definitely make this again.

I made 1/2 recipe.  I used about half as much sugar as the recipe calls for because I don't like things that sweet, thus the 4 stars.  I also used my Mother's trick of blending hard boiled eggs into the mixture which works perfectly in any ice cream, homemade mayo, hollandaise, etc.

This makes a huge amount of ice cream. Because I was short on ripe fresh peaches I halved the recipe & it was delicious! It's rich (but not too rich) & creamy. I wanted to find a recipe that didn't require cooking but still used eggs. This definitely fits the bill. I'd recommend it for any fruit!

I was a little nervous with the raw eggs in it but the ice cream is delicious.  The recipe makes well over a gallon so I had to freeze it without the ice cream maker.  It may be the best peach ice cream we've ever made.

This was my first time making homemade ice cream, and I did it without an ice cream maker.  I used the "freeze & stir" method & it (surprisingly, lol) turned out wonderfully! It was oh so creamy & delicious! The only reason for leaving off that 5th star is simply that I didn't find it to be all that "peachy." There was a hint of peach, but mostly just cream. I was just expecting a more profound peach flavor. I used 11 ripe/juicy/fragrant peaches. It kinda irks me when people give a star rating to a recipie after making changes to it- but I followed it exactly aside from adding the extra peach. Maybe using an ice cream machine leaves bigger chunks of fruit? Not sure. At any rate, it is yummy! My husband & son clearly don't mind it not having more of a peach taste- all I've heard since making this is them raving about it and coming up with different flavors & things to eat it on! ?

This recipe is incredible! I halved the recipe (using 2 cups sugar).  I used 4 super ripe, very large peaches, (unpeeled) and added about 1 tsp. lemon juice before I puréed them. I also didn't have half-n-half so I ended up using about 2 2/3 cups heavy cream and 1/3 cup 2% milk.  Pure peachy perfection.

Peach Ice Cream is always tricky as getting that peach flavor is not easy.  This makes a LOT of ice cream so I made it in batches. This made a very smooth Ice Cream but I put the eggs and sugar over a hot water bath to help protect against the raw egg issues that sometimes occur. No problem there.
 I added chunks of peach as one reviewer did along with the puree. I added some almond extract and don't forget the salt. 
Still not what I was looking for but it was very creamy and smooth.

I will make this again.  Admittedly, it was VERY sweet as other reviewers indicated.  However, it is ice cream!   I also think that the intensity of the peach flavor is dependent upon the quality and ripeness of the peaches.  I may try canned puree in the future to see if I can replicate this when peaches are not in season.

This was very good. I didn't go exactly by the recipe. I used 1/2 fresh peaches and half canned peaches. I also heated the whipping cream, the half and half, the sugar, and the eggs to 180 degrees, stirring constantly. I cooled it in the refrigerator, and made the ice cream the next day. My grandchildren were eating it and I didn't want to take any chances with raw eggs. I will use this recipe from now on with all my ice cream.  Just using  different fruits or  add-ins each time.

Absolutely delicious and oh-so-easy!  Another reviewer suggested using 1/3 of the recipe for smaller, 1.5 qt freezers and it was perfect!  The possibilities are endless with this recipe!  Next up - cherry chip!

This recipe, is way too sweet.  It is rich and creamy, but, if anyone else decides to make it, I strongly recommended adding a small amount of sugar at a time and tasting before adding the next lot.

So delicious! I halved the recipe so it was the perfect quantity for my Cuisinart. I used 1/2 cup less sugar and warmed the cream slightly so the sugar dissolved. I used 3 cups of pureed peaches with the skin on and it was creamy and peachy! Definitely a keeper!!

I used fresh cow milk (~35% milkfat) in place of the half and half), and cut out 1 cup of sugar, and this turned out perfect!  So smooth and creamy and delicious.  3.5 cups of sugar is way too much if you are using ripe peaches.

I had 5 beautiful juicy peaches but they only made 4 cups of puree.  The ice cream came together easily and after 4 hours in the freezer was just starting to harden around the edges.  It did not have much of a peachy taste, maybe due to the lack of enough puree, and my husband thought it tasted a little icy.  I will try a custard base ice cream next.  This was just ok.  Oh, I halved the recipe to make 2 qts which is what my kitchenaid ice cream maker holds.

So delicious! I had to half the recipe to fit in my machine and when I did that I used 1 cup of sugar because my peaches were so sweet. Also only chopped them in the blender so they were still a bit chunky and we loved it!

This was my first time making ice cream, so I did a lot of research beforehand. I didn't have many peaches, so I halved the recipe and still made over 2 quarts after it froze! Some tiny changes I made: I only used a cup and a half of sugar and added 4 tablespoons of peach preserves and a dash of honey to the egg mixture. I also took someone else's suggestion and added about a fourth teaspoon of nutmeg for some spice. Even though we used ice cubes instead of crushed ice, it still turned out creamy and smooth and it tasted great!

Great icecream! Everyone loved it. Followed recipe exactly as written. Had no problems. My peaches were very ripe and the icecream had a very good peachy flavor. Will definitely make again. Great summer dessert!

This was my very first ice cream making experience.  I cut the recipe in half because I was unsure if it would turn out well.  Instead of fresh peaches (my local grocery store had peaches the size of plums & they didn't look too great) I used frozen peaches which I defrosted and then pureed.  I also added 1/2 a tsp. of cinnamon to add a little flavor to it.  I love peach recipes but it always seems like it’s too bland.  I agree with other reviews about it being too much sugar, so next time I'll probably use a little less.  Overall I love the outcome with my creation!

I used only half of the cream called for (b/c that's all I had on hand) and it still came out fabulously!  I did add some chunky pieces of peach to the puree just for personal preference.  Very sweet and yummy!

This recipe is awesome! We substituted strawberries because we already had them at hand. One problem was that it was difficult to puree the fruit, but threw some of the half-and-half in there to help the blender do its job. We made white chocolate fudge to put on top. We call it our "Strawberry Cloud" dessert now.

While I would give the IDEA of peach ice cream five stars (I do adore peach ice cream), this particular recipe is only so-so.  It's waaay too sweet, and I like very sweet things.  Also, while I halved the recipe, my five peaches produced five cups of peach (which is the amount in the whole version), so be aware of that.  I also would have added bigger chunks of peach for textural variety.  This is yummy, sure, but it doesn't do peach ice cream justice!
