This dish was fantastic.  I can't speak to its authenticity, but it was delicious and that's pretty much what counts for me.  I found the spiciness just right and I think it clearly lends itself well to variation, which is always nice.  The only super minor change that I made from the directions was to sautee the carrots with the onions because I wanted to make sure they got soft because my husband isn't a fan of carrots, so if I can hide their texture he doesn't mind.  Clearly though, doesn't really effect the dish overall.    Loved it!

I have spent time in many countries, living and visiting and I make a lot of ethnic food, but this was very strange tasting.

Not bad as is...I lived in Malaysia for 3 years and cooked this as well as ate it in many Mamak shops.
There are minor differences between each shop but mostly the differences I see are in Malaysia they use; chili sauce (think of a very sweet spicy ketchup) as well as ketchup, fish cake, thick soy sauce. You can use spaghetti for the noodle. I never had peas or corn in any I ate, however I don't see a problem with adding them.

Actually, this isn't a review, it's a question about the recipe. Is the chili sauce sambal oelek, which is Southeast Asian, and which is really, really hot, or something like Heinz chili sauce, or something else completely?  Thanks!
