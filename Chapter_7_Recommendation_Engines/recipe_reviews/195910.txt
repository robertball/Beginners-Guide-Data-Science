We are new to sushi and only have had it at a restaurant. I made it for the first time for New Year's Eve. DH, a man of few words, thanked me for making it and praised "the one with the salmon." If he had that much to say it is automatic 5 star recipe! I already had the rice prepared when I found this recipe. I was a little hesitate of the ingredient combination but it turned out great. We will have it again soon with no changes!

We live in Japan and know our sushi!  This was an amazingly easy, delicious recipe that my 9yo daughter and I had tremendous fun making together.  Thank you for the step-by step...I learned some things about rolling that I didn't know before.  Excellent directions, excellent meal!

Yummy and easy. I was looking for a recipe to use up the smoked salmon I made earlier in the week. This was perfect!  My bad cuz I was out of cashews...but I did get a cute Valentine's Day picture of it :) Thanks for sharing!

Excellent receipe and combo suggestion. You turned me into a real pro sushi maker with my first attempt. The only thing I did differently is I made perfect sushi rice recipe for the rice.
