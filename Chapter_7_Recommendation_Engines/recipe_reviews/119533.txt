I wanted to add a footnote to my review as I wrote it months back.  I did put this out on my daughter's wedding dinner buffet and it went over extremely well.  The serving size adjuster with the allrecipes site allowed me to take this up to 300 servings and it still came out delicious.  Right now, I'm passing out the recipe to several who asked for it and you can't get better praise for a dish than that.  I just wanted to add that this is a dressed up way to serve corn that doesn't take lots of effort and the flavor return is big.
*Easy, flavorful, and wonderful!  Loved by the entire family and was decided to add this to daughters bbq wedding reception buffet table.  I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I subbed dried parsley for the fresh with good results.  After cooking the corn in water, I drained off the extra water before adding the butter and seasonings.

Great way to perk up a standard side dish! My husband loves corn and this was nice way to give it some pizzaz for once as he just like it with butter. I used a "steam in bag" and just eyeballed the rest -  easy and delicious...

This is absolutely delicious. Once I'm done cooking the corn I leave it in the hot pan and add the butter and herbs. I've found just letting it sit brings out the flavor even more. A great sidedish!

I don't understand the huge portion size in the recipe, and even when I halved, then quartered it, there is still too much corn.  Regardless, I cooked the amount of corn I normally would, added a bit of butter, and a shake or too of all the spices above and it was delicious.  The combination of the ingredients taste fresh and blend wonderfully. Everyone gobbled it up and it was the first to go.  Thank you!!!

This was to die for!! I loved it.  I cooked it on the side to a mangolicious tilapia dish I found on this site.  It seemed to carry the Caribbean theme.  However I like it so much I think I will try this with BBQ.  Its a definite keeper.

Update: I now use Penzey’s “Mural of Flavor”, in place of the separate herbs. Fabulous! 
Great recipe to dress up plain ol'corn!  My family really liked it and said "mmm, good corn Mom, what did you do?" I only used 2 T butter and poured the melted butter into the herb mixture and let sit for a couple minutes before tossing it into the corn. I used dried herbs  - still it was really good:)

I made this recipe as directed and my family just loves it.  My husband said this would be good with grilled Chicken.  I served it with Scalloped ham and potatoes and I thought it was a great side.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it! Will be making this delicious corn side dish again for sure! Didn't change a thing and it turned out just fabulous. The herbed flavor is a really nice change from the norm & the blend is perfect. Thanks for sharing this great recipe! :)

What a wonderful way to liven up corn – with butter and fresh herbs! This is a great blend of flavors and a really nice change from the normal boiled corn. Thou we love corn, twelve cups is a lot for my family so I scaled this down to suit a couple of people plus I used all fresh herbs, added one garlic clove ( in place of garlic powder),  fresh ground black pepper and Hawaiian sea salt. Once this was done I let it sit to allow the flavors to meld through. This was easy to prepare with absolutely delicious results! I served this with rice and it paired perfectly with, “Ham and Pineapple Kabobs,” also from this website. I would definitely make this side dish again.

Great way to dress up corn. I really liked it, but since I don't personally like the taste of thyme...I will leave it out next time.

I am so glad I found this recipe again.  I made it when I subscribed to Taste of Home, but lost the issue the recipe was in.  This is great for Thanksgiving, a pot luck, or BBQ when you want something a bit different than plain old corn.  So yummy.

Easy, quick & tastes very good.  Adjust the spices as you enjoy.  Would be good to use for a funeral luncheon or hunger ministry.  I always cut it down to about 2 cups of corn when I make it for my family and that is plenty.

I was looking for a recipe that would flavor otherwise boring corn and I found it!  I followed the recipe exactly and next time might add slightly less salt.  It was really good and had almost a ranch-dressing flavor to it.  Loved it and will use as often as I can, maybe I'll even experiment with other herbs and spices.

This was so good, and I was really surprised how much a few herbs improved the flavor of the (already good, but kinda boring) corn.  This was a hit at my family Thanksgiving, and I've since made it at home several times.

This was excellent, everyone loved it!  I will definitely be making it again.  I used 'canned' corn, drained after heating and then added the butter/spices and let simmer for the 4 to 6 minutes.  Yum!

This is a really good and easy recipe.  I don’t make 12 cups but I have made the recipe as written otherwise.  If you don’t have fresh parsley you can substitute the dried parsley.  I have made it both ways and couldn’t tell a huge difference.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this for Christmas dinner at a friends house, all 18 people loved it - several asked for the recipe.  It had more of a garlic flavor than I expected, but it was a very tasty and a great way to make "just corn" a whole lot better!

10 stars!! This was so good  I used one good size bag (forgot to notice how many ounces) and it measured about 8c, so I reduced the butter to 5tbsp but kept the seasoning the same. Everyone really loved it!! I will definitely have this again!!

I scaled this down and had to sub about half a cup of peas for the corn. I left out the thyme and am glad I did. I think it would have been over seasoned with it. Great way to jazz up frozen veggies. I will try this again without the thyme but in the microwave next time. Served as a side for beef and noodles with a spinach cherry tomato radish salad

My daughter cut this recipe in half, and served it with Lasagna. It was the perfect compliment, and there was not one kernel left over. Yum!

This was easy to make and tasted good also. I only added 2 tbsp of butter and it tasted just fine to me. I think 1/2cup would have been way to much. My husband thought green chiles  would be a good addition to this next time. Very simple way to cook corn without spending a lot of time cooking.

I took this to a friend's cookout. It was really good. I wasn't expecting a lot. I mean, it's frozen corn. Someone else said it's better after it sits for a while, and they were right. Letting it rest after cooking really allows the flavors to meld. I got a lot of compliments on this! I followed the recipe almost exactly, just reduced the butter by two tablespoons.

This was quite good, and sooooo easy.  Cut it back to 4 cups of corn and scaled back seasoning to 1/3 as well.  Used fresh herbs except for dried dill, and the flavor was great.  Only used 2 tbls of butter, and it was plenty.  Thanks for this one.  I'll use it often!!

Pretty good! While I had hoped for a tad richer (i.e. buttery tasting) dish, this was quite yummy nonetheless. I LOVE those packages of frozen corn in butter sauce - the corn is sweet and the butter sauce is rich, artery clogging and TO DIE FOR! With a little tweaking, I'm sure Edna's recipe could be just as indulgent. What advantage this has over my favorite frozen corn is the WONDERFUL herb flavor. At first glance, it seems as if the herb combination would NEVER work, but it does! Another plus? This takes no time at all to prepare and accompanies most any entree! If you haven't tried this yet - DO (trust me)! Thanks for sharing, Edna! :-)

This recipe is wonderful - a HUGE hit at the Thanksgiving potluck with about 50 people.  I made it exactly as stated, except I used all dried herbs.  Measured them out into a small ziploc baggie the night before.  Then while the corn was cooking in a big pot, I melted the butter in a small pan and added the spices.  I crushed up the parsley a bit with my hands first (less for picky kids to complain about).  Let the herbs sit the butter a few minutes to flavor the butter before adding to drained corn.  YUM, YUM!
The only issue I had with this recipe was the PORTION size, and here is how I solved it.  Buy the amount of corn you want to cook. Then look on packaging for how many cups of corn that is.  Then keep changing the number of portions on the calculator, until the amount of corn (roughly) matches your amount.  Then you will know how much butter & spices to use.  For example, for 50 people, I bought 6 one-pound bags of corn.  From the packaging I figured it was around 26 cups of corn.  I adjusted the calculator to roughly match 26 cups, which said it was 22 portions.  But it fed 50 easily, with many people having seconds.  Hope this helps someone...

Very yummy!  I do think the seasonings would have been off if I made this with 12 cups of corn.  I did about 2-3 cups using almost the same measurements and mine was good.  Also added in a little black pepper.  Thanks!

I've made this several times for my family and we love it. I usually triple the amount of dill weed because I love the taste. I'll throw in oregano (when I don't have italian seasoning) and some other simple spices, like coriander, when I want to change things up. It's a great basic I'll use for a long time!

Fresh and easy.  Definitely recommended.  I didn't have any dill on hand and I used all dried spices (used 1 teaspoon of dry for every 1 tablespoon of fresh) and it was still delicious.

VERY, VERY Good recipe. My family loved corn this way  The herbs really woke up the usual frozen corn meal.  The savory herbs were spectacular.

We really enjoyed this.  I made it with fresh corn instead of frozen.  I adjusted the seasonings based on the amount of corn I yielded from 8 ears of corn (8 cups of kernals).

Made this tonight for 25 people for Easter, and it went over very well. Not much leftover, but I will enjoy the remainder tomorrow! I thought the amount of salt seemed like a lot so I just put in 1t. instead of the 2 and it was perfect. Will lower the number of sevings and make this for dinners for just my immediate family in the very near future. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Edna!

I cut this down to serve 2 with the serving calculator. It was perfect! I didn't have Italian seasoning so I added a little ground oregano. We loved it!!! I will also make this sauce for cooked carrots in the future.

Quick, easy corn dish. As a side for just two, I used a couple of sprinkles of everything on two cups of corn, and it was wonderful. I'll definitely make this again.

I enjoyed it, but my kids are too used to plain veggies.  They thought the spices tasted strange & that it was too buttery.  How can anything be too buttery??? I don't get it either.

This was delicious but it could be better. I added the juice from half a lemon and it was great!  It gave it the extra zing I was looking for.

This corn is great. It's really easy to make, and tastes so good- a great way to dress up corn. I don't know how many cups of corn I used, I just heated up 3 bags of frozen corn and added the butter and seasoning.

EXCELLENT!! My picky husband & daughter, along w/her friend, who happened to be over that evening, LOVED this corn. All of them had a 2nd helping and then I ate the left overs for lunch the next day. I also added a little chicken broth to the corn as it cooked. Very good!!!

What a great way to jazz up regular corn!  I had a bag of frozen corn that already had the butter added to it.  I popped that in the microwave and then add the seasonings to it.  So good and easy!

This was a nice, different way to prepare corn.  I cut the recipe in half, but I only used about 2 T. butter and cut the amount of dill in half.

Loved it! In fact, I wanted to take a picture of some leftovers, but my BF got to them before I did... I used about 2 Tbspn Earth Balance and the corn that you steam in the bag. This will definitely be a regular on my table!

This is wonderful!! I only made half a recipe since I was serving just my family of 5.  I followed the directions mostly but only used 2 Tbsp. of butter.  I also used corn that we froze this summer.  My husband and kids raved :)  I will be using this recipe again.

Very nice way to spice up corn.  I've served it when we've had lots of guests over and it always disappears.  I think you can cut down on the butter and not miss anything.  When I double the receipe, I use 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons (instead of a full cup of butter) and that works quite fine.  I probably use about 5-6 tablespoons butter instead of the entire 1/2 cup when making it as written.

This was great, the only lack of 5 stars is because it is frozen corn, so maybe frozen corn it would have five.  We used smart ballance instead of butter, healthier and yummy.  This is good, quick, and my handsome prince loved it.

Yum!  What an easy way to zip up the corn.  I used Italian flat leaf parsley & used fresh minced garlic instead.  Every bit of it was gone.  This is a great recipe & I'll make this again.

The addition of herbs really dresses up the flavor of plain old corn. I cut the recipe in half and steamed the corn in the microwave. I also melted the butter in the microwave then stirred in the herbs and let it sit for a couple minutes before adding to the corn. One recommendation, watch the salt, especially if you use salted butter. It was too salty for our taste so next time I will cut the amount of salt in half or leave it out altogether.

I used canned corn because I tend to like it better than frozen. Just drain after heating and omit the water called for in the recipe. I also omitted the dill. Turned out great!

Very good and super simple.  I scaled back on the amount of corn a little bit.  12 cups of corn feeds way more than 10 servings.  But kept all other ingredients the same.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  Everybody loved it and most asked for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make this one again! Thanks!

Yummy!  I think the fresh parsley made this.  Used an herb mix I had in the cupboard instead of measuring everything out.

If you like corn this gives you a good twist on it, Just be careful to measure well otherwise you ruin a really good thing.

Made this for my hubby and I on Thanksgiving. It was a little too aromatic for my taste. As a side dish, it felt like the herbs were overpowering the main dish. If you like the taste of these spices, it's a great recipe for you (I now know my hubby doesn't like thyme). It's a great basis though to try to make a Herbed Corn recipe of my own, so I am thankful for posting the recipe. :)

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. The herbs were a little too strong for me. I made a second batch and cut the recommended herb ingredients in half, and in my opinion it tasted much better. Good recipe, just add the herbs to your liking.

I knew that I wanted a corn side dish with the BBQ chicken. What I wasn't expecting was for the corn to upstage the main dish so much. Even without fresh parsley, dill weed, and thyme, the corn was so flavorful and delicious! I'm making it again tonight!

This was so easy to make. It was something different to bring to my sons house for Fathers Day dinner.  It was a big hit with everyone and his In-Laws, who are  gourmet cooks. Easy to make ahead, and take to dinner, then just keep warm in the oven.

Very good! I didn't have any thyme, so I just omitted that, but kept the recipe the same otherwise (other than scaling it down). This recipe is a great way to dress up frozen corn and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I cannot believe how good this corn is. I had a boring box of frozen corn w/ butter to use and decided to give this a try. Good decision. I fried up in a pan leaving out the butter the recipe called for. Will be making again.

I used canned corn, and I didn't measure the herbs, i just kind of threw in the herbs listed and guessed on the proportions based on the recipe. This was delicious! What an easy way to dress up corn. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

It tastes just like it says, like "herbed corn". It was a good change from the normal non herbed corn and I would likely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Made this corn with smothered chicken breasts and creamy twice baked potatoes from this site.  My 11 year old boy cousin ate every bit of this before he even started on the rest of his plate.  Now that's amazing!!!

Very good. Better than just plain ole corn. We didn't have all fresh herbs, but probably would give this a 5 if fresh herbs were used next time.  Scaled down for 3 servings.  Our kids asked for 2nds, which doesn't happen with the plain corn. I had 3rds.

This was actually very good. A nice way to spruce up plain old corn. I used canned and didn't add all of the spices as it seemed to be a bit much. I think it might have been overpowering had I added the full amount, but as it was, it was very tasty.

It is exceptional and gives a little pizazz to a can of corn.  This is our family's favorite way to have canned corn (the recipes calls for frozen corn but we just use canned corn).

I thought that this was really good for how easy it was.  I only made 3 cups of corn since there were only two of us and so I just added a sprinkle of each of the spices.  The flavor was good, and it was a great way to spruce up plain old frozen corn.  I will definitely be making this again.
