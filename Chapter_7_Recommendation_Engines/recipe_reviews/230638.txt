Excellent, fast, easy recipe!  I didn't use the butter as I wanted to make it healthier so I used olive oil and lemon pepper seasoning.  This is great to make during the week.

I can't find the pre-mixed seasonings so I did my own thing. To make the sauce I used a small amount of olive oil (maybe 1 tbsp), the juice of 1 lemon and 1 lime, and some Lemon Pepper seasoning I had from my local Savory Spice Shop.

This is my go-to recipe for a fast pasta dish after work when I want to cook something tasty and good for me.

Very delicious! I adapted it a little bit because I didn't have everything. I used lemon pepper seasoning and melted butter. I also used a different pasta.

My family liked the flavor, however we all agreed that it was way too much lemon and pepper.  In an attempt to tone it down a bit, I mixed some cornstarch with milk and made a white sauce.  This seemed to help a bit but it was still too strong for my family.  I will definitely try the recipe again and start off with using 1 squares of the Saute Express instead of the 4 that the recipe calls for.

Tasted ok, a hint if spiciness. My 4 year old liked the shrimp only, but my 2 year old only liked the pasta. May try again with the garlic sauté express or mix both.

Love this dish!  I make a variation of it during preparation for my teenagers who don't like shrimp (replace with grilled chicken strips).  It's a dish they continue to request as part of our menu.

My husband told me not to lose this recipe, although it is so easy to make that I'm not too worried about that happening.  I used well drained frozen spinach, but it was a little difficult to break up the chunks in the pan.  One change I will make the next time is to sprinkle the cheese on top and let it melt, rather than stirring it in.  Parmesan does not melt the same as other cheeses; instead it tends to clump with the spinach.

I did oil and lemon instead of the cubes, subbed kale for spinach and added yellow squash. It was amazing.

I didn't have spinach, but I had leftover cavatappi, some frozen shrimp and shredded Parmesan. This is delicious! I will definitely be making this simple and quick meal again.
