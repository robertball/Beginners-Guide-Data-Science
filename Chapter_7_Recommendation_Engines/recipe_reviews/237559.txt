This is a delicious drink for any time of the day.  I omitted the dates since I don't keep them on hand.  I used ice cubes instead of frozen pineapple.  I also used mixed berries (I already had mixed in the freezer) instead of black berries.

I had to add 1/3c water to this to get the blender to chop up the dates and blackberries.  But regardless, I thought it had a kind of a "sickly" sweet flavor to it.  I did use almost twice as much kale (had to use it up), so that may have contributed to the issue, but I wonder if it was actually the vanilla extract.  I would leave that out.
