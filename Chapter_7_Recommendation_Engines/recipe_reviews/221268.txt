Yet another amazing recipe by Chef John! 
Instead of making one large Pavlova, I used an ice cream scoop and made individual little rounds. The recipe yielded about 18 by using the scoop. After I scooped them onto the parchment lined baking sheets, I turned the scoop over and made a little well for the berries to sit in.
I also sliced my strawberries because they were HUGE and leaving them whole wasn't an option.
Other than that I made as is. Delicious and perfect for summer time. My kids were surprised and excited to discover the marshmallow texture inside. I highly recommend this recipe, so simple and pretty. Would be great for a luncheon or entertaining.

Made this tonight with no modifications and it turned out great. I've never had pavlova before, and found it to be a perfect warm weather dessert. The video was extremely helpful with getting the consistency of the egg white mixture just right. I topped it with the whipped cream in this recipe and sliced strawberries (so as to get a small, hassle-free piece of strawberry in every bite :) ). Made this for 2 people, and we demolished all but 1/6 of it.

Fantastic dessert!  It's like nothing I've tasted before.  Be sure to wait a full hour for this to cool - I got anxious and rushed this part; I think my Pavlova would have been a tad taller had I waited the full cooling time.  The cream also ended up melting some and so berries weren't stable...  Also, if you watch the video, beating the whites by hand is noble but unless you want to spend about 45 minutes doing it, use a mixer!!!!

Followed recipe and it came out fantastic. Video was very helpful, and also pretty funny. I didn't crack the surface-- didn't see the need for that. Instead of dotting the top with berries, I macerated some strawberries & raspberries in sugar, and then reduced the juice down to a syrup, and grated a little lime zest into it. Once syrup cooled, I poured it over pavlova & whipped cream.

This recipe is perfect. I wanted to make this dairy-free, so I whipped up some coconut cream with 1tsp vanilla and a bit of powdered sugar instead of using regular whipped cream. It was delicious! Better than dairy whipped cream in my opinion. The coconut flavor combined with the meringue and fruit made this dessert so yummy and refreshing.

Recipe holds! Even on a Northwest rainy day, when I can almost never get meringues to stand.  Used leftover eggyolks to make a vanilla pastry cream for the top instead of the whipped cream. Delicious!

Wonderful.  I used mixed fruit: strawberries, blueberries, peaches and kiwi instead of just the strawberries cause that's what I had.  My guests love it and we ate the whole thing up.

This made a delicious pavlova. The recipe was very easy to follow (the video was quite helpful). I did not put any sugar in the whipped cream, as I felt the meringue was quite sweet. I also added some lemon curd between the meringue and the whipped cream. It added a lovely tart contrast to the sweet meringue. We will definitely be making this again.

I made this just as stated in the recipe, and it is a beautiful dessert, however, the pavlova is just too sweet for our liking.

This is a good recipe, although I suggest taking the egg whites further than ribbon stage. They need soft peaks before adding the sugar mix. Also, adding the sugar very slowly in a constant stream while mixing on high will make for a much lighter pavlova and will keep it from cracking so much. I also ran my sugar and cornstarch through a blender to create a fiber powder. I made one exactly as stated, then one with the changes I mentioned above and it was almost twice as big as the first and had only one crack. This is a very sweet pavlova but I topped it with slightly sweetened whipped cream and a raspberry sauce that cut the sweetness and really brightened the dessert. The raspberry sauce is a small container of berries puréed then pushed through a mesh, 1 tablespoon sugar and boiled down for about five minutes, then cooled.

Perfect. Will use this recipe again and again. 
Next time I think I may double the recipe and see how that goes. This recipe as it is generously fed 3 adults and a child.

An easy and elegant recipe that I served for Easter dessert. My whipped cream and strawberries were sliding off the meringue so I cracked it like John shows in the video to help the berries stay on he meringue. My guests raved about this dessert, and it might be a new Easter tradition!

Delightful! A huge hit for Easter today.  I followed the recipe as directed and it turned out perfect.  One son said "like eating a lightly sweetened cloud of yum" Thanks for another hit, Chef John.

these are amazingly light and delicious.  I've never had Pavlova before and absolutely loved it.  it's sweet, crispy, and not overly sweet.  the skill level was hard but not overly difficult.  a perfect dessert for a light meal.

I would make this again, it has excellent flavour. But it is very crumbly and is hard to pick up. Does anyone have any recommendations to fix that?

I've never tried pavlova before and really enjoyed making this recipe. I thought it was a little on the too sweet for our tastes, but we did truly enjoy it and would make it again in the future. I did not draw the circle as other recipes have you do. I had no problems shaping it. The whipped topping is so light and refreshing, you will never go back to store bought again--very easy to make.

Very simple, easy to follow recipe. Though as other reviews have stated, it's quite sweet so the next time I make it, I likely won't sweeten the whipped cream as there's enough sugar in the meringue itself and the sweet berries on top. But this is a great dessert to have in your arsenal!

My dinner guests really enjoyed this.  Very light and airy.  I topped this with chopped fresh strawberries and pineapple.  On a separate occasion, I made them into mini pavlovas (yielded a dozen 3” rounds and baked for 40 minutes)... be sure to leave at least an inch between each round so they don’t puff up into each other.  I also drizzled melted chocolate over the fruit.

I made the recipe as is except I sliced strawberries and kiwi for the top instead of leaving them whole.  It was easy, delicious, and the presentation with the different colors was beautiful.

I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect. The video was a big help. A new favorite desert.

I had this dish in Australia in 1979 and I've always wanted to know how to make it.  I agree with another reviewer, it is very European-ish and a delicious, light dessert!

This was a wonderful dessert! Mine did crack a little when I removed it from the parchment paper, but after covering it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries, it really didn't matter. It reminded me of a very upscale strawberry short cake.

Chef John is one of my few “go-to’s” for recipes... along with Jamie Oliver and Julia... he never fails to disappoint, clear instructions, and always turns out well.

This is yet another example!  Classic and perfect.

If he doesn’t have a book or cooking show out (I don’t really watch TV)  he should.  Thank you Chef John!

Absolutely delicious. My gluten free friends were thrilled. Not a crumb left. I substituted almond extract for vanilla and it was a huge hit.

Made it for Christmas dessert. Watching the video helped to check the egg white texture. I used frozen strawberries and it still was decedent. I also made a second one and just drizzled chocolate sauce of the top of the whipped cream. It was tasty too

What a gorgeous and light dessert! Followed the recipe to a T and even made the same mistake of breaking the top, so I just covered it with cream and fruit to hide the cracks. Amazing either way!

This recipe is wonderful, especially when watching the video that goes with it for instruction. Made perfect  pavlovas both as one large or as ten minis. There is a discrepancy between the listed ingredients and those on the video. The list has three egg whites and the video shows four. I think this is responsible for the many comments about them being too sweet. If you use four eggs, they are perfectly sweet, if you use only three they are overly sweet.

I first had Pavlova cake in Australia last year.   It was so good,  that as soon as I got home I looked for a recipe.  I found this recipe and made it for my daughter's birthday a year after we got back.  I topped the whipped cream with strawberries,  blueberries and kiwi. Delicious! It was easier to make than I thought it would be, and a perfect summer dessert.  Will definitely make this again.

Made this for Christmas dessert. It was devoured. No aftovers to be found. Because it was Christmas, I got all "fancy" and put  the raw pavlova into a pastry bag and piped it out onto the parchment using a large tip before baking. It came out beautiful. So tasty and light after a large/heavy holiday meal.

Followed the directions to the letter. It was a BIG hit with the family for a Sunday dinner dessert. The middle is marshmalllow-like and the outside is crispy.

I cut sugar slightly in the meringue, but just a touch. I also made lemon whipped cream,  very lightly sweetened, and topped with the darkest, sweetest strawberries I could find. I made two batches and my family informed me I should probably double that for next time! It was a huge hit. Lovely and light. Thank you for a great recipe and something new!

I don't know what I did wrong. The egg whites beat up well, but it didn't hold after I took it t out of the oven. Taste was great. I covered the cream with toasted almonds and chopped up chocolate and served it with a sauce of sour cherries. But how can I maintain volume?

I was born and raised in Australia (the original home of the Pav) and this is a fantastic recipe. Make sure you watch the video as getting the right consistency to have the crusty outside and soft meringue inside is critical to the success of this dessert. Passionfruit pulp makes a great topping to provide a little tartness to the sweetness of the Pav, but is difficult to find where I reside in the States. It is completely unnecessary to break the top of the Pav as per the video. What were you thinking Chef John? :).

I'm an Aussie girl and this is just like my Grandma's.  We call it a marshmallow pav.  A soft marshmallow-ie centre with a crunchy outer case.  Pav's are supposed to be sweet, covered with lashings  of cream and topped with as much fruit as you can without having it fall off!   For a family my size (4 kids - 3 being boys and a truck driver husband, I had to double the recipe) Thanks for posting.

Great recipe!  Thought Chef John's video was helpful. However, building the meringue with a mixer is a lot easier.  My meringue did not brown, so when I constructed the dessert I lighrly dusted the whole thing with a bit of dark chocolate for contrast.  Also, when I hulled the berries I set them on paper towels for a while to make sure they wouldn't  weep any juice on the finished dish.  This is a beautiful dessert.  My new go to summer recipe. Move over lemon meringue pie!
