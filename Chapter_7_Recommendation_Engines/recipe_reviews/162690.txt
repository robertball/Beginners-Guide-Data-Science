Loved this recipe!  It was simple!  I made the ribs in my crockpot.  I added a couple of extra cloves of garlic cause that's what we like.  The juice from the ribs made an outstanding gravy for potatoes!  Yummy!!!

These were easy to make.  We wanted something w/o barbeque sauce on them, and this fit the bill.    Changed the method of preparation a bit by doubling the amount of pepper & flour with the same amount of salt and putting it into a plastic bag and coating the pieces of short ribs inside the plastic bag before cooking the ribs.  Didn't use the beer.  After deglazing the pan with water & 2 beef bouillon cubes (we were out of beef stock), everything was put into a roasting pan.  Baked the ribs in the oven with the cover on at 325 for almost 2 hours.  ( Watch so that the liquid doesn't run dry in the roaster ).  They turned out very tender and tasty.    May use a crock pot the next time these are made as others have suggested.  Thank You for posting.  It's a keeper.

This is a good basic recipe that's not hard to make.  The short ribs came out really tender.  I didn't do it, but you probably could make a good gravy from the broth to serve on mashed potatoes.

Incredible taste.  The recipe only calls for 1 pound of ribs which is a very small amount considering most of the weight is in the bones.  I used 4 pounds.  It took approx. 45 minutes to dredge and brown the ribs.  I didn't increase the amount of the liquid though.  The amount given in the recipe worked fine for the 4 pounds of meat.  I used my Lodge cast iron dutch oven which has a heavy lid and doesn't allow much liquid to cook out.  It worked wonderful for the ribs.  After about two hours the meat was falling off the bone.  The flavor was great.  We ate it with a nice crusty bread and sopped up the juice.  Divine !!!  It was nice to find a rib recipe that doesn't rely on a sweet barbecue sauce.  I will definitely make this again and again.

These were delicious, tender and easy! My new favorite short rib recipe with these additions.  I added a mix of paprika, chili powder, brown sugar, cayenne and garlic powder to the flour/salt/pepper to dredge the ribs in before browning.  It gave them a delicious, crunchy crust.  Place the browned ribs in a large slow cooker then cook the onions and garlic in the same skillet.  Before removing the onions/garlic deglaze the pan with the beer.  Pour this mixture over the ribs along with the beef stock. I also added a few squirts of Worchestershire to the liquid.   Lay a large stem of rosemary and a couple stems of sage on top of everything.  (If desired, add chopped carrots and mushrooms).  Cook on high for 5 hours.  Slightly thicken the sauce with a flour/water mix 1 hour before serving.

Used a combination of chicken broth (odd I know, but had no beef brother) and HP Sauce. They came out tender and flavorful, and a breeze to make. Thanks!

Instead of beer I used red wine and I also added more garlic cloves.  Also, when you take the meat out of the liquid at the end, let it boil down into a thicker demi glace type gravy.  About 10 or 15 extra mins.  Then spoon the demi glace over the meat or onto mashed potatoes.  This was so good that my neighbor, who is a chef, wanted seconds!

this was an amazing recipe! the only changes I made were to, after browning meat, add to crock pot and cook on high for five hours (after which, the meat literally fell off the bones! yum!) and I quadrupled the recipe amount... and had just enough for 4 people! I used some of the liquid to make a great gravy and the remaining liquid i used the next day for a french onion soup. Just add croutons and some swiss and provolone and broil till browned. All in all, a great tasting and No-waste meal, just be sure to adjust for how many people will be eating, and it's perfect.

Very easy.  I placed it all in a crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  Very tender and the gravy was delicious.

These are, by far, the BEST short ribs I have ever eaten!  I was skeptical that a recipe that was so simple could possibly produce such a wonderful dish --- but I was wrong.  The meat was so tender and flavorful and the gravy was unbeatable.  My husband and I can't stop raving over this dish!

The only changes I made were due to my own preferences.   I cooked 3+ pounds of ribs (they are among my husband's best-loved beef meals), I used low-salt broth and, of course, I added much more garlic than the recipe called for.  Although the gravy was a good consistency, I did add about a 1/3 cup of roue as suggested.  The gravy was still not at all too thick or gummy.

I served the short ribs with a horseradish sauce also found at the website, baked red potatoes and steamed frozen peas.  A winner all around!  I can still taste its goodness hours after we've eaten and I can't thank "CooperCook" enough for this great recipe.  It will certainly be a regular favorite in this house!

I like this recipe and have made it several times. I have to say first off that 1 pound of ribs for 4 servings must be a misprint. I use 3 to 4 pounds of ribs. I followed the recipe as is the first time and it was good. The next time I used 1 small can of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup of beef stock and added extra garlic. This really bumped the sauce up which I then thickened and served with the ribs over wide noodles. Delish. I also find that you can use almost any beer and it will come out good.

This was my first time making short ribs. I do not like cooking, as I call it, "big beef" because it never comes out tender.  Not this recipe!  My short ribs were falling off the bone and so tender.  I used guinnise beer extra stout.  I will use a litte less because of the extra stout.  But my husband said leave it the way it is.  We just ate the last today for lunch and we were smacking, mm mm good!  this recipe is a keeper.

Excellent, and easy. 1 pound is not enough for 4 if the ribs are largely bone and fat. I doubled the meat, kept all other amounts the same. I cooked some peeled potato with the ribs the last 45 minutes and they absorbed the right amount of sauce.

awesome easy recipe! it was so yummy! my husband and I loved it. I did not have stout beer so i used yingling since that is what i had in my fridge (figured it would work since it is dark beer) and it did the meat came out tender, fall of the bone goodness, i also used a lot more salt on my spare ribs. I served it over jasmine rice and poured some of the gravy over the rice and ribs it was super! thanks will make again a lot.

I've made this twice and it's so great, i would'nt make short ribs any other way. They're expensive these days so this recipe does them justice. The browning sort of carmelizes them and the long cook time makes them fall off the bone, not something I usually accomplish.

These are phenomenal!! Made the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. They are a little fatty so skimming the fat off the top is a very good idea before serving but the gravy is delicious!  Served with roasted potatoes and green beans. YUM!

I omitted the olive oil and butter from this recipe. There is enough fat in the beef. Added a few more cloves of garlic and used onion soup mix and 1 cup water because I did not have any beef broth. After browning the beef and the onion garlic mixture, I deglazed the pan with the onion soup and then the beer and poured it all in a slow cooker, with a few chunks of carrots, on high for 3 hours. Serve it on noodles or rice. What a wonderful treat!

Easy and delicious.  I did make a mistake, and forgot to add the cup of  beef broth, but they still came out delicious, with a nice gravy left over.  I browned a nice crust on 1 1/2 lbs. of short ribs, each side about 5 minutes, covered and set to low.  Let them cook exactly 2 hours.  Next time i will remember the broth, i forgot in the microwave 2 hours earlier.

My sister-inlaw loves these so I make them when she visits. We had a crowd playing darts and we let them cook covered at 350. for 4hrs They were not over cooked! I also sliced the onions and put them in the bottom of the casserole and put some more on top and covered  tight. hope you will  try these I don't think you will be disapponted

I used boneless short ribs, 1 can of Campbells Beef Broth, and a Coors beer. I browned the ribs very well and followed the recipe. I did put them in my crockpot. This is the best short rib recipe I have made and I have made several. It is so easy and every one loved them. I did thicken the juice with some flour mixed with water to make gravy. Oh my yes! Served with Brown rice and was highly praised.  Thanks CooperCook for this great recipe.

Excellent recipe! So easy and tastes just like the ribs Nana used to make when I was growing up! I served the ribs over wide egg noodles. There weren't any leftovers so next time I will double the recipe!

These were the best beef short ribs I have ever made.  My entire family loved them.  The only thing I added was thyme when I seasoned them.

Finally a recipe that is simple (really) and tasty. The aroma of this dish cooking is enough to make you come back for more before you have even eaten it. I basically followed it except now that I look I used canola oil and not olive and I used minced garlic and not a fresh clove, oh, and I didn't have stout beer so I used a bottle of Bud (that's the only I had in my frige). I guess basically this recipe is flexible AND tasty. I served this with potato pancakes and corn. I will make this again.

Re-reading this recipe I see I forgot to add the garlic.  I cooked them in my slow cooker on HI for 3 hours and then LOW for 2 hours. Truly the best meat I have ever eaten. Made delicious, mouthwatering gravy!

A perfect Sunday fall afternoon dish that makes the whole house smell wonderful. I didn't have stout, so used a lager and it didn't seem to harm the taste. I used boneless beef ribs, and they came out tender and flavorful.

Excellent & easy recipe for short ribs. I used boneless short ribs & light beer.  Other than adding a can of diced tomatoes, I followed the recipe as is.  Served them with mashies & green beans!  This one's a keeper!

Didn't like the beer. The ribs came out tender but had the bitter flavor of the beer. The beer also ruined the sauce. The sauce was extremely bitter. I salvaged the sauce, I had only added half the beer before I realized the sauce was going the wrong way. Added milk, some sugar, pepper, salt and cinnamon to save it. Added water and it was decent, bitter taste was gone.

I did this recipe for two short ribs - amazing! I just added 1/2 of the stock and the beer and it turned out great after 1.5 hours. Also served with green beans and garlic mashed.... Great pairing.

I thought this recipe was very flavorful, which was amazing with so few ingredients.  Since my spare ribs didn't have much meat, I added some boneless porkchops to the recipe as well.  They turned out so tender and provided a nice option for my kids who didn't want to work around the fat on the ribs.  Instead of Stout beer, I used a Pecan Maple Porter.  I will definitely make this again!

Really good. I make in the crock pot after browning in the pan first. Only downside is short ribs tend to be fatty, and the fat gets incorporated into the sauce. I might want to try to cool and skim the fat next time.

Loooove this recipe!  I used burgandy wine instead of beer since we eat Gluten Free and used instead of beef stock as well... I also didn't use the flour (since it has gluten).  I went ahead and added the garlic when I seared the ribs at first to seal in more flavor.  Definitely a keeper!  :)  I plan on using the extra stock for french onion soup, it is delish!... :)

Fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe! I doubled the beef and used a 14.9 ounce can of Guiness and a full tablespoon of freshly minced garlic. It's even more delicious the next day!

I made them for Sunday supper by cooking all afternoon in the crock pot. They turned out tender and delicious. I made Grandma's buttered noodes from this site. It was a real comfort food on a cold winter evening.

This took about 45 min of prep time cutting off all the fat. I sprinkled a liberal amount of pepper on one side and garlic salt on the other side, prior to dipping in flower. 4lbs of meat, .5L bottle of export bitburger beer, one can of beef broth and added garlic salt then threw it in the oven for 2 1/2-3 hours at about 350 degrees Farenheit (180Celcius or so). It was a HUGE hit - so delicious. Baked red potatoes with rosemary about 1 hour prior to being finished too. (sliced/cubed potatoes and brushed melted butter with rosemary and garlic salt, then placed on to the greased cookie sheet)

I used boneless short ribs, which in this case were not deboned short ribs, but meat cut to resemble it but much leaner. This delivers a very different result than true short ribs. I used a dark lager instead of stout. This tasted great, but I could just as well have made a pot roast. If I make it again, I'll definitely use short ribs.

Wow, I am shocked at all the good reviews.

Even the basic mechanics of the recipe didn't work for me. 

 I ran out of flour to dredge the meat, because 2 Tbsp per pound is not enough unless one is lightly dusting with flour rather than dredging.

I had to do two batches of browning because all the ribs did not fit in the (large) pot I was using.  After the first batch, I had to WASH the pot because it was full of burned bits.  I did the second batch on medium and not medium-high, and did not have this problem.

And the results?  Rather bland, too fatty, nothing that even came close to justifying the effort.

I've made these a few times and my family loves them!  I've slightly added to it by drizzling the ribs with BBQ sauce after they have finished cooking and then broiling them on low for about 5.

The beef was very tender and the gravy very nice but I was expecting a little more favor. Its great for a base and I will use again but might try experimenting a little with spices.

The.most.delicious.thing.I.have.ever.made!! Thank you so much for this recipe. My hubby and I both love short ribs and order them whenever we see them on a menu. He said they tasted better than at a restaurant -- if that's not a rave review, I don't know what is! I added a second clove of crushed garlic (we love garlic) and served it with mashed potatoes and carrots. The sauce def. makes a nice gravy. I used a can of Bud Light because it was all I had. Can't wait to make it again!

Made it exactly as written except added an extra clove of garlic. Took about 15 minutes extra cooking time for boneless short ribs that were fairly lean. Flavor is like a pot roast, except it's already in pieces so the juices reach more surfaces. I served over rice with the onions and some of the juice from the pan with a veggie on the side. It was even better the second day. Reheats well in a microwave. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! 
Every week, I make a home-cooked, from-scratch meal for a small group of friends. I've been doing it for close to five years, and it was rated one of the top three of all time! We ate every morsel and stopped just short of licking the pan, my 4 year old had seconds, and even the super-picky 2 year old ate a few bites. 
I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I did not have any beer on hand, and don't care for it, so I used Stongbow Honey & Apple Hard Cider.  Wonderful sweetness with the onions!  I will definitely make this again (next week is not too soon!) but will be sure to triple the recipe to try and get some leftovers.

The only thing that I changed was using a regular beer just because I didn't have stout. This was absolutely delicious and may be the best meal I've ever made. My toddler wasn't a fan but she doesn't eat anything.

I have never made beef ribs before. It was fantastic in the crock pot.  I did brown the ribs before and and the onion with 3 cloves of garlic. I used just two boullion cubes instead of broth and only used the beer for liquid. I left out the salt and it turned out perfect. What a great easy meal.

Loved it, added 2 cups Red wine, 3 carrots, celery and fresh garlic.  Used chicken broth and a bay leaf. I also simmered 1 hr longer. Meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork.

Excellent but needed a bit more flavor for our taste so added some "Better than Bouillon" beef flavor. Also, as other reviewer mentioned good to have next day so can skim away cooled fat.

Yum!!  Had braised short ribs at one of my favorite restaurants and loved them so I decided to try this at home.  I didn't have a stout beer, so I used a Bud Light and added soy sauce (Guinness always reminds me of soy sauce).  This was fantastic!  Served with garlic mashed potatoes.  Hubby loved it.

Ohhhh so good.  I took one reviewer's advice and added Worchestershire Sauce and Rosemary.  I made it in the crock pot.  I thicken up the sauce as we love gravy.  I served it over rice, my husband's favorite but I will serve the leftovers over noodles, what I prefer.  Thanks so much!!!  Either way, it is a keeper!!!  Thanks. :))))))

This is a great recipe I've used many times. Most recently made it in a dutch oven and used Coca Cola as
the liquid, came out delicious and easy as usual. Try it, you'll love it guaranteed.

I Just made this recipe tonight, I used 3lbs of boneless beef ribs, so I doubled the beer and beef stock. I should have made a gravy like one review suggested.  Also I put it in the crock pot for 3 hours and it took 1 more to really see the meat fall apart. It was delicious and I would recommend to anyone who loves tender ribs!

These were so good, they just melt in your mouth.  I've only ever made short ribs in a slow cooker so I was worried they wouldn't be as tender but they were perfect.  I doubled the amount of ribs and there was still plenty of sauce.

I accidentally made these with pork and it turned out amazing!  I used St. Pauli Gill special dark and it had a wonderful flavor.  Even the next day when I shredded the leftovers and added it to fajitas.  I just made them again the other night and used beef and wow were they tender.  You won't regret picking this recipe!

Simple and delicious! I made two substitutions. Instead of salt, I used a salt free seasoning blend, and I didn't have beef broth, so I used a pkg of reduced sodium  brown gravy mix with 1 cup water. The gravy was the perfect consistency, I didn't have to thicken it at all. This will be my "go to" short rib recipe from now on. Thanks!

I made this for Sunday night dinner. I followed the instructions to the "T" and it came out delicious. I used Guiness for the stout.  did add some flour to the gravy to thicken it up once I took the ribs out of the pot. I serve it with mashed potatoes and frozen green beans. Yum! I will definitely make it again.

It’s my second time making this recipe.  This time I added chopped green onions, yellow bell peppers and carrots to the broth.  Beef always ends fork tender.  One of my family’s favorite.

Excellent!!  Tender and delicious, and a lovely broth.  I followed the recipe browning the ribs and using Guiness beer, but I dropped everything in the crockpot.  I started later in the day, so I turn it on high for 3-4 hours and the aroma almost had me gnawing my elbow (not easy!).  Leftovers the next day were even better.  Took the suggestion of another reviewer and used the leftover broth for onion soup - they were already in there!  Just added cheese and croutons.

I have made this recipe many times. There are better but more complex recipes out there for short ribs. However, you can't beat this one for simplicity. For added flavor I sometimes reduced the broth to make a demi glace. I even made this in a dutch oven over a campfire. We have also used beef shin instead of short ribs because it was more economical and it was just as good. Stout does add some more flavor but I usually use the darkest beer I have around, typically Yuengling Lager.  This is one of those recipes that you can easily be altered to your taste to make it your own.

This recipe made a delicious tender short rib.  Unfortunately, I added too much beer and beef broth and could not reduce the fluid enough to make a glaze.  However, the taste was very good.

Wow, my hard to please family loved this! I used 5 lbs short ribs, more flour salt and pepper, 4 cloves of garlic, a whole bottle of porter (dark beer) and a carton of beef stock. Served over loaded mashed potatoes. My picky daughter ate 3 helpings and my husband gave it 10/10. Thanks for the recipe

before sautéing the onions and garlic, make sure to remove the accumulated fat and leave just a tablespoon. 

You can substitute red wine, or the equal volume of beef stock when you do not have beer. 

simple recipe, but very flavorful.

Stout is very bitter, and it carries into the meat. Next time, I would use a sweeter red wine. Otherwise it was ok. I finished these on the grill and boiled the sauce down with a little extra salt into a gravy with a bit of corn starch to thicken. I also made sticky pork ribs, Gordon Ramsay 's recipe, that blew these out of the water.

Loved this recipe. Not overwhelming for my toddlers,they asked for more. Instead of the 1 lb. of ribs though I had 6 lbs, and just doubled the recipe. Except for the beer and the onions. With the stock that was more than enough liquid for the 2 hour boil. Thanks!

Made it with 2 lbs of meat, doubled the liquid, added 2 more cloves of garlic, one shallot.  I added a bay leaf to the pot, paprika to the flour, and about a cap full of apple cider vinegar near the end of cooking.  That made  it sing.  Finished it with a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it and had awesome gravy.  So I give it 4 stars because it's a good foundational recipe from which to add your own creativity.

The only thing I changed was I used wine instead of beer, and I let it simmer longer. I had a little over 2.5 lbs of boneless short ribs, and with the wine and beef stock, there was plenty of liquid, and it made delicious gravy, according to my guests. This was a really easy recipe, and I let it simmer on the stove for 4 hours. The meat was fork tender. I will definitely make this again.

I just made this tonight... I was  skeptical, but the ribs were great! Tender and fell right off the bone! I  doubled the meat as suggested and added extra garlic. I added a little more beef stock which wasnt necessary and I have extra liquid so I think I will  be making some soup!

This was awesome!  I used water instead of the beer because I was slow cooking it with small red potatoes.  Browned it in a cast iron pan and then slow cooked it in the oven with potatoes for 2 hours.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is wonderful. Like a few others, I don't like BBQ sauce on my short ribs. We love the flavor of these. My only change is I didn't use beer - substituted more beef broth. Cooked in a crock pot. Prepared brown rice and used the sauce/drippings over everything. We can't get enough of this meal.

This was easy and delicious. I wanted a recipe that didn't use the crockpot or take all day. Using what I had on hand, I used red wine instead of beer and chicken stock. Great with mashed potatoes.

Made 2 lbs. in the slow cooker today.  They were so tender.  I added paprika and rosemary to the ribs. I omitted the flour and beer and put everything directly in the slow cooker. My entire family ate them

I made these for dinner last night. Oh my. These are soooooo good. This is officially a staple recipe in my file. I'll be making these again and again. I did not use short ribs. They were just too expensive. I used beef back ribs ! Yummy !  My husband is a very plain eater. he hates his food all spiced up and sauced up. Says it spoils the taste of the main ingredient.. Thank you allrecipes.com. I always find good recipes on your site.
Mary.

I started making these as directed... but just didn't have a pan large enough to accomodate the ribs and the sauce. I placed them in the oven at 325 degrees. I checked them in one hour and the meat was falling off the bone... so I added 2 small baking potatoes (whole), carrots, and spinach. One hour later, a perfect meal!

Very simple, but delicious; it's all but throwing it all in a pot and letting it cook.  The onions melt away, making for a simple sauce.   

Works very well with a cheap roast cut as well, and for a slow cooker.  I alter it sometimes by adding mushrooms and carrots and other veg you'd add to a beef stew or pot roast.

Meat was tender and taste was okay, but this wasn't anything special. The mashed potato side stole this show, and they weren't anything special either. Oh well.

Made this for the hubby this weekend.  So simple and so wonderful!  Only change that I made was after I had everything mixed in the pan I transfered to a slow cooker.  Literally fell off the bone!  Husband insists that I make this instead of roast from now on!

Came out very tender and flavorful and we ate over noodles with sour cream.  Next time, I would add some carrots while cooking to add a little more flavor/sweetness.

I was so disappointed in this recipe! The ribs came out tough, even with extended simmer time, and amazingly they came out dry! I don't understand how something that simmers IN LIQUID could come out so dry. The ribs had no flavor at all. I ended up brushing my ribs with a little honey and BBQ sauce and broiling for 2 minutes at the end just to add a little flavor. I will not make these again.

Very good answer to short timeline preparation compared to the grill. The wife liked this very much.

I wouldn't make again. I would reduce the onion. Someone mentioned the remaining broth would be good for onion soup, I agree.

Not sure what I did wrong, but the only thing I changed was that I used boneless short ribs. They were so tasteless. We had to slather them with horseradish to give it some kind of taste.

This was an awesome recipe. I tweeked it out of necessity of lack of called for ingredients. I used Kitchen Bouquet Browning sauce instead of the beef stock and I added fresh sliced mushrooms during the last hour of cooking time. I will definately prepare this recipe again.

When it says simple, it is! The 2 hrs simmering does all the work. I used Guiness Extra Stout.  I thickened the cooking liquids the last 15 mins with diluted cornstarch to use as gravy. Even my 5 & 9 yr olds enjoyed. Served with egg noodles and squash.

This is a really good, simple, easy short ribs recipe!  I used boneless short ribs and cubed them.  I used 3 garlic cloves, tripled the pepper and added another tsp of salt.  Also, 30 minutes before ribs were ready, I added finely chopped green onions, which added a little more to the "simple" flavor of this dish.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Maybe I used the wrong type of stout, but we didn't like it at all.  The gravy had a bitter taste.  Normally we fight over the onions, but this time I threw them all away. Also, the meat was rather bland tasting.  I'll go back to my tomato paste based recipe. I won't make this again.

Used Provo girl beer and paste type bouillon. Didn't have an onion on hand but onion powder to my taste worked well. There were no leftovers.

I had some beef ribs marinating in some leftover coffee and used this recipe. I had friends coming over and informed them that I was serving an experiment because the leftover coffee was raspberry/vanilla that the ribs had been marinating in. I used this recipe accordingly and got rave reviews. Thank you for sharing a very easy but delicious recipe!

My husband said this was the best meal ever. I didn’t change anything. It made a nice gravy and served it over egg noodles and Brussels sprouts and garlic on the side. It took exactly two hours and the meat was very tender.

I don't do much cooking since my husband is a vegetarian and cooks his own meals 90% of the time.  But I wanted to try these boneless short ribs and this recipe was simple and did the trick.  I had no garlic but I followed along and used shallot instead of onion/garlic and added parsley, rosemary, thyme and tarragon to flavor it up.  I used a small Staub dutch oven - two firsts - my first short ribs and my first use of the Staub pot.  For liquid, I used white wine and water with a vegetable bullion cube.  Came out great, two small portions, one for tonight another for some other time plus lots of gravy left over.  I was so excited they were tender I forgot to take a photo (sorry) haha).  If I did it again I would make a larger amount and save some for a friend.  Thank you Allrecipes!

I was looking for something other than a barbecue sauce for beef short ribs and this recipe turned out great! I used a slow cooker, so the only change I made was to decrease the amount of liquid by using 1/2 can of beer and a beef bouillon cube instead of broth. Delicious and easy!

Made the recipe with no changes. My husband loved it! It was tasty and the ribs were fall of the bone tender. I did thicken the gravy after removing the ribs. This recipe is a keeper.

It was okay. I like a slow cooker method better. The ribs were not falling off the bone after almost 3 hours of cooking.

I adapted the recipe to the instant pot:  cut liquids by half, cook in instant pot on pressure cook hi pressure setting for 35 mins.  Turned out really well, though I needed to thicken the sauce.  I will make this again.

A perfect basic techniques recipe. My beer on hand happened to be Red Stripe. Ribs (bone in) were tender, succulent, with awesome beef flavor after two hours. Sauce is more of a jus and was excellent as well. This will be  a great recipe to play with! Seasonings and flavors will be easy to change up, as well as gravy thickness. Just as it was was magic with a little horseradish! :) Thank you!

Made these for the first time tonight, absolutely amazing! I made 6 lbs (12 ribs) and almost all of them are gone between 3 adults and 2 little kids. I did add celery and would have added carrots but forgot to pick them up from the store. I decided to bake them at 350 for 2 hours after searing and they were fall-off-the-bone delicious... Definitely keeping this recipe!

Yesterday found the best looking  short ribs & had to buy them. Looked online for  a different recipe,  this one popped up and SIMPLE it was.  Usually don't change a recipe, but it's been my experience that meats cooked in wines have a bitter after taste and since I'm not a beer drinker was afraid I might  mess up these great looking ribs. One review mention not having the beer and just used onion soup mix and water so that what I did. There  were so MANY POSITIVE  REVIEWS that next time I will venture out  & try the recipe with the beer. Truly falling off the bone and delicious

it came out great I i followed the recipe but instead of leaving it in the pan I used my pressure cooker it took a 1hr and 10 mins. I had 2lbs of ribs so I just doubled the recipe. I never cooked beef ribs before I'm glad I found this recipe.

I love this recipe. very simple and tasty. I make it at least once a month and serve over cauliflower rice and side green veggies. If I don't have stout in the house, I use red wine and it is just as good and makes the gravy less "bitter" tasting.

I used this recipe with beef country ribs.  The recipe was very easy to make and was satisfying.  I had read in an Americas Test Kitchen (ATK) article that using chicken stock when cooking beef gave better flavor.  Not having the chicken stock I used turkey stock.  To the pot I added 4 large carrots, cut in 2 inch long chunks halved lengthwise if it was easy to cut them.  For the beer, I added Hard root beer, the "root beer" taste disappeared.   I did not add the salt and pepper  while cooking.  The final product didn't seem to miss it.  It could have cooked longer  but the meat was fork cuttable as it was.

Chose not to use the stock, as I prepared and cooked the ribs in the instant pot. They came out tender and moist, I will make his recipe again.

Absolutely delish! I didn't have the stout, so used a bottle of Bud's Amber Lager instead. The flavor was over the top, the meat was so tender it simply fell apart, no knife needed! Other than that one change, I followed the recipe to the T... and my hubby loved it, said it was one of the best beef dinners I've made in a while! Now, from him, that is a TRUE compliment! Thanks SO much for sharing this one, my short ribs are usually so tough and flavorless without some kind of heavy syrupy coating... I will be making this one again. And OFTEN!

I made one change to the recipe:  only in that I doubled it.  I don't know if my butcher's cuts on short ribs was wrong, or whether or not that would have made a difference.

That said, I had 2.3 lbs of short ribs in the form of 4 big ribs.  I doubled all ingredients and cooked according to directions.  In an attempt to avoid crowding the pan, I braised the seasoned/floured ribs in two separate batches.  After the first batch (2 big ribs), I contemplated washing out the pan and replacing with new butter/oil.  I didn't... cooked next 2 big floured ribs in remaining darkened butter/oil.  Prepared everything exactly according to recipe, including buying stout,  then doubling ingredients for my extra ribs.

The result:  somewhat bitter and burnt-tasting gravy and ribs, with amazing flavors of what might have been.  My thoughts are 1) if you're multiplying this recipe, change out your oil/butter before each little batch; 2) the Stout is quite bitter -- I love beer-based marinades and undertones -- but don't multiply the Stout equally by the recipe's ratio. (I used two bottles of Guinness for 2+ pounds of ribs and the bitterness was palpable.)

Really good!!  I followed the recipe, except I used regular beer because that was all I had.  About 50 minutes before beef  was done, I added celery and carrots.  And about 40 minutes prior to it finishing, I added quartered potatoes.  It was all so yummy!  I will definitely make this recipe again!!

The flavor was a 10, but the ribs turned out tough/dry. I wonder if it's because I used boneless ribs? Or maybe I seared them too long. Next time I will try searing them for less time and then using a slow cooker. But the gravy from this was delicious!

This was delicious and easy.  I used lite beer instead of stout.  
I would increase the salt, pepper, garlic slightly in the future.
Otherwise, the recipe is great.

Was very surprised despite all the good reviews. I did adjust for our family. I used almond flour seasoned with rosemary, garlic powder, pepper and paprika. I used a crockpot on low for 6 hours adding potatoes and carrots the last 45 min. My crockpot runs hot, thus the cut in time. I used Sierra Nevada Stout. I used 2 cups of beef bone broth and 2 cups of chicken broth. It was melt in your mouth and so flavorful. I followed others advice and was heavy handed on the salt when seasoning the meat. I also used the broth afterwards to make a delicious gravy. I think next time I will serve with mashed potatoes and green beans. This will definitely be a repeat for us and dinner guests. It's that good.

Wow! Talk about melt in your mouth! Super easy meal that everyone loved. I didnt have stout on hand so i used half of a can of ipa (since i didnt want a strong bitter taste) and omitted the onion as I am allergic. Simply cooked with lots of garlic, salt and pepper. The Meat  literally fell off the bone. Like other reviewers,  I made a gravy from the sauce and my picky eater son asked for seconds. Will definitely make again

I used boneless beef ribs from Costco because I had them already. I increased the onion and garlic because I had more than a lb of meat. I covered it and braised it in the oven on 300 degrees for 3 hrs. This dish was superb!

Every recipe needs a like twining to make it your own. So I added more garlic, fresh baby belle mushrooms, baby carrots, and fresh thyme. Overall this turned our very nice. Next time we will try red wine . . .

Everyone enjoyed this.  Easy to make.  Reminded me of beef stew  with bones.  Used Polish Zywiec beer.  Will make again.  Satisfying and warming.  Used advice of placing rosemary sprigs on top.  Made home smell even better!

It didn't turn out well for me. The dish had a bitter taste that I could not remedy. I think I'll go back to using a barbecue sauce when I cook short ribs.

Braising was a good low maintenence way to cook the short ribs until tender.  I added more garlic, more beef stock (my short ribs were over 1 lb) and added tarragon and fresh parsley at the end.  I braised the whole thing in a 350 degree oven for 2 hrs after searing off the ribs and onions.  I agree with a previous reviewer, the texture is close to pot roast.

Super easy. Only change I made was to cook it in the oven for 1 hour at 375. Then let it cook for the other hour on the top. My family loved it!! Will definitely cook again.

I used 3 1/3 lbs of beef short ribs (8) so I increased the flour and seasonings a bit. I always cook it a day in advance and let the meat sit in the sauce overnight. Remove the fat and reheat the next. Excellent recipe.

This recipe was wonderful! I am a novice so my wife helped me out quite a bit (she is fantastic). The ribs were very tenderful and the gravy was over the top on mashed potatoes! A little work for a novice but well worth it!

Very easy recipe to follow but I was hoping for slightly more tender meat, and it tasted a lot like pot roast to me, but the flavor was good. Could definitely have been the short ribs I had. My hubby loved it more than pot roast. I used red wine instead of beer since that's what I had but I would love to try it again with stout beer and maybe some portobellos thrown in.

Fantastic!  My hubby took one bite and asked me to add it to our regular menu rotation - he never comments after one bite.  I took the time to really brown the ribs until they were a caramel colour.

The only change I made was I used  sparkling mineral water instead of beer. They were incredibly tender, though I would probably serve them with barbecue sauce because there wasn't quite enough flavor for me

did not use beer since I have a teenager in the house. first time I have made ribs in the oven and without bbq sauce. it tasted like roast but since I love a good roast  I loved these ribs. I also rubbed on meat tenderizer. also make sure to cook fat side up brings out more flavor.  absolutely delicious!

This was my first time making ribs, so I used large beef ribs, seasoned them, seared them the best I could, then put them in a crockpot with the broth/beer/onion mixture.  It was AMAZING!!  I recommend using Guinness stout for the dark beer and some extra garlic.  The juice tastes wonderful on mashed potatoes too!!

Wow!  Delicious and simple.  Can't wait to make again.  I had 2+ pounds of bone-in short ribs.  Followed recipe but skipped the butter and added 2 cut-up carrots with the onions.  After cooking veggies I also added about 1 and 1/2 cups of sliced mushrooms I needed to use up and a shot of Worchester like someone else suggested.  I used a bottle of apple beer because that's all I had.  After removing the meat from pan I reduced the sauce for about 15 minutes and then thickened slightly with a slurry of cornstarch, about a tablespoon.  Great meal!  Next time I'll use about 4-5 lbs. of ribs and double the sauce.

This recipe will make you the champion of the kitchen. So easy and so delicious, although I did edit the recipe. When considering the weight of bones for short ribs, i used 4 lbs instead of one and kicked up my ingredients. I'm gluten free so I used GF all-purpose flour and a GF beer. Additionally, I made these in the slow cooker for 2.5 hours on high, but then they needed an extra 45 minutes. They were falling off the bone and so delicious! I had a lot of extra broth/stew, so I froze it and later used it for a gf pasta dish. There is nothing bad about this recipe!

I was in a rush and ended up not following the recipe exactly. I forgot to dredge the ribs in flour, salt and pepper before browning them. I ended up seasoning after browning (no flour) and cooked it in a cast iron pan that wasn't tall enough for the lid to fit properly with the ribs in. All in all it ended up fairly tasty regardless and I will definitely use this recipe again.

I had bought the short ribs on a whim and had no idea how to cook them. I followed this simple recipe and couldn't believe how delicious the dish was. It was even better the second day. The Stout gave it a dark, smoky undertaste. Next time I'll add in some carrots. I ate it over egg noodles and it was sublime. I would highly recommend this recipe!

Very easy to make. Would be a great recipe for someone learning to cook. Mouth watering! I used red wine instead of the beer. Melt in mouth a lot of flavor. Even my picky granddaughter liked it. I served it with mashed potatoes but next time I'm going to serve them over noodles.

This is a great way to cook beef short ribs. I used my new Instant Pot after I followed the basic directions. After browning on the Saute setting in the Instant Pot, I set the pot to Meat/Stew for 35 minutes. I let it cool naturally. The meat turns out very tender, as if you cooked it for two or three hours.

Flavor is like pot roast. Tasty, but nothing special.  More the problem: meat was TOUGH, as in inedible.  (I've just thrown it back in the pot for another hour, just to see if that's the problem). I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband says I needed to bring the pot to a full boil again before the simmer step. But the recipe didn't say that.  Was that the problem?

these came out really tender. I used boneless ribs and added a little pepper,seasoning salt and garlic powder to the liquid after simmering for an hour. I wish I had seasoned the meat before browning a little bit more but overall very tasty. My husband loved them.

These were easy and delicious! I started them in the morning and at lunch time, I put the pan in the refrigerator.  Before dinner, I removed all the fat at the top and re-warmed them.  Great flavor!  Served them over mashed potatoes.

These were scrumptious and so very easy. I did not have beer or beef broth. I used chicken bullion cubes dissolved in water, quintupled the recipe, and everyone raved about how good these were.

I used boneless beef short ribs cut into 1 inch cubes.  I just salted and peppered them and browned them in oil.  Didn't bother dredging them with flour cause IMHO, dredging meat in flour is rarely worth the time and effort.  I added sliced carrots about an hour into simmering.  And I thickened the sauce with flour before serving over noodles.  Very yummy!  Just needed a touch more salt.

We love this recipe.  It is the second time that I made it.  I only had Porter on hand and it was great.  I also added more garlic and mushrooms.

Easy, easy, easy!  My family loved it! Only because I'm not a beer drinker (lol) I might go with a less full flavored beer.  But that's only because of MY taste buds like mild.  But that wouldn't prevent me from giving this a 5 Star!

I had such high hopes for this recipe after reading other reviews, but ended up so disappointed. I first looked at the short ribs at our local grocery store and thought they looked fatty, so instead I bought them at the most reputable meat store in town. They still looked fatty, but having never cooked them before, I figured that must be normal and somehow magically in the cooking process the fat would melt away.  I followed the recipe to a T (except made more than the 1 pound called for, which didn't seem like nearly enough for 4 people). The meat had good flavor and fell away from the bone but, as I suspected, it had sooo much fat and even areas of gristle mixed in. Even my teenage son who eats just about anything thought they were too fatty.

I made this for my husband and it was FANTASTIC!  The meat was literally falling off the bone and had lots of flavor.  The sauce left in the pan was delicious and we put it on our garlic mashed potatoes we had on the side.  The stout gave it a really nice flavor (and I don't like beer!).  This really was very easy to make and we were thrilled with the results--will definitely make again.  Oh, and as someone else mentioned, you can use more than a pound of short ribs with the same amount of everything else (maybe a tad more salt, pepper, and flour) and it works great.  I used nearly 4 pounds.

Excellent! Put in 14.5 oz can of chicken broth by mistake so I added two beef boullion cubes. Everyone loved it. Never had short ribs before but I will definitely have them again. I used the extra gravy on spaghetti the next day. Yum!

VERY Simple, but full of taste, I decided to do in the slow cooker and used rice flour instead of regular, as well I used more salt (per another review) and Tsingtoa beer. Excellent

This turned out great. Instead of simmering on the stove, I put ribs in a covered pot with potatoes in the oven at 325deg for a couple hours

We had this last night it was very good.  I did use the boneless short ribs and trimmed as much fat as possible. Added carrots to the pot and used pressure cooker to cut the cooking time.

Very good.  I added more garlic and left it to simmer for about 3 hours; the tenderness was perfect.  It made good gravy for the mashed potatoes.

I doubled recipe, only to find liquid much too juicy and thin (tried to thicken it, but guess I did not use enough flour). I browned ribs first and then finished in crock pot. I might have used a bad batch of ribs as well - no flavor and not much beef.
