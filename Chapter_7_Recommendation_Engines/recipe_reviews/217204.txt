This is nicer looking if it is shaped into a log, and rolled in very finely chopped pecans or walnuts.  also, be sure to use white horseradish, not red.  and i double the recipe to 2 cans of salmon and 8 oz pkg of cream cheese.

I started my career in food service 30 years ago in a fine dining establishment. I was looking for something different to do with fresh salmon and recognized this recipe as one we used as an appetizer, that I had forgotten about. I don't understand why the low ratings because this was more popular than any other appetizer we offered. The only change I made was to bake fresh salmon and then use my hand chopper to finely chop the onion and salmon before mixing everything together. I think that will make a difference in blending the smoke and other ingredients into a salmon lovers dream dish that is beyond perfect for any special occasion. I also would recommend doubling the recipe to make sure there is enough to go around. Thank you Shuffcow, for a blast from my past!

Maybe I didn't do something right but it ended up tasting like a really bad tuna salad

To much salmon and not enought cream cheese also I would use canned smoked salmon instead of plain canned salmon and liquid smoke

Hi! I've made a version of this for many years. I just finished making some for this New Year's Eve. However, I don't use the horseradish or the parsley. I use 1 can of salmon and 1 4oz block of cream cheese. And I use much more than a dash of liquid smoke. More like a few teaspoons, but you can add to your taste. I also serve it with the Pepperidge Farm Distinctive Cracker trio or quartet. I love it!

I liked it but my husband kept calling it tuna dip because he didn't make it and it did taste more like tuna than salmon in this recipe.
