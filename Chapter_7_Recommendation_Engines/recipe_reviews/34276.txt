I made this with two changes. I added four beaten eggs to the cold milk and let them heat together, being careful not to let it boil.  And I used only half the cornstarch.  It came out great.

I'm not a professional puddinhg maker or anything, but I'm almost positive this is missing something signifigant. Eggs maybe? More corn starch? I don't know but the end result of my try was runny......BIG TIME. The flavor was nice I suppose if just would have thickened into a pudding texture if would have been very nice ( I added a pinch of nutmeg and allspice). I'm hoping maybe there was a misprint and hate to have to rate this a 2 as I think it *could* be good, but as is,....not worth the effort.

I have to admit I cheated a little with this.  Instead of watching a saucepan, I put my milk in the microwave and let it go for 3 minutes. (This always brings the milk to a froth in mine, but times will differ depending on machines and it's best to keep a close eye on the situation as the milk bubbles up rapidly (and over the sides of the container) when it's boiling.)  I had all the other ingredients ready to go and as soon as the milk was close to boiling over, I added it to the rest.  This doesn't result in a solid pudding, more of a custard, but it does have a fabulous taste.

Increased the cornstarch to 3 tbs., added some nutmeg, and made it in the microwave.  It worked out great.  I am always on the lookout for recipes that use honey instead of sugar, and this one is a keeper.

This pudding failed to thicken.  I cooked it over 10 minutes (more than twice as long as the recipe called for) and it appeared only slightly thickened.  But I thought if I refrigerated it, it would thicken to the proper consistency.  No, I have Chilled Honey Vanilla Soup!!! Something must be missing (eggs?).

If you want a great pudding recipe, keep looking. If you want a tasty addition to fruit smoothies, try this. Make this recipe, then put it in the blender with fresh fruit and crushed ice. The recipe didn't work for me, but I didn't want to throw it out, so I used it in smoothies. Delicious.

I made this to toss with fresh cut fruit. I made lots of substitutes, but my best tip is to add a teaspoon of xanthum gum if you have it â€“ thickens it right up. Also added a teaspoon of lemon juice.

Too thin for a good pudding, but makes an excellent sauce. Slice of pound cake, top with fruit, pour some of this over it, and you've got a great dessert. So while it's a 3 as a pudding(only for the great flavor) it's a 5 as a sauce, so I split the difference and gave it a 4

I needed to let it thicken more and I might decrease the amount of honey.  Kids loved it!

I made this as a quick simple dessert for a cold night. My family enjoys warm pudding and I had these ingredients on hand. However, if I had made it per the instructions it would have been sweet warm milk, not pudding. Being that have made pudding before I watched and added 3 whole beaten eggs very very slowly and cooked until thick. I will also say that I made a batch for 6 vs 4 so if I were making a smaller pot I would use 2 eggs. I also used regular sugar for the honey and drizzled a bit on top after pouring into bowls. It was a hit, even my picky eater said it was really great. I will make again but will recommend using eggs and a wire whisk to any who take this recipe on.

Like most of the others, i could not get this thick enough...I doubled the cornstarch and it was still runny.  The flavor was delicious though and I'm going to keep it to put over fruit like someone else suggested.  I might try this again and add a pack of unflavored gelatin and see if that helps thicken things up a bit.

the only changes i added where a pinch of nutmeg at the end, and during the cooking i didn't let the milk boil, instead i heated it about 10 min and stirred in the cornstarch, from there it took about 15 minutes(i let it boil after the starch was added), no change in the heat stirring constantly.

Probably not a make-again, but I like the taste of honey so was glad I tried the recipe.  I did add an egg and used the amount of cornstarch called for in the recipe - but thought it could have been a little firmer.

I tried this recipe tonight, adding a little bit more cornstarch and honey to sweeten and thicken it. Turned out pretty alright, pudding was firm but still wobbly texture. Sweetness was just right. Would definitely try it again, perhaps with cocoa powder!

the flavor is indeed the wow factor here..., spooning the *sauce* this recipe made over fruit is a nice touch, but as others have mentioned, I will have to add more cornstarch if I find myself trying this again *as a pudding*......, which I might...... that flavor is worth coming back for, IMHO......  mmmmmmmmm...........

This has got to be the best pudding known to man. Very easy to make, as long as you don't let the milk scald, and tastes like it was made out of clouds from heaven. Something tells me this is going to become a family favorite treat!

This is a good base recipe. Since I have worked with cornstarch before and honey, I knew that all the ingredients it says to add after thickening will thin it out again (butter, honey, vanilla) So I added all the ingredients at the start and used  2-3 heaping tbsp on cornstarch mixed in milk and it came out perfect! If you still find it to runny just bring it back to a boil and add more cornstarch. Do make sure you bring it to a full boil before adding the cornstarch.

It's a little too runny. I thought maybe I messed up somewhere, but after reading the reviews I'm not alone. If you want your pudding thick try something else.

Was delicious, but to sweet. I would recommend using a tablespoon less honey then the recipe calls for.

There's a problem with adding ingredients AFTER you have thickened the recipe with cornstarch: if you stir cornstarch after it's thickened, it thins out again.
