These were delicious and something different to do with pepperoni. I followed the recipe exactly, but the cooking temperature seemed to be way too high. The first batch I made was burnt to a crisp by 9 minutes, and the second batch was done in about 6 minutes at the same temperature. However, I would have liked them to be slightly crispier in the middle, so next time I will try a lower oven temp with a few test pepperonis first. I also felt that the dip could use a little bit of extra seasoning. Other than that, my boys thought they were genius! We will adjust the temp and make this again.
