Made this for a side dish to share with the family on Easter they couldn't get enough of them, including my aunt who was a professional chef at one time she was practically begging for the recipe

yummy!  I bought portobello tops as well as stuffer mushrooms.  both were great.  the portobello added an earthy flavor and balanced the richness of the chicken mix. oh forgot to mention I doubles the recipe as well.

Fantastic idea! I love buffalo wings  and all kinds of stuffed mushrooms!  My two favorite things in one bite. ... best thing ever.  They went over great with my friends.  I found these a while back on this website foodimakemysoldier.com  alot of good low carb healthy eating  recipes!  And taste great!

I cook a lot  - particularly tons of different appetizers for parties.   I was told this was one of the best apps I ever made!  I may have added a bit more cheese and dressing than called for but otherwise followed the recipe as written

I gave this five stars because it's very self-explanatory. If you like buffalo chicken dip and you like mushrooms, it's a win-win. Actually this recipe turned out better than I expected. I used blue cheese crumbles instead of the dressing and baked in the oven until the cheddar cheese browned. I had to increase oven temp to 400* to brown. I will definitely make this again. Great for a relatively low carb dinner! Thank you for sharing!

I used sweet baby rayes wing sauce. I don't like spicy, I can't handle it. So this was a good choice for me. Really great taste!

Wow that was the best. We could not find large portobello mushrooms so we used baby ports and made a casserole. It was so good!

These were very good and a great low-carb alternative.  I think next time I will use only blue cheese rather than ranch and possibly up the heat a little.

We love this recipe.   Not a blue cheese fan but it  does blend in nicely so that it isnâ€™t hardly noticeable.  Eat this 2-3 times per month.  Thanks for sharing the recipe

I love love love this recipe.  I added another stalk of chopped celery to my liking.  I will use the filling in a low carb wrap one day because its yummy.  Sometimes I add cholula sauce and halve the Frank's.....all to taste and preference.  Minimize or maximize ingredients depending on your mood.

This was delicious. Used large portabella since that was what the store had. Made my own buffalo sauce using the Awesome Slow Cooker Buffalo Wings recipe. Also used Blue Cheese crumbles instead of dressing. Will definitely try this again.

Use siracha sauce instead of wing sauce. large portobello mushrooms are awesome, but be careful to not put too much stuffing into it

This was great. I used regular mushrooms and doubled the recipe. Next time I'll probably ad more buffalo sauce though, I like my food spicy. We ate all TWENTY mushrooms!! There was only two of us.
