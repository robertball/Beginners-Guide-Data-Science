Due to Hubs' sensitive innards, I omitted  the Anaheim peppers, which effectively made these "Zesty Fajitas" as opposed to "Spicy Fajitas."  I just made up for the omission by adding  more bell peppers.  I used "Fajita Seasoning," also from this site, for the fajita seasoning and I was very pleased with it.  I used a combination of thinly sliced strip steak and shrimp, marinating them together with the seasoning and a dribble of water and olive oil.  I saut√©ed the vegetables first, seasoned with the fajita seasoning and garlic.  Once crisp-tender, I removed the mixture from the pan, then continued by cooking the beef and shrimp together.  When that was cooked I combined everything together.  Not only were these easy to throw together, served with a squeeze of fresh lime,  some shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream,  they were awesome good too,  a huge payoff for such little effort invested.

These were very yummy!  I loved how the Anaheim peppers made this a little different than normal fajitas.  Next time I will either use a little more meat or one less pepper (depending on how many people I'm cooking for) because we thought the meat to pepper ratio was a little off.  I will also try making my own seasoning (from this site) so that I can make it extra spicy!  (We love spicy!!)

I can only find one small problem with this recipe.  Over eating.  The taste was fabulous and my husband was so satisfied with this meal.  I did not use the packaged fajita seasoning I used the seasoning recipe from Allrecipes and wouldn't change a thing.  Best round steak dinner I have had ever.

So easy!  Learned something new.  Needed hotter peppers though to really make it spicy.  The Anaheims are like a candles flame.  Needs ghost peppers!!!

I could not find the anaheim chile peppers at our little rural grocery store; so I substituted hot, diced green chilies. Only other change was I used 1/2 of both the red and yellow bell peppers.

This was awesome! Not super fiery hot, but enough spice and fresh taste to make me want to do this one again. Thanks.

Robust flavours!! I too cooked my peppers seperate from the meat as I was uncomfortable seasoning veggies and raw meat together (as i was always taught such). As suggested by others I made my own fahita seasoning. Thank you to the submitter for an easy and healthy recipe.

This is so good and easy to make. I had a beef round roast and used 1/2 the first day and liked this recipe so much made the rest the next. I had to go back to the store for the ingredients again. But it was well worth it!

This is a great recipe. The spice mix is also great for soups/stews.
The only modification I made was to add 1/2 tsp of hot paprika and 1/2 tsp smoked paprika.

Loved these!  i didn't have any anaheim peppers, so i left them out. i used a fajita spice blend from this site as i cannot do "packets" and it was the BOMB!  i cooked my  onions and peppers separate from the beef. i also doubled up on the beef. i served on warm tortillas with sour cream, salsa, avocado and lime wedges. YUM!

Made tonight exactly as directed except store didn't have Anaheim peppers this week so I used jalapenos.  These were not the least bit spicy or even remotely hot.  They tasted okay but there was a lot of juice in the mix so had to use slotted spoon to fill tortilla.  The most redeeming quality of these fajitas was that they were really easy to put together.  But I've had better.  I may use this recipe again but need to find a way to make them truly spicy. Perhaps using the homemade fajita spice mixture is the secret.
