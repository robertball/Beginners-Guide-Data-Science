This is great! I left out the hot sauce and horseradish, and then left out the oysters, and I used a regular drinking glass and some whiskey and ice instead of the vodka, and I added some cola, and it was great!

This was different! Instead of the hot sauce and horseradish, I used a good quality vodka and some spicey Bloody Mary mix, yummy!

I am a HUGE raw oyster fan but GAG!!  EWW!!  Don't waste good oysters!!  I would really like some advice as to which brand of vodka will actually make these tolerable.  The second the alcohol hits the raw oyster, they begin to "cook" and roll off a putrid smell *and taste* that is a cross between rubbing alcohol and lacquer thinner.   I was given this recipe to try from some of my bay friends in San Diego. The restaurants down there that we went to only sell shooters like this.  No matter how bad the taste, I have never spit out food in public - until trying these.  I had to come back to my favorite sushi house in BOISE just to renew my faith and love in raw oysters that were done right.  (Shame on you, San Diego!)  lol
