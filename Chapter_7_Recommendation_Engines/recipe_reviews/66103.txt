This is an awesome dish!!!

In addition to the vanilla extract I added half a vanilla bean. 

If anyone wants to try this and has never worked with real vanilla before:

Cut the bean in half and store the remaining half; cut away the tip of the other end; using a small paring knife, insert the tip of the knife, blade-up, into either end of the bean and slice along the flat side (this motion should be slow and careful to avoid cutting yourself); using the knife, carefully open the split seam using one finger to hold open the section closest to you; using the sharp end of the blade scrape away all of the tiny seeds within the open bean (they are smaller than a grain of sand); repeat the last step as many times as necessary to remove all the tiny seeds, turning the bean around to get at the seeds where you hold the bean open; the seeds AND bean all go into the port base to simmer with the rest of the ingredients.

I'm not a huge fan of fresh figs so this recipe sounded great considering the lovely  fragrant spices and the honey...:) I made a few changes - I didn't have port so I used red wine instead. I sliced the figs in fours so they would absorb even more of the flavors and I added some maple syrup. I served everything over two small scoops of vanilla ice cream - yum!

This recipe is easy and amazing. The flavors blend together well without overpowering each other.  This recipe also works great with pears.

I have made this recipe several times with great results. I won a first place ribbon at our Mid-State Fair in 2011 using this recipe with just one big change. I canned the figs using a water bath method. They were firm and plump and turned out deliciously. If you are into figs this is truly a winner. I added the cream and honey later after opening each jar. Lovely presentation. I think using a vanilla bean is a great addition too.
