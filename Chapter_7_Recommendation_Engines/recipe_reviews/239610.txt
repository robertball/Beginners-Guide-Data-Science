This is a nice recipe for "canning" apple butter, but, I feel additional information is needed.  If you are actually canning, the apple butter should be spooned into sterilized 1/2 pint or pint jars, leaving 1/2" space from the top. Wipe the top and rim edge with a clean damp cloth and place sterilized lids and rings hand tightened on the jars.  Place these jars onto a rack in a boiling water bath. DO NOT PLACE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN. There should be at least 1" of boiling water covering the jars. If the water cools a bit when you add the jars, bring back to a slow rolling boil and process for 5 minutes below 6000 ft and 10 minutes above 6000 feet.  When removing from the water bath, the jar lids should suck down with a pop/ping sound when sealed.  Leave set on a clean towel away from drafts over night. The sealing process may not be immediate.  Press the center of the lids the next day to insure they sealed.  They should be solid.  If not, refrigerate the unsealed jar and use within a week.  If sealed, remove the ring, and wash the jars in hot soapy water, to insure any food that seeped out is removed and no bacteria will grow contaminating the sealed jar.  NOTE:  If the ring will not remove easily, place the jar upside down in the soapy water.  It will loosen and remove easily in a few minutes usually, if not...use this jar first.  Be sure to date the lid with a permanent marker.  HAPPY CANNING!

I followed the ingredients list exactly except I made mine for 12 servings. This yielded a little more than one jar of butter. I cooked the apples in a small slow cooker for 4 hours at low and then switched it to high for another 3.5 hours. I then pureed it with a hand held mixer and added the vanilla. Continued at low with lid off for another 1.5 hours. Totaling 9 hours. This was very easy and fun to make. The entire house smells delicious!

The apples filled my large slow cooker and I got 5 filled 250ml jars plus a bit left over for taste testing. Very easy and tasty.

Great flavor, great spice! Our family really enjoyed this! Thanks for the recipe! So nice to be able to just throw it in the slow cooker and go to bed!

I didn't spice how the recipe recommends, but I cooked it the same. What I really like about this recipe is the ease, and the consistency of the apple butter at the end, which probably comes from cooking it without a lid for a few hours. Most other apple butter recipes don't recommend that, but it makes it nice and thick.

A fool proof recipe! (The canning part is another story - I'm pretty sure I could mess that up. But the recipe itself is great!) 
I slept late, so the apples were in the crock pot for a few hours longer than the recipe suggests. No adverse effects. I reduced the amount of white sugar by 1/2C, because two cups total seemed excessive. Next time I might eliminate the white sugar altogether.  I used 7 golden delicious and 8 red delicious apples and called the result "Double Delicious Apple Butter." It received good reviews from everyone.

Doesn't  taste like my grandma's apple butter. She was from PA and had very deep dutch roots.  I wish I knew her recipes because she was a great cook.  She would have made Bobby Flay blush with her cooking talents.
