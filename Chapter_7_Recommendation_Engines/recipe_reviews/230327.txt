Very juicy leg of lamb! My leg was 4.75 lbs. and it took exactly 2-1/2 hours at 325 to reach 130.  Perfect!  I did rub the leg with a bit of EVOO and vinegar before adding the garlic (I used fresh - inside and out) and rosemary. I threw some potatoes in during the last hour of cooking, and when I took the roast out to rest, cranked up the oven to 425 to crisp up the potatoes a bit. So delicious!  This made a really nice Sunday night dinner.

thank you hkwilkins1!!  this was a very very easy recipe and produced a succulent and very flavorful leg of lamb.  i used a boneless leg of lamb from costco and it was excellent.  i pretty much followed the instructions to a t and was rewarded well for my efforts.  i made a sauce to go with consisting of orange marmalade, hot pepper flakes, fresh mint, and red wine vinegar (a recipe that accompanied one of chef johns grilled lamb chop recipes) and it was excellent as everything from him is.  i love lamb but i remember my mom's (sorry mom!) well done, kinda dried out lamb, with that green jelly, from easters past.  not any more!

JMO, however, while this treatment produces a nicely moist and flavorful piece of lamb, I felt it fell short  of the special extra touch which justifies a five star rating. The only thing I did differently was to layer the dish with thinly sliced potato & Vidalia onion, a middle layer of thinly sliced tomato and then another of potato & onion (each layer about 3/4" deep), each treated with some freshly mashed rosemary in EVOO, before placing the lamb on top. Then, like another reviewer, I roasted the veggies at 450 for about 15 minutes while the meat rested. Been preparing lamb this way for several years w/o the rosemary sprigs; this touch is a definite improvement - thanks hkwilkins1. One tip: use large garlic cloves, trimmed into multiple smaller, chisel-tipped spears roughly the size of small cloves to ease insertion and promote flavor transmission.

Couldn't be easier, except getting the rosemary threaded through the netting, but I don't have much patience :)  I just laid it on a bed of rosemary sprigs and placed more on top.  Came out perfectly!  Thank you!

Very good and easy recipe.  Followed directions to a T and my 4-1/2 roast came out perfect.

Family loved this for Easter.  I couldn't find a big roast so used two less than 3lbs each.  Reached 130 in just about 2 hours at 325. Keeping garlic cloves whole made it interesting to get the larger ones in, so I cut some of them lenghtwise. Made a jucy roast and scented the whole house as well.

It was delicious!  I used herbes de provence as well as the rosemary to rub on the lamb.  It was the best lamb I have eaten.  I will make it again.

This was a delicious and simple way to prepare leg of lamb. I probably didn't quite use 20 cloves of garlic but I think I used about 10 cut in half lengthwise so it was pretty close. I would definitely make this again. We had green beans, rolls ,a cheesy hash brown casserole and cranberry sauce with this and it made for a wonderful Christmas Day meal.

This is a delicious and flavorful recipe. That I will use over and over again during the winter.  I only had a 3lb boneless leg of lamb so I cut the cooking time down to 1 1/2 hours-could have gone with 1 hour-I'll remember that next time.

It was delicious. My husband who said he doesn't like lamb loved it. I did not have garlic cloves, so I used chopped garlic from a jar. I spread Dijon on it, sprinkles the chopped garlic, garlic powder, chopped rosemary on and rubbed it in. Sprinkled with powdered garlic, salt and pepper and covered with plastic wrap. Let it sit for several hours and cooked it for two hours in my NuWave oven. Tender, juicy and flavorful.

Great garlic-Rosemary flavor. Served with mint jelly and horseradish sauce--take your pick.  Mashed potatoes and asparagus with a N.Y. cheesecake from this site--outstanding.

Great and easy to prepare. After adding massive amounts of garlic clove,  I pat the roast down with olive oil and sprinkle liberally with my home made Greek spice which I made following the Greek spice recipe I found on Allrecipes as well. It's the one that is similar to Cavendars. I use a countertop turbo broiler (convection), took about 1:45 for a 4 lb roast @325.

For a delicious lamb roast, this recipe is great as a place to start. My grandmother used to prepare lamb a lot and I took a page from her book and brushed olive oil on the roast and added fresh ground pepper and a bit of cumin along with the garlic cloves and garlic pepper. My roast was twice the size so I cooked it longer but the result was still a moist and flavorful roast.
Lamb is a staple in our house for some holidays and I will definitely make this in the future.

It got rave reviews from everyone at my table. I cut my garlic cloves into smaller slivers to stick into the meat. Also, my lamb leg didn’t come with netting so I just laid my rosemary sprigs on top. After the lamb was finished I made a red wine pan sauce with the drippings. I’ll probably be making this every Easter!

I made this and there was nothing left but the bone of the lamb!
This time I am going to try this without the bone!
