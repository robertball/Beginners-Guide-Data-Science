Yum!  Be sure to put 1/2 the cheese on the roll 1st (under the zucchini mixture), then the rest of the cheese on top of the zucchini mixture.  It prevents the bread from getting soggy.
Wonderful recipe!  It got the picky SO to eat a veggie that isn't our favorite!    
I think this would be a hit with most kids, too.

Here's what I did, sauteed the zucchini (I quartered my 3/4 inch thick circle slices) in olive oil and sprinkled with seasoning salt. I then used pizza sauce instead of marinara since we had it on hand. After heating this all up I just tossed in the shredded mozzarella and cooked it all together then put it on my toasted hoagie rolls. I added an extra sprinkle of mozzarella because I love cheese.  It was so delicious!  If you toast the rolls first then just melt the cheese in with your zucchini it will not make your rolls soggy and it is also quicker to throw together. This is one of my new favorite recipes!  It is so versatile! The next day I had some extra yellow summer squash and used it in place of the zucchini and had an equally delicious grinder. I'm sure you could use eggplant too, and maybe even add some olives and feta cheese.  The possibilities are endless but the base recipe it great as is!

Fabulous is right!!!!  I just finished eating these for dinner and had to run upstairs immediately to give them the 5 stars they deserve.   I used olive oil instead of butter, and added a red pepper cut into bite size pieces and a chopped onion, plus some garlic powder and italian seasonings.  YUMMY.  Meat-eating boyfriend loved too!  Thanks for a great healthy recipe!!!

These were really great.  I added onion and mushrooms to the zucchini.  To avoid soggy bread I used sliced provolone cheese instead of shredded and lined the bread with cheese so that the sauce wouldn't soak into the bread.  It worked great.  Next time I'm going to try adding some vegetarian Italian sausage crumbles to these.  Yum!

Absolutely fantastic and so quick and easy.  I used just zucchini and it was perfect. My husband modified his by chopping leftover chicken from the night before and following the general recipe after that and he said his was woderful too.  I would recommending using more zuchinni.  I used 3 medium ones and it really wasn't enough four three let alone for sandwiches.  Also, I would put the cheese in the middle of the sandwich as you will loose some to the tinfoil otherwise.  Finally, you may want to toast your rolls a little before filling them.  We found the inside gets pretty soggy from all the sauce otherwise.

yum!  I toasted my bread in the oven as it pre-heated and the grinder turned out nice and crisp.  Next time I think I'll add mushrooms and black olives.

This recipe was simple and delicious.  I used olive oil instead of butter to make it a bit healthier.  I also used mozarella slices (what I had) and put the slice on the bun, then added zucchini filling resulting in nice melted cheese.  Will definitely make again.

I agree, cut the zucchini pieces small!  I used a sausage spaghetti sauce, so satisfied my need for a bit of meat.  Also used slices of fresh mozarella and ciabatta rolls, cooked in the toaster oven, without foil.  I really enjoyed them, but maybe I went a little overboard on the red pepper - they were spicy!

This is absolutely fantastic.  My husand is not a big fan of zucchini, but he loved this so much he took all the leftovers to work the next day.

I split the bun and toast it in the oven, as others mentioned.  I also tore out a little bit of the crumb (the interior bread) to create a little hollow for the zucchini to go into; that way, there wasn't so much squirting out the sides.  I've made it   three times, each time adding something different (garlic, onions, crumbled bocca burger), but it's fabulous just the way it is, as well.

Okay- with my changes this is a 5 star recipe, but in its original state, I only give it a four for improper cooking method.  Rather than sauteeing the zucchini in butter, I roasted it at 400 degrees in my oven for about 30 minutes, which leaves it nice and sweet and tender, but without all the liquid, which from reading the reviews for this recipe is the main problem with it.  As a result of the roasting, I had absolutely no leaking sauce or soggy rolls!!!  I roasted it with some olive oil, chopped fresh garlic, and the red pepper flakes.  Perfect!  I put cheese down first in my hoagies, them topped with the zucchini, then a layer of sauce, more zucchini, and more cheese!  I will definitely make these again! Yum!

These were a surprising delight!  I followed the recipe to a "T", though I prob used less mozzarella to save a few calories.  Super easy, super cheap, loaded w/veggies, & super yummy!  My only complaint is they were slightly hard/messy to eat.  Next time, I'll mix a little cheese in w/the zukes/sauce before loading the roll and reserve just a bit for topping so you get some cheese w/every bite.  THANKS for a great weeknight meal!

Fabulous doesn't even BEGIN to describe how incredibly awesome these grinders were.  So simple and SO good!  Sure, you're going to make a mess while eating it, but who cares!?  Made these as written with the addition of 1/4 onion chopped and 1 clove minced garlic to the zucchini.  I made my own 7" italian bread grinder rolls (Cheesy Italian Bread recipe from this site makes 4 perfect rolls - highly recommend it) and this grinder was DELICIOUS!  Since the bread was fresh out of the oven, it was crispy & warm, sliced open (almost all the way through), laid them flat on a baking sheet (cut side up), put cheese on both sides under the broiler to melt, put the filling on one side, topped filling w/ more cheese, put it under the broiler again to melt, could barely close the sandwich, and we LOVED IT!  The Hubster could not stop raving about this sandwich.  Will make this again & again!  And will definitely make my own bread for it.  So good!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

These were fabulous! I didn't have any rolls so I just sandwiched the zucchini betweens slices of toasted white bread instead.  This is my preference, but I also added some sugar to the marinara sauce to cut down on some of the sourness of the sauce.  Delicious!

I sauteed the diced zucchini with some red onions and fresh mushrooms in olive oil and minced garlic and a couple shakes of Italian seasoning. I then added pizza sauce, just about half a cup. Rubbed a bit of olive oil on the bun and topped with some poppy seeds and then toasted just the bun on the gas grill outside for about four minutes, did not cover with foil as stated. Then placed sliced mozzarella cheese on the bottom seam, topped with zucchini mixture and then shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top and some black olives. Placed back on gas grill on cookie sheet and heated until cheese was melted, about five to six more minutes. Used more pizza sauce on the side as dipping sauce. They were more than Fabulous and not soggy like many reviews stated. And we didn't heat the house up with the oven inside. Perfect summer sandwich, and very filling. We are going to make this again and soon.
By the way both my husband and I think just the zucchini mixture alone would be great on pasta.

Excellent. I toasted the rolls before loading them up and suggest doing so. I also used garlic powder instead of red pepper since I am not a fan of red pepper. This was easy and quick to make.

I'm only giving this 4 stars only b/c the rolls get soggy when baking them. The flavor is definately 5 star. I made exactly as written and made my own sauce . I sauteed 1/2 small onion and 1 clove of garlic in 2tb olive oil added 1 large chopped tomato, 1tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1tsp balsamic vinegar , 1 tsp red wine vinegar, 1tsp fresh ground black pepper,1 tsp sea salt and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. simmered on low until tomato was broken down. I will be making these again. Thanks!

I was really excited about these, but they really weren't that great.  Not bad, but not great.  I preferred to eat the mixture in itself rather than on the roll.  I also added pepper and onions.

We really liked these!   Served it as the main meal and my husband gave it 2 thumbs up!   As another suggested I mixed in some cheese prior to loading on the bun and broiled for a few mins in lieu of wrapping with foil and baking!

This was so easy and a great way to use up some extra zuchinni (and healthier than if I'd just made zuchinni bread like I'd originally planned). I made my own marinara sauce and spread the mixture out over one large loaf of French bread, which I then cut in half to make two huge sandwiches. I didn't have any mozzarella, but monteray jack worked just fine. I will definitely make this again.

OMG! This recipe is simply fabulous.I love zucchini and found I will have to add this to my "must haves". This recipe was quick and easy to prepare. Wrapping the grinder in foil and baking for 10 minutes was the icing on thrcake. Simply delicious!!

Yum! My 5 yo son and hubby love these!! We prefer monterey jack cheese, and make sauce as directed, substituting Trader Joe's marinara sauce for the canned tomatoes, and don't blend in the blender. I've tried "cheating" by only using spaghetti sauce. It simply isn't as good. Add the extra ingredients to the sauce!

Having this for lunch today and it's fabulous as promised.  Made the zucchini/marinara mixture last night with a sprinkling of shredded parmesan that I had on hand, then toasted a roll at work before stuffing it with cheese and the zucchini mixture and microwaving it.  Hearty and so easy.

I had leftover sauteed zucchini and yellow squash and used it to make these.  I skipped the foil and just put it under the broiler until the cheese melted. I made these twice this week and can't imagine wrapping them. The first one totally fell apart from the moisture as it was but the second time I toasted the roll first and drained the veggie mixture with better results.

I had seen a lot of people talking about this recipe, so I had to try it. I used arrabiata sauce (spicy marinara) and they were amazing! I took the hint from others and added fresh garlic while I cooked the zucchini. I also lined the roll with mozzarella and broiled. My husband HATE zucchini and he thought these were wonderful! Thank YOU!

My boyfriend and I thought this recipe was incredible! The only changes we made were to add sauteed onion and garlic as well as red wine to the sauce. Then, to avoid a soggy sandwich, we poured everything into a casserole dish with the mozzerella on top and baked it until the cheese was melted and browned. Then we toasted the bread and spooned the sauce mixture onto it. Seriously awesome!

So good and so quick.  I did saute the zucchini, but instead of red pepper I used a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic.  I served it warm on ciabatta rolls with a salad.  Quick, delicious, and healthy!

These were great! We had several overgrown zucchini, and this was the perfect use for them. I lost a little cheese to the tin foil; next time I will make sure it is in the center of the sandwich.

Is there no end to the great uses for zucchini? These grinders are terrific, and I'm pretty sure even non-zucchini people will find them delicious. The zucchini cubes, if cut large, may be a little hot when you bite into them. Cut them small, and enjoy!

We loved this, though I did make a few changes.  I used fresh tomatoes out of my garden.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half, it was a little sweet for my taste.  I added some diced onion, sliced mushrooms and sliced banana pepper to the diced summer squash.  I toasted my bread, hollowed out some of the interior, and placed half the cheese on the bottom.  Once I put the contents in I put it in the oven without wrapping it and let it back for about 10 minutes until the cheese melted.  Bread wasn't soggy at all.  We will make this often until the squash runs out!

This really was fabulous but only thanks to the comments of others.  I cooked zucchini in a saucepan with a some onions and oil. When they were almost ready, i added 3 gloves of minced garlic and several spoons of sauce (wanted to have more of zucchini taste than sauce). After a coupe of minutes i added a bit of shredded mozarella and feta chesse. They melted immediately. I then served the zucchini on toaster toasted bread covered with shredded mix of mozarella, feta and basilic. Soft zucchini on crunchy bread was absolutely fabulous and served us as a nice dinner.  Will make them again for sure. Thanks everybody

Wow really really good.... a lot of work though but in the end it was worth it... because i made these in the summer i heated my grilled to 350 turned off the middle burner and "baked" them there for 15 minutes... they turned out great... I also followed another reviewers suggestion of putting cheese on top and underneither to keep the bread from getting too soggy... I also added some sliced pepperoni to them for a pizza touch... and used best marinara sauce yet off this site...great recipe... although there is some prep time involved...

Yummy! Used olive oil instead of butter, grilled my zucchini instead of fried.....and ate mine w/o the roll.....OK....so I cant totally rate this one cause I made my own rules. But the small casserole was amazing.....and yes I have had zucchini parm sammies in the past and know that they are amazing......So a 5 for a great recipe and a 5 for my low carb/low fat version. Thanks!

I thought these were pretty good, and much better than I expected. It made for a rather quick meal to which was nice. I used one large baguette and cut it into 5 even sized pieces. I normally leave out red pepper flakes and even black pepper out of recipes, but because there were so few ingredients I followed the recipe exactly. I was out of homemade marinara and used Newman's brand marinara and it worked great. Just make sure sandwiches come close to closing before wrapping because the cheese will stick to the foil and be careful because the filling is hot! Let them sit a bit to cool in the foil. Thanks for the easy recipe.

I gave this 5 stars, because it deserves it, but I did also  completely changed the recipe, I was so inspired by it. But I thought others might like to try what I did, so - I grilled a package of Italian sausages on a George Foreman grill and sliced them, and sauteed in butter, along with the zucchini, a package of sliced portobella mushrooms and a diced red bell pepper. Also added 2 tsp fennel seeds and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Combined all with the marinara and mozzarella (next time will use 1 c parmesan in place of 1 c mozz). I just ate like this (I call it Italian Sausage and Zucchini Skillet) but it would be the bomb on the toasted bread too. THANKS for the inspiration!!!

I made this on sandwich thins, and it was great.  My husband and I both really liked the sandwiches, but I thought they'd be better with green onions, peppers and mushrooms.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but I'm going to experiment with it a bit.

***Update: I made this sandwich again using garlic, onions, peppers and mushrooms, and it really was "fabulous."  Yum!***

I really liked these, but I'm the only zuke-liker in our family of five.  However, two of the non-likers also liked them - one a little, the other a lot.  The other two were neutral, though one of them ate two sandwiches.  We followed the suggestions to toast the bread while the oven was heating and to put cheese down first as a sauce barrier.  No soggy bread here!  We also used about one small/medium zuke per sandwich and Mexican cheese blend instead of mozzarella (it's what was already in the fridge)).

Very good! I added garlic, oregano, and parm cheese in the sauce. I did toast the buns prior. Next time I will not wrap in foil. The cheese stuck to the top.

Wow, these are really good! My husband was skeptical when he peaked at the laptop to see what I was preparing. His comment..."can't you throw some meat in there?" After the second bite his comment..." surprisingly, these are great!". I added sliced baby bella mushrooms to the zucchini, otherwise no changes. I'll make these again for sure! I served a fresh tomato salad as a side dish.

I loved this!  It made a very Weight Watcher friendly evening meal (4 points).  I sauteed the zucchini in Brummel and Brown and used Prego Heart Smart Italian Sauce.  I served it over light buns that I toasted under the broiler.  I loved the kick the red pepper flakes gave it.  A very tasty, filling, no meat meal.

Loved this.  Had everything on hand. I did add some garlic to the zucchini. Upped the red pepper flakes. Put the chesse on the bread, then the zucchini sauce, to prevent sogginess.  My husband's reaction, "A zucchini Sandwich?!?!"  And he was against the idea....but then he loved it.  Five stars all around

I give these a 4-star rating as written, but they're a 5-star recipe (IMO) when made with sliced chicken breast in the sammie too. A keeper for sure.

These were easy and good (and healthy which is always good). I sauteed the zucchini in butter and olive oil with some garlic. Omitted the red pepper flakes because I don't like spicy and added some grated parmesan cheese. I served them on the "french bread rolls to die for" from this site and spread a thin layer of pesto on the bottom of the roll. It was so good! My 4 year old and 1 1/2 year old boys even loved them! Definitely will be making often.

I made this one with some ground sausage and used hamburger rolls, for a more casual lunch. My family loved it and everyone stuffed themselves. I was amazed how easy it was to get them to eat zucchini this way. :)

These were fabulous, though I did take a few "liberties" with the recipe.  I added garlic and onion to jar sauce to jazz it up.  I have a picky 16 year old so I added Turkey meatballs.  Everyone loved the sandwichs and we used the leftovers on a pizza crust covered with mozarella cheese.

Very good -- I expected to like this, but I liked it even more than I expected!! I made this the evening before and took into work, reheating the zucchini and cheese and putting in a warmed whole wheat tortilla.  The part that didn't fit in the tortilla was delicious just as is!  I have a new healthy vegetarian and economical lunch!  Thanks

The sandwich was flavorful and not too saucy. Next time I might use smoked mozzarella for a slightly different flavor. An excellent way to use that bumper crop of  summer zucchini.

These sandwiches are GREAT.  I did not have fresh basil, used dried and a little Italian spice.  I also threw some red pepper in with the zucchini. I toasted the buns for maybe 3 minutes before I put all the fixings in.  I put cheese on bottom and top, had NO problem with the sandwich becoming soggy.  Thank You!!!

I made this with pre-fab marinara sauce (Classico), so I added some fresh garlic to the zucchini saute. Easy and sooo delicious!

Very tasty. I made one giant sandwich using a french bread loaf and cut it into portions to serve. It was great. The problem was just with mechanics. Keeping the filling from spilling out is nearly impossible and made for a deliciously messy sandwich, As long as my garden pops out the zucchini, I am going to make this.

So yummy.  I did make a couple of minor changes: sauteed summer squash in olive oil & made my own marinara out of fresh tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic & red wine.  After looking at the photos, I wish I would have added mushrooms too!  Now I'm ready to make them again!

With all of the 5 star reviews I truly hate to be the naysayer- I truly WANTED to love these.  I hated them.  My husband refused to even eat them.  I'm a good cook and that has never, EVER happened before.  They were terrible.  The mouthfeel was awful, the taste not much better.  My husband tried dumping extra sauce and cheese on them and eating them with a fork but still, just couldn't make himself eat them.  I ate them, but just because I didn't want to waste food.  Would definitely not make again, huge disappointment.

Pretty amazing..and so simple! Even my carnivorous boyfriend loved them! He said he had thought about adding some meatballs to his, but thought it was perfect just as it was without them! 

I did make a few changes tho..I used olive oil instead of butter, and sauteed some garlic and mushrooms with the zucchini. Next time, I will definitely add more red pepper flakes and possibly a few more herbs and spices.

This was surprisingly delicious! The only changes I made was I used a half can of diced tomatoes and added about a tablespoon of tomatoe paste (I didn't have any sauce on hand) I also added garlic. I toasted the rolls and then added the zucchini mixture so the rolls wouldn't get soggy. I topped with cheese before serving (the cheese melted quickly inside the grinder) and served with sweet potatoe fries. Even my picky niece loved it!

Very good for a vegetarian sandwich. I did use an extra zucchini to bulk up the filling. Next time, I will consider substituting parmesan for half the mozarella to give a little more flavor. I also used the tip from another reviewer to place some of the cheese in the roll first so it doesn't get too soggy.

Absolutely fantastic!!  I have made these on chiabatta  rolls, english muffins, bagels, etc.  I broil the bread with the mozzarella cheese before adding zucchini mixture.  I also add olives and sometimes mushrooms to the mixture and my family LOVES them!!

I thought this was just okay.  The texture of the zucchini is a sandwich like this was a little weird for me.  I'd rather just have soy meatball subs, but that's just me!

I made this for lunch because it sounded so yummy and I just had to try it before dinner time.  I followed the recipe, except for adding a little onion and garlic for more flavor.  It tasted like pizza on a roll with zucchini.  Very disappointing.  Two stars.
However, I find it is worth 4 stars because I tweaked it for our tastes.  I combined this recipe with our classic Philly cheesesteak recipe.  After sauteeing the zucchini, 1/4 onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, basil to taste, and a sprinkle of montreal steak seasoning, I set it aside and cooked my frozen steak sandwich meat.  The secret ingredient to a Philly cheesesteak is adding cheesewhiz to the steakmeat.  I then added the sauce to the meat, and piled it all on the roll with some shredded mozzerella cheese, and baked it in the oven as directed.  I also lightly toasted the roll, as another reviewer suggested, to keep teh roll from getting soggy.  
Those flavors really worked well together.  It might have been the best steak sandwich I've ever eaten.  I served with sweet potato fries and a salad.  I will definitely be making this again.

These are fabulous!!  I didn't have the sandwich roll so I used some ciabatta bread I need to use up. Also I added some sliced onion in with the zucchini.  Delicious!

I love this super simple recipe. I saute the zucchini in olive oil instead of butter, and I add minced garlic. I broil these in my toaster oven and leave them open-faced so the cheese browns a little.

This is such a clever idea!  I used half zucchini, half mushrooms, tossed them with some olive oil, salt and pepper, then roasted them at 400 for about 20 minutes instead of sauteing them.  I did it this way because I was feeling lazy and didn't want to stand over the stove!  I used homemade marinara sauce because this is one of those recipes that you're really only going to love if you love the sauce.  We love zucchini and mushrooms and thought these were great.  You could pop the sandwiches in the microwave but the bread gets nice and crisp on the outside if you bake them :)

these were AMAZING!!! Followed the recipe exactly except for serving them on whole wheat hamburger buns bc its what I had on hand. THe bread did get a little soggy so next time I will either toast the bread a lot more, use the cheese as a barrier between the bread and sauce or both.... but trust me, there will be a next time!! Delicious!!!!

I LOVE this recipe! It is great as is, but can easily be adjusted. I like to saute an onion with the zucchini and add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little zip. Easy and fast weeknight meal!

Delicious!  I made one saucepan with zucchini and one with eggplant, and everyone in my family preferred the texture of the eggplant.  I will definitely make this a regular recipe, except using eggplant instead of zucchini to meet our tastes.  I also added some red wine with the sauce, and it worked very well.  As other reviewers suggested, I broiled the bread (plus butter and garlic of course!) on its own, added the cheese to the filling, then combined just before serving.  This was easier than individually wrapping each sandwich and baking, and the bread was not soggy at all.

we were awaiting fireworks and only got matches out of this one... not anywhere near as delicious as we'd hoped.   What do I expect, though?  It was the easiest recipe on the planet. (Kids picked out the zuccini & ate the grinders zucc-free, saying, "ah, now it tastes like pizza!")

Fabulous is an understatement!  I wanted to dress this up a little to serve for a luncheon.  I sliced the zucchini instead of chopping it and rather than mixing it with the marinara sauce, I layered everything on the sandwich.  Then I broiled it in the oven to have a nice toasted sandwich.  The toasting really enhanced the flavor.

All 3 of us were super underwhelmed by these grinders & I even added mushrooms, italian seasoning, red onion to one of them (which helped a little) and some grated parm cheese & it was still just missing something.  Sorry for the low rating, but this just wasn't at all what I was expecting.  :(

Absolutely delicious! I'm brand new at cooking, as well as newly vegetarian, and this recipe was easy for me to understand/follow. Plus it was soooo good. My non-vegetarian parents loved it too! Will definitely make this again.  Side note-- I made this exact recipe for three people, and there was just enough. You may want to use more of the ingredients for four people if you want a lot of the zucchini mixture on each grinder.

Awesome!  I had some mushrooms about to go bad, so I threw those in with the zukes.  I used leftover pizza sauce in place of the marinara.  I served these on rolls I made using the recipe "Italian Bread for the Bread Machine" from this site.  Great use for zucchini.

Wow, yummy, yummy, wow!  I added a bit of onion and yellow pepper, and I used havarti and parmesean cheese, as that's all I had on hand.  When I discovered that I didn't have bread, I used a pita.  I have some left over zucchini "stuffing", so I am already looking forward to eat this again tomorrow!

Really good, healthy and quick to prepare!  I also added onions, garlic and bell pepper strips to the saute mixture and used whole wheat pita rounds in place of the hoagies - a thin spread of Prego, fancy shredded colby jack and cheddar cheese on top and garnished with fresh diced tomatoes!  My husband and I loved it and it filled us up.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a 10 star recipe!  I cannot believe something so simple is so absolutely delicious.  It was fast and easy.  I think it is now my favorite grinder.  I think using a good sauce (I used Nanny's Spaghetti Sauce) was the most important part.  I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have an overabudance of zucchini.  I can't wait to make it again!

The 1st time we made this it was ok, but it had plenty of potential.  The 2nd time around it was FANTASTIC!  Here is what we did: 1) We did NOT toast the rolls first as they came out too crunchy. 2) As others suggested, we dug out some of the bread after we semi-split them to allow more room for the good stuff. 3) We used a mix of sliced &  shredded mozzarella. The slices went into the dug out part, some of the shredded went along the bottom of the unsliced part of the roll. This prevented the rolls from getting mushy. 4) We added sauteed onions & garlic.  This added to the flavor A LOT!! 5) We also sauteed the zucchini until it was MORE than tender. 6) We added Lightlife Smart Ground "Beef" crumble for extra protein. I'm sure real ground beef would be just as good. 7) Topped the rolls with with the remaining shredded cheese.  This will be become a regular in our home!  Enjoy!

This was really, really good.  I ran my Italian rolls under the broiler first so they wouldn't become soggy with the veggies.  I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic in place of the marinara sauce.  The cheese did stick a bit to the foil which made the sandwich a little messy.  But who cares?  It tasted great.

These were excellent!  I am giving 4 stars since I changed the recipe a bit to make it better.  I used zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions.  Left the cheese out because that is a lot of cheese and not necessary.  Instead I sprinkled Parmesan on top.  I also didn't bake them, just spooned the mixture into the bread.

These were pretty quick, easy and delicious!  I used olive oil instead of butter, and since I only had plain tomato sauce on hand I added onion, garlic, basil, oregano and a smidge of sugar, as if making my own sauce, then let it cook down a bit.  Also added some sliced baby bella mushrooms, because I like them.  Served on crusty french bread, which I hollowed out to save a few "white bread" calories/carbs as well as make room for more of that yummy zucchini filling.  Topped with mozzarella and parmesan and toasted.  This was a much more satisfying meal than I was expecting it to be, and one that I will surely make again.

This recipe is great despite the fact I completely messed up the premise of the recipe.  My little gizmo to cube stuff broke, so I tossed my zucchini into the food processor, sauteed in olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning.  I added a roasted red pepper and garlic tomato sauce along with some mozzarella and provolone shredded cheese mix.  So I'm looking at this zucchini mix that looks more like sloppy joes wondering what I'm going to do now.  I split the buns and served them like an open face sloppy joe, tossed some more cheese on top and WOW!  This is the most delicious way I've ever had zucchini!  My husband had seconds and my picky 7 y/o son ate quite a bit without complaining.

Very good!  I sauteed the zucchini in olive oil.  Also toasted the roll on a pan on the stove and put a slice of provolone cheese on the roll, and the zucchini mixture on top - I did not put it in the oven. Oh my gosh, it was SO good!  The cheese melted around it and it was gooey and delicious.  Thanks for the great way to use zucchini!

I just made this for lunch, and it was wonderful! I absolutely loved it! My husband, who is a meat eater, loved it too! He is taking the leftovers to work tonight. I pretoasted the buns, and added a little bit of cheese on both sides, as suggested by other reviewers. This was a keeper! Thank you!

I absolutely LOVE these. I use olive oil instead of the butter, and depending on how I'm feeling I might use a different kind of cheese, like cheddar or provolone. I also love them served on wheat rolls.

These truly were fabulous! I didn't want to buy rolls just for these, so I served it on top of lightly toasted bread like an open-faced sandwich.  Excellent, and very easy and quick if you've already got the marinara handy!

These were really good. With added yellow pepper and sliced onions in the mix I would give the recipe five stars. I made my own marinara sauce which help in the flavor also. You can also use zuchini to make vegetarian reubens.

Great recipe! I loved the tangy taste the zucchini sucked up from the salsa, and the red pepper really put a zing to them! Easy and quick, too...I didn't change a thing.

I loved these!  I used a loaf of ciabatta bread instead of french rolls, used olive oil instead of butter, added some italian seasoning and minced garlic to the zuchinni, and pressed them together on my Foreman grill until the cheese melted and the bread was slightly crunchy.  Just like a panini.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

These were so good!  I added onion and mushrooms just because I had them on hand.  You really can add anything you like.  I used hot jack cheese and they turned out great!  Very fast and easy too.  Thanks Your Highness!

These are not bad. I think we would have liked them more if there was something more in them...like some more veggies or some meat. I loved the red pepper in these. I will probably make these again sometime in the future when we something different.

This is one of the best ways to use zucchini, Make sure to toast the bagette so they don't get soggy, and make sure to season the zucchini well.

Super easy vegetarian friendly recipe. I was so lazy and just used canned marinara and it took about 10 minutes to put this whole thing together. Will make next time with homemade sauce and I'm sure it will be even better.

Absolutely Fabulous! Next time I am going to be aware of the issue with the cheese sticking to the tinfoil. Other than that, a delicious, easy and cheap recipe. The marinara sauce was very good. I made a six inch sandwich for my best friend and one for myself on my first run through. She absolutely loved it.

I sautéed sliced onions and sliced red pepper with the zucchini.  Toasting the rolls added a little crunch which was nice.  The feedback is that they needed "a little more" so maybe next time I'll add mushrooms...  Basically more veggies.

These were really good. Rated 4 stars due to changes needed to prevent sandwich from being soggy. Followed many other reviews and toasted rolls in oven about 5 mins. before filling with zucchini and sauce mixture. Placed a mixture of Italian cheeses on bottom of the roll, a bit mixed in the sauce and a some on top. Baked uncovered for another 5 mins, or so.

These things are incredible. I made them last night and even my 18 month old son ate every last bite of his 'mini sandwich'. I added 4 cloves of garlic to the marinara and used cilantro instead of basil since that is what I had in the fridge. The marinara was great and I think it really makes the grinder. Did half cheese on the bread after I toasted it and half on top after I added the toppings. Added some red onions and sliced mushrooms to the zucchini mixture and topped with raw red onion and banana peppers. Yum. Will definitely be making like once a week, haha. Thanks!

This was absolutely wonderful! I had a chicken breast I had baked the night before that I diced up and threw in after I cooked the zucchini since I knew my very picky kids would probably snub their noses at just zucchini.  I also added half a white onion to the zucchini mixture for added flavor.  This really was so, so good! I toasted the hoagies, laid very thin slices of provolone on the bottom so the bread wouldn't get soggy, and then layered as instructed. I sprayed the foil with oil so the cheese wouldn't stick once I rolled the sandwiches up and baked them in the oven.  I will definitely be making this super simple recipe again!

These were very good.  I did butter, garlic and toast the bread before building the sandwhich.  It helped it hold up to the sauce.

Added onions, garlic, and a sweet red pepper and WOW.  Like many other reviewers, my carnivore husband asked me why I cooked him chicken when he would eat just that.  Too bad I can't get him to eat mushrooms, or else they definitely would've been a part of this fabulous meal.  Definitely on the list of recipes I will cook again and again!

Great vegetarian sandwich option. Very filling. I only wish I could get the cheese to brown a bit without burning the bread. Ah well. Perhaps it's my oven.

I added pickled cherry peppers for extra flavor and heat. Loved the combination.

The first time I made these, they were alright, but not amazing.  The second time, I amped them up a bit, and they were delicious.  I sauteed chopped onion and garlic  and sliced mushrooms with the zucchini and added extra red pepper flakes (I like spicy).  I also added  dried oregano and basil upon adding the marinara.  Like other reviewers, I toasted the sandwich rolls under the broiler for a few minutes to keep the bread from getting soggy.  With these additions,I really enjoyed this and will definitely make it again!

I really enjoyed these. They are good as written but i also make with onions and sautee in oil oil. Also, I do not like a lot of sauce on my food so i only put enough sauce to coat the veggies. Delish! I will be keeping this recipe

I liked this we used vegan mozzarella cheese.  I think I would grill up some onions with the zucchini the next time I make it.

I have to say I was skeptical at first on this recipe but I was sick of soup and had zucchini that had to be used.  I only made a couple of changes, I added some chopped onion, green and red bell pepper, and garlic.  It was AMAZING.  We loved it so much we had to have it two nights in a row.  LIke others we toasted our bread first.

I actually did not think that a zucchini sandwich would taste good, but it turned out really great.
'I had just picked another zucchini and thought what the heck am I going to use this one for. so I made the grinder and was happily surprised.

Loved by all!  I used whole wheat burger buns because I couldn't find healthy hoagies.  I sprinkled a thin layer of cheese (I used shredded Italian Blend) on the bottom of half of each and had no problem with sogginess (I mixed the rest into the vege blend).  I coarsely grated the zucchini (which worked perfectly) and added onion, garlic, and bell pepper to the saute.  While I did salt the zucchini, this seemed unnecessary ~ Just drain well after it cooks down.  I used more marinara and only one cup of cheese, which was plenty.  YUM!

I followed this exactly to use up some leftover homemade marinara sauce.  Definitely toast the buns before you put the sauce on!  A crusty french bread holds up better than sausage buns (they go a bit soggy no matter what!).

Amazing! My mom is gluten free and my sister is gluten free and vegan, so I had to swap out regular buns for gluten free buns and regular cheese for rice cheese on theirs and they still turned out great! Such a fast, easy recipe!

I followed another reviews suggestion of melting the cheese with the marinara sauce, zucchini, red pepper, and a little cajun seasoning, and it was delicious. Used whole wheat baguettes because that's all I had. Even my picky boyfriend liked it.

I was skeptical but these really were delicious.  I sautéed the zucchini in olive oil with chopped onions and a little garlic before mixing in marinara sauce.  Melted the cheese on the rolls in a toaster oven.  Then just scooped the zucchini mixture in and sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on top. Didn't miss the meat at all-actually think I preferred this to meatball grinders.

I make this with zucchini, yellow squash, or eggplant (depending on what I have). They taste excellent! Even DH agrees that these are wonderful and he doesn't miss having meat on his sandwich/sub at all.

Intersting filling for a grinder.  Turned out really good.  We did use grinder rolls that were sprayed with olive oil (have one of things that you add your own olive oil, pump the top and spray), rubbed with garlic and broiled before adding the zucchini, sauce and cheese.  No sog here!

This was amazing. I am vegetarian, but I wanted to cook for my boyfriend and his roommates as well, so I made the zucchini and marina in one pan, and in another pan I cooked up ground turkey with onions and garlic, then added the marina and zucchini. They turned out fabulous, and the meat eaters loved them! They were like a healthy and less messy version of sloppy joes. I will definitely make these again!

Followed recipe exactly. Very good but still very "veggie." I've been trying to find vegetarian recipes that don't make us miss meat but use something else besides mushrooms. This one will be repeated, but we still miss the meat.

excellent! definately a keeper and very versatile. I sauted mushroom, onion,green pepper with the zuchini. Also sent my hubby to the store to get hoagie buns & he came home with the wrong thing....so plan "b" we used a pa rbaked pizza crust and used the zucchini mixture as our topping and added the cheese on top. Popped it back in the oven to melt, what a happy accident!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous! Couple small changes: toasted buns instead of baking due to it being the middle of the summer. Used Sargento, italian blend w seasoning cheese.

Wonderful mild flavor and a very smooth and enjoyable texture.  Also, a great (and healthy) meal to use up the zucchini flooding out of our garden.  And with a toaster oven, it kept the house cool.  I added some Italian herbs and garlic but skimped on the red pepper after so often over-doing it in other recipes, and I was at first disappointed that it was so mild.  When I sprinkled a tad more on it really warmed up and filled out the flavor!  Definitely adding this to the summer meals list.

I scaled the recipe to 1 serving, used regular sandwhich bread, and a provolone cheese. I also broiled the grinder in the oven to make it crispy-crunchy and to prevent sogginess. Super yummy!

I did add garlic as others suggested..& I know the point of this is that it's meatless but I can't help to wonder how these would be with a little pepperoni too??

Loved this sandwich!  I made it tonight for my guy using 2 large zucchinis and 2 fresh white mushrooms, onion powder, plenty of fresh-pressed garlic, and red pepper flakes, all sauteed in olive oil.  For the sauce, I used Muir Glen organic tomato basil pasta sauce, which worked great! For the bread, I used mini french loaves (about 5-6" in length), warming them in the oven at 350 degrees with a little butter and provolone (skipped the foil) before adding the filling, topping with a little mozzarella, and broiling for a couple minutes.  Tasted great and there are plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's sandwiches. ;-)   As a non-vegetarian, it's nice having a meat-less dish option. I will absolutely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

Yum!  These were fabulous!  I sauteed some garlic and onions with the zucchini.  And, instead of wrapping the sandwich to bake it, I assembled and then placed it under the broiler on low for a couple of minutes to toast the bread & melt the cheese.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

I'm sorry, but I've never been so disappointed by a recipe on this site, and I've been using Allrecipes.com for years!  I absolutely love my veggies--especially zucchini!--but despite adding onions and mushrooms as other reviewers suggested, as well as using our favorite sauce and some delicious home-made buns, these were unbelievably underwhelming.  I had plenty left over, but neither my husband nor I could convince ourselves to eat it.

These were pretty good for a vegetarian option. I found the zucchini made the rolls soggy. Next time, I would fill the rolls with baked zucchini chips, which are much more flavorful and crispy. I would also skip wrapping in foil and heating, as most of the mozza ended up stuck to the foil. I would simply broil under low heat for a few minutes to melt and crisp the cheese instead. Thanks for sharing an overall nutritious and tasty recipe!

WOW...these ARE FABULOUS! I had some mushrooms that needed used up, so I added those and some sliced onions and minced garlic. I opted not to wrap these in foil, but just to put them on a cookie sheet and bake until the cheese was melted and bubbly. I can't believe how amazing these were, seriously! I'm already planning on when to make them again, lol! Thanks so much, for sharing this GREAT recipe that is most definately going into the regular rotation! :)

this is a new staple in my house. i'm vegetarian and my boyfriend isn't but we both love this one equally. i usually make it on wheat sandwich rolls and toast them in the oven/toaster oven before filling them to prevent bread soggyness. sometimes i'll add vegetarian italian sausage or tvp crumbles. great recipe!

Sorry -- I just wasn't happy with the way these turned out. Yes, they are very easy to make... but so boring. It did inspire me to add a lot more stuff next time -- peppers, onions, mushrooms, meat substitute -- then maybe it'll be worth 5 stars. But as written, this is a very plain sandwich.

A great sub-stitute for a meatball sub! I added mushrooms to the pan with the zucchini, but that's all I changed. This is so good, it's hard to believe it's vegetarian!

Simple and healthy!  I only made 1 sandwhich for myself.  I used a whole wheat french bread, and substituted olive oil for the butter to avoid unhealthy fats.  I used home made tomato sauce.  I added onions and garlic to the zucchini in the pan, because I cannot live without these two ingredients.  To use less cheese, I grated great quality mozzarella (which really makes a difference) using the tinier holes of the grater.  It gives a nice taste of mozzarella over all the sandwhich, without overloading on fat.  This is not your average sandwhich!!!

Everyone loved this sandwich--even my 8 year old daughter. I put the sauted zucchini and spaghetti sauce on one side of the bun.  Then I sprinkled with co-jack and parmesan cheese because those were what I had on hand.  Then I broiled the sandwich open-faced until the bread and cheese were lightly toasted. Really good.  Will definitely make again.

Very good.  Everyone had seconds.  However, next time I will make my own tomato sauce - I think that would taste fresher.  Also wish I had been able to find 100% whole wheat sub buns.

This was really a great way to use up zucchini.  I had made the chicken and zucchini recipe from this site and had bought the largest zucchini at the local farmer's market.  With so much left over I thought I'd give this a try.  It was really good.  I did make a few changes, only because it is what I do to any maranara sauce that I use (especially if it is store bought)  I added half a chopped onion and a chopped red bell pepper w/ some garlic when sauteing the zucchini.  I also toasted the bread first w/ a little butter, garlic salt and parmesian cheese....overall, these were really good.  I think the key to this recipe is the sauce.  If you use a sauce you like, you will like this. To boost flavor, I can suggest using the Italian Seasoning II from this site...I use it in all of my pasta sauces.

These were quick to make, good use of vegetables. Wish they had more flavor, though. All in all, a decent recipe.

This was great!  The kids didn't even know it was zucchini.  Normally they'd pick out the zucchini but not with this recipe.

I have never given anything 5 stars so far, but this deserves it! Simple and FABulous! The only I added was chopped garlic and some fresh parsley! Looking for a vegetarian version of a meatball sub, you found it!

Wonderful! My children and a friends children all really enjoyed these sandwiches.  So did my husband and I and the in-laws. I followed the suggestion of toasting the rolls first and they didn't get soggy, even leftovers the next day weren't too soggy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

A nice healthy alternative that my family absolutely loved. Instead of wrapping the sandwiches, I placed them on a cookie sheet to let the cheese melt and the bread crisp up a bit. A big hit and thank you!

My family loved these!  Next time, I might saute some onion in with the zucchini for a little added zip.  I didn't care for them wrapped in foil and baked.  The cheese stuck to the foil, and the buns became soggy.  I would just bake without wrapping for a toasted bun and no problems with the sticky cheese.  Great recipe, very fast and easy to prepare.  Also a great way to sneak in an extra vegetable for the kids (they called them pizza sandwiches!).

Fabulous idea! Like other reviewers, I toasted my buns beforehand. Also added a little garlic powder to the zucchini mixture while cooking. Since my husband has to have meat at every meal, I used Spicy Italian Sausage in his mix. It was really good either way! One of my favorite new recipes!

Great! My assembly was a little different, although basic recipe the same.  I cooked small pieces of chicken with the zuchini, and used seasoned salt as seasoning. I just used plain bread, put a slice of mozerella and put it under the broiler until bubbly and lightly toasted. THen I added zucchini/chicken mix, spaghetti sauce, and one more slice mozerella.  Made a fabulous open faced sandwich, and it even looked great too!  Even my 2 yr old gobbled it up.

Delicious!  I used squash instead of zucchini, and put the mixture on rolls that I made with a recipe from this site (French Bread rolls to die for).  They were very good, but I halved the recipe (only had one squash) and I think I could've made 4 small sandwiches out of the mixture.  I couldn't finish one sandwich roll--only ate about 3/4 of it.  My bf had a few bites left over as well.  I don't think they would keep well, so I gave the rest to the dog, but otherwise I would've eaten the rest later.

Love it. When I announced to the family that I was making these they all snubbed the idea but let me tell you they loved it. I pre toasted the rolls because we like crisp bread and I also sauteed and onion along with the zucchini. So good. I can't wait to have it again.

My version: I sauted the zucchini and some onions, seasoned with cajun spices, and then used baby swiss; wrapped them in foil and put them in a 350 oven just long enough for the cheese to melt. It was a great alternative to philly cheese steaks. I agree with another reviewer to be sure to put some cheese under the filling too. My boyfriend made some chicken strips in another pan and added it to his. They are a great dinner with sweet poatoe fries.

Thanks for the awesome keeper recipe!! This was so easy to make and so delicious! I did add cut up mild Italian sausage because the rest of the family wanted the addition, but I think this would be fabulous without it. Otherwise we prepared this according to the recipe and it is definitely a keeper. We did use multi-grain rolls. Perfect like it is. Thanks again!

I liked these a lot.  The bread did get soggy.  Next time I might melt the cheese onto the bread under the broiler, then put the hot filling onto the buns just before serving.  Great way to use all that garden zucchini!

I used 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese per grinder, and this well-written, easy-to-make recipe received rave reviews from my family.

Excellent. My vegetarian hubby even likes these... very picky. I must say that the sauce will make or break this sandwich, so dont cheap out. Either make or buy a good sauce.

Fabulous, as titled.  I actually liked these even more than I thought I would.  My husband was also a fan.  I added garlic powder and some parmesan cheese.  Yum!  We really like zucchini, a necessity for this recipe as it doesn't taste like a meatball sub but rather like really delicious zucchini.  If you like zucchini, this recipe's a winner.  Thanks!

So good and so easy!  I used 5 small zucchini - sauteed in olive oil for about 10 minutes with some crushed red pepper flakes.  Stirred in about a cup of marinara saud then stuffed into soft sub rolls.  Topped with shredded mozzarella, wrapped in foil then baked for about 15 minutes at 375.  It was so yummy!  Husband loved them as well!

Very Tasty. I took the filling to work in a bowl and assembled this and nuked it with the roll at lunchtime. I think it needs some more seasonings however. I added onions and garlic and will definately try this with mushrooms next time. Would also be good with soy sausage or even chicken added.

Absolutely delicious!  My favorite way to cook zucchini - if I want a little more spice, I'll add a little crushed red pepper or a spicy pasta sauce.  Yum!

I made this for dinner last night.  It was pretty good.  I skipped heating them in the oven and did what one reviewer suggested and put the cheese on the bottom.  They were tasty, but be careful with the red pepper!!  It was almost too spicy.  I put it on some good bread and it satisfied. I added red peppers, onions, and soy sausage.  I also used olive oil instead of butter.   I had the left over vegetable mix for lunch and it was pretty good all by itself.

Fast, easy and delicous!!!  I made the recipe exactly as it was written and it was really tasty.  You could probably add just about anything to these.  Adding onions and red peppers would probably be good if you had the extra time.

I am so incredibly disappointed. I thought that I would get a ton of zucchini this year like I have been every other year, so I looked up many zucchini recipes to try. They have not been growing well this year, however. I had only 2 zucchini and decided to waste them on this. 
I had other recipes that I could have used, but went along with the good reviews on this one.  This had little to no flavor and took way too long for such a disappointment. I have to throw it all away because the rest of my family will not eat it either.

I was looking for recipes to use zucchini from our garden.  This was so great I make the components for my wife to take to work and put together in her microwave.  It is a light lunch full of flavor!

I'm kind of surprised by all the 5 star reviews on this recipe.  It seemed kind of bland to me, but the biggest issue I had was that it was really hard to eat.  I tried the tricks suggested by reviewers to keep the bread from getting soggy: I toasted the buns first and I put mozzarella under the zucchini.  But the bread still got completely soaked.  Maybe my zucchini had a very high water content (it was fresh from my garden).  My family members ate this and enjoyed it, I think, but I won't make this again in this form.  It was just impossible to eat like a sandwich.

My husband initally turned his nose up at a zuchinni only sanwiches so I browned some italian sausage and tossed both the sausage and prepared zuchinni in a jar of marinara before piling into rolls. Hubs then LOVED and asked that I add to regular rotation of fav dishes.
Looking forward to making sauce from scratch when my tomatoes from the garden finally redden.

The marinara was really good but baking the sandwiches for 15 minutes was too much. My fault for not checking but know 15 was too long for me.

Seriously and surprisingly good. Make sure not to overcook the squash. (Yellow Crooked-Neck would be good here too)

I skipped the red pepper flakes and added a dash of cayenne. I also used fresh roasted tomatoes rather than canned. I loved this as did my whole family...Including the kids!

This honestly wasn't very good. The zucchini was just too soggy for a sandwich filling. We did broil the sandwiches with cheese on top and it was very flavorful - just couldn't get past the texture. Won't be making this again.

After browning the zucchini and seasoning it, I added the marinara sauce to the pan and reduced the liquid content. I then topped it with the mozzarella and covered it until melted.  I then spooned the mixture into heated bread and served. The entire recipe was super quick and easy. I will definitely make this again.

This was crazy good! I made a homemade marinara with tomatoes from the garden w fresh basil and garlic. I also added mushrooms peppers and spinach. I used sliced mozzarella instead of shredded to keep bread crispy. Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper!!

I used jar sauce to save on time. This is a regular in our vegetarian home. Even my son likes it- it's fun getting it wrapped in tin foil on the plate. My husbands likes extra sauce on the side.

I'm giving this three stars for the original recipe because I had to REALLY doctor this up. Added Italian seasoning, as the flavor was too bland. My personal preference I also added red, green and yellow bell peppers, can of diced tomatoes with green chile's, half a can of tomato paste, one can of tomato sauce and topped it off with cheddar and mozzarella cheese. My picky eaters ate 80% of an all veggie dish!!!

My boyfriend really liked it but I was not impressed.  To me this just seemed like garlic cheese bread with some zucchini. Maybe add more hearty veggies to make it seem like a sandwich and not just an overload of bread with no substance.  Also, it was a huge mess, we both had to use a knife a fork.  I did as other reviews suggested and toasted the bread before assembly and put a layer of cheese down before the zucchini to prevent soggy bread and that seemed to do the trick.  Probably will not be making this again unless I change out the veggies and hollow out the bread.  This actually might be better as an open face sandwich and pile on the veggies!

I followed another reviewers advice and put a thin layer of cheese on the sandwich rolls before adding the zucchini and other ingredients and the bread still turned out soggy around the edges.  I added onion and bell pepper to the zucchini.  It was good, healthy and my kids ate it but we weren't crazy about it.

After reading other reviews, I made the following adjustments. I added an onion, mushrooms, and spinach. I tossed the veggies with olive oil, minced garlic, pinch of red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning. I roasted the mixture at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or until tender (eliminates the soggy rolls). I toasted the bread and removed a little bit from the top part of the bun. I then layered the ingredients, light cheese, zucchini mixture, sauce, and repeat. A quick meal for a weeknight.

Personally found the sauce too tomatoish (unless I made it wrong), had to add a lot more spices (Italian seasoning, garlic powder) to add more flavor to it.

This made a very satisfying vegetarian meal. I put some cheese on the bread first to keep it from becoming soggy and then melted the remainder on top of the zucchini. I used olive oil instead of butter to saute the zucchini. I will add some mushrooms next time for for something different, but the recipe is great the way it is written.

Excelent! I made a few modifications such as using fresh tomatoes instead of canned and I added onions, red and yellow bell peppers and mushrooms as I needed to use them up. I also added pork (again leftovers) and I mixed everything together in one pan at the end before I filled the rolls. Even my kids ate this! Mix would also be great over pasta! Thank you!

This recipe was unusual in a good way. However, I made a few alterations that made it memoriable. Sauce: use fire-roasted diced tomatoes, skip the sugar, use 1/4c red wine vinegar, and double the basil if using fresh. Reduce the sauce for ~15 min and skip the pureeing for a lovely texture component. Sandwich: toast the bread before filling so it doesn't get soggy and mix the cheese in with the zucchini for an even melting.

Delicious and super easy to make. Homemade marinara comes together in just minutes and tastes sooooo much better than store-bought, even when using dried basil. Love these subs and will be making them again soon.

Loved it - the sauce is amazing :) Instead of sugar I used 2 drops of stevia.  I also sauteed some onions and I used one zucchini and one egg plant in the mixture.  I also used spinach as the first layer on the bread to prevent the bread from going soggy. Lastly used cheddar cheese - that's all I had.  Great Recipe.

Really delicious and fast.  Yum!  I took others' advice and added shredded mozz before and after the filling but still had issues with the sandwich rolls.  Next time I will toast/broil the buns in advance, add filling/cheese, wrap and bake for 15 mins.
Added some sliced onion and chopped galic

These are just what the recipe says:  Fabulous! I cooked up the zucchini in olive oil and added onions and mushrooms.  I didn't have foil so I just put it under the broiler until the cheese got all hot and bubbly and I think that worked out fine.  I did follow another reviewer's suggest to toast the rolls before putting the zucchini in there and that did help keep the rolls from getting soggy ( soggy bread grosses me out haha).  Thanks for a great vegetarian sandwich!

Yum, yum.  Nice veggie meal.  I used pizza sauce instead of marinara sauce only because I had some to use up.  Other half liked then but said he would have prefered mushrooms instead of zucchini.

This recipe is truly what you decide to make of it.  I loved how quick it was to throw together, and my family really enjoyed it.  Like everyone else, I added to it to suit our tastes, and put it on toasted whole wheat rolls.  To save time (and money) I skipped wrapping them in foil and just ran them under the broiler for a few minutes.  This will be my new quick go-to meal!  Thanks!

not bad, i added a chopped onion and some minced garlic to the zucchini while it was frying. i wish i would have put more zucchini on the bread, but other than that very good. i made a marinara sauce from this site and used a cup and a half.

It was very good I love the little bit of spicyness. I didnt measure anything just threw a litte of this an a little of that and it turned out great. I also used provolone instead of mozzarella. I also only used one zucchini and had enough for 3 sandwiches.

Great Base for a Delicious Sandwhich. I had left over Zucchini and Mushrooms that I grilled the night before. I added some spicy marinara and thin sliced Mozzarella from the deli.I broiled to melt cheese and wow !!! Great way to use up left over veggies!!

Very good. Sauteed zucchini in olive oil w/garlic, onion and mushrooms then added tomato sauce.  Put chopped olives and cheese on the subs and threw it all in the oven.  Very tasty!!

Talk about surprising!!  This was fantastic!  I used homemade sauce and added the cheese and sauce to the zucchini before adding it to the bread.  My 5 yo is gobbling it up!  I think this would even be good cold, I'm going to try it out in his lunch box.

Wow! Just had this for lunch and it was amazing.  I did add two extra ingredients to the zucchini when I was browning them: 2.25oz can of sliced olives and two button mushrooms chopped up.  I also took other's advice to toast the bread before adding the zucchini mix and I put the zucchini between two layers of cheese.  This is better than the chicken parm sandwhiches I get at the sandwhich shops.

These really do live up to the great reviews! I did follow the tips of others...but they pretty much were the same as the main recipe.  I roasted 2 zucchinis (1 shredded, 1 cubed) at 400 degrees for 30 minutes in some olive oil, red pepper flakes, and minced garlic...then dumped the marinara on top and mixed it all together in the pan.  I put a handful of shredded mozzarella on the buns first, then put the zucchini mix on top.  I had no problem with soggy buns, but next time, I would like there to be more crunch, so I'll toast the buns first. I'll probably follow some other reviews as well by adding mushrooms, onions, and olives. Yum!

A lot depends on what bread you buy, so make sure you get good bread. To keep it from getting soggy, toast it first (I used a little butter and shook garlic powder on it for flavor). Zucchini really isn't enough, so I cooked it with onions and mushrooms in the pan. Add just enough cheese to cover the bread, any more is too much. And mozzarella isn't flavorful enough for me; next time I'll use sharp cheddar. But a good recipe and very filling!

I thought these were great.  Not a vegitarian but I had a zucchini from a neighbor to use and this looked good to try.  Very yummy!  I did dice the zucchini rather than cube it.  I didn't have red pepper flakes but used another spicy seasoning I had on hand.  I also added a good handful of cheese to the sauce mixture before I filled the hoagies, seemed to thicken it up nicely.

These turned out great for me.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using 1 zucchini and 1 yellow summer squash and adding an onion.  My kids asked for second helpings and were happy to eat the leftovers for lunch the following day.  I tried the recipe again last night without the addition of onion.  I used it over pasta instead of as a sandwich, and it was equally delicious.  I added extra red pepper flakes the second time, and my husband really liked it.  This is definitely one of the better ways to use up an abundance of zucchini!

This is a great way to use up all the summer zucchini! I made this quite a bit last summer but forgot to rate it until now! I make this in a toaster oven - I agree that you should toast the bread first so it doesn't get soggy.

These are truely great sandwiches. Some other reviewers mentioned putting half the cheese on the bread and I found that really helps the bread to not go soggy. It's also yummy with some onions, peppers or mushrooms thrown in with the zucchini but delightful on its own.

I first tried this recipe in the summer when I had oodles of zucchini to use up.  I was surprised at how much we liked it.  I have made a few more times and sometimes added some cooked leftover sausage or used a tomato meat sauce and different kinds of cheeses.  It's really good every which way.  Now I buy zucchini just to make these on the weekends.
Seriously good, even a meat-lovin' man will snap these up.

I wrapped my grinders in aluminum foil before baking, but the sandwich stuck to the foil!  Reviewers suggested placing a layer of cheese to guard against this, and although I followed their advice, my sandwiches still stuck.  However, I think I used too much sauce and the heaviness probably caused my aluminum foil problem.  Despite this mini-mishap, my fiancé and I thought these were great--we just had to eat them with a fork instead of with our hands!  I will definitely make these again, but use less sauce when baking.  I might have some extra sauce heating on the stove in case we want more, but don’t want to weight the sandwich down during baking.

These really tasted great, but I was expecting something a little more than what I got out of this recipe. I felt like it was missing something

Just a follow up--Boyfriend asks for this about every other week or so, yeah it's that good. -- This was just the best.  Made it exactly like the recipe called for.  normally I and/or boyfriend like a recipe but want to make little changes, but not to this.  This one will show up again and again in our house!  We had to used Kaiser Rolls because the store was out of French and Italian bread, but I think it was still great.

Nothing to great about this recipe. I broiled the grinders till brown and crunchy. I did also toast the bread before adding the zucchini and sauce. Dont think I would make again or say boy you have to try this!!

This is a wonderful and creative way to use that abundance of late summer zucchini.  I made my sandwich just as the recipe stated and loved it.  My husband cooked a sausage link then added the zucchini and cheese and absolutely loved it.

LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! I have made this twice now. Just a wonderful basic recipe. I used sliced portabella mushrooms and onions in mine to give it a meater flavor. For the die hard carnivore use a jar of meat spaghetti sauce. But no one missed not having the meat both time I made it. Thanks again for a great recipe

Delicious! I think the zucchini mixture would be delicious in a variety of pastas...maybe even on it's own a side dish to something like chicken. What a great alternative to your regular meat sandwich.

Awesome sandwiches! Took the advice of adding some onion, green pepper and cooked in olive oil for extra flavor.  I made a larger batch, and the mixture even tasted better the next day. My husband couldn't believe this was a meatless sandwich.

Fantastic! Here's how I made mine: I couldn't find the right bread so I bought small ciabatta rolls. I cooked the zucchini with red onion. I pre-toasted the rolls as suggested. First I put a little shredded cheddar cheese on the bottom of the roll, then topped with the zuchinni mixture and then topped with american cheese. Baked for 10 mins. My family loved them!!

Very easy and filling meal - and a great way to use the overabundance of zucchini everyone seems to have. I've also made these with a bit of spicy italian sausage or pepperoni to make them more appealing to my "meat and potatoes" friends.

This was pretty good if you like zucchini. I split and toasted the rolls before filling them and they were still pretty soggy - kind of a turn off - but the flavors were good. My husband commented that a little bit of chicken would have made it better.

These are very tasty! I made a few alterations by using homemade pizza sauce I had leftover and toasting the bun with mozz. and parm. before adding the zucchini.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I, like others, toasted the bread and put the cheese nearest the bread.  I also added some chili powder to the zucchini as it was cooking.  I had one on the night that I made them, and put the rest in the refrigerator.  Just had one that had sat for a day, and it was not soggy at all.  I was a little leery about a zucchini sandwich, but I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really yummy recipe.  My 2 and 4 year old daughters were loving it.  I used summer squash and added some onion and garlic as well as half butter/half olive oil to brown.  Added some parmesan to it just before adding the marinara.  Lightly toasted the rolls and put a layer of mozz on the bottom and the top.  Forgot to wrap in foil, just put in a pan and toasted, liked the toasted rolls.  I served it with some jazzed up vegetarian baked beans and corn on the cobb for a three sisters/pure protein vegetarian dinner that everyone loved.  Will definately be making again with all of the summer squash this season!

What a geat way to use my seemingly endless supply of zucchini from my garden! The only change I made was to use sliced mozzarella as others suggested. Made this with sweet potato fries from this site and dinner was  a hit.

Very easy and pretty tasty too. Next time I will use more garlicky sauce or add garlic to the zucchini as it cooks to up the flavour. Maybe use a cheese mix, as well with mozarella, parmesan and asiago. I definitely recommend toasting the rolls before filling to avoid soggy bread. Thanks for the great idea!

What a welcome addition to my zucchini recipe collection - these are awesome.  I altered the recipe slightly but only because I happened to have fresh bolognese sauce on hand that I used in place of the marinara.  I did sprinkle some parmesan before I added the mozzarella on top.  Just delicious.  Growing up in PA with authentic grinders, it is tough to replicate them but this one was just like I remembered and with a good dose of home grown produce to boot.  Thanks for the great recipe - I'll be making it all summer!

Awesome (and I was skeptical.)  I've had so much zucchini already this summer, and I was running out of ideas. I didn't tell my husband what these were, just plopped dinner in front of him and he ate his sub and said, "that was freakin' awesome." Easy recipe with great results.  Will be making again.

This was great!  I added onions while cooking the zucchini.  I also sprinkled on parmesean cheese after toasting the grinder.

Easy and fast to make - great lunch! Husband loved it too. I used what I had on hand, just regular white bread pre-toasted in the oven, I used a kind of squash/zucchini and fried with garlic and onions and when I ran out of marinara, put in a little tomato paste and italian seasonings and it was fine-- added black olives before the oven. Will definitely make again!

I was skeptical at first, but this was an awesome recipe!  Next time, I'll toast the rolls a little before filling, and use sliced mozzarella instead of shredded.

These were soooo good. I used francesco rinaldi sweet and tasty tomato sauce. I sauteed zuchinni w/ olive oil spray,clove of garlic and about 1/2 an onion. I think my zukes were a bit big or my rolls were too small as I had extra filling. I only used 1/4c mozz. in each roll. I also sprinkled about 2tbs parm into the zuch and sauce mixture. I'd make again for myself, these kids ate it but my son stated not to count his revies because he doesnt like zuchinni, but I didnt have to nag him to eat it.

AMAZING!!!  I left out the red pepper flakes because I'm a real wimp when it comes to spicy food.  Next time I make this, I will use larger sandwich rolls instead of hamburger buns, as this can be pretty messy.  This was an awesome sandwich!

Great recipe! I will make this repeatedly.  I used vegetables that come with my CSA organic produce delivery.  Some weeks I get eggplant, onions and other summer squashes which which I mix in with zucchini.  I also add kalamata olives and use feta cheese and sprinkle dried oregano on top before serving.  A hit with my husband and the leftovers make great sandwiches for several days!

I loved this recipe, but my husband thought it was a little bland, needs a little more salt.  I refuse to add extra salt, figuring that he can add his own salt.  I was looking to use some zucchini because we had them in the garden...  I did use 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash (that's what I had) and added some ground beef (my husband preferred it that way, and this was a good way to use less meat), but it would have been just as good without.  Put it on an Italian loaf, and follow the recipe...  delicious!

So easy, and surprisingly so delicious.  You can add almost any veggy pizza topings: mushrooms, onions, peppers, garlic, olives..and it just enhances the taste.  Thanks for the great zucchini recipe!

I had a box of pilsbury roll mix and used it to make buns with added flax meal for this.  I also added mushrooms, frozen tri-colored peppers and onion to this.  I will confess that I ate a plate of the filling before it ever touched a roll.  So good and so healthy.

This is a great idea. My family is left with tons of zucchini from our garden and this is an easy way to get rid of them. I added hamburger and used four cheese tomato sauce instead of marinera. Also, all I had was hamburger buns but I toasted them before hand like others suggested and they turned out great. Thanks!

Different. I like the idea of grilling the bun instead of putting in the oven to steam. Will probably try some portabello mushroom also with this.

not a whole lot of flavor to these grinders.  before I became a vegetarian, I used to love traditional meatball grinders, so I was glad to find a vegetarian equivalent, but this recipe really fell flat for me.  I felt that it was lacking in a lot of flavor and spices.  perhaps if onions and some extra garlic and pepper were added to the mixture, it would be better.  even adding crumbled Boca would be an improvement while keeping the dish vegetarian.  After coating mine with parmesan cheese, they tasted okay, but that defeats the healthy aspects of these grinders.

Easy and flavorful.  We sometimes add slices of onion to cook with the zucchini.  Something we return to again and again.

my husband and i absoloutly adore this recipe! We recently added mushrooms in with the zuc, and we can't get enough! Its like a yummy 8 dollar sub from a shop, its better than gooey pizza, we eat them once a week at least or for a midnight snack. I like the onions raw and on top. We'll throw chopped tomatoes on em too. Yummy!

I liked this a lot and so did my husband (who doesn't usually care for zucchini) and my 20 month old son who ate almost a whole sandwich by himself! I added mushrooms to the zucchini when I was sauteeing it, and put cheese on both the top and bottom of the sandwich to make it extra cheesy.

This was an okay sandwich.  My husband was very excited by the looks of it and ate it fairly quickly.  I will give it another shot, trying a more flavorful bread.

soooo good! I think you could add practically anything into the saute...I threw in extra garlic and red bell pepper and will use whatever's available next time. A great idea and a great recipe. Thanks Your Highness!
