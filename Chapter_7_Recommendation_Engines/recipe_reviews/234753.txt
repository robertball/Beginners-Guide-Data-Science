Great comfort food on a cold snowy day. Prep time is more than 15 minutes, but well worth it. Makes about 11 quarts (calculated from pot dimensions, not measured). Worked out to 20.3 calories per ounce (weight) exact or ~99 calories per cup. I made per recipe but with 1.5 tbs of olive oil and added 21 oz (wt) of fresh cubed potatoes with 15 minutes left in step 3 so they would soften. I used 93/7 ground beef, which weighed 28.4 oz when cooked and completely drained. I weighed everything to a tenth of an ounce including the final weight of the soup  and totaled calories for each ingredient (as I generally do). Total was 4363.4 calories and 214.5 oz (wt).  We had two meals for 3 people and froze 3 quarts for  later. Great recipe.

This a great soup. On a whim, I added two cans creamed corn because I wanted some extra sweetness and some "weight" since I didn't have any of the canned beans on hand. This made a great soup perfect for me.  Seasonings listed take it from your run of the mill dump and go vegetable beef soup, to a more restaurant quality version.

Love this soup! I’ll probably leave off some of the beans  next time so I’ll have room to add  potatoes. This makes a large quantity, so I had to split it between slow cooker and a pan on stove.

This is definitely a soup that I'll make over and over again. I didn't use all the vegetables that were listed in the recipe but the recipe also says you can use whichever vegetables you like so I used light red kidney beans, green beans, corn, celery, onions and canned potatoes at the end.  It doesn't take much time to put together and makes enough to freeze for other dinners; it freezes very well.

Awesome soup! The only thing I did differently was prep it He night before and put it in the slow cooker the next morning. Cooked all day for 8 hours. Served with buttered Kings Hawaiian rolls for a delicious meal.

Very, very good. Makes a lot but none went to waste. Used sweet corn, tomatoes, thyme and carrots from my garden. Omitted the Okra, everything else per recipe. Thyme was a bit overpowering the night made but blended very well after refrigeration.  Picky daughter requested this for lunch at work twice.

Yum Yum! I halved the recipe and it still made a 6 qt pot full! I did add 2 cups more water since the liquid part of the recipe was less than other soups I make. I thought holy moly on the number of ingredients, but of course you can add or omit and the base is perfect imo. I did omit the corn and added a few potatoes. I used regular tomato juice for my veggie liquid since that is what I had. The rest was as written. Perfect! It's a keeper!

Loved it! Did make some changes though because the soup was sooo thick, like a stew, I did not add Lima beans or okra.
This is a great recipe, makes lots and great for freezing for a lazy day

I made this over Mothers' Day weekend. I only made half the recipe (which made around 8 bowls) and simmered it for close to 2 hours. Other than skipping the cayenne pepper, I made this recipe as written. It was a little heavy with the thyme, but a good soup.

I added fresh mushrooms and did not use okra. I used leftover sugar snap peas I had in fridge instead of frozen peas. Very good soup.

This is a really delicious soup!
I was lazy and didn't want to chop a ton of vegetables so I peeled and diced 2 potatoes and used a 16oz bag of frozen Birdseye classic mixed veggies. 
For the beans,  I used a can of navy pea beans, and a can of black beans (my son has an intense hate for kidney beans)  because it's what I had on hand.
Everything else I kept the same. The ingredient list didn't call for Bay Leaf, but the picture shows a few added...so I added them!
Like other reviews stated this recipe makes a HUGE batch so either cut it in half if you don't want to feed a crowd or use a BIG stock pot! I'll definitely be making this again! Mmmm...

Absolutely love this soup - made it many times and I must admit it's always a little different depending on what left overs I have in the refrigerator.  Follow the basic recipe adding chicken broth but throw in whatever I'm feeling that day it's delicious every time and especially now that we're both down with bad colds !!

Love this soup, and so does my family. I added potatoes, and didn't add Lima beans as I didn't have any, and also ran out of beef bouillon so used chicken instead, and followed the recipe otherwise. Made a nice big pot, so after having it for dinner with garlic bread, we'll have enough for lunches for a couple of days!

It might have been the brand of canned tomatoes I used, but I found that the beef flavour was overshadowed by the strong taste of tomato.  It needed a few tablespoons of sugar to get the taste right.  I took it to a church fundraiser and every drop was consumed, so I think it was fine.  I might make it again for a large group gathering.  For the two of us, it makes a huge batch.

Could have used a warning that the recipe needed a 55 gallon drum to hold the contents. The reference to 16 servings is pretty vague. Halfway through preparations I had to transfer everything to a 4 gallon stock pot.

Wonderful - I have made this several times.  You can substitute different varieties of beans you put in.  Where I live, I can't always get some of the fancier kinds.  It is always great.  The extra goes in the freezer.

Had to change recipe a bit because of not having all the ingredients on hand.  Replace celery with green bell pepper, didn't use vegetable broth. Used Hunt's diced (basil, garlic & oregano). I seasoned the ground beef with creole seasoning, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt and a bit of lawry's seasoning salt. The last ingredients that it says to add I only used corn and green beans. Still came out super good. Maybe next time I'll use  all the ingredients, but I just may leave it this way.

This is a really great recipe. I usually only make half as the whole recipe makes a lot of soup. I do not use any of the canned beans (personal choice), or limas or okra. I do use frozen corn, peas and green beans and just add extra.

I first made this as a half recipe,  and I didn't have ground thyme. I substituted with marjoram.  When I made full recipe with thyme, did not like it near as much. I am a salt aholic so I thought it was better with original V8, not low sodium.

This tasted really good! I didn't have beef bouillon so I just used more beef broth cubes. I let the soup sit for just an hour and it was good.

Delicious soup! I followed the directions as written, however, I added two cans of diced potatoes, omitted the okra and completely forgot to add the peas and Lima beans.  It was excellent even with the omissions - very hearty!

Be sure to use a LARGE pot - this makes a huge amount of soup.  I had to split it in half and use two pots.

Will definitely make again...thank you for posting this recipe!
