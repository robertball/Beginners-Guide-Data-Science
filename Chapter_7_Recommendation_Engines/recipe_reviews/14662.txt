It took about 30 minutes of constant stirring and I ended up with only 1/2 cup of sauce once the liquid had reduced. But the taste was well worth the effort!

I used grilled ribeye (cut into bit size pieces) from the previous nights leftovers.  I didn't really like the sauce to start with so instead of trashing it I added 1 beef bouillion cube, about a Tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and let it cook down.  It still wasn't the consistancy I liked so I added a little bit of cornstarch just the thicken it a little.  The balsamic vinegar gave it a little swang and the beef bouillion is what did the trick for me.  I added the meat back to the sauce and it was great.  My husband even liked it and he is somewhat fussy when it comes to new recipes.  We will use this one again.

This takes a LONG time to get to the right consistency. I couldn't wait any longer and just used it when it was still thin. It tasted good.

I haven't followed this recipe exactly but it is what I do after just about any pan-cooked meat dish.. if it seems to take too long to cook down I might suggest a larger (wider) pan - less depth of the cooking liquid seems to help it cook away faster (although maybe it's my imagination.. maybe a physicist could tell us for sure). Also it's probably obvious but turning the heat up will help too.

This is pretty good although it does take a bit of time to reduce.... so in my opinion it's not so great that I feel I need to take the time again to make. But if you like sauces on your steak you would like this. I just don't care enough to bother with it again.

Made as directed and as others mentioned it takes a long time to reduce. By the time it reduces the garlic has a burnt taste making the overall sauce bitter tasting. I used a good red wine that I always cook with so that definitely was not the problem. Sorry but I will not be trying this one again.

Made it with sausage and onions; I threw a diced onion in a skillet with some olive oil put in some chicken sausages when the sausages were done I took those out (leaving the onions in the skillet) and followed the recipe after that... OMG it was incredible!! Rave reviews all around the table!
