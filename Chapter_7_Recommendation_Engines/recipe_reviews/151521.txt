This pie deserves more than five stars.  My boyfriend and I found the recipe on a coupon or something at the store last summer and immediately bought all the ingredients and made it that night.  It is the best!  We make it several times per year.  We always used to order peanut butter pie for dessert at restaurants, but don't do it anymore because this recipe is just so much better, not to mention cheaper.  I like to use Neufchatel cheese and drizzle the pie crust with the fudge first.  French Vanilla Cool Whip is a yummy substitution as well.  Edited 5/26/10 to add: we've made this many times over the past few years.  My fiance actually proposed to me while we ate this pie together!  I know it's just a fluffy recipe with convenience food ingredients, but it will always be special to us.

Very good dessert! For some reason, I expected it to be lighter, though. I didn't end up adding all the whip cream on top, because it seemed like too much, but next time I would definitely add it all. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this pie for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit with both my husband, who doesn't like pie, and my daughter, who said that this pie is one of two pies she likes, the other is apple.  It is very easy to make.  I did add peanut butter cups that I put in the fridge and broke up on top.  Will definately make it again.

I've never been a big peanut butter girl, but I chose this to make for an office Christmas party. I had to make a "test pie" before I would serve it to other people, and it was delicious! I made the second pie for the office, and when I brought it in the next day, I found it had actually gotten BETTER in the refridgerator overnight. I made it again for family Christmas dinner, and my whole family raved about what a great cook I am! This is a keeper! Every time I make it, I always feel the leftovers are the best! It's very rich, though, so only have a little piece!

I changed this up just a bit. My whipped topping container was kind of small, so I just used the whole shebang in with the peanut butter/cream cheese layer. I then spread the hot fudge topping over the top and sprinkled with chopped peanuts. I made my own chocolate wafer crust. Really awesome pie and super simple. HUGE hit, to say the least. It's super rich so cut small pieces. I was only able to eat two bites, it was really over the top. NOTE: I used reduced fat cream cheese and "free" topping and you totally can't tell. ;)

I HATED this recipe.. I found it and was very excite dto make- But it was more like PB cheesecake then a cream pie and much too heavy.. I followed the recipe to the letter but thought it was going to have more a PB mousse texture then it did..

Way too rich but otherwise restaurant quality (better than Baker's Square PB cup pie!). I used fat free cream cheese & whipped topping to cut back on unnecessary fat. I also used Smucker's special recipe dark chocolate topping instead of hot fudge because it has less fat. I had a 1/16th slice and had trouble finishing it, which is too rich for me. I adore peanut butter but I think that is part of the problem. Next time I would use less peanut butter and more whipped topping to lighten it. Perhaps also a bit more chocolate on top.

This was so decadent and delicious!  My dad thought it was too rich but he had a HUGE piece.  It's meant to be savored and enjoyed like a rich cheesecake.  So yummy!

This pie is amazing!!!  If you are a peanut butter lover this is for you!  I only had an 8oz. tub of whipped topping but it worked out fine.  I put half in the peanut butter/cream cheese mixture and then used the other half on the top and the mixture was still very mousse-like and there was plenty on top.  It is very rich and sweet but that's not a bad thing in my opinion!!  I also chopped up some Reese's peanut butter cups and sprinkled them on the top.

Very rich! Great for peanut butter chocolate lovers. I entered this into my faculty bake off. My only advice is to use a taller pie cover when storing it, especially if you put on lots of whipped topping. When I took off my regular plastic cover, some of the stripes stuck to it and came off. It looked pretty ugly after that...but, surprise! I still came away with third place- I guess the taste won out! The instructions say refrigerate until serving, but it also tastes good frozen!

Love this pie! Like a few of the other reviewers I found this recipe on a coupon and made it a few days later.  I substituted Cool Whip Free for original Cool Whip and used Original Recipe Smuckers Hot Fudge instead of Smuckers Hot Fudge Topping and used way less than even half the jar.  My boyfriends favorite duo is chocolate and peanut butter, so this was a major hit with him!  It is super rich, so you only need a sliver to satisfy your sweet tooth and it only gets better overnight in the fridge.  Next time I may use the 1/3rd less fat cream cheese and less peanut butter because it is so rich.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This is "IT"!!! This is as close as you can get to Baker's Square Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Pie (thet all went out of business by us!) I did modify the recipe slightly though. I did not save very much of the Hot Fudge Topping for the top of the pie, as I knew it would be farily thin after warming & would run right off the pie, so straight out of the jar (which was 15oz Hershey's brand) I smeared it into the bottom & up the sides 3/4's of it!  I only had 2 - 8oz tubs of coolwhip, so I dumped an entire one into the cream cheese mixture, then scooped in about 2/3's of the 2nd container (maybe a total of 13 - 15ozs) & whipped the mixture well, I poured the remaining 1/3 jar of Hot Fudge Sauce over the pie (but as I thought, it ran!). I did not use the rest of coolwhip on top nor the decorative peanut butter or hotfudge squeezed out of ziplocs, I simply used a can of Redi Whip & as I served each piece I would generously spray the top & then add the perfect touch: 1/2 of a full-size Reese's Peanut Butter Cup sticking straight up out of the redi whip! MY guests LOVED it & it was as good, if not better than Baker's Square's version!

This is a rich pie but it will go further b/c you don't need as much.  Also, this is a desert you can throw together really quickly if you need a last minute dish.  NO BAKE!  Pretty presentation without skill.

This was a huge hit in our house! I did use a heavy duty ziplock bag for the microwave chocolate and peanut butter that goes on top and just put them both in the microwave for 10 seconds before decorating the top (bag open, standing up) and it worked. Very quick and easy to make.

This is my most requested dessert to bring for Christmas Dinner and disappears very fast. Instead of the prepared "Chocolate" pie crust I use the prepared "Oreo" Pie Crust. I think it gives it a better flavor, and the color blends well with the Hot Fudge.

I first saw this recipe in an ad in a magazine around the holidays and thought I'd give it a try.  My family loves the whole peanut butter chocolate combination. Boy, was it a hit!  The look on my brothers face when he takes his first bite is priceless!  I am now required to make this every Christmas and Thanksgiving.  Give it a try.  It's easy to make.  I will try making my own cookie crust this year.  I'll let ya know how it goes.

Wow - this was fantastic!  I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter and reduced the sugar slightly. Used reduced fat cream cheese and whipped topping.

This pie is awesome!!!  Like others, I've made it before from the back of the jar.  However, this time made some modifications that made it even better:  I made an oreo crust, but instead of regular Oreos, used Peanut Butter Oreos.  Then, once I brought the crust out of the oven, I put about 2/3 of the jar of fudge on the crust and then popped it back in the oven for a few minutes.  This allowed me to spread the fudge without it being too thin.  Then, only had 8oz. pkg of Cool Whip, so threw the whole package in and topped the pie with some real whipped cream.  Oh, and also added chopped peanuts to the top..yummmmmm!

I just popped two of these pies in the freezer.  Per a reviewer's suggestion, I put most of the fudge on top of the crust. I wouldn't recommend trying to spread it. I've found it works best to put the topping in a plastic bag and pipe it on. Trying to spread fudge on graham crackers is almost impossible. Also, I mixed all the whipped topping in with the peanut butter and drizzled the remaining fudge topping directly on the peanut butter filling. I like the layered look, but whipped topping by itself leaves something to be desired. Next time instead of using regular sugar, I plan on using brown sugar. Brown sugar and peanut butter taste amazing together! This recipe reminds me of the peanut butter apple dip on this site. Both are delicious! I plan to try this with the crust from "Frozen Peanut Butter Cheesecake" on this site. UPDATE: I made a crust using homemade chocolate nut cookies and butter. Then I topped that with a thick layer of hot fudge. Next came the filling with all the whipped topping mixed in. Lastly I piped on hot fudge. Wow! Looks and tastes amazing!

I made this for the first time last year for a holiday and my family loved it.  It has become the family favorite at desert time.  In fact at all of our holiday or family get togethers they will ask me to bring this.  This pie is perfect, can't ask for anything more.

I followed the recipe exactly although I seemed to run out of whipped topping for the top layer of the pie so I used fresh whipped cream and it was delicious.

We love this pie!  Have been making it 4 or 5 times a year for the last couple of years and it's always a favorite with everyone asking for the recipe!  To make it a little less rich, I only use about 2/3 jar of the hot fudge topping, and I make my own graham cracker crust instead of using a chocolate crust.  It's wonderful with the graham cracker crust!!!

I am a huge fan of peanut butter, so I LOVED this. I have also made it another way -- using individual graham crusts, I put a layer of Peanut Butter & Co. Dark Chocolate Dream chocolate peanut butter on the bottom, then the peanut butter/cream cheese mixture as stated in this recipe, omitting the chocolate sauce. Even more peanut buttery if that's your thing!

I made this using Splenda instead of sugar and used sugar free Cool Whip topping. It was the first pie to go! No one knew I made all my desserts with Splenda. they were definitely a hit with friends and family.

this should get 10 stars!!  easy, quick & delicious.  Family loved it, you don't need to change a thing if you don't want to, of course everyone makes things to their own taste, as they should, but if you're a beginner, follow exactly as written and you will be very happy.  Fantastic recipe.  I will try an oreo pie crust next time but the regular chocolate crust was fine too.  Highly recommend this for yourself or definitely to take to a party or give someone as a gift or something.

This was okay.  Nothing special, though it was very rich.  We ended up throwing away about a third of the pie, which is unheard of at our house. Seemed like the chocolate sauce became runny after a few days in the fridge

this is the best pie i've ever had. wow i could eat the whole thing and it's easy to cut out a bunch of calories by using sugar free whipped topping and splenda, even the hot fudge comes sugar free and you can't tell the difference. my husband never even noticed. don't pass this one up.

This was an easy, delicious dessert.  I followed the recipe exactly, using a store-bought chocolate cookie crust.  My only complaint is that there was not enough room in the foil pan for all of the fudge topping, so some of it spilled over the sides.  Not a fault of the recipe, however.  Next time I'll make my own crust and use a springform pan.  Excellent.

Wonderful! Like others, I found this recipe last summer and tried it as soon as I had the ingedients. Deserves more than 5 stars.  My husband has always loved peanut butter pie, but this one is his favorite.  Found it to be very rich, so don't serve a large slice.  Mot

THE BEST EVER PIE!!!! It is delicious, and creamy and peanut buttery! I have made it three times in one week. Every time, its gone within 5 minutes. Once suggestion, if you want to stretch it out, there is enough filling to make two pies. You will need a little extra chocolate topping and whipped cream, but it works out just as well, especially when feeding a larger group.

This was so easy!Everybody loves this pie! I didn't have a chocolate crust just a regular graham crust so I poured heated hot fudge to coat the bottom and refrigerated it while I made the filling. WOW!! Son says its a very creamy Reese's cup.

i used 1.25 cups powdered sugar instead of 1/2 cup sugar since most of the other recipes on here (including higher rated ones) used more sugar.  i also used the type of chocolate syrup that you add to flavor milk since thats what i had on hand.  my husband (the peanut butter lover in the family) LOVE LOVE LOVED it.

This was simply wonderful!  I used Skippy PB instead of Jif cause we are a Skippy family here.  It is a very rich dessert though and you could get 16 small pieces out of it and that is a big enough piece with being so rich!  I'll being making it again for Easter!  Yummy!

I made this for the birthday party of a friend. He asked for something with peanut butter. I personally do not like peanut butter and had not idea what to make. This turned up and it sounded pretty good. 

I made it and it turned out well. The guy loved it and same with the people at the party. I personally think it would be much better without the peanut butter. I might try it with caramel or chocolate instead.

Today I won a first place cream pie ribbon and a best pie of show trophy,  making this pie. I made two pies, one with expensive cream cheese and one with a brand x cheese. To my surprise the better pie was the one with off brand cheese. It held up firmer as it fell to room temp.  Don't actually know why but I will use the off brand from now on with this recipe.

Wonderful recipe! If you really enjoy peanut butter, you'll love this.  Made it just as the recipe directs, but substituted powdered sugar due to the large size of the sugar grains here in Asia.  Look at some of the pictures posted by others to get ideas for decorating and adding additional toppings, if interested.  All the peanut butter lovers in my family agreed this is a keeper.

So rich and soooo good! WARNING start with a small slice it is so rich! I would make it the day before next time as I think it was way better the next day. I think I will make my own crust next time also,but I am not a huge fan of the premade kind!

this pie is delicious! I used powdered sugar instead and I think it made it more smooth and not grainy like regular sugar. I think it's best stored in the freezer. It doesn't freeze solid but makes it really cold which is how i like it with a cold glass of milk!!

everyone LOVES when i make this pie at work.  there are often fights over it --  i find that the recipe makes enough to fill 1 1/2 pie crusts so i usually end up making some more filling and just making 2 pies.  Works well with crunchy peanut butter too!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and the husband begged for it for Christmas!  I used a graham cracker crust instead of a chocolate pie crust (couldn't find in the store), and it was delicious.  I needed slightly more cool whip both times I made it; 1 container isn't quite enough.  Definitely a huge hit.  Will make again!!!

This recipe was the best part of Thanksgiving. I didn't change a thing but might only put most of the filling in next time as the fudge sauce leaked out when it sat. Also, the fudge and the peanut butter should be heated before piping on top. I don't recall the recipe saying this. It was so good and a small piece was all that you needed.

omg-we decided to have a totally non-trad Thanksgiving this year. WE have Blue cheese burgers and loaded potatoes-THE family favorite. But I wanted to at least make dessert. Some thing so wonderful both my kids would love it. This was definately the right call. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!!! Made exactly except I didn't finish it off with the extra toppings. I also made two pies (!!!) from the peanut fluff-must have over whipped!!!

This is a great yummy pie. It is very rich and creamy. You have to love peanut butter. It was a very easy recipe to follow.  I will make this again for sure!  My family just loved it and they can't wait for me to make it again either.

It was hard to blend the ingredients even though I used my strong hand held mixer. When heating up the decorative fudge use a water bath not microwave. My bag busted and fudge all over the microwave. The pie is very rich. I served it to 3 men and they barely were able to eat a normal size slice ( they needed a Glas of milk with it) I would not make this pie again.

I have made this for Thanksgiving for the last two years. I skip the chocolate, add coarsely chopped peanut butter cups on the bottom and top, and use fresh whipped cream. Delicious!

Delish the only thing different I did is add a handful of chocolate chips to the on mix for a crunch! And not spread the topping. Just thought it was prettier.

I made a sugar free version.  To make up for missing "real sugar, I made homemade whip cream, I found it made the dessert so rich folks didn't realize I had used splenda instead of sugar.  I also took the murrays sugar free chocolate cookies and made a crust from scratch, along with smuckers sugar free hot fudge.  Friends are always asking me to make it, I don't tell them it's sugar free until after they taste it.  Even though cool whip makes a sugar free whip topping take the extra steps of making it from scratch, this is the key, without it, you won't get the same reviews.

I have to make this every year for the holidays. It is easy enough to make anytime, and everyone loves it! Its a staple at our holiday desert table.
For beginners or the untalented, like me, make sure you cut the hole in the chocolate drizzle bag very, very small. Try heating the peanut butter drizzle to make it more manageable.

ONE!! This recipe is SOOOO delecious! Every bit as good as I thought it would be. So simple (and relatively cheap, I spent maybe $10 for 2 pies).

TWO!! I made 2 pies with this, using the Oreo cookie crust. I also used whipped cream for the top layer (don't do this! I didn't know, but after a while, the whipped cream sinks, and gets watery, but this pie is GREAT right out of the freezer, so no worries).

THREE!! I also used that magic shell ice cream topping under and over the whipped cream, topping the chocolate layer with crushed Reece's Peanut Butter cups.

FOUR!! So while what I made didn't entirely match up to the recipe, the BASE is sooooo good. And YES it is rich, but it's SUPPOSED to be that way, so don't rate it down because of this, PLEASE.

Loved this. So easy to make - the actual preparation took no time whatsoever, but I think it was key to refrigerate it for a while between the steps. My only mistake was letting it sit out for a bit before cutting into it - I thought since it had been in the fridge all day it would be OK, but it sort of fell apart when we cut into it! Luckily, it was so delicious no one cared that it didn't look perfect on their plates. I will definitely make this again - and I'll leave it in the fridge until the last possible moment!

I made this for a friend who was having a good luck at your new job party.  He bought a slice of peanut butter pie every week from the coffee shop where we work.  So I had to try this for him.  He raved about this pie and how it was better then the pie he buys at the shop.  This pie was super easy to make I did change one thing only because I did not have chocolate syrup on hand.  I took two packets of hot chocolate mix and mixed it in with the top layer of whip topping to give it a nice chocolatey flavor.  Then grated chocolate over the top.  AWESOME!!!!!

I loved getting the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup Pie from Baker's Square.  Sadly where I live now, there isn't one nearby.  This pie is even better than that one!  I have made it a few times and everyone has raved about it.  In fact I already have two requests to bring this pie to some BBQs this summer.  It is a very rich.  A little piece goes a long way.  The amount of filling you make seems too much for one pie so I usually stretch it out to two and add a dark chocolate ganache layer under the peanut butter layer.  I have also embellished it with mini peanut butter cups.  I am going to make pie bites for the BBQs this year using the recipe and some mini cupcake papers and tins.  They will be more labor intenvise I am sure but a lot easier to serve and eat.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Unbelievably yummy! I altered it by only using 6 oz of cream cheese and substituting a little extra peanut butter. It takes care of being "too rich" as I read in other reviews and makes it peanut butter-tastic!

Just excellent - my son's comment says it all "Mom, it is awsome!".  I too, used powdered sugar and an oreo cookie crust.  I made two, one as written and the 2nd with powdered sugar and oreo cookie crust which I froze.  It froze up nicely and was even better on the 2nd day.  A very nice recipe - thanks for sharing.

This pie is very, VERY rich, so only have a small piece and make sure you have a glass of milk handy! It tastes amazing, fills you up and I got some rave reviews from my friends who tried this out at a party! If you're looking for a truly decadent, restaurant quality dessert - this is the one!

This pie was fabulous!  It was loved by everyone in my family and they're already asking when I will make it again!  I did beat the peanut butter, cream cheese and sugar for a long time before adding the whipped topping, and the result was an incredibly light and fluffy pie, with a terrific peanut butter flavor.

Wow.  Just.  Wow.  I made this for Valentines Day Supper yesterday and between 2 of us, it was gone by this morning.  So good, I felt I couldn't return to work without it.  But, pie just doesn't go over well at work.  So while I did the pie without variation, work deserved some...alteration.  I did them as cupcakes, with the intention of eating them with a fork directly from the paper cups.  I skipped the chocolate crust and threw a Nilla wafer on the bottom for support.  Melted a Hershey bar for the chocolate layer.  I also had packaged chocolate mousse that I used in substitution of the whipped cream layer (only cause I was out of whipped cream.)  Skipped the decoration, it's wasted at work!  The pie is VERY rich (and fantastically so), the Nilla wafers seemed to help that a bit.  Fantastic either way...   Wow.  Can I give 8 stars?

This was delicious!  I made it for a Christmas dinner desert for a large family, and it was gone quickly.  One person remarked that it tasted just like a peanut butter meltaway.  It was also very easy to make.

Loved it.  I recommend heating up your peanut butter before trying to drizzle it.  I used a cake decorating bag and didn't heat my pb up and it busted the bag.  It still turned out tasting great, it just didn't look as pretty.  Great recipe, all of it was gone at Thanksgiving!!

This is a keeper, as much enjoyed by adults as children.  Easy to make, it combines two of my favorites: chocolate and peanut butter.  With the decorative topping it presents beautifully.  As an alternative to piping the fudge and peanut butter on top, heat each in the microwave until beginning to liquify, then with a spoon drizzle each on top of the pie.

This was absolutely the best dessert that I have ever made! Everyone was very full after dinner, but it was so good that we polished off a good portion of it anyway. Yes, it is rich, as some have said, but just serve it in smaller portions. I'm not much for sweets, but this was elegant and restaurant quality. I was afraid that I wouldn't have enough room in the pie shell for everything, but I carefully got it all in with no problems or spilling over. The only thing that I will change next time is to buy a larger container of the hot fudge to allow for better drizzling coverage. I will also heat both the hot fudge and peanut butter baggies so the drizzle will come out not so thick. This will simply improve the looks as the taste was incredible! We had this for Thanksgiving and everyone is requesting that I make it again for Christmas. This is a must-have recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it. Both easy and delicious is a winning recipe in my book.

This is exactly what I dreamed it would be! The best! I wanted a peanut butter pie like in restaurants, not pudding based, but cream cheese based. This is it! I didn't change anything except that I couldn't find the smuckers microwavable sauce, so I just used the stuff in the squeeze bottle (it says not to heat, so I didn't). I didn't measure it, just squeezed it on top until it was nicely covered. It set just enough in the fridge that I could put the cool whip on top without a mess. It also made it easier to put the drizzle on top.

Wow!  Awesome peanut butter flavor but a tad too sweet even for my daughter's "sweet teeth"  The cream cheese adds such richness.  This one is a keeper!

Loved the cake, made it for my boyfriend as a celebration for the end of summer classes. The peanut butter filling is wonderful and the cake is just rich enough for it not to be too heavy, but really really yummy! I piped the whipped topping instead of smearing it, dusted with cocoa powder and drizzled the melted fudge with a spoon instead of a bag. I also added some chopped up Reese’s and it was delicious! Exactly what I wanted in a chocolate/peanut butter pie!

I made this years ago and forgot how amazing this is!  Last weekend I made this for my fiance and his kids.  They are Canadian and never heard of a peanut butter pie.  They were absolutely blown away by it.  This is possibly one of the best pies I've ever made.

My whole family loves this recipe! It's the perfect peanut butter pie. I didn't have hot fudge so I used Nutella instead. Also just used a regular pie crust. Delicious! I spread some Nutella on the crust after it cooled than put on the peanut butter topping. Added some streaks of Nutella on the top too. So yummy

I have been making this pie for years. My family requests it on holidays as it's a very rich desert and I don't make it that often. When I take it anywhere everyone wants a copy of the recipe and it is always gone in no time.

Full disclosure, I can't review the recipe as written because I made a few small changes. I'm not wild about frozen whipped topping so I whipped my own heavy whipping cream instead. I also made a ganache by melting semi sweet chips with cream instead of using jarred hot fudge, and crushed a pack of Oreos with 1/3 cup butter for the crust. That said, this recipe comes together in no time and is just really fantastic. Sadly, there is never a piece left over for me to have with my coffee the next day...

So delicious!  My husband is obsessed with peanut butter and chocolate so I make this for him any time I have an excuse.  I am not a fan of chocolate peanut butter but I can't leave this pie alone.  It is so fluffy and light in texture but rich in flavor.  It is a huge hit and I get requests for it at every family gathering.

5 star for sure!  The only change I made was I used chocolate cookie crust and confectioners sugar.

Absolutely the best PB Pie I have ever had.  I didn't have hot fudge so I made a chocolate ganache.  Perfect!

My family loves this very rich, decadent dessert. My oldest child asks for it often. It's so rich that you can't eat an entire piece at once. It's also very easy to make!

This a super easy, great recipe! Really no complaints with it. It's incredibly easy to put together and is quick. The only thing I would suggest is heating the hot fudge a bit less so it's not as runny. I did the 1 minute as suggested and it was liquid, so it spread all over the pie and over the edges and made a mess. So heat it less and smooth over the topping so you don't have quite a mess on your hands.

This was SO easy to make and absolutely delicious. It's very rich, small pieces are a must, but it was a hit with the whole family and it's been requested that I make it at Thanksgiving. I'm going to try it with a regular crust, bananas on the bottom, and no chocolate for my dad - he loves the peanut butter and banana combo. Will definitely be making again!

Made this over the weekend with a few minor changes just because I didn't want to make another trip to the grocery store! The recipe calls for 2 Tbsp. of peanut butter to be added to the cream cheese and sugar for the filling but I used a whole cup. I beat the pb, cream cheese and sugar in my stand mixer until it was all incorporated and then added all of the cool whip and beat it on high until it was fluffy like mousse!! I also melted a whole bag of milk chocolate chips and spread a thin layer on the crust, added the filling and spread the remainder of the melted chocolate on top and stuck it in the fridge. THIS PIE IS AWESOME!!

I enjoyed making this! I didn't have an electric beater so I just used my whisk. Instead of putting chocolate topping and pb  in a bag and squeezing it, I just drizzled it with a spoon.

This was delicious!!! It was a huge hit at the dinner party I brought it to! I even used reduced fat peanut butter, whip cream and cream cheese and it was still very rich! Would definitely make again!

Best peanut butter fudge pie I have ever had! It was perfect! I've been making this twice a year for my family after finding it in a cookbook in 2010. It's perfect!!! No need to change the ingredients! It works just like it is written.

Love the pie but I obviously didn't know what I know now after making  it! I used reddi-whip but it wasn't frozen like cool whip and so top was runny.. I let the filling set for about 2 hours which I should have let it set overnight in the refrigerator before putting the whip topping on over the fudge layer.  I ended up scraping the melted layer of whip  topping into a separate dish. I added cool whip and then topped with the drizzle of hot fudge and peanut butter  also adding crushed peanuts, Reese peanut butter chips, and peanut butter cookies  next and finished with mini Reese peanut butter cups! I made one with oreo crust and one with graham cracker crust. I froze one and refrigerated one and both came out very decadent even though it was not as beautiful as the original picture.  Tasted fabulous!

Heavenly!  I didn't have fudge topping, and I had a plain graham cracker crust (not a chocolate one) but I decided to make this anyway.  I just poured  1/3 cup of melted  chocolate chips Into the pie crust first, let it cool and then made the rest of the recipe as written.  Everyone loved it! .

Oddly I found this same recipe in a Skippy ad.  Only difference is it uses 1/3 c sugar, not 1/2.  It is the best peanut butter pie I've tried yet, so go for the less amount of sugar.  I'm a Jif fan but have always been told Skippy makes better fudge.  I have to say, it also makes better pie.  I am now expected to make this pie for every picnic and party.  When all done I put peanut butter in a baggie and hot fudge in another baggie, melted 10 seconds in the microwave, then cut a tiny piece of the corner off and drizzled all over the pie.  Beautiful!  You could also chunk up Reece's cups for the top.

Best thing I can say is easy recipe, no baking required, good option for summer desert when you don't want to heat up kitchen. However, all six of us (2 adults, 4 teens) found this to be too sweet/heavy. Nobody took more than 3 bites. I will look for a recipe that does not use cream cheese. I also think this would be better with bits of real chocolate folded into the pie.

My mother loves peanut butter pie but hadn't had it in years. I made it for Mother's Day and she was very happy. I'm a 3rd grade teacher, and this recipe was so easy, I bought multiply of the ingredients and let my students make it in my classroom to go with an end of the year 4 course meal they prepared. They pronounced themselves 'chefs'.

Made this yesterday for my Husbands birthday !! Used 1/2 cup of confectionary sugar in place of granulated, blends easier and used a chocolate cookie crust already prepaired. Didn't use the fudge topping but crushed  some nutter butter cookies for a topping !! Very yummy and so........easy!! Will definitely make again and again !! You could easily substitute any crust or topping to punch it up !! Thanks for this easy recipe !!

This very well may be my favorite dessert I've ever made. I only did about a third of the amount of hot fudge and didn't do any of the drizzle on the top, but this peanut butter pie is epic! My husband thought it was too sweet...but for me it reminded me of cheesecake which is my usual favorite. I will definately make this again.

I've yet to cut it but can't wait.  I bought a smaller whipped topping in error but still made it work! Also I didn't do the fudge and peanut butter drizzle.  I chopped mini Reese cups and sprinkled them on top.

I've tried similar recipes that called for confectioner's sugar and didn't care for them.  I found them to taste too much like the confectioner's sugar than peanut butter.  This version is perfect and very peanut buttery.  It's very rich so a small slice is plenty.  I'll definitely keep this one in my recipe box and make it again.

A rich and sweet dessert!  The kids loved it!  They thought it was so pretty they assumed I picked it up at the store!

Took minimal time to prepare!

I don't usually comment on a dessert being too rich or too sweet. But my goodness, a little slice of this pie goes a long way.  I took this to a church meeting.  Everyone loved it but I don't think I will make it again any time soon.

Very dense and intensely peanut-buttery! It is definitely for die hard peanut butter fans, like me! I would recommend beating the cream cheese and peanut butter mixture for longer, to get some air in and to create a lighter texture. Pie was a bit denser than what I'd imagined. I used 1 cup icing sugar in place of the regular white sugar. I figured it would lend a smoother texture. Also used 1.5 cups of whipped cream (whip the cream, then measure 1.5 cups) instead of whipped topping, I prefer real whipped cream. I made my own chocolate syrup for the topping, that recipe is also from allrecipes :)

I made this. The first day it was made we tried a piece after chilling it in the fridge for a couple of hours. It was incredibly Rich. Instead of melting the chocolate fudge and putting that on top to harden, I drizzled Hersey chocolate syrup on the top. No don't do that. It makes the pie too rich. Next time I will sprinkle chocolate chips or a crushed chocolate bar. The chocolate mixed with the creamy peanut butter is fantastic.  I haven't read many of the reviews, but I'm curious about freezing a couple of them just to have on hand for special occasions.

Incredible dessert! I made this recipe for a coworker's birthday.  Everyone who tried it absolutely loved it. I whipped the filling for another three minutes after it looked good before adding the cool whip, and it definitely helped with making the pie light. I also added some crushed Reece's peanut butter cups to give it a little unexpected crunch. This pie was quick, easy, and looks professionally done. It will definitely be a staple in the future!

First time making it, and for some reason the fudge was too runny. Next time I will not heat the fudge before putting it on. Everyone loved it though, very tasty!!

Very good. I ended up using just a regular graham cracker crust and bought the small whipped cream container, forcing me to use it all in the filling, so i didn't have the "topping". I put a layer of hot fudge on the bottom of the pie and then drizzled it over the top. Very rich. took a smaller piece than a normal pie piece...by the time i got to the last two bites, it was enough and into the "just too much" territory. Very tasty though.

Wow!!! This pie is amazing!!! I made it exactly according to the instructions. No changes needed. I do suggest that you only make this if you really are a peanut butter lover as it is very rich and flavorful!! Thanks for such an AWSOME pie recipe.

Used this recipe for fully dipped hearts for Valentine's Day.  I let the forms sit overnight but seemed to assist with holding form for full dip in warm chocolate. Looked great!

My boys love this pie with one minor alteration. For those who feel that it is too sweet & rich, try using a pretzel crust rather than the graham cracker crust. The salt compliments the sweet much better.  Does not taste salty, but gives just the right flavor.

Easy to make and a crowd favorite. I do a thick ganache topping on it though. It is so rich- people typically just do a small slice so pie feeds far more than 6.

I have been making this recipe for over two years now and it's my most requested pie at the holidays!  I've had friends who've ordered a much-raved-about peanut butter pie from a local restaurant and it costs over $40!  One taste of its heavy consistency and  my friends always return to my version....it's the best!   This recipe, like another reviewer stated earlier, deserves more stars than 5...in my book, it's a 10!

This was really good!  I made it exactly as is with the exception that I used homemade hot fudge.  The premade Oreo crust was fine, but next time I think I will use a homemade crust too so that I will have a larger pan which can better hold all of the ingredients.  It was hard to fit all of the ingredients in the pie and I was not able to put all of the fudge on the pie because it started to run over.  After it hardened, I was able to add the whipped cream no problem.  This was good and SWEET.  My small family of four certainly got our sweet tooth satisfied and had to freeze leftovers.

Very good but I found it didn't have enough of a peanut butter taste so I doubled the peanut butter. I also wanted a lighter texture so added more nutriwhip, I like this better than cool whip, I used about 5 cups of whipped nutriwhip. In the end it had a mousse like texture and the perfect peanut butter taste!

I made this recipe as-written and it came out fantastic!  The criss-cross grid on top made the pie look professional, and my guests were shocked to find out it was not store-bought.  The pie was a much better consistency the day-after making it, so I would recommend making it at least a day before you plan to serve it, so that it can set in the fridge overnight.  It is super-rich, so it will likely be a once-a-year type of pie, but totally worth keeping in the recipe box!

This recipe is everything I look for in a no-bake pie---quick, simple, cheap, and delicious! I'm definitely making this recipe again very soon.

Due to my budget, I used a home-made graham cracker crust in place of the pre-made chocolate crust and shaved some milk chocolate on top instead of using the hot fudge topping. I also used a bargain-brand peanut butter. I'm not sure how much all of that altered the flavor of the pie as a whole, but no one in my household had any complaints about it being too rich or heavy.

Only change I made to this recipe was to make a homemade chocolate/fudge sauce instead of buy a jar of similar stuff. Same PB recipe (even though I was making for my fiance's birthday, and he does NOT like overly sweet desserts; the sugar quantity turned out just right) with only neufchatel instead of full fat cream cheese, and lite cool whip instead of regular as my changes. It was so good, really intense but what is the point of making peanut butter pie if you don't eat it and say "Oh my god"? I will definitely make this again, but probably not until I am either bringing it to a party, or for his birthday against next year. (Speaking of parties, I might try and make this as a bar cookie for a party, with a homemade chocolate cookie crust in that case, and more filling to upscale to a 9x13 pan. Maybe!)

Wow!  This pie is oh so good, but oh so rich!  My hubby, who has a big sweet tooth, could only manage a couple bites!
