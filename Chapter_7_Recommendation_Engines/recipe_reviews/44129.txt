Wonderful topping over anything.  Last night, I prepared a box (white)cake mix, poured the prepared gooey syrup in the middle and baked according to the box directions.  I did have to bake a few minutes longer, but it turned out like an apple cinnamon coffee cake.  Very Yummy!  I've also poured it over cheesecake. What an easy way to spruce up box mixes if you're in a hurry.  I used granny smith apples and walnuts, as that was what I had on hand.  Thanks.

Oh, so yummy!  I served this over french toast for breakfast this morning.  I used chopped walnuts in place of pecans and only used one apple.  For some reason the apples I bought a few days ago smell like onions, and I didn't want to ruin this so I cut it down to one.  I only had to simmer this about 4 minutes and it was done.  Also, I didn't toast my walnuts, just pulled them out of the freezer and dumped a handfull in the skillet. I also added about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream to thin it out a bit since it was pretty thick. This is very similar to a crepe filling I've used from this site.  Would also go great over vanilla ice cream or cinnamon rolls.  Thanks Ian.

I cut this recipe by half. I actually used Granny Smith apples (for a little tartness) and I added a half teaspoon of nutmeg. I served this over Extra Yummy Fluffy Pancakes, which are also on this site. The kids and I thought it was great, though I thought it was quite a bit sweet. I don't know what purpose the corn syrup adds to this recipe, other than a thickening agent. Next time, I might cut it out entirely and see if I don't get the same result, then update my review.

Yum!  We had this on the Whole Wheat Pancakes from this site, but it would be perfect on ice cream and many other things, too.  Excellent recipe!

I LOVED this! I left out the pecans but it still tasted delicious. I put it on top of "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes". Yum.

This was great!  Very easy to reheat.  I used it on French Toast and then later topped it some vanilla bean ice cream with it.  I reheated the topping on the stove.  Oh, it was so wonderful!

This was easy and excellent.  I had walnuts instead of pecans, and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar since it was all I had.

This is a very good syrup, but with two suggestions: reduce the cinnamon by one teaspoon, and increase the corn syrup by one tablespoon. With 3 teaspoons of cinnamon I found it to be overpowering, and the addition of one tablespoon of corn syrup thickened it a little bit - it was too thin, and didn't have that "gooey" texture. Otherwise, very good.

We had this over pancakes and my family could not get enough.  I can't wait to have the leftovers on some vanilla ice cream.  Next time I will cut back slightly on the cinnamon.

Used it in crepes, it was delicious!  Would be great with vanilla ice cream. I'm going to try it in a cake mix next. I'm not sure if I'll tweak it or not, it's good enough the way it is.

Pretty good. The texture is a little weird...kind of slimy rather than syrupy (I guess that's why it's called "gooey" syrup...I'm wondering if this is from the pectin in the apples?) I found the flavor a bit too sweet and slightly flat so I ended up adding a pinch of salt, a splash of vanilla, about an 1/8th tsp of nutmeg and lemon juice until it had enough acidity for my liking. The kids loved it and Hubby thought it was okay (but he doesn't like a lot of cinnamon while the rest of us do, and this definitely has a bold cinnamon taste to it). Over all, quite good, will be making it again. Plated on pancakes with a little dollop of real whipped cream on top and it was pretty enough for pictures.

Top drawer!  Threw everything into the slow cooker and omitted the nuts.  Used frozen apples from our trees and they cooked down beautifully.  Took this to a party where it was served warm with crepes.  People were begging for the recipe and talked about the delicious aroma and taste.  Perfection.

This syrup is super sweet and soo gooey, but it tastes good on most anything you're willing to put it on. We put it on ice cream the most, and the rest that we didn't use could be reheated and poured over top whatever else we had.

Really enjoyed this syrup recipe...only had 2 large red delicious apples, but didn't notice that we were missing anything in the recipe.  Really good.  Could see how this would be delicious over ice cream or in crepes too.  Keeper..for something different once in a while.

Yummm!!! At first it seemed to sugary when I tasted it alone but of course on top of pancakes it was subdued. It was so good incorporating a bunch of stuff I love; apples, cinnamon, pecans... :) Very Good!! And Easy!!
