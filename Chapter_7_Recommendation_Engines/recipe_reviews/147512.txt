Absolutely simple to make and tasty!  I do think that the amount of strawberries need to be reduced, or a larger can of red bull should be used, but I wouldn't dilute it with water as suggested. This recipe could be a great starter base.  Thanks for the share.

Refreshing as is or great base for a stronger drink. I used a small can of Sugar Free Red Bull and added 2 packs of Splenda and about 5 large frozen Strawberries. If I wanted alcohol some rum or vodka would be nice in this. If you want to add more liquid try a non-alcoholic strawberry daquiri mix.  Also the taste will greatly vary depending on which energy drink you use, but if you use your favorite you shouldn't be dissappointed.  I will make this before many big party nights!

This also can be made with 1 [8.3 oz] can of XS Energy Drink. No sugar or carbs in this one and it taste great. Better than Red Bull!!!!

Great idea!  I'm drinking this as a pre-drink.  Great for a long party night.   I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen.  I think this one would work with almost any fruit.  I may try this one with added vodka sometime too.

I love to make these in the mornings!  I use sugar free Rockstar instead of Red Bull and I add a bit of non fat strawberry yogurt to make it less tart.  Yummy!

This is so tasty and really easy. For brunch, I add vodka and serve in place of bloody marys. My guests love them.

Wonderful! Although, when the blending was difficult and I added some water, it didn't really taste that good in the end. Besides that, it was great! Definitely will be making it again!

I really liked this, although I did reduce the amount of strawberries a bit.  Very good!
