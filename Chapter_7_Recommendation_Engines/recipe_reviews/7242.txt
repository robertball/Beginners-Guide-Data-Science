This was delicious.  I must admit that I had problems as I started to prepare this recipe.  When I got the the portion for the flour, I couldn't believe that it took only 3/4 cup.  I looked at other banana bread recipes and decided that it must take 1-3/4 Cup of flour, so I did this.  I also changed the salt amount from 1 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon, otherwise it would be too salt.  It turned out delicious!!!!

It was a little bit dry and I would add a little more sugar, but my kids loved it "as is".

I love this recipe but I made a few changes.  I added an extra tsp. of baking powder, used apple juice instead of rum, only had 1/3 cup brown sugar so used white for remainder, used only 3/4 c. unbleached flour, 1/2 c. whole wheat pastry flour, and 1/2 C. oat flour, and 1/2 C. egg substitute.  This bread was moist, sweet, and sent me to banana heaven!

This recipe is sort of a cross between fruit cake and banana bread.  The rum-soaked raisins and cardamom are the bridging ingredients.  They really give otherwise boring banana bread an extra kick.  But the taste and texture are much less intense than the classic fruitcake.    The first batch I rum-soaked just the raisins.  The second batch (I made a double batch the second time) I soaked the raisins and walnuts.  What a super taste!  The third time I used cherry-flavored Craisins instead of raisins.  The sky is the limit on flavor variations.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention that this recipe can fill 4, small, aluminum loaf tins.  They bake in 30 minutes at 350.  For the double batch I had to go 40 minutes.  These tins fit perfectly in Christmas decorated treat bags - for teachers' gifts.

used chopped dried pineapple instead of raisins, ended up adding some extra rum because the batter seemed too dry, used 1/2 c brown sugar, used 1 egg and 2 egg whites, added about 1/2 c pineapple juice to replace some of the sugar and to make up for the dryness, used all whole wheat flour, added a tiny pinch of cinnamon, and used 1/4 c sunflower seeds instead of the...

Wonderful. This is not your average banana bread. It is so much better. Did not have the overpowering banana flavor - which I liked. Not too sweet, which I also liked. Loved the texture, unlike other banana breads. Think it would make a lovely edible gift.

I, too, found this bread lacking in the sweetness department. Next time I make it, I'll add more sugar or another banana. The texture was great, and the juicy rum raisins saved the day. I can't imagine how dry this would have been without them!

More like a spice cake, than a banana bread. Great for those who aren't fan's of banana bread, but need to use up over-ripe banana's. But I strongly suggest that you don't substitute the cardamom. I can't imagine not having it in there. Thanks for the great recipe! A definate keeper!

Very delicious. I made the recipe exactly as-is; doubled it and put raisins in one loaf and left the other loaf plain, no nuts in either. Both were moist and yummy. I don't know how you could think this was dry? Maybe other reviewers used really small bananas? I thought it was as sweet as banana bread normally is; so I didn't think anything about that until I came back to read other reviewers' comments. Overall, something nice for a different twist on plain old banana bread! Something I did notice....the crust seemed nice and soft which I really liked; sometimes I do not like the crust of banana bread or other sweet quick-breads.

I loved the combination of cardamom, banana, and walnuts. I didn't have any raisins on hand, so i skipped that step.  The only thing I would change when I make this again is I would add another banana and perhaps a bit more sugar.  I prefer something a bit sweeter, but this was still very tasty!

This was good, unfortunately I didn't have dark rum so I used light rum.  The banana rum-raisin bread was good, but it didn't seem to have a whole lot of cardamom taste but I could smell it.  Smells wonderful, I might add just a bit more cardamom next time or maybe omit the rum and raisins.  I think I would call this recipe rum-raisin banana bread.

This recipe is great to start with! This was the first time I make banana bread and it is DELICIOUS. I made a few changes: I did not use raisins or rum, I used 1/4 c. canola oil (instead of 1/3), and I used cinnamon instead of cardamom. It turned out great like that and baked for exactly 50 minutes. I recommend these changes it tasted great...

Wonderful and flexible recipe.  I've used different kinds of fruit, dried and fresh, different kinds of nuts, chocolate chips, and always use fruit juice for the liquid.  I adjust sugar depending on the fruit used, but always use less than the recipe calls for, and it is delicious. 
One day I forgot the sugar, and had great muffins with this recipe!  
You taste more with less sugar!

I made this recipe because cardamom is my favorite spice.  The result was OK but a little weird tasting.  My banana bread has a bitter aftertaste, I think because of so much cardamom.  As much as I love cardamom, I just don't think it works in this recipe with these flavor combinations.  I would make this again but with cinnamon and nutmeg instead.

I found the rum to be kind of strong, and kind of icky...I couldn't even really taste the cardamom.  I had a lick of the batter and it was nice and sweet, but the actual bread isn't that sweet.  Not sure I'll make again.

I am not a huge banana bread fan, but this bread is delicious.  I toasted the walnuts in the toaster oven & used golden raisins.  You don't really taste the banana, but the cardamom is mild & the raisins add a nice sweetness.  The walnuts add a nutty depth of flavor & crunch.  The bread is moist.  I made 3 mini loaves & plan to make this again at Christmas to give away.  Looks like it will freeze well.  This is my new favorite quick bread recipe.  I think it will make good muffins, too.

I made this for the first time for a party, after reading all  of the reviews and altering accordingly.  I made one to the recipe given with only slight changes- no walnuts because I do not like them, a little extra rum, and an extra banana. Due to the notes of it being dry, I did not mash the bananas as well as i normally would, but left them in bigger pieces. In the second loaf I did, I kept the extra banana but did all the changes listed in the review to change it to pineapple.  That version was the clear favorite of the night. I also noticed in reviews people saying the cardamom was too much or too little, but I put that to the freshness of ingredients. I ground my cardamom  myself for this recipe, and I would cut it down in the future because it was slightly too potent.

This sounds like a great old Moosewood cookbook recipe I've made for years. This time  made it with following changes: sub' d honey - molasses - water for rum, sub'd  olive oil for canola, added ground hempseed  hulls to white flour to equate for whole wheat flour (was out of Bob's Redmill WW pastry flour which  works amazingly), threw in 1/8c flax seed meal, and sprinkled tops with chopped walnuts for good measure. Delicious, healthy, and easy to make. Kids and picky eaters loved it.  Highly recommend! (For an extra decadent treat whip some low-fat cream cheese and add a schmear.)

My only variation from the recipe was to soak both the raisins and walnuts in Capt. Morgans Spiced Rum. My wife really liked it and I thought it was good, but not great.

I love this bread. I used all whole wheat flour instead of a mix, added 1/3 cup of candied orange peal, and substituted toasted cocoa nibs for the walnuts. Yum!
