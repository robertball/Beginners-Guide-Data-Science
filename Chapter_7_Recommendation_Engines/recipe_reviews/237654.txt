This did not work at all. Followed the directions exactly and it was a weird gelatinous texture. Do not recommend.

Made this a little different and texture was amazing! Added 1/4 cup Crema used 3 apples and cup of applesauce. Opted for Agave instead for brown sugar. And and sprinkle or more of ginger. Yummy. Next time going to chop apples in larger pieces.

I followed the recipe as is, and when the cake is complete, I think it weighs around 6 pounds.  The taste is like apple pie, but the density of the cake, makes the texture more like a fruit cake.  I did not care for the texture.  Tried to heat and add ice cream, or sugar-free cool whip - still a no go for the family.
