Delicious!!  Roasted the beets first in some olive oil, let them cool, then chopped them fine with a food chopper.  My kids thought they were berry muffins until they finished and I told them they were beets!  Very good muffins - thanks!

This wasn't our favorite muffin recipe. It would be better had I cut the beets up smaller - or grated them.

I have never been a beet eater mainly because my mom never made them. I tried this recipe and the banana works with everything to pull it together! I agree that there probably will not be any for the freezer. Thanks for the great recipe!

We really liked these. I didn’t have muffin papers so I greased the muffin pan. I checked them at 30 minutes and they were done. A little more done than I would of liked. Next time I make them I’ll check doneness at 20 min. I added a few nuts and didn’t have lime zest. A keeper and cool way to use my garden beets.

I loved these!  I used canned beets, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  I love the banana and lemon zest flavors with the beets.  I will be making these again for sure.

I belong to a CSA, and received beets (beets and more beets). I have found, I don't like beets. I roast them and can eat 2-3 then yuck. I made these muffins, and I love them! I can't taste "beets". My daughter who is 3 (and won't eat anything that doesn't look like a snack) ate them. I didn't change a thing, probably won't next time (although I didn't measure the lemon zest), and will definitely make again.

I think most people would think twice upon trying one of these, but like a sprinkle of sugar, the beets round out their sweetness and moistness. I got compliments from my parents and was really pleased

Very good, didn't really taste the beets, they were basically a delicious chocolate chip muffin.  I pureed the beets with the banana.  Used a bit of lemon juice instead of zest.  I cooked for 25 mins (toothpick inserted was clean).

These are good. They did make 12. My only change was I cut the beats up small, but they weren’t small enough and I thought they would be wet clumps in the muffin. When I mash the banana I threw in the beets and mash them too. I added the mashed banana and beet combination to the wet ingredients before I added the dry. A little lacking in flavour and I don’t believe my method change had any effect on that, so only 4 out 5 stars.
