This is a delicious recipe. I played with it a bit, because when I hear mace, I think of the stuff you spray in someone's eyes to avoid being mugged. (Hey, I live in New York City.) I used half nutmeg and half cinnamon instead. I also used green apples and grated them first, people liked that better. And the green apples make it a bit tart, while sweet at the same time. Yum.

I searched for a recipe to match what my grandmother "used to make" when my dad was a kid, and I think this is it!  I highly recommend using mace for this - it's much spicier than a cinnamon/nutmeg combination and really creates the flavor.  I parboiled the apple slices in about an inch of water to soften them up a bit since the potatoes were already cooked.  My last try resulted in soft potatoes and solid apples, so that did the trick!  Thanks, Linda!

Yum! I served this for Christmas dinner with baked ham, cornbread dressing, Sesame Green Beans and salad. It was wonderful! I took advice from other's who reviewed this recipe and used 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon in place of the mace and shredded the apples (Granny Smiths). I also covered with foil during the first 45 minutes of baking, then uncovered for 15 min. to brown slightly.

Very good!! Followed a couple of recommendations from other reviewers (nutmeg and cinnamon instead of mace, and green apples - chopped). Also used an 'apple-crisp' like topping (1/2 cup each: brown sugar, flour, butter, pecans - for 9x13) which really put it over the top!! Several non-sweet potatoes eaters raved and asked for the recipe at my office luncheon.

This is a very interesting dish.  Could either be a side or a desert. I parboiled my apples like another reviewer did.  This was very, very good.
Three of us for dinner almost devovered it all.

I make this dish every year around the holidays and it is a big hit!  Even my family members who really don't like sweet potatoes love it!  I don't make it with mace either.  I use cinnamon and nutmeg with Granny Smith Apples.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was excellent! I made it just the way the recipe calls with the exception of using pumpkin pie spice in place of mace as I didnt' have any. Even my twin 3 year old boys loved it.

This was very good. The apples are a nice change. I used cinnamon instead of mace. For the final portion of the brown sugar mixture, I added a TBSP of flour for the top.
Nuts would have been very good but I didn't have any. Will use this recipe again. Thank you.

Since I was a little girl I love my sweet potatoes served with lot of brown sugar and butter with marshmallow on top. I tried this recipe for myself and like it so much I made it the  first time hosted a Thanksgiving dinner; I’m not going back to marshmallow the apples are where it’s at. Speaking of apples I like to mix Granny Smith and Fuji apple. (I think with a few tweaks this will make a good pie)

This was SO yummy.  It's a great way to serve yams in a different way.  I only used 2 TBSP of brown sugar and used cinnamon b/c I don't like mace.  The apples I used (GALA) are already sweet so you don't need to add more sweetness.  It was so easy to make. There was nothing left after the potluck. I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving.

Oh my gosh - these were SO good. The apples are the PERFECT addition to a standard sweet potato dish, and the mace kicks it up as well. Served at Christmas and got rave reviews.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either, and considering the hassle factor I was disappointed. If you do make this, I'd recommend boiling the apples a tad (I put them in the microwave for three minutes) and substituting the mace with cinnamon and nutmeg.

I used more apples than called for (ginger-gold worked well for me), and I added some shortening, flour and cinnamon to the brown sugar when it came to the topping.  I laid it on pretty thick on top and even threw in a few chopped pecans for good measure.  Mmmm.

Maybe I'm just not a fan of sweet potatoes, but I'll never make this dish again. Maybe it's my fault because the ingridents listed are very basic which is how I would describe this recipie, just yams & apples, nothing special in my opinion.  Now I know, moving on!

My family loved this dish.  I didn't pre-cook the apples, just peeled and cut them up and added them to the parboiled sweet potato.  Melt the butter, add the spices and toss the whole thing together. Bake until the apples are soft.  When this is warm, it tastes great on top of vanilla ice cream!

I tried this last week as a side for leftover ham and it was great.The sweet potato wasn't getting done in time so I put them in the microwave a few minutes to hurry them along but that didn't harm them in any way. My husband even liked it so it is a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving, most everyone loved it!! (There were a few die hards that wondered where the marshmallows were)  I think it needed a little more butter, something to bring out the flavor of the sweet potato more.  Otherwise very tasty!

I was dissapointed with this dish given all the great reviews. It was a bit soupy and did not get thick as I thought it would. I may try this again but make a few changes.  Thanks for the recipe Linda!

Wonderful compliment to our smoked pork loin.  This dish cooked-up exactly as I'd anticipated.  Cooked potatoes a day prior.  Sliced red apples w/the 'thin' insert of a handslicer, and they cooked-up nicely; not mushy nor undercooked.

This did not turn out well AT ALL!  I don't know if I didn't overlap the potatoes enough or what, but all of the butter and brown sugar was at the bottom of the baking dish when this was done cooking.  That made the potatoes on the bottom soggy and mushy and the potatoes on the top way too crispy.  I love sweet potatoes, but I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of the usual syrupy sweet potatoes with marshmallows.  Everybody loved it--less fat and calories than my "usual", with a great flavor.  I used cinammon instead of mace.  I'll definitely make this again (and my mom wanted the recipe).

I personally don't like sweet potatoes but I made this for a family party and everyone loved it. My mom kept asking me for the recipe. My husband even liked it and he doesn't like sweet potatoes either. Thanks.

I thought this was easy & delicious. I thought the mace was perfect, but I think I'll use different apples next time, as the grannies I used were a little TOO tart, and didn't get as soft as I would've liked. My 7-yr-old loved the potatos, but not the apples so much.

What a nice change from mashed or roasted sweet potatoes. This is elegant enough to serve to dinner guests... expect a lot of "Wow... this is good!

This is truly a great recipe! Taste's scrumpiously delicious. The only drawback, was that my family felt the presentation is a little too dark to look as appetizing as it really is.

Good - and fairly easy to prepare.  Will try it with pork chops or ham next - may be even better than with turkey (made this as one of our Thanksgiving side dishes). My husband thought it would be great to add a crumbly, crispy topping to it,  as it would add another texture - and another layer of sweetness.

This was a huge hit thanksgiving. I expected lots left over but they ate it all! I sliced my apples across the apple so I had full round thin slices. The only thing I would do different is maybe reverse the order. Put the apples in first so you end up with potatoes on top. The brown sugar and mace is yummy! I might also mix some chopped walnuts or pecans in the last bit of brown sugar that goes on the very last.

Thanksgiving crowd loved this! 
I used cinnamon and nutmeg instead of mace. Added pecans and less brown sugar!

I added cashews for  bit of protein and caramelized onion for savour.  The caramelized onion really made the flavours pop.   I also halved the sugar, but it was still too sweet for my taste.  I will make it again, but will leave out the sugar entirely.  I also did not boil the sweet potatoes before baking.  They were quite soft enough after baking for 50 minutes, and would have been mushy had they been boiled first.

We don't care for the gloppy sweet of canned sweet potatoes and marshmallows, so this simple recipe fits the bill.  Some modifications if you choose:  use your traditional apple pie seasonings (nutmeg, cinnamon, maybe a dash of cardamom); avoid overcooking the sweet potatoes - they should be just getting to fork tender (otherwise they overcook in the recipe); Use a firm, tart apple (granny smith/jonagold type); for a little texture, sprinkle some toasted chopped walnuts in the layers or on top; finally, free up oven space and use your crock pot (start high and after a couple of hours, check the tenderness of the apples and reduce to low).
(Variation on a recipe in Fannie Farmer Cookbook - my version 1979, original copyright back to the early 1900's).

We had this for Thanksgiving and it was not a big hit - it was just so-so, nothing special and not very flavorful.  Plus, it was a lot of work peeling and slicing all the apples in addition to those I did for the apple pie.
