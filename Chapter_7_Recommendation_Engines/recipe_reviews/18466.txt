Mirella:  Your other reviewer must not be familiar with gnochhi or they would understand that the texture is what the cook is shooting for here.  The sauce is where the real flavor comes from.  Your gnocchi recipe was just like my grandmother, Italia, used to make.  Thanks.

This recipe was easy and tasty! I was happy to find an egg-free version of this dish. Since this was my first time making pasta, I kneaded the flour into the potato 1/4 cup at a time until the dough was not sticky and easy to work with, so I did not run into any handling or cooking problems. I also modified the recipe to include 1 tsp. of sea salt, 1 tsp. of fresh ground pepper and 3 cloves of crushed garlic (mashed in with the potato). Delicious!

Where's the egg in this recipe?  I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with a big mess!  They didn't hold together in the boiling water and ended up looking like porridge.  What a waste!

This recipe was great! Mine came out nice and firm, although it might have beed a good idea to let it sit for a bit before boiling. . .I just added a bit of parmesan/ romano  to the potatoes, but they tasted subtly nice. . . I really dint realize that they would expand, i will make the pieces smaller next time. But I love these , will definitely make them again. . :D

The finish product is very good!  Just note, the dough in the end was enough for 10-12 people.  I ended up adding 2 cups of flour more to the dough.  I did read the reviews prior to cooking and used small baking potatoes, but that was still too much.  Maybe she meant 8 small new potatoes? Overall, very yummy!

This is my Northern Italian Grandmother's family recipe - to the letter!

The only thing our family does differently is to roll them in flour with our INDEX FINGER.  Perhaps those that had trouble did so because of the fork (just a suggestion).  Although it does take some getting used to rolling them.

I found this recipe better than the Gnocci I on this site.  Maybe it is the lack of egg....maybe I used more flour this time around without thinking or maybe it was because I used leftover mashed potatoes.  Who knows - but I know this will be the recipe I use for Gnocci in the future.  Thanks!

These are real italian gnocchi like my grandmother or my aunt make them. I gave the recipe to one of my friends who's half italian like me and he said it's been the best gnocchi he's ever eaten. Thanks for sharing!

There is nothing wrong with this recipe in principle.  It is basic gnocchi.  But, my problem was the proportions.  As it does not specify the type of potato nor size, I had to guess at what type to use.  Because of this, the amount of flour was variable as well.  I ended up using a starchy (russet) medium sized potato (about the size of a cricket ball) and it worked out fine for the amount of flour suggested.  The second concern I have is that there were no seasonings suggested.  Without something, they tasted quite bland.  Salt at the very minimum should have been suggested as well.

The best things in life are simple. Simple from the standpoint of ingredients, not labor. They do take a while, and the kitchen is a mess when I'm done, but they are worth every second. The batter got progressively more difficult to work with as it sat, so I will make half the dough at a time, and let the potatoes cool more before I mash them. I am serving them with a tomato-cream sauce made with sausage (removed from casing) and ground beef.

This evening marked my first attempt at making gnocchi. I picked this recipe because of its simplicity and because other reviewers said it was authentic. I made these changes: I used only 4 potatoes instead of 8, kept the butter about the same, and started with 1 cup of flour, adding more until I had a soft, pliable dough. It was easy to roll out on a well floured counter top and they cooked and floated to the top just fine. I used them in a cream soup with pork sausage and vegetables. While the gnocchis were very soft they were not pasty and tasted good.

Now, I don't claim to know the history of gnocchi but I will venture to guess that it started out as a "peasant" dish, that is, easy to make and hearty. While we have ingredients measured out for us in this recipe, gnocchi was never meant to be rocket science! :) Strictly adhering to the recipe rather than using your eyes and hands to see and feel the dough will probably result in less than satisfactory gnocchi. This recipe was a good starting point for a beginner like me. I will definitely be making it again, trying to perfect it. :)

Gnocchi is supposed to be bland, the flavour comes from the sauce!  Feel free to season the dough, if you must, however :) The rolling with a fork was a fantastic idea!  The less you handle the dough, the less flour you need (to avoid the over-floury taste).  For the same reason, I suggest BAKING the potatoes instead of boiling them :)

I had to add about 1 cup more flour to keep this dough from being too sticky. Keep that in mind while you are making these. I think this was because of the high humidity, as well as the potatoes being a bit moist. This turned out soooo wonderful!

This is a great recipe, I feel you who had trouble may not have cooked it long enough, hence the mushy's. Also, I used 1 pound potatoes to 1 cup flour. Potatoes vary in size so you can't really say a number of potatoes, you need to weigh them. I added a table spoon of Pesto to the mixture and  also heavily salted the water before cooking the Gnocchi's. it was perfect.

Very easy to follow and worked very well.  I found that 1 potato (about 5-7 inches long) peeled, cubed, then boiled (starting with the potatos in cold water and bring to boil)....will make enough gnocchi to fill two bowls.  Also, just a tip to prevent the fresh gnocchi from sticking together in the boiling water....before dropping them in one-by-one, spray the surface of the boiling water with any type of nonstick spray.  As the gnocchi passed through the surface, I didn't have any issues with sticking.  I was able to scoop the gnocchi out from the surface as they rose up...and they didn't even stick to each other in the bowl.  The naturally starchy surface of the gnocchi absorbed the sauce wonderfully.  Whatever you do, don't rinse the gnocchi at any point during this recipe...the starch is key.  Thanks again for the egg-free recipe!  I never have eggs in the house for some reason.  :)

I really enjoyed this recipe. Gnocchi is one of my stand-bys at Italian restaurants and I'm excited to find a recipe to make at home. The texture of the recipe is a little bit different than what you'd get in a restaurant, but the taste is great. They are a little 'fuzzy' around the edges and don't look too appetizing....Cover them with sauce and you are good to go! I would advise other cooks to make sure that the potatoes are mashed until completely smooth (no lumps whatsoever!!)The smoother, the better...I like to make a big batch of this recipe and freeze whatever I don't use immediately. Freezing the uncooked gnocchi is super-convenient. If I don't have much time to cook, I can just throw several into a pot of boiling water and heat up some sauce. A very quick and easy meal on the go. Though making the recipe is initially time-consuming, having them on-hand in the freezer is worth the effort!

I have mixed feelings toward this recipe,but only good mixed feelings.One reviewer liked this with no egg in it.But another reviewer asked where is the egg?I have never made gnocchi before but it appears after reading several recipes that making gnocchi is relatively easy.But I will say this,I am not Italian but I love Italian food and hope to learn more Italian dishes than just the typical spaghetti and such.I am starting with gnocchi.My question is this:what exactly is gnocchi?is it mashed potatoes made into small nuggets boiled and covered with sauce,or is it riccota cheese done the same way?What is authentic gnocchi?I do like the potato version and will make that.But I also want to say,egg is used as a binder in a lot of meats and dishes.Eggs help to bind ingredients together so it won't become like porridge like a reviewer said.So I really don't understand the concept of this dish without egg in it to act as a binder to hold the potatoes together. besides that,I think this will be very good when I make it.

Sigh.  I'm so bummed.  I thought somehow that I'd be able to make the recipe work, like the happy reviewers did.  I think it's all about technique, which I definitely got wrong.  Weight on the potatoes would be good (though I do realize this kind of recipe is a guideline because moisture is so variable.)  Tonight I Googled Chef Joey Campanaro of The Little Owl's no-egg technique.  I'll try it with this recipe and see if I do better.

The more you work flour, the tougher it becomes. Thought these were great. Served with a simple heavy cream and blue cheese sauce. Went great with a London broil I made.

It was a good recipe.  It was tougher and more time consuming than I had expected.  I had a tough time with my first batch but adjusted the flour and everything worked out fine.  It was my first time making gnocchi so, inexperience, I am sure, played a huge part.

These were yummy! I had some glitches with the cooking, though. I set the serving size to 1 which meant I used 2 potatoes, but the 15 minutes of boiling wasn't enough to make them mashable. I didn't want to take the time to go back and boil more water, so I nuked the potatoes for 45 seconds. This made them a weird consistency and the mashed potatoes still had chunks in them. Then I ended up using too much flour and had to add LOTS of extra butter. But even with the chunks of potato in them, the cooked dumplings still tasted yummiful. Good recipe!

Would be helpful to specify the size of the potatoes. Apparently the ones I used were way too big because I had to add a lot of flour, and the dough was still very sticky. I still was able to boil them, and though they were a little on the soft side, they were delicious. My boyfriend and I both ate a huge plate - served them with vodka sauce. His roomate stole the leftovers out of the fridge and said "I don't have any idea what that stuff was your girlfriend made, but man it was good!" ha ha. Will make again for sure, but with less potato. Thanks!

Having tasted Mirella's goods, I have to say that they are yummy.  Her gnocchis are big, full and when you fry them lightly, the tips get hard and tasty.

Highly recommend more than a mouthful!

This was my first time making Gnocchi, it went alright, but I would cook them longer next time as they were a bit gooey. I served them with tomato sauce and sprinkled cheese on top! Tasted pretty good.

This recipe is a great starting point!  Be sure to keep adding the flour and knead 1 egg in to keep it all together.  Also, let the gnocchi boil for about 5-7 minutes AFTER it floats.

This tasted exactly like my grandma used to make!  The only thing I adjusted was I added two crushed cloves of garlic to the dough.  Yummy!

This recipe did not work for me, starting with the "8 potatoes"--considering that potatoes come in all different sizes. Consequently, the amount of flour and butter in the recipe is inaccurate. Having never made gnocchi before, I wasn't sure what the texture of the dough should be. When making the dumplings it seemed fine but collapsed in the boiling water. I ended up with the porridge that another reviewer described with was unappetizing and inedible.

 I'll find a recipe that gives the number of pounds of potatoes and hopefully the flour and butter will be proportionately correct. I may try making gnocchi again (it'a a lot of work) but would not follow this recipe.

Mine didn't turn out. Waste of time and money. After the fact found out that there should be egg and only a bit of flour, not nearly what this recipe calls for. Will try again with a different recipe than this one.  Suggest you do the same.

I'm sorry to say, I didn't really care for it. Without a sauce it's inedible. I don't think I'll make this one again... but thanks anyways!

I’ve never made gnocchi before and I don’t have a grandma or aunt that made it for me. However, I have had delicious gnocchi in the past at restaurants and friend’s houses. I enjoyed making this (even though it was somewhat time consuming). After cooking, I served it to my boyfriend with a spicy vodka sauce on top and a little bit of mozzarella cheese on top. He LOVED it! He even checked to make sure that I was leaving the leftovers for his lunch the next day. It’s definitely a good dish to have on the back burner especially if you’re looking for a way to get rid of all of those potatoes sitting around :)

Decent, though a bit bland.  I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to make it less bland.  You also need a lot less potato and a lot more flour than reported.  I used 4 waxy potatoes (peeled before boiling) and put them through a ricer (just mashed leaves lumps!) and it was enough to feed 4 people!

Perfect recipe. I made a few changes I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them, then added 3 cloves of minced garlic & a tablespoon of mayonnaise into the mashed potato mixture. I then rolled it out cut it an placed it on cookie sheets covered with plastic wrap an froze them. I then deep fried them for no more then 4 mins an they come out soft pillowy an absolutely PERFECT!!! My family absolutely loves them deep fried an now want me to make it all the time.

A good base.  Changes below.

1) Bake the potatoes, then mash them through a screen into a bowl.
2) Add butter
3) Add finely chopped green onions, salt, pepper, and an egg.

So sorry...no photo because we ate all of the gnochi. I thought I might suggest the gnochi maker check the flour being used.  Some flour is too light (cake flour) and some is too heavy (unbleached whole wheat)unless the cook adjusts the amount of those types of flour, more or less as needed for the consistency desired.  I lived in Mexico and the flour there was much more dense than in the USA.

I'm no gnocchi genius for sure, but this recipe as it's written seems to have too much flour per potato mixture.  It says to use 1 cup mashed potatoes with 2 cups flour, at least I think that's what it says which tastes too doughy or floury for me. If you add equal parts potato it improves ?? I think ???

I made this for dinner last night, but I changed the servings to suit the group we were feeding.  It was way way to much-but boy was it good.  So easy, we'll be making this again & again!  I had to add about a cup more flour to make the dough less sticky!

This is a very good recipe!  I had to use a lot more flour, but I just eyed it.  As I am a beginning cook, I had a bit of hesitance making this meal, but, it turned out great!  I suggest adding spices to the gnocchi mix to give them a little kick and also cutting them smaller so that it's not like you're stuffing your face, it should be light! :)  Mozzarella cheese please :)  I cooked mine with a tomato sauce with olives.  wonderful vegetarian meal!

What a tasty, easy dish! Especially when you're broke and all you have left in the fridge is a sack of potatoes. TIPS! Don't over-cook the spuds! I read some other recipes for gnocchi before settling on this one, and one reviewer made that suggestion that saved my dumplings. I used 6 medium/small red potatoes and 1 1/2 Cups flour (will use 2 cups next time). These are even good the next day! Love love love them!

I love this recipe! To keep from ending up with a big blob of mush don't put the gnocchi in a bowl before cooking, and drop them into the water one at a time. It makes the cooking process take a little longer, but is so worth it!

After reboiling, these completely fell apart and I was left with potato mush.  I may try this again, but I don't know for sure.  It was quite discouraging, might try finding a new recipe.

This was my first time making gnocchi, and it seemed as though everything was going well until I drained out the boiling water and half of it went to mush.  I could also could taste too much flour.  I have no idea what I did wrong! In need of some advice!

easy, fast to make, odd but very good! I'd recommend boiling the potatoes a little longer than 15 minutes, otherwise everything turned out well! I added fresh rosemary to the water which had a nice flavor. my picky 15 month old enjoyed them! major plus hahaha

I've never made gnocchi before, and I've also never boiled potatoes whole (I usually peel and chop them up first).  My potatoes definitely didn't cook long enough, so when I mashed them it was really tough, and they were REALLY lumpy.  If you're not used to cooking potatoes whole, I'd suggest just doing it however you normally would for mashed potatoes.  The gnocchi still turned out ok, though.

HORRIBLE for a 1st timer, so practice makes perfect, i bout cried because nothing seemed to be going right-the potatoes werent done even though i burned myself several times trying to peel it after, then it wasn't mashing....but at the end it was fun rolling it in pieces and watching it float and my guys ate all of it without complaint

This was a first time I have ever made these and they turned out pretty good. I added some fresh ground pepper, garlic, and seasoning salt, along with an egg to the potatoes before I added the flour. I didn't cook the first batch long enough and they were kinda doughy still, but after I cooked them longer, they tasted great.  My husband said they were pretty good :)

This recipe was very easy! I altered it a bit and added 10 potatoes, salt, 2 eggs. But they were delicious my kids had 3 helpings each. The reason I changed it is because my 91 yr old Italian mom told me to add the eggs. They were definitely delicious!

Better than other gnocchi recipes that include eggs. So light and fluffy! I used 4 tablespoons of butter and a sprinkle of sea salt. Once cooked, I simmered in coconut mushroom lemon sauce. Best gnocchi I have made! And because they are egg free, they can fit easily into the lynn genet the plan.

I added dried parsly for color and this is quite nice. I riced the just cooked potatos and used selmalina flour. I let it rest for about 30 minutes before cooking it. I made a half recipe and it fed three with some left over. I will make this agian.

Absolutely delicious! After reading the reviews I used 6 red potatoes and 2 cups flour. It was a perfect dough. I made them for my boyfriend for his birthday and they melted in our mouths. These are a keeper!
