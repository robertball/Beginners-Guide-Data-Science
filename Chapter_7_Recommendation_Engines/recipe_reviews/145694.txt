I like this recipe a lot and so does the family but the blueberry filling really has no taste once the shortcake is cooled off.  I would recommend that you add about 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup of sugar to the filling before putting it into the well.

Really good, the texture I found was kind of pound-cakey, but a delicious pound cake anyways! I topped it with jam instead of pie filling and it was even better, in my opinion. I will definetly make again !

EDIT- ok the next day they were GROSS :( not even a 2 star. Maybe I won't make them afterall...

Made this using homemade blueberry pie filling instead of the canned kind. Turned out amazingly well and it was SO delicious with a nice scoop of double vanilla ice cream on top while still warm.. keeper!

I have used the shortcake part of this recipe several times.  I roll it out on a pan and put fresh raspberries on top.  The shortcake is sweet enough to be good on its own but the raspberries definitely shine in my version.

Followed the recipe except didn't put blueberries in it.  Used it for strawberries instead.  It was really good and soaks up strawberry juice very well.  I would like it a little thicker for strawberry shortcake though.  :-)

I made no changes.  It was perfect.  I bet canned strawberries would be great also!!
