Swai is such a great fish to cook with it. It is very mild in flavor and holds its shape very well without falling apart. I was feeling a little adventurous and decided to add some blackening rub along with the Greek seasoning (two flavors I would not normal mix) and it turned out good but the Greek season alone would have been perfectly fine too. This recipe is super simple and healthy and one I will use again.

I made it but I used fresh seasoned catfish fillets instead because they were on sale. Also made sauteed spinach and couscous. easy.

Easy, loved it.  I could eat this several times a week for lunch or dinner and not get tired of it.

Used the electric skillet.  Easy clean-up.

It was very blah, and a little dry. I feel it needed to be cooked in something to moisten it up a bit.
