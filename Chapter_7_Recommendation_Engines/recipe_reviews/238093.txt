Good. Brought it to a party. It was a hit. Good way to use fresh mint. I used fewer onions.

I made this salad to take to a friend's party.  I added some kale to add more color, and  it was fairly tasty.  I would suggest making sure the watermelon is cold and firm- it gets watery after awhile.  You cannot make it beforehand too early!
