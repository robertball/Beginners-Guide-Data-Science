Was really surprised. I prefer things with meat of some sort added in, for something so basic and simple, with just a dash of soy sauce added it ended up being a truly satisfying dish.

When you're trying to lose weight it's all about the flavour and this dish has plenty.

I wasn't sure how well the cucumber would do. Typically they are best raw and get rubbery when you try to cook them. It actually worked in this recipe. The recipe submitter said you could use oil instead of lard and also to feel free to substitute any veggies you preferred. Well, I did use oil instead of lard and I did not substitute any veggies but just added some. Half of a cucumber wasn't enough veggie for 2 cups of rice in my opinion. I had an open can of shiitake mushrooms and a handful of frozen carrot/pea mix and that is what went in. I think the only issue I have with this recipe is the MSG. I refuse to use it. My 2 cups of leftover cooked rice was made from another recipe on this site which called for a bunch of soy sauce so I had plenty of flavor without the MSG. But, without  all the soy or MSG this recipe would be very bland. I am giving this 3 stars for the cucumber. I never would have added it and it actually works well.
