I used this as a "sauce" to drizzle over the fillings of our Lettuce Leaf Tacos. After the sauce thickened, I wisked in about a cup of cotija cheese. Excellent sauce.

Fantastic cream sauce. I left the seeds for more heat. Used over grilled perch. Insane.  Will use many more times. Thanks.

I was looking for a sauce that I had at a restaurant here in Puerto Vallarta. This is great! I use it on shrimp and wings.
