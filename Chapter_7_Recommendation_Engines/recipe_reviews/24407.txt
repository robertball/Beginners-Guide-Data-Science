my mom makes pho too. you can buy premade packages of spice at most vietnamese supermarkets and just dump one in. my mom roasts ginger and onion on a grill first to bring out the aroma and then adds those in the pot.

We have been to Vietman and had it from street vendors this recipe taste just like it does there. I would not change anything.

The ginger should also be charboiled in the oven along with the onion to sweeten the flavor.  In addition, it is missing some of the basic ingriendients in Pho such as peppercorns, cloves, etc.

To short-cut, I used 1 can beef broth and 1.5 cups of water as the base. It didn't taste quite like our local pho. So I added 1.5 TBL hoisin and that did it. Also, serve as directed or it looks like a mess.

I had made this cause I heard Pho was good for hangovers...it definitely worked there. This is ok. You can buy Pho broth cubes at the Asian markets and that saves a little time and adds a more authentic flavor.

I travel quite a bit and have eating Pho for lunch and loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly but the end result did not come close to what I had enjoyed in the Pho restaurant.  My wife and daughter did not enjoy but they don't like to try new things.

Very helpful breakdown of key flavors and ingredients. I needed to save some time so I cooked ground beef with sweet and sour sauce and chili sauce. Then I cooked onion, garlic and ginger. I cooked rice noodles, drained and sauteed with fish sauce. I then added meet and onion mixtures back in and added just a little more of two sauces I cooked meat in, dumped broth in and simmered for 10 min. I put out sauces and cilantro, lime and bean sprouts as garnish. My Taiwanese students loved it and said it tasted like food from home!

Top with jalape√±os and consider adding alfalfa sprouts for even more taste and spice.
