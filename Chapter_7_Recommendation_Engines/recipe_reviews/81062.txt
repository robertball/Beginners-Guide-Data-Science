This is an excellent soup: flavorful, colorful and simple. I made very few changes (fresh basil, more water and a tad more of each of the spices).

Very flexible recipe. I made it the first time as written. I have made it several times now and I have altered it a little. I saute chopped carrot with the onion and use twice as much liquid as recipe calls for.  I also use 1/2 broth and 1/2 water, leave out added salt if using canned broth. I puree 1/2 the soup and leave the rest chunky. It's also great with fresh spinach thrown in near the end of cooking. Great flavor from the spices and makes the house smell great when it cooks.

Very tasty.  I recommend blending only half of the lentil mixture, because it is much more stew-like than soup-like.  Also, I added chopped fresh basil to keep it fresh-tasting, served it with rice, and flavored with tamari rather than salt and pepper.  Try adding 1/2 - 1 teaspoons each of tumeric and coriander for more spice.

This was a very tasty meal...it wasn't soup...I didn't blend it and it was thick and yummy. 
Even my 16 year old son liked it.
He ate it on toast and I had mine over rice.

This is nice and spicy- a good base recipe to play with as the other reviews mention.  I added the juice of half a lemon and fresh spinach just before serving instead of the tomatoes.  No need to blend either.

I love this soup.  It is not spicy, just flavorful. For the taste and ease of preperation I give it 5 stars.

This was a tough one to give 4 stars to. It has plenty of heat, which is fine with me, but my wife couldn't handle it. You might want to cut back on the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon and think about adding a half can of coconut milk and, perhaps, a diced apple or two. That's how I'll make it next time.

OOOO! This is Goood! Prepared as directed. Nice and spicy. My husband loves it, the children thought it a little too spicy. I've tried three new recipes this week from allrecipes and this is our favorite. Thanks for the recipe. Good job!

Excellent and extremely tasty though I had to add a lot more water to get it to a consistency where I didn't find it too thick.

Made this but used chicken stock/broth instead of water.  Excellent.  We loved it.  Served with a dollop of sour cream.  Spicy and very filling.

So fast and easy. I changed it up a bit by cooking it in the crock pot and skipping the blender. I also added a chopped jalapeno as we love uber spicy dishes. This stuff is awesome on a cold winter day.

I really wanted to like this . . . it smelled delicious. But after two hours of simmering, the lentils were still hard as rocks. I substituted yellow lentils (the only available) for red; perhaps that was the  problem. I will try this again by simmering everything else for a while, then adding canned lentils!

I halved this recipe as we are only 3 in our family. It was absolutely necessary to add more water. I added 2 and a half cups of water in my halved recipe and it was still a thick soup. I also added more spice, but perhaps my spices were a little on the old side. I put it though the blender. My 10 year old son said it was the best soup ever.

This was really tasty! I used a fresh chili instead of cayenne, doubled the water and added the juice of 1 lemon right before serving. Great meal, filling, cheap, tasty, healthy and easy.

A very unappetizing color after it comes out of the blender. Fairly good tasting, but I probably won't make it again.

This soup was an awesome base to start out with and add as you please. I used 1 cup of water and 5 cups of homemade chicken broth. I did not have basil. I tripled the spices except for the cayenne powder, and I substituted garam masala for the cardamom. I also did not have spinach, so I added frozen peas at the end of the simmer, as well as one cooked carrot. It came out spicy and delicious!!!!

Yum! made it as written first time. The next time,I used 8C chicken broth in place of water , 1/2 the amount of cardamom (personal preference) added a heaping Tbsp fresh chopped garlic and fresh spinach (10oz)in place of frozen..served lemon wedges on the side, did not put lemon in it. Be sure to stir often and keep heat low when simmering

my classmates and i made this soup for cooking class. This soup is not very appetizing. it is too mushy and its hard to eat. i wouldnt recommend this dish. it includes a great variation of spices but theres not much taste to it other than that. my suggestion is to maybe not blend it.

Hmm... just thought it was boring.  I would not necessarily expect a lentil soup to be anything exciting, but it's called "spicy" -- and it is not.  With the cardamom, cumin and cayenne I would have expected more.  I even stuck the stuff through the blender - wasn't sure what that was going to do with lentils.  It was OK; it certainly didn't ruin it, and I'm not one to worry if something looks a little weird.  But it didn't improve it either - just made it different.  I will say one thing for it - it's healthy.

Really tasty. Unfortunately, I don't have a proper soup pot so the lentils keep sticking to the bottom! And don't have a blender either! - typically I prefer soups unblended. Despite all this :) I do love this soup - spices are great and lentil soup is always good :)

awesome recipe.  i did read most of the reviews before making my 5th attempt at this recipe and realized that i should have stayed closer to home...should not have tried my gut instinct modifications.  stayed true to the recipe with the following exceptions...  added 50% on the seasonings as i am big on flavorful soups.  as is with the liquid proportions, its very solid almost to the point of dry.  ergo the comments about adding more H2O, but it is really, really good whether you add more broth or not...just depends on what you are hoping the outcome to be.  enjoy!!!  FIVE STARS. *****

pretty good but the cardamon was a little strong tasting for me. I also added some coconut milk to make it not so tomatoeeee.  I think a can of corn might be good in here too, after you blend the rest of the soup.

I was dissapointed with this recipe.  It is edible, but nothing I would make again.  Having said this, I think it would be only fair to post the changes that I made to the recipe.  1) used only 1 1/3 cup of lentils.  2) added one diced potato  3) omitted the basil.

If you adore spinach, you will love this recipe, but I only like spinach, and it doesn't really work well in this recipe.  Note to those who complained about their finished product not resembling the photo attached to this recipe.  My soup/stew ended up looking exactly like this.  Since it was so thick, I turned on my rice cooker and made served it with the stew.  Good luck.

It didn't seem soupy to me at all....It was more of a side dish...I did make some alterations, however. Anyway, I added more of the spices, and more salt. It was really yummy.

Very hearty and very tasty - perfect for the cold weather! I used Indian Masala (Club House), and added some extra curry powder, chili powder and cayenne...it's just right for my taste.

Nice basic lentil soup. I added more water, and might like to add more spices, but still very good, and pretty much along the lines of what you would get if you ordered lentil soup in a restaurant. It's true you could have it unpureed, but the flavours come out better when it's pureed as it's meant to be.

This was very good, but we ended up having to add way more liquid than the recipe calls for.  I added another cup of water and it still needed more.  I didn't want to lose the flavor by adding more water and thought tomato sauce would do, but didn't have any, so ended up adding a can of tomato soup!  It was good and relatively healthy.  We did not put it in the blender either, but briefly used the immersion blender.  Also sauteed some carrots with the onions at the start. Thanks for sharing.

Very good! I purred cooked the lentils before adding everything else in, then purred most of the lentils and then added the rest of the vegetables - so they wouldn't get "lost" in the soup.

Very easy to make, healthy, and quite tasty; I highly recommend this recipe.  It is also flexible, I added some carrots and celery that I needed to get rid of and the recipe accomodated the changes well.

a wonderful mix of tastes!  of course, with any recipe, the spices need to be tweaked to fit your family's likes and dislikes, but the variety and the core of this recipe makes a delicious soup.  my husband and i look forward to making this throughout the winter!

Yum! I used chicken stock instead of water and skipped the cardamom, spinach and blending (too lazy and out of ingredients) but still very very tasty! So cheap and easy to make. : ) thanks!

With a few small changes, this was an amazing soup/stew.  Double the liquid (I used 2 cups water, 2 cups of mushroom bullion).  I didn't use the blender, and cut back a bit on the cardamom.  We absolutely loved it like this.  My other half, who usually adds Vietnamese hot sauce to everything enjoyed this as is. :)  Tons of flavor!!!  Thanks.

This recipe was alright. The cardamom tended to overrun the other flavors -- but in all fairness I don't tend to measure precisely and I may have been a bit heavy-handed with it. I added extra tomatoes and that helped to balance it out. If I make use this recipe again, I'll leave out the cardamom altogether, go ahead and add the tomatoes anyway, and maybe increase the cayenne a bit.

This was so good, I really loved it. The second time I made it I got a little adventurous with the spices and found an amazing secret ingredient - cinnamon. You should try it if you like interesting flavor combinations! I also didn't blend mine because I thought it was great as a chunky stew.

I really wanted soup, not stew, so I used instead two cups of chicken broth, two cups of water, only one cup of lentils, double the spices (used garam masala for the cardamom/cumin), and the rest of the ingredients in their original proportions. I also added the spinach in the last ten minutes of simmering time. The day I decide to eat it as a stew with rice or other starch, I'll follow the recipe to a T.

Really delicious!  But once the spinach is cooked, it's more a brown stew than a red soup.  Next time I'll omit the frozen spinach and serve topped with chopped fresh spinach for better color.

This was okay, but for whatever reason, the cardamom ruined it for me, and I only did 1 tsp. I added 1/2 tsp. of turmeric, 1/2 tsp. of coriander (as someone suggested) and an extra 1/2 tsp. of curry, used chicken broth instead of water (3 cups, not 2) and didn't blend it. The lentils seemed to need about 45 minutes to get soft. I would make this again without the cardamom, and either with more broth to make it soupier, or served over basmati rice using the 3 cups of broth only. It was pretty easy to throw together though.

Love this. Needed an extra three cups of water, but it was delicious. Might amp up the heat next time. Used an immersion blender for convenience. Baked fresh rolls and served them with this soup, good wine, and fresh strawberries for dessert. Nice weeknight easy supper for guests using stuff I have on hand. Will absolutely make it again!

This was awful! My hubby loves lentils and has cooked lentil soup as a professional restaurant cook. I tried to surprise him. Fail! This is gritty! I would never make it again. A ton of mess and not great. And also if you know soup you typically only blend a fourth to one half. Epic fail!!!

Loved it!  I added water until I liked the consistency.

Really tasty dish, but I did make some changes. I used fresh swiss chard and simply mixed it in. Kale also works well. There is no need to pre-cook; the leaves will wilt nicely. I also did not use a blender. I prefer a chunkier stew. The spices are wonderful and red lentils are one of my favorites. This is also great over rice.

Yum.  I doubled the cumin and tripled the curry powder and added salt to bring out the flavors after cooking and blending.  I blended all the soup, but just barely for 1/2 of it and blended the other 1/2 more thoroughly so when mixing the 2 back together, it created a nicer look and contrasting textures.  I also used a bunch of kale instead of spinach because it's what I had on hand.  All in all, really easy and yummy.  Practically cooks itself!

Nice and spicy. I added extra chillies and instead of a ready made curry  curcuma, all spice, fresh ginger, ground coriader. had to add more water as and left the spinach out.

This recipe is great!  I read the reviews that said it's not very soup-like, but I wanted to try it anyway.  They're right.  It's not very soup-like at all, but it's delicious.  I prefer not to blend it, but instead just serve it over basmati rice.  I ran out of cardamom on one occasion and made it without and it was still very good.  It's got just the right amount of savory and spicy.  If you like Indian food, you'll like this.

This was very yummy! I made a few changes as it didn't have as much kick as I like, but that is just personal preference. I only had 1 cup of red lentils, so I threw in some frozen corn (it added some great colour too). I added a bit more spice, and I threw in some cilantro for some extra flavour. Instead of water, I used some vegetable stock. I ended up not blending it, as it looked great just as is. It was fast, easy and very healthy too!

Perfect!  Only thing I did differently is sub ginger for cardamom and double the spices... which even then wasn't quite to my taste....

I'm giving this recipe three stars, because I feel it has great potential, but the spices were not to my liking.  I don't often (read: ever) use cumin or cardamom, and they were a bit strong for me.  I plan on trying this recipe again, omitting these spices.  It's super-cheap to make, and is packed with great nutrients.  I think I'd leave everything else alone!

This was and is an amazing recipe.  I did make a couple changes.  I added more spices to give it an extra kick.  I also only pureed half because I like texture.  Also I did have to add more water.  Soooo yummy, and healthy to boot!!!!

I made this recipe with a few changes:
1) Added spinach and fresh basil in the last five minutes of cooking (I recommend this!)
2) Added shreaded meat from a rotisserie chicken near the end
3)Only put about 1/3 of it into a blender to puree
4) Served as a stew over rice
It turned out to be a pretty good meal, but not earth-shattering.  I enjoyed the combination of spices, which were definitely different and spicy.  It's too bad that it didn't really look appetizing.  I'm not sure where all the pretty colors come from in the recipe picture, but mine turned out kind of greenish.
Overall, I may make this again if I have some lentils leftover from some other dish.

This is the most disgusting looking thing I've ever eaten (I used green lentils instead of red ones, which I'm sure didnt help), but it was delicious!  However, I did have to add about a cup more water, and used the tomato juice as well.  Also, it took about 45 minutes for the lentils to cook.

This is excellent!!  I added about twice the water and twice the tomatoes to make it more soupy.  Mmmmm...
