Pepper lovers dream! Made exactly as specified in recipe and video. Don't be afraid of the pepper and be sure to use the balsamic vinegar in the sauce. They are the perfect blend of spicy and savory sweet. Just like all of the Chef John's recipes we have tried this was so simple to make and so delicious.

This turned out much better than I expected.  Very tender.  Used the gravy over white rice, also very good.

I actually couldn't t find a friend tip at my grocery store, for some reason... Instead, I believe I used a chuck roast that was quite a bit bigger than a 3 pounder and it was a huge party pleaser. Probably the best thing ive ever made for my DnD party. As for the pan sauce, I had a major mishap whenever I realized I didn't have any stock of any variety. In a fit of pan dripping-induced panic, I poured a bottle of honey ginger beer in the pan to deglaze it. Now, I know this is weird. Bizzare even. But holy mother of beef it was SO good. Sweet, spicy from the pepper, and tart from the balsamic it was nothing s short of a breakthrough of culinary magesty. 10/10 would devour again.

Absolutely, hands down the best roast EVER! This process flavors the beef perfectly. It is spicy but well worth it. I cooked mine on a Traeger pellet smoker and the neighbors were knocking on the door!

Did ya really have to show a bloody piece with veins?  Eew - love it but don't want it to look so alive.
 
I cook it at 200 degrees for as long as it takes to reach 130 degrees.  It is pink throughout but not bloody.  Slow cooking makes even a tough cut (like a sirloin roast or even a round roast) almost as tender as prime rib!

I'm 70 y/o and I just learned this trick a couple years ago by reading the Cooking Light magazine.  Wonderful for shaved roast beef sandwiches too!

Just made for Christmas. In the video there is a suggestion to "dry cure" the meat for an additional 24 hours if you have an extra fridge. I really think it makes all the difference and it is a fun experiment. The peppercorn rub is nice, and it may seem like too much but in reality it is no means overwhelming. The gravy with the drippings is excellent, I used beef stock. Really tender meat, and relatively inexpensive compared to beef tenderloin. Definitely a keeper will make again.

Wonderful!  Didn't have all the ingredients, so I used minced garlic and some Peppered-Up House Seasoning to make a paste and added extra crushed peppercorns. Followed the instructions from there. My guys raved about it! This one is a keeper, for sure!

What a wonderful meal! I followed this exactly as Chef John wrote it. It was my first time using green & pink peppercorns, they were so flavorful and pretty. We do like our meat a bit less pink, so I cooked this to medium-well. The meat was simply amazing. I served it with baked potatoes and sliced, honey glazed carrots. Don't skip the pan sauce, it really makes the meal.

The cook time for me was totally off. 15 min preheated 450° oven with a flip in the skillet oven down to 200° for another 15 min produced a 75° center reading. No confidence.

Couldn’t get a tri-tip so i Used a 3 pound eye of round... excellent!   Followed recipe but did not age. Started at 450* for 15 minutes... flipped over and stuck in a digital thermometer .  Took longer to roast at 200* cuz of thickness.  We like med rare meat so we opted for  125* rather than 300*...took about 1 hour and 5 minutes.
Made pan sauce using beef stock while roast rested.   This was amazing !  I Will def do again!
Thank you Chef Jon for still another great recipe!  We plan on doing this for our family gathering in the new year !

Although I made the rub differently I cooked it per the directions and it was SO tender. The gravy was excellent. Will make again. This would be great to serve to guests.

I love Chef John's recipes...and videos make it more fun.  At first I thought the inside was a little on the rare side for my tastes so I only served the end pieces and saved the middle for later.  But OMG after refrigerating and slicing it paper thin the rare section is SO DELICIOUS!  I might just make another one and refrigerate the whole thing and then slice thin for delicious sandwiches.

I made this with a regular rump roast and it turned out wonderful. I suggest using the meat thermometer since it was a tad bit rare in the middle but it was perfect when I cut from the outside in. It was only for my husband and I so we can reheat the rare pieces for left overs and they will be perfect. My husband could not stop commenting on how yummy the gravy was.

I followed this roast beef and gravy recipe to a T, and they turned out amazing! I did however use a different cut of roast beef. It was so tender, very flavorful, so juicy and just so delicious. Thank you for sharing this easy to make recipe.
