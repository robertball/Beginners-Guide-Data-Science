First time having and making gazpacho. Who knew something so simple could be so good? My husband was pleasantly surprised too! I made this recipe as written and it was delicious!

Very light and refreshing! I used burrata with black truffles, and it was outstanding. Loved it!

I was looking for a way to use all the cucumbers my friend gave me. I normally like the recipes I get from Chef John. I didnâ€™t like this. I even splurged for the burrata cheese. From trying this recipe, I learned that members of my family love burrata cheese, but none of us are fans of gazpacho.

Served this as a prelude to Chef John's simple Chicken Parmesan for a dinner for six.  Just as written.  Easy - delightful - well received.  Everyone enjoyed.

Tip - the strained fiber still tastes very good. I freeze the strained bits in an ice cube tray and use them to flavor other soups, stocks, etc., or throw a cube on meats or veggies roasting in the oven. The Gazpacho Verde is flavorful and refreshing. The perfect summer soup!

This is awesome. I reduced the basil and rice vinegar. The burrata cheese was perfect. The finale few spoon fulls after the creamy cheese mixed with the gazpacho is one of the best flavors I have ever tasted. I will make this over and over.

I tried it just because I'd never tried a cold soup before. It was very fresh and had a nice citrusy flavor from the vinegar. I probably wouldn't make it again because I like cheese with every bite, which made it very rich. I ended up not having room for the main coarse of my dinner for a soup that wasn't necessarily my favorite. But hey! I tried it right!? Be adventurous! You should try it too, I think you might be pleasantly surprised! The only thing I recommend is to cut the recipe in half so you don't have so much left over -- It goes bad fairly quickly. Have fun trying something different!!!!
