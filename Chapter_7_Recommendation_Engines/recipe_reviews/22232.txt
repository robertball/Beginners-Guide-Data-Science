I made this using oreo cookies, some chopped up kitkat and heath bars. A few people found it too sweet. I guess the cream between the oreos should br removed then. Not bad i would say.

Even though you can't beat a simple pudding/cookie dessert, this one was rather disappointing.  First of all, there is no way that there is enough ingredients to fill a 9 X 13 dish.  I used 30 cookies instead of 10 and could only fill a 8 X 8 dish.

it wasnt bad, but it could have been better, it needed a crust and maybe a layer of cream cheese whip, and you could omit wafers because they just get soggy

I really didn't like this.  I agree with the other reviewer's that the flavour was bland.  The whip cream and wafers overpowered everything and the whip cream itself was bland without vanilla and barely sweet.  Also the layers were so thin that it became mostly wafer, too bad I had high hopes for this one.

I don't know why others said this dessert doesn't have much flavor. This is the best dessert I have ever had. Everyone loves it and I'm asked to make it all the time by friends and family members. This recipe is a hit! You can't fail, it's easy and delicious! 5 Big Stars on this one!

It was delicious. I did use cool whip instead of heavy cream as a time saver.

This recipe is delicious and light. Not meant to be super sweet. But like Karen says you can add and adjust to your taste. Yumm!

This one was a big hit.  I made it for a tailgate party.  I used vanilla wafers and heath bits on the advice of another reviewer.  Make sure to make this one the same day you serve, otherwise the wafers could get soggy.

This stuff is awesome!! It cost me seven bucks to make, so its cheap to. I used oreos for the crust,leaving them kinda chunky. With crushed up kit kat bars for the toping. Definately potluckable!!
