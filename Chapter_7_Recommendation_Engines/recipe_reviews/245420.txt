You don't have to be gluten free to enjoy these muffins. The overall flavor is quite mild and not too sweet. I used half white teff and half dark teff, mixed. I did add the banana and nuts.  I was weary of the high temperature though and so I baked them at 185°C (365°F) for 20 minutes and they were perfect. Half the recipe yielded 9 regular sized muffins. Thank you for the recipe.
