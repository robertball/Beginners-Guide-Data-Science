I found that roasting the veggies at 400 F in the oven for an hour brought to the soup a lot more flavour than it would have otherwise had. Also, roasting saves the onerous task of peeling and cutting up the squash and the sweet potatoes. Once you roast them, you can just peel them away from their skins. Since I don't have an immersion blender and didn't want the mess of pouring the soup into the blender to smooth once it had cooked in the pot, I put my veggies--whole baby carrots, roasted garlic, onions, the squash and sweet potato, thyme and rosemary--right into the food processor when they came out of the oven, then added the pureed works back to the pot and stirred in the evaporated milk. I would recommend simmering for at least 30 min to allow the flavours to blend.

I cant give this recipe a true rating because I made a few changes of my own. I roasted  sweet potato (not yam), carrot, acorn squash, onion and garlic in the oven for about an hour. I added this to a pot and heated over low heat with chicken stock for about 20 minutes. I dont have one of those hand blenders (I really should invest in one of those) so I transfered soup into my blender and gave it a 15 second puree, poured it back into the pot and seasoned with grated ginger, red pepper flakes, pepper, dried dill weed and curry powder then let it simmer for another 20 minutes. Poured in some half and half until I got the creamy consistency I desired. Heated for another minute or two. I will definitely be making this again. YUM!

This was an AMAZING soup!  Lovely and thick and so full of flavour!  I found it a bit spicy for my taste, so next time I will omit the red pepper flakes.  I also added 1 can of Pumpkin pie filling, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of Nutmeg.  I also vouched for the Fat Free evaporated milk - delicious!

This soup is delicious and so easy to make despite the chopping. I too omitted the milk (lactose intolerance) and it is awesome. The thick consistency warms you right down to your toes, perfect for a cold fall day, thanks for sharing this amazing recipe.

Very good! I added more garlic because I love it, and  I substituted red pepper with black pepper and paprika. It still tasted great, and I got a lot of compliments on it! However preparation was difficult and took a long time. I would suggest using frozen cut up sweet potatoes and squash.

Awesome soup!  The only thing I did differently was to roast the vegetables on a baking sheet in the oven for about 20 minutes and cooked the onion, ginger and garlic in a handful of chopped uncooked bacon!  I omitted the red pepper flakes.  Flavor was great without!

Like others I roasted the veggies before simmering - but I'm sure the recipe would have been almost as good without that extra step.  Our family, including my 8 month old, LOVED this soup, and found it to be perfectly spicy. Not too hot, but it added a nice twist to a quite sweet soup.  Try it! You'll like it!

I liked the sweet potato and squash combo, and the carrot added a nice flavor. However, after a blended the soup it thickened and became more of a side dish then a soup, which was disappointing. Maybe adding more liquid would help? While it was interesting, I'm thinking I'll stick to plain butternut squash soup. The potato just made it too thick to be good soup.
