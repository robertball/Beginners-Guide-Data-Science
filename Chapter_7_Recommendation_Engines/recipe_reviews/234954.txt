Very nice and classic dish. I made mine inside puff pastry shells for ease with a group of teenagers and they licked the plate. I had to use canned Anaheim peppers (no fresh ones available to me). They make the flavour of the pepper mix stand out. I added capers and hot pepper flakes to the cheese before adding it to the puff pastry. Really a versatile and fun recipe. Thank you poppy for your recipe.

Incredible flavor!  Live the ziploc steamer method.  Upped the vinegar to 3 tbsp and added an extra clove of garlic.
