This was great right up to where he said to cut the steak to test for doneness.  That really dries a steak out. Any steak should be rested for at least 5 minutes after cooking to redistribute the juices. If you cut it, you just are letting the juices run out and drying out your steak. Use your finger to test for firmness. Very soft/squishy is rare, well done is very firm.

This recipe is Great ! My husband and I have tried this 4 times now - He actually requested it yesterday, definately a keeper. We don't usually marinade rib eye steaks because they are so tender anyway - but this is a nice change. Excellent Flavor !! And Oh Sooo Tender ! UPDATE - we never use to marinate ribeyes but we use this all the time now - the flavor is so good and it is so tender / just cooking steaks with seasoning just isn't the same.
Thank you for sharing this recipe. Awesome !!!

This marinade rocked my face off.  I exchanged honey for the syrup in the recipe and added a little more hot sauce and I thought it was great.

My quickness rating includes marinating time, but it's a fairly simple recipe. Marinated my steaks overnight, then grilled them on a George Foreman grill--it was great! I took the leftover marinade and boiled it--killed the bacteria AND reduced it into a nice sauce that I served over the steaks and the rice I was serving them with. Yum!

Wow, fabulous flavor and got high marks from my guests!  I didn't have all the fresh ingredients handy so I substituted red hot pepper flakes for the hot sauce, ground ginger for fresh ginger and added a teaspoon of horseradish.  I marinated the meat overnight and boiled the leftover marinade for a sauce. Definitely restaurant quality.

I have used thie recipe many times and we all love it. I don't usually have beer on hand, so I subsitute 1/2 Cup of Olive Oil. I also marinade it for 1 - 2 days for the full flavoring. Yum!

I was surprised at how good my filet mignons turned out.  I halved the recipe for 2 steaks; subbed 1/4 tsp. ground ginger for fresh and broiled the steaks.  These would've been better on the grill instead of broiling.  I will definitely make again!

I ended up marinating the steaks for 2 days.  They were absolutely delicious.  Juicy and tender.

Absolutely delicious.  I only marinated for a couple hours, next time will be over-night.  For the beer, I used The Famous Taddy Porter from Samuel Smith, I recommend it.

I let this sit in the fridge for one and a half hours.  It didn't do much for the meat part of the steak, but the fat part picked up a wonderful taste.  Perhaps it should have stayed in the marinade overnight for more flavor.  As it was - not bad - but it could have been much better.

I gave this a 4, my husband gave it a 5.  The only reason for the 4 was that it was too salty for me.  The next time I'll use 1/2 low-sodiium soy sauce and 1/2 regular soy sauce.  This created a very tender and flavorful steak.  My husband puts sauces on EVERYTHING, he didn't need or want a sauce on this steak.  That alone deserves a rating of a 5.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I found the steak somewhat bland tasting.   I think it was because of 1/2 cup of beer is too much and offset the flavour of all the other ingredients.

We thought this marinade was really good except for the overwhelming flavor of sesame oil.  We like to normally try a recipe by the book first and then adjust as we feel needed if at all.  We both like sesame oil, so it wasn't bad, but that particular oil is very overpowering and we didn't taste the ginger or soy at all.  We will definitely make this again, just using a sparse amount of the sesame oil.  (A little goes a LONG way!)  Thanks for the recipe!!

Beyond fabulous! More than enough marinade for two Tri-tip roasts (a west coast cut), totaling 3.5 pounds. I marinated for two days and barbequed for approx 30 minutes. Best med-rare - if overcooked, it tastes like beef jerky. The end result does not taste too much like "asian" food - it could go with anything. I used one tsp ginger powder instead of fresh, and one tsp Vietnamese hot chili sauce (Shriracha) for hot sauce. And re: the comment that was made by another reviewer that the marinade smelled and tasted terrible... in my experience the best marinades always smell funky prior to cooking!

This was very good, I just wish I would've marinated overnight.  Simple to make, I always add extra garlic.

This was great on deer steaks! Normally the deer meat needs more oil in the marinade to stay moist when grilling, but these were great.  To marinate evenly, I placed the items in a gallon ziploc bag, close and massage into the meat , then lay flat in the fridge. (Make sure most all the air is out of the bag). This also solves the problem of making everything in the fridge smell like the meat.

I used this recipe for sirloin, Zucchini and pineapple skewers.  The only difference I made, I dumped in the pineapple juice for a can of pineapple.  I'm a caterer and used these at an event for 150.  They went fast. I had made hundreds of toothpick sized skewers with a cube of meat, a chunk of pineapple and a slice of zucchini.  Awesome flavor!

I loved this! One thing - remember to add the beer AFTER mixing the other ingredients! I threw everything into a shaker...well, you can guess what happened! But, I marinated the whole day and grilled in the evening - the flavor was unbeatable! Good job!

WOW! Totally YUMMY!  This is an easy, wonderful, recipe for anytime.  I used mine to marinate my beef in for a spicy beef stir-fry.  I did however had to sub a few ingredients because I didn't have them on hand.  I used honey in place of maple syrup, olive oil in place of sesame oil and then added in a tsp. of toasted sesame seeds.  Just a REALLY GREAT recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  : )

Holy cow. I read all the reviews and thought ok but HOW amazing can this be? The answer is ALL THAT AND THEN SOME!! Marinated for 12 hours, tender, juicy, amazing-stop-you-in-your-tracks flavor. Used Shiner Bock beer. Cannot wait to make it again.

Thank you for the idea!
I switched it up a little bit and it came out great! I didnt want it hot or sweet so  i left out the hot sauce and the maple syrup and instead used orange juice.  I also used wine instead of beer.

I marinated the steaks for at least 7 hours. The steaks were tender, juicy and I could definitely taste the sesame, ginger and soy sauce, which was well balanced. nothing was too overpowering. I did not however add any beer since I did not have any on hand. I did add olive oil along with sesame oil from what other reviewers suggested. I made this with regular white rice and potato salad. A very tasty and satisfying meal!

My boyfriend came home with some rib eye steaks the other night and suggested I put a marinade on them. In search for something new to try I logged into this site. To my suprise, this was the recipe of the day so I figured I'd look no more. This recipe was AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly. Then took the left over marinade and reduced it into a sauce and poured it over top of the cooked steaks (thanks to the suggestions of other people's reviews). I've already made it again since the first time and it was just as good. I can't wait to make this for family and friends!

I might try this again, and allow for longer marinading time.  I had my steak in for about 1 and half hours prior to cooking.  It had a nice flavor, was just very mild to me and I was hoping for a stronger flavor and also hoping that with the syrup this would somehow glaze my steak more.  Definately not bad though.

My husband could not stop saying "This is Good" "Wow this is Really Good". And all I could think was "Wow, this was so easy to make." Thanks for this recipe I love steak.

Tried this today on my Traeger wood pellet grill, using a combination of maple and garlic flavored pellets. (If you haven't grilled on a Traeger, you're missing something.) I believe the maple syrup was the kicker. I've tried similar recipes, but never with pancake syrup. This is a very good marinade.

My family and I liked this recipe. I changed it just a bit per other reviews. I added lots more garlic (we love the stuff) and a little more ginger. I also added a few dashes of worstershire sauce. We prefer different cuts of steak, so I used New York Strips and Fillets. I marinated them for about 4 hours. The steaks were juicy and tender and had a great taste. We will use this marinade again. Thanks!

Thanks William for sharing such a GREAT marinade! We tried it for the first time last night and were very impressed with the taste after only marinading the steak and chicken for 90 minutes.  The only minor changes that we would make for our taste buds would be low sodium soy sauce and less maple syrup.  After reading a few other reviews, I think we'll add more hot sauce too.  We will have this again soon.  THANKS!

great steak marinade- i left it in the fridge for 2 days- and it ended up tasting great. almost like a chinese marinade that my mom used growing up- i used mirin (rice wine) instead of the beer, and since i didnt have syrup- i substituted honey instead.  will definitely try again

This was great and it really helped to tenderize the ribeye (I only marinated it for about an hour).  The hot sauce helps to add just the right amount of kick.  The ginger (I used the pureed ginger found in jars near garlic in produce section) and sesame oil really give an authentic Asian taste.

I made this twice. Once with rib-eye and once with tenderloin. It just didn't hit a home run with me. I marinaded for about 4 hours each time. I'll likely try it one last time but will marinade overnight to see if their's a significant difference.

You just turned my kitchen into the best steakhouse in town.
I'm not a beer drinker, so I substituted 1/2 cup olive oil, and I marinated the very thick sirloin for under two hours before pan-frying it to rare perfection and topping it with herb butter. It was so flavorful, but somehow subtle at the same time. This recipe is now on a sticky note on the front of my recipe binder. I will be making it a lot.

I tried this last night and I must say it was delish!! However I followed some of the comments and did not use as much sesame oil and I wish I did.. I felt it needed the more salty taste of the oil.  My hubby was very hesitant that I was using a marinade on such a wonderful steak but he was pleasantly happy with it and requested it again soon.. Thanks for sharing this one!!

We really liked this review.  In fact, my husband wanted me to use again for meat that we are having for dinner tomorrow.  We only marinated 1 hour and loved the flavor.

I had a big round steak that I wanted to do ~something~ with but couldn't decide what.  I doubled this recipe and put it in this marinade overnight.  When it was time to eat I cut the steak in half and seared one half of it on both sides in a ribbed skillet.  I didn't want it to be well done.  It was FANTASTIC!!!  I served it with a bed of romain lettuce. The dressing I created for that was just a plop of real mayo, a small orange cut up, some slivered onions and sugar.  I let that dressing weep together for about an 30 minutes while I fixed the lettuce and the meat. Thats it.  It was also FANTASTIC and went beautifully next to this Ginger steak!  Tonight:  Repeat of last night to use up (oh darn) the other half of that steak!  I can only imagine how delicious it will be after being in the marinade for another 24 hours!!!

I cut this recipe in half. I only had two large ribeyes. I let it marinate in the refridgerator for three hours. It was soooo delicious and the meat was so tender, we didnt even need a knife to cut it. Easy to make, will definetley make this one again, possiby trying deer steaks the next time.

Tasty, but a bit too sweet, that the flavor of the steak was masked too much. Might try again, but without the maple syrup.

One of the best marinades I have ever used on steak. I did use RibEyes which are tender to start with, but the marinade made them fork tender. Will continue to use over and over.

This is a phenom recipe. I've been making it for about 3 years and it is a huge family favorite.   The only changes I make are to increase the ginger and garlic (there's never enough), as well as the maple syrup (up to 1/2 cup).  I also boil the marinade for a great sauce (wonderful on mashed potatoes).  Thank you SO much William for sharing this amazing recipe!

This is basically a teriyaki, but the beer element really helps to tenderize the meat.  I used this on skirt steak, a tough cut.  I marinaded it for 24 hours and it was very tender.  I think I'll use this on my tougher cuts, not on rib eyes, since they don't need the tenderization.  Great flavor, and versatile for many cuts of meat!

Very tender.  The soy was a bit overpowering for the hubby's and my taste.  Next time will use half the amount of soy and substitute the other half with worcestershire.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was really very good. I thought I had beer when I started but got to frig & my husband had drank the last of it. :) So I used a cup of merlot instread.  Turned out wonderful.  My daughter told me I had to start using this marinade on the steaks.  I will try it again with the beer next time so I can rate it according to the recipe.

Excellent.  Bought a boneless Rib Eye roast and cut in to nice thick steaks.  Only marinated for a couple of hours and they were delicious.  Will try longer next time but would repeat again just the same way.  Thanks

This is a great recipe!  The only thing I changed was to add extra ginger and spicy sauce and this was perfect,  My oldest son, who doesn't eat much steak, said that if I cook his steak like this, he will eat steak every time I cook it.

GREAT marinade for rib eyes.  All it needs is a baked potato and big salad to complete this perfect meal.

I had never marinated anything in beer before so I was a bit skeptical about it. Shouldn't have! I'm not a huge fan of red meat (made this to please my boyfriend) but I really enjoyed this dish. Served it with peanut butter noodles from this site: great combination!

This was delicious!! I did not have beer so I used sherry and it tasted great. I marinated the steaks overnight and they were very flavorful. This is one of the best steak marinades I have tasted. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This tasted pretty good, but nothing too exciting.  We cut up the leftover steaks the next day and put it on a green salad with some Asian Ginger Dressing from this site for lunch.

This marinate made a New York strip steak absolutely AWESOME.  The only reason I downgraded this from 5 stars is that we felt it was too salty (not everyone might feel that way, though).  Next time I would use lite soy sauce.  I used 1/2 of the original recipe to marinate the 12 oz. steak (weight after trimming off fat, etc.), and there was WAY too much sauce.  Next time I would only use 1/4 of the sauce for that amount of meat.  I put the steak and marinate in a Ziploc bag and refrigerated it for 2 hrs. before grilling it.  YUM, YUM.

This was great - and in my opinion, has restaurant quality taste. I didn't have fresh ginger on hand so substituted the tbsp with the equivalence of 1/8 teaspoon of ground ginger.. I also used pancake (butter flavored) syrup and forgot to add the mustard powder - nonetheless, EXCELLENT. This was very tender and juicy. I marinated the steaks for about 5 1/2 hours before grilling.

This is an excellent recipe.  The only change I made was to omit the beer and it turned out great.  I've marinated it for an hour in the refrigerator and longer, but the extra time isn't necessary.  The first time I made it using the broiler, the second using a grill, which definitely helped.

I am not a meat eater, but my husband is.  With this flavor in the meat, I am going to start eating steak more often! My husband is happy about that because he only gets steak once a month.  EXCELLENT FLAVOR!

I made this for valentine/anniversary...it was WONDERFUL.  Try it with the Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes recipe on this site and also the grilled asparagus recipe on this site.  The combination is AWESOME.  My family is still talking about how good this was.

I am obsessed with this marinade! It made delicious ribeyes, and I had a lot of fun making my boyfriend guess all the ingredients. So far we've made it about four times and put it on halibut, veggies, and more steak! The suggestion to boil the leftover marinade and use it as a sauce was excellent. It's a lot of fun to mix up the beer and hot sauce in the recipe as well. So far our favorite is a double IPA and Cholula hot sauce.

I'm no chef, but I was able to make it and it was very tasty. I added a bit more hot sauce and red pepper flakes to make it a tad spicier. I was only able to marinate it for an hour, but it still came out great. Going to marinate it for 24+ hours next time to see the difference.

I thought this was an excellent marinade - only change was to use lite soy sauce.  I never thought soy, maple and beer would ever cross paths in my kitchen, but I really enjoyed this steak.  The soy, ginger and hint of sweetness makes it a great choice for an Asian salad.  Thanks William!

FANTASTIC!! Marinated our steaks for 18 hours, and the flavor was incredible. Like a few others, we boiled down the marinate for about 10-12 minutes to kill the bacteria, and ended up with a great glaze for the brown rice we served with the steaks.   Definitely a repeat!

This is by far the BEST marinade for steak I have ever used.  The second time I made it I omitted the beer, big mistake.  The beer adds to the tenderness for that "melt in your mouth" flavor and texture.  The ginger adds so much to the flavor.

I tasted the marinade before marinating the meat, and it was good. A bit of advice: be careful with the grilling. I grilled the meat, and it was cooked perfectly inside, but I felt the charcoalish flavor kind of overwhelmed the deep flavor of the marinade. I only marinated the meat for four hours, so perhaps overnight would keep the flavor in tact better during grilling. After I grilled it, all I could really taste was the soy sauce flavor. I am likely to try this recipe again.

I made these last weekend and added a bit more hot sauce and it was perfect.  The longer you soak the meat the more flavourful they are.  Great marinade!

This was very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly, marinating it overnight so the marinade pentrated into the steaks. I love rib eyes, they are one of my favorite cuts of steak and this marinade was puuuuuuuuuuuuurfct.

This makes a great tasting ribeye, although I did do a little substituting. As per another reviewer who didn't have beer on hand and I never do.. I used some olive oil instead. Also didn't have maple syrup but used some molasses. I also used this on thin cut ribeyes so the marinating time is much less and there is still a great flavor.

Wow - who woulda thunk it......that anything could improve the taste of a bbq'd rib eye - well this is it.  Thank you for sharing William - this is an incredible marinade.  I'm sure this would enhance any cut of beef but the rib eye is the king of steaks and this will be used again and again in my house.  Oh - I did use honey instead of maple syrup and it was great  The maple syrup just sounded so so sweet to me.  This is marinade heaven!

Easy and fast - I only marinated for 3 hours and it was tasty.  But I know that marinating the steaks for longer would have enhanced the flavor.  I cooked the remaining marinade down with a little cornstarch to make a yummy sauce.  Mmm!

What a fantastic, easy marinade.  I cut the recipe in half for only two steaks and marinaded them overnight.  The next day my boyfriend cooked them under the broiler and we both raved over dinner.  Tender, flavorful, aromatic... you name it, these steaks had them.  Perfect served with whipped mashed potatoes and spinach.

Wow, this was so good and flavorful - my guys raved over it.  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using powdered ginger (I didn't have the fresh on hand).  I marinated the Ribeyes all day, turning a couple of times, and cooked the steaks for about 3 minutes on each side.  I let them rest for another 5 minutes before eating and they were delicious.  The meat was tender and juicy - my husband thought that the marinade was better than any store bought recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Steaks were nice and tender, but something about the flavor just wasn't right.  Don't know if it was the beer we used (Michelob).  Marinated for about 6 hours.  Was good, but we won't be making it again.

I am always on the hunt for new ways to cook game meat. This went to the top of the list. Put frozen deer steaks in the marinade for two days giving them a stir every so often.... OMG ... Took them to a potluck BBQ.  They grilled up so well. Moist and tender beyond belief and no gamey taste. Also boiled up the marinade a suggested for an added bonus, but the meat was so good it real didn't need it. Any changes a person might make is because of personal tastes. Want more heat, up the pepper sauce etc, otherwise this is great as is.  If I could give more stars I would have.  Thanks William

This dish was amazing. I made it for my boyfriend and I on Valentine's Day just as the recipe went and used Heineken as my beer. They turned out wonderfully, you could just hint the maple syrup perfectly.

I definitely plan on using this recipe again.

I marinated the steaks overnight and the taste was pretty strong. Instead of enhancing a great steak it ended up turning into more of a teriyaki beef.

Made this twice. Once with grilled pork and again with steak.  Left out the soy sauce the second time and it was excellent.  Too much soy for our taste.

One of the best marinades!  I make this and pit roasted chicken for my dad's 60th B-day party and hardly anyone ate chicken.  Fix more steak than you normally would as this has an excellent not over powering flavor.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

This marinade was ok.  I used it on diced steak for kebabs/skewers.  I found that the marinade retained a bit of a 'raw' taste (yes they were fully cooked!) - the marinade somehow tasted a bit uncooked.  It wasnt awful, just ordinary - I wouldnt use a good cut of meat on this - cheap cuts may be improved - save the rib eye and have it plain!

One of the better marinades for steak I've tried, usually ribeye stands alone no matter what you do with it but this was a tasty change - we both loved it.  I used Stone Pale Ale for the beer.

This was tasty enough.  But, my husband commented that rib eyes on the grill are tasty without such powerful flavors in the marinade.  We love ginger, but we found the ginger flavor here to be too much.  We won't be making thsi one again - at least not with rib eyes.  Maybe with another cut and in a stir fry as suggested.

This was horrible! I never even actually marintated the steaks in it and so glad that I didn't. I made it as suggested and then tasted it and it was so horrible. I honestly would have done better buying a bottle of pre-made marinade. It would have tasted better and cost less.

BEST steak recipe EVER!! I didn't have access to a grill the first time so I just used a pan, the taste was great but when I used a charcoal grill the next time, it was even better!! Thank you William!

This marinade was AWESOME!  I didn't have real maple syrup or mustard powder, so I used the *fake* maple syrup (generic brand at that) and prepared mustard and it was still wonderful.  I let our strip steaks marinate for about 6 hours and they were SO tender and juicy and flavorful. . .even after being cooked on the Foreman Grill!

I highly recommend this marinade and will be using it often.  Thanks for the recipe!  :-)

What an amazing merinade!  Thank you sooo much for posting it on this site. =)  I made it for a couple of my friends and they were all raving about it.  As a matter of fact, they compared it to restaurant style tasting steak.  Thanks for making me look like such a great chef! Appreciate it, Michi in Miami.

baked spaghetti
I did a combination of LaDonna's and Wendy's baked spaghetti last night.  Yes, needed to have more sauce, but combined cream of mushroomsoup and a jar of Baking tomato sauce w/exta water. Also button mushrooms, black olives, 2 lg cloves garlic, onion.  My husband liked the extra richness that the soup gave it,ie.stayed together so it was cut-able and served as a square instead of falling apart! Wonderful rich full flavor! Thanx,guys.

This was good. It had a kind of asian flare.  I think if I make it again, I'll up the maple syrup.  I think it needs a little more sweetness.

First time making steak in about 30 years. Made this recipe for dinner and even after being stuffed people were going back for more. I also cooked the marinade down and added a bit of cornstarch for a dressing over rice. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe will be added to my "keepers" for sure. I made this using 2 thick sirlon steaks with a little extra garlic and some Sriracha. I also added about a teaspoon of prepared Dijon mustard. I made a smaller batch of the marinade that I cooked down to make a glaze, with a couple pats of butter to finish it off. My husband is not overly fond of Steak loved it. He asked me to make later in the week after my grocery store trip.

6-9-17: Very good to excellent, a little sweet; maybe cut out syrup and/or add a dash of honey in lieu of syrup. Also used marinade on asparagus & potatoes but added Montreal Seasoning. Also did for one steak so reduced sauce. Didn't have beer & used real Dijon mustard & as no beer added some EVOO. Topped w butter, covered & let rest 5 min.

Phenomenal.  We had no fresh ginger so used dried.  And prob a bit more maple syrup than was called for.  I hate the smell of sesame oil but stuck it out.  This was stellar on our rib eyes that we grilled.  Looking forward to trying it with fresh ginger - and other meats.

Didn't have any fresh ginger or garlic, so used powder - had to look up conversion for both. Skipped the beer and added extra Cholula. Seasoned 4 NY Strip steaks and tasted wonderful!

I followed it all exsactly and it had a very burnt taste, so what i ended up doing was after having cooked i then re-cooked it but with oil in frying pan. It had a nice taste but the burnt could not get off and so for this i give it a 2/5.I really dont know where i went wrong but i managed to pull it off for the dinner which we were having.

Awesome recipe! I used a little less soy sauce because I wanted to reduce the salt some. The steak was nice and tender and really soaked up the flavour (I marinated overnight). I also boiled the marinade and mixed that with sauteed  mushrooms and onions and served that over the steak. Turned out fantastic. I'll make again for sure.

Well, I didn't have any rib eye steaks, but did have a nice piece of top sirloin (Costco) and have been eyeing this one for some time, so decided to try!  I did cut the recipe in half for our one piece of steak (maybe 12oz or so).  Marinaded for about 8 hours and then as many others have done, boiled the leftover marinade to use on top of the steak and our rice.  So yummy...will make again!

Fantastic!!  I've made it twice now.  The second time I doubled the marinade, because boiling it down afterward makes the BEST steak sauce.....  The steak comes out tender and flavorful.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

I have done many marinades over the years and this one is now my favorite. I used a strong beer Molson's Canadian. I marinated the steaks overnight in a ziploc bag. All the flavors melded together to complement and not overwhelm the sirloin tip steaks. The flavour of the steak was there.  I like spice in my food and depending on my mood I will change it up to 1/2 tsp of hot sauce. All in all delicous.

I really liked the ginger flavor. The marinade seemed very similar to a teriyaki marinade which i didnt think would taste that great with steak, but I was wrong! Made the recipe as is and it will be added to my recipe box. Thank you!

Excellent recipe! I marinated the Rib Eyes for 7 hours and cooked them on the stove. The flavor went all the way through the steak and it was so tender. I changed it a little bit only because I did not have a few of the original ingredients. I used Ground Ginger, Dijonaisse Mustard, and vegetable oil.   My husband and I have found a marinade that we will use over and over and swore off ever buying store bought marinades again. I even shared this recipe with all my Facebook friends! Enjoy:)

Sorry, maybe it's just me and my husband but after marinating for 6 hours I grilled the steaks and they tasted weird. All the flavour of the meat was gone and it just had a plain feeling in my mouth. Did not like it.

I liked this but all I could taste was the sesame oil, maybe cause I didnt do overnight marinading, will try that next time, otherwise good but not great.

Very Taste. I even bought too much meat so froze some in the marinade. when I grilled it about 2 weeks later, it was even more delicious.

Packed a lot of flavor..ingredients for marinade are pricey if you don't have them all on hand (sesame seed oil was over 6$ alone.)  Tasted a lot of soy...didn't care for this too much, but then again everybody's tastes are different...

Terriffic!  The steak turned out fantastic, but more importaintly then the steak, the Marinade is awesome. This marinade will replace my old favorite standby "Basnote" marinade.

Very good!  I doubled the marinade, as I had about four pounds of steaks and marinated the meat for about 6 hours.  It was too cold to grill, so I broiled these for about 20 minutes to medium-well doneness and we really liked them.

Delicious and easy! It was my first time making steak, so I was a little nervous, but it turned out great. I marinated for 3 hours, and followed others' suggestions and reduced the remaining marinade and used it as a sauce. I didn't have mustard seed so I left it out, but my marinade and sauce turned out wonderfully. Highly recommended!

We used honey and dry ginger.  Very good but next time I'll use fresh ginger for an even stronger, fresher flavor and try the maple syrup (didn't have any).

Yum! I used olive oil and left out the beer but it turned out great and I'm not much of a steak fan. We have made it multiple times since we discovered this recipe.

This was excellent.  My in-laws came over for dinner and I made this along with Grilled Marinated Shrimp and Missy's Candied Walnut Gorgonola Salad from this site.  It turned out great!!  I marinated them for about 7 hours and  just used a lite beer that we had on hand.  They were very flavorful and tender.  No steak sauce needed with this marinade!

I made rib eye steaks last night on the grill.  I followed the directions in the recipe with the exception of I used dried ginger.  I marinated the steaks overnight in a Ziploc bag.  Before the steaks were finished grilling I made a combination on Gorgonzola cheese and butter and placed that on the steak and let it melt on the steaks.  These steaks were so tender and so flavorful.  I will definitely use this marinade for my steak grilling.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  Connie

Instead of using steaks I made beef skewers with peppers and mushrooms.  I didn't have any beer on hand so I substituted olive for it. It still turned out great.  Will definitly use beer next time.

This was a delicious recipe - I made as directed, just marinated for 6 hours and used a top sirloin steak (wasn't able to get rib eye). I cooked on an indoor grill, but this recipe will be well used during barbeque season. Thanks for sharing, William.

This was a great marinade.  I forgot the ginger and never have beer, and it still turned out perfect.  I used some olive oil instead of sesame oil.  I didn't poke holes in the steak or cut it to check for doneness because I didn't want to lose any of that great juiciness.  I will definitely try this on fish and chicken too.

Used this for leftover hunk of steak that we diced (uncooked), marinated, cooked and skewered for NYE 2009. They were tasty little guys. would love to try on the grill with real steaks sometime.

OK I think all steaks should have this marinade! I just put all the ingredients in a zip lock bag and flipped over a couple of times while marinating. Perfect!!

This was very good! I didn't have fresh ginger on hand so I used ground ginger instead. I let it marinate for 5 hours and imagine the taste would be even better overnight. Next time I am going to try this on another cut of meat (rib eyes have a tendency to have too much fat). Thank you!

I made this marinade for some new york strips I had left over from a value pack. We wanted a different spin on them since we just had plain steak and mashed potatoes the night before. I halved the recipe, and omitted hesesame oil since I didn't have any on hand. I marinated for about an hour and a half. While the steaks were on the grill i sauteed up some onions and garlic, and then added the leftover marinade, brought to a boil to kill the bacteria, and reduced. Then I added about 1/2 c pineapple juice. I spooned about a tablespoon of the sauce over the steaks and they were perfect. This tasted very much like the asian marinated new york strip from pf changs. Definite must try.

I used the marinade on pork tenderloin instead of the Rib Eye steaks- and it worked out great! I marinated it for about 3 hours which was enough time- but over night would have made it even more flavorful. I switched out the maple syrup and used honey instead. I will use this recipe again!

I was expecting something really special with this marinade- but never got it. I had to alter the recipe; ground ginger instead of fresh, and honey instead of Aunt Jamima. My rib eyes marinated for about 7 hours before I broiled them. I agree that yes, it does produce tender and juicy steaks. The taste was slightly sweet- but that was all I got from it. Luckily, I had some A1 in the house to disguise the 'off' taste.

I make with flank steak and put in ziplock bag, sometimes marinate overnight.  Really tenderizes and keeps the meat very moist.  We have used recipe for several years and get requests for the recipe.

This is a really good recipe! I only changed two things. One, I used sirloin fillets and two, I used ginger powder (1/8 tsp) instead of fresh ginger as I couldn't find any. I pretty much always use steak sauce but I just didn't want to after one bite of this steak! I will definitely make this again.

Made this for my husband for father's day dinner, and it did NOT disappoint!  He LOVED this steak, and did not even reach for the A1 steak sauce on the table!  That's a first for him with steak, and he actually stated it didn't need steak sauce!  I marinated the steaks starting around lunchtime, and they were perfect for the grill by dinnertime.  Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe!

This wasn't quite as sweet as I thought it would be.  I didn't use "real" maple syrup though (I used light Mrs. Butterworth's instead) and I only marinated it for an hour.  Maybe the real syrup and longer marinading time would do the trick!

This was terrific, and I didn't even have all ingredients.  I only had 1/2 Tbsp of jarred ground ginger, and root beer instead of beer... and only marinated for an hour.  I can't wait to try it true to recipe!  Very yummy.

I let this marinate for about 24 hours and it ruined the steak.  It tasted like chinese food cause all you could taste was soy and ginger.  If I make this again I will only marinate the steak for an hour or less and then maybe I can come back and change my rating.

Love this recipe.  I changed it up a bit and threw everything into my crock pot.  I substituted the beer with 1/4 cup Marsala sweet wine and 1/4 cup rice vinegar and used pancake syrup.  Love the taste and the smell.  We will be using this one again.

The flavor was good but I think I will use this to marinade steak tips instead. I like the natural grilled taste of ribeye so I was reluctant to try to do so but the flavors looked good so I tried it. Not bad but for us it will be better served on other cuts of meats.

This recipe was alright, but don't think I'll be making it again. I marinaded overnight & otherwise followed recipe to a tee pretty much. The maple syrup (only thing I did change) which I used Mrs. Butterworth's syrup was little too strong for mine or my boyfriend's taste. Was looking forward to trying this out, maybe it would be better with REAL maple syrup.

I marinated flank steaks in this & they turned out great.  I only had powdered ginger on hand, but fresh would be better.  They marinated for about eight hours, but next time I think I will marinate them overnight.  My company loved it.

The review that follows (submitted by another member) sums up exactly how I feel about this recipe! "A new classic in our home! Tastes better than the 'KEG' steak I just had. Not the usual marinade and it shows!"

This was a wonderful marinade.  I used it with flank steaks, and marinated them overnight.  They turned out so tender and juicy.  I wouldn't use dried ginger...go for fresh, because I think it would really change the recipe.

A great marinade.  I found four good sized round steaks for $4.00 and change and with a $2.00 off coupon--prepared four great steaks for just over $2.00!  And it was all because I marinaded the meat for five hours.  I was generous with the hole punching, and that must have made a difference.  Granted, the cheaper cut of steak meant the chewing was a bit tougher, but with a good marinade such as this one--you are turning a poor cut of meat into a better than average one.  Served the steaks with "Stir Fried Asparagus" from this website, which was also fantastic.

I used this to marinate t-bone steaks and let them marinate for about 24 hrs.  It was good but the flavor was pretty overwhelming - don't think I'll make this marinade again.  Sorry.

This is by far the best marinade recipe I've ever used!  The steaks are great, and our guests are raving.  I've also adjusted the recipe a little to make a good basic stir fry sauce.  You can't go wrong with this one!
