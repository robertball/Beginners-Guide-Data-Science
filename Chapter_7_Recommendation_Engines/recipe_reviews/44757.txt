I love this.  So does my husband.  Try these changes.  3-4 cups carrots, 2-4 TBS chopped crystalized ginger,  tsp of orange zest and tsp of lemon zest,  small can drained pineapple tidbits and some cinnamon to taste.  I bake in 8" square pan.  Bake for about 25 minutes or a bit longer if needed.  

What I really appreciate is the low calorie count even with the pineapple addition.  I do think that this recipe should be reclassifiend under snacks!

This isn't a side dish.  It's more of a quick bread.  I thought it was only okay, but my six year old vegetable-away liked it a lot.  The four year old didn't.  'Can't like the same things - ever!  :D Update (Years later.  That six year old is now fourteen!  :O  :D) I tried it again omitting the lemon juice, adding half teaspoon vanilla extract & half teaspoon cinnamon.  It was closer to two & a half cups shredded carrots, too.  I baked for about half an hour on three fifty, greasing & flouring an eight by eight.  I could taste that little bit of cinnamon, which wasn't bad, but I think I'd like a more subtle taste.  No, it didn't scream "cinnamon," but if you're thinking of adding, I wouldn't add more than half teaspoon (especially considering the low sugar amount.  'Could easily become bitter.)  Oh, used smart balance olive oil/butter blend.  No problem with dryness - either time.  Fourteen year old still likes it, but not that there are carrots in it.  :)  It is a vegetable, ya know!  :D  Prep note:  If your carrots aren't pretty, peel 'em.  Mine weren't & dark spots from the peel showed up the next day.

Awesome recipe!  I didn't know what to expect but I was blown away by the taste.  I made it into 6 large muffins instead of a ring so I can freeze them.  I added a little more carrots (2.5-3 cups or 3 large carrots, shredded).  And I put in about a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  So good!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Great! i was looking for a side dish but got something much better it almost tasted like carrot cake i sprinkled the top with powdered sugar and made a salad for the veggie, my girlfriends daughter who is 5 really liked it so did both of my boys 15 & 16 they never eat their vegetables this is a good to sneak it in...... Thanks for a great reecipe.

My mother used to make a couple versions of this, in fact it is included in "Thoughts for Buffet" printed in 1958.  Only that version calls for 1 cup shortening which i converted to one cup softened butter, but that is a lot of butter...i will try reducing it per the proportions in this version.  It also used cake flour (1-1/2 cups), and included 1 tsp cinnamon and a half tsp nutmeg, and no salt, 1-1/2 cups carrot, 2 Tb lemonjuice, 1Tb lemon rind, and same amnts eggs and baking powder and baking soda as this recipe. My mother taught me to bake it with the mold sitting in a pot of water. I dont have a metal mold but a bundt pan worked perfectly.

I used a pan which made individual leaf shaped breads, about dinner roll size.  They were very tasty as a 'dinner roll' and very decorative with the leaf shapes.  It is a fun alternative to regular rolls and takes so much less time because it does not require yeast.

I didn't have any dinner buns so this recipe was perfect. The only thing I changed was by adding cinnamon.

This recipe made great muffins! I added 1/2 tsp. of allspice, 1 tsp. of cinnamon they're wonderful - I lowered the oven temperature a bit to make sure they were cooked through without burning the bottoms.

I don't know what catagory to put this under either. More like a bread than side dish. It came out rather dense and it needs something. Don't know what yet. Tastes almost like pumpkin pie.

This was disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly (unusual for me) but it came out bland, dense and flat.

This has become a family favorate.  It has become a Thanksgiving staple.  I didn't need to change any of the ingredients or directions, which I usually have to adjust or tweak a little.e

Real easy. Tasted yummy. Great way to get kids to eat carrots. I made a powder sugar glaze for a topping and served it as  a snack.
