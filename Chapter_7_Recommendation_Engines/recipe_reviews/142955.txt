Yum - what a fun summer cookie!  I baked these on wax paper-covered cookie sheets to prevent sticking and to make for an easy cleanup.  I had to make a few changes to get these just right, and they turned out delicious.  I had to add about 1/4 cup of additional flour because the dough was rather runny.  I also mixed in 1 cup of chocolate chips (who doesn't like chocolate-covered strawberries?!).  I would also recommend refrigerating the dough for a bit to make for a fluffier, nicer-looking cookie.  Very good, and I will be making these again soon.  Thanks, Brittany!

I used 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking powder, light brown sugar, 1 cup mini chocolate chips and just a little over 1 cup oats. I also put all the cut strawberries on paper towels to absorb some of the moisture out - used all other ingredients as mentioned. It was not runny at all. I added some pearl sugar on top and baked 8 - 10 minutes - AND SCRUMPCIOUS!

I took one of the advice posted and added more flour and rolled oats.  It came out great!  I also only used whole-wheat flour and brown sugar.  I made them pretty big and they didn't spread out so I had to cook them extra long.  I baked them for 20 mins and they came out great.
Healthy and yummy!

I thought it would be fun and tasty to make cookies with fresh strawberries.  Took them to a BBQ at the bosses house.  Wow, how embarrassing.  I'm known amongst friends for being good at baking.  I should not have brought these mushy cookies,  the strawberries themselves tasted good, but the rest of the cookie was such an unpleasant texture.  Very, very disappointing.

It was pretty good, but the listed cooking time was too low and my beutiful work turned into floppy cookies! Add a couple more minutes and they will be PERFECT!

I did not care for this recipe at all. I should have read the other reviews before making it. Recipe came out soupy and I baked them anyway and they came out flat. Added more flour, baking soda, cinnamon and oats.

This was a great use of extra fresh strawberries! I have a customer at work who brings me baskets of strawberries from her farm almost weekly, and wanted to make something I could bring in for my coworkers. I loved how they turned out! I read in a bunch of other reviews to add up to 1 cup extra four, so I rounded up to 2 cups total and figured I would add more at the end if needed, and I'm so glad I didn't do a whole cup extra! It was so thick I called my husband in to help me mix it after I added the berries. The lid to my cinnamon container came off, so I got a little more than 1tsp, but I liked it anyways, because you could really taste the cinnamon. They turned out amazing, and the fresh berry taste was GREAT!

These cam out wonderful.  I had fresh frozen strawberries.  I used old fashioned rolled oats.  I did not have quick oats.  They are chewy crispy goodness.

I found these cookies to be terrible, even after I applied a couple of the hints listed in the other reviews. I had to add so much flour that they ended up tasting like flour, not strawberries. I would not recommend making these cookies!

Definitely had to add 1 cup extra flour and added 1 tsp of baking powder.  I used a larger cookie scoop and only yielded 30 cookies, but baked them for 12-14 minutes.  They are very cakey, but had a great taste.

They're ok.  Mine ended up with a cake-like texture, which I typically like in a cookie.  I have done a lot of baking, so I did take it upon myself to "tweak" the recipe as other reviewers were suggesting.  I used 2 1/4 cups flour instead of 1 1/2 cups, I added 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t baking powder and eliminated the 1/4 cup milk (thinking that's why people were getting the "runny" consistency... I thought the milk was a little odd in there).  I added 1/2 cup  chocolate chips at the end too. I just realized that I missed that last 1/4 cup sugar when I wrote down the recipe, so I added some to the batter that I haven't cooked yet and I'm sure that'll make a difference in the flavor. Not sure I can even fairly rate them since I switched up the recipe so much though... ;o|

This recipe was challenging, Following the recipe as is, the mix came out runny. So I added a little more flour a little more oats, as suggested. I also put my strawberries on a paper towel to dry them a tad. The recipe that came of this was hard to cook, the edges would turn brown around ten minutes but the centers would be undercooked. With that being said I had about 10 that came out alright, but were more cake-y than cookie

Unfortunately, I was not impressed. The flavor was great, however, even with taking suggestions by other reviewers into consideration, the cookies still didn't turn out all that well. I think they can definitely do without the milk. I upped the flour to 2 cups, and the oats to 1 1/2 cups. They held together while baking, but they are just extremely moist. I also increased cook time to 11 minutes, which helped without burning the cookies. The flavors are definitely there! I just need to do a bit of tweaking...

I added chocolate chips to them and about a 1/2 cup extra flour because the strawberries made it watery. They did however turn out very good and I would definitely make them again.

What a DISASTER! There is no way this recipe will work with ripe strawberries. The amount of juice that they produce makes a very runny, unusable batter.

My fix: an extra 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal and another cup of flour. Then I put them in a 13x9 pan like quick bread. 

In theory, you could forgo the milk, and only add a bit more oatmeal and flour, or drain your strawberries before adding them to your batter. 

I gave this 2 stars based just on the fact that even though it's a disaster waiting to happen, the taste is actually quite nice.

I had great success with frozen strawberries, honey instead of white sugar, and a handful of dark chocolate chips thrown in. Also -- be liberal with the baking soda! It makes for a lighter cookie. (I think I used 1.5 teaspoons)

These cookies aren't very good.  First, I did not need to add the 1/4 cup of milk & I added a 1/2 cup of flour because the dough was too wet.  I had to bake them for 12 minutes & they are soft cookies - almost cake-like.  It almost seemed like quick bread batter.  In addition to the batter being too wet, the cookies just aren't very tasty.  I will not be making these again.  All you taste is cinnamon - not strawberry.  I think I would leave out the cinnamon & add a teaspoon of almond extract instead of vanilla.  I also added a half bag of mini chocolate chips & they are still bland cookies.

I would not recommend these. I added more flour and oatmeal, that seem to help with the runny batter. The cookies were nice and crisp just out of the oven. I did find that they got so soggy after a day you couldn't pick them up let alone eat them.

Tastes like strawberry oatmeal.  Only okay taste.  May need to modify dry ingredients before making again.

I had many of the same problems as other reviewers. Dough was very runny, even after adding extra flour and oats.  I baked them anyway, and they turned out sort of cake-like, which was kind of strange. I only baked half of the recipe because they looked funny, but those cookies disappeared fast, despite the weird texture! Also, the dough was DELICIOUS! I probably ate a dozen cookies worth of cookie dough while making these...I decided to save the rest of the cookie dough to put on ice cream. Soo yummy!

the advice about adding more flour/oats etc is good but make sure you add it once you know how thin the batter will be.  I added an extra cup of flour and more oats and mine was too dry :( other than that great! i used frozen mixed berries and thawed them and also added choc chips. YUM!

They did not cook very well.  We ended up adding a little extra flour as per the other reviews.  

Once they cooled we actually put them BACK IN the oven for about 7 minutes.  It helped.  

They were edible but we wouldn't make them again.

Adding the 1/4 c. sugar to the strawberries ruined the cookies. Way too much liquid. Ended up making muffins with the batter. Do not sugar the strawberries and see if that works!

I thought the recipe worked very well - I used exactly the amounts of ingredients stated in it, and the mixture was not runny, and everything was ok. The only thing I would say is that it had too much sugar, but that's just a matter of taste. It took my cookies longer than 8 mins to bake - about 10-12. In general, nice recipe

This recipe was a waste of ingredients!
I followed the directions to the letter, but the cookies didn't turn out anything like the picture on this site. When I spooned the dough onto the cookie sheet they looked ok, but as they baked they "melted" into flat gooey things that ran into each other! I ended up more than doubling the baking time & they remained gooey! I even stuck them into the fridge thinking that they would set up better.... NOPE!
I'm throwing this recipe into the trash!!!

I whipped these up for my kids with some strawberries that were needing to be used. Delish. I did add the extra 1/2 cup of flower and I drained the strawberries after they sat in sugar so the liquid wouldn't mess with my dough. Came out with beautiful plump cookies. I also used half the brown and white sugar since they are for my kids.

This recipe is very similar to the recipe on the underside of the lid of the oatmeal box, except this one calls for 1 cup of oats and the lid calls for 3 cups of oats. As written it is a very soft dough, next time I will use 3 cups of oats and omit the milk. 
What I did do this time is let the chopped berries sit on a paper towel, as someone had previously suggested, and rather than 'sugar' the berries, I combined all the white sugar with the brown sugar and the butter.
These cookies taste great but the texture is too soft for me.

My husband is diabetic so I used Splenda granulated for the sugar. I did use regular brand sugar and may try Splenda brown sugar blend next time. They turned out good. I did cook them 10 minutes. I think next time I will add pecans also

I wasn't too happy with the results of this recipe, I should also have read the reviews before making and don't think I would repeat the experiment!  Much too runny, with the result that the cookies broke apart after baking (even after adding longer baking time).  I added white chocolate chips which gave good flavor with the strawberries and oats but the finished product was very disappointing.....

This is a very good recipe, I took the advice of other reviews and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and a bit more oatmeal other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Yes it's a bit sticky, yes it's very cakey but I believe it's supposed to be. Thank you for share as it's difficult to find a strawberry cookie recipe that is quick and easy to do

I halfed this recipe because I didn't have enough straawberries for a full batch.  They were OK.  I have to use margarine and soy milk, so that probably changes things a bit.  So many other reviews talked of them being too runny?  Mine are almost too dry, so I don't know what went wrong.  I enjoyed the cookies, they seem "healthy" with the oats.  This is a creativ base recipe to use up strawberries.  Thanks for posting!

I added three cups frozen strawberries, microwaved them for 1 min to get the chill out, ruff chopped, added 1/4 more flour, blended the oats to a fine powder, added dark chocolate chunks, substituted the butter for banana, substituted the sugar with raw honey, substituted the milk with coconut milk. Cookies turned out amazing. 
My friend made the same recipe but used crisco instead of butter or egg and she used all oats blended,  no flour and had amazing results as well.

This recipe is amzing though I added a tad bit more flour. They didnt turn out to be the cookies on the screen but they were flat yet " don't judge a book by it's cover." My parents loved it and my sister too. The only thing is takes awhile to make far longer than 28 minutes!!!!!

They have a great taste...But i am very disappointed. I just baked this today, for my friend's birthday. My cookies A. didn't turn out like the picture, B. they wouldn't come off the wax paper,  i had to scrape them off the ungreased cookie sheet and they were way too soft in the middle and just fell apart. I used up the entire batch and it was all like this. I don't know if i did something wrong, i followed the recipe to exact measurements...and it just turned out trashy, and i don't want to give my best friend skanky looking cookies. I should have went with a basic sugar cookie.

I added a 1/2 cup more flour because they were so runny and baked them between 8-10 minutes and they were better than the original recipe but still don't know if I'd make them again. Good flavor just very runny mixture.

The cookies were yummy! Mine turned out really soft though, almost cookie-dough soft. Any solutions? I substituted the oatmeal with wheat (my friend didn't like oatmeal).

I can't stop eating these! Good thing they are healthy. I made them even more so by using whole wheat flour, stone ground oats, and less butter- 6tbs. rather than 8. I was out of cinnamon so added a few dashes of clove and nutmeg. They turned out GREAT!

I needed to add some more flour.  They were interesting, almost tasted like a breakfast cookie.  My daughter is always talking about adding strawberries to cookies, so I thought we would give this recipe a try.
