this recipe needs a little work.
I added 2 x's the tahini and 2 tbs of sour crean because it was so thin.  I also added some shallots and used a full fire rosted bell pepper.  It was not good right off the stove but the next day after the flavors had a chance to marry  it was nice.  I would add some red pepper flakes next time.

This soup is really yummy, but the recipe as is tastes like hummus.  I added red pepper flakes, curry powder, cumin, and lime juice to taste which gave it a great kick.

I loved this soup! High protein, high fiber, only 3 Weight Watchers points for a cup-and filling too!

I LOVE this soup.  Great for a vegan diet (sub vegetable broth for chicken broth).  High in protein and delicious.  First found it at Weight Watchers years ago and lost it.  Have been looking for it ever since.  Thank you for posting it!
