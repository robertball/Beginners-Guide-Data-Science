I have used several very good recipes from allrecipes.com but never felt compelled to write a review until this recipe.  I made it for the birthday of a friend whose favorite cake-type desert is pound cake.  She thought it was the best she has ever had.  I would have to agree.  I used 1/2 tsp almond, 1/2 tsp lemon, and 1 tsp vanilla.  The flavor was perfect, as was everything about the cake.  I looked at all the popular pound cake recipes, and I'm glad I chose this one.  Won't ever look for another one.  Btw, it took around 50-55 minutes in my oven, and it was not underdone at all.

Absolutely delicious cake! I didnt have butter flavoring so substituted lemon extract. Also, I used 1/2 cup of the sugar to whip the egg whites into firm peaks. The folding of the egg white mix into the batter is what gives this cake the fabulous texture. Thanks for the recipe Bonny!

Sour Cream Poundcakes have been the only kind my family has eaten for generations.  After making this recipe I think I will have to convince my family to switch.  It is wonderful!  **I used vanilla extract instead of butter and it was perfect.  Recipe can also be cut in half and baked in a loaf pan (I used 9x4).

Wow! Awesome!  I baked it exactly one hour. It could have used about 5-10 minutes extra because the bottom was not quite done, but it was close enough. The cake was DELICIOUSLY moist, the texture was awesome! I topped it with some homemade glaze...just used powdered sugar, milk, melted butter, and vanilla.  Oh, and I think the trick to not burning the outside before it's done is to put your oven rack directly in the middle of your oven. That worked for me anyway. The cake was beautiful, tasted awesome, and impressed the inlaws as well as my pound cake-phobic hubby.:-) He's not usually a fan of them, but enjoyed this cake.

I served this, with a couple modifications, instead of wedding cake at my wedding reception a couple months ago. I replaced the butter flavored extract with 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon lemon extract. I used mini-bundt pans (I put the batter in a freezer bag and then cut off a corner to get the batter into the pans), so each batch had to bake for only 20 minutes. To serve, we topped each fabulous little cake with strawberries and whipped cream. Our guests loved them, some referred to them as "doughnuts," and more than a few asked for the recipe. Thank you for the recipe and reviewer's comments!

This is the best pound cake I have ever made. It is so moist. I use vanilla extract instead of butter. Any body can make this cake. It's wondeful.

I have had great luck with this recipe. It receives rave reviews everytime I make it. It's great plain or with fruit. The cake stays very moist in the center. And it freezes beautifully.

This cake was perfect. Only thing I changed was I used butter nut extract instead of butter extract. My husband and kids ate it all in 2 days...my son cried because his brother got the last piece. So I will have to make this again and again. 
**I did have to cook it longer than stated..just use toothpick test**

This did not turn out for me for some reason-the inside was mushy and the top burnt.  I must have done something wrong...

When I baked it the smell was amazing and I nibbled on some crust when it was done to get a taste it was really good as well. But when we ate it later on after it had cooled it wasn't very good. It tasted plain and floury. I was dissapointed.

I did not have any butter flavor so I used almond extract in its place.  I also added the zest and juice of two lemons.  I then topped with icing that had zest and juice from a lemon.  Even though I only had 5 eggs it turn out yummy!

I made this cake a few weeks ago just to try it out, as I had read a bunch of good reviews on it. It was AMAZING. I've made pound cakes before, but this one is absolutely wonderful. The only problems I had with it was that the egg whites didn't form stiff peaks, so the next time I'll probably use some of the sugar with them. I also took it out of the pan too soon, so I would reccommend letting it cool for a while before doing that. Also, it took me an hour and 25 minutes instead of the one hour baking time. And I didn't have the butter extract, so I used vanilla and almond, and it turned out perfectly. I have friends already requestion that I make it again. I would definately recommend it.

The cake was nice and moist and dense.  Seemed to have a crunchy sugary "crust" develop...which was not what i expected.  The cake too about 2hrs too bake through...not sure why.

Great recipe. It is a pain to fold the egg whites in at the end, but a great cake. I put a ring of raspberries in after putting 1/2 the batter in and covered it with the remaining. This was great b/c it cut the sweetness. This cake did have to cook a little longer than recipe stated. I sliced up the leftovers and froze them. Reheat 350 for a few min and serve w/ ice cream for a great treat anytime!

This was the BEST cream cheese pound cake I ever made.  The moistness of the cake was wonderful.  I had to let it cook longer for 15-20 min.  DO NOT cook this cake at night.  My children especially enjoyed the wonderful cake  I will make this again

I split the batter between two 9x4 loaf pans.  The amount of batter was perfect. However, like a lot of other reviewers, I had a hard time getting the center cooked without completely burning the crust. After 1h, the crust was already really dark, but a toothpick was still coming out pretty wet.  After another 15 minutes, I turned down the oven temp, hoping that would keep the outside from getting much worse.  I ended up having to cut off the ends before I served it because they were so burnt.

That said, the flavor was really great.  I used 1.5 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp butter flavor, 1/2 tsp almond extract. My (very large extended) family really enjoyed the pound cake, though I saw many people cutting off the burnt edges.  Next time, I may try cooking at a lower temperature and/or wrapping the pans in foil to minimize the burnt outside.  

Lastly, I did mix about 1/4 cup of sugar with the egg whites (after they got foamy).  It was a bit tricky to fold them into the thick batter, but doable with a spatula or large plastic spoon.  The cakes did rise as much as I would expect, filling the loaf pans.

I was not thrilled with this cake and neither was my family.  The flavor was a little off  though it was certainly rich.  I do not think I'll be making this one again.

This Cake receives rave reviews everytime I bake it!  I've made it many times in about 4 years (I think).  I substitute the butter extract with vanilla and lemon from time to time. I also don't separte the yolks from the white and it turns out great.  I leave it in the oven about an 1 hr and 10 minutes just to be on the safe side. Wonderful recipe and will continue to make for years to come!

Absolutely scrumptious! I added 1 tsp. of almond extract and a half tsp. each of butter and vanilla flavorings in place of the two tsp. butter flavoring, and the cake turned out terrific! It had just the right amount of sweetness and a great texture.

I made this cake for our family Easter dinner, and everyone loved it.  Very moist and very gone.  After everyone finished desert, they got their to-go bags out and wrapped up the remaining cake to take home.  A definite keeper.

I will say first off that this cake is delicious, even though cooking it was a bit amusing for me.  I made some modifications that others used, almond extract and vanilla, and followed the recipe very carefully.  I cooked it 1 hour in a bundt pan and checked it with a toothpick... next time I will use a whole knife as when I flipped it over, batter flowed out profusely!!  I plopped it back in and baked some more.  Took about 1 1/2 hours and still wasn't quite done.  We ate it anyway.  It was yummy:)

This is an excellent pound cake.  I used to bake the 7-up cake a lot, but this one beats it hands down!!  I love it because I always have the ingredients on hand.  I don't have to go out an buy 7-up.

This pound cake is Awesome!!! I read the reviews and made these changes... reduced the sugar to 3 cups and I like vanilla so I used 2 capfuls, I didn't sift the dry ingredients, all butter and cheese and also eggs were room temperture.I did beat the egg whites with a little sugar,folded them in with the mixer and beat the mixture some more and baked in a bundt pan for 1hr25 mins.The cake turned out light and also dense with a wonderful crust that isn't too hard nor too soft.I will make this pound cake again and again.It is perfect!!!

The best pound cake I ever had. Dense, moist and very flavorful.  I used lemon extract, SF pudding mix and light sour cream because that's all I had and it was plenty rich enough!!!  I had to cook it at least 15 minutes longer because toothpick was very wet.  It didnt' burn though.  Also, I shouldn't have trusted hubby to grease the pan and promise to take it out of the pan after I went to bed.  In the morning I broke it into pieces trying to get it out.  Still delicous though, just glad it wasn't for company!!!!

I made this pound cake late one nite for church the next day and let it over cook, because I fell asleep.  They still loved it and there was not one piece left to bring home!  It was great!!!!!!  

I used 2 tsps of vanilla and added an extra 1/4 of butter.  My egg whites did not peak as they were supposed to (my fault too tired to clean beaters), but the cake was still DA BOMB!  My husband has already requeted another one!  I served it stand alone as well!  Yummy!!!!

I chose this recipe because the picture by Erica looked so darn good.  I wasn't disappointed.  The cake turned out beautifully.  I added 1 tsp of almond extract along with the butter extract (because it's just traditional in my family) and everyone said it was better than my usual pound cake recipe.  I didn't taste it (dieting!) but I sliced it and boy, did it look good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Thanks Bonny for sharing the perfect cheese cake pound cake recipe.  As of today I've prepared this cake three times and it's the only cake I will make in my home.  I alternate the extract flavors between butter, vanilla, & butter depending on what's in the pantry.  I wish I could eat it 24 hrs a day without gaining a pound, it so, so, so, GOOD!

Yummy! I used only 1 cup of butter, 3 cups of sugar and 6 eggs to make it a bit healthier.  It probably made the pound cake less fluffy but it was still delicious!

I baked this last night and it turned out sooooo goood!  This was my first time to bake a lb. cake.  This recipe was easy to make.  The cake is very moist and reading the other reviews helped me to cook it longer b/c it wasn't done in an hour.  Thanks.

tried this and it was great - i didnt have any butter extract so i used almond extract and vanila - the substitution was very good - it was very moist and tasty - used a wilton #502-1208 loaf pan with flour and crisco in it and it just fell out after cutting the sides - also had to leave it in for almost 20 extra minutes - either way it was great - thank you

This Pound cake was so good. Every one loved it and wanted more. It was a little more trouble than average but well worth it. I made it with Almond instead of butter estract.The almond was great and I am sure the lemon would be wonderful too.

Wow!  I've made this pound cake several times now and everyone raves and wants the recipe.  I always make it the day before I need it because it even tastes better when all the flavors have had time to meet.  Very moist.

I thought this cake tasted awsome after I altered it to me and my family's liking. First thing I did was decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, the eggs to 6 and the butter extract to 1tsp. plus added 1 tsp of lemon extract and 2 tsp. of vanilla extract. And as I said before it was awsome. For some reason though it got a little too brown on the bottom when I flipped it out of the pan. Don't know why, but the next time I'm trying loaf pans to see if that makes a difference. Once you cut off the burnt sides it was awsome, especially with a big glass of milk. It was very moist also and makes a good bit. This recipes a keeper for me! Thnks for submitting it Bonny!

This was my first time in baking a pound cake and this one turned out wonderful. Very moist and just delicious. My whole family loves it. I've made it three times now. It comes out the same every time. I brought some to work and everyone loved it there too. I plan to use this recipe for my gift giving at Christmas.

This cake was not exactly the easiest I have ever made, what with separating seven eggs and whipping the whites, but BOY WAS IT WORTH IT!  This cake was sweet, and oh-so-moist.  Since I used butter in the recipe I didn't put the extra butter flavoring.  Instead, a Tablespoon of vanilla made it perfect!

Perfect for my first pound cake!! Very moist, sweet dark crust on outside. Note: I had to leave it in the over about 20 minutes longer than suggested. Good to cut into slices, wrap and freeze. They can be pulled out and microwaved briefly for a wonderful quick dessert!

I made this last night. I have been using my mom's 30+ years recipe and decided to try something different. I would have to say this is very good and rich. My mom's pound cake recipe is dense but this cake is moist and rich. I did followed the instructiosn but only made few errors, I used three sticks of butter instead a one and 1/4 cup butter. Instead two teaspoons butter flavored, used one tsp butter flavored and 1 tsp orange juice. I didnt have lemon flavored in the cabinet. Reason for that is to balance and not overpower the cake becuase of the extra 1/4 butter additional to the cake batter. Also I use cake flour instead all purpose flour. I cut a slice of cake after 9pm last night. i couldnt help it it was so delicious..yummy. I'll make it again. I dont want to hurt my mommy's feelings on her recipe. hahaha

You don't really need another rating, but this was fantastic.  I have never made a cake that was this moist.  I added a little almond extract with the butter extract.  Very good.  Thank you JOEBON

Very tasty and moist. I used 3 sticks of butter and vanilla extract instead of butter extract. I also used 3 cups of sugar instead of 3 1/2 and the cake was very sweet. 

The batter was VERY thick. I found it quite difficult to fold in the egg whites. By the time I got them in, I'm not sure that it was worth it. Surely the air in the whites was gone and added no benefit to the cake. Once the cake came out of the oven, I didn't find it to be very big or to have risen very much. So, I guess I have some work to do on this one. Has anyone else experienced this with this recipe?

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I am making a three tiered wedding cake this Sept, so I have been busy practicing with this recipe. To spice it up for my family, I used Almond Extract and 2 tablespoons of Poppy seeds.. that was to die for. only problem I have is that it likes to get really dark on the bottom. Will try a couple of things to see if we can eliminate the darkness. Great recipe.

I made this cake for my neighbors retirement party.  It was delicious and moist.  I used 3 sticks of butter, decreased the sugar to 3 cups and used vanilla extract instead of butter. I will definitely prepare again. I will use two extracts next time for even more flavor.

I cut the recipe down to 9 instead of 12. I only had 3/4 of a package of cream cheese. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. I baked the pound cake 8 minutes longer than suggested in the recipe. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used a spring form pan. I cut half of it into pieces, and after reading that the cake freezes well, I placed the rest of it in the freezer. We'll see how it is later on. This was my first time making a pound cake, and it turned out great!

I made this cake and gave it to my hairdresser as a thank you gift. Two other stylist in the shop tasted it and now they're paying me to make them cakes! I've been looking for a good pound cake recipe and my search is over! This is THE BEST tasting pound cake I have ever made. I think adding the egg whites is what makes this cake. I like old fashioned pound cakes and this is it! The texture is great, the taste is awesome!

I rarely write a review but this recipe is really great and deserves recognition.I have made it several times and have modified it with various flavorings but the flavor that gets the most compliments is the butter flavor. I have also used butter flavor Crisco to substiture part of the butter. This is a great recipe!!!!

This is the best pound cake recipe I have ever tasted!  Once when I made it I thought it needed a little longer in the oven, so I turned the oven off and meant to come back in ten minutes, but forgot and got back to it a half an hour later and it was still the moistest, most delicious pound cake I've ever eaten (except this recipe baked the proper length of time).

I'd give it more than 4 stars if I could!

This was really moist.  It seemed to be missing something, though.  I think the problem was that I used unsalted butter.  A little more salt (i.e. the amount found in salted butter) would have made a more flavorful cake.

This cake is absolutely delicious. I used lemon extract and it turned out fabulous. I also had to bake it a little longer than an hour to make sure that it was done all the way. This recipe is defintely going in the recipe box.

My 1st pound cake!  It turned out crunchy on the bottom and so nice and moist inside.  My 4 year old never eats all of her store bought cake -- she asked for 3rds!!!  I have to make myself not have another piece.  I am SO PROUD!  Thanks for a fantastic and well written recipe.  I'm ready to make another one!

my cake nearly overflowed in the oven it was so fluffy!  the outside almost looked burnt by the time the inside was done, but it was SUPER MOIST & we liked the crunchy crust.  this replaces my betty crocker standard just because of how moist it is!  the taste isn't much different than most pound cakes, but the moisture difference was extreme & well worth the recipe!

Fantastic pound cake. I've made twice in the last three weeks. Once just to serve with strawberries and the next time in a trifle recipe. It tastes just like the Sara Lee pound cakes my mom would buy as a kid...but homemade! I didn't use butter flavoring, just one tsp of vanilla extract and a half tsp of almond. Very good and I may try more variations with lemon and poppyseeds or blueberries.

Took almost two hours to bake in the center by which time the crust was about half an inch thick all around and the rest of the cake was very dry.

This recipe did not turn out well for me at all. At 1 hour of baking he cake was very brown but was not done at all. I put it back in the oven for 30 mins and the outside was extremely dark but some parts of the cake were still not cooked when I cut it. I tasted part tha was done and it was extremely sweet!  Not a good recipe for me.

Delicious delicious delicious!  My husband says this is the BEST pound cake he's ever had.  Very yummy, moist, dense, all that it's supposed to be.  I took 'bamacook's' suggestions for the extracts only.  I threw a little lemon glaze on top and that set it off.  I was so impressed with this cake.  Thanks for the best pound cake recipe.

Great tasting cake and easy enough recipe, but mine just would not get done. I baked it for and hour and a half and still wasn't done. By then it was a total flop. I knew seeing the amount of batter this recipe made I would have trouble getting it done. I should have baked it in loaf pans instead of a bundt pan and I'm sure then it would have been fine.

I have made this recipe the past five years. Usually the middle takes awhile to firm up, but is well worth the extra cooking time. This year I used 3 cups of sifted cake flour in place of all purpose and it cooked faster than ever before, plus the texture was amazing.

This was my first time making a pound cake and I was very impressed with the way it came out. It was very moist and smooth inside, one thing I did do was add 4tbspoons of coconut milk in it and that gave it more flavor. I love this and will be making it again.

For flavorings, did 1T of each vanilla and butter flavor and 1/2 t. Almond. Backed sugar to 3 c. Mixing 1/2 c of the 3c with the egg whites. Used 3 sticks of butter. Wrapped outside of bundt pan in foil, baked for 90 min. It was perfect.

I tried this recipe out a couple of months ago and it's the best pound cake that I have had in a long time. The only problem I have is that the cake seems to bust at the top all the time. I had to adjust the temperature from 350 degrees to 325 degrees and I still have the same issue. Unfortunately, this causes the cake to be undone. But, the rest of the cake will be completely done until you reach the part where the cake busted open. I have tried a few different things and nothings has really helped me out. If anyone has a solution I would really appreciate it.

I love this recipe!  It's so simple, and so good!  I have been making it for 5 years now for our family Easter lamb cake.  I get two lambs from one recipe.  It cooks so beautifully, and tastes great with frosting on it!  It's such a hit with our family and neighbors!

This cake is very good. I made it as a test for my wedding cake, but it is very sweet! I made the mistake of not reading the recipe before I made the cake. I failed to notice that the recipe calls for more sugar than flour! That being said, the texture is great. It is fine alone or with fruit, but it is far too sweet with icing.

This cake takes some effort but it is well worth it.  I have made it several times and have never been disappointed.  I usually cut the sugar down to 3 cups and take 1/4 cup out of this to beat with the egg whites.  I add butter nut and vanilla flavoring and a sprinkle of mace for added extra flavor.  The recipe calls for a bunt pan, I'm able to make a small loaf cake out of the batter as well. This has become one of my most requested recipes.

Excellent flavor!  A little eggy, and VERY sweet, but it tasted great. I made a pink castle cake with it for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it!  Next time I will try cutting back the sugar by 1/2 cup.

Wonderful, relatively easy, recipe! My father-in-law LOVES pound cake, so I made this for his birthday. It was a huge hit, and has been requested quite a few times since. Thank you for this gem!
