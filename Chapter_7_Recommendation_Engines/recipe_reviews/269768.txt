I made it with cod. It was very tasty and easy to put together.

This is delicious. Made the recipe almost exactly as written. I added a yellow pepper (I like them and had one on hand). And I was a little short on lemon juice so I zested the lemon and added it to the soup. I used cod as the fish. I would definitely make this again.
