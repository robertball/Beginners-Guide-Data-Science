These were the absolute worst cookies that I ever made. They ran all over the pan. I made two batches & threw them & the mix away. I ended up going with the recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag.(much better):)

The picture of the flat cookies is spot on. The cookies were less than a half of a centimeter thick and ran to be literally three times the size I intended. Despite a non-stick pan, PLUS cooking spray, the cookies were still impossible to get off the pan in one piece. I would highly recommend you to not even try this recipe...

This cookie recipe REALLY messed up for me... it always got stuck to the cookie sheet even if I greased it. I would not recommend this for anybody... they came out super thin and ruined just like the picture or maybe even worse!! Never pick this recipe over any other!

This was not too good of a recipe. It ran all over my pan and I had to scrape the pan for almost 10 minutes to get them off. It covered one of my pans completely and only cooked half of it.

Too much sugar made these cookies too thin and brittle.  Try reducing brown sugar by one half cup.

They taste good but they are kinda liquidy. I made one batch and found that they get paper thin and run over the pan. I added 3/4 cups of flour and it turned out better. Made actual cookies instead of one  huge thin one.

My new favourite cookies! I have made them several times, and will admit that they do not always turn out perfect. I usually add about 1/3-1/2c extra flour, or until the batter is a good consistency. I bake them on baking paper, and make sure there is plenty of space between the cookies (as the batter melts out A LOT). I usually drop about 1tbsp per cookie. The first time I made them, they came out so perfectly round my mum couldn't believe they weren't store bought.

Awful, just awful. The batter was runnier than I thought it was going to turn out. I read the reviews before I made these cookies, I didn't think I needed to add more flour, so I didn't. The batter went everywhere, on my clothes, arms, it stucking to the bowl, I don't even want to talk about it. I NEVER want to make these EVER again.

Horrible Recipe!!! I followed this recipe exact and the dough was sticky. I cooked only three cookies because I had a feeling they were not going to be right. Sure enough they ran together. I had to add in another 3/4 c flour to try and repair this recipe!!!

I consider myself a very good baker.  However, I have to agree with the reviewers that said this is one of the worst chocolate chip recipes.  You definitely need 3 cups of flour for this one to work out without running all over the tray.  I was very disappointed in the recipe.  I think someone got the amount of flour wrong for the ratio in this one.

This recipe didn't work for me. I more than DOUBLED the flour and the batter was still too thin. I added so much flour for some consistency, the batter was white!! I like thicker cookies, these were more like chocolate chip baked pancakes.

There's a lot of sugar so I did 1/2c of each then added some coconut. I also added a cup of oats, they were still a little flat but the oatmeal added a great texture to them.

GREAT RECIPE TO TAKE VEGAN! This was my first vegan and soy free cooking experience, and it went really well! I replaced the butter with Olivio brand margarine, and used semi sweet bakers squares of chocolate (which have soy lecithin as one of the last ingredients, which means it has less than most other chocolate chips/chocolate brands). I replaced the eggs with potato starch mixed with water and oil, and added a little extra baking soda to counteract the lack of leavening.   HOWEVER: after the first batch, I was also frustrated with how flat the cookies were, so I added what would equal about a cup of extra flour to the recipe. This added to the baking time about one to two minutes.   SO: vegan and soy free suggestion 1 cup Olivio 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup white sugar 2 tablespoons potato starch mixed well with 1 tablespoon oil and 1 1/2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons vanilla 2 tablespoons water 3 cups flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 4 squares semi sweet bakers chocolate cut into small chunks (don't worry if there are little flakes - they add to the flavor)  Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes, and make sure to use tin foil or parchment wiped down with an olive oil dipped paper towel.

I was raised on making cookies. I am not used to the loose batter but these were very good. One of the best cookies I've tried baking.

I made one pan in the oven and had to throw away the rest of the batter because i could not get the first ones off the pan without soaking it in a sink full of water. i followed the recipe exactly and they were just the worst i have ever made and did not even get to taste anything.

These cookies were NOT worth the time! They were flat chocolate-chip PANCAKES! They taste okay but the flat crispy texture ruins the taste. These cookies are on my bad list.

The taste of the dough was wonderful, however I had trouble with the consistency of the dough.  It was much thinner than usual cooke dough, and the cookies came out pancake flat and were unsalvagable.  Could be the gas oven I used...

These cookies were Awesome!  They were so easy to make with my son.  Yes they ran some but if you add about an 1/2 cup to a cup more of flour you will not have that problem.  Doughy taste is the way we like them.  Very Yummy.  Will now make this my new cookie recipe!

This is the worst cookie recipe. They ran all over the pan and you had to scrape them off. I was very diappointed.

These cookies get rave reviews from everyone I make them for! They are thin and chewy and the little bit of milk adds an extra hint of richness. I've tried others after this and my boyfriend specifically requests these. Thanks for the great recipe.

this is a good basic recipe. I did need to add flour about1/2 to 2/3 cup. I also waited to add the chocolate chips till the very end. I gently folded them in and this made them much better:) thanks!

Wonderful!  These were great, but I did add 1/3 cup flour and 2 cups of chocolate chips rather than 1.  Perfect!  I will definitely make them again.  I put the first three cookies in the oven to test the "spread" and they were a bit wide, and I think it had to do with the fact that it was a very hot day today, so the kitchen was warm.  When I added the flour, it fixed the spreading problem right up.  I also baked them for 10-11 min. rather than 9.

I had to do a lot of alterations. Had to add 2/3 cup of flour and cut the cooking time to 7 minutes. Far too thin and had an off taste, perhaps scorched sugar?

Not bad. I followed the directions to a "T," and they turned out fine. I didn't add any extra flour like others  had mentioned. The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more chocolate chips! One cup is not enough.

This recipe is good.  Nice flavor.  They do run a little but, but all I did was omit the milk and added an additional 3/4 cup of flour.  My husband raved over the cookies.

The only reason I gave it a five star is because my husband loved them. I give it a 1 star. They were way too runny just like the other viewers said. I did not like having to scrap my pans for a loong time in order to clean them. Way too much butter also!

I thought they came out not good, it came out to runny and it was hard to get of the pan, I think it was the baking powder that did all this.

Very tasty but I found, like many others here, that they are too flat. They ran on the pan and made "panookies" (pancake cookies)  as my boyfriend calls them.

We called these "see-through" cookies, because of how much they thin out.  However, they were quite delicious after adding 3/4 cup of self-rising flour and cooling the dough for a bit in the fridge.  I was looking for a thinner cookie recipe that yields crispy edges and soft centers, and you definitely helped me get there, Carroll. Thanks!

OK, so here is my opinion. This recipe is just fine if followed as written! The only thing that is missing is the prep step of chilling the dough in the refrigerator for about a 1/2 hour before making the cookies. Do that, and add one to two minutes to the cooking time and these cookies come out soft and chewy. Just the way I like them:)

I just didn't add the milk & the cookies were soft, not thin and crispy. I never saw a recipe that had milk in it, but I guess it's what you use if you like the thin ones.

These cookies turned out just like others mentioned, very messy and thin. My first half of the batch I had to toss and then I read the reviews and added a little extra flour. Adding the extra flour helped keep them in cookie shape but they are extremely thin, taste good but too thin for my liking.

I tried this recipe twice and both times the recipe came out flat as pancakes and tasted like brown sugar - brown sugar recipe ratio way too high. I do not recommend wasting your ingredients.

Letters from a lonely batch of cookies:  Dear prospective bakers,  Before you plan a batch of these cookies, please consider cookie abstinence or adoption.    I am thin, frail, emaciated, deflated, and thus neglected.  Although I am fifty percent sugar, nobody wants me.    Signed, A lonely cookie

Oh my goodness, the batter was so yummy and the cookies looked so wonderful sitting in the oven. They didn't run much on my pan and rose beautifully! After they came out, I wanted to eat ALL of them by myself! I will definitely use this again!

Great taste-- I think the scaling's off though, as it is here it needs more flour. I'm experimenting--looks like about two more cups would do perfectly. :)

This is a delicious and quick recipe!  I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets so I avoided any `scraping of pans` like some other people noted was a problem for them.  I also used very large eggs. I would have no problem serving these to guests (they look exactly how a chocolate cookie should look, and tasted great too!)

I was disappointed with how thin the cookies were (more crunchy than chewy).

Just like Mom used to make! I did add the extra 1/2cup of flour like others suggested.  They do spread out a lot on the pan.  Also could of used more chocolate chips.

I don't know if your supposed to use cold butter with this recipe or what!  But the cookies ran all over the pan.  Add a cup of flour and they don't coat your pan but then they loose a lot of flavor

Well thank you all for assuring I'm not going crazy.  The taste..awesome.. but mine like many others ran into one huge blog ..good but not what I want.  Will try to add a little more flour.  I thought I had missed something, but knew I hadn't.  That'll teach me to start reading the reviews!!

It was a great recipe!! The cookies were quick, easy, fun, and tasted WONDERFUL! I baked them with my two year old son and used white chocolate chips. I followed the recipe except that I added a little extra flour (less then 1/4 cup). The dough seemed a little sticky so I added some to help out with that. They were not runny, were really sweet, and did not stick to the pan - I even forgot to spray it first. I am not sure where everyone else went wrong...but, I know I will save this recipe for the future!!

I have used this recipe numerous times and it is awesome.  Just watch to make sure you take out the cookies just as they are getting brown on the bottom.  Some ovens may use different times.  Try adding in peppermint extract to the mix.

This is a decent all around cookie recipe. The cookies thinned out quite a bit! I omitted the milk. There was no earthly reason for it and would have made the cookies runny. Good flavor, just a basic cookie recipe.

I downloaded this recipe in Sept. 2000 and have been making it ever since!  It is the best recipe I have come across.  We love chewy cookies rather than cakey ones, and this one is just right.  For folks who have trouble  with the cookies being too runny, I recommend adding a dash more flour and chilling the dough for a few minutes

This is by far the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. I like my cookies soft and chewy, and this is it. To prevent the dough from running all over the pan and ending up with a sheet of cookies, I added an additional 4 tablespoon of flour. This does the trick for me :)
