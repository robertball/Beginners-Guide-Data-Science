This one is AWESOME!!!  Made the dish to recipe...next time I'll probably add a little more kick, with another pepper.  Highly suggested for a quick and easy snack.

Tasty! I added some tomatoes and fresh oregano (I didn't have cilantro).  The rice vinegar and tomatoes balances the spice with a nice sweet flavor.

I made this salsa one night, it was great!  Easy to make.  I improvised a bit on some ingredients-- I didn't have hot sauce, so I used some red pepper flakes, and white instead of red onion, and omitted the cilantro.  I also used a can of corn instead of frozen.
Anyway, it was very tasty.  To illustrate:  I made it Sunday night, and Monday I came home from classes to find my roommates munching away with nachos.  I think I got a little bit more, but it was mostly eaten up.  Now I'll have to make more...

I made this for my boyfriend and some friends of his, and they practically licked the bowl clean.  I added a small can of tomato sauce because they were unaccustomed to chunky salsa, but it was great without as well! Thanks for this recipe!

To make it more authentic, use lime juice for the rice vinegar and use chipotle powder for the chili powder.

I used red wine vinegar, added a can of petite diced tomatoes and the juice of one lime and it is great now! I tried it once with rice vinegar and decided I preferred red wine vinegar instead.  I used a couple of green onions instead of a quarter cup of red onions, since it was easier and that was really good too! I eat it mostly as a salad. I love it!!

This was very good. It was warm from the spices but not hot by any means. This is a mild dish and no sweat for us so next time I think I will add some more jalapeno pepper and maybe more chili powder. I used white wine vinegar and dried minced onion since I won't eat the fresh onion. I used canned corn and dried cilantro. I sampled this when I first made it and was good then, but after sitting in the fridge overnight, it was much better. This was perfect with corn chips, like Fritos Scoops. So Tasty!

This was a great recipe.  the only suggestion I would have is to add a little chili sauce if you like spice.
