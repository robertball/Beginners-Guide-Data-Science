Very easy to prepare! I would suggest adding some basil for flavor. Be sure to watch the time in the oven too..

When my children were younger I often made these when their young friends would visit. I'd set out an assortment of toppings including ricotta cheese broccoli fresh spinach leaves pepperoni crumbled bacon you get the idea - whatever I had in the fridge or freezer. The friends would take courage from the selections my kids would make since they were old pros at this and since they were the creators usually picky eaters would actually eat these fun lunches. The parents loved the ideas and many called to thank me! Try it on your own fussy eaters. The trick is to make the oven hot - 400 or 450; they take only a few minutes to cook and the pita won't dry out.

I stumbled upon this recipe looking for another way to use up leftover spiral ham & this fit the bill since we also had leftover pineapple slices from the ham too. We really loved these little pizzas! There really is no need to measure just use as much toppings as you like. We had shredded mozzarella & cheddar on hand so that's what we used. I made the Easy Pizza Sauce III recipe from this site & we had dinner on the table in just minutes. Thanks for the fun fast & tasty recipe!:)

Not sure why but my wife and 10 year old daughter really despised this dish. Usually they eat anything and do so with big smiles on their faces. First they complained about the pita bread being too soggy. Next they both criticized my usage of store-bought pizza sauce (usually i make fresh). Finally my daughter lamented about the taste of the cheese while my nagging wife went off about the pineapple.:( i told them to cook for themselves next time! I will try this recipe again but only for myself. I enjoyed it emencely mostly because it only took about 2 minutes to make it and throw it in the oven.:D

These came out as a great party saver. I made a pizza topping bar for our Super Bowl party letting everyone fix them as they wanted. Huge hit and I didn't have to worry about ordering in pizza.

Good idea for when you have hungry nieces and nephews and no motivation to make pizza dough. I made six with various toppings and they were gone in minutes. A good variation is white garlic pub pizza soooo yummmy!

Quick and easy. I pre- baked the pita so it's crispier and doesn't get soggy. I also used mozzarella and cheddar cheese because that's what I had. You can change it up any way you want. Nice quick lunch or snack.

I make these often when I'm in a hurry but have a craving for pizza. I use different toppings though. My 5 year old daughter loves these!

In high school I made mini pizzas using every kind of bread / cracker / starchy item available at the time oh so long ago;-). I was dubious about using the pita. The entire family agrees these were awesome! The pita makes the perfect crust for a toaster oven pizza. Family vote has this as the new Friday night pizza standard. Everyone can customize their pizza. We can never buy a pizza that everyone likes. One or more is always having to compromise.

This was a hit! Most of the family really enjoy Hawaiian style pizza so I figured it would go over well. Thanks for sharing.;)

This was better than any delivery or store bought pizza. Be sure to use good quality pizza sauce and ham. I made this as the recipe stated and I loved it. However since it was my first time trying pineapple and ham on a pizza I also made a pepperoni and mozzarella pizza just in case. They both came out wonderfully and were equally tasty.
