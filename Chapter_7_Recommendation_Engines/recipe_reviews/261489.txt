Loved this, the golden beets are so pretty when cooked/sliced. I didn't have oranges so I used mandarins for the juice/zest. I also didn't have cayenne and forgot the honey but it turned out delicious. I look forward to adding the cayenne and honey next time I make this. Great recipe!

Very good side dish.  I prepared it in advance and let it marinate for a few hour in the fridge, the flavors harmonize much better that way.
