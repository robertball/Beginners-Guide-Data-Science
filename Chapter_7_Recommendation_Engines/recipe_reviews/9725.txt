Very delicious! Though, I'm considering some low cal substitutions because it's packing a lot (cal) for it's lower volume/yield. Great idea and very tasty!!

I only had peanuts on hand, so used 1/2 C peanuts and 1/2 C peanut butter as I was afraid it would be overwhelmingly peanuty with 3/4 of both. I omitted the top "frosting" layer, as well. I think it came out decadent and yummy, kind of like an extra rich, extra moist peanut butter cookie.

it turned out very good. i omitted the frosting cause i thought that it would be too much then. i also used figs instead of dates as thats what i had at hand.i also used crunchy peanut butter instead of the smooth one and used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup peanut butter and still turned out good. thanks for sharing the recipe

This did not turn out very well. The chocolate bottom tasted chalky and too dry. The peanut butter layer really did not have a good flavor-it was lacking something even though it had a few of my favorite ingredients for baking. When I tried to put the top chocolate layer on, it smeared the peanut butter layer, making it look like an undesirable treat.

Very rich...good, moist, and easy to make. Be sure to cut them into small bars!
Didn't care much for the "frosting" on top... that's why I deducted one star.
