This was wonderful!  I too added a bit of onion and garlic and used evaporated milk instead of cream.   Seasoned salt and freshly ground pepper gave a bit more flavor.  My husband loved it!

This was a great recipe but I felt it needed more because I was serving it over pasta. So when I was melting the butter I added two shallots and two cloves of garlic. Also, I used fresh chives as well as fresh basil and dried basil as well. Salt and fresh ground pepper also added a nice touch. Overall, I would say this is definitely something you should make if you want your husband to look at you like you are a domestic goddess:)

I've tried this sauce a few times with beef - wonderful!! Especially with the addition of plenty of shallots and a touch of fresh garlic. The only issue I ever had was that the sauce turned out with a pink/purple hue to it when using the red port. But I ran across a white port and decided to use that in this recipe instead.  I served it with sauteed boneless chicken breast filets and, although the white port is a bit lighter than the red, it was absolutely fabulous!!  My husband and guests loved it!!  What a wonderful and versitile recipe for both chicken and beef!!

Man, this recipe is to die for!!!  I really think if your sauce is sweet or too strong - you did not reduce it enough.  I was making the same mistake and my husband came in and brought it up to a rolling boil (which the recipe does not tell you to do) to cook off more of the alcohol and then we turned it back down to a simmer.  It truly made all the difference!!!  Very rich flavor - I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!

My family love this sauce over steak, particularly as my husband can no longer eat onions. I have also added a bit more cream and added this to pasta which makes a delicious creamy mushrom sauce.

I used a tawny port wine, which is milder and less sweet than ruby port wines, but still sweet. I added about 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup chopped spring onion, some garlic and pepper and a dash of salt to taste. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I served this over artichoke-stuffed ravioli and it was a huge hit! The color of the sauce itself isn't appetizing but the addition of spring onion and basil over ravioli adds other colors, which helps. So rich that I would only make it to share with guests so I don't kill just my hubby and me with calories. Will definitely try this again. Thanks!!!

This was awesome.  I used this with a tenderloin.  I used fresh portobello mushrooms that we grew.  Wouldn't change anything.  Even my husband liked it.

I tried this dip out on my husband one night as an appetizer before dinner.  We spoon it onto sliced french bread.  Before we knew it, we downed the whole bowl full and barely even touched our dinner! Since, I have served it over baked chicken breast. It is always a hit.

This sounds like it should be delicious.  When it was finished (pretty easy to make) I tried it and thought 'uh oh...it's not that great'.  Once it was on the steaks, though, the flavour somehow complemented the steak wonderfully.  My only issue was the port I used was pretty strong, and I probably didn't cook it for long enough, as it was a predominent flavor.  
It also doesn't keep well with leftovers.

This was ok. I was looking for a recipe that tasted like Steak Diane, one of my favorite dishes. This sauce looked just like it, but the taste fell short. It was a little too sweet, and I reduced the wine by more than half. I even added 2 cloves of garlic, season salt and garlic powder and it was still too sweet.

This was very good!  Used red wine and at the very end added a dollop of sour cream to the mixture.  The sour cream adds a tang that we like.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This was delicious and easy!  I used this sauce on top of homemade Portobello Ravioli!  It was AMAZING!  My boyfriend took one bite and sounded so surprised!  He said the sauce was really good!  Thanks for such a quick, easy and tasty sauce!  I did end up using 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of half and half instead of 2 cups of heavy cream.

Very, very good! Yes, it is sweet. I think I too will try a tawny port next time. We put the gravy over veal cutlets. There was enough gravy left  to save for another meal. I only had 1 cup heavy cream, so I add about 1/3 cup sour cream. I plan to send this recipe to my girls to try.

I liked it, and I had to substitute portobello mushrooms with white ones, and heavy cream with half and half. Even though it's not quite the original recipe, it was still very good.

Very good sauce! Next time I'm going to substitute the heavy cream for Fat Free Half & Half. Land O Lake Fat Free Half & Half taste the best in my opinion.

I served this over a portobello mushroom marinated pork tenderloin.  It was probably the best recipe I have ever made.  I added worcestershire sauce to try to make the sauce brown.  It kind of worked. I also used leftover shiraz/cabernet instead of the the port and reduced by 2/3.  Didn't use the basil, because I forgot about it, but absolutely loved it on the tenderloin.

I was a little disappointed by this recipe, especially because I LOVE mushrooms! Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the recipe pretty closely. I really didn't like the color of the sauce...kind of a greyish pink color. It wasn't very appetizing to look at. The flavor was pretty good but didn't blow me away. We served it over steak and I think I would have rather just eaten the steak on its own. Looks like a lot of people loved it though so you may not want to take my review to heart.

I served it over small fillets once with potatoes and once with pasta - it was great both times.  The second time I forgot the basil and my boyfreind said it was "missing something" but it was still good.

This was very good.  I only added some garlic and parsley while cooking the mushrooms.  I served this over baked chicken and angel hair pasta.  A mild sweet taste.  A keeper.

Very nice sauce!  I used Aphothic Dark because it was the only red in the house and it was great in the sauce. I also added 2 garlic cloves and substituted fresh thyme for the basil and added some fresh chives. And about half a cup of fresh grated Parmesan. A super easy sauce to make and very impressive.

My husband and I had this sauce with filet mignon and I thought that the sauce while amazing, was a bit overpowering for that cut, though my husband disagreed and thought they went well together. Next time, I will probably have this sauce with a cheaper cut.

Way to sweet, even though I followed directions to the letter. I plan to try again with a burgandy instead of port and sour cream instead of cream.

I was looking for a mushroom/wine/cream sauce and found this.  It was really good and satisfied my craving, but it's missing something.  Not a cook, so not sure... garlic? salt? parmesan cheese???

This is a seriously great recipe for mushroom sauce.  I usually add a lot of my own twists to recipes, but I didn't need to do anything here at all!  The first few times I tried this, I served it over chicken breasts and got rave reviews!  I'm going to try this with steak one of these nights!

I tried this recipe and even let the port cook down. I did not like this.

Though I did not care for this recipe personally, I have to rate it at least 3 stars, because my dinner guests loved it!  Go figure, as I was quite disappointed in how it turned out.  The flavors in the recipe simply did not compliment each other, at least not for my palate.  I did pass on the recipe to my guests, however; again, they loved it, so what do I know?!

Our family did not care for this sauce. I imagine the taste depends on the type of port used. The sauce had a very bland not so good flavor.
