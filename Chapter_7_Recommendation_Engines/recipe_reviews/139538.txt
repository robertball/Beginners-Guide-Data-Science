I used Starbucks VIA instant coffee and instead of Splenda, I used one packet Truvia sweetener and fat free milk. I learned from another coffee recipe to use coffee ice cubes in your iced coffee instead of ice so your drink won't be watered down. I did just that. This saved my afternoon--simple, gave me a boost and I didn't have a bunch of unwanted calories.

This was ok. There are other recipes that have some spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. Guess over ice it would be better.

This recipe should MAKE IT CLEAR in the heading that this is a "reduced sugar version" of - (Easy Iced Coffee from Allrecipes). I noticed it right away. It does mention it in the footnotes, but it does not say which recipe it is a reduced sugar remake of. I especially noticed because I actually make the Easy Iced Coffee recipe using Truvia. It is also one of my favorite recipes on Allrecipes. If you are looking to switch out the sugar in the recipe, and are diabetic, this change will be helpful.

This was too plain and bitter for my taste. Next time I will add vanilla and use more Splenda.

Super easy instant iced coffee.  I used 2 packets of PureVia, not Splenda.  Tastes just fine!  Technically not a cappuccino though, as cappuccino has foamy milk with high volume, and with this recipe you try to get the actual coffee foamy instead.  I could not get it to stay foamy.  Still tastes fine, and is a great sugar-free option!!! Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012

I liked it....a little sweet for my taste, so I added a bit of cocoa powder. It was great! You might also add some cool whipped and semi-sweet chocolate chips.
