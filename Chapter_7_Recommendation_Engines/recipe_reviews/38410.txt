Just the way my grandma makes it! A little advice: you can store the jam in any jar you got but make sure that you put the glass and the lids in boiling water to get all germs off. Place them on clean kicthen toweles upside down and make sure that you don't touch the inside of jar or lid, otheriwse you'll most likley end up with mold in your jam. Once the jam is in the glass, screw the lid on and place them upside down for about ten minuts. This way the jam will stay good for months and you don't have to freeze it. 
Small jars with a cute red&white piece of cloth around the lid make great gifts!

This was my first time making jam/jelly. It was so easy to make and tastes great!!! My 9 year old son loves it. (I didn't even know where to get the jars from because it is not "the season" to make jam in MD yet! The craft store had the jars in stock.) 

Here are a few tips and/or lessons I learned...

1. Use a blender or chopper and puree the strawberries until you have four cups. 

2. I did not have a thermometer, so I brought the mixture to a rolling boil stirring consistency for ten minutes. (All you will see is bubbles all over the bottom of the pot and foam in some areas. If you put a lid on, it will boil over your pot.)

3. I did the cold plate test to see if the mixture would jell. The first time I was unsure, so I gave it five more minutes of rolling boil time, then tried the plate test again.

4. When you get the jars ready, after soaking them in hot water, use tongs and silicone mitts to handle the glass jars because they will be VERY hot.

5. Place the strawberry jam mixture in the hot jars and put the lid on right away and then turn it upside down.

6. I waited 5 minutes and then turned them back over. This seals the jars.

7. Your jam will not look like jam/jelly, more like thick syrup.  

8. Wait for it to "set" After 48 hours you will know if you did it right.

9. I got 2 and a half 16oz jars out of this recipe.

I hope this helps. Check out the mason jar pics of my finished jam.

Enjoy and Good Luck!

Too sweet. The boil needs to be rolling - you cannot stir it down. It will splatter everywhere. This only set as jam after a night in the fridge. Next time I will cut the sugar - I was going to give a small jar to my grandma, but it is far too sweet. When you taste the mix just after the sugar dissolves, that is not the real sweetness. It intensifies once it's boiled so don't think it isn't sweet enough if you first taste it. I put three small plates in the freezer, put a small dob of jam on one and then replaced. After a minute I checked if I could run my finger through and had it jelled. Easy but too sweet. UPDATE : Gave it to Grandma, she loved it. :)FYI, you need 4 punnets of 250g strawberries to get 4 cups of mashed strawberries. Each result tastes a little different, so yum. I advise to follow it exactly, and it tastes a million times better than any jam from a supermarket. It's better to use the heaviest bottom huge pot you have, and start the boil slowly, move it up in quarter increments until high, this way it doesn't catch and burn. Don't be in a hurry, I burnt it when I needed it that afternoon because I was in a hurry, and brought it to the boil too fast in a thin bottomed pot.

Turned out great!  Water bath is about 10-15 minutes in boiling water for those that don't know.

Great recipe. I have been canning for years and never made Jam without pectin. I had a dinner party last night. I had left over strawberries so I thought it would be a great idea to make the jam so each of my guest could take somthing home. I did't have pectin on hand so I thought I would give this a try. It turned out great! I read the reviews and the people that said the jam was too thin, they did not boil hard enough. Great recipe!!! I will be using it when I do my jam. Thank You!

Wow - fabulous, easy recipe.  I picked 25 lbs. of strawberries yesterday and tried this recipe and a sure-jell freezer jam recipe.  Both were good, but I loved this one. One or two recommendations:  Do not use a saucepan - I started with a 3 qt pan and had to pour the jam into a large stock pot midway through cooking - when it starts to boil, it really bubbles up. It takes a long time to get from 215 degrees to 220, keep stirring so the bottom does not burn and be patient.  I also used the plate test and it worked well also.  The results are great.  I used ziploc plastic containers, and am storing what we are not eating in the freezer - it won't last long.

I am only giving this 3 stars because I feel the instructions are lacking for those who have never made jam.
I was left with a lot of questions and had to find the answers elsewhere.
A lot of people said they made this with less sugar than the recipe called for and it turned out fine.
For me it didn't turn out at all with less amount of sugar.
I highly suggest that if you have never made jam before to just follow the recipe as is.
But on a fantastic note, my overly runny jam with half the amount of sugar is the most fantastic sauce for pancakes and vanilla ice cream, yummy!!
I am only dissapointed in the lack of insrtuctions for a newbie, otherwise it tastes great and I am happy with the flopp since there was nothing wasted.

Great recipe!  I've never made jam before, but decided to give it a try.  I actually used frozen strawberries and it was fantastic!  I used 3 cups of sugar and actually will use less next time.  It's super sweet and super yummy!  At first it was runny, but thickened up as it cooled down.  My husband and kids love it!  No more store bought jam for us!

I've never made Jam before, and this was really easy!  I used Frozen Strawberries and just cooked on low with 3 1/2 cups of sugar until softened.  THEN I mashed them very easily in the pan with a pastry dough cutter.  Due to others' reviews of the consistency, I threw in 1/2 tsp of  gelatin into the still cool strawberry mix and let it sit about 5 minutes before proceeding with the boiling (I didn't have any pectin, nor do I have the slightest idea how to use it).  I should note here that I added to the cooking jam mixture the lemon rind from one of the lemons I used for juice. I did this because of its naturally high pectin level - The rind is removed before canning the jam.  I boiled on high for 25-30 minutes before the plate test passed and it came out... Perfect!  I used the upside down jar "process" for 10 minutes instead of the water bath and it all came out awesome :)  I even opened one of the jars the next day to test out the actual canning part.  The lid gave way suction and "popped" as it was twisted opened; so the canning had worked as it was suppose to.  The flavor and texture are AMAZING too :). I see no reason to purchase store bought jam, 'cause this stuff is waaaay better

I have never made jam before, but this was very easy. Be prepared to stir for awhile though! I didn't feel like processing, so I just put it in freezer containers and made freezer jam. It turned out great!

This one turned out pretty good.  A little on the thin side, but great taste and color.  You really have to cook to the precise degree to make sure it sets.  Overall very good.

It was so simple!! I just *loved* it. The consistency is excellent and the jam's just perfect for morning toasts. (Tip: trust me, there's nothing like serving this jam over cheesecake. Try it, you won't regret it!!)

Love this recipe!  Have made it for the past two years as Year-End Teacher's Gifts and always a hit.  Two suggestions though, like everyone has said the recipe calls for too much sugar.  I used 1/2 the amount and it was still plenty sweet, could probably get away with using even less.  Second, I didn't have a thermometer to measure when it reached 220 degrees so I just kept boiling and stirring until it got to the consistency I wanted, which is about 45 min to 1 hr.  That's a long time I know, but the result is well worth it!  The jam come s out a beautiful deep red color and is nice and thick in consistency.  Will be making it every year :)!

This is a great and easy to follow recipe that will give you a great strawberry jam but after making it for the first time I would make following changes and suggestions. 1) I LOVE lemony taste so I added zest of 1 lemon or a bit less 2) You need around 2.3lb of fresh strawberries to get 4 caps of crashed one. 3) 4 cups of sugar is a bit much (and I have a sweet tooth) next time I'll use 3 1/2 cups of sugar 4)Make sure to use BIG pot I mean 7 or 8 litters (2 gallons) or it will boil right over 5)Make sure all the sugar is dissolved before you crank up the heat and when you do crank it up make sure to use the highest setting on your stove (you basically trying to overheat a liquid and to do this you need  to use very, very high heat) and for the true jam connoisseur I added 1 1/2 to 2  tbs of grand mariner liquor to give it a hint of orange.

I love this receipe.  Less sugar than most others but just a sweet and much easier.  Somethings I did learn were:  Dont Double the Recipe and if you add 1/8th tsp butter just when it starts to foam, it cuts the foam back down and there is very little to scrape off before you put it into jars.  This is now my ONLY strawberry jam recipe.

I make jams, jellies and preserves all the time since I live on a farm and have fruit trees and live in a country where fruits are available all year round.  This is the first time that I have had a strawberry jam turn out quite as it was supposed to.  The taste is fantastic.  I modified the recipe as I and my husband prefer whole fruits or chunky jams.  The cooking time takes a little longer as I am also very near the coast.  I have added a picture of the canned goods.  My husband actually tasted the pot after it was bottled in the jars, and his immediate reaction was, HMMMMMMMM!!  That is a plus all by itself.

I must admit the last time I attempted Strawberry jam was when we had picked so many from the garden and I made an attempt at jam, which was a total failure.  I burned it and then tried to eat it anyway, but oh my goodness, it was awful and so I ended up chucking it out.  Cried for weeks.

Thanks for this super recipe and now I have no excuses for not preparing it properly.

My husband's favorite, we will never buy jelly from the store again.  Our strawberry patch was wildly successful in the last few weeks and we needed something to do with the berries we couldn't eat - other than freeze them, as our freezer is already overstuffed. Never tried preserves before, but two thumbs up for this simple recipe.  I noticed that during the cooking, the temperature of the hot mix that was bubbling was always around 200deg, while the temp of the homogeneously mixed liquid was much lower.  HINTS: Don't stir too often, use a large, heavy soup pot (not a saucepan) and do not add a top at any time; gradually increase the temperature of the stove top (don't start on high heat, start on med-low heat and increase as the berry mix warms).  Also, I can't imagine getting this right without a thermometer to mark the point of 220 deg; if you don't have one, get one first! Thanks for posting!

Updated 6.14.14:
I use this recipe for apricot jam as well as other fruits/berries on hand in quantity/in season. Some times I add a little light brown sugar in addition to the white, gives a little different "sweet". Thanks again - has become a family staple!

This recipe as listed is wonderful and makes any store bought jam tasteless!  Although the 4 cups of sugar sounds like alot, you should use it all.  I researched it and the sugar acts as a preservative and less may cause mold to grow, even in your jar you sealed with a water bath and most definitetly would shorten the shelf life even refrigerated.

This strawberry jam was great.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  There is only one catch to this recipe. Inorder to get the cooking jam up to 225 degrees you will have to let the mixture boil for about 15 minutes on high.  I have also used this recipe on other fruits such as peaches. I love this recipe because there are not preservaives just fruit and sugar.  Gotta love it.

This jam is beautiful...it reminds me of my GrandMothers' farmhouse recipe. We prefer our jam less sweet so I doubled the amount of berries and lemon juice and used only 5 cups of sugar. It turned out perfect. I will definetly make this recipe again.

READ: 1) Do NOT use anything under a 6-quart stock pot. If you do, and you find yourself boiling and boiling and boiling after half an hour, you CAN pour it into a bigger pot. I did that and it worked so much better. 2) This is not a 10-minute jam. If you are wondering when the hell the strawberry will thicken, you might be stirring for a good hour, as myself. The first half hour or so the jam will have the consistency of frothy Campbell's tomato soup, which is normal. It will be ready when the boil is slow and sticky-looking, and about as dark as deep, deep red cherries. When you see that, remove from heat and pour into jars. If there are some burnt pieces of jelly in your jam, don't worry about it. And yes, the bottom of your pan will be a mess, just soak it in warm soapy water overnight. Good luck!

I made this jam last night, my berries were very ripe so I only added about half of the sugar called for.  I did mess up by not boiling it long enough. I canned it and all my jars sealed, hopeful that it would maybe thicken up during the night but it didn't. This morning I dumped it all back into the pot and cooked it until it reached 220 degrees and put it back into the jars and processed again..It turned out PERFECT!!  ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!  I am now making another batch..I also forgot to mention that I made the first batch 16 cups of mashed berries, 7 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of lemon juice.. note to self.....don't panic and quit too soon, keep stirring and boiling!! the first time around was kinda thick but still runny, would of been great on pancakes!! Thanks for the great recipe, this was my first jam making experience!

This stuff is addicting! I was a little skeptical because it didn't taste very good warm. But once it had cooled completely it was delicious! I double the recipe. Using 8 cups of berries, 1/2 cup of lemon juice but only 3 cups of sugar. I didn't think the plate test was necessary because it was pretty obvious when it was ready to come off the burner. It reduces WAY down, and really thickens up. Looks almost maroon in color. It turned out perfect, and I will definitely make this again, might even try it with other fruit.

I love the ease of this recipe! It's great! It's a little runny but who cares! Maybe mine is runnier because I don't add the recommended amount of sugar. 4 c. is just waaaaay too much. I tried it with 2 c. and that was still too much. I am currently working on my 6th batch and I am only using 1 1/3c. of sugar and 1/3 c. Dutch Jell pectin and it tastes delicious!!! In my fifth batch I threw in 1 1/2c. of blueberries as well - YUM! This is a super easy base recipe! Next I'm trying 1 1/2c. of crushed pineapple added!!!!!!!

For us new to making jam...be sure to stir and watch the very end of the boiling process....it will burn on you in a second!  Great receipe and 20 minutes is a safe estimate for cooking at a rolling boil I also cut the sugar down and found the plate test very helpful. Enjoy

I love this recipes! I recommend cutting the sugar in half! It was a bit too sweet for my taste even when I cut it in half but, I still loved it! I was really simple to make and it smells wonderful!

This was my first time making jam/preserves.  Made a batch of regular and a batch with Splenda for my brother who is a diabetic.  Very Easy; taste great. I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh as it was about 20 cents cheaper per pound.  After they thawed, very easy to mash.  Will make this again and again.... plan  on using for Christmas gifts to make a gourmet basket.  Thank you to the author of this recipe!

This was my first attempt at making jam, like many others that have reviewed it, and it really came out well...in fact, I enjoyed making it so much, I'm going to order a home canning kit off Amazon tonight. (This jam I am putting in the Ball freezer-safe containers since I wasn't sure it would work and I didn't want to invest in the canning kit just yet until I was sure I would use it.) This recipe could NOT be easier...the only thing I had problems with is that my two pounds of strawberries only yielded three cups of strawberries, not four, so I cut the sugar back to three cups and the lemon juice to three tablespoons to adjust. Seemed to work out just fine.

I am not sure what everyone is saying about the long time getting to temperature. I used a candy thermometer and I am not sure it's because I was using an Emerilware stockpot with copper on the bottom, but MAN, it hit 220 degrees in a FLASH. It didn't even boil for ten minutes. I tested it with the plate test too just to make sure I hadn't done something wrong and it jelled right up.

Amazing recipe. I may never buy store-bought jam again!

I am rating this recipe based on the recipe submitted, no alterations. I made the recipe as is and it is way too sweet. Also, I boiled mine for over 20 mins and it never got above 215F. I canned the 'jam' and processed in water bath. Tried it the next day and it was still too sweet and was more like strawberry syrup for pancakes than anything. If made for something like that it would be fantastic. But this was not a jam. Not even thick enough to pick up with a knife to spread. I got a canning book at the library and there was almost the exact recipe, except it only calls for 2 cups sugar. The recipe in the book states to boil for 15 mins and check using the plate method or a spoon method (2 ribbons drip from a metal spoon separately and don't run together) to check if it will gel.  And to continue to boil until you reach the gel state.Before it reached this state it took almost 20 minutes. It never did get to 220'F, and I had the heat on high  Be sure to stir constantly or the bottom will burn. And use a LONG metal spoon so the boiling jam doesn't splatter on you. I won't be using this for my jam recipe. But for a syrup recipe I would, with half the sugar.

This is wonderful.  It was my 1st time making jam and I was so excited with the outcome.  I only used 2 cups of sugar and it was perfect.  It made 3 1/2 - 1/2 pint jars.  My 3 year old daughter and husband have devoured bread and jam all day.

Awesome and Easy!

I used this recipe to make my first batch of jam, not a fan of pectin so this worked well.  The berries I had picked were fairly sweet so I reduced the sugar to one cup.  Thinking about making another batch and adding some peaches.  Be sure to wait for the "tar pit" bubbles prior to pouring into jars.

Exactly the technique I prefer.  No reason to add pectin or anything to jellify the jam, it takes care of itself if cooked right.  But this recipe had way too much sugar!  3lbs strawberries, 3 cups sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Likewise, 2lbs strawberries should be 2 cups sugar.  Anything more than 3lbs of strawberries will take too long to cook, but you can do less and be ok.  Let the strawberries be the flavor, though, not the sugar.

I followed this recipe as instructed and, while the taste was very good, the consistency was not. While cooking I could see the jam boil and gradually become firmer. I took it off the heat soon after and as it cooled it turned into strawberry tar, and finally into strawberry cement. It is literally hard as a rock inside the jar, so much so that the metal knife itself bends if I try to scoop any out. Fortunately re-heating it in the microwave softens the jam to where it is useable, but I would not try this recipe again because I'm not sure what went wrong. Did I dd too much sugar? Too little? Was it cooked for too long or not enough? Though as I said, the taste was good.

I followed the instructions to the letter, and it is the BEST jam I have ever made. I think the heavy bottom pot (I used my pasta pot), and the FULL rolling boil (who cares how much splatters on the wall...its worth it!) will avoid all of the problems other reviewers encountered. I used 6 cups of strawberries, and 5 cups of sugar (only because I ran out)and it filled 12 x 125ml perfectly - with enough left over for the kids to each have a big spoonful on toast. Total boiling time was about 15 - 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I have made this jam for several years now........the first two years it was runny.......I found out last year that the key is bringing it up to 220 degrees on a candy thermometer for at least 2 minutes........now everything is great!   This year I used 3 instead of 4 cups of sugar......I like it better!

I made this jam last night and it was the first time I attempted to make jam. It came out perfectly. For those that don't know. Make sure and sterilize the jars in boiling water for 10 min. then pour the jam in the containers and seal and then I placed back in the boiling water for 5 minutes to ensure it lasts longer. I cut the strawberries in half and then mushed them with the bottom of a drinking glass, it worked really well. I am giving them away as holiday gifts, it was so easy!

Can anyone tell me if this recipes comes out the same using splenda. I have a family full of diabetics and they still enjoy good food. Plus I live near Plant City Florida, where we have the sweetest strawberries in the world. If anyone could help me out I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, Kim....Tried it with spenda, and it works very well. Just adjust to taste.

I made this Strawberry Jam and it was very delicious and very easy to make.  My husband ate it all before my daughter and I got a chance to really have some on our toast.  I lost my original recipe from this website but was very happy that I found it again. Excellent!!!

This was my very first attempt at making any kind of jam or jelly. I've been too scared to try to in the past. But this recipe seemed so easy, and I had to use up these strawberries, so I went for it. It turned out so beautifully and delish! I made only one change: Instead of 1/4 cup of lemon juice I used a 1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice and a tiny bit of orange zest, as I didn't have any lemons. It took about 20 minutes of boiling to reach the jelly stage. Mine did set up nicely and spreads beautifully. I can't wait to make more for family and friends.

I made 2 different batches of jam.  Didn't firm up.  Is there something that I should have done?  I did use a food processor to cut up and smash the strawberries so I don't know if that had anything to do with it.

Reduced sugar to 3 cups and still too sweet.  Boiled until it reached 220 degrees. Poured into hot jars and turned upside down to seal for about 15 minutes.  Placed in fridge overnight to set. When I opened one jar to try it out it had become a thick completely un-spreadable chunk of jam.  Have to warm it in the microwave to make it spreadable.  Any ideas as to what went wrong?

Awesome! FYI, re: Boiling over. If you add about 1/2-1 tsp of butter to it before it boils it will not froth and/or boil over. If you MUST use a vegetable oil, add coconut oil or organic olive oil, but absolutely NOT margarine, canola or any other toxic rancid oil.

Btw, I added only 3 cups sugar and it was plenty, and very coarsely mashed the strawberries for more of a preserves-type feel with strawberry chunks in it (we love that).

Made this  recipe this morning. Was very easy used a food processor to crush (in several batches).  Tasted great going into jars and looks like will  setup but even if its syrup that would be ok with us. We use more syrup than Jam anyway.

I used 2.5 cups sugar and it was perfectly sweet. I have successfully used this in other recipes such as jam thumbprints and as a tart filling. To get 4 cups of mashed strawberries I used the whole 2lb. box minus about 1.5 cups of strawberries. I chopped these up coarsely and added them to give the jam some texture and chunkiness.

Excellent recipe and tastes amazing. I had so much strawberry that I doubled the recipe and it came out great. I cut the sugar down to 3 instead of 4 cups and it was sweet enough. Do not be tempted to stop boiling before you reach 220 though. I stopped at about 115 degrees and it was a little watery, even though it passed the jelling test. Even though this was the first time I ever made jam of any kind, it tasted so good that I actually divided it in jars and gave to family and friends.
Do use a deep pot for it, it really bubbles over when it starts to boil. Keep your kitchen door open when you make it and the house will smell like strawberries for sometime.. sweet :)

Great flavor on this. I did cut the sugar to 3 cups.  My only complaint is that this is almost too soft.  It could be poured out of the jar, in fact it would be great over ice cream!  What I made has to be spooned out of the jar.  Don't know if that is the intent of the finished product or not - but still very tasty!

Good and pretty easy - make sure you use a BIG pot, it nearly quadruples in volume while boiling. Even gentle stirring caused it to sputter out of the pot.

Un-freaking-believable! This is so, so good; I want to eat it out of bowl all by itself! We used strawberries that had been freshly picked in Ventura, CA; the area is the strawberry capital. It has such a fresh, clean flavor! I took the suggestion of one reviewer and threw in the rind of the lemon that I had juiced. Also, I didn't have a working thermometer, but I let it boil ten minutes and then started the plate test. After about 15 minutes, it was ready to go. Perfect!!!

Although I used a thermometer, my jam was always 5 degrees shy of what it should be.  The colour was great and it was slightly thick so I poured it in my jars.  The jam thickened upon cooling and after a few days was the perfect consistency.  Everyone loved this jam and although it started out really sweet, the flavours mellowed over time.  Would make this again!  2 pints of berries made about 4 - 1/2 pint jars of jam.

I gave my sister this recipe and she won first place at the county fair! The only thing she did differently was to add a pat of butter when the jam started frothing. This recipe it so good that I gave it out for Christmas gifts this year! Thanks!

My husband said, "This is the best strawberry jam I have ever tasted."  It did not burn because I used a Pampered Chef pan.  I used only 3 cups of sugar and it set well.  Amazing!

My kids and I had a wonderful time preparing this simply delicious recipe. It's lip-smacking good! When strawberries are in season here in California, it's a real treat to pull off the highway and buy a flat fresh off the field. We enjoy most of them in the car and on the beach, but the ones that don't get eaten usually go bad within a day or two. This recipe was an excellent way to put those sweet, juicy strawberries to use. I used half the sugar the recipe called for since the strawberries were so sweet on their own. A+!

Great, easy recipe. My mom suggested adding a couple of pads of butter to help with the frothing that happens during the cook time. Worked like a charm. I did cut back on the sugar to 3 cups as I found 4 cups too sweet.

A great standard recipe to use with any types of berries. I made two batches. One with fresh organic strawberries and another with frozen organic mix berries (strawberries, raspberries and black berries). In both cases, I reduced the sugar to 3 cups and added 1 tsp. of butter to eliminate foam. After bringing it to a roiling boil, I reduced the the temperature and zapped it a few times with my hand blender to pulverize some of the fruit. Then I simmered until it reduced to a thick glazy sauce. Boiling it at too high a temperature creates tons of splatter and may burn the jam. In the end, mine set with no problems and tastes heavenly!

Excellent! I only had half the amount of fruit called for so I made a half batch. I can taste the lemon too, but I don't mind it. Almost as good as my moms! I would make this again. It really is simple and well worth the time involved. I used a digital thermometer to get to 220. It took a lot longer than I thought it would, so be patient. These preserves are wonderful on hot biscuits with warm butter. YUMMY!   !!!UPDATE!!! First, the lemon flavor was gone by the next day. It set perfectly! And is nearly all gone in just a couple days.   I just used the same basic recipe for cherry jam. Worked great and is DELISH!!!  THANKS AGAIN!!!

I thought it was great. I read the reviews and I used 2 and 3/4 cups of sugar. I think it depends on peoples tastes so I recommend that you start with 2 cups and taste it and add more sugar until you get to your perfect taste. My jam came out a little thin but I think I didn't boil it a a consistant temp. for long enough. I also have a new stove that I am still getting used to cooking with :) Enjoy!!!

Easy recipe. I used enough strawberries to make 4 cups, mashed, and then we pureed them because my son didn't want chunks. We used only 2 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet. We boiled for about 12 minutes, and the jam set up perfectly. We have one container in the fridge for now, and will freeze the rest. Delicious!

Took almost an hour to reach temp. Once I turned the burner all the way up, with jam boiling like crazy, finally reached temp.  Using the plate test, jam did not get thick enough until temp reached 220F.  Don't be afraid of burning it, just keep stirring.  Excellent flavor, but way too sweet, will cut sugar in half next time.

I boiled it 15 minutes because I used half the amount of sugar.  I did the plate test to see when it was ready and it worked perfectly.  It's just like the jam my Mom used to make.  I like this recipe because it makes a smaller amount.

I am a guy who doesn't know how to cook. On a whim I went and picked some strawberries and made jam with this recipe. Well, actually I ended up using half the amount of sugar as I didn't know how to measure with the cups in our kitchen!

It turned out superb. So the only change I'd recommend is - use half the sugar!! :)

Thank you for such a simple recipe that worked so well. It was easy and the jam is delicious.

Can I use the same recipe for plums? Or do I need to search for a simple recipe like this one?

I offered to make jelly for my friends country wedding, and I used this recipe. I used frozen mix berries. I read through most of the comments, and did the following; used two cups of sugar, 1/8 cup of butter when it started to foam, the plate test, and using the rind, and turned jars upside down.
I washed the jars in the dishwasher on the highest temp, and kept them on dry, to keep hot. It didn't foam, splatter or stick to the bottom. I stirred the whole time, was ready at the first plate test, which was about 15 minutes. It smelled amazing. I have to let other people taste it to see how it tastes, and set, but it was so easy I should be able to make 60 jars of jam in a day or two.

While I've been making freezer jam for years, this was my first attempt at canning.  I shared travails with other reviewers.  I got spit on (OUCH!), and while I stirred the entire 20 minutes except for the plate in the freezer thing and the spoon in ice water thing, it scorched.  I ran over 20 minutes and then all of a sudden it was too thick.   And what a sticky mess!  This was really just canning practice and that went well, so I'm not upset that my 3 8 oz. jars of jam are probably inedible.  This process is just not cost effective...I'll go back to freezer jam.  Three stars because a lot of the failings were mine.

Thank you so much for this easy recipe! We are now enjoying fresh jelly all the time! It's so easy I just make it as we need it. It jelled perfectly when I mashed the strawberries like you said instead of putting them in the food processor. Thanks again!

With only the addition of a Tbsp of butter to minimize the bubbles, I followed this recipe as directed. I was a little apprehensive as I have only ever made jelly before, and then I used Certo pectin. As suggested by other reviewers, I gradually increased the heat and did the freezer plate test 10 minutes after it reached a full rolling boil. I ended up using all three plates, about two minutes apart, until I felt I had a good result. Now I'm sitting here with a little grin for each lid I hear pop as it seals shut. I wiped out the pan with some bread and yes, it's sweet, but it's GOOD! Already the jam was thickening up nicely even as it cooled in the pan bottom.

Very nice jam recipe.  Make sure you stir it constantly to prevent scorching.  I did two batches, I think I burned one batch slightly, it has a slight smokey aftertaste.  The second batch turned out great.

This was my first attempt at making strawberry jam and it turned out great even though I halved the recipe and used agave syrup instead of sugar. and since I was experimenting anyway, I also added a dash of raspberry infused white balsamic vinegar.

This is the best jam recipe I've ever found.  I've made three batches and each one turned out perfectly.  I did reduce the amount of sugar by about 1/4 cup because my family prefers less sweet jam.  I do advise following the freezer plate method as this worked out well.

This was very tasty!  I have never made jam before and I was surprised at how easy it was to make.  I never got it to the 220 degrees.  I called it done when it was nice and thick and looked like jam.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Giving fours stars b/c really it needs only three cups of sugar, I like sugar don't get me wrong, but four cups was too much and mine set great, maybe a bit too thick, but I refridgerated it and I bet if you let it sit out to room temp before serving it would be perfect.  Loved the ease of this recipe.  Used a thermometer to reach 220.

The recipe was excellent!  I used 3 c. of sugar with 4 c. strawberries that I pureed in a blender, along with the amount of lemon juice that is called for in the recipe.  I was a little hesitant about making this since I've never canned before.  Unfortunately, my jam burnt.  I got 3 half-pint jars out of this before I stopped because it was clearly burnt.  I think next time, I'll do what someone else suggested - make sure I have a heavy bottomed pot, and bring the mixture up to a boil slowly.  Thanks for the recipe...we just finished it up on some ice cream!

Perfect. I did lessen the amount of sugar. I also used all organic strawberries and organis sugar, organic really is better tasting as well. Plus if you have at least 1/3 of under ripe strawberries, than it will have more natural pecin and not be so hard to thicken. Generally it takes about 40 minutes of boiling. Then, like i said depending on the strawberries, you may want to let them cool, then cook them again to a boil. The boil, cool, boil method also extracts more natural pecin from the strawberries as well. I loved this jam. I will make this as Christmas gifts.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I just hate messing around with pectin, and my freezer jams usually go amuck.  I was so pleased with this recipe... the plate and freezer trick worked like a charm. Now this is how I make all of my fruit preserves.  You need much less sugar this was too. If your jam is runny it just means that you need to boil it more. It usually takes about two hours of boiling for me.

Delishious.  Make sure to heat to the required temp, or jam will be runny.  Comes out of the freezer well too.

What a fantastic and super easy recipe!  I only had about 3 cups of mashed strawberries, so scaled my recipe back accordingly, to do 3/4 of it.  That said, I did use less sugar than what 3/4 of the recipe would have been.  Probably only used about 1 3/4 cups total, instead of the 3 cups called for based on having only 3 cups of the berries.  I did the freezer test a few times, just kept stirring my pot on the rolling boil, for a good ten minutes at least.  My recipe ended up yielding 6 mini jars (the 125ml size) which I sterilized in boiling water and sealed by turning upside down for about 5 minutes once filled (as indicated by some of the reviews).  The consistency and flavour of my jam are great - certainly sweet enough, even with my reduction of sugar.  Will use this recipe going forward hands down!  Thanks :)

Great basic recipe but WAY too much sugar. That much sugar would overwhelm the yummy berries. The berries should be the focus. I used less than 1 cup because I wasn't sure what kind of consistency I would get.  Next time, I would use just a .5 cup of sugar.

A neighbor gave me a giant bag of very tiny, but extraordinary tasting strawberries.  I made this jam with them and it is awesome!  I do think that having a candy thermometer helped with knowing when it was fully done.  It has just begun to cool in some tupperware containers (it will never make it long enough to bother with canning) and it is already solidifying.  The strawberries I had were very tart, so the sugar is the right amount.  But if you have very sweet strawberries you might want to cut back a bit!  So simple and good!

This is the best! My daughter and I just made it for the first time tonight.  While it was in the water bath we cooked up some cornbread muffins and my family of five almost finished off a pint jar!  We doubled the batch and only used a total of 6 cups of sugar.  It was PLENTY sweet!  Definately keep stirring and keep boiling.  It takes a long time to get past the boiling stage to the boiling tar like stage!  Never did get that thermometer all they way up to 220.  But it stayed at 210 for at least 15 minutes.  We were very careful to turn up the heat gradually so all in all we were stirring for almost and hour:)  We took turns and had fun!

I prepared this by the directions. After reading the issue others were having with consistency, I (perhaps) overcooked mine. Even though I stirred constantly, I think there is a bit of burnt flavor.

Oh, and be cause I couldn't find this anywhere else - this recipe yielded a little over two cups for me.

Super easy and perfect recipe as is.  I have made this jam many times.  I give the berries a quick pulse in the blender.  I start the mixture on low to medium heat and gradually increase the temp to high.  After it comes to a rolling boil I dial it back just a smidge.  I use a thermometer to make sure it doesn't go over the temp, but since I read and used the tip about reducing until it's a deep maroon color I don't think I need it anymore.  You can tell at that point that it's beginning to thicken.  Great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!  I frequently double this recipe!  I always cut the sugar down (usually by about half) because the berries have such a delicious natural sweetness to them and the original recipe is too sweet.  I tend to stir for about 45 minutes at a slight simmer...this slow cooking process gives it a wonderful natural jam-like consistency.  The berries and lemon need lots of time to create a proper pectin.  It really is worth the extra time!  :)  Perfect to give as gifts!!!

My sister and I have used this recipe two times now.  I just opened a jar from last year and it is still just as delicious as it was last May!  We LOVE this recipe.  This year we did it with splenda and it was just as great! 
All we did was turn the jars upside down after putting on the lid. That seals the jar rather than going through another boiling bath.

Best jam I've ever had! This was my first time making jam and now I'm hooked! I followed other suggestions and used a food processor to mash the strawberries. I also reduced sugar to 3.5 cups. Keep in mind the sugar quantity you need may vary each time depending on the sweetness of the batch of strawberries.

This was absolutely amazing! I followed the ingredients and mixing word-for-word. I don't have a water bath, and what I read was to just turn them upside down after putting the mix in the jar. I left them upside down about 5 or 10 minutes, then left the jar out on the counter until it was cool. Then placed in fridge. This was easy and delicious. I will DEFINITELY be making again. I honestly can't even eat store-bought jelly anymore. Thank you, poster!

Just made this strawberry jam for the firs time today, and as most have reviewed, it is absolutely delicious once set and chilled.  Thickness is fine as long as you let it boil for 10-15 mins or 220 F.  I used half the sugar and it was still too sweet.  I will try with 1/4 of what the recipe calls for next time as I don't like my jams super-sweet.  Also, the temperature never got to 220 for me (or I was not willing to wait), so I just let it boil for about 15 mins.  I recommend stirring often to avoid burning on the bottom, and definitely use a heavy saucepan - I used my cast iron.

This is a simple, wonderful recipe.  It gelled beautifully, and my son has already made toast so he could try it out!  Definitely use a heavy bottomed pot, and make sure it is a big one because the rolling boil stage will overflow a smaller pot.

The good, the bad, and the ugly.  The good:  Excellent recipe.  The bad:  I tried to get away with less sugar, that didn't work.  As I used the gel test I realized I needed more sugar...didn't use quite all of the recipe amount, but almost.  The ugly:  I didn't use a deep enough pot and as I kept it to a rolling boil and it reduced, it spit and spattered all over the stove.  All in all it was very worth it.  Gel test made all the difference, thank you.

I (like many of the other reviewers) had never made jam before, and it was so easy!  I cut the recipe in half, and based on other reviews, I only added 1 cup of sugar.  The jam is sweet and delicious.  My daughters absoutely loved it and kept wanting to lick the spoon!  Will definitely make this again.

It's delicious, but honestly, both my mother and I found it to be too sweet. I think I'm going to cut the sugar back by a cup next time I make it. I used frozen strawberries, and blended them in a food processor to smooth them out. It worked quite well.

Very flavorful!!!! and easy.  Like others suggested I cut sugar in half.  Started with 3 pounds of berries which crushed to 4 cups.  Used 1 cup sugar and I ended up with 3 (1/2 pint) jars.

This was my first time to make jam and it turned out great! I couldn't believe how relatively easy this was. This made 4 1/2 half pint jars for me. I already have requests to make for some friends.  Thanks for sharing!!

Whoa! Who knew you could make jam this easily! Instead of using fresh strawberries, I used thawed "frozen mixed berries". Following the advice of other reviewers, only 1 1/8 cups of sugar provided the perfect sweetness.(I can't imagine the sweetness factor with 4 cups! Yikes!!) So I cooked it, at a rolling boil, for about 20 minutes. Didn't use a thermometer or do a plate test. It was easy to tell it was cooked down enough, just by looking at it. After refrigerating it for a couple hours, it thickened up beautifully. Tastes great on toasted fresh baked bread. Mmmm.... Oh, I should mention that when it's boiling, it splatters like crazy, so wear grungy clothes that you don't mind getting stained. Protective oven mitts might not be a bad idea either if you don't want your hands splattered with boiling jam. Ow!

Loved this recipe. Added 1.5T fresh grated ginger for a little something different. The flavor contrast of the sweet strawberry with the the spicy ginger produces a really special end result.

This recipe is SUPER easy and SUPER yummy. One batch, for me, filled three small jelly jars.  The first time I made a batch I didn't have lemon juice, so I used lime juice and it was just as good, so FYI. :)  Enjoy and share!!

My family prefers the lower sugar jellies and jams, I cut the sugar in half and was very happy with the results.

This jelled perfectly, but I could tasted the lemon in it, and I wasn't crazy about that.  Other than that, great recipe!

ETA:  I take that lemon part back!  I have made this recipe several times since then, and I couldn't love it more!

fantastic!  I started with strawberries and realized I didn't have enough so I added blackberries and it turned out amazing.  The lemon juice really adds a distinct flavor.  i will make this over and over.

Definately one of the easiest ways to make Jam that I have come across.  Just made it tonight in about a 2 hours or so.  I noticed a lot of people had trouble with boil over.  As you bring to a rolling boil, have a spoon ready and skim off the foam bit by bit into a small container.  Also once you're at a rolling boil, you can turn the heat down just a touch to keep the jam inside your pot.  I have a gas stove so it's easier to control.  Hope this helps...and thanks for the recipe!

Can't get any easier than this! I pureed my berries in a blender and only used 3 cups of sugar (they were already very sweet). Let it boil without stirring down in a heavy stockpot - took about 15 minutes to reach 220. Perfect, delicious jam!

I'm hoping this jam sets in the fridge.  I did the 'plate' test & the line seemed to stay, so I poured the jam in to my jars.  I did only boil though for 15 minutes.  I was afraid to reboil in case I took the flavour out of the jam.  So far I have lovely syrup for ice cream sundaes!
I am wondering if the fact that I only used 3 cups of sugar versus the 4 cups has made a difference in the consistency???

This is great!  The jam set up better after 24 hours in the frig.  Make sure that you test it like the recipe says.  I did not have a thermometer and it still worked!  Really not much runnier then normal store jam.  We have to buy the expensive jams as my daughter is allergic to corn - what a treat and money saver this is for us!

Thankyou for such a great recipe. I am trying my  hand in making jam for the first time and it is soo yummy. I let it boil for more time and it became little thick, not runnyas others said. I am going to buy some more strawberries and make more jam and freeze them.Now who needs store bought jam.

Like many others, this was my first time making jam and it turned out great.  I'm not sure if my candy thermometre doesn't go above 100C but I didn't make it...  The jam still turned out wonderful and had a perfect jam texture.  I used about 1 cup less sugar than called for and it was still perfectly sweet.

I have never made homemade jam before and this turned out awesome.  Tastes good and looks just like the picture! My strawberries were fresh picked and really sweet so I only used 3 cups of sugar.

Fantastic recipe!  I really needed a recipe withough pectin because you can't buy it where I live.  This is great.  Although I did puree the strawberries instead of mashing because I don't like chunks of fruit in my jam/jelly.  The plate in the freezer trick... genius!

This is sooooooo good!  We picked strawberries yesterday and I made this recipe today.  Delicious!  Next time I will cut the sugar down by half, since it was super sweet (due to the berries being so ripe, I'm sure!).  MMMMMM, good!

Just made a batch of this and followed a previous poster's recommendation to add 3 cups of sugar instead of 4.   My berries were a little on the tart side,and still, to split hairs, the jam is a bit too sweet, so 4 stars.   I think it took longer to set and for some reason, I couldn't get it past 210 without it boiling over. When it reached 210, I started plate testing every 5 minutes, and it took 4 tries to get it to the right consistency.

 You have to watch it like a hawk, don't answer the phone or the door!  Fantastic recipe. I ended up with five 250 ml jars.  For beginners:  Watch it like a hawk and don't be afraid to use 3 cups of sugar instead of 4.  It was such a hit I am making another batch tomorrow.

Great recipe! This is the first time I have made jam and it was super easy to do. I started with the burner on low and gradually increased the heat over about 30 minutes. The berries hit a rolling boil at medium-high heat. Luckily I do have a thermometer that goes up to 300 degrees, so I was able to use that to hit the perfect temp. It did take about 4-5 minutes to go from 217 to 221, and putting it on glass plates would have been a hassle seeing as you have to keep stirring, so I would highly recommend using a thermometer! I was able to fill 9 4oz mason jars with this recipe. I used a water bath to can 8 of them, and kept one out for immediate eating. Its been 12 hours and the jam is the perfect consistency! Not runny at all. Nice and thick actually. Will absolutely make again!

I thought I'd surprise my Wife with some easy to make jam but I think this recipes instructions are dangerous!!!
I've tried to get this up to 220 degrees and it only gets to about 215.
Every time I try to increase the flame even a little bit it boils over.Also, you can't stir it or it boils over.
I've got a big mess to clean up now!!!!
EDIT: I finally let it sit and cook and it finally got up to 220 so I turned it off.
When it quit boiling, I found that there was a bunch of stuff stuck to the bottom, so I stirred it in with the rest of the jam. I hope it doesn't taste all burnt now !
Also, if you try to click to read the full review of other posters, nothing happens...

I will double the recipe next time as it only made 3 1/2 jelly jars. It took a while to get up to temp but had a good flavor and thickened up nicely. I put a little less sugar in and not quite 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I would make this again.

I don't have 2 pounds of strawberries, so I just halved the recipe. It still turned out great!
I was really wishing I could make some fresh jam, not to be frozen or whatever, but rather just where we could have some today for lunch and supper, with maybe enough left over for toast in the morning. I didn't want to waste pectin for something short-term, but didn't know how to do it, until now.
 You can buy cheap jelly for less, but this will be fresh, and nothing added -- no artificial anything!

I had some organic strawberries from the store in the fridge which needed to be used.  My strawberries are coming in now, and I can't bring myself to eat the ones from the store with lovely vine-ripe ones waiting for me!  But I didn't want to waste them and decided to try some jam.  I didn't have any pectin and didn't really want to use any and found this recipe here and in a few other places on-line otherwise, too.  I had only 1 1/2 pounds of strawberries, so I adjusted to 3 cups of sugar but used the juice of a whole, large lemon.  I didn't measure the juice.  I got busy, and it cooked to about 230, but it turned out great anyway.  Once I turned off the heat, I added some vanilla.  Oh, and I didn't crush the strawberries, I just used them chopped.  It will be a bit firmer than the orinal intended outcome, but the flavor is great, and I consider it a success.  I got 2 full pints from my batch.

Got this one done today.  I think it takes a little longer than the recipe says.  It turned out just fine and will be enjoyed by all.  The recipe is a bit like making peach spice jam.  It really takes a while to get to 220.  But once there you're golden.  I really liked our Canadian neighbor's review from Winnipeg.  Made do with whatever came out.  The idea of using it on pancakes or vanilla ice cream....mmmm, good.

This is really good.  I would rather not add pectin, so this works well for me.  I couldn't get the jam to go up to 220, so I put it on a bigger burner, and that's when I burned the jam.  It was burned only on the bottom, but it made the flavor not quite as good.  It set perfectly (only ever got to 216), so I think maybe my (new) thermometer is off.  This has a wonderful flavor, and it is quick and easy to make.  I am making more tonight.  Thanks for the recipe.  (I used strawberries that were starting to look a little tired, and the jam was awesome!)  Hubby raved about it (when he tasted it prior to the burn).  So I made another batch.  It is really good jam.  At the last, I poured the jam into five 1/2 pints, and then I put the remainder on the stove and added one tablespoon of bourbon.  I thought that the flavor was interesting, and we ended up with two jars of Bourbon Strawberry jam.  I will be interested to taste it once it sits for a few weeks, and we get to taste it.  (Tasted great today!)  This is a good, easy recipe.  Try it.  You'll like it.

This is my 1st time making a jam that required canning (made freezer jam once).  I love this recipe, its tasty, spreadable and easy!  I dbld the recipe (sort of) I used 5lbs of strawberries (girls and I went picking) and 8 cups of sugar, and 1/2 cup lemon juice (half fresh half concentrate).  I brought it to a boil ver slowly on low, and once it started boilling increased the temp to med and continued to let it boil (stirring occassionally) until it reached a temp of 220 (used an electric thermometer) and the plate method.  My recipe made 4.5pints.  Caution to those that want to rush this method, DON'T DO IT!  Letting it gradually come to temp gave it this deep maroon color, and the strawberries broke down beautifully!  I will def be making this again, and giving them as gifts!!!

220 F. I get it. Especially at high altitude a rolling boil will only make strawberry syrup. But the 220 degrees F reduces it so it thickens nicely. Thank you for this helpful tip! I made a half recipe and it worked great. A little too sweet for my taste; I will see if I can get it to thicken with less sugar next time.

I made this jam yesterday, the taste was great. I thought it was on the thin side though, I followed the recipe brought it to 220* everything. Don't know what I did wrong.

I used 1/2 c. Stevia (Truvia, actually) and lime juice as that's what I had.  This was just tart enough, just right for our tastes.  I froze it in small containers.  This would even be good as a filling for Strawberry Shortcake.

Whatever you do, follow the instructions and mash the berries. In my first batch, I pureed them and ended up with a very dense, sweet, not so tasty concoction. The second batch was perfect (I learned my lesson) and tasted GREAT! I loved the fresh berry taste, unlike the "stale" taste jams get sometimes. I love it and will use this recipe again next year.

2-3 cups of sugar is plenty. With the 4 cups you don't taste the strawberry as much.

One of the easiest recipes for jam/jelly I have seen! 

In the time it usually took me to prep or cook other recipes, this one was prepped, cooked, canned, processed through a water bath and sitting upside down on the counter to cool!

 I just started canning and making jellies and jams, but this was uber fast... Even for a noobie! Bonus: It tastes just as good as anything in the store (or better) and has far less ingredients and no preservatives.

Delicious!! I was surprised that a non-pectin jam would thicken, but it did-perfectly. Full of strawberry flavor-not too sweet. Many recipes call for 2 cups of fruit, so I wonder if those reviewers who say this is too sweet were sure to use 2 POUNDS of berries. A keeper of a recipe.

i had never made any kind of jam in my life as i thought the process would be tedious and that it may not turn out well.  i tried this jam using only the half the quantity of ingredients and it turned out very well.  though it did take quite a bit of time and had to stir continuously to avoid burning, the effort was worth it.  now i plan on going strawberry picking to make and bottle this jam and use it as a part of any gift basket to share it with family and friends.

YUM! I made just a half batch of this recipe, used nly 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was amazing! I had some last night when it cooled and just a teeny bit on toast this morning. Better than store bought and oh so early. I am going to a friends for  dinner this weekend and bringing a jar as a thankyou , just because it was so easy to make I have to share the treat! Thanks for posting!

Strawberries are peak in Florida right now, so I bought a flat at the produce market to make a couple jams and maybe a pie or cobbler.  Not sure what happened, but this did not solidify.  I followed the directions precisely, even using a thermometer and cooking to 220.  What I ended up with is a beautiful batch of strawberry syrup.  It will be used on pancakes, waffles, and french toast, but it certainly is no jam.  Have to be honest and tell you that I don't have much experience in canning.  Last year I had a blogger tell me that the humidity can have an effect on how jellies and jams turn out, and it was raining most of yesterday (house windows were open a bit), so maybe that's it.  Little bit of a disappointment considering all of the success other reviewers had with this recipe.

Very simple and very good.  I do wish I had taken my own advice by skimming the foam off the top.  I had no trouble getting the jam to thicken.  The color is pretty and the taste is exactly what I was looking for to give to my granddaughter.  My only suggestion would be to add skimming the foam off the top before putting the jam in jars.  Otherwise, perfect!

I wish I'd cooked it much longer than the forty-five minutes I gave it, as it fell short of jelling nicely.  It is a bit tart, but it's different and that's nice.  I did cut back on the sugar as advised, and found it still quite sweet.

This is such an easy recipe and great for someone trying canning for the first time.  I used end of the season strawberries that were quite tart, so the full four cups of sugar worked just fine for a just sweet enough jam with lots of strawberry flavor.  If the recipe is followed and the jam gets to 220 degrees, it should set up perfectly like mine did.  Delicious!

A little too sweet for me and kinda runny. I added cornstarch to thicken it up a bit...turned out great! Will add a LOT less sugar next time.

First time to try jam and it flopped.  It is more like syrup instead of jam.  Great flavor though.  So what did I do wrong when I followed the directions word for word?  Will try another one next time, maybe this time with the pectin in it.

I tried the recipe and i absolutely love it! Has anyone tried it with splenda instead of sugar? I have a few diabetic family members and was wondering if it turned out all the same if you didn't use real sugar.

I have made this jam twice now - the first time it was running and the second time it was perfect. It is essential that the jam comes to a rolling boil and reaches 220 degrees as the recipe says - I didn't do that the first time. I removed the "foam" that formed as it boiled and that may have helped too.

I'll give it four stars for basic ratio--but I shook it up, and my jam was delicious. To make a small batch (1 used and washed out Robertsons jar), I used a pound of strawberries chopped coarsely, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2 Tbs lemon juice. After the strawberries had softened up a bit in the rolling boil, I mashed them up. My jam is not translucent, but it is pulpy and absolutely delicious. Try it with some (toasted) English toasting bread and butter, or with the toast and a dollop of cream.

I tripled this recipe, but only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar for each 2 lbs. of strawberries, and it is plenty sweet.  I also used both a thermometer, and the frozen plate test. I was worried about scorching, so I didn't turn my heat up all the way, and after 25 minutes of boiling, I was just under 215 degrees and tried the frozen plate test.  It was probably done at that point, but because I had read that others said to get to 220 degrees, I thought that I would let it boil for another couple of minutes. When I went to stir it again, just after a minute or so, there was a noticeable difference in the consistency, and it seemed to be a little stuck to the bottom of the pot, and when I checked the spoon the jam sticking to the bottom was burning.  I immediately turned it off, and did not do any more stirring. In the end, the jam is definitely sweet enough, thick enough, but has a slight scorched taste. It is still pretty good, but I won't be giving any as gifts as I planned.I have given this a four star rating because it is pretty easy, and tastes good, but it calls for WAY too much sugar.

This came out perfect.  I also put only about two cups of sugar and it still came out really sweet.  I have made it twice and both times it came out great.  My family love it.

This was so easy.  I followed some advice from other reviews and used only 2 cups sugar and cooked the mix for 20 minutes.  It looked done but I did the plate test anyway.  Really tasty jam.

Excellent! I put the strawberries in my vitamix added the lemon juice and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (I think I'll reduce it more next time.). The cook time was just over 20 minutes. It thickened nicely and tastes delicious! Next time I think I will crush the berries by hand rather than using the blender so that I will have more chunks in the jam.

This was really easy to make although VERY sweet. The freezer plate test worked out really well, I ended up cooking it about 10 minutes longer than when I would have pulled it off. I will make again but I will reduce the sugar probably in half.

Great recipe! I've never made jam before, so it was difficult to know when to stop boiling, but the freezer plate test solved that problem. Also, I used 3 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 4 and it was perfect.

I cut the sugar down also.  I used 2 3/4 cup and it was awesome.  This is a great recipe.  Also my first time making jam!

Way too sweet! Took suggestion from Aussie Mom and added a little less than 3 1/2 cups of sugar, still really sweet. Easy, still waiting for jam to set up properly.

Very delicious and easy. I could stand it to be a bit less sweet and a bit more thick, but it still rates 4 stars with me!

I really liked this recipe. Its not like I have a lot of experience cooking strawberries cause I'm not so fond of them, but this recipe really made me change my mind. I didn't think it needed that much sugar (cause I was gonna use it next day) so I cut it down to half. Still came out pretty sweet-just perfect.

I AM 13 AND I MADE THIS JAM WITH MY AUNT. I LESSENED THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR AND PUREED IT. IT TOOK ABOUT 1 HOUR TO REACH 220. THIS JAM IS DELICIOUS AND EASY. WE MADE ALOT OF IT AND CANNED IT. WE PLAN TO PUT IT ON CHEESECAKE, DOUGHNUTS, SCONES, TOAST, AND MUCH MORE.

Amazing! I used raspberries and strawberries together and it was excellent. I only used half of the sugar and it still was sweet enough. I didn't have a thermometer and used the plate test - it worked great. 15 minutes of boiling did it. Will made this again for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a wonderfully good & simple recipe.  For a touch of difference change the sugar to honey and use lime juice.  If you make your own Rose & sweet clover honey it is even better.

I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar but I think that really messed up the consistency.  Mine it very watery but good.  Maybe next time I will add some cornstarch to thicken it up.

I've never canned anything before so I was a bit afraid.  Once I got started it was real easy.  Got the plate testing down on the first try.  I had bought some small jars with the latch lid and rubber seals to put this in for Christmas gifts.  I had a friend who does canning all the time suggest a wax cap just to be safe.  I did that and everything turned out perfect.  It was very good and even my very picky husband said it was good.  I wasn't aiming for anything spectacular...it tastes like strawberry jelly and that's exactly what I was aiming for.  Next time I will have to try some raspberries in it or blueberries too.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I have made strawberry jam before and this recipe did not gel at all.  It has a GREAT flavor but I should have added a package of pectin to the jam.  I will try this same recipe again with the pectin, I am sure it will be great.

This recipe changed my life. Since I started making it, I have gained 5 pounds and love handles. My husband came back, kids visit me again, and my depression is no longer existing. Strawberry Jam? More like Miracle Sauce. Love it, totally recommend!!

This turned out amazing. It was my first time making jam and I had a lot of questions but through trial and error here is what i figured out worked best for me: I macerated the strawberries in a freezer bag the night before with 2 cups of sugar. I have done this recipe with half the sugar and 3 cups of sugar and really you should adjust for the sweetness of your berries, keeping in mind that using less sugar means less jam. Personally I like between 3-4 cups of sugar per batch, and I use farm bought California strawberries. I cook in a dutch oven so its easier to reduce the jam. I use bottled lemon juice (to guarantee the acid content) and didn't have a problem with foam. Last but not least, the plate test is VERY important. Don't get discouraged even if you've been hard boiling for 15+ minutes, keeping in mind that a tall narrow stockpot will take longer to reduce the water content of your jam. When its nearing doneness, the jam gets darker and clearer and the proportion of strawberries looks smaller. 
I didn't have the highest hopes for the consistency of this jam, but mine turned out beautiful and just as thick as store jam, the key is how long you boil and what you're using to cook it. This jam tastes so fresh and wonderful. All my kids love it, I don't have to feel guilty giving it to them, there is no high fructose corn syrup and yes its sweet but its not as though they are eating it straight from the jar. Wonderful, thank you. I will make this my summer project with my

I tried this recipe yesterday with the remainder of the strawberries I could fight the birds for and got enough for only 2 cups of mashed berries.  So I adjusted the recipe for that.  I was absolutely amazed at how easy it was and how pretty it is in my jars.  I tasted it after the "freeze test" and it is absolutely delicious.  It set almost instantly after the jars cooled and I have to say, my Mother-In-Law couldn't have done any better than me if we were in a contest!  If you're looking for an easy, nearly guaranteed recipe, try it.  If it fails for you, you probably didn't get it to 220 degrees, but you can still put it on pancakes or waffles!  This is my new favorite recipe for strawberry jam.  In a couple of weeks I'll use it for raspberry jamm too.

2 tips. First, use a much much larger pot to cook the strawberry mix in. It bubbles up enormously and takes a good 20 minutes before it starts reducing. Second, use a thermometer that attaches to your pot. After 200, each degree higher changed the color and consistency of the jam. Without the thermometer you won't know when the magic 220 arrives. Made 2 1/2 12 oz jars. Tastes very rich!

I've used this recipe twice now, and it makes a jam with perfect consistency - I just add less sugar (about 2-3 cups). Also, I don't have a thermometer, so I used a hint that I found on a food blog to tell when the jam is ready to come off the stove. Put a plate in the freezer, and when you want to test the jam, drop a spoonful on the plate. If it doesn't run, and forms a film on top, the jam is ready.

Just finished a small batch, turned out great! I only used 3/4 lb. of strawbs, mashed 'em, sugared them to taste while boiling and don't forget the lemon juice, used about 1/2 tsp and it gave it THAT flavor--you'll know when you taste it while boiling it down. So good and so easy! Cherry jam--you're next!

I usually like to give a recipe the benefit of the doubt when it's got such high reviews, but this time I wish I would have listened to the negative comments.  I usually make the Ball strawberries freezer jam, but I wanted to try this recipe in hopes of freeing up some freezer space.  I doubled this recipe (maybe that's where I went wrong?) but followed the instructions precisely.  This recipe is WAY too sweet and doesn't have the thickness that I want.

This is great!  I'm trying to cut back on sugar so I used 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 the amount of lemon juice.  It makes 3 cups this way.  Thanks for the recipe and thanks for the footnote on testing for jelling.  Very helpful!

I only used 3 cups of sugar and I'm glad I did because it was definitely sweet enough. I might even only use 2 cups next time and see how it comes out. I don't think I boiled it long enough as it came out a little watery. It still tastes better than any jam from the store!

I tried this recipe because I was going out of town and had a ton of strawberries that I didn't want to go to waste.  I was in a rush and had no pectin, so decided to try this recipe.  I should note that this was my first time attempting to make jam.  However, a previous review states that this recipe is too lacking in detail- and I STRONGLY agree.  I read a lot of the other reviews on this and realized how much I was missing.  One I should have read though (wish I had read sooner!) was about gradually increasing the heat.  I waited for the sugar to dissolve and then went full up to high heat.  All looked great until about 8 minutes into my ten minutes.  All of a sudden I had a black, bubbling, smelly mess.  I had burnt my jam- burnt it real bad!  I highly suggest gradually increasing the heat and going slow and steady- at about a 7 with an electric stove top (much prefer gas).  Keep stirring and you will feel when it is thick enough.  Basically only follow the ingredients on here and not much else...Additionally, if you do burn it, get the pot, spoon, spatula, whatever, and put it in the sink with HOT water and soap and start scrubbing because this burnt mess sticks to EVERYTHING, and, well, good luck getting it off...

I really likes this recipe. Mostly because it didn't seem too sweet. Take your time getting it up to temp and it will all be just fine. My son said it was, "sooo good".

Thank you for a fabulous recipe! This tastes incredible and is so easy to make.  My son loved it and did not believe I made it.  The directions are a bit vague but I still ended up with some of the best jam ever!

I made this recipe to give out as Christmas gifts. It was my first time making jam. Like other reviews said, I needed to cook it down longer so it would gel up once it was cool. I also put 1/4 of a lemon rind in it while it was cooking down to add some more natural pectin. This did help it to thicken up. I didn't use as much sugar as it called for. I used my food processor for the strawberries and 1 cup of sugar for every 2 cups of strawberries after they were chopped up. The jam turned out amazing. I will make it instead of buying from now on. I froze mine, so that saved a lot of the work of canning the jam that I kept for myself. Delicious!

Easy and Yummy! I have never made jam before and this was soooo good! FYI I only used 2 cups of sugar and mine is still sweet, 4 cups in my opinion is way too much sugar. It took a about 25 minutes to boil, be patient and keep stirring so it won't burn. I also did the plate test it was helpful but you can see it when it starts to really thicken.
Hope this helps enjoy!

Just made this, was easy and came out perfect. Great recipe. 
But the instructions are lacking for first-time jam-makers. 
I found 2-3 other reviews here very, very helpful to read first and made notes beforehand -- these proved invaluable and this probably would have flopped without their advice.  
Particularly not being in a hurry on the boiling, stirring often, using both a thermometer and the frozen plate test to ensure done and the right consistency. Also very good advice here regarding the actual canning and storage.

This is one of my favorite jam recipes.  So easy and no need to sterilize or add pectin or do anything more difficult than slice and stir.  My kids were so happy strawberries were back in season and I just made my first batch of the year.  
I tend to add less sugar if the berries are very sweet.  For my batch I had very sweet berries so halved the sugar. It still comes out very thick.  Also, I add the lemon juice after the jam has cooked, while it cools. Once cool I put in containers, some in the fridge and some in the freezer (though they don't stay in the freezer long since the kids eat it fast).

This made 6 small 8 oz jars of jam.  It appears runny when done but sets once it cools in the jars.  Next time I may need to let it keep at rolling boil  bit longer.  Not quite as thick as we like it.Water bath for processing was 15 minutes in boiling water.

The only heavy-bottomed pan I had was a huge stock pot, so I opted for a smaller pot that had a thin bottom.  The pot heated up quicker than expected, and I ended up with a super thick jam... so thick that once it set, it won't spread; I have to dig it out of the jar with a spoon.  That being said, the taste of the jam is delicious; I will be making this again, but I'm cutting down the time by half.  

I did make a change to the recipe - I used 1/4 of the sugar, but everything else was the same, including the way I sterilized the jar, canned it, etc.

Everyone in the family LOVES IT! :) Even my picky youngest daughter (9) who doesn't like jelly on anything liked it on her biscuit one morning! I've canned several jars of it this season and plan on making more as the strawberries keep coming it. We prefer to go all organic but, to each his own. Just "better" for you.

This jam is amazing.  I had four pints of strawberries that would have gone bad if I did not do something with them soon.  I followed the recipe but added the juice of half an orange since I only had about 1/8 cup of lemon juice.  I boiled in a large enameled cast iron, five quart pot (went slowly from low to medium high) for about 1 hour, until the mixture was reduced by more than half.  I think this eliminated the "runny" texture some experienced.  I also filled the canning jars almost to the top and then turned upside down.  So much easier than the boiling water method.  Besides, I don't think this jam will last long enough to go bad!  Made the "Old-Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake"  from this site (but as more tradisional individual portions) and the jam spread on these, just cooled from the oven, was a real treat.  Will definately make this again.

Very tasty recipe!  I had 1 and 1/2 pounds of berries and I cut the sugar WAY back - to just 1 cup.  Plenty sweet for our taste.  I added a dash of vanilla bean paste for added flavor.  Only fault was there was no direction given on processing time.  I am new to canning so this would have been helpful.  There is a chart for processing times and is based on your sea level.  A simple search will tell you what your level is.

I tried this recipe. I was my first attempt to make any kind of jam/jelly/relish.
I was very happy with the result. I followed the recipe and tips from the other reviewers. I cooked the mixture for 30-40 mins and it was perfect .
Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice now.  Thank heaven I read the reviews first because I actually reverse the berries and sugar amounts.  4 pounds of berries to 2 cups of sugar and it's perfect.  Yes it's runny in the beginning, but a week later.. after being in the fridge it's thicker.  Also, use a larger pot (I use a dutch oven).  When it boils, it can rise up pretty high in the pot.  Love this recipe.  Can't wait to try other berries this summer.

this as fantastic! I reduced the sugar, like other reviewers, and had to boil a little longer than usual to get it to the jell point. it still turned out a little softer than store-bought or pectin jams, but I prefer it soft. it spreads much better on toast/sandwiches when soft. I pureed my mixture athe end s there were no chunks, then strained out the seeds. my 2 oldest kids looooved this jam, and my 5-year-old told me I'm not allowed to but jam anymore because this is the best, and I agree! I'm using this same recipe tomorrow but using peaches in place of strawberries- thanks for such a perfect and versatile recipe! can't wait to try with other berries/ston fruits!

A little runny, but delicious.  The right amount of sugar.  I will make again, but I think I'll let it cook longer and keep larger chunks.  I was able to make 3 full pint jars.

This jam is fab!!! I used berries that were firm and ripe, or just under ripe. I also added a 1/2 tsp unsalted butter to the mix, to reduce foaming. I stirred the mixture for 5 min before putting into jars. I love this jam & intend to make it for years to come!

So this jam was amazing, and it does take really long to get up that last 10 degrees.  I have given most of my jars away and so far everyone cant stop eating it!!! Plus i have used it for recipes that call for jam and it works great when its being baked.

I am not sure why; but this took forever to get to 220 degrees!  I also found that it is SO sweet.  I could hardly taste the strawberries.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with 4 pint jars. Perhaps it will taste more like strawberry after it cools.

This turned out wonderful.  I ended up using 3 lbs. of berries, a blend of strawberries, blackberries and blueberries, and three cups of sugar, and about 1/3 cup of lime juice.  I wonder if this freezes well?  Also, it never came up to 220 degrees!  It got really thick though so I ended up using the freezer test even though I had a thermometer.

Beautiful!!!  And if you mess up like I did the first time and make it too thin.....it makes the best strawberry topping for ice cream or pancakes or as I used it...for the filling between layers of straw berry birthday cake and then drizzled on top of the cake's cream cheese frosting.

Wonderful!!! And so easy. Thickened up right away and tastes great. I made two batches and didn't have enough strawberries for the second batch....I added a cup of blueberries and used white balsamic instead of lemon juice. I think I may use less sugar and just cook a bit longer next time. YUM!

turned out very tasty!!! I cut in half, used 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar 2 1/2 cups of white sugar, and I slightly chopped starberries in my bullet blender then mashed larger bits with the back of a fork. I stirred a lot with my wooden spoon and used the smell and look to make sure it did not burn. I set a timer for 15 mins as well. Very happy with my first ever jam!

This was my first jam. I'm 13, and it was VERY easy to make. It has ann excellent flavour. I scaled the recipe down, and it asked for 1 cup sugar, but i gave somewhere along 4/5. I boiled it for a bit too long, however, so it's a bit hard. I'm still giving the recipe 5 stars because that's my fault. I did the jelling test and sterilzed the jar in boiling water as other users reccommended, but I didn't turn it upside down because I didn't make much and it'll be gone in less than a week. Wonderful.

This jam is awsome, really easy and tastes great! I have made it twice now.  It never did get to  105 I stopped mixing at 100 and still turned out good. Tastes like Smuckers!!! You have to try it!  Oh and I made it with some frozen strawberries that I had from summer and you would never know the difference!

This is the best jam ever! I used a little less then 3 cups sugar. And stirred it on medium heat for about 45 minutes. No hot water bath and it turned out great!!

Fantastic flavor, easy to do.  Took a little longer than I expected, especially since my candy thermometer broke!  Other than that, it turned out fantastic.  You could probably cut back on the sugar a bit, but I like mine sweet.  Fantastic, thanks for sharing!

I just made this for the first time, I'm a novice jam maker.  I followed the directions exactly, boiled to 220 degrees.  I used strawberries we had picked and then flash froze.  they have been in the freezer for about 3 weeks.  The jam got very dark in color and I ended up with 20oz total finished product.  It did set and tastes good.  I'm disappointed in the amt for the effort and wonder what I did wrong.

2nd year making this jam and I love it!  I only added 1/3 of the sugar that the recipe calls for and it tastes WONDERFUL!  Picked strawberries that day and canned after the kids went to bed.  This year I used about 7 or 8 pounds for this recipe.  Yum!  Tastes fresh and sweet with a little tartness - like fresh berries.  I used a handful of un-ripe fruit because they have more pectin.  I didn't wait until it was 220, I did a freezer/plate test - a little different from the one suggested here.  I put a teaspoon on a plate, put in the freezer and when it was cool ran my finger through it and when it didn't run back together I started canning.  I like it a little thinner than store bought jam.  I can't stop eating it!

Love this recipe!  Made a batch with this recipe and another with pectin.  My batch with pectin did not set!  It tastes good but...this recipe without the added pectin was amazing!  The taste much more vibrant.  The other batch tastes like flavored sugar water. Though it takes more strawberries and longer cooking time, I will continue to use this recipe! Thank you

1st time making jam...this recipe is awesome!  I took some popular advice and used a bit less sugar.  Still came out very sweet (but that's not an issue for me!).  Make sure to let it boil for at least 20 minutes-use a long handled wooden spoon to avoid splashes of sticky boiling lava.  Will absolutely make again ASAP!

This was fabulous!  Couldn't give 5 stars though, because I think 4 cups of sugar is outrageous.  I used 2 1/4 cups and it's still too sweet. (And usually I LOVE sweet).  I will definitely make again, but will use even less sugar.  I think if you have store-bought berries, you probably need more sugar (still not 4 cups), but mine were picked from the farm that morning, and were really sweet on their own.

First time making jam and could not be more thrilled with the results.  Bought 10 pints organic strawberries (~15 lbs.) from my local farmer's market 2nd week of May that were picked a few days before, so very ripe.  Hulled, washed, then divided them all between four rimmed baking sheets and mashed them with a masher.  Great fun.  Used 1/2 the sugar, 16 cups total for 10 pints of berries, 2 cups lemon juice.  Had to divide between two stock pots.  When boiling, had to alternate between letting it settle and letting it boil when it was foamy, but eventually the foam dissipated and it reduced to almost half the volume by the time it got to be "jam."  Only ever got to 217 degrees, but the freezer test came out perfect.  Stirred for an eternity and did not leave it for a second except to grab the frozen saucers from the freezer.  Had to stir at least 25 minutes, maybe longer.  Will definitely try this recipe again.  It is beautiful, spreadable jam with a wonderful color and texture.  I ended up with 20 1-cup jam jars at the end.  I could eat it by the spoonful!!

Super easy and turned out delish.  I agree about the sugar.  I cut way back on the sugar and boiled it extra long.  I knew I wouldn't be preserving the jam, just putting it in the fridge and eating it up, so I figured less sugar would be ok.  Made biscuits this morning to go with the jam...yumm-o.

It's strawberry jam.  My only issue was the sweetness.  I only did 3 cups of sugar, and it was still very sweet.  It's good to me, but if I had done 4 cups as the recipe states, it might have been too sweet.

Wow - so good!  So easy, too.  I have made this recipe quite a few times and it comes out perfect every time.  If you shorten the cooking time its great for pancake syrup. Either way, its really good!

I have been making this jam for years.  It´s so easy to make and so delicious.  The only thing that I do diferent is  letting the mixture  rest for a few hours before cooking it.  It really sets the flavor.

I never made jam before but I used this recipe on my homegrown strawberries and it turned out great! The jam set perfectly and my family raved about how great it tasted.  I'm giving it four stars because other reviewers noted that the original recip was too sweet, so I cut down the sugar by about a third. Based on the results I'm sure the original would indeed have been too sweet.  I also added a knob of butter at the very end to cut down the foam on top.

I have to rate this as a three star, because of the conflicting amount of sugar that was suggested in reviews versus the recipe amount. This left me a little frustrated and I choose to cut the sugar down. This recipe left me  wondering if the 4 cups of sugar is needed because preservatives usually call for high amounts of sugar and salt in order to "preserve" the preserve? It is my hope that someone with great experience making preserves submits a lower sugar recipe that does not call for so many revisions.

This is my first try at canning and making jam, wow, this is fantastic. It's so easy but i did put in a small packet of pectin and it was delicious. If you have never tried doing jam please try this one. My grandaughter helped and she said it looked so easy Nanny. I've found the longer it stays in the frig the better it tastes, but trut me it didn't last long. My neighbor said it reminded him of his Mom's receipe and said thanks for bringing back the taste of his Mom's strawberry jam. I made blueberry jam a few weeks later using the same receipe and it was just as tasty.

I made this jam yesterday & it did turn out really well. I have been wanting to make jam for a while, but was intimidated. I was worried it would not thicken, but the next day it was fine. I thought it tasted good & I followed the recipe exact.

So far so good!  I also cut the sugar in half, based on most reviews, and it did take about 20 minutes to boil.  I used a candy thermometer to get to 220 degrees, but it must have been faulty.  I used the plate test, as others suggested, and that worked great.  Its still very sweet with half the sugar!  I picked strawberries this morning at a local farm, so I'm very excited to try jam for the first time!  I only made a half recipe, not wanting to waste strawberries if it didn't work, but I think it worked well so I'll have to make more now!    Thanks for a great recipe.

Good flavor - but mine turned out to be a 'strawberry topping' instead of jam, and I do have a candy thermometer and followed the recipe - well, it'll be good on ice cream

Soooo easy to make and delicious! I used frozen strawberries (I thawed them in the microwave first). Follow the instructions carefully and it will work great! Mine yield a large Mason jar (quart size), so about 4 cups of jam! Yummy!

I haven't tasted my results yet, but they look great in the jars! It did take quite a while for it to get from 215 to 220 and also for the water to boil for the water bath. However, the process was pretty simple, just takes time!

This recipe doesn't get as thick as store-bought jam but I like it that way.  You can test the consistancy of the jam by putting a dab of it on a cold plate and putting it in the refrigerator for a minute or two.  If you can run your finger through it and it stays, it's thick enough.  It made a little over two pints.

Made my first jar and tested it on the kids. After tasting mine they INSISTED that there was something wrong with the store bought jar. I tried both myself and there was nothing wrong with it. It just seemed bland and yucky after trying mine. 3 picky girls turned on the brand they have been eating for years in 1 second flat!

I love this Jam! So easy to make and as long as you cook it long enough it is very forgiving. I have doubled, tripled and even quadrupled the recipie with great results. I go berry picking in the am and then make it into jam that same day. Berries are so fresh and juicy that I use 1 cup less of sugar per 4 cups berries. I also use my emersion blender during the boiling time to give it a smooth consistency because my family does not like chunky jam. Very, very good!

For those of us who are "pectin challenged" this is the perfect recipe.  The jam was sweet but I like sweet things so that was a plus for me!  Very easy and very yummy.  Mine set up just fine but you do have to make sure to boil for the full amount of time/temp.  Thanks for a great recipe

*!*!*!*I LOVED IT!*!*!*Great recipe.  I loved the fact that it doesn't have Pectin as well.  I had more than the 2 lbs, they equalled out to 6 cups, but I left the rest the same, for the sugar and lemon juice.  It tastes great on the "Amish White Bread" recipe also found on this site.

I used a candy thermometer to make sure I had the right temp and it still didn't turn out for me. It's more like fruit leather than jam. If I nuke it in the microwave for 20 seconds then it is spreadable. The taste is terrific...that's why I gave it 4 stars.

I've never made jam before, and couldn't believe how easy it was! I cut the recipe in half and it still worked very well, but didn't take as long to cook. Definitely watch the time if you're going to reduce the recipe! The freezer trick was great, since the thermometer I was using was a little hard to tell when it was exactly 220 degrees.

I made this easier by using a food processor on pulse rking in 2 batches.  You can leave it a little chunky as the berries break down while cooking.  I used a thermometer and it came out perfect with rave reviews!

This was great... Halved the sugar because my strawberries were especially sweet and ripe. This jam does have a soft texture, but that didn't keep my fiancee from eating it out of the jar with a spoon. Delicious!

This was my first attempt at making jam and it seemed to work out very well. I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and used the jam setting on my bread maker for the cooking. It didn't seem to set all that thickly, but the taste was fantastic, so it's all good!

I did not change a thing, this recipe is easy and delicious. Nothing in any gourmet store can touch it, my family of four went through the first jar in a day! Thank you to the O.P. for this one, I don’t see any need to try anything else. Noms!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now as written for gifts and everyone loves this jam (I'm always asked for it). This year I changed it up a little and used 3 lb frozen triple berry blend (raspberry, blueberry, blackberry) and yielded 5 half pint (8 oz) jars. It was excellent! Do not reduce the sugar as it acts as the preservative (see other canning sites and note they all call for the same amount of sugar). You shouldn't have a problem with the consistency as long as you boil hard. You'll know when it's close to being done when stirring does not stop/slow down the boiling. I used a thermometer this year and noted it felt like forever to reach 220 F once I hit 215 F (temp increased about 1 degree every few minutes). Followed the plate test and it was perfect jam again! Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe as written. This jam is very good.  I did not find it to be too sweet.  I got four 8 oz jars and almost filled a 4 oz jar from the 2 pounds (4 cups) of strawberries.  I just put the 4 oz jar into  the refrigerator since it wasn't full enough to seal. My strawberries were medium to large.  

I had another 1 lb container of strawberries so I made a second batch by halving the recipe.  Both batches turned out great.  I used a candy thermometer to ensure I reached 220 degrees.

This was a simple recipe for a novice like myself. Simple,  not easy; but with a little research and reading through the comments, I managed my messy way through it!
Some advice that I definitely wished I had followed from the comments would have been to use a blender. My berries were ripe, but could've used another day or two to make them easier to mash. So, if you have the opportunity to wait for them to be a little more over-ripened, that may make the difference. 
Overall, I would call it a success. As someone who has never met a too-rich dessert, I must say that this borders on overly sweet - VERY sugary. I love strawberry flavored candy, though. So, I'll just have to wait until I can spread it on some toast or biscuits with butter. :)

The length of time for the hot water bath is not included in the recipe.  I had to search for other strawberry jam to find it. 

Otherwise it was easy and delicious!

I canned this last summer for the first time making strawberry jam.  I love it!  Simple and easy.  Very few ingredients.  I did cut down the sugar to 3 1/2 cups (others suggested this).  I just made 8 1/2 pints ...however, I did not double the recipe because another review suggested that would be a bad idea.  It is delicious.  I prefer canning to freezer jam because it just tastes better and keeps indefinitely.   I also made strawberry syrup by just bringing the same recipe to a boil for a few minutes and putting in pint jars for pouring over pancakes, ice cream, etc.  It is a thin syrup with the strawberries right in it...love it.

I followed the instructions as directed. The recipe makes 4 1/2 pints. My son licked the spoon and he loved the taste, not too much sugar even though a lot of people have said it was too much sugar. I believe it just depends on your taste and how much sugar to put in the recipe. I plan to make more using the same recipe for peaches.

I wound up with extremely thick, sweet jam with a burnt flavor.  I was using home-grown strawberries, which I thought were pretty sweet, so I reduced the sugar to just a little over 3 cups.  It is still a bit too sweet for my liking.

--It would have been extremely helpful had the recipe pointed out that the jam will quadruple in volume as it boiled.  I came very close to having it boil over on my stove.   You need a HUGE pot.

--The thermometer was useless.  By the time my jam had reached 215 it was burning.    The only thing the thermometer did was hinder me from stirring  where it was clipped on.  In the future, I will watch for the point where the big frothy bubbles subside, as that was when the jam had started to thicken and darken in color, but before it burned.  I wish I had pulled it then.

--The freezer test was was too stringent.  Even though the two sides were still slightly oozing together, I pulled it because the jam was burning and I couldn't stir fast enough to keep up..  When it cooled, it was too thick to spread easily.  Perhaps there is more natural pectin in fresh, sweet berries?

Although I have canned and preserved, for over 60 years, I never made strawberry preserves, before.  
First, I put 4 pounds of hulled, washed, sliced strawberries, in my highest, stainless steel Cuisinart stock pot, and crushed them, with a potato masher.  
Second, I added 8 cups of white, granulated sugar, and a scant cup of freshly squeezed, strained lemon juice.  
Rather than stir it, I continued to mash the mixture, as it came to a rolling boil, when not covered, with the pot lid that I placed on top of a large, stainless steel splatter guard.  
Third, I washed and sterilized the jam and salsa jars, that I had, on hand, along with their lids, and my stainless steel funnel.  
Although I also processed the first filled jars, in boiling water, for 15 minutes, because I am giving the remaining ones, as gifts, to Grand Singers, e.g., our 6 directors and accompanists, at this afternoon's first, in place, full concert rehearsal, I skipped this step.  
Third, I stuck store bought labels, on top of each jar, that were filled out, with a black, extra fine Sharpie, saying, "Strawberry Preserves, from the Kitchen of Jeanine Seeley," before placing them into new brown sandwich bags, with a personalized thank you note stapled, to the folded-over top, of each one.  Although these preserves were a tad sweet, and thin, they were relatively easy, to prepare.

This recipe  did not call for pectin. Either way. I use pectin for a better jell. I use before I stir in sugar. I give the pectin time to cook then stir in sugar.  Boil to rolling boil then time for 3 min. Test small dollop of jelly in freezer for 1-2 min. This will determine if you cooked your jelly/ jam long enough. Fill jars. Tighten lids, flip upside down 5 min. Turn upright wait for the lids to pop. Store in fidge.

It was a pretty simple recipe, and first time I made jam. I added only 3 cups of sugar like others suggested, and it was perfect. I will make it again.

An awesome recipe.  It was simple, easy and the jam tastes great.  I did the plate in the freezer test after 10 minutes and the consistency was perfect.

Never made jam ...never ever...
Was out of organic sugar so I used organic brown sugar. Cut the sugar by 1 cup. Used a whole lemon rather than reconstituted.
Totally amazing. 
For those who dont like it sweet use the white sugar.
Very, very proud of myself.

AWESOME!!!  EXACTLY the jam my grandma & aunts used to make!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing!  A canning tip:  I filled 8oz canning jars to the "line", made sure the edges were clean on the jar, lidded it and set it on the counter upside down.  Within 10 minutes, it was sealed!

Good recipe. I doubled this recipe and only used 1 3/4 cup of sugar total! It would of been way to sweet. I liked the consistency, it's wasn't to gel like or super watery.

Worked! I added about 2C extra berries and only mashed half. I too reduced the sugar, but by only 1C as that's what helps thicken it. I simmered for 20 min, and used the cold plate to test it.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was the sugar content. However, I cut the sugar in half, pulsed strawberries in food processor and Jam was amazing.

It is a bit late to make Ontario strawberry jam but I thought that I'd give it a go with California strawberries. I didn't quite have enough lemon juice- shy about 2 TBSP; and I had to use half brown sugar and half white granulated (and used 2.5 cups) :-/ 
(This was not exactly a planned jam making adventure!) 
I added a splash of Elderflower syrup to make up for the missing lemon juice. 
I used my immersion blender to mash the berries up once they had begun to get soft. I swear my thermometer is off b/c after 1.5 hrs of a rolling boil it never rose past 205. I did the plate test and it passed. Just put it in the jars, so I'll see how it sets...

Doesn't yield 5 cups, but it's easy and without the cost of pectin, more than makes up for it.

This was my first time making any kind of jam or jelly and it was a big hit!  I didn't know what the author meant when she said to "process" but the 2 most recent reviews helped me with that :)  Jam turned out perfectly and everyone loved it.

Delicious taste!  We tasted it out of the pot and loved the flavor. Easy to make.I'm waiting for the jam to set-it's been over 36 hours. Still thick shake consisitency at this point. Was wondering if it doesn't set is there any way to save this batch of jam? Also has anyone tried a sugar free version?

The first time I made strawberry jam I used this recipe because I didn't have any pectin.  It was the best strawberry jam I had ever tasted.  Recently I tried this recipe again and it didn't congeal, so I poured it all back in the pot and added pectin.  It was no where near the same in taste and consistency.  It ended up more jelly-like without as much chunkiness.  One problem was that I tried to double the recipe.  This meant I should have used 8 cups of sugar, but I only had 7.  It's doubtful this caused the problem because other people have successfully reduced the amount of sugar.  Another problem is that in trying to make such a large batch at once, the jam bubbled over and created a huge mess.  I moved it to a slightly larger pot and once again it bubbled over.  I think that the inability to congeal resulted from the jam not cooking long enough.  I used a thermometer and I was only able to get it to 103 before bubbling over.  I will try this again, but I won't double the batch and I will mash the berries more thoroughly.

Perfect! Not a better strawberry jam out there. . (next time I will reduce the sugar by 3/4 or 1/2 cup.) My family LOVES it but its a bit too sweet for my taste.

I really like this recipe. I've used it twice now. Here's one oddity, though. I don't know if it's because I live by the ocean, but a rolling boil happens for me at around 212 or 214. I get to 220 after around 10 or 15 minutes after rolling. On the bright side, 220 is the magic number--the jam comes out great if I cut it off then. As far as recipe tweaks, I cut the sugar back by about a third, go heavy on the lemon, and add a pinch of salt, cayenne & fine-ground black pepper. The savories aren't explicit in the final product, but I think they give the jam a nice depth.

1/4 cup lemon juice was too much, the jam turned out a bit sour. A friend said that the problem was "putting the lemon juice with all the ingrediants and boiling it altogether is what was wrong, lemon juice should be added 5 min before you take the jam off fire". On the second hand yes it has too much sugar too..way too sweet, I regret not listening to the many people who flaged out this issue.
The recipe should be calibrated according to the strawberries sweetness and sourness. Whatever it was.. my 6 pound batch turned out sweet & sour :(

To the one's who got a thin texture I say go by "The wrinkle test" to achieve perfection of thickness.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making strawberry jam. It was delicious! The only thing I did differently was reduce the sugar to 3 cups, next time I would even use a bit less. I don't want to ever buy store bought strawberry jam again!

Great recipe, doesn't need near the sugar that the recipe calls for. If you boil it hard and long enough, it sets up great.

Yum! This was my first try with making jam and it was a great success!! I doubled the recipe and used about 5 cups of sugar (decreasing by 1.5 cups per recipe) and it was perfect! Tastes SO fresh and I love that it doesn't have any weird preservatives in it!! Will definitely be making this again.

This was the first strawberry jam I've made and it is the best I've ever tasted!  Didn't think I would ever get it to 220 degrees, but it was worth the wait.  I squeezed my own lemon juice, too.  Perfectly delicious!!  Will make more this weekend for Christmas presents--planning ahead. ; )

was AMAZING! I made this for Pesach when we don't use too many processed foods. I let it boil for more like 20 minutes to make sure it would be a good consistency.

I typically reduce the sugar by about half and as long as I am using ripe strawberries it is plenty sweet for my family. Good stuff and super easy!

This was really easy for my first time... The only thing I would change next time is the sweetness.  I used Splenda blends so I used 2 cups instead of 4.  Next time, I will use 1.  Other than that, I'd say this was a success.  Thank you!
And Thank you to the others who reviewed which gave me great tips!  :)

Love it! I do NOT like jelly,(way too sweet for me) so I thought I would give this a try. Used other members suggestion and lowered the sugar. I used 2 1/2c. sugar,(per 1 pound berries) and it was just right. Note for those that are going to can it, I got 3 pints from 3 pounds of strawberries.

I did the plate test running a knife through it and it still got a little too thick.  Next time I'll boil it a little less.  Great recipe...uses much less sugar than the recipe in the packet of Sure-jel that I used to make a different batch of freezer jam.  Overall a success!

I used 2C of sugar as other reviews suggested.  I actually thought it could use a little more sugar so I will try 3C instead next time.  Very easy recipe to follow with good results.

This is a great recipe. I'd never made jam before, so I loved how simple this recipe was. I followed the others' advice and only used 2 cups of sugar instead of 4. I'm so glad I did! It is plenty sweet the way it is. The flavor of this is fantastic. My only issue is that I would like to have had it thicken a little more. But all in all, a great recipe!

This was such a fun recipe to do with my four year old son.  We put on Disney movies, cut strawberries and crushed them together.  He also helped with testing the final product!  We loved it!  Thank you!

I've never made jam before so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was to make. And with only 3 ingredients! I read through other reviews about it being too sweet, so I only added 2 cups of sugar and made sure to taste it before cooking it. I think next time I'll only add 1 cup of sugar. Didn't feel like busting out the thermometer so I cooked it about 15 minutes. I placed the finished product in air tight containers. I'm planning to give one to my parents as a nice treat.

Made this for my future daughter-in-laws bridal shower as the favor.  They were a hit and it was delicious!!!  You  just have to be patient for it to get to the boiling point; but it is well worth it. The texture allows it to be used for toppings for ice cream, cakes.  Going to try the same recipe using blueberries.

This was my first time making jam and I found this recipe to be simple and delicious. I don't have a thermometer, but cooking over a rolling boil for 15 minutes seemed to work out just fine. Great texture! As others have said, it is a bit on the sweet side, so I would recommend adjusting the sugar. I turned the jars upside down for about ten minutes to process and it worked (the jars "popped" when opened). I will definitely use this as a base for future jams. Thanks so much!

this is amazing jam!! picked the strawberries over the weekend from a local farm
increased the heat slowly through out cooking and at the end let it boil a bit and then stir, let boil a bit then stir over and over. Took more than 40 mins. when it gets thick do the test, it should work or keep repeating process. Don't give up because it is worth it in the end. boiled my jars and then did the upside down method.  

enjoy!!

This is a wonderful recipe - and SUPER EASY!  I had jam within an hour and a half of picking the fruit and that was with travel time :o)  I actually used fresh raspberries and downsized the recipe.  If you do that, too, basically, it's equal parts sugar to mashed fruit.  What I ended up with was two cups of mashed raspberries and that made two small jam jars.  Follow the instructions for a deep pot as it does boil heavily.  Be sure to stir softly with a high heat spatula to tame it periodically.  If you boil it to the 220 degree point, you'll be fine, came out perfectly.  I took the advice of turning the jars over after filling - cool trick!

i made this jam and it was SUPER easy!! :) the only problem was it was way to sweet, even for me!( i'm a teen) i looked over all the reviews and i saw that people were saying it was to sweet but i ignored them becuase i thought i could take it. but i couldn't. i still have the full jar of jam in my fridge and i will probably never get eaten now:(

I used this recipe to can for the first time ever and man...not only is it delicious, but super easy. The only thing I did differently was blend the strawberries to the consistency I wanted. I am sure I will be making this for years to come.

Suuuuper easy, very delicious.  I used 1 lb of strawberries, and ~1 cup of sugar, plus the 1/8 cup lemon juice.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a perfect recipe.  Make sure it is rolling boiling.  If it is too runny you didn't cook it long enough and if it is too thick you cooked it too long.  Do the freezer plate test on the footnote to identify the perfect time to take it off the heat.  Make sure to skim the foam while still warm or it gets hard to take off later.

Super easy, turned out great!  Note to other first timers: Be Patient!  This was our children's first time canning/preserving anything and this was a super easy recipe for us to follow.  I followed recomendation from others and cut the sugar to 3 cups, more than enough!  4 would have been too sweet to eat, you could even go to 2.5 cups and it would probably be sweet enough.  We used the 10 min sealing method and it worked great.  Thanks to everyone's comments, they helped bunches.  :-)

This strawberry jam was absolutely delicious!!  It was my first time making jam and this recipe was very easy!  The reason I only gave it four stars  was because I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar which gave it just the right amount of sweetness.  It seems like it would have been way to sweet with all that sugar.  Also I did the freezer test which worked out great!  I think I only boiled the jam for about 17 min and It came out perfectly!!  I will definitely be making this again!!!

The Strawberry Jam had good flavor but was way to thin.  I was very careful to bring it up to the right temperature and it was still to thin.  I was very disappointed.

HELP!! I made this today but it didn't come out like jam at all.  It was so sticky and hard it was like candy.  Did I cook it too long?  Please help me; I want to make 100 jars of strawberry jam to hand out as favors for my wedding.

I had a large amount of frozen strawberries that my wife had hand picked this summer.  I looked on line for a decent recipe to use them in and was upset that I couldnt find anything better than this Jam.  Wow I must say I am very, very happy that I did it.  I used one of the reviews suggestion and basically boiled the jam for twenty minutes.  I just happened to have three mason jars and boiled them clean and canned them old school.  I thought it was too much like syrup and was nervous it wouldnt solidify enough to use as a jam.  I was wrong it was perfect when I smeared a large amount on my homemade banana bread.  Heaven.

I had ripe strawberries and no pectin so thought I'd give this a try.  I followed the directions exactly and this jam turned out beautifully.  I won't bother buying the pectin for the rest of my berries.

I just used this recipe and subsituted 1/2 c of splenda for every cup of sugar.  It came out perfect!  It took me over 13 minutes to get from a rolling boil to 220 degrees.  Keep stirring and be patient!  I stored mine in a glass bowl with plastic cling wrap and put it right in the fridge.  Yummmy!!

I only give it 4 stars because I think you can cut down on the sugar.  I used about 4lbs of fresh picked strawberries and about 4.5 cups of sugar.  I kept stirring it while it boiled to prevent scorching.  Once it hit 220degrees, i turned the heat down and stirred a little more.  It was nice and thick by then.  I was able to make 10 1/2 pint jars.  The next morning while examining an unopened jar, it looks like the jam may have thinned out some, but either way, it should still be a perfect strawberry spread.  It tastes great!

This is so delicious! They only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. When you have sweet strawberries, there is no need to use this much sugar. I cut the recipe in half, and used only 1/2 cup of sugar (cutting sugar content by 75%). The jam was plenty sweet.

This is the first time I EVER made jam.  I had some strawberries that I could see was going to end up in the garbage and decided to make some jam.  It was so easy and it tastes absolutely great!!!  I substituted half of the sugar with Splenda and it is better than any diet jam I've ever purchased.

I used half brown, half white sugar (good deep flavor) and also reduce the overall sugar at least 25%.  I added some red pepper flakes and a little green habanero pepper hot sauce for a little kick.  I also added some salt and red wine vinegar to taste.

Yes! This recipe is very easy and tastes great. Based on comments, I cut sugar to 2 1/2 cups, boiled for a whopping 28 minutes, and the results are just right! I did not use a thermometer but the cold plate test worked perfectly. I also like that this makes a small batch - a tad more than three regular jelly jars full. I look forward to trying this recipe with fresh Maine blueberries - YUM. Thank you for the recipe Katharine and all recipes.com!!

This was also my first time making jam.  I also cut the sugar by half to two cups.  I made a double batch.  I was really surpised that the boiling time was 20 minutes to get it to gel.  Do use the plate test, because I would have pulled it from the heat too soon otherwise.  It became very garnet-pcolored, and syrupy when it gelled (sp?) But a marked difference in color and texture.  I used a dutch oven to boil it in, because it was boiling over in a saucepan.  Even more surprising is that I have a high BTU boiling burner, and it still took 20 minutes.  Maybe because less sugar?  It seems to taste really good.  Interesting to see tomorrow if the lemon juice bite is toned down.  I am going to use it like a freezer jam, and really hope that no glass breaks if I change temperatures gradually.Thanks!

This is my first attempt at making a jam and so i was looking for something simple . The jam turned out great!!! my 2yr old absolutely loved it ....  It took me more than 20 mins to get it to boil though. The freezer test helped and the jam turned out perfect and spreadable . Thanks a lot of the recipe :-)

I used this right away to top a cheesecake, and it was great! I did have to use my mini chopper to get the strawberries down to a good size, and since I do not have a thermometer for this type of cooking I just boiled until it was the consistency I liked (a little over 10 minutes).

I made this because I did not want to use any pectin. It turned out great. I gave some away as gifts and am now making more so I can have plenty on hand as I do not want to buy jam from the store after this. It turned out perfect. The first day I had it over vanilla ice cream and I am going to put it on cheesecake next. Thank you for a great and easy recipe.

This was my first time making jam and it turned out nicely.  It took a while for my jam to get to 220-- it hovered around the 212 mark for quite a while.  I had two thermometers telling me two different temps, so partially through the cooking I added 1/2 pkg (roughly 1.5 oz) of liquid pectin for safe measure.  A tip: once your jam starts to get big "Tar Pit" bubbles on the top-- it's getting close to the correct temperature.

This jam was easy and yummy!  My first time making jam ever.  Hitting that 220 degrees is definitely the key to this turning out right.  Freezer test was proof of that and it set up completely in jars within 48 hours.  Also, I used 1/2 cup less sugar as my strawberries were very ripe, and I could have cut down even more.  Definitely use a heavy bottomed stock pot.  I started out with a large saucepan and it almost boiled over.  Definitely would have burned in that pot as well.  Also, I processed my jars since I made 2 batches and used 10 min. processing time.  Seemed to do the trick.  Will make this again!!

Tasted great! Thank you! I was thinking about all the other jarring jams I have made. Shouldn't you skim off the foam? If you keep it in the fridge canning it doesn't matter.

We made this recipe.  I maybe cooked it too long.  The taste was fine but it is very thick.  It definately tastes cooked.  I like using pectin better.  Freezer jam is much fresher tasting.

It was very easy to cook, but it took a while to reach 220 degrees. I took it off at about 215. A little too sweet. Next time I'll try 2 cups sugar.

So many people had problems with it being runny... I must have let mine cook too long because it ended up being too thick.  It tasted fine though.

I am not supprised that the Jam was a little thin...you need to add either sure jell or certo to thicken it. There are also Great Recipes in the boxes of these thickeners.

This was my first attempt at jam. I think it was a really easy recipe. The only problem I had was using my candy thermometer. I think it was ready long before my thermometer came up to temp. Next time I will use only the sheeting off the spoon and freezer test.

A nice easy jam with definite eye-appeal.  (It was a little too sweet for my hubby.  But, I liked it.)

40 servings will yield 6 half-pint containers.

AWESOME   :-)    I had cleaned my chest freezer out yesterday.  There in the bottom were 2 HUGE bags of frozen strawberries from 2006 !!!  I couldn't throw them away .. so .. I looked up a jam recipe .. chose this one and am SO happy with the results.  It made 5 medium sized jars and it is DELISH !!!

I was very excited about making this!  I thought it looked great, but I think I burnt it slightly as the jam actually smells semi burnt.  Not sure how I could have prevented this from happening.  I also burnt my hand from the jam splattering on me while it was boiling, resulted in a pretty good size blister!

It didn't really work for me.  Came out entirely too runny.  I think it is because I had quite ripe strawberries.  Apparently, if the strawberries are not quite ripened the amount of natural pectin is far greater.  I am putting it aside to use as a base for my strawberry margaritas when the weather is warmer!

This is a good recipe that uses the natural pectin in the strawberry.  I processed filled jars in a waterbath for 10 minutes.  Thank you for sharing.

I cut the recipe in half and it came out great. A little on the messy side when trying to achieve the proper temperature (which is very necessary for thickness), but worth every bite.

This is a good basic recipe!  Easy easy!  Oh, and give your cans a bit of time to seal.  I got all discouraged because I thought a few didn't seal... but then when I went to use them a little while later (the same day, thinking I needed to) they'd sealed on their own!  Nice! :)

We made this recipe at our Brownie meeting last night - it was easy and delicious.  We made two batches:  one Strawberry and one "Triple Berry Delight" (blueberry, strawberry, and raspberry).  The directions were easy to follow and we were pleased with the end results.

The best jam I ever tasted. My wife & I made some a couple of weeks ago. We used the 3 plate method & by the 3rd plate it had set enough. After cooling it was the perfect consistency.........no pectin needed, just patience. I gave a jar to my 87 year old mother & she said it was the best jam she ever tasted.

Fun and easy to make.. the taste is wonderful! So much less sugar, (by three cups!) than the standard recipes. I also thought it was a bit too thin, so I added pectin, and it made all the difference. I had fresh picked the berries, so they were very ripe and juicy. I'm going to try this with other berries, oh! and make some strawberry-rubarb jam the same way. YUM!! (I do think that it would make a most excellent sauce without pectin, w/xtra fresh berries, uummm)

WOW!  This was such a hit and so easy to make.  My 6 and 4 year olds helped and had a blast.  I think the consistency is perfect.  Cold, it is just right for spreading on toast.  Warm, it is awesome over ice cream, pancakes, or waffles.  This one is a must try.  I for one will be making it all summer long.  And what a great gift to give!

I'd never made jam before and didn't know what to expect.  It came out perfect.  The tip for testing doneness was very helpful.  I may have stopped too early if I hadn't done this test.  Very easy and yummy!

This is my first jam-making recipe. It's the bomb! I slashed the recipe amount in half and used 1 & 1/2 cups of sugars instead and it's great. Pureeing the fruit in blender first took the mashing work out and the jam turned out really smooth. The jam is a vibrant red, smells wonderful, and can be spread thinly - just the way I like. Not buying jam from stores again! :-)

Very easy. Loved this recipe. I halved the sugar and cooked with the lemon peel (for pectin), also my thermometer wasn't working so I just cooked till it looked like jelly (maybe 15 minutes?) and did the plate test. It came out perfect.

I made this Jam yesterday, It turned out amazing. I made one batch with the original ingredients and the other by only using  1 cup of sugar as my Berries were really sweet. I will make this again and stick to the one cup of sugar.

I picked about 35 pounds of strawberries one day and decided to use a bunch of them to make some jam. I came across this recipe and it was perfect. Because of the amount of strawberries I had, I ended up doubling my batches despite looking online and being told not to and it actually worked out. I had to boil the jam for a lot longer (it took about 1.5 hours). In order to test when the jam was ready, I used the jelly test mentioned in the recipe. 
I also decided to reduce the amount of sugar and ended up using 3 to 3 1/2 cups to make it less sweet. I decided to add a half cup more of crushed strawberries 
In the end, I ended with 8 jars per double batch and the consistency of the jam was perfect and would recommend using this recipe as it is simple and easy to follow

I used 2 cups of sugar still tastes really sweet I will use less next time. Just waiting for jam to thicken as it cools not sure if less sugar affects the liquid thickening.

Very easy to make for a first timer.  I read several reviews and used a 7 quart heavy pot for jam.  I used a mini chopper for the strawberries and only 2 cups of sugar.  The jam was still too sweet for me.  The consistency of the jam changes completely as it nears the 220 mark.  It looks like strawberry preserves.  This recipe gave me the confidence to make all types of jam.  
The recipe does say it is soft and spreadable, and it is:)

Very easy to make, but  The end result was very sweet. I would say 2 cups would be more than adequate for 2 pounds of berries. Or, if you like it sweeter, start with 2 cups and taste as you go.

Definitely keep an eye on it as it boils to keep it from burning at the bottom. It will take a while to get to 220 so be patient! We ended with about 4 cups of jam altogether.

News flash: jam is sweet. The only thing that thickens strawberry pulp is sugar and heat (or pectin). Use less sugar, and you will get syrup not jam. Don't boil it 20-40 mintues, you will get syrup. Want a quick, less sweet jam? Use pectin. Mine stayed at 214 degrees forever. Hang in there and be sure you use a thermometer and don't stop stirring. Process in boiling water for 10 minutes.

The first time I made this I didn't like it very well.  It tasted like store-bought jam because I cooked it so long trying to get it to 220 degrees (20-25 min).  It never got there.  I only got two pint mason jars, barely.  I wasn't ever going to make this recipe again until I had fruit to make jam and I had no pectin.  That time I cooked it for 10-12 minutes total and did the plate test just to make sure it would be okay.   The jam isn't as thick as jam with pectin but it is good.  I get 2 1/2 to 3 pint mason jars.  I have used this recipe for strawberry, raspberry, peach, and now plum jam.

The Jam is delicious, i Follower the recipe to a t. The only change I am going to make next time is double up on the quantity of fruit. The recipe only yields 4 glasses, so double up is the way to go.

Overall, this recipe is awesome! I only gave 4 stars because, though I have made raspberry jam without pectin, I also had many questions. (Never made strawberry jam) I ended up with (7) 4 ounce jars...28 ounces.

Tips/Changes: 1. Like many others, I will try reducing the sugar, since my garden strawberries are super sweet. I'd stick with 4 cups if using typical commercial berries. 2. Do not use a saucepan! It will boul like making hard candies. I did 2 transfers from my small soup saucepan once it began boiling even though I had 3+ inches to the brim. The first to a 2 gallon-ish stock pot, then to my biggest one I use for canning. 3. Because of the inconsistent rolling boil, I ended up boiling maybe 20 minutes. Based on my previous experience, I had no doubt that it would set. So, I skipped plate in the freezer part. 4. Because of the transfers and seeing that others yielded 40+ ounces, I have nothing large enough to sterilize 10 jars and lids together. 5. Now, my jars aren't hot enough for the upside down canning method. Oh well. It will be eaten pretty quickly. 6. Always can with a buddy to speed the process. I felt a little stressed trying to stir the boiling mix and get the jars sterilized. There was no pouring into the jars, rather spooning it in.

In summary, I think the combination of over boiling and too much sugar created a "sticky" jam. It's still easily spread, but the consistency is more like the center of a strawberry candy or a caramel sauce with strawberry chun

I just made this & I think it turned out really well. I used one less cup sugar, a little more strawberry & lemon juice because it tasted a little too sweet. Now I just don’t know what to do with the jars I’m saving for later. The video was really helpful.

Easy for a first time dad and his 9 year old boy to make.  I read the reviews and the highest points I came across were the sweetness at four cups of sugar and many people reducing it.  Also common, were runny /watery jams.  I suspected the sugar may be needed at that amount to get the consistency showing in my attached photo. This required stirring constantly while it was boiling until the right moment. This ensures it doesnt burn while you "feel" the consistency and reach that point which to stop.

Its simple enough, but this being my first time making jam I felt like there were many things left out. Like how many jars does it make. Where do I store it after its done. And most importantly how do you process in a water bath. Things that may come in handy. Instead I had to search the internet,for the directions.

Super easy and delicious.  I used about half the sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also didn’t use a candy thermometer but just cooked it a little longer than the recipe said, no freezer test. It was a perfect consistency. Will definitely make again.

Use a LARGE pot compared to the strawberry/sugar - it is going to boil up to about  3 times higher than what you see when you start.

I took it up to a boiling temp of 219.6 and after it cooled it really jelled.  Next time I am not going to boil it so long - I like my jam a little easier to spread right out of the refrigerator.

My boyfriend loves this sweet stuff. I usually just stick it straight in the freezer after it cools and eat it from there. It doesnt freeze and is the perfect consistency of jam this way.

Thank you so much for posting this!!!  It was so easy to make, and it tastes great!

I have an autoimmune disorder, and I can't eat ANY commercial citric acid because my immune system goes absolutely insane (even the store-bought ones with "safe" ingredients cause problems for me - companies can add a little bit without listing it, since it's safe for most people, and it's not a common allergen).

This recipe took maybe 20 minutes from start to finish.  I did halve the sugar, and I like it this way.  I also stopped at 216°F because the jelly looked reduced enough.  The mixture looked watery and a bit dull when i started, but by the end, I had a BEAUTIFUL red jelly.  I know this photo isn't the best, but hopefully other readers can still get an idea of the results.  The consistency is great!  I'm sure it will be even better once it has been in the fridge.

I have found so many delicious recipes on AllRecipes.  Another success!

Easy to make, didn't think it was ever going to get to 220. Ended up with 10 - 4 oz jelly jars and a partial. The partial went straight to the refridgerator, no water bath. We'll sample that one tomorrow.

Amazing! Both me and hubby loves it! His favorite normally is raspberry jam, stored bought. Since I have been making this, even though it's not raspberry, he chose to eat my strawberry jam over raspberry store bought. And asking me to make him some raspberry jam this way. Haha thank you

My first time making jam! I used 3.5 cups of sugar and so my only complaint is that I still found it too sweet. The strawberries that I had were pretty ripe. I followed the tips from others: use big pot to boil, plate in freezer test because I don’t have a candy/sugar thermometer, colour should be dark cherry, keep stirring, be patient (because I’m usually not!), boil until it’s a sticky boil. First time canning in jars too and followed the tips I read: boil for 15 mins, out in hot jam and close right away to seal, use oven mitts to handle of course!

The jam tastes great but was a bit too sugary for my taste. I plan on playing around a little with the measurement to get it to my liking.

Good solid recipe.  A few notes that would have helped me as a first-time jam maker.  For me it's a bit too sweet but I've been told that you need that much sugar to preserve the fruit.  If you use less sugar it would be an excellent freezer jam.  
1) to sterilize your glass canning jars, wash them first then place in a large glass pan in a hot oven until ready to use.  Alternatively, put them in a large pot of boiling water with water about halfway up the sides.  You want them to stay good and hot until ready to pour your jam in.  
2) once you've filled your jars (canning funnel and ladle are very helpful) you need to completely clean the top lip of the jar to get a good seal.  Momma showed me to use a clean white cloth to easily tell when you've got it all.  
3) put the lids and rings on good and tight then flip the jars over.  The heat from the Jam will almost always get you a good seal.  
I hope this helped.

The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar. I followed the recipe the first time I made it.  The second time I made it I changed the amount to 3 cups of sugar but it was still to sweet for me. I made it again with 2 1/2 cups of sugar. I was suggest if you don't like it really sweet to use 2 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar. My family loves it.

Super easy. Halved the recipe and used 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2. Almost filled a 500ml jar. Used my small chopper to almost purée the strawberries. Boiled for 8 mins and I think it was too long. It’s very thick and it hasn’t cooled down yet. The taste is like store bought jam but I put prefer the no-boil jam that tastes like fresh strawberries. I will have to update after it’s cooled and my son tries it.

I made it two ways - the original recipe turned out too sweet for my tooth.  Halving the amount of sugar made a huge difference - the jam has ever such a slight tartness to its sweetness - just the way I like it.  
It would have been very helpful to see an additional note as to how long to "process" it in the water bath.  I had to guess.  I processed for half an hour after the water came back to the boil.

This is magical! I didn't believe it would set without pectin, but it did. A scrumptious and quick strawberry jam. I used it for cake layer filling and have been spreading it on toast. Super yum...

I followed this recipe exactly. I had the plates in the freezee as suggested and did the finger test, I cooked it to 220 degrees measuring with a candy thermometer as suggested and I ended up with strawberry syrup.

Is is really too much sugar. I used 1/3 cup of sugar for every cup of fruit, because the strawberries were very sweet, and was delicious.

Very easy to make.  I made if for my Victoria Sponge Cake and everyone loved it!  Since the strawberries I purchased were very sweet already, I just cut the sugar to 2 cups instead of 4.  It turned out perfect!  I will never buy strawberry jams from the store.
Thanks!

My husband keeps requesting I make it again and again!  The kiddos love it too.  Super easy.  On my 3rd time in as many months making this recipe.  First time, I thawed frozen berries.  Using the blender helps sooo much too.  I used the turn the jar upside down method to seal & it worked perfectly.

Yes, I made it, loved it and am going to make it again !  I would like to thank you for adding a place to put in my notes.  I had requested this last year.  Having my personal notes, gleaned from other reviews, to my favourite recipes, is very helpful.  Thanks again and please do not remove this feature.

Found it way to sweet and lost the natural strawberry flavour. Not bad, but not as good as I hoped.

Nice, but for my own tastes I will use a less sugar next time. I think I will cut it in half and use 2 pounds strawberries to 2 cups sugar.

Love it. So does the spouse. Made a half batch, as freezer jam. Very fast and easy. Only concern is suggested testing for doneness didn't seem on target. Experienced guessimate worked, but think I'll buy a candy thermometer. 

Thanks for posting the recipe.

This recipe gets 5 stars from me exactly as is. Super easy and delicious. Great experience for my first time making jam. I got 5 8oz jars full. I also made raspberry jam following the same quantities and it was even more awesome than the strawberry. Husband and I are both thrilled and plan to never buy store made jam ever again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Perfect strawberry jam recipe without using pectin.  Most important is making sure cooking temperature reaches 220 degrees or else you will have runny jam.

I love this recipe! I'm only giving it four stars because it doesn't say how long to water bath can them. I would also recommend running the strawberries through the blender prior to cooking so that your jam is smooth. Otherwise, it's an awesome recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly as stated.  The first batch went so well I made a second batch.   Bringing the berry mixture to 220 degrees was perfect as far as knowing when it was done.  With the first batch I also did the freezer test, but with the second batch there was no need.  Both turned out great!  For me, the recipe made a little over 8 half pints.  Great recipe!

I was looking for a traditional, easy strawberry jam recipe because I had 4 pounds of berries that needed to be used but I  wanted no preservatives added, NOT EVEN PECTIN.  I found this recipe on this, my favorite site, made it exactly as written and could not be happier with the end result.  It is exactly as I remember my mom making it.  It is simple, pure and absolutely delicious.   Oh, by the way, the processing time was omitted, so I processed my jams 12 minutes from boiling point, and voila! Perfect jam. Thank you Katherine.

This was a hard review to write. I read another review from someone that had never made jam before. I am in this category as well.  So I did not know what to expect. Plus I had not used Pectin before, so I did not know what this would do. From research, pectin is used in jelling as a thinking agent to actually jell the jelly.

Im not sure in this recipe what makes the Jam Jell since it has no pectin. I think Pectin naturally occurs in strawberries,  plus I am wondering if all the sugar that the recipe calls for helps in this process as well.

My experience was odd. 4 cups of sugar sounded like way to much to me, so I only used 1. After I put in 1 cup pf  sugar and the lemon juice, I tasted it. It tasted plenty sweet to me, so I did not add the other 3 cups. 

In fact, next time I will cut back on the lemon as well. To me, this made the jam taste too lemony. I wanted strawberry jam, not lemon jam.

The other odd thing was in the thickening  of the jam. One batch I poured straight in a jar from the stove. This batch did not thicken up at all. Even the next day, it is still liquid.

For the rest that would not fit in the 1st jar, it set out a while and cooled down while I was searching for a 2nd jar. When I found a 2nd jar, I put it is and the jam was much thicker. By the next morning, it was not as think as most jam you get from the store, but it was thick enough to make a good spread.

The taste is still too lemony, but it is ok. It is plenty sweet with just the 1 cup of sugar

I love this recipe. It was my first attempt at making jam and it turned out perfectly. I cut the sugar back a bit and the sweetness was perfect as well. Definitely will make this again.

I've made several dozen 1L jars of this recipe as client gifts, and the first batch following the directions 100% turned out more like a desert syrup (still amazing for ice cream, pancakes etc!). For the more recent batches I have boiled it a lot longer (using my thick copper-base stock pot, it ended up requiring around 35mins at a rolling boil before it passed the plate test). 
I will note that I pureed the strawberries first, and also double the recipe ingredients to do several large jars at the same time. 

If you follow the other reviewers advice about sterilizing & preparing the jars properly, keeping them in hot/boiling water before transferring the jam, and turning them upside down when you put the lid on, then it turns out & sets perfectly!

I have a huge strawberry patch and what I don't eat I turn into jam. This is my go to recipe.
Now my jam isn't as thick as the store bought, it is more runny, but the taste is 100Xs better. When it is strawberry season all my friends and family ask me for their jar of jam.

So far I'm impressed! Stays a nice red color. Also a nice consistency. It does about boil over!!!! You also have to stir it the whole time, as it does want to burn. I am anxious to see how it keeps through the year! If it keeps good I will definitely make this recipe again!!

Would you mind adding info on approximately how much will be made to the recipe? I've never made jam before and wasn't sure how many of the jars I should buy. Thanks! Otherwise, it tastes awesome!

Very good and simple recipe.  I reduced the sugar by half and it was still plenty sweet.  Once it came to a hard boil (watch carefully or it'll boil over!),  I reduced to simmer (stirring frequently) and slow boiled for about 30 minutes.  It thickened perfectly.

So simple and so good!   I almost gave the recipe 4 stars since it uses way too much sugar for my taste, but it was too delicious for only 4.     I used half the sugar and it was perfect!    I did have to cook it a little longer, possibly due to the lower sugar content.  I made a small batch, so I didn't have to worry about storing it.

I did mess with this a little.  I left the strawberries chopped instead of squished. Made for more of a preserve than a jelly or jam. I added one box of lemon jello.  Excellent. Clear as a bell and not too sweet at all. Go for it.

Only a 4 because 4 cups of sugar was to sweet. Reduced the sugar to 3 cups and it is sweet enough for me. I like the taste and you can really taste the strawberries not just sugar. Cooked it approximately 25 minutes and it was thick enough.  Recipe made 5 1/4 cups of jam. No more pectin jam for me.

Excellent jam!  Better than store bought jam!  Followed the recipe as indicated and it turned out great!  I appreciated the jelling test tips in the footnotes which worked very well!  I flipped the jars upside down to seal them after pouring hot jam inside.  Recipe only made 3 medium jars though.

I've NEVER made jam in my life, but I just followed the recipe EXACTLY (ESPECIALLY THE TEMPERATURE) and it's perfect! It's honestly quite brainless if you just follow the directions.  The MOMENT it started to cool I could see it starting to get jellylike! It's seriously so easy if you know how to follow directions... a simple rolling boil isn't going to do it- you have to look for the TEMPERATURE and it's perfect! My husband is SO happy! Jam just like his grandma used to make!

My first time making jam from my garden strawberries..  and it turned out fine!  I would like it more solid, so my next batch will be with pectin.   I used about 75% of the sugar, since these berries were very sweet already. I used a digital thermometer, and I couldn't get it past about 216, after cooking it hard for about 15 minutes.  I will second someone else's tip, it will BOIL OVER easily.  I started with about 2/3 full in my stockpot, and I need to make an emergency bail into another pan. Start with no more than 1/2 a pot, and you should be OK. Some more info about the boil would be helpful; the freezer plate tip was useful!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It did take a while to boil it to 220 but it does eventually get there! I'd say it boiled for 30-40 minutes. At first I don't know if I had it boiling hard enough. I tried the cold plate test as noted and that worked great! When I tasted it warm it did seem very sweet, but once cooled it is PERFECT! This is my first time making jam. I will absolutely make this again! The flavor and consistency is on point!

My local grocery was selling a 16 oz container of strawberries for 97 cents so I bought 4  and I made two separate  batches of this jam, ( 8 half pints)and  they  turned out great!  I love that there are only 3 ingredients!   This is the first time I've made jam without pectin.  The firmness of the jam is a little softer but I like that because it spreads easier.  I crushed my berries in the food processor, just a few "pulses" did the job very quickly.  Other than that I did not change a thing about this recipe.  OH and it is delicious!!   I will always use this recipe from now on.

This was super easy and I will definitely make it again!!!!
I did cut the sugar in half, the strawberries this year were exceptionally sweet, needing less sugar.  The plate trick does work.  You need to keep cooking and stiring,  your berries will go from a bright red (when you first smash them), to a deep, dark, thicker red (when you see the change in color your getting close to that 220 degree temp). Thanks for the recipe :)

I found the recipe way too sweet. Here is how I adjusted the recipe. I used 6 cups of fresh Ontario strawberries, crushed. Put into a heavy saucepan, add 2 cups of white sugar, the zest of one lemon and 1/4 cup of natural lemon (not from concentrate). Stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Increase to heat to high. bring the mixture to a rolling boil, stirring often. When berries start to foam, put a tsp unsalted butter into the mixture and keep stirring. Mixture will thicken and turn to a dark crimson colour. Set the timer to 30 minutes when the rolling boil starts. Be diligent and monitor jam, turning down the heat, but maintain a rolling boil and stir from time to time so it does not stick to the bottom of the pan. Measure the correct thickness of the mixture by doing the spoon test. Transfer into sterile stars, leaving 1/4" to 1/2 " of head space and seal. It makes two 16" jars of jam. It turned out perfect, not too sweet and not too runny. Follow the recipe to a 'T' and you will be happy.

I never made strawberry jam before. I picked strawberries from the farm and tried my hands on making jam. Very easy recipe. My family liked it more than the store bought jams.

For a couple years now I've been buying jars of this at our local orchard.  We got so many strawberries in our CSA box this week that I had to either freeze them or make jelly.  So I luckily found this recipe and now I can make what I've been buying for years now.  Yes this is sweet, but it's amazing!!!  I will make more and more batches of this every time we get strawberries in our CSA box.

Great recipe. Very simple. I am a beginner canner but this was straight forward and worked both times. We put the jars upside down for 15 minutes rather than the bath to seal and it worked perfectly for every jar. Most of the people we gifted the jam to asked for the recipe!

This jam is delicious, but quite sweet. I cut the sugar in half and still found it on the sweet side for my liking. Next time I will try cutting the sugar down to 1 or 1.5 cups instead. I also used freshly-squeezed lemon juice and freshly-picked strawberries from the garden. I used the frozen plate trick and it worked perfectly, letting me know when the jam had reached the proper consistency. This spread quite nicely and was a hit all around.

This recipe makes a nice jam.  I only used 3 1/2 cups of sugar, and it still came out a little too sweet for me.  Still, very tasty though.  Thanks!

Super simple!  I wish I had known how any jars it would make.  I used 1/2 flat of strawberries and got just under 4 pints. I cut the sugar in half and used the plate in the freezer to check - came out perfect!  Thanks!

I used 3 pounds of berries, and I always use quite a bit less sugar than called for in a jam recipe because in-season berries are sweet enough by themselves.  I think I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar for the recipe along with about half a cup of lemon juice.  You can add sugar and lemon juice to taste until you achieve your desired level of sweetness; just remember that you can't take away, so start with less sugar and add in as needed.

Awesome flavor, a little too sweet for me.
The final jam tastes like strawberry jam, but the sauce while cooking tastes just like strawberry jolly ranchers!
Gave some away with Christmas presents.  Everyone loved it.

You have to know how to cook to know when the jam is thick enough for your liking. Don't turn the heat too high because it will stick to the bottom... stir often... too low and the water won't evaporate... This came out amazing. Making jelly doughnuts for Chanukah tonight. Made jelly last night, dough rising in the fridge overnight. Taste test came out delicious! Enjoy!

Delicious! Made two batches. The first batch was loose, chunky, and spreadable. I chopped the strawberries in the blender for the second one and cooked it longer and that batch ended up smoother and stiffer.

This is the 2nd time I have made this and it's so worth it!  Bought 2 2lb packs of strawberries from Costco and made a double batch this time.  We tend to like things a little less sweet so I did only add 4 cups of sugar and we think it was just the perfect sweetness and tartness.  We ended up canning 2 pint jars and having one jar in an old salsa jar for in the fridge to eat now.  What a special treat on a cold fall morning strawberry toast for breakfast.  It's the little thing s :-)

Like some previous reviews, I used half of the sugar and it just turns out great.  I also processed the strawberry in food processor before cooking it in saucepan.  As I do not have digital themometer, I checked its doness not by temperature but eyeballing when it is thickened (not easy to drop from a spoon).  Remember it will further thicken on cooling. Next time, I will try not making it so puree for something chewy. I would also try if 1/3 of the sugar is sufficient.

Great tasting recipe! The only change I made was the boiling time. I found that adding an additional 5-7 minutes got me to the thick consistency that I was looking for. Super easy for first time jammers!

Followed the recipe to the letter and I thought it was okay until I went to put it on toast next day, total soup YES you DO need pectin, if you do not want strawberry sauce!  Bummer really wanted Jam.

Very easy recipe. I love making my own jelly and jams, tastes so much better then store bought. I do have to say that after reading the reviews that the only safe way to store jelly or jams without freezing is to waterbath them. Can use any pot as long as the jar is covered with 2 inches of water. Boil for 5-10 minutes. Easy and your jelly/jam will be safe for you and your family.

I had scored some beautiful strawberries for $1/lb so looked for a recipe for jam with no pectin and this one popped up.  It does take a bit of time for the berries to get to 220 degrees, but it's worth the wait.  This made 3 1/2 pint jars.  I did not process them but did boil the jars and lids.  Filled to almost the top, put the lid and ring on and then turned upside down.  After about 10 minutes, turned them right side up and they were all sealed.  I'm still refrigerating the jars, but I feel confident they are sealed good.  The jam is plenty sweet so I think the lemon juice just accentuates that good flavor.  I'd make this again for sure!!

For those of you that don't have pectin or special jam supplies in your life...like me...and have run out of jelly for pb and j sandwiches for the kids...also like me...this was awesome! I was shocked that this actually worked and tasted perfect!  Thank you for making me feel like a jam pro.

Same recipe but used Blackberries, Raspberries and Blueberries. Took longer than expected and never reached 220°.  But it reached 214° and really started thickening.  Then the temp started going down, slowly.  I kept stirring till no more steam was coming out of the pot and did the dish test.  PERFECT!!! Great recipe!

(Update) I amwanting to give you guys this update. I totally didn't cook it long enough. This was the first time making Strawberry jam so it was all trial and error. After done pectin and boiling it and boiling, IT SET! My husband said now this taste like strawberry jam! :-):-):-) YAY! I changed the rating and saved this recipe.
Original post : This recipe is way too sweet! My husband said the same. Something told me  not to use so much sugar. I should have followed that instinct. Also I think it needs more strawberries because they cooked down quite a bit. Rather than throw it all away Im going to put the jam back into a pan and add more strawberries add a little  water and add some pectin. Hopefully this helps. I am new at the whole jam making stuff so its all experimental until I find what I like

I took this recipe and used it as a base but turned around and added my own twist to it. SMOKED THEM! I skewered them and threw them on the smoker before following the recipe. Smoked strawberry jam is something amazingly delicious. Everybody that's tried it has loved it.

I just made Strawberry Jam for the first time, and it was delicious! I did 5 cups of strawberries and only 2 cups of sugar. I did add a  tablespoon of butter when it was boiling to reduce the foam. I had a hard time getting it to 220 degrees, so I just kept doing the plate test till it was the right consistency. Giving 4 stars instead of 5, because 4 cups of sugar would have been way to much! Good easy recipe that I will use again!

The jam did not gel enough. It came out more like a sauce even though the directions were followed explicitly. I will need to "fix" the batch of 5 pints I just made by adding a pectin solution.

It was a good recipe. I found it lacking in directions. After boiling for 10 minutes you do the plate test and it doesn't work. Then what? Boil some more?

This was my first time making jam and it came out good. I only used 2 cups of sugar but it was still way too sweet and I used 5 cups fresh, crushed strawberries and only got 3 jars of jam (8 oz jars). It took about 45 minutes for it to get to 220 degrees and it seemed like it evaporated or something...did I cook it for too long?

Great recipe with NO pectin! I never have pectin when I need it and it's really expensive but I was nervous using my fresh strawberries on an unknown. It turned out wonderfully. I did have to let it cook for around 1/2 hour til it reached 220 degrees but since I did, it gelled just fine. If others have issues, that's the reason-I used a candy thermometer. Yes, it's very sweet but I wouldn't change the amounts as it will affect the result.

Set up perfectly after about 15-20 minutes of medium boil. (Use an oversized pot for sure, i couldnt do a full boil because mine wasnt big enough and popping boiling strawberry bubbles aren't fun). My first time making Jam. I listened to other reviewers and only used about 3/4 of the recipe sugar and i like sweet stuff but it still came out way far too sweet. Its edible I guess but If I make it again, i'll try 1/3 to 1/2 of the recipe sugar.

Made the recipe exactly as instructed.  PERFECT!  Tastes a bit sweet testing with a spoon.  But it is AWESOME on toast and I love not adding extra pectin!

This was my first time making jam and I didn't really have all of the proper tools for canning so I improvised and just used any of the jars I had available and that was just fine.  Overall I think the jam came out good.  I wanted to try a jam recipe that didn't require pectin and this one was very easy to make.  I think it was a little too sweet for my taste so next time I might cut back the sugar a little bit.  I took the suggestion from another person to put the strawberries in a blender to mash.  Also it took a lot longer to cook.  Maybe I did something wrong?  Either way it turned out fine.

First time I have had a go at making jam and decided to use this receipt.  So glad I did, it was easy.  It made about 2 and a half jars so will made double next time.   All in all a fab receipt which I would recommend Katharine

This is my first time ever making any sort of jam and canning it. The recipe was very easy to follow! Just one question. How long does it usually take for the jam to "set"?

I was looking for a jam recipe that I didn't have to use pectin in. I've been using this one for a while now and it's great! I now only use 3 cups of sugar which is plenty for our taste. The time to reach 220 degrees probably varies by stove but on mine it takes about 18 minutes once boiling. I have also made this recipe using two cups of crushed raspberries/blackberries along with two cups of mash strawberries, which I actually prefer.

It hasn't yet cooled completely, but the warm bit I tried was totally delicious. 
In one small batch, I also added some balsamic vinegar and lemon juice. Can't wait to see what it tastes like when it cools down completely.

Really easy! ... and it turned out well. I used 5 cups of strawberries (because that's what I had) and 5 cups of sugar and the juice of one large lemon.  It made 5 small jars of quite thick jam.  It is very sweet, but then - it's jam. :-)

Why would I ever buy store jam again?  This recipe is BEYOND simple and amazing!  I followed the instructions precisely and skipped the water bath process.  I also boiled for about 13 minutes to get near the 220 degree mark.  I placed the liquid into the jar and turned upside down for 10 minutes as others have suggested.  Made Chef John's Buttermilk biscuits this morning and topped with the jam for a pre-Father's Day breakfast with my favorite old guy.  A must try!

Very forgiving recipe. I tried tripling it... I used 10 cups of sugar to 12 cups of berries. Luckily I read the comments and used a huge pot because it almost boiled over. Then I didn't have the heat high enough and it was taking forever, but when I boiled it harder, it boiled down much quicker. It still hadn't reached 220 deg. but then it started to burn... I thought I had wrecked it. But it passed the freezer test so I stopped. Lo and behold it is delicious, thick, perfect jam!

This really, truly is a very easy recipe. My Girl Scouts made this after picking strawberries today. We halved the recipe for each girl, and she took home nearly a quart of jam. Even halving the recipe, it was still extremely sweet.

Best recipe ever!  I like that it doesn't use tons of sugar like the recipes with pectin.  I used 2 1/2 c sugar and 1/8 c fresh squeezed lemon juice after reading some of the other reviews.  I sliced the berries with an egg slicer.  You can tell by the deep color it becomes that it is ready.  The freezer test works great too.

Made this recipe last tear and it was fantastic. This ti e around, it burned : (  my pot is not on the heavy side so I am guessing that is the problem this time around. It is the same pot, so I think that on my third try I am going to let it boil and resduce in low to Med. If anyone has any helpful suggestion, please chime in.

Had about a pound of sad looking strawberries left over in my fridge and decided to try this out! I have always wanted to make strawberry jam, My grandma Jean used to make them and sell them at a local famers market and hers was the best! But never knew how to use pectin so left it on my to do list. So glad I tried this out, it turned out perfectly, took less then 30 mintues, and taste just like my Ma Jeans! Brings back many memories, can't wait to share with the rest of the family.

This is great recipe! No pectin needed, however, the first time we made it it was wayyy too sweet. We cut the sugar in half and it is perfect. It also made it less runny. Additionally i would recommend letting the mixture of lemon juice, strawberries and sugar marinade for about 10 minutes.

WAY too sweet, but the method was easy and the plate test is brilliant.  I cut the sugar to 2.5 cups and you could finally taste the strawberries through the sugar.  I like the old fashioned canning and using the natural pectin of the fruit to gel it.  Check those ingredients--it doesn't get better for you!

My husband and I tried this recipe for the first time. We overcooked the first batch by a little, but the jam still tastes really good. It is just a little thicker than it should be. We also dropped the sugar down to 3 cups and the sweetness is just right. We are going to try making Pluot jam with this same recipe. So easy, and so delicious!

I had some frozen strawberries in syrup that I needed to use up.  So I scaled back the recipe for 1 pound and the sugar more since the strawberries were with syrup.  SO GOOD!!  And the stores charge $4 a jar for these??  Hoping to make my own from now on!!

This was very good jam. I made it twice. The first time I found it to be too runny, so the second time I added two tablespoons of cornstarch. It made it more of the consistency of jam.

First time making any kind of jam but it was so delicious!!! Only change I made was not adding as much sugar as the recipe called for. I put in about 75% of the sugar n tasted it, it was plenty sweet for me:-)

Super easy.  My first try came out the consistency of smooth jam.  Not solid jam but not syrup either.  But either way, I'm thinking whether jam or syrup this will be great no matter what.  Took advice of other reviews and used 3 c of sugar instead of 4.  Had peaches not strawberries so took a risk but this is great stuff!

I REALLY wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't work for me.  I've wanted to make jam without using pectin, so I gave this a shot.  Mine did not set, but I don't think I boiled it long enough.  The reason I didn't really care for this was because it was too sweet for me.  It ended up tasting more like sugar than strawberries.  We did, however, use our 'syrup' as ice cream topping which worked really well.

This was an excellent recipe.  It *is* difficult to get up to the right temp without it boiling over... you have to watch it.  But the finished product tastes like my grandmother's recipe, and it got rave reviews by everyone that I gifted it to.

This recipe is so easy and produces such a great product! Perfect consistency. Although it was a bit too sweet for my taste, my boyfriend LOVED it. I used fresh picked (exceptionally sweet) strawberries however, so that likely affected the sweetness. All in all, this recipe is a keeper!

Used only 5 cups of sugar it turned out too loose. I might recook with another cup of sugar. We did use a litttle more berries but we cooked it until it reached 220 degrees jarred and then water bath for 15 min.

This really is so easy and delicious.  Everyone I give it to as a gift raves about it.  Just picked some fresh strawberries and am making it for my son's teachers.  We look forward to making this every spring/summer with freshly picked berries.  It's the best!

This is soooo good!  It was really easy, especially using a food processor.  The biggest thing was being patient while it is boiling and keep stiring.  Also, be careful while it is boiling because it bubbles really high, fast. I got splattered a little and it hurt!  I had never made jam before this and wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I made it last night and this morning it was ready.   I've never been a jam/jelly eater, but my husband and son love peanut butter & jam sandwiches.  Store jams taste pretty crappy compared to the homeade stuff!

This was my first time making jam--and this was very easy.  I made half of the recipe (about 2 cups).  I thought it was way too sweet so next time i'll definitely be using less sugar.  I sterilized my jars in the dishwasher by running it with only the jars in it and not using soap...the hot water is what does the trick.  I plan to make this with lots of flavors (blueberry, etc) but with less sugar.  CAn't wait to start making baskets for the holidays!

A great recipe to use my strawberries that were a little past ripe. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it boiling quite hot enough on my portable induction unit (trying to conserve heat in the summer) so it didn't set up very well. This is not the fault of the recipe! It still tasted great, and will be excellent over ice cream. I look forward to trying again on the electric stove.

Mine messed up...it never got thick enough to spread like jelly.  It had wonderful flavor and it was probably my fault it never got thick.  I still can spread it on a bagel for me but probably wont be putting in a pb and j for the little one..it will prob. run out.  Anyway...I plan on giving this one another try!

The flavor is very good. Mine did not set up well. I had not made any jams without pectin before. Maybe I need to adjust cooking time for altitude? I will try again though.

A lot of stirring but it is worth it. It is delicious on biscuits or ice cream or straight from the pot!!!

This is a great recipe! I have never made jam and it turned out perfect. It was very easy. These jars of jam are great to give as gifts.

Way easy and delicious. Of course, it depends a LOT on the quality of the strawberries. Because this is SO easy to prepare I make it fresh every time I need some. Sometimes I add a little bit of diluted cornstarch to help thicken it up.
