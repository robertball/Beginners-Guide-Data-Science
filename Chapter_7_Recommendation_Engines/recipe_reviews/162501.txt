This is a great way to get protein in the morning because it's disguised as carbs!  I noticed that some people had trouble with this recipe and I think it helps immensely to COVER the saucepan.  I always put a lid on when I'm cooking quinoa, so that's what I did with this recipe.  The quinoa was done after about 20 minutes, I then uncovered it and let the extra liquid cook off until I had my desired consistency.  Came out perfect!  I recently switched to (unsweetened) almond milk so I was excited to see a recipe that called for it.  Loved the cinnamon and vanilla.  I added some raisins and craisins and sprinkled some extra brown sugar on top.  Yum!  ****Update:  I now make this with only 1 cup of milk and no water.  Cover and simmer, and it only takes about 10-15 min. to cook.

This is SOOOOO good! For health reasons, I have to eat tons of protien every day, and I get sick of stuffing my face with meat all day. This was a very refreshing breakfast, very tasty and different! It's in the 80s here already but this winter, this will be a staple! Next time I'll use less liquid, I like my porridge thick enough to stand a spoon up in it. I added chopped walnuts and dried fruit and a little extra cinnamon. Excellent!

This recipe has way too much liquid, maybe that's why several people thought theirs wasn't cooked in the time specified. If you're expecting this recipe to soak up all the liquid like oatmeal does, you'll be disappointed.  The quinoa I bought (Costco) is pre-rinsed, and the cooking instructions on it are to use 1 part quinoa to 2 parts liquid, brown it in butter or oil, then add liquid, bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 15 min. I have substituted several different liquids, and it always turns out perfect and fluffy like rice.  So, I still gave this 3 stars, because after I altered the liquid amounts to 1/2 c water and 1/2 c almond milk, it did turn out quite nice. I like it with chopped almonds and dried cranberries mixed in at the end for breakfast.

I made this for my family, as I'm a big "You are what you eat" fan, and this is one of the ingredients suggested by Gillian. I was surprised that such a healthy ingredient tasted good. I won't be a fan of quinoa over night, but this definitely opened my mind to using quinoa in some other recipes. 

When I followed the direction, I found that the quinoa was still a bit crunchy after it was prepared. I don't know if this is common or not, but the next time I make it, I think I will cook it a bit longer. Also, if you are feeding other people with this recipe, it comes out closer to two and a half (very filling) servings.

I would suggest that you make this in conjunction with blueberry muffins as the combination of flavors was delicious. 

Thanks for submitting the recipe!!

this was really really good.  it had the perfect amount of sweetness.  it had a tiny bit of a crunch, but it wasnt really crunchy like it sounded like everyone else's was.  i cooked it longer than 25 minutes only because i wanted it to be thicker.  i cooked it at a very low simmer for 25 minutes, and the texture was great.

I LOVE this recipe.  It's a great way to start the day.  I am an oatmeal fan and find this cereal to be lighter than oatmeal yet just as filling.  I add cinnamon, nutmeg, craisens, and vanilla, and cook it in soy milk.  Once cooked, I add a scoop of ground flaxseed.  Yum!

This was really good and an interesting new way to use quinoa but some changes were needed in the cooking method. I did not add the water and just used 1.5 cups soy milk since that seemed like way too much liquid from my previous experiences with quinoa (figured I could add the water later if it was needed- it wasn't). I also covered the pan while it was simmering to help with water absorption. After the quinoa was cooked through I took off the lid and simmered until it reached the consistency I wanted. I topped with a bit more brown sugar and some walnuts. This made a delicious breakfast for two (it was not three servings for us) and I think we both could have eaten a bit more.

This was good but not out of this world. I used regular milk as I only had that, and decreased it to about 1/2 c as others suggested. It didn't need the full 25 min, but it probably took about 20. I omited the salt as well. This only made 2 portions, and that is coming from a light eater. I will make it again but I think I want to play around with it to make it REALLY good.

This was a delicious and very healthy breakfast! I used regular cows milk, because I didn't have almond. I also used organic raw brown sugar (sucanat) instead of regular. I cut it down to one serving size; it wasn't really enough, though! Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

Did not have good flavor and took too long to cook.  I have made something similar in the crockpot over night and I think I like the flavor better.

I followed the instructions as directed, but used red quinoa, raw milk and raw honey instead of the plain quinoa, almond milk and brown sugar.  Becuae I used a darker quinoa it was difficult to tell when it was toasted. To me it tasted slightly burnt but having never had quinoa before I don't know if that was its natural taste.  My main problem is it would not break down and thicken. I cooked it for an hour, the milk boiled right down and the grains became tender but the texture was still seeds floating in milk. After an hour I tried getting creative, boiling it again, microwaving it, squashing it with a spoon and yelling at it.  After an hour and a half I gave up and ate as is. It was very tasty but never got to the consistency of porridge.

Made in a ricecooker, with slightly less liquid (only 1 1/2 cups total).  Used soy milk instead of almond milk, and 1 1/2 tbsps agave nectar instead of the brown sugar.  Turned out perfect.  Exactly like the porridge served on the Inca Trail in Peru.  Great alternative to porridge oats.

Quinoa is known as a superfood so I was trying to find a recipe for quinoa for breakfast and this recipe is just what I was looking for! I left out the brown sugar and added it on top after it was cooked. It made two servings so I put one in the fridge to heat up for tomorrow's breakfast. Delicious and so healthy! Thanks!

A bit too crunchy for my liking, even though I did not expect this to be smooth. The taste was ok though. It was my second time with quinoa and I think I'll explore other ways to use it.

I am always looking for healthy meal options. I was excited when I came across this one because quinoa is a great alternative to many grains. I made this the first time exactly as the recipe stated. It was good but the nutty flavor was a bit overwhelming for me. So, the second time I used half vanilla soy milk and half almond milk. I also used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 1/4 tsp. I topped the porridge with some walnuts and raisins. It was just right! I make a full batch and divide it into 1 cup servings. I refrigerate the second serving and reheat it the next morning with a little added soy milk and it is great!

It's pretty good. I took the advice of another poster and used 1/2 c water and 1/2 c milk (used vanilla almond milk). No sugar added since I haven't got any and I was making this in my dorm. The quinoa cooked well but was nothing like porridge afterward. I mixed it with blackberries to get some sweetness in and added a tiny bit more milk to it for another bit of sweetness. I'll probably make this again and try using a bit more liquid from the start.

Maybe it's just quinoa I don't like but I couldn't get this stuff to taste good. Too sweet, too bitter.

This was my first experience with quinoa, and quite positive. I think this recipe is delicious, though does need to be cooked longer. I used 1% milk instead of almond-- watch out for the milk protein scum, which needs to be skimmed off. I'd make this again, but I'm going to keep looking for a breakfast quinoa recipe that'll fit into my morning schedule during the school year.

This is really a delicious healthy recipe! It takes a few minutes to do but is well worth it! You can just let it cook as you do other things around and occassionally check on it and stir it. I do it with a little maple syrup in place of the brown sugar. I've also started adding some nuts on top that I've roasted in my oven for 7-8 min. on 350. It's really good and satisfying knowing that it's also healthy and high protein. It's a staple breakfast recipe for me now! Thanks for shareing!!

I added an additional 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and omitted the vanilla. I also used 1 cup milk, no water. Next time I will reduce the brown sugar a bit as it was a tad sweet. Overall very good. Will make again.

Delicious recipe. I followed one other reviewer's recommendation and used 1 cup almond milk (vanilla, unsweetened). After the quinoa boiled I reduced to a simmer and covered until cooked (about 20 minutes). I also added some raisins after cooking and it was a delicious breakfast!

This was very tasty!  I have just been introduced to quinoa, and this is my first breakfast use of it.  It has just the right amount of sweetness and is quite filling.  I made it with regular milk, since that's what i had, but i added some almond extract.  Yum!

This recipe was fantastic with just a few minor adjustments; first of all, I used unsweetened chocolate almond milk since that's what I had on hand and it was delicious! Also, I didn't bother with water and used almond milk as my liquid exclusively, sticking to the quinoa package's recommended 2:1 ratio of liquid to grain instead of what's written here and it was absolutely perfect. This is a great, delicious, healthy breakfast if you have the time to make it!

Does anyone know if you can make this the night before and re-heat in the morning? I don't have that much time in the morning to make this, but would love get started on my bag of quinoa I have had in my pantry for so long and been too scared to cook with it.

I prepared this the way LUV2COOK recommended and it came out perfect. I've never cooked Quinoa before and I love the nutty flavor and slightly crunchy texture of it.

I used maple syrup to sweeten it and added a little nutmeg then mixed in some banana. I've also added apple pie spice or pumpkin pie spice to my cereal before.

I thought this was a terrific quinoa recipe.  I bought a large bag at Costco's so I'm always looking for ways to use it.  I made it just as written except for using skim milk and it came out fine.  I split it into 3 1/2-cup servings to reheat during the week.  I will try adding the raisins, craisins and/or nuts when I have it next.  Yum!

Very excellent! This is my 2nd time cooking with Quinoa and I really liked this! I added a lot more cinnamon, used cows milk, and did not add as much water. I also added raisins and it tasted fabulous. I think I've found an alternative to salty breakfast sandwiches on Sunday morning before church!

This was REALLY good!  I used plain unsweetened soy milk because I ran out of almond milk and my kids ate every last bite.  Next time I will use almond milk to see which I like better.  Definitely a keeper!

I love quinoa but had never considered using it in a sweet breakfast dish before seeing this recipe! As noted in some other reviews this does take forevvver to cook which sucked because my guest and I were super hungry, but with the addition of some cinnamon cereal and blueberry jam, it was worth the wait. Really delicious, filling, and satisfying! My only suggestion would be to cook it at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time BUT be sure to continue stirring it the whole time.

Great breakfast cereal!  Per others' suggestions, I reduced the liquid (to 3/4 c almond milk and 1/4 c water) to make a thicker porridge.  The volume of the porridge is then greatly reduced, as others observed, and I'd say it becomes more like 1 serving than 3.  I omitted the salt to reduce sodium.  The only change I will make for personal taste is to reduce the brown sugar.  Very nice recipe, thanks!

This was my first attempt at quinoa for breakfast and it was pretty good. A little sweet for our taste so next time I will use less sugar. I keep a variety of milk in the house (organic cow, almond and soy)so I will try different combinations just to keep it interesting. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out perfect.  I didn't add sugar though as am avoiding sugar at the moment.

I rinsed the quinoa as per packet instructions, then put on a hot pan with some cinnamon,  heated and stirred for about 4 mins until the excess water had evapourated and the quinoa was just about sticking to the pan.

I stuck to the 2:1 ratio but used mostly almond milk and a small bit of water, brought it to the boil then turned to lowest heat, and left UNCOVERED to simmer.

After 15 mins nearly all the water was gone so I snuck a taste and it was still very crunchy and I was busy with something else so I took it off the heat and covered it and just left it there for about 5 mins.  I tasted again, and it was perfect. Just a tiny crunch but with a lovely sticky/stodgy consistency of porridge which I love but this is a great healthier alternative.

I added a tiny bit of yoghurt and berry smoothie I had just made up, to sweeten.   Lovely, and very filling.  I would say the result just varies by quality of quinoa you have and the heat of your cooker top and if it doesn't work first time, try again, it's worth it.

I followed this recipe to the letter, but at 25min, my quinoa was still quite crunchy. I bumped the heat up to medium low. After over an hour, I gave up, doused my serving with brown sugar, and managed to eat half of it before dumping the rest down the drain. Ah well. I'm afraid I won't be trying this one again.

Very dense. Best mixed with cooked oatmeal too. 1 cup milk was not enough liquid, or that could be because I kept lifting the lid to check it and stir. Used 1/2 c hot water also. Quite sweet, doesn't need much brown sugar cooked into it.

Very good high protein breakfast recipe.  The last 30 seconds of cooking I added what I had on hand, raw almonds, golden raisins, dried cranberries and fresh blueberries.  I mixed in 2 TBS of ground flax just before serving.

I've made lots of recipes using quinoa and knew this wasn't meant to come out light and fluffy like regular dishes.  I took it off the heat sooner than 25 minutes while it was still a little watery, and it thickened upon standing.  It was perfect.

My husband and I thought this was a bit too sweet though.  Next time I will leave out the brown sugar and we can stir our own amounts to taste, if needed after serving.

This recipe is a keeper and I'll make it again.

Delicious! However, it was very sweet for me. I made a double batch and tweaked it a little. I used 2 cups quinoa + 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and no water (except for a few tsp when it started to get too thick). Used about 1.5 tbsp brown sugar. Covered with a lid. Added cranberries at the end. Either it was the almond milk or brown sugar and the cranberries that made it too sweet. I will use the almond milk + water next time to see if that makes a difference. If you want it healthier, use less sugar. Just a side note - I've only made quinoa twice now but I think this time the quinoa didn't plump up as much as it did when I made it with broth.  P.S. I didn't burn the pan! I will certainly make it again!

I was a little apprehensive to try this due to some of the not-so-glowing reviews, but I finally did and am very happy I did!  Only change was to use regular skim milk, and the cooking time was off - I had to simmer for about another 20 minutes, adding about an additional 1/4 cup of water to keep from burning, but the end result was excellent!  Served with some fresh blueberries.

This recipe looked so promising. I love quinoa, which I eat a few times a week, and like almond milk as well, often using it in porridge. But ugh, this recipe is revolting. Maybe the original poster used unsweetened almond milk, and mine was sweetened (the only kind you can buy in the UK, to my knowledge). But it was so sickly sweet that I couldn't eat it. Plus the texture and colour were offputting too. I won't be making this again.

OK- I made this porridge this morning with a few revisions.  I added one chopped apple, a handful or raisins, and some baking sweetener to 1C of the quinoa.  I used one of those waterless cooker pans from the 70s so the porridge cooked in 30 minutes but it required nearly double the fluid.  I used one Cup of skim milk and all the rest in water.  If I had cider in the house I would have used that.  The end result is tasty.    I am trying to add more whole grains to our diets.  My husband will eat  quinoa with a tomato creole type addition but he isn't thrilled.  The porridge is for me!!

This is a great basic quinoa porridge recipe, I find others get the cook times a little wrong or add unnecessary steps like cooking the quinoa by itself first. Since I try to reduce added sugar, I like to dice up an apple in place of the brown sugar. I also like adding cardamom in with the cinnamon. This is perfect if you crave the comfort of oatmeal but want something a little heartier.

This was amazing! I used full fat coconut milk because im trying to get more fats in my diet and I used liquid vanilla stevia drops to flavor it instead of brown sugar. I also covered the quinoa when cooking. I topped it off with some delicious blackberries and raspberries when it was done.

I love oatmeal, but did not like this. The texture is off and I don't think adding salt is a good idea! I did cook it with the lid on and used slightly less liquid as others recommended, and I do think that helped, but it was still not as good as regular oatmeal. In the end, I added walnuts, banana, and raisins and my fiancé and I were able to finish it all, but I will not be making this again.

I've made this two ways and both are excellent. I've made the recipe as written, except covered the pot while it simmers for 20 minutes.  The second way is my preferred way. I substitute one mashed banana in place of the brown sugar. This adds just the right amount of sweetness for me! I also still cover the pot while it simmers. One note with the banana is that it usually will take 25 minutes because it does have more liquid in it.  Enjoy!

This is quite nice.  I just wanted a single serving, which is typically 1/4 cup of uncooked quinoa.  So to that I added 1/2 cup of almond milk.  The ratio for quinoa to cook correctly is twice the amount of liquid as quinoa.  Too much liquid and it's crunchy, which is gross.  Then you cook it, covered, for 10-15 minutes.  I only used 1 tsp of brown sugar.  I like the flavor that adds,a long with the cinnamon and vanilla.  I added a dollop of plain Greek yogurt to the top of mine.  Delicious!

The recipe itself is delicious but the recipe directions leave out a lot of steps if this is your first time making quinoa. Make sure to rinse quinoa there is a taste difference if you don't. Add oil to the pan before adding the quinoa otherwise it burns. I did use all the liquid called for because quinoa is a 1:2 ratio. The time frame isn't accurate. It takes about 30-45 mins if you want it to come out soft and not hard using the milk. I tried it with just water that way was faster because for milk you need it on low heat not medium whereas with the water you can do a higher heat. But this taste a lot better with the milk. I throw in a dried fruit near the end to let it get a little warm too.

This is the RIGHT amount of liquid if you want a porridge texture! I followed review suggestions and only used 1c of almond milk...the quinoa was still crunchy. I then added another half c of almond milk and the water, let it simmer, and it was exactly what I was looking for! When I poured the hot porridge into a closed travel container, it absorbed even more liquid and had a mushy consistency (not what I was looking for but oh well). Cooking time was consistent with what the recipe said. I added a banana instead of using brown sugar, and I forgot to add the vanilla, but this is a healthy alternative to oatmeal!

I've made this three times each time makes about 2 or 3 servings for me. I dont add any water just the almond milk and a little less brown sugar. Soooooo good highly recommend putting maple syrup, coconut chips, pecans, and some fruit on it!!!

i do NOT like quinoa. tried it everywhich way and still not a fan. however...i LOVE hot cereals, so i was happy and excited to try this, for our Canadian Allstar breakfast challenge.  i didn't have almond milk, i used 1%, i also use homemade pumpkin pie spice instead of cinammon. i topped mine with toasted walnuts, blackberries and a drizzle of maple syrup.  what i learned from this recipe is that i still don't like quinoa, no matter how you dress it up. So to be fair to the submitter, i'm giving this 4 stars. just because i don't like it, doesn't mean everybody won't like it. i can see how quinoa lovers will really like this recipe. it's just not for me.

I used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and added cranberries and almonds. After reading some of the reviews, I started off with 1/2 the liquids, but eventually added more (not the full amounts though). I think that it would have been nicer if I'd added a tad more milk at the end. Overall, a good belly-warming brekkie.

Best quinoa porridge I've ever made. 
Substituted the brown sugar for maple syrup. 
Added sultanas, cashews and almonds and topped with sunflower seeds for the extra protein hit! So good.

Mine burned instantly.I found it best to heat the milk (and water, if you feel you need it) slowly, stirring constantly, on low heat. Then adding the dried quinoa and other ingredients. Bringing it to a light boil, and lowering the heat to let it simmer with the saucepan lid on it.  I didn't find I needed much more liquid than 1 1/2 cups milk, so I didn't add the water.
