This was a hit at our family Christmas table.  I changed it up by using delicata squash because it's sooo much easier to prepare than the thick skinned squash varieties.  The mace, instead of the more common cinnamon, adds a delicate spicy touch.  I followed the suggestion for 1/4 maple syrup with 1/4 brown sugar.  Here in New England, we use our maple syrup every chance we get!

Actually quite surprised! Not really a big fan of squash and/or apples, but we happened to have a buttercup squash and some apples in the kitchen, so I figured “what the heck “. It was pretty darn tasty! And not too hard to make. Even threw in the cranberries!
