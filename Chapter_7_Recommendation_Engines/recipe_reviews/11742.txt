This was ok,it came out dry I thought there were too many noodles. My husband was not crazy about it. If I did make it again I would use 12oz. of pasta and mix in 1 cup of the cheese instead of putting it all on top.

This is a good recipe and is really easy to make.  I only used 12oz of noodles (16oz just sounded too much) and I mixed in sharp cheddar cheese instead of sprinkling it on top. YUM. I still think it needs another spice to liven it up a little but I'm not sure what. Regardless, I still make again and maybe in future, will try to find the spice it lacks.

I made this when I had almost no groceries in the house. I used 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup. Cooked the chicken in the microwave. Used 12 oz. of cooked noodles and sharp cheddar. Had to use water instead of milk and my husband still called it keeper. I did cut the pepper down to a 1/4 teas. and salted the water I cooked the noodles in.

As a college student, I didn't have exactly the right ingredients so mine came out a little bit different. This was definitely easy to make but a little on the bland side. My boyfriend and I kept saying that there was something missing. Instead of using egg noodles I added in rigatone noodles, but as a reviewer said before there were a lot of noodles in this dish...I would definitely use a little less.

We liked it. I added another can of cream of potato, because it seemed a little dry. My family would have prefered something other than the broccoli, so next time I will try more mixed vegetables. I thought it was very easy to make, because I usually do everything from scratch.

This was very tasty.  I used just the frozen brocolli and some condensed mushroom soup instead and used a little poulty seasoning and cumin on the chicken and a 1/2 cup of parm and 1 1/2 cups chedder and mixed in.  Came out great!

This is perfect comfort food for me. I've made it a half dozen times and the only thing I change is that I halve the salt and pepper. The amount of noodles is a preference thing, so just add them slowly, stir and judge for yourself. I probably use 3/4 of a bag, but it varies. I've made this for people in grief and/or recovering from surgery, and it's always a hit. Thanks!

Awesome! Whole family loved it. Just cut the noodles down to 1/2 package to 8 oz. instead of 16 oz. Great combination!

Fabulous! Quick and easy to make and yummy! I used 2 cans of Cream of Potato and a can of Broccoli Cheese soup, about 16 oz of frozen mixed veggies (didnt have broccoli). I also used about 1.5 cups of milk to make the mixture less thick. We served with garlic bread and it was a hit!

Good, satisfying, comfort food. I used ground turkey instead of chicken and it worked just fine. Will make again.

We loved it! I read the comments before making and noticed a lot of 'bland' complaints so I upped the spices and added turmeric to the chicken. 
I put a cup of cheese into the casserole; a cup on top and broiled. 
We ended up with broccoli as a veg only and instead of potato soup we used celery soup. 
Huge hit!! My son ASKED to have leftovers tomorrow night!
Thank you for the share!!

I modified this and it turned out very well.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of milk, and a cup of Hellman's real mayonaise.  Like others, I only used 12 ounces of noodles.  Also, in place of the can of vegetables I used a half bag of frozen. I think that as long as the liquid amount gets doubled, it turns out great.

Used this recipe as a starting point because I was forced to make some adjustments because I did not have all or sufficient amounts of the ingredients on hand. 

Here are some of the things I changed:
Subbed cream of mushroom soup for potato soup
Short on cheese so I decided to mix it in and added a crumb topping  that I browned.
Had only frozen broccoli and a large handful of peas...Added some diced cooked carrots, mushrooms, celery and onions.  (The last 2 for added flavor)
Doubled the milk
Sauteed a clove of garlic
Added a dash of nutmeg.
Salt was left out.

Thanks to all those who offered suggestions and changes. This is a great base recipe. I made the following changes per suggestions: 1) used 12 ounces of noodles 2) mixed half the cheese into the mixture before putting in the pan 3) used all broccoli but will make again using mixed veggies 4) put in a few dashes of Penzeys Curry. Yum! It was perfect for my potluck!

It's a pretty good dish! I sautéed my chicken with basil, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. I used fresh carrots, sweet corn, and baby peas. For the fresh carrots, I stayed them in butter to soften them up for baking. I used rotini pasta instead. I used a little more milk, and topped the dinner with cheddar cheese , Parmesan, and Italian crumbs. Super easy! Covered with tin foil to keep moist

I cooked the chicken with poultry seasoning, pepper and onions, then added parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and onion powder during the mixing with the noodles. Very easy and good basic recipe.

This was ok as written for me. My son loved it. I did not like the combination of cream of potato and cream of mushroom, plus I felt there were too many different veggies. 

Next time I will use cream of chicken and cream of corn, and just use carrots, corn and peas.

Easy cheesy recipe.  Truly great comfort food.
The second time I made it I substituted cans of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup.  Added chopped mushrooms as well.  For a "healthier" flair, instead of egg noodles, try Ronzoni Supergreens rotini, especially if you don't have any broccoli.

Reminded hubby and I of good comfort food!  Couldn’t get the soups mentioned in the recipe, so substituted with cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken soup and added a small jar of mushrooms.  It will be on the menu again soon.

I was a little skeptical of the soup combination but it was fine. It did need more spices. I added garlic salt to my plate of food. I would make again and add more spices.

These proportions are so off.  16 ounces of noodles!  Biggest package I can find at the store is 8.  Chicken mixture is very dry.  I added at least a cup of the poaching liquid to get it to an okay consistency.  Canned vegetables?  I used all frozen  Not at all excited about this one.

It was actually pretty good.   Made it as the recipe called for except I used cream of mushroom soup and a teaspoon of chicken base.   Needed some extra spice to get a 5 star.   Otherwise simple and quick dinner.

I have to replace most broccoli recipes with green beans as my guy won't eat broccoli but it was just as yummy!

I really liked this, I didn't use any chicken and since I didn't have egg noodles I used Barilla Pronto, 16oz box. I also used 15oz bag mixed frozen veggies. Consistency was great, easy and fast. I didn't measure the cheese- I likely used slightly less.

Delish! I mixed the cheese in and put bread crumbs on top to make it cheesy throughout with a little crunch!

I took everyone's advice on it not being moist enough and mixed in cheese. I also added a little more milk and omitted a good portion of the noodles. I also used frozen veggies instead of canned and boiled fresh broccoli.  For a flavor boost I crumbled a knorr chicken bouillon in the mix and did not put salt I also added some granulated garlic. Came out good, fairly simple, I will make it again. This recipe yielded enough for for our family of 3 and another batch I stuck in the freezer. Bonus!

I have made this recipe, subbed out mixed veggies for peas, 12 oz noodles, and added garlic, with a light dash of Italian seasoning. It's a go to, quickly made comfort meal in the winter. Sometimes, I sub tuna for the chicken, still excellent.

Very easy, but a tad bland.  I modified it because I don't have cream of anything soup in the house.  So, I just made a roux with butter, flour, and milk, then added broccoli florets, chopped cooked potatoes, and the rest of the ingredients from there.  Hubs had two huge helpings.  I didn't like it as much, but he's much more interested in creamy casseroles than I am.  It was pretty successful from his standpoint, and we have lots of leftovers I can send with him to work this week, so that works.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish.  I try to make things healthier and this one was easy to "health up" buy using low fat/low sodium cream soups, no yolks egg noodles, frozen veggies, and low fat cheese.  Even after all those adjustments it still tasted great!

I couldn't find cream of potato or crean of brocolli so I used cream of chicken and cream of celery.  Came out great.  Good flavor and very filling.  I'll have leftovers for a week!

Recipe was really good, but I just felt like it was missing something.  Not sure what, though...needed some more seasoning or kick.

This is definitly a comfort dish.  I have been looking for a dish like this.  I did use frozen peas and carrots instead of  mixed canned vegetables and left the broccoli out. I used 12 oz. noodles and 3 cans of soup. Cream of Chicken,Cream of celery, and Cream of Potato. It does make a lot.  Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loved this recipe! I didn't use the frozen broccoli (only beause I forgot to get it) and used more mixed vegies.  I even served it for lunch the next day for my Brother-in-laws and they loved it too.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was delicious!  My family is not big on broccoli, so I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of broccoli and left out the frozen broccoli.  My only suggestion for improvement is use less pepper than is called for.  I would use less than half a teaspoon next time I make it.
