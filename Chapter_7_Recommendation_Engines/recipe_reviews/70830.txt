This was a good recipe, but I think some of the directions were a little bit off: 1) 1/2 lb. of pork was much too little for 24 buns. I bought 1 lb just to be safe and still didn't have enough filling to go around. 2) The directions read 2 tablespoons of filling were to be put in each bun, but there were probably only 8 tablespoons of filling total; I think it should have read 1-2 teaspoons - or 1 tablespoon at the maximum, if you made extra filling. 3) Coating the bowl with 2 tablespoons of oil seemed excessive to me; I just used 1 and it worked fine. After I made these changes, things went smoothly and the char siu bao turned out great; a lot like the ones from back home! I made my own char siu with a packaged marinade mix instead of trying to find it at a store. If you want tasty dim sum, try this one out; if I can do it anyone can :) Thank you so much for the great recipe!

This is a fantastic dim sum recipe!  To cut down on time I just used my bread machine to knead the dough.  I was unable to purchase the asian barbequed pork, but I just marinaded the pork in hoisin sauce and broiled it.  It turned out great!

YUUUUM!!! Wow...I can't believe these turned out sOo good! They took quite a while and a lot of effort (I don't have a bread machine so I had to knead myself). But, it was well worth it!! I could not find any bbq pork either so I just took a pork loin and cooked it all day in the crock pot with lots of chinese bbq sauce & garlic. Very good on it's own by the way! Then, followed the directions exactly. best Pork Buns I have ever had!! My picky boyfriend thought they were excellent as well! ThanXx sOo much for the recipe!!

this recipe is a keeper. Just a note, to make the bun texture softer and smoother, use cake flour (you can buy in asian store), and to make the taste richer, use milk instead of water. These 2 changes make the bun really supple and beautifully shaped.

A decent dish; I'd be willing to cook it again.  Although the filling was a tad too sweet, I nevertheless got used to it and ended up liking it more than the filling of some buns I've bought in restaurants.  The dough was a little dry, yeasty, and bland, not quite as sweet as most buns, but not really bothersome.
 

Like another reviewer observed, the directions are incorrect.  I cut the dough recipe in half without changing the quantity of meat and even then I ended up with a bit more dough than I needed.
 

In step one, the yeast-flour-water mixture never bubbled.
 

In step four, follow the directions and put only two tablespoons of filling in each bun.  (I was tempted to put in more.  I was wrong.)  If you use enough dough in a bun so that you can put in, say, two heaping tablespoons comfortably, the bun will end up uncomfortably large.  And you'll also end up with an imbalance between meat and bread in each bite.
 

I also learned that one should make the dough thinner than one thinks.  (The dough rises a lot.)  But the hardest thing about making buns is getting the dough to be a uniform thickness on all sides.  I guess I just need to practice how to make a bun with a good balance of meat and dough everywhere.
 

Following my revised recipe makes two _main course_ servings.
 

If you freeze the buns before steaming, they freeze well.
 

Incidentally, it took me 2.5 hours to cook from start to finish.

Excellent recipe.  Very easy. However, I doubled the amount of filling and still ran short.  Well worth the time and effort.

Oh man, so good! I used leftover pulled pork I had in the freezer and drained it. I then added Hoisin sauce and the other sauces stated in the recipe. Hubby brought a bamboo steamer last night, so I just had to test it out. DH said they tasted like authentic Dim Sum. Thanks so much Teresa!

My bread machine's dough cycle made short work of the dough because it is a little on the sticky side.  I couldn't find Chinese barbecue pork so I took a previous reviewer's suggestion of marinating pork tenderloin in hoisin sauce and chinese five spice powder.  The glaze took a while to thicken so I ended up adding 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch to speed up the process.

We've never had pork buns before and we thought these were delicious.  The buns really glued themselves to the steamer though.  I used half wheat, half white flour for the dough and the bread machine to knead it for me.  Also, just used some leftover pulled pork with Hoisin sauce mixed in, great way to use leftovers.

i made these yesterday, and i cut the recipe in half. they were really good, the filling wasn't what i had had expected, probably because we used regular pork in place of "Asia barbecued pork". We found that their wasn't enough filling, but otherwise the buns were tasty. Also, my dough never rose as much as the recipe said, whether it was a problem with the yeast or it just isn't supposed to, i'm not sure.

I made this recipe for a Birthday surprise for my best friend.  This is one of her favorite foods!  

The recipe was very easy, though I didn't know where to buy the Asian BBQ pork so I purchase pork chops and added hoisen sauce.  E did not use sesame oil or the oyster sauce. She doesn't like onions so I used only a tiny sprinkle of dried minced onions.  

She LOVED the buns and ate the entire 24 buns within a week!  She said that the bun part was perfect and just the right consistency but that the meat needed a little more sweetness. (Probably because I didn't use the Asian pork.)  I will make them again but add a bit more sugar for her taste.  

Thanks for this AWESOME recipe!! A+++

I had left over pulled pork so I used it instead of the prepared pork, just added some bottled Asian bar b q sauce.  Then added  other spices till I liked it.  One pound of pork only made 20 buns.  No steamer, so I used my turkey roaster and added a rack held above the water with some old cans.  I used cupcake papers instead of foil.  They freeze perfect and to reheat, I pull them out of the freezer, cover with a damp paper towel and microwave for about 45 seconds.

I have made this recipe twice now. I'd never tasted steamed buns before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really like them! The buns have a pleasing, spongy texture with just a hint of sweetness (wouldn't change a thing with that part of the recipe). The filling was a little overwhelming for me on the first go-round. The corn starch solidified really quickly and the flavor  wasn't quite what I was looking for. Therefore, I made the following changes the second time: 1) omitted oyster sauce and added more soy sauce, some fish sauce, siracha, garlic powder, minced ginger, sesame oil and honey. I didn't measure any of these, but the ginger was especially nice... I might not use the sesame oil next time 2) mixed all sauce ingredients and the water and corn starch together beforehand so they could be added all at once. I'll certainly be making this again. My husband likes to fry them a bit when he eats them as leftovers. I think they're very yummy cold.

I used some smoked sparerib meat for the pork.  It was  good first attempt, but the proportion of filling to dough I off - as others have noted.  It ends up being too doughy! And the dough had crust after steaming and was a bit heavier than  I remember from my Chinatown adventures. Worth tinkering with though.

Very easy to follow. I substituted chopped chicken mixed with coconut cream powder, curry powder and ginger and green onions, and a little broth to make it combine, for the filling. Just because I can't find any good Asian barbecue pork where I live now.
