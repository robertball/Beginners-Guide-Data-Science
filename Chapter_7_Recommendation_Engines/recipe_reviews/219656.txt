I've made a recipe similar to this before and it was good but your addition of curry makes it perfect! If you you love curry I suggest to double the amount.

The reason I have to reduce your recipe to four stars is because the baking time of 90 minutes for this amount of boneless chicken is overkill that creates tough dried out meat. For moist tender chicken check for doneness at 40 to 45 minutes.

This recipe sounds delicious, but there has got to be a mistake in the cook time.  90 minutes on 350 degrees for boneless chicken breasts?  They would be dried up and shriveled!!

I have made this exact recipe and it is Great. If you like curry and mushrooms add more than the recipe suggests. It makes great leftovers too.

amazeballs!  instead of canned mushrooms I used fresh (shitake and crimini), and instead of cheddar I used what I had on hand (leftover chunk of asiago + some fontina) and cooked for 40 minutes (NOT 90!), and it was so yummy!  The sauce ends up the consistency of broth, NOT creamy, but the sauce was absolutely delicious.  This recipe is a keeper and is going into my rotation.  Thanks for sharing Fernando D'Agostino!

This looked like a good candidate to adapt to use with leftover roast chicken, so I gave it a shot. I didn't have any canned mushrooms, so I skipped those. I used regular cream of mushroom soup instead of the lower-sodium option, which was a mistake. Between the salt in the soup and the salt in the Cheddar cheese, this was darn near uneatable. Of course, my tolerance for salt has decreased dramatically over time, so its likely I'm more sensitive to it than the average person. Nontheless, those of us watching our sodium levels might find this too salty to bear.

On the positive side, the flavor of this dish was excellent and I'm going to give it a try with some changes. Specifically, I'll try it with the raw chicken breasts next time, I'll use the lower sodium mushroom soup, and a different brand of cheese since the one I used was over-salty in another recipe I made too. Also, I'll serve it with steamed (and unsalted!) rice which will help cut the salt impact. Yes, it tasted good enough to try it again, and hopefully I can give it a higher rating next time!

Oh - one more thing. Since several people complained it was too watery, I mixed in 1.5T of flour with the soup/garlic/curry mix. This provided a slight thickening of the gravy that was just perfect.

I'm not sure why this recipe was listed as low carb, as canned mushroom soup has quite a few carbs.

Really easy and oh so good.  I didn't put the cheese on it and it was still really good.  I don't use mushrooms from the jar because of the texture issue.  I used fresh and they worked out fine. I cut the recipe in half and had lots of sauce which was really good on mashed red potatoes.

A slight variation with cream of celery soup, Marsala wine, chicken tenderloins, paprika added to sauce. I split the sauce in half, and with one half added uncooked rice, about a cup. I covered the bottom of the pan with it. I used the other portion to coat the chicken pieces. Then poured the rest on top. Covered with a cup of shredded cheddar.  Cooked 45 minutes stirring once to ensure all rice was covered with sauce. Chicken was tender, moist and flavor incredible. The Marsala gave it an interesting flair! Thank you for this simple, yet elegant meal.

I loved this! Mine came out a little watery, but still was very good. I dont care for leftovers but the next day the chicken was even better. The cooking time was too long also. I rated the recipe 4 stars because of the cooking time and how it turned out watery. I would rate the taste 4 stars!

I just finished this dish. We did not like it at all.  Followed the recipe exactly except used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup. Will not make again.

This recipe was ok. I am assuming that it wasn't as great as others comments because I used a sweet white wine instead of dry.

I made this and it was delish and easy to do on a week night. I only cooked for 60 minutes.  This is very tasty and my family loved it.  My husband is picky and he really liked it.  Well done and thank you

This was pretty good. I used fresh mushrooms because I don't like the texture of canned, and cut the cooking time in half. 90 minutes for chicken breasts, even if they started off frozen solid, is WAY too long. Served over rice. With the changes, this was a keeper.

Followed other reviewers and cut the cooking time.  I didn't have cream of anything soup so I made my own. It would have been richer and thicker if I had used canned soup.  I used extra curry but thought cheese with curry wasn't right so I left that out.

This was the bomb.com! Excellent way to use up leftover wine and very economical to boot.  Served with garlic buttered egg noodles & corn. Must also note that it only took about 40-45 minutes to cook. Will make again & thanks 4 sharing!

I used cream of onion soup and used half white wine/half chicken broth.  Very good!  Next time I'll make rice as a side to have with the sauce.
