Greens were larger from mid-summer season so salt-soaked and salt-boiled for a bit longer.  As I had it on hand, I used chicken fat skimmed from soup instead of other fats to saute them.  Doubled the garlic and added black pepper at the same time as garlic to cook a moment before adding the boiled greens.  The onions caramelized, which along with red pepper flakes, was the making of this dish.   Served them with dollop of plain Greek yogurt, and then ate leftovers cold the next morning with curried scrambled eggs.  Delicious and not bitter at all!!

Good recipe. I boiled the greens for about 15 minutes to remove more bitterness. Adding the parmesan at the end really mellows the flavor. A great way to eat weeds!

I added some mushrooms that we really needed to use up, and the earthiness really added to an already great dish! Served with steak, the dinner was a smash!

I had never had dandelion greens before but was curious to try them.  Started caramelizing the onions then added the garlic, pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  I boiled the greens as directed, then added them to the onion saute.  Stirred it all together for a minute or two, then added some crumbled goat cheese (instead of parmesan) and a squeeze of lemon juice before plating.  Added sunflower seeds after plating.  Delicious!

The best!!! My family loves greens and I am always on the lookout for something new and fun. When I had tried feeding them dandelion greens before they all thought they were too bitter but boiling in a salt water bath did the trick and the seasonings were sooo good. I did put my favorites for greens on the table tabasco and vinegar but even without those I loved this recipe. Thanks a bunch :) oh yeah be sure to double or triple this you will need lots and they do cook down...

Next time I would boil them longer, maybe 8-10 minutes to get them less bitter. A little more garlic and add salt while sauteing.

Carmelizing a whole onion really gives this dish the sweetness that the bitter greens need, I think.  Wonderful with some cannelini beans on the side.

I am rating this recipe 4 stars because: 1. The kidlets did not like it at all but I thought it was pretty good considering it's dandelion greens. 2. The kick was a bit too much so next time I would half the red pepper flakes. The only thing I did differently was to slightly caramelize the onions. Served with Summer Squash Chicken Alfredo and Roasted Green Beans.

Tastes the dandelion greens raw and they were disgustingly bitter---wasn't sure I could find a use. Tried this recipe- followed recommendations to soak longer and boil longer. Came out great! Bitterness was basically gone! I doubled the garlic, added splash of lemon juice when cooking greens and then mixed it with white kidney beans & hot sausage. Since I added hot sausage I omitted red pepper flakes from the greens. Delicious hearty meal.

Actually not bad at all. I got dandelion greens in my CSA box and had NO idea what to do with them. I was worried they'd be bitter like mustard or turnip greens. But I soaked, boiled, and then sauteed these, and they were actually really nice. Similar to spinach. What made them was the carmelized onions... added nice sweetness.

I had 4 large bunches of greens. I used the stems and leaves and it yielded 4 cups of cooked greens after boiling. Also used 1 tablespoon of unrefined coconut oil instead of the 3 tbsp of olive oil and butter combined. The slight coconut flavor from the oil helped to balance the bitterness of the greens and 1 tbsp was plenty. Tasty dish.

Good recipe.  Will make again, I liked the technique.  Not sure how 1 lb can feed 4 people, by the time I cooked them down I had about 1/2 cup total!

My first time ever making dandelion greens. My husband isn't  a fan of any greens but eats them for the health benefits. I am always trying to find ways to make them tasty. This was a great base recipe, but of course I like to add my own twist. I used bacon grease for my fat.  I caramelized the onions for a good 30 mins so they would get nice and sweet.  I even added a touch of honey to help the sweetness. I also used my homemade vegetable bouillon as seasoning, and added a diced small tomato to add acidity. Along with the garlic and some jalapeno this turned out delish!! I am glad I soaked them in icy, salt water for a good 15-20 mins, boiled for about 5-6 mins. Then sauteed with the rest of the ingredients for a few mins. Not too bitter at all, the sweetness and acidity gave it a great balance of flavors. Oh, and we also squeezed some lemon juice right before we ate it. No complaints and I will definitely make this again.

A good recipe following reviewers' advice. I gathered up a couple of pounds of wild dandelions and followed shelbriggs' suggestion to use more dandelions than the recipe called for. I also used Miss KJ and Carjaq's advice by boiling them for about ten minutes to get the bitterness out.  It worked. You really do need more than a pound as the dandelions cook down about like spinach. This recipe is really for two people rather than four. I liked the flavor added by the red pepper flakes. I'll be making dandelions again with this recipe.

I had never dared to try dandelion greens before and both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did feel that the greens were not as sharp as I had expected, and I'm not sure whether that is because I bought organic greens in the supermarket or whether soaking them took away more of the sharp flavor than I would have liked.  I am a bit uncomfortable with digging them out of my lawn.  I know I don't put anything poisonous down on the grass, but still, it makes me nervous.

I boiled it for about 6 minutes. Next time I would just add a sprinkle of red pepper.  I'm not fond of hot food.  My husband loved it just the way it was.  Definitely make it again.

This was my first time working with dandelion greens and I was wildly skeptical they could be so good simply because they are so terribly bitter en masse. 
It was delicious! The cold salt water helped enormously to bring out the bitterness. But I think it was sautéing it with onions (I used shallots) and garlic in butter then topping it Parmesan that really brought this home. It makes for a very comforting side, I think I’ll have a poached egg with them next time. Thanks!

I always wanted to cook with dandelions but had no prior experience so I followed this recipe and found it to be a welcomed success. However, a mild bitterness lingered in my dandelions so I added a bit of lemon juice and sauteed them again just long enough to heat the lemon juice. This instantly remedied the bitterness and my and I  are most eager to partake in this new dish.

This was super easy and delicious.  I did not use salt or cheese, but added some dried cranberries and a bit of fresh lemon juice at the end.  Yummy!

Boiled it about 10 minutes, and used a little less red pepper.  Other than that, followed the instructions exactly and it turned out delicious.  Will definitely make it again.

I made these tonight with the Awesome Crispy Baked Chicken Wing Recipe and they were so good. The taste reminds me of Asparagus for some reason. They were really good though! Thank you for sharing!

Extra Parmesan & plenty of sunflower seeds, which provided a nice crunch & nutty taste
