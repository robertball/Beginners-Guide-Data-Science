I made a single batch of these to test the recipe, before making 2 dozen to take to an event.  The first ones came out perfectly - at 25 minutes I wasn't sure they were done, but took them out anyway, figuring if they didn't set up I could bake the next ones longer.  They tasted great after cooling and chilling, so I made the bigger batch the next day exactly the same - only difference was I used foil cupcake liners instead of paper - and they were full of cracks after 25 min!  The next pan I checked at 15 min, and some of them were already starting to crack so I took them out.  So beware, if you try the foil liners, they cook MUCH faster - but they do look a little nicer (the ones that didn't crack!) since the liner doesn't get all soggy looking.  Oh, and I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have fresh lemons on hand, and didn't want too strong a lemon flavor.  Yummy, thanks for a great recipe!

All I can say is WOW this was good! I wanted to make my husband a cheesecake for Father's Day but I didnt want to make a whole one. We are on a diet and we would eat a whole cheesecake if I made one. lol This was definitely the right recipie though! I tried this one because it has a graham cracker crust instead of the vanila wafer crust used in other similar recipies. They tasted just wonderful. It was easy to control portion size so we didnt go too crazy on the calories but we still got to eat some very tasty cheesecake. It was a very elegant presentation too. After they were cooled in the pan, I ran a thin knife around the edge and they came out easy. I served them graham cracker crust side up and drizzled on some sugar free strawberry glaze. My husband got his favorite desert to make him happy and we didnt have to completely wreck our diet to do it. I cant recomend this recipie enough if you want a delicious and  authentic cheesecake taste in managable portion size.

AWESOME!!  I doubled the recipe to get 12 jumbo sized cheesecakes.   I did up the graham cracker bottoms for a thicker crust.  I used some gold foil lined cup cake holders and some in paper liners.  The foil lined was easier to peel away from the cheesecakes.  Several of mine cracked on the top but covered with the delicious Strawberry Supreme Topping and crushed graham crackers.  Will definitely put this in my dessert rotation.

Really good! Made these for our baby's first birthday. He loved smooshing up his cake and we enjoyed our individual portions. I made a sour cream topping for these - Mixed 4 ounces sour cream with 3T sugar and 1 t vanilla extract. Once the cakes were baked through, I spread this topping over the cakes and returned them to the oven for an additional 10 minutes. This adds a creamy layer on top that puts this cheesecake into the DIVINE category.

Definitely a 5 star recipe for taste and simplicity! SO much easier and faster then making an entire cheesecake!! I don't like using Nilla Wafers as a crust since they get soggy so this is so much better. Watch them as they cook as every oven is different. They will be puffy and slightly jiggly when ready. As they cool they sink down in the middle and allow for toppings! A wonderful base for a million creative options. some i've tried... 1) mix in a cup of mini chocolate chips into batter. when cooled drizzle chocolate or caramel on top. 2) after cooled microwave 1/2 C of seedless raspberry jam for 25 seconds, stir, and top. melt white chocolate and drizzle on top of that. 3) use canned cherry OR blueberry pie filling. 4) use Oreo crumbs instead of graham. The ideas are endless!

These did not taste like cheesecake at all! More like a lemon bar! I realized my mistake as soon as I put the zest in! Why would cheesecake have lemon zest in it? I should have picked the zest out - that would have saved these. Had I wanted a lemon dessert I would have made one. If you do not want a STRONG lemon flavor I recommend you stop right here and find another recipe. I will not make again as written. UPDATE: I had to try these again without the lemon. I eliminated the lemon juice and the zest and increased the vanilla extract to 1/2tsp and these were wonderful! With these adjustments they were actually 'mini cheesecakes'!

I made this being skeptical because I have another recipe for a large cheesecake that I love. However, these turned out great. I read a few reviews before hand, but I didn't change anything on the recipe besides I didn't put the lemon zest in. I didn't read all the reviews, so someone may have already mentioned this, but when I cook a cheesecake, I put a pan of water on the bottom rack. I did that with these. I also learned that you NEVER want to open the oven door because for whatever reason, that is what causes the cracks. So, I used the pan of water on the bottom and didn't open the door for 25 minutes and they turned out gorgeous. No cracks and beautiful appearance. Thanks for sharing!

This recipes was delicious and super easy to make. I bought the mini graham cracker tart shells and this recipes makes exactly 6 mini cheesecakes. I used bottled RealLemon lemon juice and didn't use any zest and the cheesecakes were fabulous. Make extra cheesecakes because they will go very fast.

This recipe has been around for a looong time -nearly as long as I have!  The reason?  They're easy, they're simple, they're reliable and they're "D" good. I used foil cupcake liners to eliminate the sticking problem. The lemon zest and juice amounts are right on perfect.  I made a raspberry coulis of fresh raspberries and Splenda, and accented with a few extra fresh berries and mint. Impressive and elegant  if I must say so myself, especially for something so doggone simple.

Awesome recipe!  I added a little extra to the graham crust to make it a little thicker.  I also added 2 tablespoons sour cream and 1 teaspoon flour to the cream cheese mixture.  I also line my muffin pans with foil muffin liners.  This made it easy to remove and refridgerate.  This is easy to make and takes just as good (if not better) than those cheesecakes that take 6 hours to make.

I made this today (minus the lemon juice and lemon zest - not a fan of lemon) and thought it was really great.  It was so quick and easy.  My fussy sisters who don't even know how to turn on the oven gave it 4 stars but I'm ignoring them.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent!  This was perfect to curb my cheesecake craving since there are only 4 of us and I didn't want to make a regular sized cheesecake.  We ate ours plain, with no toppings and it was delicious!  Make it the day before you will serve it and it tastes even better!

These are super easy and taste great!  I am afraid to make cheesecake because it seems easy to ruin...and maybe I can put it off for a few more years because these are terrific!  Like others I made supreme strawberry topping - yum!  The graham crust is so yummy.  Very good for guests.

These are soooo unbelievably good and so simple to make! I've made them twice in two days! I did make some very slight adjustments... I left out the lemon zest and added a little extra vanilla to balance out the lemon flavor.   I'm sure that these are great with the graham cracker crust but I didn't have graham crackers so after lining the muffin pans with cupcake liners I placed one ginger snap face up in each one to serve as the crust. Ginger Snaps make an amazing crust as they soften a little while baking and taste very similar to a graham cracker. Also, you save some calories since you don't have to add butter and sugar.   Last tip: I baked in a water bath - not sure how these do without a water bath.  Great Recipe! I will make pumpkin and chocolate variations over the holidays. Thanks!

This recipe is quick, simple & extremely easy to make.  If you cant get this right you need NOT be in the kitchen doing ANYTHING!  I've made this recipe several times over the past few weeks opting for different variations of flavors.  I made the crust with crushed vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers as that is what we prefer =)  I like this recipe best as it makes exactly 6 regular cupcake size cheesecakes (PERFECT!!). First batch I added chopped pecans & mini chocolate chips between the baked cookie crust & the filling.  Before baking I swirled a little caramel sauce onto the filling & took a toothpick & incorporated it into the filling prior to baking.  Once they came out & cooled,  I topped them w/more chopped pecans, mini chocolate chip morsels & drizzled w/caramel sauce (the one from starbucks works best in my opinion) DEEE-LISHH!  Second batch I pureed some raspberries & swirled that into the filling before baking.  Once they were cooled off, I topped w/a few fresh raspberries & a little of the puree.  These were dee-lish too.  I've also made a key-lime batch using key-lime extract (zest & juice) in addition to the vanilla.  The key to a perfect cheesecake EVERY time is a water bath.  Your desserts will come our picture perfect & creamy w/each batch.  I placed my cupcake pan on top of my cookie sheet (its about 1/2 inch deep) & poured boiling hot water onto the sheet prior placing in the oven.  The opportunities are endless with this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!

I loved this recipe, It was very creamy, not dry and not cakey like most of the recipes I've found. Although I would NOT use the lemon zest, I didnt like the citrusy tang it gave it althought it wasnt overbearing.

I made these cute little desserts for the Superbowl party I just attended. I followed the recipe exactly except to double it- and use 1/2 neufchatel.  I chose it because it has a graham cracker base. I served with fruit toppings- using "Blueberry Breakfast Sauce" from this site as a base- but doubled the corn starch- and using strawberries for half, and apple & spices (making apple pie type topping) for the other half. I checked them near the end of  baking and was surprised to see that they were very puffed up and cracked.  Then when I took them out they deflated a little. I may have done something wrong but the toppings hid everything... and the flavor was amazing. Even after everyone was stuffed, people took seconds of this dessert and were actually groaning at how good it was! Thank you for this recipe! It's going to be one I keep making and making! I want to try a chocolate ganache topping next time!

My girlfriend and I tested these in mini cupcake size for a party I am doing next week. They were so easy I thought I had forgotten something. I put 1 tsp graham cracker crust in each cup and filled almost to top. The recipe made 24 mini mini cheesecake cupcakes. I baked for 12 min and they were DELISH and perfect. For the party event I am going to add mini choc chips and top with 3 minis and drizzle with choc for 12, plain with strawberry filling on top drizzled with milk choc for 12 and for the last 12 I am going to put a piece of mini peanut butter cup on top and crust and top with filling and finish with a piece of the pb cup finishing off with a drizzle of choc. This recipe is so adaptable. Try it, you will love it.

I followed this recipe exactly- 10 stars! One thing i changed was i used paper muffin cups-but that wasn't nessecary. I was lacking one paper thing, so i greased one of the cups. It came out perfectly without muffin cups. I DO NOT like cheesecake, I repeat, I do not like cheesecake, but I ate these with delight. The only cheesecake i will ever eat from now on. The lemon zest and juice is what gave them their uniqueness and flavor. My parents say that this is the best cheesecake they have ever tasted- and they've eaten at 5-star restaurants. Thank You!

I made these and they are amazing! The small amount of sugar is for the crust (I didn't catch that!). I didn't use cupcake wrappers, wished I did. Added fresh raspberries to the tops. I would highly recommend! Easy enough for beginning bakers like myself.

I will probably make these again. Good texture but they were overly lemony.  I just wanted cheesecake, not lemon cheesecake.  Next time I make it, I will leave out the juice and/or reduce the amount of zest.  I think it needs some lemon, just not as much as the recipe called for.

Easy and yummy. I skipped the zest and only added a little lemon flavor.  Also, I made a fruit sauce topping that was tasty over the top.  Will use this recipe again!

Wow, wow & a double wow. First time making a bake cheesecake. Super easy, elegant looking & taste fabulous. I used speculoos (belgian cookie) crumbs as we can't get graham cracker here in France, didn't bother with the 1 tlbsp sugar as the cookies are sweet enough & i cut down the sugar in the cream cheese too. I use mascapone cream cheese. Cooked some frozen cherries with sugar till syrupy & it's to die for!

This was my first attempt at cheesecake and it was wonderful! Brought these to a party and everyone thought that I baked all day, took me less than an hour. Super easy and flavorful. I tripled the recipe and made 18 cups. Maybe it was my oven but i had to bake them a little longer than 25 minutes, I watched to see the tops of the cakes to crack a little before i pulled them from the oven, and that resulted in perfect cheesecake texture.

I don't think the amount of margarine was enough. The btm of the cheesecake remained crumby instead of wet and caky. To me, cheesecakes tasted OK but a bit too sweet (even though I added less sugar than originally called for.) My daughter really disliked the texture and the flavor of the cheesy part of the cheesecake.

This was excellent!  I didn't have any lemons so I just added more lemon juice.  Instead of using a regular sized muffin pan, I used a mini muffin tin with paper muffin cups.  I baked it for 20 minutes, and topped the mini muffins with blueberry pie topping.  They were a total hit and my family is begging me to make triple the amount for our Thanksgiving party.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written and basked in the accolades of my husband and friends. They were part of my contribution to Saturday dinner at our friends' house. I served with a fresh strawberry on top and Strawberry Supreme Topping.

Okay, the next time I make these, I'm going to put muffin cups in the muffin tin. I lost a lot of the graham cracker crust trying to get them out of the tin.

I will also use the tip of a water bath in order to avoid cracking. 

I have never made cheesecake before and I found it easy and tasty. I will make these again, maybe even use a mini tin for a dessert tray.

I modified the recipe slightly based on some other comments, and they came out amazing.  I didn't add any lemon juice or zest.  For the topping I purchased frozen mixed berries, blended some with sugar to make a puree, poured about a tablespoon on each cheesecake, then topped them off with 2-3 whole berries.  Delicious!!!

YUM!  These are so good, and so darned adorable!  I did change things a little- I didn't know how many graham crackers made 1/3 cup, so I just crushed up 3.  Turns out that makes more like 1/2-2/3 of a cup, so I upped the sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons and the butter to 2 tablespoons.  Then for the cheesecakes themselves, I changed the recipe by using low fat cream cheese (Neufchatel), 1/3 cup sugar, and a tablespoon of lemon juice because I didn't have any lemon zest.  Next time I will use the 1 1/2 t lemon juice and the 1/2 t lemon zest like the recipe says because I love lemon zest in cheesecake!  I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on some of them before they went in the oven.  I only had to bake them for 15 minutes- by that time they had puffed up slightly and only jiggled a little when I shook the pan.  They turned out beautifully and didn't crack.  I topped them with some freezer strawberry jam that I made earlier in the month.  The papers came off quite easily and the crust was the perfect thickness- I think you could actually eat it with your fingers and not worry about it falling apart.  They tasted great, too- my fiance (who loves cheesecake) said they deserve 100 stars, especially the ones with the chocolate chips.

I doubled the recipe but only used 1 Tbs. of lemon juice and added 1 Tbs. of vanilla. Didn't want it to be too lemon-y. =) I also used paper muffin cups for easy removing and it turned out pretty good. Topped it off with a peanut butter-chocolate sauce and a raspberry for cuteness. Will definitely make again.

These turned out great! I substituted extra vanilla in the place of the lemon juice so the total vanilla was 1 3/4 tsp and I didn't add any lemon. I wanted the traditional cheesecake flavor which was perfect. I did substitute butter for margarine. I also used a mini muffin pan size so I made about 22 mini size. I didn't use wrappers so it was tricky getting them out. Next time I will use the wrappers. Mini size was a perfect bite size. Took about 10-11 mins but I used a convection oven at 300 degrees.

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  I wish people weren't omitting the lemon because it makes the flavor just the way it shoudl be, it makes it taste like cheesecake, not like lemon cheesecake.  Thank you so much for this.

These turned out perfectly, better than I expected.  The only thing I was concerned about was having them stick to the liners when trying to remove them, but they came out with ease. Mine sunk just a tiny bit while cooling, but that made the perfect little spot to put the filling in.   I doubled the recipe and got 24 cheesecakes in my mini muffin tin and 6 regular sized cupcake cheesecakes.  I topped some with cherries and some with strawberries.  They were very popular at the potluck that I took them to. 11/23  I made these for a pre-Thanksgiving party, and they were a huge hit.  I exchanged all of the lemon ingredients for orange, and then topped with Cranberry Sauce (from this site) and Frosted Cranberries (also from this site).  These came out perfect looking and tasted wonderful.  Will become a new addition to my Thanksgiving and Christmas treats.

These were so super easy to make. I doubled the recipe to make exactly 12 mini cheesecakes. Cooked exactly 25 minutes, these came out perfect! Can't wait to try with an Oreo crust, and perhaps some raspberry topping. This is my go-to cheesecake recipe now.

I made these on Friday evening for an event on Saturday afternoon and everybody loved them...I doubled the recipe and did 1/2 with cherry and 1/2 with blueberry. The recipe was easy to follow and simply to make...Today I got a call asking me to make 6 dozen for a church group, I think that speaks for itself!!!

These are GREAT.  The only things I changed were to double the crust, whip my (room temperature) cream cheese completely before doing *anything* else, and to omit the lemon completely.  These are delicious and tender little cakes that easily came out of the paper cups I put them in.  Great recipe!

great recipe! Super easy AND quick! I made some changes however - I used half the lemon juice, took out the lemon zest and doubled the vanilla extract. The lemon juice adds good acidity to the fattiness of the cream cheese, but adding 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon juice makes it a bit too lemony :) I also baked them at 300 degrees rather than 325 degrees for about 16 minutes (I doubled the batch so it may be less for a single batch). Once they are done baking, turn off the oven and crack the oven door - leave the mini cheesecakes in the oven until the oven is done cooling (this is KEY to preventing cracks in the cheesecake!!) Overall this recipe is great. I used foil liners and sprayed the inside of them with canola oil spray so they peel off easier. I went simple with the topping and just sliced raw strawberries on top - looks great and adds great flavor!

Excellent.  I've made it a few times because I keep getting requests for it. I used real butter instead of margarine for better flavor.

I love It!!!!!!!  These were so cute and i really liked that these were so easy to make! I followed the directions just as they were and didn't change anything. they turned out great. don't get fooled by the addition of lemons in the recipe, it does not take like lemon bars or anything of that sort, this was a tasty classic cheesecake. these were a big hit at the baby shower and they were absolutely adorable!! Definitely a 5 star, and definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! They were really good without the hassle of making a whole cheesecake.  I took the baking time down  a couple of minutes and doubled the recipe and they came out perfect. Used chopped strawberries and strawberry glaze as topping

These were delicious!  I recommend making them ahead of time- more than a day- they taste even better after chilling longer in the fridge!

I just made these tonight and they came out absolutely perfect and were super simple to make!!! They were sooo delicious and the perfect portion size! The recipe made 6 mini cheesecakes using a regular sized muffin tin. I did bake them for the full 25 mins in the oven along side a small pan of water ( the moisture of the water in the air helps to prevent cracks). I topped them with a fresh strawberry coulis sauce that i made by chopping fresh strawberries and heating them in a saucepan with a spoonfull of sugar, a tsp of lemon zest and a splash of orange juice, then i strained the sauce and spooned it over each little cheesecake when they were cool. This is a new fave go-to dessert for my family. Im 100% satistfied with the results of this great recipe!

Excellent! I left out the lemon zest and juice. I like that this recipe makes a small batch because there are only 2 of us who like cheesecake. We ate these plain without a topping, and they were delicious.

Very good, but I didn't like it so much with the lemon juice, so I will make it without next time, I also made it with coconut sugar (so its sugar free) and made it crustless, came out like little cheesecake cookies! But they didn't stick, just an FYI for those of you on low carb diets! ;)

followed the recipe to a T and the cheesecakes came out perfect. not too sweet and a bit tangy, just the way i like my cheesecake. next time i'll double the recipe so everyone in my family can have 3 each. if it's your first time baking a cheesecake, this recipe is perfect. it's basically fool proof. thank you so much for sharing this with us!

Great recipe. I'd have given it 5 stars but the cracker layer was too oily. Next time I'll cut down the butter to crackers ratio. I also took the other reviewers advice and took out the lemon zest, the flavor was great.

These were decent. They're easy to make and look presentable if you're doing a filling (I used the strawberry glaze filling from the Strawberry Glazed Pie recipe on this site). As someone who loves lemon, though, the flavor was a little overpowering. If you're making these for a specific group of people who you know love bright citrus-y flavors, go right ahead and follow the recipe. If you're baking for a more general audience, like a pot luck or bale sale, I'd say keep the zest and cut out the juice.

I made this recipe because I was looking for a dessert recipe for Memorial weekend. I thought they tasted pretty good, but the lemon taste was a little strong for cheesecake I thought. If I made them again in the future I would probably use the lemon juice and leave out the rind. I only had low fat cream cheese but would use the regular next time as I believe it made them a bit softer. Although, they did harden up fine once in the fridge overnight. I topped them with whipped cream, strawberries, and blueberries and they presented well. These can really be decorated in so many different ways which is the best part.

I made these in a mini muffin pan so it made quite a few bite sized treats. I had a little trouble with the crust staying together...some problem with the graham cracker to butter ratio I think. I also forgot the egg (oops!) but they still turned out delicious! I made a sweet strawberry sauce to top them. I will definitely be making these again...watching the directions a little more carefully... to get the wonderful results everyone else got!!

I varied this by leaving out the lemon juice and zest... Added 1/2 a Hershey's Bar to half the filling, then layered the plain filling then the chocolate filling.. Baked regular temperature for about 23 minutes, then added a layer of chopped Reese Cups, then baked the additional 2 minutes.. AWESOME...

I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. I skipped the lemon zest and bought the mini graham crust shells and then followed the recipe. Mine were ready at about 19-20 minutes. I left them for 2 extra minutes and they cracked. After letting them cool for a few minutes the middle sank in a little and the cracks weren't as noticeable. I drizzled them with Hershey's Strawberry syrup... this was my 1st time baking a cheesecake, really easy to make.. highly recommend :)

I made this yesterday and the only problem was I only made 12 :) I added extra crust to the bottoms, but still only baked per recipe. I used paper baking cups as I was afraid of them not releasing easily. Those worked perfectly.  Next time I'm making at least 24. My husband told me less lemon next time, but I really liked it as is. I topped them with some strawberry and apricot preserves that I heated together in a small sauc epan and let cool. That was much better than pie filling which I've used in the past.

I made these little guys for a birthday party with 6 guests.  All I can say is that each person was disappointed when they heard there was only 1 per person!  They were that good!  I was very pleased with the portion size, since I'm watching my calories.

Great base recipe! Followed the recipe exactly and it made six beautiful cheesecake cupcakes. The consistency was creamy and sweet. The only thing I would change is to reduce or eliminate the lemon zest and/or juice. It came out too tangy. Other than that,  great base recipe that you can change to suit your tastes!

They were nothing short of amazing.  I used greased silicone cupcake pans (just push up on the bottom of each cup, and the cheesecake pops out unharmed) floated in a large square baking dish filled with water, leaving the cups submerged.  This is essential to preventing the outside of the cheesecake from baking faster than the inside, which can result in cheesecake nightmares.  Fantastic recipe!

i double the recipe to make 12 mini cheesecakes. i also upped the amt of crust since i like crust. i used the zest of 1 large lemon and the juice of 1/2 a large lemon which was more than 3 teaspoons but i like a lemony taste. i tasted the batter b4 it went in the oven to make sure it was not too sour or else i wouldve had to add more sugar. i topped w/ blueberry sauce. delicious!

The little cakes seemed to pick up some of the flavor of the muffin tin, I did not use a non-stick, just a regular ol' tin.  They didn't want to come out so I ran a knife around the edges to get them out; 5 of 6 survived.  Once I placed them on a plate and set them in the fridge they stuck and I had to pry them off.  I'll stick to using cupcake liners but I like that the scale of this recipe since it's just me and I can enjoy cheesecake without making a ton.

I made these for Valentine's day for a treat.  This was a very simple recipe that was good.  My father, and grandfather are diabetic, so I sub. the white sugar with diabetic sugar.  Could not tell the difference.  My father said they were very good, and he didn't notice any change, and he usually does.

These were wonderful, made them with other "mini" desserts for a baby shower.  Topped with assorted fresh berries, and kiwi.  Easy to make too.  Will make again.

These turned out just as delicious as the big cheesecakes, only a lot less baking time! I made 18 of these for a baby shower today. I topped half with blueberry pie filling. The plain cheesecakes were enjoyed just as much, if not more, than those with topping. I look forward to making these again just for my family. Thanks for sharing!

The recipe was quick and good. Topped with strawberries and blueberries it was even better.  The recipe calls for 1 rounded tablespoon graham cracker filling in each muffin cup and it should be 1 rounded tsp for each I believe.

Very good and very easy! Perfect for someone to make a little bit but not the whole cake. Even my husband, a cheesecake connoisseur, loved them! Thanks!

i thought this recipe was great... it was my first time making cheesecake and it turned out wonderful with the instructions here for six mini-cakes. i followed it exactly and only made one change that i think definitely made it my own--i used some homemade chocolate chocolate chip cookies for the crust! yum yum indeed especially with a topping   fresh raspberries (one or two per cake) and a dollop of whip cream (just a little) and  i also garnished with a mint leave... perfecto!

Wonderful. Made these in a mini muffin tin- which I think is why they fell apart a little. Still served the ones intact and they were GREAT! Next time will do as recipe suggests- in regular size muffin tin. Easy and Delicious

These were pretty tasty. I left out the crust because I wanted the filling only.  Just put the filling in sprayed muffin liners. I added extra vanilla too as a personal preference. They did puff up and then fell when I took them out of the oven, so they weren't very pretty. However they tasted good and they were just for at home use so I didn't really care. I guess if I were going to take them out to an event I'd put some cherry pie filling on top to cover up the indentation in the tops. Worth trying!!

These are great, perfect little cheesecakes that taste just like the big ones. I sized the recipe up to 12 servings to fill my 12 cup muffin tin. What I like about this recipe is that there was less worry about "is it done or not?" that I usually experience with a full-size cheesecake.

Great classic recipe you cant fail with this recipe. I put a homeomade strawberry topping I found on this site on top of the cheesecake and everyone loved it.

WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!!!
I was a little nervous trying out this recipe because I had never made baked cheesecake (always just the instant kind).  The ingredients are so simple and it takes no time at all to make this dessert up.  My bf and I ate all 6 of them for dessert tonight!! We have plans to make these again next week for our family Easter celebration!  You must try these!

Recipe is great! Made some changes... half regular cream cheese, half strawberry cream cheese.. I am sure you can use any of Philadelphia's cream cheese flavors to your liking. Also, I have used Oreo cookie crust instead, and they are to die for. 

Oreo cookie crust : 
8-10 cookies + 1 tbsp of melted butter
Crush cookies until crumbly for base  then follow the rest of the instructions  :-)

Doubled recipe. It needed more crust mix. That was an easy fix. I elliminated the lemon zest and juice and replaced the juice with water. Added tsp almond extract Along with suggested vanilla. Followed everything else exactly.  I used lucky leaf topping. Next time I'll use the caramel and fudge. Not a fan of the lucky leaf brand. Simple and taste great. Will make again and again. Kids loved it.

I used coconut oil instead of butter and a little extra lemon zest and the flavour was amazing!  I also made them in a mini muffin pan using parchment mini muffin cups and cooked them a little less.  My husband took them to work and the people were crazy for them.  I made 48 mini cheese cakes (a triple batch), and that didn't even to be enough.  I put a strawberry on top and made a strawberry puree, but they were also so delicious plan too!  This is a keeper!

Delicious. I used Oreo crumbs and butter instead of margarine and graham crackers. For the sauce I used frozen raspberries sugar and water and boiled it. I also used mini cupcake liners ( 24 muffin tin ) and filled them up all the way.

AMAZING! I used 3 eggs instead of 1, and it really brought out the flavours and made it the perfect texture! would recommend making that substitute!

Love love love this recipe. Based on reviews, I left out the lemon zest (and also because I didn't have any) and it came out of the oven absolutely delicious with just a hint of lemon.
This was a fairly simple and quick recipe that is amazingly delicious and some of the best cheesecake I've ever had. The only thing I would do different is make lots more.

awesome recipe! Instead of lemon juice and zest I put in a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Tastes just like New York cheesecake that way! Also, only baked for 20 minutes to avoid cracking. I quadrupled this recipe to make 2 dozen. The crust quadrupled is perfect, but the filling is way too much. So if you quadruple it, only triple the filling!

I made these with minor changes-- omitted the lemon juice and lemon zest,  and increased the vanilla to 1 TSP (personal preference).... these were delicious, and the crust was perfect... ****Tip: place cupcake plan on top of cookie sheet with water in it... this prevents crust from cracking**** Topping these with chocolate covered strawberries for an elegant Thanksgiving dessert...

I have never tried making cheesecake and this was the PERFECT recipe to begin with.  I did not use the zest and love the fact it didn't have near as much sugar as most.  I doubled the recipe and put the batter in a store bought graham cracker pie crust. I doubled the cook time then shut the oven off and left it another 20 minutes. It was perfect and no cracks! quick and easy

Umm, they looked like they turned out okay.  When I was making them I had a ton of the cream cheese, and actually to much.  I kept reading over the recipe to see where I went wrong and couldn't find anything.  A couple suggestions if you're making them, leave out the lemon zest, though the lemon juice is a good touch.  Also, with making a little more of the crust, you could probably easily make 8 of these with the standard recipe.  Otherwise, it's a great simple cheesecake that goes well with lots of different toppings.

Never gave any recipe 5 starts before. Love Cheesecake but much like everyone else who wants to spend 6 Hours making a whole big Cheesecake for just me? So I set out to find the best mini cheesecake recipe and I have 100% found it! First off I too went through dozens of other recipes only to come to this one because of the crust. I have nothing bad to say about the vanilla wafers because I have never tried them. To Graham Cracker Crust is 1 of the best things about cheesecake. As for the lemon zest and juice. I did not use it simply because I did not have it. I have seen that addition of zest on many cheesecake recipes along the way. There is a technical benefit but what that is exactly escapes me right now. I did exactly what the instruction said to and they were PERFECT! Look, Taste, Consistency everything could not have been better. Tip** After you spoon in the GC Crust take a metal or even plastic measuring cup (smallest you have 1/4 C. Maybe)and use that to press down. That will ensure an even crust every time. I have made it many times since that first time and have tried all kinds of toppings. Mostly the pie fillings i.e. Cherry, Blueberry or Strawberry. Anything you see on your favorite cheesecake you can put on these. Lastly Please do everyone a favor and use the foil liners. They not only look so nice they make for a much easier clean up. P.S. I had to double the recipe because I just couldn't see making only 6....

MY OH MY! ALL KINDS OF YUMMY GOODNESS IN THIS MINI CHEESECAKE RECIPE! So simple and tasty. I did follow the advice of one other reviewer who said she added a sour cream top to the cheesecakes for that added "over the top cheesecake flavor" we all crave and she was spot on! So glad I went that extra step because these are FABULOUS!! I love that they are portioned in the mini versions, that makes it so easy! Do try this recipe, you will not be disappointed! Thank you!

Excellent and easy!  Love the individual portion size of these and there's a nice hint of lemon, but nothing too overpowering.  I topped each one with some organic morello cherry jam and a fancy chocolate decoration for a great addition to my Christmas dessert plate!

This is delicious! Just like the cheesecakes in stores. In fact, I use the same recipe in a larger quantity for a full sized cheesecake. I don't add the lemon juice or zest, it's good without them.

I have made these several times doubling and tripling the recipe a few times.  So wonderful, I love them!  Easy and tasty, love taking them along to picnics.  I have left out the lemon a few times because I didn't have it and it they still tasted great.  I have only used the foil liners and had zero problems, plus they look nice.

I love this recipe. It was simple and delicious. I listened to some of the other reviews and excluded the lemon juice and lemon zest. Also, next time I will put a little more than 1 tablespoon of graham cracker on the bottom. As a topping I used Supreme Strawberry topping and it went great with the cheesecake, really complimented it :-)

I'd planned to make cupcakes to surprise a friend for her birthday only to discover her favorite birthday dessert was cheesecake.  Gross.  I don't care for cream cheese so I'd never made cheesecake.  I'd seen various mini cheesecake recipes floating around the RB and ended up choosing this one because she'd specified she loved a thick graham cracker crust.  I used the pre-smashed graham cracker crumbs and this was a breeze to make!  I doubled the recipe and ended up w/9 large cup cheesecakes.  I chose to leave the lemon/zest out and the birthday girl LOVED these!  I even ended up eating one and have to admit it wasn't as bad as I'd anticipated (and I can see how a cheesecake lover would really enjoy these!).  Mine did crack, but I covered w/"Supreme Strawberry Topping" so no one even noticed.  THANK YOU, BRAT87!

I made a batch and it was so delicious. I used low fat cream cheese and it didnt take out any of the good flavor of the cheesecake. I will try it again.

Great. Easy. My cheesecake stuck to the papers, but we just scraped it off and ate it. Made a blueberry sauce to eat with it. Quite good.

This was my first time ever making cheese cake and I thought the individual sizes were perfect for the girls I was making it for! I was really hoping they would turn out so I could give them as a little gift and they were perfect! I followed the recipe to a T and they turned out great! I got great reviews for them and the one I tasted was great! I am trying this recipe again but this time I would recommend more graham cracker crumbs to make a thicker crust, the crust was very thing and fragile so I also found adding a bit more melted butter worked well. Instead of cherry filling I made a raspberry sauce and drizzled some chocolate on top and they were absolutely delicious! Hope this helps!

I couldn't give it 5 stars because there were too many adjustments needed, especially the lemon juice and the lemon zest; definitely NOT needed.

So, so, so good! I didn't change much of anything. I doubled the recipe and used big muffin tins, and it worked out perfectly. I put chocolate chips between the crust and the cheesecake, and it was divine!!

These are were very easy to make. My mother has since suggested I just place graham cracker cookie in each tin. Since the crust came apart, I think I will try that next time.

OOOH these are the most cutest and delectable little desserts! I cannot wait to see the look on my families faces when they see and taste these tonight. I just happen to have all the ingredients on hand including fresh cherries and strawberries for a topping. It was so easy to make these mini cheesecakes. I followed recipe to a "T". I also used a mini muffin pan lined with paper liners. One package of cream cheese which I took out to room temp 30 minutes prior, filled 24 mini cheesecake cups. I pressed the bottom of the graham crackers with my thumb to ensure that they would set and bake. Everything else was easy as pie! I also used," Supreme Strawberry Topping", also from this website and made a cherry glaze as well. A little work for an awesome dessert!

I used chocolate graham cracker crumbs, left out the sugar for the crust. I also left out the lemon zest, since I was too lazy. Turned out perfect! I recommend atleast doubling the recipe, who wants only 6?

Wonderful!  We followed another viewer's suggestion by topping off with a sour cream, sugar, and vanilla cream and strawberry topping.  These were delish!  And I don't like cheesecake!  Thanks, everyone in my family loved them.

BEST EVER! Thanks for this recipe...there's only one problem. I have to make it often! lol For those experiencing the tops cracking, add a pan of water to the lower rack of the oven right before preheating, and leave in until baking is finished. :)

WOW!  These are amazing!  The only thing I changed was that i did not use the lemon zest, as I did not have any.  Once they were ready they flew off the table, everyone loved them!  I will make this again.

This recipe was amazing! and extremely easy to follow. The only fix possible would be to spray the inside of the muffin pan liners. That would have prevented the graham crackers from sticking. But I also discovered that it was easier to get the entire cupcake out the day after I made them.    This recipe worked perfectly for a friend get together and i will most definitely make it again and again.

Divine! I baked them in muffin liners and turned out great! The texture is wonderful and because they are not too sweet, these cheesecakes can take a lot of your favourite toppings :o). I omitted the lemon zest and added caramel toping, chocolate chips and pecans on half of them and raspberry jam on the other half. Can't wait to make them again and try all sorts of different toppings. Thank you for a great recipe!

Really, Really Good!!!  I have made these several times, once the exact recipe and they were really good. I used crushed oreos for the crust one time and did a fudge topping. And tonight I didn't have any lemons, I added a little more vanilla and they were still great. Amazing quick recipe.

Fun and easy but not as light as a regular cheesecake. The crust did not stay together -- it crumbled when I removed it from the muffin pan.

OH my goodness these are delicious! I doubled the recipe and put these in a tart pan instead, so it's like Mini MINI Cheesecakes. I didn't use the lemon, and I didn't put any kind of fruit or topping on them, and they were FANTASTIC. I also whipped the cream cheese before I added anything to it. You want to check on these in the oven often. I cooked them at 300 for only 15 minutes and they were fine, but every oven is different. I could eat these all day long.

These turned out great.  I actually used a mini cupcake pan instead so I ended up with a lot more desert :)  I topped mine with fresh sliced strawberries and it tasted fabulous.

These tasted really yummy, though I didn't have lemon on hand so I just omitted that. However, they were not very attractive, so I don't think I would make them for company.

These were great, just what I was looking for! I made a rasberry glaze for the top, added some fresh raspberries and sprinkled grated white chocolate just before serving and they turned out so well... I baked and served them in individual ramekins.. perfect! I think next time I'll make a bit more of the crust mixture as I thought the base was a bit thin.. Love the fact that you can make so many variations of these. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wow! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I doubled it for 12 mini cheesecakes. I've made this recipe twice and the second time I switched to the Neufchatel cheese. I don't know if that made the difference, since the first batch was very good, but the second batch was OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! I can't stop eating them and have since started making sure I have the ingredients on hand at all times for a quick cheesecake fix. These are creamy but not too dense. I keep frozen strawberries on hand and defrost them to put on top, but they arer still amazing without. The graham cracker crust is perfect, I wouldn't try any other crust. I'll stick with the Neufchatel cheese from now on. A keeper that will be made VERY often in my house.

Terrific!, the portions are the perfect size, not too much not too little!. I replaced the lemon juice and zest with Key Lime juice (as thats what I had on hand) and they turned out fine. Also my muffin pan was looking a little grubby so I put baking cases in the tin and they were perfect...no problems with sticking, makes for nice presentation too!. Will definately make again. Thanks Meagan!

I loved that this recipe was scaled down. I followed it exactly. My cupcakes did crack but as they cooled the crack diminished and was not even noticeable. My hubby loved them and I will make them again.

This is a superior recipe. I'm not a good baker whatsoever. I followed all the directions to the point and I did leave out the lemon zest. This came out spectacular and I am so surprised!! Bottom line leave out the lemon zest and make sure you cool down your cupcake. Put it in the refrigerator after it's done. Add a little almonds or graham cracker or fruit good nosh you will be one happy camper

I'm not a very good baker so the fact that I was able to make this successfully proves how easy it is to make! I followed the recipe as it is, except I doubled the amount so I can fill up a whole cupcake pan and I had to cook it longer in our old oven. If you love lemon, you will love this cheesecake as you can really taste it, otherwise, just omit the lemon zest and juice. This is a very good base recipe, I think next time I'll try it with crushed oreos instead. :)

Loved this recipe they came out great I made 12 mini cheesecakes using a muffin tin it was easy. I used mini cupcake foil liners so it wouldn't leave a mess in the muffin tin. I also didn't add the lemon zest and I added a little less of the lemon juice just because it does have a strong flavor. It came out great. I made two separate toppings strawberry and blueberry and drizzled some chocolate on top. They were a hit and we're gone immediately. Definitely making them again

These are great!  A quick, easy recipe with things you usually have on hand.  I brought them for a coworker's birthday today and have received many compliments and requests for your recipe (which I have happily provided!)  I used foil baking cups and they did cook a tad faster than the 25 min; I should have taken them out around 23 min because when I checked on them then they were perfect.  25 min caused them to crack.  They are still delicious and are not as rich as other cheesecakes.

Served it at a big family dinner and it was gone before I got to try it LOL. Everyone loved it, and it's definitely going to be my go to cheesecake recipe. I added a few drops of almond extract to the graham cracker crust, used a mix of butter and cream cheese instead of margarine, and added extra vanilla extract. Left out the lemon extract like the other reviews said to. I made the strawberry topping with just mashed up strawberries and some sugar (microwaved them in the same bowl so the sugar would dissolve). Sprinkled powdered sugar just for some added beauty. Super fast, easy, and delicious.

I just tried this today...must have done something wrong, but not sure what The cream cheese batter before baking was delicious, (had to taste it of course)  and when I just had one after baking, it was terrible....none of the great cheese cake taste at all, very blah!!!
 I followed the recipe to the letter....very disappointed!   glad we are not having company and it will just be me and husband eating them...

Ye gods, wonderful!  I combined two recipes - Mini Cheesecakes 1 and Mini Cheesecakes III using the graham crust recipe from III and the cream cheese recipe from I.  My only change was to a) cut recipe down by 3/4th (just hubby & I) and b) to add a dollop of sour cream to mix.  Baking time was perfect and I had no problems whatsoever with sticking.  Oh - and my cream cheese was pretty sweet so I cut sugar down by about half.  A 4th of the recipe using 4oz cream cheese gave me exactly 12 mini cherry cheesecakes.  Thank you so much! :)

I used Bailey's Irish Cream instead of lemon or vanilla but since I used a little extra, I put in some flour so they would set.  It worked well.  :)  They did crack very much but I don't care; I made a frosting for their tops.

It was OK.... I didn't add the lemon stuff, but It was ok. The cream cheese cracked in the given time, but it was fixable.

This is a great base recipe! I almost doubled the crumbs amount (I used home baked that I had on hand and wanted to use up) and omitted the lemon juice and zest. It's quick to put together and looks amazing with a strawberry jam topping. Made this 2x in two days and got rave reviews both times. Oh, and I had no problem getting them out of the paper cups - peeled off easily.

Simply loved this recipe. My family couldn't get enough. I went ahead and left out the lemon zest and they were delicious. Will definitely be making these again, very soon.

I absolutely love these delicious little cheese cakes. I've been making them for 2 years now & I always get a lot compliments on them. The only thing I omit is the lemon zest & lemon juice. Sometimes I add just a teaspoon of lemon juice. Note: These do get a little greasy on the bottoms and the butter in crust will run through a paper liner. Either double up the paper liner or use aluminum baking liner.

I had six pre-made, mini graham cracker crusts. Used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/8 tsp. lemon extract. Baked for 25 mins. Had just enough batter to fill all six. Good taste. So quick and easy, there is no need to ever buy.

They were perfect! I followed the instructions to a T except for the lemon zest which I just put a little of. My boyfriend was so shocked it turned out so good. I used silicon baking cups too and I was worried that they bake slower in it but I still baked them in 25 minutes, just like what the recipe called for and they were absolutely perfect, even without the topping! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness - what little gems these are! I love the fact that you can make 6 mini cheesecakes - just the right amount to not feel guilty about - because let me tell you, if I make an entire 9" or 10" cheesecake, it will be calling my name breakfast, lunch and dinner until gone! I can't wait to share this with my sister. She makes a cheesecake only once a year, for exactly the same reason I just mentioned. These are absolutely perfect. I had no problem with them sticking (I just sprayed my muffin pan generously with Wilton® Bake Easy). They were craked a bit when I took them out of the oven, but as they cooled, they shrunk back down and the cracks were barely noticeable. I topped ours with fresh berries and a blueberry sauce. Delicioius!

SOOOO EASY!!!  And we loved it.  As usual, I didn't have an ingredient.  I was missing the graham crackers, so I crushed up some MINT GIRL SCOUT COOKIES that I had in the freezer, and it worked.  Didn't have to add sugar, just crushed them and mixed them with the melted butter.  I will buy the crackers to have on hand though.  I still can't believe that something so simple came out so good.  I did read reviews first, and I think those that had problems with how they turned out, may have beat the mixture too long.  I know someone who makes lots of cheesecakes, and she says over beating causes air, which causes cracks, sinking, etc....THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

I made these for my daughter's baby shower.  I should have made more !!!  Everyone loved them. And they were very easy to make. I had never made any kind of cheesecake before. Now I will !!!! I followed the recipe, with the exception of using a water bath and letting the cakes set for 5-10 min more in the oven,after turning off the heat.  They were perfect.

These are delicious and very easy. Mine only needed to be baked about 15 minutes. I was using the foil cupcake liners and this might be why. I have made them a couple times now. My husband wouldn't mind if I omitted the lemon but I leave it in because I like it. The topping possibilities are endless! If you are looking for an easy dessert that will impress people, this is it.

Didn't have margarine so we used butter instead for the crust and it was still good.  We baked 24 at a time and it came out great!  We served it with the "Supreme Strawberry Topping" recipe from this site and fresh blueberries for 4th of July.

I doubled up the crust recipe, left the lemon zest out of the recipe and put them into a cupcake pan instead of a muffin pan.  Tastes pretty good and it was easy to make.

I made these cheesecakes in a medium 12-muffin tin but used vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers. The ingredients yielded 9 mini cakes that's just nice for additional topping without overflowing the liner. However I made a mistake of putting 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of teaspoons, and got myself some mini lemon cheesecakes! They actually do taste pretty awesome! To me, this is a good base for mini cheesecakes, and it is so versatile. Even with the mistake that I made, it is still very good. The texture is smooth too, though I think I might have beaten it a bit too long that it collapsed right after removing from the oven. Thank you BRAT87!

Simple, delicious... good. Mine made 7 cupcake sized cheesecakes that looked like it might "puff over" when it came out the oven, but it did deflate a bit once it cooled. loved the little sugar bursts you get in the crusts.

This recipe is my favorite! I've made it 3-4 times since I discovered it, and each time I made different fruit compotes for toppings! I've found the water bath is most important to prevent the cheesecake's from cracking, although, when covered by toppings, you could never tell it cracked! So thanks to the reviewers who suggested it! And thank you, Brat87, for sharing the recipe!

These cheesecakes came out exactly as expected. The lemon was barely detectable and as lemon typically does, it tempered the sweetness perfectly and enhanced the cheesecake flavor.  The bake time was spot on for a calibrated oven. Next time, I will add a bit of almond extract to compliment a cherry topping.

Great!  I used butter because I think margarine is awful, and a tablespoon worked nicely.  I put some cherry pie filling and a blueberry on top for the fourth of july!  Not the best cheesecake I've ever had (doesn't have the depth of taste of the best cheesecakes), but the graham cracker crust was delicious and the cheesecake was very solid.  I'll be making this simple dessert again, especially in this warm weather.

This makes some delicious cheesecake in the perfect portion size!!! I will reduce or maybe omit the lemon next time as it was a little overpowering for me, but everybody loved this dessert!

These were so delicious! I made them for my best friends' mom's birthday. My only real problem with these is that my whole family ate them the night before I was able to gift them. I omitted the lemon rind, and made a bit of strawberry sauce to dollop on top of each. The combination was ridiculously yummy. Next time, I'm going to make the crust a little thicker, and I'm going to try this recipe with the addition of oreos!

Absolutely amazing and SUPER easy to make. I made these as Christmas gifts for my co-workers and they were gone in a matter of 5 minutes... friends that don't really like cheesecake were loving it. I made the first batch to the t as the recipe calls and I got a little more creative with the second batch. I added white chocolate chips to the cheesecake mixture as well as chopped macadamia nuts. TO DIE FOR... thanks BRAT87 !!

This recipe is very tasty!  I doubled the recipe and used mini muffin tins for my 22 year old daughter's birthday, and all of her guests kept popping those bite sized cheesecakes till they disappeared.  The only change I made was to substitute the margarine for butter.  I baked them for 10 minutes and they were perfectly done with no cracks.  I poked sliced strawberries (standing up like little towers) on some and gently pressed fresh blueberries (so they wouldn't roll off the top) on others.  These mini cheesecakes are just the right size-- bite size.  They are very sweet, and need no topping.

I honestly don't know what happened. I just tried to make these little cheesecakes and came out not tasting much like cheesecake at all. The tecture wasn't like cheesecake and the stickiness on the top of each one wasn't very tastey. I did everything the same way this recipe says to, with the same ingredients, and this happens. I don't know, I'll leave them in the frig a bit longer to see if anything changes over time, but if not, I can't really say I'll be attempting these agains.

I love these! they are easy to make and delicious. One thing though is that i only needed to cook them for about 17 min, the ones I cooked longer were dense and not nearly as fluffy. Over all they were awesome! I will make these again!

So perfect!  I did the recipe exactly as written, except I used butter for the crust.  The only thing I did differently was to make them TRULY mini, meaning a mere inch in diameter.  I baked them in paper liners for 14 minutes and they are the perfect consistency.  By the way, I'm not a fan of cheesecake.

I didnt have lemon, so we used a little bit of orange zest.  These came out fantastic.  My friends who don't like cheesecake even liked them!  Only thing I would change: double the quantity for everything so you have more!

We increased the graham crust by half.  Would definitely decrease the lemon if we make them again as we felt the lemon flavor overpowered the other flavors.  I buttered my muffin cups generously and still had trouble getting them to come out cleanly even after chilling them for awhile.

I was looking for a recipe to use up 1/2 a bar of cream cheese and this was the perfect solution as I didnt have enough for an entire cheesecake.  I halved the recipe of course, and skipped on the lemon zest but still tasted great.  I used the muffin liners since I had those but next time I will spray those with non-stick spray to make it easier.  They did leave cute little ridges on the cheesecake, which was nice.  For a nice and quick topping I used strawberry preserves that I had on hand.  It worked nicely, I just wish I would have had fresh strawberries to top it with!  In my opinion, these cheesecakes require a topping because as is they're not sweet enough.  But that's just me :)  Either way, I know I will make these again!

The recipe is very easy. I had to reduce the amount of lemon juice and forget about the lemon zest since I really do not want a lemony cheesecake. They crack a little when overbaked so you should make sure that you watch them closely or you could also use a waterbath. loved them!

Perfect. This is great for someone who doesnt want to make a whole cake & is trying to watch their weight. This is a nice "cheat day" recipe.

Excellent!  And this yields the perfect amount, too.  I've always wanted to make cheesecake, but it's not like I have a big family and I knew if I made an entire one I'd probably be the one eating it.  ;-)  This is perfect and the consistency and flavor are fantastic!  I love the crumb crust.  Thanks a bunch for sharing this!

I don't eat cheesecake, nor does my boyfriend. I made a batch for my sister's birthday, as it is her favorite. 6 cupcakes was the perfect yield. Those that wanted some could have it, while I was able to serve a chocolate cake as the main attraction. She said they were amazing! I served them with a simple sauce made with frozen strawberries and cornstarch. Perfectly simple recipe - no need to alter a single thing. Will certainly make THIS recipe again if the occasion arises.

This recipe is unbelievably easy. I can't even tell you how many complicated cheesecakes I've made, and while all delicious, this one is by far the easiest, simplest, and tastes just as good, if not better!  I am thrilled with this recipe. thank you for sharing it

I love cheesecake! This recipe is so simple yet so tasty. The filling tastes just like the gourmet cheesecakes found at a dessert bakery. I loved them and plan on making them for my sister's birthday party topped with fresh berries!

ridiculously easy and tasty!  i used an oreo (just one flat side with the filling scraped off) for the crust because i had some left over from a project with the kiddos.  the lemon and chocolate combo worked really well!  maybe a whole oreo would be even better...

My mom has made cupcake cheesecakes before and I wanted to try it out, but don't have the recipe she uses. So I thought I'd try this out and sorry to say this one doesn't compare. I was disappointed, but they are OK.

I have been making these for years with a cookie in the bottom and the graham cracker crust is so much better.  We love cheesecake so these do not last long in my house.

These were very good. I followed the recipe for the cheesecake mix exactly although I did make more of the crust mixture. I baked these in individual ramekins placed in a water bath (to reduce cracking). Presentation was excellent and the flavor was out of this world. I served them with fresh strawberries that I'd sliced earlier, mixed with a tsp of sugar, and left at room temp for 1/2 hour so that they'd make their own syrup from the berry juices. These definitely impressed the in-laws!

Loved this, easy but tasty. Next time I would double the recipe for the crust though, it comes out very thin. Just a tup: If you aren't using liners you have to wait for the cheesecake to cool completely before removing it if you want it to stay in one piece. I was impatient and ate one straight out of the pan, haha :)

I use this recipe all the time when I am having a cheesecake craving, they are the best.  Quick, easy, and I always have the ingredients on hand.  I omitted the lemon zest. I also place the muffin pan in a large high sided pan with water in it as a water bath when I cook them.  The cheesecakes always come out tender and delisious

These were delicious and simple!  I used chopped ham, but I think sliced ham would work better.  Still turned out awesome!  The drizzle on top of the sandwiches made the recipe.  Took this to a Christmas party and everyone asked me for the recipe!

These very good. I had apple pie filling left over so i added cinnamon to the crust and topped with the left over apple pie filling, nice change from cherry topping.

I don't even like cheesecake - never made a cheesecake!  These are wonderful!  I doubled the recipe, made 6 then added melted semi-sweet chocolate chips to the rest of the batter.  Topped with the strawberry supreme.  So good!  Got rave reviews!

for the time being, i can only rate these a four.  i may have cooked them too long, as they weren't as creamy as i like.  i also forgot to bake off the crust, so i had a little bit of trouble taking them out of the pan, but it wasn't too bad.  i will try this again, but cook for a shorter amount of time.  i think the temp is off a bit on my oven.

These are great.  I made mini two bite size.  I also put some chocolate chips in a few of them and a raspberry to see how they would turn out and they are great. They are going to be on the christmas baking tray.

This is such an easy recipe. Made and tasted cheesecake for the first time!
I did not add the lemon zest since I am not very fond of lemons. I also added some vanilla sugar.

This is a great recipe! Very easy, one bowl prep and QUICK!  Instead of using Graham crust (or wafers) I added chocolate chips to the bottom of the liner.  These melted into a great choclate crust.  NOTE: With Chocolate crust, cakes must be served chilled.

These cheesecakes were great, & perfect for portion control as others have mentioned. I found them a little too lemony for my taste, so I would probably leave that out next time.

I made this recipe for a party I had a couple of months ago.  I 'shrunk' my cheesecakes and made them in a 12 muffin pan instead of 6.  I didn't put any toppings on them, but placed them next to some chocolate fondue and fruit that I had also made for the pary.  A few drinks later, people were putting whatever they wanted on top of their mini cheesecakes.  It was very fun!  I recommend the chocolate and raspberry combo, personally!

Oh my gosh!!! So easy to make and so delicious too. This is great because the dessert is already portioned out and ready to serve. You don't have to worry about storing and serving a whole cheese cake. I will definitely make this again. It was the perfect amount for our family of three.

This recipe is a great alternative to spending all day making a regular cheesecake.  I make these mini cheesecakes for birthday parties for people who aren't fond of cake.  Relatives who don't usually like cheesecake love these little cheesecakes!

Wow! These were yummy to the max.  I added more graham cracker because we are both crust lovers :)  They came out perfectly with a slightly concave center perfect for filling with the strawberry sauce found on this site. I used the back of my measuring spoon to compact the graham cracker.  Our crust came out thick but crispy.  Next time, even for the 2 of us, I will double the recipe because they taste so good the next day.

Yep. These were amazing.  I made like 3 batches for a girl's night we were having and they were gone SO fast. I didn't have any lemon zest, but they turned out perfect without it. I'm also thinkin I can experiment with adding peanut butter, and using a chocolate sauce topping.

Only used the crust recipe, and used another cheesecake recipe. Pretty good, tiny bit greasy though after I pressed it down. (I used the crust for 6 servings, even though I only made 4, otherwise it would have been too thin...) Following the original recipe, I think 2 teaspoons of margarine will do. Note: you should only prebake a crust if you're making a no bake cheesecake, otherwise, fill it with the cheese mixture and then bake. Hope this helps.

Delicious, I have never made cheese cake before and this recipe was so simple I could not belive I was done in minutes. I did add more graham crumbs and butter for thicker crust.

I used gluten-free rice cookies for the base and they taste excellent. I also left the cheesecakes plain because I'm boring. Definately one of the best cheesecake recipes I've used.

these are delicious and very easy to make!  i doubled the recipe and had enough cream cheese mix for 18 cupcakes but only enough crust mix for 12 so i had to make a little more of that.  i used paper liners for the muffin pan and it makes it really easy to eat the cakes (since my crust was a little crumbly).  i topped them with some cherry pie filling and they're scrumdiddilyumptious!

these were okay. they didn't really turn out for me and i don't really know why. it was VERY over baked, and baking the crust beforehand made it not stick to the filling, so i had 2 seperate bits, not to mention that was a bit burnt too. it was a bit disappointing.

I followed this as a guideline, and it came out great. Changes: tripled the recipe, left out all lemon, I made the "crusts" out of CHOCOLATE graham crackers and finely chopped sweetened pecans. I also stirred in chopped dark and semi sweet chocolate and I used muffin cups... They were AMAZING... especially right out of the oven, the chocolate just melted... Would definately make again. 4 stars for the changes I made. Thanks!

This is the first time I've made cheesecake and let me say this came out perfect! I followed the recipe for the filling exactly but altered the crust a little since I couldn't get plain grahams (only cinnamon and fudge covered.) I used plain digestive biscuits instead and it came out tasting exactly like a graham crust. I also made these into 12 mini cheesecakes in a mini-muffin pan. They were the perfect bite sized treats. I made 6 of them with a plain crust and added melted choc chips to the other 6 crusts. They both taste wonderful. I think I'll make them all chocolate next time though. I drizzled a bit of toffee sauce (recipe on this site) on the plain crusted ones and they were divine. The ones with the choc crust was perfect as it was. I'll definitely make these again!

Perfect for 4 people.  I used Nilla wafers (crushed) instead of graham cracker crumbs and they came out great.  Better than Cheesecake bought at the bakery and so easy to make.

Thank you so much for this easy to follow recipe. I had never made a baked cheesecake before so I was a little aprehensive at first- but it turned out lovely.

One thing I changed- instead of the graham cracker crumbs I used the crumbs of a batch of gluten free bisuits I made earlier in the week. The crust turned out fine and it is great to have such a tasty gluten free dessert! I would definitely recommend this recipe to those on a Gfree diet, as it was very easy to covert and very yummy.

Wonderful recipe!  I add twice as much zest for a great lemony flavor, and I swap out Neufchatel for cream cheese for less calories. I also add a big pan of water on the bottom rack for added humidity in the oven to avoid cracks in the cake. Best recipe I've used for cheesecake - hands down!

I replace Oreo chocolate  cookie crumbs instead of Graham crackers. 
It taste much better when I put less sugar than original recipe. 
I also use the baking cups for handling & convenience.

Liked this! I didn’t add any lemon zest, and it wasn’t too lemony. We did have a problem with it puffing up and then collapsing in, though it’s likely that’s my inexperience rather than the recipe. Made these in cupcake pans, the recipe made pretty exactly 8. We added strawberry and chocolate to the top, which improved it. Overall, delicious, and not as heavy as other chresecakes!

I love these. My niece also gets excited about them every time I make them. This is my go to recipe for potlucks, and recently even made them for a bake sale. The only change I make is that I leave out the lemon zest, I am afraid they will taste too much like lemon otherwise. I've never tried them with the zest, but I like it fine without so I just don't bother. When I bake them I also place the cupcake pan in a cookie sheet and add water (about 1-2 inches) - it helps prevent cracking. Just be careful with  the hot water when taking out the pan (you can also just use a deeper pan). I also usually chop up some strawberries, sprinkle a bit of sugar on them, stir to coat, let them sit for about 10-15 minutes, and use the strawberries to top of the cupcakes. Delish!

Really great recipe!! I even ended up doubling the batch and making it into a whole cheesecake. (Make the crust in a springform pan the same, and bake batter for 25-30 minutes.)

These are an instant hit!  I did make changes. I used regular cupcake liners instead of mini.  I  sparyed bottom of liner with butter spray and then placed one vanilla lemon wafer with a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla poured over it.  I poured the filling over the wafer and baked about 17-20 minutes.  Super easy! I bring these to my school pot luck every year and they go very quickly.

I use Vanilla Wafers in the bottom instead of the graham cracker crumbs. Easier, tidier and just as yummy. When the liner is taken off they are easier to eat.

I don't understand why the video was a much different recipe than the actual recipe under the video.  This is confusing me to no end.   At first, one of the ingredients it said to put in was pork shoulder,  and the last ingredient was chicken broth.  Can someone explain this to me?  And also,  Why use the tinfoil?  you can bake it without the paper cups as long as you grease the pan.

It was so tasty!! I trippled the recipe because the recipe only makes 6, so I ended up making 18.  They were super lemony which was great because i love lemon, and the recipe didn't give the instructons for making the blueberry mint topping so I just did 1 cup fresh blueberries and 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice and it turned out really good. And we put the mint leafs on top too. Very tasty!!! I will make it again!

The bottom was very crumbly, and they didn't come out of the pan well, so muffin cups would be needed.  I followed other reviews and didn't add the lemon.  Before baking, I tried the batter, and was very excited, as it tasted very good.  I chilled them, and ate them with my boyfriend for dessert.  It no longer tasted good at all! I almost couldn't eat it...was not impressed

Made it with lemon zest and juice. No topping, since I made it for a friend in the hospital who could only eat thick creamy items. Very tasty.

The crust was a little disappointing and would have added more sugar and butter...it fell apart too easily. Guests loved it.

This was easy and great tasting even for a rookie. I used a 6 inch springform pan instead of muffin tin. I topped it off with a blueberry coulis. I will definitely make it again....

Super easy recipe.  I doubled it and made 12 mini cupcakes. I only omitted the lemon zest.  I sliced up fresh cherries and made a cherry sauce for the top. Delish!

Very delicious! I made it for fun and it was a huge hit with my family. This is the perfect amount of lemon. I suggest eating it with some jam on top, (raspberry is my favorite).

This was an unmitigated disaster. 

The filling was yummy (I changed the flavoring), but...I had to make a second batch of crust mixture to cover the bottom of each cup even very thinly, and every last smidgen of the filling filled only 1/4 of each cup. When I  checked the cook at 15 minutes, the cheesecakes were already burnt and starting to smoke.

Is it possible that the author meant for us to fill only 6 cups  of a regular-size, 12-cup tin? I have tins for mini, maxi, and regular-size muffins; the only 6-cup tin is the maxi size, so that's what I used...

Regardless, I won't be making this again. My regular cake-size cheesecakes are loved by all, so that's what I'll stick to from now on.

These are delicious. I added a TBSP of strawberry jam to the center of each and swirled the jam into the cheesecake. They turned out great. Only thing is, they were not cooked at 25 minutes and I left them in for another 10 minutes and still not done and then for an additional 10 minutes and they were golden on top. I think the extra cook time was due to the jam and I think if I hadn't opened the oven 2 times to check them it wouldn't have taken as long either. I am going to try for 35 minutes next time I make them without opening the oven at 25 minutes to see if that works.

I used foil cupcake liners and instead of a graham cracker crumb crust, placed one vanilla wafer in the bottom before the cheesecake filling.  My mom made them like that when we were kids and it makes them really easy.

Very good mini cheesecake!   My family really enjoyed this.  I made my own tweaks.  I replaced the sugar with Swerve (erythritol) and used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.   Served them upside down with the crust on top. Tasted even better when left in the fridge overnight.  Had the perfect texture then.

This recipe was so simple and so delicious! Baking the crust before adding the mixture really adds the perfect texture! Also, I added the lemon juice but skipped the zest so that the taste wasn't so singular. I made several batches and had fun with the toppings as well. I tried apple pie filling topped with chopped pecans and the usual cherry pie filling. I even added some chocolate syrup to one of the batches and topping it off with raspberry filling. This was a hit after Christmas dinner!

These were OK. I guess they hit the spot if you're craving cheesecake but don't actually want to make one. They tasted better the next day, cold from the refrigerator. I might make them again if I'm feeling particularly lazy, but not because of flavor.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The second time, I omitted the lemon, doubled the vanilla, and added two tablespoons of sour cream and a teaspoon of flour (per another reviewer's suggestion).  Every bit as yummy and perfect as the original recipe.  So much quicker and easier than a standard NY style cheesecake.  Thanks!

This is the best cheesecake recipe, easy, delicious, made it for an after school treat for my 15 year old grandson, and the next night made it again...its a fast recipe, and it will be gobbled up quickly, so double the recipe.

I used this recipe with a mini muffin pan.  I tripled the mix for the crust and piped the cheesecake filling into 24 mini muffins.  I baked the crust for 5 min like the recipe calls for and the cheesecakes for 20 min instead of 25.  I wanted to make a 2-bite sized cheesecake and it worked out very well.  Only problem is, I have to be careful not to eat 5 or 6 of them at a time.  Yummy;)

It was really good. Different from the recipe I normally use. I love the citrus flavor from the lemon juice. This will be my new go to recipe for cheesecake.

These were AMAZING. Loved them!!! The only change I made was I didn't add the lemon juice or zest. These were easy to make and came out perfect. I see a lot of others saying what liners they used, so Iwill say that I used silicone liners, and the bake time was the same, no cracking. They were perfect!

I've never made cheese cake before but after reviewing a bunch of recipes, this one had similar ratios to many others... so I tried it. 

I made 2 1/2 dozen mini ones in a mini muffin pan with paper liners. Since I was looking for a Fall flavor, I opted to use a drizzle of maple syrup rather then the lemon and I topped them with a salted caramel apple compote I whipped up... yummy.

I baked them for 15mins in a regular oven (not convection) with a water bath (I saw others use it from other recipes) They turned out perfect! No cracking, they set well- I will make them again.

I loved this recipe! It was easy to follow. I added a puréed strawberry filling that really helped with lemon taste that other reviews mentioned.

These small cheesecakes are really good and easy to make. They are the perfect size for dessert or a quick snack.  I used a silicone cupcake pan and put a pan of water underneath. No cracking, but I don't think we would care anyway. I always make a double batch, they are gone in no time.

I made a double batch and my daughter is begging for more.  I didn't have a fresh lemon in the house so I used bottled lemon juice and skipped the zest.  I also added 1/4 cup of sour cream because I gives it a very creamy texture.  I will be making these over and over

I was always afraid to mess up a full cheesecake, so I always bought Royale No Bake (now discontinued). The Jello is not as good and has become too expensive, so I was really happy with the results of these. Did I change anything? Just a squeeze of lemon seemed enough for my tastes and I doubled the crust... never too much graham cracker crust ;)

This recipe is delicious! The only changes I made were: 
1.) adding a tablespoon more butter  to the crust and NOT baking it prior to adding the filling 
2.) I didn't use lemon zest & did use fresh squeezed lemon juice  
3.) I used a large ice cream scooper to fill each cupcake liner almost to the top 
4.) They needed to bake for 19 minutes  &  came out perfectly - no cracks & incredibly moist! 
5.) I added a dollop of cherry pie filling to the center of each.   (Even with filling each so full, after  baking, there was a slight indentation  on top to hold it perfectly.) 
6.) I made two quadruple recipes (8 x's the recipe)  and it made 7 dozen

Absolutely delicious. The only problem I had was the crust didn't bind well. I think it needed a little more butter. The lemon flavor really stands out and gives it a different taste. We personally liked the lemony taste. The size is perfect for dessert and I topped it off with a strawberry. We all loved it!!!

I really liked it. I didn't chill it long enough, but I still thought it was very good. It was easy to make and looked kinda elegant once the toppings were on. I didn't know that they would indent so much, but my mom said that's how it's suppose to be. Once the toppings were on, it was really pretty! I did cherries on top and really awesome lemon curd on the other!!

I make these as mini cheesecakes, same recipe except I don't use the lemon or lemon zest, just a little bit more vanilla.  Make sure you do a bain marie for this and then there is no cracking of the cheesecakes.  Drizzle some melted chocolate and yum!

I've made it three times already, my husband loved it!  And, about to make it again. I doubled the crumbs and added extra margarine, it tasted so good, and also omitted the lemon zest.  Thank you for this delicious recipe.

I substituted Better Than Cream Cheese for cream cheese because of a dairy allergy. This is the best dairy free cheesecake recipe I have had after trying several different recipes.

I made this recipe as is for my husband, and made another batch for myself because I am on restricted diet. I used reduced Fat Graham crackers, and Smart Balance Margarine with Flaxseed.(light) Stevia Granular Sweetener and Fat Free Cream Cheese. I made a Raspberry Sauce with Raspberry Jam & Lemon Juice & Fresh Raspberry's added at end. Very very good! Both ways.  Very Easy Recipe Also.  Thankyou

I followed the recipe as directed , except for the lemon zest. I added half the lemon zest then stated. I did this because reading other reviews & knowing i wanted to add  1/3 cup coconut and semi sweet chocolate chips. I didn't want an overpowering citrus element. They came out great! The cheesecakes did crack, but maybe b/cI didn't place a pan of water in the oven (which I normally do). I let them refrigerate overnight. When I removed them from the muffin tin, they came out in tact (crust didn't fall apart). My boyfriend loves them and you can add whatever you want in it or on top. Will do this recipe again.

I used a mini muffin pan and topped each one with a strawberry slice and drizzled chocolate.  I cut up a candy bar and sprinkled the pieces on top of others for variety. I can't wait to make these again. They're perfect!

Quadrupled the recipe and made over 24 cheesecakes for a family gathering.  Used low fat cream cheese and used a nilla waffer on the bottom instead of the graham crust. These were amazing!  The lemon flavor was just perfect. Everyone enjoyed. Great Easter-y spring time dessert. Thanks!

I have made this several times before. For what it is, it's great. I can make it quickly when I want cheesecake NOW. It's not the same as a classic, full sized cheesecake with all the baking, cooling, and waiting, but it's still very good.

I quadrupled this recipe for a birthday party, it made about 22. I left out the lemon, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I did some with a raspberry sauce, some with a blueberry sauce, and some plain. They looked really beautiful all together and the taste was SO yummy for such a simple recipe. Even a novice baker could handle this recipe.

This was pretty good. It satisfied my craving for cheesecake. Very simple to make. I will make this again for sure. But it's not the absolute best cheesecake I've ever eaten. Although it is better than store bought.

Very good! I made a strawberry glaze to use as a topping.  The very prominant lemon flavor did offset the topping a little bit but next tiime I will cut out some of the juice.

I created an account JUST to review this. Un-BE-lievable mini cheesecake. I doubled the recipe, didn't add the lemon zest (I don't like lemony cheese cake) and made larger, mini cheesecakes, in the large cupcake tin. They are SO good. So rich and decadent. Just amazing. I made a simple mixed berry reduction to go on top.. fantastic.

Perfect little summery cupcakes. I use a Nilla wafer rather than fussing with graham cracker crust.  Delicious!

These are great! Easy to make with many variations suggested by other reviewers. I put a bit of cinnamon in the crust mixture. Baking time can be a little tricky because it depends on the size and depth of the muffins.

AMAZING!  I opted out of the lemon juice/zest and instead put in melted white chocolate chips and seedless raspberry jam.  Then I put fresh raspberries on top and melted white chocolate on top...DELISH!  Everyone who has tried one has taken another..and another..and another!

this is pretty darn good. for my first try i used the 1/3 reduced fat spreadable cream cheese even though the cheesecake tips said to use the regular cream cheese blocks. my family and friends said it was great and it had the real cheesecake flavor :) thank you!

I loved the idea of individual servings like this but I wanted to lower the calories so I made some changes.  I doubled the crust. I used low fat honey graham crackers (4 sheets that I smashed in a plastic bag, made 2/3 cup) plus an extra TBSP of margarine.  Instead of sugar I used sugar substitute.  I also used egg substitute in place of the egg, and fat free cream cheese.  I greased five 1-cup ramekins, baked the crust for 5 minutes then filled them with the cream cheese mixture and baked for 25 more minutes in a water bath.  With the changes the total calorie count was 119, and the portion size was perfect.   I rated it 5 stars but I have not tasted it yet (wishful thinking I guess) because its cooling but as soon as I do I will post how it turned out!   *******UPDATE*****Ok so this tastes good but it is NOT the real thing :)  I topped it with a strawberry sauce to make it even yummier!

Amazingly simple and absolutely delicious. Used Oreo cookies instead of graham crackers, and it was still as lovely. I really wasn't sure if my first time making cheesecake would be successful, but it was! I'll definitely make this again.

These were fantastic!  The recipe size is perfect for making a treat without ending up with a lot of leftovers.  I did double the amount of crust, but that is personal taste because I enjoy the crust. :)

The only change I made is to substitute the lemon juice/zest and vanilla for fiori di sicilia, because I'd been dying to try it out on something. I put mine in greased silicone muffin cups and had no problem popping them out when they were cool. Very easy and delish, will make again!

This is a good cheesecake, but not my favourite one.  My fiance loved them though!  I like a raspberry or blueberry sauce to switch things up a bit.  Thanks for adding another great recipe to my recipe box, BRAT87!

Great recipe! I actually used it because I bought a 6" springform pan at a kitchen store and then couldn't find a recipe with the right proportions for it and this worked perfectly. My husband and I were able to have dessert for 3 nights but then didn't have 3/4 of a cheesecake looming in our fridge for the next 2 weeks. Perfect for the dieter that still want's a "little something" for a treat!

These cheesecakes were SOOO good. I know you're not supposed to use whipped cream cheese, but i had leftovers, and they were easier to mix.  They came out perfectly.  I also added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice, because i'm a cinnamon lover.  I will definitely make these again.

Lovely! Mine cracked a little on top while cooking, but this only affected how pretty they looked. I also found them a bit hard to turn out - next time I might make them in little ramekin cups rather than a muffin tin. I might also make a tad more crust than recommended - I found I didn't quite have enough. Easy to remedy, though! The flavour was great, though - quite lemony, which surprised me (but it was a pleasant surprise). Tasted almost like a delicious lemon tart, very nice. Excellent serving size for one, also. Very pleased, and will definitely make again!

Yummy! This was so easy and so wonderful. I took a tip from another user and served crust-side up, drizzled with strawberry topping. It was little personalized slice of heaven! Thanks so much!

Add a blackberry glaze (with whole berries) on top for extra flavor and "wow" factor.  Tasty little desserts!

I am baking these as we type (lol) & I didn't have enough filling to fill a 6 c. muffin tin 3/4 of the way. I got them to barely half way. Hopefully I ma using the right tin. I have a 12 c. cupcake tin but I wanted to follow the recipe to a 'T' on my first go 'round. UPDATE: I let them cool in the oven until almost cool, put them in the fridge & viola! Flat cheesecakes w too crumbly crust! lol I had NO cracks & the taste was GREAT! but I think I used the wrong tin. I may have used a jumbo 6c. miffin tin. Maybe next time I'll double the recipe for my 12 c. tin & ad a bit more butter to my crust. Other then my own tin mishap; great recipe & great taste!!! Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe!  Very easy and fun to make.  I love the size - they're big enough to satisfy a cheesecake craving, but it doesn't put you over the edge.  I've made these at least 3 times in the last 2 months and everyone loves them :).

Stellar! I used lime since we didn't have a lemon and a little extra crumb crust since I'm a graham cracker crumb fiend and these filled the craving completely! I oiled the pan with a little peanut oil and they came out readily after sticking them in the freezer to cool off for a bit.

Remarkable!! I can't stand when people use Nila wafers as a shortcut, so I knew this was the recipe for me.  It's  also a wonderful portion since it's only my husband and I. I doubled the lemon juice and zest (Personal preference only-I love lemon) but otherwise followed this exactly!  I also topped them with a mixture of sour cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.  Heaven!

This recipe makes very delicious mini treats that are great for everyone. My mother has always found other cheesecakes that i made too strong or creamy but she absolutely loved this one! (Chinese are not particularly crazy for cheese) These little 2-bite size mini cheesecakes are just perfect for dessert after supper, afternoon snack or giving away.
However i did not use lemon zest but simply added an extra table spoon of lemon juice, and a bit extra sugar which gives the cheesecakes a light sour-sweet taste.
I am definitely making these wonderful treats again.

Easy to make. I have food allergies, so I used a GF graham crumb crust, and used goat chevre instead of regular cream cheese. This didn't work as well, I think. They were dry and crumbly, so next time I'll add more moistness somehow. The taste was alright, though, and I'm sure if I could have made it as posted, it would've been great. I'll give it 4 stars, but I think my attempt was only 3 stars.

My crust stuck to the papers a little, but I think I added too much butter.  I doubled the amount of lemon in this recipe to make lemon cheesecakes and they were a complete hit with my friends.  I took them to share after hockey practice and passed them out in the locker room while we were changing out of our uniforms.  Perfect size and hit the spot.

HOLY MOLY!!!!!  I can't bake yet I managed to whip these babies up.  Made them for my sweetie for Valentine's Day and I couldn't help but to dig into one (it didn't make it out looking so pretty so I figured...why not?) and it was heavenly!!!!!!  I am going back to make another batch because I know he's going to love them come tomorrow.  Perfect amount of lemony goodness.  I'll plan to serve them with chocolate dipped strawberries.  Thanks so much for this find!!

This is a great recipe for those who want something sweet to nibble and not go overboard on. Its great for parties as well as its bite size. I used oatmeal cookies as the base instead of the graham biscuits and it still turned out delicious! After baking, I added blueberry glaze on top and it turned out perfectly! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Absolutely a wonderful recipe!  It's just two of us, so when I make a whole cheesecake, we end up eating it, which isn't good for either of our waistlines!  These were just enough to fill that craving, but not too much.  They freeze well.  My husband's favorite variation was to chop up a snickers bar and crumble it into the filling.  Mmm....

I'm not the biggest fan of cheesecake, but loved these delicious little bits and my boyfriend also devoured them. I used crumbled vanilla wafers as the crust instead of the graham cracker mixture - taken from a similar recipe. The lemon zest is what makes this dessert. I topped the cakes with balsamic-sauteed strawberries. Perfect. Thanks for the recipe! It's easy to make and great for when you want a small batch.

I liked these, but i feel like the cheesecake topping had no flavor in it, so i think if i ever made them again i would use more vanilla. I stuck them in the freezer after they came out of the over for a quick cool down.

Great way to make a quick dessert.  We've had these several times and love the lemon flavor.  I usually just top them with some fresh berries (whatever I have on hand).  They are gone even quicker than it is to make them.

This recipe was fantastic, I made these for work, and everyone was amazed at how good they were.  I added crushed walnuts and some cinnamon to the crust, and I have to say I was really tempted to eat the batch myself they were so good.  Many thanks for the recipe, it's my new favourite!

I cannot say enough great things about this recipe... SO SO SOOOOOO delicious!!
I have made this MANY times. EVERYONE LOVES these cheesecake cupcakes. This is the only cheescake recipe i will make now. I do ommit the lemon zest so it wont be so lemony but other than that I follow tthe recipe exactly with AMAZING results. If anyone has a low rate for this one.. you must try it again cause this is a no fail, always a hit recipe!

These were fabulous!  Ive never attempted a Cheesecake before so I thought Id try small and these were so easy!  I love the graham cracker crust!!  All I did differently was left out the lemon, I'll probably add chocolate to the top next time or strawberries!  Great recipe!

These are awesome!  When I pulled them out of the oven I noticed that some of the cakes had cracked slightly.  I waited at least an hour until they cooled entirely before removing them.  When I went to take them out of the pan, I noticed that the cracks had fused together when they cooled.  This recipe is flawless and the presentation is amazing!

so easy, so delicious! Next time i would line the muffin tin with paper cups because the crust came off of some of the cakes.  This is an easy fix for a cheescake lover like myself!

These were a nice addition to the desserts I served on Chrismas Eve.  I baked them in muffin tins in foil baking cups.  To dress them up a little for Christmas, I placed some fresh blueberries and raspberries(about 1-1/2 cups total) in a saucepan and added 1/2 cup water, 1 cup sugar, and 2 Tbsp. cornstarch.  I let this cook until it was a nice, thick consistency and then I let it cool.  I topped each little cheesecake with some of this topping and then refrigerated them.  They were so pretty and very tasty.

Made these today for Holiday treats at work. I added 1/2 cups of pecans to the crust. I also mixed up 1/2 pint of sour cream and 1/4 cup of sugar and added to the top after they had cooked for 25 minutes. After I added a thin layer of the sour cream/sugar I baked for another 5 minutes. My husband had to try one and loved it. He made me make another batch for his work

by mistake used 6 muffin tin, so I could only fill cheesecake mix about 1/4 up. I cooked for 20 minutes instead. They came out like a beautiful flat french pastry. I topped with whole strawberry. Yum
