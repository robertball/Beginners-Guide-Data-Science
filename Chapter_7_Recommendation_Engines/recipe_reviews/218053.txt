This was better than I was expecting! We didn't have broccoli rabe at our store, so I used baby broccoli instead - not sure how much that affected the flavor of the dish (which was really good!!) or the veggie-to-pasta ratio. I will probably increase the amount of pasta when I make it again, but overall it is a very good dish with great flavor that goes well with some warm, crusty bread for sopping up the juice - YUM!!

One word...A-freakin-MAZING!!! This dish is So easy once you get the rabe blanched & really there's nothing to that! Made as a main dish we Never even missed meat at this meal but I'm sure it would "go" well with fish or pork as well. The wine added beautiful depth to the dish along with grated Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan. I am infamous for doctoring recipes but truthfully there was little that needed changing here! Honestly I can't wait to make this again to share with dinner guests! Thanks so much sophie - you Rock!

LOOOOOOOOOVE THIS RECIPE! And everyone in my family does too even the meat-eaters. My grocery store never seems to have broccoli rabe so I use broccolini instead and it's delicious as well. I definitely recommend this recipe!

I have made this recipe three times already. I only had vermouth but it was still good. The last time I made it I put in some cooked Italian sausage so it was complete.

Very good recipe! It makes a lot so make sure you use big pans especially when combining it all together (I used the same pot I made my pasta in). All in all pretty great recipe with a great start for any additions you want (sausage etc).

I loved this!! This was our first time having rapini. we are not a vegetarian family so I added Italian sausage and used home made pasta. oh and I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used home canned crushed tomatoes. But otherwise I followed the recipe and it was great! My husband said it was even better the next day. This will be going into regular rotation.

This is a tasty and simple dish. I have replaced the green vegetable with what is in season. I used asparagus in the spring and zucchini in summer. Both turned out great.

I used broccoli instead of broccoli rabe and put a little dried rosemary into the spice mix instead of the fresh. I LOVED it. My family liked it but didn't love it as much as I did.

Pretty good recipe! It was my first time trying Rapini and we'd make this recipe again. Made recipe almost exactly as written, but used a 12oz box of gluten free penne. Next time I might toss in a can of drained cannellini beans.

Easy to make, tasty, and healthy! I added some chickpeas for protein, which made it more well rounded. Will definitely make this again.
