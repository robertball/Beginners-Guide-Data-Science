For the marinade, I used a whole head of garlic, oil, apple cider vinegar, an egg, salt, pepper, Thai green curry paste, and capers.  Blend.  Spatchcocked the Cornish hen. Placed in a zip lock with the marinade and left it in the fridge for 1.5 to 2 hours.  Then cook as Chef John indicated.  Just a twist to the marinade.

I don’t very often review recipes unless they are out of this world amazing. THIS WAS!  I didn’t take the seeds out of the peppers and it was awesome otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Gave it just a tiny bit of heat. SUPER juicy.

I made this  with chicken drumsticks instead of cornish hens. They came out fantastic. I was a little leery about how spicy they would be but maybe I was lucky with the peppers. They had a wonderful fresh jalapeno taste but  not hot at all. They were super tasty, chicken was moist, skin crispy. Don't forget to dust very lightly with salt (I used sea salt) before taking them off the grill. It added another dimension to the taste. Thank you Chef John for yet another great recipe! As the other reviewer, I will keep some seeds the next time for additional heat.

Fantastic! So simple yet so good. The jalapeño was amazing.
