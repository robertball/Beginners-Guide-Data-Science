A very healthy low fat side dish that's perfect for the grill! I add a little italian seasoning leave out the olive oil and just add some parmesan cheese right before serving.

Zucchini cooked in olive oil with tomatoes, onions and garlic is something very familiar to me -  I grew up with it and make it often. This was the first time I had Hubs "take it out to the grill" and, while there certainly was "no mess," I found I much prefer both the taste and texture of the vegetables when I good them as I usually do, in a skillet on the stove.  Cooked this way they took on some of the charcoal flavor which I didn't like.  And for reasons I can't explain,  the vegetables just didn't have the complexity of flavor as when I cook them on the stove - perhaps it was because these were more or less steamed.  It was nice to take the mess out of the kitchen so to speak, but I think I'd rather have an extra pan to wash.

I decided to do this on the stove-top as a saute. I used 1 zucchini, 1 yellow squash, 2 tomatoes, half each of a red & yellow onion, 6+ cloves of garlic and 1 fennel bulb. I seasoned with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. Omitted the fresh parsley. Lots of 'juice', so I thickened it a bit with cornstarch and served it over 'Triple-Grain Pilaf' from AR alongside 'Slayer's Sweet, Tangy and Spicy Kabobs" which is also from AR.

My Dad made this since I was a child and cooked over an open fire, but being more civilized, I use charcoal..anyway, he used potatoes and onions with butter sal and pepper..cook the same way. Always a hit at family gatherings and even today I make this for my family.

I made this using butternut squash and it was a breeze. No fuss no muss. I did add more seasonings and the whole family went back for seconds. Thank you!

Very good, added asparagus to it while also sprinkling some garlic powder and onion salt on it.  Turned out real good.

I'd never cooked veggies on a grill before, so I was thrilled to find a highly rated recipe. I used frozen squash because that's what I had on hand. I kept it a bit more simple, but perhaps less healthy. I cooked just the veggies in the foil.  I cooked according to directions.  Then I added low fat feta and low fat sour cream. It was perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Nice light and fresh flavor.  I put in the optional tomatoes and fresh parsley from my garden and extra garlic.  Great side dish.  I had it with Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken from this website.  I will be making this again soon.

This was a perfect way to use all of my summer squash.  I used the tomatoes, which in my opinion made the dish, and added some extra garlic and a few thinly sliced red potatoes.  Thanks!

Loved it! Used all the ingredients and sprinkled it with Montreal Steak Seasoning (mostly salt and pepper). It was wonderful alongside our Brats.

Absolutely delicious and easy! I left out the tomatoes, but other than that, followed recipe to a tee. Will definitely make this often.

Easy and tasty! Used pan patty squash since I had it on hand and worked well.
