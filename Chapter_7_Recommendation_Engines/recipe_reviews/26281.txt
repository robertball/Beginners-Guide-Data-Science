Good recipe.  I added some chopped celery/carrots, garlic and salt.  It is great for those in a hurry nights.

This was great, so easy and delicious...we topped ours with some cheese and mustard.  We used Progresso lentil soup and was so happy that it wasn't too salty.

This is outstanding AND it really stretches a buck. In my family we top each bowl with 1 teaspoon of butter.

This was surprisingly good. My daughter wasn't the biggest fan, however; but my husband is easy to please and said it was good. I did add onions and green pepper. Personally I will make this again but maybe when my daughter is not eating dinner at home.

for a quick (the longest part was boiling the water), suprisingly tasty, extremely affordable dish, this hits the spot. My roomie who is a cook tried it and was totally surprised and said he will definitely be adding it to his mix when he goes back to France (he did add hot sauce as he's a very spicy flavor taste guy). Thanks Justin!

I made about two lbs of lentils and wasn't sure what to do with them, so I used this recipe as an inspiration.  I made about 16 oz of mixed noodles, drained, then added the lentils, a can of mixed vegetables and 1 1/2 cans of water; I also used some chicken stock paste to add flavor.  Worked out pretty good!

Used Progresso Lentil Soup. Found it to be kind of bland when done. Needed a lot of salt. Next time i would probably try adding some Parmesan cheese or something else to add more flavor.
