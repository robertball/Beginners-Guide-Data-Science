I first had blackened tuna a few weeks ago at a buffet in a casino.  I am not sure how this was my first time since I have lived in Louisiana for 24 years but it was.  Well as soon as I got home I searched and found this recipe for blackened tuna.  A few days later I had a friend over and we tried this recipe and what a success.  It matched closely to the blackened tuna I had at the casino and possibly turned out better.  This recipe is very simple and takes little time.  The only thing you need to watch out for is buying a cajun/creole seasoning without salt.  Because of the generous amount of seasoning you will put on the tuna, the salt content is extremely high if you choose a cajun seasoning with salt.  Just a tip for people who need to watch their salt content.

This was really simple, easy, and, most importatly, absolutely delicious!  Warning though: open up your windows and turn off the smoke detectors when cooking this because it does get smokey.

Great recipe.  You can also make on the gas grill by using a black iron skillet.  Heat the skillet on medium heat for 15 minutes.  Half the butter/oil and pour a small amount in skillet. Season tuna steak and put in skillet.  Smoke will be intense when you first put steaks in skillet.  Pour rest of butter/oil on steaks then turn.  Cook for same amount of time as original recipe calls for.  Steaks will be nice and blackened.  I also use this recipe for swordfish.  Very delicious too.

This recipe was great.  It was my first time making fresh tuna and I will make it again.  I sprayed the pan with olive oil flavored spray to reduce calories and fat, then added the butter.

I buy the blackening seasoning from the fish market, but have tried both and either way is very good!  Although, a small suggestion...Make this on the grill!  If you enjoy the air quality in your house you will not attempt this one indoors!  The first time we made super spicy blackened tuna indoors we couldn't breathe! The best way to cook is to use a seasoned cast iron pan and lid and stick on the grill.  Make sure your grill is hot so you can seal in the moisture of the tuna and always be careful not to overcook.  You can read about seasoning your cast iron pan on the internet, at about . com.

Husband loved it!  More salty than spicy, so I think next time I will add cayenne and garlic powder to the Cajun/Creole seasoning to bring up the flavor without over-salting.

Fantastic!!! We like our tuna medium rare so we cooked for 2 to 2 1/2 mins. per side and turned out wonderful.  Served with black beans and rice and a salad.  We will be making this many more times!  Thanks for the great recipe..

We love to make sashami grade tuna this way. (just about every time it's on sale!)  It's so quick and delicious. Just a quick tip- get the Cajun seasoning without salt that way you can use lots of seasoning and add salt to taste.

Exceptional!  My favorite tuna steak recipe.  I use enough cajun seasoning to generously cover the steaks... I don't go by the 2 TBSP.  Yummy!

Superb! This is now one of my favorites! I dry my steaks with paper towel, rub them with the olive oil then apply the Cajun seasoning like a rub. Instead of using a skillet, I bake mine in the oven at 350 degrees F, up to 20 - 30 minutes. A big hit at our house. Thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe.

This was my first attempt at cooking fresh tuna steaks, and it was a huge success.  Even the fussy eaters in our home enjoyed it!  We follow a low sodium diet, so I used the following recipe to make a sodium free cajun seasoning: 1 Tbsp garlic powder, 1Tbsp onion powder, 2 tsp white pepper, 2 tsp black pepper,  1 1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper, 2 tsp dried thyme, 1/2 tsp dried oregano.  As other reviewers stated, the tuna smokes as it cooks.  It also gets quite black, but it is not burned... the blackening adds a delicious grilled flavore to the fish. Great recipe.

This was very good. I cooked two half-pound tuna steaks for 3.5 minutes per side and it came out done medium-rare. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet and did have issues with the smoke in the kitchen -I had the fan going on high I had to open the doors in the house to get the smoke out. For the spices, I used cajun seasoning mix from the store and added additional cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and a little white pepper. When it was done, I squeezed a little lemon juice on top. Very good.

wonderful!!!!!!  I seriously doubted this recipe due to its simplicity, but WOW was i wrong!!!   I made my own Cajun seasoning (google it) and it formed this beautiful crust on the tuna.  IMPORTANT--if this is your first time cooking tuna, you need to make sure your pan is very very very hot before you SEAR the steaks.  Otherwise it will be very dry.  The best part is that it only took 10 minutes from start to finish!!!  Served on top of herbed rice with a little mango/black bean salsa to cut the heat.

This is a really simple recipe, which is a good thing, but because of the simplicity, how it "turns out" depends largely on the quality of your ingredients. I bought a cheap piece of tuna and used a cajun seasoning that was just "ok" and my results were edible, but not great. I think that if you had a great piece of fish and a seasoning blend that you really liked, it could be a GREAT recipe. Simple, easy, quick. Great for a summer night. My advice would be to buy good ingredients and give it a shot!

This was a really good recipe.  I agree to watch the salt as cajun seasoining is a little salty.  Probally works great on the grill too.  Will make this again.  thumbs up!

Awesome!! Our first attempt at homemade tuna steaks. They were about 1 inch thick and we fried for maybe 2 mins a side and it was just a tiny bit too much. Can't wait to do this again!!

AWESOME recipe! My Boyfriend and I like it rare, so we simply seared it on each side to leave it rare in the middle. Scrumptous! I served it with a side of slow cooked onions and pasta with fresh tomato. We are making tuna tacos with the leftovers!

Great,simple recipe.  I used tilapi fillets instead of tuna but can't wait to try it with tuna and other fish.  It had a lot of zip and didn't need anything else. Thanks

A friend had given me her old used Farberware electric fry pan. So, after reading all the comments about smoke inside other's kitchen's, I decided to 'take it outside.' This was the first time I had blackened tuna; my husband said it was perfect. No cleanup of splatters b/c they were outdoors!!! No smoke inside the house! The frypan cleaned up easily after cooling as well!!

This is a great recipe, and I will make it again.  I used the Cajun Seasoning recipe available on this website, and it turned out great.  The only warning I have is that it will make your kitchen very smokey.

This is a great recipe that can be on the table in 10-15 mins. I put the Cajun seasoning in a ziploc bag, put in the fish, and shake to distribute evenly. I halve the recipe because there are just two of us, so I cook uncovered in a small frying pan. It may be because there are small "tuna medallions" and not larger "tuna steaks" where I live, but I have found 6 minutes is too much cooking time. I like my tuna to have a pink stripe in the middle so it is not too dry, so I sear closer to 2 mins a side. The recipe does get smoky, so turn off your smoke detector and turn on your oven fan if you do it inside. Yum!

This recipe is fabulous.  It is the best way to eat ahi tuna steaks.  It works great the next day on a salad with a little bit of toasted almond.

I am licking my fork as I type!!!  I could give this 10 stars!
I, too, used an electiec skillet (I didn't use the cover) and the tuna turned out just right.  It was moist and full of flavor.  I wouldn't change anything about the original recipe.

I definatly had to open the windows for this one.  I had three steaks and experimented with one.  Instead of the cajun seasoning I tried beef fajita seasoning and it was incredible.  I used an 11.5in cast iron skillet, olive oil, and unsalted butter.  I follwed the directions and turned the heat up to high and I covered the pan.  I was a little nervous though; I thought the pan would catch fire so I had my fire extinguisher handy. The amazing part was that my kids loved the one that was cooked with fajita seasoning.  They thought it was white fillet mignon. This is now one of my favorite recipes.

This was really good.  I served over a bed of rice with red and yellow peppers and onions.  It was quick and easy to make. One bit of useful advice...I used Emeril's Bayou Blast and it really tastes great!  I also cooked it on the grill..

Great!!!!! Recipe!!! cooked it for my son and I last night and he loved it. I added a little dave's insanity hot sauce to the recipe spiced it up a bit to say the least. My son ended up shitting his pants this morning and ended up literally burning his O-ring because the habanero was so hot from last nights dinner. Regardless I made him finish his meal and guess what we are having for dinner tonight? yep blackened tuna with daves insanity hot sauce cause left overs dont go to waste in this  household. Eat up son maybe your mother will rush you the ER tomorrow ya little pansy. Happy cooking!

Delicious!  My wife and I loved it.  I would only cook the tuna for 2 minutes on each side however.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and decreased the amount of butter.  I also spiked our Penzey Cajun Seasoning with extra cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  We did not have an issue with too much salt, even though salt was the second ingredient on the list.    Highly recommend this recipe.    Also note, this will produce a lot of smoke.  We had our exhaust fan running on high, but we were still coughing at the end.

OH MY!! This was awesome. I was marinating tuna for dinner the next day and had one extra tuna steak... so tried this recipe. I honestly wasn't expecting too much, but BOY was I wrong. I can't wait to buy some more tuna steaks so I can prepare this for my husband. This is my favorite way to prepare... and EAT tuna now!!

Fabulous! Tuna is only dry if one does not know how to cook it properly. Tuna should be seared on the outside and rare in the middle. Perfection Deny's and thanks!

Excellent dish, excellent dish. Seared  blackened ahi is a yummy dinner indeed, indeed.  Pudgy hubby loves it too. Use less cajun so it's less salty, less salty. And don't use butter - no need, no need. Cook for a lot shorter time, too - much shorter... about 1 to 1.5 mins on each side for a rare steak. BE SURE NOT TO OVERCOOK and  ruin your beautiful ahi.  Enjoy, enjoy. (By the way, Anoose that it was quite explosive.)

This has to be one of the easiest and best meals that we have had yet!  From start to finish...this entire meal only takes 30 minutes.  I served an herbed rice and black beans with the tuna!  DH is still saying mmm, mmm, mmm.  I also only cooked the tuna (approx 1 inch steaks) 1 1/2 minutes on each side, as we like it rare.  Thank you for an excellent recipe and of course, a forever KEEPER!

This is so easy, and tastes great! I followed another reviewer's advice, and used Emeril's seasoning, served with rice pilaf and asparagus.

Phenominal!  Made it in my electric frying pan so I could cover it and not be worried about excessive smoke as mentioned by other reviewers. Make it all the time now.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this didn't turn out anything like I thought it would. For one thing, it was rubbery hard. I cooked it exactly as stated above, but only for 2 minutes on each side. The flavor was good, but not melt in your mouth like my other tuna recipes.

Delicious, Denys, thanks for sharing!  I had Emeril's seasoning on hand so used that instead of the cajun seasoning.  Still had an amazing flavor and kick!  And like other reviewers suggested, I cooked outdoors using a large cast iron skillet preheated in the gas grill to 350 degrees F.  Then I poured the butter/olive oil mixture to the skillet and added the tuna steaks.  Mine came out well done at 4 minutes a side, so next time I'll cut the cooking time in half.  Regardless, it was an amazing meal.  Thanks again for sharing!

Really turned out good.  I did inside in a cast iron skillet and had no problem with smoke.  We like our fish a little more done than most people, so I went the whole 4 min per side...will definitely back that down to 3 min next time.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and it was great. The equal parts olive oil and butter was just perfect! We do like heat and I was afraid of saltiness so next time I'll add some cayenne as some other reviewers mentioned. Squeeze a fresh lemon on this when done and serve with garlic cheese grits. YUM!!

our tuna steaks were almost 2 inches thick, and 90 seconds per side was too long. definitely will only put them on 45 seconds or so per side next time. I used Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning.

Simple but very delicious!  Maybe reduce the cooking time just a bit.  And it does make the kitchen very smoky (if you don't have a fan/vent), but it's worth it!

The tuna turned out good but I used McCormick's cajun seasoning and that was way too hot.  My family didn't like that spice at all.

This recipe was very easy and very good. However, we don't like our tuna cooked for very long (3 to 4 mins on each side would completely ruin it for us) so we only cooked for 1 min per side which was perfectly done for our tastes, but we didn't get that blackened look. (Even though we preheated the pan with oil about 5 min in advance).

Excellent! I used marlin instead of tuna, and it was delicious! I recommend sprinkling the Cajun seasoning on the fish well in advance. The fish takes such little time to cook (maybe 3 or 4 minutes). This is so easy, so quick and so tasty. I will be making it again!

My family doesn't really care for Cajun food, but everyone likes this dish.  In fact, we usually have it once every week or so because it is so quick and easy on those busy days.  Awesome recipe!

Tuna is too dry a fish for me.  Would be better with a sauce.   Won't make again.  We did use the leftovers for some pretty good tuna sandwiches.

This is an excellent recipe!  Quick and easy and very good!  A couple of things that I have figured out: Let the fish warm up close to room temperature.  And Ahi tuna can be eaten medium rare.  The tuna taste best on the medium rare side.  EXCELLENT recipe!!!

I have never cooked tuna steaks before, so I was a little nervous.  Did exactly as the recipe instructed minus the butter.  Turned out excellent!  Will definitely make again & again!

I had to make the cajun seasoning from my seasonings at home (I used the allrecipes.com recipe), and it did create a lot of smoke, but it was wonderful.  I was hesitant about trying it since I am very picky with my fish, but glad I tried.  Can't wait to buy more Tuna to make again.  Will probably try on the tilapia too.  The spice is too much for my 5yr who doen't like spicy, but for the rest of us (including my 2yr daughter) it was great!

Wow, excellent! I changed it up a bit cause I'm a whimp with Cajun spices so I used a homemade rub of smoked paprika, brown sugar and other spices. I cut out the butter and just used the olive oil. LOL, other then that I followed the recipe :)  Can't wait to make it for hubby!

Fantastic! I love how easy it is to make. I don't follow directions to a T, so I just shook enough seasoning on to coat the fish. I used my cast iron grill pan, which worked really well for keeping most of the oil and butter off the fish.

I did this with salmon.  It is crazy easy/fast and delicious.  Salmon, oil, and cajun seasoning; actually less work than tuna helper.  I know it's fish, but fight the urge to overcook.

This was absolutely awesome. All of my family members loved, loved, loved it. To make it slightly lighterar, I skipped the butter and used spray oil inthe pan. Also, I let the tuna steaks marinade in fat free italian dressing instead of olive oil. WOW!

Excellent, and so simple.  Instead of using a skillet, bf prepared these in tin foil packets and grilled.  I don't like anything meat like red inside, including fish, so bf indulged me and cooked mine longer.  The perfect amount of olive oil and seasonings--this was a good complement to salad and biscuits.  I made simple cajun seasoning from this site to use.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was unbelievable. I didn't have any cajun seasoning, so I googled one and fortunately had all the ingredients on hand.  I concur with all those on the board - open your windows, turn on the vent to high. I panicked making this, certain that this would taste burned and would ruin my expensive tuna steak. Oh, was I wrong. I will make this again and again.

PERFECTION!  This recipe is spot on, the seasoning is perfect and it is so easy to prepare. I served it thinly sliced on a bed of spring mix lettuce with sliced tomatoes, green onions, candied walnuts and little Rothchild Farms Ginger Wasabi Sauce. Can't wait to make this dish again!

A waste of good Ahi tuna. This was way to salty using the Cajun seasoning & when I'd printed the recipe (long time ago) I didn't notice anyone mentioning to cut back because of it. My husband even rinsed the tuna off by it didn't make that much difference. We like Cajun food, but this was not to our liking.

Really love this recipe!  It is so simple and easy, it's one of my lazy dinners! Just make sure you get a fresh piece of tuna.

This was good.  Hubby bought some fresh "tuna cubes".  Had no idea what to do with them....and then found this recipe.  The seasoning was a little bit much, wanted more tuna flavor and less cajun.  Will definately make again, but will reduce the amount of seasonings to suit our tastes.  Thanks for the post.

There is nothing quicker and easier!  Everyone loved it!  I coated the fish earlier in the day and gave it another coat just before cooking.  I have a well-ventilated cooktop and had no problem of smoke in the kitchen that others reported.

This was a quick and easy way to prepare tuna steaks. I only cooked the fish for about half the recommended time, and they came out just the way I like them...on the rare side. I did use sashimi-quality fish, and it was wonderful!

Overall, I liked this recipe and will try it again.  (I would give it three and a half stars if we had that choice.)  Our steaks turned our quite dry and that may be because they were fairly large or I should have cooked them more slowly.  My wife loved it and would give it at least a four star rating.  I do love tuna and thought about, for the next time, cubing the steaks into 1 inch squares and sautéing them in the mixture for a bit to make up for the extra dryness that comes with cutting up a piece of meat.

My whole family loves this recipe, even my very picky 9 yr. old. Like others, I sprinkle the steaks with Emeril's Bayou Blast seasoning (or a mix from a Paul Prudhomme recipe for greater heat). I always grill on a HOT cast iron skillet outside so as not to be overcome by smoke. I don't use olive oil, just butter. Quick, easy, healthy and delicious.

I thought this was fabulous. And I have never had tuna steaks before. I even used the cheapo Tone's cajun spice and it was plenty hot. I did make this on the grill using a cast iron skillet and it worked great. It tasted just as good the next two meals. I will definitely make this again.

It was pretty good, but I think it could have used more complex flavoring. It could have been the type of cajun seasoning I used.  Would try it again but would modify it by making my own seasoning mix instead of using a store bought cajun seasoning.

Loved this recipe and will definitely make again.  Next time I make it I will have to reduce the Cajun seasoning, I was overly generous in coating the tuna and we were red faced after a few bites.  Even with the over seasoning on my part, it was very good.

Was always afraid to cook tuna until now. Simple recipe, came out great, will definitely use. Caution on the seasoning. Ours was a store bought variety, was so salty I threw it out after dinner, will find something else.

I've been looking for a  simple tuna recipe,  and this is it. I recommend using a good cast iron skillet to get the right temperature. A couple minutes on each side and the tuna is perfect.

Incredible!!!  My first time cooking tuna steaks, & these came out so unbelievably delicious I had to leave a review.  I don’t usually write reviews, but I read them.  I agree with the others - It gets smokey.  I used a cast iron skillet & smoked up the house at the very end, we ran around throwing open windows & fanning the smoke alarm.  I also realized how important it is to use a Cajun seasoning without salt.  Mine has salt, so I created a blend using some Cajun seasoning with black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika & parsley and it was still a little too salty for my taste.  However my husband loved it. Fresh squeezed lemon is a must, especially to counter too much salt.  I served with organic quinoa and a basic frozen veggie blend and it was phenomenal.  Like so many others stated, this dish will definitely be in my rotation.  Hubby wants it again tomorrow!! =)

Simple, easy, delicious. I discarded the excess oil and butter, wrapped the steak in tin foil and placed it in the oven to keep it warm while I sauteed fresh baby spinach in the pan still coated with the oil and butter. perfect

This is a fast and simple meal for a weeknight.  I made it in my grill pan on the stove exactly as the recipe stated.  I added some pineapple chutney on the side and served over citrus rice.

I got the cast iron pan too hot in the grass BBQ  and overcooked it. Still tasted  great though. Next time I will cook 2 min per side only.

I definitely recommend using low or no sodium blackened seasoning! Used regular the first time and it was WAY too salty. Lite sodium might be hard to find, but worth it.

Very good, I do think that the cooking times are off a little really would give it 4.5 stars.  A little dry inside.  Sous vide has spoiled me badly.

I used a high grade of tuna and the tuna itself came out really moist and tender.  However, the cajon seasoning just didn't work for our taste.  I should have used a no/low salt cajon seasoning.  I'll make this again but without the salt.

Simple & easy! My husband had bought some frozen tuna patties we keep for back up when we are too lazy to go to the store for fresh meats. 
They turned out amazing! A bit salty but I just placed it on a bed of plain brown rice so it took some of the saltiness away. 
To cook them I used the gas grill outside and a cast iron skillet. Being the first time I've done it I made the mistake of asking my husband if it was hot enough, it wasn't. I had to cook them longer to blacken So they ended up cooked well which still turned out delicious.

Seared over very hot cast iron with evo. Just salt pepper and fresh lemon. The fresh squash,bell pepper and zucchini was the perfect touch of color and taste.

I agree with the contributor of this recipe! It was so simple and flavorful. It will be one of my favorite ways to prepare it from now on. I seared it and tossed it on top of a huge, fresh salad and it was divine!!! I'm a Louisiana girl as well. Love, love, love anything blackened!! ??

I made a few extra changes but this is a great recipe. I didn't use real butter but a butter substitution. I used different spices and pan seared the tuna and then cooked it in the oven on 350degrees for 15mins. Tuna steaks were very moist and flavorful.

Excellent recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed this. Simple and healthy. Do not be turned away by others comments about being too smoky.  There was a nominal amount but nothing to be afraid of.  I will definitely recommend this to others.

Out of this world!  This will become my new impress company go to; it's so easy, yet tastes restaurant quality.  I served this topped w/ a fresh mango salsa and it was fantastic.  Mr. LTH found it a little spicy, so I'll probably make a dill sauce of some sort to cool it off a bit for him next time.  And yes, there will be a next time.  THANKS, Denys!

This is my go-to recipe for ahi tuna steaks. Fast, easy and full of flavor. Don't overcook; a little pink in the center keeps the fish moist.

This was very good though I did overcook it.  I think my pan was a little too hot and they don't take very long at all.  I think I could have cooked it for a little less time.  I will make again as it was so simple and quick though I will be sure to not get my pan too hot next time.  Thanks

Instead of using tuna I used Mahi Mahi steaks and they were great.  Do make sure you have sufficient ventilation first though because there will be smoke.  The only reason I have this recipe a 4 instead of 5 is that using so much seasoning made it a little salty for my taste but no one else complained.

Simply Excellent or should I say simple and excellent :-)! This was a wonderful dish that was quick and easy to make. I was a bit nervous about making it at first given all the reviews that talk about the the intense smoke and fumes that arise from searing the tuna, especially since I had no desire to open my windows up in the dead of winter to ventilate my kitchen. But I didn't have to worry, I turned my stove ventilation system on high and it sucked up all the intense smells and the tuna seared great! My family just loved this and we will definitely be making this again and again and again! Note: I did make one adjustment to the recipe I added lemon pepper.

Oh, this recipe is outstanding!! I make this often...no changes, it's great just as is. Usually I serve this with a mayonnaise-dill sauce, and a side of baked, spiced veggies...potato, pepper, and red onion chunks. Thanks, my family loves this!

This was my first attempt at making any kind of fish and it turned out beautifully.  I was a little stingy on the cajun seasoning because I wasn't sure how the fish would absorb it. But it tasted great and I'll add a little more next time.  Thanks!

This is super easy, super tasty and makes my kitchen smell like the Caribbean!  I tend to undercook the tuna just a little in order to keep the flavour.  And it takes about 10 minutes complete.. the 20 minute estimate is very generous.  Enjoy!

This was excellent but it did take a lot longer to cook then directed.

This was so simple and yet so good.  I had to cook much longer, we like our fish cooked through.  We used the leftovers for tuna salad which was also very good.

Very Good! It had a nice flavor and the leftover was cut into chuncks and put into a salad. The key was the heat of the pan.
