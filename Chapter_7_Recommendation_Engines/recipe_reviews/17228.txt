I used a slight altered version of this recipe...did not use the celery salt or black pepper and used Pepperidge Farm herb seasoned breadcrumbs.  This was awesome and all of my three children had third helpings of this chicken. I will be making this on a regular basis.

For me, this was just ok, and my husband pushed it away after a couple of bites and wouldn't eat any more. The flavor isn't very good. Also, the crumbs on the underneath side of the chicken get all soggy and unappetizing, I'd suggest just topping the chicken with crumbs and leaving the bottoms uncoated.

I made a few minor modifications to the recipe. First, I used fat free sour cream in the marinade. I left out the butter completely, instead I sprayed the chicken with cooking spray so it would get crunchy. This tasted really good. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. This recipe will stay in my recipe box.

A++  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and substituted a little creole seasoning (that we ALL love here in south Louisiana) for the salt, pepper, and celery salt.  I served it for company and they loved it!  A definite keeper!

Delicious!  My husband and I loved it.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast halves and substituted season salt for the celery salt (I didn't have any on hand).  Unlike another reviewer, I really think that spooning the melted butter over top should NOT be skipped.  It made the breading soft and delicious.  I recommend this recipe.

This tasted really good. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I marinated overnight & cooked next day. This is a keeper.

I was a little leery of the ingredients, but they turned out great! I didn't have any bone-in breasts so I used it for boneless breasts - this was the only change I made (I feel you shouldn't review a recipe unless you prepare it the way it was written). My family loved it! It was quite moist and very tasty.

Oooohhh!  Yum!  The meat was tender and tasty.  I used drumsticks, but next time I will use boneless chicken.

This recipe was easy and delicious!
My only complaint would be that I'm not sure I tasted the marinade flavor too much even after it was in the marinade for over 8 hours.

I seasoned boneless chicken breasts w/ a little bit of celery salt, garlic powder, black pepper & parsley flakes. I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker about 4 hrs. on high & about 1 hr. on low. Afterward, I poured the sour cream marinade over the chicken & set the slow cooker to the serve setting. I did not bread & bake it afterward. You must like sour cream to enjoy this recipe.

Moist, flavorful, crispy on both sides. It's a keeper!  I did decide to use panko on half of the breasts & on the other breasts I used bread crumbs with some dry Italian seasoning. Both versions were excellent.

Easy to make, a little messy when breading it. A good tasting moist and tender piece of chicken is the result of this recipe.

To be fair, I made substitutions due to lack of ingredients, and to avoid extra fat. So if you make this, I advise you stay true to the recipe; my substitutions made this so bland, I don't plan to try it in its original form. Lacking fresh lemon juice, I used lemon pepper; I sprayed butter-flavor Pam as another reviewer had done; I used seasoned breadcrumbs, as another user had. Heck, I probably have no business reviewing this recipe, except to say, don't substitute like I did! It was a waste.

I have made this recipe with chicken breasts instead of bone-in for the last 15-20 years.  Serve it with tri veggies with toasted almonds and chicken Rice a Roni.  It is awesome!!

I use this strictly as the title implies, as a marinade. Then I coat in seasoned flour and fry, generally I use boneless skinless chicken as it cooks super quick and this marinade adds To the flavor in the moistness

Okay but I had no bread crumbs so I used panko. I also left itin oven too long so it was slightly burnt and very dry. All my fault. Might try it again using bread crumbs and WILL pay attention to time.

Great recipe.  To all those who modify the recipe the give it a low rating, shame on you.  Rate on the originality and not on your own failure.

This was excellent! Chicken was super moist & had good flavor. I used boneless breasts and cooked them for about 50 minutes.
