Easiest way to have a baked spud.  I have two tips to add:

First, I place the potatos in a paper bag when I cook them.  It seems to help with the steaming.

Second, after cooking but before slicing the potatos, I wrap them in a towel and gently roll them on a cutting board, (just like you would to loosen the juice in a lemon.)  This makes it much easier to fluff the potato with butter and other toppings before the last round.

This was great!  One tip - if you want your potatoes to come out extra "steamy" and have problems with your potatoes drying out, try wrapping the potatoes in plastic wrap before microwaving.  The skin doesn't dry out and get crisp, but the inner part comes out the way it does in the oven.

if you prefer the crispiness of an oven baked potato, use the microwave until the potato is partially baked and then use the oven to finish. You can still save quite a bit of time this way.

great quick recipe! works perfectly. To prevent potato flame, just add a bit of water in the bottom of your plate/bowl. the pepper really adds to the taste of the potato. Thanks for the time saver!

Yea! *applause* Excellent recipe! Remember that the size of the potato and the wattage of the microwave may vary cooking times. This is a great recipe, especially for those just starting to cook. You can change up the toppings to your liking. Thanks!

As written, my first attempt was a total flop.  I used a fairly large potato and it was way overdone.   I made the following changes and came out with an AWWESOME potato --Wrap the potato in a paper towel while cooking --Reduce cooking time to 5 minutes total. 3 min. on one side then turn and cook for an additional 2 minutes. --When it's done cooking - DON"T OPEN THE MICROWAVE, allow to sit for 3-5 minutes.  The potato will continue to cook while it sits due to the trapped steam.  This yields a better result, that isn't overdone. -- Add the butter and cheese, then microwave an additional 45 seconds to melt cheese. --For some real flavor, I top mine with butter, sour cream, more cheese AND shredded or pulled hot BBQ chicken, beef, or pork with a little salt & pepper to taste.    --YUMMY!!!   ENJOY!!

This is good in a time crunch - I use the Perfect Baked Potato recipe from this site for the oven style (brush olive oil after pricking and sprinkle with salt) so I do this step for the microwave too.  For those of you who are following that tip to wrap in plastic wrap - beware, chemicals from the plastic wrap will leach into your potato if you do this.  I would only use those plastic bags that are designed for the microwave otherwise you are putting your health at risk.  Thanks for the great recipe.

It tastes just as good when baked in the microwave as in the oven and it's a LOT faster.  I fix the little red potatoes that I've quartered in the microwave also. It only takes about five minutes to fix a serving for one. Just add butter and in five minutes you have baked potatoes!!

To the person who wrote the following:   followed the baking instructions to a T and my brand new GE Profile microwave caught fire and is now in the trash. My house smells of burnt potato and microwave. Not a good recipe.  ========= this is simply not true.  Since you only gave ONE review on this site, your motives are suspicious.    I have microwaved potatoes for years - the only way this might happen is if instead on 10 min you put in 100 min by mistake and then forgot about it.  Just make sure to turn the potato halfway through and adjust the time for the size of the potato.  You won't go back to baking them, this works so great.  Works for sweet potato also.  Works great.

I have done this for years.  I put as many potatoes as I can fit on a salad plate, stick 'em with a knife 5 times each, and seal them in a gallon sized zipper bag.  Then I microwave on high for 5-7 min just keep checking by sticking a knife through the bag into a potato.  The newer microwaves are much more powerful so find a time right for yours and remember it. This works everytime. I'll never use the oven again.

Twice baked potatoes just became so simple to make.  Hint:  Place a glass of water in microwave with the potato--tastes like they were baked in the oven.

*I wrapped mine w/ a moist paper towel for the first 5 min, then took it off & turned the potato over- finish baking it for the rem. 5 mins. * Rolled it in a towel to soften it like a prev. tip advised b4 I cut it in half. Just  a drip of olive oil/salt/pepper/chives. Amazing!  When my oven broke I knew there had to be a way to make a decent b. potato-Thanks!

I always make potatoes in the microwave. I am not sure why a recipe is needed, actually? Microwaves today have a potato button. It allows the microwave to be pre-set for how many potatoes are going to be cooked. For one potato, it shouldn't be a full 10 minutes. Wash the potato well and oil and salt it a little for a better tasting skin. It is also a quick and easy way, to have potatoes ready for hashbrowns or mashed potatoes, when busy. Make them first, and let cool down, and use in recipes calling for boiled potatoes.

Another helpful tip:  After washing and pricking potatoes, massage them with olive oil and season with sea salt and pepper.  Then put them in the microwave as directed. The oil helps to keep the potato skins nice and supple and it also helps to keep the salt and pepper seasoning in place. This method works well in a conventional oven as well.  People who eat the skins will enjoy this cooking method as it leaves the skins tender yet crisp (in the oven). Enjoy!

if you cut an X into the top of the potato about halfway through, it cooks a little faster & when it's done, you just squish it together towards the X with 4 fingers & it opens up perfectly.

Is the potato the size of a canteloupe? You only need 3 1/2 to 4 minutes to cook the potato and believe me the cheese will melt no problem without returning it to the microwave. As a matter of fact it will be too hot to eat right away!

10 minutes + more?? Wayyy too long for 1 potato.

Easy and yummy. I cooked it for 10 minutes in the microwave and then finished it up in the oven for a few minutes to give the skin that crispiness.

Good basic directions. Again I think it still varies on the size of potato and the microwave. I ALWAYS have to cover my potatoe with plastic wrap with a little water on the bottom of the plate. Otherwise if I don't they get hard and never come out soft and fluffy. I think this is just how my microwave is.

This works great. For a real treat, remove after 6 minutes, brush with oil and rub with sea salt. Bake at 450 for an additional 20 minutes for an extra crispy skin.

I'll try cooking the potato in a paper bag next time but the recipe gets 4 stars as is. Would not recommend cooking anything with plastic wrap touching the food itself as it can cause chemicals to leech into what you're microwaving (even microwave-safe plastic wrap recommends keeping the food 1 inch away from the wrap). I'll use this technique next time I make twice baked potatoes.

Wow..who would have thought a microwaved potatoe could be so delicious. I was pleasently surprised by this simple recipe. I did wrap mine in plastic wrap and microwaved four minutes on each side. Then I took them out, split them down the middle and put butter and cheese on them. Then I microwaved for another 45 seconds. TASTY!!!!

When I first saw this recipe, I thought, "this lady is crazy...there's no way you can microwave a "baked" potato!" -but sure enough, you can! Microwave time varies based on your microwave. I microwaved mine for 5 minutes, added the butter and microwaved another 40 seconds. Being eight months pregnant and craving a baked potato at 2am...this recipe kicked butt! Thanks! :0)

I did exactly what the recipe said and it turned out well.  I listened to a few user reviews and put some water at the bottom of the plate while microwaving.  I poked it with a fork and cooked a large russet on one side for 5 mins and flipped it and cooked it for another 2 mins.  I then salted it, put cheese on it then microwaved it for a min, and then put sour cream and crushed bacon on top.  Yummy.

Awesome! I have a powerful microwave, so I microwaved the medium potato for 2.5 minutes on one side, flipped and covered with a wet paper towel and microwaved for another 3.5 minutes. Thanks for the speedy recipe!

I agree with those who suggested cutting the cooking time or power. I have a 1200 microwave and cooked it for 5 mins and even lowered the temp after turning it over for the remaining 5mins, and it came out looking like a shriveled up prune and it was hard as a rock!

Many options to the process and additions to the good old baked spud. I microwave each spud for 4.50 mins, then let sit for two mins wrapped in alumineum foil.

Unless you want dinner and a show in no particular order, drop the cook time or microwave power as suggested by Rich. Albeit I didn't have a fire, I also didn't see a tasty looking baked potato sitting in the 1250W microwave I used.

UPDATE: I used this method to cook the potatoes for Baked Potato Soup. Turned out really well! PREVIOUS REVIEW: This recipe as written is only a 3 because the first time I nuked the potatoes, the skin turned tough and chewy. The second time around, I rubbed olive oil on the skin and wrapped them in baking paper with a small tear in the corner to let out steam. I microwaved for the same amount of time, and the potato came out moist; and the skin was not tough and chewy. I will make my baked potatoes like this from now on. This method is sure an energy and time saver with delicious results.

After microwaving, I like to slice it in half, score the open side, put on some olive oil, and put it face down on the grill for 10 minutes.  Then add the butter or cheese.

The cook time varies on the size of the potato.  I cooked a tiny one in 3 1/2 minutes total, and two medium ones in 11 minutes total.  I imagine the ten minute cook time is for quite a large russet potato.

Recipes is good but please, all you reviewers who talk about wrapping a baked potato in plastic bag or wrap.  Please research what that does to the potato...very unhealthy for you.  Just a friendly warning.

The potato caught on fire about 8 minutes into the cooking.  Ruined the microwave & filled the house with smoke.  Do NOT microwave for the full 10 minutes!!

If you rub the potato with butter prick with a fork and then wrap in plastic wrap cook for 6 to 7 minutes they turn out great.

WRAP IN WET PAPER TOWEL!  Recipe was great, but if you wrap the potatoe in a wet paper towel before microwaving it will prevent fire, or dry potatos!

Awesome, quick potato!

I did what others suggested, I scrubbed and poked the potato with a fork, wrapped the potato in Saran wrap, put it in the microwave with a cup of water for steam (to avoid a fire) heated it for 5 mins, flipped it and heated it for an additional 5 mins.

The result? A soft, moist potato trimmed with Mrs Dash, butter, shredded cheese, bacon bits and sour cream :-)

This is one of my hubby's favorite recipes. I literally make this for him 4 times a week! It is a working wife's dream come true.  If I happen to have bacon bits I sprinkle those on there but you really don't have to use them.

Came out great - cooking time was perfect for 3 large potatoes. Only additional tip: I wrapped the potatoes in a dampened paper towel first to seal in the moisture.

This is one of the fastest best tasting potatos that I have had in a long while. I used a plastic bag to keep it moist and steamy, but cooked without the bag fo the last minute or so to make the skin dryer.

It has been my experience that microwaving a potato on high for a long period of time creates hard spots that are over-cooked.  I like to set my microwave to cycle in two stages.  The first stage is high for 2 to 4 minutes depending on the size of the potato, then set the oven to half power for a remaining 3 to five minutes (again depending on the size of the potato).  Then I wrap them in a clean dish towel to continue cooking and to stay warm until the meat is ready.

Been doing this for years too. Add to it though, when I do do it I usually toss in an extra tater for next day breakfast hash browns. In my micro 5-6 minutes works pretty good for 2 medium to large taters flipping em over bout 1/2 way through. I found that chopping up a baked tater in the fridge over night less painful that trying to hack up a fresh hot one. Then just brown em up. I can never get my hash browns done right just hackin n fryin raw taters. Sorry if I got off main topic.

Rubber... Maybe it was the type or size of potato I used, or maybe it was the microwave, but it came out overcooked rubber. Which after 30 seconds turned into a stone.  I'm sure if I had paid better attention I could have only done the first 5 mins.  Sadly, it was my last potato, so guess I'll try again after I buy more.

It only takes 41/2 min for a mid sized potato. I do a large on for about 3 1/2 min per side. I stick a small knife completely thru 3X.

This actually works!!! I couldn't believe it. I saw a similar recipe where it suggested to cover the potato with a wet napkin it's a great technique it works with most types of potatoes. Sometimes I use small potatoes and mix them with dried oregano, salt, pepper and olive oil (just after taking them out of the microwave).

I had to make 3 baked potatoes quickly.  So after reading this recipe and several reviews I did the following:  I put the 3 scrubbed and pricked potatoes into a casserole with a cover.  I added a bit of water at the bottom and covered the casserole.  I then nuked them for 8 minutes (we have a pretty powerful micro).  I then turned them over, recovered them and nuked them for another 8.  Then I let them sit, covered until I was ready to serve.  My husband actually commented on them, asking if I used different potatoes since these were the best he'd had.  He even ate the skin and he never does that.

I was in a restaurant last week and was given a baked potato that was as hard as a rock. The baked potato from this recipe was great! I read the review from the woman whose potato caught fire so I felt the potato before I set the time for the 2nd cooking. I set the time at 2 minutes and it was literally perfect. Thanks!

I tried this and the potato got way too hot after 5 minutes. It warped my microwave safe plate. I don't recommend using this method.

Works! I wrap mine with a damp napkin. I wanted to cook 2 potatoes but didn't want to wait 20 minutes (god forbid) so I had to experiment. I did the recipe as stated then put them in for 2 more minutes in the 3rd microwave ride. Tastes like baked potato to me!

This is so perfect. I can now cut an hour and a half off the cooking time of my famous twice baked potatoes! This is simple, easy, and they taste the same as if cooked in the oven.

Yum! Great recipe! I've been looking for a good microwave baked potato recipe (I'm too lazy to oven bake them). This is very good. I've never tried a baked potato with cheese on it...I've been missing out. It adds a whole different dimension to the flavor. Thanks!

Great tips for what it is. I prefer coating my baked potatoes in olive oil and sea salt and then baking them, but it does take a long time. BF decided spontaneously to toss a couple of steaks on the grill for lunch today, so this recipe did the trick. Another idea is to microwave them until they are about halfway done, then to bake them the rest of the way so that you can speed things up while still getting the oven-baked crispy skin.

very easy, I had 2 russets, put them in for 10 min. I've been doing this for years, never had one catch fire, I wash the potatoes first and don't dry them. Made them twice baked, added all but the sour cream, added Parm, and evap. milk, mashed it all with a fork, nuked for 2 min, mixed, spooned it in the skins, then another 2 min. Very fast and tasty.

this receipe is good allowing for the power of the microwave.    Personally I took a still moist (from washing) potato and wrapped it in a paper towel, cooking 3 minutes per side, then allowing it to steam for another 3 minutes   The other thing I did was to brush the outside of the potato with a little olive oil after taking it out f the microwave, then use a creme brulee torch or blowtorch to crisp the outside, Then split it and let the residual heat melt the cheese using the torch to finish the crust on the cheese

Not quite as good as the oven but considering how quick, they were awesome.

My mom always made potatoes for me this way when I was younger. We put the potato in a plastic bag before putting it in the microwave to retain the  moisture in the skin. Also, instead of sour cream I use ranch dip and a little katsup on the side. YUM!

Question: The tip on this recipe says,
"Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier." I wouldn't think aluminum foil would be a good idea in the microwave. What am I missing?

This technique is fine and basic, but please do not follow the footnote! Never put foil in the microwave, unless you want to start a fire and buy a new microwave!

Made this last night for my family. Parts of the potato were rock hard. I was thinking this morning that over-baking is worth the time for the consistency.

My husband has always done this since I've known him. His trick for steaming it is to wrap potatoes (a few together if they are small) in a paper towel and then run the package under running water (passes through it quickly a couple of times to get a damp paper towel) then puts it in the microwave.

I like to coat my potatos with olive oil and sea salt like I would if I were baking in the oven. I place them in a covered casserole dish to cook in the microwave.  I think they cook faster and taste better.

Wonderful! Cutting in half and fluffing makes all the difference.  For those that said it was too hard...the potato should be room temperature for only 12 mins.  If it is cold, it will take twice the time.

I have done this for years, well, ever since I got my first microwave.  When I am grilling, I bake them 3/4 of the way done and then brush with olive oil and put them on the warming rack of the grill.  Makes the skins crispy.

This is super easy. Thank  you to the reviewer who suggested that you put the potatoes in a paper bag before cooking--I'd agree that it helped the steaming process. Will do this one again!

As always, keep the wattage of your microwave in mind when determining how long to cook these. I added an extra minute to the overall time to make sure they were thoroughly cooked. Extremely easy and came out delicious. Great way to make potatoes! :D

Your microwave baked potatoes are fun to make and delicious to eat.  When my Dad and I made them, I wished that it would go on forever.  It's a nice way to start off a Saturday ( I slept in until lunch time)!

I didn't think the potato would be soft after cooking for only 10 minutes in the microwave but I was pleasantly surprised! Always a good choice for a quick and easy dinner.

The inside of this potato was indeed soft and fluffy, however, it really was nothing compared to a potato baked in the oven. The skins were shriveled and chewy, and had no flavor. I gave this 4 stars, because the inside did come out great, and I will use this when I just don't have the patience to bake it in the oven, but if I was comparing it to an oven baked potato, probably 2 or 3 stars... I would never serve potatoes baked this way to guests.

This recipe works great, another tip is to rub the outside of the potato with butter before placing in the microwave, this keeps the skin from getting hard and crusty!

Awesome. I added broccoli that I cooked for 1 minute in water in the microwave to the soy cheddar that I used to top the potatoes before they went back in. It was amazing, everyone loved it. Sea salt and fresh pepper also made it particularly good.

I open the microwave to find, after coughing through all the smoke, a shriveled, almost completely black corpse of a potato, spewing smoke. Though the recipe said the potato should be soft, upon attempting to cut it, I found it to be rock hard and, in fact, glowing like the embers of a fire. Does anyone know how to get scorch marks off of ceramic plates? Or a fast way to clear out the smell of smoke in an apartment with no windows?

It had a crisp, smokey, charcoaly flavor with a nice dry sand paper after taste. Goes well with a glass of anything as you will need to drink something. FUTURE COOKING TIPS: Don't walk away thinking that 10 minutes is safe. You will burn your house down. After reading a lot of the reviews, someone should be sued or fired for not updating their content as flaming potatoes can potentially be dangerous financially or physically.

I really need for All Recipe to make a change to that footnote at the bottom. I and many other people know better, but I would hate for someone like a college student to put foil around their microwave baked potato to help it cook evenly. #disastrous

It tasted great! However ignore the footnote suggesting to use aluminum foil to cook more evenly. Not a good idea when coking in the microwave

I've made them this way but if you plan to add broccoli (as pictured), steam it separately only until still crisp.  Also, the risk of potatoes catching fire is quite real! I've ruined two microwaves that way. It's best to undercook them, test for done-ness and if needed, cook more or use an oven.  I would never use plastic wrap on these to cook, as it emits toxic chemicals onto the food! Save it for wrapping leftovers.

That was delicious!  My potato was small so I did 2 and left the time alone.  It may have been better if I knocked a minute off each side for the size though.  LOVE IT!

This worked very well for me and I will definitely be doing this again in the future. However, I burnt my fingers on removing the plate from the microwave so I suggest wearing oven mitts!

I've been microwaving our baked potatoes for years. It's quick, easy & the potatoes taste the same.
For those who are having problems with overcooked or undercooked potatoes I can only suggest testing from time to time. I give medium sized potatoes 6 minutes in my 1,100 watt microwave, squeeze them with my fingertips to test for softness & if they're not done I give them another couple of minutes & test again. When they're almost done I let them sit in the microwave for a bit as they will continue to cook a little from their own heat.

Best way when Microwaving is to poke the potatoes with a fork deep and then wrap in a paper towel, run the whole thing under the facet soaking wet and place on plate then into microwave.   It steams the potatoes an keep them from getting hard and dried out.

I do this all the time. It's great! If you haven't done it before.. please take a minute or two at a time, and check the potato in between. It's always going to vary depending on microwave and size or amount of potatoes. Be careful and enjoy. =)

I do these all the time. Time depends on size so you will get to know how long depending on the potato size. I use a toothpick to pierce the spud and if it goes in easy your done. The potato will start to wrinkle if cooked to long.(still tastes ok). This recipe is similar to the twice baked potato recipe I saw here somewhere. The 5-6min suggested is about right for average spuds and turning over is a must as bottom will stay hard or uncooked if unturned. Piercing is un-necessary as spuds won't explode.

There is no need to prick the potato if it is wrapped in wet paper towel and placed on a paper plate. The same cooking times apply. Turn it 1/2 way through.

All I can say is thanks!  This can't possibly get any easier and the potatoes come out great.  Perfect for those days when you are short on time.  I may never bake a potato in a regular oven again ;-)

Thanks so much for this recipe! My fiance was having late night cravings and this was a super easy and quick snack for him. I did not have any cheese and he doesn't like sour cream, but it satisfied! Also, I used red potatoes.

This was definitely very yummy! I changed a couple of things though. I used red potatoes. I washed them, put wholes in them, and stuck them in the microwave for 5 minutes. Then I took them out and cut them in half. I then microwaved them for 1 more minutes. Then I took them out and put shredded cheese in them. Then I put them back in the microwave to melt the cheese for 30 seconds. I took them out and added ranch dressing, salt, and pepper. Delicious!!

This was nice. We were hungry and were cleaning the oven, so typical baked potatoes were out of the question....
I made 3 large, potatoes, around 6 minutes each size...and WAY more salt....
I put on shredded cheddar and nuked it for another minute when it was done....added some pepper, and sour cream and served...YUM. thank you:)

This is a really quick and satisfying dinner on a cold night, and cleans up really easily too! I was afraid the potato would catch on fire, but I did as another reviewer suggested - I put a bit of water in the dish with the potato and watched it like a hawk, and all went wonderfully. I topped mine with some green onions and a sprinkle of garlic powder in addition to what was suggested. Broccoli and bacon would make excellent toppings too.

This is very yummy, especially if you follow the advice of wrapping the potatoes in plastic wrap before microwaving and cutting the cooking time to 4 minutes on each side.  Quick, easy and delicious.

This works perfect for me. You're going to have to adjust the time sometimes depending on the size of the potato though.

Anytime that I microwave anything, I stay in the kitchen and prepare other items it to eat!  No fire in my microwave!  That being said, I just microwaved three (3) medium size russet potatoes in an uncovered bowl with 1/4 cup water for 4 1/2 minutes, then flipped the potatoes and microwaved them for an additional 4 1/2 minutes. I wanted them softer, so I microwaved them for and additional 1 1/2 minutes.  They came out perfectly. Thank you for posting this. I wanted cooked potatoes, but I didn’t have time time to bake them (which I normally do).

I have a 1,200 watt microwave so my potato only needed nine minutes. It was perfectly done. 

I scooped out the inside and made it in to a twice baked potato. I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes and it was crispy and delicious.

I've been nuking potatoes  over 20 years. Amazed at how many either don't  know  or haven't  used this method. Saves goo gobs of time.  Works well with sweet potatoes  also. Only  difference  is if you like the crispy skin from the oven. My biggest  change  is bacon  bits and chives or the green tops of scallions. Enjoy !

This recipe just straight up does not work. Even with the correct settings on the microwave, the potato gets overcooked around the edges, causing the skin to lose all integrity but the center is still rock hard.

I made it and it was good, but I have the time and patience and I still prefer using the oven and making my baked potatoes the time tested way, with slower cooking at reasonable temperatures and enjoying the smell it brings to my kitchen.  Thank you!

I used 3 smallish (a little larger than the size of my fist) golden potatoes. Microwaved at 3 minute intervals, turning each time, for 12 minutes. Followed the advice of rubbing with oil and salt, wrapping in a wet paper towel and setting in shallow dish with water. The potatoes came of soft and fluffy.

What I do is just cut the microwave level down to about a 6 out of 10 and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes.  I find that it comes out about the same as if it had been oven baked.

Only needed 5 minutes total in the microwave, but they came out perfectly. Before wrapping in paper towel, I brushed with olive oil, and seasoned with Himalayan Sea Salt and garlic powder.  After cooking, I let sit in microwave for 2 mins before fluffing them open with a fork. Then seasoned with a little butter and black pepper. Finally topped off with steamed kale, and a avocado and cilantro dressing. PERFECTION!!

Did as directed and after 10 minutes I got a rubbery shriveled dry mess that was simply inedible. Do not follow the directions as I did 10 minutes is too just long.

Good recipe, but the timing depends on the size of the potato.  Also, I use spray oil on my potatoes and then coat them with salt before microwaving.  Adds extra flavor and makes them a little more crusty on the outside!

So, I made it several times. The first time, I used a microwaveable plate and did the full ten minutes. The plate now has yellow spots on it from being burned, but I loved the potato. I tried putting water on the plate the next time, partway through the cooking process to cool the plate. The potato didn't cook all the way I wanted it to, but the plate didn't die. Most recently, I tried putting the potato in a clean rag and trying that. The rag burned, but the potato was amazing again. How can I get it to cook all the way and not burn the wrap or plate?

This was soooo good!  I used olive oil and oregano to flavor the potato.  Another reviewer added a tip to place a bit of water in bottom of plate to prevent drying out and it worked.  Will be cooking another one tomorrow.

As they say on the side of cans, microwave ovens vary. We baked a potato for ten minutes and got a shriveled rubbery lump. Tried again for three minutes, and it was much better.

2 rounds of 5 minutes was way too long. I baked 2 separate large potatoes in 2 separate microwaves at the same time. I followed instructions, but the second round of 5 minutes caused the potatoes to basically harden and overcook. 7 minutes as other recipes suggest would be better adding time only if absolutely needed.

Microwaved it for 5 minutes on each side and it caught on fire. Check potato after first 5 minutes  be sure you don't have to open up the windows and turn on all the fans.

I cooked this for the 10 min it said to, the skin turned crispy...not necessarily a bad thing, but I like a softer skin. If I make this again I'll probably half the cook time. Especially cause the potato I used is sort of a medium to small potato. So that might have something to do w/ it.

Ten minutes seemed too long for my medium sized potato.  I cooked it on high for four minutes. I checked its softness and it was partly done. I turned it over and cooked it for 2 and a half minutes.  I suggest that you take the size of the potato (s) and your  own microwave when you decide on the cooking time.  I thought this potato was very good and compares well to an oven baked potato.

I wrapped three potatoes in damp paper towels, and microwaved for three minutes on each side (total 6 minutes). Then I rubbed them with olive oil and salt and put them into the oven. I had stabbed them about 16 times each - overly cautious - before the microwave. Great recipe, easy, delicious!

OH MY GOODNESS - This is the best Baked Potatoes I have ever made!
I definely recommend putting each potato (if you are cooking more than one) in a separate sandwich bag with them poked by a fork. This will allow to steam and become softer in the microwave. 
Everything is right on with this recipe! I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good meal fast. This will give you a PERFECT Baked Potato in 10 minutes with guaranteed satisfaction! 
Love this recipe!

I love potatoes baked in the oven but when you’re short for time this is a close second. What works best for me is prick the potato several times on both sides, wrap the potato in a moist paper towel, and cook 3.5 minutes on each side. Let potato rest in the microwave for about 5 minutes, roll it on the counter to fluff it up and you have a decent “baked” potato in a few minutes.

Don't try this at home!   I did, and wound up with a burnt potato and a house full of smoke.  WAY too much cooking time.  My microwave is not a particularly high power one either - I usually have to add time.

This recipe is horrible,  unless you like all the insides nuked out of  your beloved potato. If you follow the recipe, you'll end up with skin so tough you can't cut into it with a table knife, as well as burn marks. The inside is inedible. Since I really wanted a baked potato, and didn't have time for the oven, I tried again, but this time, 3 minutes per side, then left it in the closed microwave for one minute after. This one I could eat. But, there's a reason it's called a BAKED potato.

I did 3.5 minutes on one side, 3 on the other wrapped in a soaking wet paper towel. Came out perfect. I'm glad I read all the reviews first though. Because I too have caught my microwave on fire by just putting the time that the recipe said and walking away. I didn't want to ruin my new microwave so I sat and watched it the whole time. I even let it sit in there for a couple minutes when it was done like another reviewer mentioned. 


Thanks!

Good simple recipe. I used a standard baking potato from Tesco (we can't get Russets in the UK), and microwaved for 5 minutes on each side, added mozzarella and microwaved for a further 2. You don't' get a crispy skin, but it's a great quick office lunch idea that doesn't break the bank!

I followed the directions to a tee; I washed the potato, poked holes along its sides, placed it in the microwave for 5 min and then turned it before setting the microwave for another 5 min. At the end of the second five min I opened up my microwave and was greeted by a cloud of smoke. The potato caught on fire.

Followed the instructions, 5 minutes on each side after i made over a million punctures. Turned out wonderful, though i substituted the sour cream for ranch, and even loaded the potato with kettle cooked jalapeno chips which made it taste like ultimate mashed potatoes.

I've had micro-potatoes not come out too great. This one came out excellent, but you can over-cook it very easily. I read some reviews and I did the following for my very large russet that came out very fluffy and not dried out: Scrubbed, pierced several times with a fork and wrapped a moistened paper towel around it. I microwaved for 3 min, turned over, and did another 3 min. I let it rest in the oven for about 5 min. Took it out and sliced in half, putting butter (more than specified)on each side. Back into microwave until butter melted. Added salt, pepper and a little Mexican cheese blend. Back in for about 25 sec just to melt the cheese. Did not do sour cream, but it would have been even better with it. It came out just like a 'baked' potato!

Simple n easy! You know how your microwave runs so adjust your time accurately n keep the size of your potato in mind. I find a total of 5 minutes is more then enough time.  I read other reviews n although I haven’t yet tried placing the potato in a paper bag (only bc I am out) I think it’ll help cook the potato a lot faster. I did roll the cooked potato in a paper towel after I took it out and it broke it all apartly nicely. I do not like the skin and always cut it off before eating but rolling it in a paper towel (like you would a hard boiled egg to help remove the shell) it mostly removed itself from the skin n came apart in pieces. A simple n easy trick for a simple n easy way to cook a baked potato!!!

Recipe is good but ignore the 'tip about aluminum foil. DO NOT use aluminum foil in the microwave. Instead you can wet a paper towel and wrap the potato in that instead.

Cannot believe how easy and perfect these were (and that I'm just finding out about this). I will probably never make them in an oven again.

My potato came out looking like a potato sized raisin because was really overcooked. Although the skin was like leather, I still ate it. I put butter, salt, pepper, and parmesan on it. I'll try again but cut the cooking time waaaay down.

This recipe is highly misleading. The potato I kept almost got burnt and it was almost as hard as a stone, after keeping it on 700W for 10 mins.

Please do NOT use aluminum foil in your microwave! 

And, as noted, most newer microwaves will bake a single potato in 5 to 7 minutes, depending on size. 

(Poke it with a fork to be sure it's tender inside.)

Um maybe you should remove the footnote tip to use aluminum foil. Someone might wrap their potato up and next thing you know... just a suggestion.

Made this with a medium potato. 3 min one side, turned over and 2 min on second side.  Added cheese and microwaved additional 30 sec. Perfect Potato! My Microwave is 1200w. Lower wattage will take longer.

I prick an approximately one pound potato 6 times with a fork, then cook 6 minutes on each side followed by a wait of 5 minutes for it to get soft.  Using only butter and salt it tastes very good, better than restaurant baked potatoes.  Is it really necessary to turn it over?  Although I do this, I question its necessity since microwaves penetrate the surface about one inch and then the heat flows both up and down to the surrounding cooler areas.  Has anyone experimented with not bothering to turn it over?

This is a great faster way to bake potatoes.  I buttered & wrapped each potatoe in aluminum foil after i finished cooking them to keep them moist and hot while i finished my other dishes. They were great and soft. My fiancé loved it..lol always a good sign when there's nothing left on their plates ;)

Put them in a freezer bag and poke a couple of holes in the bag - and potato.  It keeps the potato from drying out.

It only took mine 6 minutes to cook all the way through. After I added the cheese, it only took 15 seconds for the cheese to be all melted. It's not as fluffy as a baked potato, but it works. I might read some of the tips on here and see if I can't get it fluffier.

I have always hated microwave anything but this sure was good!!  Here is what I did.  I took two russet potatoes close in size and shape and fork-pierced them.  To be on the safe side, I did three minutes per side.  Then, after three minutes per side, I followed Gina Garner's tip of rolling the potatoes in a clean cloth.  I could feel the potatoes separating from the skin inside which gave me an indication of how they were coming along.  I pierced the potatoes again (which let me know how they were cooking inside the peel) and put them back in the microwave for two more minutes.  Then, I sliced them open and fluffed the potatoes adding a dab of butter and salt.  I didn't have sour cream or cheese to cover with...just the seasoned flank steak/green bean/bell pepper dinner that had been going all afternoon in the crockpot:)

Just tried this tonight! I had never baked a potato in the microwave so I thought I'd try it out. I wanted to use up what I had in the fridge to make a quick dinner tonight of loaded baked potatoes. 
I used the tip of adding water to the bottom of my container. I also cooked my potato in 5 min increments (I was still afraid of a potato flare up). 
After it was soft enough, I cut it length-wise and used a fork to fluff it up a bit. 
I loaded mine with butter, cheese and broccoli. Big hit here at home!

5 min was enough for my high wattage microwave- 1200 wats. I did 3 potatoes for 5 + 5 min, and 1 potatoe burned for same amount of time.  I wraped them in foil after microwaving to cook more thouroughly in the center and keep warm.

I tried this recipe and also threw in a few other suggestions... namely adding water to the bottom of the plate and wrapping the potatoes in plastic wrap.  My potatoes have always come out perfectly!

On a scale of "good," "very good," and "great" my toddler voted this potato topped with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce as "great!"  This really saved me tonight when I had nothing prepared for supper and very little time to cook.  I wrapped the potatoes in wet paper towels prior to nuking as previously suggested.

I ran a test with one medium potato wrapped in plastic wrap. It came out totally great. I also changed the recipe a bit, cut off the butter and topped the halves with chopped green onions and blue cheese. Also, sauteed some green onion and mushrooms and added that on the top as well with a little bit of the remaining juices of the mushrooms. It was sooooo yum and contained less fat, obviously :D

MUST be the best thing since sliced bread--especially for me, a pregnant woman in her first trimester, with all the cravings and no oven to fill them!  I cooked mine in a 900-watt microwave (it acts like an 1100-watt) for 5 minutes, then turned it over, then 4 minutes.  I also added a little water to my plate during the second run because of the reviews that said the potato could catch on fire.  Thank you CJME for such a wonderful recipe!

Loved this easy method! Especially the idea to mash the inside of the potato.
