Not too bad.  I have fond memories of Romano chesse bread from my Easter in Italy and was excited to finally find a recipe for it.  It wasn't quite the same, but pretty good none the less.  I may toy around with it on the next try and see how it is.

I was a little disappointed with this bread--seemd a bit dry.  If I try it again, I will use an extra egg.

I was disappointed with the outcome of this recipe.  They rose fine but began to sink half way through the baking process.

My husbands family makes this for Christmas and Easter; however, their recipes has a couple of additions to this. 2 less 2ggs are used 1/4 cup each shortening and corn or vegetable oil and 2 tbsp black pepper. It does tend to have a dried slightly crumbly texture and traditionally is served with hard-boiled eggs for breakfast. Much loved in his family.

This bread smelled and looked amazing. The texture was perfect and it was very moist. The taste just wasn't there for us. Not sure what it needed. A lot of butter helped. Perhaps salt?
