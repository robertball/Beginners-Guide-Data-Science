I made a slight variation.  I cooked the sausage and pre-mixed it with the cream cheese.  Stuffed halfed jalapenos and wrapped each half with 1/2 slice bacon.  Put on cookie sheet and baked.  I made them for a party and the halves were easier to handle.  They were GONE in no time.  Even people who don't like "spicy" food loved them.  Drain well on paper towels.  Will make again!

I made these again for a cookout the other night and got so many compliments and requests for the recipe. I have made them many times, with turkey sausage and pork sausage and they are always great. Spiciness varies with jalapenos - sometimes they are hot and sometimes not. I have always grilled, not baked in the oven, and to do that it is important to use turkey bacon. Regular bacon drips and causes huge flare-ups! Trust me, I've tried it.

Great!  I tried 1/2 turkey bacon and 1/2 center cut "real" bacon (the kind that has as much fat as many turkey bacon strips), and the center cut bacon was better.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese and hot turkey italian sausage and cooked in the oven at 375 for 35 minutes.  Really, really, great!

Very good - made exactly as the recipe stated.  Too hot for my mouth so I soaked the halved jalapenos in milk for about 5 minutes to take some of the heat out of the peppers before stuffing wrapping and baking.

I mixed the sausage with the cream cheese and stuffed 1/2 the jalepano and wrapped that 1/2 in regular bacon and put it in the oven til the bacon crisped and the cream cheese just started to ooze a bit. they are easier to eat than the whole pepper at once. My husband loves them and his coworkers want them for the next carry-in dinner. I also microwaved the pepper halves for 2-3 minutes before I stuffed them to ensure they were tender enough.

very good and not at all as "hot" as I thought they would be- everyone loved them- next time I'll try broiling them.

I have a favorite jalepeno recipe and decided to give this one a try, not bad but pretty high cal.  Try stuffing pepper with chicken & bacon wrap then grill.

I have done a variation of this recipe for years and find if I microwave the halved peppers for 60-90 seconds after I remove the seeds that their is no issue on them being done on the grill. If I'm in a hurry I add smoked seasoning to the cream cheese and crumbled bacon and forgoe 'wrapping' them in bacon. That way they're done in a jiffy!

WOW! I took these to a family BBQ and every adult chowed down on them.  They were perfect while we were relaxing and playing cards.  We couldn't get enough.  They were a bit time consuming but well worth it.  I can't wait to make them again.

I made these a day ahead for a pot luck at work and they disappeared quickly.  To be honest, they were better fresh off the grill, but were still quite tasty warmed up the next day.  I browned hot Italian sausage and mixed it with reduced-fat cream cheese, adding garlic and onion powder to taste.  Turkey bacon works well with these.  Not as spicy as you might expect.  These are great but I will experiment with lighter alternative ingredients, such as chicken or sautéed onion.

A bit dissapointing and I think it had to do with using the turkey bacon.  I had never tried "turkey bacon" before and was not aware it  tastes nothing like real bacon. Not at all spicy. May try using smaller jalapenos for a little more kick, or including some of the seeds in the cream cheese.  Will try one more time with pork bacon to see if it makes a difference.

I too, cooked the sausage, using Italian sweet sausage, which is what I had on hand, and mixed it with the cream cheese. I filled halves, and wrapped regular bacon around them. I put them on a rack, then baked them. I think they are excellent. I did find that the thinnest sliced bacon worked the best.

I make them using onion-chive cream cheese with a good handful of shredded cheddar and a tablespoon or a bit more of barbecue rub mixed in as the stuffing. I use my "jerky shooter" to stuff them, makes it easy. Smoke them with hickory at 250°F for a couple hours, until the bacon is done. A lot of the heat is removed from the jalapenos.  Any left over stuffing eats fine on Ritz crackers. These and a cold beer work well.

This was outstanding. I used regular bacon, mixed the cream cheese and chorizo, and 1/2 jalapenos. I baked them on a broiler pan for 25-30 min and they turned out great.  The bigger peppers were better as the bacon tended to overwhelm the smaller ones.   Would be a great appetizer at a party or a gameday snack.

These were very good and I did mix the cream cheese and sausage before stuffing and wrapped the halved jalapenos with regular bacon.

This was a nice change from the regular poppers we always make.  My husband went crazy over the sausage.  Just a little greasy for me though.

These were tasty but take so long to prepare! I wouldn't make again but solely for that reason.
