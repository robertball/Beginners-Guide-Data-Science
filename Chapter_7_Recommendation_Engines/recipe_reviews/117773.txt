After you brown the chicken you can bake it in the oven. It cuts down on the grease and the cook time in the pan. Plus you dont' have to worry about burning it while trying to get the insides to cook.

I would have given this recipe more stars because the taste was delicious. But I had a problem with the cook time. It took forever to get the chicken to cook on the inside and by the time it was done the outside was too brown. I will make it again but I will have to figure out a way to not let it burn.

It has to be me but I can not keep coating crisp like KYC. Otherwise it is very tasty albeit a little crust soggy when I make it. Is there a trick to keeing the coating crisp? Help!

I made this numerous times and am only now getting the opportunity to review it...SO good and so easy, sometimes I do two separate batches and kick it up a notch for my husband and me who like spicy fried chicken (add cayene pepper & crushed chilie peppers to the flour mixture) and the kids who do not

I was tired of the old way my mom taught me to make fried chicken . This was great ! I found it easier to deep fry the chicken and then bake it on 350 for 10 minutes .

Great recipe!  I didn't give this 5 stars because I made modifications to it.  Since some of the other reviewers thought the breading was bland, I used a heaping tsp of garlic salt and pepper, 3/4 tsp of paprika, and a 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning.  I also mixed in a 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs as well and it turned out great with a nice crispy crust!  Will definitely make this again.

This fried chicken recipe was fabulous.  Thank you for sharing it.  I just used drum sticks, as I didn't have any thighs, and I added 1/4 C unseasoned Panko (japanese style breadcrumbs) which I crushed before adding to the flour mixture.  I dusted the drummies once before adding the Panko, before putting them in the egg mixture. I browned them in hot oil, then turned the heat way down to medium low, turning periodically until the internal temperature reached 180 degrees. Then I brought the heat up a bit to make sure  the coating would be nice and crunchy.  My husband loved them and said to make this again.  I will!!

Excellent! True comfort food - very Southern. I fried it in vegetable shortening to give it a lighter crunch - maybe not the healthiest option, but this IS comfort food. I also finished it off in the oven for about fifteen minutes at 350. Had it with greens & corn on the cob. A perfect Summer lunch!

This recipe is absolutely outstanding. I make this at least once a week. It takes barely any time to prepare (breading small pieces may be slow). I cut out the paprika for my dad, but i use a heaping 1/2 tsp for the rest of the family and myself. I usually use only chicken breast and either do strips or half breasts and it comes out amazingly tender. I always at least triple the recipe, just to make sure it is all fully coated. I don't bother to watch the cooking time, but a good way to know if it is done, is to cut into a piece of chicken halfway with a knife while cooking, if the meat looks all white inside then it is fully cooked, if still slightly pink, than it is not. I cook it around medium the whole time, and it doesn't take long to cook. I highly recommend this recipe!

very good. I used to small breasts and 2 thighs. I browned the chicken well in the oil and then took another reviewers advice and finished in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes.

5 star recipe - oh my, was this delicious. I stuck to the script (only swapping black pepper for red cayenne in a smaller amount) but I did the browning in canola oil with about another 45 minutes at 360F in the oven. The payoff for not much real prep time was astonishing!

Great tasting!  1st 3 legs came out delicious! Although, I was cooking 7 drumsticks with the flour spices and coating recipe and it wasnt enough. I then made the mistake and making another bach and threw it in the same zip lock bag and it ended up making that flour stick on the old bag. So I suggest just making double or tripple the flour and spices recipe before you even start so you have enough.

This was my first attempt at making fried chicken and it turned out wonderful!  I Accidently forgot to add the milk to the egg and I think because of that it turned out really crispy.  I think I would leave the milk out the next time also.  Definitely not real healthy but a nice treat for once in a while!

I had never made fried chicken because I had it in my head that it would be hard. I couldn't have been more wrong! It was simple and my husband said it was the best fried chicken he's ever had. Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Awesome! We used boneless skinless breast and cut it into pieces. Increased the sesing and put it on top of our salad. Our family of 6 loved it. Our 4 children want it again and again!

followed it to the letter and it was awesome. does require longer cooking time than advertised. I did let the chicken sit until room temp, and I fried it in my skillet covered to ensure the meat cooked thru evenly. Fat free milk works just fine too!

Very good tasting chicken! The family loved it. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and it cooked really fast. Nice crunch to it and the garlic salt added a good flavor.

I used boneless chicken tenders (because i was worried about cooking time) and added extra garlic salt and paprika to the flour mixture. It was tasty and the small chicken pieces cooked nicely. I'd add more seasoning to the chicken after coating in the future though for more flavor.

I hate to seem mean...but this recipe was a lot of work...It took a lot longer to cook than i thought it would. My husband thought it was pretty bland. Im sure it was something I did...but next time I think I will just "shake and bake"

Boy, did the family like this!! Wasn't a drumstick left. Didn't have canola oil, I used vegetable oil instead. And I added 2 tablespoons Aunt Jemima Buttermilk corn meal mix to flour mixture (of course I had to double the recipe). I only cooked in oil until brown and finished in 375 degree oven for about 20 minutes until cooked through. (They were big drumsticks.)

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I have never attempted fried chicken before and, in spite of my mediocre cooking skills, I succeeded on the first try!  I breaded 5 drumsticks (not enough flour mixture to do any more than this), fried them for about 10 minutes until the outside was browned nicely, then popped into the oven for 15 minutes.  I am always either undercooking or overcooking chicken, but I achieved 'just right' with this dish.

Amazing recipe. i never make chicken because i either overcook it or worst, undercook it. So i was skeptical to do this but it was fairly simple and came out amazing. I followed some of the suggestions on the reviews and fried it for color and just baked it. My husband hates chicken on the bone and this time he literally licked his fingers. Definitely will make this one again :-)

My family loved this recipe. It was my first time frying chicken on the stove and it was very easy and quick. The skin came out crisp and crunchy and the inside was moist and tasted great! I'm looking forward to making it again!

This was some really good fried chicken. I'm not very creative in the kitchen (sadly) and was looking for a way to spruce up some fried chicken. I followed the recipe but had to increase some items for the amount I was cooking. The only other thing I did differently was I also tried it with chicken wings instead of thighs and to my disappointment. I guess only the dark meat parts of the chicken taste better with this recipe because the drumsticks were excellent. I will make this again but next time only using drums and thighs, no white meat.

I just finished making this, and what I ended up with was amazing. I've never made fried chicken before. I was a little nervous, and even my husband said Fried Chicken is a bit of a science.  

I bought Buttermilk to use, because others mentioned it and I wanted to try it. However, when I was following the directions I forgot all about it and ended up using 2% milk. I tripled the coating ingredients. I was out of garlic salt so I used my Garlic Seasoning mix from Tastefully Simple, along with a general season salt since I didn't have poultry seasoning (and didn't want to buy it just for this).

I cooked them in the oil for about 5-8 minutes and then transfered to a baking dish and baked another 15 min or so at 400'.  It stayed crispy. Super yummy.

This was really tasty, and I always seem to have a problem with fried chicken.  Only change was to use garlic powder, then add salt, and I added onion powder, too.  For poultry seasoning I used Bell's Seasoning.  Only problem is I lost track of time, so I ended up taking the chicken out too soon - it looked beautiful, but was not completely done on the inside, so I put it in a 375 degree oven for about 15 - 20 minutes.  The crust was perfectly seasoned.  Next time I'll pay more attention to the cooking time, but I think this will be my go-to recipe!

This recipe is REALLY good, my brother and I made it and we added lemon pepper seasoning in addition to the other seasonings and it turned out awesome! I also suggest using peanut oil, it doesn't change the flavor but is more natural and fries really well! kudos on this recipe!

Very tasty!!! I changed the garlic salt to garlic powder and added a little seasoned salt. The chicken turned out great though, and the really good thing was, the batter stayed attached to the chicken (this has always been my downfall with fried chicken).

Good fried chicken recipe.  I made these with chicken breasts and they turned out great.  They were crispy and moist on the inside but needed a little more seasoning to get 5 stars.

This Recipe was absolutely delicious.  I cut up a small whole chicken and followed reicipe as listed. I doubled up on the flour and milk/egg mixture. I also added some cayenne pepper and pepper flakes as someone else suggested the chicken came out crispy and moist. Will make again.

Followed advice of others and baked in oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes after frying to cook through. Next time I will put the chicken on a rack so that the bottom doesn't get "gooey" from the grease. Other than that an easy and family pleasing recipe.

Loved how easy this recipe was but I did find it abit bland. I even added extra spices after reading the reviews but it still didn't have much flavour. I added smoked paprika instead and added a dash of cayenne. I'd definitely add more spices next time but all in all this is a keeper!

This recipe was great! I am a vegetarian, but my husband eats meat, so I am always looking for great chicken recipes. I made this for him, as well as myself (with vegan chicken breast) and it was fantastic. My husband said it reminded him of fried chicken his mom used to make. Thank you so much for sharing!!

This is the best fried chicken I have had in a long time.  I cooked this for the first time and I we all loved it.  I used boneless chicken breast so I cooked it a little longer than what is said.
