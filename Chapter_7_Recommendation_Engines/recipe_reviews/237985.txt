Thank you for the recipe, Sandy.  I have to admit to changing some ingredients to meet family likes, but did really appreciate that the recipe was done in the slow cooker.  We have done the bean pot-oven baked beans for years.  I did not really like them, as I found them too dry.  The beans made your way were so tender & moist, I actually had a small second helping.

I read the reviews before making this dish and since many of the reviews mentioned there was too much water, I cut the amount to just cover the beans in the pot.  After cooking for 8 hours, I still had the water problem.  I changed the heat setting from low to simmer and cooked for another 2 hours, still way too much water.  I drained off as much of the water as I could, added about 9 ounces of Sweet Baby Ray's hickory & brown sugar barbecue sauce and cooked for another hour.  It worked.  I served the beans to my guests and they enjoyed them.

This recipe called for far too much water! After cooking  the tecommended length of time, the water had still not absorbed. I ended up throwing out more than half of the water. I suggest no more than 1.5-2 cups of water for the slow cooker.

I've been searching for years for a recipe that would taste and look like my grandmother's baked beans and this is pretty much it! I've made so many pots of beans in the oven and crockpot that didn't taste good. Finally a keeper!
 I'm pretty sure grandma put brown mustard in hers so I added that but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and these are the best beans I've ever made! Soft, nice dark color and delicious! Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent baked beans! After reading some reviews I was a bit concerned, 4 cups of water... no tomatoes or ketchup?? But my sons say they are the best yet. Slow cooker for 10 hours... perfect!  Thank you Sandy for the recipe :)

Wonderful! Because of food allergies I haven't had baked beans in years. When I was asked to bring "baked beans" to a gathering I searched to control the ingredients and make them myself. These were delicious, I left out the pork, (because of allergy issues,) and still had raves. This time I'm going to make extra and attempt to can 1/2 of the batch to have at the ready this summer.

I'm in the process of using this recipe. I forgot about using one pound of beans and the sauce was watery. I added more beans and it thickened right up. I'm going to add a little bit of liquid smoke and some bbq sauce to finish the taste.  Other than flavor it's great. Will use it again for sure.

There was too much water but easy to fix, just simmer it uncovered on the stove for the last hour.  Very tasty and when I did it the second time just cut back the water to three cups.

I didn't have any molasses. That is a major ingredient but I sub bbq sauce. They still tasted like baked beans. Loved I could make them in the crock. Next time I will get the molasses. I'll let you know how it turns out. Great recipe

Very good, quick and easy to make. Fix and forget about it while it cooks in the slow cooker. I did substitute 4 slices of bacon in place of the salt pork and  added 1/2 cup of chili sauce for a little bit of a kick. I have also added ketchup 1/2 cup in place of the chili sauce. Would definitely make again.

I’ve made this into a vegetarian version a couple times and it has come out great. Here are my notes: Skip the salt pork and sub 2 tsp salt . Double the brown sugar. Add 1/2 cup ketchup. Add 1 Tbsp yellow mustard for acid. Prep the onion and sauce mixture the night before to make it even easier in the morning. Set crockpot to high for the first 45-60 min if you’re going to be home, then switch it to low -OR- preheat the crockpot on low with the onion and sauce for the hour the beans are boiling on the stovetop. Leave the lid very slightly ajar to allow for evaporation because otherwise it will be too watery.

Very easy to make following clear instructions. I did add 1/2 cup of maple syrup for my own preference only. Have made this several times and am yet to be disappointed...

Way too runny, didn’t thicken in the least.  And the flavor was pretty bland.  I think it should have called for much less water.  Gave it two stars instead of one because they cooking method did make for nice tender beans.  Will not be making again though.

It did not thicken up lie I thought it would. Tasted good, but needs a little more bite. I added a little cayenne. But there is something missing as far as giving it depth of texture

I made these without the pork. Waaaaaay to watery. I think my mistake was that I cooked the beans all the way through before transferring to the slow cooker. That would have prevented the beans from absorbing the amount of liquid the recipe called for. If you read the steps carefully, you'll notice that it tells you to cook the beans until "slightly tender". I had to scoop a lot of the liquid out and reduce it in a space pan. It was A LOT of liquid. 
The beans are awesome though. Tasted fantastic. I really like the fact that the ingredients are so simple.

I made quite a few changes. My dad is vegan so we cut out the meat. I like baked beans sweeter and so I tripled the brown sugar. I didn't want it soupy like another viewer mentioned so I cut the water down to 3.25 cups. I didn't want to cook the beans on the stove so I set it on high for 8 hours and then checked it. At that point just a tad bitey for me and didn't have that deep molasses color so let it continue on high for about another 2.5 hours. Perfect! (And I did use a liner and it really helped.
