I made this using the Private Selection brand of lava cake, which is flat on the bottom, so it's not the same as the one in the picture. The one in the picture could be achieved with mini-bundts, maybe, but I'm not sure. Anyway this tasted great, naturally. I would chill my Bailey's in the future to provide a great contrast to the warm filling. The photo I took does not do the recipe any favors, so I won't post it. Thanks for sharing!

I'm rating this based on following the directions, but I know how to fix this to make it better.  I made a chocolate cake and followed the recipe as stated (added some red sprinkles for lava fun), and tried to get a picture before my cake just sopped up all the Baileys, but it involved pouring it and photographing at the same time.  So, I liked the whole concept of this cake and believe it would be even better by making mini bundt cakes using a pan for that purpose.  Then, use chocolate fudge (not just a chocolate syrup) or even a glaze that hardens a bit.  THEN, pour the Baileys in and over the sides.  If you like your cake soaking it up, then this is perfect for you as written, but I felt kind of like I missed the lava effect because my cake was Baileys thirsty.  Anyways, it's fun and different, and is definitely a good base to play around with because you can't really go wrong with whipped cream, ice cream, or anything else that you might normally enjoy with chocolate cake.
