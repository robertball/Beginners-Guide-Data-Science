Very good. I used an orange pineapple banana juice blend. My kids and I really liked it. I think next time, I'll add some strawberries. NOTE: This makes great healthy frozen pops, too. I just pour the smoothie mixture into dixie cups and stick in the freezer and when the mixture has firmed up, I stick in a popsicle stick.

I replaced the orange juice with fat-free vanilla yogurt and it was much better. The juice made it too tart; this is much tastier as a creamy smoothie than a juicy smoothie.

I substituted half of the orange juice for vanilla-flavored soy milk.  I had bananas, but they were not frozen.  So, I added  1 cup of crushed ice.  When this was blended with the rest of the ingredients I had a very cold, creamy, tasty smoothie.  Thanks for this great recipe!

YUM!  I made this every morning this past week for breakfast.  I need to go restock my ingredients because I have no plans to stop now! Just a hint to those who are rushed in the morning - take time to rinse your blender and your glasses right away otherwise the blueberries make a hard to clean mess if you wait!  Thanks so much for this great healthy recipe.  I already feel more energetic with this healthy start to my day.

I am a new vegetarian, and an avid smoothie fan. I didn't think much could compete with the recipes in the Super Smoothies book, but this particular one has a lot of them beat. The only pre prep is making sure you freeze your fruit. I did make mine with the honey, vanilla, and vanilla soy milk, it was outstanding!!

Made this as directed (with no vanilla)…at first.  But Hubs found this not very “purple-y,” and also missed the creaminess of similar drinks. So as written, this was only average for him - not a big hit.  Once I added more blueberries, some vanilla yogurt and a little milk, however, it was much improved, at least for him.

This was wonderful!  However, I used mixed fruit instead of just blueberries.  What a GREAT healthy way to satisfy a sweet craving.  I also threw in a little crushed ice as well.

Very tasty! I used 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup soy milk and 1/2 cup plain yogurt. The consistency was perfect - not too thick and not too thin.

Delicious and great for breakfast! I cut the recipe in half and used  did use 1/4 cup fat free vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup of OJ and added the optional honey.  I do think the creaminess of the yogurt did make this a lot better.

First time I ever made a smoothy, and it was great.  I followed the suggestion to use yogurt instead of oj.  I made half the recipe, so I used a 6 oz. vanilla lite, one bannana, 1/4 c blueberries and about 1/2 c milk.  It was thick and delicious.  No need for honey or vanilla.  It made two 8 oz. servings.

One of our new favorite.  Great afternoon summertime snack for my kids.  I didn't have any milk on this particular day, so I love that this used orange juice instead.  I did used the optional honey, but not the vanilla.  Very refreshing drink that would work well with breakfast, too.

This smoothie is great. It is so thick and rich that it can easily be used as a substitute for the more fattening milkshake.

Very good, not too sweet, not too tart. I did use a full cup of blueberries. I loved the flavors and thought that the banana gave a creaminess without using milk/yogurt/dairy!

I love this recipe exactly as written since I prefer an all fruit smoothie. I cut this down to one serving and use my immersible blender so I don't have to clean the stand blender. Thanks for posting this great recipe!

I have been making a similar version of this for years.  This was very good after a few small adjustments to make it a bit healthier!  I used organic Agave instead of honey.  I also added 1/2 scoop of vanilla soy protein instead of vanilla.  Lastly, I added 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed.

I used the milk shake, honey, and vanilla with the blueberries and bananas. It tasted like a milk shake, mainly like a banana one with mild blueberry tart. I can't really place what it'd taste like with the orange juice...I'll just have to try it.

Very good!  I replaced the OJ with Vanilla soy milk. I went with the optional honey but left out the vanilla extract.  Will def. make this again.

I am so happy to see a blueberry/banana smoothie that doesn't involve milk/yogurt!  I chose to add applesauce (natural, without sugar kind).  I used OJ to help the mix be more fluid, but used less than called for b/c of the applesauce.  Definitly not too tangy!  I used the optional honey and honestly though it ended up just a tad too sweet - will lessen next time.  I had the vanilla on standby in case it needed more flavor, but didn't end up using it.

This smoothie is very yummy and also really pretty!

Amazingly good! I didn't have OJ so I added a 6oz container of Strawberry yogurt and a 1/2 c. Berry juice. My bananas weren't frozen so I also added 1 c. ice. Will definitely make again!!

I gave it 4 stars for how it is written, however, I added buttermilk to cut the tartness a bit and this went from a 4 to a 5.  Even my husband, who is a picky eater, loved it like this.  Don't even get me started on my 3 yr old son.  He drained his glass and then told me his tummy hurt cause he drank his smoothie to fast.

This recipe is excellent as written, although it is actually a "freeze" rather than a smoothie.  Great for a hot summer day.  I actually tried adding some vanilla yogurt, but that ruined it - next time, no yogurt!  (Make sure you peel the bananas before freezing them - it's really hard to get the peel off).  I added the 1 Tb honey, but no vanilla needed.

I find that bananas are too sweet for me. I make a smoothie every morning using a frozen organic berry mix, skim milk, organic unsweetened yogurt(good bacteria), unsweetened organic cranberry juice(liver cleansing)with a few drops of the natural sweetener Stevia(no calories). Ive always been a breakfast skipper but this gives you fruit, and protein and steadies my blood sugar.

We love this! We've made it for our grandkids, who love it as well! For the kids we substituted frozen mixed berries (blueberry/blackberry/strawberry/ raspberry), and it was great! It will be a regular summer treat at our house, especially when we come in from the pool!

We double the liquid in this, using water mostly to cut costs.  We double the fruit, often using 1/2 strawberries as well.  We also add a handful of SPINACH!  Yes, spinach, you cannot taste or see it, the color stays purple (or really dark rusty red if you use strawberries) and it gets some greens into us painfully as we never get any otherwise.  Whole family loves it, even knowing there's spinach in it.  If you double the fruit and use frozen strawberries as well, you don't need to freeze the bananas.  Edited to add:  Obviously I meant it's a *painless* way to get some greens in.  LOL.

Awesome. We needed to make 6 servings, so instead of changing the ingredients, I added about 1/2 a cup of vanilla and 1 extra banana. Made it really smooth and took the edge off the bite of the oj and blueberries. Good smoothie!

Very yummy! I replaced the 1 cup oj for 1/2 cup blackberry yogurt and 1/2 cup milk.  I also used mixed berries instead of blueberries. It was still purple! I reduced the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon and added the tablespoon honey. I also added 4 ice cubes as my bananas weren't quite frozen.  This only made two 8-12 oz servings.

This is g-r-r-r-r-reat!  I made this with the soy milk, honey and vanilla.  Even my picky 14 yr. old son liked this.  We had this for a quick on the go breakfast and also for dessert.  It is like a very thick ice cream shake, but good for you!  I have made this over and over again since I tried it.   We love it, thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I have tried quite a few smoothie recipes on this site and this one was great! I did add the optional vanilla extract and for the optional honey I just added one packet of Truvia. I liked that it had no dairy products as I don't always have yogurt in the house. This is probably the first smoothie, I can say, I didn't modify or need to add ice cubes to either. The only thing is the recipe indicates 5 servings. I was able to get 3 very small or 2 average sized servings. Either way, I will definitely make this again as I always have frozen bananas & blueberries in the freezer. Thank you submitter.

after reading the comments i decided to replace the orange juice with fat free vanilla yogurt. the thickness of the smoothie proved the necessity of the liquid to me! it was delicious, but as i was cleaning out the blender it had more of a cake batter consistency than smoothie. next time i make it i'm going to use one half yogurt/one half milk to replace the orange juice.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a tad bit to sweet so I then added 1/2 cup of yogurt. Perfect! THe taste is outstanding but I do prefer thicker smoothies...but I will continue to make this. GREAT!!

Veryy delicious! I used Dole's frozen mixed fruit and strawberry yogurt, and then added a bit of honey to taste. Very easy to make!! Very smooth and creamy.

This was pretty good. I didn't have any orange juice so I took the submitter's advice and used soy milk instead. It seemed a little bland, I think it could use some freshly ground nutmeg.

I have to say, I have made MANY unsuccessful smoothies in my time, but this one was SOO good and didn't even taste that healthy (even though it is)! The only thing I did was switch out the orange juice with milk. SO good! I will probably add some spinach in the future for extra health since you can't taste it. Yummy!

I had some blueberries to use along with some Silk Vanilla Light Soy, and this looked yummy!  I cut the recipe in half and as mentioned, used the soy instead of the juice.  Left out the honey as I didn't feel it was needed.  Satisfying and very good!

really easy to make and super delicious! the only tip i have is to peel your bananas the night before and freeze them without the peels. otherwise they're difficult to get off. i also didn't freeze the blueberries and it didn't seem to matter. very yummy! i will make this again and again for breakfast

I first fill my blender loosely with fresh spinach, blend with orange juice, then add sliced pieces of 1 frozen banana and 1/2 to 1 c blueberries.  It's purple, and there is absolutely no taste of spinach!

I modified this recipe a bit based on other reviews and my fridge :-)
I used 2 bananas, not frozen, about 1 cup of frozen blueberries, 1 cup of blueberry yoghurt (didn't have juice, but yoghurt), vanilla and 2 tablespoons oat meal.
This was my busy mom's (of an even busier toddler) lunch ;-) Now I have a new way of getting rid of dark bananas instead of muffins :-D
Thanks for the inspiration!

LOVE it! My three year old and I are drinking it at this very moment (she's on her second cup). I used the almond vanilla milk and added extra blueberries and a little extra honey because I like sweet things. This one is a keeper! Thank you for posting this!

Excellent!  I made this exactly as written - I didn't even see the comment about the milk & doubt I'd like it as well.  With 2 bananas I was afraid it might get overwhelming, but it was very subtle.  I'm sure the juice contributed to that a lot.  (Though I made another one that had a lot of juice that couldn't cover up some overwhelming banana flavor.  So perhaps the honey and even vanilla contributed to that.)  I don't mind (and in fact like) a little tartness, but I think I'd also like adding some vanilla yogurt.  I always have all this stuff on hand and it mixes up smoothly easily enough, which are always plus's.  Definintely going into the smoothie rotation!  (However, absolutely not 5 servings.)

This was delicious and my kids all loved it as a fun after school treat.  Being the Halloween season I renamed it the purple monster.  They were begging for more.  In this case they were tricked (because it's healthy) and got the treat.

I just made this for myself and my kids for an afternoon snack. I found it to be way too strong of a banana flavor for my taste. I guess because of the color in the picture, I expected more of a blueberry flavor. Next time, I will use 1/2 a frozen banana and double the blueberries. I used milk in place of orange juice, mainly for my kids.

The orange juice I used was very tart and gave the whole smoothie a tart flavor. Fine by me, but if that isn't something that you like, I would be sure the orange juice had a sweet flavor.  I also added about 3 scoops of icecream. That way there was enough for three people and I perfer the thicker texture.

Very tasty and refreshing! I used milk instead of orange juice, omitted the honey and added a tbsp of vanilla protein powder.  Surprisingly, I really liked the vanilla flavor with the blueberries!  Will try again with juice next time.  Thanks!

I love this smoothie.  I did make a few changes, but nothing major.  I left out the honey and added vanilla soy protien instead of liquid.  I also added flax seed.  It was really good and leaves a pleasant aftertaste.  I will be making this again!  Thanks!

I made it for kids and 2 of the 3 said they liked it, but did not finish their small glass-fulls. The one that didn't like at all, loves most smoothies, but said it tasted like "grape bubblegum", Actually it did have a "grapy flavor" IMO also, but that was not a bad thing for me! Considering all the antioxidents in this, I will make again for a breakfast drink but will add milk or yogurt to add a little creamieness, and ice to make it more of an "icy".

I had to give this a lower rating because I did not care for the orange juice in the original recipe. However, once I had it with the fat free vanilla yogurt, I was hooked. I serve this at least twice a month to my non fruit or anything health-food-y eating husband. Other than the juice, the recipe is 100% perfect, including the honey and vanilla. My daughter does not care for the texture of the fruit, so I make hers with peanut butter and chocolate syrup. It's still better than a milkshake, and has the protein from the peanut butter,

Very good.  Added honey, but skipped the vanilla.  I should have doubled the recipe because it was gone with a few minutes of serving it!

Very good, but I'd change a few things: Honey is nasty, and takes away the bite of the oj; forget it. Vanilla doesn't add much. Forget it too. Add more blueberries...it's the purple monstrosity, not the mauve with purple chunks monstrosity. I'd make it again with these alterations.

yummy! refreshing, I used cranberry juice is stead of orange juice.
and I used fresh blueberries. When my banana get ripe I pull skin off of them put them into a gallon bag and freeze them. then they are handy for Smoothies, banana bread, cakes exc. happy cooking!

we have been experimenting with smoothies for days,  and this one is the first one my kids love. Even my picky 10 year old who fought me on tasting it wanted one for herself. thank you for this recipe, I will try to sneak in flax seed powder and/or  green vitamin powder.

I love this recipe.  I made it twice this week, once with vanilla and once without, and I think I prefer it without.  I like the fact that this smoothie doesn’t call for yogurt or any dairy products.  Also didn’t know that bananas could be frozen.  I was leery about that but found that the banana froze nicely, no browning.  It was easy to cut the banana peel with a knife.  Wish I had this recipe when a friend gave me tons of bananas last spring.

It didn't as much as I thought it would, but we both got a taste. Thought the banana overpowered. I'll stick to other smoothie recipes we've found on this site.

Just the perfect smoothie that I was craving. I tried it both ways, one with the orange juice and one with milk. I felt it really needy the acidity of the orange juice. So the recipe is perfect

This is a wonderful smoothie!  I did take advise from others.  I substituted with 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 low fat vanilla yogurt.  I also left the honey out and added a few ice cubes.  Yummm! Thanks Michelle!!

A bit too banana-y for me, I guess I was expecting a more fruity flavor.  It was a bit bitsy for me as well--the blueberry skins were kinda hard.  Might have been the brand I used.  The texture was good and tasted ok for what I wasnt expecting.

I used unsweetened soya milk instead of juice, and it still turned out scrummy. My 8 yr old daughter like it too. It blended into a glorious mauve purple, but after a little while it went brown. I think this was because I didn't use frozen fruit, which I will try next time! Thank you!

Very very good - but I had to toss in some milk to cut down the intensity - but overall very good!

I always throw my "over ripe" bananas in the freezer just for smoothies.  Unfortunately, someone in my house used up the rest of them so I used 2 regular bananas which were not "over ripe" (the best for smoothies) and had no orange juice so I replaced with 1/2 plain yogurt and half vanilla flavored almond milk and everything else the same. Since I had no frozen bananas, I did add a few ice cubes to cool it.  Next time I made it, I added more fresh blueberries, "black" frozen bananas and the same plain yogurt, almond milk, more vanilla and a bit more honey to feed my big eating family and they ALL LOVED IT!!  Thanks for the recipe, it inspired me and the consistency was perfect.

I am rating this on my personal adjustments and the outcome in flavor. I always read reviews first and use the most frequent that suit my personal taste. In this case, I added a few healthy options (since I make these for my children) which are: hemp protein powder, wheat germ & brewer's yeast). The other additions were strawberry yogurt and a little milk. For me, this was an outstanding smoothie recipe, and I usually do not like smoothies! Thank you for the wonderful base, and other feedback! This is a keeper!

This smoothie was really good! I followed a few of the suggested changes and it came out great. My only suggestion would be to be aware of the serving size. When I saw this recipe I just quickly wrote it down on paper and didn't pay attention to the rest of the recipe details. First two mornings I made this it practically lasted me all morning to drink it all while at work until I realized what I was making was 5 servings!! Not exactly low-cal at that point! Nonetheless I adjusted and it was still really good.

I substituted almond milk for the orange juice and it turned out really good.  I made this recipe three times and filled a pitcher after each one.  The kids loved them, but my wife felt that it had too much banana.

Fantastic smoothie! I have been on a smoothie kick lately and downloaded about 20 other smoothie recipes and this is my favorite by far! The orange juice does make if a little tart so I added a 1/2 cup of cold drinking water and added an additional 1/2 tablespoon of honey. It tastes like heaven. Thanks for sharing.

This smoothie was pretty good. I am a college student with a limited budget, so I made a few changes...I used fat free milk instead of OJ, didn't freeze my fruit (because of time), and, as silly as it sounds, instead of regular honey I used KFC honey sauce packets! It tasted pretty good, but I might use ice cubes next time so that it is colder.

Used some orange juice, some milk.  It was tasty!  Was a little tart for my mood so will try it with the yogurt next time as recommended.  I *love* blueberries and bananas so this was a nice breakfast. :D

I absolutely love this recipe. I am a sweet freak & this is a healthy option to ice cream. I usually add soy milk & use whatever frozen fruit I have in the freezer.

I just started getting "into" smoothies and this was exactly what I was looking for...great consistancy and taste. Thanks Michelle!
