I had heard of grilled pizza but was afraid to try it. It's quite a production, that after 4 times in 4 weeks, we've got down to a science. The first time he made it he burnt most of the crusts. It definitely helps to have two people working together. I didn't make the crust. I used frozen dough balls from Sams Club thawed, cut in half, and rolled out thin to fit the grill shape. 2 dough balls will give you 4 nice sized pizzas. I also precooked the toppings because you can't let it on long enough to cook them. I use finely shredded cheese because it melts faster. Ragu pizza sauce tastes great. He sprays the grill with a little pam before putting crust on. Husband said we'll never go back to baking them in the oven, even during the winter.  You've got to try this one!

We have been making this pizza on our gas grill since last summer and have not cooked one in the oven since! Even though it's winter. My husband just rolls up the garage door and cooks! For those that had trouble, keep working at it. Grill med. hot, put the dough on a sheet of aluminum foil dusted with flour so two people can flip it right on the grill. Slick. I have been baking home made breads and pizza dough for over 30 years so maybe that is why I had no trouble. I don't know but what I do know is we LOVE THIS PIZZA! thanks for this keeper!

Oh my goodness, is this ever a fabulous way to make homemade pizza!  I'm a novice and this was the best I've ever made.  I was scared to try it; what if the dough dropped through the grill, etc etc etc?!  But it didn't.  Held together beautifully.  Just follow the instructions that Doug has laid out, and you'll succeed!  I did divide my dough into quarters rather than in half so I could have smaller pizzas with varying toppings.  Be sure to wait until the dough "puffs" before turning it over; I made them one at a time and actually turned each one over onto a pizza pan to add my toppings. Be sure to have all of your stuff organized and ready to go!  Pizza 1: pesto, mozzarella/fontina/parmesan, fresh tomatoes; Pizza 2: jarred red sauce/Italian seasoned sausage/mushrooms/black olives/mozzarella (I made this one double the size of the other two); Pizza 3: jarred red sauce, carmelized onions, mozzarella/fontina/parmesan.  All three were great. I rolled the crust out thin and it was wonderfully done on the top and bottom, and crisp on the outside, chewy inside.  For a homemade pizza, it's the next best thing to brick oven pizza.  I doubled the dough and froze half. You gotta try this method! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe, Doug!

My dad & I made this together and we had such a great time! We rolled our crusts very thin and made 1 Margherita style with mozzarella, parmesean & fresh basil, the other was pineapple rings & ham. We made the sauce with olive oil, fresh garlic, 4 tomatoes & 1/2 an onion. We simmered it in a pan and added salt & fresh basil before topping the pizzas with it.  We're making these again today for our house warming party!

What a great & different way to have pizza! Used floured aluminum foil trick mentioned in previous review and worked great. Kept grill at 250-300 degrees to keep from burning. After flipping, brushed crust w/ garlic-infused oil and topped w/ thin tomato slices, fresh basil & fresh mozzarella slices. Excellent!

I loved the flavor of the crust, but I made the pizza twice and both times the crust was tough and chewy. I had never made pizza dough before. My first time to use yeast. Could someone please respond here to let me know what I did wrong? I had trouble with the proofing. It took longer than 10 minutes to proof. Maybe old yeast? I used regular salt not kosher, dried basil not fresh, but I think everything else was the same. I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!

I started grilling pizzas last summer after watching it on FoodTV.  A trick we use is to grill the crusts quickly on a hot grill (about 400F), then flip them over so the cooked side is facing up onto a cooking sheet.  We then bring the pizzas inside the house so that our teenagers and their friends can make their own pizzas using an assortment of toppings.  As each pizza is created, we bring it back outside and finish cooking the pizza, with the uncooked side down on the grill.  This time, we cook it on a lower heat (about 300F) so insure the cheese melts without the crusts burnning.  We've tried putting toppings on the pizza on the grill, but it's just oo darn hot that way.  Bringing them inside allow us time to make each pizza the way we want to.

This was wonderful!  The wonderful "outdoors" taste that the grill imparts to the pizza truely elevates it to the next level!  Cooks very quickly-  I pulled mine off the grill and onto a baking sheet while assembling the toppings.  Make sure you knock your coals down so it cooks on a lower heat, and evenly.

great, very easy...  especially for those hot days when you don't want to turn on the oven!!!  Be careful not to get the grill too hot, you might burn the 'crust' before the cheese is melted.

OH MY GOSH, I loved this.  I will never make another kind of pizza again!  The crust is so wonderful and it is not that hard to do.  It tastes like a pizza you would order from an italian restaurant!  YOU MUST TRY IT!

i tried this recipe...be warned!

if you're using a gas grill, turn the heat down to low or just below medium before placing the dough on the grill. otherwise you'll get what i got: black burned dough in less than 30 seconds.

i also experienced uneven cooking on the dough, parts of it barely browned, while other parts got black very fast.

this recipe does not say anything about reducing heat.

learn from my mistake, not yours.

I tried this for the first time and learned some things that work best with my gas grill. 1.  Do not use the foil and flour as some suggest, the flour burns and the pizza sticks.  Just spray some oil on the grill prior to use. 2.  200-250 temp and indirect heat works best to allow time for the cheese to fully melt. 3.  Smaller pizzas are easier to work with. Very quick and fun meal.

Great way to do pizza and perfect for nights when it's too hot to heat up the oven! I used "Pasta/Pizza Sauce" from this site and for the toppings I used grilled sausage, fresh tomatoes, and fresh basil. Absolutely fabulous without a lot of effort and great with a nice glass of wine!

What a great recipe!  We have made this several times and have perfected it!  Before putting on the grill, i place the piece of dough on a greased piece of aluminum foil and roll it out.  We then put the dough on the grill, grill one side, bring back inside and put our toppings on the grilled side and grill again!  We have this every weekend.  The dough is totally awesome!  Perfect perfect perfect!  10 stars!!!

I attempted this using my bread machine and it worked out fabulously well.  In order, I put in the warm water, 1T olive oil, flour, active dry yeast, sugar, and kosher salt and ran it under the dough setting.  Once it was done, I kneaded it for about 4 minutes and added the basil and garlic as the recipe called for,  then put it in a bowl with about 1 T of olive oil and let it double.  I was then able to create 3 small pizzas (good personal size).  I just had to stay outside while it cooked to make sure it wouldn't get too dark on the grill.  Worked out fabulously.  Grilled on one side first, then flipped over and put a little of the garlic/olive oil over it, then added the tomato sauce and toppings.  To get the cheese melted, I covered it for only a couple of minutes until I felt it was okay and moved the crust around so it wasn't in any direct flames.  I may have to always use this method from now on, the crust flavor is wonderful!!

Amazing! My first time making on the grill...best homemade pizza I've ever had.  Tweaked sauce and toppings to our liking...the dough was perfect.  Used non-stick foil and had zero problems with flipping or burning.  A regular in my house now!!!

This is my new favorite recipe and has gone into regular rotation in my house.  I read some reviews and made some changes.    I cut the dough into 4 small pizzas and cook them two at a time on the grill.  They are easier to manuver and flip, and also we can make four different kinds of pizzas.    I brush both sides of the crust with the garlic oil instead of the grill.  Shape the dough, brush the top with oil, flip it upside down and brush the new top with the oil, let it cook, flip it, then put the toppings on.  My husband and I have it down to a science now.    I have made the crust in my bread machine as well as by hand.  I have made it as written and have left out the garlic and basil in the dough.  I have substituted 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour.  It comes out beautifully each time.    Thank you for this recipe.  I think it is the best pizza I've ever had!

We had ours with leftover homemade tomato sauce, mozzerella cheese and pepperoni. Really good. Had a different taste than pizza I'm used to. One tip: Keep the pizzas small or else they will fall apart!

Amazing!!! Have made it twice in three days.  Used a large dough from the local pizzeria and made two.  Rolled dough thin and sprayed Pam with olive oil on top and seasoned.  Placed on a piece of foil and used Pam and seasoning on other side.  Flipped onto the oiled grill which was at 350  and removed foil.  Cooked  until the bottom started to brown to, about four minutes and then used tongs to place cooked side up on a cutting board.  Put sauce and cheese and toppings on and then slid onto the grill from the cutting board.  Cooked for about another four minutes.  The best pizza.  Made the second one with pesto, roasted peppers , artichoke hearts and cheese.  This is a keeper!!!!

Very easy to do and is so delicious!  I make up a few batches of the dough and freeze them for later.  This recipe is great for making taco pizza too.  Just omit the basil and garlic and add taco seasoning.  We've noticed that closing the lid on the grill helps the cheese to melt faster and saves us from burning our pizza or using the oven to melt the cheese.  Everytime we've made it for someone new they look at us funny when we make the pizza on the grill but once they taste it they are hooked!

Grilled pizza is the best. I make one at least once a week. I pick fresh dough up at a local bakery and top it with all types of toppings. Once you learn the best way to handle the dough on the grill it's not difficult at all. If you have a pizza peel that you can spead out the dough with olive oil brushed on it, and just flip onto the oiled grill the rest is a breeze. We preheat the gas grill to 450-500 than turn it down once the dough goes on. It will puff up and get bubbly, filp put your toppings on ( go light with them and precook any meat such as sausage)close the cover of your grill to let the cheese melt. What you end up with is a crusty and chewy crust that is better than anything out of your oven.

I give this a recipe 5 stars because it is the best tasting pizza there is - my husband agrees! Although, I did have to put it under my oven broiler because the cheese wasn't melting and the crust was cooking too fast. I cheated and used my bread machine to make the dough. I had to substitute with fresh oregano (a little less than called for). I added the garlic and oregano last to the bread machine pan. I used a different sauce than the one in the recipe, and we used our own combination of toppings. Next time I will substitute 1 cup of beer in place of the 1 cup water - as another pizza dough recipe I have calls for.

Wonderful pizza! The crust was nice and crispy. The grill was a little too hot-medium heat would be better. I took the pizza off of the grill to add toppings so I wasn't so rushed. Will also sprinkle crust with a little cornmeal next time.  Very easy and quick meal.

The dough is one I've been using for years, but I add dried oregano and basil as well as the garlic, then just spread a little regular tomato sauce on the crust when it is time to top it. No need to use a jarred sauce.  I also double the recipe...which makes 5 pizzas. I use about a square foot of reynolds heavy duty non stick foil per pizza. No need for oil or flour on the foil it will just slide right off when its cooked.  I didn't really want the grill marks, I just didn't want to heat up my house. I didn't heat the grill on high. I got it up to about 250 degrees, and when it was done on one side I slid the foil onto a platter and took it in the house to flip and pile toppings on. I probably had it on for about 8 min. on the first side.  I piled on the toppings, and let it stay on prob another 8 min or so until the cheese was melted.  Having it on medium the whole time made sure the pizza was cooked all the way through and everything got melted together.  I was a little concerned about the pizza dough being to thin.  If you want thin crust make sure to practically be able to see through it, because it will puff up alot....but my family loves a thicker crust.

YUM! What a great way to make pizza even better! I have made this three times already since the start of the grilling season. The dough tastes so much better when it's grilled. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Love this.  I will not ever make a different pizza again.  We have changed the recipe a lot in the topping area.  We use apples, onions, lots of garlic, and other things.  The dough is awesome, and cooks perfectly on the grill.

This pizza is superb. Yes Superb.  All the herbs were great.  Nothing needed to be changed.  Make sure you have four hands available when putting all the toppings on the pizza.  YUMMY!

I didn't think this recipe was outrageously magnificient, I decide to use it on the stove with a grill skillet and it burned the crust a bit. SO with the 2nd part of the dough thenext day I made it in the oven and made it a circular pizza instead of rectangular, i used red onions instead of the roasted peppers. and it was a lot better in my opinion, I think its too much with the fresh tomatoes plus the roasted red peppers, just too sweet. I used oregano instead of fresh basil on top of pizza. The crust is a WONDERFUL recipe anmd will defintaley use it again. Overall with my way it was spectacular.

I haven't tried this specific recipe, but I have hosted many grilled pizza parties. I highly recommend it. It's lots of fun, just let everyone roll out their own dough, and set out lots of toppings for everyone to create their own masterpieces. (I always have a tomato sauce and a white garlic sauce plus chicken, pepperoni, cooked sausage, cooked onions, peppers, mushrooms and fresh spinach and arugala. Plus fresh and grated mozzarella and sprinkle on spices.) Everyone loves comparing notes, tasting other's concoctions. 

I am writing this to add a tip. You do not have to top the pizzas on the grill. Once you have grilled the bottom half, you can remove it from the grill, place uncooked side down (it has had enough heat that it doesn't stick anymore) and put all your toppings on the grilled side. Return to the grill to (uncooked side down, of course) finish when you are ready and have space on the grill. No burned fingers, better grill management.  Enjoy!

AMAZING! Didn't have a chance to make my own dough and bought the one I love at Trader Joe's (I like it better than the Whole Foods one which is breadier).  Amazing how quick this turns out something fabulous. The garlic still tasted raw to me, so I saute it on the stove with the olive oil for a few minutes to infuse the oil now. I brush both sides of the crust and then top it with some tomato sauce (also love Trader Joe's pizza sauce) and fresh grated parmesan cheese before piling on shredded mozzarella, tomatoes and feta cheese.  I also put some onions on and the sliced garlic for the hubby (on his side of the pizza).  This is fantastic and is a real crowd amazer, I can't believe that crust doesn't stick to the grill, but it doesn't!  When I first made it and cut it with the pizza wheel, I got sooooo excited when I heard that crunch.  Unbelievable!

I regularly make this for my friends and family. We sit outside, everyone rolls out their own dough and then picks their toppings.  I regularly have pesto, red sauce, sausage, peperoni, chicken, bacon, mushrooms, carmelized onions, sundried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, different olives, parmesan, goat cheese, feta, mozzerella and more!! Add some wine and the night is complete!!

I only used the Dough and Technique from this recipe.  But isn't that the fun of cooking - Winging it with what's on hand?  
The technique for grilling worked well on our Charcoal grill.  Just control the air flow to the coals.  You want it hot, but not nucular meltdown.  For ease of use our first time out, we made 4 small pizzas rather than the 2 larger ones.  The first two we cooked were a little thicker and didn't turn out as nice as the second batch that I made a touch thinner.  Moving them off the grill to add the toppings helped a lot.  Also turning the dough to avoid hot spots and evenly cook is advised.  This isn't an item you can walk away from while it is cooking.  But the cooking is so quick you won't feel like a slave.

Oh my! Thanks for all the other reviews, I took them into consideration and this turned out fantastic on my first try. I'm not a big fan of olives so I substituted crisped prosciutto for the salty element. Fresh basil and tomatoes from the garden. After it was cooked, drizzled with a tiny bit of aged balsamic vinegar. I feel like a grill master!

Wow!!! Our Sunday night tradition for years has been to make a whole wheat crust pizza.  I've tried many recipes and finally bought a pizza stone.  Never has it come out the same way twice.  The pizza stone in the oven helped with the crunchiness. So that was improvement.  Then I said why waste the beautiful weather and my gas grill?  Found this recipe and used about 4 cups whole wheat flour, 1 T yeast, 1/2 tsp sugar and almost 2 cups water in my bread machine. I eyeballed the consistency so it held together well but was still sticky, letting the machine mix for 8 minutes.  Let it go through two rises, fired up the grill, and away we went!  The only thing I'd do differently next time is make two small pizzas instead of one mega rectangle. Don't know what I was thinking - it was a challenge to work with!  But I convinced it to work, hubby helped me with the first flip so we were ok.  We put onions, green peppers, mushrooms, and I had pepperoni on my side.  Sooooo good.  I can predict that we will be spending future Sundays overt the grill, weather whatever!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I made this but I think i was so afraid to burn the crusts that I did  not leave it on long enough. Also be careful to not overload the pizza. All the toppings seemed to prevent the center of the pizza from cooking through.

This just didn't work for me at all.  I brush the olive oil on the grill and the flames were huge!   Then when I put the dough on it cook so fast that is was gooey in the middle.  Just a mess.  I ended up doing the second one in the oven and it came out a lot better.

I'm never going to want to make pizza in the oven again!  This was amazing.  I didn't use the dough recipe; I used the one on the back of the pizza dough yeast package and used whole grain white flour for more nutrition.  Toppings were the same other than I used an Italian cheese mixture which added more flavor than mozzarella alone would have.  Also, we pulled the dough off the grill to put the toppings on and then set it back on the grill, away from the direct heat, to finish cooking.  I'm going to try making the Four Cheese Margherita Pizza (on this site) on the grill!

Maybe I'm just a bad pizza dough maker, but this didn't make up easily for me, at all. I had everything ready to go, but the crust was done before the pizza was, and needed to be broiled in my oven. Oh well: think I'll stick to my pizza stone....

Fantastic Recipe!  My husband and I make this weekly during the summer.  Here's a fun tip: make a little extra dough and serve breadsticks with the pizza!  Simply stretch the ready-dough into sticks about 6 inches long and a couple inches thick, and instead of folding basil into this portion of the dough- throw in some fresh Italian seasoning.  We brush on some all-natural Italian dressing while they are grilling and they come of the grill tasting great!

We loved this and it was fun.  I kept my grill on low for the first side and after flipping and quickly putting on the toppings turned gril off and closed lid for 5-10 minutes.  It was not burned.  We kept our ingredients to 2 or 3 max.  I think more would have been too much.

I made these for a my family a couple weeks ago and everyone loved them. From scratch it isn't an after work recipe. I doubled the recipe for the dough and made individual sized crusts and had them ready on a cookie sheet to take out to the grill.  I had a variety of toppings ready in a plastic vegie tray and everyone added their own toppings. I made two at a time on my gas grill.
Excellent recipe. I will definitely make again.

YUM!  Instead of making the dough I used Trader Joes whole wheat dough for one pizza and Trader Joes garlic/herb for another one.  I don't know if I'll ever make this pizza in the oven again because it's so good grilled.  The toppings don't get as crispy as in the oven, but the flavor is great.  Also I found that it helped to put the pizzas on the upper rack in our grill so they wouldn't burn.  LOW heat is necessary, for this one cooks fast.

We have used this recipe over and over again. We have thrown many Pizza on the Grill parties and people love the idea and, most of all, love the taste of pizza on the grill.  We top ours differently, even using traditional pepperoni or olives and mushrooms.  One time, I grilled mushrooms, onions and green peppers and topped it with that for a delicious veggie version.  Use any topping you like -- this is a keeper!

Soooo good! We tried making the dough and it did not work so well...not sure what went wrong...we bought premade dough from Trader Joes (strongly recommended if you have a Trader Joes). You can easily kneed in the garlic and basil to premade dough.  We made our pizza Margarita style (fresh mozerella and tomatoes). YUM YUM YUM!

this was excellent. I followed others advice and used aluminum foil. I was to afraid to try it bare on the grill, I didn't want it to burn. I used fresh mozzerella and fresh basil and pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce. My husband and toddler loved it!!

Great Recipe!  We took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and made 3 or 4 smaller crusts (makes it easier to flip the crusts).  We also cooked on a low temp setting on the BBQ and cooked our crusts on top of tinfoil, rather than directly on the grates of the BBQ. We didn't rub olive oil on the crusts, and they turned out fine.  You do want to work quickly when putting on the toppings, having everything ready to go. We pre-cooked most of our toppings, which we highly recommend as it doesn't take the crust long to cook.  We used homemade pizza sauce, pre-shredded mozzarella, pre-cooked chicken (cubed), raw spinach leaves, fresh basil leaves, and caramelized onions/garlic. Thanks for a great recipe, Doug!

I've made this 3 times now.  It is always a hit with my family.  I find the recipe made by hand results in a thin crust pizza, as it is not warm enough to cause the dough to rise enough.  A thick crust is achieved by using the bread machine.  Both are good; the thin crust seems to be firmer if you wish to eat it with your hands.  My son and I are allergic to cheese and usually use a ranch flavoured salad dressing made with blended cashews as a substitute (yummy!).

A suggestion that I have that we do to help keep the crust from burning is to use a baking stone. It also helps the cheese and toppings cook more even without worry of burning the crust. We do this for my kids highschool friends and they loveit. They get way too much bad pizza:)

This tasted great - but you definitely have to be well organized to make it work! Building the pizza on the grill after it was flipped was a bit difficult, but the end result was really good and fresh!

This was great, I made smaller pizzas and I let my family make their own pizza with toppings. This pizza dinner was so much fun with the family on the patio. Thank you.

this recipe is wonderful! i, too, was somewhat scared of pizza on the grill...but followed some of the tips (aluminum foil, 2 spatulas, and have everything prepped and ready to go) and it was deliciously successful!  best pizza we have made at home and we will NOT go back to using the oven/pizza stone.  this is the closest to a wood oven taste you can get a home i think!  thanks!!

We've been grilling pizzas for a year now. I make my dough in my bread machine....I use 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour and one cup whole wheat flour to pump up the nutrition. I also discovered a tbl. of poppy seed in the dough makes it deliciously chewy and even tastier!  We have not had a commercially-prepared pizza...frozen or restaurant...in over a year. Homemade is the healthy way to enjoy pizza! And we make individual pizzas to grill so he can have meat and cheese and I can have a vegan pizza. Everybody's happy!

This was absolutely delicious!  I let my KitchenAid mixer and bread hook do the kneading.  I kept it in my mixing bowl, covered it loosely with saran rather than the damp towel that was suggested,  and set it in a warm spot.   After the first hour, it didn't seem to have risen at all and I was nervous I had added too much flour, but I punched it down anyway and let it sit for an hour again.  It seemed lighter after the second rising.  I quartered the dough and stretched-patted-pulled them into 4 good-sized individual pizzas.  Lightly brushed my grill with olive oil, kept the temp around 300 and they were perfect!!  I had watched the video tutorial and that made the process less intimidating for the first time!  Our "Family Friday Night Pizza Night" will now include grilled pizza! Everyone loved them!

I used the recipe for the dough, but it is really good. It takes a while to make, but if you have the time, I highly recommend making the dough from scratch. It's way better than frozen dough balls. My husband's favorite pizza is Hawaiian Barbecue, so we threw some barbecue sauce, sliced chicken breast, red onions, and pineapple chunks with some mozzarella cheese on top. One of the crusts got a little burnt, but with practice this will be an excellent and fun dinner choice. Even the slightly burnt pizza was delicious!

Very good! This was really fun to make and I rolled my dough as thinly as I could so it cooked VERY quickly 2-3 minutes per side over low heat and got SO CRISPY! It was such a great thin crust...almost like a cracker. I also divided my dough in half and made two smaller pizzas so that it was easier to flip with a spatula underneath and tongs on top to guide it. I did accidently drop one of my pizzas back onto the grate while flipping which then made for 2 individual sized pizzas.  I piled on sauce, as many pepperoni & sausage bits as I could fit and then covered the top in thinly shredded pizza cheese. The only sad thing was that the cheese didn't melt all the way before I needed to take the pizza off...but it smelled & tasted great!

It is REALLY hard to order pizza delivery now knowing that we can make such better pizzas at home. After trying this I am convinced there is no other way a pizza should be cooked at home. Sooo good. I have even bought the already made pizza crusts and used the grill for a birthday party. Kids loved being able to add their toppings and watch it bake. Thank you!

EXCELLANT!! This is a good basic recipe that you can do a lot with. It does take a little work and time. You have to start this recipe about 2 hours and 15 minutes before you intend to eat so the dough can rise. But once it hits the grill you better be ready to work fast. I precooked all of my ingredients so I would avoid burning the crust (update: be sure not to burn the crust, just cook till it is brown and cheese is melted) waiting for them all to heat up on the grill. I also just put my tomatoes in a frying pan with a little water and cooked them down a little instead of using the tomatoe sauce. I also added chicken. GREAT RECIPE I can't wait to try some more different things on it!!

This was fabulous.  It was my first time trying pizza on the grill.  I didn't have all the topping ingredients in the recipe, so I used what I had.  I also divided the dough into 3 pizzas to make it easier to handle.  I used foil on the grill as some others had suggested.  This was a definite hit and will be going into my regular menu planning!

I am a big fan of the grilled pizzas, but like some other people I definitely had trouble keeping the bottoms of the crusts from burning at first.  I brush olive oil on the grates, get the grill as hot as I can, par-bake the dough, throw the toppings on and slide the pizza to the side and off the flames, keeping the grill as hot as possible, but the pizza away from the flames is key to melting the cheese & cooking toppings while not burning the bottom of your crust.

I too changed a few things to make it even better and easier. After the dough has risen and you punch it down,I make 4 dough sections and roll them out personal pizza size and let them sit on a lightly floured cookie sheet for at least 15 mins.  This allows the dough to rest and relax. Then put them on the grill as the recipe says to (the dough will be even more elastic and probably will stretch out more but believe me, this will make the crust even more delicious and crusty). The crusts will cook a bit quicker too so keep an eye on them.  I also use Prego traditional for the sauce and I too shred the cheese to help it melt a bit more. Some fresh shred parmesan mixed in with the mozerella makes it really delicious.  After the crust has cooked on the first side I also take them off the grill onto the cookie sheet again to quickly put the toppings on and then put them back on the grill. That way, you don't burn your fingers over the grill! I make a double batch of dough and after the first rising, I cut them into quarters and freeze them separately so it's easy to take them out after work and let them come to room temp, then roll them out, let them rest and dinner is ready in 9 mins. My husband loves this and we eat these once a week...at least!

The best way to handle the dough on the grill is to make personal size pizzas. I put them on a grill rack until they are cooked on one size and then put them directly on the grill. It's also a great way for everyone to have just what they want for toppings. I was able to make 4 pizzas this way. It's best to cook any veggies first.  So very good, thanks~

This was awesome. I had never made dough before, but I had no problems what so ever.  While letting it rest, I put it in my oven that I put on 170.  I used a jar of sauce instead of making it.  Cooking all to the toppings before hand is necessary.  Make sure if you use fresh mozzarella that it is cut in smaller pieces or it won't melt.  I didn't flip them either.  I let people add their own toppings and then just slid them on the grill off a pizza peel.  Finding a balance of when the crust is crisp and when the toppings are melted/warm, but  tasting the outcome, it was well worth the time spent experimenting.

I made this pizza last week on a whim.  A friend was coming for dinner and I wanted to try something new.  My husband and friend were so impressed and I must say that I was too.  I made the pizza again tonight, still following the directions as written.  I want to make it once a week this summer until I can do it in my sleep.  Last week, I think my crust was a tiny bit too thick, so I thinned it out just a bit.  The flavor of the basil and garlic in the dough is a nice touch and, Doug, your idea about cooking the dough on one side and flipping it before putting on the toppings is genius.  I'm going to have a hard time waiting a week before I make it again.  It's the best pizza I've ever had at home.  Thanks for a GRRREAT recipe!

Spectacular!  Hint: roll your dough round your rolling pin (flour the top of the dough first) to transfer to the BBQ, and then just roll it back out over the grill.  We had some stretching problems before we figured out this trick. Once the bottom of the dough has cooked (after adding toppings) you can move it to a cooler area of the grill to halt cooking of the bottom and to complete the melting/cooking of the toppings using the hot air in the BBQ.  What a great recipe :)

This recipe was great.  I used pizza dough from the grocery store.  I have made the same crust in the oven but it never tasted this good!!  My grill must be very hot because I had to really watch the crust.  I had all the ingredients ready to go so that I could put them on quickly.  I partially precooked some veggies (onion zucchinni pepper broccoli etc) in the microvave because I did not think they would cook on the grill as the dough browns very fast.  I put olive oil on a pizza pan and stretched out the dough so that is was an even thickness.  I put olive oil on both sides.  I preheated the grill and carefully put the dough on the grill. You have to watch it as it burns quickly but leave it on this side as long as you can, it helps cook the inside of the crust,  The crust gets cripsy and is easy to flip over.  Quickly put on the toppings.  I used chopped fresh tomatoes seasoned with garlic salt, basil, soft mozarella and grated cheese.  It waa the BEST!!! I used the precooked veggies to make a second veggie pizza.  I did have to turn the grill down to low and put the lid on to the melt the cheese.  The crust had some dark spots but it added to the flavor, just like brick oven. It was cripy on the out side, chewy on the inside. I will never cook a pizza in the oven again!!!

Amazingly Good!I made the dough exactly as written. Except I put in fresh basil and parmesan cheese instead of basil and garlic.This made a big difference in the flavor of the crust! So Good! For my toppings I used sweet onions, portabella mushrooms, green peppers, tomatoes and of course shredded mozzerella. I grilled all the veggies ahead of time. Watch the video before making this recipe because it shows you how to be prepared to work fast. Also make sure you grill it on low heat, as others suggested or else the dough will burn. What I loved about this pizza is the smokey flavor of the crust combined with the grilled flavor of the toppings! I can't wait to try this again, so I can try different toppings and cheeses. All the other reviewers are correct...once you have grilled pizza, you will never want oven baked again!

Amazing! This pizza will make you want to never eat frozen or oven baked again! I made mine with 2 cups of flour and 1 1/2 cups of bread flour to make the dough a little more *sturdy* for some of the heavier toppings and it worked beautifully! We made individual pizzas for everyone, including my fav - red sauce, boiled chicken, garlic, feta & japaleno :) deeelish!

I have made this recipe several times because it is awesome! Kneading the garlic and basil into the crust really adds alot of flavor. It definitely helps to close the lid on the grill once you have the toppings on, to help melt the cheese. If the crust is getting too done on the bottom and the cheese isnt melted, just stick under the broiler in your oven for a minute or two. The recipe says to keep the toppings light, but in my opinion you can't have too many!

This is excellent! I have never made bread or pizza dough, but this was simple and delicious! We kept the toppings the same and it was so flavorful.

I used my own sauce and toppings, but the recipe for the crust is amazing. I love it. I normally make a double batch and freeze the extra pizza crusts for later.

HA! I impressed my friends with this one! VERY good and the grill makes all the difference. To save me time and aggravation I bought dough from our local pizzeria cut it in half (because the whole piece was too much for me to work with)and then followed the directions in preparing it. I was then able to work with the other half of the dough while the first one cooked. Looks quite impressive also. I'll be making this again and experimenting with different toppings. Yummy...thanks for sharing!

This recipe is delicious!  My kids had some friends over for dinner so I thought this would be a fun recipe to try.  Got rave reviews!  They all said it was the best pizza they ever had!  I made the pizza dough as directed but I bought pizza sauce and then had a lot of diffent pizza toppings (pepperoni, green peppers, tomatoes, olives, and onions) to add to the pizzas.  I made 4 smaller pizzas instead of 2 bigger ones.  When cooking them I cooked the first side for a few minutes and then took them off the grill completely, let the kids make their pizza the way they wanted and then put them back on the grill to cook the other side of the crust and melt the cheese.  They loved it!!  I will be making these a lot!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is great - we've used it three times in the last 2 weeks! The dough is wonderful and very much worth the time and effort.  I make it in the AM, form the pizzas, and then keep them refrigerated until we're ready to cook them up in the evening. Thanks, Doug, for sharing your recipe.

I liked the concept of grilled pizza but wasn't crazy about this crust.  My kids didn't like the plain tomato sauce either. Next time I try it, I will use a different crust and sauce.  I think it needs to go under the broiler, but that just adds more work.

Okay, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I did use a Pillsbury pizza dough but cut it in half and stretched it thin. That turned out great. I used regular pizza sauce plus whatever we felt like eating that night. It turned out to be the best pizza, bar none. It didn't even taste like a pizza you would make at home. It was so good that I am now going to have to make it again. We made it on a charcoal grill and it turned out just fine. I would say that it does take two people to do this, though. My husband held the grill top while I used the spatulas to flip the pizza, put the ingredients on the pizza and then to take it off the grill. But it was a fun thing to do. I will definitely be making this again, probably tomorrow.

Pizza on the grill is SO easy!  I was a sceptic about it (falling through the cracks, not cooking evenly, etc.) -but it turned out great.  I did put my pizza under the broiler to really get the toppings hot without burning the crust, but that may not be necessary depending on your grill.  I will use this for a pizza night when everyone puts the toppings they want on individual pizzas.

We loved this pizza!! Be sure and flour the area that you are working with the dough! Also, if you put the oil on the grill, wait till it burns off a bit and you won't have as many flames! And don't put oil on the dough or that too will ignite flames, resulting in a blackend crust!

I had never used yeast before, so my first time making this was a little hard, but, WOW was it good after I had mastered it!!!  My husband was amazed, and my kids had fun helping me make the dough.  I've e-mailed this recipe to several friends.  It's awesome!!

The dough was great, but I had a REALLY difficult time cooking it on the grill.  It stuck to the grill )even though oiled) and didn't not cook evenly. I think next time I'll use the same recipe but cook it on a baking stone...

I really thought this was going to be difficult to do, especially the part about cooking bread on the grill, but I was surprised when it cooked just right.  The flavors are fantastic together.  Pretty neat.

Try using the pizza stone ON the grill.  Crust won't ever burn even if you have a couple of drinks while you bake.  Prep the dough on the stone until it's stiff enough to remove but not quite done. Set it aside on a workable surface and add your ingredients.  Then return it to the stone until the cheese melts. Trust me, this is a better way to do it, unless you like burned pizza. : )

The dough to this was PHENOMENAL!!  I must have eaten quite a bit as I was "testing" it for doneness right off the grill!  The garlic folded into the dough really made it stand out, and I could have just eaten crust all night.  We ended up grilling a few empty ones and cutting them into breadsticks to dip into extra marinara sauce.  Deeelish!

This is a great way to make Pizza. We halved the recipe, rolled the two resultant pizza as thinly as we could and cooked them at the same time.  We lowered the temperature on the burners to minimum under the pizza after the initial browning and once the toppings were added we relied the back burner usually only used for the rotisserie to finish the pizzas.  Fantastic results.

My husband and I have been grilling pizza for a few summers now.  We buy refrigerated dough balls and cut them in half, which gives a nice sized pizza. We roll out the dough to a shape that resembles a pizza, brush a little olive oil (not too much - it will turn your crust an unappetizing shade of gray) on one side. Remember that a thinner crust works better with grilled pizza. That side goes face-down on the grill. We grill it for a few minutes, until it is nicely browned and has grill marks on it. We then pull the crust off the grill with a pair of tongs and put the toppings on the cooked side. Remember also, that with toppings, less is more, especially sauce.  We return the crust to the grill and cook until the cheese is melted. Fantastic!!!

Awesome! I only needed 3 cups flour for the dough. Be careful to add the salt after you've added the flour or you will kill the yeast. I don't think I can eat regular baked pizza ever again! Thanks so much!

This dough is wonderful!  Even better if you make it a day before and refrigerate.  Rather than use sauce I marinate Roma tomatoes in olive oil with slivers of fresh basil and minced fresh garlic for an hour or so.  Brush the dough on top withe marinate oil, flip  that side down to cook, , brush the other side while it is cooking, flip again, brush, top with tomatoes, toppings of choice and mozzarella cheese.  Close the grill until the cheese melts.  Another tip, put the pizza stone to heat up with the grill on high then turn it down to medium when you're ready to cook.

This worked well even on my first attempt.  I only had whole wheat flour in the house and it was fine.  If you use whole wheat cut the amount of flour down to about 2.5 cups.  I sprayed nonstick cooking spray on the grill before I lit it.  I cooked the pizza on med low for fear of burning but I'll probably turn it up a little next time.  Super Duper and with 100% organic non gmo whole wheat!

This is a fun one for the kids to watch and to "make" their own pizza for dinner.  I make it with Rapid rise yeast to speed up the process and I get all the toppings ready in separate bowls on a baking sheet to take to the grill.  This is a fun recipe, try it!!!!

Excellent recipe!  Other users have given some great tips to achieve perfection. My tip is only to be used in a rush.  

My wife and I had company over, BBQ fired and ready to go, but somehow ruined the dough in the bread maker.  So in a panic I ran out to the store and purchased pillsbury pizza dough in a can to substitute.

Although not as good as the recipe, it made an awesome pizza and still impressed our guests!

SO good! I make homemade dough/pizza from time to time which is usually pretty good but this was  better. We loved this particular dough and how easy it really was to make on the grill. We used the tinfoil with flour tip posted by another user. We are having a super small wedding in a couple weeks, and decided to cook a bunch of these at up for our guests the night before the big day.

We had mixed reviews at my house. My homemade pizza gets rave reviews from my family and friends (I use the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe by Chef Rider, adding in basil, oregano, and dried onion flakes; and I use a pizza sauce recipe I got from a magazine on homes and gardening last November), so I went ahead and used that. We had never grilled pizza before, so it was a little awkward at first, but my husband and I got a routine going. The first two got a little burned, but then he started turning it a few times and watching it closer. I always triple the dough recipe, so this made 4 medium pizzas on the grill. The general opinion is that it is good but for all the extra work (at least it was work for us) we'd stick wtih baking it on the pizza stone in the oven. We didn't know how to get the vegetables on top done, but crispy still tasted good. Quite frankly, by the time I had eaten two pieces, I was tired of the grilled flavor and wanting the regular pizza taste. I had a pizza box from my son's bought pizza last night, so I cut the top off and used the two pieces to transport the dough to and from the grill. That worked great.

So easy to make and the crust is lovely, infused with the smokiness of the grill.  Fior di latte (fresh mozzarella) is a must for the cheese.

What a great dough. I never have tried making my own pizza dough before. Actually, I try to stay away from yeast because it scares me. Not in a horror film kind of way, but scary in that I like to cook, not bake, so yeast is an unknown (like UFOs or BigFoot). The recipe was easy to follow, each step went exactly as described and the final result was extremely tasty. I did have a bit of trouble with the yeast because none of my local stores had packets of yeast. After I pulled my trusty specs from my purse, was able to see exactly how many teaspoons equaled the packaged amount. Why the heck is the printing on bottles so small? It took a couple tries to get the yeast to foam up.  I erred on the side of too cool of water. Well done, Doug. A great recipe.

I make this all the time for large groups because it is easy to customize the individual pizzas for the vegetarians and all food preferences. I have made it over a wood fire with a grate (boat camping). I made it for my adult daughter's birthday party on our housebooat. We put all the "kids" to work chopping, grating, rolling. They loved it! Grill all the vegetables and anything that needs t be cooked, and all the pizzas on one side first. It doesn't matter if it all gets cold because it will all get hot again when you cook the other side. Have each person place all their desired ingredients on the cooked side. Sauce first (we have choice of pesto sauce & red sauce) then ingredients and your favorite cheese over all. Return to the grill to cook the bottom side. P.S. This is a very tasty dough recipe so make your own! (bread machine on dough cycle works great.)

That was excellent!! I used my own toppings and divided the dough into 4 so we could all have our own individual pizzas. I was worried about making one too big my first time out. But YUM! Best pizza ever!

Loved the crust.  We'll roll it out a little thinner next time, but it was delicious.  This cooks really fast on the grill!  We had to move the pizza to the non-heat side of the grill to let the cheese finish melting.  We added jalapeno cheese sausage for a protein.

This may have been one of my most epic meals.  I did use bread flour instead of all purpose.  I put all the dough ingredients into the bread maker on the "dough/pasta" setting.  When it finished, I put the dough onto a floured counter top and divided into 4 balls.  I kneaded each ball a little and formed into a thin crust.  I them coated each crust with olive oil prior to grilling.  No problems with sticking!  Used a canned pizza sauce and deli slices of mozzarella.  I would highly recommend using the slices instead of shredding cheese, it allows you to get a nice thin even amount of cheese   I altered the toppings to my liking (mushroom, sausage, olives).  YUMO!  Make sure to go easy on the sauce, cheese, and toppings so it cooks evenly.

Best pizza I have ever had!  We use Pepe's frozen pizza dough which saves a huge amount of time and effort.  Also mix the herbs and spices in with the dough b/4 grilling (makes an enormous taste difference).  Toppings - anything goes - mushrooms, sausage, artichoke hearts, bacon, grilled Vidalia onions, pepperoni, peperoncini peppers.  Just don't get it too heavy.  We also do breadsticks with the leftover dough - heavily season.

The fresh basil made this recipe, that and the fact that the house is still cool and we are eating delicious pizza in the middle of summer helps too.  I followed the crust recipe and used mostly whole wheat flour.  Topped with our own toppings.  Be ready to top quickly after flipping.  When it seemed like the crust was done, I turned off the grill and left the cover down to really get the toppings nicely heated.

The pizza was pretty good but I think I will need to add some more "spice" to it to make them great.  As long as you have everything you need with you at the grill they are pretty easy to do.

Wonderful recipe!  My fussy 21 year old loved it!  I have a great BBQ where it gets to 600 degrees fast and then you can turn off the middle grill.  I put the lightly olive oiled dough on and grilled it for about 2-3 mins.  The dough was dry on top with lovely grill lines on the bottom and oh what a great smell.  I then took it off and put olive oil on the dry side and flipped it over and then added toppings etc to the grilled side.  Back on the grill with the ungrilled side down for 4 mins at 500 and WOW.  Lovely grilled pizza. 

I think I could even grill some shells ahead of time and freeze them for busy days and dinner would be ready in 10 mins.  Never as good as fresh but better than the dry prepared crusts from the store.  

Thanks for the great recipe

yum!  This was delicious, and you can obviously make it and add any toppings/sauce you want.  My only suggestions would be to grill one side as stated in the directions, but then remove it and assemble it one a floured cookie sheet or pizza stone, and then slide the uncooked side back onto the grill.  That way you don't have to worry about hovering over a hot grill or burning one side if your assembling takes a while.  Also, this recipe does not yield 16 servings in my opinion.  I made the entire dough recipe, rolled the dough fairly thin and still served almost 3/4 of it among 4 people.

Delicious!! I made the crusts in advance of our lunch party: grilled them on one side, then refrigerated until we were ready to top them and grill the other side. We made several smaller crusts and had an assortment of toppings to make different pizzas. After the final grill, we cut each little pizza in quarters and we could sample each type of pizza.

HUGE hit, and we had great success on our first try.  We used prepared dough from the store, and divided each one in half so that we could all make our own individual pizzas.  I grilled veggies, chicken, and shrimp first, then when we had all the toppings ready we started making our pizzas. Definitely the closest you can come to a brick oven flavor/texture at home.   We took the crusts off the grill to add the toppings, safer for the kids, so needed a bit of corn meal on the platter to help with sliding them back onto the grill.

I usually don't rate or review, but this was really good pizza!  My husband of 28 years always says everything is ok, no other comment, just ok.  Tonight for probably the 2nd time in 28 years, he said this pizza was good!  That is the biggest compliment I  could give you, used dried basil, and made 4 small pizzas instead of 2, and it all came out perfect.  For us it was the first time we had grilled pizza......GREAT!!!!!

This was really good and a different take on pizza.  I did follow the advice to remove the pizza from the grill in order to apply the toppings and was glad I did.  You don't have much time to spare before the pizza will burn.  We'll make this again!

I watched the video for this on AR so I could get a feel for how this is done before I attempted it myself.  I also read the reviews and took note of something that Bobby Flay did with foil as well.  Don't shoot me, but I used another pizza dough recipe from this site in place of the one in this recipe.  I used this recipe more for the technique and instruction involved.  I also used the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" from this site.  I made 7 individual pizzas that ranged from meat lovers to white garlic with fresh basil and tomato.  I grilled the crust on one side, brought them inside to top, then back on the grill which I covered with foil to keep the crust from burning, and I folded the foil over the pizza to aid the cheese in melting and also closed the lid.  They came out perfectly and everyone LOVED them.  Again, this is a really good "how to" recipe so that you can change it up any way you like it - I like that they provided a video for this, very helpful.  Thanks!

This was great! I've been wanting to try pizza on the grill for a long time.  I used refridgerated pre-made dough to cut the time in half.

I love a grilled pizza.  I use my stone and put it on the grill - even better!  The secret to great pizza on the grill is to make sure your grill is REALLY HOT!  You need about 500 degrees.  To the person who said they had tough crust... your grill was probably not hot enough.  Excellent recipe Doug.  Thanks for sharing.  Pizza on the grill is delicious!

This is so good- I used the crust and method, but my own toppings.  I loved the garlic oil!  I only used about 1/4 cup of oil.  Thanks for submitting this reicpe!!

This is definately a "practice makes perfect" recipie. The grill burnt the bottoms before the top cheese melted all the way. I did cook my toppings first and made four mini-pizzas instead of two mediums, cooked two at a time with hubbys help. the dough was excellent, made the bread machine make it and it did need about a half cup more water and it was still pretty stiff but you need that when working on a grill.

At first I thought Gee this dough is REALLY hard to work with and way to dry and stiff so I made a batch of Jay's pizza crust from here just to be on the safe side. Turns out I didnt use Jay's after all but I did add just a tad more water and olive oil to make it a little more pliable. That being said this has to be the best pizza recipe we're tried yet. Rue the day it rains when we're craving grilled pizza. I made a philly steak and cheese with caramelized onions and steak ums. The crust was thick and still slightly crispy and has a essence of a brick oven pizza. The kids went nuts for it to, we'll probably be making this one all summer!

So yummy! I created my own version and it was delicious.  I used Trader Joe's whole wheat pizza dough, Trader Joe's pizza sauce, shredded fontina cheese, fresh mozarella, chicken, tomatoes and sauteed red onions, red pepper and garlic.  Sounds like a lot but it was a wonderful combo.  Quick and relatively easy for the work week. Certainly breaks up the monotony of pizza!

I love this. I have a charcoal grill, I get the coals hot [ashy] and lower my grates as far as they'll go down. Roll out the pizza dough [we like it very thin] place it on your grill. Cover it with the lid, in a few min. check on it. It'll be puffy, then poke it. You can peak at it to see if it is getting to dark, if it is, have two spatulas to move the crust  around, till it looks the way you want. Then flip. Put your sauce on, then layer your toppings and cheese the way you want. I cook all my toppings in a fry pan before putting on the pizza, otherwise it dosen't seem to cook the toppings enough, for the amount of time the pizza is on the grill.Use your favorite pizza dough;fresh store bought, or make your own [this is a very good recipe] It's by far the best tasting pizza.

If we could give this 7 stars we would!  This is THE BEST way to make pizza ever ... tastes like it came from a wood fired oven ... simply amazing ... we used the basic dough recipe but added our own toppings to suit our tastes.  I cut the dough in 1/2 and made 2 smaller pizzas from it ... I broiled pepperoni until it was crispy, took that out and put onions and green peppers in the broiler until cooked ... used homemade spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce from a jar.  The second pizza was BBQ chicken ... I pounded a chicken breast flat and grilled w/ bbq sauce ... broiled red onions and chopped fresh cilantro ... The results of both were simply outstanding ... I can't wait to try more different types of pizza toppings ... I think next I'll do shrimp and pesto pizza!  Seriously, stop reading the reviews and make this pizza!

Bad idea! Brushing the oil on the grill was dangerous, and my brush burnt.  The dough burnt. The second pizza I sprayed pam on the grill, and that kept it so it did not burn.  Flavor was good, but tooooo much work for the end result.

I used store bought dough but followed the rest of the recipe. Be sure to spray the grill with oil- mine stuck a little , other then that it was pretty darn tasty. I'll be making this again :)

Mmmm, delicious for a summer evening.  We subbed the olives and peppers for Italian sausage, and made extra sauce.  I don't think my dough doubled in size either time, maybe my yeast is at fault.  We rolled the dough out to less than 1/4 inch, because we like it thinner.  My husband loved it.  You should try it, it's very good!

We loved this! The dough wasn't hard to make -my husband was so proud because he got it started himself. I roasted a red pepper and used a good bit of it. I thought the recipe called for too little red pepper. It was helpful to have both of us helping put the toppings on at the grill. We think it's the best homemade pizza we've had, and we'll definitely make it again!

I think my dough was too sticky, because it was so hard to get it on the grill, and when it did, it folded onto itself and started sliding between the rack. Since it started sliding between the rack, it was hard to pry off to flip. By the time I pried it off, it was black, and half of it fell on the ground or in the grill. So sad!

Unbelievably amazing! Better that any pizza restaurant. Never again will we bake pizza in the oven.  Didn't use their dough recipe, used pizza dough from the grocery store, turn out perfect.  If you watch the pizza grilling video at the end of the recipe it helps a lot.  Keep a careful eye on the pizza because even on the lowest heat of a gas grill it cooks fast, a matter of minutes.  THE BEST!

This was super DELICIOUS!  I didnt go exactly by the recipe because I wanted to top my pizza different.  But I did make the dough part.  I loved the addition of fresh basil and garlic in the dough.  It made it sooo yummy!  I made my own pizza sauce and made a margherita pizza by adding roma tomatoes, fresh mozzarella slices, and fresh basil leaves.  YUMMMM  I told my bf this is how I'm always making pizza!  The crust was crunchy on the outside, but soft in the middle.  It turned out great!  Ive never had grilled pizza before but have always wanted to try it.  If your skeptical, dont be, because its delicious!  Im glad I finally ended up making it!  This tasted like it would of been from a fancy expensive pizza parlor, but sooo much cheaper!  This is a favorite!

This had a wonderful flavor. I don't know why but my dough didn't rise more than halfway and I even set it out on the patio (after over an hour and no rise) in case my house was too cold or drafty with air conditioning on. When I ran out of time I just went ahead and made the pizza. The dough turned out nice and very light and had a good flavor. I skipped the second rise since my first rise took too long. I even used brand new yeast especially labeled for pizza and new flour so this would turn out. I divided this into 4 smaller pizzas. My husband found it was much easier to handle them that way than the larger ones. We messed up the first one in practice, but once we got the pattern and timing down, this turned out delicious. Our coals were too hot at first so you need a medium fire or the crust burns before the cheese is melted completely. We are going to try this again as we soo enjoyed the end results. We made thin crust pizzas and these almost rivaled our favorite wood fired oven baked pizza place's.

This has been a new classic in our home since last summer when we discovered that recipe. I would suggest not to use the "high" setting on the side you will cook the pizza because the dough will burn before the cheese melts. It is easier if you remove the dough from the grill after grilling the first side. We flip it over on a cooking tray, place the toppings and then place it back on the grill. It cooks quickly so don't put too many toppings.

I cheated and bought the dough from our local pizzeria.  My husband and I each made our own small pies.  I messed mine up a bit when I put it on the grill.  It ended up a long oval shape.  This shape ended up working out great, because once the crust was starting to char, I was able to stick it up on the second grill rack to let the cheese finish melting. My hubbys' was too round to do that, so his did not finish melting.  I was amazed how well the grill cooked the dough.  I thought for sure there would be gooey spots- but it turned out great!

We loved this!  And it was so fun to make, come on, pizza on the grill!  I felt very gourmet.  The crust was crisy, but still had a just enough chewy-ness.  It was perfect, although next time I will cook it on lower heat, because the bottom was a little black in spots by the time the cheese melted.  I only let the dough rise 20 minutes because we didn't have time, and it still turned out great.  I topped it with sliced tomatos, fresh basil & goat cheese.  Over the top delicious.  I am going to make it tomorrow night too!

I can't rave enough about this recipe! I too was worried about dough falling through the grates, but it worked so well!!  What an awesome way to do the dough, GREAT flavor!  Ijust put on fresh mozz and basil on one, pineapple and ham on the other, and a "super" with everything on it!  So amazing!!!  I purchased the dough at our local bakery which really cut down on the prep time, but KUDOS excellent recipe, I will make this again!  EXCELLENT!!!!

Well, we had our first grilled pizza experience tonight and WOW!  It was great!  Due to time constraints, we used a batch of crust we purchased and divided into two pieces.  We also used a canned organic pizza sauce that we really like.  The grilled crust was great!  One we made with roasted red & yellow peppers, black olives, onion and mushrooms.  The other was thin sliced canadian bacon onion and pineapple.  Next time we plan to try the crust recipe.  This is such a versatile recipe and the grilled flavor adds so much to a pizza!

This recipe is awesome.  We used the dough recipe and added our own ingredients.  We have tradition for Friday night pizza (and its always homemade), but the summers get too hot to use the oven; the grill is great for pizza!!  We like to use our favorite spaghetti sauce (prego brand) for the sauce, because its easy and has great flavor.  Glad I tried this recipe - we can now keep our Friday night tradition in the summer!

This pizza crust is the best you have ever had if you like garlic! It handled well, tasted great, held up on the grill.  this was my first grilled pizza experience and I had 15 people here for primary night, and I have never heard so many people rave about a pizza.  It is really fun for a party, using several diffent toppings makes it alot of fun as we relaxed with a cocktail and waited for the next pizza from the grill!!  Thanks Doug!

This was absolutely the best pizza I have ever made.  The dough was perfect - crisp on the outside and incredibly flavorful on the inside.  I followed the recipe as written and it was great.  Yum! Yum! Yum!

Maybe the dough being too tough was my fault, and not the recipie's. We didn't finish it, and didn't bother to eat the leftovers.

Within 4 weeks, I've made these pizza's 4 times and they've been a hit each time.  Great recipie AND what is even better - if you can pre-make them and freeze them before your dinner or party - they are even better the next day because the olive oil (and basil if you added it) have had time to soak in. SCRUMPTIOUS!!!

I always thought grilled pizza would be messy and difficult, but after reading everyone's reviews I deceided to give it a go!  YUM!  I just used my favorite pizza dough recipe and my own imagination with the toppings.  My husband is ready to sell the oven and grill all year round! (This is quite a statement considering how fridged our winters get!) Thanks for giving me the confidence to try it!

This was fantastic.  I shared some with our dear neighbors.  The mom called an hour later and said she felt terrible, it was so good she kept eating it and her kids didn't get any! We will never order take out pizza again.  Thank you.

This recipe produced surprisingly delicious results. My 13 year old was able to make these pizzas with minimal supervision, except Mom did the grilling! I used a pizza stone placed directly on the grill to prevent my grill from mess.

This recipie is great with any topping!  I took mine off when the crust was done, but the cheese wan't all the way melted, so i stuck it in the broiler to make the cheese bubbly!  The frill flavor is really good!

This didn't really work out for me. The bottom was overcooked (burnt is more like it) before the cheese melted. Maybe it was my BBQ but I had it on the lowest setting possible. I think I will stick with my pizza stone.

this was amazing! Made the dough as written. divided it into four rounds.  Baked two and it was plenty for two people.  Next time we will roll them much thinner, the dough was very thick and chewy, exactly like a thick crust pizza would be.

Outstanding!  I, like many others, was highly suspicious of this actually working, but it did!  As close to wood fired as you can get without a brick oven.  I did take a shortcut and used store bought dough, but I was more curious about the cooking technique than assessing my dough-making skills.  We will definitely doing this again this summer!

This was time consuming, but worth it.  I did not only use the ingredients that it says though.  I used bell pepper, onion, and pepperoni.  I just heated this in the microwave for about 20 seconds to get some extra heat behind it so it would warm while on the grill.  It did the trick and I can't wait until I make it again.  I think next time I will try BBQ sauce and chicken ...

Great recipe, the crust turned out better then i expected. I made my own sauce, used a can of stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, garlic powder and pureed it together. Simple tastey sauce.

We love this pizza!  We make this an interactive meal with family and friends - have dough prepared and several bowls of ingredients prepared and gather round the grill and enjoy!!  I also knead in the garlic and basil right away and let it rise overnight in fridge.

Great recipe! Adding the basil and garlic to the crust, then grilling gave it great flavor.  I made homemade sauce and had an assortment of pizza toppings for each family member to make their own pizza.  Thanks for sharing!!

This crust is AMAZING. The garlic and fresh basil really add something special, plus the char marks from the grill.. oooh so good! I add my own toppings, like ricotta cheese and garlic/olive oil sauce and broccoli. I will never make pizza inside again.

Ok so to start i was really skeptical about the dough falling through the griddle on the grill, that didnt happen. But, a number of other things when wrong. First, we started out with our homemade dough and rolled it out on a pizza baking sheet, it was about the size of a medium pizza from your everyday pizza chain, and when we went to put it on the grill there was no way to pick it up it just stretched like pizza dough should.so then we decided to attempt to flip the baking sheet so the dough would fall onto the grill. Again failure we got a pile of dough that didn't resemble a pizza what so ever. Second, we decided we were trying to make too big of a pizza so we shortened it down to a personal pan size.We got it on the grill and and as stated it cooked that side in about 2 min. We pulled it off added our toppings and placed it back on the grill, and again it about 2 min the bottom was dark brown. So we pulled it off with the assumption that it was done, because there was no way to continue cooking it without burning it completely.Unfortunately once we cut it and took a bite the inside was still doughy, not cooked at all. needless to say we ended up ordering pizza from pizza hut. 
Keep in mind we were afraid of the dough falling through the cracks so our grill was around 400 degrees, maybe it was too hot. I dont know but if your hoping for a nice meal and your trying this for the first time be warned, you may be ordering out.
ps Oiling the grill only causes blazing inferno

This is amazing!  We used mostly whole wheat flour and it turned out beautiful!  The dough will seem really stiff and seem hard to work with, but that is necessary for it to hold up on the grill.  This is definitely a keeper!

Awesome recipe!  Used Whole Wheat flour instead and worked wonderful. Also, used my trusty Weber Charcoal grill - charcoal only used on one side to cook dough and the other side I was able to melt and heat everything after the dough was done. Thanks for the recipe!

used my breadmaker pizza dough recipe, was not quite stiff enough for the grill. will use this dough recipe next time. had to lower heat on gas griil so as not to burn, and shut it off and closed it at the end to better melt the cheese. very delicious, and after doing one, will follow suggestions to roll dough up on rolling pin to put on grill, and to take it off before topping. 
NOTE: (for any brave souls and /or gourmets) am anxious to try a yummy  unusual topping that i had on a pizza elsewhere... roasted pears & bleu cheese w pecans, arugula and caramelized onions! YUM!

Very yummy if only my husband would have helped me flip the pizza. Oh well. It was still edible. I used the pizza crust part of this recipe. For the sauce, I did half pesto and half Homemade Pizza Sauce from AR. For the toppings, I used marinated artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, shrooms, spinach, and goat cheese.

(PESTO SAUCE:
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
3 medium garlic cloves 
2 tablespoons pine nuts, lightly toasted 
12 large fresh basil leaves 
Pinch salt)

This pizza was great. More time consuming than some other pizza recipes due to the need for two rises, but worth the time. We adapted the toppings to suit our tastes, and already have lots of ideas for other variations. The dough is much stiffer and drier than other pizza crusts I have made, perhaps because of the need to put it directly on the grill. Thanks for the great idea. We will definitely be making this one again!

Crust was more of a flat-bread, not pizza. For toppings, only used sauce, thinly-sliced tomato, basil, and cheese.

The crust was a little dry.  I wonder if it had something to do with the time I gave it to rise.  Delicious concept though--the reviews about watching it carefully to cook the crust *just right* are wise, and when you do, it's so brick-oven!

Some of the best pizza we have eaten.  We made one plain cheese and one with canadian bacon and mushrooms and both turned out delicious.  Thanks to the reviewer with the idea of grilling one side, bringing it inside to top and then grilling the other side.  This method worked really well for us.  The dought with the additions of the garlic and basil is amazing.  I will use the crust recipe over and over even if not cooking on the grill.  But we plan to have many more BBQ's with pizza instead of burgers.  Thanks!

Nice idea, but grilling dough doesn't work as described. After waiting 15 minutes for our dough to cook, the outside was burning and the inside was still moist. Had to bake the crust in the oven just so we could finally eat dinner. Disappointing.

For all you campers...if you have a pizza stone, take it on your next camping trip and make this over the fire pit (the stone also protects the dough from the flames).  Heat the stone on the grate above the fire. The smoke from the fire will give the pizza a flavor out of this world. The kids (and us) thought this was the best pizza ever.  We even made calzones.  We made a homemade lid using tin foil and a couple of 3-4" round logs to cover the pizza and calzones. Roll the foil around the logs like a scroll and it keeps the foil off the pizza and the wind won't take it away. We cheated and brought premade refrigerated pizza dough.

Thank you for this recipe!  I made the dough per instructions and it was lovely.  We did use different toppings onions, peppers, tomato, hot sausage, and mushrooms.  I precooked everything but the tomatoes.  It tasted wonderful.  We will make this again!

Very good! We made this for our dinner club and everyone love it. I would recommend grilling a crust for practice ahead of time. I had to grill the crust over medium-low heat on the first side and then medium on the second. You will want to watch them closely to keep them from burning. It happens very quickly.

Very tasty!!  My husband and 5 year old said it was the best pizza we've ever had.  I've never had grilled pizza before but this was fantastic!  I didn't use the pizza sauce here, I used the easy pizza sauce III from this site which worked out well.  I also used a sausage, onion and green pepper mixture that I sauteed on the stove so that the vegetables were soft.  Next time, I think I'll try med-high heat instead of high once it's flipped over since it was hard to melt the cheese without burning the bottom.

Very good!  My only complaint is that we cooked it on our charcoal grill, following the directions to use high heat and burned the bottom pretty bad.  And because we had to then get the pizza off so it wouldn't burn more, the pizza wasn't very hot and some of the cheese did not melt.  We also had a problem with flames after brushing the grates with oil, which also contributed to the pizza burning.  Next time we'll wait to put the pizzas on until the flames completely die down after brushing grates with oil (or spritz them with a spray bottle) and possibly even brush the coals aside so the pizzas cook over indirect heat.  We'll also make sure to have LONG utensils for spreading on the sauce/pesto, as the grill was too hot to have your hands down there brushing it on.

This crust was great but you could use any crust if it looks too hard for you.  This recipe has great directions for grilling pizza.  At first we were not sure if we liked it but the leftovers were addicting. Oh, so good!

This pizza was delicious!!! This was our first time making pizza on the grill, and I already have plans to do so every weekend! I followed the recipe for the dough to the T, and it came out great (doubled the amount of garlic kneaded into the dough). We used our own toppings and we had a turkey pepperoni with red sauce pizza and a tomato basil pesto pizza. Both were delicious! Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!! Update: I made this dough again tonight, and I brushed the crust with olive oil and sprinkled cornmeal on both sides before throwing it on the grill. Soooo good!!!! The outside had a nice crisp texture from the oil, while the inside was soft. Yum....

I was very very pleased with this recipe. The dough is worth the wait. We used 50% whole wheat flour and 50% regular flour. We also rolled it out very very thin. We will definitely be making this again!

I just LOVE this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly except for toppings and subbed in 1 cup of whole wheat flour. It turned out fabulously delish. We have used this recipe serveral times and it never disappoints. Whenever we serve to guests, they always ask for the recipe. This is a summer favourite of ours and we enjoy with red wine or a pitcher of sangria. Thanks for sharing!

Ok, tip for the dough: Don't add all the flour, leave about 1/2 cup or more out, and use that for kneading it, and knead it longer than it says. Also, I love the grilled pizza flavor, but the toppings never get that crispy, toasty pizza taste, so after several goes we finally tried placing the dough on the grill with toppings (no precooking one side), then throw it on the top rack in the oven and broil it for a few minutes until the crust is golden, and the cheese is toasty and bubbly! WAAAAAYYYY better. Also, I tweaked the crust to make it part wheat, and it was delicious: Use 1 T. olive oil extra, 1 T. sugar and use 1 c. whole wheat flour and 2 c. white flour, (knead with white flour). Roll out and fork to prevent bubbles, then brush both sides with olive oil. YUMO!

This was incredible! My husband raved over it and loved that he got to do the grilling part ;) Would be fun for dinner guests to be able to top their own pizzas. Give yourself plenty of time to make the dough, was well worth the effort. Even picky 3yo ate 2 pieces!

Pizza on the grill is the only way to make it at home. I grilled some sausage, onions and peppers first and then grilled the dough quickly.  I assembled the pizza (olive oil, sauce, cheese, fresh basil and garlic and then the sausage and veggies) placed it on a cookie sheet and put it back on the grill for about seven minuets.  It was amazing, my Italian neighbor even commented on how great it turned out.

I am giving this a 5 star rating even though I didn't do it "right"...I got everything started and then noticed my grill was out of gas...hate that!  I also changed the toppings a little to my families favorites, but despite the changes it is a serious winning recipe that I have now prepared to make again at the request of my husband, who raved about the crust as having, "really great flavor!"

THIS.IS.TO.DIE.FOR.  Seriously, this is one of the best things I've ever made.  I still can't believe I made it myself!  I used half whole-wheat flour in the dough and made 5 individual pizzas.  I found it was easier to get the dough on the grill in 5 pieces rather than 1 big piece.  (try roasting garlic and then spreading on the pizza instead of pizza sauce..it is heavenly).

I probably shouldn't review this yet since I didn't follow the directions exactly.  I was impatient, hungry and have been trying to make this for a week now but haven't had the time it needs. After I let the yeast mixture rest I put all dough ingredients in the mixer plus garlic and basil and let go for 5 minutes.  Then tried to knead it but it was way to stiff so I let it proof for 1 hour.  It was fairly pliable after that so I stretched it out in a 13x9 pan, well oiled both sides of dough and put it on the grill (without the pan of course).  It came out really thick, between 1/2 and 3/4 inch thick.  Topped with my own sauce and some mozzarella/parm mixture.  It was decent but not great.  I like a thinner crust anyways.  So if anybody else is impatient like myself-please do not do it this way.  Take the time and follow the recipe.  I will try this again in the next few days and follow the recipe all the way.  It's got to be great with all of the 5stars it has received.

This was soooooo good!!! The changes I made that really seemed to work were: I brushed olive oil onto the dough before I grilled it. Then I took the dough off with 2 spatulas, and put it on a baking sheet, brushed the uncooked side and flipped it back onto the grill by hand. I cooked that side slightly less than the first side, only about 1 minute. Then I took it off the grill again and dressed the pizza, adding my favorite toppings. Turned the grill down to low and put the pizza back on for about 7 minutes. Long enough to melt the cheese and heat up the toppings. It was AWESOME!!! My young daughters and my husband raved about it. This is a keeper!!!

Amazing! I think if heaven tasted like something it would taste like a homemade pizza on the grill. My suggestion would be not to pour the sauce and toppings over the uncooked dough. The pizza will turn out mushy and hard to pick up with your hands to eat. First, let the dough sit on the grill a bit until it stiffens up and rises. Next, scatter spoonfuls of tomato sauce [don't cover the entire area of the dough with sauce] evenly across. Spread out thinly sliced pieces of fresh mozzarella, shredded parmesan, and cheddar cheese over the pie along with your other favorite toppings. Works great on a gas grill but the best would be if you have a charcoal grill... the pizza will pick up a nice smoky flavor and taste like it came fresh out of a brick oven.

Absolutely the best pizza! I doubled the crust recipe and made breadsticks. I brushed the breadsticks with butter and garlic when done. Yum! Thank you so much for this recipe Doug!! This is definitely going to be on the menu for Packer Game Day parties!

Really great crust, but I have to say...Papa Murphy's still beats it. Who knew you could put their take 'n' bake pizza on the grill?!?

Very fun & tasty!  and successful!  I didn't add the garlic or basil into the crust, but followed all other directions for grilling.  Very fun for party of 4, as each person chose their own toppings and got to take left overs home too.

Super easy and yummy. My family was soooo impressed with this recipe. My dough didn't stick to the grill. I made sure that it was well oiled and I made little personal size pizzas. It works better that way since everyone has different preferences anyways. 

I also make extra dough and portion it into little dough balls and wrap them in plastic and store them in a ziploc bag in the freezer so I can take out a couple at a time.

This was a great recipe!  I love pizza on the grill.  Another approach is to put a pizza stone on the grill, this allows you to cook more traditional pizzas, not worry about breaking the dough, and still get that smoky flavor.  I got my pizza stone from www.pizza-stone.com and it works great on the grill.

I love this crust but you have to be careful or it will burn quickly.  I have a charcoal grill so I can't easily regulate the temp.  Sometimes I will cook the crust on the grill and then finish melting the cheese in the broiler so the bottom doesn't burn.

I had a really hard time with this.  The dough cooked and burned long before the cheese melted.  For the 2nd pizza I cooked one side of the dough, put the sauce on that side and put the uncooked side down and the cheese still would not melt before the bottom started to burn.  I finished them in the oven under the broiler.  Not worth the effort.

LOVED IT!  I made the crust in the bread maker, just threw all the ingredients in there and ran the dough cycle(minus the basil, I kneaded that in right before I rolled the dough out).  Be sure not to have the grill heat too high, as I burnt the bottom of the first pizza pretty bad!  Be sure to check the bottom of the pizza using a spatula every few minutes to make sure you are't charring it.  I did this on the second pizza and it was fabulous!

Now my very favorite pizza! I put green, red and jalapeno peppers, red onions, fresh spinach and cilantro, grilled chicken in Louisiana hot sauce, pineapple and tomatoes. Everyone loved it cause they could make it their own!

I have been making homemade pizza for years and never thought to grill them. WHAT A GREAT idea. The only thing I did different for the dough is, I only let it rise for 1 hour. The pizza still turned out fantastic and to boot I did heat up the house with the oven.

Excellent.  This was my first time using dry active yeast, so I had to do some research in order to proof the yeast.  I didn't have time to punch down the dough and let it rise for another hour after adding the basil and garlic, and it still turned out fine!

Ok, I was beyond sceptical about this, even after reading all the reviews, I still didn't think it was possible. And then I tried it, and 1/2 the dough was cooking and 1/2 wasn't (obviously due to the way I had it on my grill), after some perfecting, this is just awesome. Seriously, who ever thought you'd make a pizza on a grill.... I'm not kidding when I say it will never be made in the oven again. DELISH!

My family loves grilled pizza - it's a special treat!  I used my own pizza dough recipe, and did not put the sauce on - just sliced tomatoes.  I made two pizzas, and found that the olive oil really adds to the flavor, because I forgot it on the second one. Nevertheless, it was still delicious!  I have a wood pizza peel now, and the dough is so much easier to handle - you can just slip the pizza onto the grate.  I use tongs to flip it over.

This was excellent! I cut the recipe in half and it made a pretty small crust. Just enough for my husband and me with one slice left over (we aren't big portion people either). My husband said this recipe earned a 5, which is a rare comment from him!

This was my first attempt at making pizza dough. It was easier than I thought! This pizza was delicious! If I could give it more stars I would! I made it with "fresh tomatoe sauce" that's on this site. My family gobbled it up! Thanks so much for this keeper!

Loved it!! I added a few things, like a little bit of garlic powder to the dough and I added tomatoe paste(for thicker sauce), fresh oregano, basil and onoins.  Topped with portabellas and red and yellow peppers and cubed fresh mozarella. Super good!!

This is a really fun and gourmet way to make pizza.  I threw all the dough ingredients in my bread machine and it turned out great.  I loved the texture of the pizza crust.  However, I had a hard time getting the cheese to melt before the bottom of the crust burned.  I use a charcoal grill and will let the coals burn down more the next time I make this.  And there will definitely be a next time!

Amazing, Amazing, Amazing.  I get so many wonderful complements on this recipe.  It does take longer for the dough to rise (higher altitude...?) but I turn my oven on to warm and place it on top.  That helps it rise faster. Thank you for the wonderful idea.

Wonderful pizza crust.  We love home made pizza.  We however live in the south and it is getting to be that time of the year that we don't want to turn the oven on 500 degrees for 2+ hours to heat a pizza stone.  We made this last night and found the crust gets just as crisp as when you make in the oven on a stone which is great.  

I used Doug's crust, but we topped with pesto, spinach, carmalized onions, feta, and sun dried tomatoes.  It was a huge hit and my husband and I ate a whole pizza.  I placed the second crust in the freezer to attempt to cook next weekend.  We will have to see how it goes.

This recipe was amazing and a great choice for cooking for friends.  I think the directions could be a little more specific on how to prepare the yeast.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

I've always been disappointed by homemade pizza, but this recipe definitely was not disappointing! It was really great, and will be great for cookouts this summer. I just had to be really careful because my grill doesn't heat evenly. This was good with a variety of toppings.

Good idea, but it didn't work out very well for me.  I used whole wheat flour and the first time I mixed up the dough it was a complete flop - so dry that couldn't even knead it.  Second time around I used an extra cup of water.  I also ended up using an extra cup of flour but it was at least usable.  We had a terrible time getting our dough on the grill grate without it folding up on itself.  Very tricky.  The edges got burned by the flame.  I think the idea has potential, but it wasn't worth the 2 hour wait for the dough to rise.  Next time I will try kneading the garlic and herbs into my usual pizza dough recipe and also try the aluminum foil trick (I should have read the reviews first!  It would have helped a lot!)

This recipe strikes me as closer to authentic Italian pizza rather than the American version of pizza. The flavor was very good, although I did have a bit of trouble with the dough burning in places.

This crust is excellent!  I only allowed a second short rise and the crust was thin and  just crispy enough, when cooked on a pizza stone.
I put pepperoni on one with fresh mozzarella, and another with onions and peppers and fresh mozzarella.  EXCELLENT!

Delicious! I'm definitely making this pizza again. One of my pizzas was BBQ chicken (I cooked and shredded a chicken breast and added BBQ sauce), and the other pepperoni was the star.

I used fresh mozzarella thinly sliced so it melted very nicely. Also I sautéed onions and orange and yellow bell peppers as another topping.

When the first side was finished cooking, rather than flip and hastily add toppings, I slid the pizza, cooked side up onto a baking sheet and added my toppings. Then I slid back onto the grill to finish the process. It worked really well.

We made this with pizza dough from the store.  It worked really well with flouring the dough ahead of time, and using a silicon grilling mat, no sticking.  I would recommend that the grill heat be adjusted for somewhere in between 400 to 450 degrees.  It gives it time for the ingredients to get hot, but not burn the crust.  We loved the recipe, and it does take two people to make them well.

I've made this twice now.  The first time for my in-laws.  I grilled up some onions and roasted a red pepper, mushrooms, etc for toppings and some fresh mozzarella slices.  I don't think they'd every had a wood-fire grill style pizza like this (and the one in the picture for the recipe) so my mozzarella didn't go very far lol I had to explain that you kind of just plop it around and the sauce comes through instead of covering with cheese like a regular pizza.....Anywhoo, I used the most amazing marinara that I order on Thrive Market....It's made me a snob, I won't use anything besides that or homemade.  It is SO GOOD, especially on this crust recipe.  I followed the directions exactly except maybe the grilling part.  I tend to get my grill super hot while rolling out the first dough ball really thin.  I roll it out on a piece of oiled foil, and plop it down on the grill grate and turn my grill to a medium temp, over direct heat.  While it cooks I roll out the next one.  I cook one side at a time for all of them and set them on a wire rack so the steam doesn't make them soggy.  Then people top them, and we plop them back on the grill to cook the other side and heat the toppings.  The second side I do on low to start until the cheese melts, and then crank it up to medium to brown it a little and crisp it up.  That's just what worked for my grill and routine.  This is an awesome recipe, I also use them for pitas....picture this as a pita with a nice Greek salad.....mhmm.  The he

Great taste! Clear instructions for baking. Worked just like it said. I only let the dough rise once and it was fine. Easier to flatten dough if you punch it down and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before shaping.

I made this just as stated, with slightly less flour as I felt my dough coming together. It cooked up perfectly on the grill, and was a fun dinner activity with friends. I doubled the recipe and froze some for later, so I'm hoping the dough will hold up well.

First time trying making my own Pizza Crust... followed the directions exactly as instructed and it came out wonderfully. Pizza turned out amazing and the family loved it. Can't wait to make this again for family and friends. 

It was getting late so I didn't let the bread rise the full 2nd hour, kids were getting hungry! However it was fluffy, tasty, and beautiful. Also I grated the mozzarella through the smaller grates as I followed a suggestion that it would allow the cheese to melt quicker and the bottom of the pizza not to burn while waiting. Worked perfectly.

Amazing, will make again the crust was so crispy! The garlic and olive oil brushed onto the grill really did add flavor to the crust! I left out the garlic and basil in the crust since I have some picky eaters in the family but it was an overall hit!

Excellent recipe! My dough came together with only using 3 cups of flour.  Unfortunately,  my first pizza crust got a little charred while I was trying to figure out how to flip it but by the second one I handled the dough and toppings perfectly. The charred one was still delicious and I told our company  it was blackened pizza with added flavor :) definitely going to make this again and play around with the toppings.

Wonderful.   I didn't think it would work, but turned out great the first time.  Mixed up the dough, covered it and let it set in the refrigerator until I came home from work.  It didn't take much time to finish the pizza when I came home.  I used a 6oz jar of Barilla's tomato Pesto.  I tried to keep the grill temp around 350.

The dough rose well and was easy to work.  I added my own toppings, canadian bacon, avocadoes, artichokes, black olives. It was wonderful!!  It made 2 crusts about 12-14 inches. I will use it again and again with my kamado grill!

We used Pillsbury pre-made dough & this recipe was still awesome!  We changed the toppings up a bit- tomatoes, basil, mozzarella because most of my family doesn't like sun-dried tomatoes.  Highly recommend trying this out.

I made the dough as written but went with  more traditional toppings.  The flavour of the dough was very good but it was very difficult to transfer the dough to the grate, I would suggest making smaller pizzas and perhaps putting them on a bed of corn meal. Also, some of the garlic stuck to the grates and burned making the bottom of the pizza bitter. Good recipe when you want pizza on a hot day.

I was terrified. But it worked!! For my grill cooking on low was plenty hot. The first batch was black on the bottom and still doughy, but the second batch was perfect. Smaller pizzas worked great for flipping. And I used Rhodes Rolls white bread frozen dough; delicious and so easy.

This review is for the crust. I used Italian seasoning instead of basil as that is what I had on hand and mixed a regular can of tomato sauce with tomato sauce with organized, garlic and basil seasoning. (It was very tasty). The dough came out very well. I only let it rise for one hour and then divided it up into 5 servings. I made 3 personal pizzas (which was more than enough for 2 adults and a preschooler. I also mixed in the minced garlic into the dough after the hour and then rolled it out thinly. Once onthe grill, took 3 minutes and hubby took it off. We thought it was too hard and it would be too crispy once done but we were wrong. Once we returned it back to the grill to finish cooking with the toppings it made the dough crispy around the edges and chewy/soft toward the middle. It was perfect! We used Monterey Jack and Mozzerella on 2 pizzas with spinach,  diced tomatoes, sliced onions and sliced portobello mushrooms, and one with diced chicken. The other pizza had diced tomatoes and both cheeses made by my preschooler. The combinations were amazing the the flavor of the grilled pizza was phenomenal. I will never again buy frozen pizza. Period. This dough is worth it. Next time I will let the dough rise for the two hours as recommended but it was good with the one hour just as.

I used my bread machine to make the dough.  Turned out great.  Everyone put their toppings on a plate, making it easy to make personalized pizzas.  We all enjoyed it.

I made th crust and doctored the rest to suite myself and my boyfriends preference. Holy cow was the crust good. And I used pizza sauce in a can and doctored it with another sauce recipe with hot Italian sausage, mushrooms onion and jalapeño. This was a greT idea!

This pizza recipe for the grill was terrific! I did make 2 balls of dough and rolled the dough thinner as we don't like really heavy crust. Preheated the gas grill, oiled the foil and placed the thinly rolled dough 
( a bit less than 1/4 inch thick) onto the foil and then onto the grill. In about 5 minutes, it was getting crispy on the edges and browning, so I removed it from the grill and took inside. Turned it over with a spatula and put on shredded pizza cheese and then thinly sliced tomato, precooked mushrooms, onions, garlic, eggplant, peppers and a few slices of pepperoni for my honey. Put it back on the hot grill and cooked it for about 4-5 minutes more, this time without the foil. The bottom of the crust is slightly burnt---next time I will lower the heat of the grill more ( as some other reviewers suggested) and also put the pizza back onto the grill with the foil underneath it again. The taste was great though...so will try the other pizza tomorrow! YUM!

Kudos to Doug, this is a great dough recipe. I divided into four equal parts which made grilling much easier. Next time I might turn heat down just a tad. Just made simple pizzas with Classico Pizza Sauce, pepperoni and I topped with thin slices of Mozzarella. My husband assisted because four hands was easier than two. We loved it! It will be a regular on our menu.

This pizza was very delicious.  I used a store bought whole wheat pizza crust and then added all ingredients as suggested with the grill set at a lower temperature.  This was the best pizza crust I have ever eaten.  Total prep and cooking time maybe 20 minutes.   My daughter couldn't wait to take the left overs to work with her the next day.  I will definitely be making this again!

I tried this for my family tonight, we thought it was ok, my 4 year old didn't like it at all, he had just a cheese pizza.  I would agree with a couple of others about lowering your heat, high is just too much.  (I still like my pizza stone) I think that this would be great for a outdoor party modified for appetizers.

Really good!! I made my own pizza sauce fresh is always best.   My only problem I LOVE toppings I used so many I had to finish pizza under the broiler.  Crust turned out great.

Make sure you cook the pizza only a minute or two or 3 on the first side.  I did 5 minutes because the "how to grill pizza" video said to cook the crust for 10 minutes.  I figured 5 min was a good checking point.  It wasn't!  One of the pizza crusts was burned.  The bite I tried on the non-burned pizza was very good.  We had to order pizza for the whole family to eat dinner, however.

This was wonderful! Why does the grill make everything better? This crust is perfect. I only needed 3 cups of flour.  Since the cooking time is so short, I sauteed the veggies before I added them to the pizza. This recipe would be great for a bbq. Let everyone top their own.

i don't put all of the topping on my pizza...but this is my go-to dough recipe.  the only changes i made were added garlic powder (i like my pizza thin and i found that when i roll it out, the garlic tends to make the dough tear) and dried basil.  i also live 6000 feet above sea level...and i found that i only need two and a half cups of flour.  great recipe!

Very good! I decreased the amount of salt though, our first try at this was a little salty for my liking, but the second go at it (with half the salt) was amazing. Great way to impress your friends too...well at least the friends who don't know how to cook!

Pizza on the grill is absolutely the way to go.  My kids and their friends request this ALL the time.  Can't imagine bothering with making pizza from scratch and putting it in the oven.

First off, I only used the crust recipe, not the rest of it.  This recipe makes GREAT grilled pizza dough.  I used the Easy Pizza Sauce III from this site and topped to everyone's personal preference.  Very good!!  I will definitely be keeping this crust recipe.

So I'm reviewing just the bread of course, cause toppings are up to the individual cook, ya know? Though I'll be sure to try roasted red peppers and olives eventually, yum. Well, first I want to say that I screwed up the bread in every possible way that it could be screwed up. My big mistake? I mixed up the oil quantities...instead of using the 1/4 c to brush on the bread, I accidentally dumped it in. Oops! It was fine though after I added another 2 TB or so of flour. For the oil to brush on, I used a TB of olive oil and cooked the garlic in a skillet for the oil to get the garlic flavor...microwave, really? I tried both brushing oil on the grill and not, and maybe it's because I'm using a George Foreman indoor grill, but I couldn't detect a flavor difference. And instead of just adding chopped garlic and basil, I think it's a better idea to add a lot of dried herbs to the bread. I added 1/2 a ts of garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, oregano, a pinch of dill. So lovely and seasoned, but I couldn't believe I was completely out of basil. And I think it would be a better idea to roll em out into circles first before the second rising. And seriously, this is not a tomato paste or pizza sauce, or any kind of cooked ingredient topping pizza recipe! It just screams fresh ingredients. I only used chopped tomatoes, red onions, and mozzarella. I store my extra dough in the fridge in individual zip lock bags and plan on using it up within the week.

I LOVE this grilled pizza!  I'm really glad I watched the video, too, 'cause I wouldn't have expected the crust to work.  It comes out kinda crusty like gourmet stone-baked pizza.  The dough is easy to make and works even if it only rises for an hour.  I've used shredded chicken, crumbled burger, turkey pepperoni, etc. for toppings and we never have leftovers!

OMG!  This is the best pizza ever. I don't know why I never thought about grilling pizza before.  I do not add the herbs and garlic into the dough.  After I punch down, I form small circles of dough for personal size pies.  I top with homemade sauce and whatever toppings the family wants.  We have made this about 10 times now and have passed on the recipe to everyone who has tried if.  Thank you so much!

Very good; the crust turned out really well; a lot better than the crust I normally make.  It was a little heavy from all the toppings, but worked with using two spatulas.

I have been wanting to try this for a while and glad I did.  This is the best crust and worth the time.  I mixed it in my KitchenAid mixer for a little over 4 minutes with the dough hook.  I think a few people said to brush the crust instead of the grill, good idea, it caused flare ups so I let them calm down and brushed the crust.  It took a little longer than I thought it would to cook though.  I had all 4 burners on high, the temp on the grill said 500 when I put it on and I left them on high.  I had everything ready in prep bowls to put on. I did close the lid and let it cook.  I wish I would have timed it but had time to do a few things while it cooked. I used canned pizza sauce with some fresh basil sprikled on and pepperoni and cheese for toppings this time as a test (I think I'll make a chicken alfredo next time for myself) and split the dough into 4ths.  I only did one and have froze the rest so I hope it will thaw and be just as good.  It reminds me a lot of Space Aliens crust (a local ND, MN chain) so that's great. I have a Pampered Chef LARGE grilling spatula (about 8 inches wide) that works great to move these. It's a perfect recipe for people who like different toppings and would be fun for a BBQ with friends.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have to admit that I don't follow the toppings.  I only use the recipe for the crust.  We grilled it over a low flame the second time and that worked better for us.  We use a pesto for the sauce and throw on whatever toppings we desire.  Our extended family raved about this pizza (and I believe the crust was a huge part of that compliment!) Thanks!

Awesome recipe!! Just like the last person I made four small pizzas, that made it easy to flip with one spatula.  Besides they fit on a regular plate when done, for easy serving.  Also, I found it helpful to turn down the fire on my gas grill while I placed the toppings on. I turned it up at the end to help melt the cheese.  One last note I pre-broiled my toppings with cooking spray to ensure they were not raw tasting.  Thanks for great recipes all the time.

I normally don't stray too far from a recipe's original instructions, but I'm just terrible at making dough so I cheated and bought a pre-made frozen pizza dough ball at the grocery store.  Followed the rest of the directions and it was fabulous!  Can't wait to make this when we have guests.  We're already thinking up all of the toppings we could try.  We live in the country, and there are a few pizza restaurants within driving distance, but none that we think are all that.  Will be making our own pizza from now on!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made the dough as written and it was fantastic!  The finished product rivals one of my favorite local boutique pizza places.  The only change we made was topping choices.  Was also very good with pesto instead of tomato sauce.  Thanks Doug!

We were very surprised how well this worked.  It's amazing how much better this tasted compared to pizza on a stone in the oven.

I tried this today and found it really easy, I as a little eager, so let it rise about 3 times, and it didnt hurt a bit. I loved someone else's tip about precooking the toppings and having it all ready to top the pizza once flipped. Looking forward to trying many different combo's of toppings. I am thinking left over tri tip with blue cheese and mushrooms...I will let you know.

Wow!  Great recipe!  I followed recipe as written except for the pizza toppings.  We made one pizza as pepperoni and green pepper  while the second was BBQ chicken with red onion and cilantro.

We did a "pizza party" last summer and we did it on the gas grill - we did personal sized for everyone-partially cooked dough - pulled off and everyone put on their own toppings - put back on grill - very low heat-to warm up toppings and melt cheese - OUTSTANDING!  The crust gets crusty on the bottom and it is just wonderful.  You must try this way to cook pizza.

Excellent recipe!  Who knew you can make pizza on the grill.  The crust was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I followed the crust recipe exactly except I used dried basil instead of fresh.  Also, we had the grill on low-medium heat, and that worked well for us.  We did take the crust off of the grill so that we wouldn't have to rush when we added the toppings.  We will definitely make this again!

I can't believe I waited this long to try this recipe.  Once you make pizza this way, you won't want to make it any other way.  I used a pizza peel to move the dough onto the grill.  This was such a fun recipe to make - we're definitely going to try this several more times throughout grilling season so that we can perfect it.  You really have to keep your eye on the dough - at high heat, it can burn quickly.  Will try lowering the heat (or even turning the grill off?) once we flip the dough. I also think we're going to try brushing the dough with the olive oil instead of the grill grates so as to avoid flareups. The taste is phenomenal! Thank you for posting this recipe!

I was a little nervous about making this pizza b/c i thought for sure it would stick to the grill. But I did oil the grill and dusted the dough with a little extra flour to keep it from sticking.  We used caramelized onion and pepper for the topping and didn't use any sauce, just cut up fresh tomatoes seasoned with oregano and basil.  Topped it with mozzarella and Parmesan and it was delicious. Tastes just like from a fancy gourmet restaurant.

This recipe is the newest family favorite!  We divided up the dough for individual pizzas and the family enjoyed creating their own.  We used our own sauce and also sprayed the grill with pam as another review suggested.  We also grilled chicken on the George Foreman grill while the dough was on the regular grill.  All the flavors were so good together.  I never heard of making pizza like this, I think its very creative and fun and would give this 10 stars if I could.

instead of pizza crust or pizza dough use two tortilla shells, one on top of the other... add your favorite ingredients, then grill 20 minutes

Great way to make plain pizza gourmet!  I love it with fresh mozzarella and basil.  It's easiest to put the crust in the oven for a minute or two, then put the crust on the grill and lastly put on all your toppings.

We split the dough into two pizzas, and cooked them on a small coal grill.  It took about 15 minutes on the first side, and 25 minutes on the second side to fully cook.  They were perfectly delicious!  The dough was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I made homemade pizza sauce with mushrooms in it, and that made the flavor great.  We put fresh tomatoes, olives, pineapple, feta, basil, and mozzarella on our pizzas.

Definitely five stars!  We top ours with different sauces - pesto, roasted red pepper spread, traditional tomato pizza sauce - and set out a variety of toppings including marinated mushrooms, sauteed onions, fresh pepper strips, sliced olives, and a variety of cheeses.  Great crowd pleaser!

The toppings were cooked before putting them on the pizza because of the other reviews.  It turned out great; the toppings were perfectly done.  The crust was delicious!

We really liked this pizza.  I need to get my technique down though.  It was a little bit of work to get it all together and get the toppings on the pizza while on the grill.

This was really good... it was 40 above here today, and I needed a good bbq recipe. I kept my heat on low- cuz i was worried about burning- (but I also bought the pizza crusts- which I won't do again- I'm gonna make the dough next time.)I added some leftover cooked, chopped chicken breast. I cooked my red peppers on the grill first, then chopped them. I added chiffonaded (sp?)spinach for the heck of it. I took a picture of it on the grill, and one afterwards. ONE suggestion- use pizza sauce- this recipe says tomato sauce, but its too bland. I sprinkled greek seasoning on, as I was out of Italian to boost that. But real pizza sauce would be a good thing to have. I WILL BE making this agian a few times. Thanks for the recipe!!

Tried this recipe this past weekend and it was a big hit with my friends! In lieu of the the recipe's sauce, I just used my homemade sauce I keep on hand. In addtion to the cheese, I used fresh tomato and basil from the garden... Margherita pizza is my fav! By the way, when brushing the grill grates, I substituted canola oil because it has a higher smoke point. Brushed the garlic infused EVOO for flavor per the recipes recomendation... Yum!

I have made this recipe twice now, the first time it was pretty darn good,  and the second time it was awesome!  I didn't use fresh basil, just the dried,  and it was quite tasty. My kids love it, and they are so fun to make. I also only let the dough rise once,  and it was perfect.

Not only was this incredibly delicious, but was also so much fun! Couple o' glasses of wine, grilling pizza under the stars - perfect "date" with the hubby!

This was a good idea that we may try again, but I won't make the crust so thick (3/8-1/2 inch). There was too much crust. The addition of the garlic and basil was great, though. It also needed a lot of cheese.

This was a good idea, but my dough didn't seem to turn out as well as I'd have liked. It was a bit heavy, but the grill did a great job!

I just made this pizza for my pizza "snob" boyfriend and boy howdy was he impressed!  He said it was better than the brick oven pizza place, which is high praise indeed.  Thank you for the great idea.  I only made one change and that was one of the pizzas I only topped it with pepperoni as that is all he will eat on it.  I will be making this on a regular basis and it is sooooo much better than just cooking it on a stone.

Very good crust.  Next time I'll try rolling it out thinner to achieve a thinner cooked crust.  Toppings can vary but the garlic and basil in the crust is fabulous - add more of both and be sure to get it all evenly distributed.  Will definitely make this again -

My family loved this!  I printed the recipe out a while ago but never made it until recently.  I guess I was a little worried.  It seemed like a lot of work and I had doubts about how it would turn out on the grill.  Finally, I tried it and it was great.  Definitely will be making this again soon!

It was really fun to grill pizza.  I think the sauce needs something to give it some more flavor though.  I used my built in counter top cutting board to transfer the dough and then the pizza, and it worked great.  We will definitly be making this one again.

This was great! I was amazed at how quickly that dough cooked. We adjusted the toppings to suit family preferences, but the dough itself needed no adjustment. It came out beautifully chewy and flavorful. Grilling it on high heat does mean you really need to watch it carefully to prevent burning. Perhaps people who had problems with burning were expecting it to take longer or made the pies too thick. We loved it. Thanks!

Dough was a little dry, I added a tad more oil. My family loved it!  It was so easy!  I couldn't imagine how it would work on the grill, but it was very easy.

The pizza base is especially great.  I made the dough in my breadmaker on DOUGH setting & cooked it in the oven, as I don't have one of those fancy BBQs...YUM.  If two pizzas are a bit much, you can freeze the other base once it is rolled out!
