Very easy to prepare!  I used medium hot salsa and the preserves cut the heat nicely.  I marinated the salsa mixture with the chicken overnight then baked it all together for about 45 min at 350 degress.  I then served the pan juices over the chicken.  YUMMY!  I can't wait to grill this when summer comes around.  Also, I used about 2 lbs of chicken and the sauce amount was plenty...

Excelent, made a entire fire station happy and even 2 cops that happened to stop in.  All the guys talked about it for weeks.  I used Apricot/Pineapple preserves and it was great.

FANTASTIC!  A great dish that's easy to prepare and so tasty!  Perfect for the summer w/ grilled veggies.  The whole family loves it!  Pound out the chicken breasts first for an extra tender bite!

I love this recipe.  Quick and easy and just the right combination of sweet and spicy.  I am a college student and made it on the stovetop , stirfrying the chicken and simmering with the salsa combination.

This was nice but to be fair I had to use my frying pan as my BBQ was out of propane so I don't think I got the full effect.  Still it was a pleasant sauce and I will try again with the BBQ.

Great recipe, I was totally pleased how flavorful this chicken is.  I used medium salsa and it gave the flavor a great kick!  Will definately make again.

I baked these for 45 minutes on 325 degrees. I followed the recipe exactly except in the last five minutes, added some mozarella cheese and it was great.

The flavor of this chicken was very nice, but it MUST be prepared on an open-flame grill. I tryed using it on a non-stick George Forman type grill, and while the chicken didn't stick, the sticky sauce mixture was TERRIBLE to try and clean off of the cooking surface!

Ok, I followed the recipe exactly except for the cooking method. I did the chicken on the Foreman grill, put it in a Pyrex dish, poured the salsa mixture on top, then put it in the oven at 350f til the sauce was obviously heated through. Yes, the chicken was a little bit dry, but it was extremely flavorsome. Thanks!

Great easy recipe! I used Montreal Steak seasoning vs. the Chicken (already had the steak seasoning on hand - how different could it be?) and used Orange Preserves instead of the Apricot. Still came out excellent! Thanks :)

Very tasty. I left out the chili because my boyfriend is a little heat sensitive. Nice recipe :)
