We thought this was pretty good---we love all the ingredients.  I did use butter rather than margarine and cremini mushrooms rather than white, but otherwise I followed the directions.  I wished that the sauce was a thicker one because for us it really depended on salt to help out the penne, which seemed to be almost bland.  I would suggest also that the mint was a must for this!   I would try tweaking the sauce a little, but I can see that for a summer lunch that this would be perfect!  Thanks for giving me ideas of what to do!
