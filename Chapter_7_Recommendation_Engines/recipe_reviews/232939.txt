Really as wonderful as it claims to be. I bet there is a way to do this in the slow cooker but as written it is 5 stars! Thank you for the recipe.

This soup is so good. I did make some changes to the recipe though. I donâ€™t like peppers or squash in soups so o left those out and I added some extra chicken boullion cubes and red pepper flakes for flavor. I am really pleased with how this turned out.

I found it bland.  There are really no spices in the recipe.  Any advice?  For my leftovers, I tried adding avocado, chopped green onions, and grated parmesan cheese on top.  It had  a little more flavor but still lacked the wow factor.

I am happy that everything in it is so healthy.
