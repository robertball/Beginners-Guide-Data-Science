I have celiacs disease, so in my opinion, these were awesome!  I served with a meal that had crab legs as the main dish, so they paired perfectly!  They were a bit more dense than what I remember the real Red Lobster biscuits being, but with gluten free flour (and depending what blend you use) that is to be expected.

These turned out great, but I used regular flour.  For brushing, I would, next time, use half the parsley flakes and 3 Tablespoons butter.  It was too much parsley for the topping, in my opinion  Otherwise I thought they were very good.

These were great!! We all thought that they we good. I used the "Namaste Perfect Flour Blend" and they turned out right. They were slightly dry, but I thought it made them taste better. 
  The one thing that I won't do next time, is the brushing. It made a great big parsley mush. But the biscuits taste great without it.

Did not like the flavor of these biscuits at all, tasted like gluten free flour.

I made these for dinner last night and they were liked by all. The only problem is they turned out a little gummy in the center. I had to add more milk( about a full cup). next time I try these i will add some baking soda as well. Still good for gluten free. my son-in-law is gluten intolerant and he loved them.

I recently had to go gluten free and was glad to see that I can make some of my favorite recipes.   I made these tonight to go with my homemade spaghetti, and they were a huge hit!!

I followed the recipe but was disapointed with the result. My biscuits turned out very dense and hard. Very good flavor though. Good for dipping in stew.

Turned out AWESOME! My entire family gobbled them up. I used Namaste GF flour blend, and I could tell the dough was a little dry so I added a few more tablespoons of milk than called for. I put all the garlic powder in the biscuits, and just dipped the biscuits in butter when they were still hot and they were PERFECT! We will be making these again.

I did not like this recipe at all. One cup of liquid was not enough -- I couldn't even roll the dough into balls. I added more liquid and I could make the dough stick together, but they cooked that way. I flattened the next batch, and they stayed that way. No rising. This recipe definitely did not work for me.
