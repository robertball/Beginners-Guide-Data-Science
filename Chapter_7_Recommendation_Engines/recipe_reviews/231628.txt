The ratio is completely wrong.  I had an enormous amount of the filling.  I would cut it in 1/4 the next time.  Also, I did not care for the crescent rolls.  The second night, since I had so much filling left over, I bought puff pastry.  A million times better.

I changed it up a little by adding Feta Cheese instead.  But overall, a good appetizer.

Tried this one yesterday and my picky 9 year old like it too. I did add some feta, left out the onions and used a LOT of fresh spinach. I'm sure this will heat up well today for lunch.

This was outstanding. I used red bell pepper and dried chicken broth , no other changes. Served over homemade rosemary bread toast.  Definitely a keeper.

I read the previous reviews so was forewarned that the proportions seemed wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly, but wondered if I had enough chicken.  The amount of ingredients were basically right for 3 cans of crescent roll dough.  However, cutting each can of dough into 4 rectangles to get 12 total rectangles with only 1 Tablespoon of filling was wrong.  I started with measuring out 1/4 cup or 4 Tablespoons of filling and found that I still had too much dough per puff.  I cut the remaining 2 cans of dough into 6 rectangles each and used 1/4 cup of filling for each.  This worked out to a much better proportion of filling to dough and used up all of the filling.  The end result was that I had enough 1/4 cups of filling to make 18 puffs about cupcake size instead of the 12 puffs stated in the recipe.  If I make this again, I might try cutting each sheet of dough into 8 rectangles and decreasing the filling to a scant 3 Tablespoons to make 24 puffs for more of an appetizer size.  Also, since not all chicken breasts are the same size, I looked at other recipes that recommended 2 cups of cooked chicken.  While the puffs were good, they were on the bland side and could use some more flavor.  The creamy ricotta and parmesan overpowered the chicken, spinach, onion and garlic.   Another recipe used 3 Tablespoons of fresh basil.  That might be enough for more zip without going overboard using spicier additions of peppers, etc.   I gave the recipe only 4 stars because of the poor

My daughter, who swore she hated spinach and wasn't going to eat them, LOVED them. These are so good and moist! I will probably tweak the recipe just a bit and add more fresh spinach next, only because it does cook down so much. I will definitely be making these again!!

This is a very tasty way to get my husband to eat his veggies. He loves this recipe! I always have leftover filling, so I've started freezing it and using it later.

Awesome recipe, although the bottom of the dough tends to not cook thoroughly unless you add a bit extra.

This was delicious. Simple to make, but does take some time. These would make very nice appetizers to bring to a pot luck get together if made in a smaller size puff.
Recipe alterations I made were adding water to the chicken and shredding it, using shredded swiss and Italian blend cheese with less ricotta, and adding chopped almonds and Kale along with the spinach.

After I acquired a Llama figurine recently, my son asked me to make spinach puffs to serve with the Llama, as a shout-out to one of our favorite movies, "The Emperor's New Groove". I found this recipe on AllRecipes and decided to give it a shot.  The recipe was easy, and the puffs turned out great!  Since the dough I used was for "Grands" biscuits, I think they turned out a bit larger than the recommended size, but they were still a hit. I had a hard time getting the rectangles into the cute ball shape, so I eventually made them in "pocket" shape, a more rectangular configuration, and it was much easier.  Also, due to the size of the dough the cooking time was closer to 20 minutes. Tip for next time: I will probably chop the spinach up into smaller pieces, rather than whole leaves. When the leaves were whole, it was harder to get a consistent mix in the batter. The leaves kept clumping together.  Also, I might try using ground meat instead of chopped up chicken breasts.  That said, it was still a good meal. My other son doesn't even like cooked spinach, but he liked this recipe!

I made these. Few things...I made 8 squares per package and they are still large for an appetizer. Also baked them at 375 as per the instructions for the Crescent roll package. Baked them for 15 to 16 minutes.

This recipe was a big hit. It does make a lot of filling. I had a good bit left over that was used for a pasta dish the next day. I did use puff pastry sheets instead of the crescents. The one change I would make is the temperature of the oven. 325 is not hot enough to brown the pastry.

Yummy.  I didn't have any crescent rolls so I put the mixture over a pillsbury pie crust and cooked it according to the pie directions.  It came out pretty good!

really good! I added garlic powder, salt and peppered the chicken while cooking,a pinch of cayenne, and used extra big croissants. I added extra filling and cook time because my puffs were bigger. Delicious!

Made with gluten free baking mix for a dinner party, pressed the dough into muffin pans, quite yummy
