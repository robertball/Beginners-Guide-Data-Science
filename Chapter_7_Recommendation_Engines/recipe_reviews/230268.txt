These are DELICIOUS! Made exactly as written (aside from halving the recipe) and would not change a thing...really great flavor! I served these w/ sour cream, but they really didn't need anything. These are a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Well who knew anything latke could be as good as potato pancakes but...these are mighty fine!  I was not sure what purpose the white sugar had so I omitted it adjusted cayenne to my own taste and left out the pepper only because I don't care for it. These tasted like candy for a veggie!  This will be a repeat recipe for sure and thankyou to the person who posted it. For those of you new to making things like this the secret is to spread the "pancakes" as thin as possible by squishing and spreading them thin with the back of a spoon. Flip them when they are lightly browned then remove them to a warming spot once the second side is brown. If they do not hold together you either need a bit more egg or cook them longer. The mixture should be lightly sloppy with some puddling of liquid in the bottom in the bowl. Anything like this takes time to cook but is well worth it.

These are absolutely delicious!  I make these as written and they turned out perfect.  I wasn't sure about putting curry powder and cumin in sweet potatoes, but it was just the right amount to create an interesting, flavorful bite.  I even liked the leftover ones cold the next day.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I'll definitely be making them again soon.

Tasted great! I accidentally added an extra 1/4 tsp of cayenne but it turned out well, with the added kick! 3-5 minutes per side was too long for me, they start to burn rather quickly and don't need all that time to cook through. Also, disclaimer - I didn't measure out cups of sweet potatoes, I just used 2 med-large.

We have some people in the house who aren't a fan of spicy food, so when we made it, we made the following alterations and it came out WONDERFUL!

Omitted the Cayenne Pepper entirely, substituted the tablespoon of Curry Powder with an extra 1/4 teaspoon of Cumin, a 1/3 teaspoon of Turmeric, and a 1/4 of Ginger.

Sounded so good, but not to my liking. I only used 1/2 the white sugar, but it was still too sweet for me. Wasn't excited about the other flavor combinations either. Won't make again.

Loved these.  The spice quantities were perfect.  They tasted a little tiny bit spicy, a tiny bit sweet, and the flavor of the sweet potatoes was not overpowered.  I halved the recipe and it made 15 small latkes.  3 seem to be a good serving size, so for me half a recipe made 5 servings.  Since the crispiness is a big part of the appeal, I don't think that you want leftovers.  I experimented with cooking temperature, and found that (on my -electric-ugh- stove), medium to medium high made the most delectable latkes.  Per the author's instructions, make them small and be sure to flatten them out.  This will permit a somewhat higher temperature that results in crispiness.  I tried 4-5 minutes per side on a lower temp and then 3 minutes or less per side on a higher temp, and greatly preferred the 3-minute version.  Thank you for this recipe.

Soooo goooood!!! Made exactly as written, but with a little less cayenne to appease the little ones. Everybody loved them, and this will likely become a new regular.

Yum!

So delicious! Caution: amount of cayenne may be too spicy for some people so cut it down if that is the case for your family. I thought it was perfect.
