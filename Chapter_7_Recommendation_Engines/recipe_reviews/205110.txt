Dang! This is great! Don't shy from this one. I didn't want to mess around when company was here, so I did the crusts ahead of time. I did NOT use high heat - kind of mediumish. About 15 minutes before dinner time, I put the crusts back on the grill, brownest side down for a couple of minutes, flipped 'em, and dressed them, closed the lid. Let 'em cook till cheese melted. Since a large crust would not manage easily (flipping, etc.), I made four small pizzas, about 10-12 inches out of a bread machine recipe that used 4 !/2 cups flour. That allowed me to make four different kinds of pizza (regular; meat lovers; vegetarian; and best of all, salsa, jalepeno, black olives, cheese). Cut them in 6 or 8 pieces so folks can try them all. Next on my list - Reuben pizza - recipe on this site. And dessert pizza. Don't be afraid of the grill. I even bake cakes, homemade mac and cheese, etc. on the grill (place long cooks and fragile stuff on pizza stone to break the direct heat). Maybe the best part of the grill is the cleanup (no dishes!)

This is AWESOME! I never heard of putting pizza dough on the grill. I even used package pizza crust and it still tasted delicious. The crust did not stick like I expected it to and the grill gave it a great flavor! We will probably be making this in my house weekly throughout the summer!

Made for a change of pace to our typical "grill" faire and this was a HIT!  Had various toppings set up (added fresh asiago, roasted red peppers, sausage, smoked chicken, artichokes, sun-dried pesto, etc...) and let everyone top their own.  My whole family raved about the crust and had fun making their own designer pizzas.  This one is a keeper!!!

I've never actually used the dough recipe as intended. I had the feeling to use it as a meat pocket and dinner roll recipe in an oven. May I say, both were fantastic. Just make it as you would normally, and as a meat pocket, flatten it out stuff it a bit, seal and bake at 350. Takes about 20 or so minutes. But if you like the bread soft, about 15. The crisper and harder, longer.  Rolls, just into desired shape and size and bake. 15 min, or longer depending how you like it.  A little out there, but I haven't bought bread for 2 weeks because of this. It's way cheaper and tastier for me to just make rolls or loaves out of this. Just throw in seeds or other things into it. It's great to not have to wait for it to rise.  But I still make bread the old fashion way sometimes. It tastes way better. But if I don't have time, this is a great replacement.

We had a blast making pizzas on the grill here in Seattle on Sunday evening! We used a pizza sauce recipe Shari had gotten from Frank & Marlene Muckenhirn in Delano, MN years ago for pizza #1, added fresh toppings & cheese, followed the grilling instuctions, & had a very successful first attempt. For pizza #2, we made fresh pesto sauce from our garden, added toppings, & this version was incredible as well! For #3, we combined sauces, added sun dried tomates & pablano peppers, cheese, & yum yum - it was wonderful as well! We did assembly line pizzas - fun and delicious!

I've never grilled a pizza crust before and have to say I'm surprised at how delicious this turned out! It was so soft and crusty. I did make my dough ahead of time and left it in the fridge. About 20 minutes before I began grilling, I took out the dough and let it thaw/rise a bit. I grilled this on my George Foreman (the panini press type) I just left the top up and then put it down during the last minute of cooking. It worked perfectly! I used this dough as the base for Chicken Fajita Grilled Pizzas (recipe also on this site) and it was such a perfect combination. I'll definitely be using this dough often.

Just lovely and terribly easy to make for this novice baker and master griller. I added a good amount of Italian spices to give it a little depth and compliment the toppings I used.

I've done pizza on the grill for a while now! definitely the best way to do it and an amazing thin but firm crust. This past summer we actually had a BBQ pizza party and had all the toppings on a "tier" and quickly grilled the pizza dough, everyone topped there own and had there own individual pizza. The taste is sooo unique!

Perfect recipe for outdoor entertaining.  Kids LOVE to make their own mini pizza creations. We topped our pizzas with grilled veggies from the garden. Lots of fun!

WOW. I will  never make pizza in the oven again! I have finally perfected my pizza with this recipe- after about a year of trying, and MANY pizzas!
FOR ANYONE WORRIED ABOUT IT STICKING!! That was m y biggest fear as well, but as long as you follow the directions, use flour when rolling it out and brush with oilve oil before you put it on the gril you'll have NO problem. The flavor the crust gets from the gril is amazing!

So delicious we ate it two nights in a row. The only chant we made was using an olive oil/garlic mix to brush on the dough, instead of regular oil, to give the dough a little garlic flavor. Super quick and easy to make!!

Great recipe! I didn't grill it, but placed the rounds of dough under the broiler for 5 min or so (I shaped two 10" rounds from half of the dough - the other half is in the fridge for the next time a pizza craving strikes!) :-) once they were lightly browned (I pricked the dough with a fork to make sure it didn't bubble up) I removed them and let them cool slightly - at this point they were just like the boboli store-bought prebaked pizza dough. Once they cooled a bit I added our toppings and put back in the oven at 425 for 10 -15 minutes. Perfection!!! We like a flatbread type pizza, and this was just right!!! Love it! This will be our go-to quick pizza dough recipe (the consistency of the dough is just like the refrigerated dough we love from Trader Joe's!). This summer I will definitely have to try the grilling method, I am sure that is fantastic too!

The pizza wasn't too good but the dough was excellent for making tortas, fry bread, or tortillas. I grilled the dough with my George Forman and that worked well.

Loved this!!  I used rapid rise yeast because pizza crust yeast wasn't available locally.  If you're in a real hurry, grab some premade crusts from the supermarket and jump right in.  If you're like me, however, you'll find that the crust is so easy that you may not need to buy frozen dough prepared crusts, or pizza crust mix again.  The crust recipe is suitable for both the grill and the oven.  The family really enjoyed assembling their own pizzas with the toppings that I provided.  The little pies were ready in a flash and didn't stick at all.  The dough circles turned to ovals when I picked them up, so I quickly learned to stretch the sides back out into circles as I laid them on the grill.  I can't wait to try this again.  If I feel brave enough, I might make these for my son's poolside birthday party this summer.

this recipe turned out okay. The crust is a little bland though. I have a better recipe for crust that I may modify and try out.

This is basically the delicious, easy recipe on the Fleischmann's Pizza Crust Yeast packet, but grilling it adds such a nice flavor and texture! I did it on a gas grill, doubled the recipe, and quartered the dough to make 4 pizzas. I also added a little Italian seasoning, garlic granules, and a pinch of onion powder to the dough. Totally delicious! Fire up that grill!

This worked out really well.  I decided to make this on a whim though once and my grill ran out of gas...so, I decided to try it in my cast iron skillet.  It turned out great!  I just made the pizza a plain cheese, but think other tippings would probably be ok too.

TEN STARS!  I made the dough with regular Fleischmann's Yeast but followed everything else.  I prepared Easy Pizza Sauce I from this site which we've made before.  Formed two pizzas and left the remaining dough in balls for the freezer (I froze the leftover sauce too!).  We had fun making our own pies and loved using the grill.  If you like a crispy pizza this is it!

Fun, easy and tasty! Not hard at all..so don't shy from this one. The crust isn't very flavorful but it has a nice consistency. I will just add seasoning to the crust next time.

This dough was easy to make, and our pizzas turned out delicious.  What a great way to let everyone make their own pizza.  We followed the steps of grilling one side, topping that grilled side, and then grilling the other side.  Worked great, no sticking to the grill.  My kids are already asking for this for dinner again.  This would be a great dinner for a party, if you were able to pre-make all of the dough.  Love it!

Oh yeah! It's like the wood fired pizzas from an authentic Italian pizzeria. Used shortcut dough from the market and spent the time grilling some zucchini, mushroom, onions and red peppers for topping. Used pesto and romesco sauces. Love whats possible on a charcoal grill!

We've tried numerous times to grill pizza and this was actually successful for the most part. The dough turned out great and held together well for handling during the grill process. We had some cooking time issues but that may be the result of using a tabletop Weber grill instead of a full sized one. We were not able to adjust the distance from the heat and our crusts were cooking much too quickly and the first one burned with the 3 minute time for side one. The cheese wasn't getting melted in the center and only the edges were really cooked with this method and I ended up microwaving to finish it off. The crust turned out soft and doughy and rose nicely and was great for holding the toppings and it was bread like and soft. We prefer a crispy thin pizza so we'll go back to the oven method but this actually did work for us once we got the timing issues resolved. We were hoping to duplicate a wood fired oven/brick oven taste but this did not accomplish that goal. I think we will give this another try.

After reading several recipes, we followed the grilling directions of this one.  The pizzas were a hit!  We used our standard homemade dough for a 16" med. crust pizza, divided into 6 parts and made mini pizzas.  3 had red sauce, 3 had pesto sauce, all had chicken, 2 had sauted shredded zuchinni, 2 had dried tomatoes.  The pizzas w/ zuchinni were fabulous!  Pizzas w/ chicken and sauce were good.  The outer edges of crusts w/ chicken and dried tomatoes were a bit crisp - will try cooking 2 min (not 3) then adding toppings.  Will definitely use the grilling recipe again.

Loved making this recipe!  Our family had fun standing out at the grill watching our creations melt and look better by the minute and then promptly devouring them.  This may be a new favorite for this summer.

Perfect! We have been trying to grill pizza all summer with other dough recipes and it was dry and bland. This recipe is perfect for the grill and pizza has never tasted better. It was crispy on the outside and chewy and moist on the inside. We made four small pizzas because they are easier to handle than one large pizza and it was perfection!

Good recipe for basic pizza dough.  The dough is nice and pliable - and not as easy to tear as other doughs that I've made.

The crust was a good blank slate but doesn't have much flavor on it's own. I'll keep this in mind for next time and add more flavorful toppings. The crust that was rolled thinner worked better for me (about 1/8"). It was in the style of punch pizza.

Perfect recipe.  You can use any kind of dry yeast...I couldn't find any specific "pizza dough" yeast.  I tested it on just my wife and me in preparation for a 4th of July cookout, and this definitely is going on the menu.  Thanks!

This is really good. We love the crust. We don't really think grilling them makes them taste any better. Next time we'll just make right in the oven.

The dough recipe is on point!  Since we ran out of gas I popped these in the oven at 375 instead.  Same process, cook on one side till 75% done, remove, flip, add toppings and bake till "done".  In my opinion, the dough should be rolled out to a very thin consistency, that's how you achieve a thin and crispy crust.  I used Hunts Tomato Paste w/basil, garlic and oregano and that is what really made these things pop.  Also, we had extra dough, so we rolled it out into a big rectangle, pressed a knife into the dough to create "breadsticks", drizzled olive oil, rubbed minced garlic all over and topped with cheese.  Awesome with the tomato paste too!

the smell when the dough hits the grill is amazing.  don't forget to grill before adding toppings.  first one made a big gooey mess because I didn't read.

Turned out really well.  We had to put the pizza on the top rack to melt the cheese first, then move it down to finish off the crust.  Delicious.

I had an BBQ pizza party. Everyone loved it! I made each person in the group their own individual sized pizza and each had their own choice of toppings. They turned out great! I had never made pizza dough before but was much easier than I thought. Will do this again and again.... Thanks for the great idea!!

LOVE this recipe! Have been using it for years now.  I make the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe from this site for these.  The flavor of charcoal grilled crusts is superb.  I could even eat them plain.  Grilled pizza is our #1 family favorite supper now.  Thank you!

This recipe is perfect! I split into 6 pizzas instead of 8, so that our pie were a little larger. We made all different types including green pepper/ onion/ turkey pepperoni, cheese/ basil, garlic/ basil/ fresh tomato, sausage/ turkey pepperoni, etc. they were all so amazing! We re-oiled the bottom of the pizza before putting on the grill the second time, and kept our pizzas on longer so they were more crispy. This will be a regular meal on our house!

Excellent recipe! I used half whole wheat and half white, and the dough was perfect. Great for us people who love to break out the grill. I just used sauce, mozz. cheese and pepperoni. Everyone in the family was asking for seconds, so I had to grill some more. Thanks for the recipe!

SO good!! I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of plain olive oil I brushed the dough with a combo of olive oil, garlic olive oil and harissa olive oil. It gave such amazing flavor and a bit of heat!

I followed the recipe and prep/grilling instructions, though I did use spelt flour (my preference) with some dried herbs in the crust, and let the bread machine do the heavy lifting. I grilled on the BBQ with a grill mat. The recipe made 3 smaller pizzas, each with 4 piece servings. I don't think I would grill one side first next time. The crust puffed up into a flatbread without the weight of the toppings to make it more like pizza crust. Good recipe, but next time I will just put it on the grill with the toppings.

This pizza is the bomb. I usually make it on the grill and I follow the recipe pretty closely and it always is phenomenal. This time I didn't realize grill was outta gas so did in the oven - broiled the crust as another reviewer suggested for about 4-5 minutes. 

Made larger pizzas doing these in the oven - I made 4 total: 1 cheese, 1 pepperoni w/ fresh tomatoes & mushrooms, 1 garlic & artichoke, & 1 garlic & artichoke with anchovies and other stuff that my stepdaughter added to make it uniquely her own. Baked for @7-8 minutes in 425 degree oven. This is something I get requests for a lot.

One of my favorite recipes on here. It's a hit with the family and reminds us of the local Italian restaurants' pizzas. I make it as often as I can!

The dough/crust was wonderful.  If using veggies, its good to pre-cook them.  We grilled some mushrooms.  Olives did well chopped and the cheese melted with them nicely.  Great experience making these.  I'm a kitchen klutz and even I could do this!

Excellent, and lots of fun for entertaining a family with kids at various stages of culinary sophistication.  The grilled dough worked like a charm.

This crust was so easy to throw together and tasted delicious. My family loved it on the grill. I may never make another pizza in the oven.

This is a delicious crust.  I made 1/2 recipe and grilled 1 small pizza and saved the remaining dough in the refrigerator.  I think the dough stored in the fridge for a few days was even better.  Easy to work with and great texture.

This pizza is so very easy to make and very tasty!! My kids had so much fun making their own personal pan pizzas. We will be making these all summer long! So nice to have something different to make on the grill. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Really really good. Used kitchen aid and rapid rise yeast. Divided into 2 pizzas. Used Classico sauce and seasoned sausage (3/4 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp salt, 1:4 tsp of each fennel and garlic salt.). Sprinkled garlic salt, oregano and basil on crust. Try with four cheese margueritta toppings

This is an excellent recipe.  We have been making this specific recipe for a few years.  It is easy and tasty.  I like using it when we have company, so everyone can create their own masterpiece.  My own favorite is cubed grilled chicken, basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and a bit of olive oil.  My only suggestion is to be careful of how large you roll the dough--they may be the right size for a hungry teenager, but a little too big for most!  I highly recommend this.

Crust was VERY easy to work with! I used olive oil in the crust and brushed both sides of the crust with olive oil mixed with garlic paste & dipping herbs. I used my Primo ceramic grill (much like the Egg only bigger) Next time I will make sure the heat is a bit lower before putting the dough on. Had a few darker than I liked but fixed the problem by placing my pizza stone on before cooking the second side with the toppings. Will be making this recipe for years to come!

Easy to make.  We had a build your own pizza night.  We had everything from traditional pepperoni to basil mushroom artichoke and even buffalo chicken.  Delicious!
