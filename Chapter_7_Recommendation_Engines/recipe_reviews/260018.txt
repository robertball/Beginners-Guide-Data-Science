Made as written except for substituting vanilla almond milk for water. I offered this to a couple Mexican friends who politely declined since they didn't like it. I insisted they give it a try, and they ended up drinking the entire batch and asking for the recipe.   First time trying this wonderfully refreshing and tasty drink. Going to grab a glass while I go back to cleaning my nut bag. Another superb addition to Chef John's great recipe collection!

This was yum! Very easy to make also. I used Ceylon (Sri Lankan) cinnamon and OMG it was so very fragrant and delicious - made all the difference. I did add some powdered milk to make it more creamier. Needs to be sieved well or it sediments at the bottom.

This is very easy and wonderful.  Have made this both the quick way and the overnight version.  Both are the same excellent drink.  Been looking for the right Horchata and this is definitely it.
