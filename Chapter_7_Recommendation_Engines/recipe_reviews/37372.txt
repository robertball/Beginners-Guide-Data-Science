You got to ad some more ingredients to this recipe if you want it to taste good. Like the following: chopped smoked sausage, pickled pork, a chopped onion, more garlic, a little cayenne pepper, some chopped bell pepper, a little salt and a couple of bay leaves. Now we're talkin good!!

I cut this recipe down to 3 servings.  It was flavorful, but way too peppery for me.  A little butter would have helped too.

This recipe was a pretty good recipe.  I did have to add a few bayleaves, celery, onion, bell pepper, garlic, and a little more seasoning to make it my own... but it turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.

In the south (Alabama)  we usually use larger pieces of ham in our butterbeans.  But, I liked the way the small diced ham looked in the butterbeans.  This will be the general guideline I will use when cooking butterbeans in the future.  I also liked using a leaner pork instead of the traditional fatty pieces.  This was a very good, basic recipe for southern butterbeans.

My husband doesn't eat many veggies, but he loved this recipe.  It was really easy to prepare and it was very good!
