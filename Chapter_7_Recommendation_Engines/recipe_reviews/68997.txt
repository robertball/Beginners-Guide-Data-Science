I am not a but fish fan but one my hubby's friends at work keeps giving us trout so I decided to give this a whirl (and my freezer is getting filled). I didn't really eat it but my father and step mother loved it. They thought the garlic flavor was outstanding. I gave them 5 big fish and they ate them all. So, this deserves a five.

I have made this twice this month.  The 2nd time I made it, I put the chopped jalapeno, garlic salt & the pepper inside the trout.  The trout is tender and delicious!

This was a great idea! the fish turned out perfectly. I added a sprig of rosemary and a sprig of basil inside the fish, and instead of the butter, I used olive oil...yum!!

I used a salmon fillet for this recipe, rubbed the butter on it, then the spices then the remaining toppings.  Turned out good.

Great!! I used this recipe on my backpacking trip last week. After combining all of the ingredients, I wrapped the trout in foil and placed it on the hot coals from our campfire. My friend said it was the best trout he ever tasted and I agree. Thanks for the recipe.

I used about half an onion for four trout and bottled lemon juice. We didn't have any jalapenos so we left that out. This was to die for and I am not crazy about fish.

Excellent. I didn't have jalapeno so I used a spray of tabasco. Also added a dash of vegetable seasoning and kept the garlic whole instead of mincing. A tip: instead of juicing the lemon, slice it and stuff halved slices inside the fish with the other stuff. Remember to spray with lemon on the outside too. YUM.

This was a super easy recipe to put together for my boyfriend.  I followed the recipe exactly and in the end, my boyfriend said that he couldn't taste any of the garlic.  Apparently, it was over shadowed by the jalapenos.  I don't like trout, but my man really does and next time, I will be tweaking the recipe a bit. I am going to double up on the garlic.  Half the garlic will be sauteed with the jalapenos and onions, along with some parmesan cheese and a tbsp of butter.  When I place the trout in the foil, I will place the sauteed mixture on top and allow to dribble off the fish.  Then, I will place the required butter and the other half of the garlic, which I will have crushed, on top of the trout and then I'll wrap it all up neat and tidy in the foil packet and bake for the 25 minutes that you suggested. Hopefully, that will make him happier...and thank you so much for this recipe...it has great potential to build off of!

I like the recipe..I don't usually add a Hot Pepper to a garlic recipe..but I have tried some jalopena's over the past two weeks..and they usually reveal their taste when chewed..so I placed one whole-jalopena in my small Food Processor/and blended it w/Veg. Oil..I strained the oil and used the crushed pepper in a tomato sauce..the Veg. Oil I would use on such a recipe as KRAZY Garlic Trout/the HOTness was medium to hot.

This was my first time cooking trout.  It turned out great.  Even all three of my kids ate it which is a miracle in itself.  My seven year old even had seconds.  I would definately make this again.

this was just okay for us. the flavor just wasn't what i expected, considering how much garlic was in there. i did like the ease of using the foil packets, and it kept the fish very moist. it was very easy for the skin to just peel right off

This rainbow trout was the best I've ever had!  I don't care for peppers so I left it out and it was still wonderful, tender and flavorful from the onion and garlic.  I did sprinkle flavored Italian breadcrums inside and out and sprayed the fish with "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter".  After baking, I broiled the fish on low for 2 minutes just to make it a bit crispy.  Thanks Krazy for an easy and delicious recipe!

Fish had a good combination of flavors,but maybe could of had a pinch more kick to it. That could have been my fault though because I didn't see the jalapeno listed until I was in the middle of making it.

This was so good, I had two trout, and this recipe was a perfect way to cook it in the oven. Didn't change anything except my trout was whole so I had to cut off the head and tail and left the bones in.  Still was great.

I give this recipe a five because the flavor was absolutely delicious..... at first. The only thing I changed was to add a little rosemary to the inside of the fish.  Even though I give this recipe a 5..... Me and my family decided we don't like trout. The fish left a strange after taste in our mouths that we can only conclude came from the fish itself. The three huge fish I cooked were fresh caught that same day so I know it wasn't that the fish were bad. It tasted delicious at first. Everyone in the house said the same thing. "It tastes delicious." The flavor was amazing. Actually I was very proud of myself since this was the first time I ever cooked or even TASTED trout and the same was true for my guests.  An hour or two after we ate... we all where saying the same thing again... "what is that funky taste in my mouth?"  I didn't even want to try trout, but everything I read on this site said it was the same as any other white fish.... It isn't.  It's good at first... but even as I am writing this... I can still taste the aftertaste... and I DON'T LIKE IT.  Of course this is coming from someone who never tasted trout before so if you already know what trout tastes like then I'm sure you will love this recipe.  As I said earlier... I give this recipe a 5 because the flavor was absolutely wonderful and at first bite I thought I discovered something new that I could add to my recipe box. If you already know what trout tastes like then I am sure this will be true for you.  For

Similar to what I have been doing just winging it, but liked having the oven temp&time. Fish turned out great, although I didn't use the jalepeno, we like fish on the plain side, but will add some kick when I use the leftovers in future meals.

Suprisingly tasty. I find that most recipies call for so much lemon that it overwhelms the dish, but that was not the case with this recipie. It is perfect as written.

Everyone loved this!  I have some spicy-sensitive people in my household so I used fresh cilantro instead of jalapeno and it was still fantastic.

Great base recipe!  I added a few sprigs of rosemary in place of the jalapeno pepper.  Since I used salmon filets, I sliced the lemon and laid it on top of the filets.  Definitely will be making this again!

Good but not great.  I used filets instead of whole trout so toppings were not in but on top;  otherwise i cooked everything according to the recipe.  I think the butter was not necessary will sub with olive oil next time (if there is one).  Seemed like a lot of work for an ok result.

I used sliced lemon and sliced garlic and it tasted fantastic.

WOW! I despise fish in any form! But I made this for my husband and in return, he made me try a bite of this. I was shocked! It was fantastic and will make it every time he catches trout. Only difference is, next time I will make one for myself too! I changed nothing but, my husband had already filleted and skinned the fish, so I just put the mixture on one fillet and covered it with the other.

This was just so-so.  If I made this again, I would add much more garlic!

Turned out kind of bland.  Will try it again, though, and maybe put some more stuff inside the fish cavity.

It was okay.  It was quite lemony.  I think I just prefer fish to be prepared anyway except baked.
