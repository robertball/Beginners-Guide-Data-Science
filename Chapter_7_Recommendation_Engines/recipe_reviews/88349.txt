We have really enjoyed this recipe. It's fast and EXCELLENT. If you use frozen shrimp, make SURE to defrost and pat dry before using in the sauce or else you'll get a pretty watery sauce. Thank you for the great recipe!

I've been making a version of this for years. I got it from Ina Garten (Barefoot Contessa). I use 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice and a 'glug' of white wine, plus Italian parsley. Make sure you add the garlic only after you add the lemon juice/wine. Otherwise if you saute it with the shrimp, it will burn and there is nothing worse than burned garlic. For the pasta, I  have made it with angel hair, regular spaghetti, and linguine and prefer linguine over all the others. It stays separated and doesnt turn into a big pasta glob. I also add several thin slices of lemon and fresh grated parmesan for presentation. It is absolutely one of my favorite dishes to make and only takes a few minutes to cook. It is excellent! Note: dont skip the step of soaking your shrimp in the salt water. It cleans them really well resulting in very fresh tasting shrimp.

So Lemony, so garlicky, so wonderful!  I cheated and skipped the brining.  I used frozen, raw, peeled & deveined shrimp which the package touted was "prepared with sea salt," so I thought that was good enough!  For the sauce, I did cut the butter back a little and only used 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes (plenty hot for us!).  I also added 1/2 tsp. kosher salt.  For the lemon juice and zest, it's basically the juice and zest of one lemon.  I served this over whole wheat spaghetti.  It was excellent and I highly recommend this recipe!

This dish is excellent and I added a few of the recommendations from other fellow reviewers...used 4Tsp. of Fresh Minced Garlic,& Juice and Zest of (1) Lemon. I also did a little spin of my own and added (1) Tsp. of cornstarch at the very end of cooking just to thicken it up a bit and it turned out So Good! Gave enough body to cling well to the Pasta...Oh and I only used 8 oz. of Pasta vs. the #1 Suggested. Did not have fresh shrimp used frozen still very good, and cayenne pepper...no flake on hand....also only had orzo pasta and it went well....Trust this recipe and Bon Apetite!

Yummm...tastes just like a dish I would order at a restaurant.  I omitted the red pepper and did not brine the shrimp due to time.  But it was still excellent.  Next time I will add more shrimp.

We'd give it a 5 Star, but I'd omitted crushed red chili flakes.  Very light lemon flavoured sauce.  I was worried that the thin-as-water sauce would cause angel hair pasta (nearly 1/2 a box) to taste 'watered-down' when tossed in pan of sauce & shrimp, but it didn't (was delicious), so added the remaining cooked pasta.  Used 1.5# frozen raw 31/40 count shrimp (and ingredient measurements as recipe stated for 2# of shrimp).  We're fans of garlic so next time I'll use 4-5T because 3T didn't 'stand-out' for us.  Brined in sea salt for five hours, but didn't notice a difference between brining or not brining---however we rarely cook shrimp so I wouldn't know good from better ;^)  Used 2T butter and a liberal drizzle of olive oil--both were more than enough so next time I'll use even less.  Now that I know what to expect from/flavours of this dish...in the future I'll add veggies such as snow peas, thinly sliced bell pepper (red, orange, or yellow--green may be too tough/strong in flavour)and/or swiss chard in lieu of parsley.  As stated in review preceding mine...the lemon zest and juice was one lemon.

This is a good recipe but I didn't give it 5 stars because 1) I had to reduce the pasta to 8 ox for the amount of sauce. 2) The recipe needs salt.  The amount of garlic, lemon and lemon juice is just right but I used the same measurements for the sauce for 1 lb shrimp and 1/2 lb pasta.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good sauce. I did add salt at Baking Nana's suggestion but that's a personal preference. I also always make more sauce than a recipe calls for but, again, a personal preference. I plan to use this sauce with chicken, too. Really very good.

this was very yummy, my husband and i really enjoyed it.  very good recipe but we did make some modifications.  we used about 40% of the pasta recommended as there was not enough sauce.  we also skipped brining the shrimp and instead added salt to taste.  we also added some granulated garlic in addition to the fresh garlic to add more flavor.  we skipped on the lemon zest out of pure laziness and added just a dash of wine to the sauce.  we then added dried parsley and black pepper directly into the sauce.  after the sauce was complete, we went and ahead and tossed the sauce with the garlic in a pan to evenly coat the pasta.  i can't wait to make it again!

I had scallops, not shrimp, but I wanted to use this sauce and it was a hit at my house. I added whatever else I had, which today was snow peas and fresh sliced mushrooms. We loved the white wine/lemon ratio.

I used a bow tie noodle. After reading the reviews about cooks only using 1/2 the pasta because there wasn't enough sauce, I  made more sauce (quantity for 8) and still used a full pound of pasta. The sauce lacked body and had a greasy mouth feel to it.

Kids loved it! They said my favorite line, "Mommy, I love your dinner!", so that made my day. I accidentally bought a 2 lb bag of cooked "shrimp meat" instead of raw shrimp, so they were very small, but it was still a good meal. Will make again soon!

This recipe was very easy and very quick to prepare.  My husband LOVED it, as did I.  It will be great for summer, as well as, a meal you can impress guests with any time.  This will definitely be a frequent meal in our household.  However, I feel 16oz of pasta is a bit to much you might want to reduce the pasta to 8-10oz unless you increase the the ingredients for the sauce to accommodate the 16oz.

This needs a lot more flavor to be a good recipe.  As is, there's way too many noodles and not much else.  The butter, the wine, even the hot pepper aspect gets lost.  I'm sorry I didn't enjoy this as much as others who have tried it, but I couldn't justify any higher rating on something so bland.  It takes a lot to get my family to not like shrimp dishes, but this did it.

This dish has a delicious garlic lemon zing, along with just a little heat from the cayenne. My husband requests it often!

I liked the recipe I adjusted it so it would reflect dinner for one. I think I might have added to much butter therefore it seemed a little greasy but all in all it is pretty good. I will be making this again.

Great recipe but I will use less lemon juice next time.  The kids loved it but commented that it needed less lemon.  We'll definitely be making this one again.

I'm another one that skipped the brining (sorry), but still LOVES the recipe.  (And it's QUICK!)  The only other thing I did differently was to use some freshly squeezed lime on the pasta (because I had no more lemons).  It gave it a bit more of a kick.  My family loved this and I plan to make it again.  (Thought the idea of adding a bit of fresh broccoli was worth trying too!  Thanks!)

This was delicious but I doubled the wine, butter & spices as the recipe looked rather dry. I wish I had actually tripled the wine etc....to give this recipe a little more sauce to go with it. Other wise delicious.

Loved this...even my husband - generally not one to try something new - loved it!!  I think, next time I will use less salt when brining the shrimp.  Just a little too salty for our tastes.

I'll start by saying I think I messed this one up a bit. I put in way too much pepper. But by the end of the meal I was kinda glad I did. I kept trying to imagine the dish with less pepper and I just didn't see it having much flavor. Even though I did screw up, I don't think I would make this again. I am still giving this 3 stars though, just because I feel it is unfair or me to score it too low since I made a mistake

I made this for a gathering at my house and it turned out great! Tripled the ingredients and used about 2 1/2 of the 8oz packs of pasta. I added a chopped onion and used fresh chopped basil and it was yummy! I didn't brine the shrimp but instead let them sit with 2 tblsp of creole seasoning while i cooked everything else down and added the shrimp the last few min.

Excellent recipe to build on - very forgiving of alterations, additions or modifications to suit your taste. I use only 1 lb of shrimp and add vegetables with the butter and garlic: squash ribbons, peas, or broccoli crowns. And I always add a large handful of parmesan cheese to top! Lovely and fast.

These shrimp were outstanding....so good that we ate them without any pasta and I just served mashed potato and a salad for the accompaniment as we had had pasta 4 nights this week. I did not soak them in the brine. Instead I put them in the fridge to thaw the day before and then I added water and kosher salt for just a few minutes while I removed the tails. Very delicious shrimp. I used double the amount of garlic and sprinkled generously with parsley

Yummy!  Skipped the brining since I was doing this right away for dinner.  Doubled the sauce.  Fresh flavored because of the lemon ~ delicious.

I love making this when my husband and I are looking for a nice dinner date at home, it tastes just like a dish at my favorite restaurant and my husband loves this! I haven't brined the shrimp, but it still tastes great. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it really is wonderful!

Really easy and good. Did not brine. For sauce,  I added 1T chicken bouillon and 1T cornstarch to thick, then cooked shrimp in sauce. Tossed some sugar snaps at end made it a tasty meal in 15 minutes.

This was very nice! I added frozen spinach, used fresh parsley and added some fresh oregano as well. In addition to the shrimp I used some fresh sea scallops. I overcooked the spinach a bit but in general the whole dish was very good. Easy, quick and tasty recipe..will keep this one around!

I made this with 12 ounces of linguine, skipping the brining process. I used 2½ tablespoons of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of butter. I also used the zest of a lime, 1/8 teaspoon of hot pepper flakes, and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I thought the lemon juice would be overpoweringly acidic, but it settled nicely, as it cooled. To help absorb the flavors, I undercooked the pasta and finished it to al dente in the sauce, adding a scant ½ cup of the pasta’s cooking water. Delicious and fresh tasting.

Tasted great.  I wasn't sure my family would like it without cream but everyone, including my 18 yo son, loved it.  I didn't brine the shrimp, used frozen, then added corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce.  Thanks!

This dish is wonderful! My husband thought the shrimp was very flavorful. Note: make sure to follow the recipe for when to add the salt and pepper after you have tossed in the pasta to help give the pasta itself a little more flavor. I put it in as the sauce and shrimp were cooking and I think it would make all the difference. We had a very delicious and romantic Valentine's dinner together.

I don't understand how this recipe is getting so many stars. I made it last night and my family was VERY disappointed. The shrimp tasted fine but nothing special, the sauce was definitely nothing special, and the amount of noodles should have been cut by half. I ended up picking the shrimp out of the noodles. The only thing that gave the flavor more depth is the chili flakes and we added Parmesan cheese. I will stick with my normal scampi and ceviche recipes.

This is so simple and yet every bit as good as what you will pay a lot of money for at a fancy seafood joint. With the right bottle of wine and setup you could really impress a date. My husband doesn't need to know how easy it was to make, right?

Oh My Gosh was this good. I followed the recipe and didn't change much. I didn't soak the shrimp and did not use a pound of pasta just over half a pound. We didn't know what to expect since we have had a simular dish at a resturant but this was so much better. I could not believe it. We will cook this a lot this summer. Light refreshing and quick to make.

This was very good.  Forgot to brine the shrimp which may make a difference in the flavor.  Did not add the red pepper b/c kids were eating it that don't like spicy food.  Need to make sure and use the full 3tbs garlic b/c I did 3 cloves and it wasn't enough garlic.  Like other reviews did not use all the noodles (3/4 box) and it was definitely enough otherwise the noodles would have been too dry. I have made this without the wine in a pinch and it is still good.

I did not brine the shrimp and changed the pasta for linguine but was still good. It was easy so will likely make again on an evening I'm rushing.

My husband loved, loved, loved this recipe! I skipped the brining part cause I was short on time and added salt to taste at the end. I used fettucini but maybe I will try the angel hair next time. I also thickened the sauce a little with a cornstarch slurry. Very tasty!

I can't really complain much but I didn't have the wine so I left it out. I also didn't have fresh ingredients. So with that said... It was very pepper hot and it seemed to be very parsley heavy. I personally didn't care much for it but my boyfriend liked it except the heat. I ended up pouring in some left over alfredo sauce to try to calm it down but that didn't help much. Next time I'll probably drastically cut down the ingredients and use the full amount of butter as well. My boyfriend doesn't eat butter so I tried to cut as much as I could out. I only used 1TBS.

Excellent!!!  Easy to cook.  Prep time is a little longer but it cooks quick!  Fresh squeezed lemon juice is the best!  Save your red pepper flakes when you buy pizza, each packet is about 1/2 tsp.

This tasted exactly as I imagined it would....delicious.  I made it exactly as written (except for pepper flakes) and it was a five star taste. I made it a second time and added cut up asparagus and sliced mushrooms, which made it more of a meal-in-one. Very pretty, colorful, and nutritious with the vegetable addition. This is easy yet elegant enough for company, making it a favorite in my rotation of dinners. You can change up your veggies, or leave them out, and change up your pasta. Very versatile.

So good!  This was super easy.  I added a little corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.  I like a thicker sauce.

This was extremely dry and bland. Way too much pasta. I did not brine, too much salt. I wouldnt make this again.

This turned out fantastic. Can’t go wrong with lemon, garlic, white wine, butter and olive oil. The next day I added chicken broth to stretch out the juice for the second meal. So good.

I feel that brining the shrimp makes it way too salty.  Sorry.  The sauce was excellent though.

My husband totally LOVED it!!!  I didn't brine the shrimp, and it was still wonderful.  I did make more sauce, as we are serious sauce people--I poured mine over cauliflower rice as I am on Keto Diet and made white fiber pasta for my husband .  Will absolutely make again--and again!

This was fantastic! I saved a little pasta water for the sauce and used basil instead of parsley in the end. I used medium sized frozen shrimp and did use the brine. Served with shredded Italian hard cheese. Nice meal for company.

It’s a bit different from what I imagined. It’s a big heavy on the chili flakes and the sauce was almost non existent. It was very lemony, garlicky and oily. Not quite a refreshing, light seafood sauce. It does feel like a restaurant dish and I would play with this recipe a few more times.

I made this twice -- the first time without brining the shrimp and the second time using the brining method.  The first time it was fine -- tasty, well balanced flavors.  The second time (using the brining process)  it was a COMPLETE DISASTER!  Unfortunately I made this when company came and the brining process made the shrimp so salty it was like eating a teaspoon of table salt with each bite of shrimp!  We could not eat it.  And before you ask, YES, I followed the recipe exactly and NO, I did not use too much or the wrong kind of salt or too little water, etc..  I brined it for only 2 of the 2-4 hours recommended, used Kosher salt, rinsed thoroughly in cold water afterwards, patted dry -- the whole shebang.  Horrible does not begin to describe how badly the food was ruined.  If you make this, skip the brining!

I made it with some modifications. I could only find small frozen shrimp so that's what I went with. I also only used 1 pound of shrimp. I added 1 red bell pepper (wasn't sure how it'd cook in the sauce so I sautéed it separately before adding). But this recipe is SUPER TASTY!

I have made this twice. I did not add the lemon zest both times because I think lemon zest can over-power at times. My picky granddaughter loved it as well. Excellent;mild and delicious over rice.

I made the garlic lemon sauce according to the recipe, though I did add mushrooms.  The sauce was too thin, so I had to simmer it for quite a while to reduce it.  I would recommend not putting the shrimp in until the sauce is at the preferred consistency in order to avoid overcooking it.  The flavor was very good and my family all loved it!

Great, easy, quick recipe. You will have most ingredients on hand. I added cherry tomatoes, halved them, and put in with garlic and oil. One of my favorite dishes.

I was a little worried about the amount of garlic in recipe so I cut it back. When I make it again I will use what was called for. I was looking for something light where the sauce wasn't over powering  this recipe was what I was looking for. Will surely make it again.

I added 3 heads of broccoli and sautéed them for a bit before adding the shrimp. I also added a 28 oz. can of finely diced tomatoes at the end.  I would use 8 oz of pasta next time, maybe less, and possible add some chopped onion.

The recipe was a great success with my family! They loved it!! However, if you're a bit sensitive to spice (like me) I'd recommend to do a little bit less pepper, but I would definitely do this dish again!

This recipe never fails. Easy dish to feed a large dinner party.  I have made it plenty of times and is always a hit!  I found that 2 lbs of shrimp is over what is needed, but too much shrimp is never a bad thing! I can easily add a little extra pasta if I want to stretch the dish.  To save time, I skip the brining and just use salted butter. I also prefer to omit the red pepper flakes. Delish!!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! Every time I make it I omit the white wine because lets just be honest, I rather drink my wine than eat it. I've tweaked it a bit here and there such as using dried parsley when I can't run out to buy it fresh, adding a stick of butter rather than just 1/4 cup, using both frozen shrimp and fresh cooked shrimp when either are available to me. Squeezing fresh lemon juice at the end really makes a difference when it comes to taste and it always comes out delicious! It's quick and easy too!

Delicious! I followed the recipe, except that I had to skip the brine, so I dunked the shrimp quickly in a salty bath. Also added some halved grape tomatoes right at the end of the cook time. The sauce is perfection, I was tempted to lick my plate. Really, really wish my kids liked it, but garlic, lemon, and wine are a bit beyond their palate for now.

Made this last night. Based on other comments, used about 2 T. of lemon and about 8 oz of pasta...dinner for two. Added t. salt. Excellent!

Delicious! I used half a box of pasta, 1lb shrimp, only 1/4 tsp red peppers. We added 1 Tbls. Cornstarch to thicken. All other ingredients remained the same. This was so good! I suggest having everything measured and ready to go before starting because it comes together so quickly.

Deliciously complex.  Full of intense flavor and such a treat.  I doubled the sauce to be sure I'd have enough.  It was enough for about 3/4 of a box of pasta (but I like my scampi saucey.)  I did about 1 1/2 times the garlic, and it was very garlicky but in a very good way.  I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said to add the garlic after the wine/lemon.  It would have been overcooked, otherwise.  The zest was the perfect addition; I was surpised at what a difference it made.  I may add just a bit less fresh lemon juice next time, because I had to add 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to cut how incredibly lemony it was. (Or maybe I'll just add the baking soda again, because it turned out amazing in the end.  I don't know if it may have been)  I didn't have flakes and used ground cayenne instead (half the amount).  It was still definitely spicy that way.   You could pair this with linguine or angel hair; it would be heavenly either way.

Sautéed  minced shallots with the garlic.  And added 3/4 lb. fresh asparagus, cut into 1 inch pieces and added it to boiling water with pasta.  Sautéing the shrimp with the butter, lemon juice and wine and tossing in the asparagus and pasta...DELICIOUS!!!!

Great combination.  I thought the shrimp was a bit salty, but the hubby liked it, and felt it was balanced well.

Yummy recipe but should point out that the peppers aren't really needed. Make the meal very spicy for a person that doesn't like spicy food that much.

Followed the recipe except for brining the shrimp due to time constraints. I just patted dry after thawing and salted them... Adding more salt to taste after mixing everything together.  As long as you don't overlook the shrimp, this seems like a fail safe, easy recipe... with results that wowed everyone!  I used thin spaghetti and a Pinot Grigio for the wine and a bit more garlic than called for. Perfect.  Lovely for company.

Delicious and very easy to make! Substituted more lemon juice in place of the lemon zest and it still turned out amazing. Definitely 5 stars for this one!

I cut back on the butter and olive oil and left out the lemon zest.  It was probably my fault, but it was bland.  Don't cut back on oil and butter to be healthy.  If you do, I'd kick up the spices.

Bypassed the brining aspect due to time constraints but will try it next time. Our local Albertsons had frozen wild caught gulf shrimp (16-20 count) in 2# bags for $ 13.98. How could I resist? Cut the recipe to 4 servings and it was excellent both on the day I prepared it and the next day as leftovers via the microwave. Wifey said better than a 5 * restaurant. HOWEVER, please be advised that quantity of liquid ingredients ought to be increased by a factor of 2. I'll double the wine, oil, lemon and butter next time.
PS: We used Dreamfields angel hair for our pasta as wife in on primal diet and I'm type II diabetic. It has been a Godsend.

when my husband walked in and saw this dish on the stove he said "it looks like Mr. Noodles with shrimp" that about summed it up.  I used fresh pasta, and maybe this was the mistake.  Also, I brined the shrimp and didn't notice any difference to other shrimp dishes I've made.  I make a similar dish with sliced garlic and chili flakes cooked in loads of good olived oil then add the cooked pasta with a bit of the pasta water -- this is similar, but not as tasty.
