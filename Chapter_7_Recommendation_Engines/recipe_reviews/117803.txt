Hubby said this was to die for and I agree.  I used chunky peanut butter and doubled the amount. I added 1 cup of cabbage to the veggies.  Delicious!

The kids loved the sauce, so they ate more of the vegetables.  I used zucchini, bell peppers, onions and broccoli.  Instead of adding the garlic with the veg, I grated it into the sauce.  I used four large cloves of garlic and added a one inch piece of ginger root, also grated into the sauce - with some red pepper flakes at the end.  Next time I will add more ginger to perk up the flavor more.

I'm a 17-year-old girl just discovering the joy of cooking, and I found this recipe both delicious and easy to make. I used boneless short ribs instead of the sirloin and they were lovely. Mom and I thoroughly enjoyed!

This recipe is excellent - by far the most successful wok/stir-fry recipe I've ever tried.  I added a bit of cayenne pepper to the sauce and I also added chopped bell pepper and soybean sprouts.  I served with white rice, and definitely had more than 4 servings.  Thanks, really excellent!

Pretty tasty! Sort of Thai inspired. Make the recipe as written but try serving it on large lettuce leaves. Top it with freshly shredded carrots and a little cilantro.

I used musrooms, onions and red and yellow peppers and served this over brown basmati rice.  This recipe was delicious.  The sauce was very light tasting and the peanut flavor was subtle and very flavorful.  I will definitely keep this on hand and make it again.

Very good beef stir fry.  I especially liked the peanut sauce.  I added more vegetables, asparagus and mushrooms, peapods would be good also.
My beef loving husband gave it 2 thumbs up.

I used the vegetables I had on hand which is why I gave it a four star.   I made the sauce as directed and this is where the four star comes in.  
Delicious with any combination of meat, chicken and vegetables.
Thanks for a new keeper.

enjoyed it a lot!  The sauce was not as peanut buttery as I thought it might be, but still had good taste and came together quickly.

This was really good! I'm not one for stir fry, but it has a different flavor than your typical stir fry. I thought it was a nice change of pace. I only gave it 4 stars because I added in a whole bag of frozen stir fry veggies in addition to the original ingredients and there was still way too much sauce. It really about drowned the veggies. Awesome flavor, but cut down on the liquid to probably half of what it calls for.

I read many of the reviews and most of them were very positive, so I was disappointed in the lack of flavor of this dish. I tried adding soy sauce and peanut butter to enhance the flavor but I didn't want to disrupt the balance too much. Not sure if I'll be making this again.

I didn't have any cornstarch, so I improvised with a little sesame oil to help with the flavor, if not the consistency. It was still pretty good, but next time I'll be more prepared and will also add more veggies... a great recipe to play with!

My 13 year old daughter is really getting into cooking and she has made this recipe twice. We all love it! Initially, my other kids were a little skeptical but the vegetables were great and so was everything else.

This was ok.  I only had chicken broth on hand which may have made the difference, it tasted fine for a weeknight meal but there was no "wow".
Thanks for the recipe, I might try it again another time, maybe with coconut milk in it for more flavour.  I served with salad rolls with a peanut dipping sauce.

Do NOT use Smart Balance peanut butter for this dish! (or anything else for that matter)
I ended up rinsing the sauce off of the beef/veggies and making a new batch with a crunchy generic brand.  It turned out wonderfully!  I really enjoyed the little chunks of peanuts.  
I added carrots and Broccoli, I'll add even more next time!  I love veggies!  And this way we didn't need a side dish. ;)

After reading the reviews I really though this would be much better.  To me it didn't seem to have much flavor and I even added some chili paste because I like a little kick.  I was pretty disappointed overall.

I gave this 5 stars becuse it not only tasted fabulous; it was extremely quick and easy to boot.  Great for even a mid-week workday dinner.  My husband - a strictly meant and potatoes guy- loved it!

very nice peanut stir fry, however only half the amount of cornstarch is needed. I also added some extra pepper for a bit of a kick.

Made this exactly as directed last night for dinner and it was awesome!  I normally am not a big fan of stir fried anything over rice but I thoroughly enjoyed this.  Adding it to my rotation. Thanks for posting. Update: I actually am now a fan of stir fries and make them at least once a week. I just don't use rice anymore but instead, serve over boiled steam fried noodles.  This recipe is still one of my all time favorites and is easily adjustable for what you  like. Sometimes I make it as written, sometimes I add other veggies. All depends on my mood.  Try this, very easy, very tasty.

Very yummy!  I took the suggestion of another user and added grated ginger in for more flavor.  I also used a frozen bag of stir fry vegetable blend and it came out fantastic.  Great shortcut dinner.

Not bad, a hint of Thai flavor that could be enhanced with the addition of a few drops of lime juice. I served it over rice noodles and added some bean sprouts for a cool crunch and the family liked it. I'll definitely  make this again reducing the cornstarch by 1 teaspoon.A very good standby for when the cupboard's almost bare.

Fantastic.  Great taste, we loved it.  You can also substitute chicken for the beef and chicken broth for the beef broth.  Add some Bamboo Shoots and it's GREAT!

Delicious and super easy to make. Not a fan of celery so I julienned red peppers and onions. I also added about 1/4 tsp of sesame oil to the sauce to enhance the nutty flavor.  As some of the other reviews recommended, I added an additional TBS of peanut butter - chunky. This is a keeper!

Everytime I make this recipe I tweek it a little. Its one of my husbands favorite things I make. I always add more vegetables like brocollii, carrots and lots of yummy cabbage. I think next time I'm going to add bamboo shoots. I make this at least twice a month.

This was yummy. The stir fry sauce was the best part, and I am willing to be it can be whisked together and used for other dishes.

The sauce for this dish had a very good flavor. As I seldom follow a recipe exactly, I made some changes.  I added a green and red pepper and a small zuchini sliced to bite size pieces.  It was very good over egg noodles.  When I make this again, I will try a little more peanut butter to increqse that flavor.  It did not reheat very well.  I mixed all the noodles in before serving.  I think a better approach may be to keep the noodles separate until ready to serve.

The recipe is good, but seems to missing that "something".  It was rather bland - maybe cilantro?  I will make again and tinker with the recipe as it is a good base. And you really only need to make 1/2 the sauce as it was more than enough for the amount of meat/veggys in the dish.

I loved this stir-fry! I added tofu, carrots, red bell pepper and an extra spoonful of peanut butter. Served it over rice, and got major compliments from the boyfriend and step-mother! Definitely making this again; it's quick and tastes awesome.

This stir fry sauce is awesome! The flavors   are a perfect balance, I love how the peanut taste does not over power the other flavors. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and broth.

Excellent! Although you're forewarned - this recipe makes a TON of sauce so unless you like your veggies pretty soaked you might find that aspect upsetting. Personally, my family loves a lot of sauce (and since it's not a particularly caloric sauce) it's perfect. Also, it's fantastic with extra veggies and no beef at all in case anyone's wondering!

Great sauce!  I added a few more veggies: baby bok choy, red peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, and substituted green onions for regular onions.  I may add extra peanut butter next time, and something to make it spicy.  But overall, probably the best "from scratch" recipe for a stir-fry sauce.

I made this the other night and it was SOO TASTY. I used a little extra garlic and also added cayenne pepper per another user's suggestion to give it a little kick. It turned out very nicely. I served it over brown rice and it was a great easy dinner and a nice leftover lunch the next day!

We LOVED this recipe. I made the sauce per the recipe other than using cayenne pepper in place of regular pepper. I made it with prawns instead of beef because my daughter isn't big on meat.  It was delicious and both my kids (6 & 8) cleared their plates. I threw in some sliced mushrooms and pea pods with the onion and garlic. I served it over rice. I will definitely make this again!

I loved the flavor of this dish and served it over udon noodles. Not to many flavors that were actually in it came through though. You can smell the peanut butter but it almost felt like it was non existent while eating. Still a very enjoyable dish and will make again with a few adjustments for my own personal taste.

Simple to make, but the beef broth over powers the peanut butter, you don't taste the peanut butter. It tastes more like a gravy.  I would add more spices to the sauce for sure. It was good, but not wow.  Improvise if you're going to make this recipe.

Actually, the "not so spicy recipe" is great for kids.  It is hard to make dinner for them and us parents and leave out the spices all the time.  This work for both the kids and us because it is flavorful without anything that offends the kids tastebuds.  I used chunky peanut butter too.  I simplified with a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables.  Worked great!

The taste was good, but there was way too much sauce even with two cups of added vegetables. I am looking for recipes that taste like authentic asian food and this really did not. This was an okay recipe, but I wouldn't make it again.

Wow, this was really good!  I used chunky peanut butter, a bit more than it called for, substituted beef bouillion dissolved in water, added red pepper flakes and threw in a half bag of frozen snap peas veggie mix.  Served with noodles (thin spaghetti).  YUM!

Just tried this! I dont eat meat so we just made it with vegetables, and chicken broth. I also added some cayenne, and ground ginger. It was really good, but I can tell it needed something else (meat) so the actual recipe is probably even better!

I like the recipe, but used sweet soy sauce instead of the 1/2 tsp sugar. A pince of salt made it better. Maybe its my inexperience with cooking stir fries - but I used cabbage which I don't think worked too well with the peanut butter (I stuck to the 2 tbs in the original recipe).

All my children, ages 2-14, including a picky 13yo loved this recipe. We replaced the celery with frozen broccoli and green beans and served it over rice. All requested that we put it in our book to make again.

I added some mushrooms but otherwise kept to the recipe.  I thought it was ok but nothing really special.  The peanut butter did add a new twist but didn't blend really well with the veggies for my taste.

Yummy!  I made it with vegetables only & used mushroom & vegetable broth instead of beef.  The sauce was excellent!  I also served it with a dash of cayenne pepper.

One of our family's favorites. Good with chicken too.
