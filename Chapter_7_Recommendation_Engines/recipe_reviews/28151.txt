The chicken comes out super in this sauce.  Make sure to drain the chicken after browning for a few minutes on each side as the remaining juices from the chicken are released during baking and the sauce doubles.  I noticed that if I hadn't done that then the sauce would have been too watery.  I followed the recipe exactly and mine came out perfect, not too sweet, not to vinegary, not too sour.  If you have concerns around the sauce being too "vinegar-y", keep it at a low-med heat in the sauce pan in the meantime while you are browning the chicken.  This will burn off and thin out some of the vinegar's tangy taste, but still leave an undretone of it which is required for this recipe.

After I tasted this I realized it would be a great sauce for pulled pork, or really any meat in a slow cooker.  For pulled pork I would probably double or triple the brown sugar though to complement it more than the chicken requires.  

As far as the taste of this sauce, it reminded me of the sauce used in Lloyds Barbeque Ribs that you buy ready made at the store.  I love that particular sauce and I have finally found a recipe that I can use and save the money from buying Lloyd's ribs just for tasting that great sauce.  

This is a great addition to my recipe collection, will make it one of my regulars.  Thanks!!  A+

Sorry, but this was one of the worst recipes ever.  Way too "vinegary" - my husband (who's not picky at all didn't care for it at all, and my teenage boys wouldn't touch it.  Don't know if the ingredient ratio was incorrectly given.

I must side with those who think this recipe calls for too much vinegar.  I fixed it for my wife and myself and we liked it much better the second day after I added some honey,and a little salt, to counteract the vinegar. It actually made my eyes water when I was heating it up the first night.  If you just consider the amount of vinegar compared to the other ingredients, it seems out of proportion, like it's a typo.  I would recommend starting with one-fourth, not three-fourths, cup of vinegar.  You're prepping the sauce in a saucepan before adding it to the chicken so you can always increase the vinegaryness to your liking.  Much easier to add than to subtract. Rating this recipe 4 stars based on adjusting vinegar down to one-fourth cup.

I thought this recipes was very tasty and easy. I added a lot more garlic (I'm a lover) and some extra cayenne -- tada! Thanks Michael.

Very good recipe except it's important to mention the amount of time to cook the sauce so the flavors meld.  I cooked it for at least half an hour before pouring it on top of the chicken, plus I added two tablespoons of butter to round out the richness.  In addition, I left the chicken uncovered for the last 15 minutes so the sauce baked on top.  Delicious!!

This was a very simple recipe but it turned out very good. I doubled up on the ingredients so we could use the left over as a sauce over the rice I served with it. I used boned and skinned thighs which lowered the fat drippings and made the marinade useable. Great recipe to have on hand for a last minute throw together with a great taste. Thanks!

I used white vinegar, and cut it by a 1/4 cup (1/2 cupe white vinegar, 1/4 cup water) and it worked fine....not too vinegary at all, and I wouldn't cut it using cider vinegar. ] I might try a bit of red wine vinegar for kicks....
At any rate, this was a FANTASTIC recipe, and is now our regular BBQ sauce. GREAT stuff!

I agree with the one reviewer, too much vinegar for us, we'll cut it by half.  However, overall it was good.  We will be making it again with the vinegar cut (will add water to make up for it).

The sauce on this was outstanding. I made it with chicken legs and it worked just as well. Also, the tomato paste expands to create more sauce than I thought before I covered and baked it.

My family loved this!  However, I made just a couple of changes:  used 1/2 cup vinegar with 3/4 cup chicken broth and cut cayenne to generous 1/4 tsp.  Then I browned the chicken in my oven-safe saute pan, poured on the sauce and through it all in the oven.  I lowered the temp to 250 and baked it covered for 2 hours - very tender.  Served with quinoa as a side (the sauce was delicious poured over quinoa!)

This is a tasty recipe. I made one adjustment; I reduced the cider vinegar by 1/4 C and substituted 1/4 C bourbon whiskey. I'll try this again.

Great way to use chicken thighs. The sauce is tangy and the recipe makes lots of extra sauce to spoon over rice. I used the proportions listed in the original recipe and the vinegar was not overpowering at all. Just simmer the sauce a bit longer to burn off the vinegar taste. Delicious.

I made two changes.  One slight - I just did my normal sub of some onion powder since I dislike cooked onion pieces.  I also don't like thighs so decided to use this sauce on boneless chicken breasts.  I used what I thought a good equivalent of about 2 1/2 pounds, but there was enough sauce for probably at least 3 lb.   I cut them to be more like the size of thighs, and it also didn't take 45 minutes in the oven - but difficult to comment on that since I was using a different meat cut.  I've made it twice.  The first time I thought it fairly good and was a 4, though I wouldn't want to make it often.  The second time I thought it a 3 and that it was a bit too tangy.  I just figured it was something I had to be in the mood for.  After reading the other reviews I see many thought it too tangy, and I wasn't really aware that cooking down vinegar would cut the tang - so I'm assuming I just coincidentally cooked it more the first time, which tells me it would probably be fine if cooked more as suggested.

My family LOVED this recipe and we aren't big fans of chicken thighs.  My husband had 3 pieces. I added extra brown sugar, and some garlic powder, but otherwise mixed the sauce ingredients and cooked it on the stove while browning the thighs. Will make the sauce again for chicken breasts and pork too.

It was too vinegary at first, but I added a couple squirts of honey and about a tablespoon more of brown sugar and it turned out great. Also, I used 1/2 seasoned rice vinegar because it is more mild.

My husband and I love this recipe.  What I especially love is that I can be lazy with it if I want and it still tastes okay, but the best way is to cook the sauce before.

I have a VERY fussy husband and this is one of the nights he compimented me!  I followed the recipe(for two) and cut down on the vinegar slightly, omitted the tomato paste, followed the remainder of the recipe.  I would serve this for guests - the best taste!

The sauce was easy enough to make. I liked this recipe better than my husband did; he thought the tomato paste overwhelmed the other flavors. The chili sauce plus cayenne gave it a subtle kick. I did cut the apple cider vinegar in half after reading previous reviews and the result was vinegar-y enough for us.

Yeesh, I don't quite know how this got good reviews.  I followed the recipe to a T and ended up with spicy vinegary chicken.  I even let the sauce cook down for 35 minutes.  I'm glad some people got good results from this, but it wasn't for us.

LOVED it! My husband said it's some of the best chicken he's ever had!  I followed the recipe except I used 1Tbsp Splenda Brown Sugar instead of 2 Tbsp regular brown sugar, and substituted 3 Tbsp dry minced onion for the fresh chopped onion, and I only cooked them for 30 minutes in our gas oven. They were SO TENDER they would make great BBQ Chicken Sandwiches, too. Thanks for a new weekly favorite!

This is one of the only recipes I have yet to mess up.  My boyfriend loves it and I do too.  It's easy, fast, and has a unique flavor.  I use white wine vinegar and it tastes great.

Ever since I moved into my apartment, I've been craving BBQ. Unfortunately, the complex doesn't allow grills on the balcony, but this satisfies my hankering for BBQ chicken--without the grill!

I dont know what I did wrong, but this turned out really spicy. My husband loved it, but it was too hot for me. I used the vinegar as called for and added garlic powder and honey. I cooked the sauce down for about 30 minutes until it was almost syrupy. The texture and color is beautiful, but next time I'll reduce the cayenne & chili sauce. Served with steamed white rice.

Followed recipe exactly. Used hot chili sauce. Used some chicken breasts as well as thighs. Turned out wonderfully - very nice flavor. It was quite hot - just the way we like it! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This tasted like spicy ketchup on chicken thighs...the sauce (sweetened and toned town some) might be better as a sauce for shredded beef or pork.

Was apprehensive about dish being too 'vinegary,' after reading a couple reviews, but it wasn't (for us)
Served with mashed potato, but I think its light/thin sauce would be better over rice. Doubled
quantity of minced onion, otherwise followed recipe using skinless/ boneless thighs, and apple cider vinegar.  We LOVED the combo flavour of 'sour & sweet.'  One of the best chix recipes ever & a definite new favourite.  Thanks much for sharing!

We make this AT LEAST once a week. It has so much flavor. I cut the vinegar down just a little and add fresh garlic. We use the leftovers for chicken tacos and there are soooo good!!!

This wasn't a hit at all unfortunately. It didn't matter what I added to the sauce,it didn't improve. I wish I'd just used regular bottled bbq sauce. Oh well, thanks anyway.

This would have tasted way to vinegary except that I kept it cooking for about another hour. The flavors blended and it was tasty. Not sure I'll make this again but it wasn't bad overall.

We loved this and it will absolutely become a regular in our rotation.  We're pretty wimpy when it comes to heat so omitted the cayenne.  Served it with rice and it was awesome.   Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this and will make it again.  Next time I will omit the cayenne pepper. Really doesn't need the pepper.  Very favorable dish.

This is a really good recipe. It is tangy with the vinegar so if you don't like that kind of flavor you probably won't like it but you can always use less vinegar. It does make a lot of sauce too and I wish I had thought about keeping it to use for another purpose. Have made this several times.

Amazing sauce! I reduced the Apple Cider Vinegar to 1/4 cup as per other reviews and I doubled the cayenne pepper because I like spicy. I didn't have tomato paste so I took a can of garlic-onion tomato sauce and simmered it on medium until it reached a paste consistency and reduced to 6 oz, then I added the other ingredients. Once all the other ingredients were added I simmered the sauce on medium low for over a 1/2 hour so the flavors melded. Before I sauteed the chicken pieces I lightly seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoning salt. Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't quite sure of this recipe, and it was a pleasant surprise, my daughter said it is on hit.  It is also a great second day sandwich.
