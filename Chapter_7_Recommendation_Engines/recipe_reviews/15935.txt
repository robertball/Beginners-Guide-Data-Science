There must be an error in this recipe. I think it calls for too much cinnimon and not enough cornstarch. Almost tastes like apple flavored oat meal. Surely not my favorite.

My first negative feedback. Didn't turn out anything like I thought. The apple mixture was very watery, needing more cornstarch. The topping wasn't very crunchy probably due to all the moisture from the apples. Unfortunately I will not be making this one again.

Loved the crunchy, buttery crumble top.  I cut the apples in cubes and cooked them in a bowl with blackberrys with the topping form this recipe and it was terrific.  I will definitely add the Crumble Topping recipe to my recipe box.

I don't know if it was my fault, but the topping just was not crispy/crunchy.  My mom disliked this one and she usually loves my cooking.

Do not waste your ingredients.  I usually do not leave negative feedback, but my apple crisp came out not so great.  It did not have any flavor or crispiness.  The topping was bland and the apples were not sweet enough.  Play around with extra ingredients if you are going to try this recipe!

The recipe needs a little more flavor. I use pumpkin pie spices for that delicious complex flavor of nutmeg, cinnamon & ginger. I also drizzle dark grade B Maple Syrup all across the pan  before I bake. This carmelizes the oats and apples making  a crunchy top.

The cornstarch and cinnamon need to switch places the errors comes from all recipe.com not the submitter !!!!!! This is a really good recipe I myself like apple crisps better but this is great tasting if you switch the cornstarch to two tables and the cinnamon to two tsp!!!!!!!!

In my opinion, this apple crisp tasted like warm apples with mushy oatmeal on top of it. I think that the apple mixture softened the oatmeal, as there was no "crisp" texture. In a nut shell, choose another receipe.

Good flavor. Crispy oat mixture on top. But it was too runny. Needs either less water or more cornstarch. That's all I would change; otherwise, it was great!

I thought this had too much cinnamon and water, but not enough corn starch. Next batch, I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, dusted the apples with flour instead of cornstarch, and added a tablespoon of flour to the oatmeal....yum!

This had really nice flavour but the recipe was off. I found it needed much more corn starch and after adding four times the amount, it still came out of the oven very wattery. i would make this again if i was able to find a way to make it thicker.

Read the reviews and you can tell this recipe needs serious tweaking.  I really wanted to make an apple crisp where the base was more like apple pie filling and not just sliced apples.  So I used this as a basis.  I only had three Granny Smith apples so I cut the recipe in one third but used a whole tablespoon of cornstarch and 3/4 c of water.  Next time I will use apple juice.  I didn't add the cinnamon until the apples were done cooking and also added about 1/2 t of nutmeg (fresh ground).  Looking at the measurements for one third of the topping, I decided it didn't look like enough so I used one half the recipe and even then it wasn't enough.  Overall it is a good base recipe and the end result was very good.  But made as is, it wouldn't have been.

Personally I didn't like it. It was quite liquidy for and apple crisp. It felt very soupy and more like an ice cream topping. The topping once put on top was really soggy. I personally won't make it again. It just didn't feel like an apple crisp. By it self the topping could be used for something else like muffins but the topping was soggy. It just wasn't crispy enough for an apple crisp.

Here is my very first ever Negative recipe. I honestly ask All Recipes to take this, Apple Crisp down. From what I saw and read I am obviously not the only one that feels this way. I basically made an Apple Soup with an oatmeal crust. I fallowed the exact recipe that I was instructed to. I will put this in my fail bucket.

This recipe is totally wrong. This is like an apple soup with oatmeal on top. Not crispy and very bland. If you like a bland non crispy watered down dessert then this is for you. Not me blah it’s absolutely terrible.

Ok I messed this up but still turned out yummy. I forgot the flour in the bottom, but doesn’t matter, no matter how u mix it, it comes out nice, sweet and an easy dessert
