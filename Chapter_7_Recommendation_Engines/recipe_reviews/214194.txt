I have made several great quiche's from allrecipes and this is by far the favorite. I have breakfast each Sun. a.m. with my adult children and their friends, and I followed this recipe exactly, except I used fresh spinach and sauteed' it with a tad of sweet onion. This recipe is much lighter having less cheese then the others I've made.  My husband even said, "D, this was a great breakfast"! now I was happy to get that compliment.  Also, I made homemade hashbrowns to go with it. Great success. Thanks.

Excellent.  I took this to a breakfast potluck at work -- and it received rave reviews. Sets up well. I squeezed the liquid out of the spinach b/c I was worried about this.  I halved the recipe to eat at home w/ good results too.

This was so good and so easy to make! It was a big hit with the family.   I also added in onion and some bacon.  Made two beautiful quiches with some left over for a small frittata, which is good to munch on throughout the day.  **No high altitude adjustment necessary.

We really liked this.  Even my super picky kids ate a few bites!  I used cheddar cheese because that's what I had and also sauted some chopped onion with fresh spinach until it was wilted in place of the frozen spinach.  We like it crustless better, plus, less calories and fat.  I frequently make egg bake type dishes with different vegis, spinach and green chilies are some of them, but have never thought of doing them together.  I will make this again.  Oh, I didn't add any butter, but did put a tablespoon or two (just a couple dribbles) to give it a buttery taste.  It's not greasy and you probably could completely omit the butter and never notice.

I did change the recipe very slightly because I had to use up some leeks & chard from my garden, but it turned out delicious and I felt the need to pass along a positive rating.  First, I cooked some chopped bacon (because I add bacon to almost everything).  Then I cooked some thinly sliced leeks in about a teaspoon of the bacon grease and used those instead of the green chilies.  I melted the buttter in the pan and wilted some fresh swiss chard in it, then used that in place of the spinach.  I kept everything else the same, and the quiche was absolutely delicious.  It wasn't quite as creamy as traditional quiche--it was a little more "firm"-- but considering that the egg/cottage cheese/less cheese combo makes it healthier it was fabulous!

We didn't love this. We liked it ok, but we're hit and miss on cooked spinach anyway. I halved this recipe but would've liked more green chile pepper flavor (so use both cans for a half recipe). Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a pot luck (halved the ingredients since I was only making one) and it was gone within an hour...so I'm basing my rating on that. :) I didn't even get to taste it...which is why I'm making one for myself right now. (EDITED 12/13/14) Four years later this is still one of my go-to recipes for whenever I need to bring a dish to an event. However, unlike the first time I made this, I go ahead and make two so I can have one for myself. :) Also, unlike many of the recipes on this site, I make this exactly as written and it's a hit every time.

I tried this for the first time at Diana's house (a fellow all recipes member) after I brought back some fresh green chile from New Mexico. It was delicious. When I got home, I made it for my husband, adding a total of 1 1/2 cups of fresh green chile.  After reading plenty of reviews, I also added red and orange peppers, onions, bacon, and used half ricotta and half cottage.  I also used fresh spinach cooked in some of the grease from the sausage from a local butcher.  The butter I used was homemade, and I used it to cook some mushrooms which I also added.  I needed to put a lot of substance into it for a healthy, FILLING, main dish.  I did not use a crust and the pie came out beautifully as well as the small muffins I made and gave away.  My husband LOVED it!

Great quiche recipe, and I have tried a lot.  I will be sticking to this one.  Instead of making one large pie, I made 12 cupcake (regular, not mini-)size quiches so that I could freeze them.  I halved the recipe, using 6 eggs instead of 12, and added chopped bacon to the filling.  Also, I didn't have enough pie crust, so three of the quiches were crustless and I think I like them even better than the ones with crust!  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious!!!!  The whole family loved this quiche.  I did add a pound of bacon (1/2 to each) cooked and crumbled along the bottom of the pie before adding the filling.  This one is a keeper!!

Great filling!  I also added 1/2 lb of cooked, hot italian bulk sausage to filling.

I also made a hash brown crust instead of pie crust---used 5 cups frozen hash browns & 1/2 c melted butter---pressed into pie pan and baked for 20 min at 400 degrees.

This was my first time making a quiche, and it turned out AWESOME! I made it for an office lunch, and everyone loved it. The cottage cheese gives it a really nice creamy consistency. I added bacon, is was delish!

Finally a perfect quiche.  The texture was just like at a good restaurant.  I discovered after I started that I was out of green chiles; I substituted jarred pesto and really liked it.  I might even do that on purpose next time.

I make this recipe often because it keeps well -- you can have it left over for the next few days.  As is, the recipe is perfect, but here are a few changes that can easily be made with good results: Use egg whites in the carton in place of whole eggs to save a few calories (you'll never miss the yolks with all that cheese in there); 1/4 cup = 1 egg.  Low fat cheese also works well.  You can leave out either the spinach or the chilies, or add mushrooms, green onions or zucchini.  I always make it in a 13 x 9 pan (sprayed with non-stick spray) and eliminate the pie crust step.  Baking time is about the same as described in the recipe.

Awesome quiche recipe just as is! The texture is light a fluffly, the flavor excellent and it looks so nice with a little browning on the top.  

Even better is that  the eggs and cottage cheese mixed with the flour mixture are an awesome base for whatever you want to add. I omitted the butter with little impact on the overall taste and texture.  I have made several other quiches using the basic mixture, but adding different cheeses and other ingredients; bacon, ham, brocoli, etc.  In order to cut back on some of the crust I have made this recipe with phyllo dough for a crust, 4-5 sheets per pan with a little olive oil brushed on between the layers.  YUMMY!

My husband likes neither quiche nor spinach, but he's going back for seconds on this! I halved the recipe, added some shallots and red bell pepper and cut the spinach by half. Didn't have any canned chilis on hand, so I used some anaheims I put up in my freezer last summer. I also sprinkled about 1/4 cup of shredded jack cheese on top just before baking. This is SO good!

The green chili flavor is very light and mild.  The basic quiche recipe is very easy to lighten up.  I used egg beaters, 2% cheeses and eliminated the butter and crust.  It cooked up very light and fluffy but watch the time if you eliminate the crust; mine was done about 8 minutes before the end of the recommended cooking time.  Next time I'll add mushrooms and onions and add a green salsa afterwards.  very tasty and pretty.

Excellant!  Did one of them without pie crust.  It turned out great.  I used fresh rinsed spinach cooked in a little oil and drained.  I added 12 oz. pre-cooked breakfast sausage.  Fit  nicely into larger sized pie pans.  I got low fat cheese by mistake and fat free cottage cheese.  I couldn't tell.  I served it with take-out green chili from a local restaurant on the side.  This dish is good enough for company.  It is firmer than most quiche are, but this makes it serve up prettier (it doesn't fall apart).  I was so impressed with this recipe, I joined just to write a review!  But I encourage you to use fresh spinach if you have a little time.  Trim off the stems and weigh out the leaves.  If you don't have a scale it's about 1 1/2 bunches of spinach.  Rinse thoroughly a few times. (Put in the bowl of salad spinner, fill with water and swish around.  Drain water and repeat until water is clear.  Fresh spinach needs to be cleaned!)  To cook, heat a little olive oil in a large  pan, add spinach and cook on a low heat.  Cover for a bit, then take cover off when it starts cooking.  Cook until its soft and a bright green.  Drain in colander, cool and chop into medium sized pieces.  Enjoy this recipe and impress your friends!

Very tasty! I chopped and sauteed a 6 oz package of fresh spinach with some onion instead of the frozen spinach. I cut the recipe in half and used only four eggs as I was using just one, smallish pie shell.

My coworkers loved this recipe! I on the other hand thought it was a little bland. I had to douse it with hot sauce to give it additional flavor. I would recommend adding maybe some ground beef or chicken in it for flavor.

I baked this the night before, then reheated it in the microwaveand right before an office bruch, and it turned out really nice. I made it crustless since I couldn't put a pie pan in the microwave, added half of an onion diced, and totally forgot to put in the melted butter but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was a big hit!

Fantastic base recipe for any quiche.  We made it exactly to recipe, baked the pie in a removeable-bottom tart pan, and enjoyed a PERFECT quiche for a brunch party.  Second time around, we made some substitutions and still had success.  In both cases, we made the batter the night before and baked the quiches the next morning.  IDEA:  Add some goat cheese (chevre) to the mix and whip vigorously; the result is a gorgeously smooth, emulsified batter that won't separate (which means you could probably make it several days ahead and still have a lovely end product).  Thanks so much for giving me a new go-to recipe!

Awesome recipe and easy.   I cut everything in half to make just one.  Also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  It's wonderful.

I made this quiche for a brunch playdate I hosted for a couple of friends.  They loved it, the kids loved it, I loved it.  I did add bacon and sauted fresh spinach with shallots in olive oil instead of using frozen spinach.  The only quiche recipe you'll ever need.

Everyone says they follow the recipe exactly, and that's what I did. Hesitant to bring it to a potluck, cause never tested the recipe. Thanks for all the good reviews, and to the recipe! my husband and my husband's co workers love it!

Firm, easy to serve. Made one in crust, one crustless. Even though I didn't use enough grease in the pan of the crustless pie and it stuck a bit (and the crust on the other was gorgeous) that was the first to be eaten. I'll be trying it in muffin tins next, with and without crust. Most people added hot sauce so I'll be adding more seasoning and maybe hotter chiles.

Terrific recipe!  Have made this several times - the first time exactly as shown.  Each time I cut down the butter and then one time I forgot it.  I now make it without any butter and just bake it in a greased 9x13 dish without a crust to save  fat and calories.  Seasonings are perfect as is.

Awesome recipe. Made it exactly as written except I used parmesian cheese insted of the recommended one. I also sauteed onions, mushrooms & spinach, sprinkled salt, garlic and some cayenne pepper as it was cooking. Everyone loved it and couldn't believe it had cottage cheese in it. They loved the flavor and consistancy. Thank you for this recipe!

My 11 year old asked for seconds! I made without the shell and it was perfect. The frozen spinach was a little too "spinachy." Next time I will use fresh or omit all together.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have any cottage cheese or green chiles, so I subbed 8oz of cream cheese and left out the chiles. Turned out AMAZING! Everyone raved about it at the Christmas meal.

I made this for dinner last night. My first time using cottage cheese in a quiche and aside from some visible curds, it was good. The chiles gave it great flavor - next time I might even use extra. I don't like frozen spinach, so I sautéed 9 oz. of fresh spinach with some chopped onion and garlic. I will definitely make it again, but will have to decrease the baking time. I only baked it for 30 minutes and it was a little too dry for my taste. Had it again for breakfast this morning, and it tastes even better the next day!

This is definitely my favorite quiche recipe, and I've tried several.  I'm not a big green chili fan, but I've tried this with a number of different meat and vegetable combos.  A word of advice, if you add lots of veggies you'll need to reduce the cooking time...my "thickest" version packed with veggies only needed 15 min at 400 and then 15 at 350.  I use 9" round cake pans instead of pie pans so it's more like "deep dish" quiche.  I've made it with crust and without, when I use crust I prefer the pillsbury refrigerated crust (dough) instead of a traditional pie crust, tastes fantastic!!

This is my first time making a quiche. It was easy to make and delicious! My family praised the cook! I was skeptical of the green chiles, but WOW, very addictive. This is going in our book of favorites. Thank you for sharing! :)

If I were opening a cafe, this would be on the menu!! It is so delicious. I used fresh uncooked spinach and it worked great, although I don't think I added enough. I'm definitely going for seconds right now...

Excellent quiche.  I needed something quick for an after concert dinner with friends.  I used an 8 inch pan and made half the recipe.  Since our friends do not eat chilies, I substituted fresh spinach, mushrooms, and onions sauted lightly in 2 Tablespoons of butter.  The cottage cheese and baking powder have to be the secret ingredients that make this quiche like none other.

Although I used ham, mushrooms, onions and fresh spinach, with old aged white cheddar, the idea is the same.  The flour/baking powder/salt mixture with the eggs makes for a perfectly cooked (non-runny) pie.  I halved the recipe and made just one quiche.  No melted butter required.  WILL MAKE AGAIN.. pic to follow!

THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!!! I have never made a quiche before so I was really hoping for the best. At first I thought it was very little spinach in the recipe but believe me, EVERYTHING IS IN PERFECT AMOUNTS!! Just remember to let the quiche cool, it locks in more flavor and allows the crust to settle. I followed the recipe step by step however I had more quiche stuffing than crust! To be safe, I suggest purchasing 3 pie crusts in case you need more room. I assure you that the leftovers wont last long!!

I've made this several times & everyone gobbles it up.  Even the kids--the picky ones, too!  I just don't tell anyone what's in it.  I just say "it's quiche, take a bite."  They end up loving it.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Used fat free cheddar and low fat cottage cheese to cut calories and fresh chile peppers from the garden because I had to use them up.  Will definitely make again.

I wasn't sure how this was going to go over with my other half... it's a little strange to have cottage cheese in your eggs/quiche, but we had lots of cottage cheese to use up since it wasn't getting eaten. This proved to be a good way to use it up and get lots of protein! My homemade pie crust suffered (I should've par-baked) so we ended up eating it crustless (which I prefer anyways). I omitted the butter, used fresh spinach (chopped up), and white whole wheat flour. Beautiful presentation, very flavorful (1 can of chilies is plenty), it made for a great light dinner tonight!

This is one of the best quiches I have ever had! I used the pre-made pie crust from Whole Foods and used fresh roasted green chiles I bought from the farmer's market. I also sauteed 1/2 of a yellow onion with fresh spinach (instead of using frozen spinach) and added that to the mix. Will definitely make this again!

My family really liked this quiche, and I'll make it again... but I made many of the revisions others have suggested, plus several of my own. (1) Crustless would've been better (very rich... you wouldn't even miss the crust!) ; (2) Divided soft cheese between cottage and ricotta ; (3) Divided recipe in half for only three in my family - divided easy ; (4) Used 1 cup chopped fresh spinach (available year-round... why would you use frozen??) ; (5) Used 1 small HOT chili (yum!)... again: Why canned?  (6) Completely eliminated the butter.  Not sure what that's for!  Not needed.  I baked my quiche pie in a 9" glass pie dish, sprayed with pan spray.  It came out great.  We have leftovers, and the consistency is great next day for quick, on-the-go breakfasts.  Is a good recipe.  Make it your "own".  Recommended.

I made this tonight - the whole recipe in a 9x13 pan - to eat for the next few days' of breakfast (it's only the two of us here!) And I just had to give in and try a little piece tonight. Wow, so good. I have made quiches before and learned that I prefer them without crust, so it was an easy transition for me to make in a pan, though not authentic I'm sure! Anyway, the only thing I changed was to add two roma tomatoes and use 10oz of fresh bagged spinach instead of frozen. (I sauteed the spinach on the stove with a little minced garlic and a little butter plus a little margarine. Doesn't take long to cook down, just stop when it's soft but still a bright green.) The tomatoes added a little texture variety and I love them in just about everything eggy. As for the chiles, I really wanted a spicier outcome because we have learned to love the green chile spiciness. So I will probably look into an alternative to the jarred ones I bought, though they were labeled 'hot.' Also, I just spooned in half the jar since it was 16oz in size. I didn't worry too much about the extra liquid. No issues whatsoever with it setting up beautifully! We'll definitely make this again!

Oh my goodness, excellent.  Used fresh green chile - about 1 cup instead of the canned.  Fabulous.

I added onions to this and baked it in a 9 x 9 pan with no crust.  I also mixed it with my KA mixer to get the lumps out of the flour mixture when added to the eggs.  Very simple and yummy!

I reduced the recipe by a third so it would fit in one big pie dish. I did use 2 cans of chili though. I used the cheese that I had - Dubliner and Feta (I bet any kind of cheese is good) plus I sautéd fresh spinach with some onion and added chopped turkey sausage. It was super delicious!

This is my go-to quiche now.  I added 1/2 pound of browned sausage and used cheddar cheese.  The green chiles really make this recipe great, especially with the spicy sausage.  I have also added asparagus cut on a 1" diagonal and pre-cooked til bite tender before adding it to the egg mixture.  I have made it successfully in my convection oven: 375 degrees for 15 minutes, then 325 degrees for 30 minutes.  The conventional oven works just as well.  I recommend using a baking sheet under the foil pan to make transferring easy.  The crust turns out great! Always get rave reviews!

I've never been a big fan of quiche , but this is a fantastic recipe! The only substitutes made were fresh organic steamed spinach instead of frozen. Fresh roasted hatch green chilies instead of canned. Fresh free range chicken eggs, and I also added organic mushrooms to the recipe!

I added a lb of cooked breakfast sausage. Every thing else per the recipe. Makes enough for Sunday school snacks for the adults. Guys and gals both love it!
This is the third time I've made it and it's always a hit and easy to made. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because I love quiche. I used fresh baby kale instead of the spinach sauteed with onions and some red peppers. This quiche is very fluffy not heavy. I'm not making it a five star review because I don't think there is enough seasoning in the basic recipe. Next time I make it I will be adding some garlic powder and a little cayenne pepper and some bacon. This is a great basic recipe and the only quiche that does not call for milk or heavy cream. It is also one that very versatile.

Easy and tasty! I tried it again today with some substitutions based on what I had on hand  (cream cheese instead of cottage cheese, sharp cheddar instead of Co-Jack, jalepenos instead of green chiles, broccoli instead of spinach) and it was great, too.

This recipe is wonderful just like it is.  I did add some chopped onion, fresh spinach, garlic salt, lemon pepper, and some chopped red bell pepper for color.  I also used this basic recipe for Crab Quiche.  I followed this basic recipe only without the spinach and reducing the green chilies and adding the crab. I also added some green and red diced bell peppers, chopped onion, garlic salt, lemon pepper, and a little cayenne. I always make my quiche crustless by adding 1/4 cup of gluten-free flour.  Oh, my gosh.  This recipe is out-of-this-world delicious both ways.  UPDATE:  We love this recipe in our household.  I made this again last night, but did not have any bell peppers, so I decided to add a can of drained Rotel tomatoes.  It, too, was delicious.

This came out really really good and was a huge favorite at my breakfast potluck!  I added bell peppers, green onions and asparagus and used pepperjack cheese instead. I also left out the spinach. You can honestly substitute with any veggies or add meat and it will still be delicious.

This was delicious! I made this almost completely to the recipe specifications; the only changes I made were to adjust for our tastes, so I am confident in giving this a 5 star review (NOT something I do often!).  Changes: used fresh cooked spinach instead of frozen, added caramelized onions, added chicken sausage, and added some cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes for a little more heat. This made exactly enough for two 9 inch rounds; so I made the first one in a frozen pie crust, and the second in a crust-less pie dish. Essentially, I made a quiche and a frittata. Honestly, both were delicious. The pie crust didn't really add anything extra, so next time I will probably make this without the crust and eliminate those unnecessary calories. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this quiche and more importantly, my husband and son devoured it! I changed the recipe slightly: reduced flour by half, removed cottage cheese/colby jack and added feta cheese, sauteed onions and didn't add the melted butter. Amazing!

I really wondered about using cottage cheese in a quiche, but  have to say this was the best quiche I have ever had. I made it for Mother's Day and every bite was gone. It was easy and delicious.

This was absolutely amazing!  Easy and came out perfect!  I added chopped ham and used a Mexican cheese blend rather than Colby-Jack.

made as per recipe, except only made half.  I used a 7 oz can of green chiles instead of 4 oz as that was what I had on hand.  added about 3 oz of chopped cooked italian sausage, and omitted the butter.  cooked in an 8x8 pan for a bout 5 minutes longer than recipe called for.  This was SOOOOOO  GOOOD  !!!!!!!  will be making it often.  thanks for the recipe, nica36!!!

This is amazing! I made it as one of the main dishes for a friends bridal shower and was nervous as I have never made quiche before. A HUGE hit. Every piece was gone and nearly all 30 ladies at the party came up to me raving about the food, especially this. Only thing I did different was chopped up a large tube of fresh spinach instead of frozen and made my own pie crust.  
Can't wait to make it for my Dad's birthday.

This was delicious. I made this quiche exactly as directed, minus the crusts. I stretched out flaky rolls from the tube, made cups in a muffin pan and filled each cup with the quiche mixture. I baked the quiche cups at 350 degrees for approx 25 min to 30 min. While the rolls call for different baking times, they turned out to be very forgiving from the muffin pan, and I was able to cook the quiche as long as I needed. They came out fantastic! My only gripe is I wish I had more muffin pans, because it took me forever to cook all of the quiche cups. This recipe makes a ton of food, but we enjoyed every bit of them.

Seriously delicious! I made this for a church function and it was a hit. I didn't use the pie crusts, I just baked it in my rectangular casserole dish. I did add about 12 ounces of diced green chilis per other reviews and it could've even had a little more spice. Next time I might try shredded pepper jack cheese instead of the colby jack for a little extra kick. I highly recommend this!!

Tasty!  I am not a huge quiche lover so I normally would've given this 4 stars simply b/c quiche isn't my favorite food.  This probably was the best tasting quiche I've ever had though, so that makes it a five for me.  Kids didn't dig it, but that's their loss.  I made a whole wheat almond meal pie crust and it went well with this.  I omitted the butter (couldn't imagine why it would need it), used fresh spinach, and added some crumbled bacon.  If I ever happened to have a weird and out of the ordinary quiche craving, this would be the one I'd pick.

Best quiche ever!  I use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Plus, I saute 1/2 an onion and then cook down the fresh spinach with the onion before adding to quiche mixture.  Everyone I've served it to loves it!

This recipe was perfect. The quiche tasted lovely, very flavorful yet not overpowering. The green chilies were the perfect combination for the spinach. For a lighter dish, I completely omitted the butter and it still worked well (although it certainly wasn't as good as the times I left the butter in!).

I halved the recipe and made just a few small changes: Didn’t have canned chiles, so I used pepper jack cheese. There were six ounces left in my chunk, so I just used all of it. To balance out the extra cheese, I reduced the  butter to 2T. I also tossed a couple tablespoons worth of dehydrated chopped onions in with the squeezed-dry spinach and added a couple shakes of white pepper. The quiche turned out great, and I received a “I hope you make this again!” from my eldest!

This is a great basic quiche receipt! I don’t think the butter is necessary, and I prefer using just one can of chiles. I’ve always made this as a crust-less quiche, and recommend using fresh onion and zucchini as a fun alternative to spinach. This is a staple in our house, thanks for the great recipe!

Just needs a little "oomph".  I will definitely make it again but this time I will substitute Jalapeno Cheese for Colby-Monterey and will probably use fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.

This is one of my go-to supper recipes.  I do however use vegetable oil instead of melted butter as it's easier to blend in with the eggs.  I also like to add 1/4 tsp of dried thyme and either green or cooked yellow onion.

I made this pretty close to the original recipe (however I only had jack cheese) so I substituted that for the Colby and my family enjoyed it very much. My teenage son said it was the best quiche he had ever had. That’s saying a lot because he is very picky with veggie anything. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a delicious quiche with a lot fewer calories and fat than most - and no one would ever know.  I used low fat cottage cheese, cut the butter by half, and substituted liquid egg whites for half of the eggs.  It turned out great and tasted delicious.  Making my third time right now without green chiles for my teenage daughter.  I'm sure it will be be just as good!

I chose mild green chilies, and cut the salt, so my quiche was very mild.  That said, it was delicious, and a great way to pack in some protein for a picky eater.  Would like to do some more tinkering to make it gluten free.

Excellent quiche! So tasty. I halved the recipe and it was perfect. Added some sautéed onions, mushrooms and cooked some fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also substituted arrow root for the flour to keep it a little healthier. I left out the butter. Came out great! We will definitely be keeping this recipe.

This was awesome as is.  I did add additional spinach only because I love it.  Next time, will try adding mushrooms, red bell pepper, and a Serrano chile ( all lightly sauteed prior to adding )
But was SO good.  Make sure you make the  2,  I gave one to a friend ( who loved it ), but would be good to freeze one also
Looking forward to trying this crustless also
Thank you !!!

We really like this recipe. It makes 2 quiches so I considered halving it but decided to make it as the recipe called for. 

This made enough for 2 nights and I freezes the second one to serve at a later date.

I normally love quiche, but this one turned out very dry.  I suspect I overcooked it, although I followed the recipe exactly.  My teen-aged kids like it though so it got eaten.  I'll pass on making it again though.

Husband loves having these quiches for his breakfast.  The two last him a week.  I only use one cup cottage cheese and an eight ounce wedge of Mediterranean Gouda (available in deli cheese section of any large grocery store.) that I shred and I reduce a sixteen ounce box of fresh spinach in the butter.  The Mediterranean flavored Gouda really adds a wonderful punch.

I added ham, overall good, a little salty for my personal taste, will make it again, minus the pie crust which made it very heavy and carb filled. Not sure how to make a gluten free crust? Will experiment with it.

Since there are only 2 of us , I just made half the recipe with a few ingredient alterations:
1. Added cheddar cheese to the colby-jack
2. Substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese
3. Substituted fresh chard for the spinach
4. Added 3 oz of chopped canadian bacon

Reduced the  350 degree cooking time to 3o minutes since there was only 1 quiche to be cooked.

The results were exceptional even with the changes. Will keep this recipe for a group breakfeast or brunch. It could very well become one of my favorites.

We really liked this recipe.  I forgot to put in the butter, and it was still delicious.  I am sure that there are other veggie combinations that would work.  We used canned chopped green chilies, and it did not impart any spice to the dish.  I would probably use diced jalapeño for a bit of a kick.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch and it was delicious.  However,  the green chile flavor is prominent, so you must like green chiles to like this quiche.  I added approximately  1/4 cup of chopped sweet onion.  And, I made the quiche without a crust.  Lastly, I wanted only one quiche, so I cut the recipe in half but used the full 10 ounces of chopped spinach (with the liquid thoroughly squeezed out).  I will make this recipe again and may add some cooked bacon.

This was delicious. I think the addition of flour and baking powder made it rise and improved the texture over other quiche. The only change I made was to add just 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Always trying to make things healthier for my family.

This is the best! I used 1/2 the butter and sautéed the fresh spinach in it. NO crust either! Delish!! W/O crust, bake 15 min at 400 then 25min at 350.

I made this recipe as written using Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts.  It turned out perfectly and was delicious  with a side of salsa and fresh fruit for breakfast.  I think next time I will try to cut of some of the calories with reduced calorie ingredients though.

I haven't even finished eating this yet and I had to leave this review. And I have never reviewed anytime by before.
I made this recipe exactly as written and there is no reason to change a thing. I have a new reason to keep stocked up on green chilies and spinach.
My whole family loved it (1,7, and 10 year olds)

Great recipe! I added 1/2 cup cubed ham and used 3/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt - also makes great individual quiches in muffin tins (using paper muffin cups or phyllo dough.)

Very good quiche, 5 stars.  Made with chiles and spinach the first time, but you can put whatever you like in there instead. We Mix and match. Items like Cooked sausage, mushrooms, broccoli chunks of chicken etc. The base recipe is great.

I needed a recipe to help me use up some cottage cheese. I made it without a crust and baked it in a muffin tin to make individual portions (about 25 minutes at 350 degrees). I halved the recipe, and this gave me about 18 muffins. 

I omitted the spinach and used one four ounce can of diced roasted chile peppers as well as three fresh Anaheim peppers, deseeded and diced. I sauteed chopped onion and mushrooms in butter, followed by the fresh pepper. I added this mixture to the batter. I also used a combination of sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheeses for more flavor. Some garlic powder - although minced garlic might have been better. Didn't miss the spinach or the crust. I would probably make this again.

I made this, with homemade pie crust, for our B&B guests and it was wonderful. I wasn't sure how cottage cheese would taste in a quiche but it was GREAT. It made it light and fluffy, and did not taste "cottage cheesy" at all. :) I took one of them to work the next day. It was gobbled up, and I must say that sitting overnight in the fridge did NOT hurt it at all. It may have even tasted better rewarmed the next day!

I'm not a big fan of cooked spinach fan so I left it out and substituted an additional can of mild green chiles. (Two 4oz cans per quiche.) I also eliminated the pie crust and poured it directly into a lightly greased pie tin to reduce the carbs. It was terrific, easy, and will definitely be making it again. I might add bacon next time for variety, but not because it needed anything— it was delicious as-is.

I chose this recipe to make my first quiche because so many reviewers said that they made it exactly as written and it was great!  And it was!  I made this for dinner last night with fresh spinach that needed to be used up, but otherwise followed 1/2 the recipe to get one pie. It will be the only spinach quiche recipe I ever need!

This was just okay.  I added more salt, pepper and garlic powder and still felt this had very little flavor.  I don't think the spinach goes with green chili.  The green chili flavor is nice, but the spinach with it makes no sense.  This would need a lot more flavor for me to waste the time making it again.

Delicious!  I used about 5 fresh green chilies instead of the canned ones, removing the core and seeds. I also sautéed fresh spinach instead of frozen. The taste is great!

I followed the recipe but did not add the spinach. It turned out great. The only thing I will do differently in the future is to use more green chilies and use pepper jack cheese rather than cheddar.

No need to look any further! This is an easy quiche to make. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly-- and it was perfectly delicious! The second time, I halved the recipe for one pie and I used fresh spinach, which I sauteed with the butter called for and added in some diced mushrooms and ham-- it was fantastic. [Note: With the added ingredients there was a little extra mixture that didn't fit in the pie shell. So, I put it into small souffle cups and baked them along side the quiche for approx. 30min, removed them and finished cooking the quiche.] nom nom nom

I made this recipe for a work potluck in a 9x13 pan with fresh spinach and all Ricotta cheese (no cottage cheese). I baked it two nights ahead and kept it refrigerated until the morning-of, and warmed it at 200 degrees the morning-of. Turned out great, better than I expected! I only got one small piece and the rest was gobbled up. I even FORGOT to put in the package of cheddar until 15 minutes in to bake-time. I just stirred it in, and it was fine. Very forgiving recipe.

I cut recipe in half. Only made one. I also added mushrooms . I fix a ham steak marinated with brown sugar and bourbon. Fried apples and biscuits made it the perfect meal. Will be fixing this Quiche again. We loved it.

Very good and easy to put together - I used fat free yogurt instead of the cottage cheese and cheddar because that it what I had and it turned out fantastic.  I will probably add bacon and onions next time as others have suggested.

First quiche I've ever made, and it was really good.  I didn't use the butter or the crust, and it was still great.  I also used fresh spinach and Muenster cheese.  Next time, I'll make it with pepperjack and I'll add some red pepper & onion.  Very good recipe (and pretty healthy, too, with a few modifications!)

I have previously made this recipe as written and it always turns out amazing!

Some changes I've added over the years are: 
1) prebake the crust at 400 for 5 minutes to ensure no soggy crust
2) I like to add double the cheese (colby and swiss) and a diced medium onion
3) I don't like cottage cheese but don't skip it or replace it with low fat cottage cheese - it adds extra creaminess and structure to the quiche
4) I add a pound or so of bacon, ham chunks, or sausage and can still fit the mix into 2 pie crusts
5) this recipe is also delicious cooked in two 8x8 or 9x9 pans, just make sure it's pretty thick or it gets dry

This quiche is easy and basically foolproof!

This was my first time making a quiche, and it turned out great!  The vegetables I used were fresh: dethawed frozen kale, 1 medium onion, 2 green bell peppers, 1 small red bell pepper.  I used the cheese as suggested.  Great recipe!

A really good recipe . . . very tasty, simple ingredients, easy to make, and easily altered to individual preferences. Omitted the pie crusts and 1/2 cup butter. Used 1/2 cup flour equally divided between whole wheat and all-purpose flours. Rather than 2 cups small curd cottage cheese, subbed 1 cup part skim ricotta cheese & 1 cup 1% milk fat small curd cottage cheese. Used 10 ounces fresh baby spinach rather than frozen, and an extra 4 ounce can green chilies. Added 12 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms and 1 sweet onion since more veggies were desired. Sautéed onions and mushrooms in 1 tablespoon bacon grease, and then added baby spinach to barely wilt it. The quiche mixture nearly filled a 9" x 13" baking dish which was used rather than 2 pie dishes. The baking time increased about 15 minutes. With a dozen eggs in this recipe, this dish came closer to a breakfast casserole than a quiche but it’s still delicious by any name. Thanks nica36 for sharing your recipe.

Fabulous!!!  I made this exactly as written, and it turned out perfectly.  The green chiles were an unexpected delight, as I wouldn't have thought to combine them with spinach, but the flavor was awesome!!

The BEST quiche I've ever made! Followed the directions exactly.  I was very happy, and my guests were all impressed.  I used mild green chilies, but I might try using some that are hotter.  I loved it in any case.

Loved this!!! Delicious...So I made one with a walnut/pecan crust and one without...so you totally don't need a crust...I used all egg whites...I didn't have cottage cheese so I used greek yogurt...I did not use butter at all...I also added extra spinach, green chiles, and bacon crumbled...My husband had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner :)

I just made this recipe with a store bought pie crust.  This Green Chile Spinach Quiche is the best quiche recipe I have ever tasted!  Very Good!

One of the best quiches I've had (and made!) The green chilis in this recipe make it amazing and the texture is great. Definitely will make this again!
