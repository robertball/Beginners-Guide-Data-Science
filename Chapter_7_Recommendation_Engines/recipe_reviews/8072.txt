I am a baker in Los Angeles and I make this cake for my customers and they just love it.  If you don't grease the pan properly it will stick so that is most important.  When I make it I alternate the flavors.  I use vanilla, Maple, banana, coconut and butter. Or I use butter, lemon, vanilla, almond and coconut. Thanks for this recipe!!

This recipe is a family & friends favorite. Every gathering, being holiday or not, this is the most asked for dessert.  Hint......beat eggs seperately for at least 3 mintues before adding too your butter, shortening and sugar....a must have.

This is the best pound cake!!!!!!  I leave out the rum extract and add almond and orange instead.  It freezes very well also.  I use 3 disposable loaf pans instead of a bundt cake.  Eat one.  Freeze two for later!!!!  8-)

I made this for a large family Xmas Eve party and received rave reviews. NOTE: it barely fits in a 10-in bundt cake pan...recommend you place aluminum foil under pan in case of minor overflow

This recipe is fantastic! I never change anything. The flavor is perfect, the texture is perfect and the glaze just makes this one complete cake. As far as it being too sweet..... I'm not sure what everyone is talking about. It's perfect. Not too plain and not too sweet. The only suggestion I have about this recipe if you are making it for the first time, follow the instructions exactly! That includes the baking time. Do not bake any longer than the suggested time otherwise it could come out too dry. And yes you can change the extracts to the flavors you like but it's already perfect the way it is. I've made this cake several times now and I love it more and more each time. My co-workers love it too!

I tried the recipe for Thanksgiving and it turned out excellent.  I used butter crisco instead of plain shortening.

I have been making a cake similar to this for years only with a yellow cake mix.  When I went to the pantry for the cake mix, I found it expired in 2008!  So I found this recipe to make the cake from scratch.  I used oil instead of shortening and I didn't have any problem with the cake sticking.  I also doubled the glaze and added 8 tablespoons of butter to it.  I always find that glazed cakes don't seem to absorb the glaze very well and end up sitting in a pool of it.  So after turning the cake out of the pan I let it cool completely.  Then I put the cake back in the pan and punched big holes in the bottom of it with a chopstick.  I spooned about 2/3 of the glaze over the perferated cake bottom, let it sit for a few minutes to absorb the glaze, then inverted the cake onto a cake plate.  I poked some smaller holes in the top of the cake with a skewer and brushed the remaining glaze on with a pastry brush.  The glaze ended up perfectly saturating the cake and we just loved it.  I'm never going back to a cake mix again!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great tasting cake...I love the fact that you can personalize it to your own taste buds...you can use whatever combination of extracts you want to, as long as you use 5 teaspoons.  I have made this cake three times and it is always a huge hit...Just be sure and use spray Pam or some other form of shortening on your bundt pan, to prevent any sticking to the pan issue.

One of my favorie recipes....makes great layers for birthday, wedding cakes. I usually cut flavorings to 3/4 teaspoon(include almond flavoring) and omit glaze for a more subtle flavor. I also use whipping cream or half-and-half for extra richness.

Soo delicious and easy!!! Followed recipe exactly.UPDATE: How can you change so many ingredients in a recipe and then when it fails, you low rate the recipe? This happens sooo much on this site, and a lot of recipes are actually great, but a low rating can turn some people away before they even try it!!! I'm just sayin'

Hands Down the best pound cake I have ever made. Per other reviews/suggestions, I creamed the butter, shortening and sugar for 4 min and beat 1 min after adding each egg. I also used lemon, orange, coconut, almond and vanilla extracts. The density and flavor were perfect. This will be my new go to recipe for all types of occassions. Thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe and I found it to taste awfully lemony. Next time, I wont use any lemon extract. After a day, the pound cake tasted old, dry and worthless. Its only good fresh.

I've been making this cake for about 20 years, but have used almond flavoring rather than rum. (I'm sure rum would be great too)  But this recipe suggestion to drizzle the boiled glaze on top of cake over wax paper, is messy and wasteful, as too much drips off, no matter how careful you try to be.  My recipe calls for glaze to be poured over hot cake right in the pan. Then, after glaze is absorbed, turn cake out of pan and continue cooling.  Always delicious and never messy.

Very dangerous!  I never should've made this, it's too easy to eat more than you should.   I didn't use the glaze (ran out of extract) but it didn't need it anyway.  I made sure to mix the fats and sugar for a good 3 or 4 minutes and each egg invidually for about a minute each.  Super great texture.  The best pound cake I've ever made!

Great recipe.  This is a great recipe for a 5 flavor or for a one flavor such as vanilla, lemon, or rum cake.  Just double the particular flavor only  that you want to use.  For the people that rated it as spongy im sure they tasted it straight out of the oven.   After 3-4 hours it has set and it it dense, moist, perfect, and bakery quality.  I sifted powdered sugar on top and my family loved it.  Also I recommend using a good quality bundt, tube, or loaf pan!.   I recommend Calphalon products which can be found at Bed Bath and beyond, Macy's and any other nice retailers.  Also I use a Kitchen aid stand mixer.  Remember you cant expect  professional taste and quality using cheap pans and a $5 mixer.  You do get what you pay for.  The good non-stick pans really are worth it.  No problem sticking.  I just lightly spray with Pam.  Also I had to cut the cooking time down to  1hr and 20 min and the edges were  just slightly over brown so please stick that knife in to check after an hour and 10 mins and watch it!  Ovens vary so you can just take the time on a cake recipe and go with it.  Good Luck. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was the best most moist pound cake I have ever made! I only changed a few things. I dont really like coconut so i only added half of the coconut extract and substitited more butter extract! I also used another members suggestion and added 3/4 cup half and half and 1/4 cup milk. For the glaze, I poured the glaze on the cake and then sprinkled coarse raw sugar on top while it was still warm. This gave the cake a little sweet crunch! Yummmmmmmmmm

This is a very good pound cake recipe, but the rum flavor is overpowering.  Also, the cake is sweet enough without the glaze.  With the flavor adjustment and no glaze, this is a very good recipe for pound cake using everyday ingredients.

Yum!! Went heavier on the vanilla, and lighter on the coconut, since we're not huge fans. It was wonderful. Nice dense texture with moist, fine crumb. Works well for torting, as shown in the picture. Excellent.

I made this cake for the repast after my hubby's grandma's funeral. I omitted the coconut extract, because I also made a coconut cake, and double the vanilla instead. I also forgot to add the glaze while the cake was still warm and instead added it after the cake had cooled. It was still delicious and very moist. One person even said it tasted better than a neighborhood bakery that everyone around here loves. What a compliment! Will use again for customers who want layer cakes made with pound cake. I always use Wilton's "Bake Easy!" and NEVER have a problem with my cakes sticking.

My gourmet cook friend LOVES this cake.  It gets better & better each day so is a great recipe to do days ahead.  Also the glaze topping makes it a very easy cake to transport. I did follow reevious reviews about beating the eggs for several minutes & putting foil under the pan (mine always spills over thru the middle hole of the bundt pan).

My mother has made a version of this recipe for the past 25 years. Instead of 1/2 t. baking powder she actually uses 1 t. for a "fluffier" cake. For those of you who find some of the extracts overpowering be sure you are measuring correctly or simply use 1/2 t. of the extracts instead of a whole teaspoon.

5 stars. I think I would have liked the glaze better with lemon juice for part of the water, so I will do that next time. Otherwise, I have no complaints :) (This recipe DID stick to my tube pan, but I used Baker's Joy instead of shortening/flour, just testing it out. It didn't destroy my cake, but I would go with actual shortening and flour next time, personally.) Using skim milk and making no other changes yielded a 16-slice cake with 442 calories per slice.

This is a wonderful cake. I used orange, vanilla, lemon, butter, coconut flavors instead of using rum. Even better the next day. I first made this cake in 06 and have been making it ever since. Always make this cake a day ahead. I used a angel food cake bunt pan. While it is still hot pook the holes in it with a something thin, and pour on the syrup let it stand for a day in the pan.

We thought this cake was good. I was a little worried about all the different flavors, but they blended well together, and no one flavor dominated. It was a little bit sweet for my taste, but my husband enjoyed it. The texture was nice, and it was moist. I may try topping it with strawberries or peaches with whipped cream. Ours did stick in the pan, so next time I'll flour the pan, as well as greasing it.

This is so similar to a recipe that has been handed down for eons in my family. We don't use the lemon flavoring, just the rest. Key tricks to making this come out perfect every time: all ingredients at room temp. before starting, I use the Pam flour baking spray, cake flour and always, always put a cookie sheet under the pan to catch the overflow.  Oh, and then make darn sure the dog can't get to it. Thanks for including the glaze-I lost that part of the recipe.

A fantastic cake, it has a perfect pound cake density, and is very moist.  My kids don't like coconut so I used almond flavoring, although I think the flavors can be pretty interchangeable.  It totally filled my bundt pan, I'll probably use 3 loaf pans next time.  Very important to grease and flour the pan.

Wonderful!  I am 51 years old and have been cooking since I was 9.  Needless to say, I've made my share of pound cakes.  A year or so ago I was on the quest for the perfect pound cake recipe.  I made one each week for 5 weeks and finally gave up - not that they were bad, they just weren't exceptional.  This recipe is!  I made it 3 days ago and me and my husband have eaten half of it already! I took the advice of others and beat the eggs for about 4 minutes by themselves.  I then added the butter, sugar, and butter flavored Crisco and creamed those along with the eggs.  I did not deviate from the recipe ingredients and followed the rest of the directions as given.  It has a crispy top crust, is beautifully golden brown, and the flavor gets better with each day. I've found my forever pound cake recipe!!  Thank you PJ!!

Absolutely delicious!!! Very moist and flavorful. I didn't have rum or butter flavor extracts so I used almond and banana extracts instead.  My husband loved it. He said it's the best pound cake he's ever tasted. It's the best cake I've tasted too. I wasn't a fan of pound cake before but I'll definitely be eating this one.

I spent $12 dollars on flavoring for this cake.  Don't waste your money.  It's a really sweet, fat, cake with little flavor.  Taste like a yellow cake mix with butter and coconut.  Nothing special, and I wont be making it again.

Great recipe!  I substituted the lemon extract for pineapple extract and the butter extract for almond extract.  So good!  May be the best cake I've ever tasted!  I have people offering big bucks every time I bake this for me to bake them one.  Also, I started bake them in smaller bundt cakes pans, one to share and one to keep.

This cake is so good but a little to sweet. Next time I will make these adjustments: Cut the Sugar to 2 1/2 cups and beat the egg yolks until pale and beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, then fold them into the batter.  This makes for a not so pound of a pound cake.

This has long been one of my favorite cakes. My mom has been making this cake for years. In our family, it's known as the Watkins Five Flavor cake as my mom's recipe is from Watkins.   I don't recommend mixing up the combination of extracts. If you really want to enjoy the deliciousness of this cake use the exact five extracts listed in the recipe. The rum and coconut extracts are what make the flavor of this cake so good. My mom's glaze recipe also includes 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the lemon, coconut, butter, rum, and vanilla extracts.

Thanks for sharing this deliciously dense, moist pound cake, PJ. The mix of flavors is truly a delight to the tastebuds. I made it in a tube pan and left off the glaze. Its very lovely without the glaze.

OMG! This pound cake is absolutely the BEST!  I followed the recipe pretty much as is.  I did not have any problem with the cake sticking to the pan.  I used a non-stick spring-form pan and greased it lightly just as a precaution after reading the reviews.  I also cut down the sugar to 2-1/2 cups and it was delicious.  Whenever I make a cake I always use cake flour because I believe the cake comes out lighter.  This pound cake was dense as it shoud be for a pound cake, but still fluffy.  I also followed the suggestion of beating the eggs separately, then added the 1/2 and 1/12, and extracts to the milk/egg mixture.  Then I added the egg mixture alternately with the flour/baking soda mixture.  I used 1 teaspoon of the following extracts:  coconut, almond, vanilla, rum and orange.  The combination of flavors blended well and the flavor was absolutely wonderful. It took willpower to only eat 1 piece!  I used 1/2 and 1/2 (part milk and part cream) but I think it would be just as good using all whole milk.  Thank you for this recipe.  I can't wait to make it for our next family get-to-gether because I am sure everyone will love it! I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!

This cake is AMAZING!! Took it to my mom's Easter Sunday and my husband renamed it the Evil Addiction Cake! Only change I made was swapping out the butter extract for almond (to clone a local baker's flavors), and omitted the glaze. It is perfect without the glaze! Not too sweet or heavy, and SUPERMOIST. I used my Kitchen Aid and let it beat the fool out of the batter. I only needed 80 min of bake time. My husband already asked for me to bake another one, and he just finished the last of it this morning!

I used coconut, rum, almond, vanilla & lemon extract and the flavor was very good! However this recipe MUST be made with regular sugar. I tried it with Splenda, and the consistency was thicker and drier. But I had no choice, as I was making it for my parents who are diabetics. To fix the dryness, I made a simple frosting of sour cream and cream cheese with a bit of sugar and almond extract. It made it a bit more moist and it was alright. Also, I had to bake it for less time, since it started to brown right away! Around 1 hour worked fine.  I also omitted the final sugar glaze. I think that I may try it again with a bit more shortening and perhaps butter to try and make it more moist.

This was yummy!  I did not use all the flavorings, simply because I did not have them, but that I am sure would have made even better.  I just used approx 5 tsp of homemade vanilla instead.   I also made a chocolate sauce with semi sweet chocolate instead of the really sweet glaze.  The combination was delicious, and not too sweet.

This is very good!  Changed only a few things, I used an angel food pan and omitted the coconut extract, (I'm allergic).  It cooked beautifully, made the house smell wonderful and removed from pan without any trouble.  On top of glaze I added dusting of powdered sugar and maraschino cherries.  It worked beautifully for my sons 19th birthday!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was really yummy, although not quite as I expected judging from the other reviews. I used coconut, almond, rum, lemon and vanilla flavouring, and although it turned out really yummy, I couldn't really taste the added flavours. It just tasted like a really good, plain pound cake. Although... that may be because I used "essences" not "extracts".. just realised that extracts are probably stronger. Will add more essence in then next time! 

I poured the glaze on top, though I didn't used all of it, and I added milk to it to soften the sweetness. I also reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and it was still nice and sweet.

Also, next time I think I will add some sliced apples coated in lemon and cinnamon at the top before baking, I think it will go perfect with my cake's flavours!

This cake was as good as the one my grandma used to make. I left the ingredients exactly as listed and to me, each flavor was unique and wonderful. I used Crisco and flour on my pan, worked great! I store leftover cake in a big ziplock baggie and its maintains moisture for three days or so.

Great taste! Must love coconut. When it says "large bowl" it means "huge bowl". It could easily fit into 3 8" loaf pans. I greased one pan with butter and butter/floured the other - neither one stuck to the metal pans. I decreased heat by 25-40 degrees and cooked about 75+ mins. The glaze helps soften the crust so the knife just glides right through. Yum! Family and friends loved it - except for the anti-coconut members.

My older sister makes this cake all times of the year. I think she follows it as is. We love this cake with or without the glaze. My grandmom and aunt who are diabectis love this cake too and it is not that sweet as some of the other reviews state. Try if for yourself and see. I was not sure when my sister told me about this cake because of all the flavors but we now request this cake at a moments notice.

Very tasty recipe. I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 cups which was just the right amount of sweetness. I added raisins and nuts to add texture. It came out delicious and moist.

I baked the cake in a jelly roll pan and only had to bake it for 35 minutes... let it cool and cut into bite size cubes and decorated the tops with a fresh berry and spiked them with party tooth picks and dusted them with icing sugar... they were a hit... Love the flavour..

I made this cake last night and ate 1 piece, it was good. I ate 1 piece this morning and WOWWOWWOWWOWWOW! I is bakery quality and beyond! I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, out of regular, and after I glazed it I sprinkled sugar in the raw on top  as suggested on a review and the sparkle and crunch topped it off perfectly!!!! This is the best cake I have ever tried and I actually made it from scratch.

This is the best pound cake ever!  Everytime I make it I get great reviews.  The only thing that I do different is that I use almond flavoring in place of rum.  I love how you can use different flavors.  Quick and easy to make!

What an absolute hit! I thought that allowing this cake to go in the oven for the prescribed time was going to hurt it, but it didn't. This cake took exactly 1 hour and 45 minutes to bake to perfection (in my oven). I deviated somewhat - I didn't have "butter extract" so I added half a stick more butter. The family loved it! It is now on my menu of "favorite cakes." Thanks Brotha Percy

I love this recipe. It's been a classic in our family for years. I think it's even better the next day severed chilled. My husband loves to eat it for breakfast.

This cake came out great. I made it for a pot luck and a repast. It just disappears. I only made one substitution and that was almond flavoring for the coconut. I am not a fan of coconut. The cake received rave reviews.

This is the same as my Grandma's recipe card (remember those) except she doubled the sugar and water in the glaze and adds a teaspoon of almond to just the glaze.  HELPFUL HINTS.  Use 'unsalted butter', Don't scrimp or substitute ingredients (this doesn't  include your flavor choices, go wild), Beat eggs for three minutes before combining, Combine the wet and dry by slicing through the mixture with a spatula (be gentle), Use parchment paper in the bottom of your pan.  Grandma's recipe suggests slowly spooning a third of the glaze over hot cake in the pan, wait five minutes, spoon another third, wait 5 minutes, etc.  Let the cake cool in the pan.  Seems like too much liquid but, trust me, it will absorb every drop and be the best pound cake you've ever eaten.

Great, great cake. My first attempt came out dry with a crackly dry top. I believe I beat it too much after each egg. So I deleted the shortening and added a stick of butter. I also increased the glaze by 1/2, added almond and orange extracts and deleted a 1/2 cup of sugar. I used a 10-in dark metal bundt pan at 325 degrees for 1 hr and 20 min. It was perfect!!! Nice golden brown on top. I like to wait until the next day before I eat it so that it can settle. It tastes great with ice cream or for those who like cake with their coffee in the morning.

I made this cake in two 8 inch rounds. There was way too much batter so it over flowed, a lot. But the cake was absolutely wonderful. I baked them for approximately 70 minutes and they were done. 
I also added 1tbl lemon juice and the zest of one lemon  and omitted the coconut, lemon, rum and butter flavor. 

I iced with butter cream in a layer cake, received very good reviews! I'll make this again with less sugar, because I did find that to be slightly overwhelming

This pound cake is excellent! It's a keeper. I only had the vanilla and lemon flavorings and I didn't have milk, so I used half-n-half. For the glaze, I used vanilla and almond. Everyone loved it!

Incredible and delectable!  The flavors are copiously harmonious, especially if you make it a day ahead  prior to serving; it will be out of this world!  I didn't need the glaze and omitted the shortening; added Malibu Coconut rum, orange extract; used buttermilk and self-rising flour from Allrecipe. Line the bottom of the oven, batter spilled over my 10 inch bundt pan.  Baked for 1 hr 15 mins. In Love...

Wonderful cake!  Everybody enjoyed it and no one would let me take the leftovers to work.  You know a recipe is a keeper when there's a fight over what's left.  

I used coconut extract instead of lemon just based on person preference and a few reviews and it was yummy!  I also had a dark bundt pan and then outside turned out a bit darker than a few pictures listed.  I cooked for 90 minutes and I definitely wouldn't go much longer than that.

Good taste and easy to follow. My cake came out a little dry but I'm not as good at baking cakes. I made a few additions - 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 tsp of salt otherwise I followed the directions. I will try again until I master it!

The cake was delicious.  You must love coconut because it is the essence that overpowers the cake.  I did not glaze the cake either.  I only gave it 4 stars because, although it didn't fall apart,  the crust did stick a little to the pan and did not look very pretty to serve it whole.  I guarantee there is a 50/50 chance of your cake sticking; you will need to judge whether you are willing to take that chance:)  I ended up slicing it and arranging it nicely on a platter.  Would be nice to serve with some strawberries and whipcream.  May make it again, but not sure.

Just baked this cake tonight.  I used a 12 cup angelfood pan and there was no overflow and the cake did not stick.  I used Baker's Joy to coat the pan.  I took the advice of so many others and did not make the glaze.  Loved the crusting of the cake.  I used almond in place of butter.  My hubby couldn't taste the different flavors though I could somewhat.  Are the extracts everyone using all natural, imitation or mixed.  This is a good cake and would be a good base for a 1 flavor styled cake.  I would make again.

This is a heavily requested cake among my family and friends. I use lemon, coconut, vanilla, almond and butter extracts. I love that it is so moist. It really doesn't need a glaze or an icing, but you can if you want to.

Recently I made this cake 3 times in one week! Once for the house, once for my mom's Bible study group and once for a reunion. Everyone loved it!! I have been using this recipe for a few years and it comes out great every single time. Definitely grease and flour the pan for smooth turn out. 5 stars!!

Delicious cake.  I made it for a church meeting and it was well received.  One of the most moist recipes I have ever tried.  I used coconut, almond, vanilla, lemon and butter flavors. My husband requested that I make more glaze to put on it but i thought it was fine as is.  Highly recommended. Will make again!

Good pound cake! I greased and floured the pan and it came out as soon as I turned it over. I used vanilla-butter-coconut-almond and banana extracts. And the glaze made it perfect. Yum!

I thought this cake was pretty tasty but my husband and my mother didn't like it :(  My mom said that there were too many flavors and my husband said he prefers a spicier pound cake (?) Oh-well.  Give it a try it's a personal preference thing, it bakes up beautifully!

This was good.  With all the extracts, it tasted a bit "artificial"...use real when you can, and I would recommend reducing by 1/2 tsp.  I think the sugar could also be reduced.  I read the other reviews on this and decided to make the recipe as is without reducing the sugar.  I love sweet, so that's not usually a problem for me.  But this was very sweet, and it formed a very hard sugar crust on the top.  Also, I baked for 1.5 hours and still could have reduced my time by probably about 5-10 minutes I'd guess.

I've used this method of applying multiple flavors to both a buttermilk and a cream cheese pound cake.  The flavor is amazing.   My mother always request the 5 flavor pound cake.  My oldest sister who is an avid baker has been trying to get the recipe from me.  But I won't tell.   I normally use 2 tsps of the Vanilla and cut back on the rum.  As some have noted depending the the brand of rum flavor that you purchase, it's flavor can overpower the others.    Thank you for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was a nice, moist and dense cake but I gave it 4 stars because I found it too sweet for me. But that is just my personal preference. I think I will definitely try it again but with less sugar and maybe skip the glaze.

I am rating this 3* because it stuck to my bundt very badly despite the fact that I read the reviews and was conscious of greasing it very well.  I used a "heavy decorative" pan.  It was disappointing.  I also used reg. rum as I didn't have extract.  I replaced a bit of the milk with the rum and "think" I used a bit too much.  The cake was tasty and moist, but I'm not sure any better (in my opinion) than the cake mix bundt cakes that I often make.  I probably will try it again with a different pan and with the coconut extract which I didn't have this time.

Excellent recipe.  I got lots of compliments.  I made as written, with the exception of changing some of the extracts.  As other reviewers have said, it doesn't really matter which ones you add so long as you add 5 tsp.  I chose lemon, butter, vanilla, almond, and orange.

I made this for a bake sale that my work was having and all of it sold! I didn't have the rum or coconut at the time, but I used honey with the others. People loved it! One man bought a piece and said he was coming back for more! Everyone was asking what I put in it! Awesome!

Although I do not normally review, if I haven't followed the recipe exact , I believe my changes were very small. I did not use coocnut nor butter extract. I did however use orange extracts with the other flavorings. Very good pound cake went ove big at the meeting I brought it to. The longer it sits the moister it gets!

Actually didn't like the five flavors.  Would have left out lemon and maybe coconut.  The cake had a bit of a artificial flavoring with all the different clashing flavors.  The texture was good.  But the glaze would be better left off.  It was just flavored sugar water and made the cake too sweet.  Maybe if you add some milk to the glaze, it might help.

Good flavor, but I had the same problem as another reviewer, and the bundt did not turn out.  (Tragic!  It's for Easter dinner later today!)  I have made many bundts with no problems, well-greased/floured the pan, etc....next time I will not use all of the batter to make sure it does not rise over the lip, and let it cool longer than 10 minutes since it is so moist.  Salvaged it by cubing and pouring the syrup over the cubes in a casserole to soak for a few hours.  I'll end up spreading whipped topping over it and making strawberry syrup for serving.

This pound cake is AMAZING!! It's just what I remember my mom making when I was a child. The cake is so moist and delicious. I think I needed to butter the pan a little more; cause my cake kinda came out in a lot of pieces... but it didn't matter to me because it tasted just as good ;)

I replaced butter flavoring with orange.  This cake was very moist and tasty. I followed the recipe and used extra "Baker's Joy". A 10 in bundt pan was used and I still had enough for a round 9 inch pan.  This cake really puffs up and is very moist. I will make this again and again.

I took others suggestions.  I made sure all ingredients were room temp, used cooking spray (my cake did not stick) and put foil under my pan in the oven.  Some reviews had mentioned that the lemon flavor was strong, I left out the lemon and replaced it with almond extract.  I cooked this cake 1hr and 45 minutes, next time I will leave it in longer the crust was golden but it could have went longer.  I followed the directions and put it on a cooling rack.  It stuck to the cooling rack, next time I will spray the cooling rack.  I did not use the glaze and was glad because the cake was sweet enough without it. My husband loved the cake and requested a second one.

WINNER!  That's all I can say.  A very versitile cake you should keep in your 'always satisfies' file.  Great, from an after school snack to an eligant, fancyful center piece sure to please all.  Easy to mix, a joy to bake from bundt to layer or loaf.  Great for the CAKE IN A JAR recipe to present as gifts.  Enjoy the happiness you will create with this pound (or more) of sheer pleasure.  Happy Holidays.

My husband is very picky when it comes to desserts and he LOVES this cake.  I made it with lemon, vanilla, rum, and pumpkin spice extracts (because those are the only four flavors we had in the house).  I took other reviewers' advice and beat the eggs separately before adding them to the creamed sugar.  I also lightly floured the bundt pan after oiling it.  The cake was perfectly baked after an hour and 30 minutes in the oven.  I was able to dump it neatly from the bundt pan onto the cooling rack without any pieces breaking off the cake.  I've stored it at room temperature in a cake display stand, tightly sealed in plastic wrap to preserve freshness (although at the rate my husband is eating it, the cake won't last for long anyway!). Excellent recipe! Will be a staple in our home.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I greased AND floured the pan) and the cake was delicious--the best pound cake I've ever made.  I will definitely make it again.

everyone who tries this one loves it! we substitute rum flavoring for the lemon, and it's just as awesome. one of these cakes was donated to a local fundraiser, and it brought $90 at auction! I make 2 for holidays just to have enough. It's great with strawberries and whipped cream too.

This is my favorite cake to make for the holidays!  It actually makes a great gift to give to families!  Everyone loves this cake.  We call it "Pound Cake Surprise" because each bite is a different flavor.  If someone is new to the cake, they try to guess the flavors.  The cake goes quite fast.   (Sometimes I even substitute the flavors, depending on my mood or what I have in stock!). In regards to the cake sticking...happened to me rarely if I didn't use a non stick or if I failed to grease and flour the pan BUT I've started using "Baker's Joy".  Baker's Joy is amazing!!!

I did not find  the flavor special at all. Very dense. Directions need clarification to avoid over mixing ingredients or cake will be dry. Made 2 x. Glaze is meh....ok but not stellar

Baking is my "Passion", I have literally baked thousands of cakes and I must say that this is one of my absolute favorites. My cake fans simply LOVE it!!! For those of you using a bundt pan, a 10" would be better; this cake pushes a 9" pan to the limit and almost over the top. One member mentioned that she thought the "flavors were fighting too much". Everyone's palate is a little different and with this being said, you can tweak the flavors to satisfy your palate. Personally, I have made several versions of this cake and I prefer to use Brandy flavoring instead of Rum flavoring, simply because Rum can be a bit overpowering to me. Almond and orange flavorings are also FANTASTIC in this cake. You can also increase the butter and/or the vanilla if you feel the other flavors are overpowering. Or simply decrease the flavors that you like the least.  Have fun with baking this cake and experiment with flavor variations (but stick with "5" flavors). This is an AWESOME, AWESOME Pound Cake Recipe..ENJOY!!!

Perfect pound cake texture and flavor. I followed the recipe almost exactly with just a few changes and suggestions. I took another reviewer's advice and cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups - probably didn't make a difference. For the glaze, I used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of water and didn't bother with the lemon flavoring in the glaze. Took the warnings about sticking and used a heavy coating of Crisco and flour. After cooling for 10 minutes, I removed the cake from the side pan, but left it on the tube part. Poured the glaze on (It sank right into the flat cracked top.) and refrigerated the cake overnight. The cake lifted right off (after sliding a knife under) when it was firm. Fabulous!

The only thing I changed were the flavors used in this.  I had no coconut or rum extract, so my solution was to do 2 tsp of Malibu Coconut Rum.  I also used 1 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp lemon extract.

I brought the whole milk, eggs and butter to room temperature, and really whipped the butter, shortening and sugar half to death.  The cake only needed 1:30 to cook in my oven, and we topped it with fresh strawberry puree and fresh strawberry slices.

This is a keeper, and if I could give it more than five stars, I would!

I had never made pound cake before, but my husband and coworkers were a big fan of this one when I made it!  The only thing that went wrong was I had a little piece stick to the pan even after I had greased and floured it.  But it tasted wonderful!

Love the flavors and the smell of the cake. Mine didn't turn out perfect but that, I think, was due to old baking powder. But even with all the Duncan Hines and Betty Crocker cakes, this is one of my fav.

Great texture! Moist and flavorful. With so many extracts the flavor is intriguing. I used rum instead of rum flavoring. I liked pouring the glaze on while the cake was hot. It saved time. With two teenage boys (my son's friend has a baking radar)hovering my cakes rarely make it to cool.

This is an excellent pound cake!!! I really love it.  The texture is lovely and just the way it should be for a pound cake.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I did not need to bake it as long at the recipe said.  I took it out of the oven at 60 minutes.  My oven tends to be too hot.  Next time I make it I think I'll alter the extracts around and experiment.  I do think next time I might leave out the rum extract b/c I think it overpowers the other flavors, however it is still wonderful as is!!! Love, sara

The only poundcake recipe you will ever need.  I have used this recipe for 10+ years and always rave reviews.  I recommend changing up the extract flavors for a treat.  One of my favorites is caramel.

This is a family favorite!!! I've been making it for years.  If you can make this cake a day ahead of the event date...do it!!! The flavors settle together and the flavor is amazing.  I play with the extract combo at times but the original five is great as well. Be sure to grease and flour the pan well.  This cake is heavy and I tend to make a few cupcakes from the extra batter.

This is fantastic exactly the way it is. I have made this recipe over 20 times and it turns out great each time. It is very important to grease and lightly flour the pan though because it will stick. I have changed the flavors a few times just for different flavors but this is delicious.

It was delicious but unattractive because some parts of it "fell"  so it was inconsistent in texture.  We enjoyed eating it but I will not make it again.

I give this recipe a "high 5"! I don't make cakes from scratch, but wanted to surprise my husband with his favorite cake on his birthday. He was pleasantly surprised and nearly ate half the cake the first day!!! I did have to split my batter I was afraid my bundt pan would spill over. I used the remaining in a loaf pan which was fine as well. I am going to freeze that one and will wait to see how well that turns out. Thank you for helping me make my husband's birthday  much sweeter!!! It's a keeper!!!

Woah!! A whole lot of flavor! But I kind of expected that. What I didn't expect was the unusual and pleasant texture. It was soft and fluffy in the middle and chewy and crunchy on the outside. Love it!! I used Butter, vanilla, orange, and almond extracts. I used the glaze that is in the recipe and then made a thicker drizzle with 1 cup of greek yogurt and 3 cups of confectioner's sugar with 1 teaspoon of vanilla and orange extracts. A Dish of Delish!!!

This is my second time making it.  I added sour cream & orange flavoring. The first cake was gone in 2 days. My husband complained because he didn’t get any. This cake is so moist and fluffy. I think I ate 3 pieces myself. Super addictive!

Everyone loovvveeedd this cake. Texture was amazing. 
Personally, I think it was a bit too busy -flavor wise. I plan to cut back to 1/2 teaspoon on all flavoring next time.  
Honestly, I used rum, almond, vanilla, coconut and lemon. There's no second row flavoring in this group.  Noticed this cake didn't have any salt added which was cool. I did use unsalted butter as well.  Salt was not missed. I did use a 1/4 butter 3 Tblsp milk, confectioners sugar based glaze.  I will definitely bake this again. It's a great template for all pound cakes just add one flavor.  Thank you

Left out lemon extract because I didn’t have any.  Put in two small bundt pans to give as thank you gifts.  Greased; floured and even used Bakers Joy because I had not used these pans for baking.  They did not stick.  Really good and easy recipe, I tasted the pieces I cut off bottom- delish.

The first time I made this cake no one believed I baked it. I'm not a baker. Entrees are my thing but the easy directions made me look like a pro. I've made it five times since then and my family scarfs it up every time including the time I forgot to grease the pan and it fell apart. It was ugly but the taste was still spot on. I'm done. Excellent recipe.

My family made this recipe and it was very good. I unfortunately am gluten intolerant, so I had to watch everyone enjoy it. I love to bake, so I decided to try a gluten free version at home. I made the recipe as written, with two exceptions: I substituted all-purpose gluten free flour (Namaste) for the flour, and substituted buttermilk for the milk. I'm sure the milk would have been fine, but I find that buttermilk does better with gluten free flour for some reason. I used the same amount of flour it called for, but just used the gluten free flour. I baked it for an hour and twenty minutes and it was perfect. It was moist and those who tried it couldn't tell it was gluten free. There are many gluten free foods out there, but if they don't taste great, I won't waste my calorie allowance on them! This was very good. If you have to eat gluten free, give this a try with those substitutions. I'm making it again for Easter!

This is my first pound cake.  I made it to the exactness of the receipe.  I looked up how to cream butter and sugar and beating eggs till they were ready, and not beating too much after the flour was added.  We like lemon so I added two packets of dried lemon powder the the batter and later added 3 packets to the icing.  
I also greased and floured an aluminum pan thoroughly rather than perhaps screw up shape by trying wax paper or parchment.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.  JUST THE PERFECT RISE ABOVE TOP OF PAN.  THE ICING SOAKED IN NICELY WHEN ADDED BY THE SPOON FULL.  
I am so proud.  THANKS FOR HAVING THIS  RECEIPE ON LINE?  ONE CAN ALWAYS TRUST ALLRECEIPES TO HAVE THE BEST!

The best pound cake ever! The only change I made was to swap the butter extract for almond. It is better than the 5 flavor pound cake my oldest son loves from a local bakery!  Moist, dense, but not overly sweet. I don't even use the glaze. It doesn't need it at all!

I have made this cake several times and it has been a hit.  Made it for Christmas and it was like a fight for the last slice.  Took it to work and it was once again a favorite.  Love this recipe, would not change a thing about it.

Wow!  I have never had such an enthusiastic reception for a pound cake before!  I made this and was happy at the subtle flavorings, the semi-moist texture, and the overall attractiveness of the finished cake.  You should use the freshest extract, as a mixture of so many types could easily allow the fresh ones to drown out any older flavors in your supply.  I was delighted that everyone could identify the flavorings consistently- unheard of in large combinations like this!  The cake was firm but also had a slight crumb texture, just what you would want.  Less baking time would make it stick together more solidly, so you have to find what your preferences are and time accordingly.  The cake is HUGE and made a beautiful, crispy crust that everyone remarked on.  The glaze adds to the crisp texture as the sugar crystalizes; again, be sure you are using fresh extracts as the five flavors are present in this coating as well.  I noticed others commenting about the cake sticking to the pan- I had absolutely no issue with this, but I also grease tube pans thoroughly with solid shortening prior to baking (they are notorious for wanting to hold onto cakes)- I use a fluted pan with non-stick coating inside, so greasing it before baking seems to be sufficient to avoid any issues, and I have a beautifully decorative end product.  Always let the cake cool for 10 minutes on a rack before you tip it out, no more and no less.  I also beat the eggs for a minute prior to adding them to the batter

I love this cake and have been making it for years. I will have to agree with the others when they tell you to go extra on the flouring of the pan. It sticks me almost every time. I'm starting to think that it might be the pan itself. Did I mention that I had to go to 6 different stores just the find the rum extract. I made sure I grab two bottles of this stuff.

After two unsuccessful attempts to make a traditional lemon pound cake I decided to try this recipe. I was pretty excited at the results. I followed directions almost as listed (used 1/2 cup less sugar) and replaced coconut extract with almond. Cake turned out light, moist and fluffy. I have a very old gas oven, so i cooked for one and half hours and it was fine. I used 10" pan and did not have any overflow and per the other comments, i greased and added flour to the pan and it came out easily.  I used the glaze becaue i like glazes, but could have omitted this as it leaves a bit of an aftertaste. Did not find the various flavors overpowering. Going to share over Christmas and hopefully this will be one my family enjoys.

Today is my husband's birthday. Out of all the cakes out there, this is the one he wanted. This is one of those cakes you can change up the flavors to fit you. It's just that good! You don't have to be the best baker in the world to pull off a great cake when you have a great recipe like this one. 
  Thanks so much for sharing and for helping me bake my wonderful husband a birthday cake almost as wonderful as he is.

I spent $12 on flavorings to make this cake and it stuck to the pan. :(  I greased it really good too.  I'm disappointed but i'm not much of a cook anyway.  I put the cooked cake back in the mixing bowl and poured the glaze over it.  My husband will get a kick out of it. I had to rate this because it won't let you post a comment without rating it. I'm sure it was something I did. Tastes good though!!!

Awesome!!  I didn't change a thing...except I replaced the rum flavoring with banana flavoring per my Auntie's advice.
