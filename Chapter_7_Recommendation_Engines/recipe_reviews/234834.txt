Absolutely Delicious!  Only change I made is that I used fresh plump strawberries and mixed them with strawberry glaze, instead of pie filling. I will definitely make this again.

This trifle recipe is so delicious!  The white chocolate mousse is to die for!  I had leftover cupcakes I wanted to make into trifle so I substituted those for the cookies and I put in individual serving dishes.  My husband loved it!  This would be good with angel food or any cake mix too.

This was so good. I did substitute the pie filling for half fresh and half frozen strawberries in sugar. Also I forgot to buy whipping cream so I just used a tub of cool whip and it came out beautiful. The white chocolate mousse was delish all by itself. I'm sure the white chocolate mousse can be used interchangeably with any other trifle recipe.

Everyone enjoyed this, I used vanilla mousse as no white chocolat mousse was available and I put vanilla cookies instead of sugar ones and it was sooooo good!!
