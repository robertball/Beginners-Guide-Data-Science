This was very easy to make and delicious! I used strawberry flavored champagne and everyone loved it. I'll be making it again and again.

I wanted this to be so much better than it was. I think the "soup" through me off.  I def got more of a frozen drink feel from this, than a soup.  I actually liked it better before adding the sparkling wine....

This is a sexy way to start off brunch!  I mixed the puree two days before adding the champagne and serving it and it was divine.  Served it in martini glasses.  Incredibly easy and will make again and again!  Perfect for those special occasions.

Made this for a baby shower with several pregnant guests, so I did not want to use champagne. I replaced the champagne with sparkling cider instead.  Added 1/2 cup cream and deleted the salt. Served it in champagne glasses prior to lunch.  It got rave reviews all around.

I really enjoyed this, but I would try using only 1/4 of the salt to start then adjust if necessary. I found the suggested amount too much.

This was absolutely amazing.  I did use frozen, partially thawed strawberries (since strawberries in MN in the winter don't usually taste so hot), and added a touch more champagne just to get the consistency I wanted.  I used strawberry champagne as well.  This soup was beautiful, impressive, and very tasty.  You definitely could serve this in a glass as a drink as well, but I personally think that just makes this recipe more versatile.  The best fruit soup I have ever made.

This is yummy but really is a beverage rather than a soup. My husband and I had it for a Sunday brunch but then poured it into glasses after only a few minutes and drank the rest. Also could use some more flavor. Possibly mint or lime juice to give it a kick.

Made a wonderful addition to our dinner tonight.  I think next time we will use strawberry flavored champagne though.  Not bad at all.  Thanks for sharing this with us!

This was delicious and for some reason I always thought that this soup was very complicated. This was super easy and I felt like a superstar serving this to my Mom for lunch. Thanks.
