For this recipe, use a generous tablespoon of bourbon and omit the red wine vinegar. I used this recipe for sliced baked ham (fully cooked hickory smoked pit ham) that I served to more than 150 people at a function. Each piece of ham was layered in a pan and got a generous helping of sauce in which to marinate through the heating process, which was kept covered on low temperature to heat. For serving, I spashed each plate with a line of the sauce to punctuate and freshen the flavor. This recipe was a huge success...and everyone wanted to know what the "secret" ingredient was!

This was delicious!  I've never ventured from our traditional pinapple topped ham until this recipe!.. When mixing the glaze for the top, I almost didn't add the dry mustard because I'd already put in the dijon and I thought it smelled too mustardy, but I did add it and I'm so glad!... While cooking the mustard mellows and the sweet of the maple syrup comes through... I was wishing for more mustard taste as I ate it!.. Next time I think I'll score the ham and let the glaze marinade for a few hours, then cover with foil for the first 30 min. then uncover to nicely brown for the rest of the time!...

Good as is, but would have preferred a stronger maple flavor, even though I used Grade B pure maple syrup. I will probably increase the ratio of syrup to the other ingredients if I make this again.

This recipe totally kicked the honey glazed ham recipes out of my recipe box.   I'm with Travelerdude though; must substitute Jim Beam for the wine vinegar.  We've got the authentic maple syrup straight from trips to Quebec and you've gotta use good quality syrup.  This is SO simple and SO tasty - no way to mess it up.    THANKS for a great dish.

I made a variation of this for a ham over the holidays.  We added some honey..it was pretty tasty.  Next time we won't shy away from the strong flavors in this recipe...it really does add great flavor to the ham.

I agree with both of the other reviews.  This is really tasty, and SUPER easy with ingredients you pretty much always have on hand.   I would DEFINITELY suggest lining the roasting pan with foil, as burned on sugar is extremely difficult to battle.  I just made this tonight and thus haven't won the battle yet - maybe it'd be easier to just buy a new pan?  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a good glaze.  My ham was almost 10 pounds, so I had to bake it longer and I think I should have put it in an oven bag.  It got a little crispy.  But I thought the glaze added a nice, subtle flavor and was very easy.

This is a very easy recipe to make and satisfied even the pickiest of eaters. When I made it I made a bigger ham- and made a bit more than twice the sauce. It worked really well. I don't like messing with a bone so I used a teardrop ham and it tasted really well. I had absolutely no problems with cleaning pans afterwards- I did not use a "traditional" roasting pan, but used french corning roaster so that might have made the difference. This is not only good to eat warm but makes wonderful sandwiches later too.

The taste was fantastic. My boyfriend loved it! I did not buy whole ham; I used thick sliced ham from the deli  (about 3 slices). It came out really nice

All I can say is WOW! There are just some recipes where ingredients dont need any changes and this is definitely one of them!!! I did add ingredients to taste...I didnt want to take away from the taste of the ham. And I was a little nervous about all the mustard. But...there was NOTHING to be nervous about...my ham came out tender..the skin crispy goodness....my family and KIDS LOOOOVED it! Its NOT as spicy as you will think its gonna be. So..just go with it and dont change a thing!

I made this for the second time and made some modifications based on my previous review.  If you want the maple to be more dominant than the mustard, for a 5lb ham, I'd recommend cutting the dry and dijon mustard portions in half and for the maple syrup, reduce a 1/2 cup to about 1/4 cup.  Also, I definitely recommend using bourbon instead of the vinegar (I added it as I was finishing the maple reduction).  The mustard was still present with these modifications, but it tasted more like a maple glaze than a mustard glaze, which was what I was looking for.  This was a really big hit with everyone at Easter this year!

I Followed the submitted recipe as presented. My ham was a bit larger than 5 pounds and so I increased the ingredients some to account for that. The ham turned out very,very well. The glaze permeated through the meat and was not the least bit over bearing or too sweet. The fam loved it and, well, that big, old ham is gone.

As others suggested, I used bourbon instead of vinegar and it was marvelous.  I also used hot Asian mustard powder instead of the traditional English powder and it just gave the glaze a hint of a kick.  My husband became very protective of the bottle of bourbon I brought home.  He pictured me pouring the whole bottle over the ham.  When I explained that I only needed a couple of tablespoons, he relinquished it and had a drink.  Thank you Michelle, this was great!

I took a chance and made this for the first time for a dinner party. It was a hit. Moist, full of flavour. I didn't have bourbon or the correct vinegar and used balsamic vinegar and it turned out great! Thank you

I had a 6.5lb ham left over from Christmas, and as a college student I wanted to reuse ingredients I already had. Due to being underage, I stuck with the red wine vinegar, and I have to say, it turned out excellent! The vinegar struck just the right balance between the savory mustard and the sweet maple syrup. I would not recommend trying to modify this recipe too much or decreasing the ratio of any ingredients, it's great just as it is!

This was a tangy glaze and the mustard was really strong. It was alright but didn't get any comments and no one had seconds. I had fun trying a new recipe! Thanks.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was fantastic -- all of my guests raved about it (even the ones who aren't all that crazy about ham). The meat was incredibly juicy and the glaze gave it enough sweetness and tang, but not too much.  I don't have a decent roasting pan, so I just laid my ham cut-side down on a small rack in a foil-lined broiler pan, and it worked just fine. My ham was eight pounds, so I increased all of the ingredients by 50% and extended the cooking time accordingly.  Once the meat thermometer topped 130, I took the ham out to rest for about 20 minutes.  I'll definitely make this again, hopefully well before next Easter!

So yummy! I took the suggestion to substitute liquor for the red wine vinegar, but since we didn't have bourbon open, I used Southern Comfort.  Basting a 5.5 lb. ham every 30 minutes kept it juicy and mine did not burn. Leftovers were terrific with ham and beans the next night!

I changed the vinegar for Jim beam as well as some of the other comments suggested. I also double the glaze and marinated the ham for one hour. It was superb. I would agree more mustard next time and deeper cuts so the flavor really saturates the meat. I served it with a horseradish and ground mustard sauce to the side which gave it the perfect kick. Ham was very juicy and flavorful. Definite a nice change from the sweet Easter ham.

This recipe not only was tasty, but quite simple.  To avoid that messy roaster, I put a small amount of water in the bottom, place a sheet of foil with the edges folded up (to keep most of the water off), put the ham on it, and followed the basting instructions.  It turned out very well.  Caution - a lot of grocery store hams have quite a bit of water added, so this suggestion may not work for you.  We have our own butcher shop and don't have this issue.

Very simple recipe and quite good!  I did not have any dijon mustard so used a champagne mustard instead.  And like so many other reviews - I used a good bourbon.  Next time I will make sure to have dijon or other spicy mustard to get that extra kick.

This is seriously the best ham ever.  It seems silly to cook it another way!  I used honey mustard and white wine vinegar because that is why I had on hand.  Delish.

There is always a bunch of ham leftover after thanksgiving...NOT THIS TIME. They loved it...seconds, thirds....it's a first in our house. :) The only difference is ours was a boneless ham because we never invest in a bone-in since it tends to get left behind. Maybe next year that will change. ;) Thanks!

I  made this ham for Easter dinner.  It was excellent.  I made no changes to the recipe and my family loved it.  It will be a family favorite for years to come as well as for many other special occasions.

I made this ham for a dinner party.  I also used bourbon instead of red wine vinegar.  I made extra glaze and glazed the ham every 20 minutes until it was done.  I received many complements.  Two of the guests wanted to know what was in the glaze because it was the best ham they ever had!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Very good. I think our ham needed a little more time and the glaze was still pretty saucy but delicious just the same.

I soooo love this recipe; it certainly is different from the other "Honey" Glazes.  I've made this 2x on family occassions; once following the recipe exactly.  On the other occassion, I didn't have any red wine vinegar and used of all things - Rum.  Huge Reviews from everyone who ate.  Not one spec of meat left.  This does make one hell-of-a mess of your pan; so if you don't want to spend days cleaning out your pan, use several layers of foil.  The more the better.

This was a really great glaze for the Easter ham I just made.  I happened to have some Jack Daniels around so I used that following some people's suggestions for adding bourbon or rum, and it seemed to work well.  I ended up covering the ham while I baked it (I was making potatoes at the same time and didn't want to dry it out), so when the ham was done I took all the liquids on the pan, added some corn starch, and boiled down to a glaze that I poured over the sliced ham.  I was making this up as I went along but it really made the ham extra tasty.  We usually have ham with cherry sauce, but we didn't have access to cherries and this was a great substitute.

Second year using this for our Christmas ham.  Family loved it so much, they wanted me to make it again this year.  I substituted spicy brown mustard for Dijon mustard because that is what I had on hand and I put whole cloves along the score marks. Simple and delicious

We are having this ham tonight for new year's eve 2014. This was so easy to follow. One problem I had and that was I had to settle for white wine vinegar as I didn't have any red wine vinegar. Everything else I followed to the letter. I wanted something different like others were saying and I didn't want this to be like an Easter ham. The glaze is delicious. I can't wait to have it tonight... I'm sure it will be great.

Great sauce.  I added brandy in place of vinegar.  I poured it over a spiral ham for Xmas dinner. I reduced the pan drippings and thickened with some flour for a sauce. It was a hit with the family.  A keeper!

I used this glaze on a really expensive, very good bone-in, not spiral cut ham. It was very good, but I am not sure if it was the glaze or the ham. It made the outside of the ham sugary and delicious, but the inside did not really pick up the maple flavor. I really don't believe in basting anyway.

This recipe is awesome! I had a 4 pound spiral sliced ham. I followed the directions exactly as written...oops! No I didn't! I substituted 1+ Tbsp Jack Daniels for the vinegar. Okay, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It rocked! Everyone loved it and I can't stop eating it. Thanks for a true keeper!!!

Delicious! I had a small cooked ham that I used for this recipe.  It came with a brown sugar packet and I used that as well as some pineapples for the top.  In addition, as suggested I substituted bourbon for the vinegar.  I have been married for nearly 15 years and I had no idea that my husband liked ham so much.  Maybe it is because I never used this recipe!  He devoured it at dinner, I used some to make his breakfast, and he was begging for ham sandwiches.  How could I have not known he liked ham? :) Thank you for a great recipe and next time I will omit the brown sugar packet and follow it, but still use the bourbon (one of his favorite ingredients).

I used this recipe on a ham from a Russian Boar I shot this year. I thought it was great and very easy to make. "Two thumbs up".

Fantastic recipe. I used a splash of red wine instead of the vinegar (was out) and it still had an amazing flavour.

I did as another user suggested and used bourbon in place of the red wine vinegar. This was excellent, moist, and flavorful! The only other change I made was that I added garlic powder, salt, and pepper all to taste.

Very tasty, only complaint is that the flavor doesn't get down into the meat, just on the outside.

Followed this recipe almost exactly (just changed the wine vinegar to bourbon as suggested by other viewers-good substitution!) and had a 5 1/2 lb smoked ham with bone in. Before the actual cooking time was up the ham was at the right temperature. Everyone really liked the glaze. I was worried it was too much mustard but don't be nervous! It was just right! My husband doesn't really care for sweet or fruity glazes and sauces with his meat but I do, and even he thought it was really good.

Good made it for Easter this year, and it was the  first ham I have ever attempted and everyone enjoyed it, although I thought it would have more maple flavor. Will make again.

I used this glaze on a ham I prepared in the pressure cooker. It only took an hour and it was super moist. There is a recipe on learninghowtocook.com that walked me through the process.

I'm reviewing this a little late. Made this for Easter dinner for my husbands side of the family. Rave reviews from everyone! I followed travelerdude's suggestion and used bourbon. Wow!! It just really added another layer of flavor.  I think this has become the newest tradition in our family. Definitely making this again!

We smoked our Easter ham, so putting the glaze on during cooking was a bit difficult.  After trying (without much success) I decided to just save the glaze to serve with the ham at the table.  Yummy!  I doubled the recipe for an 8-1/2 lb ham and added 3 Tbsp of fresh squeezed orange juice and about 2 Tbsp of honey. This was an easy and delicious glaze.

This is the only glaze I'll use for ham going forward. Don't shy away from the mustard, both dijon and dry, because it adds just the right flavor and mellows as it bakes. I've used apple cider vinegar when I didn't have wine vinegar on hand, and that ham got rave reviews, too. Use good quality real maple syrup.

Made this ham for Easter and it was a hit.  My family said it was the best ham they have ever had.  It was very simple to make.  I made a 10 pound ham and doubled the receipe.  I followed ingredients and instructions as is.  No changes or substitutions and couldn't be happier with the results. It will be made again!

Simple, easy and GOOD.  In reading reviews by others I also used booze (Crown Royal) versus wine vinegar.    I also agree that the quality of your Maple syrup will make a difference too.  I used a Costco brand with had great taste but was a bit thin so less body.  A great basic glaze which can be tinkered with to make even better.

I made this glaze for our Christmas ham and it got rave reviews. I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon and was really worried it would not compliment the other flavors. But it was fantastic, I wouldnt change a thing. I used this recipe as written with an 11lb ham it was was definitely enough for 2 very generous bastings. It is now my go-to ham glaze.

I served this to my family on Easter and everyone raved about it! I'm 73 and that's never happened to me before with ham! I did substitute with bourbon and increased the ingredients a little for an 8lb ham. Cooked about a half hour longer, covered with foil after the first 30 minutes until about 45 minutes before it was done! Soooo delicious!! Used a glass pan and no problems with a crusted bottom. Thank you!!

It was delicious. I followed the recipe as is.  My ham was a 7-pounder so for the 1st stage I left it in for 40 minutes instead of 30 before starting the glazing process. At the end, instead of 20 minutes, I let it finish off at 30 minutes. I don't know if I needed that last 10 minutes, but it came out perfectly.  Everyone loved the ham, including a couple of fussy kids!
