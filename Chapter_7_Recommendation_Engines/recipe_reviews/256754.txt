I love all the flavors that went into this pasta! Make sure you buy a good pesto since that is the predominant flavor profile in the pasta. Even better you could make your own! I did use more pesto than the recipe called for because it was a little dry and I wanted a stronger pesto taste. I also only used 12 oz. of pasta instead of 16 oz. since that is the size the bowtie pasta box.

The taste was very good I forgot to put in the pesto but it was still tasty though a bit dry. I don't know if 1/3c of pesto would have made that much difference. I will add some broth tonight when I reheat the leftovers. The cooking time for the asparagus will vary on the diameter of the asparagus. I used the fatter ones so I would suggest adding it earlier as it took at least 5-6min to become tender and not chewy.

Easy, delicious, full of amazing flavors! I followed the recipe closely, with the only change being 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper instead of red pepper flakes. I might switch out bow tie pasta for spaghetti or linguine, but thats it.

I really like this as it was not heavy. I halved the recipe. I definately will make this again.

Great and tasty recipe! I actually used linguine for the noodles and chicken breasts. I also skipped the pesto and just used basil alone.

I doubled the recipe and added fresh Parmesan and more chicken broth and basil pesto. The dish was a success.
