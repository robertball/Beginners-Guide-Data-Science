Great Cupcakes! I use 1 cup of the white
chip and before adding them to the batter, I mixed 1 teaspoon of flour with
them. As a result, the chips did not sink to the bottom.  In place of the zest (oops, no oranges!) I used 1 teaspoon of Orange Extract! mmm...these
are good--especially warm!!
The kids loved them!!!!!!!!

These tasted good but all the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom and left a hard curst on the bottom, which made them hard to eat.  Next time I may chop the chocoloate chips in the food processor before adding them to the cake mix.

These cupcakes were delicious! I had no problem with the chips sinking to the bottom like some others noticed.

These are tasty but I think a few modifications could be made. After reading the reviews, I too used orange extract instead of orange zest but it didn't give them a very strong orange flavor--next time I think I'll try using both and see what happens. Also, I tried the trick of flouring my white chocolate chips, but the flour didn't really want to stick to them so it didn't help much and most of them sank to the bottom. I think next time I will chop them up smaller. Also, the frosting you choose can make or break this recipe. I chose a favorite white chocolate cream cheese frosting and added a little orange extract and it was great!
