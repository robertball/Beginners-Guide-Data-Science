I made some changes to this recipe, but I loved the end result.  I omitted the oil and butter.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of onions and 3  minced garlic cloves. I used 1/2 lb. of lentils and 1/2 lb. of lean ground turkey, and I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed.    I didn't adjust the spices at all, but it could have used a little more heat.  I will make my version again.  It was really yummy, and weight watchers- friendly, too.

amazing. I tried this recipe when I was trying some healthier alternatives for myself and now it is a regular on the houshold menu. Vegtarian and confirmed 'meat eaters' raved about it. My kids had seconds and I can serve it to my vegan friends. I put all the ingredients in  a crock pot for at least 6 hours, adding a bit more cumin powder and carrots. A keeper!

I loved this recipe, but I don't like cooked carrots and my bf doesn't like celery so I substituted corn and small cubed potatos.  This might sound weird, but it was really tasty and gave the chili a little more volume.  It gave me a great excuse to cook my red lentils!

I would also say that (being born in Texas and having a deep love of spicy things) if you want a spicy dish you REALLY have to amp up the spice.  I used about triple the chili powder and cayenne pepper and red pepper and black pepper than the recipe calls for.  I tasted it after initially putting in my spices and couldn't taste anything but the tomato.

Still the base of the recipe was a great idea; I'll certainly be cooking it again.

Note: add a good crusty, warm french bread for a real homey/happy dish!

WOW!!!!!! Such incredible taste! I have never left a review before, but I just had to this time. This is a very tasty dish, I poured it over white rice, and it was excellent in every way and I'm not a lentils person!

Great recipe!!  I added double the chili powder and it spiced it up to perfection. My husband loved it so much he brought it to work for some co-workers.  Everybody loved it!!  
Taking "Beano" first is always a good idea with any kind of bean.:)

Yummy!  I gave it four stars because like other reviews said, I did need to add spices and I also used the whole can of crushed tomatoes.  I also added red and green bell peppers and a small can of corn (kept the carrots but skipped the celery) and I think the corn made it extra good.  We ate it with the vegan agave corn muffin recipe on this site and it was an awesome dinner!

You definitely need a large pot!  I started out doing what the recipe called for, but then I tasted it half way through and it was bland so I added more spice.  I also added mushrooms with the veggies.  This batch made enough for a couple days and two tubs to freeze for the future.

This is FANTASTIC. My only complaint is that it makes such a huge amount. Next time, I'll have to cut the recipe in half or even in thirds. Great for freezing, though.

I'm sooo glad I found this recipe!!!  I really love chili and love lentils so I decided to give this a try.  Because many reviews said it was bland I decided to add all the same seasonings I add to my good old beef Chili recipe.  Chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, sweet smoked paprika, chipolte powder, and oregano.  I also added a chopped green pepper and instead of The large can of crushed tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, a small can of mexican stewed tomatoes and and a small can of tomato sauce.  Also, I believe that good chili must be made with bear so I addd a bottle of bear with the tomatos.  It came out FABULOUS!!!! Next time I will add some chopped zucchini with the carrots and celery. I will definately be making this again and again and again........ =)

Four cups of onion sounded over the top, so I stopped at three cups.  After reading the reviews I added more chili powder.  I tasted and then added more cumin.  I tasted again and added chipotle pepper.  I tasted yet again and added smoked paprika. Finally, I added some Penzey's chicken base and it was what I was looking for.  My daughter and her friend ate this up, covered in an Italian cheese mix.  Four stars as written, but as adjusted for our tastes, a five star winner.  Thanks for a heatlthy, inexpensive recipe!

Prep is easy, setting up this dish to cooking is VERY easy, reading all the reviews: scary... Currently cooking this "chili" and when I told my husband I used chili powder in the lentils, he got very nervous.. And I am nervous... And I read all the reviews and have already doubled all the spices, and added garlic powder, onion powder and celery salt! I also added Sriracha Chili Sauce because someone recommended this (and I had it) We LOVE chili, we love lentils, we love hot... Fingers crossed.. Doubled the carrots and celery too... Will update when its done..

This is, without a doubt, some of the BEST chili ever!  I've made this for our family, as well as two potlucks.  There wasn't a drop left at the potlucks!  Kids and adults both were eating it up and getting seconds. 

(I like to spice it up a bit more, but when I am cooking for a crowd I keep it right as the recipe and put a bottle of chipotle tabasco next to the the pot.)

I've had several people who tell me that they "don't like lentils" try this and love it.  I've given the recipe out many times!

This is a regular now in our home!

If you add corn you have a complete protein. I also doubled the spices. Quick, easy and freezes like a dream.

Truly wonderful. Easy to make, I did need to double the spices for our taste.  A dash of cayenne made all the difference.  Thanks for a low sodium, low cholesterol dish! We'll see if it can take the place of my husband's favorite beef chili recipe this winter.

This was pretty easy to make, freezes well and almost tastes better as left overs!  Its also pretty easy to keep the ingredients around so you can throw it together when you're out of ideas.  My husband gave it a 9 out of 10, which is great considering he doesn't like leftovers.  I added a little Chipotle chilli powder which added a little kick to it.

I'm really not a super spicy person, but I could not for the life of me taste the spices in this chili!  It was *very* bland and watery after my initial taste test.  I threw in a TON more seasonings (and I mean a ton) of random whatever I thought would go good in a chili, plus added some chicken broth and I *finally* got some flavor into that thing!  I only added 1 1/2 quart of water and figured it'd be fine, too.

I gave this a four since it came out WAY too bland without extra spices - I also added in Tomato Sauce and some barbecue sauce as well and let it cook about 45 minutes longer so all ingredients could blend together. It makes A lot - great to freeze or for a crowd

Wow, thought I'd made up an original recipe until I did a search! I used spiced chili powder (which has oregano, garlic, cumin and mild chili powder), California chili powder (mild and sweet), threw in a whole jalapeno and some pepper flakes, and two (small) cans of tomato sauce instead of the paste. It was so thick and had such great flavor and texture. The hubby loved it, and we have been snacking on it since dinner last night. I would have thrown in another jalapeno (or two!), but the hubby can't take a lot of spice. He thought it was perfect with the one. This is the first time I've cooked with raw lentils and I could not believe how easy it was and how good it turned out!

4 stars as written 5 stars as modified on the basis of the other reviews.  Tripled the chili powder and cumin.  Doubled the garlic or so..  Added a can of garbanzos,  and 2 lbs of ground chuck. Browned the beef in some of the spices  and then added it all to a 6qt crock pot.  I needed all of the space in that crock pot.  high for 2 hours then  low for 4 hours.  ate with cheese and chips again per another review.  Although next time i may serve  it over rice.
Next time I make it, and there WILL be a next time, I will use some corn kernels  and maybe some dried chilies.  Excellent base recipies that I will throw into rotation. Although  I will use 8oz of lentils so i dont have soo many leftovers...

Flexible recipe. I made lots of modifications based on what I had in the pantry and to reduce the quantity. I used 1 cup dry lentils. Instead of water, I used Veggie broth (probably about 3.5 cups). I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles instead of the crushed tomatoes. I only used about 1/3 can of tomato paste, about 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 a chopped onion. I used a package of dry chili seasoning mix (McCormick) instead of messing with all the others. It only took about 30 mins at a simmer. Served it with some cheddar cheese and fresh cilantro to brighten it up and cut the tomato flavor. Very tasty.

Great base chili, I did add corn & extra spices.  It was very bland without the extras even with all that garlic.  But it's kinda nice to have a good base recipe you can put your own spin on.  I love the idea of substituting lentils for beef.  We aren't vegetarians but we are trying to get away from the idea that we have to eat meat 7 nights a week.

I did not enjoy this very much.  I took into account all the suggestions others left and added more spices. It still lacked taste.  Some seemed to enjoy this so it probably is just a matter of what you enjoy!

This is a great lentil recipie. I don't care a whole lot for lentils, but I eat them anyway because of their nutritional benefits. I made 1/2 a batch and still had left overs.

I followed recipe exactly and was so surprised...with that much onion and garlic it had a delicate taste.  I added some cayenne pepper.  Next time I will add more spices and more veggies, but this is a great base.  thanks

Easy to make and a great way to use lentils. Very inexpensive meal! However, it needed some salt and pepper added. Also - I added some ground turkey - it was delicious, healthy and made great left overs. I'll definately make this again.

I love this recipe, Everyone in my family loves this recipe. I only gave this 4 stars because of the lack of spice. I have made this a few times the first time I made per the recipe. I only made that mistake once. All the other times I have made this I have used 3-4 Table spoons of Tastefully Simple Wahoo Chili seasoning and blend! It turns out great and everyone wants seconds. FYI this chili freezes great and even tastes better the second time around!

Very tasty.  I never had lentils before this recipe. I goofed when making it, however, and used the big (29 oz) cans of tomato sauce and crushed tomato because my sister wouldn't shut up and I couldn't concentrate.  Anyhow, I am glad to have the extra tomato because it is still pretty thick (no liquid residue in a bowl of it).

I did add more seasonings (packet of chili seasoning) to temper the tomato.  

Overall this recipe is very good - my mom and husband both love it.  Also I used one of the other reviewers' tips and ate it with tortilla chips and MMMmmm good!

Followed the recipe except subbed half the water for red wine, and left out the butter.  Also added the carrots and celery when I added the water.  Really good!

I've never really liked chili but I was looking for something to make to use up some celery and lentils. This was it. Changes I made: I halfed the recipe. Started with garlic, onions, olive oil, and 1 pkg Yves veggie ground round (original). Cooked them up and added some soy sauce and all of the seasonings in the recipe. Then I added 1 cup of lentils, an entire can of tomato paste, and 14 oz of diced tomatoes (because it needed the extra liquid for the ground round), and then the water (4 cups). Then I followed the rest of the recipe basically. Turned out really surprisingly well. I ate a lot upon first tasting.

Missing a lot of flavor!  I added a ton more chili powder.  My suggestion would be to use this as a base and add veggies you like - zuhinni, red pepper would be a start!

Loved this recipe. Used 2 carrots and 3 celery stalks.  Increased chili powder by 1 tablespoon.  Also added some frozen corn and a can of pinto beans.  Toppings included crushed Fritos, chopped green onions, chopped cilantro and sliced avocado.  Makes for a great presentation.

This is really good and I highly recommend giving it a try. I actually made mine in the slow cooker and it turned out perfect. I cooked it on high for 5 hours because I was a little short on time. The only changes I made were to use 1tsp of garlic powder instead of garlic, I am pregnant and I can not stand the smell of raw garlic right now...and I also used 1 qt of chicken broth and 1 qt of water. As for the spices I used a little more than the measurements given here. Turned out perfect.

because this recipe is extremely dietary, i give it a 5. 
make sure to load up on the spices though....and add cayenne for heat (maybe a tsp if you like it HOT).
i have to say though, w/o meet this looks filling but you will be hungry in a few hours so you might want to follow other cooks and add some meat. I ended up adding some leftover mexican-style shredded chicken that I made in the slow cooker and it was awesome. 
Overall, I think that chicken is more complimentary than adding ground beef or turkey.

We liked this recipe. I followed the recipe's spice amounts and I thought, although it was mild, still had great flavor.  and it wasn't too spicy for my toddlers to eat. Eliminate the butter and you have a very good, easy vegan meal. Makes tons. My 6.5 Qt Le Creuset was barely big enough to contain it all. Oh, we did add a can of kidney beans (we like beans). Will make it again

Needed some additional "kick", so I added some extra chili powder and some cayenne papper.  Other than that...easy to make and tasty.  I like lentils thanks to this recipe.

I made this for my family last night and EVERYONE loved it! My youngest who is 22 months and usually very picky ate everything on his plate! The only thing I changed was I just didn't add a can of tomatoes, just used tomato paste instead (thats what I had on hand). Thanks for such a wonder dish!

good concept, but way too bland.  I made it as is, then I added a packet of chili seasoning, tripled all the seasonings and the liquid was too bland.  Won't make it again - we actually threw away the leftovers.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  The only changes I make are omitting the butter and cutting down on the garlic (I love garlic, but an entire bulb is a bit too much).  This is excellent when served with cheddar cheese on top.

This recipe was a great to work off of.  we love tomatoes, so I halved the recipe except for the tomatoes and paste. I think that next time I will add even more tomatoes and carrots. i also used diced as opposed to crushed tomatoes. I might even think about adding other vegetables.

Reasonably thick, healthy chili dish.  I added a chopped jalapeno with some seeds to spice it up. Hearty as a main course, but you might want to cut the recipe in half since it makes a ton.  Lasts all week in the fridge.  I also substituted corn for the celery.

Delicious and very hearty! I used 1/2 onion and 1/2 cabbage. Even with adding an extra tbsp. of chili powder, it still needs more kick. I have lots of leftovers too which is great!

I substituted zucchini and mushrooms instead of the carrots and celery, added a little bit of worcestershire and ketchup and BAM it was amazing. 

Top it off with cheddar cheese and it will be a hit!

Great,  IF you modify it by adding more spices.  I suggest using 1/4 cup chili powder and 2 tbsp ground cumin, I also suggest dicing up a japapeno including seeds if you like it medium warm.  Bon apetit y'all.  Finally, a can of corn, just before serving is a nice addition, the chili purists may groan, but heck... We are talkin' LENTIL chili here boys.

I think this would be a great soup if you follow some of the other reviewers suggestions for spices. For us, it had too many lentils, which caused lots of indigestion. ;-) If I made it again, I would change it up a bit.

This Chili is awesome! I used 5 cups of carrots and celery, 6 cups of onions, I green pepper, 1/2 cup of radish, 3 jalapenos, 1 cup of wild rice. I thought that I had added enough spice, but not enough for our liken. I recommend 6 jalapenos and a tablespoon of Sriracha Hot Sauce. Extra red pepper! Very filling, didn't notice meat was missing!

Very good! I double the spices because I like things spicy. I may have cooked it too long, the lentils ended up mushy and broke down to almost moosh. Again, my fault. Aside from the texture it was very good. Even my husband liked it!

I omitted the oil and butter and added all the ingredients except celery and carrot at the beginning.  The chili is very tasty and freezes well, but I did have to cook it about 20 more minutes that called for.

I am moving my family to a more Mediterranean diet and this really fit the ticket!  My changes were:  I added 1 cup of red beans to give it a more traditional 'chili' appearance. I also threw in maybe 2 cups of ground turkey that i had in the freezer.  This was easy to spice up and make delish. My husband LOVES it.

I amped up the heat with about a teaspoon each of crushed red pepper and cayenne, plus a generous dose of fresh ground black pepper.  Turned out spicy but not unbearably hot.  I also added about a teaspoon of ground nutmeg.  Great hearty stew!  The carrots could be added earlier to soften more.

I think I would call this more of a stew than a chili.  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I halved the recipe other than the tomatoes.  It was just a touch sour for my taste; I would probably follow it more strictly next time, but add more chili powder so that it tastes like chili.  My husband loved it the way I did it, though.

Like a lot of people I found the recipe itself lacking in flavor. Only after adding a package of chili starter, a diced chili pepper, chopped orange pepper and increasing all spices did I get a great turnout. Also, I did use diced tomatoes rather than crushed which I think improves the texture and appearance. Serving with a dollop of sour cream made it even yummier.  I give the recipe only a 3 because it's not that good in and of itself.

I've been told I have  to take it to a Chili cook off.
I did add ground pork, and fresh salsa to it. It was verry lean pork.

Omitted celery and reduced spices to the taste of our household (I see that some reviewers actually increased the spices!). Most of household loved it!

I added and changed a few things, but it was great! I did not use any oil or buter. I did use 1 pack of lentils, 1 can of tomato sauce, 2 cans of chicken broth, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 chili seasoning packet, salt and pepper, then added onion, broccoli, mushrooms, and cut up spinach. I served with cheese on top. It never hurts to add some more veggies...the taste was still great!

As with all the other cooks, I've had to doctor this recipe up a bit.  I've doubled the chili powder and crushed tomatoes, plus added a bottle of chili sauce.  Husband likes the taste, but it's too mild for my liking.  It also makes a TON of chili!  I should have paid attention to that before I started.  We'll have food in the freezer for a while.

This was delicious.  I used dry green peas and lentils.  Followed exact times and it was perfect.  Will definitely fix a lot.
