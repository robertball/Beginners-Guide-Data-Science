Although the peanut butter taste was exceptional, the cake was not ... way too dry.  If I were to try it again I would try adding salad oil or yogurt to give it some moisture.

1 cup of milk to 1 lb confectionery sugar is too much.   Use about 1/4 cup of milk to get a creamy spreadable frosting.    Mix peanut butter with confectionery sugar than add as  much milk to make creamy instead of alternating

I followed the recipe exactly.  The cake was extremely dense, thick and somewhat dry tasting.  It was tolerable but I would not make it again.  My whole family loves peanut butter so I assumed this would be a real winner but it was not.

This is a pound cake recipe. There is too much flour in the batter, which causes the center to thicken up much more than a cake should be. Flavor is good, but take out at least a 1/4 cup of flour.

Delicious cake-- although I recommend using margarine instead of butter or fewer eggs as the cake was very heavy in the middle.

Hi all, I made this cake this morning, in fact I actually made two of them...one a double layer and the other, a bundt cake.  The cake tastes really good and the frosting is to die for.  For the middle layer on each I took some regular store vanilla frosting and mixed it with grape jelly so I ended up with a peanut butter and jelly cake.  I highly recommend!

Was my first time having a peanut butter cake...I loved it!  I did make some changes though.  To the actual recipe, the icing doesn't need near as much milk.  I ended up using way too much powdered sugar to get it back to not being liquid.  Also, I did two layers instead of one big cake.  Was very pretty!  Something I added...Reese cups!  I also used Reese's peanut butter.  It was soooo good!  I crumbled the Reese cups on the first and second layer.  I liked the icing a little runny because I let the icing run down the sides and harden.  Turned out great!

Use Margarine, not butter for a more moist cake. If you slice the top layers off the cakes & glaze the top with caramel simple syrup (Just bring equal parts brown sugar & water to a light boil) it will be moist. This is true of many cakes you layer. Any flavor can be used (chocolate, vanilla,...) if you use white sugar instead of brown. Also freeze cakes before cutting tops off, then after glazing topless cakes, refrigerate wrapped cakes in plastic wrap.  Also, 1 part ea of oil, butter & flour worked best, blended, as the nonstick coating, then dust pan with sifted flour. came out perfect. Mine was a layered ice cream cake (Recee), so I did not alter the frosting milk part, but DO, it is runny! Start with 1/4 cup milk for frosting added slowly & see. I also used cake flour for a lighter cake, needed 2 T more cake flour.  Much lower gluten & HEALTHIER. This cake doubles as a good energy dessert, great for whole family! :)

I thought something might have been wrong with the baking powder in the recipe until I read some other reviews.  The cake had good flavor but was too heavy and a little dry.

The cake was quite good - perfect 'ribbons falling from beaters' batter, nice and dense and chewy and cakey...and it tasted of peanut butter, though not extremely.  It does not taste like it has 6 eggs in it imo, not too rich.  The frosting was not worth it; runny and took forever to set and was, like an earlier reviewer said, more like a glaze.  (I started with 2 cups of icing sugar - 16 oz - which may have been wrong, not sure if Sherry meant fluid or solid ounces.  As is I put about 3 cups in total and it was still not enough.)

Peanuts on top were a great touch - just use the Peanut Butter Frosting recipe, on this site, for a much better topping and you'll have a stellar cake!

Love it but sometimes the cake comes out dry.  After trying several PB cake recipes, I think this is just a hazard of PB cakes.  Then again, I am not a great baker.  Still love the flavor!  My family could simply eat spoonfuls of the frosting without cake.  YUMMY!

I did not make the cake, but I used the frosting recipe. Something is terribly wrong with this recipe. I think the measurements are off. It turned out to be like water. I even added more confectioners sugar and it still was like soup. Needless to say I poured in on my cake and it ran off it and covered the whole plate. I would never make it again and don't recommend anyone else does either.

This cake was terrific!  I found it very rich with excellent peanut taste.  The frosting turned out more like a glaze, but that was OK, since the cake was so substantial.

I had this recipe bookmarked from a time when I cut the recipe in half and used it in a chocolate and peanut butter marble cake. I decided to use it again today for a friend's birthday for cupcakes and without the additional cake mix and used 4 jumbo eggs rather than 6 eggs. The flavor is there but the cake is lacking in texture.

The cake was okay, but I was expecting the cake to taste more like peanut butter. The frosting was much better and made up for the lack of peanut butter taste in the cake.
