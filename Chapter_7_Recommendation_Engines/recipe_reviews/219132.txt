Great soup alternative for a cool fall night.  I noticed the ingredient list shows 4 cups chicken stock but directions call for only 3 cups.  I used 3 and the soup came out creamy...just right.  I didn't have cumin but substituted rosemary..worked fine.

I'm not a huge carrot fan, but found this recipe because I needed to use up some carrots.  The recipe is delicious, so I have made it many times since.  I use skim milk instead of evaporated milk or half and half it make it healthier.  Still very delicious even with the skim milk.

I followed the recipe without straying.  I burned the first batch of onion, ginger, and garlic, because it took much less than 8 minutes on the stove.  The soup is full of flavor, and quite filling!

Oh my. I had this saved in my recipe box for the longest and looked forward to making it, but even still, this soup far exceeded my expectations. WOW! This is amazing. I will be making this again and again. My little brain cannot comprehend how these few ingredients combine into something so special. I followed the recipe but only had dried powdered ginger....I cannot wait to try this with fresh ginger! 5 stars.

The ingredients list calls for "grated" fresh ginger, but the directions say to add "minced" ginger...big flavor difference between the two.  I'm really not sure what's needed, but 1/4 cup grated is a lot, and you puree the soup anyway, so I would think minced???  Admittedly, I've only had carrot soup several times in my life, but it's always been creamy/thick, so that's what I expected.  Even after cooking the soup down for another 30 minutes after adding the half-and-half, it was still too thin, at least for me.  I love Kitchen Basics, it's the only stock that I buy, but I didn't find this soup to have a lot of flavor.  Could be the confusion over the fresh ginger, perhaps not enough was added??  Just a bit of a disappointment.  Think I'll stick with a couple butternut squash recipes from AR that I like.

This was a great soup to eat in small amounts.  The ginger really gives it a kick, but the taste of the chicken stock seemed to overpower the carrot.  It made a nice side for my Chinese noodle dish, but it's not the kind of soup I can really grub on.

Fantastic! The only changes I made were to swap out the chicken stock for vegetable broth and omit the milk for a nice and healthy vegan soup. I will definitely make this again.

This was really lovely. I wasn't sure about the amount of ginger since the volume really varies depending whether you grate or mince and how finely. I used a 2" piece of root and found it gave the soup a good sharp zing although the grated ginger was nowhere near 1/4 cup. I love the flavour combination and couldn't believe that such a small amount of cumin set off the ginger so beautifully. Used a home-made stock and found no need to add salt. Will definitely serve this to company!

Nice and comforting, not a heavy soup to welcome the fall. I love cumin so I added whole seeds as well as the powdered. Hubs doesn't care for ginger so I only used half of what was called for. Also used vegetable stock instead of chicken and added a touch more salt. Perfect.

This is WONDERFUL! We have made it so many times we don't use the recipe anymore; it is very forgiving. At different times, I have used skim milk, homemade chicken or vegetable broth, no olive oil (use broth for sauteing) At one point, I had some extra pumpkin puree, so I added it. Now we call this soup Pumpkin Carrot soup. Our favorite! For us, it is so much better if it has a nice ginger kick - I can't say how much. We always just throw these ingredients into the pot and it always turns out delicious.

This was an easy, delicious recipe.  Even my kids loved this soup!  I skipped the cumin and just used salt and pepper.  I will make this often during the fall and winter seasons.

This is a delicious soup!  But be sure you like ginger, because it definitely packs a good ginger punch!  I went with grating the ginger and used the amount called for.  Also I used 3 cups stock and half and half.  I think it would be just as good with low fat milk.  I pureed it with my immersion blender, seasoned it with some salt, and presto! Delicious, spicy, flavorful soup!  Today for lunch, I topped it with a dollop of fat free greek yogurt.  YUM!

I was looking for a "gingered" soup recipe to make for a dear friend going through chemo therapy treatments to help with her nausea. I cut back slightly on the ginger so that it wouldn't be too overpowering and used skim milk to keep it a little lighter on the stomach. The perfect solution and delicious.

I used equal parts ginger and garlic (4 cloves), and substituted whole milk instead of evaporated. Just a dash of salt and cumin (no pepper necessary - there's already a lot of spice going on) and the soup came out awesome.

This soup has become a fall and winter favourite at my house. My husband isn't a huge fan of carrots but he still loves it. I typically use an entire medium-sized onion and double the amount of garlic. I've used evaporated milk, cream, and 1% milk for this recipe and I don't find there's much of a difference. I've never felt the need to add extra salt. Oh, and I use the full four cups of broth called for in the recipe list and I find it's plenty thick.

This was pretty good.  Took a long time to make, though.  I used regular 2% milk instead of evap milk.  I didn't think the spices really stood out.

I made this soup for two servings instead of four by halving all ingredients and it turned out as good as the original 4 servings which I made before. I noticed the ingredients list calls for 4 cups of chicken stock but the instruction says add 3 cups. So I went with the 3 cup version because you can always more. 3 cups was perfectly enough and yield the desired thickness.

I cut back on the fresh ginger and it was still a bit much.
I used vegetable broth (I'm vegetarian) and rice milk (1 1/2c.) instead of evaporated milk.
I will definitely continue working on this recipe - maybe 1/8 c. ginger, but it is sure good!

Don't get me wrong, this soup is delicious! I would give it four and a half stars if it was possible. However...it was missing...something. The spices weren't quite marrying like they could've. I think playing around with the spices could take this recipe from a good soup to a fantastic one.

Nice flavorful soup. I minced my ginger instead of grating,so 1/4 cup wasn't too much, I also only used 3 cups chicken stock and it turned out very nice and creamy. I'll be making this again.

Overall I loved this soup! However, I think that it tasted more like ginger than carrots... not necessarily a bad thing, but it's just a fact. I used evaporated milk & it worked perfectly.

I love the flavor but it needed some kick. I added cayenne pepper, just enough to gain a little heat. Shredded Parmesan is perfect as a garnish.

I used this recipe as a starting point,  and then like so many others,  adapted it to make it right for our family.     I made a lower calorie version of this recipe.   I sliced and peeled 7 lbs of carrots and 2 large onions.    I boiled these in 4 quarts of vegetable broth,  along with a medium sized piece of fresh ginger that I shredded into the pot.    I just wanted a hit of ginger in my soup,  so I'd say I only used about 1/4-1/3 cup of ginger for the entire batch.    When the vegetables were soft,   I used my immersable blender to make everything pureed.  Then I added about a quart of fat free half and half.  This can be as thick or thin as you like by using more or less veggie broth.   Salt and pepper to taste.   It was delicious and perfect as is,  or add a dollop of sour cream and a few croutons if you don't mind the extra calories.

Made with vegetable stock for a work luncheon and it was a hit.  Not a bit leftover.  Add a dash of cayenne for some spice :)

I'll make it again. Next time I'll add sweet potatoes or apples to give it a little sweeter flavor and I'll puree it longer (I still had some little bits, would have liked it more smoothed out.)

The carrots I used may have been a little old or something b/c the soup tasted kind of bitter. I added some orange juice and cinnamon and that helped.

The comments about using the amount of broth mentioned in the directions as opposed to the amount in the ingredient list were helpful. I also used about half as much ginger and it still had plenty of ginger taste.

OMG this is *SO* good!  I've made this several times and have used different combinations of veggies each time depending on how many carrots I had in the fridge.  It's good with added zucchini, potatoes, celery-- haven't found anything yet that doesn't combine well with the carrots!  Thank you so much!

It was not something to write home about, I agree with some of the other reviews, the ginger is way to powerful, I would suggest cutting the amount to 1/8 cup.  I added more cumin powder as it was a little bland.  This recipe could be boosted up if dill was added to the recipe.  Wouldn't make it again.

This soup was sooo amazing! I didnt think I would like it as much as I did. I didnt follow the recipe exactly but it was still very easy and simple. usually I mess recipes up the first time I try them but I had no trouble making this. the changes I made : I added 1tbsp of grated ginger, 3/4 cup of 2% milk, 1 tbsp cumin, and I made homemade chicken stock for a more hearty flavor.

I like this recipe. Changes I made: I used a shallot instead of onion, 4 cloves of garlic, not quite as much ginger - maybe 2 TBS grated, low sodium vegetable broth, herbed salt and no cream or milk.

Had some carrots to use up and with all the flu bugs going around thought this would be a good soup to make with the ginger in it. After  it was done, I felt it was missing something so I sprinkled a little nutmeg on top and that was just what it needed. Delicious!

I felt like this recipe needed a lot more flavor. I added in salt, onion powder, and garlic powder and it added more depth. Sprinkling croutons on top helped as well.

We loved this soup, although I thought the amount of ginger was a little overwhelming. I used a little less than 1/4 cup and I would use even less the next time.

This could be good but it needs some tweaking I think. First, I only found out midway through making this that the ingredients list calls for GRATED ginger while the instructions specifies MINCED ginger. Well, of course grated ginger takes up a lot less space than minced, so it’s no surprise that I find this to be really heavy on ginger. It’s got a punch to it like you added too much pepper to something. To compensate, I added extra half and half, and some honey (to pair well with the Asian-y vibes). It’s good but I’ll try with much less ginger next time.

Made it with almond milk and it turned out great- need a strong blender like a nutribullet or vitamix to get a creamy consistency without huge pieces- will keep for the future!

Used 1can cream (instead)
1\4 teas. Salt
1\8 teas. Pepper
+ 1\8 teas. Cumin (more)

Very good but a bit spicy for Roy.  Cut back on ginger.
He thinks he still likes Jocelyne's better.

Excellent Flavor  :-). 
I use ginger in a lot of my recipes and juices, so recently I've been running my ginger thru a juicer, then freezing it in an ice cube tray and then place them in a ziploc bag.  
So with this in mind, I used 1.5 cubes of ginger, and I replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth and 4 cups of carrots instead of the 3 mentioned.  This has most definitely become another favorite. Thank you, allrecipes.com!

I really like this recipe, but I am a layers person.  I like flavors to unfold. Therefore, I added Curry, a pinch of cayenne, and I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. I also doubled the garlic.

This is a family favorite! Every time I make it for guests they ask for the recipe. It freezes really well too so I often make a double batch and then freeze it in one cup freezer dishes for a quick weekday lunch.  I have found I need to be careful measuring the fresh ginger as it over powers if I exceed the recipe measurement.

Loved this. Lots of flexibility in ingredients. I used 2% milk, and ground ginger about 1 teaspoon since I didn't have any whole ginger in the freezer to grate or chop. Added a sprinkle of tumeric with the cumen. Came out great. Will be making again soon when I have real ginger.

I love this receipe, and discovered it when looking for a copycat of Trader Joe's boxed carrot ginger soup. 

I've never managed to get my hands on evaporated milk, and don't know how it would taste with it, but it works well with normal milk too. 

I often add chickpeas, cream, or coconut milk instead of evaporated milk - great for vegan variations! With chickpeas mixed in and some roasted sesame seeds and sunflower seeds sprinkled on top, this makes a filling and nutritious meal!

I made this for 18  people.  Since some are vegan I made it with vegetable broth instead of chicken. Substituted coconut milk for the dairy.   I think I would not grate the ginger but mince instead.  When I grated  it left stringy pieces even after I put I think through a food proce processor. 
FOr the ginger lovers this is a great soup.

This soup is awesome! I made it as written, except I used veggie broth and omitted the milk for a vegan version. It has the perfect balance of ginger, liquid, and flavor. I will definitely make this again! Yum! Thanks for sharing.

I also noted the 3 cups vs. 4 cups chicken broth and choice to use 4 cups. Like another rater, I used skim instead of evaporated milk and added a little cornstarch.  I didn't bother to measure 1/4 cup of grated ginger but used about 2 inches of ginger root, grated, and thought it came out very well.  I am looking for ways to incorporate ginger into my diet because of its anti-inflammatory properties.  I believe one could substitute butternut squash or yams for the carrots for a change , and it would be equally good.

I substituted light coconut milk for the half and half. I was hesitant to add cumin but I think it was just the spice the recipe needed, and complimented the coconut milk well. Used low sodium chicken stock and had to add quite a bit of salt for added flavor (but I'd rather add my own myself anyway). Yummy and easy!

The amount of ginger in this recipe is a bit overpowering. I used about a tablespoon to 1 1/2 tablespoons powdered ginger.  Also added a small stalk of celery.  Good way to use up carrots.

Maybe it will be better tomorrow but it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. We can taste the ginger but that's about it. If I make it again I might try adding rosemary.

I made this for my BF who loves carrot and ginger soup. I didn't think I'd like it as I don't like cooked carrots (too sweet) and not a huge fan of ginger, but I had both. I put in a tablespoon of grated (on a Japanese grater - less stringy and more juice), and as I'm dairy free, I added half a russet potato to give it the "creamy" texture I wanted. It was just perfect! The tangy ginger cuts the sweetness of the carrots and it balanced very well.  I made two batches in a week, it was so good!

This is a heart warming soup perfect for a cooler night. I did look at the calories for evaporated milk and honestly, don't think 100 calories divided into portions is a big deal.Great for taking to sports events at half time!

This is quite a good tasting soup.  In order to speed things up, I shredded the carrots before cooking them.  It was fairly thin, but tastey.  I think I'll add some chunks of ham before eating the left-overs;  I think that will be a good addition  and thicken it up a bit.

I liked this soup and will make it again, but I will use less stock.  I was unable to add the half and half because it would make the soup way too thin. It's a shame since it would have added a nice richness.

Made it exactly as per the original recipe, found it very bland.  Ended up adding: more garlic, ginger (fresh and powder) chicken granules (1 Tbsp. instead of plain salt), turmeric (to enhance the colour) and black pepper.

Very easy and fast, healthy, and tastes wonderful. Restaurant quality. It has quite a bit of kick from the ginger :)

I also added about a teaspoon of curry powder, and it compliments the soup very well.

If you have loads of carrots that need to be used up, this was a quick and easy soup to make!  I didn't have any chicken stock so I used beef cubes instead - tasted just fine and I might even just leave it that way the next time I make it.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I am nightshade toxic, so the omission of potato was especially appealing. I didn't have any ginger when I made it, so I used 1/4 c. of Annie's Naturals lite Gingerly vinaigrette dressing. It turned out amazing! I will definitely be making this many times over.
