I really enjoyed this. There is a lot of different flavors going on but it is good. I made 2 changes. I did not have fresh basil and used dry and I used fresh grape tomatoes sliced in half instead of can. The one suggestion I have is instead of draining the artichokes and then adding olive oil, just use the oil from the artichokes. I know some artichokes come packed in water but in my area they only come packed in oil so it only makes sense to use the marinated artichoke oil. This one is a keeper for sure and it looks so fresh and pretty!

1.15.17  Really enjoyed this salad, layer upon layer of interesting flavors.  One thing that I felt was missing was acid, and Iâ€™d recommend you give it a really good squeeze of either a fresh lemon or lime.  I used lime, and felt it really enhanced the salad.  For our own taste preference, I also doubled the red pepper flakes.  Do allow it time to chill, so the flavors meld.  Love salads like this that you can make in advance and, yet, have lovely presentation.

We loved this.  Sort of a strange combination of ingredients but together it tastes really great.  If we make it again, I would use Greek black olives instead of green and add cucumbers.
