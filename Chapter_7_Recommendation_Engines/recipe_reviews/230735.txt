I thought this recipe was excellent! I made a few minor modifications: I marinated the chicken for 20 minutes in a 1 tablespoon dry sherry, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and a clove of garlic (minced).  I also added garlic powder to the sauce and omitted the MSG.  I wanted to add a vegetable so I steamed broccoli and mixed it in when I added the sauce to the cooked chicken. Delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe!!! I did not have couscous on hand so I used a farro recipe instead.  (Jenni's Italian Farro Pilaf) Which was also wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was put about a tablespoon of fresh cilantro, two garlic pressed cloves and more red pepper flakes.  Awesome flavor!!!! My family loved it!!!The chicken came out so moist and tender, it was not dry.  I will definitely add to my recipe box.

I made this for dinner last night and we loved it! Definitely a new addition to the regular rotation. I didn't have MSG so I used salt and pepper. I also used skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I s&p'd the chicken thighs, browned them over med. high heat in the olive oil til they were cooked through then moved them to a plate. Mix the soy, brown sugar, lime juice and zest and a dash of ground red chile pepper instead of crushed red pepper and add to the skillet, scraping any tasty bits from the bottom. Added the chicken back in after the sauce had slightly reduced and allowed the chicken to warm back up a bit basting with the sauce. Also made the couscous using homemade chicken stock some dried cilantro (had it on hand already) and 2 cloves "microplaned" (or finely chopped) garlic. Do yourself a favor and don't forget the fresh lime wedges when serving, they give such a fresh, bright flavor to the chicken. This is such a flavorful dish! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic. We made some small substitutions, but only to make it gluten free. We changed the couscous to quinoa, and cooked it to the directions on the box, but still using the broth. We also made sure to use GF soya sauce. We also increased the chilli flakes to 1 tbsp, since we like our food with a bit of a kick. All in all, great dinner!!

This sauce is a perfect combination of salty, sweet, tangy and spicy.  The lime juice and zest really gave the dish bright flavor.  The only changes I made were as follows:  1) I added a little more red pepper flakes (personal preference); 2) I added a pinch of kosher salt and ground black pepper to the chicken while it cooked (I don't use MSG); 3) I used basmati rice instead of couscous as that is what I had in my pantry, and I cooked it in chicken stock instead of vegetable broth.  The next time I make this, and I most definitely will, I will cut the chicken breasts into strips instead of chunks, because while the chunks make for a prettier presentation, strips will cook quicker.  I will also make a point to get vegetable broth and couscous.  Thanks for this keeper!

I could not find the monosodium glutamate and the recipe turned out fine without it. I think the base flavors in this recipe are strong and can be applied in different recipes. I cooked the sauce first. Added the chicken, onion, and red bell pepper to the sauce to give the chicken more flavor. If I were to make this again I would probably add pine nuts to the couscous.

This was really good, but would've been five stars with these modifications: (for the sauce) No msg, only half the sugar, an additional half lime's worth of juice, 1-2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp of fresh grated ginger or ginger paste, and a dash of sesame oil. The sauce is less sweet/syrupy this way and much more flavorful â€“ but beware that you'll have to cook the sauce down longer to achieve the glaze on the chicken, add in the cooked chicken towards the very end to prevent over drying.

I also prefer more sauce so I doubled the amount.

Delicious--just the right balance of heat and sweet. The only change I made was to substitute thigh meat for breast meat. We prefer dark meat.

This recipe is AWESOME! I cooked it on a whim tonight because I had all the ingredients, but I will definitely be remaking it frequently. I did not make any substitutions, though I did omit the MSG and make a few minor additions. However, I think the additions I made accounted for the role of the MSG (softening the chicken). 

What I did was marinade the chicken in a Ziploc bag with 1/4c cheap (otherwise undrinkable) red wine, 3/4 c water, and about 1 TBS soy sauce (reduced salt was all I had) for about 1.5 hours. I also added a red bell pepper and an onion to the sauce, simmering it in the chicken juice before adding the soy/sugar mixture. I think the marinade added more liquid to the sauce, so to thicken it I added about 1 TBS of ground flax seed. 

A tip, if you are having difficulty finding MSG and want to add it, consider using the packet from some ramen noodles; it's about half MSG and half salt/soup mix. You might want to reduce the salt from there, but maybe not.

Delicious! My kids ate every bite. I liked that it was not to saucy and it paired great with the couscous. I added one Zucchini chopped up to the pan a couple minutes before it was done. Perfect recipe to add a vegetable or two. Just up your sauce a bit. On my list of top five recipes. Yum!

WOW. This is delicious! I didn't have couscous so I used quinoa.  I felt like there should be more sauce to put on the quinoa, but it was tasty as it was. I think I'll make more sauce next time, and toss in some stir-fry veggies. Definitely WILL be making it again.

Real good and soooo easy! Made smoked Basmati rice sprinkled with lime juice and cilantro instead of couscous. Definite keeper in the dinner rotation.

I had to use organic orange peel but   used lime and lemon juice. I added butter to the couscous. Family loved it. Also added a bit of pepper and onion that I cooked separately to the finished chicken.

This turned out so good! I love how the recipe allows for versatility as well-some snap peas and carrots would be great with it too I think! I did everything the same, but added a little Sriracha Chili Garlic to the sauce mixture for an added kick. Will definitely be making again.

First thing I did was prep everything...made the exact recipe sauce ingredients in a 2 C glass measuring cup, adding a large clove of minced garlic and a handful of Thai chilies; cubed, seasoned and velveted the chicken; started gently reheating some leftover cilantro lime rice from a Mexican meal I cooked a couple days ago; and preheated my trusty cast iron skillet.   (Next time Iâ€™ll use the wok!)   After that, the meal came together in minutes.  Itâ€™s important to cube the chicken and quickly brown it over high heat because it will finish cooking in the magnificent mahogany sauce.  As you can see in my photos, I decided at the last minute to top the dish with some frozen peas that I ran under water for a second and put (cold) on the dish to cut through the salty/sticky and add freshness.  It was really good.  Next time I wonâ€™t reduce the sauce quite as much, as it does get pretty sticky after standing for a few minutes.

This was flavorful (but it might also have to do with the marinade I used on the chicken), but my sauce didnâ€™t turn into a glaze, so it just soaked into the couscous. To me, the flavors didnâ€™t mesh well together.

Great dish, easy to make, two suggestions: 1. Skip the MSG and salt and pepper the chicken before you fry it up 2. Reduce the sauce by itself on med-high heat while stirring frequently for 7-10 mins. This will give you a thicker sauce that clings to the chicken and ensure you get all the flavors in every bite. There should be very little sauce in the pan that isnâ€™t on the chicken pieces by the end (think like 2 tbs at most)

I didn't make any changes. The lime was overpowering. I don't plan on making it again. Just not a very appealing recipe. (The first one from allrecipes that I did not like)

Great flavor.  Made cilantro lime rice instead of couscous because that is what I had in hand.

Made it for my work lunch, it tastes superb! As it is just for me, I added less sugar to the soy sauce (cut it to three instead of six), as well as added chili powder instead of the flakes. Worked perfectly! Thanks for the recipe!

Such  tasty recipe! I used the sauce as a marinade and let it sit for two hours before cooking. Also used some water and cornstarch to thicken it.  The flavors soaked right into the chicken.

Where is the chili flavor?  After cooking the cubed chicken in olive oil, there was quite a bit of water from the chicken left in the pan. The pan needed to be wiped out before making the sauce.

I liked this.  It was an easy weeknight meal.  It's simple to make, but provides a lot of flavor. A few changes.... I used quinoa instead of couscous, less brown sugar, and salt/pepper instead of MSG.  I would make this again for a quick dinner.  This is not an impressive, elaborate meal, but for busy days that is perfect.

Absolutely delicious! Even without the red pepper flakes (we're no big fan). I used plain old salt and pepper on the chicken to cook and for an extra humph, I added dried raisins to the couscous. You gotta try it! it's compliment the whole thing altogether. BIG FIVE!

This recipe was delicious and easy. I made it with a few changes: added a ton of sriracha to get more of a spicy edge, and cut down on the brown sugar. I think those two changes made the recipe more balanced. In addition, sauteeing yellow onion over low heat in sesame oil for about 10 minutes before you add the rest of the sauce will add some natural sweetness, if you're looking for a good substitute for the sugar. I tossed in some green and red peppers for color and the entire thing came out fantastic. Will definitely use this again.

Sauce has a very strong flavor, but goes well with with the couscous. I cut my chicken chunks up a bit small, so the sauce to chicken ratio was probably a bit high. Also, didn't let the sauce reduce enough before putting chicken in and had to cook it a little too long to get a glazing (or what I imagine a glazing to be), so chicken wasn't as tender as it should be.  Overall, pretty tasty. Would cook again. Would probably dilute Soy sauce or use low sodium. Would make sure to have extra lime for drizzling as well.

Very yummy dish! I ended up cooking the couscous in just water with a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of oil. The chicken glaze provides the main punch of flavor without having to use broth for the couscous. I didn't simmer the glaze for as long, so it was more liquidy. It ran into the couscous and flavored it as well as the chicken. No need to add the MSG. Tastes great without it!

Great recipe! Used salt and pepper instead of msg. Used real brown rice and added the cilantro with a squirt of lime juice. The rice is great with the chicken and sauce poured over it.

I wound up using a cornstarch slurry & finishing the chicken in the sauce on the stovetop. Came out very well, with enough sauce left to drizzle on the rice (made rice instead of couscous, same seasonings) & steamed broccoli. Will make again, thanks!

It was ok except for the salt content. If I ever make it again, I would put only 4 or 5 T of soy sauce and omit vegetable stock for couscous.

We love this. We make it with Salmon and don't use MSG, but everything else is according to the recipe.

Absolutely Delicious!! Instead of MSG I used salt and pepper. Also I used liquid amino acids instead of soy sauce for a healthier choice! Will defiantly be making again!

Great dinner - will try again with rice as I still am NOT a couscous fan - but loved the flavors.  Served with baked broccoli also here on AR which echos the citrus chili flavor of this dish!  Lovely dinner!

This is a tasty recipe even when the amounts of soy sauce and sugar are reduced, and is a good foundation for customizing your own sauce (and for me, adding some veggies).

Thank you, Grumpy's Honeybunch! This was EXCELLENT! Fixed it as-written, but doubled the sauce (my bad, because it didn't thicken as it should've, but that's not your fault.)The flavor was *wonderful*, and my husband, who normally hates cous-cous, loved it, too! Kids, husband, and me ate like pigs, and I was just coming off of the 'flu, too- figured it couldn't hurt, seeing as it's so darned close to fat-free- and it was better than chicken soup by a lot! LOL Wonderful recipe- thank you so very, very much! :)

We really liked this recipe! I followed the recipe pretty closely. I didn't have a lime so I didnt have the zest and i used lime juice from a bottle. We eat low carb so I didn't make the couscous and served lightly sautÃ©ed French green beans. I will definately make this again.
