This was just like my mom made many years ago when I grew up on Long Island. I used 12 oz of cod filet (nice firm white fish) and I also added a stalk of celery finely chopped to the onion.  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and some milk to get the right consistency and a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  It needed salt very badly! and oh, I cooked the potatoes mostly in chicken broth.  Guess I changed it somewhat, but t was really delicous.  My 90 yr old dad said it was just like mom used to make....a real complement for sure!

THis was great but I made a few changes so I could throw it in the crockpot...  I didn't have any onion, so instead used a couple of ribs of celery and cooked them up with about 1/2 a pound of bacon.  I used frozen diced potatoes (about 2 cup) and added a can of sweet corn.  I made a white sauce (to thicken my milk a bit).  I used whiting (about 4 fillets.  I cooked the celery and bacon before adding it to the crock.  Cooked it on high for about 4 hours - came out delicious!  Even our kids loved it.

This is a very simple, tasty recipe.  I used flounder instead of haddock and it would be good with most any fish.  I also used cream in place of the milk, and it had a delicious, rich flavor.

Very good fish chowder and easy to make. I did add some chicken broth instead of water to cook the potatoes in. I also added some cream instead of milk.

I loved this chowder partly because it wasn't to fishy tasting and partly because it wasn't filled with heavy cream.  I sauted celery and garlic with the onions and bacon and added about 1/8 cup of half & half with the milk.  This was even better the 2nd day.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely make again.

I have to review this recipe again because it's just soooo good! This time, I added celery, mushrooms & scallions w/ the bacon & onion sautee, also used half & half instead of milk and chicken broth in place of the water for potatoes. I also added 1 can of corn - again I used leftovers, grilled swordfish steaks in a terriyaki marinade. I have not tried raw fish yet, but this recipe will work with anything - very versitile and absolutely perfect!! I get such great compliments on this dish, you have to try this! Thank you again for an awesome recipe!

I prepared this chowder for a church dinner for 75 people. It was a tremendous hit. Most people came back for seconds, a few for thirds. Easy to and quick to prepare.

This meal was delicious.  I have always wanted to make my own chowder.  This was perfect.  The next time I will put more fish in it though.

Great recipe, loved it, I did change a few thing, added celery, carrots, freah bay leaf and fresh thyme to the potatoe mixture. I also used 5% cream and cooked the potatoes in chicken broth. Added a little hot sauce near the end and the results were fantastic. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was decent, but it needs some work to be really good. The directions for cooking the bacon and onion are a little flawed. The bacon, when cooked with the onion and added to the soup, ends up turning rubbery in the broth. The chowder itself really lacks seasoning. It needs salt and garlic to really flavor it properly. The recipe calls for milk, but states in the direction "milk product". I used cream to give the chowder a thicker texture. I also used a potato masher to help thicken it before adding the fish. This left some of the potatoes chunky. To make this better if I make it again, I'd cook the bacon crisp and remove and drain it, then use the drippings to cook the onions and a clove or two of minced garlic. I'd save the bacon and garnish the chowder with it at the end, then allow diners to stir it in before eating. (I cooked extra bacon to use as a garnish.)

Very bland.  I added frozen green beans just before serving, this give it a little more texture.  With the leftovers, I pureed it and served it as a soup, more pepper was added. I like the simplicity of this reciepe.

We really liked this recipe. I only used 1 slice of bacon and used 6 potatoes and a little chicken bouillon in the cooking water for the potatoes. I also used tilapia because that is what I had. I just cut it in very big chunks so it wouldn't fall apart as easy and stirred it carefully after I added them.

I did add some chicken bullion, but otherwise followed the recipe. I finished it in the crock pot on low for 4 hours and served with fresh baked Rye bread and Caeser salad. Delish!

Very nice, and very easy. I actually did not have baccon, but I did have left over ham and haddock fillet. I chopped the ham with the already cooked haddock, and it came out great! Also, the pre-cooked ham was probably a lot healthier than baccon!

I'm afraid I could hardly taste the fish at all.  Maybe it was because I used thick-cut bacon, but it tasted more like "Bacon-Onion-Potato Soup" than fish chowder.  Sorry; maybe I'll try again with more fish and less bacon, or put some clam juice in with the potatoes.

Our family loves this recipe. It is tasty just the way it is; though I usually make the following changes:  I add some half & half to give it rich white color. I also add a pat of butter to each bowl, so it melts and floats on top...so tasty. My kids LOVE bacon so I use about 8 slices.  It tastes even better the next night!

Great flavor. I used 1/2 lb haddock and precooked bacon, and sautéed the onions in a tablespoon of butter.

I used vegetable broth in place of water to cook the potatoes. Also added a bit of garlic to sauté with the bacon and onion. Used 1/2 pound of fresh haddock. Half and half made it rich and delicious. It's now a household favorite.

Hi Guys:

I must say, preparing this recipe was great.  It was so good that my fiancee who doesn't like soups, enjoyed this one very much. To the point that he had 3 bowls.

I really recommend this recipe and thanks to the person who shared it with us.

This was very very good.  I used dried beef insead of bacon to cut down on fat and it was very good.  I did add some lemon juice and salt and pepper we will have this again for sure.
