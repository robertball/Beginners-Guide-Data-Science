I learned a good tip in Mexico for serving guacamole: to keep it from turning brown when sitting out for extended periods of time, eg. during a party, keep the avacado pit(s) inside the dish with the guacamole.

This recipe is so easy, you can't go wrong. It went fast, and I will definately make it again- my *only* suggestion would be some lime juice. Adjusting the taco sauce made it more tomato tasting, but a twist of lime and the dash of salt really made it guac!

This was very tasty.  I have several different recipes for guacamole, and I use which ever one I am in the mood for because they all have a little bit different taste.  I will be keeping this one too for sure.

I do wonderful Guacamole.  My husband never ate guacamole till he tried mine.  I use the juice from one lemon for 4 avacadoes.  I use finely chopped green onions 2-4 I also like a fresh tomato or two finely cohpped, a clove of crushed garlic.  We like ours tart.  Ace

This was really good.  It was my first time making guacamole so I didn't know what to expect.  I used the whole shallot and the whole jar of sauce since there would have only been a little bit left anyway.  I would make this again, but next time I will add the lime juice and salt that another reviewer suggested just to see what the difference is.

I did not really care for this. The taste was bland.

Well...we liked it, but not as much as our regular version of guacamole.  I didn't use quite as much taco sauce since 2 avacados do not yeild very much and used garlic powder instead of the cloves.  I think I'll stick with my original way of making guacamole, but I'm glad I tried this version.

Though this was definitely not your typical guacamole, we enjoyed it. I made it as specified, but felt it still needed the finely minced cilantro, a bot more garlic, onion (rather than shallot) and jalapeno that I had already prepared for my regular guacamole recipe, so I added that as well and felt it took it to the next level. I also added a bit of lime juice to help stifle browning.

I wanted a guacamole that was quick and easy and this certainly lived up to its name.  However, it needed some lime juice for flavour and next time I would also grate in some onion. and some minced jalapenos.
