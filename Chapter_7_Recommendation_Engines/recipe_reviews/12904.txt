Excellent... couldn't stop eating!  I made a few little changes, that I think really enhanced the flavor. 

I changed the 1/2 cup of water to 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I added some white wine after adding the broth, probably about 1/4C - 1/2C.  I also added some crushed red pepper.  After the musssels opened, I turned the heat down and let it simmer for a while so the potatoes and mussels would absorb the broth/wine flavor. 

Can't wait to make it again!

This meal is great w/ a loaf of french bread and friends. I added onions to the anchovy, garlic, and olive oil.

I made a half recipe of this, and substituted white wine for the added water at the end.  Quite tasty, and very simple to make.  I'd consider adding some fresh dill or fennel next time.

This was ok, but wasn't that great.  Adding chicken stock and wine did improve the flavour, but it didn't feel like a proper stew.

I love Mussels and I love broccoli, but together they just didn't seem right.

Great dish for Spring and Summer. Nice, mild flavor and great mix of colors for plating on the table. I cut the brocolli stems at about 2 inches long, would cut at 1 inch next time for easier eating.

The mussels were delicate, the potatoes tender and sweet, and the broccoli rabe added a tinge of sharpness to the stew.  Delicious!

Lovely dish. Switched out the water for chicken broth as reccomended by Jessica, and was thoroughly pleased. I admit that I cheated on the mussels and bought some five minute boil-in-th-bag ones in a garlic and herb sauce, but this only added to the flavour! In the end I did this as more of a broth than a stew. Potatoes came out lovely. Thanks for the recipe, Christine!
