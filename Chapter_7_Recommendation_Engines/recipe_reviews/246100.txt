Everyone enjoyed this but I do feel there needs to be more seasoning on the chicken. It was quick and simple to prepare, and I would make it again.

This was quick and easy. I made as directed, however I would suggest seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper. I think that using parmesan or Italian Cracker Barrel shreds would be a nice change up.

This was a fast weeknight dinner, but was meh for us. The lack of seasoning was a big thing and a too high baking temperature made the bottom of the chicken overcooked, maybe 375 degrees would be better. I sprinkled the top with the Parmesan shreds because we really like them. #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA #EndWithAmazing

This is a good, basic recipe that could easily be elevated with more seasonings or with diced peppers.  If I were to make this again I would divide the cheese and add half to the top of the dish to brown and perhaps use a different type of tomato.  This is a very quick dish to prepare and cook which is great for weeknights.

Did any editor of kitchen tester try this? All of the measurements are wrong and it taste bland. I used one  of the new cover wraps after I cut the chicken up. Still disappointed, which I had never been before.

I would definitely rewrite this recipe.. Allrecipes!! You are noted for savory and flavor full recipes , but this lacks both!! Maybe your staff should make recipes before you publish, there are so many ingredients that would make this recipe off the charts!!

Easy, quick and tasty. Perfect for weeknight meal and kid approved. I seasoned my chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and added just a little minced onion. I would make again, especially since all the ingredients are pantry staples in my house.

We really liked this. Used mozzarella-cheddar because my grocery store didn't have mozzarella, and used garlic & olive oil stewed tomatoes (was all they had), but it worked out perfectly. Would try seasoning the chicken first next time for that extra punch of flavour. Would definitely make again.

I was not crazy about this dish.  It was quick and pretty easy, but I found the flavor was lacking.  My husband enjoyed it and took the leftovers to work for lunch.

This was a really simple and quick recipe. The flavour is very basic but a little more seasoning on the chicken would fix that easily.
I would even add mushrooms and maybe some bell pepper to the stuffing mix.
All in all, this is a great recipe for a busy weeknight.

We enjoyed this recipe a lot - more than I thought we would. I made the recipe according to the recipe directions and the only change I would make is to season the chicken with salt and pepper before topping with the other ingredients.

I quite enjoyed this recipe!  I only had a low salt box of stuffing so made sure to season my chicken quite well.  I also ended up adding more cheese after I started eating it.  You can never have too much cheese!  A keeper!

Chicken and stuffing, Yum.  Note that the picture does not represent the finished dish.  When making it again, I would add more cheese.  #EndWithAmazing #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA

This was good. Fairly basic in flavor but could easily be elevated. Depending on how small you cut your pieces adjust cook time accordingly. Mine were about 2 inches cubed spread thin along a 9x13 inch glass pan, and it was done in 25 minutes. 
If I make this again I will mix chicken with some pesto, use homemade garlic crostinis broken up,and more cheese. 
Would be nice garnished with fresh basil and a drizzle of a nice balsamic.

New quick chicken dinner that differs from the using frantic rice, chicken soup casserole.  Use thin chicken breasts, removed cover for last 5 minutes of baking time and sprinkle on a little more mozzarella.
