This is now one of my favorite fake meat recipes.  I did alter slightly.  I replaced wheat germ with flax seed meal, used fresh bread crumbs, used a couple sprinkles of dried minced onion instead of fresh, used cheddar cheese and covered top with barbecue sauce. Also, replaced crushed tomatoes with 1/3 cup marinara sauce.  Good texture and flavor.  Will make again.

This is a fabulous recipe for our vegetarian household!  Cook the lentils and rice with more water than usual to make the loaf not so dry.  I also mix a little cheese into the loaf and then sprinkle some more on the top.  This is truly the best vege-loaf I've ever had!

This was REALLY good, moist and tasty.  I used fresh breadcrumbs instead of dried (4 slices wholemeal bread), green lentils instead of brown, left out the wheatgerm, added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, 1 shredded carrot and 2 sticks chopped celery.  Also I topped it with BBQ sauce before cooking, and cooked for 1 1/2 hours.  My husband loved it too.

WOW!!!  If I hadn't made it myself I would have had to ask the cook if they were sure there wasn't any meat in it.  This recipe is much better than "real" meatloaf.  I added 1/2 c. of Italian stewed tomatoes and juice from a can instead of 1/3 c. and I put ketchup on the top for the last 1/2 hour of baking time.  Other than that, I wouldn't (and won't) change a thing.  It's also very good as cold leftover sandwiches!

I veganized this recipe (ground flax seeds and extra tomatoes instead of eggs, and brewers yeast instead of cheese). It was quite good, and I think that I could get away with feeding it to my non-vegan family without them realizing that it is not meatloaf. It was great with a side of baked tomatoes as "gravy". I will make it again.

I had no thyme for this recipe, so, in a panick, substituted some basil and oregano instead, which I'm sure influenced the flavour!  I also used a bit more sauce than was specified, and spread some sauce and ketchup mix on the top.  It turned out a little bland but was good with salt and pepper.  VERY FILLING, may I add.  I grated mozzarella on half the top and parmesan on the other- both were excellent!  Sidenote:  lentils do not mash very well when they're cold!!!  Good recipe though!

I don't know why other reviewers thought this was dry unless they baked it longer than one hour.  As I assembled it, I expected it to be dry and made some gravy in anticipation, but it was really great, texture wise.  I will definitely make this again, but will tweak it a bit to make it more like Mom's.  I plan to add onion, celery, and bell pepper, and top it with ketchup, maybe.

I like this recipe. It's very versatile. I made it for a friend, left out the thyme and hot sauce and added paprika, and used less ketsup (she's diabetic) added alittle liquid smoke and used sharp cheddar instead of the mozzarella. After its refrigerated, it slices nicely and reheats well for a sandwich.

This was pretty good and I think with some tweaking it would be really good.  Make sure you cook the lentils long enough to get them really soft.  I should have added the extra water that another person suggested because mine were still a little too firm.

This was AWFUL - my husband and I have been married almost 5 years, and this is the first meal he has ever not liked. He is not a picky eater at all and likes all the new things I cook, but after my son and I tasted it, and after just looking at it, he didn't take one bite. It was horrible, plus it was a pain to make. Not worth the trouble, even if it wasn't any trouble. The worst meal I have ever tasted (except for my side dishes).

This had way too much filler and not enough "good stuff," so to speak. It looked like a big warm loaf of bread with specks of black beans (which I used in place of lentils). The flavor was good, though... Next time I make this, I will probably halve the wheat germ and bread crumbs and double the lentils/beans and rice.

I was really hoping I liked this, but I didn't. I think it has potential, but because it takes so long to make I don't think I would make this again.  It did look like meat, but it was dry and after a few bites it wasn't good. :(

Very good.  I modified it a little, used only a small onion, added a tbsp. of fresh garlic and added a ketchup/brown sugar glaze.  The recipe was good, I'm definitely glad to have a veggie meatloaf option, but it needed the glaze.

This was great. I chopped up portobellas and added to the recipe. Cut it in slices and freeze it for a delicious lunch to bring to work with some cooked greens! :)

This was pretty good. I think next time, I will use less thyme. It came out tasting a little like Thanksgiving stuffing. I made a few modifications this time: I didn't have wheat germ so I used nutritional yeast instead and I substituted ground red pepper for hot sauce since I was out of sauce. Overall, this was good. Very filling. Made great leftovers. I will definitely make this one again.

I feel like I must start off saying that I love all types of food. I just didn't like this recipe. I think it is the wheat germ that I didn't like. The meatloaf had an unpleasant taste. I ended up throwing it away after a few bites. I am sure this is just a matter of personal taste since several others really like this.

Pretty tasty! I made a bunch of changes, though. I added 1 tsp ground cumin to the lentils as they were cooking, substituted 1 cup of bread crumbs with Stovetop stuffing (I ran out of breadcrumbs), substituted the soy sauce for worchestershire, grated a carrot and threw that in, and used a sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. I also doubled the amount of hot sauce and topped the loaf with a thin layer of BBQ sauce and more sharp cheddar cheese. For a vegetarian meatloaf, this came out much better than I was expecting. I think with a little more tweaking it could be 5 stars - It still came out a tad bland, but still good.

I used ground Frito's instead of bread crumbs and pinto beans instead of lentils.  Instead of thyme I used parsley. I used shredded coconut instead of rice, and pureed Brussels sprouts instead of tomatoes.  Instead of cheese, I topped it with sawdust.  But other than that, I didn't change a thing.

A great veggie meatloaf.  I might try adding portabello mushrooms next time.  We also used the last of our beef stock to cook the lentils which was yummy.

I have made this recipe multiple times now, and my husband and I just LOVE it!! We double it and use a stoneware casserole dish that is big enough to handle it. I have never bothered with any changes because it is so good as written! I have topped it with salsa sometimes or a variety of other sauces. It freezes just fine also. Delicious, nutritious, and inexpensive to make. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good. The texture and and flavor is very close to that of real meatloaf. It was pretty dry as leftovers though. Even so, I'll probably make it again because it's a good healthy and cheap meal.

This was filling and tasty.  A little salty, so you might want to use low-sodium soy sauce, bread crumbs, etc. Panko breadcrumbs helped reduce the salt. We used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and it was very tasty.

I thought this "meatloaf" was okay tasting. I ended up adding twice as much  rice to the batter because I made it too salty, so the extra rice fixed that. What I wasn't crazy for in reality was the thyme taste, it was only a tsp but I thought it was strong. I will make again with another spice of my preference. My husband LOVED exactly how it came out and said he wouldn't change a thing. He wants me to make it regularly, so I guess that is good.

I can rate this recipe in three words: OM NOM NOM. My changes- red lentils, a small white onion, added some garlic powder, and spread some ketchup on the top of the loaf. Even my meat-eating boyfriend liked it (and he loves him some real-meat meatloaf). And MAN, next day "wheatloaf" sandwiches with a slice of cheese and some ketchup were AMAZING!

I love this recipe! It's become a staple at our house. The most recent time I made it I added Worcestershire sauce to the mix before baking, and drizzled hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce on top once it was almost finished cooking. Added a lot of zing. When preparing the lentis I also add a bit of black pepper to the water, which seems to spice up the overall flavor.

This recipe was a lot of work for such a bland dish. I left out the hot sauce, because my 21 month old son would be eating it, but other then that I followed it exactly. Unfortunately disappointing.

Delicious! I was worried about it being dry as reviews mentioned so I used a whole cup of lentils, less breadcrumbs - maybe one cup (I only had Italian) and more tomatoes. It was really really tasty. I did have a disaster when trying to get it out of the pan though oops - don't know the trick there, maybe line the pan? Mine took 1.5 hours to cook properly.

Fantastic meal! My husband loves it better than the real thing. It did need sauce though so I used one from my old meatloaf days and it tasted great.

I thought this was very good.  I used brown sugar and ketchup to put on top.  Just used dried onions and left out the wheat germ.  It looked really good.  I will make mine thinner next time so the ketchup topping goes with more of the meatloaf.  Made great sandwiches all week.

Very good! A few minor changes... I didn't have any onion, so I threw in about half a packet of dry onion soup mix. Added a few more herbs and made a glaze for the top. This had wonderful texture and flavor. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the rice & lentils in more water than normal so the loaf would be moist. I totally forgot to mash the lentils, but it didn't seem to matter at all. I think next time I will add some shredded carrot or zucchini too. Thanks! :)

I'm NOT a picky eater, so I was surprised at my thoughts on this recipe. It's hard to rate food, since taste buds vary so greatly person to person.  I followed a lot of the suggestions (with add-ins), but it was still so, so bland. Also, it was more like a casserole consistency. I can't imagine, even w/ adding more bread crumbs, that it would ever be sliceable, like meatloaf. My kids, however, actually ate it, so the least that can be said is that it wasn't offensive. If your family likes casseroles, with a lot of "doctoring" spice-wise, this would be a good recipe to try.

Super easy and very delish.  The kids liked the flavour too and it's not mushy nor dry.  I didn't have wheat germ so just left it out and it was OK.  I also put some of the crushed tomatoe with a bit of worcestshire sauce and sugar over the top for the last 10 minutes of baking.

I tried several of the tips to spice it up, but it was still a little bland.  Added teaspoon of chili powder, 2 tbsp worchester sauce, BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, cooked lentils in water with black pepper added, tsp garlic powder.  Next time, I will add a Thai chili pepper. That always adds zing!

I followed the recipe except I used soy mozzarella cheese. Next time I would put less wheat germ and add some ground flax seed. Also, it needs more spices. And I'd use pasta sauce instead of crushed tomato, and use more than 1/3 cup.

This is great!  I've already made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe to a T and it was pretty good, just a little bland.  The next time I was out of eggs, so I substituted a can of condensed tomato soup and left out the tomatoes.  I also doubled all of the seasoning ingredients and made a ketchup and brown sugar glaze for the top- it was moist and very flavorful.  My non-vegetarian boyfriend loved it!

This is a great starter recipe.  Next time I'm going to add a ton more veggies and seasoning.  Next time I will be dicing garlic and celery for this, plus I will add some season salt or something.  If you don't mess with the recipe, you get a bland meatloaf.  I'll definitely be making this again, I will just be adding a lot more.

I found this recipe on accident with perfect timing as I had just made lentil soup and had lots of left overs. Not much of a cook but thought hey why not - so made it with leftover soup and instead of all the seasoning type stuff threw a packet of meatloaf seasoning  in with classico 4 cheese inside and out and a sharp cheddar topping -- WONDERFUL!! Thanks for the idea

It was a little dry not too bad, but also lacked flavor for my taste. Needs garlic and a glaze. I made a sauce after the fact just a simple ketchup, mustard and brown sugar mix, which helped. My husband says he would eat it again with the slight changes, so it's a keeper.

This recipe is great!  I added some italian seasoning, pepper, and garlic.  I also prepared the loaf pan with a layer of brown sugar and then some ketchup.  Then I put the meatloaf mixture on top of that.  Makes it really tasty after it's cooked.

I give this four because it seems hard to get perfect.  I wanted to make a suggestion based on my invention to use the vast amount of food it makes!  I used leftovers to make a "Parmigiana" dish.  In other words, sliced it, poured tomato sauce over it, topped with mozzarella and romano cheese, and baked it again.  Served it with spaghetti and spinach.  It was out of this world!  From now on, I'll make this recipe just to use it this way.

I thought this was OK. The taste was fine texture was a little mushy and it would have been very bland with out a ketchup glaze on top. Overall I probably wouldn't make it again I just don't seem to be a fan of substitute meat dishes. Thanks anyway

I made this for my meat loving husband and my father.  My father wanted the recipe--I'll never tell and my husband requested this for dinner the other night.  I skipped the wheat germ and the ketchup because I didn't have either on hand.  I am using fresh thyme now.

This recipe ROCKED!  Wow...it brought back childhood memories of my Mom's meatloaf.  Now that I am vegetarian I thought I would never taste a meatless "meatloaf" that was so  tasty.  Kudos to the chef!!  YAH!

This "meatloaf" turned out fantastic.  I'm not a vegetarian but my boyfriend is and we both loved it.  I served it with a miso gravy and that helped the dryness a lot.  It's also great as a leftover sandwich.

I was skeptical, but this was actually pretty good. You had to cook the lentils & the rice separately, so it took a while. The second time, I substituted the lentils for canned pinto beans; took less time & was just as good. It was better warmed up the next day.

The recipe says that it only takes an hour to cook, but that doesn't count the
time needed to cook the lentils and rice.

The recipe works well with an egg-substitute (like Ener-G).

And, just like real meatloaf, it was very good the next day on sandwiches!

Wonderful!!  My husband liked this recipe even though he doesn't like lentils even.  It really tastes like meatloaf, the only thing different is the texture!

Taste like the real thing!  I couldn't believe how good this "meatloaf" was.  Next time I will add more tomatoes, green pepper and mushrooms.  I didn't have mozzarella cheese so I used cheddar.  Any kind will work.  Leftovers make a great meatloaf sandwich.

Without the original poster's recipe, I couldn't have made this meatloaf, but I did make a lot of changes based on previous reviews. It was a big hit. I can't imagine making this without the changes. 5 stars with the changes.

I used cooked frozen lentils.

I sauteed chopped mushrooms, celery, onions, and red peppers. I added Tex Mex seasoning near the end of sauteing the veggies. 

I used about 3/4 cup of gluten-free seasoned bread crumbs.

I spread the crushed tomatoes with marinara sauce on top of for the last 30 minutes of cook time. 

I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup.

I doubled the mozzarella cheese.

I used 3 eggs. 

I left out the wheat germ, hot sauce, and thyme.

Cooking time was for 1-1/2 hours and it was moist and delicious!.

I was happy to find this recipe as I had some frozen cooked lentils I didn’t know what to do with.  I admit I added three garlic cloves minced, oregano and Chile powder and increased the thyme.  If I make it again I think I will also add some salt and black pepper.  My husband was quite skeptical, but after tasting it said it was pretty good.  I enjoyed it and will probably make it again.

I didn't have any ketchup so I used salsa instead of the crushed tomatoes to give it some extra flavor.  Yes, I will make it again.

Mixed reviews from the family.  Some of the kids liked it, but my husband hated it.   We're on a big frugal kick right now, so lots of beans/rice/lentils.  This is not one of the more tasty recipes we've tried.

Hubby  and I loved it. Served with a brown gravy and mashed potatoes. It's good as a cold "meatloaf" sandwich too, if yours doesn't turn out real moist. I didn't have wheat germ, so added crushed crackers. I think I may add a bit of celery next time. Very satisfying.

This recipe is EXCEPTIONAL!!! I used green lentils, substituted ground flaxseed for the wheat germ, jarred marinara instead of crushed tomatoes, and omitted the cheese and hot sauce. I added fresh garlic, sage, rosemary, onion powder, garlic powder, and extra thyme. Baked it covered in a Le Creuset rectangular casserole dish (approx 11x8). This definitely needs sauce! I layered some on top before baking and reserved the rest to add to individual portions. Sauce ingredients: 25 oz jarred marinara, ketchup, brown sugar, worchestire, tamari, and fresh garlic. Enjoy!

my ten yr old and I made this tonight. it doesn't call for a lot of seasoning so I did add a clove of garlic and I sautéed that with the onions before assembly. I would also add some other herbs and spices in the future. it was a good solid base loaf but I highly suggest whipping up a delicious mushroom gravy or onion gravy to go along with it and don't be afraid to add your touches to it. I think this would also make a really tasty burger patty.

Got really great responses from hubby and kids.  However I did change some things: added one stalk chopped celery, more crushed tomato and ketchup, added sea salt, italian seasoning, garlic powder, an extra egg white and omitted soy sauce.  Would be a nice recipe for if you have leftover lentils and rice, but it was a LOT of work and steps for what it turned out to be.  I would love to add additional red or green peppers.  I used flax seed instead and rice crumbs instead bread crumbs as we are gluten free.  Served with mashed red potatoes and green beans.  Overall, a lot of work that could be cut down when you have leftovers, but a good base recipe for vegetarian or vegans if you omit cheese.

Really scrumptious. As suggested by some other reviewers, added red pepper and fresh garlic and substituted dried country mix for lentils. It was beautifully moist and my two teenage boys loved it.

I love all the ingredients separately, but apparently not together. Maybe it was just too much filler (bread crumbs, wheat germ?) and not enough good stuff? Plus, I followed directions exactly and it was still a soggy, hard-to-slice mess.

This was very mushy--when I tried to cut slices of the loaf I failed horribly, had to scoop out with a spoon instead. Maybe it was undercooked? Decent taste, but not amazing. Overall, good but not great.

This was OK.  I used BBQ instead of ketchup and added 4 cloves of garlic, halved the onion (it was still a lot!), and threw in a little frozen peas and carrots.  It was still really bland and I have a TON of it left over that will probably never get eaten.  Overall, it's interesting but too much of a pain to make for what it's worth.

Two words- D O G   F O O D !
We followed the recipie to a T and it was gross. Kind of like baking refried beans with thyme and onions. I am a carnivore, my wife is a vegitarian and we both hated it and couldn't even choke it down. This is a huge waste of time!

A great place to start from, I used flaxseeds instead of wheat germ and I sauteed some leeks and garlic with herbs before adding to the mix. I also thought it might be a bit dry so I added more crushed tomatoes and it turned out great. Hard to get my boyfriend excited about imitation meatloaf but he loved it and the leftovers were the best part.

While I wouldn't really call this a "loaf", what came out of my oven was really delicious! My concoction was a bit mushy and didn't hold together but that was probably due to the following changes I made: omit wheat germ, add shredded zucchini, carrot and celery, add one can diced oregano and basil tomatoes. It was really very good with these changes and made a ton! My husband enjoyed it as well and is happy to have a lot of leftovers!

i was very disappointed.  unfortunately this was mushy and didn't taste at all like a meatloaf.  my changes:
* 1/4 cup wheat bran instead of 1/2 cup wheat germ
* lemon pepper breadcrumbs, reduced by 1/4 cup
* added 3 tbsp flax seed meal
* green onion instead of regular onion
* 1/4 tsp habanero hot sauce
* 1.25 tsp salt
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* glaze of ketchup, mustard, brown sugar

I had to give this only 3 stars because it came out way too moist and uniformly soft, but that may have been my fault. Since onion is such an important part of the recipe I'd like a clearer definition of "large"--how much diced onion should I end up with? I only used what I would call a medium onion and it was still a LOT of onion.

More importantly-- the information at the top of the recipe say the cooking time is 1:45, but the recipe directions only call for cooking for one hour. Which is the correct time?

This was a good basis to start from, but next time I might cut the onion larger and try to drain more moisture out of the lentils.

Ummm....This was not AS good as I'd hoped for, but it wasn't horrible either.  It was just a little bland and could be a little more moist.  Not sure if adding more crushed tomatoes would help?

I've made this twice now and both times it came out wonderful, the second time I made some subs, because we were almost out of bread crumbs, I was short 1/2c and used oats instead. My husband even liked it, he really likes his meat.

The only reason I would not give this recipe a 5 is that mine came out really mushy, but tasted really good. Instead of crushed tomatoes  I used a can of stewed tomatoes, and added the cup of grated carrots like someone else suggested. I also used chedder cheese because that was all I had. Very tasty!

I would agree with previous reviewers that it would need extra tomatoes and would be better dressed with a tomato glaze, otherwise dry. Good taste however. Will try again.

Lovely recipe!  I did make some changes, however.  First, I added crumbled fresh bread, as suggested by another reviewer, and added about a teaspoon of garlic powder which was also suggested.  No hot sauce for me, please :)  I also put a can of tomato soup over it an hour into baking.  I pulled it out to check it but it wasn't done and it was kind of bland and dry, so that's how the soup got there.  I baked it another hour, but that turned out to be too long.  I would suggest baking it an hour and a half, otherwise it really starts to dry out.  I realized too late that I don't like thyme, so next time I'll just omit it all together.  It still turned out tasting pretty good.  I'll certainly keep this recipe on hand!

Wow!  I did not expect this to turn out very well, especially after I screwed up the recipe several times.  I only had 1/3 cup of brown rice, so I added more lentils to even it out a bit.  I also didn't have any wheat germ.  I substituted cheddar cheese for mozzarella since we were all out of that too.  Oh, and I forgot to cover it while it was cooking.  It turned out great!  Definitely a recipe I'll keep, but I can't wait to also try it with the right ingredients.

I was very pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I was looking for a way to use my lentils and I had to go out and buy more so I could make this again.  It doesn't taste meatless to me.  It obviously doesn't have beef, but I would have guessed ground turkey.  Yummy!

This recipe took forever to make! I personally didn't like the loaf so much (as a vegetarian who has never liked "meat" loaf), but my vegetarian husband thought it was great, especially when I cooked it with ketchup all over the top like the meatloaf from his childhood. The recipe makes many more servings than it says because a tiny piece is very filling. My husband got tired of it after several consecutive days of meatloaf sandwich lunches. We had to throw away a third of the loaf as a result.

Great recipe! I'm the worst, pickiest vegetarian in the world, so to get me to eat anything containing beans is a challange!  My whole family loved it!  Next time I'll add some sort of sauce; it's a little dry.  But a great meal and very healthy!

What a fabulous recipe!?!  I served this to meat eating guests and they all liked it.   I crumbled fresh white bread (the heavy Pepperidge Farms white) in place of the dry crumbs listed and it was very moist and delicious - definitely a "keeper"!!

I'm always on the lookout for vegetarian versions of the comfort meals from my childhood. This is a pretty good one -- it's fairly tasty and very easy to make, although a little bland. I used more tomatoes than the recipe called for. I think if I made this again I would add more spices too.

This recipe was okay.  I liked it, but it definitely was not "out of this world". My husband ate it, but didn't really care for it.  I also found it a little dry.  I think if I were to make this again I would definately make some sort of sauce to go with it.
