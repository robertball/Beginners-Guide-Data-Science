I have made this for several parties and it always comes out great and the recipe is very flexible.  For a standard punch bowl, I usually make it with 2 liters of ginger ale, one can of pineapple juice, and 2 quarts of sherbet (I like orange and raspberry).  Some complain it is too sweet, it can also be made with diet ginger ale or diet 7 up for a less sweet taste.

This is a great tasting punch...I found this recipe while looking for a shower punch...liked that it didn't take a bunch of ingredients and was easy to make...it was a HUGE success, before I had all the food on the table the entire punch bowl was empty...there was nothing left of the 2nd bowl either.. Would highly recommend this drink!

This recipe looks delicious, but I'm surprised it turned up in a search of recipes for diabetics. Just thought I'd drop a note that this is not a good drink to serve if you're looking to make something for diabetic guests. Thanks!

I made this for my sister's bridal shower and it was quick and super yummy!  Everyone commented on how good it was.  I used berry sherbet, pineapple juice and ginger ale.  I also added some fresh strawberries.  Just remember to pour the ginger ale slowly, and keep stirring (it foams up quite a bit otherwise).  This one's a keeper! :o)

This is REALLY simple and REALLY good!  I used orange sherbet, and it was a huge hit at my best friend's shower.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this for a baby shower, and it was a hit.  I'm not usually a punch fan, but this was very good.  I drank lots of it!  I used raspberry sherbet instead of pineapple.  Very yummy.  I will be using this recipe again for another baby shower!  Thanks for sharing!

I was so happy to find this recipe here - I've been using this recipe for punch since I was in charge of receptions for my college sorority. It is just as good if you omit the pineapple juice, which makes it such an easy recipe!

I was not nearly as impressed with this as everyone else seems to be.  My fiance thought it was great, but I think trying different kinds of sherbet is definitely the way to go.

Very good.  I made this with lime because I am looking for a green punch to serve at a baby shower.  It was really good, but I don't think it's as good as punches that use Hawaian Punch.  It tastes very much like a sherbet float would if you can imagine that.  Today was just a test run so I might try the Lime Pineapple Delight from this site.  If color was not an issue I would go with a more punchy-punch.

This punch was really easy and tasted great! We used Dole canned pineapple mango juice and raspberry sherbet. Everyone went back for seconds and thirds.

Wonderful punch.  Not too sweet/refreshing.  Made it w/ lime sherbet for St. Patrick's Day and garnished w/ an ice ring w/ lime slices.  You can change the color to match the season or color theme of your party!

I tried this recipe at a wedding reception last Saturday.  I couldn't make it fast enough!  I used a different flavor each time I refilled the punch bowl to provide variety.  Lime was the crowd favorite.  There was a ton of compliments.  Everyone loved this punch!!

Made this in individual tall frosted mugs for a birthday celebration and got rave reviews.  Used 2 ice cubes per glass, along with 2 scoops pineapple sherbet, then filled glass in equal proportions with pineapple juice and Sierra Mist.  A yummy pineapple float!

This recipe can be changed by using different sherbets and using ginger ale or 7up.  Sometimes for dessert we just fill a glass with whatever kind of sherbet we have on hand and add ginger ale or 7up.  Also good for upset stomachs.....

Absolutely love this recipe. I've made it a couple of times, and the second time, I forgot to add the juice and I actually liked it better. You can't find an easier recipe that tastes so good. Thanks!

This is very easy and good.  I used pineapple juice and lemon-lime soda, but substituted strawberry sherbet instead.  Very nice!  I was thinking of making this for 'adults only' one day, so I'm going to try adding some sparkling wine. I'm sure that would give it a nice 'kick'.

I made this for a baby shower recently, and everyone raved about how good the punch was.  I used diet 7 up, just because it was so sweet already with the juice and sherbet. I tried the recipe with using pineapple, orange, and lime sherbet.  Although all were good, my husband and I both strongly preferred the orange, and that is what i made for the shower.  It was extremely easy to make.  I will definately use this recipe next time.
