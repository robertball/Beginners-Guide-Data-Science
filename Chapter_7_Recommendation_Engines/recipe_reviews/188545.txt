I made this again. Instead of sherry, I subbed 2 T of apple-cider vinegar + 2 T of beef broth. Also omitted mushrooms and doubled squash. I was out of hoison sauce and didn't want to go to the store, so I found a recipe online in which I had all the ingredients at home. I don't think my homemade hoison was very "authentic," but boy, was it tasty! I now realize that the reason I didn't like this dish much the first time was because I did not like the store-bought hoisin sauce I had used in it. This time, I actually doubled the hoisin sauce because I felt like it wasn't flavorful enough with only 1/4 C. 

Original Review 3/23/26: I used pinot grigio instead of sherry and omitted mushrooms, so I don't know how much it affected flavor, but I didn't like the sauce very much. Too much hoisin, and definitely missing something. I'm not good at identifying missing ingredients. We get a lot of tangerines from our CSA box, so I'll make it again and play with the ingredients and report back.

This was a keeper from the first bite.  The only change I made was to use fresh orange juice instead of sherry.  We like spicy thai but really enjoyed the flavors of this dish.
