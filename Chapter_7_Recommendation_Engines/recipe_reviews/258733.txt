I loved this recipe. Purple sweet potatoes have a unique flavor all their own and before finding this recipe I only liked them boiled and mashed with butter. I made this once with less lime juice and it was delicious. I suggest that lime juice is added to taste rather than using a whole lime as limes vary so much in acidity and size. Purple sweet potatoes are a nutrition powerhouse with the rare purple pigment needed for health. I made this recipe again but boiled the potatoes rather than baked and it turned out fine.

Had to throw this out, I made it with canned coconut milk, maybe it was supposed to be sweetened coconut milk but the acidity of the lime made it taste like bile. I do wish I would have tried it with just coconut milk before adding the lime, maybe it would have been better.
