Delicious!  It really needs a lot more liquid, though.  I took one of the other changes someone else made to heart, and added apple juice instead of water, but I added about a cup.  And since I didn't have vanilla sugar, I added a tsp of vanilla to the apple juice.  It turned out great!  Next time, I may cut back a bit on the cinnamon, it was a tad bit overwhelming.  Still added it to my recipe box!!

I had a taste for baked apples, and I was looking for a recipe that was simple, and NOT complicated to make. Unfortunately, I didn't have vanilla sugar, so I had to use vanilla extract. Since I wanted to give the apples some crunch, I tweaked the recipe a little by adding some toasted walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon and sugar, and sprinkled the mixture on top of the baked apples. I served it with vanilla ice cream. My whole entire apartment smelled like apples, and this recipe is a keeper!!! :-)

These did not turn out as I was hoping. The sugars did not caramelize to make a syrup for the apples. I did stir the apples at 30 minutes before adding water. Stirred again and baked longer in hopes of that yummy syrup but no luck.If I made this again I would reduce the nutmeg to 1/2tsp as it can be can be overpowering. I would also cut the cinnamon in half or just to 1tsp. All of the spices also left a powdery texture:/ I used half Granny Smith half Fuji apples.

I made an account just to rate this recipe!  My boyfriend and I made these apples as a healthier alternative to our usual dessert fare (cookies, or a bit of chocolate) and let me say, it was a HUGE hit!  These apples were perfect- soft on the inside, with just enough crispy on the outside that they weren't mushy.  We used Honeycrisp apples and they added some sweetness to the mix!  They are easy and delicious, and I highly recommend the recipe!

Notes: We made this recipe adjusted for 2 servings, and added a pinch more brown sugar and only 1/8 a tsp of nutmeg since we don't like the taste.

This was a great way to start breakfast the day after Christmas.  We used Granny Smith apples.  I didn't have vanilla sugar so added the vanilla to the apple juice.  I used 3/4 cup apple juice instead of water.  I also cut back on the cinnamon and nutmeg as others suggested.  After 30 minutes at 350 - I added the juice and vanilla and turned the over up to 400 degrees.  The apples were cooked, but still a bit firm like we like them.  We had them over cinnamon pancakes, but would be great over ice cream or oatmeal.

I also used this as a guide and I loved it, I used more butter and more cinnamon, but since I had no vanilla sugar, I dripped vanilla over the apples. Turned out great :)

In truth, I only used this recipe as a guide, but it was very good! I used 12 small apples from my tree, as well as an unmeasured amount of butter, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla, and quick oats.  I followed the cooking time, laying, and water parts of the recipe.  Once it was done, I stirred in vegan whipped topping that I made.  My family really enjoyed it.  I will be making this again, but with more butter and quick oats next time.

I gave this four stars because I hate when people give 5 stars and then proceed to change the recipe. I used this recipe as a general guide, which was very helpful! I sliced 3 apples, tossed them in lemon juice (keeps them from browning and also allows you to use apples that may not be crisp and tart!). I did not do the layering step, I just threw everything together in the bowl. In addition to the brown sugar and cinnamon, I added 2 TBSP melted butter and about half cup of oats. I also put only a PINCH of nutmeg (nutmeg is extremely strong stuff...I can't believe this recipe calls for 1 tsp!). I also used vanilla extract instead of the vanilla sugar. I did not add any extra water as the lemon juice and vanilla extract was plenty. But if it looks too dry to you, by all means add some more water/juice. Baked at 350 for 30 min...voila! It was AMAZING!

So easy and tasty! I didn't have enough apples (about 4) and followed the recipe for the most part.  I added 4 TBs of water since I had less apples and not the entire sugar and cinnamon mixture.  Big Bonus: Baking this dish will make your entire house smell amazing for hours.

Because I made some changes I gave it 4 stars...now my recipe gets 5  stars!  My changes: increase butter to 2 T; use 3 t Stevia rather than vanilla sugar (I like to reduce sugar where I can without sacrificing taste); decrease cinnamon to 2 t; add 1 t vanilla extract; decrease nutmeg to 1/4 t; add 1/4 cup no-sugar- added applesauce rather than water.  Mix all together; 350 degrees for 30 min.

These are delicious!  I added 1/4 of water instead of 3 tablespoons and drizzled the layers with lemon juice so it wouldn't be too sweet. I also added a few drops of pure vanilla extract directly to the sugar mixture because I didn't have vanilla sugar. There is plenty of syrup after baking. I used Fuji apples.

I had added the liquid at the beginning by accident and checked it at 15 minutes. It looked dry, so I stirred it and covered it with a lid. I think this will help the problem most people are having with it being too dry. The next time, I plan to put the liquid on at the beginning and bake covered for the whole time. We loved the bold spice flavor when served with vanilla ice cream.

These were delicious, and I would recommend this to everyone.  All I would say, is that you need to use way more water in this recipe, 3 1/2 tablespoons is not enough.  But, I love this recipe and I definitely will use it again.

Simple.  She'll make it again.  10 yr old wouldn't let me in the kitchen.  We learned what vanilla sugar is.  We stirred the water in with the spices before pouring over the apples, because we didn't have 45 min. for it to bake.  We doubled it but not the water.  With the water already mixed in, we didn't need extra liquid.  It also only took 30 min in the oven this way.

Yum yum yum. This was so delicious. I used only 3 apples but left the other items about the same and it was perfect. Served over frozen vanilla yogurt...mmmm. Making again this week. And I liked the amount of Nutmeg; gave it a nice bite.

Delicious alternative to dessert.  Had just the right amount of apples about to spoil - kept them from going to waste.  

I reduced the amount of sugar in half to save the calories - still delicious!

I added Apple juice for liquid because they were drying out. I didn’t have vanilla sugar so I used light brown. It wasn’t necessary, it was sweet enough.

Like many others said, too much cinnamon. I would recommend 2tsp instead of 3 next time. I also added apple juice instead of water which I liked. I also tossed the apples on the mixture instead of layers which was easier but didn't affect the bake. I would totally make this again with less cinnamon and a little more sugar.

This was delicious, and easy to make!  Just make sure you only  add 3 TEAspoons of cinnamon!  The first time  I  made it, I used 3 TABLEspoons!  Waaay too much cinnamon!  I don't have vanilla sugar, so I used 3 teaspoons of granulated sugar, plus about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  My family likes the vanilla flavor, but you could add less, depending on your family's tastes.  I have also made this with only 2 teaspoons of  regular sugar and an extra teaspoon of brown sugar.  We like it both ways!

such a delightful desert... not to mention the aroma that fills the house is reminiscent of long ago times and chiili nights spent around the fireplace with the ones you love. 
it's funny how scents can make your mind travel. 
I, like many others, didnt have the vanilla sugar but I made my own out of powdered sugar and vanilla extract and a 200oven. of course it's simple enough to just substitute extract for sugar. 
I think next tim I'll go a little less on the cinnamon

I used more water so the apples don't dry out. I also covered the apples with foil to keep the moisture in.

Very good for a light treat. Tossed everything together, no layering. Tried to decrease sugar to 1 Tbsp vanilla sugar and 1 Tbsp brown which was very good but most prefer more sugar. 6 honey crisp apples, 1 full tsp cinnamon, touch nutmeg,  1 Tbsp cubed butter in bottom of greased 9x13 baking dish. Baked 30 mins at 350, then added 1/4 cup water and bake 15 mins more. Some pieces were still firm and others soft. Try adding a pinch of salt next time and maybe 1/4 cup more water as there was little caramelization or syrup

Pretty good, easy recipe. My recommendations are: Add more sugar, especially if you use vanilla extract. Add a pinch of salt to the sugar mixture. Use more liquid and instead of water use apple cider and a splash of bourbon;)

3 teaspoons = 1 Tablespoon

I used white sugar and added allspice and not so much cinnamon. 

It’s all just personal preference.

The oven times and liquid ingredient amount are way off in this recipe. It needs almost an hour in the oven and about 3/4 cup of liquid if you expect it to have any kind of coating. I stirred it a couple of times after adding the water as well. I like the idea of dessert apples that are relatively low calorie and yet simple to prepare in the oven but if you follow the directions as written, you will have hard apples with seasoning looking the same as when you applied them, no syrup coating.

Great as a side to pork chops.  If you have any left over, spoon some over a scoop of vanilla ice-cream later for dessert!

I am glad I read reviews before making this. I adapted this recipe by using white sugar with vanilla extract. I also added a half cup of water and walnuts which is what made this recipe fantastic. Next time I make this I want to add a little maple syrup.

This smells amazing! It doesn't quite have as strong of a flavor though. I used granny smith apples and they were a little tart for my liking. I also didn't stir it before adding the water and I ended up with applesauce on the bottom and slightly crispy apples on top. I added a little salt to bring out the sweetness a little bit. I will make it again and stir and maybe add more brown sugar.

Added no water at all...the amount of liquid you add has everything to do with the kind of apples you use.  These were so quick..faster than doing a crisp.

I made these. Poured some melted butter over them instead of the water. Pretty good for the most part. Something seemed off though.
