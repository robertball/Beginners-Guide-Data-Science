Terrific! I often find myself with a leftever ear of corn, which I end up tossing a few days later. This is the perfect solution. I thought it sounded a little plain, but wow, what great flavor - and it's so simple! I'll be making this often. No need to change a thing!

I gave this recipe a Mexican twist. Cooked & cut the vegetables the same. Omitted the butter & parsley. Added a bit of olive oil mayonnaise & fresh chopped cilantro. Sprinkled with a bit of cayenne pepper.

Doubled the recipe.  
 Did not precook the corn., just cut off cob.  Steamed squash in microwave.  Sautéed white onion in butter and olive oil (about 2 tablespoons ea.) Added corn.  After about 5 minutes added squash, drained if necessary.  Did not have parsley.
Rave reviews!  Will make again.

I love both of these veggies and combining them seemed to just sound yummy. The result was pleasing and using up leftovers and the tons of squash we get out of garden felt good.

I used corn on the cob that I had frozen and frozen summer squash from last summer. I only had dried parsley from my herb garden last year, so used that. I substituted coconut oil for the butter and seasoned with season salt. It is sooo good and I'm not a vegetable lover. Try it Mikey you will like it!

Wow!!!! This is delicious!  The first time we made it we accidentally used cilantro instead of parsley.  Just made it again using fresh Italian parsley, which is wonderful and adds Aa bright fresh flavor.

I am in love with this side dish. I have probably made it 10 times in the last month. Everyone I've made it for loves it. I don't even like yellow squash, but the corn does something to the flavor, and I go for seconds almost every time! Huge hit!!!

Great side dish!  I too as some reviewers did not boil the corn first; I just simply put the top on the skillet for less than 2 minutes after sautéing the onions and then added the squash (steamed it in a covered glass dish with just small amount of water- maybe a little more than a tablespoon - for about 2 1/2 minutes).  Also, I didn't have fresh parsley so I sprinkled on dried parsley, and I used small amounts of salt and pepper.  Next time I won't skimp on the onion and I may even try green onions (scallions) at next time...the best bites are the ones with the onion!  **Update**  I tried this with green onion/scallions and I prefer it over the white onion.  Plus, you get the green for color without adding parsley.  I used the white and green parts of 2 bunches of green onion (the fat ones, not the thin) with 3 ears of corn and 3 yellow squash (both large but not humongous) and cooked as in my first review - steamed the squash and did not precook the corn.  Very tasty! ***Update***this is even better using a combination of both scallions and white onion, as well as adding in some frozen super sweet white corn with the regular corn off the cob.

Did one zucchini and one summer squash and fried some diced onion before adding everything else, but even without these slight modifications, this is a delicious and simple recipe.  Nice change from plain vegetables but still healthy.

Yellow Squash and Corn Saute, Where have you been all my life?   I have NEVER thought to put these two vegetables together in the same dish, and I have been cooking for over 40 years.  WOW!  Such a simple, yet DELICIOUS recipe!
My neighbor brought over some of the yellow squash from her garden because she was overflowing in it. I had just bought some corn on the cobb and decided to look for TWO separate recipes to make tonight with my grilled chicken.  I found this beautiful gem!   WOW!  After reading the reviews, I KNEW I had to make this!
All I have to say is YAY!!!!  My husband loved it so much, he had me bring him 2 more servings!  That's a keeper in my books!

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for this recipe.  You managed to take 2 of my most favorite vegetables and bring it together in one AMAZING dish!   Well Done!

Nice change and flavor from my usual sauteed squash and onions.  Cut back on butter, but still had a nice, but light buttery flavor.

Never thought of combining these two yellow yummies but how amazing!!  I prefer fresh basil out of my garden to parsley so I used julienned basil and it was a hit even with my husband who will rarely eat squash.

I can't say enough how surprisingly excellent this recipe was! I'm not really a squash fan but my mom went on vacation & gave me some yellow squash & zucchini that had to be eaten soon. I saw all the great reviews for this recipe so I thought I would try it out. The corn is such a great pairing with the squash, makes the dish sweet & summery. It's so simple yet SO delicious! I used Adobo seasoning instead of salt (because Adobo makes everything better!) & added some parmesean cheese on top (because cheese also makes everything better!). This is definitely making it into my vegetable side dish rotation.

Feel like I found a hidden gem amoungst all the thousands (millions?) of Allrecipes.  It really is worthy of the 5 stars it's been given....including mine!  To be honest, it was LilSnoo's photo that enticed me and then when I saw it got a solid 5 stars from other reviewers, I decided to give it a try.  Just because I had 3 little okras on hand I decided to slice those up and added it to the mixture along with some chopped onion and basil.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  Never in a thousand years would I have thought of combining the two main ingredients (corn and squash), but it totally works!  Thanks Aunt E for submitting this....great recipe!

I have made a version of this before.  what I do is melt butter and saute  the squash then add the cooked corn.  we like our veggies aldente  the water to me makes it to soft.  Have also used zucchini  and carrots with this.  All is sautéed.  Salt and pepper to taste or your seasoning likes.

As always from the garden is a giant yellow squash hiding under the leaves so I use only one squash.  The remainder of the recipe I left alone and found it great.

This could not have been easier! I made it even more of a summer side by using fresh basil instead of parsley, more flavor and more summery taste!

I used zucchini instead of squash. Loved it and so did my husband, 5 year old, and parents. I don't use salt or pepper and it tasted great without.

I tried this today and it was absolutely wonderful, made it just the way the recipe reads except I cooked the corn in the micro, very easy, rinse the shucked corn with water, roll-wrap each ear in wax paper and micro @2-1/2 minutes per ear.  What a great side dish!

We LOVE this recipe! I've made it over & over again.  It's even good (& quick) with canned corn.  It's great with zucchini as well. The added parsley makes a very nice presentation.  TY for sharing!

Really good, I steamed squash in microwave for 5 minutes, drained.  Sauteed 1 small diced onion and added raw corn cut from cob, parsley, salt and pepper.  Simple, delicious and beautiful.

Turned out great!!  I used three yellow squash fresh outta my garden and two ears of corn plus 2 cups of broccoli florets.  I also sliced 1 whole onion and 2 tbsps of crushed garlic.  I fried 2 slices of bacon and then sautéed all the veggies slowly.  The next time I make this dish I will add the broccoli at the very end..

I started to make this for dinner but realized the yellow squash I had had been in the fridge too long. oops. I had some small red and orange peppers in the fridge and some green onions so I steamed the peppers and cut up onions including green onion tops to soften a little and continued the recipe as written. it was very tasty and colorful as well. next time I'll try it with squash. quick and easy as well

Simple and delicious. I added a clove of garlic when I sautéed. I will say it's only 4 servings in my opinion. Mine made 4 - 1/2 cup servings.

Gave it 5 stars for flavor and presentation.  Loved this dish but did not cook veggies first.  Used corn I had frozen last year and just saute it with the yellow squash until the squash was tender.  Otherwise followed recipe.  I will make this often.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I added more corn and less squash so I'd have about a half and half mix. (Just what I thought would be my preference.) Will be making again!

I combined a few of the other reviews sauteed onion with olive oil, then  steamed zucchini in microwave and added the rest to the onions with some spices. Will definitely make this again!

I went with the basic recipe and and what was on hand. So a half dozen tiny yellow squash, a can of corn, and some fresh anise basil. I'm sure it would be better with fresh corn, too, but it was pretty good with the can. The anise basil was a really nice contrast with the sweet of the vegetables, and a bit more flavor than parsley. Good use of summer veggies!

Flavor was kind of bland.    I may try again, using some of the other reviewers suggestions:  onion, etc.  I used white corn because that is what was available.  The recipe didn't specify which type of fresh corn, but suspect it may be better with yellow ears--which I will try next time.

We liked it overall. We made it with canned corn because we didn't have any fresh corn and it still turned out okay, but we found that it didn't have quite enough seasoning, so we added a LOT of pepper (we do tend to like pepper anyways), even though it had enough salt because we used canned corn.

Pretty simple to make. I like that it didn't turn into a mush, but it is cooked through. I had homegrown squash so I had to cook it longer. I added Zucchini. Very happy with this. Seems like a decently healthy dish.

I liked it but found the original recipe a little bland so added oregano and a little chilli. Will make it again though. Easy and delicious with some modifications.

Great. I needed a good way to use up corn and squash and this was it. I think a little touch of diced scallions would make it even better.
