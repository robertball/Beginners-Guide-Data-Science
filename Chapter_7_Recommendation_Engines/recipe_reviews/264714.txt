It was very good. I am going to try it again with cinnamon. I really like that it has almonds in it.

This was moist and tasty. Very easy to make too.  I made them in mini loaf pans and it only took 30 minutes.

Really good! It came out lighter in texture and also lighter in color than a standard banana bread, which I liked. For the bananas, 2 med-sized ones worked for me. I did not use the almonds but did add a very small amount of chopped walnuts. I also added just over 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate morsels which really went well here. Extracts can be strong, and I found the almond extract flavor to be very noticeable, but I liked that also, since you don't usually get that with banana breads. Like another reviewer, mine (used 3 mini loaf pans) was also ready at 30 min. Great recipe!

The almond milk caught me off guard as that's new to me; gotta give this one a try. Banana Bread was a twice a month 'must do' for my kids ... and every other kid in 'The Hood.'
