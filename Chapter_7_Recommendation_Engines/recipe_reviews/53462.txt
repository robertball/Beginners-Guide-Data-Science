These were delicious and a great side dish for grilled steak.  I cut the tomatoes in half sprinkled them with minced garlic, olive oil and kosher salt along with some basil.  I baked them until the skin was a little blistered.

I thought it was a pretty good side, but my husband went wild for these. Tip: add freshly chopped basil to tomatoes after they come out of the oven.

If to be served as appetizers can understand inserting the sliver of garlic in each but, as an addition to the buffet table, was easier for me to mince a clove of elephant garlic and sprinkle over the top plus add some garlic-infused olive oil.  I used dried oregano (1/4 tsp. crushed) and, as others, baked for 12 mins. then, topped with chunks of a Greek Feta marinated in olive oil with oregano and basil. Second time, I prep'd about 3 times the recipe and, next day, served the remaining few topped with add'l Feta and popped under broiler for 2 mins.  Next time, plan to toss the hot tomatoes with fresh spinach leaves and slivers of carmelized garlic.
A versatile recipe - thank you for submitting it.

I used only 1-tbsp. of olive oil and did not use any salt.  The recipe was well-written, the item tasted great, and it had a great presentation.  This has become a low-fat, family favorite and is very easy to prepare and set out when friends visit, too.

Love it!  I used a little minced garlic, Italian parsley, truffle oil, feta cheese, salt and pepper.  I just took a little chuck of feta and stuffed it in every tomato.  Very tasty!

I followed JDVMD's lead and used minced garlic.  And I used grape tomatoes.  I pierced each with a sharp knife to insure they'd give up a little of their juices.  Delicious side dish to our steaks.

I loved these. I do, however, wish I'd taken them out after about 12 mins - they were a little too mushy after 20. Thanks, Hannahgirl!

The only thing I added was I used basil flavored olive oil...This is a great recipe..A friend said she sprinkles parmesean cheese on top right out of the oven....If using as an hor doeurves, just put a pretty toothpick into each one.

AMAZING!!! The only thing that I added was fresh ground black pepper and basil.  This was so good and easy I highly recommend.  I am a garlic lover so this was perfect.

I liked these but instead of slipping the garlic into each tomato, I just sprinkled some minced garlic on top. Great flavor.

I was lazy, and chopped 4 cloves of garlic, tossed all the ingredients together, and put it in the oven. I made sure to "blister" the tomatoes a bit by finishing it on broil. Nice, quick, and easy side dish!

It was delicious and easy to prepare.  Extra virgin olive oil, kosher salt was added.  Grated parmesan cheese and parsley were sprinkled on top before to serving.

This recipe was good! I used most of the ingrediants, but, changed the recipe to suit our tastes better. I used Campari tomatoes (in-between the size of cherry tomatoes and plum tomatoes). Cut them in half, then cut a slit into each half. I then thinly sliced some elephant garlic (for a milder garlic flavor)and stuck it into the slits. Drizzled w/ olive oil, and seasoned w/ kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Bake for 5 min, then, top w/ feta cheese and bake for 5 min. more. Very yummy and elegant! The only thing I would change is to peel the skins off the tomatoes.

stuffed with some pre-minced garlic instead of cloves that were slivered... added lots of salt and pepper. these were really good but i think they were missing something.. possibly the basil people had mentioned or maybe even some mozzarella? overall a great, low-cost snack.

I thought it was weird that the picture shows them cut in half, but the recipe says only to cut a slit in them. I just cut them in half and it was delicious. I did take the advice of a couple others and also added fresh ground black pepper and basil before I put them in the oven. it definitely depends how small your tomatoes are for how long you bake them. I only did 10 min. and they were perfect.

Excellent recipe.  So very simple.  I did change the recipe a bit.  I used some of my home grown cherry tomatoes from my garden and split them in half.  I then used minced garlic and topped each half.  I sprinkled salt and course ground pepper on all and drizzled with olive oil.  I added a photo to the one already displayed.

I like to think that "simple" is better when it comes to ingredients and this recipe proves that!  Very light and delicious, but be forewarned that even if the outside feels cool enough to eat, the inside is still very hot.  I am a drizzling moron, (I waste too much oil when I drizzle), so I just made a spot on the pan where I rolled the tomatoes in the oil.  I stuck to the recipe, (expect I prefer sea salt), and it was a delightful sidedish.

I don't like tomatoes, but I loved this recipe!  We had so many tomatoes from our garden, and my husband couldn't keep up eating them, so I tried this.  I served with a little warm mozzarella cheese and it was delicious!

Made this with all the excess cherry tomatoes I have this year from several prolific plants.  For guests who don't like garlic, I stuffed the tomatoes with pine nuts instead.

What's to be bad here!  I might also suggest a bit of Italian seasoned bread crumbs on top, and maybe even a touch of parm~    Though, might suggest a larger tomato for all of that.

Perhaps the "sliver" of garlic I used was too thick, but the garlic overpowered the tomato.

Loved this recipe!  Quick, easy, and yummy.  Not to mention it makes your kitchen smells great!  I used Avacoda oil infused w/ Lime, and took the suggestion for using the Parm. cheese.  SUCCESS!  Thanks!

This recipe was really good, but with a few alterations. I lessened the cooking time as other readers suggested, to about ten minutes. I also sprinkled on a little basil, some fresh ground pepper, and some feta cheese and it was awesome. Next time I will try it with freshly grated parmesan and see what it is like.

I liked these tomatoes, but my DH was less than thrilled with them.  I didn't insert the garlic into the tomatoes but rather minced the garlic and tossed it with everything else.  In the end, I did find the tomatoes a bit more mushy than I thought they would be, but the flavour was good.

This was a great side dish.  I made it with garden fresh tomatoes.  I didn't think my wife would like it, but she asked me to make it again.  I did sprinkle some feta cheese on top of the tomatoes about half way through the baking.

I chose to make these tomatoes with a garlic tilapia I was serving. It was too much work to slit the small tomatoes and insert garlic into each one. I did not feel like it added much flavor, and they were cooked for too long. The texture nor the taste was satisfactory. My dining partner found them to be a simple, delicious treat, however. That is why these received two out of five stars, and not one.

These were delicious!  That little sliver of garlic does so much for the tomato!  They are simple and yum!  Thanks!

Very, very good! Excellent recipe as written. I've also used grape tomatoes (these are smaller than cherry tomatoes) and reduced the size of the garlic pieces accordingly. Still turns out great. 15 minutes in my oven, when roasted at 350, was perfect.  Thanks for posting this!

I've been overloaded with cherry tomatoes this yr. Great idea on how to use them other than in a salad.

Served this with Turkey Day dinner. I knew 3 out of 6 wouldn't touch them.but two of the three tried them and now I'll have to make a double recipe for our next get together. This recipe converted two tomato haters to baked tomato lovers.

I'm surprised these reviews are so good. My tomatoes came out way too garlicy even though I used only a tiny sliver and the skin sloughed right off the Veggie. Noone at the party liked them :( Unfortunately I would not make these again

I'm sorry this wasn't a hit with my family.
My dad, who loves tomatoes, complained that they were too mushy. I think about 10 minutes would have been just nice.
My sister didn't like the combination of the taste of tomatoes and garlic.
Personally, I thought it was so-so but I probably wouldn't make it again. Sorry.

I made this recipe as a side dish at Christmas and everyone loved it. I think next time, though, I'll follow some of the other suggestions and add a little chopped basil on top (this would have been beautiful for Christmas), and possibly make my garlic slivers a little larger. The idea of adding some parmesan cheese before serving sounds really good, too...There are many variations to this and I'll try different ones each time so the presentation never grows old and stale...This is a recipe I'll use again...thank you hannahgirl! I now have a new way of adding tomatoes to our menu.

These were good however I found myself peeling the skins off of mine. Pretty good flavor though. Might try again with some alterations/
