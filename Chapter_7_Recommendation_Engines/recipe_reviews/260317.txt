Excellent! I've never had any luck in folding corn tortilla's without them tearing in half so I used mini tortilla's and piled it all on top instead. These came out really good and the tortilla's crisped up real nice. Doing them the way I did them I was afraid they would be soft and just fall apart when we went to pick them up  but they held together like a pro. Thanks for sharing this healthier version!
