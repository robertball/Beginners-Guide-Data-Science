I was hesitant to try this is as it had not yet been reviewed. The ingredients are ones everyone has on hand and its easy to prepare. The bread is the key and needs to be worked in to fit. This was the perfect consistency and had just a touch of sweetness. 10 mins to prep and exactly 45 minutes cooking time. Excellent recipe.

I have tried several french toast casseroles on this site and they were always too sweet for our taste. Well I finally struck gold on this one.Did not change a thing either. Absolutely perfect! This will go into my repetoire for a make ahead company worthy breakfast casserole. Thanks so much for sharing.

I prepare this dish for our office staff according to recipe and it was perfect. One thing that I did in the morning after taking it out of the fridge was to let it stand at room temperature for about an hour before starting the baking process. I will definitely do it again.

Wow! My husband made this Christmas Eve while I made the egg casserole. We let it sit overnight in the fridge and (as one reviewer suggested) let it set out for an hour to get to room tempreture before we baked it Christmas morning.  Everyone really enjoyed it (adults and children) and it went well with the egg casserole. It almost tastes like pecan pie. We did use potato bread because I couldn't find the bread the recipe called for at our local market and we used salted butter and light brown sugar, but those changes are minor, the recipe is great and a keeper! Thank you Rebecca for the recipe!

I made exactly as the recipe suggested. After 45 minutes as directed, it wasn't done. I cooked in 5 minute increments and after 20 additional minutes, still not done. I had to cut slice by slice per serving and finish cooking in the microwave. It was just ok. There are plenty of overnight french toast casseroles on this site that come out perfect. I won't make it again.

Great recipe. Made it for monthly staff meeting and everyone wanted the recipe. The only thing I changed was the bread. I used french bread instead of chullah. Good reheated in the oven the next day too. Next time I am putting sliced apples and pecans on the bottom before putting the bread on top. Yum!

Made this recipe for a New Year's brunch. I cooked everything a head and froze it until I was ready to use it. I defrosted it in the fridge and let it come to room temp before re-heating. It was big hit.

I made this for my Bible study class this morning.  It was delicious!  I took syrup to go on it in case it needed it, but no extra syrup was needed.

Perfect dish for Christmas brunch. Followed the recipe with some changes in amounts. When I began pouring the syrup into the baking dish, it just seemed like there was way too much, like the bread would be swimming in it. I only used about 2/3 of the syrup. I used sliced slightly stale french bread and the amount I had was way too much for a single layer, so I put two full layers of bread in the baking dish. I did add some cinnamon into the egg mixture. I followed others' advice and let the dish sit on the counter about 40" before baking it. The cooking time was spot on, the casserole wasn't soggy at all so next time I will cut back on the syrup quantity and use a double layer of bread again. Everyone just loved this dish and I will make it again and again! There was real maple syrup on the table, some used it, some didn't. Great stuff!

Made it for a teenagers' cast after party. There were about 6 breakfast casseroles on the table and this dish was scraped clean way ahead of the others. It is now our Xmas morning breakfast treat!

Turned out fantastic just as written, no changes to cooking time.  I left it in the fridge for way more than 8 hours, probably close to 14.  I couldn't get all the bread on one layer so I had to double layer it and it still turned out fine. Obviously you can be a beginner cook and this still turns our great.  I added pecans to bottom of half the dish to try it out and next time will add to the whole dish.  My family and I don't eat much sugar and found it a bit too sweet so we might cut back on the brown sugar too, but that's just our personal taste.

I made the mistake of doubling the recipe and cooking it in 1 1/2 times the pan size, this doubled the cooking time.  You have to cook it enough until it puffs up.  Delicious!

This is one of the best French Toast casserole recipes we've ever tried! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it turned out beautifully. My father-in-law liked it so much that he put a claim on the tiny bit left in the pan, and told me that I could NOT toss it out under any circumstance! I will add this to my never-fail, "go-to" recipes! Thank you for sharing this one with us, Rebecca!

Have made this several times with different breads, soaking over night, pouring mixture, mixing bread into mixture first, etc... I made this again for our annual Christmas breakfast.  This time made it with regular white bread and poured over bread with ladle to make sure every bit had mixture.  Also cut bread into cubes. Best one yet.

I've made this six or seven times for brunches with friends. It's ALWAYS a hit. Today I made it dairy free using almond milk and Earth Balance and it was still fantastic. I always make it the night before and then cook it the next morning. Realistically, it bakes for about an hour or 1:15 so give yourself plenty of time.

This was a hit with everyone! Left out the pecans as I forgot to buy them, but it was still delicious! Some reviewers mentioned that it was too sweet - which is wasn't, but definitely sweet. Should have cooked it a while longer because it was pretty mushy in the middle.

Followed the recipe exactly and let it cool for 10-15 minutes.  It was really good not soggy at all although a little sweet.  The kids loved it... go figure.  I agree with others that the bread is key to this recipe.

Outstanding - this is exactly what I was looking for.  Oddly, the picture shows pecans on top of the finished result and yet the recipe didn't mention them.  I sprinkled 1/2 cup of chopped pecans into the bottom of the pan with the syrup & it was divine!  Thanks for sharing.

I accidentally cubed the bread instead of slicing it (and used French bread instead of challah), but it actually turned out really well.  The middle will always cook slower than the edges (Cooking 101), so be prepared for some adjustments as you cook it.  I recommend turning the pan halfway through.  Great recipe - super easy.

Made for Christmas morning. A bit too sweet for most of our taste. I forgot to put in the light corn syrup, but it probably would not have added anything except more sweet.  It does reheat very well.

Soggy Bottom.  Didn't care for the syrup on the bottom idea.  Tasty except for that.  I wouldn't make it again as written.

Wowser! Fantastic!  I couldn’t find challah bread so used a brioche bread. Didn’t change anything else. Delicious. Made it for Xmas morning and the whole family raved over it. Next time might try a more dense bread, like maybe Italian?  I think it’d be awesome with any bread but a denser bread would be a good texture. Don’t hesitate to try this.

I made this for everyone in my department at work. I was a little nervous due to the amount of Milk it called for with the egg mixture. No reason to be nervous! It actually gave it the perfect flavor when it soaked in the milk over night! Got a lot of compliments on this dish. I would highly recommend it! I also added pecans to the bottom in the syrup!

This recipe was very easy. However, my store did not have challah bread so I used an already sliced Italian loaf and it worked just fine. Making it for company this weekend.

OMG, is this good.  I made my own Challah bread (see Bread Machine Challah I, by Suzy).  It always comes out too dark.  It also make one pound plus 13 ounces.  You only need a pound. So,  I cut off the dark crust and sliced the loaf.  I used a thermometer to make sure the center was 165 degrees for safety sake.  I made it for Christmas brunch.  The longer it sat on the warmer, the better it got.

I made this for a family brunch.  I used a sliced brioche loaf.  It was delicious!  Would definitely make again.

I added apples to the syrup. But it tastes more like a bread pudding or dessert. I think ill stick to regular french toast

Love this recipe.  I forgot that it recommended that you let it sit overnight.  Instead,  I dipped the bread slices in the egg mixture and then poured the remaining over the bread slice top ensure they got a good soaking.  And then I baked it.  So yummy!

Perfect breakfast casserole this holiday morning. Everybody loved it. I have always been a fan of make ahead casseroles. There are way to many other things to do on Christmas morning other than cook. I couldn't find a loaf of challah bread.   I was in a hurry and settled for a loaf of dense sour dough bread. It worked fine. Would definitely make this again.

I made the mistake of trying this for the first time on Christmas. Never again! Always try a new recipe, before the event! Two hours, and this is what I ended up with.

Tasted good but very (too) wet. 
I had made 1.5 times the recipe and may of mismeasured?
I will try again. However, my first attempt was a fail.

I have made this several times and it is delicious.  My family loves it.

I am having my son's future in ln-laws for brunch this coming Mother's Day.  I would like to make as much ahead of time as possible.  Has anyone ever made this casserole ahead and frozen it?  I'm thinking to make it to the overnight soaking part and freezing it then.  Ideas?

This baked French toast was delicious! I made it for Easter brunch. Everyone loved it. I did add cinnamon to the syrup since I love it so much and I cubed the challah bread instead of slicing it. I made this at home and transported it to Easter Brunch an hour later. It was still warm so I didn't reheat it but next time I will. The bottom syrup hardened a little bit and was hard to scrape out of the pan. I only added 5 minutes to the cooking time and it came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as written with one addition.  I put pecans in the syrup(as in the photo) before laying the soaked bread on top.  I didn't care for the end results.  If you want a months worth of sugar in one dish, make this.  There was too much syrup and the bread was still soggy after baking.  If I were to make it again, I would use half (or less) of the syrup amount and maybe less of the soaking mixture as well.

Made this for Christmas brunch for 5 people. I followed everything except the cook time. I baked for 45 minutes. Top was soft but set. Next time, I would remove foil for last 15 minutes in order to make a crunchy topping. One piece leftover.

This turned out great! I had to substitute italian bread for the challah bread it called for because Publix had sold out so I added a couple of extra eggs. The cook times listed are not suitable if you pull the french toast out of the fridge and put it in a cold oven. I cooked it 30 minutes with the foil on and then another 40 after I removed the foil. Also, don't hesitate to top it with crushed pecans or your favorite fruit! I'm definitely making this again!

Awesome recipe, always impressive. A cross pleaser.
I use parchment paper, pushing the bread slices into the corners to make the shape right. 
When covering with plastic wrap, I like to put it right on top of the bread, not over the top of the pan to avoid dry spots.
I'm going to add some thinly sliced apples next time. Or maybe crispy bacon.
