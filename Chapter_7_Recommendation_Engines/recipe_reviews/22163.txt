This is a great recipe. I have made this many times. You will need the whole package of taco seasoning for more flavor, get mild and it won't be hot.  Make sure to soften the cream cheese in the microwave and stir the sour cream and cream cheese with the taco seasoning well before mixing in the refried beans. I double and make a 9x13 dish.  Thanks.

Delicious! This makes a ton of dip though. You'd better be feeding a crowd or do what I did; Keep the topping cheese separate from the mixed dip and dish out about 8-16 oz (a dip size portion) into a small microwave dish. Heat the dip up then put an appropriate portion of the two cheese topping on the top. Cover for a couple of minutes to melt the cheese. Don't heat the dip up with the cheese on it. The cheese ends up all melting into the dip and disappearing. You can dish the refrigerated dip and cheese out for several nights as leftovers. Oh I used a whole package of the taco mix and used pepperjack cheese instead of the monterey. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee. Yummmy yummy!

This dip was OK. I have to admit I've made better on my own with no recipe.  My husband is a HUGE bean dip fan and he didn't care for it.  It's definitely creamy, but I would not put the cheese on top.  It just creates a rubber crust on the top when it cools.  Kept breaking chips!

I mixed everything in the food processor -- beans, cream cheese, onions, etc.  The dip had a real smooth texture, and it disappeared at the function that I took it to, so it must have been a hit.

Northwest N.J.'s first white Christmas since l969 and it was a good one! Fortnately we had the whole family over for Christmas Eve and my thirteen year old daughter Tyler decided to give this dip a try. She was happy to see that this delicious appetizer was gobbled up by everyone. The only change I'll make next time is to add a couple of cans of green chiles and some cayenne to kick it up a bit. Thanks Julie!

Fantastic dip that got lots of compliments!  It also performs well using fat-free beans, sour cream, and low-fat cream cheese so that's an added plus!  I added an entire pack of the McCormick "hot" taco seasoning, and also spread a jar of medium taco sauce over the top of the cheese before baking to give it more of a kick.  I would recommend that you use one and a half cans of beans instead of two so the beans don't overwhelm the cheeses and the seasonings.

What a great bean dip recipe. My family & party guests loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be extremely kid friendly however if you would like to increase the "heat" you easily could do so with chilis, spices etc. This is a great recipe and I urge you to try it.

What a hit!  It makes a ton - so I usually freeze half before cooking it - then when I want it again it is all set to pop in the oven. I also added jalopenos for extra heat.

The dip didn't go over so well.  I expected it to have more flavor but it still tasted pretty much like beans.  I would recommend maybe more taco seasoning and more hot pepper sauce.  I probably won't make this one again.

My family/friends LOVED this dip! But, I only used the recipe as starting point...left the sour cream out, added a small can of diced green chiles & only used half the amount of cheddar & jack (actually used pepper jack). Topped it w/ black olives & sliced jalapeno (as well as the cheeses) & when it came off of the bbq grill I then topped it w/ the sour cream & a bit more green onion & olives. Was the hit of our Mother's Day/Late Cinco de Mayo bbq & my husband's gonna use what's left to make burritos for lunch! Next time I think I'll try adding a layer of salsa to the top (under the final cheese layer) before baking, then with alittle sour cream AND guacamole on top it would make a warm & yummy layer dip...! I love recipes where the possibilities are endless! Just be warned that this recipe makes ALOT! And I do I mean ALOT!!!!!

I brought this to a potluck today at work, and people RAVED over it.  However, I thought it was very good, but not great.  I thought it needed more tang or something.  Also used Neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese & vegetarian refried beans to cut out the lard in "traditional" beans & to cut down a smidge on the fat this is loaded with.  Also added a ton of tabasco (yum!) and about 1/2 cup of chopped green onions.  I'd still like it spicier if it were just me.  Next time I'd like to try it with black refried beans, or a combo of both. Maybe toss in some green chiles & black olives, too.  COOKING TIP: Last night, I dumped all the ingredients in the crock pot and brought it to work with me this morning, putting it on low for 2.5 hours, and stirred it a couple times.  It came out just fine!  About 15 minutes before serving time, I topped with the remaining cheeses.  It disappeared in no time!  Thanks, will make again!

This dip was a hit on Fathers' Day when I made it for the family dinner.  (By the way, subbing plain yougurt for the sour cream didn't affect the outcome for the worse.) My husband was very careful to make sure he knew where the left overs were and can report that it does keep well for a day or two - it was all eaten by then!

This has a great flavor, and here's how to get a perfect amount of heat:  Use pepper jack instead of monterey jack, and McCormick's (or other) "Hot" taco seasoning mix.  I also used some extra pepper jack on top.  Yes, it does get gummy and crusty if it's been sitting out a while, but as long as there are people around, it won't last that long!  BTW, I made this with fat-free beans, sour cream and cream cheese, and low-fat cheddar cheese, and it still tasted fantastic and creamy.

This is a favorite at our house. I also put sliced olives on top with the cheese before baking.  I serve the dip in a large shallow ovenproof dish - always a big hit. I find it easier to heat the beans in a saucepan and mix in the cream cheese and sour cream while they are warm, then spoon into the baking dish.

This recipe was ahit from the begining.  I added a lot more hot sauce for more spice.  It also makes great burritos.  We took the rest that we had and wrapped in flour tortillas with salsa and it was great.

Great recipe. I made some changes ... I added a can of drained Rotel tomatoes, and I used the entire package of taco seasoning mix. When dip is done, I add grated cheddar cheese and green onions on top.

This recipe really is good!  I made this for my brothers and they thought that I was the best cook ever. Next time I think I will try topping with chopped tomatoes and sliced olives.  Very good recipe, thank you Julie!

Okay if you don't like this recipe then one of two things has happened. Either YOU did NOT follow instructions or YOU do NOT like beans. This has to be the best bean dip I have ever had. I didn't add anything extra, I just made it according to the directions and both I and my family just blew through this dip in a matter of minutes. 5 stars and two thumbs up.

This recipe is sooooooo simple!  We have a party house and we always prepare snacks and appetizers for our many parties.  When I first made this I had everyone asking for the recipe and I could just rhyme it off quickly because of how little ingredients are needed.  It was such a hit that I was TOLD the next time we have a party that I HAD to make it.  At the next get together, I had people asking when the Dip was coming and when it came out of the oven there were people lined up who had tried it and people who had only heard about it anxious for the big taste!  I recommend using hot taco seasoning and green chillis in a can if you like it with a kick.  I have also spread shredded lettuce and chopped seeded tomatoes to the top once baked.  Please give this recipe a try and I guarantee it will be on high rotation in your cookbook!

YUMMY! I made this for a party last nite and it was a HUGE hit! I did follow the advise of most reviews and added the whole pkg of taco seasoning and I cooked the dip without the cheese on top for 20 minutes to avoid rubbery cheese...I turned the oven off, added the cheese and stuck it back in for 10 minutes to melt the cheese and it was PERFECT!

Loved this bean dip, so good and easy to make.  I didn't change a thing.  I had this as a side dish for my son's first birthday, everyone loved it and my sister stopped by the next day for seconds.  "Do you have any of that bean dip left?" "Why yes I do...surprisingly."

This is really good! I did make some changes though - 1) made 1/2 the recipe and baked it in a pie dish - it makes a ton of dip, even halved! 2) sub 1 small can diced green chiles for green onions - I could see *topping* the baked dish with diced green onion, but putting it into the dip and baking it just did not appeal to me. 3) Although I halved the recipe, I still used 1/2 package taco seasoning. It would be bland otherwise. I also used a mexican cheese shredded blend instead of monterrey jack, but I think you could get away with any cheese (chihuahua would be amazing!)

Really good bean dip.  To please the men folk, I added some browned ground beef.  I also added one chopped jalapeno and used pepper jack cheese for extra spice.  I would suggest that if you don't have a big crowd, scale the recipe down a bit as I was able to fill up a 9 x 13 inch pan.

This recipe is okay - I guess bean dip just isn't for me!  In spite of the cheeses and spices, it still tasted a little bland.

I love this dip!  I make it with fat free cream cheese, fat free sour cream & fat free refried beans.  I use regular shredded 4 blend Mexican cheese & it is awesome.

Yummy!  I halved this recipe, and just made it for the heck of it one day.  I used all low-fat/no-fat ingredients, and it turned out fanstastic!  (My roomate who HATES the idea of low-fat cooking was raving about it...she was shocked when I told her it was low-fat!)  Excellent stuff, I know I'll be making this several times over!

I thought this was good.  I added a can or rotel before I baked it because it was a little too thick for me.  It turned out good, but I prefer the Clemons Family Bean Dip from this site, which has beans and hamburger.  Thanks for a good recipe but I will stick to the other, b.c. of personal preference.

My family loves this!  I add 8 oz. of Velveeta shredded (because I love cheese!), but the dip is perfect without it. I also bake 1/2 and freeze 1/2 for another day.  Great, great recipe!

First made this a little over a year ago for a Christmas party. Every function we've  had or attended since then, we've been asked to make "that bean dip".   Our 15 year old daughter eats it as a meal. It's good even cold!

This dip has a great flavor.  I prefer it a little hotter though.  Unless you have a party you better half this recipe because it makes a ton.

Yum! Hubby commented how this has so much more flavor than the more plain bean/cheese dips.  Cut the recipe in half and had more than enough for for five as an appetizer.  Separated into two small baking dishes.  Served with roasted garlic/black bean tortilla chips.

An ok recipe.  Perhaps I should have adjusted a bit more for personal preference - I found the dip way to "creamy" - there was no bite or kick from anything - need to add more cheddar, lessen the cream cheese, and chiles, etc.

This dip is great ! I added some japeleno peppers and a little more taco seasoning and used pepper jack cheese for a bigger kick. I didn't bake it with the cheese on top, but I did garnished it with shredded cheddar, pepper jackcheese, sliced black olives, green onion , and a little japeleno pepper on top when I served it and it was a hit ! Thank You for a wonderful new dip that I will be making alot because I have already been asked to make it again !!!

Mmmmm, mmmmm, good!  I got everything ready the night before and baked the following day. I used the refried beans with chipolte for extra kick.  This is one of the best appetizers I've had.  Will make again at my next Superbowl party and every other Saturday, also!  It's a keeper and addictive!  Thank you, Julie!!!!!

Flavorful bean dip, Julie. The folks at my flytying club loved it. The bowl was licked clean in less than an hour! I thought next time, I'd try using chili with beans instead of the refried for a slightly different version.

My brother-in-law said, "gee, this is horrible. You shouldn't let anyone else eat it. Instead, give it all to me!"   But in the time it took to say that, all the kids had eaten it up.

I'll make this recipe again and again... Quick, easy, delicious.

My friend gave me this recipe when she moved from NC (wouldn't share until she left)  We only add 1 can of bean dip and the whole pkg of taco seasoning.  Can be very creative with this and add additional things. This dip always will draw a crowd of men around it. So glad to see this recipe here!

Made this tonight, and we loved it! Took tips from other reviewers and doubled the amount of taco seasoning. Also used light sour cream, fat free refried beans, and Frank's hot sauce for the hot pepper sauce. YUM! Thanks!

We really enjoyed this as did all the people at the party we went to!  I did do this in the crockpot (after mixing all the ingredients with an electric hand mixer).  I did use 1 whole package of mild taco mix and it was NOT TOO MUCH!!!  Thanks for this great dip recipe J. Van Liere.

Wow... this has lots of flavor.  For those who like to play... I substituted Pepper Jack for all of the cheese, and I used a Spicy Taco Seasoning Pack.  It was FANTASTIC.   Also, this is a big 20 serving platter... be ready for left-overs!

This was really good. I used light cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. I added about 3.5 oz of green chilis and a little bit of cayenne pepper. I love green onion so I add a little extra. I only had one can of refried beans so I mashed a can of pinto beans. Added less cheese and replaced the monteray jack with pepper jack since it is all I had. This did make a ton when serving with a ton of apetizers but would have been gone easily if this was the main apetizer. Will make this again.

I used pinto refried beans (where you can see noticeable differences in color amongst the beans vs. the typical refried beans), a Taco Blend of shredded cheese (cheddar and jack) that has added spices, and then substituted a layer of pepper jack for the top.  I also added a little pickled jalapeno within the dip for little more flavor and heat and was generous with the green onions.  Nix the parsley - you really can't taste it if you make the same changes I did.  Next time I'm trying it with the chipotle-flavored beans!  I also made mine in the slow-cooker.  Just cooked on high for about an hour or so.  Came out great!

AWESOME! I made a few changes though. one can of traditional beans and one can of jalapeno beans. Then I roasted hatch chili's, 3 of them, and added them as well. And a few more drops of the Chili Sauce. And a bit more cheese on top. The dip was Awesome!

Great dip!  One of my family members who will not eat refried beans kept coming back for more.  Next time, I plan to try it with some cubed porcessed cheese and put it in the crock pot.  Will make again and again!
2010-I have made this countless times in the last 7 yrs and everyone loves it!!  I do a double batch in a crock pot for church fellowships and it is always eaten all up.   At home, a half-batch made in a 9"pie plate and heated in the microwave for about 5 min makes a yummy and quick addition to lunch.  Delicious!!!

Very yummy! Served it for Super Bowl Sunday. I added a small can of hot chiles for some kick. Next time I'm 1/2ing cream cheese and sour cream. It was a little richer than I wanted but that doesn't mean it wasn't a 5 star recipe.

I'M GIVING THIS FIVE STARS. I MADE IT WITH THE TACO SEASONING RECIPE FROM THIS SITE. SERVED WITH FLOUR TORTILLAS BRUSHED WITH EVOO AND SPRINKLED WITH CHILI POWDER, CUT INTO TRIANGLES AND BAKED AT 350 DEGREES FOR 12-15 MINUTES.

Great dip! Added sliced black olives and used fresh chopped cilantro instead of the parsley (just happened to have some). A few time savers: don't bother with letting the cream cheese soften; the mixer will blend it all anyway. Once it was mixed, I scooped all into a glass bowl, microwaved until warm, stirred, and then baked just until the cheese on top browned.

We really enjoyed this!  I tried it as I was making it and it did seem to need something...so I added half a bottle of taco sauce to the mix and it was EXACTLY what it needed.  It realy was delicious!

I've made this recipe more times than I can count. Everyone loves it. Can be served cold the next day as a dip. We also love to add it as a filling to burritos and enchiladas on Mexican nite at our home. Can be tweaked with whatever you feel like adding. Delicious!

Loved the recipe, made it for Super Bowl XLV and it was a "huge" hit here in Texas. I will definitely make it again and didn't change a single ingredient!

This was excellent. I did omit the parsley though. I used half of a batch of the Taco Seasoning (from Taste of Home) recipe from AR, and used pepper jack cheese on top. I will definitely be making this again and again!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover re-fried beans. I chose this one because I had all the ingredients on hand - except for the taco seasoning. I don't buy packaged mixes because of the high salt content and additives/preservatives. Instead I substituted a combination of cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and basil. I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream and only used half the cheese to cut down on fat and calories. It was still plenty creamy and cheesy for my taste.  I will definitely be making this again.

Everyone enjoyed this dip but most didn't think it was spicy enough.  I even added a small can of diced green chilis which added a nice taste.  Next time I would either use the "hot" taco seasoning or maybe add some jalapenos.  Good dip and it makes a huge amout - could definitely be halved for smaller crowds.  Thanks J. Van Liere.

This was pretty good.  I wish we could use 1/2 star ratings cause I would rate this 4.5 stars.  It tasted pretty good, but I think I'd prefer it as a layered dip than all of the ingredients mixed together.  It was super easy to make and had a nice flavor, but it wasn't visually appealing.

This was really good!  I love how easy it is to put together and the taste is great!  I know this sounds odd but use baby carrots instead of tortilla chips to use up the leftovers.  It is really good and lots healthier.

This is yummy.  I did halve the recipe, but used the entire amount of taco seasoning.  I used all low fat ingredients (beans, cheeses, sour cream).  I heated all of the ingredients together in the microwave and then kept the dip warm in my 2 qt. slow cooker.

Soooo Good!  I made this for a party and doubled the recipe.  After mixing it all up and putting the dip in a 9 x 13 pan I was having second thoughts about doubling the recipe... but to my surprise at the end of the night there was only enough dip left for me to have a few bites.  I did not add the parsley and I added jalapenos.  It was a hit an everyone wanted the recipe!

I tried this recipe tonight and my husband and I both loved it!!  I didn't have any green onion so I subsituted white onion and added a clove of minced garlic.  I also added additional taco seasoning and added to both the cream cheese mixture and the refried beans.  I used more hot sauce and added a little cayenne and also used monterey jack with jalepeno peppers.  I cut the recipe in half and I will be making this again very soon.  I highly recommend this.

This is a good bean dip for my friends who don't like really spicy food. Next time I will use Jack with jalapenos instead of plain Jack for the cheese. I also will probably throw in a habanero or 2 or 3 jalapenos since we like spicier foods.

I have now made this twice. The first time the texture was great, the taste was good, perfect for those who do not like "hot stuff", I just made it again (1/2 the recipe, it makes a ton!!) i still used 1/2 a pack of taco seasoning, 1/4 cup chilies, and about a cup of chipotle salsa and it was SOOOOO GOOOOD!! I love that it is so creamy (i mix it all up w/a mixer, my hand and a spoon just wasn't cutting it!!) will definately be making many many more times, oh also used about twice the amount of cheese recommended (cheddard/montery jack mix) thanks for the fantastic recipe :O)

This is the best bean dip ever. Everytime I go to a party I am expected to bring it. It is best to keep it hot though, but it will probably be gone before it cools down anyway.

I just whipped up my second batch and added about a 1/4 cup of chopped jalapenos for a little extra spice.  Turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe but I adapted it for cooking in the microwave for a quick snack. Just need to cook it for 3 minutes and stir well. Extremely yummy and nice when watching TV and snacking.

This was really too rich for me, however my husband enjoyed it. Be warned that even a half batch makes quite a lot (more than 4 people can consume).

I use Frito Bean Dip instead of refried beans and add sliced olives, no onions or parsley.  Always a hit.

I make this bean dip for parties quite a bit, and it's always a hit.  The first time a particular friend ate it, he loved it so much he called it "Bean Diggity"!  Needless to say, bean diggity has been made for many get-togethers since then.  I pretty much keep the recipe as it is.

It was good for a bean dip!  I think I was just expecting a different flavor, but the refried bean taste dominated.  Not bad though.

This dip had a pretty good flavor to it.  My husband, who usually doesn't care for bean or cheese dips even liked it.  I wouldn't say it's the best I ever had, but it was a little different from the ordinary and pretty darn good!

This bean dip was very good. I followed the instructions until I realized I my sour cream was expired. I mixed 1 cup of milk with 1 Tb lemon juice to substitute and the dip was very good. It made a large quantity so I saved some and froze it. Hopefully it will keep well in the freezer.

It's good but pretty bland and I used a lot more hot sauce than recommended.  Also, it calls for way too much cheese and as a cheese lover I can't believe that I'm saying this but I would cut it by at least half.

I made the Hot Bean Dip but like some others made a few changes. I did use the fat-free cream cheese, the fat-free sour cream, fat-free refried beans, a whole package hot taco seasoning mix, forgot the 5 drops hot pepper sauce, I did add one small can of jalepenos', spread the taco sauce on top before the cheeses. Otherwise I used everything else as the recipe called for. It was a huge success. Will for sure be making this recipe again and had others ask for it as well. Thank you, thank you for the recipe!!

This was yummy and the recipe makes a LOT of dip.  I will definitely make it again, but I will do what a previous reviewer suggested - make the recipe and then heat it up in smaller batches.

I changed it only a little bit.   Instead of taco seasoning, I added some chipotle powder because I like the spicy smokiness of it.  I didn't put any parsley in and used 1/3 fat cream cheese.  I put it all in a small crock pot and it was great!  Everyone loved it...thanks!

I've been using this recipe for years and it's always a huge hit. I go up and down with the hot sauce depending on the group and rarely put the chives in (as I never seem to remember them) but it's always AWESOME!

Delicious! I made this for a party, and it disappeared. I did substitute a small can of chopped green chiles for the green onions, and I omitted the parsley (ran out) and it was fantastic. I will make this again and again.

So easy to make and a MAJOR crowd-pleaser. Because I wanted to keep the dip warm for several hours, I combined all the ingredients and put them in a slow cooker rather than bake as directed.  Worked great!  This recipe is fantastic as written, but also very easy to flavor-up by adding red pepper flakes, a dash of cayenne, jalapenos, etc..

So tasty!! I made it for a party and it was devoured in under an hour. I got so many compliments. I even substituted light cream cheese, light sour cream, and low fat refried beans, it was still delicious.

Wow what a big lot of dip this makes.  I used my big oval glass "casserole" dish, and it fit just fine.  It has a great flavor, and I was inspired by one of the photos to make a cool design with mutlicolored peppers on top.  I ended up topping it with some pepperjack, which melted nicely. My guests all spooned out the dip onto their plates, so there was no problem with the cheese topping breaking their chips.  You can do this recipe as it's written and have a hit.  Everybody loved it.  Best of all, with all that dip, there's some left for me :) ***Update 12/19/08 have made this twice more and EVERY TIME, people rave and ask for the recipe!  my  coworker just called and was out shopping and this was her "GO TO" recipe for a potluck Christmas party!  honestly, you will not be disappointed!!

Good and easy dip.  I recommend cutting the recipe in half because it makes a ton.  All so I used hot and spicy taco seasoning to add a little extra zip!

I made a small batch of this dip today to try out before hosting a dinner party in a few days. My husband and I both really liked this dip...I asked him to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best...he said an 8. Only thing we'd change about it is possibly add more hot sauce to make it more spicy.
We will be having this at our next party for sure.

I made this exactly as written. We thought it was bland and the guests didn't eat much of it. I ended up throwing over half of it away. It just tasted like salt, cheese and beans. It wasn't interesting at all.

This was a great dip to serve with "scoop"-style tortilla chips. I used about half as much cheese as the recipe called for (a shredded Mexican blend) and mixed it into the dip before baking. Also, I thought it needed a bit more hot sauce (try Frank's Red Hot) and used about 2 teaspoons. My husband and father-in-law loved it!

yum...i used a can of black refried beans along with half a can of regular that i had leftover.  didn't have any taco seasoning so i used a couple drops of habanero sauce along with the red hot.  used a white onion instead of green and omitted the parsely.  i also added a can of diced tomatoes with chipotle for a bit more flavor, and used some varieties of shredded cheese that i had on hand to use them up.  cooked it in a crock pot on low for about 3 hours and then added taco seasoned shredded cheese on top which melted in 15 minutes.  5 stars for the idea, which i found using ingredient search to use up my leftovers.  i don't think people should change a bunch of ingredients and then give a bad rating (makes no sense..)  peace and love ~  jewels in the keys

Husband went crazy over this! Seriously, after his first mouthful, I could hardly get the bowl away from him. I made it with Neufchâtel cream cheese, Chipotle-flavored refried beans, and I didn't bother with the parsley. Delicious. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks, Julie!

This is a good basic bean dip.  Here's what I did based on others' reviews: I took out 1/3 of the cream cheese and added a whole packet (1 oz) of taco seasoning.  The texture was creamy, but not so much so.  I wish I hadn't added the whole packet of taco seasoning because it's rather salty.  This is easily remedied though with the addition of shredded lettuce and freshly diced tomatoes.  I can easily see this being used as burrito filling too.

excellent! who would not like this cheesy, yummy, warm, gooey concoction of flavor.  Even when it got cold it was good!  I didn't have parsley or chives, and i will add next time, but it still turned out great.  everyone at the party devoured it - i kicked it up a notch with about 8 dashes of hot sauce.  thanks for what will be a STAPLE to bring to parties.

Overall this was a good dip that went over well at my Super Bowl party.  Personally, I am a big fan of refried beans and felt that the bean flavor was overwhelmed by all the dairy.  I will make this recipe again, but I will definitely cut the cream cheese and sour cream in half.

Prepared this last night for company.  Everyone raved.  I added some jalopena slices under the top cheese layer.  I also sprinkled some of the leftover taco seasoning on top prior to baking it - it made it look pretty.  We will do this one again!

I modified this recipe to suit my own tastes. I left out the hot pepper sauce, onions, and refried beans. Instead I used 1 can of light red kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans (mashed together with a hand mixer into a paste.) I also added 1 lb of ground beef, 2 cloves of garlic (minced and lightly cooked with the beef), and mozzarella cheese in addition to the cheddar and monterey jack. From suggestions here, I also added the whole pack of taco seasoning. Delicious!

It makes a ton, so it would be perfect for a party, but I plan to freeze the remainder.

I have used this site for a very long time and have never written a review. That being said I had to for this bean dip because it is my go to and most requested for any get together. The only difference I made to the recipe, was what other reviews recommend,  using the whole pack of taco seasoning for the 2 cans. Also instead of putting the cheese on top I put it in because it dose put a layer on top and is better for dipping when it is all mixed in. As for everything else, I use whatever I have (like cheese ect.) and it always turns out perfect! I have followed this to a T, but since I've made it for years now and have followed it to a T, these r my recommendations. In my opinion you can not go wrong with this dip.

Really unappetizing looking but very tasty.  I added 1 finely diced jalapeno per another similar recipe and way more than 5 dashes of hot sauce, and it was really mild.  I left the parsley out completely.  I like that this recipe includes some cheese in the dip and some on the top.  Next time I will cut this in half as my parties are usually for smaller groups.  I only used 1 1/2 can of black refried beans and it was totally beany enough.  I may even cut to one can next time and see how that goes.  Oh, and I used the whole package of taco seasoning.  Good stuff, thanks for sharing.

This is a pretty good recipe as a start. I had to add a bit more flavor though. You have to be careful not to overcook so the cheese on top stays creamy. I've been making it for every pay because they love it so much. Making it for Super Bowl today.

wow yummy! Made this for New Years and it was a hit! I added Jalpenos to half for those that like spice and I had some left over bacon also put on the half with the peppers, so there was a meat free side

Made to go with chicken enchiladas for a party.  Lots of compliments on the bean dip. Followed others suggestions, and mixed with a mixer.  Made is smooth and creamy.  :)

YUM!! I made a simple version of this, with beans, cream cheese, sour cream, a pack of taco seasoning, and shredded cheese. It was really easy and very creamy and tasty. I'm getting ready to make it again for a New Year's Eve party.

Very good but needs more seasoning....I used taco seasoning and put extra hot sauce in, as suggested.  I should have chopped jalapeños to add to the mix.  Kind of bland as written, but very good anyway...we just like more spice!  Beans take a lot of the spice out after cooking so make it hot if you like HOT!

This bean dip is truly incredible. I took other peoples advice and used the entire package of taco seasoning mix. I didn't have any of the hot pepper sauce or dried parsley on hand, so I just omitted those. In place of the Monterey Jack cheese,(our local store did not have it), I used Pepper Jack cheese. My husband ate his dip in a burrito and my daughter and I just crushed some tortilla chips in it and ate it like that. Needless to say, every last bit of it was devoured. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe! :)

Tasty, but I used a whole pouch of taco seasoning, and I still thought it could use more flavor.  Also, there was far too much cheese in this.  I will cut the cheese in half next time I make it!

Very good hot dip and was enjoyed but everyone.  I cut the recipe in half and it generously served 4 hungry people with a little left over.  The recipe was very adaptable - I used fajita seasoning mix and a taco cheese mix as substitutes as that's what I had on hand.  Used tortilla chips and Triscuits for dipping.  It's a keeper in our house!

Had people over for a Mexican dinner last night and I made this for the first time. It was AMAZING not sure how anyone could not like this. I put thai peppers on top and served as a side dish. I only used about 12 oz. of cheese instead of 16 oz as called for and it still had plenty of cheese. Everyone loved it!!

Delicious and easy!  A big hit and one of my new go-to dips.  This makes A LOT of dip.  I froze half of it (before putting the cheese on the top).  I wouldn't change anything except maybe adding more taco seasoning and hot sauce to your liking.  Enjoy!

This dip is incredible! I've made it for our New Year's Eve party and hope that will be a success. I used homemade refried beans and homemade taco mix from this site. I just added extra fine chopped jalapenos and instead of monterey used gouda (no monterey cheese in Germany :). I have already tried and I just love it!!! DH as well. Let's see how the other guests are going to react. This is a rather uncommon dip over here.
Anyway, thank you very much for this recipes.

Concept of this recipe is great! Delicious too! My family loved it. I did change things, layered in this order....

1) 1 package of cream cheese mixed with 1/2 package of cheesy taco seasoning
2) 1 can of refried beans mixed with 1 can of chilis
3) small layer of hot taco sauce
4) mixed taco/Mexican shredded cheese and cheddar

Bake at 400 degrees, for 20 minutes

5) top with more hot taco sauce and pico de gallo.

YUM! Certainly making this again!!

I am slow in reviewing but I make this all the time for gatherings. I change it up accordingly sometimes jalapenos or green chiles or extra spices but I never have to bring any home and it makes a lot. Easy to adapt!

I made this dip for my great aunt's 90th birthday party. I made my own refried beans the day before in the crockpot and then proceeded to fix the rest of the recipe the day of the party. It sure didn't last long!!!  Everyone raved about it, and I will certainly make it again.  I didn't change the recipe one bit. Lovely!

Very yummy.  We make this all of the time.  Very easy to halve the ingredients and make for a smaller crowd.

Great for a quick appetizer. I added chopped green chilies to the cheese and sour cream mixture and used fat free refried, 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and light sour cream...no one knows the difference.

This is a great party dip that people who can't tolerate heat can enjoy.  The only thing I did differently was mix all the cheeses right in, rather than leaving it on the top. Thanks for the recipe, my family (especially my baby brother) enjoyed it

used buttermilk instead of sour cream (a bit less) in a pinch and didn't have mozzerella, would have been even better for sure! if you dont have hot sauce, just use a bit extra taco season & cayenne. soooo good, will probably make new years eve!

This dip is great! People devour it when we have family gatherings or just when I make it on a  Sunday for a great football snack. If you like very spicy dip add more hot pepper sauce, otherwise the recipe is perfect as written!

This was delicious! I was making it for only 4 people (one of which is a vegetarian) so I halved the recipe. I also left off the green onions because I didn't have any on hand and used Taco shredded cheese. I will certainly be making this again! My guests requeted the recipe.

I think the ingredients to this recipe sound OK at best.  I am very concerned when someone rates themselves "expert" and then uses (or recommends) canned refried beans or any canned beans at all in any recipes.  Most "expert" cooks would only recommend using beans from dry. Also the taco seasoning mix.  So called experts would go ingredient by ingredient and not use the envelope for seasoning, so for that reeason I would rate this as a very, very low quality recipe.

Great bean dip. As others have mentioned, adding the whole pack of taco seasoning helps. I also add a thin layer of taco sauce on the top and then sprinkle the cheese over it. Very yummy!

This bean dip was a hit!  The ingredients listed are fine however I added jared jalapenos to the bean mixture before baking.  I also added more cheese then recommended to the top.  There were only 8 people at the party and the entire dish was gone in about an hour!  Thanks for this great recipe.

Awesome!  I have been looking for this recipe for quite sometime!!!  I have made this dozens of times since finding it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly and have had nothing but rave reviews!!! Thanks so much for sharing it.  The only changes I have made was to try different cheeses, like pepperjack or a light mexican queso.  Thanks again!

Double thumbs up from all of us. Made a layer of salsa (half recipe of D's Famous Salsa) and used one recipe Bill Echol's taco seasoning (minus the salt) for the packet called for. We all attacked and were happy. I used FF sour cream, 2% cheese and low cal cream cheese, just for less guilt. GREAT for a rainy movie day at home.

I had left over pinto beans which I warmed and then mashed (I do not like canned refried beans!).  I added the entire package taco seasoning and I forgot the parsley so I add it on top.  Also, I sprinkled shredded cheese on top AFTER it came out of the oven instead of before so that it didn't have that tough cheese layer on top.  Added a little extra cumin and chili powder.  This dish was a HIT at a party!!!

Made this for New Years and it was a hit!  I added a few more drops of hot sauce cuz we like a little kick.  I may add diced jalapenos or green chiles next time as well.  I will definitely be making this again, it was a bunch of cheesy goodness!!!  :)

This dip is awesome!  I have made it several times and it's always a big hit!  I omitted the parsley and green onions and added a whole lot more drops of Tabasco.  We like it spicy!  Other than that I follow the recipe to the T.  Thanks for the great recipe J. Van Liere!

This is a GREAT recipe on its own.  But I make the refried beans from scratch (not as hard as it sounds, folks) and add a couple ingredients of my own to add spice and flavor; namely, diced tomatoes with green chilies and extra dashes of Green Tobasco.  I also overdue the cheese mixed in cuz I love cheese.  This is some good stuff and while it does make a lot, I could eat it all myself!!

Awesome! I only had one can of refried beans so I used that and a can of white beans. I replaced the sour cream with plain yogurt and left out the onions. Threw everything in the food processor and wow it makes a ton. Everyone loved it.

this recipe was excellent.  I did not add the hot sauce, green onion, or parsley, but did add one can of rotel.  I just stired the cheeses in and served in the crockpot to keep it hot.  Great party dip!

Great recipe! I made it for company last weekend (and Boxing Day weekend), and not one ounce was left! I did halve the recipe the second time I made it, I found that the original recipe made A LOT of dip.  I made a few modifications to the recipe. I substituted fresh cilantro for the dried parsley. I added a 1/4 cup of Tobasco.  I added finely diced onion, sweet peppers and mushrooms.   And, I added the cheese to the top about 5 minutes before it was done. I hope that you enjoy this as much as everyone else did!

this bean dip is awesome! i made it for the first time about three years ago and i've been making it for every occasion possible since then. i get requests for it all the time, in fact, sometimes we have get togethers just so we can eat some bean dip. one year at a party i had to make four batches of dip, so i could space it out throughout the night because i knew it would disappear each time i took one out of the oven! thank you so much for posting it!

I took this to a church BBQ. It was such a hit that I didn't get any when it was my turn to stand in line! I added more hot sauce though! Also Instead of mixing everything together I layered it to make it nicer looking.

I scaled in half and had enough dip for a 10" square pan which is plenty unless you have a huge group.  I thought this was a good basic bean dip.  My teenage boys really liked it.  I used Taco Seasoning I from this site which I think has much better flavor than packaged seasoning.

Fantastic! Made it for a tailgating event and it was a hit. However, be forewarned, it makes a LARGE batch. Added some diced tomatoes and didn't need as much cheese. Overall it's great!

this was yum!  I cut it down to only 5 servings (using only half a can of refried beans), stirred in all up in a microwave bowl, put in in the microwave for about 3 minutes and ate it on soft tortilla shells, like burritos.  SO GOOD!

I made this with canned black beans that I had mashed - (food processing would probably work better).  It was better than the regular dip.  It was gone within 2 hours! UPDATE: Mix a can of refried black beans and a can of regular refried beans. I get requests for this ALL the time!  Serve with Kirkland's tortilla stips - we like the quality and taste of this chip the best.  We put leftovers in burritos (w/ spanish rice, chicken, beef, etc) and grill them for lunch or dinner.

I omitted the parsley and the green onions because I didn't have them, but added onion powder.  I typically don't use prepackaged taco seasoning, so I used approx. 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, ground cumin, chili powder, paprika and ground red pepper.  I added a good dash of cayenne, and it was awesome.  My boyfriend and my 3 yr old loved it, and I thought it is a keeper! (I cut the recipe in half)

Our family loves it.  We've been making it for a year now.  We make it with 1/2 the cheese in & 1/2 the cheese on top, or play around w/the ratio.  You can get fancy with your cheese blends too.  We no longer use the Parmesan.  The flavor was too unusual for us.  This even re-warms great in the microwave.

Was very good, however, after a few bites, the refried beans were overpowering. Next time will probably cut the amount of refried beans added. I also did not have any montery jack cheese on hand, and used just sharp chedder.

This was delicious. I made 1/2 the recipe and it made plenty to fit into a glass pie plate. I also didn't use quite as much shredded cheese as I thought it was cheesy enough. Very tasty!

This recipe at first was very bland. I added some whole garlic cloves to the mixture and it had more flavor the next day. I will make this again but I would probably add more spice of some kind.

I had high hopes for this recipe and was disappointed.  It was just OK.  I made it for our Super Bowl party and there are leftovers still in my fridge - over half of it is left.  People seemed to enjoy the standby classic Rotel cheese dip more.

Love it! I used 1 t. dried cilantro instead of the parsley & reg. onion instead of green onions. (what I had on hand) I also halved the recipe since I was just making it for my family for football watching purposes. Speaking of football, WAY TO GO, LONGHORNS!!! We HOOKED 'EM!!! Vince, we'll miss you....

This was pretty good as bean dips go.  I left out the hot sauce and parsley, replacing it with some thick salsa.  Also added a pound of ground beef.  After browning the beef, I threw everything in the crockpot (as someone else suggested) and let it heat up.  It turned out pretty good.  Be careful if you use the crock, however.  After it warms, the dip tends to curdle a little with all of the dairy products in it.  Watch it closely.

Next time I make this recipe I will substitute the parsley for cilantro.  I think that would improve the flavor.  I reheated some of this leftover "dip" this morning and used it as a filling for a burrito.  No one knew that it was last nights "dip". lol

I made this for the first time and brought it to the office today - everyone LOVED it - I've already given the recipe to several folks!!  I used an entire pkg of taco mix and also added:  1 1/4# browned ground beef w/onions, 1 can green chilies, and a splash of salsa.  It makes a bunch, but everyone keeps going back for more!

This was an awesome dip!!! Everyone loved it. I didnt add the green onions or hot sauce as kids would be eating it. It still turned out great, I even had guests ask for the recipe. I used reduced fat cream cheese, sour cream, and no fat beans. I also added another 8 oz of shredded cheese. Will definately be making agian.

Yum!  I added lots more hot pepper sauce and some diced jalapenos to spice it up, then threw it all in the crock pot.  Very tasty and a good recipe to play around with.  I don't often follow a recipe without adding or omitting a few ingredients, so this was no exception.

I followed the recipe almost exactly (I added a whole package of taco seasoning for a little more spice). It tasted like cream cheese with a hint of beans. Nobody ate it....

I made this recipe for my super bowl party.  I got a lot of positive feedback.  I also used a full packet of taco seasoning and I added some chili pepper spices and used mexican shredded cheese.  It made alot so Im going to brown up some ground beef and make burritos with the leftovers.

Excellent bean dip! I make it all the time and it never lasts long.  I use an entire package of taco seasoning and use only shredded cheddar cheese.  My husband's friends love it, especially when he takes it for tailgating!

This was very good--I typically take a dish to parties and this was a hit at the pre-season game party. I made it in a crock pot, and blended all the ingredients together. It was so good the host saved the little cup that was left! Thank you for a good recipe! I added some jalepeno' slices to it, and a whole pack of taco seasoning. I also substituted 1 can of seasoned chili beans to make it thicker and more hearty. They loved it--rave reviews! Made again today for my husband--it disappeared at the party! thanks!

This was pretty good.  It seemed a little thick so I added about one-quarter cup of Pace Thick and chunky salsa.  Also, since it is a mexican type dip I added cilanto in place of the parsley.  The only real complaint I have about this recipe is too much cheese.  Next time I will only put about one half of the amount of cheese that the recipe called for.

This dip is amazing and SO easy!!  If you’re not serving that big of a group, you can 1/2 the recipe as it makes quite a bit. I did that the second time I made it, however, the family was sad to not have leftovers thx next day, it’s really delicious.

I think the sour cream taste was too strong for this recipe. 
Plus we like spicy foods, I had to add jalapenos to make it more likable for us.

This was a very good base dip which can be modified to suite individual taste. I made it per the recipe, but did find it watery like another reviewer mentioned and my family thought it could use more flavor. It is definitely a keeper that I will modify next time. Thank you!

The only changes I made were to omit the green onion and add garlic powder. In my opinion, this is very close to what is served at a Mexican restaurant.  The flavor is great and the consistency is smooth. A perfect dip for tortilla chips.  I was planning on making a bean dip from scratch using cooked pinto beans and the whole nine yards, but now I'll probably just stick to this recipe.  The only thing I will say is that it's a rather large amount, 13x9 pan, of dip.. so, if you're not making for a large family or gathering, you may want to half the recipe. That said, I think it will be excellent reheated for a snack.

I make this often and it’s always loved.... I adlib when I don’t have all the ingredients on hand or... like the other day I wanted it in a hurry... When I’m in Mexico I’ll use the refried beans with the chorizo... and instead of taco seasoning will just add slightly drained canned salsa as well as tinned jalapeños (chopped fine) along with the onions, sour cream and cheeses... I also just popped it into the microwave to heat.. then taste test and adjust ...

Bland as listed. Would benefit from more taco seasoning or a layer of salsa. I mixed refried beans with taco seasoning, then added cream cheese/sour cream layer. I only used 1 can of beans. I ended up adding salsa after done to give more flavor. Can’t go wrong with this much cheese in my book, just needs more spice.

I added ground beef that I seasoned with half the packet of taco seasoning (the other half went directly into the mixture of ingredients)  and I used diced green chilies rather then green peppers. Otherwise I kept it the same.

Very good for new ears party.  4 stars because it was (in miy opinion) bland before baking.  I added more onion powder, paprika and cumin.

Note: With most recipes you can substitute with yogurt for sour cream and I want to know the difference. Not in this recipe! The acidity from the yogurts split the cream cheese mixture, and after baking it was all cuddled and yucky looking. That’s not to say that we didn’t eat it and enjoy it regardless of looks, but next time I think I’ll either double the cream cheese or stick to the recipe with sour cream.

I made this just as written except the fact that I cooked my beans from scratch. If at all possible I always try to do that. Super easy recipe and all but 2 tablespoons were eaten. People all wanted the recipe .  It is always my go to recipe for happy guests. Try this recipe. It’s a keeper!
Good with corn chips also.

This is a real party pleaser and pretty good. I only added a few extra spices for the occasion and my palate. Rich, so a little goes a long way. A big casserole was mostly empty by the time the party was over. Lots of compliments.

I have made this dip numerous times, often using what I have on hand.  Always a HUGE hit.  I've taken it to functions and always someone wants the recipe.  As written, it makes a TON.  I usually 1/2 the recipe and still have plenty for a family get together/gathering.  I have found it freezes really well though.  I usually also add some salsa to the mix too and I think that really adds to the dip.  As others mentioned, a small can of green chilies are great to add too.  I make my own taco seasoning (from this site) and usually use at least 1.5 -2x the amount in the original recipe--I just keep tasting until I am satisfied.  Finally, I have used plain yogurt instead of or 1/2 and 1/2 with the sour cream and found that to be very good too.  I have also used black bean refried beans or regular and both are great.   I strongly recommend trying this recipe.  A big favorite with both my kids (9 and 12 ) too!

I added some salsa & some green onion tops for more color/flavor.  I also mix all the cheese in so it doesn't become hard to dip as it cools.  I experimented w/ some crushed bacon on top the last 5 min., & my family loved it.  



2/9/18:  I've started topping it w some crushed bacon & then cooking it 5 more min.  The bacon adds really great smoky flavor & crunch!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe since I'm taking it to a party.  Probably didn't need to though, it makes A LOT.   Added 1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes and chilis (drained) and used the full packet of taco seasoning as others mentioned, but other than that followed the recipe.   Will definitely make this again.

Amazing! I took this to a family potluck and barely went home with any leftovers. I have a huge family, so I made 1 1/2 x's the recipe. I added about 1 tablespoon of chipotle hot sauce, 2 packages of taco seasoning, and used hot monterey jack cheese and cheddar, but didn't add any cheeses to the top. My oldest daughter stayed for the bon fire and said they were still raving about how good the bean dip was over s'mores. :)

This is very good bean dip! I made it exactly like the directions state and my family enjoyed it. We all agree that it needs more heat. The only changes I would make would be to add A LOT more hot sauce.

Quick and easy to make.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and put chopped fresh jalapeno's on top prior to cooking.  I sprinkled the cheese on top after cooking and let the cheese melt on its own.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Not bad. I cut the recipe about a third so I wouldn't have too much. A few changes though for personal flavor: added in about 3tsp of some cilantro paste, a dash of lime juice, threw in some chopped black olives & used chipotle seasoning instead of taco seasoning to cut the sodium. My family loved it! Definitely bringing it to the next party I go to

Made this for Cinco De Mayo.  The people at my office raved about it.  I used chopped red onions instead of green onions and 1- 8 ounce bag of cheese.  I used a mix of Monterey Jack and Cheddar.  I also forgot to add the dried parsley.  Will definitely make this again!

Things I changed or added: 
shredded chicken (boil a chicken breast for about 12 min then remove and use two forks to shred), one tomato chopped, garlic powder, onion powder, finely chopped white onion,  FRESH parsley (dried is too bland), finely diced green chilies (found at Indian stores). I did measure cheese just added handfuls and did not add Frank's Red Hot because I added the hot chilies and I didn't add green onions. I also only used 1 can refried and the other can use whole cannellini beans

What we thought of dip: very tasty! Of course we added our own ingredients to tweak it but overall this recipe was a good backbone

Very easy to make, just make sure to soften the cream cheese in the microwave.  I used an electric mixer, made my life easier mixing everything together.  This was the first time I made it, everyone loved it.  Like other reviewers mentioned, I recommend adding some spicy chiles to make it more spicy.  I saw guests and me myself were pouring some salsa on top of it.  Lastly, you need to serve some on a plate because if you try to scoop some directly out of the pyrex with chips, the chips will break.

Loved the recipe, but for our family, we prefered some extra zing, easily fixed by adding some minced jalapeños on top. Would make again.

I took this to a recent church function and everyone loved it!  The cream cheese gave it a great flavor.  The only thing I changed was I decreased the parsley to just one tablespoon as I'm not a huge parsley fan.  A must-add to your dip list!

I made this recipe as directed. It was very bland and tasteless. I should have added red pepper flakes, more taco seasoning and hot sauce. Maybe I can put this in a tortilla and make it into a burrito since I have almost all of it left after the superbowl.

Overall taste was good, but I agree with other reviewers about the top cheese layer being a problem -- it was like a mass of  cement.  Even if you tried to serve with a spoon, the cheese wouldn't break up.  Maybe the top should only be jack, and very little of it, added at the end of the baking time.

Excellent dip, no problem at all emptying a bowl of this. It's easy, great ingredients and simple to make, which is exactly what is needed in a dip for a group, without having to go to a lot of trouble and buy a lot of new items.

Made as a side to our beef soft tacos tonight. This dip left me a tad bit underwhelmed. I know it's not a gourmet recipe, but just felt it lacked something. I used homemade pintos which I refried myself. I followed the popular suggestion to use the entire seasoning packet. I used plain greek yogurt in lieu of the sour cream and used a tad less cream cheese than called for, as I only had about 6 oz. Left out the green onion, as I didn't have any, but did eat mine with some finely diced raw onion. I'll try this again with some tweaks (homemade taco seasoning to taste, and more cream cheese than sour cream) and see how that goes. Overall, it was just ok for us.

This is a real crowd pleaser! I added ground beef, and I put all of the cheese into the dip instead of topping it with some  to avoid a cheese layer on top that would break chips. Will make again and again! Absolutely delish.

I used this to adhere a soft taco to a crunchy taco and filled my super shell with fajita-style onion, red bell pepper, and mushrooms, rice (cooked with broth), black beans(cooked with lime), lettuce, cheese, heirloom tomatoes, cilantro, green onion, and sour cream. It was delicious, filling, and made a lot of food! I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough.

This was a hit! Next time, I will not put any cheese on top, but mix it all in. And use only 8 oz of cheese. It formed a gooey, hard crust on top that was impossible to dip with a chip. But the taste was outstanding! A keeper.

This was delicious! I used the whole packet of taco seasoning and more hot sauce (love spicy). It was a big hit at the party I brought this to. It made a huge pan of dip and took longer to bake than the recipe said but I will definitely be making it again

This was really good! I was a little worried about the cream cheese, but it's not an obvious flavor at all, it just makes it creamier. We made it spicier than the recipe calls for, just because we like spicy. Added taco sauce to it, just because we had it to use up. We left the cheese off the top, because I didn't want that cheese shell, but that's just personal taste. And I heated it in the microwave, which worked great! This recipe makes a TON, but leftovers aren't a bad thing. :)

I made it for our card group's snack night, and it got great comments.  I didn't have refried beans on hand or green onions, so I substituted a can of Chili w/beans, put thru the processor, and chopped yellow onion. That may have made the dip a little thinner, but was very good.  I'll definitely make it again, using original recipe. to compare the results.

Turned out really good! But of course everyone likes to add their own twist, I added a cheese mix of Colby and cheddar and added a bunch of chopped red onion to mine and did not do the top layer of cheese, husband and kids loved it!

Very,very good and it makes A LOT!!!!  Just a couple of very minor changes. I used a full pack of mild taco seasoning, I also used about double the green onions, also made in a 9x13 dish.

This is so so so good. Even my picky kid loved it. It's even better as reheated leftovers. I agree with the most helpful review - use the whole package of taco seasoning (mild). Delicious!

This went over well with my women's group.  It makes a lot for a party.  Wasn't anything super special but it is easy and liked.  Used almost whole package of seasoning and additional green onions.  Still could use a bit more flavor if you ask me.

I didn't make this recipe so I can't justify a 5/5, but I am making a bean dip for a house party and needed a recipe that had baking instructions without meat, as all other bean dips apparently have meat and there's no step in baking the beans and cheese. This was extremely helpful in that regards, so an easy 4/5. If I'm ever adventurous, I will try this recipe and adjust my rating accordingly.

This is very good!  The only thing that I would change is that I would have put on the top cheese after I took it out of the oven.  It made the cheese hard to get thru.  Awesome recipe!!

Amazing dip! My new go to recipe for feeding a crowd! Fixed it exactly by recipe for family, it was a huge hit. Doubled the recipe and served it along side taco stack ups for the youth group of about 30 teens at church. I did alter it a bit and still a hit. I left out the parsley, didn't have any on hand and totally forgot the hot sauce also used minimum cheddar cheese on top, served it at room temp. The teens were eating by the bowlfuls!
When I fix it for my family again I think I will top it with fresh chopped tomatoes, avocado, and green onions and maybe some black olives just to kick it up a notch!
Such an easy dip to prepare too - open some packages and cans, chop some green onions, mix, top with cheese, heat and serve with chips! I will make this again and again!

It is more like a cheese dip with some beans in it. Not at all what I was hoping for.

I used 2 cans of El Paso fat free spicy beans - eliminated the taco seasoning and the hot sauce - cooked on stove top instead of oven then put in slow cooker as I was taking the dip to a party - I have also used plain refried beans and substituted 8 oz. of pepper jack cheese for the Monterey Jack (again, no hot sauce) - without the taco seasoning you get the full benefit of the bean & cheese flavor!

Yummy! Used all of my taco seasoning and pepper jack in place of the Monterey jack,  but left everything else the same. This was well received by everyone.  Will make again!

Based on the reviews I decided to make this dip for a tailgate lunch at my work. I have to say I should have stuck with something I knew. As others suggested I used the whole package of taco mix and hot sauce to ensure flavor, but it created an unusual taste of dry spices and no true depth of flavor. It was not a hit. Multiple people requested the recipe for my second dish but none for this dip. Will not make again.

This definitely makes a lot of dip; a medium bowl doesn't cut it! I used a whole packet of taco mix, added a small can of diced chilies and put most of the shredded cheese into the dip leaving a 1/2 cup or so for the top which I put on for the last 10 minutes of heating. LEFTOVERS!! Let me count the ways: enough for another party, then stuffing for enchiladas, then stuffing for breakfast burritos with an egg...This was good, but next time I will only make HALF a batch!

This is a really good base recipe.  I added extra hot sauce and mild enchilada sauce to boost the flavor as well as taking into account the other suggestions of putting the entire packet of taco seasoning into the mix.  It is quite flavorful without being too spicy.

Surprisingly, no one in my family cared for this dip.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just seemed too rich with competing flavors.  We typically like this type of dip, so I'm perplexed that not one of us liked this.  Sorry for the poor rating, although I do appreciate the opportunity to try it!

I made this for a football game get together for mexican night. I received many compliments. A lot of people said it tasted just like Taco Bell's beans. I intended for this to be a pre-game dip, which it was...but I noticed people were slathering the bean dip on tortillas while making their fajitas at half time. Other wives asked for the recipe. I was a little scared because I do not care for refried beans, but I needed a quick appetizer and this was a huge hit! I will certainly make it again for fiesta style parties!

This was dissapointing.  I love cheese, but I have to say, this recipe had FAR too much dairy.  It completely overwhelmed the beans.  Perhaps it would benefit by using just the sour cream or just the cream cheese, and reducing the other cheeses by half.  Quite frankly, there are enough variations of bean dips out there, and I am a pretty good and creative cook to begin with, I don't think I'll waste any time trying to salvage this recipe through experimenting with different proportions.

This was great and so easy. I mixed all the cheese together and baked. I used spicy taco mix also. I only used half like called for, but reading the other reviews, Ill use the whole packet next time.

Yummy! Just made for SuperBowl.  Used one 30 oz can of beans along with a regular 16 oz can just to make a little bit more.  It was really delicious and easy to make.  Besides that followed the recipe exactly.  will make again.

I've made this several times and I like to use pureed black beans. I think they have so much more flavor than plain refried beans. I also use the whole package of taco seasoning (if not more) and throw in some cumin. It's always a hit!

It is soooooooooooooooo gooooooooooood! If you do
not have refried beans you can mash kidney beans instead.

Made this to take to a party yesterday.  Doubled recipe, mixed all ingredients in food processor, and cooked on low in crock pot until warm and melty then turned down to keep warm.  Everyone LOVED it!

Was a hit at my party.  Instead of two bags of cheese, I used one - half in the filling and half on the top and it was plenty cheesy.  To spice it up I used spicy taco seasoning and sliced up some spicy peppers from the garden and mixed right in.

AWESOME Dip! The only changes I made were to use fresh grated sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheeses. I no longer use purchased taco seasoning. I use the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site. Added chopped olives to the top. Addicting dip!

I made this  for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved it more than the main dish! I used a whole package of taco seasoning, as others had mentioned, fat free beans, pepper jack cheese only, and sprinkled a little chili powder in as well. It was plenty of dip for 10 people. It was full of flavor. Thanks!

Great bean dip recipe!! I wouldn't change a thing. The only thing is that it makes a lot of dip.  Half the recipe would have been more than enough. Letfover tasted great reheated!

i made it the first time for a birthday party. Everyone loved it and nothing was left. Instead of using cans of refried beans I made my own from dried beans. Since the beans had been in the slow cooker for 12 hours it was easier to mash, had a more homestyle flavor. Also since I didn't have a green jalpeno I used 2 mole red jalpeno's in the cooking of the refried beans. Everything cooked in the slow cooker so clean up was easier and the dip stayed warm.  My kids who are picky eaters asked me to make this again and use it for burritos and taco salad.

This dip was fair.   The taste of refried beans overpowers the other flavors in the dip.  If you absolutely love refried beans, then you may like it.  There are many better recipes for a "taco type" dip.

I used an entire packet of taco seasoning and a few extra drops of chipotle tabasco. Made it for a party and it went over great.  I will make this again.

I never thought I would rave about a bean dip, but this one is very easy and delicious. I served it with tortilla chips along side some guacamole which complemented it quite well.  And as mentioned by others it does make a huge portion (...but worse things could happen!!!)

I've made this twice now and both times it was gobbled up and the recipe was requested. I like to add half the green onion to the mixture and leave the rest for the topping (also sometimes adding black olives).

I made refried beans without the refry recipie n this site.  THEN I put all ingredients in blender after I had blended the beans except for cheese.  BUT I did not use hot sauce due to jalapenos in beans.  After I blended I stirred in the cheese.  OMG!!! SO GOOD!  I can't wait till supper!!!

Yum! Everyone loved this dip. I made a big pot of Refried Beans Without the Refry (from this site) and used 4 cups of that instead of cans of beans. I also added a can of green chilies and used the whole packet of seasoning. I wouldn't have minded it having a bit more flavor though, so next time I make it I will probably add another can of chilies or maybe some roasted jalapenos. Very good though and the guys went crazy for it. Thanks! :)

Tremendously delicious!! I made this for our super bowl party and it was a huge hit. Easy to make too. I kicked up the heat by adding more taco seasoning, hot sauce and a touch of cayenne pepper. I loved this. In fact it was my fav out of all the other dips I made!

WOW this is reallllly good and creamy dip!  I started putting drops of hot sauce into the mix, and then I just decided it wasn't going to be hot enough for my friends, so I added a can of diced jalapenos.  It was SO delicious!

Very easy!  My family loved this.  I cut it in half and it still made a lot.  I topped with cheese after it came out of the oven after reading othe posts.  It melted very nicely.  Otherwise I followed exact directions.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe!  The bean dip is a hit EVERY time I make it.  This recipe is especially great for picky eaters as there aren't too many veggies like other, layered dips.  If you want leftovers to take home, you might as well make an extra batch because there is nevery any left!

This bean dip was awesome! I doubled the recipe, since it was for a big party and I didn't even need to do that! It filled a big pan up to the brim. I used reduced fat cream cheese and fat free sour cream and didn't put any cheese in the beans itself. Then I put a layer of mexican rice in between layers of beans and topped with a bag of taco cheese. Everybody loved it!

Excellent recipe! I made my taco spice (from a recipe off this site) and added some cilantro. A guest commented it was the best bean dip she ever had! Wow! I saved a bit for me to make a quesadilla with and it too was excellent. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us.

This recipe is top notch.  I make my own refried beans and freeze them so that makes this dip even better.  I followed the recipe exactly and this was excellent.  I'll be making this again for tailgate parties in the fall.

Try layering it. Bottom layer has the beans, taco seasoning, etc. Then the next layer mix cream cheese, sour cream, AND Fiesta Ranch powder mix. Then top with cheese. Cover with foil so the cheese will stay soft when it melts. This is definitely our favorite recipe, as long as it has the fiesta ranch! YUMMY!!

this is so delicious! i prefer my bean dips a little more bean-y so i usually add another can of beans. sometimes i throw in some jalapenos for some kick but no matter what i do this dip is gone in no time! especially if i serve it with fritos- they're the perfect big scoop chip for this one. i've given the recipe away more than any other!

Wow, I doubt there is a better bean dip recipe out there!!  This is good stuff!  I left out the parsley & green onions but will use the onions next time I make it since we all like them. I can't wait to make burritos out of the leftovers for a quick lunch.  :)

Good.  Halved the recipe and there was still some leftover (eight people) at a get together.  It was a little on the thick side.  Next time would put more cheese in it, less on top.  It's hard to "scoop" up with the chips once the cheese on top cools, so a sprinkle of cheese there is enough.

This recipe is PERFECTION.  Wrap some leftovers up in a flour tortilla, throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds, and you've got a delicious bean burrito!  I also halved the recipe...and i still had enough dip for an 8x8 square casserole dish.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was delicious.  I made it for my book club gathering, halved the recipe to serve 8 and it was the perfect amount.  I put it together as a last minute addition and didn't have all the ingredients, I used a bit extra taco seasoning, used a few shakes of onion & garlic powder and omitted the green onions since I didn't have any.  Delicious and quick, thanks for sharing this recipe.

Followed the ingredients except heated it in a crockpot.  I use this for bean burritos.  You can cut back on the sour cream to make it firmer for your tortilla.  I like to put a second layer of coleslaw on top for a crunch.  Great for a buffet!

I served this at a Battlestar Galactica party and it was a hit! I was worried about the reviews that said there was way too much (it does say it serves 20) however I suggest just making the full amount. There were six of us eating it (four girls, two guys) and we managed to finish it. I did follow the reviews and added the whole packet of taco seasonings. Very yummy! I need to make it for my boyfriend now :)

I used reduced fat cheeses and Hot taco seasoning and it was great!  It's also a good filler for bean burritos.

I did spice it up a bit so I give the recipe (as written) a 4. I used 3 T taco seasoning (I buy it in bulk but I believe that 2 T should be a 1/2 pkg) and one large can of refried beans. I tasted it before cooking and decided to add about 3 T chopped, bottled hot peppers and 1 t salt. I do like things a little more spicy but with a few changes this was great! I love the creaminess and flavor the cream cheese and sour cream give to this dish. Thanks

This was terrific...with a few changes.  I left out the dried parsley, hot sauce, and the taco seasoning.  Taco seasoning tends to give everything the same taste.  I used fat free beans, light sour cream, and light cream cheese. I added jalepanos from a jar which I chopped up.  It was one of the best dips I have had in a while.  I will make this again with my changes.

It was pretty good; think it needed more cheddar cheese and maybe will try with mayo instead of cream cheese.

Wonderful hot appetizer. Have made it countless times. It makes alot, so I usually 1/2 the recipe. I also make it the day before sometimes, just let it come up to room temp before popping in the oven.

This is easy to make and everyone loves it! My Daughter's friends ask for this Bean Dip all the time. I now omit the dried parsley, we like it better without and I use 4 oz can of fire roasted diced chilies instead of the green onions, as I usually don't have green onions on hand. Yum!! Thank you for sharing J. Van Liere.

Based on other reviews I took the main ingredients and made this a cold dip with terrific results. I am vegan, so I used faux cream cheese and sour cream to start. From there I blended in one can of pinto beans, one can of black beans, one medium onion, two sliced and pickled jalapenos, one entire package of taco seasoning, two tablespoons of oregano and five drops of hot sauce in my food processor. Prepared one day in advance of my party, the flavors melded perfectly and it got rave reviews served cold with chips for dipping!

I made this for our Superbowl party and it was a hit!  It was ridiculously easy to make and very tasty.  I know I'll be making this recipe again and again in the future.

I used a whole pack of Hot Taco Seasoning instead of just a half.  I also used the Jalapeno flavored refried beans.  These changes took what was only four stars for me and turned it into five.  People LOVE this recipe and always want it.  I'v never had any left over.

I love this recipe but I gave it a 4 because I changed so much. I didn't use taco seasoning because I don't really like it but instead seasoned it with cumin, garlic, salt, pepper, a little tomato paste, and a little bit of chili powder. I also didn't add the parsley.

I really didn't care for this at all. We all thought it was very bland. We even tried to doctor it up a bit after it had baked, but it still wasn't that good. Will not be making this one again.

This dip was a hit!  Everyone loved it.  I changed the ingredients to fat free ones (except the cheese) and it was great.  I only had cheddar on hand- but I think it did the job well.

This is delicious! Of course it isn't much to look at but it is so good!! I like to use half the cheese in the mixture and then the other half on top. Definitely use sturdy chips with this one. Thanks for the post.

OMG, this was awesome!  I made it for Super Bowl and it was a big hit.  I used Jalapeno refried beans and substituted Habanero Jack for 1/2 of the Jack cheese.  It still was not overly spicy for our taste.  Served with Tostitos Scoops which was perfect for the consistency of the dip.  Thank you for sharing!

Unfortunately, this was boring looking on the appetizer buffet.  It was also bland tasting...reminded us of the refried beans at Taco Bell.  Nobody ate it.

This was really strange.  We couldn't figure out if something was missing or if there was too much of something.  Maybe because I halved it?  Won't be making this again.  Good thing I tested it before my big party.

This was the best. I used this recipe plenty of times and each time it was loved. This recipe is AWESOME! Everyone loves it. I made it without the pepper sauce each time. Once I forgot the onions and the taco seasoning and it was still awesomely amazing. Great recipe. Highly recomend.

This is super easy to make and tastes awesome.  At first I questioned the servings, I thought it would be too much, but as it turned out everyone loved it and it was the first thing gone.  Like others have mentioned I also added more hot sauce and I replaced the refried beans for some spicy refried beans. I look forward to making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!!

I am sorry, I did not like this recipe at all. I thought it was bland and pasty. Fixed it for my hubby and  his friends for SuperBowl party and they will eat anything! Even they didn't much care for it.

Used a whole pkg of taco seasoning and added a can of diced green chilies...still needed somthing. Has a very creamy texture..think it would have been more interesting with ground sirloin or diced tomatoes added...still looking for a tastier hot bean dip.

This is the best bean dip.  I've eaten a ton today.  I omited the hot sauce and easier on the green onion because i didn't have those items.  Turned out delicious though.  I will always reuse this recipe.

My family, especially my husband, really loved this recipe.  We took it to a dinner party last night and it went fast.  I did not have any hot sauce so it was not added but still very tasty.  I think next time I might add some chopped jalapeno peppers for a little kick.

Excellent dip!! The only thing I would change, would be to make it a little spicer. But that's just my prefrence. Everybody loved this dip as is, but if you want more kick, use a spicy taco seasoning.

This dip was so good, two of the guests put the dish between them , fought over it, and ate it with a spoon, they called it "the killer dip". Had many requests for the recipe, and needless to say , it was a HIT.

This is a great dip.  We practically keep it in our house at all times.  It also freezes well.  I always have a small casserole size in the freezer so when company comes I can just pop it in the oven,  Thanks Julie

This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  I use an entire package of taco seasoning and about 20 drops of hot pepper sauce.  I also add chopped black olives.  It is good with tortilla chips but even better with corn chips!

This was really good, and made a huge batch!  This recipe is very mild, so I added a bit more tobasco, and next time may add some chiles.  I also used the whole package of taco seasoning.  The top crust of cheese was kind of thick, next time I may add more cheese to the dip, and use less as topping.

This is probably the easiest dip recipe ever, and it was a big hit with my friends.

This recipe was a great start (actually my hubby loved it as-is) but I would make more modifications next time. I did add 1 entire packet taco seasoning, and may add more next time. I am also going to try at least half pepper jack cheese. I used refried black beans and they were yummy - try that if you can find some!

Instead of baking it, I used a slow cooker and it came out really good. Combine them all and cook it high for about 2 hours , stirring once or twice.
Other changes I made: I used 1 1/2 cans of refried bean, 1 Tbsp. of green onions, added extra cheddar cheese and 1 can of chopped green chiles. Thanks for the recipe!!

We loved this,  but next time I'm going to make it spicier by adding a 1/2 jar of salsa.

This was pretty good.  I took the suggestion of adding a can of Rotel; I also add a little garlic powder and chopped green chili peppers.

This is a great dip!!  I didn't know beans could taste so good.  Great with salsa.
