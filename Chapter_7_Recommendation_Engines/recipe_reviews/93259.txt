Recipe was tasty as written, but I have some helpful tips for people who are health conscious: try this WITHOUT using the eggs, oil, or cream cheese. Add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the pumpkin and cake mix, and even though it sounds odd, it's SO moist, delicious, and HEALTHY!!!  Trust me, try this....

This recipe was great. I added 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice  to the dry ingredients, and it made it more of a pumpkin pie chocolate cake.  Also, after I iced the cake, I sprinkled cinnamon over the top, which made it look great, and added a bit more spice to it.  My family has really enjoyed this cake; it's great for all of our fall birthdays!  So easy too!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This cake was moist and tastey, but I didn't really taste the pumpkin, and I was hoping to. I may try again and add some pumpkin spices or use the canned pumpkin that already has the spices. I used the Whipped Cream  Cream Cheese frosting recipe I found on this site and it was GREAT with the cake. 
Again, was good, worth making, but not so sure how the pumpkin comes into play, other than it may of helped the cake be all the more moist.

I made this recipe into mini muffins, only using 2 egg whites, and 2 T. of water, cake mix and one can of pumpkin.  I did not frost them, they are a sweet treat without it!  Delicious, and a pretty guilt free snack for my chocolate craving!

I'm impressed, actually. Had I not tried this for myself I wouldn't have believed it. Wouldn't have believed that they'd be moist, tender and, most important, that the texture would be right.  It was yes to all.  While I was tempted to tinker with the eggs and/or oil I didn't, as I wanted to see this for myself as written.  These didn't taste like pumpkin at all, which was fine by me - I didn't want them to.  In fact, I wanted a bold chocolate flavor, so I added a teaspoon each of chocolate and vanilla extracts as well as a cup of miniature chocolate chips.  I chose this PUMPKIN chocolate cake recipe because it doesn't hurt to infuse your cake with a little good stuff and...because I still have an abundant hoard of canned pumpkin thanks to the Great Pumpkin Shortage of a year or two or three ago.  I baked this as cupcakes/muffins, 350 degrees about 18 minutes.

This cake is amazing.  I used to have another recipe for a chocolate pumpkin cake and, must to my dismay, I lost it.  This covered the loss!  I have to admit, I used more oil (my old recipe called for 1/3 cup, and I believe in a fat cake!).  I also added pumpkin pie spice and vanilla to the mix.  I only baked the cake for 30 minutes.  Finally, I don't do cream cheese frosting, so I mixed some chocolate frosting with a little more pumpkin and some cinnamon for a perfect topping.

I made this recipe as cupcakes for a last minute entry in a Pumpkin Recipe contest.  I won first prize!  It's sweeter than most pumpkin recipes, and I used Devil's Food Cake Mix so it was a little richer.

This cake was extra light tasting and good and only had a mild pumpkin taste.  I made it as 2 round cakes instead of 1 13 x 9. Be sure to smooth the batter out COMPLETELY in the pan as the thick batter will not do this on its own - mine ended up being a little lop-sided.

It was a great chocolate cake.  I tasted no pumpkin, but it was nice to leave out the eggs and oil and have them replaced with a healthy vegetable.  Very heavy, but yummy.

These were just ridiculously good.  The pumpkin flavor wasn't strong at all, but it was definitely there.  

I only had a can of pumpkin w/o the spices, so I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp clove, 1/2 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  

Then, I made homemade cream cheese frosting and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  

The results were amazing!  The cupcakes were super moist, and the frosting was a perfect match.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe as guide for what I had in mind.  I wanted a pumpkin cake that tastes like pumpkin.  So I followed this recipe exactly, but I used a white cake mix and added 2t. of pumpkin pie spice to the mix.  I topped it with a homemade cream cheese frosting, crossed my fingers, and served it at a party.  People raved, wanted to take pieces home, and my husband said, "you better write this one down, it's amazing!"

Yummy cake. I turned them into cupcakes and baked for 25 minutes. Minus one star because I would like more pumpkin taste. Used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting.

Can't taste the pumpkin at all, and so moist! my husband devoured it.  I think the frosting actually makes it too sweet. here is how I made it:
1 box devils food cake mix
15 oz can 100% pure pumpkin (NOT pumpkin pie)
2 egg whites
2 T water
1/2 t salt
1 t vanilla
1/2 C chocolate chips (or more if you want)
mix everything together and bake as directed on cake mix box.

Made exactly as written, but used organic cake mix. Anyway, these were okay, but after day 1 they were REALLY dry and after day 2 I couldn't eat them, they were not good. I didn't frost them, which I'm sure made a difference. Frosting makes everything better right?!

I get requests for these ALL THE TIME.  People are totally shocked when I tell them there is pumpkin in them, but they are SO MOIST!  I roast a sugar pie pumpkin & mash it with a fork to replace the canned pumpkin, and i use a dark chocolate cake mix.  I also make up a simple cream cheese frosting (1 stick of butter, 1 half-stick of cream cheese, one box of powdered sugar.  a little vanilla to taste & milk to the preferred consistancy) because I can't stand canned.

I liked this recipe, however I read advice to not use eggs or oil, so I only used half.  I don't think it turned out as moist as if I would have used the whole amount.  But the idea to add pumpkin spices was great.  I also think there could have been more pumkin flavor, maybe even more pumpkin.

These are really moist, no pumpkin flavor, but plain as far as taste goes. You can add some pumpkin spice to the mix as others have done or you can have your flavor come more from the frosting (like cinnamon cream cheese frosting). Many nutrition experts say we should all be eating more pumpkin and this is one more easy way to do that.

Made this cake for company and everyone LOVED it........except me!  It has the odd texture of a cake made w/o oil, like when applesauce is used......moist, but rather thick & dense.  I followed the directions to the letter, no changes at all.  I gave it 4 stars because it was very well received, but I don't think I'll make it again.

I made this for a birthday party and didn't tell anyone the "secret" ingredient until someone complimented it!  My sister-in-law thought it was so good, she asked me to make her daughter's cake (instead of buying one at a bakery this year)!!  Oh yeah, it's a keeper!

Excellent cake. I used a dark chocolate cake mix,and pasterized egg whites. Skipped the frosting for health reasons. Great way to add vitamin A to your diet.

Made it tonight for supper and I iced it with a peanut butter icing. Asked the family if they could tell what special flavor was in the cake. Nobody could. It was nice and moist. Couldn't tell it was made from a mix.

I tried the low fat version: omitting the eggs & vegetable oil.  Makes thick, spongy cookies/cupcakes.  I also added a teaspoon-ish of cinnamon.  This is a keeper for me.  I'll make again.

I made these into cupcakes for a bake sale, and they were the first item to sell out!   I used homemade cream cheese frosting to top them, and it was a huge hit.  The cupcakes are incredibly moist, and you cannot tell there is any pumpkin in it!  A slightly healthier alternative to regular chocolate cake.  :)

Ummm...if you follow the recipe exactly it's not very spectacular.  Tastes just like regular cake mix except a little more moist (stick to your mouth moist).  I'm not surprised that the rave reviews are mostly from people who used pre-spiced canned pumpkin.  I'm a die-hard fan of cinnamon and chocolate like what you get from Mexican chocolate cake.  Adding spices to this recipe does jazz it up, otherwise it's just plain.

This cake turned out pretty good - I added a full tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and I honestly think it could've used a little more.  I like a pumpkin taste.  Cake isn't healthy, but the good news is - pumpkin is pretty healthy and gives this cake the moisture, so I think you might be able to get away with leaving out the oil and perhaps the eggs (maybe just egg whites?) so I'll try the other member's healthier version of this next time.  Overall a good, easy cake!  Only took like 10 minutes to make and 35 in the oven!

This cake was delicious. Super moist but not super sweet. 
I added 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice to cake mix. 
I made buttercream frosting with about 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the rim and to drip down the sides. 
Milk chocolate icing on the top. 
After thinning the pumpkin spiced buttercream frosting with a tiny bit of water I drizzled that on the top over the chocolate icing. 

It actually was a normal amount of icing but looked a bit special.

Super easy, super delicious.  I tossed in a small bag of mini chocolate chips to ramp up the chocolate flavor.  I also used a tub of regular vanilla frosting.  This cake was really moist and got rave reviews!  Next time I'll be making this into cupcakes.

I have been doing a lot of baking the last two months (and my scale is showing it)!
I really LOVED this recipe and within it I think I have finally found the perfect chocolate spice cake I have been looking for... here's what happened. I started out with a spice cake mix that was about 15 oz. To make up for the difference I added about a 1/2 cup of milk chocolate fudge cake mix from a second box. I added 3 eggs instead of two. I baked it in a 13x9 pan. It took 30 minutes or less.
I found a cream cheese icing from a cupcake recipe on this site but I ended up changing that: 1/2 cup butter, 8oz. Cream cheese, both softened.Whipped high and fast. Added confectionery sugar, 2 cups and 2 tsp vanilla... as I continued to mix at medium speed I didn't like the consistency so I opened a carton of heavy cream and slowly poured in about 1/2 cup. Whipped at high speed (kitchen aid) until fluffy! NOT too long... Maybe 45 seconds...to die for!! I kept it in the fridge, three people devoured it in two days! I am very happy I got the results that I did!

This is my go-to cake recipe. It tastes rich but is deceivingly less caloric than a lot of cake! And nobody knows that but me! I've used it with several kinds of cake mixes too, and they all come out very tasty. My absolute favorite icing with it is the WHIPPED CREAM CHEESE FROSTING. from this site...

I used the "healthy" suggestion of using only the pumpkin and devils food cake mix - and wow! You can't taste the pumpkin, but these are the best moist chocolate muffins ever. I baked them in cupcake tins for 40 minutes at 350 - until a toothpick came out clean - and they turned out great.

I used the 'dark chocolate' cake mix and a can (15oz) of plan pumpkin, and nothing else. It needs to be said that you will not taste the pumpkin, just the mmmm chocolate. Also when mixing these two ingredients. I found it helpful to mix 1/3 of cake mix and some pumpkin till smooth, then another 1/3 of cake mix with more pumpkin till smooth. Now the rest of cake mix and pumpkin mix till all is smooth.  It will be a thick batter.

I have made this several times and it is a huge hit!  I have prepared the recipe as stated, and the "healthier" way as well, and find it to be just as tasty either way!  I also add 2 t. pumpkin pie spice to bring the flavor of the pumpkin out.  Five stars!!!

This is a nice moist cake, and I even omitted the oil.   Makes for a moist lower fat cake but don't be surprised by the lack of pumpkin flavor. I even added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.

Wow, this was GOOD! I made it last night for friends and it was a hit. Fortunately for cooks like me, the recipe is forgiving: I bought a 30 oz can of pumpkin instead of 15 oz. Long story short, I realized my mistake but the cake still ended up with about 22 oz of pumpkin. I think that made it tastier, though -- and I just baked it a little longer. It had a mild pumpkin flavor and was really moist. Other notes: I used Devil's Food cake mix and added 2 tsp. of pumpkin spice and served it with a Chocolate Cream Cheese frosting. So good!

I fed this to the hordes at my son's 2nd birthday party, and I think that one of the great things about this recipe is that you don't taste the pumpkin!  It was a hit, the kids went back for seconds, and I'll definitely use this recipe again.  I bet it would make great cupcakes.
