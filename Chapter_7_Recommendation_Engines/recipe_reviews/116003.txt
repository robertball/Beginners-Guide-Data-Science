This is almost exactly the recipe I've used for years. The only difference is I substitute 1 cup of the bread crumbs with 1 cup of grated parmesan cheese in the breading. You can also add 1-2 tablespoons of parsley to the mix if you want to give it an extra nudge.

This is a decent recipe. I don't love spam, but I had nothing else to make for lunch, so I made this. If cut pretty thin, this actually does taste quite good. I didn't do the flour first, just dipped in a milk/egg mix, and then italian bread crumbs. Fried in a pan until brown. Thanks for a quick, simple lunch idea!

This is so good!  We are trying to save money, so I am buying in bulk and going to the store a lot less.  I didn't know what to do with Spam.  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs.  I had cornflake crumbs, and added some italian seasoning.  That's the only thing I did different.  We really liked it!

My picky 3yo loves these! They were very easy to do..My hubby loves spam so we always have a cabinet full..this was a great last minute "what am I going to make for dinner?" recipe. Took no time at all. I used Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs so no need to season anything.

I have to admit defeat. I guess it's true sometimes you just can't go back home. I've been searching to relive my childhood dinners when my mom would fried spam. This is the second recipe I've tried, as well as just frying it

This is such a simple comfort food recipe.  Ready in less than ten minutes.  Everyone loves it.  The egg flavor comes through and reminds me of Loco-Moco.  Always a great thing!  Hubby ate his with Dijon, I had mine just hot out of the fryer.

This was a really neat way to make SPAM. I didn't use this recipe as a "snack style" recipe. I used this in mind for a dinner, using the Lite version of SPAM, served with Uncle Ben's Brown Rice and Quinoa with Red Bell Peppers and Steamed Broccoli with a Italian cheese sauce. Was just what I was aiming for. In the process of dredging, out of habit, I doubled dipped the SPAM, coating the slices with the Italian bread crumbs. And it really put a nice crust on the finished product. Also didn't deep fry but yet panned fried with just enough oil to cover as it was cooking. Was delish and will totally make again.
