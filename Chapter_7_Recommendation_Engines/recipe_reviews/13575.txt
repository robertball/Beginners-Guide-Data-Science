The texture was pretty good and the pie held together well when cut and looked nice.  The flavor wasn't bad and I definitely like the whole sugar free thing but it just wasn't very sweet at all.  If I made this again, I'd add more of the artificial sweetener or maybe even a little real sugar.

My dad is visiting for Christmas and is a diabetic and has other health issues so I really try to be careful what I make for him.  It isn't easy to find something tasty.  This was wonderful.  I recommend this to anyone that has to control their sugars...even dieters.
