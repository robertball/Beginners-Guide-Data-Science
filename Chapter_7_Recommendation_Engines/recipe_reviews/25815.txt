I couldn't believe no one has rated this recipe yet! If you haven't tried them, you have to they're wonderful. I made mine with the smaller cookie scoop so I ended up with around 7 dozen. Great way to use up leftover Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (hate to admit I still had some mini ones left from Christmas) Thank Michelle, these are great!

These cookies were out of this world! Very soft and full of peanut butter taste!
NOTE: put peanut butter cups in refrigerator overnight for easy chopping and no melting.

Fantastic cookies!  A great balance of chocolate and PB, and a wonderful soft but chewy texture.  The recipe made over 6 dozen medium cookies, enough to eat now and freeze for later.

very good! I used Reeses bites and only 1/2 the oats. You could probably get away without using oats at all.

YUMMY! These cookies are so good. I wanted to make a big batch of good cookies so that I could give some away to a friend that just had her baby, but still have enough for my family too. These made enough for both of us and where so YUMMY!

i thought these were just okay.  they weren't as chocolaty as i thought nor as sweet as most cookies.  this recipe made almost 7 dozen cookies.  co-workers thought they had a 'light' taste, not too rich.  i substituted peanut butter chips for the chopped up PB cups.  I probably won't make these again, there are a lot of other recipes on this site that would be more suited to me when i need a PB & chocolate fix.

These cookies were terrible. I was so disappointed in them! They had no flavor, just bland. A waste of ingredients.
