Enjoyed these potatoes very much.  Instead of deep frying potatoes, I baked them in the oven then added them to the skillet with cilantro and garlic mixture.

I am Syrian and my mom makes these potatoes all the time.  To prevent the potatoes from getting soggy, let the potatoes drain and cool completely--that way they'll be dry and won't become soggy when you add them to sauce.  We don't use cumin or lemon juice, but add just a little olive oil when cooking the garlic/cilantro mixture.

I LOVE the unique, delicious flavors of this dish !  To cook the potatoes & cut down on the grease and prep-time, I took the new potatoes, poked holes in them w/ a fork and microwaved them (5+ minutes).  Then i cut them into quarters and continued with the sauce as written, including the cumin and lemon.  I love it.

OMG this is sooo tasty!  Yum!  Too bad we can only go as high as 5 stars since this deserves at least 10!

I've had this before, although without the cumin.  I believe the first time I had it, it had some sort of hot pepper, perhaps jalapeno, added.  

This version is really, really, really good.  I love this alongside barbecued steak.  You can't beat the flavors!  "Shukrahn" Lebanese!

absolutely delicious!!I thought it might be a little bland but it wasnt at all! I sprinkled the potatoes with Cavenders All Purpose Greek seasoning first. I dont have a deep fryer so I just heated about an inch of oil in a pan and fried them in there for about 15 min until they were golden. I put them aside on paper towels and drained most all the oil and added the garlic and cilantro for like 5 min until the garlic crisped and added yhe potatos and the rest of the ingredients and it was sooo good! I served them with some naan (indian flat bread) and yoghurt with salt,pepper, and cucumber and it was fabulous!

This is delicious. Instead of deep frying, I simply sauted the potatoes first in a little olive oil. When they were nearly done I added the cilanto (only used about 1/4) and garlic and continued to saute. Then added cumin, lemon, and salt. Fabulous flavors! Thanks!

You do NOT have to deep fry these! Slice your potatoes very thin and sautee in a pan with some olive oil. We didn't have lemon juice on hand so we left it out, but these were AWESOME! I'm rating it a four only because I changed the cooking method.

I made these last night without the cumin; instead, I added ground coriander to really play up the flavor of the cilantro.  This is really good when served with labaneh, sliced cucumbers, sliced tomatoes, good olives, and some warm pita bread for a light middle eastern supper.

Good! After my first bite I thought, whoa needs salt! Then I read the recipe again, and what do you know, it does call for salt! I used a fair amount of it; I don't typically salt my food much but these potatoes seemed to need it. I too roasted my potato cubes instead of deep frying; they would have had a nicer colour from deep frying I think but that's not worth the hassle or extra calories. They did crisp up nicely during the quick pan-fry. These were not quite as yummy as shawarma restaurant potatoes but I liked them and would make again!

very bland.  i thought the cilantro would make a big difference but it did not.  if i tried this recipe again, i would bake the patatoes and let the seasons meld during the baking.  otherwise, it just was not very good.  i found myself pouring salt on them to liven up the flavors.  it didn't work.

I used this recipe a LONG time ago! It was a hit then and THANK HEAVENS for AllRecipes depository I've found it again. 

I added garlic, black pepper, dash of old bay marinated shrimp to the pan fry for a Baltimore spin! AWESOME  :-)

I am a big potato fan so My 5 star rating may not be entirely fair, but these really did come out perfect. I made use of the advice of others though, and baked them first. I drizzled EVO on them and baked for 35 minutes at 400 degrees. I chopped up fresh garlic and onion and sauteed with Cilantro and parley. After the potatoes were finished I tossed them into the saute mixture and cooked together for about 5 minutes. When finished I put in serving bowl and tossed with some lime juice for the extra zest. Delicious! Even excellent when re-heated. I served with homemade black bean and chicken burritos.

I really enjoyed these.  I did not deep fry the potatoes though.  I cubed them and fried them in about 4 tablespoons of canola oil. I took the suggestions of others and fried the potatoes first, removed them, sauteed the garlic and cilantro, put the potatoes back in the skillet and tossed with cumin and drizzled lemon on top.  Served with steaks.  Very nice!  Thank you!

I really liked the sound of this recipe. After reading through it, I decided to scale it back and change the cooking process without compromising the dish. My first step was to fry the potatoes in a skillet using about 3-4 Tbsp. of vegetable oil.  Once cooked, I removed the potatoes with a slotted spoon and then sauteed the cilantro and garlic in the remaining oil, following the recipe  directions from that point on.  Great recipe and will definitely make again.

These are great! I snack on them or if Im feeling super guilty like Ill eat a whole batch for myself! The only thing I do different if is that I dont add the lemon juice to the oil in step two, I usually top the tatter off with a good squeeze since I love the taste of lemon so much!

Wonderful!  All four of my kiddos loved this!!!  The only change I made was to add more lemon juice - I think 3 Tbs. in all.  It was half of a very large lemon.

I loved these! Husband thought they were good, not great. He thought they were too much like home fries. I baked the potatoes at 400 for 25-30 minutes. I cut back on the cilantro after reading the reviews, but I would have wanted more so will try it with the amount as written. I'd easily make them for company, maybe paired with the "Pan-Seared Chicken Breasts with Shallots" from this site.

We made this along with another recipe on this site for Lebanese Garlic Sauce.

The sauce did not come out (my fault) but the potatoes were amazing.  I find that there is a little too much cilantro, you could probably 3/4 or half the amount and it would be good.  Got a little mixed up with the 2 sets of oil, one for deep frying and the other for saute'ing.  Will definately make again.

I tossed all the ingredients together and oven roasted them with some olive oil instead of deep frying them. They were so good. Thanks.

Great side dish and super easy!  I baked my cut potatoes as another reviewer suggested for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  I sprinkled a little olive oil on them first.  The lemon juice is good but not necessary.

My family really liked these potatoes. My hubby loves cilantro, so this was perfect for him. I usually don't like cilantro because it has a "soapy" taste (and was concerned because this called for 2 cups!) but it didn't when I fixed it this way. I did alter the recipe a little, I cooked the cilantro and garlic in 1/4 c. olive oil in a large deep skillet and then added the potatoes and seasonings to the cilantro/garlic mix in the skillet, instead of deep frying the potatoes. Cooked them until tender, about 20 minutes. I didn't have lemon juice, so left it out. Turned out very well.

This was a very tasty recipe. I had to eventually hide them because everyone was picking on them and I wouldn't have had any left over for supper. Thank you for a quick, devine recipe.

These were very tasty! It seemed like a lot of cilantro, and I was tempted to use less, but it cooked down to a lot less, and was the perfect amount. I also baked the potatoes, adding a bit of butter to the baking sheet. I fried the cilantro and garlic in about 2 Tbsp. butter. Will make these again!

I had really wanted this to be something different but was disappointed. Since I did take advice of others & didn't deep fry the potatoes I thought I'd give it another chance, but hubby said just delete it. He couldn't figure out why the cilantro was put in before the potatoes because he couldn't taste it at all. It was worth a try, but I'd deep fry the potatoes as stated because maybe this would taste better.

I omitted the cumin and I thought this was tasty and my Saudi friend said it tasted like he was used to back home, only they dip the potatoes in labna, a middle eastern yogurt. I will definitely try that next time as I already love labna with french fries! I think that would make this a 5 star recipe for me then.

We love garlic.  We love cilantro.  We love potatoes.  I followed the recipe exactly.  So why didn't we love this dish?  It just lacked "umph".  Probably will not make again.

I cooked my potatoes in the oven first. I think they were pretty boring but a friend really like them. I'm sure they would be better fried.

I had a little trouble getting the potatoes to cook evenly (I don't have a deep fryer).  Next time I'll add the cilantro nearer to the end to properly capture its flavour.  Otherwise, yummy.

ABERSOWL, You're right on the money.  "Meh" was the general consensus around here.  I did cut the cilantro... I Mean, I LOVE cilantro, but TWO CUPS?  That's outrageous.

I REALLY liked this recipe. I cut the potatoes and cooked them like you would fries and added a little more garlic tha called for after i tossed the fries in the garlic cilantro mix i sprinkled fresh ground garlic salt over them and tossed them again. It was wonderful! My husband was a little wary to try them but once he did, he LOVED them!

Our dish didn't come out like the photo at all, but still tasty.  We're going to try it again and work on the presentation.  How do you keep the potatoes from browning and asure they are fully cooked?  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't think I will make this again. I made it how it was told and it just didn't taste right to me. I didn't like the lemon with the potatoes. My family also asked me not to make them again. If I do make it again I will change some thing up. thank you
