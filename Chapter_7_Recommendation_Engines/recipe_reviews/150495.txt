2 3/4 c. water is way too much water.  it was watery in the bottom.  it was okay, but too water and lacked flavor.

So, I went against my rule on this website to only try recipes which have been rated a million times with a consistently high rating.  And I was really happy to find that this one turned out great!  It was a huge hit at  an early family Christmas dinner last night.  Even my husband, who doesn't even like chocolate, loved it!  I will definitely be making this one often!

I use day-old baguettes from the cafe I work in, which are great, but I always end up needing more liquid for the pudding to get good and moist inside. I usually fill the condensed milk can with regular milk and throw that in. I love that it's not SUPER sweet. Also, I usually leave out the cocoa powder and just throw in a handful of dark chocolate chips.

Okay, I modified this bc I had homemade vanilla pudding that I really wanted to use up.  So I subbed the pudding for the sweetened condensed milk, left out the water, and didn't do the topping.  Instead of putting the nuts in with the bread, I sprinkled sliced almonds on top.  It turned out moist (but not watery or anything!) but also a bit crispy on top, which is exactly how I like my bread pudding.  Very chocolatey, too.  I think it would probably go well with ice cream, too, for those who like it (I don't--yes, I know, I am very strange).  Thanks for the recipe!
