Great toffee. (TIP - Before you make this, make sure it's not raining or too humid outside. Make this on a dry day or else the toffee will be sticky hard and not turn out). I would disregard the review about using only half of the butter.  You will need two sticks of butter to make it right.  Directions:  melt sugar, butter & water to a boil for about 5 min, or until the sugar has completely dissolved. This will help you avoid getting that awful grainy texture after it cools.  Stir constantly w/ a wooden spoon during this 5 minutes or until sugar has dissolved.  Then remove spoon, reduce heat to medium low and keep at a steady low boil/bubble.  Insert candy thermometer and don't stir anymore.  If you use a heavy gauge stainless pot and keep it bubbling low it should not burn at all or need stirring.  Toffee will need to reach AT LEAST 300 degrees and no more than 310.  Take off the heat, add dash of salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla and quickly pour onto a jelly roll pan lined with greased foil or regular parchment paper.  Then follow with the rest of the directions.  For those who are getting burnt toffee before it reaches 300, your heat is still too high. To make the toffee a little less 'stick-to-your-teeth' - add 3 tablespoons light corn syrup and 3 tablespoons water to the sugar/butter mixture before cooking. Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract immediately after you take it off the heat. This will make the toffee more 'melt-in-your-mouth' texture and fail-safe.

After experimenting, here is what I figured out.  The toffee turns out amazing if you do two things diffent.  First, I used half the amount of butter that was called for.  Second, when cooking with sugar, you have to wait for it to caramelize... that means that you should not stop cooking it until it turns into a light chocolate (toffee apple!) color that is thick and creamy.  Then let it cool... it will start to harden right away. Be sure to take it off as soon as it turns the light brown color so that it doesn't begin to burn.  Happy cooking!

This toffee was DELICIOUS and turned out perfectly.  I read all of the reviews and decided to follow the correct measurements of the ingredients: 1 cup butter, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, and 2 TB water.  I first melted the butter, then added the sugar and water and stirred continually for 5 minutes.  Then, I stopped stirring and lowered the gas heat as low as possible.  I cooked it for about 15 minutes, stirring every five minutes or so.  Then I added the slivered almonds--I used about 1/2 cup, which I am so glad that I did!  I then clipped my candy thermometer to the side and continued to stir about every five minutes.  When the thermometer reached 300, the mixture had no changed enough yet the rich caramel color, so I raised the heat just a bit and began stirring continuously.  When it reach around 312, the color was perfect and I removed it from the heat.  I quickly poured it onto a cookie sheet which I had prepared with foil and cooking spray.  While I was spreading the toffee (quickly!) I heated 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips in the microwave for about two minutes, stirring once half way through.  I then spread the melted chocolate all over (this worked much better than allowing the toffee to melt the chocolate chips).  Then I topped the chocolate with chopped walnuts.  This was fantastic, delicious toffee which tasted just like toffee I purchased at a craft fair by the Toffee House.  Thank you so much for this great recipe--I am about to go make some more right now!!!

This is an excellent recipe, just as is. Do not succumb to the temptation to add less butter. That will result in a product that is not as luxuriously delicious as it could have been. The candy is known in England as "butter toffee." In other words, the butter is the star, and real toffee is crammed full of it. That said, I realize there are many reviews here that refer to the buttery, oily ooze that rises to the top of their toffee. The cause of this is, quite simply, that it was cooked at too high a temperature to allow the chemical process to take place sufficiently. By heating the sugar, we develop the structure of our finished product. In order to accomplish this properly, the sugar has to melt slowly so that there's sufficient time for its molecules to combine with those of the butter, resulting in that delicately crunchy, buttery product. Remember that patience is always your friend when making any candy. Sure, I understand that  it can become tedious to wait and wait for that temperature rise, but better that than to end up with a low quality product that you're not proud to serve or worse yet, that ends up in the trash. With the cost of groceries now days, that's a minor tragedy.  Always cook on low heat and allow the melting process to occur slowly and evenly. The same for the temperature rise. Low and slow - your new mantra. Do this on a nice weather day and follow that one piece of advice, and you'll turn out stuff that will put Heath bars to shame every time.

I gave it one star so it's easy to find help when people have problems making it.  It's not greasy!  If you are saying your toffee is "greasy" that means it SEPARATED!  I have read that when it does that, you can add 1 TABLESPOON of HOT water at a time (no more than 5 of them) until the mixture comes back together.  DO NOT make toffee when it is raining or snowing.  You will not get crunchy candy.  You will get chewy candy that sticks to your teeth.  Use BUTTER (not margarine, crisco, etc.).  Don't cook it too fast.  Goes from done to burnt in a few seconds (as fast as it takes to count 4 mississippis!).  Hope that helps.  Also, use a deep pot.  If you don't, the mix will bubble up and over the pot while cooking.  Candy is very tricky, and can still separate for reasons nobody knows.

Yes, the butter is right you MUST use a cast IRON skillet and dance little circles around the pan with a WOODEN spoon with big swoops in between!!! It helps to warm the skillet in the oven for a bit, too not too hot though.  My family(from England) has made toffee every year for the holidays and I lost the recipe, this is the closest so far. It does take longer than the recipe states mine 30min. of stirring.

Although the first batch I made had the oil problem noted by other reviewers I tried again and the next several batches came out wonderful. Only thing I did differently was change pans. The batch where the butter never fully incorporated was made in a non-stick pan. When I switched to regular stainless steel it worked great. Don't know if that was the reason or just coincidence but I changed from my old recipe of many years to this one for the rest of my Christmas cooking. Fast, easy and YUM! Can you say teacher gift?

I haven't made this one yet, but it looks similar to the recipe I was using.  I recommend using a candy thermometer, needs to be 310 degrees for hard crack stage.  On my stove/altitude that takes about 15 min.  I make it in a non-stick saucepan.  After I made it a few times, I recognized what it looked like when "ready".  It's been a year so I will be using the candy thermometer again.  Also, best to make candy like this on a day that is not humid.  Hard to find in Southeast Texas, but I've made it, so...  I definitely recommend the candy thermometer though.

This toffee turns out perfectly everytime! Just be careful not to over-cook it.  It's so rich and buttery!  I won 1st place with it at our county fair! I used sliced almonds instead of slivered and also added finely chopped almonds to the top of the chocolate.  This is now my #1 toffee recipe!

Very easy to make with only a few ingredients needed.  Although the final product tasted very good, the texture of the toffee was very oily and overall it was messy to eat.  It would be difficult to wrap these up to give for Christmas.

I'm actually quite scared of cooking confectionary because of the hot sugar, but this was very easy to make - I halved the quantity of butter after reading the reviews as I prefer less oil (although seems a bit beside the pont to be counting calories while making toffee!!) and it came out fine. I used a non-stick frypan and just kept cooking until it caramelised (turned brownish - about 12 minutes). I will definately be using this recipe again for christmas pressies and for school sweets-days.

This is an excellent recipe with ONE IMPORTANT exception.  You must add a tablespoon of corn syrup.  This will keep the sugar from crystalizing and making the toffee grainy.  I tried this recipe twice with the same problems as many other reviewers - oily, globby mess.  My third try I added the corn syrup and it worked perfectly.  Good luck!

This called for way too much butter. I did it twice exactly how it said to do it and each time it separated and was oily on top and then burned it trying to fix it. I tried another recipe with less butter and it was perfect.

I have made some very much like this for more than 40 years, except mine has  you sprinkle the nuts over the chocolate at the end.  The old recipe says "cook to the color of a brown paper bag", which I find takes about 14 minutes after the sugar mixture starts to boil, and it recommends stirring the whole time (though I may stand back next time!).  If you have a ceramic cooktop, cast iron is not recommended.  A heavy 3-4 quart anodized saucepan works well.  This is a dangerous process because it gets much hotter than boiling water and can cause a fire if you turn your back.  For safety, shoo kids and pets out of the kitchen and ignore the phone. Have a pot lid handy to smother flames, though you should never need it.  Have all ingredients and equipment lined up before you start.

I've made this recipe several times. it is perfect every time. one of the keys is to cook this until it is hard candy. i've been making candy for years from old recipes - some handed down from family. i was taught to test the candy in a cup of cold water. this means when you think the candy is done down a bit of it into cold water. when it is crunchy in the cold water you know it is done for toffee. this IS just at that point where the color of the candy/caramel changes and starts to darken. pull it of NOW.  :  )  i pour this into a rectangle cake pan lined with parchment paper. then i add whole roasted almonds - a few scattered and pushed in so that they are inside the toffee. :  ) then i do put the chocolate chips on top while it is hot. this works perfectly. a few minutes later the chips are melted and i use a spatula to spread the chocolate over all of the toffee. after this i quickly sprinkle chunks and ground up roasted almonds. i put the almonds in the food processor and pulse so there are some big chunks and some small and some crushed. wala!!! perfecto!

I made this this morning as a gift for a friend's birthday.  It was so good I am going to make some to keep.  I followed the recipe but because I use unsalted butter, I added 1/8 tsp kosher salt. I used non-stick aluminum foil to line the pan.  It worked perfectly and I recommend it highly.  I also topped it with thinly sliced toasted almonds, crumbling them onto the still-warm semisweet chocolate right after spreading it over the candy.  It chilled in less than an hour and broke up perfectly.  I had no problem with separation during cooking and it was not grainy in the least.  I used my 3qt All-Clad saucepan on my smallest burner at med-low heat and stirred only occasionally until the mixture reached 300 degrees.  I did not have any problem with texture and the chocolate adhered fine.  This is a great recipe and since I always have chocolate chips and nuts in the freezer I can now make candy on short notice.  Since I live in a dry climate I imagine that helped me avoid some of the problems others have had and I didn't see any reason to add corn syrup; it came out just great as-is. Thanks, Nora!

This recipe turns out well, but I added 2 teaspoons of Mexican vanilla and a little less water. I use a big cast iron skillet and I doubled the recipe. I stir constantly with a flat spatula. I don't use a candy thermometer, I just go by color.  I like it with salted butter. A 12 oz package of mini semi sweet chocolate chips melts fast and spreads smoothly. Chopped toasted almonds sprinkled over all. People I share this with think I'm a kitchen genius. I live in a humid place and don't have trouble with candy behavior. So delicious!

As a first time Toffee maker, I was a little nervous however this recipe couldn't have made an easier and more wonderful batch of candy. A couple things I changed per reviews were replacing 2 Tbs of butter with corn syrup to prevent sugar crystallization and I followed the instructions to melt the butter then keep it on the lower side of medium for the rest of the time giving the butter time to incorporate with the sugar. Also, I used Parchment Paper instead of buttering the large cookie sheet which worked perfectly. The only change I'll make next time is a touch of vanilla. I did use a candy thermometer watching it rise to 310 before pulling off the burner which resulted in a perfect crunch with zero burn issues.

This was good homemade candy.  You'll want to make sure it reaches a dark carmel color before you take it off the burner (about 10-12 minutes for my batch.)  I also reduced the butter to 3/4c. and added 2 Tbs. of corn syrup to prevent sugar crystals from forming.  Also, I DID NOT STIR THE POT but rather covered it with a lid.  I've read that stirring causes crystal formation and results in grainy candy.  When covered, the trapped steam washes any sugar crystals down the inside of the pot.  Also, be sure to BUTTER YOUR PAN WELL, otherwise your candy will flake off and crumble instead of coming off in nice pieces.  Next time I will probably line the pan with foil, then butter the foil to make for easy removal.

I'm revising my review....I took another person's advice on here and used all the butter and added 3 tbs of water and 3tbs of corn syrup.  It was the corn syrup that helped with the grainy texture.  Once the sugar was dissolved, I put in my candy thermometer and let it go.  DO NOT STIR AT ALL!  I let it cook until 290 and it came out perfectly.

This is a delicious recipe for English toffee!! This was my first time attempting to make toffee, so I was very nervous about making it. My niece and I tried it, and the first batch burnt. It was because I got nervous because the sugar wasn't melting at first, and I think I turned the fire up too high. Well, after tossing that batch, we tried it again, this time with the fire kept very low,allowing the sugar to melt slowly and stirring every few minutes. We used raw almonds and roasted them in the oven separately. While the sugar was melting, we let the almonds cool. Once they were cool, I rough chopped them. I didn't add the almonds to the toffee until right before I poured it onto the cookie sheet. It turned out wonderful!! I was soooo proud and happy we tried it again. I will definitely be making this treat for the holidays.

This turned out wonderfully.  I added chopped up almonds to the top.  I got rave reviews from family and coworkers on this candy!

I've made this twice, following the exact recipe. Very easy and delicious outcome! The outcome really varied on the length of cooking time. The darker the colour of the mixture, the more crunchy it will be. The first time I made it it wasn't as crunchy, but it was just as delicious! I took it to my tennis lessons and they were a hit. I haven't done them with almonds yet, but when I do, I'm sure that it will be just as delicious!

I tried a similar recipe with poor results because I didn't know enough about making candy and the directions were lacking.  So after reading the reviews and tips here I decided to try again.  This time I used 1 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, ended up using 3 tbsp cold water, 2 tbsp corn syrup and 1 tsp salt.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla at the end just before pouring onto parchment paper.  I only stirred at the beginning to mix the ingredients and then I refrained from putting that spoon back in the pot.  It turned out wonderful, the candy tasted like a werthers num.  Then I put the layer of melted chocolate on and sprinkled minced pecans.  Thanks for all the tips, I had just about given up on candy making :)

This toffee tastes exactly how my grandmother used to make, and could not be easier.  I did omit the nuts and boil the mixture until about 280'-290', and it set up perfectly.  I also melted my chocolate and then spread it over the top.  It turned out PERFECT and everyone loves it!  I will definitely be making this each and every year, from now on.

There may be a little too much butter in this but it's delish! A few things when making toffee, never use a non-stick pot and if it separates on you simply add a small amount of warm water and whisk till it come back together, you can add up to a 1/8 of a cup of water but go slow- On the verge of burnt w/ sea salt is divine!!!

I decided recently to give out candy for christmas presents this year, and tried a half batch of this toffee (with no nuts) before going full scale. I did have a lot of problem getting the sugar to caramelize, and it took nearly an hour before I gave up and upped the heat far above what I thought sounded safe.
Finally the toffee turned golden and then set wonderfully.
I also had a problem with the butter and sugar separating like some others had mentioned but when I did I simply added more water (half a tablespoon at a time) and they all blended back together just fine. All in all I think I will be using this recipe for my christmas gifts.
(I also melted the chocolate ahead of time and spread it on the toffee when it had half cooled, which worked wonders)

I have been making this same recipe for almost 40 years now, but I use Hershey's chocolate bars (it takes about 7 for a long glass casserole dish).  The bars melt in seconds, and you just spread the melted milk chocolate to cover the toffee.  It is very easy, but you must stir the butter and sugar constantly to prevent burning.

I made it as the directions read, except I added a dash of salt and 1 tsp vanilla after the candy reached 305 degrees (as some reviewers suggested).  Really good toffee!  Next time I will use chocolate almond bark though as I don't like the flavor of the choc chips.

I just made 4 batches of this candy and as a matter of fact I am writing this review while still in my kitchen....this recipe was super easy! I read all the other reviews who tried to complicate this recipe but there really is no reason. The adjustment I made was instead of 2 tbls of water I used 1 tbls of water and 1 tbls of vanilla. It does take a little longer to cook than the recipe suggested on my electric stove top, I made the candy in a non-stick pan and it is raining today and everything came out great!  Oh yeah the only other recommendation I would give is to but mini chocolate chips to sprinkle over and melt so they would melt faster and easier or just melt the chocolate and top the candy once it is hard.  Great recipe!! Give it a try!!

Made this and it did not turn out.  Would like to rank it with no stars.  Wouldn't turn golden color, and the sugar separated from the butter.  Not sure if the instructions are accurate - I've never made a candy where you stirred constantly, but didn't quit for a while, and let it cook. I tried Paula Dean's toffee recipe, and it turned out great!  Was easy to make, as well.  Her instructions made much more sense than those for this recipe, based on my experience (several years) in making candy.

Quick note on my review, I didn't put the almonds in during the mixing process, in fact I also used walnuts, but I put them on top of the chocolate and pushed them into the chocolate just after the toffee hardened but the chocolate was still warm and accepting of the walnuts.

I have never made Eniglish Toffee before, but my mom always made it.  This is as good as hers.  I cooked it until it was the color of light carmel, and it seemed to darken up a little after I poured it out.

I was expecting chewy toffee, but this was still delicious! I used 1/2 cup of butter and no almonds or chocolate chips but it made a wonderful birthday present for my friend. I blotted up the excess oil with paper towels.

Excellent!  Rave reviews everywhere I took it.  It's easy but a little tricky.  Be sure to watch for that golden, even dark golden, color.  I stopped at 310 degrees.  I put walnuts on top instead of the almonds inside.  Also I lined the pan with parchment for easy removal.

Super easy!  I couldn't find my candy thermometer, so I was at a loss knowing the correct temp on cooking the mixture.  Once it hit an amber color I poured it onto a jelly roll pan lined with heavy foil and greased.  I had no problem with the candy being greasy or removing it.  Definitely will be redoing it again next year for holiday gifts.

Great Recipe. You must cook it a very long time to gain the appropriate texture, being very careful not to burn. It took a long time for mine to carmalize. If it is grainy in texture it is because it wasn't cooked to the right stage. I keep ice water next to my stove and dribble a bit into it to gauge texture. This is a "watch constantly" recipe.

THE BEST!  These was addicting delicious.  I used a non stick pot to cook the butter/sugar and found a couple things important to remember.  1. Use a whisk - I was using a nonstick pot so I used a silicone whisk a- it helps to keep the butter and sugar mixed together and slow it from cracking into an oily mess.  Also constantly whisk/stir - it keep everything incorporated. 2.  Let the toffee cool somewhat before adding the chocolate to the top.  You don't need to wait long - 2 minutes is plenty.  Just long enough that it isn't molten lava.  Waiting for it to slightly set means you have chocolate on TOP of your toffee instead of inside it.  3. Play with your toppings.  Keep the chocolate but while the chocolate is still melted - you can add toasted nuts (always toasted if not you are doing it wrong), sea salt, crushed pretzels, (I even saw someone add rosemary and sea salt).  I used this as a cookie swap "cookie" and everyone asks me to bring it year after year.  Easy and delicious!

This is similar to the toffee I've made each Christmas for friends and family since the '80s. I use 1 lb of good quality butter, 2C sugar, a small bag of slivered almonds and 1 'giant' Hershey bar for each batch. That's it - no water. Cook butter/sugar at medium low in a heavy pan (I use the pan of my pressure cooker). Cook til it almost reaches hard crack stage and then add all almonds, let cook til hard crack and then pour quickly onto large piece of aluminum foil (I spread it on my kitchen table and put a towel under it).  Spread as thinly as possible as it will harden as you're spreading.  (My end result is thinner than the picture shown.)Break chocolate bar into pieces, let it sit a few minutes and then spread over the hardened candy. I let it sit overnight and then break into pieces and store in tins. Tips:  only use high quality, brand name butter and let it soften first at room temp. Stir occasionally at first and then as it starts to change consistency and especially as it starts to change color, stir constantly, using a wooden spoon. I don't have a candy thermometer but determine its readiness by 1) color (coffee with moderate amount of cream) AND 2) stream a bit of the toffee from the pan into a cup of ice water - if it makes a brittle piece of candy instantly, it's ready.  Don't put almonds in too early as they will burn.  Re butter separating, I've had that happen a couple of times but I just stirred briskly as I was pouring onto foil to incorporate.

Super yummy!! After many trial and error I found that a cast iron skillet was the golden ticket. I do t care what other recipes say, only stir every 3-5 minutes NOT continuously! My butter didn't seperates when I backed off on stirring!!! Didn't use a thrmometer but waited to get the caramel color and it was perfect! I used dark chocolate on the top....heaven!

My recipe calls for 1 lb. butter, 2 1/2 cups sugar, 2 cups whole almonds (melt butter, add sugar and cook over medium heat until sugar melts and mix is foamy, then add almonds).  Stir until almonds pop and mixture begins to SMOKE!  Pour into jelly roll pan.  Cool slightly.  Cover with 11-16 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Sprinkle with chopped nuts.  Cool completely then break into pieces.

Fantastic recipe AS IS.  I can't stress enough that you use the exact amount of butter the recipe calls for, no less.  If you use less, you are ruining the product.  The trick is cooking temperature!!  Got to stay on top of the temp and using cast iron is a toffee tradition for a reason, because it works.

I don't have a candy thermometer so I stirred on medium all through the buttery, sticky dough looking bubbles until it started to turn to a toffee color with few bubbles. Probably 15 minutes of stiring. Then I chilled mine in the fridge after to harden it enough to break apart. I don't think I'll add the nuts to the mix next time to make it easier to cut.

This recipe was easy enough and turned out great! I followed the advice of another review and cut down on the butter.
 For my first time ever making candy I could not have found a better recipe!

ok I just wasted 2 batches of ingredients on this. I made it last year and it came out great! Maybe I used a different pan or something, but I poured off 1/2  cup of butter before pouring the second batch out and the result was still swimming in a lagoon of oil. Oh well, I'll see how it turns out, but I think it's easier to go buy english toffee in the nice candy shop in town next year and save myself the grief, the mess and waste of time and money. Congrats, to those who have succeded, it probably was something I did wrong as I have made this last year and it was GREAT!

I had to make this toffee twice.  The first time I made it I followed the instructions to the letter.  It tasted burned.  I had to throw it out.  The second time I used my own judgement with the toffee.  I found that I stirred constantly and waited till the candy was actually toffee colored before removing it from the heat, I tested in water for the crack stage.  I also added 3T water as well as 3T of white corn syrup as recommended by another person.  Came out great.  Use you own experience when making this candy...

This was so easy and is probably the best toffee I have eaten.  I usually use my candy thermometer to make candy like this, but I just relied on the color and consistency of the mixture.  I poured it onto a cookie sheet lined with foil, tossed on the chocolate chips and after a few more almonds, done.  It set up perfectly and is not too chewy and not so hard that it breaks your teeth.  It is perfect, buttery, toffee.  Will use this recipe often, especially during the holidays.  Thanks!

Delicious and very easy! Crisp crunchy texture without being too sticky. Flavor is good but not super rich--if you're looking for that authentic English toffee experience, I'd use another recipe that calls for more butter.

Dissolve the sugar first.  Some said half the butter, some said all the butter. I compromised with 3/4.  It turned out delicious, but still very buttery.  I drained quite a bit of butter off that just didn't mix in .  Instead of mixing the nuts in, I sprinkled them on top of the chocolate.  I did part walnut, part almond and part no nuts.  They were all delicious.

Well, I thought how hard could this be since Im an "expert" in the kitchen...but FYI candy making is pure SCIENCE!
I learned that there are many factors to perfecting candies. One of them is the humidity and weather, so Florida might not be the best place to make these.
Im guessing that it only took the author about 15 minutes because they were a master candy maker and had made this numerous times, maybe even in a dry climate.
Anyways, I needed some toffee bars for these cookies I was going to bake (i will stick to baking from now on) but forgot to buy  them. So I thought I would make my own.
At first, It was going great... then I turned the heat up to carmelize it faster, and found out quickly that there is no way to speed up candy making, so dont try. That then caused my mixture to separate and all the butter was on top of this really grainy blob of goo. Well, i learned that you can fix that problem by adding a tablespoon of water at a time till it smooths back out. Fine, did that,  and it looked much better again but still no toffee. I couldnt get it to the right temp. and after an hour of trying to make it right, I gave up. I do have some yummy grainy caramel taffy type things now though ;)
Ill drop a lump or two in my coffee and go to the store to get those toffee bars after all!!
I am sure the error lies with me so Ill give this 3 stars!

If you've made this and it didn't turn out, you need to read the review from 12/20/03 LCDOYLE. I did, and it turned out perfectly. Also, when the recipe says bring to a boil, that means to crank the heat up. Don't leave it on Med Low. You'll not get anywhere. Good luck! This is a great recipe.

I read the reviews and one of them said to cook this low and slow, however that ended up in a disaster of burnt toffee before I was able to reach 300 degrees. Determined to try again, I went back to the original recipe and kept my heat on medium. I cooked it in a nonstick pan, and I added the two tablespoons of corn syrup as suggested in other reviews. As it got towards the end, I put my candy thermometer in and watched as it closely approached 300 degrees. I pulled it off and immediately spread Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips and some lightly salted, roasted, Dimond almonds that I had chopped finely. This time the result was superb and I will definitely make this again!

Here are a few hints to help you.  First, stir and keep stirring to the end.  

Second, when you make toffee, you are taking the butter/sugar mixture to a very high temperature, close to burning.  Thus, one clue that you are close to done, you will smell a slight wisp of the mixture burning.  I typically keep going for a minute after that, and then quickly put it into my buttered pyrex dish.

Third, a s you cook the butter/sugar mixture,  once it gets boiling, the appearance will change twice.  At first, it doesn't seem to be mixed, and it changes to be kind of a silvery, shimmery mixture.  THat mixture will then change, turning brownish, look a little greasy, and not cling to the side of the pot so much as you stir it.  When that starts, you are close to being done.  Stir for a minute of two more, unless you smell it burning.

Fourth, I can do a single batch in a 6" diameter pot.  I can do a double or triple batch in a 10" pot.  (note: it is hard to get the mixture out of a pot that doesn't have a handle -- after all, at the end the mixture is 300+ degrees. Have an over mitt around to help you.)  But never make a double batch in a 6" pot, because the mixtu

I was so anxious to try this recipe that I used pecans instead of almonds. (I had them already,) and it was phenomenal. I assumed it would be more difficult than fudge or pralines, but it was even easier!

It wasn't raining, but the humidity outside was at 75% when I made it. (Thanks, New Orleans.) I cooked it to 310 degrees, and it was perfect. I did it again today just to be sure it wasn't a fluke, and it came out brilliantly once again. 

This is definitely going on my holiday favorites list!

Great recipe, I made this to give away to family for Christmas and it got rave reviews. I'm now getting email requests for the recipe. The only thing I noticed was it took longer than 5-6 minutes for the toffee to turn to the right color but the extra time was well worth the wait. This will become one of the "must" make on my list. Thanks for sharing the recipe....  Liza

After reading the reviews and messing up the first batch the second time around it turned out WONDERFUL.  I used the ingredients that the recipe calls for but I did use a candy thermometer.  There is no way that this recipe takes only 15 minutes.  It was more like an hour because the mixture has to heat slowy and until it reaches 310.

I made this and followed direction as written. The only thing is that it really takes longer than 20 minutes to make. It took me 30 to get the right boil on the syrup. Remember when making this type of candy low and slow is the way you will want to bring the syrup up to tempature.

This did not work for me.  I tried it twice and both times the toffee never turned brown and the mixture separated to make a gooey mess.  I too wonder about the amount of butter since it all rose to the top of the pan while cooking.

I am not a sweet tooth, but toffee is a serious weakness.  For that reason, I'd always left it to the professionals and bought mine from a bona fide candy maker wanting only the 'good stuff'.  Until last week. On a whim, I decided to venture forth and chose this recipe based on ease and reviews--it did not disappoint.  Turned out perfectly!!  Friends and family loved it as did I.  I will be making it again for bake sales and holidays for years to come.

We cooked it for longer than stated, though I did double the reciepe. Cooked until it was golden and smelled like toffe, and tested a drop in cold water. Melt in your mouth, easy, I omitted the nuts because of allergy so I literally had all the ingredients without going to the store....gotta love that!

Second time around for me with this recipe. The first time it separated and I hadn't read the reviews to know there is a remedy for this. drained off the top and the bottom stuff made good toffee. I just finished my second batch. First I calibrated my candy thermometer, it was about 15 degrees low, ok. Took it slow and easy. I started getting concerned when it began to boil, I thought the froth on top was coming over and got another pan ready, not needed. Finally it began to turn color about 225 degrees. Thermometer 15 degrees low? finally about 235 I felt it would be burning if I didn't get it out of there. I had a cup of ice water with me to test it, and it was granulated. Well, I am forging ahead, I may have to try it again. I had to laugh at some of the superstitions, like stirring it only clockwise and only making it in dry humidity. I live in Colorado, 20% is a humid day here.

These tasted way better than anything you can buy in the store. The only thing I did different was to break up the toffee and chocolate cover the individual pieces.  Giving as gifts for Christmas. Yummy!

I really struggled with this recipe. I stirred and stirred for 20+ minutes and the sugar just wouldn't brown. I must have done something wrong.

I made this with unsalted butter and found the toffee to be a bit bland .  I sprinkled kosher salt on top of the chocolate and nuts and it was super yummy.  I will be making this again, probably tomorrow....  ;)

i did not have chocolate on hand so i tried the toffee with just almonds. I made 4 batches! Awfully hard to get right. I used a candy thermometer and followed the directions exactly. The 1st batch tasted exactly like my cast iron pot and took a long time to come up to temp. Yuk.  DO NOT USE CAST IRON. The candy flavor is too subtle and can not stand up to the metallic taste it adds. Next I used a stainless steel pot and it burned a little of course, ruined. Next i lowered the heat in the steel pot, it reached temp but the sugar never dissolved, it was the right color but taffy like and gritty. I ran out of butter so I used regular smart balance spread in the steel pot and it came out beautifully, I had to be careful not to burn it. I have no idea why it worked better with the spread. I recommend a very thick metal pot and a candy thermometer. Also say away from parchment paper, it picks up the waxy taste.

Very similar to an Amish brittle recipe I've seen on here.  But this is the easiest recipe I've ever found for english toffee.  Tastes very good.

Great, easy recipe for a quick delicious dessert! I do agree with a previous comment that said be sure do make this recipe on a not-so-humid day because it does make a difference.   I also added about 6 tablespoons of fresh finely ground flax seeds to the recipe to add some healthy fiber and omega 3's. It didn't affect the taste of the recipe at all (I've made it with and without the flax seeds).   Thanks for this lovely recipe! Thumbs up!!

They were awesome.  I only had one problem....... When i broke them into pieces all the chocolate fell off the top of the toffee.  You had to pick up a chocolate piece and a  toffee piece if yo wanted tot had a bite with both flavors.  Not a big problem , but I have cooked them twice and the chocolate fell offf both times..Otherwise they are delich......

One thing I have found to make this even better is to wait for the sugar to reach 300 f, then add the almonds.  Also, add a dash, 1/8 tsp or so, of salt to the sugar beforehand.  Another way to tell the sugar is all melted, is the point after all of the boiling I have noticed the mixture will look grainy, then start to melt again.

Perfect!  I followed the recipe omitting the nuts.  My 7 year-old was the 'chef' and does not like them.  We just love it!  It takes a while to cook.  But I think the recipe time is just about right.  Don't overcook!

This was such a great, easy recipe!  It turned out perfectly with just a couple small changes.  I only used 3/4 cups of butter, which worked wonderfully. (I think it would've been too greasy if I'd used the full cup) I had a candy thermometer on hand, but just used my intuition.  I waited for the mixture to turn that caramel color, and just when it started to smell like it may be starting to burn, I removed it from heat and poured onto my prepared sheet. (My thermometer read 250... so it's good I didn't wait for it to say 300 like the other reviews!) Also, I chopped the almonds and stirred them in the mixture, as well as sprinkling them on top of the chocolate. Lastly, I used chocolate almond bark, and had no trouble with it binding to the toffee. It turned out so well! I can't wait for the holidays!

Wow, this one was a drag.  I tried twice to make this and both times ended up with a mess of a mixture that would not change color or set up the way other candy recipes have.  A lot of ingredients and time wasted.  Not a summer recipe, I guess.

Everyone raved about this recipe. They could'nt believe it was homemade! I cut the sugar to 1 cup though and it turned out great. I used a candy thermometer and waited until it boiled down and thickened.Iit is vital to let it reach 300 F and to not let it exceed 320 F. Hope it is helpful. Also, once you put the chocolate down, wait a minute until it is softened before spreading.

This recipe is easy to adapt to what you have on hand... I had no almonds so I left them out.  I had a couple of Hershey Bars left over from Halloween so I used them instead of chocolate chips.  I had Imperial margarine instead of butter.  Tasted great to all of us. :>

I was really hoping for the best when I made this toffee. I followed instructions to a "T". I stirred non-stop until the sugar was golden and nuts were toasted and toffee mixture still turned out very grainy/chewy.

Once I spread the chocolate on top, I placed in the fridge overnight to speed up the hardening process. While the toffee did harden, the grainy texture was still there. We had to throw it out.

Now maybe there was something I did wrong, but after comparing to other toffee recipes, I think this one may be too sugary and perhaps lacking additional instruction.

I followed the directions and wasn't that impressed.  The first thing my husband said was, "It looks funny".  And it did, I cooked it and checked the temp, but it stayed a very light color, not the deep caramel color we were looking for.  It tasted ok, but it did not have the deep buttery taste either.  Mabye becuase it was white sugar instead of brown?  I won't give it as gifts like I was going to. I will probably send it with hubby to work, they eat anything.  I will keep looking for another recipe though.

I guess I should have read the other reviews before attempting...I just threw out a double batch of this mess.  Very oily, and I cooked it for MUCH longer than 15 minutes, but it never did set up.  Would not make this again!  Have used much easier recipes with success!

The toffee tasted good, however as the other reviewer stated, the toffee was soooo oily. Butter pooled around the whole pan.  I wonder if the butter quantity was correct.

I added 1 tbsp corn syrup and cooked it on high for 6 minutes stirring occasionally to keep the bottom from burning.  It turned out great!

This is something my mother made every Christmas.   I had never made it myself but took a chance and tried it.  Turned out perfectly!   I only had unsalted butter so I added salt while melting the butter, otherwise I followed it exactly and it turned out perfectly.  Thank you for making my Christmas special.

Love the recipe! Butter and the pan make a huge difference. Not margarine. My mom always had the same pan ( which I inherited) it's a heavy club pan. Don't use a Teflon pan.

It was very thick, almost a challenge to bite into.  The recipe says not to spread on the baking sheet.  Next time I make this, I will warm my cookie sheet allowing the toffee to spread thinner.  The taste is FABULOUS,  I covered the melted milk chocolate with chopped walnuts.

This was by far the easiest candy I have ever made.  I didn't give it 5 stars simple because it did not tell me what temperature to cook the sugar mixture to but I looked at a similar recipe and found 285 was the magic number.

Didn't turn out right for me. Looks like just butter. I even added extra almonds because the edges weren't quite filled out with almonds. It tastes more like what it is: butter, sugar, chocolate, nuts;  and not what I expected it to taste like (toffee).

It never got brown, like a paper bag! Mine came out a sort of tan! But I put Cashews in mine cause I can't chew Almonds! It tastes more like nut brittle! I don't really care how it looks cause it really tastes good! Thank you for sharing your recipe! Later Gator

Every Christmas I make this toffee and I double it! I follow Mommy from Seattle's tips and it turns out perfectly! Sometimes its hard to find slivered almonds but you can find them at a natural foods store.  I love this recipe for gift giving along with almond biscotti.  DONT change a thing!

I melted the chocolate and aded it immediately after pouring the toffee into the baking tray. It didn't go well. Instead of layering on top of the toffee, I ended up with a toffee and chocolate swirl. Next time, I will either add solid chocolate chips on top of the toffee as the directions say, or let the toffee harden a little before pouring the chocolate. But it's still delicious!

Super easy and delicious. I made it in a non-stick pan and didn't have any trouble with it being oily. I followed the recipe exactly and it worked great. I just kind of took a guess on how "golden" the sugar was to get. It probably could have gone slightly longer to get more of a caramel flavour but I was worried about burning it and forgot to grab my thermometer. It came out with the correct consistency and broke apart nicely.

I have made this recipe in the past and it has turned out beautiful. I have always put in the almonds at the very end, say about 30 seconds before the temp reaches 300, (which should be included in the recipe for those that do not know the hard crack temp). This time I added the almonds about half way through and as I suspected, they burned.  Also I had the separation issue but it was still cooking and it eventually came together before the hard crack stage. But I really suggest adding in your almonds near the end of the cooking process to prevent scorching or burning.  It's still edible, but just has a slightly burned/scorched taste.

This is THE BEST toffee and so easy to make.  I've even doubled it because we wanted more the second time!  I'd suggest adding twice as many almonds and add some to the chocolate after it's been spread.   
Also, it takes about 30 minutes to melt the sugar, butter and almonds to the desired color.  Muscle up because your arm does get a workout!  That's fine though; this recipe is an unbelievable crowd pleaser!
P.S.  This is the first time I've ever rated a recipe!

This is the first time I’ve made English toffee without corn syrup and it makes a huge difference. The butter just separates from the candy mixture. Very odd. Plus it bubbles and splatters a ton and I got burns from it.

Ok here’s how it’s really done! Double the ingredients! Cook to 285 deg, constantly storing with a wooden spoon! add the nuts of your choice! I used chopped walnuts and pecans, and a 1/2 tsp almond extract, constantly stir until you reach 295 deg then pour into your buttered pan, let cool for a few min then top with a mixture of milk chocolate chips and semi sweet chocolate chips, cover with foil until chips are soft enough to spread, then top with more nuts if you desire. Turns out fabulous!

This turns out great but the instructions are not really complete.  That's the only reason I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5.  You need to use a candy thermometer and it needs to reach between 310 and 315 degrees to make sure that the texture is correct.  Also it takes longer than 15 minutes to reach that point.

I've made this toffee recipe many, many times. Sometimes the butter separates a little at the end, but I just drain it off and it still tastes great. I followed it to a T this time (with the exception of  doubling  it and adding nuts to top instead of in batch), and it still separates at the end.  (Maybe my candy thermometer is a little off? Or maybe I should use less butter if doubling...not sure). Anyway I was going to give this a 4 star but I've made it every Christmas season for the past six years since I found the recipe, so I think that deserves 5 stars because it must be doing something right.

I have now made 12+ batches of this recipe. Of them, it only turned out for me 2 times. The other times it separated. I have read ALL the reviews, I have tried ALL the different measurements, also the tricks for trying to get the toffee to reincorporate. I have tried on clear days, dry days, and various other weather types. And nothing is working. I don’t usually struggle with cooking or baking, but for whatever reason, this recipe is not working for me. I’m done and searching for a new one. Good luck to everyone else, and if someone has an idea that is not already listed here, I’d be open to learning.

This is a good recipe for a butter toffee. I don't finish it the way the recipe suggest with chocolate and almonds. I usually mix in peanuts or whatever other nut variety I'm in the mood for. This makes a great candy.

Excellent! I made this with the help of the last reviewer suggesting to melt butter sugar and water together along with that extra tbsp of water and the light corn syrup. Definitely a must so there's no sugar residue remaining. Needed to make another batch because after posting this on fb my neighbor wanted it - all of it Lol. This is so easy and quick :) a fool proof recipe that totally melts in your mouth-AaaaMazing!

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  I like my toffee more buttery so I use equal parts butter and sugar.  You will also want to use more water (I use 1/4 cup to 1 cup sugar) so that the the toffee hardens more slowly.  I make toffee every Christmas and it is ALWAYS damp where I live, so I thought I'd share some tips:  1) Always make sure toffee is a full 310 degrees (hard crack stage) before pouring!  300 is OK in dry weather, but go hotter if it's damp.  Otherwise it will be gummy.  2) in damp weather, transfer to the fridge to set as soon as you can.  The toffee will "sweat" a bit so Blot it with a paper towel once it's hardened.  3) store in air-right containers, preferably in the fridge.

1 c sugar, 1 c butter, 1/4 c water, pinch of salt and about 1/2 tsp vanilla once cooked.  I made 4 batches today, using various nuts in each.  Very good and easy.  Kept heat (on gas cook top) between medium and medium low using an iron skillet.  It took about 15 minutes, stirring frequently.  Poured in a lined 9 X 13 pan, patted some nuts in, sprinkled with chocolate chips, spread once melted and topped with more nuts, again pressing nuts into chocolate.  Once the color becomes brown it will thicken like a roux.  That is when I took it off heat.  Will make this again very soon.  Also I used more nuts than called for.

My mom used to make this recipe every Christmas. It took me a few attempts to get the hang of it, but this recipe is perfect. The trick is to keep your heat LOW and  use a good stainless steel pan. This way you don't have to stir as much and that will keep the sugar and the butter from separating. You should only have to stir toward the end every few minutes or so. Do not stir constantly. Don't worry it won't burn. Just let it do it's thing.

I used a cast iron pan, stirred constantly but it turned into a sugary crumbly mess.  Maybe I should have cooked longer. I noticed at around 280 deg that the texture changed. Not sure I will try again unless I have more information.

It's a wonderful recipe. Took several attemps to get it just perfect, but even the first versions were really good.
Worked best for me adding the water and corn syrup and salt. Covered it with chocolate chips and pecans.

Love this recipe! I melted the butter, added the sugar, water and the almonds stirring constantly on low heat. I set my thermometer to alert me once the temp hit 300 degrees then I added a little vanilla and some sea salt before pouring it into a jelly roll that I had sprayed with cooking spray and lined with parchment paper. Pure perfection!

First time making toffee. This was easy and turned out great. I didn't  have almonds but had pistacios.  Used them, chopped in the toffee and on top after I put the white and milk chocolare chips on and spread. See many variations you could do and will next time. I did what the recipe said to do as far as the instructions. Next time I thnk I will try the no stir method as some of the reviews suggested.

Tried this recipe today for Christmas. Read the reviews and followed the recommendations others made. My batch came out oily, separated from the chocolate when it chilled and I cut it, and had a ton of butter pushed off to the side of the pan. I'm going to try the corn syrup next time and see if that corrects the problem.

I followed the recipe exactly - even while it was raining cats and dogs outside - and it was perfect! I didn't use a non-stick pan because I noticed that even on fudge,that's not a great ideal.

I have made English Toffee many times before, but thought I would give a different recipe a try.  BIG mistake!  While this recipe was edible, it did not taste like the English Toffee I know and love.  After the sugar hardened, there was a lot of oily substance in the pan, I suspect from all the butter. It didn't turn out like something you could hand out without napkins or package up and give as gifts because it was way too greasy, and frankly, didn't taste all that much like English Toffee.  I was disappointed.

I love this recipe, it is simple and I usually have the ingredients around the house already. I have made it with and without out the almonds, you really can't tell the difference. I have also added a pinch of salt to bring out the flavor a little more.This toffee is especially good when dipped in white chocolate.
This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Careful after throwing the almonds in, once they start to toast, they cook very quickly.  Mine are a little too toasty.  Would make again, thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great - even without the nuts.  I made a second batch on a stove that I know doesn't keep a constant temperature, and it didn't cook as well, but still tasted great.

The key was to find the right heat and stir, stir, stir.  On the second try, I found that exactly at medium worked well; It started to smoke a hair and I pulled it off the heat right away.

I used sliced almonds and that was a mistake. They are so thin that they burned quickly, giving the entire toffee a burnt taste.  But even aside from that, it just wasn't all that exciting to me.  My kids said it just tasted like sugar and my husband asked if the chocolate was ever going to harden.  Don't think I'll try again.

I followed the instructions in MommyFromSeattle's review, and it turned out fantastic! I may never have to buy another Heath bar!

I have never made candy before and this was my first attempt. According to instructions I was supposed to butter a 10x15 pan, which I did. When I poured the candy, it did not fill the whole pan, only about half of it. I didn't try to spread it any thinner. After about a half hour of cooling, i noticed liquid butter all over the pan. I removed the candy which was pretty firm then to a cooling rack and placed the cooling rack in the fridge to finish setting up. About an hour later the chocolate was firm and we broke the candy into pieces and despite the minor mishaps, it tasted excellent!  Even my kid's dad who isn't a toffee fan tried it and he actually liked it!  I just thought it would make a larger amount based on the size pan called for and didn't expect the pools of butter.

I LOVE hard toffee. I used dark chocolate instead of milk. It was perfect but does take a long time to make. It took me a long to get the toffee temperature up to the "hard ball point". I believe around 275F. It was totally worth it.

I love toffee but I finely chop pecans instead of the almonds which I sprinkle on top of the chocolate.  I use three Hershey's milk chocolate bars in place of the chips.  I lay the milk chocolate bars on top of the hot sugar mixture in the jelly roll pan.  They melt within a minute and I just spread the chocolate to completely cover the sugar mixture.  I immediately generously sprinkle the chopped pecans on top.  It tastes just like Butter Nut Crunch which I love!

Absolutely delicious. When I poured it, there was excess butter on the sides, but it's supposed to set that way. I may try one half cup less next time though. This was a HUGE hit with my family and friends!

This was my first time attempting to make toffee, and it came out okay.  I followed LCDOYLE's comments about halving the amount of butter, and other reviewers comments about not using non-stick pans.  I used an aluminum stock pot and reduced the butter to 1/2 cup, and melted butter "oil" still pooled up around the sugar as it was caramelizing, but eventually mixed in as it turned the toffee-apple, light brown color it was supposed to.  I tasted a few bits that hardened on my spoon and it was tasty, but grainy.  I think it would've been helpful to include the ideal candy temperature on this recipe, since there seems to be a lot of "wiggle room" for making mistakes by trying to guess when it's done simply by looking at the color.  My first attempted batch of this toffee ended up burning.
