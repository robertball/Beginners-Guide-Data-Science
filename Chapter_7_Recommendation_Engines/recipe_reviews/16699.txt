Great, easy recipe.  My outdoor grill is closed up for the season, and I didn't want to get my stove top all greasy using the grill pan.  So after marinating the fish for 4 hours, I put the fish in a glass dish, poured the marinade over and put it in a 400 degree convection oven for 20 minutes, GREAT.  Putting it in the oven with the marinade gives the fish a glaze.  Delicious!! Thanks

Don't throw the marinade out!!!  Put the marinade in a saucepan with a couple of tablespoons of dry white wine and simmer for about 5 minutes.  Drizzle on the salmon - just makes it even better.

We use this recipe ALL THE TIME!  The marinade is fine for a few hours, but the flavor is best when you marinade overnight.  I let it soak in a plastic zip bag rather than a covered dish.  So easy!  If you're missing one or two ingredients, it's usually still very good.  I often make it with canola oil rather than peanut oil, and it's just as good IMO.  I make this for others and share the recipe often.

Probably my favorite recipe from this site....seriously.

I baked mine instead of grilling, and it had a very appealing aroma.  Delicious taste also. I reduced the cayenne in half because I don't like hot seasonings.  It was very flavorful.  My husband loved it.

This was excellent. I marinated it overnight and broiled instead of grilled. I poured the marinade over the salmon before broiling and it made a nice think glaze. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. As a side I served "Spinach and Orzo Salad" and they went very well together.

Great salmon recipe but we all agreed that it was way too spicy.  Next time, I will cut the red pepper flakes back to 1 tsp.  I agree with other reviewers that it would probably be better if it was marinated at least 8 hrs., or preferrably overnight.  I wrapped mine in foil and placed on the grill and it took approximately 15 mins. at med. heat for a 1" thick piece to cook.  Thanks, Christine!

Wow, My first Superb success at grilling fish !!!   I marinated the salmon for 24hrs. and used about half of the red pepper.  I should have used all of it.  The taste was phenominal but I personally would have been able to handle more of a kick.  Served this with grilled, Basil Shrimp (allrecipes), a pasta salad, green salad, and grilled pineapple (brushed slices with a combo of butter,honey,lemon juice, brown sugar) and ice cream for dessert. This was a Mother's Day hit and a definite Do Over!!

Delicious!  My husband isn't usually very keen on fish but  proclaimed that this was the best fish recipe we've ever made.  Just get a nice fresh cut of salmon and you can't go wrong.  I followed the recipe to a tee (except canola instead of peanut oil) for the marianade, and  reserved the leftover marianade to thicken on the stove with a dash of honey to serve on/with the fish.

Just got done eating this for dinner.  It was yummy!  I just need to remember to set the grill very low because the sugar content tends to burn easily.  I used on flash frozen filets and we all loved it!  I will make this again.  Update:  this has become a staple and I make it often.  It is good!!Thanks Christine.

I followed this recipe to a tee & it was good but to be honest, I prefer the Grilled Salmon I (from this site) recipe I made last week. I served it w/ corn on the cob w/ parmesan parsley butter, herbed mushrooms in white wine (from this site) & finished it off w/ pineapple orange sorbet (also from this site).

My son came for dinner the night I tried this and he declared it restaurant quality.  (I'm pretty sure he meant gourmet restaurant - not Long John Silvers.) My husband and I thought it was excellent also, even though I made one change that was, in retrospect, a big mistake.  I know this is called "Firecracker" salmon, but 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes really scared me so I decreased the amount to 1/2 teaspoon.  As I said, big mistake.  Next time, I'll be brave and try 1-1/2 teaspoons!  The best advice I have to offer on this recipe, besides not scrimping on the red pepper flakes, is DO NOT substite another oil for the peanut oil.  I had never cooked with peanut oil before, always substituing another oil.  This time I decided to bite the bullet and buy a rather expensive, unrefined peanut oil that requires refrigeration after opening. What an amazing aroma of roasted peanuts wafted out of that little bottle when I unscrewed the lid. I'll never substitute again.

It was great. Our neighbors have a pool and invited us over for dinner. I offered to bring all the food and cook on their grill.  Who could pass on that offer.   I had the cold leftovers for breakfast.    I only marinated for 3 hours or so, but the salmon fillet was not that thick.  Also, I am careful to pull out ALL the pin bones so the kids will eat it.  That process leaves the flesh a little beat up at places for the marinade to get more surface area.  The recipe says to flip the fish, that's crazy talk.   I only cook with skin side down. I pull the fish when it's still pink inside, then remove the fish wrap it in foil to let the steam finish cooking without any loss of moisture.

This is absolutely the most fabulous salmon recipe I've ever tried.  My husband, a confirmed salmon hater, LOVES this dish.  I do add a tablespoon of honey to the marinade, and I cook it on the grill, brushing with the marinade frequently.  (If you do this, make sure you bring the marinade to a boil after removing the raw fish.)  I make this every couple of weeks.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Great marinade, and like some others, after I took the salmon out I simmered the marinade for a few minutes both for safety and to thicken it to use as a sauce later.  I cooked my salmon in a hot cast iron skillet on stove top for about 3 minutes per side and it came out perfect.

It is no wonder that this is one of the most popular recipes on this site!  It is wonderful with so many layered flavors. I marinated the fish for ten hours.  I baked four 6 oz filets at 400 for 15 minutes and then broiled them on high for 5 minutes. I boiled the marinade until it reduced and became a glaze. They rested for 2 before I glazed them and plated them with jasmine rice and steamed asparagus.  Dessert was roasted pears with caramel sauce, also on this site.  Fine meal!

From the reviews, I expected this to be simply extraordinary, but my husband and I were both disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used our George Foreman Grill instead of an outdoor grill (we don't have one), so perhaps that was the problem?  It wasn't that it didn't taste good, but that we have other salmon-recipes that are much more flavorful.  I did like the slight sweetness from the brown sugar, though, and will add that to our favorite recipe.

I followed the reciepe to a T but instead of putting it on the grill I used a grill basket so when I turned it it wouldn't stick.  Came out perfect.  We just loved it.  I'm thinking that the next time I will smoke it.  Also brined it overnight.

Really good.  I think next time I will add more red pepper flakes for extra kick.  Also, make sure to use ALASKAN salmon, just like the recipe dictates.  I couldn't find two Alaskan salmon fillets, so I used one Alaskan and one farm raised.  Not surprisingly, the Alaskan fillet was far, far superior.  Thanks!

I've been making this so many times. It has been my favorite salmon recipe. It is sooooooooo good. I've used rice vinegar instead few times, but each time came out perfectly. I would not grill salmon any differently. A+++

This marinade has wonderful flavor.  Next time
I will be sure to marinate overnight and will also wrap the fish in foil with some of the marinade and cook it on the grill that way.

Super yummy!  Made with fresh ginger and subbed Apricot preserves for brown sugar.  Marinated for 2 hours and baked 
(with marinade) at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Ended up with perfectly cooked salmon with a fabulous glaze.  Super easy. Super quick. Super duper!

We have made this time and time again - and never change a THING!  It is the BEST!  I even marinated a few pounds of the salmon and then put them in individual serving sizes in freezer bags for my father.  This way he can let them thaw in the fridge and grill up his portions as needed (mom won't eat salmon).  My 9 year old grilled our last batch for us and boy was he PROUD!

I've been eyeing this recipe for a long time now, and finally decided it was time to give it a try.  I didn't have any salmon so I used the marinade on chicken tenders.  I didn't have the green onions or ginger, but I don't think it compromised the taste.  I used my broiler since my grill is surrounded by snow...and had great results.   We had this over rice along with pan fried asparagus also from this site.  Thanks Christine.

If I could give it 10 stars I would! I marinate mine in a gallon freezer bag and save the marinade.

To get the most flavor in the salmon I flip the steak halfway through cooking and peel the skin off.  Then drizzle remaining marinade over that.  Really great salmon!!!

I made it for the weeknight supper to go along with cooked rice and stir fried vegetables. The recipe uses 'everyday ingredients' and easy to follow. 
I'll keep coming back to this recipe for sure.
By the way I didn't marinate my salmon just because I didn't have time before hand.I just mixed all the ingredients and pour it on top of salmon fillets and baked it for 24 min in 400F oven.

WOWEE!
This recipe gets 5 stars from me as it is easy, quick, and delicious! My finicky daughter tried this recipe in her cooking class at school and came home raving on this recipe.  I knew this would be a hit so I quickly researched the recipe and duplicated it at home.  She was right as this recipe is delicious, easy and a definite crowd pleaser.  A special “shout out” for Christine L for sharing this recipe!

This was absolutely wonderful!  However, I made a few changes.  First we used chicken instead of salmon.  Then instead of grilling it, I put the chicken and all the marinade in a 9X13 glass dish and baked it in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes.  It turned out fantastic!  I will definately make this again!

I'm not a fan of salmon so I used this marinade on both chicken and tilapia and marinated for 8 hours.  I also had to sub olive oil in place of peanut oil since I didn't have any in the house.  The chicken was good but the tilapia was CRAZY GOOD!  This marinade definitely lends itself more to fish than to meat/chicken.  We LOVED it!!!  My husband fought me for the leftovers and took them to work today.  I didn't agree with previous viewers that they cut down the spice because it was too spicy.  I like spicy food and would definitely increase the red peppers next time to our personal tastes.  You can't go wrong with this marinade on most fish.  This was outstanding!  Thanks for sharing!

Due to the rain, I baked it skin side down at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  It was a tad too long (or too high heat) for the 1" thick filets I was using.  I marinated the salmon for 8 hours.  The taste was very good and different, rather hot and sweet.  The marinade thickened in the oven to create a nice glaze on top of the filets.  I used EVOO instead of peanut oil, and chopped onion instead of green onion.  Will make again.

This is my new favorite salmon recipe.  I absolutely love it.  I marinated the fish overnight, baked at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes instead of grilling, and had the most flavorful, moist,tender, non-fishy-tasting salmon ever.  Thank you, Christine, for submitting this fabulous recipe!

I made this for a BBQ and it turned out great.  I doubled the marinade, marinated overnight and used extra green onions.  I will definitely make this again...  After our BBQ I got a call from a guest saying that this was the best salmon he's ever had!

This is the best salmon I've ever had and I've tried it all!  It's especially good if you let the salmon marinade overnight.  As usual in my cooking, I add a few extra cloves of garlic.  I receive many compliments for this dish and I've turned salmon-haters into salmon-lovers thanks to this one!

Very nice.  I used Sriracha instead of red pepper flakes and left out the salt, soy sauce made it plenty salty, otherwise I kept to the recipe.  It doesn't need that much oil, I think I'll halve it next time.  Also I think I would prefer fresh ginger to ground in this.  I had very small, thin salmon pieces and I only marinated them for about 3 hours.  Worked fine, but I can see a longer marinade would be better.  I made two servings and broiled the fish in the toaster oven.  Like others said, I can definitely see this being great on chicken. Served with brown rice pilaf and roasted asparagus.

One of the best salmon recipes i have had.  I used fresh ginger since i had it on hand.  The salmon was so moist and tasty.  Definitely a keeper and would be great for company.  The key is not over-cooking the salmon.  We grill the salmon skin side down and do not flip.  Usually, when the salmon easily separates from the skin it is done.

This was so easy & exceptionally good.  I did substitute olive oil for the peanut/sesame oils & I didn't marinate it for hours.  The salmon only marinated for maybe 5 minutes.  I didn't grill it - I cooked it on the stovetop in an iron skillet sprayed with pam.  Still, it was wonderful.  The salmon cooked in less than 5 minutes & then I added chopped broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts & sugar snap peas & stir fried them with a little of the salmon sauce.  Yum.  This one's a keeper!

I made this recipe yesterday for a large group, 12 people.  In short, this is an OUTSTANDING recipe.  However, allow me to share my suggestions that might make your attempt at this winner turn out as exceptional as mine did.  Since all I could find at the local stores were frozen Salmon steaks I decided to go with 3 full Salmon fillets.  Time constraints did not allow for me to thaw the frozen Salmon Steaks.  I got the Salmon from Costco which is a decent quality Salmon.  My biggest concern with the directions was the part about grilling the Salmon.  I love grilled Salmon, but I was worried that most of the marinade would simply fall off the fish in the process.  So, in an attempt to save the marinade from certain doom what I did was after marinating for about 5 hours I laid the Salmon out on tin foil that I had doubled up for added strength.  I then rolled the edges to trap in the juices leaving the top open forming what I could only describe as a boat.  I placed them all on a preheated grill and cooked them with the lid down at about 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  These were three 3.5 – 4 pound Salmon, so it needed a little longer to cook through.  Your cooking time may vary slightly depending on the size Salmon you use, but when the fish is flaking apart and white in the center it is done.  Let me tell you…the marinade sort of caramelized slightly and formed a nice coating over the entire fish.  The taste was out of this world!  This is one recipe I will definitely keep fore

I thought that this was great.  I had to make 3 simple changes, though.  I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, so I used lemon juice.  I didn't have hours to marinate it, so I left it for about 40 minutes, which is how long I normally marinate my fish.  Finally, it was too cold here to use the grill, so I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes.  It turned out great.  I will definitely be making it again, and I can't wait to try it on the grill.  Thanks!

We just had this for dinner with rice and steamed broccoli. So very delicious. My dad took one bite and said, "Wow, this is really great!" I scaled it for 2 servings and made it as written. I marinated it in a glass baking dish, skin side up, for about 9 hours. I took Debsdolls' recommendation, and baked it in my convection at 400 for 20 minutes. Perfect. It might be even tastier marinated overnight! Will definitely make again, and will try the marinade with chicken and other fish. Thanks for a really good recipe.

Excellent recipe. A huge hit with everyone. I was a little skeptical when I first mixed all of the ingredients together, but I marinated overnight and it was WONDERFUL coming off the grill. Have added this to the permanent rotation. Thanks!!!! Also used on other types of meat - great on London Broil!

My most favorite salmon recipe ever!  Sometimes I bake the fish instead of grilling.  When I do, I reduce the amount of oil in the recipe.  It comes out great.

I broiled this for 10 minutes (5m each side) and poured the marinade over the fish as it cooked. Came out great with the marinade beautifully carmelized. I'd probably double the marinade recipe next time though. Best fish I've ever had.

I have made this recipe 7 or 8 times now. Anytime I get salmon, I think about doing this recipe. I do not use the peanut oil and green onions. I probably use 1 tbs of sesame oil for the other oil. It turns out amazing every time. The best thing is the leftovers are good cold so put it over a nice fresh salad.

This was very good.  Hubby even liked it.  I need to remember to scrape pepper flakes off before grilling - hubby kept thinking he was hitting fish bones. Was out of peanut oil , so subbed olive oil. I grilled on cedar planks using indirect heat - took about 30 minutes.

This is an awesome recipe! I've tried lots of fish recipes in general and lots of salmon recipes specifically. I do like flavor in my fish and I love a hint of spice without being overwhelmed and forced to down 16 ounces of water per bite. This recipe is a perfect mix of spice and fish flavor.

I didnt believe all the great reviews of this marinade for salmon,  But it blew me away!  All these reviewers have excellent taste (clearly you'll agree after you make this) I too omitted the red pepper for the kids; and they cleared their plates. (would have licked them if I allowed it) Also, only had 2 hrs to marinate but it was plenty of time; don't know how people let them sit all night in it.

Sweet & spicy is one of my favorite combinations!  I looked up this recipes a couple of years ago and have used a variation of the ingredients for almost every marinade since.  I usually increase the garlic, ginger & onion  (have substituted shallots) and decrease oil.  I've also broiled and it retains more of the marinade flavor although grilling adds a bit of smoke and I'm sure a healthier option.

Very good.  Served it with saffron rice, salad dressed with balsamic vinegarette, grilled portabella caps and French bread.  Can't wait to make it again.  Next time I will double the marinade and reduce it before serving the meal.  Grilling the salmon is a must!

Fantastic... I crave this dish all the time!  After trying both ways, I prefer olive oil to peanut oil.  Also, try substituting bottled teriyaki sauce instead of soy for extra zing.  Works great on the Foreman grill (the high heat carmelizes the marinade... yum.)

Wonderful marinade. I did only use 1 tsp. of the pepper flakes, and fresh ginger. I love the sweet and spicy crusty coating on my moist flaky salmon. I always save the leftover marinade and cook on the stove top with a bit of cornstarch for a nice glaze to baste with. We served with Mushrooms with a Soy Sauce Glaze on Allrecipes.

Loved this marinade, only change I made was to reduce the sesame oil to 1/2 tsp. 2 tsp red pepper sounded like a lot but it turned out perfect, everyone really enjoyed the salmon, thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome!!! Really good. Its the first time we ever cooked fish on the grill. It was easy & tasty. I couldnt find peanut oil at the store, so I used olive oil & it was still yummy.

This is our favorite salmon recipe. I substitute 1 Tb olive or vegetable oil for the peanut oil - we didn't like the flavor and the recipe doesn't need it.

I served this with mahi mahi instead of salmon and it was awesome.    Served it at a dinner party for 10 and everyone was amazed how good it was.   Even those who weren't thrilled to see fish as the main entree.   I doubled the recipe and towards the end I put some of the marinade in a sauce pan, mixed 1T water with 1T of cornstarch then added to the marinade, heat until thick and service over or under the fish when serving.  Yummy!

This dish was fantastic, although I used 1/2 c sesame oil in place of the peanut oil. Due to the strong flavor of sesame oil, I was concerned it was a big mistake. However it didn't overpower the wonderful soy-balsamic blend, maybe because I marinated for 4 hours. Once the fish were grilling, the remaining marinade was boiled for 2 minutes with an additional 4T of balsamic vinegar and a 1/8 cup of chicken stock. Heat turned down, the sauce reduced slightly for ~10 min to allow the flavors to concentrate. The sauce was drizzled over the plated grilled salmon and red potatoes (made using A/R recipe Quick and Easy Grilled Potatoes). This recipe gets 5 stars because my changes should not reflect on the recipe as written. Will use this again!

This Salmon was amazing!!!I made it for my mom on mother's day and she loved it. My sister thought she would not like it, but she loved it also. Instead of the clove garlic you can use garlic powder. Everyone needs to try this salmon.

Excellent recipe for salmon!  I had fresh Lake Superior salmon and did it in foil packets on the BBQ.  The only thing I changed was I used olive oil in place of peanut due to a childs nut allergy....still it got rave reviews!  Thanks for a great addition to our summer BBQ line-up!

I've made this at least 20 times (maybe 30). This is the best salmon I've ever had and my family asks for it. You should not make this if you can't make it on the grill because the carmelization of the grill is what makes it so good.

Phenomenal!  I marinated for four hours and as one reviewer suggested, I put it in the oven on 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  I lined a glass baking dish with aluminum foil to save time on cleanup.  The salmon was juicy and full of flavor.  I served it with rice and corn on the cob.  My very picky eater hubby even approved.  Give this a try!

I cooked this recipe twice and my Norwegian in-laws loved it! I baked it for 30 mins. I marinate it overnight for the first time I tried this recipe and for the second time marinated it for just one hour. It turned out the same taste! Yummy!!

This marinade was the best I've ever had. I saved it and boiled it down to make a sauce to spoon over the salmon after it was grilled, because I didn't have time to marinate it for 4 hours. I served it with grilled asparagus and rice pilaf for a wonderful summer dinner. All of my guests raved about the great taste and combo of everything. Thanks so much!

I cooked the salmon on the outdoor grill, first placing the fish between a grilling basket, which prevented it from sticking or losing flavor. This recipe was so flavorful! Tip: i use the frozen costco salmon since they are thick slices and come out very juicy. I've tried using store bought fresh salmon and did not get the same results. Make sure your pieces are thick for best results.

I've been trying new recipes for salmon ever since moving to Alaska 18 years ago and my husband and I both agree that this is our favorite.  I followed the recipe except that I substituted about 1 Tabl. of fresh ginger for the powdered ginger. The first time that I tried this I only used 1 tsp. of pepper flakes but we felt no heat so I've since used 2 tsp. and it is just right...not too spicy at all.  Edit:  I boil the leftover marinade for at least 5 minutes and serve with the salmon.

My husband loved this recipe.  I used the one teaspoon of red pepper flakes that was recommended by a lot of people.  I also used 1 tablespoon of minced fresh ginger instead of the powdered ginger.  It was also good on chicken.  Half of our house likes fish, half does not, so I split the marinade between salmon and chicken.  I baked the salmon for 15 minutes at 375 degrees and the chicken for 20 minutes.  It was perfect!

This is the best asian inspired marinade my family has ever had!  I followed the recipe with a substitution of olive oil, and marinaded for about 4 hours.  As an extra treat, try to add some raw peeled shrimp into the marinade dish, skewer them for the barbeque and serve with the salmon meal!  I can hardly wait to try chicken with this marinade!
thanks

EXCELLENT!  I added a few good dashes of tobasco to the marinade and when I put the filets in the grill basket I topped them with a bit more of the marinade.  My husband was very pleased, and even my kids ate and liked it!  Served with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes suggested by another user and a mixed greens salad.  VERY GOOD!

Oh yeah!  This recipe delivered very yummy salmon.  What a great marinade.  I made only two (slight) modifications:  I used canola oil (no peanut oil in the house) and reduced the amount of red pepper flakes by 1/4 tsp.  Fantastic!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!  This deserves a 5 star plus!!!  The salmon was absolutely fantastic!  My father went fishing in Lake Michigan and so we had a lot of salmon to eat.  We were going to try several recipes but never got past this one!  I am not really a fan of spicy things but the amount of pepper in this is just right.  We had it for dinner 2 times in one week and everyone went back for seconds!  Highly recommended!!!

This was a fantastic marinade... a great combination of flavors that would've been great on just about any kind of fish. I will probably try it out with chicken too. Very flavorful and easy to adjust the heat factor by adding a bit more red pepper if you like it spicy! Easy to make and it will make you look like a star in the kitchen!

Very flavorful. I used my Foreman grill and it worked great. I used olive oil instead of peanut oil.

This was the best salmon we've ever had.  I had forgotten about the marinade time when I started to prepare it for dinner, but, we needed to eat it that night and wanted to try the recipe. There were only two of us so I only used 1 lb of salmon. Due to lack of time, I prepared according to the recipe, but, only marinated for about 1/2 hr in a covered glass casserole dish, then grilled. It turned out excellent! We can't wait to have it again.  Thanks for a great salmon recipe!

We all loved this. My boyfriend is NOT a salmon fan but he thought this was great. We used alaskan sockeye salmon which made all the difference. I didn't grill it but broiled, wrapped in foil with tons of marinade on it. Made extra marinade to drench the salmon once it was on my plate. It was hotter than I expected, too hot for kids so my 2 yr old ate the piece I didn't marinade. I only marinated it for 3.5 hrs and it came out perfect. Will definitely make again! Oh, and I used all sesame oil instead of peanut.

This is the only recipe that my husband will eat salmon. He loves it and asks for it regularly. I have tried other fish in this marinade with varying degrees of success, salmon really benifits from this recipe.

We love salmon served any way but this marinade is great and really compliments the salmon.  I've made this for company and had rain the day it was to be grilled so I broiled it instead and it came out great that way too.  Although I do prefer it grilled.

This is great!  I marinate the salmon over night for richer, fuller flavor and baked it in the oven at 375 degrees for 20~30 mins depending on the thickness of the fish.  Served it with steamed rice and Chinese napa cabbage salad.  My husband and I both loved it.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made this for a family BBQ, and EVERY single person (including kids) wanted more!! The adults wanted the recipe. It is THE BEST salmon we've ever had! We will definitely make this again and again. I also will try it with other types of fish.

I have made this recipe countless times... I substitute always about 3 tablespoons of the peanut oil with 3 tablespoons honey & brown sugar to cut down on the fat and it was SO delicious...I also set aside some of the marinade (didn't soad the fish in it) so that I could glaze the top of the salmon with it after BBQing! Easy to make and everyone I made it for loved it!  Be sure to make enough, though, I ran out!

This was so delicious! I didn't have the green onions or the red pepper flakes but even without them this was delicious! I was also able to marinate overnight which really brought out the flavor! I reduced the oil by half since we're eating healthy, and since my husband was stuck in traffic and I don't know how to grill, I baked it at 400 for 15 minutes. Loved it. We'll be having this regularly!

I went straight by the recipe, except I used tamari instead of soy sauce(not much of a deviation), which is what I had on hand.  Marinated the fish for @4-5 hours, broiled it in the oven, and it turned out great. 
Living in the PNW, we eat alot of salmon in this house, farmed and fresh.  This will make farmed salmon good and fresh salmon great.  Served with rice pilaf and a green salad.

It definitely was delicious and spicy (not for those who can't take the heat).  I didn't change a thing but I don't grill so I baked my salmon in the 400 degree oven for 20 min.  I'll make it again.  Thanks!

My husband calls salmon "girlie food" so I usually dont fix it. I made him a pork roast for dinner and myself this salmon. I put two bites on his plate and asked him to try it... He LOVED it!! He said he would eat it again. which is all I need.

This is simply the best salmon dish I have ever had. The marinade is so tasty and the red pepper flakes give it a nice kick. We have made this several times now and love it each time! My husband now cooks it on the barbecue on a cookie sheet and that works really well -- not lost pieces through the grill!

Two thumbs up! This is one of the best salmon recipes on this site! It was very easy to make and despite the seemingly long list of ingredients, I had everything in my pantry that I needed. After letting the fish marinate for about 4-5 hours, the flavor was great without overpowering and contrary to its name, it wasn't too spicy (although it did have a mild heat). I'll definitely be making this again!

I make this at least once every 2 weeks. My 2 year old loves it! I sub old bay for the cayenne pepper to make it toddler friendly and I use fresh ginger instead of ground. Definitely let it marinate at least 4-5 hrs (it's best overnight). I broil it in the oven instead of grilling.

i haven't made this in awhile and and we have always loved it... i only marinated my salmon for 1 1/2 hours...i did bake it instead of grilling this time...and i cooked it in foil pouches at 350 for 30 min...came out dry tonight...could be the frozen salmon steaks or not enough marinating time...or cooked too long...just wanted to let y'all know...it is STILL one of my favorite salmon marinades even with a dud night... ;)

Truly great flavor!  Adjusted the recipe for two and baked in the oven, wrapped in foil for about 30 minutes at 350.  We love spicy, so I added more more crushed red pepper flakes, and a little more salt, since I used "low sodium" soy sauce.

Outstanding marinade that works perfectly with salmon.  Great combination of flavors slightly asian but a bit more robust with the red pepper and worcestershire sauce.  Made this exactly to recipe and it works perfectly.  New family favorite.

WOW! This is FANTASTIC! This might be the best recipe on the site! My changes were minor: I used fresh ginger instead of the jar kind and I added an extra clove of garlic. I also baked in the oven with the marinade for about 20 minutes. I can't wait to make this again!

Made this on a boat using an entire fresh wild salmon.. each side on a separate BBQ... fed 10 people who raved about the flavor... only thing I would change... cut back the oil to at least half.  Sesame oil is just fine as is... other is too much and I ended up spooning it out of the mixing bowl before putting on the fish..   Highly recommend this recipe !!

I grilled halibut fillets  ( 5-7 minutes per side) instead of salmon and tasted great! I saved the  marinade and heated thoroughly for about 4 minutes ( boiling) and served it on the side.

Wow. Very good and easy. The heat is a more background element, that seems to hit afterwards. Nice.

Lately few recipes get 5 stars from me, but this marinade makes some of the best salmon we've had and we eat a lot of it. I rarely marinate fish longer than a few hours, but some I left overnight was even better. If you're afraid to try that I would at least make the marinade a few hours before using. Don't hesitate to try this and to add even more crushed red pepper if you like spicy food.

The marinade and cook times for this a perfect - 5 star all the way.  I would never marinade my fish for more than an hour depending on thickness to maintain the structure of the fish.  I served this on top a bed of sauteed rainbow chard. Delicious.

I made this last night and it was a big hit!!! I followed the recipe, but marinated it over night like some said in their reviews. I broiled it (no grill in a hurricane :). I used the marinade to make a sauce, I added a 1/2 cup of wine and reduced it by 1/2 then added butter and heavy cream. The cream cut the heat just a little and gave the sauce a wonderful light flavor... I will be making this again for sure!!!!

Loved this!  I didn't have the time to marinate the fish, so I poured the marinade on top and baked in the oven.  YUM!!  Also greatly reduced the amount of oil and it didn't sacrifice the flavor at all.  A definite "make-again."

Awesome flavor. Tasted like it had a Thai kick to it. And very simple. I tried it on some tilapia fillets I had. For oil, I used only 3-4 tbsp of olive oil and baked it in the marinade at 400 for 15 min. It tasted so delicious - all the extra oil isn't necessary for a healthier version.

This really is just as good as everyone raves.  We used it on wild caught salmon...delicious!!  Used it a few nights later on Tilapia just to see...the fish stood up to the marinade, but was not as strong sweet/savory taste.  Good on tilapia, great on salmon!  Thanks!!

Excellent way to prepare salmon! We follow the suggestion (from similar salmon recipes on the site) to grill the fish with the skin up/flesh-side down first for 8-10 minutes to caramelize the sugars in the marinade and "seal in" the moist flavor of the fish, then flip it and grill for a similar amount of time.

One of the moistest and flavorful pieces of salmon I have made. My husband loves salmon (me not so much) so I am always looking for a good recipe to make. This is it! I have made it with and without the sesame oil and and onions and it has been great either way!

Scaled to 2 servings (for 2 small filets) and used full amount of red pepper flakes. Poured the marinade on and baked immediately. There was no leftover sauce. Evaporation and salmon soaked it up. Hubby is not a spicy food fan and said this was way too hot. I am a spicy food fan and would have classified this as mild to medium heat. Didn't have balsamic so used apple cider vinegar. Very tasty with a slightly reminiscent flavour of smoked salmon.

I don't have access to a grill, so I baked mine covered at 400 degrees and then broiled it for a few minutes to get a drier texture. 

I cut the pepper in half fearing that it'd be too hot, but next time I am trying the full pepper.

I let this marinate for 24 hours and the flavor was great.

happy day! this is the perfect recipe for a summer grilled meal! I just served this up to my husband and son to rave reviews. i marinated the fish for 24 hours and grilled in foil in the gas grill on low. we had fresh (15 min. out of the garden) green beans and sauted summer squash. wow! a glass of sauvingon blanc rounds out all those flavors and makes for a joyful dinner. thanks for a great keeper!

I love this recipe. I marinate whole sides of salmon overnight and roast on sheet pans until just cooked through. I can feed 300 guests absolutely delicious salmon quite easily. I make a separate batch of marinade that i cook down to a nice syrup and use that to glaze the finished salmons. They are delicious sliced cold with bean sprouts, cucumber, shredded carrot & toasted sesame seeds sprinkled with lime & sesame oil. I also love them warm with sticky rice and a few stalks of tempura'd vegetables. Thank you for this summer no-fail presentation.

This recipe is brilliant.  I am not the biggest seafood farer, but I have cooked this three times in the last month.  I haven't put it on the grill yet because it turns out so good in our convection oven after 20 minutes.  Definitely give this one a try.

WOW! I am not a Salmon fan but my husband has been begging me to cook something other than Halibut so I tried this recipe and it was over the top fantastic! Only change was that I used olive oil instead of peanut oil and let it marinate overnight. I took 2 filets out of the marinade at lunch and stuck them under the broiler for 15-20 min they were perfect on top of a salad!

delicious! i am a spicy food fanatic so i am always trying out recipes that add some heat. only had sesame oil so just used that. marinated fish for about an hour since i was running a little late. still came out wonderfully. basted fish with extra sauce half way through cooking. nice way to spice up some salmon.

Let me say, we LOVE this recipe.  I am in a cooking co-op with 5 other friends.  We meet monthly and cook for one another's families.  I'm getting ready to prepare this salmon for the 3rd time because my friends like it so much.  If you're interested in freezing it in advance, just mix all of the marinade together and thaw at your convenience.  Then pour it over the salmon fillets (I just buy them frozen at Sams Club).  It tastes incredible!  Thank you - my 4 yr old and 2 yr old sons devour this meal.  We serve w/steamed veggies, ciabatta rolls, and couscous.

Yummy yum yum!!  This recipe produces such an amazing-flavored marinade!  I thought this might be too hot, so I only used 1 tsp of the crushed red pepper.  In the end, I'm not sure an additional teaspoon of flakes would have been so bad...it's not like you're actually eating all of them.  My boyfriend loved this even more than I did - we'll definitely have this again.

This is a knock-out recipe for salmon! I'll be making it again and again. The only difference I made was I substituted fresh ginger for ground, to make sure the ginger flavor really came through. I also added a lot more garlic and a little more vinegar. Delish!

Delicious!  I have several salmon recipes and this is, by far, the best one!  I marinated it for 24 hours and then baked it in the oven for 12 minutes at 400 degrees.  The only issue was that it made the oven a bit messy.  Next time, I'll use the grill as recommended.

Very, very falvorful. I subbed the balsamic vinegar for rice vinegar. I also dusted on a blend of seasonings, including cayenne, paprika, and seasoning salt. I baked it instead, covered with foil, and it came out moist, and delicious. Great combination.

This is absolutely AMAZING!!!  I have never liked salmon but decided to give this recipe a try.  I'm glad I did.  It will now be on my weekly rotation.  Did not change a thing.  Give it a try -- you'll love it.

Wonderful!..and so easy to prepare. I prepared the marinade last night (just took about 5 mins).  Then marinated the salmon in the morning before work and had hubbie grill on medium heat for about 10 mins. I served it up with red skinned mashed potatoes and the Mandarin Asian Salad from this site. Yummy! Definitely a keeper - thanks.

I thought this was very good and a change from the maple salmon that we usually make.  I will say the marinade almost overpowered the salmon, but I guess that is a matter of taste.  i still prefer the maple salmon

This was my first fish recipe. Since I don't salmon, I substituted tilapia. I've found that I only need to marinate for 30 minutes and cook for about 12 minutes. The fish comes out deliciously.

I forgot the red pepper flakes and didn't have green onion.  I was going to put regular onion in instead, but forgot that as well.  It was still really good and I will definately make it again. Next time I'll try it with the forgotten ingredients.

Fantastic!  Not too spicy, but had a bit of a kick, and an overall very pleasing flavour.  I only had time to marinade for 2 hours, so I'm sure this would be even better if allowed to sit for the 4-6 hrs recommended.

I didn't have time to marinate the salmon so I made a glaze by altering the ingredients a little bit. I reduced the oil to 1/8 cup, added 1/3 cup water and increased the sugar by 1 teaspoon, added 1 tsp chili paste (in addition to the recommended chili amounts), and added 2 tbsp honey. I then boiled the sauce to 3/4 the recipe and glazed the salmon. I brushed half of the glaze on the salmon and saved the rest as a sauce. I then broiled it and brushed the remaning glaze over the salmon before serving. It turned out wonderfully! Although I had to make some changes due to time constraints, I very much look forward to trying the recipe as directed. We loved this! Thank you!

I was worried that this would be too hot based on other reviews but I don't know what they were talking about.  Maybe they used cayanne pepper and that was the problem. We followed the directions except for the peanut oil, I used olive oil instead.  It marinated for about 5 hours and was great.  Oh yeah, I baked it in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes since it was cold outside.  Perfect.

Just tried this last night (though we baked the salmon instead of grilling) - it was excellent. Just the right mix of spicy and sweet tastes. We also marinated a piece of tilapia with the same recipe, and it was wonderful. Really took on the flavors nicely. I will definitely add this to our list of often-made recipes!

This was delicious even though I didn't have green onions.  Even my husband, who is not too fond of salmon, enjoyed this dish.  I will definitely make this again, with the green onions next time.

I loved this recipe and I'm not a big Salmon fan. I usually find it too fishy tasting.

This was easy and delicious.  The only thing was my husband wouldn't allow me to add so much red pepper because of the kids.  They didn't eat it anyway so next time I'm spicing it up.  I followed a reviewers advice and tried it on pork (at the same time) and didn't like it.  The flavors definitely didn't come through the way they did with Salmon.
Yum!

I do not eat fish, but because of health reasons, I decided to give this recipe a try based on the reviews.  It still has a slight fishy taste, but not nearly as bad as other fishes I've tried.  I think the key was marinading it all day and grilling on the charcoal grill.

I found this very enjoyable.  Good on shrimp as well.  I make it with EVOO and on some occassions have thrown in some cilantro just because I had it on hand.

Simply amazing this is a TEN star recipe. I reduced my red pepper flakes by half (because the full amount would be way too spicey for my 2 year old) I also was only able to marinate it for 3 hours and it was still amazing. I also had to substiutue the peanut oil for olive oil due to my peanut allergy.  Thanks so much Christine.

wonderful taste...and I only had 4 hrs to marinate.  I wish I hadn't chickened out and only added 1 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes as there was NO HEAT.  Next time I will use all of the red pepper.  Trust me, I'm a recovering spice WHIMP...and if you use the 2 teaspoons this calls for, I promise it won't be too hot!

The salmon was fabulous!!  The marinade wasn't too strong, you could still taste the salmon.  Very good recipe, will be using this one for company.  I used the left overs the morning after in my scrambled eggs with cheese.  Added a little zip was great even the next day.

This is by far the BEST salmon recipe I ever had.  The marinade combination of ingredients are awesome!  If your red pepper flakes are not fresh be sure to rub them between your fingers to activate the heat.  Served with grilled veggies, this is a healthy meal that is truely something to look forward to.

This is definately a 5 star recipe. We make this salmon ALOT. My family likes things spicy, and this passes with flying colors. We always use pepper flakes that we've made from our garden. I also use jarred grated ginger rather than the dried. This marinade tastes great on shrimp, too. I've never found it to overpower the salmon. Plus, I marinate it in a ziploc bag with all the air removed. It seems to marinate faster when I don't have 6 hours to do it. Whenever I ask my kids what kind of fish they want this weekend (when my hubby grills), they always answer: Firecracker salmon! You can't go wrong with this recipe. Thank you Christine!

I marinated this overnight and threw some wood chips on the coals.  This is now my favorite way to cook salmon.  Also, try pulling the bones out of it with a needle nose pliers before you marinate it, it makes for more enjoyable eating.

after reading the comments I marinated for 8 hours, and we like things spicy, so I used all the pepper flakes, this is the best teriyaki style salmon I've ever had, it's a restaurant quality recipe.

Yum-Yum!  I would serve this recipe to company, that is how good it is.  I didn't have red pepper flakes, but I will make sure I have them the next time I make this.  The sesame oil makes the marinade absolutely delicious! I also baked mine at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Be sure to line the pan with foil for easier clean up.

I wish I could rate this higher, because it is awesome. I used canola instead of peanut oil, because it was what I had. The longer it marinates, the better it tastes. Thank you for a great recipe, Christine!

Good..It is really hard for me to give a fish recipe five stars so this one gets four.  I got a little afraid of the amount of red pepper so I really cut back on it.  I also ended up with very thick salmon cuts (approx. 2 inches) so I took anothers advice and marinated overnight.  Everything turned out good the tips and ends where the marinate had really set was the best.  I think next time I will look for thinner cuts and bump the pepper back to the recipe, but I will marinate overnight.  This one will be saved.  Thanks

This is the best salmon recipe I've come across yet!  My husband, who HATES fish (but can tolerate salmon), absolutely loved how it tasted.  I can make it as spicy as I want depending on the company.  I've always been afraid of grilling fish, but as long as you oil the grate, it doesn't stick!  Tried it on halibut too- still good.

Great recipe! I also used olive oil instead of peanut oil and I omitted the red pepper because I don't like things too spicey. I wrapped the salmon in foil and put in on the grill for 20 minutes. Fabulous!

This was great.  A nice change from the lemon pepper I usually put on salmon.  Although, a little too much soy sauce for me.  Hubby and kids ate it up.

I marinated for 30 minutes because I was short on time, but fish came out very flavorful.  I used olive oil instead of peanut oil since it was all I had.  Tasty!  This recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious and not too spicy at all.   It has a refreshingly different flavor from all the usual "terriyaki" style marinades!  We make this often!

This is my favourite salmon recipe.  I use the top piece of my broiler pan (oiled) right on the BBQ.  Just before the salmon is done I drizzle on some pure maple syrup and let it carmelize, YUM.

This salmon is fantastic.  I am always afraid my fish will stick to the grill so I barbecued it wrappd in foil with a little bit of the marinade.

This recipe is a summertime favorite but even better when smoked. As one comment suggested, the longer in the marinade, the better but add the smoke effect and omg! It's delicious!! :)

Family and guests love this!  Try using a skinless salmon for a less fishy taste. It is always a big hit with fish lovers and those that stay away from overpowering fishy flavor!

I only had time to marinate the fish for about an hour, so I cooked the excess marinade and poured it over the cooked fish.  The marinade is nice and spicy and very dynamic.  I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing! I didn't have peanut or sesame oil so I skipped them and i eyeballed the rest of the sauce instead of measuring. Also I didn't marinade the salmon, i used the sauce as a glaze under the broiler in the oven. Do not look any further, this sauce is a great compliment to salmon.

Great marinade, probably my new favorite. Omitted salt and used fresh ginger (a generous amount)and substituted  grapeseed oil for peanut oil.  I didn't have any green onions, but it really didn't seem to need those anyway.

I make this all the time! It is the most amazing marinade I have ever tried and worth the time to make it with fresh ingredients. I even use it for tofu and then make sandwiches or a stir fry with it. This is probably the only recipe I don't change at least one thing for...it is PERFECT if you ask me.

We really enjoyed this dish. I only marinated it for about 45 minutes on the counter and it was great. I broiled it in our oven because our propane tank on our grill is empty. Need to fix that immediately!

Delicious!! Made this last night and it was great. Will definitely make again. The only changes I made was to use olive oil in place of peanut oil, and honey in place of brown sugar since that's what I had on hand and also added a squirt of harissa sauce (spicy asian sauce, similar to srichacha). I was only able to marinate the fillets for about 4 hours or so. The flavor was there but faint. Next time I'll make sure I marinate longer.

Fantastic!! OMG this is sooo good. Tonight is the second time I am cooking this for dinner. The first time I only had tome to marinade the fillets for 3 hours and it came out great. Tonight the fillets will have been marinating for 24 hours. I can't wait. 
You have to try this recipe!!! 
I will be baking them in the oven. 
Thank you very much for this recipe. BF and I love it!

I used canola oil instead of peanut oil as that is what I had on hand.   This turned out pretty good...... a close 2nd behind this site's "Delicious Salmon".  I look forward to trying it with the peanut oil next time for sure.  Maybe that will be what it takes to bump into 1st place.

Delicious! I used a cedar plank to grill the salmon. It came out with excellent flavor. Did not marinate the fish for as long as the recipe says, but it still came out perfect.

This was just OK.  I removed the skin and marinated for 6 hours so it had a lot of flavor, but that flavor was mostly the soy sauce.  The other ingredients were overpowered.  If I make it again I'll cut the soy in half, as it would have been good to taste some of the other flavors.  I also don't think it needs near that much oil.  A couple tbsp. would be enough.

This recipe is delicious! I used smoked salmon fillets along with regular fillets and WOW! The flavor from the spices in the marinade combined with the smoked salmon was absolutely phenomenal.

I live next to an amazing salmon fishery in Alaska and I eat salmon every which way about once a week. This recipe rocks.  I followed it exactly.  Although I put the salmon on some tin foil and drizzled the marinade over the top.  Grilled for 10 minutes, then took the salmon off and put it directly on the grill for 5 minutes.  It worked out great.  The taste was amazing.

Barb and I thought it was excellent - grill for sure - not an oven recipe. Next time, will double the marinade, boil, and serve with the finished product. Used fresh ginger, but other than that, followed the recipe -- and agree with some, may be great on chicken, etc.

This was Excellent!  One problem we had was the peanut oil separated from the rest of the mixture when reheated so we couldn't use it to pour over as suggested.  Next time I'll try and put it through a blender to see if that works better and use a little less oil to cut the fat.

I made this recipe for the first time probably 5 years ago and have made it at least 20 times since then. It's very good. I have grilled it as well as baked it. Its better if you grill it but if you don't have a grill its still better then most salmon recipes if you bake it.

Bursts of wonderful flavor..    I only had time to marinate it for  two hours and it was still delicious.  I imagine it would be even better to marinate the full time recommended, or longer.  However, there was too much oil and I think a small drizzle would have been plenty (1/8 to 1/4 cup).  Will try  it with Red Pepper or Garlic infused olive oil vs peanut oil next time.

Forget 5 stars, this one is a 10!  I pretty much followed it exactly. Instead of 1/2 cup peanut oil, I just eyeball drizzled olive oil. (It's just my personal preference when it comes to recipes that calls for so much oil.)  Instead of ground ginger, I used fresh minced ginger.  It was smack yo momma good! Thank you so much for the recipe!

this was wonderful! as so easy too!  The flavor was amazing as well as the presentation.  I marinated for 5 1/2 hrs and broiled as mentioned from a previous reviewer.  Made with broccoli salad and a yummy baked pineapple casserole.  Sooooo good!

Made just as stated, but marinated for about 19 hours.  We loved it!!  Update:  This time, I baked it in the marinade as Debsdolls suggested--also very good.

Excellent recipe for salmon, and I am not a salmon fan at all! I have tried salmon numerous times, many different ways in a restaurant, and so far this is the only way I could eat it. The marinade adds wonderful flavor to the fish, I let this marinate for 6 hours. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone who loves salmon, or even if you don't! Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious! I only marinated about 1.5 hours and I'm not sure the salmon could have been any more flavorful. I used leeks instead of green onions, fresh ginger, and went a little lighter on the pepper flakes. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this dish!  Used evoo b/c I didn't have peanut oil.  I grilled it and then ate it the next day - I can only assume it would be even better right off the grill.  Will make again and again.

A good marinade for grilling salmon.  Didn't have green onions, but I think it still turned out alright.  Served on top of rice, and as per another comment, put the left over marinade into a pot added some honey and reduced to make a sauce.  Wasn't as spicy as the title 'Firecracker' would suggest.  Boyfriend was disappointed, but I thought it was pretty good.

I wasn't in a fish mood, so I didn't taste this, but my guests wouldn't shut up about it! I was generous with the pepper flakes and I always cut down the brown sugar, using about 1 Tablespoon for 14 fillets. Baked at 400* in the convection. Perfect!!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

This was fantastic. I made a few minor changes - 1/2 the peppers (thanks to the reviewer who suggested, my lips were still quite warm), 1/2 the peanut oil to reduce fat, and 1/2 the soy sauce (used lower sodium) to reduce overall sodium. Baked since it's cold out and poured a small amount of the cooked marinade over rice, broccoli and cauliflower... Delicious meal!

DELICIOUS.  Hit with the family, they loved it.  A little spicy, but they liked that too and so did my little 6 year old nephew which is a little on the picky side.  Definitely a keeper

It seems we constantly hear to eat "fish, fish and more fish"!  And with Salmon leading the nutritional pack I set off in search of a recipe my husband and I couldn't rationalize our way out of... ha!  My tips are:  I use Sea Salt -- great flavor.  I also used Tamari in place of Soy Sauce (it's still soy sauce, just a much smoother version).  Agave Nectar is so much easier on my blood sugar than brown sugar, and it sweetened it just fine!  And there are some that leave out the red pepper flakes, but be brave  :-)  It looks like alot, but the flakes don't make it THAT spicy, just adds to the flavor.  Thanks for a restaurant quality recipe Christine!

What an outstanding recipe!  I didn't think much of the marinade when I first tasted it, however, after letting the salmon sit in it for a few hours and then a few minutes on the grill...WOW! What a combo!

I placed the salmon and marinade in a zip loc bag for 6 hours. It was amazing! I also saved the sauce and warmed it until it boiled in a sauce pan. Drizzle the remaining hot marinade over the salmon before serving.

Great flavor! My second fish recipe and it was very successful! I agree with others, it would be best to let the salmon marinate overnight (I let it marinate about 5 hours). If you don't like spicy, I would definitely recommend reducing the crushed red pepper. A few bites had quite the kick but I enjoyed it! Also I baked the salmon for about 20 minutes, 400 degrees and it turned out great! Thanks!!

Very very very good!  Great flavor and not overpowering.  We used king salmon fillets.  Marinated them for about 7 hours. Took them out of the fridge and the marinade and let them air dry and come to room temperature for about 15 min.  Threw them on the grill and OMG!!  Absolutely fantastic.  Will use this marinade again and again.  Just complimented the fish so well.  Thanks for this one for sure!!

This was great! My kids and hubby loved it! I halved the red pepper because the kids wouldn't have liked that but next time when I make for just me and hubby I will add all of the red pepper. Great recipe thanks!

FANTASTIC!  Short Review: Stop reading and make this recipe!  Longer Review: I've never cooked salmon before, but this had all our favorite ingredients, so I picked this recipe for my first attempt.  I used all peanut oil and ground (not fresh) ginger.  I mixed all the marinade ingredients in a plastic zippy bag, dropped in the salmon, sealed it and popped in the fridge for less clean-up.  The rain kept us from using the grill last night so I baked it uncovered at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  While it was baking, I heated the left-over marinade on the stovetop and reduced it by about half on medium into a wonderful sauce.  My boyfriend enjoyed it so much he requested we have it again tonight but, with no rain in sight, it will be grilled.  Thanks for sharing!

AMAZING! I wish I could give more stars! My husband and I LOVE this salmon recipe. I just made it tonight for the first time EXACTLY like the recipe says ( would not change a thing!) except I baked in foil pouches at 375 for about 20 min.  We prefer not to grill fish in general.  This is so good and we will be making it again....SOON! Thank you so much for this awesome recipe

i only marinated the salmon for about an hour and i was too lazy to start a fire so i threw this in the oven and baked it at 400 degrees.  it was delish.  i can't wait to try it again marinated the right amount of time and on a fire, it's probably going to be out of this world!  i paired this with the spinach and orzo salad and it was a filling dinner!

Omitted the peanut oil and used 1/4 C canola instead, no green onions, reduced red pepper to 1/4 tsp and used 5 TBSP brown sugar. Baked @ 425 for 10 min then broiled x 3 min and they were perfect.

I can't cook.  I never learned and I've never been interested in learning.  With that said, I was told to bring a main dish for our department Christmas party potluck cooking contest.  This recipe looked delicious and got great reviews so I gave it a whirl.

I WON FIRST PLACE IN THE COOKING CONTEST!!!!  That is irony at its best.  If I can make this, ANYONE can make this....and EVERYONE loved it.

Alterations I made:  I marinated it over night in a ziplock bag.  I used pureed ginger instead of powdered ginger.  I used balsamic vinegar that had been aged in oak for 4 years.  I baked it (at 400F for 25min covered, 5 min uncovered).  Also, I basted it a few times for the last 10 minutes.

Additions: I left the marinade at the bottom of the glass dish and added steamed zucchini to the spaces in between the salmon.

I grilled some of these babies up for an end-of-summer BBQ, and it was well-loved by everyone. I even got one person who doesn't like fish, and one person who doesn't like spice to eat it, and they were the first to grab seconds.

This is also a great dish to prepare when camping; I've left the salmon in the marinade for about a day--we prepared everything right before we left and ate it the next night. It was super easy and a wonderful treat.

This was easily the best fish dish I have ever had.  I sent it out to all of my friends and family.  Everyone that tries it raves about it.  This is what we call in my house a definite "Do Over."  I added some white wine and reduced the marinade like some people suggested.  This was lick the plate good.

This was probably the best salmon I have ever had. I didn't have any balsamic vinegar so I just used apple cider vinegar. Next time i make it I will make it exactly as the recipe states.

Sooooooo good. I didn't have peanut oil so I used a little canola and I skimmed the oil off the top of my organic peanut butter, and it tasted great! I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes. Perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

YUMMY!!!  This was excellent, and I typically don't like fish, especially salmon. It had such a great flavor: a little sweet and a little spicy, but delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, only cutting it in half because I was feeding 2 people. I will be making this again soon. Thanks so much for a great marinade recipe!

Awesome!  I don't usually have seconds on salmon, but I did tonight!  I only used half of the red pepper flakes and my three-year-old ate it with no complaints about it being spicy, and she usually picks up on the slightest hint of spiciness.  Had a very subtle "kick" to it.  Next time I will marinate overnight.  This one's my new fave!

Good recipe. Although I would've prefer it to be a little saltier. The sesame oil really bring out the flavors of the salmon.

I used fresh wild Sockeye for this and found the flavors full and rich without overwhelming the flavors of the salmon. I didn't think it was overly spicy but my 4-year-old said it was too spicy for him.

Just got finished with dinner.  Made the marinade last night which took all of 5 minutes. Ina small bowl, stored in refrigerator overnight.  This morning at 10 am I poured marinade over the salmon and put in fridge till 430.  I then cooked it on 400 20 minutes and broiled 3-5 minutes to slightly brown top.  The only thing I did differently is used EVOO instead of peanut oil and 2 tsp chives instead of green onions.........just substitutes as I didn't have other ingredients.  Served this with mexican corn, mexican rice and Asian sugar snap peas from this site.  WENT OVER GREAT!  EVERYONE LOVED IT!! I should've used more salmon as they fought for the last piece!  KUDOS AND THANKS!!

This is my favorite salmon recipe to date! My husband isn't a huge fan of salmon (he prefers white fish) but this dish won him over! I ended up making it several times last summer. It is delicious with a side of cous cous and a crips green salad. This recipe will be on the top of my list for grilling this summer!

I made this last night. It was great. My husband loved it too. After marinated for about half an hour, I cook the salmon on a stove grill pan. I added the marinate sauce while cooking, for about 20 minutes. Salmon turned out so flavorful and juicy. I'll definitely use this recipe again and again. Thank you  Christine!!

OUTSTANDING! This will probably be the only way I make salmon from now on! The flavor was sooo good. I marinated my salmon for 2 hours. I reserved the leftover marinade, reduced it in a small sauce pan and basted the salmon while it was cooking which made a nice glaze. I also drizzled a little over the white rice I served along side. Some quickly sauteed sugar snap peas and you have a killer meal in no time! Absolutely incredible and we loved the heat from the red pepper flakes!

Easy, quick, and fantastic! I only had time to marinate the salmon for 15 minutes, so I made a dipping sauce, using all ingredients except the peanut oil. I also decreased the seasame oil to a few drops per serving. (I don't like oily dipping sauces). I also used chopped leaks (didn't have green onion on hand) and cooked them on top of the salmon on the grill. Absolutely delicious!

This recipe was awesome!  I substituted the peanut oil with extra virgin olive oil and reduced the cayenne pepper by half.  I also doubled the sauce, poured it over the fish and baked it. I made green veggies on the side and I poured the sauce over the veggies...OUTSTANDING!
The sauce could also be used for chinese recipes. Next time I will mix the fish and veggies, add some rice or noodles to the mix, pour on the sauce, and have a great Chinese dish. If you are expecting company, this is a great dish to impress with!

I tried this recipe on another type of fish and it barely edible.  Stick to the salmon and other types of meats.

Followed the recipe to a "T"!!! I was only able to marinade for 1 1/2 hours before our guests were dying of hunger.. and it turned out superbly!!  I got requests for the recipe from all guests!!!  Served with wasabi mashed potatoes and japanese zucchini+onions from this site.  Great, impressive 5**** meal.  Thanks!!

Fantastic. I have made this recipe several times now.  My 3 yr old loves it.  The only substitution I sometimes make is canola oil for the peanut - everything else is perfect, don't change.  We do usually buy a whole side of salmon (double the marinade recipe), with skin on and grill it - no need to filp.  The skin will char and the salmon will easily flake off of it.  Don't be afraid of the amount of red pepper - it's not too hot at all.

Wow - simply fantastic! Marinate overnight for a stronger flavor. This works beautifully in the broiler as well as the grill.

I didn't have any red pepper flakes so subbed cayene pepper.  Not spicy at all.  I look forward to try it with a little fire to it.  The glaze was wonderful though.  I convection baked mine at 400 for 20 mins and it was perfectly done. 
This is a keeper, thanks for sharing.

ps. the next day I ate the leftover fish and I did notice the heat from the cayenne at that time.  It was just a hint of heat and nothing painful.  Also, I cannot wait to try this on shrimp.  Reminds me of the Kung Pao Tempura shrimp at PF Changs.

I don't even bother with the measurements, just use this recipe as a guideline for the marinade. When I have people over who like things spicy, I go all out with the red pepper, but this recipe is equally delicious with just a sprinkle of red pepper for those of tamer tongue. I get raves every time (it's a standby recipe for first-time visitors to our home) and often am asked for the recipe. Thanks for posting it, it's a real keeper!

I make this salmon alot and we even did a competition with it with a little variation to it.  Needless to say, we took 4th place and it was wonderful!  We used a cedar plank and I love the flavor of a good maple glaze so we put that on for the last few minutes.  We do it without the skin because I don't like the gray :)  Thank you so much for the recipe and its certainly a keeper!!

WOW - This is delicious!  I pan seared mine for lack of grill, and loved the crust it left on the outside.  It was sweet and tangy and hot and spicy and just delicious!  Will definitely make again and again and again...

Really very good.  Easy to prepare but special enough for guests.  I used sesame oil instead of peanut, toasted sesame instead of the sesame oil and fresh ginger instead of powdered.  It could have been a little spicier and still been very good.  Although as prepared it was good for most palates.

Awesome marinade! I used this recipe on two blocks of nigari tofu, making 6 "tofu steaks" and grilled them over hickory chips in our gas grill. I reserved some of the marinade before adding the pepper and onions to make tofu for my kids who don't like spicy. Thanks for the recipe, Christine, it made my husband say, "let's have tofu again tonight!"

This was a five star recipe for both of us in our house.   We love spicy food - and loved the fact that we already had everything in our pantry/fridge to make it.   I would definitely serve it to company, too.

yum! I have made this so many times, and love it, we even ate it for breakfast with braised bokchoy. This marinade is good on tofu also, just marinate and then press out water, then grill! Make it and you will love it.

This was a good recipe however I believe the mixture was a bit too over-powering for the Salmon.  When using such a great piece of Salmon, I don't like to mask the taste.  I would probably just scale down the sauce.

Absolutely delicious! This recipe is solid, no changes needed.  It has a nice little kick to it without being overpowering.  I served it with "bacon-y bok choy" (from this website) and plain buttered long grain rice.  It was a hit with my picky husband and our 2 guests.  Thanks, will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  It was too cold to grill so I baked the salmon at 400 like other reviewers have suggested.  It had a really great flavor and a little kick.  I served it with brown rice and a simple soy veggie stir fry.  I can't wait to try it on the grill!

My husband recently went on a fishing trip on Lake Michigan and came home with a huge supply of salmon, so I have lots of chances to try new recipes.  This one was his favorite so far.  He couldn't stop talking about it.  I think the balsamic vinegar is what really made this recipe unique.  I will definitely be using this one again.  It's company-worthy.

We live on the east coast where good salmon isn't always available.  So unfortunately I often buy frozen but using this method it turns out amazing! I make the marinade, pour it into a pan and then put the salmon in flesh side down and let it marinate while it thaws.  When its fully thawed I grill it outdoors.  The taste is really great.  I've made it a few times and I like it better than any salmon that I've ordered in restaurants.  Thanks for sharing!

All I can say is WOW!!  This was fantastic!!  Marinated the salmon for 5 hours and used extra garlic and twice the amount of red pepper flakes which turned out to be perfect! I do like spicy, but it really wasn't too spicy.  Probably could have used more.  Very delicious and plan on making it again very soon.  Highly recommended!

Very good salmon.  Threw all the marinade ingredients in my blender.  Marinaded the fish overnight.  Turned out great.  Nice and spicy. Had it over the 4th of July while we were blowing off our fireworks.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Although this didn't absolutely knock my socks off, it was a very tasty marinade that made for a very moist salmon.  Because I always have these ingredients in my pantry, I'm sure I'll be making this again.  I will note, however, that I also added some veggies to the marinade and grilled them alongside the salmon (something I usually do when grilling).  I found that this was not a great veggie marinade because the sesame oil has such a strong flavor and left the veggies tasting sort of nutty.

This marinate had a good flavor, but I thought it overpowered the taste of the salmon itself.  I marinated it for 6 hours and if I make it again, I'll probably only do it for 2 hours.

I could not believe how great the taste was.  I followed the recipe exactly and held some back to pour on top of the salmon when I pulled it off the grill.   I did not have balsamic vinegar, so I used white vinegar.  I cannot imagine using another marinate for my salmon!

This is my favorite salmon recipe. Sometimes I vary the red pepper, depending on whose eating it, and I use sesame oil instead of peanut oil.

I was looking for something new to do w/ salmon and came across this recipe. I had just about 2 lbs. of fresh salmon and I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did different was I let it marinate for about 18 hrs. I don't like spicy food at all but I kept the red pepper the same and had no problem w/ the heat. I would definately make this again.

This was good, but no where near "the best". By the name and the reviews I expected to be Wowed. I marinated it 8 hours, too. It needed more flavor, a stronger marinade, or maybe the marinade needs to be used as a sauce after cooking the fish (thicken the marinade with cornstarch and simmer or something!)
Good start, though.

This was very good. We actually didn't use it on salmon, I used it on pork chops. I'll try it out on salmon tonight. I really do think this marinade can be used for any meat: chicken, pork, seafood, beef, etc.

Living in the Northwest I'm always looking for new salmon recipes--this is going to be a regular in my rotation.  The spice was really subtle but added a nice dimension to the more common sweet/soy marinades.  I couldn't find the 4 oz cuts so I just used a fillet, marinated for about 4 hours, it was perfect.  Usually I like to marinate things overnight, I think that might have overwhelmed the salmon flavor.  Even my non-fish eating kids gave this four stars.

While searching for something different to do with salmon for the barbecue I stumbled on this recipe...what a find!  I marinated 2" cubes of salmon for the afternoon then threaded the salmon with red & green pepper squares onto skewers then grilled~~perfection!  I'm glad I saved a little for dipping too!  A truly unique, pleasant meal, thank you for sharing it!

This was the 1st in a series of fish recipes I tried on this site.  AWESOME!  The flavor is incredible!  I didn't use salmon because I don't care for salmon all that much.  I used Tilapia and would also use Flouder, Cod or Halibut in the future.  My family loved this.  We have made it several times. Thank you!

Yumm!  I loved this recipe!!  I didn't have any peanut oil, so i used more sesame oil than called for and alittle bit of olive oil.  I let marinate for about 1.5 hours and then broiled for about 15 minutes.  It burnt alittle bit...but i acutually think that made it taste better!  Thanks for the recipe, i'll be making this one again!  I even may use this marinade on chicken!!

I loved it!! Followed the recipe exactly and it was so delicious!!! It's not exaclty grilling season with the snow outside, so I used my grill pan instead. Also used plastic ziplock as another reviewer suggested, made it easier to marinade.

We got too lazy to go through the snow to the grill, so we broiled the salmon in the oven and it was still fabulous.  We'll make this again and again.

We did like this recipe quite a bit.  I didn't have any ginger on hand and I think in was sorely missed.  I can't wait to try it with the ginger.  I also think next time I will cook the salmon in foil on the grill.  Ours was a bit dry but no fault of the recipe.

Wow! I do not really like salmon, but like this, I could eat it every night of the week. Didn't have green onions, just used dehydrated minced and olive oil instead of peanut oil. Be warned, the mixture smells HORRIBLE (or so I thought), even after it's cooked. I even warned my husband that we might need to order a pizza. Boy was I proven wrong. The flavor is exceptional. I put mine in foil and put on the grill. Enjoy!

I expected something more spicy because of the name but this worked very well. I added more green onions, used balsamic vinagrette dressing in stead of the vinegar, marinaded over night and steamed for about 15 minutes. We all enjoy this reciepe.

This was just wonderful. I marinated this overnight and baked it covered in the oven in the marinade. Leftovers were even tastier. This will be made again and again here.

Great marinade.  It really needs to marinate more than four hours to soak in.

I made this with a little bit more salmon than the recipe called for and it still came out great. A nice kick without overpowering the salmon. Instead of the grill, I cooked it in the oven at 350 degrees. I'll definitely be making this one again, gives a great taste to ordinary salmon.

This salmon was great!  I did make a few changes though:  I didn't have peanut oil, so I used olive oil, I omited the green onions and only used 1 tsp of red peper flakes.  The balsamic vinegar, oilve oil, and soy sauce was a great blend!  I'll be making this again soon, thanks Christine!

WONDERFUL...WONDERFUL...forgot to add the green onions, nevertheless it was a "firecracker" of a recipe!  Try it, you will see...even if you are lukewarm about salmon.

My husband can be very hard to cook for. I have to make everything from scratch. He could eat seafood every day of the week but I'm not very confident at cooking fish so I don't make it often enough. He said that this salmon was the best he's ever had. It was very easy to make too. It's definately a keeper and one that I'll make often. My kids loved it too. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Fantastic!  Unfortunately it was raining last night, so I couldn't grill, but it was just fine using the broiler.  We like spicy food, so I'll use more red pepper next time....maybe a little more sugar, too (going for the "sweet and hot").  Can wait to try this on the grill!

This has been some of the best salmon I have ever made, it was excellent!  The recipe was so good that my mom, who doesn't like fish or seafood, absolutely loved it!  It also goes excellent with garlic cheese bread and garlic mashed potatoes as well as steamed vegetables.  I would definitely recommend it!

I've never had an easy time making salmon. It often came out dry. The cooking instructions for this recipe grills the salmon to perfection. The salmon is moist. The combination of sweet and spicy ingredients for the marinate add a nice kick. I laid the cooked salmon over a bed of fine bits of cauliflower sauteed in garlic oil along with (uncooked) arugula over the cauliflower.

Love this recipe! It's a little spicy, but taste amazing. I marinate wild caught salmon for 4-5 hours, preheat the oven to 400 degrees, then bake for 25 minutes in the marinade. Comes out perfect every time!!!

This recipe is fantastic on the BBQ. No need to add oil to the recipe, though.  My husband was given this exact recipe by his nutritionist, and I found it kind of strange that she kept that 1/2 cup of oil in it.  The first time I made it I only added 2 T of oil - the second time, no oil.  It wasn't necessary AT ALL, since salmon is already a fatty fish.  It grills up great, not sticky, and the thinner pieces of salmon are like candy with all of those little crispy sweet bits.  Everyone fights over those!   Cook up the marinade for a few minutes on the stovetop or microwave.  It makes a great sauce for the fish or whatever side you choose. Oh, and it doesn't need 4 hours.  An hour was plenty, but 4 hours would probably be better.

What a terrific recipe! Made it for 10 people in the south who prefer their food quite spicy but due to time constraints could not marinade as recommended so made the following adjustments to try and compensate with great results. Changes were:
 Used extra ..... sugar, ginger, garlic & crushed dried chile peppers (double).  Added juice of 1/2 squeezed lime, 1/4 cup red wine, used red onion diced (not green) and no sesame seed oil.
Marinated for only 1 hour and then cooked in the marinade in shallow tray covered with alfoil in pre heated oven of 250 deg F for approx 20 mins, Removed from oven and drained almost all marinade and cooked for another 10  mins at 300 deg F, with no alfoil. 
Was the best ever salmon dish I have ever tasted let alone cooking it as well.
Thank you.

Delicious and very easy to make.  We did this once on the grill and the second time in the oven, but poured the marinade into the pan with the salmon while it baked for a stronger flavor.

LOVE this recipe!!  It is easy and great to make for company.  Everyone who has tried it raves.  I cut down the oil to 3 Tbsp., but otherwise, follow the recipe exact.  You can marinate for a few hours up to 24 and it is always great.  I have made it with Mahi Mahi and Cod and it is great.

4.5 Stars, mainly because this did not taste very "fishy".  My husband is the salmon fan, but this I can eat.  I let the salmon thaw in the marinade for a day, then baked at 400 for 20 minutes.  It was slightly overdone, so I will try for 15 minutes next time.

I try to make recipes as written the first time around; unfortunately, I planned this recipe for a cold rainy night and we couldn't grill. I took another reviewer's suggestion and put it in the oven: this recipe was amazing!

My first try and it came out really awesome. I marinated  (2lb /8 pieces) for 2 hours and the flavors came out great (bold flavors but did no overpower the fish). I did make a fresh ginger garlic paste and may be that made flavors a little bold. The recipe balances the flavors very well - sweetness, saltiness, tanginess with just a little fire. Every one enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe. 

(I grilled it outside based on what recipe calls for i.e. 10 min per inch, with a halfway turn)

I was looking for a flavorful but easy salmon recipe and this is perfect!  It's not too spicy and tastes as good as any you'll order at a restaurant.  I never have peanut or sesame oil so I use canola or vegetable and a little olive oil.  Taste the marinade first to see of you need more vinegar or soy.  This is quickly becoming a regular meal at our house.

Really good marinade - I used a 3lb whole salmon filet with skin left in the marinade for 10 - 11 hours.  It  was super delicious and enhanced the salmon flavor without overpowering it.  I followed the recipe with the exception of used fresh grated ginger and unfortunately ran out of propane (darn) doing grilled veggies side dish, so did a last minute sub in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Guests were wowed by the flavor - though presentation would have been better if it had the grill marks etc.  I served with a dill sauce, but half the guests preferred it unadorned (fewer calories too).   Will definitely do this again - on the grill.

OK but have better recipes for Salmon from this site.  It wasn't very hot like I thought it would with the title being "Firecracker".  I could always use more red pepper flakes I suppose.  I didn't have peanut oil, but used canola with smashed peanuts in it so it would at least get some peanut flavor.  Sorry, just disappointed in it.

Tried this with a friend of mine and we both enjoyed it a lot. I didn't have peanut oil so I used a Canola oil instead. The nutty strong flavor of the sesame oil probably made up a little for the absence of the peanut oil. I also used the marination to create a nice sauce (which I used as a dip for the roasted veggies I made on the side), simply dissolve one teaspoon of starch in a half cup of water and add it to the marination and let them simmer over medium heat for few minutes. Delicious !

This Firecracker Salmon was fantastic.  I only substituted dark soy for regular soy and doubled the marinade for two filets. I like my spice so I was very heavy handed with both the cayenne and the red pepper flakes.  All else followed to a tee.  I reduced down the extra marinade to supplement the meal.  My fiance suggested we BBQ the salmon filets on a cedar plank.  Great idea!  He raved as did I over this recipe!  Never thought I'd say I love salmon.  Thanks very much to Christine L for helping me find a salmon that I love.  For you others in my same boat, check out Chef John's Pan-Roasted Halibut with Clamshell Mushrooms and Lemon Butter Sauce.  You can sub the expensive Clamshell Mushrooms for Criminis for the same effect.  It is a fantastic NON-FISHY dish with fantastic flavor and another staple in our house now.

UPDATE:  We now bake it for only 15 minutes and comes out perfect every time.  Also, my now husband has turned Keto so I have to get creative with substitutions.  I subbed the brown sugar for a dash of maple syrup and it worked great.

Marinated for over 24 hours it was pretty good but I kept thinking it was missing something. It wasn’t until the following morning while eating some left over on toast with cream cheese that I thought of what. This would be great if it was smoked! If you are not fortunate enough to have a smoker I would add a little liquid smoke to the marinade.

Awesome. I marinated it overnight and then grilled when I got home from work and it was absolutely awesome. Didnt change a thing, except next time I think I may turn the grill to medium, instead of medium/high. Will make this again!!

This is one of the best fish dishes I have ever tasted!!   The spice was just right; a little touch of hotness without overpowering the flavor.  I was without ginger so I substituted nutmeg.  Prep time was minimal.  I grilled it for 11 minutes.  It was tender, yet flakey This will be my go to salmon recipe from now on

I don't know that I'd have called it "firecracker" - I didn't get much heat. That being said, this was a great marinade, and the sweet and salty combo went great with salmon.

So I didn't have peanut oil but I did have a jar of all natural peanut butter. I used the oil that rises to the top of the jar. I was able to get two 2 tablespoons and I just added 2 more tablespoons of peanut butter. I didn't have sesame oil but I had 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds. I put all ingredients in zip-lock and squeezed it all together and marinated fillets over night. It was fiery awesome. It's amazing what you can use as a fill-in. I can eat salmon every day so I'm always looking for different ways to serve it. Thank you so much!!!

Reduced all amounts to have two servings and since I didn't have peanut oil, I used garlic infused grapes seed oil. And it was wonderful!!!  Grilled it on a grill pan made by Wiltonware and it was perfect.  Excellent recipe !!  A hit with the hubby (he did the grilling)!

The best grilled salmon recipe!   I have made this recipe several times.  I grill on cedar planks (be sure to soak) and cover the salmon with lemon slices first before grilling. The lemon slices balance out the sweetness. I also cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half.

Ok this is amazing... I followed the directions as it was written... The only thing I did was increased it a little more to create more sauce because I had big slab of salmon. I did add a little honey to the sauce. after it marinated in the fridge for 3 hours I poured the Marinade in a sauce pan added a little white wine let it simmer on top of the stove. I cooked this in the oven baked at 400 for 20 minutes then turn it on High  broil cooked it for an additional 10 minutes then took it out served this over rice... IT WAS SUPERB....

For people who don't like the strong flavor of salmon, this recipe will make for a salmon dish they could really like.  I let it sit overnight at least- I usually shoot for 24 hours and we grill the salmon in a foil pouch to keep the juices in.  Always a hit!

This was absolutely delicious!  Hubs grilled to perfection.  I used a little less oil, about 1/3 cup, and cut the other ingredients down accordingly as my salmon filet was about a pound total.  I only used about 1/2 tsp red pepper flake, next time I won't be so wimpy and I'll spice it up a bit more, maybe a shake or two of sriacha or tabasco?  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I baked mine since it was too cold for grilling and it turned out great.  I did cut the Red-Pepper flakes to 1/2 Teaspoon since I was cooking for little ones too, it had just enough of a spicy kick to keep in interesting. I used Olive Oil, because I didn't have Peanut Oil.

Just great!! Made for my wife's birthday last eve.  Only change is I left out the green onions.  Didn't think it would add anything to the taste.  Grilled indirect for 20 min.  What a treat!  Next time I will add a handful of soaked apple wood chips to the coals to see what that does.  Marinated 3 1/2 hrs and was not dissapointed  how it worked. KEEPER

This is pretty much the only way I like salmon! Very delicious! I often freeze some salmon in this marinade at the same time that I'm making some for supper. IT enhances the marinade and makes for an easy supper in the future!

Other than using olive oil instead of peanut as we didn't have any and using garlic powder instead of real garlic as we were lazy, we stuck closely to the recipe. Absolutely delicious!

WOW!!! This was great!! I loved the way this marinade came out and the combination of ingredients. This is one of the best salmon dinners I ever had. Whenever I have the opportunity to prepare this recipe for friends and family, I am going to recommend this to them. I did not have a outside grill available, so instead I grilled my marinade salmon over the stove top and it still came out great. I can tell by the flavor that it is meant to be grilled outside, but I had to improvise. The only change I made was, because I did not have peanut oil, I used Crisco oil instead, and instead of garlic cloves I used garlic powder. I did not allow salmon to marinade for 4-6 hours due to time, but I am going to try it next time I prepare this dish. Overall, job well done!!

This is the best salmon I have ever eaten.  My husband doesn't particularly like salmon and he even said how much he liked it.  Fantastic marinade.  Might try it on pork tenderloin or chicken breasts.

I’m not particularly fond of salmon, so I made this using tilapia.  We liked this, but if I make it again, I’ll reserve some of the marinade, reduce it down and use it to drizzle on when serving.

Love this recipe, we love salmon and this is our go to recipe for it. I change it up just a littl but though, I cut down on the oil (I use canola instead) and use more balsamic and soy sauce, I add more ground ginger and red pepper flakes because we like it on the spicy side. I leave out the sesame oil, green onions and salt all together. So good, it rivals any restaurants salmon

Fantastic! I used my cast iron "grill" pan and it worked really well. I only marinated the salmon for 30 minutes max and still it was delectable. I poured all the marinade onto the pan with the fish. The skin was blackened to perfection - very tasty though maybe not the healthiest! I didn't have any peanut oil so I replaced it with some grapeseed oil and some more sesame oil.  I also didn't have any green onions, but did use fresh ginger. I believe this recipe to be flexible, and therefore very easy to make! Try it with Sesame Pasta (Chicken) Salad, in place of the chicken. The Asian flavors combine sublimely. Thank you for a tasty and quick dinner recipe!

For a home created recipe, this is HANDS DOWN delicious! I would definitely recommend to a friend. I made some adjustments since we didn't have every exact ingredient. Replaced peanut oil with canola oil, green onions with white onions, ground ginger with minced ginger. The overall glazed texture was superb. You can taste a hint of the sugar and a slight flavor of spice from the red pepper flakes. A reviewer named Susan recommended to not throw away the marinade and to add some wine. Based on another experience, I added a half cup of white wine, 2 tablespoons of butter, and a tablespoon of lemon juice. It enhanced the flavor and added alot more volume to the sauce, which every took a liking to. :) Another note, we BBQ grilled the fish with charcoal. Used aluminum foil for the bottom of the grill for easy cleanup, a hi-speed portable fan to zoom through the charcoal fanning process, and aluminum foil for the top of the grill to prevent burning the fish. A 5 out of 5!

Well...I started a diet that says you need to eat fish.  I DO NOT LIKE FISH unless it is the deep-fried kind from Captain D's or Long John's.  Frozen fish sticks and patties...I can handle as long as they are covered in tartar sauce.  Know what I mean?  However...I decided to make an effort to find a fish that I could stand to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised that I REALLY LIKED this recipe!!  I bought FRESH SALMON from the meat counter.  (I was told that it would taste less fishy if it was fresh.)  I marinated it for about 8 hours.  My husband grilled it and brushed the marinade on while grilling.  The only substitution I made to this recipe was to use stevia instead of the brown sugar.  It turned out wonderful!  We liked the marinade so much that we are going to try it on steaks, chicken and shrimp!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Christine, and for helping me find a way to enjoy eating healthier. :^)

WOW - this recipe is amazing.  Such a great taste.  I might add a bit more red pepper flakes next time to bring the spice up a bit.  The marinade is a tangy, sweet and slightly spicy taste. Next time I might also try cooking it on a cedar plank to add some smokiness.  Definite keeper.

I LOVED this recipe! The flavors were delicious! I cook salmon very often and I must say this is probably the best recipe for salmon I've ever used. My three dogs AND cat were surrounding me while I was eating it because it smelled so delicious! (My cat has never tried to eat off my plate before and she tried!) I will most definitely be making this again!!

I've made this many times and it is always delish!  We like to reduce the marinade once the salmon is on the grill and pour that over the finished product.  Awesome!  This recipe has also been kid approved.  :)

Absolutely fabulous, I could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Come to think of it, it would be great for Sunday Brunch.  My family loved it and it’s sophisticated enough for a dinner party.  It goes well with couscous or a brown rice pilaf and a nice crisp salad.

This was soooo good! I made it exactly as written, but used chicken breasts instead. Grilled in my George Foreman grill, and they were delicious. This one's a keeper!

This recipe has just enough chilli pepper to give it a spicy taste without ruining the nice flavour of the other ingredients.

This was a really good marinade.  My husband and I really liked it.  The kids (all under age 11) like salmon better plain.  I'm definitely making it again though.

delicious! I served this with mashed sweet potatoes and a green lettuce salad with vinaigrette, and the sweetness of the of the sweet potatoes complimented the sweet-tangy taste of the ginger, etc. in the salmon marinade beautifully.

I too had the grill put away (in fact it was snowing when I made this!).  It wasn't bad, I took the advice of baking it at 400, which cooked it perfectly.  The only thing I did different to the ingredients was left out the red pepper flakes, as I was serving this also to young children.  That being said, it turned out ok.  We liked it and ate it but no one was really asking for more or wanting me to cook it again.

I was really looking forward to this after all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly but broiled the fish instead of grilling and I'm sorry to say I was really disappointed.  It just wasn't a big deal.  The Salmon with Brown Sugar Glaze on this site is much easier and way tastier, but maybe I'll give this one another shot once grill season starts again.  Some recipes are just better grilled - period.

Absolutely delicious.  I boiled the marinade afterward to use as a sauce that I drizzled over the salmon and the plate.  The best salmon I've ever tasted.

Made this yesterday and followed the recipe almost exactly (didn't have green onions so I used cilantro instead). I made enough for leftovers but there weren't any! Even my eight year old daughter who is the pickiest eater on the face of the earth asked for seconds and said it was the best fish she ever had. The marinade gives the salmon just enough kick without being too spicy. There was a lot of marinade left so I heated it on the stove with a little bit of cornstarch to make a sauce for the salmon...my family loved that too! Thanks Christine for a great recipe!

This is easily the best recipe on this site..  I thought it was the most delicious fish I've ever tasted.  I didn't have any onions so I omitted them, and I also just used whatever kind of oil I had, and it is still AMAZING!  The sauce is so good, that I would recommend making twice the amount of sauce, and, as another reviewer recommended, cooking the fish and all the marinade/sauce in a glass pan, so that no sauce gets wasted!  You won't be disappointed.

My fiance said it was the best thing I have ever made! I used chili powder instead of the chili pepper flakes and a little more garlic than the recipe calls for you. It was 1 pound of salmon and I broiled it for 25 minutes. I also only had time to marinate for about 20 minutes, but it came out delicious. I put it in a glass dish and flipped it upside down so the skin was on top while I was marinating it and then flipped it over so the skin was on the bottom for the broiling.

This was a mixed bag.  I thought it was pretty good - nothing major wrong with it.  I didn't get as much of a taste of the marinade as I would like.  I'd make sure that the dish was smaller so it was more covered.  However, I discovered tonight that my husband doesn't like salmon.  I'm not a fan either.  I was only making it because he said he like salmon!!  So, while this was OK, it is going into the NOPE file!

Absolutely fantastic; this is one of my two favourite salmon recipes. I actually made a mistake the first time I made this - I used 1/2 cup sesame oil instead of peanut oil. And boy, was I happy I did that. I use all sesame oil from now on! I save a little bit of the marinade for basting (I broil my salmon since the outdoor barbecue is kind of a hassle) and it makes a nice glaze. I reduce the excess down to make a nice sauce. Tonight I'm going to dip the salmon in egg and coat it with rice flakes and pan-sear it, then finish it in the oven... I think that a delicious crunchy crust will do this recipe wonders.

This easy and delicious. Keep the heat high enough on the grill to get some good crispy glaze on the fish. I used frozen Atlantic salmon and it turned out great. Everyone loved it.

Wonderful flavor!  Used suggestion from previous review concerning boiling the marinade w/ white wine and used for dipping sauce (so glad I did).  I also marinaded/grilled fresh shrimp (in same recipe) and it was all a hit with my family.

This was delicious. Served it for dinner last night with Asian avocado and Sesame Noodles. I'm eating the cold salmon and noodles for lunch right now! Yummy!! Didn't have any peanut oil so I used canola oil instead. Marinated it for 11 hours while I was at work. I will definitely be making this again. Will try with different kind of fish or even boneless chicken breasts! Thank you, Christine, for a delicious and easy recipe.

Pleasantly surprised!  Great marinade for salmon, served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus topped with shaved parmesan - what a great combination of flavors and textures!  Baked in oven uncovered for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.

This recipe is amazing!  It is simple and, even for someone with very little cooking experience, this turned out perfectly.  I did take some suggestions from reviewers - I marinated the salmon the evening before to soak in the flavours.  I also wrapped each fillet individually in aluminum foil for the grill.  My entire family loved it and is begging for me to make it again!

The flavor is absolutely fabulous! I poured the marinade over the salmon, then baked at 450 for 10 minutes. Firecracker Salmon will be an often repeated recipe in this household.

This was one of the best glazes I have ever used!  Worked amazingly well as a baked dish. I substituted peanut oil and green onion, with canola and shallots and took the advice of others, and reduced the chili flakes by over half. I marinated it for 24 hours and baked it for 35 min at 350. Absolutely blew the socks off of any previous glaze experiment I have tried. Will add this to my recipe and use for years to come.

Good but it was raining so we baked them like others suggested. Was very good, but don't bake with all marinade or salmon gets very soft. Next time I may try pan searing.

This recipe is amazing.  The only deviation I took from the recipe is that I couldn't find peanut oil, so I ended up using peanut sauce instead.  I was a little worried that the peanut flavor would be too overpowering, but it was fantastic and still really balanced, and it cut down on a bit of the oil.  I didn't feel like messing with a charcoal grill, so I baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes and it was perfect.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I didn't use peanut oil and used rice wine vinegar and chopped giner instead.  LOVED the recipe.  I put frozen salmon from costco in a baking dish for about 30 min, then grilled them over a grill pan inside since it's to cold to go out.  i think i'll bake it next time.  My husband and I LOVED it.  it was just so yummy.  I'll definitely make this again and again!

This was a really good recipe, but it uses an awful lot of oil. I followed it exactly except omitted the salt cause soy sauce is salty enough, even the low-sodium kind. Will definately make again, but probably with less peanut oil... maybe sub OJ for 1/2 of it next time, but that might throw off the yummy balance of the marinade as written...

Very very good!  I expected this to be spicier and was a little worried that it might be too spicy.  However, it was perfect.  I could have handled it even a little more spicy.  I marinated about 4.5 hrs.  Salmon is great just as it is, but this is a delicious alternative to plain grilled salmon.  I made it for dinner with a friend over the weekend.  And I've already went shopping for more salmon to make it this week for my family!  I followed all the ingredients exactly b/c I happened to have it all on hand.  I did bake in the oven rather than grilling b/c it was 35degrees & I can't work the grill anyway!

Delicious-- I grilled mine on some sturdy foil. It was so good. I reduced the oil a bit, just enough to spread out enough to coat the fish.

Great recipe, and easy to prepare.  I used fresh ginger instead of ground and baked at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes.  I also followed the suggestion to let it marinade overnight.  Will make again!

I used olive oil instead of peanut oil and marinated for 3 hours. Also, I heated the marinade + some sake wine and added to the salmon when I served it and it tasted amazing.

Wow!!  I marinaded the salmon skin side up to make sure the flesh was sitting in the liquid, and marinaded for about 3 hours, and I thought it was still very flavorful.  I subbed vegetable oil for the peanut oil, and only used a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  This was great, I'm excited to make it again!  Served w/ Gourmet Mushroom Risotto from this site, needless to say it was a 5-star dinner!

This marinade was incredible!  I don't know if I'll ever use another marinade for salmon again!  I even only marinated the salmon for half of the suggested time (2 1/2 hours) and it was delicious!  The only other thing I didn't follow about this recipe was flipping the filets because I didn't want to ruin the gorgeous look of them.  My dinner guests said the salmon was even better than many restaurants!

I didn't grill it, but I did lightly pan fried it on both side and put it in the oven with the remaining marination.  I baked it to med-rare to Med (the salmon that I had was very fresh),  it was excellent!

I haven't tried this yet, but I will.  It
sounds fabulous, but I have a question.
Most recipes call for marinating fish for
only a short time.  Long marinating is 
supposed to turn the fish mushy.  Any
comments?

This recipe makes the best tasting Salmon I have ever had.  I am sure it is good with any kind of Salmon although I have only had it with fresh caugh King Salmon. The only thing I did different than the recipe called for is let it marinate longer than 4 to 6 hours.  Mine marinated for about 24 hours or so. AWESOME RECIPE!

Very good recipe. I substituted olive oil in lieu of the peanut oil, and only had time to marinate the salmon for an hour, but it still came out great. I also sprinkled a little of "Emeril's Original Essence" for added flavor.

The recipe also works very well with pangas,a white fish.  I broiled it in the marinade and served it directly over sticky white rice.

Great recipe!! Made it for my parents and future in-laws!!  They ate every last drop of it.  I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe. It was just the right amount of sweet and spicy.  I will definitely make this again and again!

This is a great recipe!  My husband found it on a google search and surprised me with it on Mothers Day.  When I accidentally saw the recipe before lunch I was wondering how I would act excited over salmon.  It was not hard at all.  This is now his specialty, and he doesn't even cook!

So good, used halibut instead of salmon & the flavor was incredible. I made double the marinade & marinaded the fish overnight. It was really great.

This is my standby salmon recipe. I've made it a dozen times and everyone always LOVES it! I leave out the salt and use low-sodium soy sauce, and sometimes I use olive oil if I'm out of peanut oil. Otherwise, I stick with the recipe as is and it's just delicious.

My family loved this recipe! This is a keeper and thanks for sharing :) It's really yummy, and had to put the salmon on top of the rice with sauce on it.  Restaurant quality!!!

Wonderful! Didn't have green onions, used fresh chives. Marinated for 4 hours... this was wonderful! Love this and will use this with chicken. Thank you so much for a new favorite!

Excellent. Even my salmon haters adore this recipe. I substitute olive oil for the peanut oil and broil it indoors. It is always a hit.

This was really good. It's nice to have a spicy version of salmon (it's not really that spicy though, pretty mild). Although I didn't have this in mind when I was cooking, I ended up serving this on white rice with sauted kale. Delicious and nutritious.

Well, I really, really dislike any fish including salmon. This recipe made it somewhat edible for me, which is amazing. My husband and two of my kids LOVED it. So, I'll rate this on their review. It's very easy to make (my 12 year old made the marinade). I grilled it for about 15 minutes, as our salmon was a tad thicker. My 6 year old couldn't get enough. So, I wouldn't want it again (not the fault of the recipe), but it was good enough that my family would like it again.

Very good!  Has a nice kick.  We had it with Soba (buckwheat) noodles and steamed veggies.  Doubled the sauce and poured some on the Soba noodles.  Will make again.

My go-to recipe for our summer cookouts!  I sub sesame oil for the peanut oil...makes it even more fragrant.  We grill them on soaked cedar planks.  Always a hit!

I added a little extra spices but it still was not hot enough.  The last bite or two had some hotness.  I is a good flavor but does need more pepper.  I cooked on medium for 14 minutes with a filet just over 1 inch thick.  I should have cooked it a little longer (about 17 minutes).

This is absolutely delicious and my 19 yr old son's favorite salmon. He even eats the leftovers (when there are any). I usually make extra marinade to cook down and drizzle over steamed rice. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was a great recipe and it was so easy. I used only 1/2 tsp of chile because my son does not like spicy. Substituted the peanut oil with 1 tbs of peanut butter and a little olive oil because I didn't have any peanut oil in the house. I also used the george foreman grill. Will definitely marinate a little longer but the recomended 2 hours was fine too.

This is absolutely the best marinade for fish I have ever found.  I have used in several times on salmon and once on halibut, and it was wonderful.  I served it on Salmon at a dinner party and people stayed at the table after dessert just picking at the salmon until the whole platter was gone.

By far the best marinade for salmon I have had!  FANTASTIC!!  I did make another small batch of the sauce but reduced the amount of crushed red pepper so I could have a sauce to drizzle on top of the salmon.  YUM!!

I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers that I not use so much red pepper and while the taste came out very pleasant, it was not spicy at all.  If you were drawn to this recipe by the word "firecracker", i recommend using the original recipe.

Absolutely delectable.  The marinade was just delicious.  It was incredibly easy to make and din't require any ingredients that I had to make a special trip for.  I don't have an outdoor grill, but used my indoor George Foreman.  I kept my eye on it since I like mine rare and my husband likes it medium.

Awesome recipe!  I bought more salmon than I thought I needed, but my husband and I were still fighting over the last morsels.  I marinated this for about 24 hours.  I had everything in the house for the marinade and made it exactly as described.  Not too spicy at all -- perfect in fact! Can't wait to make it again!

This is by far the BEST salmon recipe I have ever had!  It was melt-in-your-mouth awesome!  My husband is not a salmon fan and loved it!  The only adjustment I made was substituting shallots for the green onions because I didn't have them on hand.  It was fantastic.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This was awesome!  I made a double recipe of the marinade and poured half over chicken breasts.  I cut the red pepper flakes way down to about 1/4 of what it called for because there were kids and I wanted to please all.  It sure did.  They couldn't stop picking at that crumbs that were left.  This is a keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing!  Served it with the Grilled Baked Potatoes and Spinach Cranberry Salad - YUM.

My family eat a lot of salmon and I can say without a doubt that this was the best we have ever had.  I grilled it on the BBQ using hickory which gave the salmon a nice smokey flavor which went very well with the marinade.  You won't be disappointed.

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I marinated the salmon overnight, and the yummy marinade taste stuck with the salmon very well.  I served it with a vege stir fry and brown rice, and the meal went over very nicely!  I will definitely use this recipe again!!

WOW! Great recipe. Also used it on chicken and it was delish! I opted out of the peanut oil, and used honey instead of brown sugar and it was great. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times - which says a lot for how good this recipe is.  I usually make things a handful of times.  Plus my mom asked for the recipe - which certainly put a smile on my face.
I have left out the green onions a few times - mainly because I have everything else on hand and just stop in the supermarket to pick up the salmon.

Also - this is the only way I will eat salmon - unless it's on a bagel.  I won't touch the stuff in a restaurant.

After dipnetting in the Kenai river, I wanted to find a new way to prepare my freshly caught Red Salmon.  I decided to try this recipe.  My husband told me not to use to much salmon in the recipe.  Needless to say, I went down to check on him while he was grilling the salmon and found him eating it as fast as he could get it off the grill.  It was delicious!!!  I will probably marinade ot for the full 6 hours next time, but the taste was very light and flavorful.

Very good, the whole family liked it. I used fresh wild Sockeye Salmon steaks. I live on the West Coast so fresh salmon is plentiful.
I never had Balsamic vinegar so I used Apple Cider vinegar. I also did not have ginger so I left it out, and I used Canola oil instead of peanut oil. We have algeries in the family so I never keep peanut oil in the house.
Next time I will use Balsamic and then maybe red wine vinegar. I am sure all will taste as good. :)

This was wonderful. Left out the hot peppers - 2 yr. old also eating. They weren't missed. Grill was broke, so roasted (425 oven), in bit of marinade. Curious to try grilled, but this was so good, don't know if I want to change it.

Great with salmon, but we did turkey breast tenderloins cubed, and made into shishkabobs, it was out of this world!  The turkey really soaked up the flavors of the marinade.

I made this over the weekend. I was a little skeptical about cooking it directly on my grill. My other salmon recipe, I cook on the grill on foil, but it did great. Maybe I expected too much from all of the great reviews. It marinated 5 hours. It looked beautiful and delicious, but like I said, maybe I expected to much. It was good, but it didn't knock my socks off. But thanks for posting.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I didn't have ginger on hand and used red pepper but not flakes, so unfortunately I ended up tasting no hot spice.  However, that was fine because I loved the sweetness.  I cut the recipe in half since it was only for me and marinated one filet for 4 hours and the other overnight.  The 24 hours really made the taste even better.  This is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to make for guests!

Served this to company last night to RAVE reviews. People left with the recipe and DH who does not like salmon claimed this "was the best ever"! Small changes - used olive oil since I had no peanut oil; used fresh grated ginger and sesame seeds as had no sesame oil. Was tremendous and a real keeper!

We love this recipe. I use Olive Oil instead of Peanut Oil. Last time I marinated almost 24 hours, that worked really well. This recipe works well with other types of fish too.

This is a good marinade, but I didn't like it on salmon much.   I guess I like the natural flavor of the salmon to come through more.  (from this site, Pan Seared Salmon is a personal favorite)
BUT - I tried this with chicken breasts and loved it.  so 3 stars for the original, but 5 stars for the marinade on chicken.

This was the best Salmon dish ever.  The only thing that I changed was that instead of putting the filets on the grill I used a Glad Oven bag and put that on the grill so the stayed really moist.  My husband gave it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Will definately make again.

this is one fiery marinade :-) very, very good and full of flavor. Only gave it four stars b/c i didn't have any salmon in the fridge and had to use chicken and shrimp. But, OMG! it was still amazing :-) you won't be sorry!!!

Marinade over-powers the fish. I would recomend making less of it and basting the fish with it instead.

YUM YUM YUM.  Everyone loved this.  I had to make a few changes.  Did not have peanut oil.  Used 1/4 cup seasme oil and 1/4 cup olive oil. I also used cider vinegar.  It was good

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I only had the time to marinate for 1.5 hours, and it still tasted amazing.  I didn't have the sesame oil and I put in some garlic tabasco to kick it up a bit.  As I grilled the salmon, I continued to pour the marinade over it to really get the flavor into it.  

One comment was something to the effect of, 'this smells like something you'd get from PF Chang's'.   Taste didn't disappoint.

This was very good. I used vegetable oil instead of the peanut, since that is all that I had on hand, worked fine. I marinated the salmon for six hours and then baked covered with the marinade in oven as suggested by another reviewer. The flavor was perfect.

This was wonderful!  Substituted red wine vinegar for the balsamic and didn't have the sesame oil.  Basted with the leftover marinade a couple times while grilling.  It was SO good.  What a great flavor.  I wanted to just eat and eat and eat.  Just enough spice to warm your mouth without being really 'hot'.  We ate it with a cheesy pasta/salsa mix.  Can't wait to eat the piece or two we saved.

This is a fabulous recipe. Even my husband, who does not like fish, was thrilled with the results. We will have this often.  It was easy, quick, and delicious.  I served it with long grain and wild rice and string beans with tropical fruit for dessert.

This is an excellent recipe!  I always make it for company and many Sunday night dinners.  I do a couple of changes, I use olive oil and less than it calls for and I omit the sesame oil.  Thanks for a great recipe Christine.

My family ALL liked this better so far than any way I have cooked salmon.  I did think, though, that it was a bit heavy on the peanut oil.  Would probably use less next time.  I was hoping for a bit more heat than it delivered.  Will add more red pepper next time.  But, overall it was quite tasty.

One of the best salmon recipes I have made. I marinated the salmon as long as I was able, added alittle more garlic and adjusted the red pepper because my 9 yr old was going to eat it. By the way he couldn't get enough....Need I say more??

No fishy flavor here.  Tasted slightly nutty and had a real light flavor.  Great with white wine and some veggies.  Definitely would recommend this one.

I didnt care for this at all. i was raised in alaska with fresh salmon and have yet to find a recipe that makes salmon taste as great as i had growing up. my husband liked this better than i did. i liked the baked salmon II recipe ALOT better.

Amazing! With so many positive reviews I knew I could not go wrong. Served 8 adults and 8 kids - everyone loved it. I used a balsamic vinegar that had chili peppers and garlic already in it. How simple!

Nice tasting recipe, it covers up that taste of the salmon a little more than I would like.  I'm used to plain BBQed salmon and this was definitely not that.  It was very well recieved by my family.

Loved this dish! It was my first attempt at grilling fish on the bbq and it was easy and turned out perfect. My boyfriend even exclaimed, "this is the best meal I've ever had." Wow. I served it over white rice with grilled red peppers on the side and a green salad.

The marinate was great, my husband isn't a big fish eater and he loved this, Kids liked it too. Next time I would marinate at least the entire 6 hours or abit more.

Generally a good recipe, but it wasn't spicy enough.  Maybe add more peppers next time.  Salmon is generally a fatty fish, so I don't think the oil is necessary except for the sesame oil which gives it an intense flavour.  Very good.

Unbelievably delicious recipe. You can't imagine how tasty it is. TRY IT. You'll be hooked. It makes A TON of marinade for only 2-4 people...so half it if you don't have that much fish. It is SO tender, and just a hint of spice. It's just amazing. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.

This is a delicious recipe with Japanese flare. I used less peanut oil, but otherwise followed the recipe. Instead of grilling, since it's winter, I broiled the filets for about 8 minutes. They were delicious.

This is one of the BEST marinades that I've ever used!  It's so easy to get sick of salmon because most marinades end up tasting the same - not this one!  Enjoy...

I used some salmon that was vacuum sealed and it was incredible.  The sauce is perfect and leaves a nice heat in your mouth.  If you're not a big salmon lover this is for you.  If you DO love salmon, it makes it even better.

I am very picky about fish.  One fishy taste and I can't eat another bite, but my husband an I are trying to stay away from red meat and are experamenting with different recipes.  Since Salmon can have such a strong fishy taste, I have to be very picky about the way I prepare it. I added a little honey, as suggested, marinated the fish overnight and cooked it over a mesquite fire.  It was absolutely the best fish my husband and I have ever eaten! My kids didn't get to try it yet, but I know that they will love it also.

Living in Alaska, we eat a lot of salmon so I am always searching for new ways to prepare it.  This is absolutely wonderful!  Substituted half of the oil with honey as had been recommended previously, it adds a subtle sweetness to the peppery flavor.  It is now my husband and one son's favorite marinade; we have found that also works great with chicken breasts.

These were excellent!!  I did not think they tasted too much like vinegar at all. I tasted more soy sauce.  I halved the recipe and omitted the hot pepper and it's a keeper.  Next time I'm going to try garlic in it also.  Thanks Deb!!

This is a wonderful way to grill salmon!  
I use dried peppers from my garden and 
lots of garlic and make sure to marinate 
at least a couple of hours. Very popular 
with all of our friends!

5-stars for a great starting place! It is not grilling season currently so I made some changes. I swapped the peanut oil for 1/4 cup canola oil and increased the sesame oil to 2 tablespoons. Also used 2 tablespoons orange marmalade instead of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon asian red chili paste instead of red pepper flakes. I baked the salmon in the marinade and served with stir-fried veggies and brown rice. Delicious!

I baked this in the oven and it turned out too oily.  I will grill outside when the weather warms up and it will probably turn out better.

I thought this was great! It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but that was alright for me. It was too cold to grill outside so I made it in the oven at 400 degrees, baking for 15 minutes. It turned out just fine!

Saw this featured in the AR magazine and it looked delicious.  It was super easy to prepare, I only let it marinate for 3 hours and the flavor was incredible. I also did not have any peanut oil on hand (nor did my grocery store!) so I substituted it with olive oil. I will be sure to try this with peanut oil next time (if I can find it).  Excellent recipe that my entire family loved!  Will be putting this in my official recipe rotation!

I've been making this for years.  It's so good and always a crowd pleaser.  I've made it both on the grill and in the oven.  It's great both ways but better on the grill because of the char.

This was a very tasty dish. I marinated the salmon for 10 hours. We had to use a grill pan since it was raining outside. My husband hates salmon, but said that I could make this recipe again.

This was wonderful! The only modification I did was that I only had 30 minutes to marinate the salmon and so then I put it in the oven (in the marinate) for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Very Flavorful

I decreased the ingredients in half, as I was cooking for my husband and myself. It was easier to just cut the marinade in half instead of cutting it way back for just two filets. 
It was delicious and full of flavor. I think it would be even tastier, if i’d Marinated it four hours or more. I only marinated for an hour, and it was still delicious! Will make it again! My husband loved it, and he dislikes Salmon. I used Copper River Salmon—the best!

is this supposed to be skin off or skin on (fillets come either way)?  the marinade is good (i added 2 tbs dry sherry, and you can sub maple syrup or honey for the brown sugar - just watch closely so doesn't burn), but most of the reviews for this recipe are so old - cooking has changed (i admit, some recipes keep for generations without any changes!)!  - but can't even imagine marinating salmon for 4-6 hours, let alone overnight (unless you're going to smoke it) - you'd have mush! marinate for up to 30 minutes only!

I like spicy, so made a couple of minor changes. I cut the oil and crushed red pepper in half, and added 1/4 cup hot sauce (replaces the oil - the brown sugar balances the spice).  This sauce would probably be good in a veggie sitr fry too. It is now my go-to sauce!

Delicious! We made extra marinade, marinaded the salmon for over 24 hours, then boiled the marinade & served it over the salmon as suggested in a popular comment. Superb! Definitely special occasion worthy.

One of the better marinated salmon recipes I've tried.  The flavor actually penetrated the fish while cooking.  I did marinate it for almost 24 hours, marinating it skin side down overnight and turning it to meat side down in the morning. I would definitely make it again, but I would use four 8 ounce filets instead of eight 4 ounce filets.

Love this recipe, we’ve made it about three times now. We like the heat it brings, just right. We did it on the grill once after we baked it the first time - I prefer to bake it as you get some of the sauce with it. Absolutely delicious either way!!

Loved it! I used wild sockeye salmon. I forgot the onion!! However it had plenty of kick and flavour - will repeat! Also salmon has enough natural flavour that it doesn’t overwhelm it with the spiciness. Mmmm!

Amazing, amazing, AMAZING! My family and I are obsessed with this recipe. My dad is not a fan of salmon, but he will eat this and he loves it. We have changed a couple of things, but we have made the original recipe and it is great :)

Tremendous flavor.  I use a little extra crushed red pepper to give it a little extra kick.

Wonderful. Just threw everything for marinade in a small food processor. Used Forman grill to cook. Love the fact that it has less sugar than a lot of other recipes. Perfect amount of kick

This was terrific!  I used a little less crushed red pepper than called for and thought it was perfect.  Very easy and very impressive.  I served with Rosemary Garlic Roasted Potatoes and Caesar Salad.  I wonder if this marinade would work as well with other meats?

This recipe was great!  I used about half the amount of red pepper flakes (all I had on hand) and substituted tamari sauce for the soy sauce (to make it gluten free). I marinated the salmon overnight and then cooked on a traeger grill. Everyone loved it, even the grandkids!   I will definitely make it again.

Just ok. Some of the sweetness came through but it was still missing something. Maybe it needed fresh ginger instead of powdered. Won't make again.

I've made this twice now  - tonight my husband said it was the best salmon he'd ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly and marinated for 5 hours. Then I cooked it on a cedar plank on our Big Green Egg. This has a great combination of flavors and a little heat. Will make again and again!

I would have to say that this is the best salmon recipe I've tried.  The only thing different is that I used garlic powder instead of the garlic cloves, as I was out.  Fabulous and I have saved it to use again!!  Thank you!

This was phenomenal!!!!! I added caynanne pepper to spicy it up a bit more and baked it at 400 degrees for 20 mins rather than grill it, but it was so good my man devoured his food. Definitely a recipe I'll keep using! Thank youuuu

Very, very good.  Made it as directed. Marinated over night and next time I'll use a little more heat. My husband was a little disappointed that it wasn't hotter so I'll fix that next time. Served with some rice and it was excellent and we will definitely have it again.

We've been making this recipe for about 20 years now and it's always fantastic!  My sister found it printed in a Denver newspaper and sent it to me.  I prefer to marinate the fish overnight for more flavor.  Don't omit the crushed red pepper--don't worry, it won't be too hot.  This is a family favorite of ours.  Thank you for submitting!

I love this recipe! My salmon came out the best I've ever made. I'm now getting request for this at family potlucks. A special thank you to the reviewer who explained how to bake this in the oven.

This is a regular on for our annual use of stocked of Copper River salmon. Almost every week. Usually marinade 24 hours. It does have a little heat so if you are sensitive to spicy use half the pepper flakes. Otherwise, CHANGE NOTHING.

Absolutely delicious. I reduced the marinade to serve as additional sauce. My favorite way to prepare salmon.

Great recipe.  I love the flavor of fresh salmon, and was concerned this might be overpowering.  It wasn't!  As one review suggested, I boiled the left over marinade, and then drizzled it over both the salmon and stir-fry veggies.  I made this a second time, and tried cod instead of salmon.  It was OK, but I won't be using cod again.

Wowza, my whole family loved this! I broiled the salmon on high in my oven for 5 minutes. While the salmon was cooking, I simmered the remaining marinade with about 2 T f chia seeds to thicken. I substituted Korean red chili powder for the chili flakes and used olive oil. We served the salmon and sauce with sticky rice. This recipe is now one of our favorites!

This was delish - my mother was visiting and told me it's the best salmon she's eaten! Several reviews mentioned cutting the red pepper in half so I did. I didn't have any green onions on hand so I substituted shallots and a few sprinkles of chives. I also added about a tablespoon of honey. I was in a hurry and only had two hours to marinate the fish before cooking but even with all these variations it was still wonderful! 

Per several reviews I saved the marinade, added 2 tablespoons dry white wine and reduced to make a glaze. The oil separated in the saucepan and remained on top so I couldn't use it. But still, this recipe's a keeper!

This was so amazing I had to sign up and become a member just to rave about how great of a dish this is. I cooked this for my fiances' bday. She likes a little 'kick' to her food so I thought this might work. And it sure did! She gave me an 11 on a 10 point scale. It was amazing and simple. While mixing the ingredients I was skeptical.  As I made it it seemed like a bland Teriyaki sauce, which neither of us care for much.  But after following the instructions to the letter, except for a bit more brown sugar, it came out wonderfully. You have to try it if you like flavor with just enough kick to your taste buds. Also I placed in oven instead of grill since it was raining that day.

This was AMAZING!  Cut red pepper way back for our family and used vegetable oil instead of peanut oil because it is what I had in the house.  I only had about an hour to marinade this and then we cooked it on the grill.  My husband, who doesn't normally like salmon, was raving and told me I'm welcome to make this any time!

Salmon isn't my favorite fish but we loved this!  So much that I'm making it again this week.  I reduced the marinade with a little white wine and served it over the salmon. I did grill mine on foil and it was delicious!

My family really liked this. I used only 1/4 cup of olive oil (couldn't bring myself to do 1/2 cup and didn't have peanut oil) and substituted purple onion for green since that is what I had on hand. Used all the red pepper and it was great! I only marinated them about 3 hours. I did bring the marinade to a boil with a little white wine and some honey while husband was grilling. Topped the salmon with this before serving. Delicious. We did 4 minutes a side on the grill, and they were perfect. We grilled asparagus from this site and had steamed squash/zucchini and a creamy rice. Will definitely become a staple recipe.

I baked it wrapped in parchment paper so it can be moist and also added zucchini, squash, broccoli, and carrots. I made a glaze with maple syrup, soy sauce, crushed red pepper, and balsamic vinegar in a pot until thick. I wish I made more of the glaze though.

After having tried numerous salmon recipes on this site I have finally found a keeper, one that everyone likes.  This recipe is awesome as written.  I did not have sesame oil and just omitted that and marinated 6 hours.  Next time I will try to marinate longer and see if that is even better.  The salmon was moist and the taste was great.

This was delicious.  My husband and I both thought it was great.
I did cut down on the spice a little.  Easy too.

This was excellent.  I cut down on the oil and used less chili pepper and baked it 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Really good.

Great salmon, but rather expensive to make ... I bought both the sesame oil and peanut oil because I had neither, but wanted to follow the recipes exactly. Made an extra half batch of the marinade for some chicken for the non-fish eaters in the family.  People who tried both said the chicken was definitely a little spicier than the salmon ... I did not really get any heat in the salmon, although we all really liked it.  Will probably try it again.  (I did marinate for 24 hours, but that's really a long time for fish!)

Absolutely Fantastic!!! My 10 year old took one bite and said his mouth was in heaven. Grilling really brings out all the flavor(s).

Oh wow! Awesome!!!  My husband, who doesn't normally rave about recipes, is raving about this one! I didn't marinate it as long as I should have (should have read the recipe in advance), but it was still sooooo flavourful, even after only marinating an hour.  I'm going to try marinating overnight next time, like suggested, because this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Add us to the list of those who thought this dish was really tasty.  We like our food to have a little kick, and this had just the right amount of heat for us.  The only (very minor) change I made to the ingredients was to use fresh ginger instead of the ground ginger.  I marinated for about 7-1/2 hours because that was all the time I had, but next time I'm going to go for at least 9-10 hours because I think that might be even better.  We're not big on outdoor grilling, so I baked the salmon at 400 deg. for about 30 minutes (the fillets were pretty thick); for the next batch I'm going to try the George Foreman grill.  And there will definitely be a next batch!

My family really enjoyed this meal!  Great flavor and I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing is the salmon did stick a bit to the grill (even with my husband oiling the grill).   It wasn't horrible, but we will probably try using foil next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I already love salmon & this recipe made me love it even more! Personally I would add a little more heat, but it was delicious! Will be making again. I also think the marinade would be good for chicken or shrimp. Yum!

used safflower oil instead of peanut, and onion powder instead of green onions. it wound up marinating about 30 hours, but was absolutely amazing! we both loved it and can't wait to serve it for others. UPDATE: everyone loves it! I've tried different marinating lengths, and think 8+ is best. Also tried it with ahi, which I don't recommend.

I'm not sure why my reviews are being edited, especially considering my opinions are always fair and non judgmental. Some recipes are better than others, simple as that. So, here's my second attempt at writing an honest review. This was just so-so for me. I much prefer Aytom's Slammin' Salmon. The marinade isn't thick (like this one) and can therefore be used as a dressing as well. When served atop a bed of mixed greens, Aytom's salmon makes for a nice, light dinner. I guess I'm also not a fan of wild salmon. I know it is the "king" of all salmon and is favored for it's rich flavor, but it's just not for me. I felt the marinade didn't have a chance to shine because each bite was overwhelmingly fishy. As suggested, I served this with a side of rice and a stir-fry medley of baby corn, shitake mushrooms and snow peas. Everything complemented each other nicely, but was just not to my liking. I may make this again, but will use a milder salmon when I do. Thanks anyways, Christine.

I have cooked this recipe at work for the past 3 years.  We omit the peanut oil because it hampers the marinade.  We also marinate sides of salmon and then portion.  We bake the salmon instead of grilling.  Everybody loves this dish.  It is cute seeing the recipe for 8 servings.  I routinely marinate 110 lbs of salmon for a single meal.

Pretty good flavor, we marinated overnight.  I still prefer my cajun flavorings on salmon.  But if you are feeling an Asian vibe for dinner, this is perfect!

This is a really good recipe. I used Coho wild caught salmon. I don't eat farm-raised salmon. It had a delicious flavor, although it was not spicy at all. I would definitely make this again but kick up the heat a notch.

Delicious!  I added the marinade to the salmon (frozen, as our grocery store was out of fresh) in the morning before work and it remained there for the next 9 hours.  I subbed EVOO for peanut oil and dried minced onion for the green onion.  Mr. LTH isn't always a fan of grilling new things, so I wrapped them in foil to make life easier for him and this worked very well.  I think he grilled them in the foil for about 10 minutes and they were restaurant quality.  I topped each filet w/mango salsa and served with "Grilled Broccoli-My Kids Beg For It" and "Healthier Oven Roasted Potatoes" from this site for an excellent meal.  THANKS for the recipe!

My husband HATES salmon, but when I made this for dinner, he said if I have to make it again- he wants me to make it with this recipe!!!!!  I marinated and broiled it.  My son couldn't get enough, and he doesn't like salmon either. It was amazingly delicious. Thank you

I typically like my salmon with just lemon, butter, garlic, salt and pepper, but if you want to try to spice things up a little, this was very tasty.

FABULOUS redipe. Even my 18-month old son ate a huge portion. I used olive oil rather than peanut, and reduced the amount to 1/4 cup. Additionally, I increased the sesame oil - which I always have on hand since I cook Korean food at least once a week! - to approximately 1 tbs. I used sriracha sauce instead of crushed red pepper, and did not use the green onion at all, since I don't care for their texture when cooked. I did use a dash or two of onion powder, however. I cooked this under the broiler rather than the grill because of a storm, but it came out perfectly. I also recommend bringing the leftover marinade to a boil to use as a sauce afterward. This was served with steamed rice and Korean cucumber salad. Perfect dinner!

I created an account here just to write a review of this amazing recipe!  I made half the recipe for three large chicken breasts, and it was perfect.  I subbed olive oil for the peanut oil, used a bit less red pepper flakes, and accidentally forgot to add the green onions (boo!).  I put the marinade and the chicken into a zip lock bag and let it marinate for about 8 hours in the fridge.  The chicken came out so unbelievably moist and flavorful!  Even my two-year old, meat-hating daughter gobbled this up!  It had the perfect amount of salty, tangy, sweet, and kick of heat.  I poured the extra marinade into a small pan and boiled it and let it reduce a bit, then drizzled it over the cooked chicken and on my side of rice.  This is the best asian marinade I've ever had.  I can't wait to try it with salmon.  I will most definitely be making this all summer!

Great recipe! Our grill is out of commission currently, so I used a grill pan on the stove, still great. I suspect this would be great broiled as well. I used pepper flakes and a little chili powder -- to my husband's dismay (even 7 months pregnant, I have a higher tolerance for spice than he does ha) He loved it, but his eyes were watering :) I also used FIG balsamic vinegar rather than plain balsamic... experimenting was so much fun!  This is a great base marinade. Serve this over salad, quinoa, rice or with grilled veggies. yummm.

I pretty much followed the recipe but added more garlic since I add garlic to everything;) I don't always get the chance to marinate as long as the directions list (2-3 hours) and it came out tasty.  Have also pan fried and great this way too! Good, quick recipe

I baked the salmon in the oven and husband and I  both thought it was very tasty and of course spicey.  Will go easy on the red pepper flakes so as not to set our tongues on fire.  Plan to try the marinade on trout.

This was okay. Seemed oily to me and didn't really burst with flavor even though I marinated for over 6 hours and poked holes in the fish hoping to enhance the flavor.

This went over big at my house! I didn't have time to let the fish marinate so I baked the salmon in a deep dish with the sauce and basted it a few times in the oven. It was great!

Great combination of ingredients.  I was making for only two, so I cut all the ingredients in half except for the garlic and crushed red peppers.  Came out perfectly.

Absolutely LOVE this marinade!  I just pop the fish in the convection oven for 20 minutes on 400 and voila!  I served it with long grain rice so we could pour the extra sauce over it.. mmm!

This is seriously one of the most delicious (and simple) recipes I've come across! And I'm sure that I've not even experienced it to its "full potential" — I didn't have time to marinade it properly so just did it for about 20 minutes, and then grilled it on the stove. I served it with brown rice and used the leftover marinade as a sauce (boil it with a splash of white wine for a few minutes) for the rice. Absolutely fantastic! Will definitely be becoming a recipe I'll use again and again.

This was absolutely delicious! I had tilapia on hand so I used this marinade and still tasted excellent with it. I didn't have balsamic so used white rice vinegar! I agree with others that this is a crowd pleaser.

AWESOME!!!  My husband and I loved it!  I made it without changing a thing but used a cedar plank to grill it on and it came out perfectly moist!  Great for low carbers especially if you substitute the brown sugar for Splenda brown sugar.

We have fresh salmon from a recent fishing trip to Alaska and are always looking for different ways to prepare it. This is my favorite recipe so far ! We used what we had on hand..canola oil instead of peanut and didn't not use the sesame oil..also sprinkled a little montreal steak seasoning on before cooking.  We took the advice of another reviewer and made the sauce w/ a little white wine...it really made the dish. This is a keeper for sure.

Although I wasn't able to marinate this anywhere near the suggested time, it came out with plenty of flavor. Delicious! Will definitely be in regular rotation. We had this salmon with wasabi mayo on the side and it paired very well.

Awesome! My first time grilling fish!I do agree with others that it could have been marinated lonber (I did only 4 hrs).  Also, I like thinner cuts of fish for easy cooking and better penetration of flavor. Meena

My family LOVED this salmon. The marinade was sweet/spicy. I grilled it on the stove in a grill pan and had lots of sauce left over to heat and serve. Yummy over rice.

This recipe is perfect.. Not hot at all the red pepper just kicks it up a nitch.. my 2 and 3 yr. old enjoyed it. My only critism is that the salmon was to small cut up 8 4oz slices is small. I will go for 6 oz slices next time! umummm good!

It was a really nice asian taste.  I would have rated it 5 stars but I don't really like ginger.

Excellent!!  I scaled this down to 2 servings and thought I had taken salmon out of the freezer - nope, grabbed rainbow trout!!  Nonetheless, let my trout marinade for a good 4-5 hours.  Left out the salt (soy has enough) and used fresh grated ginger.  Baked at 400 for about 20 mins (I don't BBQ and hubby was working late) and it was fantastic!  I think next time I will up my red pepper flakes a tad.  Loved this, yum!

Very, very delicious.  My friends always rave about it and beg me for the recipe.  If you want to give this recipe an "ump" try grilling it on a cedar board.  Your eyes will pop!  Trust me!

YUM. Followed the recipe as written, except I baked it instead of grilling. Definitely should be marinated for as long as possible.

Great recipe!  A lot of different flavors, some heat, a little tangy, a little sweet.  I might try cutting the sauce with some water next time because it was a little thick.  Maybe slightly less balsamic ving.

Excellent recipe! I omitted the red pepper because of the kids and I really don't recommend adding any salt since you are already using a lot of soy sauce.

Prepared exactly as directed and very good!  Had some friends over and one choose to add some more crushed red pepper since she likes things quite spicy.  Served it with green beans and fresh corn.

This recipe was great! We only had time to marinate for about 2 hours and it still turned out awesome. My boyfriend said it was "the best meal I've ever made." We'll definitely be having it again.

This is the recipe I find myself doing all the time during our fresh salmon season--it's delicious baked, pan-fried, and grilled.  I like to marinate it for as long as possible.  Thank you Christine!

I will make this again.  Very tasty.  I left out the olive oil in the marinade to reduce fat, marinated for 30 minutes and baked the salmon in foil for 15 min in 400 degree oven.  It was fabulous.

We constantly try new fish recipes and this is our absolute favorite.  We did not change a thing, however we did marinate the salmon for 8 hours.  We are already planning to serve this at our big summer party.

Excellent! I may even add more red pepper flakes next time as it wasn't that spicy. It makes quite a bit of marinade so you may be able to cut back some.

Fabulous!!!  Don't be afraid of the red pepper flakes, I am a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so I cut the red pepper flakes in half.  It was not spicy at all so next time I will put in the full amount.

This was the best salmon I've ever prepared, and possibly the best my wife and I have ever eaten.  Next time I may opt for a little more red pepper, or possibly add a little cayenne as we like things spicy.  But, this recipe is fantastic the way it is.

This is absolutely the BEST salmon I have ever had. Have made it 3 times already. Has become a bi-weekly meal for me. Only because no on else in my family likes salmon. I would give this 10 stars if I could!

This recipe was awesome!  My fiance and I just made it and loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the servings to 2 and I cooked it the oven.  I placed the salmon in a greased 9x13 pan and baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. This is definitey a keeper!

This is one amazing dish.  I was excited when I saw 5 stars from over 500 reviews and was sold when I read the ingredient list.  If you enjoy asian cuisine this is wonderful.  We had our first 75 degree day of the season and of course we grilled out.  With the grill flavor and the sweet but spicy marinade that I turned into a glaze by heating on the stove and adding a bit of cornstarch water mixture it was amazing!

Wonderful recipe. I have been making this for the last 10+ years. I usually marinate the salmon for most of the day and grill it for dinner. We are not huge fish fans, but this is an excellent marinade.

This salmon recipe was excellent. Instead of doing it on the grill, we wrapped each of the pieces of salmon in aluminum foil and then cooked on the stove. Also, I think next time we make it, we will leave a little bit of the marinade to drizzle over the salmon! Either way this is a great recipe!

I omitted the pepper and marinated for about 24 hours. The flavor was really great. But it was too cool to use the grill so I broiled it and it was kind of a pain because it started to get black on top before it was done. Next time, if I can't use the grill I'll just bake it. And remember to try to use a fillet that is of even thickness so one side doesn't get done way before the other.

My husband said that this was the best salmon he'd ever eaten.  He believes it could be sold at a restaurant for $45.00 a plate.

Excellent.  Only marinated for 3 hours.  Think it would be even better if next time am able to marinate longer.

I thought this would be more flavorful than it was.  I didn't have time to let it marinate as long as it says to in the recipe, so that may have made a difference.  It was still good, but it wasn't quite what I expected.

TOTALLY AWESOME!!! ...as the young ones would say. Taste fine if you marinate and broil in oven about 20+ mins. It still tasted yummy. As suggested by others, if you cannot marinate for 4 hrs, then do at least 30 mins...however, you may need to warm the leftover mixture in a pot and spoon about tsp. over top of each piece before serving.  Reduce red pepper for kids; otherwise, no substitutions but olive oil, if needed. A DEFINITE KEEPER!!!

I had never been a real friend of salom, but I have one kid that loves fish, so every year for his birthday, I do a new fish recipe. I picked this one last year, followed it exactly, and I have been totally won over with salmon. I now have a freezer full of it. I have simplified the recipe down to a basic rub of dry ingredients with the same flavours that is on hand at all times ( and work well on pork ribs or roasts too )  done it on a cedar plank....which is amazing. Overall............it's a winner.

Excellent. Followed the recipe exactly. I recommend using fresh wild salmon. The marinade made the salmon tasty and of course the grilled flavor can't be beat. You could get someone who doesn't even like fish to like this dish.

For a flavorful treat, this can't be beat!  The only time I would not use this is when we have tender, super fresh line-caught salmon (from a friend or relative's fishing trips).  Then, sometimes we like the salmon flavor itself to stand alone.  Otherwise, this is the recipe!

This was really good. I didn't add the brown sugar since my husband doesn't like the savory/sweet combo. I let the fish marinade over night and I baked it for 20 minutes at 425. It was perfect and very yummy! Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly except for using olive oil instead of peanut oil. The salmon came out great. My wife said it was the best salmon she had ever had. I did marinate it overnight as other reviewers suggested.

Great way to prepare salmon. All the flavors compliment this fish very well. Be sure not to overcook it. Cook just long enough to flake with a fork.

This is a GREAT marinade! I used it on a sirloin steak and only got to marinade it for one hour and it was still a hit at my house. I also substituted chinese 5 spice powder because I didn't have any ginger. Can't wait to try it on salmon.

very good!  I really like the heat of this recipe.  this time I omitted the ginger as I didn't have any and when I scaled back to 1 serving, it only called for 1/8t. so I decided it wasn't worth running out.  I will include it next time and might also try adding some lime juice/zest.  thanks for sharing, this is a keeper!

Great flavor! I used king salmon fillets.  
Next time, I'll marinate for longer.  My toughest critics enjoyed it too - I am allowed to present this one of the table again.  Definitely keep this one in my recipe box and prepare again.

Great tasting recipe!!!  Found that it tasted even better with Coho wild salmon steak cuts.  An overnight marinade tastes much fuller than the 4-6 hours.

Decided to learn some new recipes today and stumbled upon this. I should have read more closely but I didn't realize that the marinade takes between 4-6 hours. This was our meal for the night so I ended up letting it sit for only an hour. I also baked it at 400 for 30 minutes instead of grilling. It was delicious! we both loved it and it was still full of flavor. I'll try letting it sit for 6 hours next time.

Excellent flavors - I reduced oil a lot, but kept the rest as is.  Was delicious - thanks for sharing!

Yum!  I took another reviewers advice and simmered the leftover marinade and then skimmed off some of the oil.  Used for extra on the fish as well as on some steamed brown rice.  I also took a reviewers advice and halved the red peppers...glad I did, it was just spicey enough!

This is very good. I find it a bit too richly flavoured for me as I think it masked the natural salmon. But would do it again or for a party.

Absolutely fabulous! I used Halibut and marinated about 5 hours then cooked on a piece of foil on the grill. I also threw a piece of chicken in with the marinade and it turned out fabulous as well. Will use again with chicken, fish or pork chops!

I thought this was good, but not great. I followed the recipe as written, and the only thing I did differently was bake (at 400 for 25 minutes) instead of grill. I marinaded the fish between 6 and 7 hours so there was not a problem with the amount of marinating time. Both my husband and I thought that the flavor got lost with the strength of the marinade. For people who don't like to eat fish that might be a good thing, but for fish eating fans that's not the goal of a marinade. It was worth making again, though next time I'll definitely try it cooked on our grill perhaps that will help. One tip for those who want to bake the fish: put parchment paper into the glass baking dish before adding your fish - after you remove the fish you can just lift out the paper at the end (holding the corners together to contain the cooking juices), and you won't have to clean the baking dish. Marinate the fish in a throw-away plastic baggie and you have NO CLEAN UP, which is always a good thing. :)

I just tried this recipe last week.  It was AWESOME!  Previous comments were quite helpful and an accurate indicator of what to expect.  I made some changes, like I didn't have balsamic vinegar replacing it with olive oil and some vineger.  This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  I couldn't find peanut oil, so I used walnut oil.  Also, I ended up marinating this for a day and a half.  It was so VERY good.  We love salmon and this is our new "favorite salmon" recipe.

Very good and easy to make. It is not spicy at all so just follow the recipe. I cooked mine on the cedar planks turned out great. I soak my planks for atleast 5 to 6 hours so that they do not catch on fire.

This was delicious. I started to grill it skin-side down and some of the pieces burned. I just scraped it off and it was fine since it was just the skin. When I lowered the heat it grilled perfectly. I used a special grill grate cover for fish and vegetables. Next time I'll be sure to oil it better.

Holy cow, this is spicy! Other than the fact that I had to chase each bite with a drink of iced tea, the flavor was good, so next time I'll cut way back on the red pepper and probably would be able to give it a 5.

I made this for a large gathering and got rave reviews on this recipes. I am not a huge fan of salmon at all and I must say that I really enjoyed this. I used this on tilapia and salmon and I really like the way the salmon turned out better.

First time I tried to prepare fish dinner. I left it for 24 hrs in the fridge - had a great taste. Excellent, would not change anything. It is perfect. I served it with rice and asparagus. Thanks, Petra

I have been a vegetarian for many years, and only recently (because of my fiance) have started eating salmon.  This, by far, is the best salmon that I have ever eaten!  I couldn't get enough of it.  This is going to definately be put in the weekly menu in my house!!  I added a bit more garlic, but that's just to my taste.

This recipe was excellent. We catch lots of wild pacific salmon and it is difficult to come up with interesting ways to prepare it, and this fit the bill. I used fresh ginger, and found I needed to marinate longer due the thickness of our filets. Thanks for the great recipe!

I do not like eating fish - I only eat it for my health. But this recipe actually made the fish sorta enjoyable...dare I say "good"? My husband loved it.

Awesome marinade made with pantry staples.  I think it would also work well, with a longer marinating time, on poultry, pork, or beef.

This recipe was just okay.  My husband and kids thought it was great, but I think it really needs to marinate at LEAST 8 hours -- I only had time for 3 hours.  I will proabably make it again but will allow to set overnight, or longer.

I marinated the salmon overnight, which may have been too long (although I seemed to be the only one who thought so).  Delicious recipe!  Not a bite left.  This will become a regular in our household.

I thought this was pretty good, although the marinade didn't penetrate the fish as much as I thought it would, even though I did it overnight. Maybe I'll make some extra marinade next time. Nonetheless, a tasty dish that got my salmon-hating fiance to eat seconds!

I really liked this salmon dish, and it went very well at a recent party we had.  I didn't even have a chance to marinate long enough, so I can only imagine how well it could have gone over!

This is a great recipe.  I reserve some of the marinade to serve with the salmon.  You can leave out the red pepper flakes if you don't want it hot.  Everyone who tastes this wants the recipe.  A great one to serve when company is coming!

This was great!  Moist and flavorful.  Even the leftovers were delicious.  I followed other rater's suggestion to add honey, but don't think I would add so much next time.  This is definitely a "keeper".  Thanks for sharing.
