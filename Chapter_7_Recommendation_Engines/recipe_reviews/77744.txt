This is a FABULOUS dip! I tasted it 25 years ago and have been looking for the right recipe since. I made it recently and it IS the one I remember! (I only added a couple shakes of course-ground pepper)  I am so happy to have stumbled on it. You can't go wrong w/ this dip. **The tough part was finding the "Beau Monde" spice (which is a unique mix of salt, celery & onion powder: "Spice IslandsÂ®" is the brand I found in a regular grocery store finally & use now). Also a good spice for use in any cold summer salads.  Thanks for sharing, CATWOMAN2!

I use Seasoned Salt instead of Beau Monde seasoning and 2 tablespoons of the dill, parsley and onion.  My husband uses this as a chip and pretzel dip too.

I have been making this dip for 50 years and there is nothing better.  Be sure to use vegetables, radishes, cauliflower, broccoli, celery, cherry tomatoes.  Sometimes I put an extra shake of the spices in.  Yumm

Substitute for Beau Monde-- OLD BAY SEASONING! I googled the ingredients and both were so close. Being the type to run to the store to make it perfectly, but finding the time close to midnight, I settled for this sub and it was GREAT! I also used a 16-oz container of sour cream (2 cups) and a cup of mayo, then did a 1 1/2 recipe of spices (24 servings). Thanks for a super make-it-yourself dip!

A nice, basic, familiar vegetable dip recipe that has stood the test of time and remained popular for decades.  I used green onion but beyond that made this as written. Hubs thought it had a tad too much mayonnaise but I think it's just fine. If you can't find Beau Monde you could easily substitute some onion powder and celery salt.

I liked this dip a lot.  I didn't have Beau Monde seasoning, so I just made a "seasoned salt" with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika and celery seed.  It turned out great.  I couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the dip I remember from many, many years ago!  I finally found the Beau Monde in a specialty food store here in Pensacola (pricey!) but it was worth it to taste that flavor again.  I like the addition of the minced onion.  The recipe doesn't state if it's fresh or dried but I used dried and I like that flavor.  Thank you CATWOMAN2 for this nostalgic yet delicious recipe.

This was excellent!  Not too overwhelming on the dill and I found it strangely appealing with pretzels.  I also could not find the store bought Beau Monde seasoning, but simply created the recipe from scratch:
1 T. ground cloves
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1 T. salt
1 T. ground bay leaf 
1 T. ground allspice
2 T. ground pepper
1 T. ground white pepper
1 tsp. ground nutmeg
1 tsp. ground mace
1 tsp. celery seed 
Plenty of seasoning left over for the many times I will make this recipe.

After having broccoli & dill dip at work last week I was on a mission to make myself a low fat dill dip for healthy snacks. I substituted Fat Free Sour Cream and Mayo light to bring the calorie count down to less than 35 per tablespoon. I'm sure the regular version would be fantastic as well! Thanks for posting this CATWOMAN2!

Delicious! Per other reviewer's suggestions I used 1 1/3 C. sour cream and 2/3 C. mayo. Full fat makes for a creamier dip (ie, not diet food, but oh so good:). Instead of Beau Monde I used 3/4 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 tsp onion powder. Letting it sit overnight is essential. It was so good my husband dipped everything on his plate in it; raw veggies, dinner rolls, meat. We loved it. Thanks, Catwoman2!

Yum - great recipe!  I also substituted seasoned salt because I couldn't find the beau monde seasoning.  Will keep looking though, as I would like to use it in this recipe.  I am overrun with cucumbers from my garden, so I am cutting them up and eating them with this dip for a very tasty snack.

So, so good! Had no Beau Monde, so I used 1/2 tbl of celery salt and 1/2 tbl of Old Bay and a dash of onion powder. Perfect dill dip!

This is very good.  Did not have Beau Monde seasoning so used some Lawry's Seasoned Salt and some Old Bay seasoning.  It was very good. The first time I made it I only refrigerated for a few hours. The 2nd time I refrigerated overnight. Much better overnight as it gives it more time for the flavors to meld together. This was enjoyed by everyone!!

I make ALOT of recipes from this site, and I can truly say that this dip is one of the BEST!!! I could not find  beau monde, so I used Old Bay as suggested by another. I put a couple dollops of it on some shredded cabbage and WOW, it was sooooo good! I ate it with a pretzel...fabulous! A red pepper strip, a radish, a green bean...delicious! But get this....I used it as a dip for buffalo wings...OH LORD! Soooo good! I am so glad I found this recipe. My family and friends love it, and it has become my "go~to" dip recipe. Thanks!!!

We used fresh dill, parsley and chives from the garden. This was a big hit, we served it with veggies. Next time I might use more sour cream and less mayo as it upset my stomach a bit, it was a touch heavy. Otherwise fantastic, I don't usually like dips and I really enjoyed it :-)

I couldn't find beau monde seasoning so I substituted Cavender's seasoning.  I made the dip the night before, which allowed the flavors to blend together.  The bowl was scraped at the party.  I thought it was pretty good & obviously my guests agreed.

Great base recipe but I didn't really follow much of it in the end. I used fresh dill (3 tablespoons chopped), and also tripled the onion (using red onion). Sometimes I omit the parsley it doesn't seem to make a huge difference, and I can't find Blue Monde seasoning so I use garlic powder and salt to taste.  The only part you can't ignore is that it really does need to sit overnight!  Thanks for the base :)

Just as good as I remembered it to be! Didn't change a thing to the recipe! Best to let it sit in the fridge for at least 3 hours. Make it in the morning or early afternoon for an evening get together.

Best dill dip ever! I have been using low fat mayo and sour cream. Today I had to skip the parsley (ran out). The key is definitaly the seasoning. Don't substitute. Thanks for sharing.

Yum! I love the clean, fresh taste of this dip. It's super versatile too--could be used as a dip not only for veggies (I love it with celery and carrots), but also for potato chips. Tastes great on fish too! My only substitution was garlic salt instead of the Beau Monde seasoning--cause it didn't have it. Definitely a keeper :)

Good but tastes very similar to something you can buy in an envelope and mix with sour cream. Will make it again since I had to buy the seasoning though.

Excellent! Couldn't find Beau Monde seasonsing, so used celery salt and onion powder instead. Will definitely make again.

This review is for the "base" as I didn't have the specific seasoning. I did divide the rest of the ingredients and added 1 of 4 seasoning blends I had on hand in each. This was to answer my own question of which I preferred. I used Penzey's 4/S, Pampered Chef Seasoning Salt, Morton's Seasoning Salt and Old Bay (reduced sodium).  I couldn't pick one, they all tasted awesome. The kids devoured their raw carrots with the dip and asked to take the combo in their school lunch. I did reduce the mayo a bit; I usually prefer a higher sour cream to mayo ratio. Simple with natural ingredients, just the way I like it!

Spectacular dip for veggies and plain chips too! I tasted it as soon as I mixed it and it was good. After sitting overnight, it's even better. I used a shallot in place of the minced onion and I even found Beau Monde seasoning at Bulk Barn! Beau Monde seasoning is made up of the following: celery salt, salt, dehydrated onion and MSG, so you could probably make up your own, but if you can find it, get it for convenience, plus you'd be saving the MSG. I will make this recipe from now on as my go to for veggies and dip. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have been making this for 40 years.   I use dried minced onion and only 1 tsp of dried dill....I have heard that you can use Bon Appetite instead of Beau Monde if you can't find it in the store...have not tried that tho.

I made this as written with two exceptions: (1) I used celery salt plus a couple pinches of garlic and onion powder to equal 1 teaspoon instead of the Beau Monde seasoning, and (2) I only had fresh parsley on hand, so I minced it and trippled it to 3 T. I haven't even let it set yet, and the dip is delightful! I love the tanginess added by the mayo. I noticed some people altered the ratios of sour cream and mayo, probably for this reason ... So if you like tangy, acid flavors like vinegar and lemon, then by all means try this as written. If you prefer the creamier aspect of dairy cream, then increase the sour cream/mayo ratio.

This is very good! A few slight changes though. I've made this 3 times now. I use a limitless more sour cream than mayo ( 1 1/4 sc and 3/4 mayo). I prefer more of sour cream flavor than mayo. I also put a punch more of dill weed and added fresh black pepper. Serve in a pumpernickel bread bowl. Yummmmmyyy!

I have a dairy allergy, so used non-dairy sour cream and also substituted OLD BAY (because it is made up of the basic spices in Beau Monde)  everything else was as written..   Excellent Dip for fresh vegetables .. also pretty good on a baked potato ..

This dip has a very weird taste. I served it at a baby shower & 3/4 was left over. Based on the good reviews, I followed this recipe exactly. As always, I made it the day before to let the flavours marry. I couldn't find the Beau Monde seasoning in any specialty food store so I made it from a copycat recipe I found on-line. Sorry, I just can't recommend this.

A very good classic dip. I used some seasoned salt, garlic powder, and paprika in place of the Beau Monde seasoning, since I did not have it, and that worked out very well.

This dip was certainly good. I made it exactly as written (and yes, I had to shop around for the acclaimed Beau Monde spice) and while my guests and I certainly enjoyed it - I didn't see how this tasted any different than the package of seasoning my mom always bought and dumped in a container of sour cream.  Guess I'm not sure why I'd even bother if you can't tell the difference?

6.10.17   Super easy to mix up, and tasty with some rainbow carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and celery sticks.  I had no beau monde seasoning on hand, so I took the suggestion of a reviewer and used onion powder and celery salt as a substitute.  Don't rush this to the table because the flavor really does need  some time in the fridge for the flavors to meld.

Have been using a version of this for years; a great way to get kids to eat their veggies.  I substitute the sour cream with natural yogurt and the ratio of yogurt to mayo is likely 1 1/3 yogurt and 2/3 mayo.  I just eyeball all the ingredients and taste as I go! The yogurt adds a tangy flavour that we all really enjoy.  I also use fresh dill if I have it on hand and spring onion. Have tried various types of seasoning salts, and also add additional celery salt to taste.

This is one of my favorites!  My mom made this, and I make it often.  Beau Monde is definitely one of those spices that you don't use very often, but definitely makes the recipe.

Have been making this for 40 years and it is a fave.  Only difference between this one and mine is to use chopped green onion and seasoned salt, which is close to the same as Beau Monde, I think.  Also tried another version that has a dash of worcestershire and Tabasco.  If a person thought it was too salty, reduce the seasoned salt.

Well, I was excited to try this from reading the glowing reviews, but I was not impressed...could have used a store-bought packet. The only change I made was green onion. Won't use this recipe again.

Great basic dip - I decided to make a veggie dip at the last minute, so I didn't have much on hand other than sour cream, mayo and my spice rack!  Didn't have Beau Monde, and wasn't sure what to sub, so I browsed through the reviews and went with onion powder, garlic salt then added dried dill weed, a bit of Italian seasoning and some of Trader Joe's "21 Seasoning Salute".  Really yummy and versatile recipe!

Many years ago I had this at a friend's party & loved it so much that I asked her for the recipe. It is so good! I think the key is using real Beau Monde seasoning, which is not very salty and has a unique subtle flavor.

Great easy recipe.  My 4 year old helped make it and he loved it.  We did make a few alterations...we also added 3 oz. or so of softened cream cheese, omitted the parsley since I had none, and added a little pepper and garlic powder.  This recipe can be easily modified according to one's taste.  We also added less mayo, since the combination should be more 2 to 1 on the sour cream/mayo ingredients.  All and all, a good basic recipe.

It's vegetable dip. It's nice it's not ranch. It is good, but it's the same vegetable dip we've all had before. Beau Monde seasoning is by 'Spice Islands'.

Very good dip! The flavors really come out as it sits. I've made it multiple times and people always want the recipe. I substitute lawrys seasoning salt or red robin seasoning. :) I'm thinking of trying cajon creole seasoning salt next.

Great dip! Took it to a party and people enjoyed it. I used fresh parsley because I had it on hand, and I think it made the dip taste fresher.

This is great! Did not add salt, instead used dried beef and the saltiness was great! I will always use this recipe for Rye boat dip!

Made this again and rinsed the salt off of the beef with water and used 1/2 tsp celery salt. Make a couple days in advance. Good stuff!!

This was phenomenal-- super-easy to make, too!  Fortunately I was able to find the Beau Monde seasoning in our store (Spice Islands brand), but I tried the recipe once with half-and-half Old Bay and celery salt, and it was just as good.  Definitely a keeper!

Changes I made: I used around 3/4 c of mayonnaise, 1 tsp onion powder (instead of minced onion) and 1 tsp Old Bay Seasoningâ¢ (instead of Beau Mondeâ¢). Excellent! Everyone loves it.

Made this dip for an appetizer veggie tray for Thanksgiving.  It was light and flavorful and not super filling right before the big meal.  I got a lot of compliments and we continued to eat it with leftover veggies.  It's different than ranch, which is a nice change.  The recipe makes a lot too!

Was looking for one like my mom used to make and this one fit the bill pretty well. BTW, I've searched everywhere for a decent Beau Monde seasoning recipe and the best one that I've found so far consists of 1 part Onion Powder to 1 part Celery Salt. Pretty simple.

Everyone LOVED it!  It was gone in minutes, literally.  I made it several hours ahead because it was a last minute decision, next time I will make it a day ahead...it was still amazing.  I used 
1 teaspoon of Lawry's seasoned salt & fresh herbs, it was perfect
Served it in a bread bowl, which was eaten as soon as the dip was gone.  Next time I will double the recipe

Absolutely delicious!  I didnât have the seasoning but used Tony Chachere which tasted phenomenal!  The consistency was perfect.  I will be experimenting with different seasonings.  Thank you so much for a keeper!  I found this while trying to set out some veggies for the family to use up produce.  What a treat!

I made this dip to use with our veggies from the garden and it was wonderful.  I used fresh dill because I had it in the garden.  I did not have the seasoning Beau Monde but I looked up what it consisted of and made it with the same seasonings on hand.

I make this dip often and people always love it & want the recipe.  Wonderful as written!.  I do use plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream but only because of calories.  Delicious on baked potatoes or even in potato salad!

Added a squirt of fresh lemon juice and this is perfect for artichokes, asparagus and maybe even shrimp if you added more lemon juice.

We loved this dip. I've been experimenting with different veggie dips to serve at an upcoming baby shower, and this one was our favorite! It's mild but still very flavorful without being overwhelmingly salty or tasting artificial like some of the others we tried. Great on cucumbers and carrots, and we even tried it on kettle potato chips, and that was wonderful too. We have a winner! We'll make this again and again.

I made this for New Years this year. Itâs amazing. I think it caused me to eat my weight in broccoli and carrots over the last couple of days. My husband said itâs fantstic with chicken fries as well. Absolutely going to be my go-to veggie dip.

It was good, not outstanding. Dilly. I wonder if there's a way to make it taste more "zinggey" though. I would look for a different dill recipe next time.

I made this as the recipe reads.  I'd never heard of Beau Monde seasoning before, but I found it easily enough.  This really tastes good - would even go well with chips in place of that yucky brown onion soup chip dip stuff.  I've never liked that stuff.  Great little recipe!  Super easy - just a few minutes and in the fridge for tomorrow!  thx!

This the best recipe, I've have been looking for this one for a long time! A friend of my mother's was a cook for  a large company in our town! She made this for all of her luncheons and parties! Some think it's too salty,if so omit the beau monde or reduce it ,otherwise it's the Original Dill dip recipe!  The best!

Beau Monde seasoning is mostly salt with some ground celery seed and a few other spices. If you want the flavor without the salt, consider using ground celery seed instead. Then add any other spices you want (black and/or white pepper,  garlic powder, etc.) along with as little or as much salt as you want. Ground celery seed (and Beau Monde) are available online from many different spice vendors.

I LOVE this dip! I generally make a 1/2 batch (makes 1 cup dip) and pretty much always have some in my fridge so I can have some with pretzels or raw veggies like cucumbers, carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. I also sometimes use this dip as a spread on cucumber sandwiches. One of my favorite recipes to come from AllRecipes!

I loved this dip- simple and perfect! I will admit, though, that I used fresh dill, as it was what I had on hand.  Also, I had to use seasoned salt for the Beau Monde- I don't recall seeing that brand in stores in my area.

BEST DIP EVER!!! I have to make a lot of it cuz its goes with chips and veggies. I used fat free mayo and low fat sour cream so I don't feel guilty for ratting it. It doesn't change the taste of the dip, so if you don't tell people its heathly they won't know.

Just like a mix I'd found at a craft fair once--so delicious! Like other reviewers I only used a 1/2 cup mayo to 1 1/2 cup sour cream. Also used fat free sour cream and light mayo. Second time I made it I used fresh onion--better flavor. Overall wonderful!

I made this recipe again :)  It is great.  I didn't have the Beau Monde like many others.  I used 1/4 tablespoon celery salt and 1/4 tablespoon seasoning salt and it tastes wonderful. THANKS for the recipe.

EVERYONE loved this dip.  It is really easy to make.  I didn't have any Beau Monde seasoning so I just used a seasoning salt.  The onion is really strong, and I love onion, so you might want to add and taste as you go.
