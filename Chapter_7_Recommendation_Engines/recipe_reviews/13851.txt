This is wonderful! I added a bit more sugar and used half fresh blueberries and half fresh raspberries.  It not only tasted great, but looked beautiful.  My kids ate it alone, without the turkey and asked for more until it was gone.  A huge hit.

HELPFUL TIPS WHILE MAKING THIS: I definitely had to take the advice of another reviewer and add 1C of sugar.  All the other cranberry sauce recipes on here call for 1C as well, so it's not as alarming as one may think.  Otherwise, it is WAY too tart.   Know that when they say the cranberries will POP ...they literally mean pop, so it may be best to not wear white or stand so close to the pot ;)    Otherwise, this was delicious and a nice twist to the normal cranberry sauce.  I've got to admit that my husband thought there was too much cinnamon, but he is one of those people who are sensitive to seasonings (loves them but hates when one overwhelms a recipe).  Personally, I thought it was perfect!!!

This was the first time I tried to make a homemade cranberry sauce and it was a HUGE success. Both families were raving about it anf it was so simple. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and it cut the bitter taste down perfectly. This is going in my "use again" recipe box. THANKS!!

This is super easy to make, and it is a HUGE hit everywhere I take it.  It is the perfect combonation of Sweet and Tart!  The recipe is perfect as-is!

Excellent.  I used frozen blueberries.  Use ALL the spices, it really helps.  In order for the flavors to "blend", be sure to squish the cranberries to be sure the skins are all popped.  Also, it tastes better after "resting" for a day or two to allow the flavors to blend.  It was a wonderful, tangy-tart cranberry sauce.  I made a second batch and froze in small portions to use for sandwiches and weeknight meals.

This was wonderful!  Instant family tradition, I don't think we'll have a Thanksgiving again without this.  I can't beleive how -easy- it was.  Just don't forget to pick over the cranberries.  Also, I used a cup of orange juice instead of water, and really liked the flavor it added.  It was a little bit tart for my taste, though others loved it as-is; next year I'll probably add a bit more sugar.  But it was wonderful, thank you Connie!

Absolutely wonderful.  I read the reviews and added and additional 1/4c of sugar.  I also waited until the sauce cooled a bit before adding the blueberries.  Tasted wonderful and looked great on the table.  Definately a recipe that I will use each year.  Thanks!!

This sauce was absolutely wonderful. EVERYONE loved it at Thanksgiving dinner(even my very pickey 2y/o and 4y/o nieces!) I added one can of drained mandarin oranges as decribed by another reviewer and it was a PERFECT blend! I also used frozen blueberries since they were so out of season and expensive. I would definitely make it again and I've already signed up to bring it to a work party!

Big hit last year for Thanksgiving...I'm not a big fan of cranberry sauce, but really enjoyed this one.  Will make again this year.  I used frozen blueberries, because I couldn't find fresh, you couldn't tell.

I made this for my then-boyfriend (now fiancee) as part of the first meal I ever cooked him. I made it with 1 cup frozen blueberries and 1 cup frozen raspberries. It was incredible!! (I served it with roast chicken, corn, mashed potatoes with croissants. Dessert was vanilla cake with truffle frosting.) I made it again a few weeks later for my mom. I added a small can of mandarin oranges for my mom. She loved it!! Even my brother who is a cran-in-a-can guy liked this! (I think this was part of the reason why my fiancee proposed - thank you Connie!!)

I made this for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas.  It was a huge success with everyone, even those who don't like normally like cranberry sauce.  I added the raspberries as I saw suggested on another review.  I can't imagine going back to canned!

As the originator of this recipe, I'm happy this has been so well received.  As some suggestions have noted, this is a tart recipe unless you have very sweet blueberries.  We like it that way, but a bit more sugar can work well too.  I've used this recipe for many years, not just as a side dish but as a substitute fruit filling in other recipes such as tarts and layered granola bars.  I've even used it as a topping for ice cream and a filling for a layer cake.  And of course we never have a Thanksgiving or Christmas without it.

This comes together very quickly and the colors are gorgeous! I had to add just slightly more sugar as my cranberries were pretty tart and I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh. The flavor is much more complex than the ingredients suggest. I think it's fabulous and I hope the family loves it on Turkey Day. If not, then it's all mine! Thanks a lot for a different take on an old favorite. :o)

Instead of using a cup of water I used a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice, used a little less sugar, also added in a cored and peeled granny smith for the pectin to help it thicken and to top it off threw in some orange zest. Is good on vanilla ice cream and works very well with wild berries.

Made this for Christmas and it went over pretty well. I had to add extra sugar -- pretty much double -- to get it sweet enough that it didn't make you pucker when you ate it. Or, to get it on par with the canned stuff. The only thing I didn't like about making this (which has nothing to do with the recipe itself) is that the skins came off many of the cranberries and often we'd get a mouth full of skins which wasn't terribly pleasant. Could be that I overcooked them. Anyway -- it's a nice change for cranberry sauce but I'll keep trying new recipes -- this isn't the be all and end all.

I can't rave enough about this sauce. I was out of canned and needed some to use in What A Dish's Apple Crisp with Cranberry Sauce. I noticed the unusual name of this one & decided to try it. I added raspberries (thank you JenRay) and heeded the suggestions of others who added more sugar. Because of the added tartness of the raspberries, I added altogether 1-1/4 cup of sugar plus a 1/2 cup of honey. I had no allspice, so I got inspired & used 1/8 teaspoon of cardamom (heavenly) along with the nutmeg and cinnamon, plus I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. This sauce is so delicious! I may not have enough left to make the Apple Crisp after all! Thank you so much for sharing Connie!

I have changed this recipe to suit my family's tastes.  I reduce the amount of nutmeg and allspice to less than 1/8 teaspoon each per batch and increase the amount of sugar to taste. The other thing I do is double this recipe so I can freeze half and make it several days in advance so that the flavors have time to blend. We prefer it with the addition of mandarin oranges too. If you try to serve it right after you make it the recipe will taste very sugary.  This amended recipe never fails to receive rave reviews at my house.

This was really, really good. I normally do not care for cranberry sauce, but the blueberries made a huge differnce (to me). The spices were wonderful. My whole family and guests thoroughly enjoyed this one at Thanksgiving. Will be serving this every year now.

Very good!  I used frozen blueberries, and added an additional unpacked 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Taste was a bit tart, a bit cinnamon-y, and very cranberry-ish.  Yummy!  Good warm and cold.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. I cooked the cranberries w/1 C. OJ, and added in 1/4 C extra sugar. Once I removed from heat I added 1/2 c. Frozen/Thawed Blueberries & 1/2 C. Raspberries. Cooked the day before, then warmed back up before serving. I might add a little more sugar next time to cut the tang a little more. YUMMO!Froze the unused portion.

I've made this outstanding recipe for 3 years running now to rave reviews!  My secret?  I add a tablespoon of dehydrated onion to the recipe, it adds just the right tang to the mix. Regular onion just won't do.

I made this last year at Thanksgiving, and I just came back to find the recipe again for this year.  It was a huge hit with the whole family, and it's a beautiful dish to serve.  Everyone loved it, including my picky husband.  I'm surprised by those people who reviewed it and said it was horrible--I'm guessing that they did something wrong. I'm sure that not everyone would find this delicious due to our varied tastebuds, but if this turns out inedible then I think you've may have made a mistake!

This is an excellent recipe! I used frozen blueberries that I bought fresh earlier this year when they were in season. I also added a touch of ground clove, tangerine zest, and the juice of one tangerine. Next time I'll make a double batch.

My family loved this recipe!  It was so easy to make and my husband ended up putting in everything, from his turkey to his potatoes.  My son who never eats cranberry sauce raved about it!  Definitely a tradition in my house from now on.

If you aren't a big fan of cranberries, this is the sauce for you!

The blueberries give it a very smooth taste.

It got great reviews at our Thanksgiving table.

Great...This is even better the next day with sliced white turkey, dressing and mayo on pumpernickel bread, as a sandwich you can not beat it. Did use Splenda, instead of sugar,(1 cup),cinnamon (2t) and orange juice instead of water.

I had to add a comment on this recipe. I have been making this recipe from this site for years. This recipe is now a required part of our Thanksgiving feast. It is delicious warm. I love to enjoy this the morning after Thanksgiving with a homemade biscuit. God willing I will be making this every year for 50 more years. Thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe.

Love, love, loved this one!  I took the advice of others and added 1 full cup of sugar.  The cranberries need to simmer a little longer than stated, about 15 minutes should do.  I didn't have any allspice on hand so I substituted 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon for all the seasonings listed.  Pumpkin pie spice is a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cloves and it worked perfectly.  I used 1-1/2 c. blueberries and about 1/2 c. raspberries.  The berries add a rich, beautiful color and the mixture is so tasty.  You can put this out with the main course and leave it out for people to have with their pie and ice cream.

I can't figure out why anyone buys canned cranberry sauce, when the real thing is so easy!  I made this Tuesday for tomorrow's holiday (Thanksgiving) and it is beautiful, and very tasty.  I'm sure it will be even better after it has chilled for two days!  It makes a ton, too.  I doubled it, not knowing what to expect, and I think I'll have enough left over for next year!!  Really great, pretty recipe!

I didn't like this at all and it did not go over well at Thanksgiving.  I don't think the blueberries blended well and I missed the tartness of the cranberries.

Really tasty!  I left out the allspice and nutmet, the cinnamon was just enough spice without overspicing it.  Frozen blueberries work fine, just stir them in after cooking the rest of the sauce.  The next time I will add the mandarin oranges.  Test for sugar before adding the blueberries, some people like it sweeter although I thought the sweetness was fine.

Very nice.... Make sure to taste it before you take it from the pan, though.  It needs more sugar!  It's beautiful and easy, though.

How great to find a quick and easy side dish to any Holiday meal.  As a mother of an infant with no time to cook, I needed something simple to bring to the table and this was the ONE!  I'm known for not being able to boil water, so everyone was impressed!

Best Cranberry sauce I have ever had.  I took the advice of a few others and used Orange Juice instead of water and a full cup of sugar.  I will make this again and again.

This is my second review, if that is allowed.  Try this as a yogurt topping.  I now make it with a 1/2 cup of honey instead of the sugar, a 12 oz bag of fresh cranberries and 2 cups of frozen blueberries.  When it gets later in the year and cranberries become scarce, I stock up and freeze them.  I use all the spices and just a pinch of salt too.  I love it just like that but for my husband's sake I smooth it out in the pot with a stick blender before I put it in a container for the refrigerator.  Heavenly on top of plain yogurt with granola and toasted pecans.

This turned out better than expected for me.  I wanted to use fresh cranberries but was afraid it would be too tart for my guests.  It was almost too sweet!  Most people liked it.  I would make it again but probably cut the sugar in half because the fresh blueberries do such a good job of makeing it sweet enough.  Also love the fact that it contains 2 anti-oxidant power houses (the blueberries and cranberries)!

This came out great! It will definitely be apart of my Thanksgiving feast from now on! The only mod I did was use a little less sugar and add more blueberries to make it a little healthier. Great recipe!

Used this recipe Thanksgiving 2010 with Mom, Pauline, Ron & family.  Very good.  I added a bag of mixed raspberries, blueberries etc. in lieu of the just blueberries.  Left out allspice as I did not have it.  Still very good.

This made a beautiful cranberry sauce - the blueberries looked like little blue jewels. I was hoping the sauce would have more blueberry flavor - I think next time I'll add about half the blueberries while the heat is on, and the other half after removing from heat. I added a half cup of sugar, and it is just the right sweet/tart combo. At first, I thought the nutmeg flavor was too intense, but it really mellowed after two days in the fridge; maybe next time I'll use half as much nutmeg.

I never really cared for cranberry sauce but people in my family love it so I found and made this recipe for them.  The ENTIRE family loved this recipe when I made it for Thanksgiving!  This recipe was something that even "I" enjoyed and I will continue to make (and eat) it every year.  I used more blueberries than the recipe called for and I soubled the sugar to remove the tartness as suggested in other user comments.  I was only able to get my hands on frozen blueberries but they worked just fine!

Great sauce. Very different. I also used frozen blueberries and added another 1/2 cup of sugar to balance the tartness of the cranberries. Be careful when measuring your spices; too much and it'll be awful. This is a keeper.

This was a hit at a pre-Thanksgiving feast that I just had with about 30 guests. 
Not only is it different and delicious, but so quick and easy....yet those who don't
know much about cranberries assume that it's a chore!   Goodbye jellied sauce,
move over for the, 'it just looks/tastes gourmet' version.

Thanks for adding this recipe.  It will be a tradition here.

I use orange juice instead of water and 3/4 cup of sugar .

This is sooooo good!!  Made it ahead for Thanksgiving, and my 10-year-old asked if she could have it for dessert for her birthday next year!!!  I'm not a 'follow the recipe exactly' girl, so my spices were a tad different:  I used generous sprinklings of Pumpkin Pie Spice, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, and I also used (thawed) frozen blueberries.  It turned out fabulously!

This is the best Cranberry sauce we have ever had.  I do modify it just a little when I make it.  I have to make a triple batch at every holiday for my family!  I did use grated nutmeg instead of ground, but it is awesome.  My DD and I also took this to our local homeschool support group and got raving reviews, too!  We have added some of the sauce to cool whip and put it in a pie shell for a quick and easy dessert with the leftovers (after I made 5 batches for Christmas).  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe, Connie.  I am also going to try it with raspberries and the mandarin oranges as others suggested.  YUM

Tastes great, and good to look at!  I had to use frozen blueberries (bet it is really awesome with fresh blueberries) but still had great results.  Be sure to add extra sugar, as everyone else has advised.  Definately will keep this recipe around.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  It was pretty good, a little sour though, I think I'll add more sugar next time.  Also much better after a day or two in the fridge.

Have tried this once so far and it went over so well, plan on making it again very soon. Really refreshing and the addition of blueberries is out of this world. Thanks for sharing.

This took HOURS less than I had expected.  I strained out the cranberry skins, and after leaving it in the fridge overnight, it tasted EVEN better!  I would recommend making it the night before serving.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE--have made it for years now. I make it exactly as is. It's the perfect balance between the tart cranberries and the sweet blueberries. We still do the canned stuff (my youngest insists on it, it's just the tradition), but I make enough of the blue cranberry sauce to have on Thanksgiving and for a few days after.

This sauce always gets rave reviews from my family. My sister requested I make my cranberry relish again this year. So I am. Some years I use the blueberries, other years I've used mixed berries, raspberries or blackberries. But I love the suggestion to use 1 cup of O.J. in lieu of the water, then add some zest of 1 orange. This year I'm going to mix in some actual orange to the sauce with the fresh blueberries after it cools. 
I love this recipe because there is so much you can do with it!

This was well received at Christmas dinner, but no one was asking for the recipe or wanting the leftovers. I upped the sugar to 3/4 c, but I now agree with other reviewers that it needs a full cup. (Some people must really like things tart.) I cut the cinnamon in half and just put a pinch of nutmeg and allspice-- thought it was spiced just right this way. I also think the use of OJ instead of water would have helped the flavor. A lot of reviewers did this and thus rated the recipe higher. Overall the recipe is OK, but I guess many of the tweaks make it 5 stars.

I skipped thw white sugar and used honey (1/4 cup).  The spices are perfect. This wonderful on pancakes!  You could always add a little orange or more blueberries instead of sugar.

This was good, and I really liked the combination of cranberries and blueberries.  I would enjoy this more using half the amount of spices called for, as it was too spicy for me as written.

I also read all of the reviews before making this. I used orange juice instead of water and 1 Cup of Sugar. I ground the nutmeg myself because it is much better than using the kind that comes ground. This was excellent with the turkey and incredible with the rolls. My husband wants me to make this every year now.

This recipe has made me famous among my family members and in-laws.  Every year my in-laws make me promise to bring a double batch for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Almost like a dessert, we've found that the sauce is even better when made the day prior and allowed to chill in the fridge.

Beautiful!! My husband and kids (and me, too) just love this recipe. It can be made with or without the blueberries. It's fantastic either way, but the blueberries are a great addition and cut the tartness of the cranberries. Also, for something different, add in some raspberries with the blueberries! It's still tart so if you want to tone it down even more, add extra sugar to taste. This recipe is easy, cooks up quickly, and the taste is out of this world! My kids love watching me make this so they can watch the cranberries burst (but don't let them get too close). Try a spoonful on your leftover turkey sandwich! I have been making this for five years now. I grew up on the canned stuff and will never go back after trying this!

I highly recommend this recipe - made it for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner.  I made a traditional cranberry sauce as well as this one.  While the traditional was really good, too, this one the whole family raved about. The only changes I made was to use several different holiday-related spices while the cranberries were brought to boil -- such as cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  My family really liked this, in fact so much they asked me to make a batch for Christmas dinner too.

I made this the day before Thanksgiving and tried a bit of it when it was done and really liked it.  However the next day when the flavors of the spices came through I thought it was awful!!  I liked the blueberries but will never use the spices again.  I don't think that they went with the cranberries at all.

WOW, this is delicious.  I did add about 1/4 c more sugar, and given I didn't have any blueberries, I used about 1c frozen sweet cherries.  I hope I don't eat the whole bowl before dinner.

My family really enjoyed this cranberry sauce!  It was a nice change from the usual cranberry sauce we have at Thanksgiving.  I used orange juice instead of water to add a little citrus flavor.  I also had to adjust the sugar to make it a touch sweeter.  Very unusual but very delicious :)

This recipe had wonderful flavor ! I used orange sections and a tiny bit of the orange rind instead of the blueberries (will try those next) When sectioning the orange catch juice in a bowl and combine with water to make up the called for amount. The spices gave it a uniquely different added touch lacking in the canned stuff. Thanks for sharing the recipe !

This was really good.  I increased the sugar & cut back on the allspice & nutmeg.  The left overs were really good mixed in with nonfat vanilla yogurt or nonfat cottage cheese.

I've always been too afraid to eat that jelly can-shaped mold at Thanksgiving, so I have nothing to compare this to.  I thought this recipe tasted good.  My husband said it's definitely the best cranberry sauce he's had - if you like cranberry sauce, you'll love this recipe.  Everybody at the table raved about it.  I had one warm and one cold dish - they all went for the warm one.

This recipe was not only easy to make but it recieved rave reviews at our Thanksgiving table this year. I did a half cup water and half cup brandie because we like the brandy flavor in our sauce and this was just SOOOOO good.

A beautiful sauce that is easy to prepare. I occasionally substitute cranberry or orange juice for the water to intensify flavor. I increased the sugar to one cup to reduce tartness. I took the advice of previous postings and prepared it a day ahead. A neighbor also suggested substituting a good red wine in place of the water or fruit juices and serve with pork tenderloin.

A very different way to make cranberry sauce.  The spices are perfect for the sauce.  I have made it with and without the blueberries.

This was easy and yummy, just as I had hoped from reading the other reviews.  My boyfriend loves berries and tart things so I used lots of blueberries (frozen) and raspberries. Right after I made it we thought it was a little sweet and sugery but after a day or so it became perfectly tart!

Very good but extremely tart.  don't take this to a family gathering if you have family like I do - they won't eat anything that is remotely different.  Otherwise, it is very good

I have been making this recipe for years - it’s easy, uses less sugar than other recipes and tastes fantastic   I make extra and freeze it. We haven’t tried it on pancakes yet, but it’s great with roast chicken.  Really a favorite!

I made this according to the recipe for Thanksgiving (plus a generous splash of bourbon) and it was exceptional! It is not as sweet as traditional cranberry sauce, but a colorful, unexpected side for turkey. And spreading on leftover rolls. And adding to oatmeal. And topping waffles!

I used frozen blueberries, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and STEVIA.  Next time I'd like to try cherries in this as well.  It was a little bit tangy, so I added a wee bit more stevia.

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever had.  I replaced some of the sugar with stevia, with total sweetener of about 2/3 cup.  I use 1 cup blueberries to a package of cranberries.  Fresh or frozen work equally well.  Even those who say they don't like cranberry sauce will eat his.

Don't love cranberry sauce, but this was very good as far as cranberry sauce goes. We used the leftovers on our oatmeal and pancakes the morning after Thanksgiving.

I wanted to try this to get some blueberries in my diet as I'm not a huge fan of blueberries, but they are sooo good for you. I modified the recipe a bit - used half brown sugar and half white, used half orange juice and half water. The only thing I wasn't really a fan of was that the blueberries were an odd texture compared to the cranberries. As someone who isn't a big fan of blueberries, it made the dish a bit less wonderful. The flavor was great though.

So good!  I used frozen blueberries and they worked just fine.  I also increased the sugar to 3/4 c, as other reviewers indicated it needed to be sweeter.  It was definitely sweet enough!

This recipe was delicious. I had to add extra sugar but I'm not sure I had exactly the right amount of cranberries -- they were frozen from last year. I don't recall if anyone ate it with their turkey, but it was thoroughly enjoyed over cream cheese with crackers on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic.  I was tasked with making a cranberry compote for my thanksgiving food item this year, and I went with a recipe from food network at first... Emeril's recipe, to be specific.  It turns out that his recipe was utter garbage, and tasted like the bottom of a litterbox.    This recipe, on the other hand, was amazing... I did a small amount of customization, substituting orange juice for the water, reducing the amount of cinnamon, and adding a slightly larger amount of nutmeg and blueberries.  It turned out great, and I want to thank the author for the recipe!  Nice work!

Oh my stars! I am not a big fan of cranberries by themselves as  I think they are too sour but the added blueberries makes this dish very yummy.  A Thanksgiving favorite for sure.

This recipe is the best!!  I use orange juice instead of water- that way you don't need to add any extra sugar.  I also add a pint of red raspberries and the flavors blend wonderfully!!

I followed the recipe but only for 1/2 batch because my kids don't really care for cranberry sauce.  I really enjoyed the addition of the blueberries, but needed to add more sugar.  I like tart, but this was pucker tart.  I probably added about an extra 1/4 cup.

UPDATE: THIS MADE A LOT, SO I TOOK SOME TO MY MOM & DAD (MOM LOVES MY TRAD. CRANBERRY SAUCE & ASKS ME TO MAKE IT EVERY TDAY). SURPRISINGLY, THEY DID NOT CARE FOR THIS. BOTH FELT IT WAS TOO SPICY (???). OK, here's the deal. I've recently had a hankering for cran relish (guess I didn't get enough of it during the holidays lol). I purchased quite a few 12 oz. bags of fresh cranberries while they were on sale back in Nov. as I was planning to make a LOT of cranberry dishes. Sadly, I never got around to making any of them.... I froze what I had, so that it would be easy to take out what I needed when I needed to (I forgot to thaw for this recipe, so I ran my bag under lukewarm H2O for 5 min. or so). I am hoping to make a slow cooked turkey next wk. I want to serve it w/ all the fixins' - cran sauce, stuffing, dinner rolls, etc. I figure, if I don't get around to making this in the next coming wk., I'll just freeze this until I need it. I must admit I was not sure I was going to like this at all, initially. I am not a fan of cooked blueberries (although I enjoy them fresh), but was so intrigued, I had to give this a try. I am soooo glad I did! The spices are AWESOME (they make the dish)!!! The blueberries are a surprisingly nice add. And if you sub. OJ for the H2O called for (I always do this), this is extra super yummy!!!! I still prefer Holiday Cranberry Sauce (MARJK), but this is a close 2nd! Thanks for sharing, Connie! :-)

The best cranberry sauce ever!!!!  It was so-o-o easy to make, and tasted even better the next day, allowing the spices to infuse longer in with the fruit.  (I did add a cup of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup recommended.)  Ohh, it is wonderful - it tastes and smells like Christmas.  I'd definitely give this recipe a try.

I've used this every year since I discovered it five years ago, and it's always delicious.  I use 1 cup of sugar (instead of 1/2), freshly grated nutmeg, and fresh squeezed orange juice instead of water.  I've tried adding raspberries, and it's great that way.  This year I added the arils of one pomegranate instead (with the pint of blueberries), and it's my favorite so far.  I do use frozen berries, since they're out of season, and frozen berries are juicier this time of year.  Highly recommended recipe!  Leftovers: add a spoonful or two to cold sparkling water for a delicious drink.  The kids LOVE this!

This is good but I don't recommend it for those who want the taste of cranberries for the traditional holiday meal. The blueberries overtake the flavor.

This cranberry sauce was the best I have ever had! The blueberries make it two steps ahead of any traditional recipe. I could not find fresh blueberries in our local stores when I made this (for Thanksgiving), but I used frozen for both and it still came out fantastic. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from typical cranberry sauce on the Thanksgiving table!

I've made this every year since I found the recipe.  Love it!  I now judge those who use canned sauces!  Based on the comments I sub orange juice for the water and I reduce the spices a bit as I feared it would be a bit "potpourri-ish" and I like it, but I don't know what it's like w/ the full spices so I can't say it wouldn't be great as written.  I use frozen blueberries, folded in after the heat is off. I also add a little orange extract.  It's good warm, it's good chilled, it's good today and good tomorrow.  Yum!  I love the tartness, so I didn't add add'l sugar, but your mileage may vary.  This is so easy and quick and yummy that there is just no reason to use canned!

Update: I subbed the juice from a fresh-squeezed orange for part of the liquid, plus the zest, & liked the result. My mother-in-law likes this so much , she is adamant about having it on the table every year -- & keeps all the left-overs, too! : )

Yummy! I also used frozen blueberries, & was pleased with the result. I love the blueberries so much, though, I'll probably add some extra next time I prepare this.

I have made this sauce for the past three years for Thanksgiving.  It is becoming a tradition because people like it so much.  The only change I had to make is using frozen blueberries because fresh are hard to find.

I used mixed field berries in place of straight blueberries and I love this sauce!  I make it every year, and it's such a nice change from traditional cranberry sauce (which I don't like anyways!).  Leftover are perfect in muffins.

Love this! I always make mine fresh, but wanted to cut back on the sugar, this worked perfectly. I used half water, half orange juice, added orange zest, and left out the spices. I like mine tart, so it was perfect for me. Great on ice cream too! Only bad thing is that it is totally addictive.

I always make fresh cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving only to see most of it thrown out--more of a tradition than a dish people really like.  This Blue Cranberry Sauce was a hit this Thanksgiving.  Not a drop was thrown away and everyone was commenting on how great it way.

This is an awesome recipe.  I've been making this dish for years and each year my family asks me to bring it to our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.

I was reading some of the reviews and was amazed at the 1-star reviews.  I guess you can't please everybody.  If I can offer a suggestion, at least to those that said the flavors didn't mix correctly, make this dish early and let it sit in the fridge for at least a day in an air-tight container before serving.  You'll notice a huge difference in how the flavors come together.

Enjoy!

What a refreshing change from regular cranberry sauce.  My only suggestion for the next time I make this will to ease up just a tad on the spices.  I let the sauce sit over night so everything could blend together.

I was a little worried, but it was a great hit at Thanksgiving. You definitely need to make it at least a few days ahead. I also thought it tasted better not directly out of the fridge. Heat it up or let it get closer to room temperature. I added orange zest and extra sugar. Next time I will add less blueberries. They kind of take over as is.

This is good!!  I left it pretty chunky, with lots of whole berries like in the picture.  this might have been forbidding to some of the canned-cranberry-sauce type people at my thanksgiving, but if they we're put off, they didn't say anything and ate it anyway.

I just made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  My very picky 6 and 8 year olds tried it and loved it.  I did increase the sugar and used frozen blueberries.  I;m sure it will only get better after it sits.

this is very good.  thanks for the suggestion of using orange juice in place of water.  A snap to prepare.  I think next time I would leave out the allspice.  Thickens very nicely.  Used brown sugar and after reading the reviews, did decide that it needed a bit more sweetener.  Subbed the rest of the sugar with sugar substitute to taste.

This is a great twist on cranberry sauce.  I made it tonight so that the flavors would be well blended by Thanksgiving.  My husband liked it much better once I added in more sugar.  I ended up adding almost double the amount of sugar and fresh orange zest.  Next time I will try the suggestion of using OJ instead of water.  Looking forward to serving this on Thursday!

I made this for my parents for Thanksgiving dinner, but I got a taste before taking it over to them. It was absolutely the best cranberry sauce I've ever tasted! Forget the canned stuff & the jellied stuff - no wonder I didn't like cranberry sauce before, but this was absolutely tasty! I will be making it for myself next time.

I have made this two years in a row for Thanksgiving and it is a hit. The kids love it. Leftovers a great with chicken port and just plan good from the container alone. Freeze what is left over in single servings. Great to add to a quick meal to make is seem fancy

2005 update... year three. I am making a double batch this year for Thanksgiving. Instead of fresh blueberries I have purchsed a package of Dole frozen mixed berries. This is a little less expensive and the different berries add something extra special. Looks like we may get snowed in this year so I will have it all to myslef :o)

Easy to make, nutrious, and yummy.  Chunks of blueberries and cranberries gave it a nice chunky texture and appearance.

I used frozen blueberries for this.  I thought the flavor was very refreshing, and the color was beautiful.  It was fun listening to the cranberries burst as I made this easy dish.  But I won't be keeping the recipe because my husband did not like the spices.  He proved exactly how much of a whole-berry-sauce-in-the-can guy he is.

No one at my house liked this dish.  I had to add more sugar to save it.  Next time I'll use cranberry juice instead of water and I'll cut the allspice/nutmeg in half.

The flavors didn't quite meld together, so one bite tasted mildly sweet and the next bitter could be unpleasantly bitter.

This is definitely a tart dish. I added more sugar but then didn't care for the "sugary" texture.  Due to the season, I used frozen blueberries and this probably made a difference.  I'll try it again since my Thanksgiving crowd seemed to like it, but I think I'll sweeten the blueberries ahead of time as a separate step and see how that works. I must say, though, it's certainly a pretty dish on the table!

I really wasn't very impressed with this cranberry sauce.  I made the recipe just as written except for using frozen blueberries instead of fresh.  It was "ok" but nothing special.  I didn't really like the spices, they were rather overpowering to the flavor of the berries.  I don't think I would make this recipe again without some modifications.

My husband grew up in Maine, so he adores both blueberries and cranberries.  He thought this dish was fantastic!  Probably his favorite part of our Thanksgiving meal.  I'm not much of a cranberry lover, but I still thought it was very good.  The spices make this dish outstanding!  Very easy to make as well.

I made this for my husband this Thanksgiving.  I wanted to make his a fresh version rather than the canned stuff that makes that funny suction noise when you remove it from the can.  He did not like this and neither did I.  We agreed that it was too tart (and he likes his sauce less chunky) so we made it into a jam like consistency and added additional sugar.  We still did not like it.  The allspice flavor is too much.  I felt like I was eating a bag of potpourri.  To each his or her own.  Looks like it's the funny looking canned stuff for us.

Be very careful if you are scaling this recipe.  I had scaled it for 15 servings using both the scaling option and the shopping list option. When I was preparing this recipe I used both interchangeably and what a mistake. The recipe had printed for 15 and the shopping list printed for 9 servings.   It tasted so horrible that I had to throw it out.  This was a very expensive dish.  I invested $29.00.  Blueberries this time of year cost a fortune. I am so bummed out.

This was a very good recipe, though I was expecting it to be a little less tart. I think next time I will use a little more sugar. I had to use frozen blueberries...we live in Arizona and only get inexpensive fresh blueberries for a very short time in the summer.

I wish I read the review regarding using more sugar and some rasberries! This just received an ok rating from the family. The general feeling is that it really needed more sugar and maybe some orange zest to provide a little extra zip. No one thought about adding rasberries! I may try it again because it has potential but will have to add to this recipe.

Giving it 5 stars even though it was very runny, which might have been due to how I cooked the cranberries. I didn't want any skins so I strained the mashed cranberries and put the remaining skins and flesh in my food processor before putting back in the bowl with the juice. I added equal parts of blueberries and raspberries. I also used orange juice for the water as per other reviewers. Everyone LOVED the flavor and put it on the rolls, ice cream, pancakes, etc. Thanksgiving and the following four days. I will make this again but try to get it a little thicker.

This is a great cranberry recipe. Very easy, very tasty. The blueberries add a different taste that makes this dish especially tasty. For those who think of the canned stuff when you hear of cranberry sauce, this will make you realize fresh cranberry sauce is so much more superior that you’ll never go back. The recipe is easy and relatively quick to make. You could have your children make it while you’re preparing the rest of the Thanksgiving meal.

I think substituting orange juice for the water brings this recipe up to scrumptious.

I LOVE this cranberry sauce! One of my favorites and SO EASY!! The batch I make for the family dinner I use extra sugar. I usually make another batch for myself and, while I haven't figured out the right amount, I sub applesauce for the white sugar. Maybe this year will be the year I get it perfect :)

I followed the directions on the cranberry bag 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar. I added the spices and when the cranberries were cooked I added 1 cup blueberries and 1 cup raspberries. Came out great. Will definitely make this again.

Instead of the different spices, I use half a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Also, I threw everything in and cooked it up together.  Came out amazing.

Really delicious.  I made it as described in the recipe.  Even though I love my previous cranberry recipe my kids would never eat it.  This one got raves reviews and I didn't have a ton left over.  It is good warm or cold.

Good recipe but you really do need a whole cup of sugar. The blueberry's are a nice addition. Home made is so easy & so much better than canned. Glad more ppl are returning to making things from scratch.

This was a tailor made recipe for my family.  Some members can't have citrus and most cranberry sauce recipes have use oranges.  The blueberries make it special.  I may try it with the cup of sugar instead of a half cup as recommended by some reviewers however my husband thinks it's perfect as is.

I love this and I have never been a cranberry sauce fan. I hope it lasts till Thanksgiving as I made it Tuesday night. I thought the amount if sugar was perfect for my taste. I just used a 4.4 oz package of blueberries (expensive enough in my town!) and that, too was perfect. A pint might have been more blueberry than cranberry but probably good, too. I had no idea a homemade cranberry sauce could be so easy, either. 5 stars!

I really love the fall flavor that the spices add!  The blueberries are also a great touch.  I also added a full cup of sugar and it cut some of the tartness.  I will definitely make this easy recipe again!

The only changes I made were to use half the blueberries and half the cranberries.  This resulted in a very good sauce with a very subtle tart.  Served it on crepes as a desert.

I just made this last night and it was wonderful. I didn't have any allspice, so I added 1/4 tsp of ginger instead. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added almost 1 C sugar. I can't wait until tomorrow's Thanksgiving meal to try it on our smoked turkey. I expect there won't be any left!

I needed to add 1/2 cup more sugar.  It was too tart for me, but I like sweet.  And please be careful with the spices.  Allspice and Nutmeg are very strong and can overpower the cranberry flavor.

Every time I make this recipe it always gets compliments and the bowl is empty by the end of the meal.  It's a lot more subtle than original cranberry sauce - less of a bite, but it blends so beautifully with turkey and stuffing that I've definitely had to make it a "signature" on Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I can't believe that I forgot to rate this one! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I did add some blackberries and raspberries as well and my cranberries very exceptionally tart, so I used a little more sugar than called for.

This does need more sugar because the sauce was just a little too tart.  It was good though and I'm sure it is healthier than the canned stuff!

Have been making this for several years, and we absolutely love it!  I now have my two boys hooked as well.  We started with it as a Thanksgiving dish, but now make it continually during cranberry season.  I do add an additional 1/8 cup sugar to cut down on the tartness, and instead of two cups blueberries, I always use 1 cup blueberries, 1/2 cup blackberries, and 1/2 cup raspberries.  I could eat the whole bowl full myself!  YUM!!

This was good, but I think fresh cranberry sauce without blueberries is much better. This left my guests asking "What's that taste in here?" since the blueberries were only slightly noticeable.

I make this every year at Thanksgiving and my picky family even likes it!  I do add about a 1/4 cup extra sugar so it's not as bitter.  Other than that, it's perfect!

I've been making this the last few years for Thanksgiving and it is now a family and workplace favorite.  Occassionally, I mix in a little bit of orange juice, but overall, the recipe is great as is.

Good chutney/cranberry Sauce. We really enjoyed the taste the blueberry added to the sauce. I did add some chopped apples to the mix and 1/4 tsp of ginger. This was a great addition to our Thanksgiving meal.

Made this for this Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit!  I used sweetened dried blueberries, as that's what I already had, and added a splash of apple juice to make sure there was enough liquid.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  This was sweet and tart at the same time, and went really well with our fried turkey.  Mom froze some to have when she is craving something sweet with cream cheese, but have already been requested to make this again.

Absolutely fantastic! I will make this every year! I read every single review. Based on the number of suggestions to add sugar, I did. I used 1 c. of sugar rather than 1/2 c. I also used a 1/2 orange juice, 1/2 water combination rather than the 1 c. water. This was the best sauce EVER! Thank you!!

I just finished making this for the second year in a row. I love the idea of it, the look and the different textures. I did find however that the 3 spices (Cinnamon, Allspice and Nutmeg) Completely overpowered the dish. I remember I felt this way last year too. What I ended up doing was making a second batch without the spices and mixing them together,

Love it now!

I'm so excited that it's almost Thanksgiving again and I get to make this sauce. Huge hit with all my guests last year. I also took it to my grandmothers house for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!! I add blackberries to mine as well as blueberries. It taste great either way!!

This was really nice for Thanksgiving. While it doesn't make it "blue" this is also great with a pint of fresh raspberries instead of blueberries. Such a delicious spin on traditional cranberry sauce

What a fabulous cranberry sauce this is!! I did have to use 3/4 cup sugar and used a bit less allspice.  The spice combination was perfect.  This will be a "must have" addition to our Thanksgiving table.

This is such a great recipe!!!  I decided to make it for Thanksgiving - I doubled the recipe, added the extra sugar as others recommended and only used a little cinnamon.  I gave half to my neighbor and took the rest to my mother-in-laws.  All I can say is there was none left at our dinner and my neighbor called to say they were scraping the bowl.  This is a new Thanksgiving recipe for our family!  Thanks!

Blueberries were a good idea.  I use O.J. instead of water, and .75 cups of sugar.  Tried a test batch with spices and didn't care for them so I left out the spices in the final product.

This was a huge hit when I made it last year--it was the first time I cooked Thanksgiving dinner as a married woman and new mommy and everyone loved it, including the my 10 month old! Everyone loved it so much that they asked me to make it again this year.

I love this recipe. I make it every year just for me, since my husband won't eat cranberrys and we do Thanksgiving as a duo. I put in slightly less sugar and serve the leftovers over ice cream.

I don't like cranberries but had to make something to have on the table for Thanksgiving. This was a huge hit with everyone.

This recipe is great.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it.  I doubled the sugar so that it wouldn't be too tart.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2006.  Im personally not a cranberry sauce fan but I really enjoyed this.  I added a little more suger and took it light on the spices (omitted the allspice cuz i didnt have any) as some reviewers suggested.  I served some as is, and also as an appetizer over a block of cream cheese with ritz crackers for dipping as one recipe on all recipes suggested.  One family member said it was the best cranberry sauce she'd ever had!

Great cranberry sauce recipe with a twist! The blueberries added a little extra sweetness. I used a little orange juice in lieu of water alone. Also, for simplicity, I used one 12-oz. bag each of cranberries and frozen blueberries.

This sauce was colorful, sweet, spicy, & tart all in one bite.  I took the advice of others to cook the cranberries in OJ instead of water. I also added orange zest. Everyone seemed to enjoy it with our Thanksgiving dinner. I personally thought the spices overwhelmed the dish just a tad, so I will cut them back a bit next time.

I loved this. I left out the spices, used oj instead of water and kept sugar the same. I'll make again, but might leave out oj as the orange flavor kind of overpowered the blueberry, or I might squish the blueberries so they juice up more.

We're having another mini-Thanksgiving tomorrow, so I made this up this morning and had a taste of it.  It's delicious!  I halved the recipe for just three of us, added a bit of extra sugar as it was quite tart, and I used frozen blueberries.  Thanks so much, Connie!

Great idea! We preferred much less cinnamon, though, and doubled the sugar to cut the tartness... Next time I will try with OJ instead of water, and  either leave out the cinnamon or use a dash of each spice instead. Thanks for the inspiration!

What a great recipe! I added a bit of freshly grated orange peel, cut back on the cinnamon but added a pinch each of cloves and ginger, and used a handful of freeze-dried blueberries (because I already had them on hand)instead of fresh. Also, I only had about half a package of cranberries left in the fridge, so that's all I used. This is a very tangy sauce! I served it over pork chops and it was delightful.

I was expecting something a little sweeter.  It was very expensive because of the blueberries.  The blueberries along cost $11.  It was not the hit I was expecting.
