My mil used to bake this for christmas every year and never shared the recipe! I can't say i blame her it's an awesome recipe. She got it from a southern newspaper years ago. I made it last year after cleaning out her kitchen and finding the clipping destroyed by water damage. I found it here and made it for my husband who was so happy to see it on christmas eve. It is like a fruit cake but so much better. Thanks melly

This is a very good cake. The flavor reminds me of a pineapple upside down cake.

This is a modified version of the Franklin Nut cake. Original has one pound of butter and one pound of pecans plus increase in other ingredients too. 16 oz. total of candied fruit (pineapple and cherries) & Weighs almost 6 pounds! We have made it for years as well. 3 hours baking at 250. Cant see lining a fluted pan with paper though and the paper is necessary. It is a great cake for holidays!
