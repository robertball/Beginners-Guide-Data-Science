Super easy and super good. I doubled the recipe and stored in Mason jars.  Wicked on meat balls at a potluck.

Love it!! I keep it in the fridge and use it as a staple to make chicken wings..bake the wings then toss in a metal bowl!! (I add a bit of hot sauce to the bowl to make a honey hot)

Really good taste, not thick enough to coat wings hence the 5 stars.

Excellent!! Much better than store bought.  I did use only water as I did not have chicken broth, and it was still amazing.

This was exactly what I was craving! I brushed it on chicken drumsticks 3 or 4 times as they were baking at 375 for an hour, and it was delish! Had lots of leftover sauce after 12 baked drumsticks, so will try to use it tomorrow.

1.22.17  We found this sauce just a bit too sweet for our tastes, but admittedly, that could be personal taste preference.  It added a nice touch to some simple steamed brussels sprouts.
