This was my first attempt at beer butt chicken, and hopefully someone will give it a better picture than I did.  It was very moist and flavorful, and that came mostly from the beer--even though I used Coors Light, a very lightweight beer!  I had a difficult time getting the ranch dressing to stick to it, so my glaze didn't turn out quite like the author intended.  I will look forward to trying it again after I read some helpful hints by other reviewers.  Thanks for a great foray into beer butt chicken!

Loved it! Moist and delicious! My wife added some other herbs to the glaze and I added some garlic pepper and salt and pepper in the beer. Even my picky kids loved it and we're asking for more.
