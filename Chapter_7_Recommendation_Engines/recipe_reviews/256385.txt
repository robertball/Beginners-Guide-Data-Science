I made this French Martini just as instructed...and it is perfect!  Didn't add the lemon and pineapple garnish to the finished martini.  Bought a six pack of canned pineapple juice.  Made a bottle of it and took to a pool party.  Just shake and pour.  All of the ladies loved it.

1.27.17  Had a fresh pineapple, but not enough fresh pineapple juice, so I had to resort to using a can of pineapple juice....aaaaargh!   Mixed it up, tasted it, and added more Chambord.  This was good, but I still prefer a regular very dry gin martini with a twist of lemon.
