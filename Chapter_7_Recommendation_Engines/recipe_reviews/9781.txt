These did not turn out well. The flavor was mild/boring, the dough very sticky even after refrigeration and the glaze needed lemon flavoring not just lemon juice. I was very disappointed as they sounded great and I made them for a party.

This recipe made a really wonderful batch of cookies. Not too sweet, more of an old-fashioned flavor. I ended up letting them chill for 24 hours. My cookies took a little more than 10 minutes to brown, and finished hardening up after I set them on the cooling rack. I’m sure they would be great with coconut essence instead of/in combination with the vanilla. I bet adding lavender to the glaze would be great too. I’ll be making these again. They would pair well with a black tea, especially earl grey.
