Thank you, Aronna! I now use this recipe all the time, sometimes with the herb filling, sometimes without. The  tender, fine texture and crisp crust make this bread wonderful either way. I've also split the dough to make two baugettes. (To get the extra crisp, crunchy crust of baugettes, put a pan full of boiling water in the oven with the bread while baking.)

OH MY GOSH!!I will be taking this bread everywhere I go from now on!I will have so many friends!I added more if the filling,but I don't recomend doing this.It made the bread too hard to fully cook in the middle and even then it was a bit slimy inside.Next time I will leave well enough alone and make it the way the recipe says.Oh,I did sprinkle a little fresh parmasian over the topping before I rolled it up.This would have been good with the right amount of butter and onion.Make this bread!You'll be glad you did!

Awesome bread!  This was my first attempt at yeast bread without a bread machine, and it turned out great - not as hard as I thought! (although it *did* take some time)  Do let the filling cool before applying to the dough, as has already been suggested.  Next time I think I'll add some cheese too.  Delicious!

I loved this bread.  The dough was a pleasure to work with even when mixing completely by hand.  I did not have parsley for the filling, so I used oregano instead (I prefer this herb anyway).  The bread had a wonderful texture and the crust was delicate and just a bit flaky.  The taste was sensational, not over-powering but very flavorful.  I ate a third of the loaf hot out of the oven and the rest was the next days breakfast and lunch.  It was great cold and reheated nicely.  I will be making this again for company and for myself.  Aronna Palmer, you have found a truly beautiful recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

I thought the onion flavor was too strong. My husband enjoyed it, but I would change the herbs around a little bit.

Good recipe.  I do 50/50 wheat and white bread flour to add more texture and flavor.  For every cup of wheat flour I add 1 tablespoon of gluten to make up for the wheat's lack of chewiness. I sprinkled fresh rosemary on top and brush with an egg wash.

The filling in this recipe was too strong. Half a cup of minced onion is way too much. The bread itself tasted okay, but turned out very, VERY dense - not what I expected.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this bread did not seem to rise successfully and turned out very dense.  However, the flavor was exceptional, and I may attempt to make this bread again.

This bread may have been some of the best bread of my life. i stuffed it with some colby jack, rosemary, oregano, basil in addition to the garlic and onions and some crushed red pepper. It was finished before it had a chance to cool off.

this bread was good and easy to make, but the onion mixture was a little salty.  I will be making this again with sell salt.

I make this recipe all the time and I love it!  You can really play with different kind of herbs in order to make a bread that compliments your main dish.  Something I like to do is this: Once the bread is rolled, I cut it up the way you would with cinammon rolls.  Then, I make little rolls that each have a ribbon of herbs through them.  Guests love them!

Mmmmm...so tasty! The only thing that disappointed me was the way it toasts.  It just sorta...warmed, and never really got crusty and crunchy.  I think thats because of the amount of butter used in the herb filling.  I'm not sure if I'll make it again ('cause there are sooo many great recipes here, and I don't want to commit myself to just one!) but if I do I will most definately cut down the butter by at least half.

This sounded so good that I made a double batch then cut each loaf into thirds before baking (I was planning on using it to fill Christmas baskets)...the family ate most of it before I could get it into the freezer! Yummy!

I made this recipe as a change from the usual Easter egg breads and was amazed!  It was a huge success.  I have had several people ask me for the recipe already.

For the effort, this bread just didn't cut it for me. Was way too sticky given the quantities stated, had to add much more flour.

This was an amazing bread. As soon as the buzzer went off I brushed it with butter and parsley and in my mouth it went! I promptly ran to my neighbors and gave her a slice. It is heaven!

This bread was somewhat of a dissapointment as it was not a french bread but rather just a white pan bread.  Also I think that the filling needed to be ccoked down a lot more because it was VERY strong (from the onions).

I probably goofed somewhere, but it turned out too mushy for my taste.  Maybe not what I was expecting.  My friends said they liked it, but I won't be making it again.  Thanks anyway.

This recipe is a great hit. I made it for my mother-in-law and she loved it. I fill it with butter, garlic, and mozzarella cheese. Let your filling cool before adding it to your bread.

This is excellent bread and very easy to make!  I can't stop eating it.  I made the filling first so it would be cool when I added it to the bread.  Great the next day too, you don't need any butter!

I have to admit - when I made this bread I was a skeptic, one tablespoon of yeast for one loaf of bread seemed like a lot to me and I thought the end result would be a very yeasty tasting bread; boy was I wrong!  This bread was delicious!  The only reason I have not given it 5 stars is because I feel it needs more of the onion garlic filling, so next time I think I will increase it by 50% (using 3/4 cup onion and 2 cloves of garlic).  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a lovely bread, although it is not a 'french bread' in the literal sense.  Classic french has no oil, only water, flour, yeast, and salt.  But this was a wonderful way to create a lovely herbed bread that presents well.  Read the reviews and saw the problems with the bread not staying together when rolled so I did not add chopped onions but instead added 3 tsp. dehydrated onions to my milk, butter mixture and added to the dough itself.  I then proceeded to make the herb paste without the onion but with everything else.  This rose nicely and is pretty much spot on with the amt. of flour.  A lovely texture and not too sweet, not too salty but just right.  I could taste the onion in the bread so did not miss out on the onion flavor. Divided this into two loaves and brushed the tops with eggwash and sprinkled sesame seeds. Lovely to go with "Restuarant style rotisserie chicken" with the herbed theme.

Excellent flavor and texture, directions thorough and easy to follow.  I used 1/2 garlic clove and kneaded the bread using the mixing bowl (just keep flouring hands as you go along).

This turned out really well.  It rose fairly quickly, rose well, and tasted very good.  It wasn't as hard to make as it sounded.  This would be a great loaf to make if you happen to have company coming over or just want to feel like a gourmet chef.

This bread was excellent!  Don't rush the rising time though, let it rise to double before baking.

Well, we messed up a couple places on this one (rolled the bread in the wrong direction, forgot to let it rise the last time we were in a hurry), but it still was the hit of the dinner.  A 3 year old who will not eat anything loved it and got seconds.  The sky is the limit when it comes to what herbs we will use next time.

This was actually my first-ever attempt at bread baking. Amazingly, it came out great. I substituted the parsley with chopped fresh watercress...I should have used a bit more, but it came out great regardless. Everyone who tried it loved it.

This bread is excellent.  My entire family loved it and was gone the day I made it. 
I'm new to making bread and this was very easy.  Will keep this recipe and use often.

This bread gets raves everytime I make it!!  I switch steps 4 and 5 because if the filling is too warm the bread will not rise properly again.

Awesome bread with a few minor adjustments after attempt no 1. I cut the amount of onion in half and rather than melting the butter I just used softened butter and made a paste of the onion, garlic, butter, herbs as this enabled me to spread this over the dough before rolling (melting the butter meant the mixture was too fluid and just squeezed out the sides!). With these alterations the bread was very nice.

First of all these were very good and I will be making it again.  You could fill it with anything I was even thinking if you added 2 more tablespoons of sugar to the dough you could add fruit or other sweet things to it. But it is important to remember that this is not a true french bread (crusty with soft middle). I do have some advice though.  Some of the reviews said they had trouble getting the dough to rise and I figured out that a tablespoon of yeast is two of the packets, I had no trouble with the dough rising.  I also used olive oil in the dough I don't like to use to much butter and I do like the flavor of olive oil.  I doubled the onion and the garlic and the butter in the onion mixture.  I also added parm cheese.  I made two loaves.  Very good and not that had to make.  Other advice was it was very easy to make the milk mixture to hot that would cause the bread not to rise.

My family loved this recipe! I did change the margarine to olive oil, left out the parsley and added 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning and doubled the garlic.  Leave your butter so its just barely spreadable and you will not have a problem with rolling and having the filling oozing out. Thanks for the recipe.

The filling was nice, but it needed a LOT more garlic.  The texture of the bread itself was nice, but I actually prefer the texture of a different Cinnamon Raisin bread on Allrecipes.com.  I will use the filling (with more garlic) and the other recipe next time.

This bread was pretty good, but I found that it dried out WAY to fast. I did pull it out of the oven too soon because I thought it was done (it wasn't!) and had to put it back in, so it got some funny wrinkles on top of the loaf. The bread also spread out a lot in the oven...it seemed to rise out instead of up. The onion filling was good, and it had great flavor, but there wasn't enough of it. If I make this again, I'll definitely double the amount of filling. I ended up using the leftover dry pieces to make breadcrumbs, which I used to coat chicken pieces. Thanks for sharing the recipe, but I don't think I'll be making this again.

Five star! I've made this bread three times in the last month, and it's been a consistent hit. Someone asked me to give them the name of the bakery! 

I leave out the onions and instead spread the dough with olive oil, herbs, garlic, and a little salt.

This bread has way too much onion in it.  The dough by itself was okay, but when you added the filling, it tasted like very strong onion rolls.

Good one!! Different taste.Preplan your main entre to go with this bread. The bread will be little sour. Add chopped jalapenos and cheese. Just use one Tb of butter for inside filling for little dry. I divided into two loaves. My good suggestion make half the filling for one loaf only. Fill the second loaf with 2 tb butter with 2 tb cinnamon and 5 tb brownsugar. Roll up, cover and refrigerate for next morning breakfast bread.

This bread is delicious. I made two loaves and froze one for dinner another night. Next time though, I want to put the herbs in the dough rather than roll them in it. I used another review's tip and placed a small pan of water in the oven. I enjoyed how that made the crust turn out.  Recipe was very easy and will be making this again.

I love this bread and so does my family.  It is nice and crusty on the bottom and soft and chewy on the inside and the filling is super flavorful.  I did not use a mixer but did everything by hand and used real butter in place of margarine.  This would go great with just about anything.  A little time consuming but well worth the effort.

Overall, this bread was delicious and I think the dough is versatile enough to use for other stuffed bread recipes.  It rose perfectly for all rises.  I changed the filling to include herbes de provence (personal preference) along with the onion which I cooked until soft in olive oil.  I subbed the butter for 1/4 cup olive oil in the dough and it worked just fine.  Baked for 15 minutes right on the baking stone and another ten minutes on the rack.  I will definitely make this again and will try it rolled with other fillings (ham, cheeses, sausage, veggies, etc.) Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was okay--but all the work of homemade bread should yield something better than just okay. I hoped the savory thread would just blend into the bread, instead it separated like a roll where the herbs were spread.  It also didn't rise as much as a normal loaf, and was sort of dense.  More like a dinner roll than a nice light loaf of bread.  I'll stick to kneading herbs into bread or ribbons with less fat so they blend into the bread.

I loved this recipe.  I made lasanga for dinner and invited some people over and they loved the bread as well.  I tweaked the recipe a little.  I didn't quite add 1/2 cup of onion, and I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of one to give it some added garlic flavor.  I also added some rosemary garlic seasonings that I had on hand.  I used 4 T. of butter instead of 2 T. because it didn't spread over the entire rolled out dough.  I also added some parmesan cheese.  It was gone in 1 day!  Next time I will try adding mozzarella cheese! Thanks for the great recipe.

This bread had way too much onion and garlic for my taste. Although I thought the flavor was much too strong, it was still a good flavor.

Also, I got the not-so-bright idea of trying to make individual rolls out of it *after* I'd already rolled it up like a jelly roll.  Bad move - it didn't rise and just generally turned out bad.  Should have left it in a loaf.

Very Tasty Bread! I substitute 1/2 TBS white distilled vinegar and Â½ TBS Balsamic Vinegar for 1TBS vinegar. I like to use this bread recipe to make Stromboli. Really anything can go in the middle. It is a very impressive bread with very little work.

This is the best french bread I have ever eaten!  I ended up making it into smaller loaves so we could use it for French dip sandwiches.  I also didn't have crusty bread, but I maybe just needed to cook it longer to make it crusty, I love soft bread though so it was fine with me.  It had the best taste and texture.  I left out the seasonings and substituted soy milk for the regular milk and olive oil instead of butter because my daughter has a dairy intolerance and it was awesome!  Everyone who ate them didn't even notice the substitutions and they don't touch soy milk.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This was so easy to make, looked nice as well. I added a tad too much butter, I brushed on butter after it was made then added a little more to each piece (which I shouldn't had done). The inside is very doughy that is why I shouldn't have put on extra butter, I only messed up a few slices though. Next time I would add Cheese or another filling to it, You really couldn't taste the onions or garlic much, maybe a little something extra to spice it up, I guess next time I'll see what's in the frig/cabinet when cooking and go from there. This was the first French Bread I'v ever made and I have to say, I really liked it, this is a good recipe, just needs a few modifications to my "SPICY" Louisiana Taste buds, haha!
I will most likely use this one again, thanks for submitting.

I've begun a new "hand made" bread phase in my life...this is a good, simple recipe. I didn't use the herb filling but I'm sure that will be fantastic next time I make this. I appreciate everyone's notes about making this by hand--my bread machine is packed up (somewhere!) after moving. I proofed and cooked this in a round 2 qt pyrex bowl and it was an awesome go with for spaghetti. Thanks for the recipe!

This was tasty; however, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  The bread itself was denser than I was expecting and the filling made it taste more like a garlic bread, than an herb bread.  I might make it again, but I'm also going to keep looking for a different herbed bread.

I used my kitchen aid (makes bread so much easier) After adding the cup & 1/2 of flour I switched to my dough hook and let the machine do the kneading. I see what others mean by the onions, I read that so I didn't add that much and I used a shallot and green onion but it still had that predominent onion flavor. Next time I'll use only a shallot and I think I may add sliced stuffed green olives. With the herb mixture I needs the total time in the oven otherwise it's liable to be doughy, also next time I'll spritz the oven w/water so the crust is "crustier". I will make again and just experiment with flavors.

This is an amazing bread. I served it for dinner with home made pasta sauce and spaghetti and my husband, who is Italian, LOVED it. He only asked that I double the amount of onions next time. I have since made it three times with extra onions and I have passed the recipe along to our families, who also love it.

This is a great bread recipe. I used pesto, onion, and garlic and the flavor was very good! The only problem I had was the baking temp. Next time, I will bake it at 375 vs 400. The bottom came out way to dark.

I just made this for the 4th of July.  The only change I made was to use Rosemary for the herb.  It was amazing.  I am known for my baking and my husband said it was the best I have ever made.  Thank you Aronna for a wonderful recipe.

Really good flavor.  The bread is tender and the filling is nice.  Next time I make it I will make divide it into two loaves because I ended up with one large flat loaf.

What a great bread. Flavorful and soft. 
TO THOSE who are having texture problems, or troubles with the dough rising. My suggestion is to always proof the yeast before the baking process. I know active dry yeast is appealing in the sense that you can just mix and go. But that re-assurance that the yeast is healthy and ready to go is priceless in making great bread. I'll be making this again, trying more savory and perhaps some sweet options!

This was my first attempt at making bread and it turned out wonderful! I grated the onion on my cheese grater, this worked great, it blended nicely in the butter. I used fresh basil instead of parley because it's what I had in the garden. Mmm, I can't wait to make this again!!!

This was yummy stuff. By way of yeast breads this dough was  a dreamboat to work with! I found it was easiest to spread the filling by just using one hand and spreading it all over, lol. I also brushed with egg wash and salt rather than the butter and parsley.  I will be making this one again for a different type of french bread.

The bread itself was delicious and had a great texture. The filling was really great too, but there just wasn't enough of it. I'll definitely double the filling and play around with different flavors (italian seasoning,etc.). I will definitely make again! Thanks!

This bread is good! The herbs are good too! Smells like my mom's dressing she makes for turkey dinner during the holidays! I added more parsley and some sage as well as savoury. I think I should have left it in the oven for a tad bit longer too because when I cut it down the centre, it was a bit gooey. With banana bread, I'm ok with it because for some reason, it gets better the next day but I'm not so sure about this bread. I've let it sit for a few hours now and the sides came out perfect but the middle is still a bit gooey. I have no real solution for this, however, so that I don't have to throw those bits out, I'm freezing the bread in slices and then when I want to have a couple of pieces for our supper, I'll bake them again as toast, kind of like deluxe garlic bread with no cheese (mm, though cheese sounds good with this!)see how that goes! I was scared to leave it in the oven for much longer, it was turning pretty dark. Though that way be because I used whole wheat flour instead of white. Anyway, I tried a normal piece and it was great! I surprised myself because I don't usually go outside of baking regular loaf bread and do this kind of fancy bread. I've been known to have some disasters! hehe

Wonderful Bread! A little denser than I expected but it was amazing.
I Used butter and italian seasoning to brush the top and when it came out, it tasted just like the breadsticks at Olive Garden.

This is delicious.  It baked up crunchy and with a nice crumb.  Bf and I aren't huge fans of onion, but we really loved this bread.  It's huge, though.  I was expecting a loaf the size of a baguette and I get something twice as big . . .it rose out, not up, so it was kind of flat and funny looking.  Absolutely delicious, though.  Thanks!

I have made these numerous times... the loaves come out pretty huge so I usually separate it into 4 loaves instead. I bake them all but we only eat one and I freeze the rest... then when I want to use one for dinner I take it out and let it thaw a bit then I wrap it in tinfoil and bake it in the oven for 15 min. like you would the store-bought garlic bread. Love it!

I thought this was delicious.  I doubled the onion and garlic in the filling.  My only problem was that when I cut it, I didn't get solid slices.  The slices "unwound" and I got bread spirals.  I think that cutting it while it was still warm may have caused this?  Who knows.  Tasted great though.

Absolutely AWESOME French bread!  I have made it exactly as the recipe appears, and also without the filling and shaped the dough into breadsticks (spread butter and garlic salt on tops).  FABULOUS!  This one is definitely a keeper!  My family LOVES it!  :o)

a nice loaf of bread with a lovely flavor, though not a french bread.  It didn't have the airy yet crusty quality. More like a white bread with flavorful ribbons.

Excellent! I planned on serving it with dinner today, but we ended up slicing it up and dipping it in pizza sauce for lunch!

I tried this a second time, and used pepperoni and mozzarella instead of the onion spread. I've been asked to make it again and again! Yum!

Wow!  This bread is unbelievably great.  And the smell while cooking--heavenly!  It calls for 1 tablespoon of yeast, and because I buy my yeast in little packets and not jars, I use two packets and it comes out perfect!  One tip, watch the expiration date on yeast--if it's old it may not rise, then it won't bake.  Also, after the dough has risen, if something jars or bumps it and it falls, it will not rise again & then it won't bake.  Enjoy!

Excellent bread! It was relatively easy to make and well worth the effort. While the filling given is delicious in itself, I also added sausage to one of the loaves, which made it very savory.

Wow!!  This bread is really good.  Compared to some breads I have made...this one is pretty easy too.  I love the onion, garlic, and parsley mixture.  I'll make this one again!

Came out good, but next time will add more salt or butter  to the filling (I used unsalted butter) to make the flavor pop more.  May also try with zaâatar seasoning and more garlic.  I will also make it into a loaf and score it as the outside layer did not rise as much as the interior layers.  I also substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour.

A keeper! I didnât have parsley or garlic so I used a teaspoon of herbes de Provence. I also added a little mozzarella cheese inside for my son. Very tasty. Easy recipe. I was exhausted so I skipped the blender stage so I wouldnât have to wash the parts. I just stirred the onion/milk mixture into the flour until it wasnât lumpy. It gets kneaded after all so, it seemed an ok plan. Worked like a charm. One bowl, one pot, one spoon and one cookie sheet. This gets put right next to my easy-breezy beer bread recipe and my bierock dough. Thanks fir sharing!!

Tried this as a sub for garlic bread.  Very bland (very low on salt) and dough was a bit denser than preferred (possibly from forgetting to add the vinegar).  IF I make this again, Iâll triple the salt (used garlic salt) and try to remember vinegar.  Made as 2 baguette-style loaves and brushed lightly with garlic salted butter (couldâve baked about 5 min less than recipe called for). A bit more tolerable sliced with butter, garlic salt, and Parmesan and broiled, but not what I was looking for.

This is my go to recipe whether I add onions and garlic or not. You can cheat and make your dough rise in like 20-30 mins by sticking it in a warm oven. I turn my oven on then turn it off before putting the dough in to rise so it doesnât cook first go round.

I didn't have regular milk - so I used almond milk... and no onions, so I doubled the garlic.  This bread was delicious!  I'm definitely making it again :)

Baked it in traditional French bread loaf, added flax seed, made the dough in a bread machine, let it rise twice in a warmer, baked it under a pan of water for the lower time limit, crust was the softest I have ever ate

I followed the recipe exactly. The bread had an excellent texture and flavor. Today I decided to try it again with apple filling. That worked also. Instead of the savory ingredients, I melted 3 tbs butter with 1/3 c brown sugar, 1 heaping tsp cinnamon, pinch of cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/2 c chopped apple. Yummy!

Wow, this was SO DELICIOUS! Read all the reviews and gave it a shot (new to bread baking) and absolutely loved it. Great texture, dense and moist but great for soaking up sauce! Made this as a side to scampi and am already thinking about all the ways you could flavor this bread. Would be great with a soup or as part of a gourmet French cheese.... YUM!!!!!

The flavor of this is great - I used about 1/4c onion, 3 squeezed garlic, butter flavored Crisco in place of margarine (all I had on hand)the salt & 1t dried Italian seasoning. I mixed it in the bread machine and the rise was perfect. 2nd rise, not so much. I made 2 loaves and each is only the height of a baguette - I was hoping for height like a regular French loaf. No matter - I WILL be making this again & trying to work out the rising. (I'm at high altitude & have lots of issues making bread here - just learning...)

This recipe is excellent. We loved the bread. The parsley (use fresh) made for an interestng a fresh flavor. It needed about 22 minutes cook time for me. 30 minutes would make it pretty crispy/burned.

This is the first recipe for French bread that has really come out well for me. It's crusty and delicious! I modified the filling a little, though. I used chopped green onions instead of regular onions, I upped the garlic to about a tablespoon, and I added onion and garlic powder as well as Italian seasoning mix. I will definitely be making this again!

I thought this was some of the best french bread I ever had. I didn't think there was to much onion at all but I am a big garlic fan. So, the second time I made it I used 4 cloves of garlic everything else I did exactly the same.

This bread had a nice, light texture and had an artisan look to it.  The bottom crust was really crispy.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I substituted 1 tsp dried parsley and 1 tsp dried oregano which was less green color in my filling, but the flavor was good.  I will probably play around with the filling using mostly fresh oregano which I have a lot of growing in my kitchen with a lesser amount of parsley which I don't think adds much flavor anyway.  The only other change I would make next time would be to put all of the salt in the dough instead of splitting it between the dough and the filling.  I baked this at 375 degrees for 27 minutes.

Loved this recipe! It was my first hand kneaded bread and it was super easy and turned out perfectly! I will definitely make it over and over again. I didn't have any onions on hand that day, so I used dried minced onion and it was just fine.

Wonderful soft bread with excellent flavor, reduced salt in filling by 1/2. I even made it plain with wonderful results. Didn't have any distilled white vinegar so I used plain rice vinegar instead. Turned out great.

This is one of the best bread recipes ever!  I made the dough in my bread machine first, then followed the rest of the recipe.  I turned out perfect.  It was crusty on the outside, and soft and garlicky on the inside.  I served it with spaghetti and meat sauce for dinner which paired perfectly.  My kids asked if I would make this bread with dinner all the time.  Definitely worth the trouble!

Excellent recipe and my new favorite for making french bread.   I have trouble mixing and kneading heavy dough, so I let my bread machine do the work with the dough cycle.  Only other change I made was to use Lemon Juice rather than vinegar to clot the milk since I find the vinegar flavor will sometimes come out in the bread.    Great recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.

I loved this bread, I doubled the recipe and got two GIGANTIC loaves. I added shredded cheese along with mixed dried herbs and garlic(didn't use onion as my kids would have chucked it out)and it came out wonderful. One thing that I need to work on is that all the filling oozed out and burned slightly on the bottom-I am making it again today, we'll see what happens.

This was really good and pretty easy as far as bread making goes.  I made a couple changes, because I like a wheat bread, so I subsituted 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour for all purpose, and I added a couple tablespoons of ground flax seed meal to the dough (added at the beginning with the yeast and sugar, etc). I sprinkled a little more flax seed on the top instead of the parsley, but I did it before I baked the bread.  I also didn't melt the butter; I used a couple tablespoons of room temperature butter that I spread on it and then sprinkled the herb mixture on top of that.
But all in all, it was a really good bread!

Tasty; I used the chopped onions and thyme rather than parsley, and liked the texture of the onions.  I did not like the softened crust from brushing with butter after baking, will skip that step next time.

I will never buy french bread from the store again!!  I used 2 c all-purpose,1 c whole wheat, and 1/2 c bread flour.  I also substituted butter for margarine.  It came out unbelievably soft and stayed that way for three days.  The buttery ribbon adds so much flavor.  I used it to make sandwiches and they were absolutely divine!!

A nice bread recipe.  I used powdered onion instead of fresh and didn't have any problems with the bread unrolling.  Also, I subbed half the flour with whole wheat and used olive oil instead of butter.  Still, a nice bread for company.

Excellent! It's tastey and beautiful to behold. If you want more flavor, add more onions and garlic. I will next time. It rose beautifully for me!

This bread was tasty and will be good with some summer salads. I might try it again with some other modifications, but it really wasn't what I was looking for. This is more like white bread with onion and garlic filling than a french bread.. imho. I'll try this fillling with a sourdough recipe.

Its an alright bread, easy to make, but a little lacking on the flavor.  Although i found it was good to use in French Onion Soup.

All I can say is Yum.  Definitely going to be making this recipe over and over.  I've already directed several friends to this recipe too.  I made it exactly as it said, though I did have to wait a little longer for the yeast to rise.

Easy recipe.  Flavorful bread.  I only use butter never margarine so I used butter in this.  I braided the bread into a round knot. It is gorgeous.  I topped my bread with butter,  parsley and a sprinkle of kosher salt.  
I will make this again and again

This was actually my first time making bread, and this was SUCH an easy recipe to follow  I did add a little garlic bread seasoning to the butter on top, just to add a little razzle-dazzle!

Amazing flavor and easy to make. I will be making this again for sure. I followed the recipe as written and used my Kitchen-aid stand mixer to do the mixing and kneading. I also heated my oven to 170 then turned it off before putting the dough in to rise it. It was about 2 degrees F outside when I made it so I was worried the chill in my house might be too much to rise it quickly. That trick worked wonderfully and I did the same to rise the assembled loaf before baking. A+ recipe for sure. This is great by itself, for a Italian sandwich, or with a savory or pasta dinner.

I was looking for a loaf of French bread for a different recipe and didn't want to buy the premise that the recipe called for. This came out great! Made it almost exactly how the recipes says. I added a little more onions and garlic than it says. What a perfectly light and fluffy inside. If you want the outside to remain crispy, don't add the extra butter spread at the end.

I used onion powder instead of minced onion so we didn't have chunks. This is seriously the best bread ever!!!! Soooo yummy! And the house smelled AMAZING when I baked it, which is so inviting to our dinner guests!

Loved it! I added a bit of basil and it was amazing. I will be making it again and again. My family ate it up in mere hours.
Some time later, I used just the dough to make a couple of dinner braids for dinner and it turned out pretty good.

Tastes amazing! Made this first time bread maker look like a pro! I didn't have all the ingredients to make the herb spread so I used 2 tsps Italian Seasoning Mix, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp dried parsley flakes along with the butter. Turned out great. It will be one of my tried and true recipes!

This bread was fantastic--easy to do, with great texture and flavor. After reading the other reviews, I was worried that the onion flavor would be too strong, but my husband and I didn't think so at all. He's already requesting I make it again.

This is one of my favorite bread recipes.  Perfect compliment to any pasta dish.  For those who think that the onion is too strong, make sure that you mince the onion a small as possible.  I think this helps.  My husband doesn't like onion, and he will eat this bread.  I have made it with less onion and added garlic to it as well.  Very yummy!

Loved it but I need some advice - when I cut the bread, it basically came unraveled in the middle.  Maybe I needed to roll up tighter.

I made it exactly as directed and it turned out wonderfully.  I sometimes have trouble shaping loaves but this looked just right!  Personally I wondered about adding cheese or increasing the filling after reading others' reviews, but I didn't think it was needed as the filling is pleasantly pungent.  Like the next reviewer, I did all by hand and used butter.  Also it was done at 20 mins. [I also made a plain loaf with no filling and it was good too.]

This is great as written, but I've tried it a few times with different spices, added cheese over the filling before rolling up, added garlic to the dough once...you can get very creative with this recipe & it turns out beautiful & yummy every time.

Oddly enough, the bread really didn't rise for me after forming it into a loaf.  It SPREAD, so I ended up with a flat, broad loaf that was very oniony.  Don't know about this one...

THIS WAS THE BEST FRENCH BREAD I'VE EVER HAD!! If I could give this more stars, I would. I used real butter rather than margarine and added a little shredded cheese to the filling. I also added basil and garlic powder to the dough. My kids who don't like onions, couldn't get enough of this bread. I made two loaves and only have 1/2 a loaf left, and my husband hasn't eaten his dinner yet! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

The taste of this bread was superb.  However, the center did not bake up enough.  It was a little doughy in the middle.  If I would have baked it longer, the outside would have been burnt.  Not sure what I could have done wrong to cause that-I double checked and followed all the directions and baking time. :(  Oh, I take that back-I did swap out dried basil for the parsley. (no impact though of course)

Not too sure on this one. Whereas everyone else was raving about it I thought we'd like it. Just found the herb flavor a bit too strong and it over powered the bread taste. Don't think I'll be doing this one again.

Good bread. I had the problem of it unrolling while slicing too.  I skipped the chopped onion and subbed powdered onion in it's place...for the kids' sake.  A little dense, but tasty none the less.  I will take the advise of all the reviewers(thanks for your reviews) and make this bread again....especially using italian seasoning and olive oil.  Thanks for the post Aronna!

Excellence! ~sheer delish!  We made this in our bread machine & before that honking lot of dough got big enough to pour out onto our counter we took it out & divided it, rolled the dough on a floured surface & rolled it up, tucking in the ends.  Covered wit plastic wrap on a large cookie sheet, let rise & then, baked two HUGE loaves & brought to a family Italian dinner & it was inhaled!  Only a wee tad of butter needed, maybe even none!  Soft, chewy, and so aromatic & beautiful.  KEEP THIS IN THE RECIPE BOX!!!

This was so easy to make and so good that I have to bake another loaf today. It is gone already.  The texture was very soft and tender.  The mixture of seasonings just right.  We are going to try it with pepperoni added in nextime.  Just slivers maybe.

Yummy yummy. This was very tasty bread. I made it into two smaller loaves and used oregano instead of parsley. I will make this again.

My family LOVED this bread.  It was so easy to make and is fantastic with or without the onion ribbon!

This bread has a wonderful flavor, and soft texture inside.  We had this bread with Halushki (also from this site) and the flavors of the bread really complimented our main dish.  When I think of French bread, I think of a very hard, crusty loaf--like a baguette.  This bread is nothing like that.  It is very delicious and I will definitely be making this one again and again.  If you use a bread machine to mix the dough, there's very little effort in making this bread turn out wonderfully.  I bake bread 3 or more times each week.  I'm definitely adding this to our list of regulars.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!
