Great Bread! Although this does make a lot and it is rich as other reviewers said, I think it was meant to spread on rather thick. I didn't use so much garlic (I tone it down for hubby) and I used milk instead of half and half. Instead of grilling (which I'm sure would be great but I wasn't going to fire up the grill for it) I toasted the bread and spread the topping, as it said, and then broiled it in the toaster oven until it got slightly brown. Watch it though the topping burns quickly.  Easy and has ingredients I usually have on hand. I will make it again.

This had great flavor, but it needs to be turned occasionally while on the grill to avoid burning.

This is good but itisn't worth the extra fat, calories and cholesterol. Try using olive oil and minced garlic only for great flavor and fewer fat grams.

This was good.  I cut everything in half and it still turned out fine.  I think if I had used what the entire recipe called for we would have all been sick.  This is extremely rich and different.  I would make again as it was inhaled by my teenager!

This recipe was great! I used a large loaf of French bread and thought the amount of filling was just right. I also just baked the bread in the oven rather than putting it on the grill.

One word = YUM!  Ok, two words also...RICH!  Was very easy to 'whip up' and very pleasing to eat! If you don't like garlic...run!  Will make again and again...such a nice compliment to grilled steaks/bbq foods.  :)

This bread is AWESOME!!!!  I make it often.  I put it in the oven when I can't use the grill.  My family really loves it with almost any meal.

This was absolutely fantastic, and very easy.  Reheated very well in the toaster oven later!  Can't wait to turn the grill on again.  :)

This was a really yummy change from regular garlic bread. I used 1 gram fat mayo and low fat cheeses and was happily surprised it turned out well. I served this to a friend who thinks low fat is icky, and she loved this!!

Well, I already had the grill going (this was being served with Grilled Pepper Steak Salad from this site) and I have to say that I'm not a fan of mayo in garlic bread and this recipe just proved it once again even after cutting the amount of mayo in half.  I'm glad I only used half the loaf of bread so I had bread left to go to my old stand by recipe for garlic bread. I think next time I'll just use butter in place of the mayo and definitely add some oregano and leave out the half and half.  When it comes to the amount of garlic - use your own judgement and adjust to your tastes.

You have to reduce the mayo amount.  One cup is way too much.  It was ok...nothing really spectacular.  I think I will tinker with it to find something to suit our tastes.  Thanks anyway.

My sister gave me this recipe years ago.  It's always been a big hit.  My guy friends will not stop asking for it.  I probably won't be invited to another BBQ unless I bring it.  However, it only works out well on the grill.  Too much garlic otherwise (grilled garlic is sweeter) I found that I need more time on the grill than suggested.  Otherwise all the cheeses don't melt together.  Also, seems to have too much cheese mixture.  It usually runs off the bread.  I'll cut it down to 2/3rds of the recipe. (Possibly half) Best way to put fat on your body! Worth it!

Absolutely the best garlic bread. I prepared this for a family barbeque yesterday and everyone loved it!  Made it the day before by toasting the bread in the broiler and then kept in the fridge.  Definitely need to turn frequently to prevent burning of bread. I also used 2 loaves instead of the 1 called for and the amount of spread was perfect.

I have had this recipe for years and it is killer!! This mixture will keep indefinitely in the frig in an air tight container. It is rich and don't put it on thin but don't put it on too thick either. Great with a spinach salad. A complete meal, I made this for our bunko group and they said it was to die for! Try it!!!!

This recipe needs to be tweaked, but I am not sure how.  It had too much of a garlic and mayo flavor.  My husband cooked it a little too long and that didn't help either.  I love garlic, but this was a little too much for my taste buds.  Maybe add less of the 2 ingredients and DON'T over or under cook it.

Made this with dinner last night and it was really tasty..only thing I will do differently next time is cook the bread under the broiler instead of wrapping it in foil and placing on the grill.  The outside of the bread got too crunchy on the grill and the inside stayed too wet so under the broiler should make both crunchy and delicious.

Delicious! However, I would DEFINITELY half the topping. It tastes great but it is WAY TOO MUCH and TOO RICH! I wouldn't change anything else but the quantity. Great easy side for visitors.

To whoever came up with this recipe, THANK YOU!!!!  It is very delicious and I have had several requests for this bread.  I have roasted the garlic instead of mincing it and it tastes just fine.

This is probably one of the best breads of its type on this site and have been making it for several years.  Also have served it in appetizer size and there never seems to be enough.   Highly recommend.  P.S. you can also play around with different cheeses to suit your taste.

This is not so bad, although I did cut way back on the mayo, and if I make it again I think I'll use margarine instead--personal preference.  I didn't have a loaf of french bread, but I did have thin slices of a round loaf I made yesterday, so I used that instead.  I burned a few of the slices while crisping on the grill, so I tossed a couple to the birds.  That hurdle leaped, though, I put the spread on each slice then put the slices of bread together like sandwiches and put in the foil on the top rack of the grill while I grilled ham slices.  Worked pretty well, although I would prefer not to grill these if I did it again.  I usually broil my garlic  bread, and apparently I'm better with the broiler than the grill.   Bf seemed so so on these--they were a bit too crispy for him.  I think they are okay but I don't think the mayo is my thing.  thanks for the recipe!

Based on the rec. of others, I used half the amount of mayo and half the amount of garlic. I also did not have cheddar so omitted it. It was good. I took off the foil and placed them top up in hopes of getting a crusty cheese topping, which worked a little. I think this might be better in the broiler since it would get browned on top.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I made it for my wife's birthday bbq we had and it went almost as fast as my brisket. I sliced the garlic into thin pieces and it turned out great. I am making it again for Thanksgiving.

I cut the recipe down to ¼ batch since only 2 of us were eating.  I had a loaf of Sweet Italian Bread that I put this mixture on.  I did sub milk for the half-and-half and I don’t think it made any difference.  My husband toasted the bread on the grill a little, before I added the cheese/mayo mixture.  The results produced a nice, rich, cheesy bread that went well with ‘Caprese Salad with Grilled Flank Steak’ from AR.  I would make this again, cutting back a little on the mayonnaise.

absolutely fantastic bread!! I end up eating so much of this when I make it that i don't eat the main meal! You can alter this recipe in many ways, JUST DON'T USE MIRACLE WHIP INSTEAD! ICK! I would say the biggest thing I do is broiling it in the oven.

This was not a family favorite.  It didn't taste bad or anything.  It was just not what I was looking for.  With the paprika, the spicy kick seemed a little over powering.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  Took it to a potluck and one person asked me if I had more so she could roll in it.  The second time I made it I toasted the bread under the broiler, spread on the cheese mixture and broiled until lightly browned.  I liked this better!

This is the best garlic bread I have ever had.  I just made it yesterday and I can't get over how good it is.  As for you healthy people as I am one too.  There are many ways to make it better for you. Instead of White bread you can use whole wheat rolls and I did use Skim milk instead of halfnhalf and didn't even notice a difference.  You can also use lite mayo which is half 
the calories and more then half the fat and maybe cut down on the cheese a little.  I actually had this with a nice healthy salad.  So there are ways to make it healthy and it is worth every bite.  DELICIOUS!!!

Yummy recipe, Kimber. I used all low fat ingredients, except for the Parmesan and halved the mayo. Rather than getting the grill fired up, I baked/warmed in the oven, then placed under on the lowest rack under the broiler before serving.

If you don't like mayo do not make this recipe.  I couldn't taste anything but the mayo and didn't like it at all.  Also, I haven't figured out the purpose of melting the cheddar.  As soon as I put it in the mayo mixture it lumped up again.

The spread was delicious but I thought it turned out a little too soggy.  I ended up broiling it to crisp it up.  The leftover spread was very good on a boboli pizza shell topped with roma tomatoes and spinach.

This was OK.  I used 1/2 the mayonnaise, sharp cheddar, and left out the half-n-half altogether.  I guess I just prefer butter instead of mayonnaise.

Really just OK.  I made it exactly how the recipe states, I actually thought it tasted more like a 3 1/2 stars but none of the people I served it to really mentioned it and no one went back for seconds.

The flavor was good, my husband loved the cheese touch.  I like my garlic bread toasty and even though you toast it before hand it wasn't enough to make it crispy. I removed some of the mixture and placed under the broiler but it didn't crisp it up enough for my taste.  I don't think I will make it again.

This was way yummy!  I thought the garlic was a bit over-powering so I will reduce it by a clove or two next time.  Also, I didn't bother to melt the cheddar cheese first, I just mixed everything all together.

Oh my God! This was the best I have ever put in my mouth. I think I could eat it all alone for a meal. I made 2 loaves, and 5 people devoured the entire thing. Of course once they ate this they barely touched their other food.  Thank you so much I will be making this again and often. I would give it more stars if possible.

The first time I made it I did the recipe like it called for, and it was so rich (but tasty) that both my husband and I got sick from it.  I tried it again using 1/2 the amount on a loaf of bread, and it was perfect!!

This was very good! I used thick slices of roasted garlic bread, so I grilled both sides to get them toasted, slathered on the topping (I used less mayo and garlic), and threw them under the broiler until they were all melty and browned. Also, I didn't get the melting the cheese beforehand thing, so I didn't, I just mixed everything up together. The topping had great flavor, but I do agree that 1 cup of mayo would've been too much, and I'm a mayo lover, lol. Loved the grilled flavor of the bread. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love to cook over the camp fire at the family place in the PA mountains.This bread was absolutly killer! I made it to go along with baby back ribs. I used frozen garlic bread to simplify the cooking over the holiday weekend and that worked out well. It is rich but so very worth it! I will be making this again!
