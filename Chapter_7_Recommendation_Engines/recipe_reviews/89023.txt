Tastes delicious!!! I also added V-8 juice & served it on a glass (sundae) cup with a lime wedge for decor! *I did cut back on the marinating; only overnight & I added the V-8 juice prior to refrigerating it; I just chilled it for about 2-3 hours - Absolutely delicious!! It's served as an individual appetizer at my house & it was devoured! I got so many compliments!

I served this dish to my inlaws and it was a huge hit!  I used fresh tilapia and it turned out wonderful; served with tortilla chips. Not only was it delicious and refreshing, but it is also beautiful and full of color! Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good! You may want to drain some (or all) of the lime juice after marinating the fish if you don't want this to be too tart.

My first attempt at Ceviche and boy was it a HIT!  I added cucumber, scallops and a jalepeno and used red snapper for the fish.  I served it in a martini glass with a lime garnish and it looked as good as it tasted.  Made a lot, but that was a good thing!

Yum.  Very lime-y but just enough fish-y.  The local fish market guy recommended grouper since they didn't have orange roughy and it was awesome.  I left out the avocado to avoid the fat, but did add tiny salad shrimp (the kind that come in a bag frozen).  Essentially, this is pico de gallo, so I left that out as well.  Marinated the fish overnight (about 20 hours), then added the rest of the ingredients and let sit for about 3 more hours.  I think it tasted fine and I didn't notice a difference between the 3 hours and the leftovers the next day.  I don't know how this could possibly be 4 servings.  We made this as an appetizer and it fed 6 people, with 4 servings left over.

My husband went fishing on Sunday and brought back a ton of Mahi so that's what I used.  I didn't have green onions, shrimp or celery so I omitted it and it was still great.  I love ceviche and now I have a good recipe to make myself at home.  Thanks!

I decided to try this recipe and my goodness it tasted great the first time up.  I used Tilapia and omitted the celery and Pico de Gallo.  It was outstanding, it tasted just as good as the ones at the restaurants.  New favorite in my house, thanks.

This sounds very similar to the ceviche dish my Educadorian husband's family makes.  Usually they make it often without the seafood and it makes a great accompaniment to the rice in their dinners.

This was very good.  I was nervous about letting the acid (lemon juice) do its job, so I precooked the seafood and ate it after it cooled.  :)

This was beautiful and full of color. I never had Ceviche before and found it to be too tangy for my taste.  My husband, on the other hand, loved it and ate it all up. He finished the leftovers by putting them on top of pasta the next day. I omitted the shrimp and used two fillets of Orange Roughy. Overall, it wasn't bad.

So good! I didn't focus on using 15 limes, but instead on just barely covering the fish. I probably used about 1.5 cups of fresh lime juice. The small tweaks I made (based on what I had in the house) were: 2 tsp dried cilantro in place of the fresh, white onion instead of red, no celery, 1/4 tsp celery seed for the flavor, and no pico since this is already pico with seafood added. 2 tsp of regular salt is about 4 tsp of course kosher salt and I used about 3 tsp of the course instead and was more generous with the pepper. I left out the avocado, and added 1 small jalapeno with about half the seeds taken out - we like it spicy! So tasty. Note: you don't need to marinate for 24 hours before adding the veggies. I marinated the fish (mahi-mahi) for maybe an hour before adding the remaining ingredients and letting them set overnight, stirring a couple times during the day. The fish firmed up perfectly and the flavors were well blended. Thanks for the recipe!

I left out the celery and used bottled lime juice.  I think fresh is definitely the way to go, it was still very good but a little limey.

You can't beat a good ceviche on a hot summer's day! I made this with cod and uncooked shrimp. I followed others' advice and drained the lime juice from the fish before stirring in the other ingredients. I added a little bit of V8 juice to the mix, and also ended up sprinkling a little more cilantro on top. Husband said it needed some hot sauce but, otherwise, we both really enjoyed it. Thanks, Stalin!

This was an easy recipe to put together and tasted great. I used red snapper, since we had some. I also substituted a cucumber for one of the two celery stalks.

This was a great recipe.  I used some Ono that I was trying to find a good recipe for and this was definitely a hit.  I did use canned diced tomatoes, and didn't use the celery(not a celery lover) but it still came out great!

I made this for a Bachelorette Party and for those that tried it, it got great reviews. I thought it was very good and nice to look at too! I followed the recipe almost exactly as stated. Except, living in Alaska, we are blessed to have an abundance of beautiful Halibut fillets. So, I cut that into about 1/2 squares, drained off the extra juice (to reduce any fishey-ness), then covered in FRESH limes as stated. Next time, I would reserve some of the lime zest to add to the tomato-mixture. I also might try adding some clamato. Lots of cilantro and kosher salt adds a nice flavor to this recipe. I was afraid the avocado might not hold up, but, on the contrary it made the juice a nice creamy texture and didn't turn color! Served with tortilla chips and Yummy! Thanks!

Ceviche is officially the new favorite food of the house.  Our hispanic friends made ceviche for us and I thought I would never find a similar recipe.  This was as close as I'll ever get.  I used tilapia and only soaked it in lime juice for 45 minutes and it was great.

Had a party with a few ceviche conissuers and they all said this was the best they have ever had.- I didn't measure the peppers, just added what looked like would be enough for a bit of a bite and it came out perfect- will definately use this recipe again!

Easy and delicious. I could not find pico de gallo where i live but i used a southwest salsa mild regular jar and i think it did the trick. I followed the directions but added one cucumber and used 1/2 lb of Tilapia and skipped the celery just cause i am not fond of it. Everyone loved it and i put it in a big bowl and taco chips around it  so they can serve on a dish and eat it from the taco chips therefore everyone could have some and we even had left overs.
Totally recommend for parties.

This is one of those dishes that is out of this world. Delicious as delicious can get. I like it soupy so I add Clamato juice as a bonus for flavor and serve in margarita glasses. I substitue diced radishes instead of celery, excellen-te!!

Absolutely brilliant - I used fresh sea bass, but swapped the green onions for red (couldn't find green onions anywhere, sadly), and also omitted the celery. I've never had ceviche before, and I was really pleased bu the way it turned out!
