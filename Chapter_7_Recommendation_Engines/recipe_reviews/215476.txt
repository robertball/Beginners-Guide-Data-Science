I made this for hubby to take (and bake) at work. While making it, there seemed to be a ton of cheese on this, but hubby likes cheese so I used it all.  His and his co-workers' comments were that they loved it, and that it was very cheesy but they didn't mind that.  Two men suggested having jarred sliced jalapenos on the side for those wishing to add them.  One man said you could substitute venison for the "hamburger" meat, that's when hubby 'fessed up about the buffalo meat (undetected by all).  He did have to significantly increase the baking time, perhaps because it had been refrigerated prior to baking. The only change I made was decreasing the water by half because I didn't want runny cream cheese, and 1/8 cup water worked very well.  Hubby said that because of all the melted cheese, it was hard to dip a tortilla chip into the dip, so he grabbed a metal teaspoon, placed several tortilla chips on his plate and spooned the dip onto the chips, and other men began doing likewise.  They scraped the pan clean! This was easier to make than the traditional 7-layer taco dip, and serving it heated was nice also.

I made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe, except I used a larger jar of salsa, because I couldn't find an 8oz jar anywhere, then forgot to only use half when I prepared it.  Everyone loved this dip and asked me for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Awesome dip! And the ground bison makes it lower in fat, lower in calories and "healthy." Okay, maybe not, but it tastes great!

This was really good dip! It all got eaten and was complimented many times. I made a few adjustments to accommodate what I had in the pantry: I used ground turkey instead of ground buffalo and used one package of sour cream and some montery jack queso dip in place of the water.
