I doubled this recipe and made it in my slow cooker. Took about 3-4 hours on high, no need to mash the apples, they mushed on their own.. yummy!

I have a 30+ lb bag of apples from our apple tree that NEED to get used up so I took a chance and QUADRUPLED this recipe (praying for good results...otherwise I huge waste of ingrediants). My only change - I used a more apples than called for (6-7 apples X 4).  My prayers have been answered!! My apples and effort have not gone to waste! I now have an economical recipe for applesauce that tastes wonderful and EVERYONE loves! Thanks a million phatcat! I'll be sure to repeat this recipe every fall!!

Excellent recipe!!! I think the type of apple you use will determine how much sugar you need. I doubled the apples and per the recommendation of the local produce manager, I used 3 empire and 5 macintosh. Since these are naturally sweeter than pie apples, I cut the sugar in half, using 1/4 cup for the doubled recipe. I also cut the cinnamon, since I only like a hint of it. Since a few reviewers talked about it being watery, I let it simmer for about 45 minutes. Once it seemed thick enough for my liking, I used the potato masher to make it smooth. Very easy and tasty recipe. You will have to adjust the sugar according to the apples and your personal preference. With the apples I used and cutting the sugar, we took a vote. Two thought the sweetness was just right and three thought it was a little sweet. However, everyone enjoyed it.

Very good.  I scaled-up the recipes and usd 10 apples, 3/4 c sugar ut only 1 c water since I cooked it in my slow cooker on high for four hours.  Delicious.  I added some extra cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg for fun.

I have my grandbaby visiting this weekend from Minneapolis and wanted to make him some homemade applesauce. (I didn't even do that for my OWN kids!)  So I chose this recipe, but only as a reference.  Because it was for an infant not quite six months old I knew I would add no sugar or cinnamon.  But I'll tell you, even if I wanted to, there'd be no way I'd add this much sugar (a tablespoon per apple?) no matter what size the apples were. Also, knowing apples give off a lot of liquid, 3/4 cup of water seemed a lot.  I cut that back to 1/2 cup, and could have used even less - I think 1/4 cup would have been fine.   But that's 2/3 less than the recipe calls for!  I chunked rather than chopped the apples, so I could do a good fork test on a chunk of apple to make sure it was cooked until tender. Again, because this was intended for a baby, I ran it through the food processor (blender would have worked fine too) rather than mashing it. So two stars as written because of the overload of both sugar and water, even tho' it ended up pure and delicious.  I can't wait to see how little Andrew likes it!

Awesome!! My first time making applesauce and it was delicious.  I used cortland apples, and instead of sugar I added 4 packets of splenda and a little extra cinnamon. I will definitely be making this again!!

This is one of the first things I've tried to cook, and I don't think it came out how it was supposed to, but I think the next time I make it, it will be even more wonderful!! I used 4 small gala apples and 1 medium granny smith, added a little bit more water, and kept the peels on for added nutritional benefit. Next time I will peel them and chop up the peels into much smaller bits and add 'em in...I'll also probably cook it a few minutes longer, I think I probably let it sit on the stove for about 21-22 minutes, stirring occasionally but a few more minutes would of probably been better. I also didn't use an exact measurement on the 1/2 t of cinn. (Just kinda eye-balled it with a 1 t) and it was the perfect amount. I will probably use a tad less sugar too. 
Anyway... all my non-skills at cooking aside, this tastes SOOOOO good!!!! Thanks phatcat for making one of my first cooking experiences a positive one!

I make this exact recipe every autumn, and it never fails to impress people.  It's so easy, and homemade applesauce is FAR better than the storebought!

Sooo easy and delicious.  I used Jonagold apples and omitted the sugar but it still tasted sweet.  I tripled the recipe and canned the applesauce - don't let the applesauce cool, mash it while hot and pour into hot, sterilized jars, then 15 minutes in hot water bath for pint-sized jars or 20 minutes for larger jars.  It took approx. 2 and 1/2 large apples to fill 1 pint-sized jar. I plan to make more and give them to the neighbors!

Very delicious! My thirteen year old daughter is my applesauce "expert" and taste tester. She loves cinnamon so we added quite a bit more. This applesauce is wonderful served warm with a nice pot roast dinner.

I made this but used brown sugar instead. Bring the water and brown sugar to a boil to dissolve the brown sugar before you add the apples. I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and vanilla. For the adults, try an ounce of your favorite liquor, I like amaretto or frangelico.

I like to use Granny Smith apples in this recipe along with brown sugar and a full teaspoon of apple pie spice. This recipe doubles and triples well. Excellent way to use banged up/discounted apples and this makes a great fill-in for oil/eggs to lighten up your baking.

AMAZING!  I've never had homemade applesauce, and I won't be going back to the store bought.  I made a triple batch and used 12 apples - 6 fuji, 3 granny smith, and 3 brayburn.  I used the apples, 1/2 cup water and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  No sugar.  I cooked them in the crockpot for 4 hours on high.  A slight mash with a potato masher and they were perfect.  A word of warning: don't try this warm! I had my first taste when the applesauce was still warm and it was kinda nasty.  I was really disappointed until I tried the cold applesauce the next day.  HUGE difference!  I'm on my third triple batch in three weeks, and I'm going to make two more batches this weekend and freeze it all.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and brought it on a ladies' weekend trip; they raved about it.  I made this recipe using 1/2 macintosh apples(sweet) and 1/2 granny smith apples(sour).  I only put in 3/4 of the amount of sugar requested in the recipe (this was just the right amount). The cinnamon makes the applesauce look a little darker than in the photo, so put in a smaller amount or sprinkle on top like the photo shows. I used my apple-peeler-corer and I did not have to mash.

I use this recipe regularly- really easy recipe for a potluck, brunch, or just to have as a snack. I ALWAYS make this in my smaller crock pot, 5 apples always fills it up to the very top, but since they cook down quite a bit, there's plenty of room by the end of 3-4 hours.   A word from the wise, all apples are not created equally! Some apple varieties will NOT mash very well. Gala works well, Fuji does not (if memory serves). You do not need to add sugar to this recipe, which makes it great for diabetics. If you stir gently halfway through cooking but leave the apples mostly intact, it is a great ice cream topping.

This is sooooo good.  Made 2.5 times the original amount, and I just ate way too much in one sitting.
It's such a pain to peel all those apples, and I feel like you lose a lot of good apple, so I just cored them, cut them in quarters, and cooked them that way.  Once it cooled, I used my hands to squeeze the peels away from the apples.  That worked pretty well.

This is almost the same recipe used at my school. Instead, try adding 1/8 cup brown sugar and 1/8 cup white. Gives it an extra delicious flavor!

this was so easy and SO YUMMY! 
I went the crockpot route and it took about 3 hours on high. Very easy. I used about 7 apples (just what I had on hand and needed to get rid of ... 5 RED DELICIOUS & 2 GRANNY SMITH. I took the advice of using 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of the white and I added a pinch of ground cloves as well as a tiny bit of vanilla extract. It's not going to last long around here!

LOVE it! Left some of the peels on the apple and added some frozen cranberries towards the end to make it more "rustic." (add at end so some still have a little 'pop') Huge hit at a baby shower brunch...making again right now!! --Cortland apples worked great--Fab recipe; so quick and easy!
**Update on this, used Haralson Apples. They didn't mush so well (see photo) but they were fab!!!

Oh yum.  If you have the time, do it.  This freezes really well, too.  I leaved the peels on my apples and it gave it a nice pink color.  Very pretty.

I make this every fall too.  A trick my mom always did...when the apples are done cooking, throw several old fashion red hots in and let them melt, stir.  Gives a pretty color and a little more taste.

This applesauce was really tasty and different at the same time. Usually when I make applesauce I have this really nice, thickened sauce made when the sugars and water combine. I found that with this recipie though, the water slightly thickened. Don't get me wrong, as I did enjoy it! There are a lot of ways to make the same thing and change isn't a bad thing! This applesauce was all in all, easy, simple, and quite delicious. 
Tip: I added 1/2 a tablespoon of maple syrup (being a true Canadian) and it was da Bomb!

I scaled up this recipe and found that there was way too much moisture.  I ended up taking the apples out of the water and mashing them separately, adding back in a spoonful of the apple water, as needed, to get the consistency I wanted.  I also felt this was a tad on the sweet side, but still really good and likely something kids will enjoy a lot with the sweetness.

I made this in the slow cooker and then used an immersion blender to make a smooth sauce.  To keep as it as healthful as possible, I did not peel the apples.  This is a great homemade baby food recipe and keeps well frozen!

This is by far the best applesauce that I have ever made! This will be the only way I make it from now on. 3/4 cups of water sounded a lot and the ratio of apples to water seemed off, as well, but I decided to follow the recipe, anyway. After mashing it all together after it cooled, the consistancy was perfect! Just the way we like it. I will continue making applesauce this way. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Phatcat!!

I made this using some leftover chopped apples that I had after making apple dumplings. My 4 year old son loved it. The only thing I did different is decrease the recipe(since I was using leftover apples), used white grape juice instead of water, and I used splenda baking blend instead of sugar.

This is DELICIOUS applesauce! It is tasty, with just the right amount of cinnamon. I made the following alterations: 1) I only used a pinch or two of sugar, and am glad I did because he natural sugars of the apples made it just sweet enough. 2) I didn't use as much water as the recipe calls for. I'm glad I did because it was hard enough to drain as it was (I used half the water it calls for). I would've given it 5 stars, except for the water problem.

Weeee!  I needed applesauce for another recipe.  Had lots of apples that were on the verge of going bad, so I thought...hmmm...bad apples...need applesauce...voila!  This was super easy.  I put everything into the crockpot and set it on high for about 3 hours.  All I had to do after that was stir it a little bit to break up the chunks to make it a sauce, then I let it continue to cook in the crockpot for another hour with the lid half off to cook off some of the extra water.  Thanks!

I've been making this applesauce for many years.  It IS delicious AND easy.  I add the 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon.  Then I add about 1/4 cup of cinnamon candies....it adds a pink tint and a little more cinnamon touch.

Goodbye Motts!  Wow, thank you so much for this recipe.  I will never again buy applesauce in the jar.  Not only is this far more flavorful, it's incredibly economical, too.  I made one batch last weekend - half was eaten, and the other half was used to make Applesauce Bread (also found on this website), and am already about to make my second!

I found this recipe to have too much water, and not even close to enough cinnamon.  I had to cook the water out forever, and that killed the texture I was hoping to get from homemade sauce.  I was surprised it turned out like this, given the glowing reviews... until I realized how many glowing reviews had actually change the recipe entirely and were rating their own applesauce recipe instead.  Frustrating and disappointing.

I made this for my 16 month old grandson but left the sugar out at my daughter's suggestion (she's a vegan and VERY healthy eater).  He loves it and now I have to make more and take to him about every 2 weeks.

This is one of the first things I learned to cook by myself as a child (Mom cut the apples). We left the peels on during the cooking process, this would give the applesauce a pretty red color, then into a cone shaped strainer to get rid of the skins.

Very good and easy! Made this in the crockpot with about 6 different kinds of apples (I more than doubled the recipe) and it didn't last long in my house! The key is to use different types of apples for better depth of flavor. Much much better than store bought.

We would give this more stars if possible.  My son & husband love applesauce but they really LOVE this version!!!  We try not to use sweeteners so left out the sugar all together - just apples, water & cinnamon.  Took advice of another reviewer and dumped everything in crockpot and cooked for 2-3 hours.  AMAZING!!  They loved it hot, they loved it chilled.  They even loved it when I thawed some frozen raspberries, mushed them and added into the applesauce.  Next time I'll try tossing in a bag of frozen raspberries, blueberries or peaches in the crockpot as well for a flavored variety.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

This is the perfect recipe to use up a bunch of apples before they go bad.  It's delicious.  I used half the sugar and it was plenty.  Especially good after its cooled in the refrigerator overnight.

I don't like apple sauce from the store and decided to give this recipe a try. Boy, am I glad I did! This was so good! I wish I would have doubled the recipe. I cooked this in the crock pot since I had to run errands. It turned out fab!

this recipe is so easy and it really is delicious. I had kids that don't usually eat applesauce wanting more. I will be using this anytime I have extra apples I want to use!

This was good.  I did add a small handful of brown sugar which actually made it too sweet.  Next time I'll do 1/8C of brown sugar and 1/8C of white sugar.  I also added a small amount of cornstarch dissolved in a small amount of water to make the watery-ness thicker.  It turned out terrific!

Sickeningly sweet and way too much water.  Notice that many of the "five star" review double or more the amount of apples.

This recipe is qick and simple. I simmered my apples in the water, sugar, cinnamon, and I added some of my homemade vanilla (yum!!) for about 1 1/2 hours. My kids loved this, thanks!

I know everyone else loved this, but it was WAY too much water for me. After cooking for 15 minutes, it still looked like apple soup. I had to drain off a lot of the water, which meant that I lost a lot of the spices too, so I had to add more of everything. Maybe it would work better if you cook the apples and water without the spices, then drain the water, then add spices.

I thought this was a great, basic recipe. Next time I plan to buy some vanilla frozen yogurt, coat it with granola, and then top it with this apple sauce. Excellent!

This is the simplest of recipes and extremely delicious!  We used Spartan apples, and added the sugar and cinnamon after cooking so as not to overdo it.  We puréed the apples in the food processor and the applesauce turned out very well.  Yummy!

SUPER easy and SUPER tasty.  Like another reviewer, instead of sugar, I used the equivalent of sweetener.  I also added a little more cinnamon because I really like cinnamon.

My Fiance isn't much of an applesauce guy.  But, he ate a serving and commented that it was good.  He still probably won't eat much applesauce, but it's a huge step in that he ate more than a little spoonful!  

This is a keeper for sure - so easy to do, you could do it every day.  AND, it makes your house smell amazing - like Christmas!

So much better than store bought! The taste is fresher and with more flavor. I didn't add any sugar, which my family liked a lot. I've made it a couple times, using red delicious, golden delicious, fuji, gala, braeburn, and Jonagold apples. All of them are sweet enough to not add sugar except maybe the Jonagold, which were a little tart.

I needed applesauce for my zucchini bread but did not have any. I decided to try making from scratch. This recipe worked out great, however I didn't use any sugar at all just 3/4 cup apple juice in place of water and a squeeze of lemon juice to keep apples from turning brown. Thanks

I have made applesauce in the past many times and find this recipe is basically the same. The only difference is,  I used red cinnamon candies to give it a beautiful red coloring plus it adds only a little flavor.  You still need cinnamon. Great recipe - 5 stars from me!! My Mother-In Law taught me how to.

Great recipe! So easy too! I made it for 2 (mine was 198 calories for a nice sized serving) instead of 4....used braeburn apples and added extra cinnamon, half white and half brown sugar plus a pinch of cloves, a splash of vanilla extract and a shot of brandy...turned out amazing. Total keeper.

O.M.G.! ... this is so easy to make and so good!! I know I will never buy another jar of applesauce again when it is this easy to make your own and that it tastes 100% better than anything you can buy. I used brown sugar. Tastes like the inside of an apple pie.  I'm sure with all the different kind of apples the combinations and taste variations are endless. Thanks Phatcat!!

Really super recipe! I tried it with 6 apples and only an inch of water in the bottom of the saucepan. Sweetened with very little brown sugar instead of white; another time tried honey (also good). For another version, try adding a little crushed pineapple to it, and/or golden raisins.

"There's a party in my tummy-so yummy, so yummy":) This is sooo good! It turned out wonderful! We pounced on it while it was still warm, and added a scoop of whip cream...made it taste like apple pie! Next time I'll add crumbled pie crust! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Yummy!  But I was the only one who partook of it!  Although, probably because it was Halloween night and the kids were way more interested in their candy ;)  It tasted lovely, like apple pie, and next time I will try it with vanilla ice cream!

Good and easy recipe. I used red delicious and will try different types of apples next time. I thought the sweetness was perfect. Good replacement for dessert.

So Easy & So Tasty!!  This was my first time making applesauce.  I used about 4 & 1/2 Red Delicious Apples, 3/4 C. Water, 3 & 1/2 Tbsp. Sugar, and Eyeballed The Cinnamon. Very Good!!

This is a GREAT recipe. We have 24 apple trees in the back yard and the Early June ones are ready now. I used brown sugar instead of white and added the recommended amount of cinnamon and a touch of apple pie spice. Yummmm....We'll make this again !.

I like to add a touch of vanilla to my applesauce towards the end of cooking time.  It makes it extra special.

I use this recipe when I bake my quickbreads (where I use a 1:1 ratio of oil and applesauce). I substitute Splenda (or generic) for the sugar. Sometimes I'll add an additional fruit (pears and plums are particular favorites). I don't add the cinnamon because some recipes just don't call for it (when a recipes does, I simply add it to the dry ingredients). I puree the resulting product in my blender. My breads come out moist, light and very flavorful. My family loves them and they make great gifts.

Really good, really simple.  I used honey crisp apples so I cut down the sugar a little and I cooked in the crock pot so I didn't have to touch it.  I tried it on low at first but after 4 hours, it was still crunchy so I cranked it up to high for another 2 hours.  I probably shouldn't have gone so long but I had to leave the house so I wasn't watching it.  Next time, I think 3 - 4 hours on high or 6 hours on low.  Also, since I did in the crock pot, I didn't need as much water.  I think I used about half a cup and still had too much.

Absolutely outstanding flavor and very, very easy to make.  My wife loved it and we finished it all within 48 hours!!  Excellent recipe and a great argument for never buying jarred apple sauce again.  Best of all, you can play with the sugar content as your apples vary in sweetness.  This one is a winner!!

I like my applesauce chunky, so I always make it at home, using a variety of apples like this - definitely with a MacIntosh unless they look bad in the store. I rarely add water - maybe a tablespoon - and never sugar. If the apples seem to need sugar for flavor, I use a little lemon juice. I also microwave rather than cooking on the stove - no scorching, although you have to watch so they don't overflow. My family likes a whole cinnamon stick cooked with it, not just ground cinnamon. Main complaint with this recipe is the unnecessary amount of sugar.

Love this recipe!  I make it at least 3x a month.  After a few times, I tried substituting half the white sugar for brown, and adding a few drops of vanilla... and it's great!  It really makes the flavors POP.

Delicious! Made a very easy & healthy dessert for the whole family.   I have a major sweet tooth & this more than satisfied me.  Instead of mashing dumped the pot into my cuisinart & pulsed a few times. Used 5 granny smith apples & went heavy on the cinnamon. Thx for sharing!

Made this last weekend according to the recipe, to go with some pork chops and potato pancakes. Loved it, and I'm making it again right now!

I'm using Cortland apples. This time, I doubled the recipe and I also added a half bag of frozen cranberries that I had in the freezer. I started by bringing the cranberries to a boil with the water and sugar, then blended the berries a bit with a stick blender. I chopped all but two of the apples (and kept them in strainer in a bowl of cold water until I was ready to add them because they take me forever to chop and I don't want them browning). I let those cook a bit while I chopped the other two apples, then blended what was in the pot with the stick blender before adding the remaining apples so it'll be just a little bit chunky. 

Just tasted some and it's delicious! Looking forward to eating this all week, and I can't wait to do something creative with the next batch.

This is the second time i've used this recipe, but for some reason, it was better last time. it's very watery this time, but it's still delicious. You save a ton of time if you use a kitchen aid soup blender. if you use one like I did, make sure the apples have cooled completely, because it splatters a little.

This is a great recipe for easy homemade applesauce.  I don't bother to peel the apples- the peel adds color and fiber to the end product.  Also you don't need to add sugar at all.  When I make it I just use apples, cinnamon and water and it tastes almost like apple pie filling.

Fantastic recipe. I found this while looking for something to make in order to use up some of the 10lbs of apples my children picked a couple of months ago. My children absolutely loved it! Since then my children refuse to eat store bought applesauce. They will only have this one.

This recipe makes excellent applesauce, and it's so easy!  I just made two batches with a total of 36 (yes, that's THIRTY-SIX!) apples, split down the middle between Gala and Honey Crisp.  I did use brown sugar, as other people suggested, and not quite as much.  This is going to my kids' preschool tomorrow for snack.  I can tell there won't be leftovers.  Thanks!

Took the advice of another reviewer and used only 2 TBS of sugar since I used fairly sweet apples. Also, since the apples I used were a bit small, I used five apples instead of four. Turned out beautifully!

This is a great applesauce. I like to mix white sugar and brown sugar with it. I also add some lemon juice for some tart.

Smells really good while it's cooking but I'm now at 25 mins and the apples still aren't soft enough to mash. Even got the electric hand mixer out and it just spits the apple chunks around in the bowl.

Wow! I never knew making apple sauce could be so easy. I now make this often, but I substitute splenda for sugar. I also sometimes use this recipe for dessert toppings (without mashing the apples). Thanks!

This is a great, great recipe!  I didn't see this in any of the other reviews (maybe I didn't read back far enough) but it took me a while to peel, core, and chop the apples (will be investing in a better peeler, and a corer), so I used the juice of half a lime in the pan as well.  I nixed the regular sugar and used 6 packets splenda (equal to 1/4 cup sugar) and 5 gala apples.  It came out GREAT!  A little too much water, but I drained a little off before I started mashing.

I'm glad to be the 1,000th person to write a review for this DELICIOUS applesauce!

I don't like my applesauce too sweet (I buy "natural" in the store), so I put in a little less than 1/4. 

Highly recommend this recipe! Came out great with Gala apples.

Super easy!  I upped the cinnamon quite a bit (dumped it in, we love cinnamon) and cut the sugar probably in half but using honey instead.  It was perfect.  I imagine 1/4 cup of sugar makes for a super sweet applesauce so beware!  But otherwise, great recipe.

Basic applesauce recipe.  Personally, I'd leave the sugar out.  I much prefer unsweetened applesauce.  The apples themselves are sweet enough.

This is pretty good, next time I will cut the sugar back a little. Not that it was to sweet, just its a lot of unneeded sugar. Also, probably cut the cinnamon in half. I doubled the recipe and it did not make very much. So I would deffintaly start with atleast doubling it!

I used honeycrisp apples, which are sweet enough so I eliminated the sugar (also because I am using it as baby applesauce for my 6 month old) It was easy to make, not too liquidy or too thick,  tastes really fresh. I will be making applesauce like this from now on instead of buying it!!

Now that we've realized how easy it is to make, and SOO MUCH better tasting I'll never buy store bought again. Next time I think I'll substitute a  little of the white sugar for brown.  Fantastic recipe!

After reading all of the rave reviews I certainly want to try this recipe.  The recipe calls for 4 apples.  Since apples come in various sizes how many cups of chopped apples would I use?

As a child, my mother made the best applesauce.  I remember her squeezing the cooked apples through a colander.  It was so much work and a big mess.  This recipe is the BEST!!!  So easy and extremely tasty!  I used Granny Smith apples, apple pie spice in place of cinnamon, and cooked 30 minutes to let the water reduce more (after it started boiling, I reduced heat slightly and uncovered). Kept the apples in the pan and used a hand blender. One pot cooking!

This was the First time I made apple sauce, and it was a blast. It was is so Easy! I made 6 servings instead of 4 and it came out perfectly! The ratios of sugar and cinnamon tasted amazing! After the apples were soft and cooked (20 minutes) It looked really liquidy and not right. Don't worry! Just let it cool, for 5-10 minutes, mash together and comes out amazing! Super quickly and easy!! Definitely will make this recipe again- no more jarred applesauce!

This was great! It didn't need anything added, but I put a pinch of pumpkin spice. Instead of mashing it up I put it in the blender. It turned out awesome and smooth.

This recipe was WAY too sweet.  It tasted more like a pie filling than applesauce.  It had a nice "home-made" consistency, but I'd halve or even quarter the sugar if I made this again.

I love this recipe. It is easy, fast and can be done on the stovetop. Cant get better than that for me. And I love the fact that I can double or triple the recipe and doesnt have to change any measurements. It comes out perfect. This year I had way too many apples from our apple picking adventure, so I made six jars of this applesauce and canned it. I used all kinds of apples, even mixed a few varities for one batch. It still came out good. So far we ate two jars and it seems to can well. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This was my first time making applesauce and I was pleased with how simple the process is! I can't believe I am going to say this, but it was too sweet and I would recommend cutting back the sugar unless you like it super sweet. I would make this again with a sugar adjustment. I used an immersion blender to blend the apples once removed from the stove.

Really good! I didnt think the water would be enough but it was. I would add a little bit more sugar but not too much more. I will make again.

I didn't think it needed that much sugar, so I cut it in half and I think I'll put even less next time. It also depends on what kind of apples you use too. I used Gala apples.

This was soooo good.  I used golden delicious apples and followed the directions exactly with the addition of about 6-8 strawberries.  Everyone loved my strawberry applesauce.

I have to pour off some of the liquid each time I make this, but it's still delicious!  I use Fuji apples, turbinado sugar, and add a pinch of ground cloves, which really puts it over the top!

Too sweet.  So easy. Even doubling the recipe does not make much. Fun and easy. Defiantly a do! 

Half the sugar.

Yum! This is fantastic and fresh! I used two Fuji apples and two golden delicious apples. I doubled the cinnamon and blended it in a food processor until smooth (husband's request).

this is fast, easy, and amazing. the only thing i did different is i used cinnamon sticks. instead of mixing it all together i brought the water to a low simmer with the cinnamon sticks in order to let the flavors release into the water.

Maybe it was the choice of apples (Granny) but I followed this recipe exactly and it just came out a little too tart. Had to adjust the amount of sugar and felt like I was pouring in the whole bag.

I made this with four honey crisp apples and it was definitely the best applesauce I have ever had. We used it to top latkes(potato pancakes) and it was a smash hit!

Great stuff.  Kind of hard to review since it really depends on the apples you use but I prefer this recipe for the tart apples.  I lower the sugar for the sweeter apples.  Great for Granny smith, jonagolds or crispins.

I did the crock pot version as suggested by another. 5 hours on high and it was perfect. It did need to be mashed. Also I added about 3x the cinnamon cause my family likes it. I think this was amazing and forget buying applesauce anymore!

I'm still shocked at how wonderful this tastes. I took another reviewers advice, I used 10 apples, doubled the recipe, and put them in the slow cooker for about 3 to 4 hours. I also used half brown sugar and half white.

Great starting point for homemade applesauce. Remember to taste your apples before starting and adjust accordingly, sweeter apples need less sugar and you can always add sugar while cooking if needed. I have used apple juice in place of water a few times but as the juice is sweet I cut back on the sugar when doing so. Play with the spices depending on what you like, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger (fresh works best but you can add ground ginger), cloves etc. For a special treat for kids you can dissolve red hots (the candy) in the water and add in your apples. This turns them a red/pink color and gives a cinnamon flavor for a fun treat. Like I said this recipe is a great starting point!

Terrific!  I used granny smiths and love the tartness. Ended up not really mashing - mashed itself and the chunks that didn't made a little bit of contrast. Definitely will make again.

This applesauce is delicious and sooooo easy to make. I had a ton of apples left over from apple picking, so I thought it would be a good idea to try and use them up. I made a double batch hoping it would not go to waste, and I'm glad I did. I haven't stopped eating it :)

Good and simple recipe.  I did mine in the crock pot.  I used a mix of cortland, Rome, Jonamac, empire and jonathan apples bc I think the more variety you have the better the flavor.  I DOUBLED the recipe but didn't add quite the full doubled amt of sugar bc I like the flavor of the apples to stand out in front of the sweetness.  I slow cooked them for 1 hr on low but that didn't seem right so I kicked it up to high for an hour and that did the trick.  I then took the lid off hit the apples with a potato masher and let it cook for another hour uncovered so it wouldn't be quite so watery.  Came out great!  Not too sweet with a tasty hint of cinnamon.  Will def make again but I think I will just cook it 2-2.5 hours on high with the lid off the 2nd hour, the first hour on low was prob unnecessary.

This is very similar to my recipe. The only difference is i don't really weighs the ingredients. I just dump in whatever i have like apples with pears or peaches or whatever i have in hand & instead of putting in white sugar, i put in brown sugar or honey. You can also replace cinnamon with vanilla bean. Delicious!

Amazing! I use a varying amount of splenda depending on the sweetness of the apples. I also make it in the crockpot and usually serve it with pork chops.  Yum!

IMO applesauce-ing is the one thing the microwave does better than any other method. I peel, core and nuke my apples until they get as soft as I like. I use a potato masher and add in a pat of butter, sugar or sweetener, cinnamon and a little nutmeg.

Perfection!   This smelled so good while cooking, and was even better when it was done.  You don't need to change a thing.  This is my go to applesauce recipe from now on.  Thanks Phatcat!

Leave it to me to burn the apples on the stove! They never got soft and i had to put them through my chopper to get it even a little like applesauce. I will try this again but in the crock pot like another reviewer did.

Fantastic!! After 20 minutes on the stove, I 'mashed' my apples to the consistency of my liking, but it was still a bit too watery. I then put it back on the stove for about another 20 minutes until I reached a thicker consistency. It is fantastic!!!

Loved this - very tasty, and so easy I'll be thinking twice before buying canned applesauce. Wondering if anyone has tried it without the sugar? Or with sweetner?

perfect applesauce.  cooked for 5 hours on high in my slower cooker, leaving the lid off a crack in the last hour for it to reduce a bit.  mashed it up using a potato masher.

used a mix of honeycrisp and fuji apples.  also I used organic raw sugar.

I give Sarah's applesauce a 10! My husband loved it and it certainly  curbed my sweet tooth. I made this twice and will continue to make it, its low  fat and no cholesteral. This is really going help me stay on my diet.

Easy and delicious.  I made this in a crock pot.  I doubled the apples and used the same measurement of cinnamon but 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup water.  Cooked on low about 4 hours mashing the apples a couple times during cooking.  We enjoyed them warm.

I had some apples that were  beyond eating out of the hand stage and I hated the idea of throwing them out...they have been in the fridge so long I don't even remember what kind they are.  Also, I was craving chunky applesauce and this hit the spot!  Unbelievably easy to make - I had no idea!  This is so much better than jarred.  I left out the sugar because the apples were on the sweet side already and I'm glad I did.  It was the perfect sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the perfect consistency and sweetness. I used four Honey Crisp apples, and it turned out delicious. I also mashed them with a potato masher while still hot; I don't think it mattered.  I may try Splenda next time, but I'm sure it won't taste as good.

This was my first attempt at home made applesauce and YUM! I'll never want to switch back to the store stuff now! We had some apples left from when we went apple picking, Red Rome to be exact. I originally put them on for 20 minutes but after reading some of the other recipes I extended that another 13 minutes or so and it turned out perfect!

I helped my 9 year old daughter make this yesterday with a bunch of winesap apples we were given.  She did everything except chop the apples and she was so excited to say that it turned out "awesome" and "the best I've ever had".  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe.

Our neighbor gave us a bunch of apples off his tree and I didn't want to make a pie with them. I tried this recipe and doubled it. I only put 1/2 the amount of sugar since the apples were already pretty sweet all by themselves. It was a bit runny after the apples cooked so I added a couple of teaspoons of tapioca before I mashed it and it thickened up. Next time, I'm adding less water. My family loved it and it's a great way to make the house smell good.

I used twice as many apples with the specified amounts of water, sugar and cinnamon. I would imagine you would end up with a very runny, sickeningly sweet applesauce if you followed the recipe as stated. With that said, the amounts of water and sugar will be largely dependent on the type of apples used. I used a mix of who know's what. We went to the local orchard and my kids mixed various kinds together. My advice: start with reduced amounts of liquid and sugar and adjust as you go.

Very good applesauce recipe - I added more cinnamon because my family loves cinnamon, otherwise I followed directions to a tee and served with cinnamon graham crackers!  Delicious thanks for the recipe!

With an important adjustment, this is an incredible recipe! I suspected too much cooking liquid before mashing, so I strained the liquid first and added it while mashing to reach the desired consistency. There was a lot of liquid leftover, so if all were used it would have been a very thin sauce. The recipe came out incredible!

Very good. Make a big batch in your slow-cooker (takes 4 hrs on high as someone else said), you'll regret it if you don't. I used a combination of apples to get sweet and sour flavors. Serve with a sprinkle of wheat germ for a special touch!

simple stuff is somtimes best!!  My daughter prefers "pink" applesauce (with berries added) and I could not find a pink applesauce recipe here so I just modified this one: I subsituted 1/4c of strawberry jam for the 1/4 c of sugar and it was a big hit. (I also cut the cinnamon back to 1/4 tsp with the berries in it).

Very good.  Was not nearly as sweet as a lot of people said.  Make sure you pay attention to apples used.  The sweeter the apple the less sugar you are going to need.   Will definitely make again.

This recipe is wonderful. My peeler was broken and I got a little lazy and didn't peel the apples. However, it still came out excellent. I already had all the ingrediants at home, so I even saved a trip the the grocery store! Next time, I'll actually peel the apples!

Oh my goodness, this was sooo easy and sooo yummy.  I used 5 small Gala Apples, boiled them for 20 min, put 1 cup of it in the recipe from this site called Applesauce Bars.  The only thing that I can say is amazing; not only by itself, but also when used in a recipe.

I just want to repeat the raves of many others. I tried this because I needed to use up a few apples. I've never even considered making my own applesauce but will never purchase it again since it can taste this good and be so easy!  I used 4 packets of Splenda instead of sugar, and it was great, almost like a dessert rather than a healthy food!

After tasting this, why anyone would buy store bought applesauce is beyond me!  Didn't wait for the apples to cool before I mashed them.  That way, I could have a small bowl while the applesauce was still warm!  Otherwise, I followed the directions as displayed.  Next time, I think I might add a little brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer.

I really loved this!  I never would have thought of making my own applesauce.  I substituted apple pie spice for the cinnamon and used twice as much.  I also added a touch of brown sugar towards the end.  (Almost as an afterthought.)  This was wonderful!

The amount of sugar and water needed will vary quite a bit depending on the types of apples that you use. I used a mix of Fuji and Gala apples (just using up what was in my fridge) and although I used five apples, a quarter cup of sugar was way too much. I also had quite a bit of liquid in with the apples when I was done cooking it. I also wasn't clear on how to time the cooking time. I started the timer once the liquid in with the apples was bubbling, and then let it simmer for 20 minutes. The apples were soft afterward, but a potato masher wasn't working at all. Dumped it all in a blender, pulsed a couple of times, and got a consistency I'm happy with.

This recipe is a good starting point for someone who wants to make applesauce but doesn't know how, but it should have suggested starting out with a smaller amount of sugar and then increasing to taste.

This was my first time making applesauce and it was delicious! I doubled the recipe (I had 9 Gala apples starting to soften so I used all of them); however, I only used 1/4 cup white sugar and about 1 tablespoon brown sugar. In addition, I used 1 teaspoon of Epicure's Apple Pie spice - just to add that little extra flavour. I cooked it for about 30-40 minutes (until it reached the desired consistency, and I occasionally stirred the apples as it was cooking). I was never a fan of store bought applesauce but I will definitely be making this again!

I made this in my crock pot and it turned out amazing! I had five apples that were going bad so I decided to test this recipe. I peeled and cut the apples and tossed them in the water in the slow cooker. I added the sugar and cinnamon on top of the apples. I set my slow cooker on low for 4 hours and when I came home from work I mashed the apples with a fork and turned the cooker on high. I continued to mash periodically for a couple more hours and once it was the thickness I liked I unplugged the cooker and let it sit for about an hour before canning. I didn't adjust the sugar or spice amount to account for the extra apple and it still turned out perfect. I filled one 12oz jar and had some left over (which I ate as soon as it was chilled). My friends loved it!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe! I have used it both with apples and with pears since the taste is so similar! I used 10 pears(very, very ripe), 3/4 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, & 1/2 teaspoons of each: cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Slow cooker for 3 1/2 hours. Then get my electric mixer to chop it up the rest of the way, and stick it in the fridge to cool. Love, love, love! Thanks guys!

OH MY. There are no words to describe how good this is. Plus it's super easy to make. I usually add in 1/4 cup of brown sugar for extra depth of flavor and because I like it sweet :) I like to let it cook down until it just starts to stick to the bottom of the pan. It really concentrates all of the flavors, making it even better! You simply MUST try this and see for yourself!

This was wonderful!  I've never had, much less made, homemade applesauce before.  It was quick and easy.  I served it with grilled pork tenderloin and mashed potatoes.  My husband doesn't compliment my cooking often.  This was no exception...or so I thought.  The next day we went to visit his parents.  We had only been there a few minutes when his mother said my husband had told her how delicious the meal had been the night before.  I wish my husband would say it to me, but this was a great feeling too!  I've made this a few time since, and it's always delicious.  Makes good leftovers too!

I've never made homemade applesauce, but this was easy and so good!  We didn't even get to the mashing part...just ate the apple chunks.  The only thing I changed was instead of so much sugar, I used about 1.5 TBSP splenda/sugar blend and probably a little more cinnamon.  Great recipe!

This is really good applesauce!--I used fuji apples, and if you can it, it can last for up to a year. Using a blender to mash the apples is easier than mashing by hand too.

Super delicious and simple. This is great if you're like me and get excited in the store, buy apples, and then almost forget about them. Use them to make this applesauce!

This is delicious.  I made it exactly as stated.  It was a little watery at first, but I threw it in the food processor and it came out perfect!  The whole family loves it.  They all said it was much better than the jar stuff.  I have even been using it to replace oil in the bran muffin recipe I got off this site! YUM! Thanks for the great recipe!

I omitted the sugar all together as I used red delicious apples, they're sweet enough. It turned out just as delicious. Blend in a food processor to make it smooth and gooey!

So good and SOOOO easy!!!!  I make this all the time with all of the leftover ugly apples that don't get eaten.  Leave the skins on for fiber & nutrition, no one will ever even know!!!  Also, I use splenda & pumpkin pie spice in mine.  Love it.

Excellent! I used fuji apples, which tend to be sweeter, so I used about half the sugar.  I also put it in my slow-cooker for a few hours.  I stirred occasionally and it came out perfect!

Normally I'm a real strickler for keeping to a recipe as is the first time and I don't like to review a recipe that is not the original...but as I read more and more reviews I think what the heck are reviews for if not to help improve the recipe.  That said I made a tripple batch of this recipe using a mixture of Gala, Granny Smith and Red Delicious apples, about half the water and half the sugar and about double the cinnamon and about a 1/2 teaspoon of clove, I think it came out wonderful.

This applesauce is sooooo good. I made it with pink lady and granny smith apples.   I also cooked it on high in my crock pot for 4 hours.  The apples hardley needed any mashing. Will make again soon.

I made this today, and wow I love it! so simple to make, very tasty. I didn't put any sweetner or sugar, because I wanted unsweetened applesauce to make banana oat muffin. Now, I will never buy storebought applesauce again, I will going to make this often. Thank you for submitting the recipe, God Bless!

I had 3 apples and 1 large peach. I used Splenda instead of sugar, and I used a little more cinnamon, and it turned out fantastic! I'm on a temporary no-fat, no-dairy diet, and this was wonderful on pork loin. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I did this recipe but used Splenda instead of sugar. I used a little less than the recipe calls for.  I quadrupled the recipe, but only added 3/4 c. splenda.  It was a hit with my family.

I canned the applesauce, so I make these changes to the recipe... I cut up about 13 apples, whole-no peeling. I quarter them and throw them in a large pot with 1/2 cup of water and 1 1/2 Tsp cinnamon. Cover and cook them until they are broken down. Next I laddle the apples into a food mill that seperates the skins/seeds/stems from the apple. I then laddle the applesauce in to cans and process them for 20 mins in a canner. Super easy and sooooo much bought.

Amazing applesauce, and so easy!  Very budget friendly.  Makes me wonder why I've paid for the premade stuff at the store.  Thank you for such an amazing recipe!

This is the first time I've ever made applesauce. I couldn't wait for it to cool! It was amazing! The only thing i changed was I split the sugar 1/2 and 1/2 with splenda. Don't think it's gonna stay in the house long!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

Awesome Applesauce.  My only recommendation is to not add all the sugar at once.  Depending on the apples you use, you may not want to add as much sugar as this recipe calls for.

My aunt gave me a TON of apples from her tree and I quickly began looking for a recipe.  I used this one and quadrupled it except for the cinnamon.  I used only 1 tsp.  We all love it.  My daughter said it was even better than my aunt's which is the best rating a person can get!

Made this applesauce today and it is wonderful and so easy to make! A little sweet, but I think that is because of the apples I used.  You may want to adjust the sugar depending on the type of apple you will be using. I also used just a dash of cinnamon due to personal preference, and ran it through the food processor. My 5 year old loves it!

Made this today and it's delicious!  I left the peel on when I cooked the apples (trick I learned from my grandfather) gives the applesauce a nice pink color.  Yummy!

I find mixing apple varieties (I love a couple granny smiths, a couple galas, and a couple MacIntosh apples balances sweetness wonderfully) and adding more cinnamon produces a very nice balance.  Also freezes well for the winter!

Fantastic and simple. I used Granny Smith apples and the amount of sugar was just right. The only change I made was to use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon (because I grabbed the wrong container.) Tasted great regardless.

Great recipe. A good simple applesauce. I adjusted the sugar just a little because my apples were not as sweet. I also tripled the recipe and canned it. It made 3 pint jars with a little leftover for dinner. Make applesauce as directed and add a little lemon juice beore pouring into pints. Hot water processed for 15 minutes. Yummy!

I have made applesauce this way all my life, its a no-brainer!  Probably would use a little less water, just enough to keep it from sticking to the pan.  Now we use Splenda instead of sugar for a zero point Weight Watcher fruit.

SO easy and SO delicious! It's like apple pie in a bowl. My husband is gone for a few days, I was looking for a sweet treat and I needed a way to unload all of these apples in my fridge. Perfect pick-me-up and cheer-me-up, THANK YOU!!

This was my first attempt at making applesauce, and the recipe is very easy. I doubled it to use 8 apples because I wanted to be able to can some to eat later. I started out using a potato masher to squash the apples once they had cooked for about 30 minutes, but it was still too chunky for my preference. So I used my stick blender to smooth it out, and it turned out perfectly in texture. I tasted the applesauce while it was still hot, and it seemed way too tangy to me so I stirred in another 1/2 cup of sugar. Then I put it in the jars, sealed them, and let everything cool. Well, something must have happened during the cooling because now my applesauce is very sweet! I'll definitely leave out that extra 1/2 cup sugar next time. :-)

I used 3 1/2 Pink Lady apples, along with about 3/4 TS cinnamon. It took it about 30 minutes to cook, though. Let it cool off some and got a beautiful chunky applesauce. GREAT recipe!

I just made this!  Oh...My...Gawd!  So easy, and simply delish!  We are watching sugar, so I followed the recipe but substituted Truvia for the sugar.  I used 5 packets (which equals 10 tsp) instead of the 6 to equal 1/4c. sugar and it was plenty sweet enough.  I may cut down to 4 next time, and there WILL be a NEXT TIME!

This was so easy and delicious! I used 6 snack Gala apples and half of the of recommended sugar. I thought it was perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness. This was primarily made for my 10 month old but everyone just loved it including him!

Absolutely fantastic. I made this for Easter and it was a big hit. I used a mix of Pink Lady, Golden Delicious, Fuji, and Green apples and it made a nice blend. Really an easy, great recipe.

Awesome! I used golden delicious apples and I also left the skin on. Another change I made was to puree the sauce instead of mashing it. This made it a lot faster and chopped the skin down quite a bit.

DELICIOUS! Will not be buying applesauce from the store again. I doubled the cinnamon and used a little less sugar (somewhere between 1/8 cup and 1/4 cup) since I like my applesauce a little more tart, turned out GREAT. This is so rich and delicious, I was thinking to myself it would make an excellent pie or dessert filling, with a scoop of ice cream on top. Of course it is great as it, we will definitely make this again and again as a lite dessert.

Um, that was amazing. Once the apples were soft, I dumped the whole pot into my Magic Bullet blender and WOWOW we have a perfectly fresh yummy applesauce for my toddler to enjoy. Thanks so much! Will make again and again.

Great recipe. Grandma used to make this with red-hot candies, plus some sugar. The red-hots gave it a pretty pink color and added a delightful cinnamon flavor.

This is delicious, especially warm!  I have completely omitted the sugar and it is still great.  If you want a special treat, serve warm with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream - yummy!

I made this apple sauce the first time for my 9 mos old son. He loved it! I followed the recipe as described. It was easy to make. Next time I'll use less sugar for my kids. I think my son was on sugar high. Thanks for this easy applesauce recipe. I will never buy applesauce again.

Really enjoyed this recipe, homemade is so much better than store bought.  Made as is and used Truvia (according to adjusted converted servings on their website), honeycrisp & golden delicious and it turned out awesome!  Make sure you let it cool in the fridge completely.

Delicious! I used a fuji apple.  Since they're so sweet, I did not add the sugar.  When they were cooked, i let them cool and then I used my blender to make it a nice smooth texture instead of a chunkier one.

I never knew applesauce was so delicious until I made it myself! I used Jonathan apples (NOT peeled or cored), filled a 12 quart stockpot, added just a bit of water (half cup?) and just a bit of sugar (half cup?) and sprinkled on the cinnamon. Let it simmer for an hour or two, stirring it down occasionally, then put it through my kitchenaid fruit & veggie strainer, and canned it in a waterbath canner. It's so much better than anything you can buy at the store. YUM.

Great recipe! I made this according to the recipe and used red delicious apples. I had to use my blender since I don't have a masher but I only blended for a few seconds and it turned out PERFECT! I think next time I'll double the recipe and jar it.

Very easy, just the right amount of cinnamon/sugar, but I did use 1 extra apple (jonagolds I had that were getting too soft). Cooked in crockpot on high 4 hours. Better than store-bought applesauce!!

This was an excellent recipe. Mine came out really watery. I think it's because my apples were really small. So I just picked the apple chunks out of the liquid and mashed them in a seperate bowl. It was fabulous!!

Had a glut of apples to use up, and this was the perfect recipe for it. Came out not too sweet, not too bland. On my first batch I put it in the food processor to mash it, and a few pulses made it perfect; the second batch I tried a stick blender and it was much too puréed. Admittedly, a manual potato masher probably would have done as good a job as the food processor, with less cleanup.

Oh wow this is absolutely fabulous! I left the skins on my apples and used Splenda. I also pureed it in a blender because I like my applesauce smooth. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, it is delicious!

LOVE IT!  This applesauce is so good.  I added some cloves (really good), allspice, ginger, and increased the cinnamon cause I love cinnamon.  This is the first homemade applesauce that my roommate likes!

This was great... I had a pork roast in the oven and was setting the table and discovered I was out of applesauce... I was about to go to the store, but realized I had a big bag of apples on the counter and decided to look for a recipe.  Glad I did!  I never thought it would be this easy, and so much better than the bottled stuff!

I've made this probably 5 or 6 times (now I'm considering buying an apple peeler so I can make it more. When I make it I DON'T ADD SUGAR. I always use gala apples which are sweet enough. I peel and chunk the apples doubling to 8 apples add about 1/2 the amount of water. and the cinnamon. I take a rubber spatula and stir so that the apples are slightly wet with water and coated with cinnamon. I cook them on low in my slow cooker and give them a mash after 3-4 hours and let them cook a little more. This is wonderful. My 'sugarhound' husband didn't miss the sugar. I served this heated over vanilla frozen yogurt last night and it was AMAZING! Don't be afraid to adjust the sugar in this recipe and remember apples are about 85% water so you don't need a lot of water in this recipe. Just give it a quick stir w/ a rubber spatula from time to time to keep the apples moist while they cook down.

This is a great recipe! So quick and easy too! I added a few shakes of nutmeg.... yum! I have a 3 month old daughter and will definitely make this for her once she can eat solid foods. Thank you!

This is awesome! I doubled the first time and put in the crock for 3-4 hours. Then I mashed and let cool. Since my hubby is a texture person, I ran the mixture through the blender to get the texture to regular applesauce consistency. I am making this again and now am quadrupling it!

I hadn't made homemade applesauce before, but I will definitely be making it from now on.  So easy, and super delicious.  My husband raved!  So much better than the store bought stuff.

Glad I discoverd this recipe. I used maple syrup in place of sugar. It was yummy! I also steamed my apples too.

There is nothing like homemade applesauce and no comparison to the store-bought variety!  I made this last year and froze it but forgot to review it.  I am making more now from apples a friend harvested and gave me, but this time with Splenda.  Just as delicious!

I served doughnuts for breakfast and needed a slightly healthier side-- and the applesauce was PERFECT!  I replaced the 1/4 cup of white sugar with 1/8 c. (2 Tbsp.) brown sugar and 1/8 c. Splenda.  It was delicious, everyone agreed.  I was very generous with the cinnamon, and even added a dash of nutmeg for extra spice.  I took a potato masher to it to get the right consistency.

This is the second time I made this and it was COMPLETELY different!  This time, I loved it.  I used a pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cinnamon and it was AWESOME.  It is good warm or cold and is like a delicious apple pie filling!

I read the reviews before making this. I doubled the recipe using granny smith apples. Instead of water I used apple cider, like one review said. I used less of sugar. It was perfect!

I've been making this recipe for some time. Yum Yum in my Tum! I started making it for my nephew when he was about 9 months old. I didn't add sugar as I used Fuji and/or Gala apples, which tend to be sweet. He LOVED it! I continue to make it without sugar, just personal taste and it's healthier.

I love this recipie, I never have done homemade applesauce before and I had a flat of apples and decided to look up a recipe and liked this one the best.  It is delicious.  I also did in my slow cooker w/ 5 lbs of apples 1 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon to our liking.  It is the best.  My kids LOVE it.

Pretty basic applesauce recipe - which is good.  However, if you want to live on the wild side, toss in a handful of razzzzberries or any other kind of fruit that suits your taste.  Finally, ditch the pots and slowcooker and get out the pressure cooker.  Eight apples worth of sauce takes about 2 1/2 minutes. You can thank me later.

Wow, this recipe really takes applesauce to a new level. I used both green and red apples - don't know the types but they were both on the tart side (they grow on our property) - organic sugar, which adds a bit of a molasses back ground and cinnamon. I used my crock pot so I reduced the water just a little bit.
Doubled the recipe and put the pot on high for 4 hours. It only required some stirring to break the apples up. Excellent! Never knew applesauce could taste so good.

This recipe is awesome. I thought it seemed too simple when reading the recipe and I thought it would need something else for sure... but all I did was add a bunch of cinnamon because that's how we like it! Thanks so much. It's so refreshing to make your own food and to know what EXACTLY is in it!

Very good basic recipe!  I made this in a small crockpot. I substituted apple cider for the water and added an extra tsp. of ground cinnamon.  I used Gala apples because that is what I had on hand.  Next time, I will cut back the liquid by 1/2 C if I use Galas.  For my taste, I know I'd prefer to use an apple that is a little on the tart side.  (Usually have Galas for hubby.)

This was okay. I don't exactly agree with what others have said; to me, it tasted like the apple sauce bought from the store. If you want a basic apple sauce recipe, this is it. Nothing special here. Also, I had to wait a lot longer, compared to the recipe time, for most of the water to go away, otherwise it would have been too watery. Looks beautiful with cinnamon sprinkled on top, surrounded by apples =)

I don't even like applesauce yet really enjoyed the end product from this recipe.  I gave 4 stars because I needed to tweak a couple of things.  I doubled the recipe but used 12 apples instead of the 8 called for in the doubling.  I used the same amount of water, only 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I coarsely chopped the apples, added all ingredients to a big pot, slapped on a lid and let everything cook for 25 minutes.  I stirred once, let it cook another 10 minutes with the lid off to let it boil down some and then used my immersion blender to get it to the right consistency.  I've given jars of this stuff to 3 people and they all swear it is the best applesauce they've ever had.  For reference, I used Red Rome and Golden Delicious apples I picked 1 week before.

As a mom of 5, I am always looking for something new that my kids will enjoy.  We had a bunch of apples as the result of my son's FFA fundraiser, and he wanted to try to make applesauce.  This recipe was easy to follow, even when increasing the portion size.  My 7-year old daughter even pitched in.  The two of them were so pleased when the others raved about the applesauce!!

Really yummy applesauce! It's delicious either warm or cold. I used about 5 small Gala apples and 1/8 cup sugar, and that was definitely sweet enough. I tried using just 1/2 cup water as some people recommended, but it was too dry so I ended up adding some apple juice. Just like refreshing apple pie filling.

My whole family loves this!!!!! I used small apples (macintosh) so I put about 3 or 4 extra apples in, I was a little worried it wouldn't taste as good...but this was wonderful! I also used Splenda instead of sugar. Our house filled with the smell of.....baked apple pie....this just smells heavenly! The taste is great too! I didn't mash it, we liked it 'lumpy', used on pancakes, folded into pie crust 'squares', with oatmeal, tossed into a muffin recipe, mixed with apple cider, the list goes on!! Of course....my baby loves this just on it's own....thank you for sharing!

All thumbs up from my family.  Hot applesauce is such a nice change from cold.  I only used 1/2 c. water, as the other reviews said it was too watery.  I added a pinch of ground cloves which added a wonderful aroma and taste.  Next time I will also try adding a little nutmeg.

This recipe is a winner, it only takes about 5 minutes of prep. time and another 15-20 to cook, really easy.  Not only was it simple but it tunred out great, made it with some pork roast.  One suggestion, was a tad sweet for our taste, reduced sugar by 1/2, was still great.  Thanks.

So easy! I had never made applesauce before and now I swear, I'll never buy it again. This recipe is perfect, though I would cut the sugar in half and experiment with some more spices next time (nutmeg, maybe a bit more cinnamon). I would also like to try it without the sugar at all...the apples I buy are pretty sweet already.

I made this tonight, and it was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly except I blended the apples after they were cooked. I used gold and delicious apples, and It came out great! It was the perfect combination of tart and sweetness. I never thought in a million years that I'd make apple sauce. I didn't even know exactly how it was made before today. I was looking for recipes with apples so I could use them before they spoiled.

Update: After I made the bigger batch, I had 1 apple left over. I tried to make apple sauce in a mug the next morning with that one apple by cutting down the recipe and putting it in the microwave. I don't remember how long I put it in there, but I stirred it once a minute. It turned out great too. I didn't blend it that time.

I make it all the time with organic Fuji or Gala apples and add the cinnamon but not the sugar. Would have rated it a 5 except for the sugar.

I have been wanting to make applesauce for ages but always thought it too time consuming. But when I actually looked into it I of course realized I was wrong. I also found that there were as many ways to make it as there were recipes. I chose this recipe because it used the simplest of ingredients and in my humble opinion applesauce should be simple. I had about 2 dozen or so apples that needed to find a new purpose so I quadrupled the recipe except for the sugar as I was using my two favorite kinds, Red Delicious and Golden Delicious, which are sweet on their own. I only added a little under 3/4c sugar. Well it turned out perfect! By the time it cooled enough to be jarred my daughters had eaten a quarter of it.
Thanks for the best recipe. Will be making this many times in the future.

Quick and easy, but I found it to be much too sweet.  I also think it needed more cinnamon, but we are cinnamon fanatics in this house.  

Next time, I think I will try using less sugar, and using brown sugar instead of white, as others have suggested.

This recipe is simple and fool proof. I used 8 apples, 1/2 cup of water, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and NO SUGAR. I let it cook for about 25 minutes. It cooled down for about five minutes and then I mashed with a potato masher. The  finished product was flavorful and not too sweet. I did not use Granny Smiths.

Wow, it doesn't get any easier than this.  I didn't even add sugar, just apples we picked from the orchard last weekend and the cinnamon and water.  It was so delicious - it was ridiculous!

I discovered this recipe several years ago, and it is delicious.  I used Rome apples and substituted Splenda for sugar.  Also increased the amount of cinnamon, because of my personal preference.  Highly recommend!

I did not add any sugar, instead squeezed a couple slices of fresh lemon.  I found it sufficiently sweet for my taste buds, and it makes this recipe virtually guilt free!

Delicious applesauce.  Didn't use sugar, since we wanted an unsweetened version.  Depending on what kind of apples used and personal preference, I would consider the sugar optional.

I only made a few changes and it turned out really delicious.  Since I used honeycrisp apples which are plenty sweet and have a higher water content already, I lowered the sugar down to 1 tablespoon and lowered the water to 1/2 cup.
Everything else was done exactly how the recipe states and it was great ^_^

Great recipe and going into my recipe book, but listen before you make this recipe! Add more water when it runs out, I did this my first time and it came out so good. Plus, if you want to you can cook it a little bit more so the smashing is easier.

I LOVED this! It is so much better than the store bought brands. My family loved this. Next time I'll make a double batch. Mine probably made anywhere from 1 to 1 1/2 cups of sauce. It was so delicious! I definitely recommend this. It is so easy. I think this would be a good recipe to make for little kids. Loved it!

I have been making this for some time and we love it.  I use my slow cooker and it works great, cooking for 3 to 4 hours on high.  I use Granny Smith apples even though I read somewhere that they don't make good applesauce...it my house they are wonderful!

I thought this was a very good starting point recipe. I did use a sweeter apple (Fuji), so I cut the sugar down to 2 teaspoons and even still it's a little sweet to me. Also, there was a lot of water left, so I let it boil without the lid on for about 5 more minutes to evaporate some of the water. I made two batches, both sans cinnamon, plain for my husband, and added a half cup of blueberries to mine for extra flavor. Ran them through the food processor when I finished, and they both came out really great.

My husband loved this, and he is a sugaraholic. I could not believe he didn't feel the need to add more sugar. I followed the recipe, but took the advice of one and cooked it in the slow cooker. Canned some and shared with my Mom. Everyone thought it was great!

I love this one!! It is awesome the only thing I did differently was add a little bit of nutmeg. And after it was cooked I had to drain a little bit of the juice out and it was awesome. :):) Very good I will use this one again.

Great base recipe! I only made a couple minor changes, I increased the amount of apples as I had a lot to use up and required a lot more apple sauce then this recipe creates. I also waited and added sugar to taste, as it most definitely did not require as much sugar as called for. I made one batch with the cinnamon and then for the second batch I substituted it for a handful of raspberries to make a delicious batch of raspberry apple sauce! Just as good as those store bought containers! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

this recipe is so easy and so delicious!  So glad I found it.  Next time I'll add less sugar though (to reduce calories) but quick, easy and nutritious...all good!!

I have made this over a dozen times since I found this. This is one of my favorite recipes for when extra kids are around. :D  Today we had 6 kids total, I used 10 apples and adjust ingredients... I pull out the apples from the syrupy juice... and only add some of the liquid. Throw it in my food processor, we end up with the absolute best thick applesauce., with no leftovers. Thank you for posting it :D

I bought a bag of rather tasteless apples and figured I would try applesauce to see if I could salvage them since my kids wouldn't eat them. This worked like a charm! Instead of water I used some peach cider I bought from a local farm and it came out tasting great!

This is one of the easiest recipes ever! I don' like the cinnamon so for me it was not a big hit, but my husband ate the whole batch! I am definitely going to make this again, with some twist and turns. Thanks!

The taste of this recipe is delicious!! The only comment we could make on perhaps improving it, is that it turned out a little watery for our tastes - we would rather a thicker applesauce, so we'll probably reduce the water next time. But yum!!

Very yumm and I warm it up, place a scoop of vanila ice cream on top. It's almost like apple pie without the extra. I have a question though, how long can you store this and how? fridge or peckled?

Wow! Wow! Wow! Excellent recipe. My husband raved about it. We used apples from a neighbor's tree (don't know what kind) and it was excellent. Followed directions exactly with no changes.

This is a really easy, great-tasting recipe.  The only thing I do differently is to add apple juice instead of water.  I also make sure to use Granny Smith or other tart apples.

LOVE this applesauce!  I've tripled the recipe and I've made it with sugar blends, once with white sugar blend and once with brown sugar blend, and it is outstanding either way.  I have to pace myself or I could easily eat it all.  Thanks, Sarah, for this great recipe.

I used the advice Reviewed on Mar. 8, 2007 by Jules and doubled the recipe and cooked it in my slow cooker for 3-4 hrs. I peeled the apples and tossed them in the cinnamon and sugar and then added them to the slow cooker before cooking. Then I also added a dash of ground cloves just for fun. This recipe is so easy in the slow cooker and the taste is wonderful.

DELICIOUS! The is a very easy recipe too. I opted for the slow-cooker version. Approx 4 hrs on high. I used 4 large apples and omitted the sugar (was plenty sweet without). Made a huge batch and will def replace the stuff in a jar from now on.

Like others, I wanted to include the peelings for extra nutrition but I also wanted my 9-month old to be able to eat it so I pureed the peels separately and added them to the apples before cooking.  I used 12 apples, 1 1/2 cups water, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 cup sugar and cooked it all in the slowcooker on high for 4 hours.  It's a little watery and sweet so I'd reduce the water to 1 cup and sugar to 1/2 cup next time.  Still very tasty!

I would use only half of the sugar but was so much better than store brand.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and made it in my slow cooker.  So easy and delicious.

The kids (5 and 6 yo) and I made this exactly as the directions stated.  Turned out perfect.  We went to the orchard and are planning on making more for the winter!
UPDATE: I made this again with much smaller apples.  I found that 1 lb 10 oz of small apples (before coring them) gave me the same results as 4 large apples.

This is the best applesauce i have ever had.  Made a big batch of it for canning.  I gave my two year old a taste after cooling and she ate a cup of it and said thanks a million times.  This is a keeper and one I will make every year with my apples.

Used a variety of apples--Johngold, Mutzu, September Wonder, and Rome--and quadrupled the recipe. It yielded 7 pints which I processed for 20 minutes in the canner. I don't like my applesauce sweet, so I only used 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon total. Very pleased.

Oh my goodness! This is the BEST applesauce I have ever tasted...seriously! I used Macintosh apples and followed another reviewers suggestion and tossed everything into my slow cooker. When it was done, I used my immersion blender to smooth the applesauce (my kids don't like chunks or lumps). Adjust sugar according to the sweetness of the apples you use and adjust the cinnamon to your personal tastes. This recipe has found a home in my permanent recipe file!

I had a bushel of apples to use, so started with about 30 apples using this recipe.  Added about 1 1/2 tsp of nutmeg along with 2 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon.  Used 2c Splenda instead of sugar and now have 8 pints of canned applesauce!  

Thanks for sharing!

This is perfect. My only idea to add is boil the cores and peels in some water then use that water (after you strain it) for your applesauce. More apple goodness!I also suggest tripling the recipe and saving some in freezer bags for out of season enjoyment.

This is the best applesauce.  So much better than in the stores AND it's easy to make (even someone like me can do it!).  My dh and ds eats it up as fast as I make it.

Tripled the recipe and threw it into my crockpot for about 4 1/2 hours on low. As it cooked I stirred it with a wisk. At the end it was a fantastic chunky applesauce.

I use this basic recipe every year.....we use Lodi apples which are available for a SHORT time in the summer around here.  My mom and I do several bushels of apples and freeze the applesauce for the rest of the year.  It is great for a quick applecrisp base too!  Great BASIC recipe.....different apples obviously yield different tastes and results.

I'm not a huge fan of applesauce, but this is pretty good. I would suggest using a food processor or blender. Any other method makes for a really chunky sauce. Very easy to approximate amounts needed for the ingredients.

I made this with a couple changes. I used brown sugar instead of white. I also added a teaspoon of butter and a dash of salt with a mashed the apples. It turned out really good and I will definitely make it again.

I gave it a 4 star only because I had to change it!
I had to change the sugar to a sugar substitute for my Hubby who is type 2 diabetic but it's still great.
For added fiber and vitamins, leave the skin on and whip it all up in the food processor. Gives it an almost apple butter texture.

Couldn't be easier.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  After it cooled down, I stirred in two packets.  It was great.

Oh my gosh! I made this twice in two days and its amazing. I only had three apples and so used approximately half of everything the first time and found it slightly too sweet. The next time I made it, today, I used one soup spoon of sugar for 3 apples and its perfect! So healthy and so yummy! thank you very much!

this is a very good recipe. i just made some a few minutes ago. my only suggestion is that you add a tablespoon or so of lemon juice, just to perk the flavor a bit.

This applesauce was amazing! It wasn't nearly as hard to make as I imagined. Its a great thing to make when returning from an apple orchard. I found that using a hand blender to mash it up was a lot easier. Definitely making it again!

As written, this recipe is just okay. I made it once as the recipe specified, and a second time with revisions. The second time I made it, I LOVED it!  My changes- reduce water by 1/4 cup, add 1/4 cup sugar free vanilla syrup, no sugar, double the cinnamon, add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves. DELISH!

i'm not sure how many apples i had. I had a big bag of presliced apples that were heading bad that i picked through the good ones and i had 1 large granny smith apple. I used 4 pkgs of slenda and kinda eye balled the cinnimon. I did have to add more water and the granny smith took a bit of time to get smushable. I just left them chunky. It turned out really good. I would buy apples just for this recipe. Its really comforting warm.

Loved it!  This applesauce was so easy to make.  I think I chopped the apples too much, which made them difficult to mash.  However, the food processor made up for my mistake!  I will definitely make this again very soon.

My husband apsolutly loved the applesauce.  I made this recipe again and put 1/2 of the sugar it called for because the other batch I made I thought was a bit sweet.  I will let everyone know how this batch is.  Thank you for Sarah's Applesauce!

Very good. I didn't add sugar.  I usually buy my kids the organic unsweetened and had run out.  I doubled the recipe and added water as needed as I went along.  Even though I mashed it well, it had some little chunks, which to me, were really good.  It was almost like apple pie taste, without the crust.  My kids were more finicky and next time I will puree it down more for them.

This recipe was a great jumping off point. I doubled the recipe, used half white sugar and half brown sugar, added a couple dashes of nutmeg and used a little less cinnamon. Yum!

It's really easy and yummy. Thanks for posting. I changed it a little bit and it was still really good. Instead of sugar, I used 2 tablespoons of honey and I used more cinnamon which gave it a brownish color. I added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest to it from the beginning. I also mashed the apples as they were being cooked. I brushed inside of hot sandwich buns with butter and filled them with this apple sauce (warm) and took them for my breakfast which were really tasty and fresh. I also baked it for 20 minutes in a tart shell and it turned out really great.

This recipe is delicious!  Very easy to make and with great results.  My five year old took his first taste of it and screamed "This is THE BEST applesauce ever! It's incredible!"  And I have to agree.  First time making this today with apples we picked at the orchard- will definitely not be the last time we make this in our house.  I followed the recipe exactly without any changes.

I used Granny Smith apples and they worked fine. Was a little on the sweet side for me so will either reduce sugar or add 1 more apple.

I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did because it is so good.  Very easy and so flavorful compared to store bought.  (I used less water for a thicker apple sauce.)

Yum!  I drained off a bit of the liquid before mashing because it looked too juice, but other than that it is perfect!  I used half Gala and half Golden Delicioius.

We used the unique crab apples that grow on a tree in our neighbors yard.  The tree is quite old, and produces a huge number of very tart smallish apples.  When cooked, the skins are very soft.  This recipe is very simple; when followed to the letter (leaving the skins on), it produced a sauce that was a tad on the lumpy side, so we pureed it in a food processor.  The net result was a *highly* delicious apple *jam*.  We then tried tripling the recipe, but it proved to be *far* too much water, requiring a very long time to boil down.  So when multiplying the recipe, I recommend cutting down on the water substantially.

Delicious!  I used four red apples and followed the remaining ingredients to a T.  However, I highly recommend using a food processor to get the store style consistency.

Holy smokes was this good. Extremely easy to make. Made two batches- one with cinnamon and one without. Both tasted incredible. We used Gala apples for this. Going to try Red Delicious next time. Thanks a bunch for this recipe!

Excellent applesauce!  I had some extra apples and found this recipe.  Was very quick to make.  And, the kids I was babysitting really liked it a lot.  Mine tasted and appeared in color closer to the cinnamon applesauce in the store than the one pictured.    Although, it very similar to the store cinnamon applesauce it is actually much better in taste and texture.  The adults liked this also, that do not normally eat applesauce.  Note: Make sure to use a medium pot instead of a small one, as the applesauce will boil over in a smaller pot.  And, the recipe will only make about 5 very small servings, so you might want to make more. Taste good the next day after it is refridgerated to.  Thank you submitter!  Will definitely make again!

I made this earlier today and my husband and I just finished eating the last bit of it!   Really Delicious!   Not too sweet, just right.  I used 6 diced apples instead of 4 since they seemed small to me (3 McIntosh and 3 Gala),  1/2 cup water,  1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 tsp cinnamon for just a hint of flavor.  I put it all in a small Crockpot (as someone here suggested) and in 3 hours, I had the PERFECT applesauce!!  Super delicious!!  I did not have to use a potato masher since they kind of dissolved on their own.   My only suggestion would be to double or triple the batch!  Thanks  for the great recipe, Phatcat!

At my local farmer's market, they have 3lbs for a dollar, so I usually pick up a bag and lug it home with no clue what to do with it! I plugged in the crock pot and went to town. this was really good. I do think one does not need to add so much water, start small and add as needed. I also added in some more spices, like cloves, ginger and allspice and bit of nutmeg. Perfect for an early fall day

I have taken to making this applesauce about every week; it's that good and that easy.  Nonetheless, I had troubles making it at first.  Some tips - you have to cook it until the apples are soft (although cooking it for a shorter time makes the applesauce chunkier), and if you have to add more water, add it.  You don't want your apples swimming in your applesauce, obviously, but adding more water makes your applesauce moister, your apples softer, and eventually easier to mash.  Also, some people have suggesting not using Granny Smith apples because they are too tart, but I don't find that to be the case.  Definitely the applesauce has more tang to it, but it's nowhere near as sour as when you eat a Granny Smith apple on its own.  I think watering it down more, though, may dilute the sourness.

Took the advice of others and threw this in the slow cooker. I'm not an applesauce person (I made them to go with latkes for a party) but this is really good. Doubled the recipe but didn't double the sugar; also, used half white and half brown sugar. I would probably cut back on the water. Chopping the apple: next time, I will do three of the apples into smaller pieces and the fourth in larger chunks - the crock pot doesn't break them down as much as I expected. I'd definitely make this again just for myself!

I made a double batch of this applesauce in my slow cooker and it was AMAZING. I set it to high for about 5 hours and just had to stir to get a nice smooth sauce. I'm about to make my 2nd batch to can for Christmas gifts!

WOW! Now my boyfriend and I LOVE applesauce :D  Thank you sooo much! We did lower the sugar a little bit because we don't like it too sugary and we did not put in cinnamon because we don't like it in applesauce.  A great recipe, a keeper!

This is so delightful and so easy. I used 2 granny smith and 2 gala apples. I cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar. I also used 1/2 cup water and increased cooking time to about 40-45 minutes. It couldn't have been more perfect. I will make this again and again. Also, I chopped the apple up pretty small so that by the time it was done cooking there was hardly any mashing at all to do.

I used 5 Johnamac apples and a 1/2 a Johnagold and only used 1/2 c water, but the sugar and cinnamon as suggested. I put them in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours.  I put them in sliced, not chopped, so that helped cut down on the time.  The applesauce is delish!

This is a great recipe.  One thing that makes it MUCH LESS WORK, is to skip peeling and coring your apples - if you have a food mill.  I used apples from my neighbor's tree and off the ground.  I washed them, cut out the bad spots and quartered them.  I filled my Dutch Oven with the apples, added 1 1/2 cups of water and cooked them for about 20 minutes.  Then I ran them through the food mill.  This left me with a nice applesauce with a rosey color.  I also recommend tasting your applesauce before adding sugar.  I used a sweet apple, so only needed a couple spoons of sugar.  The kids LOVE it!!

The entire family loved the Apple Sauce. Stay with the recipe. I added a little extra cinnamon the 2nd time I made it and it came out dark.

This was super easy and gave me a great side that I can have available in the fridge at all times.  I used a tiny bit more cinammon than called for because I like my applesauce to have a lot of flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this a lot.  I cut up, and freeze my apples, so year round I can make applesauce - I definitely double or triple the recipe based on my bag of frozen apples. Hubby likes it with less  cinnamin - sometimes I leave it out all together - very good!

This applesauce cooked up thick and delicious! Since I was using apples that were in my freezer, I decreased the water some. Once cooked, I pureed them in my food processor. The result was a cinnamon applesauce better than the store's. Thanks!! I will be using this recipe on the rest of the apples.

I make this in a crock pot--not necessarily because it's better, but because the smell lingers for about a day after it's finished. This is a fabulous easy recipe I use time and time again.

I needed to make A LOT of this because I wanted to can it for Christmas gifts.  It turned out great!  What I used:
24 Gala apples
4 Cups water
1 1/2 Cups sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
sprinkle nutmeg

I put them all in the slow cooker on high and it took about 4 hours.  It was a bit too watery during the cooking process so I used a turkey baster to remove some of the liquid.  This made a really great apple cider that my kids loved!  I would reduce the water in the future, but got a great cider from it.  Thanks for the recipe! (It ended up making 3 quart sized jars of applesauce for you canners). Thanks again!

This recipe was very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out great.  I used three golden delicious apples and one fiji apple.  It had a great flavor and the amount of cinnamon was perfect.

SOOO good! It's delicious and so easy. Adding 1 whole vanilla bean or 1/2 tsp vanilla extract makes it so fragrant and taste like apple pie! I used apples I had around, 1 red delicious and 3 Fuji. I kept the peels on, which ads a pretty color, a little crunch and a lot more insoluble fiber. I used a about 1/8 cup sugar figuring I could add more later, and it was perfect. I didn't have cinnamon, so I used pumpkin pie spice. The spice with nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon made it well-rounded. And it smells AMAZING when it's cooking. I'll never buy jarred applesauce again!

I made this today to use up some apples I had in the house. I used 8 apples and a bit less sugar but kept everything else the same. I cooked them longer like other reviewers suggested about 40 minutes and didn't bother mashing them. They were delicious! I really enjoyed eating the applesauce warm. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Any homemade applesauce is better than commercial stuff, which is all watered down. But try this recipe with less water (you only need a bit, just to keep the apples from sticking, as there's lots of natural water in the apples) and with brown sugar to taste instead of white sugar. Gives a yummy caramel taste.

As a college student, this is a perfect and simple recipe, especially during the winter.  I bypassed the mashing step, but my roommate and I both loved this light dish.

This was delicious, but I made the following modifications:

1. I doubled the cinnamon
2. I used brown sugar instead of white
3. I cooked it in a crockpot, 5 hours on low.  No need to reduce the liquid, it's perfect!

My family loved this applesauce.  They said it tasted just like apple pie.  I used 16 apples, 3/4 cup of Splenda, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cardamom.   I was a little concerned that it was too watery, but I just let it simmer longer and it thickened right up.  I never made apple sauce before.  It tasted SO much better then store bought!

Diabetics, don't fear; this recipe is just as delicious with Splenda. I used  much more cinnamon than called for but the times and measurements made for extremely beautiful, chunky applesauce.

I had WAY too many apples on my trees this year and thought I'd try this recipe.  It turned out great, even though I used a variety of the apples I had, and it froze very well.  Needless to say, I'll be having fresh applesauce from now until next fall!

This is a great simple applesauce. I doubled the recipe and added the apples and water only, and cooked 20 minutes as directed covered. It looked like way too much liquid, so i cooked it an additional 15 minutes with the lid off. I finally decided to strain off all the liquid and blend with 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon,  and about 1/2 cup reserved liquid. This provided a very smooth applesauce like my family enjoys.

This recipe is 100% perfect. The first time I made it, I doubled the recipe and made it in a pot, and it turned out very well. The second time I added a cinnamon stick (as well as the ground cinnamon), and pressure cooked it for about 6 minutes (8 apples), and that turned out very good as well. I'm making it, once again, but this time with 16 apples. An automagic peeler/corer is so cool, and makes peeling mass amounts of apples a breeze. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who likes applesauce :)

I was making a large amount of applesauce and wanted exact quantities rather than my usual just add until it feels right. This fitted perfectly and the addition of cinnamon was good as it's not something I've done before. I will be using this recipe in the future. Thanks.

Yum!  I didn't use any sugar because I was making this for my infant daughter, and it was still pretty sweet. (I used Macintosh apples)  I sprinkled some cinnamon on it for my husband and me and we both thought it was great!  My baby loved it, even without any sugar or cinnamon! :)

SOOOOO good!  I used half the sugar per others suggestions, but actually ended up adding Splenda in in the end... next time I'll follow the recipe exactly, as I guess I like my applesauce a little sweeter.  Thanks for sharing!

I use splenda instead and add a splash of fresh lemon juice as well.  I add ground flax to it once it is cooked (for my diet) and you can't tell.  I also use my hand blender to mash the apple up once it is done and it couldn't be easier.

Yum Yum! I never thought homeade applesauce could be so easy and FAST. Very DIET friendly, no fattening cream or whole milk.

It may not be the recipe's fault.. maybe this IS what homemade applesauce is supposed to taste like.
But we didn't like it at all, it was bland and way too watery after 15 minutes of simmering. I also had to run it through the blender to smooth it out because, though the apple bits were tender, I prefer creamier textures.

I got spoiled on the homemade applesauce that my grandma would always make. Hers seemed to take a lot longer to do so this one is great to have for making it any night of the week.  My whole family enjoyed it and so did my husband who always said he hated applesauce.  I made mine a little chunkier (this way you can heat up the left overs and serve it over icecream).  For a change you can also add a few red hots.  It turns pink and has an extra cinnamon kick.

Delicious!!  I used splenda in place of the sugar, and ended up using a bit of corn starch (1 T cornstarch/1 T water) to thicken the apples & sauce after cooking.  I mashed them gently with a potato masher right in the pot and served the chunky apples warm.  My daughter even took the left-over 1/2 cup to school the next day for a snack!  Thanks for sharing!

This applesauce is very, very good. My mom always made homemade applesauce whenever we would have pork chops, and this recipe is as good as hers. I had to drain ours after it was finished cooking - had a bit too much liquid in it, and I added a couple of  extra shakes of cinnamon. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. We loved it!

I have to agree, it's excellent! I left the peels on for added fiber, and cooked them about 35 mins or so.  After letting them cool for a little while, I put them in my blender until I got the consistency I wanted.  Thanks!

Excellent! Accidentally doubled the sugar—a little too sweet and STILL fine. Worth cooking regularly as potpourri you eat. Thanks!

Wodnerful recipe!  I used 5 granny smiths and one red delicious and added only 1/8 cup of sugar.  My husband said it was like eating not-too-sweet apple pie for dinner.  He took the leftovers for lunch!

This is a simply wonderful recipe!  I added a dash of nutmeg and drained a bit of the juice off, I used a little in my stuffing for our turkey and it was awesome. I substituted splenda baking sugar(1/2 sugar-1/2 splenda) for the sugar.

My question is this--why do people bother buying jarred applesauce when you can make this easy and delicious recipe!  YUMMY!  We pour it warm over ice cream!  This is easy and excellent--my 11 year old son makes this for us all the time!  How about that?

DELICIOUS!!! This tastes so much better than any applesauce I've ever had! I can't remember what kind of apples I used, but I added a little bit more of the other ingredients. So good, especially warm!

I've made this a few times.  The 1st time I followed directions exaxtly.  The 2nd time I added 3 additional apples.  The 3rd time I winged it.  Very good, SIMPLE and adaptable to your taste.  Freezes well.

Loved this recipe-- I cut  the sugar down a bit and added a little honey, with splash of apple cider vinegar. I recommend using a food processor to give it the smooth texture. I use it in place of eggs in recipes allll the time!

The best applesauce recipe ever! I use Granny Smith apples for a little of that tart taste! I have a daughter that is a vegan, so I substitute agave for the sugar so that she can eat it! Can't tell the difference......still out of this world!

I don't have a sweet tooth, and I try to avoid sugar as much as possible, so I made a few alterations - I used 5 smallish apples, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 3/4 cup of water. I didn't add any sugar. After boiling the ingredients I blended them all in my food processor. Delicious and ridiculously simple!

So easy and tasty!  I used 2 Granny Smiths and 2 Red Delicious that I had on hand and needed to use.  For me, there was a little bit too much liquid and I had to drain some out at the end, so next time I'll cut back on the water.  Since I'm avoiding extra sugar in my diet and because of my own desired level of sweetness, I used 3 packets of Splenda instead of the sugar.  SO much better than store-bought!  I'll never eat apple sauce out of a jar again!

Didn't know it was so easy! My 3 year old loves applesauce so I looked it up. This was an amazing recipe! I used honey, instead of sugar but that's the only tweek. It tastes awesome! Suggestion tho, if u do use honey, don't use the 1/4 cup only use 1/8 because honey is sweeter! Love the recipe, thanks so much!

This is such a good, easy recipe to begin with. I sub some honey & agave instead of sugar and added some lemon juice too. Easy breezy and just right for everyone to add their own twist. Always a good idea to not buy processed food when it is this easy to make yourself. Your family will really enjoy what you do for them right at home.

I had leftover apples from stockings so I made one batch with one change. When I cut the apples I left the skin on them - they are the most nutrient-packed part of the apple. The skin becomes so soft they just mold right into the applesauce. Just like the skin of a potato, the skin of an apple is the best part - good for your lungs and brain - preventing cancer and controlling weight. Rethink peeling your apples folks. I also used one less tablespoon of sugar and they were plenty sweet. The sweetness will depend on what kind of apples you use.

Every winter we get a big bag of apples through a fundraiser, and last year I followed this recipe exactly. This is a pretty good recipe to start with, but I agree with the others that it needed less water and sugar than called for (hence one star off). But I think that is partly preference and partly the kind and/or size of apples you use, so some might find this recipe okay as is. Play around with it a bit. 

This year I cut up extra apples (4 medium ones and 2 very small ones), which was about 920g once it was peeled and chopped into 1-2 cm cubes. Since I added extra apple, I kept the water the same (3/4 cup) but still halved the sugar (about 2 Tbsp), intending to add more sugar later after I taste tested it. In the end it didn't need any more sugar since my apples were plenty sweet to begin with. I also don't like a ton of cinnamon in my applesauce, so instead of 1/2 tsp as written (like I did last year), this year I just put in a couple of dashes, which was just right for my taste. 

I cooked it covered on medium heat for about 15 min or a little more, stirring every five min or so. And since I like my applesauce without chunks, I pureed it with an immersion blender. (I pureed it while it was still hot so I could taste test and add sugar if needed, and let it cool after I was done meddling with it.) 

It produced about 3 cups of applesauce.

Omigosh it's superb! This is way faster than running to the store any time the kids have a hankering for the stuff. Can't wait to try new variations using other fruits and spices in the future!

I made this for myself last night because we had some leftover apples from the holidays. OH MY GOODNESS! I am not an apple sauce lover, well not until now. THIS recipe is SO good. Makes the most delicious apple sauce. I suggest to not mash all the way, leave some apple chunks for added flavor and texture. 5 stars.

I found this a couple years ago and we have loved it every time! My kids can barely wait for it to cool down enough to eat it! I always triple the recipe and put it in the crockpot on high for 3-4 hours. Perfect every time!

Great recipe!! The apples I used were a bit on the sweet side to start with so I did use a little less sugar then noted. It seemed a little watery and hard to mush up by hand so I threw it in the blender. It came out perfect!!! My picky little girls that won't eat store bought applesauce LOVED it!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I made a double batch using 8 large McIntosh apples but reduced the water. I only used 1 cup not 1.5 if doing double.  I ended up straining off 1/2 a cup of water before mashing my apples. It would have been way too runny!! I also added extra cinnamon and used 2 tablespoons of sugar in the raw in place of the white sugar.  Only cooked for 15 mins and the apples were plenty tender! Very tasty. Sorry I tend to modify recipes on this site according to other reviews.

I substituted brown sugar and simmered on the stovetop for an hour.  I doubled the recipe but used a bit less brown sugar--about 3/8 of a cup instead of 1/2.  It was delicious!!!!

First time making applesauce and this is a simple and delicious recipe. I put is my blender instead of hand mashing so the consistency is very smooth. May try hand mashing next time but it make it quick and easy. Can't stop eating this stuff, my family loves it too!

Since we had a TON of apples from the orchard, we decided to make applesauce and lots of it! We used this recipe as a starting point. Since we wanted to make it as health as possible, we decided to only add half the amount of sugar called and it's still super sweet! We also ended up having to cook for a lot longer than called because there was too much water in it. We ran it through a blender at the very end to make it a little smoother. It tastes wonderful with our few modifications.

This is the recipe that I use every time I make my applesauce.  I use 20 granny smith apples. I boil it on the stove and it's done in no time at all. I love using granny smith apples because they become just the right amount of sweetness, and taste better than other apples I have used. I share my apple sauce with everyone so it goes very quickly. :)

Made this applesauce with my son. Substituted apple juice for the water but kept the rest of the recipe the same. Used Macintosh apples and it came out delicious! Will definitely make it again on a larger scale.

With my changes I give it 5 stars. I used 11 Gala apples, 1.5 cups of water, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon cooked it longer too, on low heat. After mashing with my potato masher, my immersion blender worked like a charm to bring it to just the right consistency.

Loved the applesauce. Made it twice this week. Love that I can make it chunky and have apple pieces in it.   Very easy to make, in short amount of time.  Will never buy applesauce again.

So easy and so good!  I reduced the sugar because I used sweet Gala apples.  I thought at first there was too much water, but once I mashed them, it was fine.  First time making homemade applesauce and really enjoyed this. Thanks!

Made this tonight with organic Fuji Apples and used a teaspoon of sugar and several dashes of cinnamon.  I used a immersible mixer to mash while still hot.  This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing! Who'd ever think it was as easy as making mash potatoes?

Easy, easy, easy! Great for beginners...or to toy around with. I've changed the sugar for honey, done without cinnamon, or unsweetened. I've added strawberries, blueberries, mangoes, peaches...you name it! The kids LOVE this recipe. If you take out the cinnamon, it makes great applesauce for applesauce bread, btw. ;)

Very easy and delicious recipe. Only thing I would change the next which there will be a next time, would be the sugar. It was a little sweet for me. Although I know it would depend on different apples I use too. Good way to use the apples and have a fresh side dish of fruit. Although maybe I'll use splenda to try to make it next time see if it's not as sweet for me. This will be used a lot for my side dishes.

Great recipe. My son was sick so I wanted to make him some apple sauce. I used apple juice in place of the water, brown sugar, and apple pie spice mix. Turned out excellent.

I used granny smith apples, cut into fourths and peeled, boiled everything together as suggested for about 15 minutes on high and then poured directly into the blender to smoothly chop. Worked out great!

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it.  The first time I made it I just mashed with a fork but my son who doesn't like chunky applesauce didn't care for it. The second time I made it I just threw it in the magic bullet to get rid of the chunks and it was perfect.  Both times though I didn't use nearly as much sugar (personal preference)  I doubled the recipe and only used like 1-2 tablespoons sugar and that was plenty!  Very yummy and will continue to make this recipe!

Apparently, Gravenstein apples are the best for sauce so thats what I purchased.

Easy, quick, and tasted better than any store bought sauce!

Excellent applesauce, but the recipe calls for way too much sugar - I used about 3/4 of what it calls for and it was still too much.  also, it could probably do with a little less water too.  That being said, my five-year-old LOVED it!

Loved the simplicity of this recipe. Adjust the sugar to your taste, however I made this and am rating this based on the recipe as written. Sometimes the simplest things are the best. Everyone I served this to loved it!

Really tasty and super easy recipe! I used 6 apples of various types, and used 1/4 cup and 1 Tbpsn (instead of 1/4 cup and 2 Tbspn called for) to cut down on sugar a bit. Still came out really sweet - next time I might do just under 1/4 cup. Used less cinnamon so that would be more of a background flavor, and threw in a few sprinkles of ground cloves. Came out sweet and flavorful, smells like pie filling. I kind of want to eat all of it immediately.

Simple and delicious!  Who could ask for more? I made exactly as written the first time.  The second time I used grated a little nutmeg over the cooked apples instead of using cinnamon as I prefer it.
I have made this a couple of times now and will make over and over!

So fresh and tasty. After reading some of the reviews, I cut back just a tad on the water and sugar - I love how this came out. I see why you need the water. During the cooling process, the water sort of becomes a syrup - and soaks back into the apples. Will be awesome with my porkchops today.
Used 2 figi and 2 granny smiths. I won't be buying the jarred stuff anymore - thanks alot for posting this.

This applesauce was delicious. I used honeycrisp and gala apples (7 in total).  I omitted the sugar and increased the water to 1 cup.  I cooked in a slow cooker for 4  hours on high.  It came out wonderful with just the right sweetness.

Great applesauce!  I only gave it three stars, because I feel if I would have used all the sugar it called for it would have been way too sweet; same goes for the water.  Maybe if they were Granny Smith you would need all the water and sugar.  I guess it would just depend on the apples you use and how sweet and juicy they are. 

-10 red delicious apples
-1/4 c sugar
-1 c water
-1 tsp cinnamon

I have been making home-made applesauce for years, both on the stove and in the slow cooker, and I thought I'd share my method.  First of all, the type of apple is very important.  I like to use a mix but they should be sweet apples - Golden Delicious, Gala, etc.  DO NOT USE GRANNY SMITH FOR APPLESAUCE!  No sugar is necessary if you use the right apples.  Don't peel them because the peel has wonderful nutrients - just cut them into chunks.  Next a put a bit of water at the bottom of the pan or crock.  Cook on low in the crock until mushy or on the stove at medium, lid on the pan set askew to let off some steam.  Shake pan from time to time.  Don't let them burn because burnt fruit tastes terrible!  When they are done run them through the food mill - it will take off the skins - and add water, if necessary, for desired consistency.  If you used red apples the sauce will be a pretty pink.  I like to make a whole bunch of applesauce and freeze it in batches - applesauce freezes beautifully!  Good luck!

This recipe can be made even simpler, and healthier--it's plenty sweet without adding any sugar, and you can get away with not even peeling the apples as long as you chop them in fairly small pieces and cook long enough that the skin is soft (unless you have people eating who are very picky about texture). I used 8 small-med. apples and 3/4 cup water was still fine.

This was a super easy recipe for the 4 apples I had. I actually used 1/4 cup orange juice (from a fresh orange) and instead of the sugar I added a half cup of dried cranberries (sweetened).  Turned out amazing. Thank you!

This applesauce turned out perfect but after reading some reviews i did make some adjustments to it. I doubled the apples (4 Jonagold & 4 Honeycrisp), used 1 TBSP each of brown sugar and white sugar and 1 full tsp of cinnamon. I kept the water the same and cooked it 15 minutes covered, then 15 minutes uncovered. It had just the right amount of everything and was super easy to make.

I used a 3 pound bag of Fuji apples and oh man, was this every good! After reading reviews I cut the sugar in half and used 3-4 tablespoons of water. I was worried I would burn the apples with such a small amount of water. As soon as it came to a boil, I removed it from the burner until my electric stove cooled down a bit. I put it back on the burner and just let it do it's thing. I thought I would do more harm taking the lid on and off. I like mine chunky so I barely mashed them with a potato masher. So unbelievably good, I am tempted to buy an apple peeler to make the job easier. The only problem is, when something is this good, it's easy to stuff your face.

This was my first attempt at homemade. Just as the other said, simply great. We are used to no sugar applesauce to begin with, so omitted the sugar. Used my immersion blender to mix.  Won't ever buy store bought again.

Gave this recipe 3 stars because I only used it as a guideline. I used 5 apples (2 Fuji 2 gala and 1 red delicious) 1/3 cup water and no sugar and it was so sweet and delicious! Adding sugar would have been completely unnecessary. And I think 3/4 cup of water would have been too watery.

I, too, used my trusty crock pot to make this. I actually used 5# of apples (from a pick them yourself orchard) and used a mix of Granny Smith's, Pink Ladies and old-fashioned Winesaps. Since the Granny Smith's and the Winesaps are pretty tart, I went ahead and used a 'heavy' cupful of sugar. I also used the juice and zest of one lemon, plus about 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I ALSO add a scant tsp of sea salt. It is important for flavor. The lemon doesn't make it more tart but just rounds out the flavor. I also only used about 1/2 cup of water, as it doesn't boil away in a crock pot. It cooked all afternoon. My kitchen smelled like apple pie the entire time. They cooked down perfectly after about 5 hours, no mashing needed. I froze about 3/4 of this batch in 3 smaller containers. I am going to make another batch very soon, using only Pink Ladies and Winesaps...and I am going to add cinnamon red-hots to this batch for an autumn holiday treat. (I'll cut back on the sugar and won't be using any ground cinnamon. I've done this before and ALL the kids love it. Just don't get carried away in the amount of red-hots you add. They call them that for a reason! I will add about 1/2 TBSP of red-hots per pound of apples. I'll taste it about halfway through, and add more if needed. I will still use the lemon and zest. (We go through a LOT of applesauce, so while the apple season lasts I will probably end up making at LEAST a dozen batches of this size, most to be frozen for the year.

Great recipe, but WAY too sweet.  I cut the sugar in half and used just 2 shakes of cinnamon and it was much better.  I used half pears and half braeburns the first time and all McIntosh the second time.

This is such a simple recipe, and that's why I like it more than the others.  Because I usually have applesauce with some form of bread - I cut down the sugar to half.  If you want thicker applesauce then cut down on the water, if you want it runny add more.

Awesome recipe!  I made this for the first time a couple of months ago, when my husband started getting sick and dehydrated from the vomiting.  The doctor recommended a BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce (!), and toast), and my husband, who is a meat person, wasn't looking forward to it.  I made this recipe, hoping it would lift his spirits.  I added extra cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger, to help with his stomach.  He raved about it and felt better almost instantly!  I'm making it again this morning because my husband and son both are feeling under the weather--this time doubling the recipe and using 11 small Red Delicious apples!  Thanks so much!

I needed applesauce for a recipe I just couldn't wait to make but didn't have any on hand.  So I found this and used empire apples because that was all we had.  I don't know if that is the reason why but I could not mash this even after letting it cook for 25 min.  No worries though, I put it in my ninja (blender) and thought it would be watery but really liked the consistency.

Love this recipe!! So incredibly simple and very yummy. Definitely an improvement on store-bought applesauce. There is no need to add the sugar, as the natural sweetness of the apples is plenty. Will be using this recipe a lot!! Thanks for sharing:)

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and put it in my slow cooker, ad after 3 hours, it only took three mixes from my spoon for it to resemble apple sauce. I omitted the sugar, because I don't think it's necessary, and it was perfect! I've always hated buying applesauce, and this is a perfect and more delicious option!

This was my first time ever making homemade applesauce, and I was shocked at how easy it was! I used honey crisp apples, and they tasted just great! It was a very sweet & cinnamony applesauce & filled the kitchen with the best fragrance! Will do again for sure! :-)

Wonderful, tasty, and most importantly, easy to make! Forget store bought applesauce, I'll be making this from now on! I added a tiny bit of nutmeg, which seems to compliment the cinnamon flavor very nicely. (didn't measure, just added a few shakes.) Even my husband, who rarely eats applesauce, loves this applesauce. We went apple picking this week, and picked 10 pounds of apples. I have made 1 apple pie. The rest has been turned into several batches of applesauce because we enjoyed this recipe so much!

I doubled the amount of apples, the water-maybe 1 cup I think I used. I did use a variety of fresh picked apples and they did not need any sugar. A dash of All Spice and 1 tsp of Cinnamon, because my dash turned into a oops! The house smells wonderful and our taste buds are happy!

This is DELICIOUS!! I only gave it four stars because, even with adding 6 medium apples as opposed to the 4 the recipe called for, it was still really runny. I thought maybe it would thicken up when it cooled, but that did not happen. My second batch is in the slow cooker now and this time I'm using 8 apples and only just over a 1/2 cup of water. Also reducing the amount of cinnamon for my picky, but perfect husband! ;0)

This recipe is great! This was my first time making applesauce and it turned out much better than I anticipated. Will be making it again for sure, and will most likely be doubling, or even tripling the recipe because it was so yummy!

Sooo simple I never knew! Very very yummy. I added a lot more cinnamon since I love it but turned out tangy and rich and sweet!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!! Even my picky husband liked it. The texture of the sauce was perfect, not at all thin or runny. i would recommend this recipe to everyone.

Nice guideline recipe, but I found the ratio of apples to liquid way too high as well as sugar. I think it just depends how juicy your apples are and how sweet (I used gravensteins). The sauce was far too watery after cooking covered for the suggested time and had to cook it an extra half hour uncovered to try and reduce it. I ended up adding about 20 more apples to get the consistency right. Also, way too much sugar in this recipe. Taste your apples. Most apples are sweet enough to where you don't need to add so much sugar, if any at all. I cut back the sugar by 1 cup and it was still too much. Applesauce should taste like apples, not sugar. Thankfully adding more apples to fix the consistency also fixed that. I do suggest adding some fresh lemon juice. It really helps perk the flavor.

I would give this 5 stars, but I didn't add any sugar and used apples from our apple tree (smaller, so I used more) and it turned out great! I don't think this recipe needs any sugar at all, especially if you are making it to feed to children or use in baking!

Whoa there Sarah, I love sugar but I halved the sugar content and still had super sweet applesauce. I was using Honey Sweet Apples (I think) from a tree in our yard so perhaps that had something to do with it. : )

With 3 Pink Lady Apples, 1/2 TBSP of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of water and no added sugar, it turned out perfectly.  I only cooked it for 10 minutes, covered.

WAAAAAAAAAY too much water, no sugar needed, and I didn't even peel mine. I used Red Delicious Organic Apples, and I only made enough for myself. I ended up having to DRAIN my water out, and I didn't even follow the recipe. Next time, I will only add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan.

Loved this!  My 2-year old has been on an applesauce kick, so I decided to make homemade.  He wouldn't touch it, butmy husband and I loved it!  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Simple too.

Easy, fast, and tasty. I loved it, though my kids didn't like it. I think it must have been the cinnamon. Next time I might leave it out for them. I also might add a little lemon juice. I used the Splenda sugar blend for the sugar (only requires 2T).

Good simple Recipe To make it easier, since I'm with the lady with 30+ lbs. I just quarter or use my corer and put them in my food processor then put them to cook as directed with water, sugar and cinnamon plus some allspice, just like apple pie in a jar.

Great recipe, but you don't need the sugar, try using apple cider for the liquid and cook your apples in the microwave for about 3-4 minutes. I used Orange Pippin apples this time but I love the Cortland, Macintosh and Mutsu apples mixed or alone for flavor. I use my immersion blender to "mash" the sauce...truly wonderful kitchen tool!

Had some extra Rome Beauty apples, so I wanted to try to use them in an easy recipe that I have never tried before.  Found this recipe and tried it.  Yummy!  I never thought about trying to make my own apple sauce.  I will never buy store bought again!  I made two batches.  The original was very good.  I like mine sort of chunky, so I was please to have that texture instead of the very fine grain texture of store bought.  The second batch, I added some brown sugar and it was just as good, but just added a different flavor.  If you like apple sauce, try this!  You can adjust this very easily to your taste.  My family has gobbled this up with 24 hours of making it.

I also added a little nutmeg. When it was done I put it right into the blender since my kids don't like it "chunky". It came out perfect!!

I made this for breakfast this morning, and while we were eating my son said, "Too bad applesauce doesn't taste like this."  I said, "but this IS applesauce."  He repled, "No, regular applesauce from the store."  I then got the chance to explain to him that everything homemade is SO much better than store-bought.

My kind of recipe!! Quick, easy and great!  I've only attempted to make applesauce one other time and it was very runny, too sweet and disappointing.  This was a great reintroduction and I will make this recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

I used more apples and more cinnamon but about the same  amount of sugar.  My apples were pretty sweet so I think you probably need to adjust depending on the type of apple.  My Honeycrisps were pretty sweet.  I used some seconds and made and canned another batch that I ddn't put any sugar in.  I like the chunkier style you get when you make your own

Overall a very good and easy recipe!  I followed exact except I used 5 apples (they were small).  The texture and taste was good, but a bit on the sweet side.  I used macs, so next time I may keep the sugar the same and use Granny Smiths, or use macs but cut down on the sugar.

This is a simple, yet amazing recipe! I used a combination of Gala and Granny Smith apples for a sweet and tart effect. I will never buy Mott's again. LOL

Loved this! My four year old smashed the apples for me. This was soo good. I too used four packs of splenda instead of sugar. It was perfect and my hubby said no more store bought. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  And so easy--peeling and chopping the apples are the hardest part.  I used my slow cooker for this and cooked on high for 4 hours.  Since I was using the crockpot, I used less water.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of water instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Although I was worried it wouldn't work, by the end of the 4 hours the apples were soft and easy to mash up.  I love the flavor in this.  This is just personal taste, but I'd prefer a bit less sugar, so I'd do that next time.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent, thank you.  I made this with granny smith apples and left the skin on.  We used it for topping on pork chops.  Too bad there almost wasn't enough for my hubby cause I kept eating it while the pork chops were cooking. Yummie!

I LOVE cinnamon so I added about triple the amount of cinnamon. I also only used 1/8 cup of sugar. This is very good! I will defenitly make this many times again. I think I will take the sugar out completely because it was still a little too sweet for me.

I made this yesterday and it is delicious. I used 8 apples, 2 granny smith, 4 rome and 2 empire. I peeled and sliced them up, put them in my crockpot with 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup sugar with the cinnamon. It was ready in 4 hours. I will definately make this again.

I love this! The only applesauce I've eaten is the stuff in McDonald's apple pie... My apples seemed small so I used 5 of them, but I stuck to the amount of water and sugar stated. At the end of 15min it seemed too watery (not quite sure what I was looking out for though), so i let it boil uncovered for 5min more. I couldn't wait so i just mashed it while hot. Delicious :)

This was really very good. A bit to sweet for me, but....thats my own taste, I'm the person who drinks bold starbucks coffee..black :) I just seem to have an overactive sweet bud :) but, I made it a second time and cut back on the sugar for my own preferred taste and it was so yummy, this would be great even over ice cream!

Very good.  I've probably made this ten times so far.  I use less water, and sugar.  If the apples are ripe and sweet, I add just a tablespoon or two of sugar.  If they aren't particularly sweet, I add more.  Also, I usually double the recipe.  Thanks for the great homemade applesauce!

I've made this twice this week...once with galas and once with granny smith. I prefer the granny smith personally, but both were delicious. I used slightly less water...just so the apples were not quite covered. So good with Potato Latkes I from this site.

This is so wonderfully delicious! I substituted Splenda for the sugar and you could not tell at all. This is such an easy, tasty way to get such a healthy treat in your diet. It tastes just like baked apples when it is hot, but this is wonderful hot or cold. I will never buy applesauce again!

This was so good. I used Splenda granulated surar instead and it turned out perfect.

Great way to keep apples from rotting in the fruit bowl. The first time I made it, it was too sweet. Now I leave out the sugar altogether (the apples are sweet all on their own) and double the apples for an amount that will last a while.

Oh my, I didn't know how much of a difference it would make, making applesauce homemade. I wanted something special to serve to my in-laws along with the "Stuffed Kielbasa" also from All Recipes. I loved it and so did everyone else and it was so easy. I made it a day ahead of time in my slow cooker on high for almost 4 hours and then mashed with a potato masher, put it in a pretty bowl with a lid and put in the fridge, and served the next day. So yummy! Good impression on my mother-in-law who always serves fried apples with sausage and sauerkraut.

I too, made this in my crockpot.  What a great recipe, and I had rave reviews from my family. I used three McIntosh Apples, and two Fuji Apples.  I did not use all the sugar, did some taste testing and ended up using about 3 TBSPs.  I did use 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Excellent and EASY! Thanks!

I put these ingredients in a slow-cooker and 3-4 hours later had the most delicous applesauce ever. So simple. So delicious. Perfect.

I made this today for my 8 month old daughter and she absolutly loved it. After every bit she would smile and yell ( when she yells she wants more and your not feeding her fast enough) or say mmmmm. I have a feeling I will be making this often. My 8 year old is at school and hasn't had any yet but I know she is going to love it and want to help make it next time.

I had a bunch of golden delicious apples that I had to use up in the fridge before they went bad.      I doubled up the recipe and used 8 apples.  I didn't adjust the recipe at all and it was awesome!      Instead of a fork or potato masher, I used my handy electric stick blender....worked so quickly! :)  I didn't even wait for it to cool down.  I gave some to my 4 year old daughter and she is wanting seconds.      Thanks, Sarah! :)

Very good ! I used 6 apples, 1/4 cup of sugar, and just over a 1/2 tsp of cin. I agree that the different kinds of apples will cause the sugar to vary. I will make it again.

This was delicious!  I cooked it in my slow cooker for 3-4 hours and used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Next time I'm going to double (or triple) the recipe because it was gone in 5 minutes!

Since I make mine in the microwave...simply cut the apples(McIntosh, Rome, Jonathan) without peeling and when cool and soft, I put them through a food press.  Simpler than this one,  Just as tasty and healthier since no sugar is added and the vitamins from the peel are still intact.  I don't understand why one needs to add sugar!  I can't review this that highly since making it in the microwave, not adding any extra sugar and leaving the peel is simpler and healthier.  I'm sure this might compare well with a store bought applesauce that has sugar added.

Not bad but too sweet for my family's taste.  We use local apples from the farm market and they are sweet on their own.  I just throw them in a crock pot with a bit of water and cook them until they are easy to mash (about 3 hours on high).

I used sweeter apples and will cut the sugar down next time. Everything else was perfect. I thought the color was dark so I'm not sure if I cooked them too long or what. The boiled for about 15 minutes. FYI: 4 apples yields 1C of applesauce.

wonderful! I followed the exact recipe and I wouldnt change a thing.  Use golden delicious for a little more chunk in your sauce, or macintosh for a more mushy sauce.  I prefer golden delicious and small chunks in my applesauce so that is what I use.  My whole family raved over this.  Perfect served with porkchops and mac and cheese!!

It was definitely easy and good, but much too sweet for my liking. It tasted like apple pie filling...not that there's anything wrong with that! But for a healthy snack for me and my kids, I'm going to make it again with half the sugar. This would be good on ice cream! I made it in the crockpot...on high for about 4 hours. The aroma permeated the house and drove the kids nuts all afternoon!

Ok I'm changing my review based off of trying both stovetop and slow cooker.  I stand corrected on the stovetop, I even did some research into the Joy of Baking book, the mother of all cookbooks and even it says anything above simmer is too harsh for applesauce.  The stovetop on medium didnt provide super soft apples and browned them a bit on the bottom.  It seemed more like a rush job.  The slow cooker on high for about 2.5 hours instead provided an incredibly soft and beautiful consistency to the applesauce. Using a potato masher, it was a breeze to turn into applesauce.  Also, I halved the sugar and left out the cinnamon.  It tastes way better and more natural that way.  I noticed the applesauces are more dark than storebought but then my husband reminded me that apples turn darker when exposed to air.  Adding anything acid to it to prevent the discoloring, I think, would change the flavor too much.  If you do prefer the stovetop, I'd recommend putting on simmer and triple the time to cook.  It will be so much better!  This is a good recipe, its WAY tastier than storebought.  Also, I was thinking, if you skip the sugar and cinn, this recipe would be perfect for babies starting on solids, just put through a blender before serving :).

Five stars for being a quick and tasty alternative to store-bought applesauce. Just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. My son really liked it!

As I needed some applesauce to substitute vegetable oil for my “Carrot Cake III” recipe, made this last nite per recipe; except reduced sugar to 2 tbsp as I used combination of 2 Royal Galas and 2 Granny Smiths. Upon tasting the remaining cooled applesauce in the pot, both hubby and I agreed that this is indeed... VERY AWESOME! A keeper in the house and I will not buy bottle applesauce anymore!!

Great recipe! Thanks. I joined a produce co-op and sometimes we get a lot of apples. This week we got Granny Smith apples. We arent big fans of tart apples. I used them in this recipe and added an additional 1/4 cup of brown sugar and cooked it in the crock pot as others suggested. It was really good!

I used 5 gala apples and only 1/8 cup of sugar. It smells so good while cooking it drew my husband and sons out to the kitchen to find out what I was making.  It was delicious! Better than any store-bought applesauce and so easy to make.

Fantastic! I made this as a side for Easter dinner, and everyone raved over it. I doubled the amount of apples (served 6 adults with a little left over), and tripled the amount of cinnamon (personal preference). Everything else, I left the same. I wanted to try brown sugar instead of white, but wound up being out of that ingredient. White sugar worked out fine.

The best applesauce I have ever had.  Period.  And my family loved it!  I used a couple different kinds of apples (not sure which they were, I'm not too good with apples) and I'm going to make it again with some other varieties, just to see if it changes the flavor.  Best applesauce ever!...and good for those of us on a budget!

This applesauce is really good!  I used two Red Delicious apples and two Granny Smith apples and followed the recipe exactly, except I had to let them cook a bit longer because the Granny Smith apples weren't soft enough at 20 minutes.

Really easy to make, quick and simple. We sometimes mash the apples if we don't feel like chunky that day. I use this recipe in apple oatmeal muffins.

This got rave reviews all around.  I was looking for a way to use up some red delicious apples when I stumbled upon this recipe.  I used three red delicious and two gala apples (mine were small apples, so I used one more than the recipe called for).  Since I used a sweeter apple, I cut the sugar down the aprox and 1/8 of a cup.  I used an immersion blender instead of a fork/potato masher to save a little time.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

I've already disliked store bought applesauce, even as a child, but I 'went out on a limb' and tried this recipe and ... wow! I'm officialy a 'sarah's applesauce' addict! I try using a mixture of apples and begin with half the sugar called for and add to taste.

I never knew homemade applesauce was so easy!!  This was great!  I wanted to find an applesauce recipe to make for Thanksgiving like my grandmother used to make, so I thought I better try it before Thanksgiving, just in case.  I used my apple/peeler/corer/slicer for the apples, and they were the perfect size.  I doubled the recipe, and per others reviews, added less water and sugar, and then put it in the crockpot on low for 3 hours.  It was delicious!  A definite keeper for our household and a new Thanksgiving tradition!  Thank you very much to everyone!

This was a good recipe, though next time I will definitely cut back on the amount of sugar.  Once the applesauce cooled, the remaining liquid was almost syrup.

I had some pears that someone gave us from their backyard and decided to use them instead of apples.  I left out the sugar since they are sweet.  This is delicious!  I peeled the pears and then used my apple peeler/slicer/corer to slice and core them.  Then I chopped them a bit more.  So easy.  I can't wait to try this with apples, too!  My kids and daycare kids all eat unsweetened applesauce, so I will probably leave the sugar out of that, too.  
**I just made this again yesterday with Gala apples and NO sugar and it is wonderful. And I made some with one apple, 3 TBSP water and some cinnamon sprinkled on top in my Pampered Chef micro-steamer in the microwave.  I cooked about 7 min at 50% power and then mashed it up.  This is plenty sweet without any sugar!

Awesome!!!!! I don't even really like applesauce but I have tons of apples from the tree outback so I made this recipe.  I used 1 extra apple because they weren't that big.  Cooked a bit longer to get rid of the water & it is perfect.  Thanks

This recipe is fantastic. It's better warm than cold, but it's good nonetheless. I've made it twice in one week because both my husband and I can't get enough. I do cook it longer than the recipes suggests to make sure the apples are tender (about an hour). Terrific recipe!

Forget the jar applesauce from the grocery store. This is awesome! I took others' suggestions and simmered all the ingredients for 45 minutes. The ingredient amounts were perfect. I used a variety of 4 apples (gala and macintosh) and the sweetness was perfect. I want to experiment with this recipe though and try substituting the sugar for honey and pure maple syrup. My Canadian husband only likes the 100% pure maple syrup. I want to play around with it to come up with a perfect combination of honey and/or maple sugar rather than the white sugar. Thanks for a perfect recipe though that I can play around with to make it my own. It's great as is though...just offering some suggestions. Thanks!

Of all the recipes I've tried on here, this is the first one that I am reviewing because it is one of my family's favorites!! All the kids, from my 11 year old who isn't very fond of apple anything to my toddler who is a very picky eater - everyone in the family agrees that this is the best applesauce ever. I serve it as a dessert since it's so sweet with no complaints at all and never any leftovers!! :-)

Delicious recipe.  I omitted the cinnamon, and doubled the recipe.  My family raved over it!  I don't think they'll eat any other type of applesauce ever again.

Sarah, thank you for sharing.

Oh yum!  My favorite recipes are ones that taste delicious, are easy to make and don't require hard-to-find ingredients.  Check, check and check PLUS this one makes the kitchen smell fabulous (as another reviewer   said - better than any candle).  I used Cortland apples and it was great.  Can't wait to try other varieties. Thanks PHATCAT for sharing this with us!

I add some vanilla to the recipe and take a little bit of the sugar away.  It is fantastic.  I personally don't like applesauce, was making this for the kids, and even I loved it!  I used my magic bullet to make it smooth.  I now have an excellent baby food also.  Thanks!

This was a super simple recipe, my 7 year old did most the work.  We added just a little flour near the end to thicken it up, and ended up leaving the apples in pieces instead of smashing them.  Went awesome with our dinner tonight!  Thanks!

Easy to follow, easy to make. I found the sugar to be just right when there is 1 tablespoon of lemon juice added to the mix.

I make this recipe over and over.  It doesn't seem to matter what kind of apples I use, or whether I use white sugar or Splenda, it's always great.  This is my go-to recipe when I need a little something extra to serve with dinner and don't have a lot of time.

Delicious & easy !  I used Splenda instead of sugar & added a couple dashes of nutmeg & cardomom.  This is a wonderful fall condiment/side.  Delicious paired with ham or pork chops.  I blended half the mixture in a blender & mashed the rest so that the applesauce still had nice chunks of apple.  Lovely garnished with some crushed walnuts.

So easy and extremely tasty.  We used Granny Smith, Braeburn, and "Tree-out-back" varieties.  Also, we have one child allergic to processed sugar.  I used half the amount of honey and a little less water because of the extra liquid the honey adds.  It turned out so tasty and made the house smell wonderful!

My first attempt at applesauce and I had the same problem many people had, it was a little too sweet.  Next time, I think I'll only add a tablespoon or two of brown sugar.  Maybe I'll use a tart apple rather than the sweet apples I used. Also, be careful with your cinnamon, it gets very concentrated after cooking down the apples.  It was still very, very good.

This was really good.  I have no idea what kind of apples I had, but they worked!  :)  I only used 1/2 cup water, and instead of sugar, I used apple juice concentrate, about 1.5 tablespoons.  It was plenty sweet.  I added a little extra cinnamon.  It's very good warm.

I wanted to try this but didn't have all the ingredients; so I went ahead using 3 fragrant pears and 1 apple, which was all I had in the fridge and they were quite overripe too; so I reduced the water a bit due to the juiciness of the fruits. Also instead of sugar I substituted with maple syrup (grade B). I cooked this for about 30 – 35 minutes and it maintained being 'applesauce' but thicker, not so liquid-y; I think I made it sort of between applesauce & apple butter. I adore this, yummy. I used this making my reduced-fat cornbread. Thanks phatcat.

I had to go buy apples just to make this.  Friends were giving it rave reviews.  What's Cooking, girls.  This was as wonderful as they said.  I made it just as the directions said.  I am sure I will make this many times.  Especially since fall is right around the corner.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was very easy to make ...and very good also! I used Granny Smith apples, and added another 1/4 C. of sugar. I was out of cinnamon, so I used several shakes of  cinnamon sugar sprinkle for toast. We put it on top of hot buttered biscuits.

This was wonderful!!! I used a corer/slicer to do the apples & even though I doubled the recipe & had 8 apples to do, it didn't take long at all. I used gala apples & it was a tad sweet...next time I might decrease the sugar. Thanks for making my grandson's night!

This is so simple and yet tastes so good.  I've made it so many times in the last 3 months I've lost count.  I even used it in a carrot cake recipe to replace part of the oil.

My husband got a basket of apples for Christmas, from his work. So I made applesauce with some of the apples, and I dont think I will ever buy applesauce again

This was very good. I didn't peel my apples but I think it would be even better if I had. My apples were tart so I added a spoon of brown sugar and a pinch of nutmeg. Will make this again and have over pancakes.

Excellent!  I followed others advice and halfed the sugar.  My family is raving about it.  I even made a huge batch and canned some for later and as holiday gifts.

This was delicious. I've been itching to make applesauce since June, and I've finally gotten around to making some with the apples from a friend's tree. I used four enormous apples of one kind and one smaller apple of another (though I don't know what type of apples they were) and ended up adding about a cup more water than what was called for. I omitted the sugar because I thought it was sweet enough without it, but then added 3 packets of Splenda to the entire pot. Will definitely make again...it smells and tastes GREAT.

This applesauce was just awesome.  Very easy to make.  The smell of it cooking is wonderful.  I love it warm (heavenly!) and my SO likes it cold - but its excellent both ways!

I love it when something so simple turns out so amazing! I did add a bit of fresh lemon juice, but I don't know that it was necessary.  And I doubled the recipe so I could freeze half.  Excellent!  Kids, hubby, and I all loved it.

This was pretty good.  I had to run it through my food processor because I couldn't get the apples to mash up with just a fork.  I thought it could have been a little sweeter.  Maybe it was just the particular type of apples I used.  Next time I will try to mix them up a bit.

This was very good. I let it cook longer than what it called for (though I didn't time it) because my apples didn't seem to be getting soft and mushy. Great for a treat for the kids.

Last week my 17 month old son had all 4 molars coming in, a cold, and a double ear infection.  The only thing I could get him to eat was this applesauce, slightly warm!  My husband even wanted some. Perfect ratios.

Delicious!  I couldn't wait for it to cool for the applesauce, so I just ate the warm apples.  I buys cooked apples in our local deli, but these were so much better.  And, so easy!  Definite keeper.

A great dessert.  My kids (3yrs and 6 yrs)loved it. Cooking it made the whole kitchen smell delicious.  I think I will double the recipe next time as this made a very small portion for 2 adults and 2 kids.

Great recipe, thank you.  My mother in law gave me a huge ice chest full of apples, and now I know what to do with them.  I made as described expect I may have gone a little overboard with the cinnamon.  It was yummy regardless, thanks. I did not peel the apples and cooked them a little longer with good results.

I substituted apple cider for the water and it turned out delicious. When the apples were soft, I removed the lid from the saucepan and simmered the apples until the liquid was the right consistency. I then put the applesauce in the food processor until it was smooth. Next time, I will omit the cinnamon and just sprinkle it lightly over the applesauce when it is served. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Wonderful recipe Sarah! Im been sick with the stomach flu for the past 4 days and the worst is not over yet! I havent been able to eat anything except Jello until I tried this recipe. As I was making it, my older brother (who is on Atkins) forced me to give him some of the wonderful applesauce.  And It made my kitchen smell delicious! Thankyou much!

I really love this recipe. I did think it had just a tad too much cinnamon and I had to drain off the liquid before mashing them. Other than peeling the apples, this recipe is SIMPLE and I would make it every day!

This applesauce is so good. I read the reviews and cooked mine a little longer, and it was nice and thick and not watery at all. Thanks, Joyln

I am a high school FCS teacher and I used this recipe in my culinary arts class and it was mostly a hit! We had to add a little more water in the beginning (1 1/2 Cups)--my students cooked down fast with 3/4 cup.  I think it was great, but my students wanted to make it more of a commercial applesauce and basically puree it but the flavor was great

I have been making applesauce for years.  You don’t need to add sugar to it. I add cinnamon and a little nutmeg that’s it to taste.     I use it in pancakes delish.   Granny Smith, ida red and Macintosh apples.  It’s better when you mix your apples types . You can also freeze applesauce

I always substitute apple juice or apple cider for the water to get a richer apple taste.  Also, I add the sugar at the end, so I can taste the sauce and decide how much it needs. I usually use Gala apples, but this time I used Melrose and they were also both tasty and tender for mashing.  You can also microwave everything in a covered glass dish for a quicker sauce.  The time will depend on how much you are making, so check every three minutes or so, until the apples are tender.  Finally, try a serving of apple sauce with a drizzle of cream, or even peanut butter sauce (I just warm peanut butter in the microwave and spoon a bit on.  Both are yummy.

I followed the advice of a lot of other reviewers and changed the recipe a bit.  I used 6 apples, half the water and half the sugar in the recipe. I think the amount of water and sugar really depends on the type of apple and how fresh they are. I used Cortland and McIntosh that were picked yesterday (by me), so they still had a lot of water and natural sugar in them. I also cooked them in a slow cooker. It came out great, so I recommend using this recipe as a reference and adjust to your taste.

This was delicious and I will make it again. I may try brown sugar next time. The amount of cinnamon was just right. I cooked it with the lid on for about 15 minutes then removed the lid and cooked it about another 20 minutes to reduce the liquid until it was nice and thick.  My four apples , peeled and chopped, made 4 cups.  When the cooking was done and the applesauce mashed, it had reduced to fill a pint jar ... enough to last me all week. Thanks!

I did not use any sugar as I am fighting cancer and doing so mainly through my diet.  I actually loved the flavor just with the apples and cinnamon but my children preferred a sweeter taste so we added 2 pinches of stevia.

No need to add sugar.  No need at all unless the apples are really tart.  Taste first.

Also, no need to peel and chop apples.  Cook slowly,  cut in 1/2.  Push through sieve or colander to remove the skins and seeds.

Agree with early review that this is a lot of water.  Cook slowly, the apples provide more than enough liquid.

Lovely, how can you go wrong with homemade applesauce from beautiful apples?  I used 4 large Pink Lady apples I had, came to about 2 cups of chopped apples for those who may like to see a measured amount -- I used 2/3 c. water,  a little less than 1/4 c. sugar (don't want it too sweet) and the cinnamon. Tastes yummy, of course. Using for a recipe for apple muffins that call for applesauce.

I increased this recipe by 20 times (80 apples). After simmering the apples for about 20 minutes, I mashed them by putting them through a potato ricer. It worked perfectly. Doing it this way also removed much of the water so I added some back to the mashed apples until I had the desired consistency. The best thing was that I had 2 remaining quarts of apple cider which I canned and is now ready to warm at Christmas time and drink around the fire!

This turned out to be way too sweet. If anything when you make this don't add sugar until the very end(or at least 1/2 the amount) because this turned out disgusting. I will never make an apple sauce recipe with this much sugar ever again. Good thing I made it to put into oat bars...

Outstanding, simple recipe that turns out great every time. I use slightly more sugar, and do half brown and half white, but otherwise don't change a thing. I am cooking some right now with a blorp of pure vanilla, just to try something new. This is my 4th time making this recipe and I will never use another.

This is far too sweet, and really needs no added water as apples let off so much of their own.  I did can this, though, for later use (will be great stirred into plain yogurt, or as a side to pork!!)
Anyway, in my reprised pot of sauce, I added a mere 1 tbsp of water for 6 apples and a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Perfect.

So good. I added a few heaping tablespoons of crushed pineapple. Yummy. The sugar really makes it decadent, but it is also very good without it. My biggest recommendation is to go ahead and double the recipe. You'll be glad you did.

I gave this recipe 5 stars just because its how I have always made mine, however I never added cinnammon. I keep a shaker of cinnammon sugar handy at the table for everyones own use.
My 6 year old requested homemade pancakes for dinner, which we have also gotten of this site. And she loves Applesauce with her pancakes!! My german grandmother used to serve the same thing to me as a young girl..nothing tastes quite as good as homemade..its food made with love!!

I never realized how easy it would be to make my own applesauce!  I seriously don't understand why anyone buys the store bought stuff.  I'm just starting to learn how to cook and I love this.  I only gave it 3 stars because it doesn't suggest which type of apples to use and it doesn't need any sugar.  After reading through the reviews I settled on 4 Granny Smith and 2 red delicious, maybe it's the type of apples I chose why its so good without sugar.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Not much of a cook, I never thought to make applesauce from scratch.  Trying to follow a "clean" eating plan so this fit right in and I couldn't believe how easy and fast!  Replaced sugar with coconut sugar and it was terrific!  I will never buy jar sauce again.

I use Granny Smith apples, because of their sourness.

I used 5 small Honeycrisp apples that had passed my high standard for crunchiness!   I peeled, roughly chopped and added 3/4c of water as directed, I added a few more tablespoons, which it turns out was not necessary. I added the cinnamon but no sugar and it was great.  I barely mashed them, leaving lots of chunks.   While I probably won't make this in general, I will use it every time I have a few apples that otherwise would be thrown out.

The recipe is great with Granny Smith - the right amount of water, but cut the sugar back at least half.  Made the second time with Gala, and could have eliminated most or all of the sugar (only used half, and was still too much).

I tripled this and put it in the crockpot.  Instead of cinnamon I used pumpkin spice and my whole family couldn't get enough of it.

Unbelievably easy.  I had a recipe for Tropical Grilled Pork Chops. (See Allrecipe....so delicious!) but did not have any canned applesauce so made some with Sarah's Recipe.   Perfect and obviously a lot healthier.  I did drain off most of the water used to cook the apples before mashing them!

Update - I made with brown sugar instead of white.  Added a pinch of salt.  Used granny smiths to cut down on sweetness (6 large apples), 1/2 cup of water was enough.  Very good and extremely easy.

Really easy.  Hardest part is peeling the apples.  I used 6 medium to large granny smith apples so the amount of sugar was perfect. I let them cook until the apples essentially dissolved, no need for blending or mashing.

Great recipe, and quite easy to do.  I've made it several times now, for my partner who pines for his mother's homemade applesauce.  If used different apples, from time to time, but find Granny Smiths work best.  I run it through the food mill when it's done.

This is a perfect simple recipe. I was invited to a Chanukah celebration and everyone was so pleased to have homemade applesauce with their potato latkes! I am going to be making this on a regular basis because my husband loves applesauce on everything! I did reduce the sugar by about a half; but that was just for health reasons, not because the recipe wasn't perfect! Thank you for sharing.

Great applesauce! I love this on plain yogurt or by itself. I added only a little bit of water as other reviewers said and put only a little bit of sugar because I use gala apples and they are sweet already.

Great applesauce. It was  perfect... Could definitely be adjusted by using half or less of the sugar :) or more cinnamon. Super easy!

I made this in the crockpot.  It was delicious, not too sweet, not too tart.  My husband used it as the topping on vanilla ice cream and loved it.  I left it pretty chunky.

I loved this recipe. I only put 1/8 sugar in and added some more water the second time around. The original recipe is wonderful, but I wanted to make it a little on the healthier side and took out some of the sugar added more water and added more cinnamon. Overall the original recipe is delicious is really just depend on how you like your apple sauce (waterym thicker etc....). After making this recipe I will never again buy pre-packaged applesauce again

I had a bunch of apples that I was going to throw out and my boyfriend convinced me to make apple sauce. Yummm!!! So easy and sooooo good. Doubled the recipe and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Added a touch of nutmeg. Next time I'll use less sugar cause it didn't need so much. 
Gonna add the sauce to my oatmeal for breakfast!

Lost a star because it's too much water.  I doubled the recipe with apples we picked this weekend. I ended up bailing out about 3/4 cup liquid before I mashed the apples. Next time, I'll use APPLE CIDER! YUM! That would make this even better. I could probably reduce the sugar that way too. This was a great base recipe but it needs some tweaking.

the review by naples34102 critiqued it very well. Way way way too much water. And actually because my apples were small wild ones, I added more sugar.

Super good and easy. Second time I made it I used 1/2 the sugar and left the peelings on. Used a hand held blender and blended right in the pot. Left it slightly chunky for our tastes. Have used this recipe many times.

This is sooooo easy.  I don't add any extra sugar.  Just apples, a little water and cinnamon. My family loves it.  Anytime I have extra apples that are going soft I throw a batch of this together.

So easy to make and so delicious. I added extra water so the applesauce has the right consistency. I also blend it with my vitamix so it is done in one second!

This recipe is great, so easy, so fast. I didn't realize how easy it was to make applesauce. I just put it in a Tupperware dish and put in the fridge. I am so much more apt to eat homemade than store bought. Thanks so much, I should have done this a long time ago.

Way too much water and sugar. I had to add more apples and lemon juice.  Next time I would use half the water or double the apples and half the sugar with a little lemon juice. You can always add sugar to taste later

This was my first attempt and homemade apple sauce. It was very easy and VERY tasty. I had a hard time waiting for dinner to eat it. Actually, I had a hard time trying to convince myself that licking my submersion blender blade is a bad idea. I added more cinnamon as a personal preference, but otherwise made exactly as written. This is the kind of recipe I will double or triple in the future.

Perfect recipe! I dissolved a packet of hot apple cider drink mix into my water in a medium bowl, added my sugar and cinnamon, then poured it over my apples. I also made this in my crock pot.

Turned out great! Made as posted other than an accidental heavy shake of cinnamon. Perfect use for an immersion blender. My son preferred it served warm.

This was a very easy recipe. I love when basic ingredients come together to create a delicious dish! I used 5 medium sized McIntosh apples and about 6 small Honeycrisp apples. I used brown sugar, as suggested by many of the reviewers, however, I did not increase the brown sugar to compensate for the increase of the apples (they are both naturally sweet). I did double the cinnamon, and I added 1 tsp of nutmeg, and 2 tsp of vanilla. I also used 1 1/4 cup of water because I increased the apples.

Now for the flavor.....I cannot believe I have been purchasing Motts for YEARS! I do not like applesauce....I buy it for my boyfriend and my 2 boys. This is a HUGE winner!! The flavors are robust, the texture is perfect (Note: I did not use a masher. I used an electric hand blender and only used it to break up some of the apple skins...they did not want a "smooth" texture).

My only reason for subtracting a star is because with me using 11 apples, it did not make a lot. Maybe 4 cups, at best. Sounds like a lot for 3 men in the house, this didn't last more than 30 minutes after it cooled off!!

I will most definitely make this again...but will buy a huge bag of apples from the Farmer's Market instead...and can what we don't eat right away.

I used very tart (read: downright sour) Granny Smith apples and brown sugar instead of white. The amount of water and spice was spot on. I think most people would have sweetened it more, but I like to be able to taste the apple in my applesauce!

Delicious! I've taken a few liberties with the water-to-apple ratio, and I even made a batch in which I used some Granny Smiths, a couple of MacIntosh, a couple of Golden Delicious, and a few Asian Pears, just because it's what I had on hand.

I find myself rarely adding sugar to the recipe though, just some cinnamon, and occasionally ground nutmeg. It really makes it taste like apple pie filling!

This is the first time I've ever made applesauce. The whole family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, doubled it, and it took me about 30 minutes for my apples to be soft. Then I just threw them all into my vitamix blender and pulsed it a few times. I used gala apples. We put it in the fridge overnight and had it for breakfast. It was perfect. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely use it again :). If I had anything to add, it would be that after a small bowl of this, I felt a little "sweeted out". At first bite I didn't think it was overly sweet at all but after a whole bowl, I really started tasting the sugar so maybe next time I'll try it with a little less, I'm sure that's just personal preference though :). Good recipe!

First time I ever made apple sauce.  I thought it was simple and perfectly delicious.   I used Cortlandt apples.  Sometimes I've tasted other's homemade apple sauce and thought it was too overdone with spices and lemon and lemon zest and complicated and all the stuff that they said brings out the flavors of the apple.  Except I could hardly taste the apple.  This recipe let me actually taste the natural goodness of the apple.  Just a little cinnamon was a nice complement.  When it comes to good apple sauce, keeping it simple is better!

Fantastic! I take my girls apple picking every year and by day 4 they are tired of eating apples so we use them in other ways. This is a great recipe to use for applesauce cake, pancakes, muffins and as an oil substitute for baking. Thanks for sharing!

This is easy done in the crock pot.  Just toss in the apples - we like them chunky - & for extra flavor substitute apple cider for the water.  I wait until the apples are soft to add the sugar since some are sweeter than others & for a richer taste use brown sugar with the cinnamon.  Sometimes I mix different varieties of apples for nice texture.

I have been using brown sugar, with a pinch of cloves and grated nutmeg, along with cinnamon for years, to make apple crumble.
If you just want it for sauce though, it can be done in the microwave, in about 2 or 3 minutes. I'm sure this would be cheaper than cooking it in a slow cooker for 3 or 4 hours.

I've made this for years except that I use brown sugar. Give it a richer flavor.

I make a similar applesauce only in the microwave oven.  I use Gravensteins when in season, make 4 or 5 batches
Then divide them into containers and freeze.  Use only 1/2 cup water for cooking in the microwave
And use a large microwave safe bowl, covered.  Cook about 5 minutes, uncover and stir.  If the apples are not 
Done to your desire, cook another minute or two.  I add the cinnamon after the apples are cooked.

This is my third year using this recipe. It's the BEST applesauce recipe - especially for the late summer / early fall when the Paula Red / McIntosh apples come in. (Harder, crunchier apples don't mush up as well as these varieties.) The most time consuming part is peeling the apples. After you've made it a few times, you can 'eyeball' the other measurements (rather than measuring). My kids LOVE this applesauce - especially warm! I make it several times a week while the fresh apples are in season.

I made this recipe tonight with apples from our apple tree that are very sweet and very tart. I omitted the sugar like other reviewers suggested, but it turned out incredibly tangy. So we added the sugar back in and cooked for 5 more minutes. OMG - its delicious now! Don't alter the recipe!

I have made this many times- so simple and delicious! I triple the recipe (we have so many apples in our yard this time of year) and add half water/half apple juice if I have on hand for an added sweetness and it is perfect! Love the chunky applesauce and so do my kids and friends! We tend to make several times in late summer/autumn and it is wonderful on pancakes as well as alone:)

Great recipe!  I cooked 20+ sour apples with peels on in the slow cooker with the above ingredients (adjusted for the amount of apples) for 3-4 hours.  Turned out great, and definitely tasted better after it's been chilled.

I had fuji apples that needed to be used. I should have adjusted the sugar a little more than I had since fuji's are so sweet but was still very good. Applesauce didn't even make it to the fridge. Was gobbled up while still warm! :)

Thank you!! Easy, easy, easy!! Y'all are right!! I'll never again buy apple sauce in the store. This stuff rocked hard! I added a jalapeno to warm it up a bit and it was fantastic! I didn't take the advice that others had given about using less water and ended up draining some at the end, which was fine, it worked out great!! Oh, and I did cook it longer, hoping to evaporate some of the water. I'm not sure if that made it better or not... it was just so good! So good, in fact, I think I'll make some more today!!

Nice and simple and delicious. 

I serve alongside boneless pork chops, and it compliments nicely. Also delicious leaving more chunky by not mashing the apples. I will serve it chunky over pancakes - so delicious.

This recipe was super easy. I took some of the suggestions listed in other reviews. I used 2 granny smith apples, and 2 braeburn apples. I reduced the water to just under 1/4 c (that was still too soupy for me), and sugar to 1/8 c. Next time I will use a pinch of brown sugar as well. I cooked on low for about 25min, and coarsely mashed the apples. I wanted a little thicker still, so I added a little cornstarch as well. Super easy, and my kids loved it!

After a bout with a 24-hour stomach bug yesterday, my 4 1/2 year-old DD needed something bland today, so realizing I was out of jarred applesauce, I made this. I used 4 med/lg Granny Smiths, eyeballed a few pinches of both white/brown sugar and just a pinch of cinnamon. I used 1/4 c apple juice instead of water. At the end of 20 minutes, the apples were perfectly soft, however, I did need to add water in order for my immersion blender to blend to the consistency I wanted, so next time, I would use the recommended amount of water per recipe directions. I enjoyed this (moreso than still-sickly daughter). I would love to simmer this in a crockpot with some extra cinnamon and cloves next time!

I have made this frequently and it's a family favorite.  I love it the way it's written but occasionally make a few changes when desired.  Using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar is probably my favorite. Sometimes I add some ground cloves and nearly always grate some fresh nutmeg in.  Delicious!

I was glad I found the recipe for the basic directions so thanks for posting it.
I did think the amount of sugar was excessive. HAHA no wonder the little brother liked it!
I think if I make it again I will lower the water amount to 1/2 or 3/4 cup.

This fall a friend with an apple tree was begging people to come take what they wanted, so I helped myself.  I peeled and chopped up all the apples then froze them for later use.  I used one of the frozen bags of apples to make the applesauce.  Of course it took extra time to heat up and simmer, but the results turned out fantastically.  We used our food processor to "mash" the cooked apples because we don't have a potato masher. The consistency was perfect and it took a lot less time than doing it by hand with a fork.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

The first time I made this recipe as written and found the cinnamon to be overwhelming.  I omitted the cinnamon completely next time (you can always sprinkle some on top of each serving when serving, to taste), and it was much better this way.  I also prefer to puree the sauce.  I use my immersion blender so there's less clean-up.

Could not have found a better apple sauce recipe! This one looked the best in the photos, and tasted great. Surely a croud pleaser! You can make it chunky or smooth depending on how you like it. i made it chunky and it was wonderful. it tasted like fall, and delicious, spicy apple pie filling! Even my picky kids enjoye it.

I never thought I liked applesauce until I tried this recipe. I had 12 baking quality apples that I needed to use and this recipe was the perfect choice. It could not have been easier and the applesauce has a beautiful tangy flavor. 

I will never buy jarred applesauce again. Thank you, Sarah!

This is some really good applesauce.  I made it with 4 large apples, so added 1 cup of water instead of 3/4.  I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of only white sugar.  Next time I'll use dark brown sugar.  My husband loved the applesauce. And that's saying a lot b/c this man doesn't eat apples much.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it is amazing.  Luckily I like a sweeter applesauce though. Knowing your apples is crucial to get the sugar right!

This is about the easiest fruit there is to freeze.  I have made 8 batches of this recipe so far this season.  I don't even measure the water or the sugar anymore. This is a very simple recipe to adjust the amount of sweetness you want to your applesauce.  I add very little sugar as the apples from our tree are very sweet to start with.  The cooking time of about 20 minutes is correct, even with a big pot of apples.  I've also made this recipe using Red Hots® to create the cinnamon flavor that my DH and DS so love.  Once the batch has cooled, I store in zippered style baggies so that they lay flat in the freezer.  Thanks PHATCAT for sharing your recipe, it is a winner!

What's great about this recipe is that it gives you a base to work off. I used a ton (maybe 15?) of apples from my apple tree, peeled, cored and sliced with about 1 c. water, 1/2 c. brown sugar and spices to taste (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamon) and popped it in my slow cooker on low for about 4 hours. Then I mashed it with my potato masher. I will totally be making this again! It's a great recipe with lots of room for alterations and it seems quite forgiving. I had no idea applesauce was this easy to make until I read this!

Oh. My. DELICIOUS!!! Another reviewer said she couldn't understand why she ever bought jarred applesauce from the store and I am thinking the exact same thing. I went apple picking and came back with more than I knew what to do with so I decided to try this recipe. I finished my first batch about an hour ago. I smelled it through the house first- amazing. Than I tasted it- unbelievable! I shoved my used saucepan in the sink, pulled out a bigger one and my next (doubled) batch is on the stove right now. I made mine with Courtland apples and followed the recipe to a T. 
Wonderful recipe! This will be a staple every autumn, and a treat year round! Thanks!

This was delicious! I slowly added the sugar & kept tasting it along the way. I used 12 apples & 1 cup of sugar in the raw for a perfect blend. Cinnamon to taste. My apples were a mixture of green & red so it started out a bit tart. I also used 3 cups of water. I simmered it for about an hour. My family all loved it (and I have a picky teen!)

Used a mix of apples and red pears.  A couple of packets of Truvia instead of sugar, recommended cinnamon and only a splash of water.  Could eat the entire bowl!

Awesome recipe! I doubled it, and it came out great! I used a slow-cooker as suggested, switched the regular sugar for brown sugar, and added a hint of nutmeg. Amazing apple-sauce, and great for the fall!

So yummy and so easy! I never thought to try making applesauce, but I was left with about 8# of apples that were going. I almost doubled the recipe. It's a bit sweet for my taste (I prefer sour) but not much sweeter than conventional applesauce. I cooked on the stove and then transferred into the blender to puree. I'm lazy, LOL. Next time, I will probably cut a little of the sugar OR use granny smith instead of red delicious.

For those of you who want a smooth applesauce, don't transfer it all to the blender at once because there will likely be chunks left in. Transfer in smaller batches.

I love homemade apple sauce! Here's a tip for healthier sauce .. omit the sugar and use honey instead. If you do this, make sure it's 100% honey and not some cheap  - or it will turn out awful. I also added nutmeg.

Awesome, easy recipe. I used nearly double the apples and only half the sugar because we just picked a bunch of sweet apples--McIntosh, Empire, Jonathan, and Golden Delicious. Added cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg to taste. DELICIOUS. I've been using this recipe for a while, and it always gets rave reviews.

Very tasty! Maybe a little too sweet. I'd use less sugar next time or add it as it's cooking as the apples can be quite sweet. Love home-made apple sauce. Nothing beats it!

Very tasty!  But after being on the stove for 20 minutes, it was very watery still (I tripled recipe).  So I let it simmer for 10-15 without the lid on to let some of the water evaporate.  I also only added 1/2 c. sugar to a tripled recipe.  I think my daughter will love this!

I tripled this recipe, as I had a huge box of apples to get rid of ... great applesauce, would make again, but a little too cinnamon-y, so next time I would just leave it out, or just do a sprinkle

Fantastic recipe!  Used Jonagold apples and one large granny smith so it wouldn't go to waste.

What I LOVED about this recipe, was how easy it was to make. I wound up making not quite double this recipe. However, I found it a *little* too sweet for me. I like my apple sauce to taste more natural than like I'm eating a carmel apple.   If you like your apple sauce sweet, go for it! If you don't, back off on the sugar a little :) Otherwise, really great recipe. It'd be 5 stars if it did not have so much sugar!

I made this recipe last night with German potato pancakes.  I used 2 granny smith and 2 cortland apples and cooked it hard for 15 minutes.  Turned out thick and very good.  Just a little too much cinnamon for me but the sweetness was just right.  I guess it depends what type apples you use as the granny smith were quite tart.  Very easy to make.

Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for and came out just like my mothers. I was using mitusu apples and 1/4 cup sugar was just right if I had added anymore it would have been too sweet.

Per every 4 apples I added one large spoonful of honey, and did not use sugar. I used empire apples. This was very good and not too sweet. I made a quadruple batch and froze in freezer jars. Excellent!

Super easy, super good...and if you add a bit more cinnamon, makes a really awesome crepe filling.  Thanks for making my family fun day simple and yummy:)  Only thing I did different was cook on med-low for 45 - 60 min...maybe I just made my apples thicker.  Came out fantastic anyway!

I used 6 Golden Delicious apples instead of 4. Kept the water and sugar levels the same, except I threw in a pinch of brown sugar as well.  I have a sweet tooth, but it was *slightly* too sweet for me.  Hubby and kids LOVED it, though.  I will definitely make it again and experiment with sugar and water levels.

I went to an apple orchard for the first time and wanted to make as many homemade recipes as I could with the apples. All of the other recipes I found had so many steps and ingredients and took a lot of time. This recipe worked really well for me and was quick! I used roughly 12 apples and tripled everything except the water I only used 1 1/2. I think next time I would only double the sugar as was a little sweet. I only decided to blend it after I mashed it to get more of a smooth store style applesauce and I really loved it! Great recipe!

This was great.  I gave it 4 stars because she actually adds sugar!  That is aweful.  Why would you add sugar?  The apples are plenty sweet.  It was wonderful (5 stars) without the sugar.

I used 28 - 30 small to medium apples and left all else the same (although I cooked a little longer since I had a bigger pot of apples).  Good, much better than store bought, but I have had better.  I, personally, like mine more thick and chunky too.  This one is thin, like the stores' applesauce.

This is very good.  I made it a second time and added an extra apple, 1/2 t.apple pie spice and only 1/4 c. water.  It was better with the extra flavorings.  Thank you.

Excellent - my 6 year old basically made it herself (with a little help..). I am not sure it is possible to goof it up. Served with Marinated Pork Tenderloin (from this site- also outstanding) and then for breakfast with pancakes.

I love this recipe. When cooking in a slow cooker, however, I usually add at least a couple of fresh squeezes of lemon juice, and I cut down on the sugar. It all boils down to what kind of apples you're using, but the lemon helps it stay fresh-tasting and gives it a little punch, especially if you're making it in large quantities.

Wow. New family family favorite!  LEAVE THE SKIN ON APPLES! Totally loved the extra texture and fiber the skin added, plus it reduced the prep time to next to nothing.  Increased recipe to 12 apples and reduced brown sugar to 1/3 c. (since my family usually eats unsweetened applesauce, I didn't want it to be too sweet).  It was a keeper!

The apples I had were very small (and very bruised!) so I used 6, and a little less water (1/2 c). I also used brown sugar because that was all I had. It turned out really well, I'm eating it now! Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe using 4 medium to large sized red apples, 2 were regular reds and 2 were another sweet red variety. It came out perfectly! The texture and consistency was beautiful and the cinnamon flavor really comes through deliciously. I did not find it to be too sweet, but just right. Will definitely make again.

The only difference is that I don't peel mine and at the end of cooking I put the mixture in a blender and process until smooth. This recipe works great for pears, too!

L-O-V-E it!!!  I have been cooking applesauce off of a different recipe for a while now and after tasting this recipe i will NEVER go back to the old one!  However i would adjust the amount of sugar added based on if you want apple sauce for a dessert (keep at 1/4 cup) or if you want it for a quick and easy snack (go a little under 1/4 cup) Other than that this recipe is definitely a keeper... i will be making this again and SOON.

Just made this for a last-minute side with porkchops.  I mixed in a little cornstarch flurry and served it hot.  Used an immersion (stick) blender to mash some of them but kept it really chunky.  My boys went nuts for it.  Will have to make again, and soon!

Amazing! I'd never made applesauce before and this turned out great. I used 5 apples, a little be less sugar and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon.... I put in too much cinnamon but that's my own fault. Still delicious.

I've never been a fan of applesauce because I've never had the real McCoy before.  Use Granny Smiths if you want fabulous, complex flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly but uncovered the last 7 minutes because it seemed watery.  The texture was perfect.  The flavor was wonderful!  And it's so easy.

I used Organic Pink Lady apples, but didn't skin them. Also used less sugar. Used a hand blender as opposed to a fork/potato masher... Love it.

Recalulated this recipe to serve 10 then made it exactly as stated in recipe. It was delicious. Served it hot right off the stove and everyone loved it with the pork roast I had made. I used 5 Gala apples (they were on sale) and 5 green apples (Pippin?) This recipe is a keeper.

This was a pretty good recipe. I did change a few things however. I used a couple more apples and less sugar. I can understand that some folks might not like the tartness. I have had store bought apple sauce that was unsweetened and it was quite lovely on it's own. I used a little more cinnamon and I would recommend less water. Bottom line, if you're up for a healthier snack and don't mind a little bit of tartness, use less sugar and let the natural sugar in apples do the trick for this easy and great recipe.

Utterly delicious!  I did a tablespoon of cinnamon like others suggested.  It seemed like not much water for a lot of apples, so I added a bit more, but then it was boiling a lot as it cooked, so I'd stick with 3/4.  It does cook down, after all.

When I had too many apples on hand I decided to find a recipe to use them in. This applesauce is super  easy and so delicious. My husband likes his really sweet so I added a tiny bit more sugar to my second batch. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Wow!!! Really, really perfect - perfect flavour, consistency, sweetness, cinnamon. Just YUM-O! I needed applesauce for a recipe and in 20 minutes I had this ready to go. I`d definitely double this and for sure will be using it again and playing with the ingredients a bit. Thanks for a great, super-easy recipe!

Used Fuji Apples, cooked on Medium Heat for 30 Min and they still weren't mashable.... gave up and threw in food processor. Shouldn't have added as much sugar as listed (maybe none at all). Good but too sweet. Didn't make very much.... only came out to about a cup when finished. I'll make it again but with some adjustments.

AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING! I was originally skeptical because it seemed so simple, but 4 chopped McIntosh apples, 1/2 c. water, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon later, I am in complete awe. Was tempted to add sugar while cooking, but am extremely glad that I didn't for both health and taste reasons!

I have to give this one a 5, even though the flavor isn't quite as complex as we're used to. That is easily adjustable--add more of what you like. The method here works like a charm, but I think, personally, that it's too much water. I'd reduce that next time by a bit. I used Gala apples, so didn't need as much sugar as called for. I sliced my apples & didn't bother mashing them; added a couple slices of minced crystallized ginger for a change of pace (we eat homemade applesauce roughly 4x/week!). Thanks, this was a great substitute for the slow cooker version when I was cramped for time!

I made this just now, I let it cook  for about 25 minutes then I started to mash it, (with a fork this is all i have, at the moment) and it didn't turn out very applesauce-y, it just seemed like mashed apples with sugar and cinnamon. What did I do wrong? Not enough water? Did I not mash them enough?   Help would be GREALY appreciated. I still rated this a 4 because the taste was still VERY good, mine just didn't turn out like it should have.  Also, I added the exact amount of water but I aded a LITTlE less sugar and I used  5 apples medium green apples.

YUM, YUM!  What a difference in taste homemade applesauce makes!  Had planned to add extra apples but found one rotten apple which had to be thrown out.  While the apples were cooking, kinda eyeballed it and decided to take out some of the liquid.  I'm glad I did.  Should never have to buy applesauce again with this wonderful recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I used McIntosh Apples, and I used 5 large apples and than followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect! I made this for Thanksgiving and I had no leftovers to take home!

This is a fine recipe...but why stop at such a small amout? What I do is wash and core the apples, I leave the peelings on, they give the applesauce a nice pink color. I fill up my largest pan with apples and add a little water to cover the bottom and cook until mushy. Then put it through a food mill or seive to get the skins out. Add sugar and spices to taste.

I didn't know home made applesauce was so quick or so easy!  I used Macintosh and empire apples and about half the sugar.  Even so, next time I will leave out the sugar completely since macintosh/empire apples are so sweet on there own.  Mine was just a bit more watery than I like, so I'll use let of that next time as well.

This was so easy to make and every flavorful.  I first used my pastry blender then finished with my immersion blender.   I was thinking after tasting it hot there was not enough cinnamon, but had some cold the next day...Perfect!

I don't like applesauce froma jar but I had apples that needed to be used before they went bad.  It was so easy to make and so good! I had extra leftover that I didn't mash and I used it in a pie - it was so easy and delicious!  Thanks Phatcat!

I took a tip from America's Test Kitchen, which has a very similar recipe, and used Macoun apples--wonderful! Jonagold are also a type that are recommended. Throwing 2 whole cinnamon sticks in while cooking works great.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!  OMG, it is soooo good!  I used McIntosh apples, and followed the recipe to a tee.  Absolutely delicious!  Will never buy applesauce again.  I made it on Sat., 10/24/09 for the first time, and doubled the recipe the next day.  Thank you so much!

I make much the same recipe.  However I skip the sugar and no one misses it. I usually use MacIntosh apples.  Also a hand blender mashes it well and quickly.

Yay, I'm the 600th person to rate this recipe! I've made this recipe several times the past year, and absolutely love it! I usually follow the recipe exactly as it's written, but sometimes I double it. I'm making this applesauce again right now, and it already smells so good. This applesauce is so delicious!

I will never eat store bought apple sauce again.  This recipe is absolutely SUPERB!  I will, however, try, laurajfrog's suggestion of replacing the water and sugar with apple cider next time.  Many thanks for the recipe.

I used apple cider instead of water which made perfect applesauce without adding sugar!  My kids (as well as my husband and myself) loved it!  I can't believe I had never made applesauce before now.  So easy!

I thought this was terrific!  I tripled the recipe, making it with 12 large macintosh apples.  I found there was too much water, however, so I ended up straining the apples through a collander before mashing them.  It was a hit it my household and a perfect way to use extra apples!

This applesauce is so easy and delicious.  I needed to use up some apples that a friend gave me.  I used granny smith and found ¼ cup sugar to be just right.  We ate it warm as a side dish with dinner and of course it tasted even better the next day when it was chilled.  I will be making this regularly from now on.

Super simple, super easy. Making applesauce for the kids, so I left out the sugar completely for a healthier treat. Using a sweet variety of apple (instead of tart) completely eliminates the need for any sugar.

FAST & EASY!  As I was preparing a ham and cabbage dinner, I decided to make this as a side dish.  Within 20 minutes it was sitting on the table cooling down.  I served it warm and it was DELICIOUS!  Thank you PHATCAT for such a delicious recipe.

Wondeful!  I took the suggestion of another posting and doubled the recipe and put it in my slow cooker for four hours on high.  My oldest daughter won't eat anything with "chunks" in it!  So, I took my mixer out and ran it through the finished product.  It made it really smooth and even passed my VERY picky daughter's test!  Everyone loved it!  The perfect sweetness.  I used Molly Delicious apples.

This is very similar to the recipe I've used for years, only I use apple juice rather than water. Also a tad of lemon juice, and usually apple pie spice. Infinitely better than store bought!

Delicious. Perfect start to fall.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was a bit watery at first but then upon cooling it thickened and it turned out great! Much better than store bought applesauce. I don't think I'll be able to eat that again after making this.

My family went apple picking yesterday and I picked a bushel of Golden Delicious just for applesauce.  I wanted to make and freeze some.  I decided this was the recipe to use and I am so happy I did.  It turned out so good.  I am still working on more applesauce as we speak.  It was soooo easy to make and not too sweet.  For those that can or freeze, I tripled this recipe and it made about 2-1/2 quarts.  Oh yeah,  I ran mine through a food mill after it cooled down a little.  PERFECT!  Thank you!

I used 10 small apples, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 Tbsp. cinnamon and then brown sugar at the end to taste.  Simmered to the thickness I wanted.  Easy and tastes great!

For those on a sugar restricted diet, omit the sugar, the apples are usually sweet enough you don't need it except of course if you use tart apples and even then it can be ok with no added sugar

I made this applesauce in my slow cooker using double the recipe - the end result was really good.  I did use brown sugar instead of white - and we found it a bit sweet in the end.  I used some tart Lobo apples, so next time, I think I will use less sugar (start with 1/4 cup for 8 apples) and I think I will finish it with lemon juice to give the flavor a bit of depth.

Made this in my slow-cooker for about 4 1/2 hours.  It tastes like baked apples if you eat it warm.  I only pureed about 1/2 of it because I like chunky applesauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and served it slightly warmed over vanilla ice cream.  Very, very yummy.  My family loved it, and my grandchildren wanted seconds. I'm not a fan of traditional applesauce, but I do love this recipe.  Will make it often.

I am wondering why I didn't know about this sooner!  Why buy applesauce?  This stuff is amazing!  I did not use the cinnamon, but did make it the same way the recipe stated.  I did double it though!

Great recipe as it is. To make it 5 star, add a dash of vanilla extract. I took this tip from another applesauce recipe on this site, and it gave this recipe the little zing it was missing. I used red delicious, but I think I'll use honeycrisp next time for a little extra natural sweetness.

Taste like the filling of an apple pie!  I used 4 medium size Gala apples, peels kept on, and put all the ingredients in a crock pot for about 3 hours.  Could have used a little less water, but that could have been due to the size of the apples or the use of the crock pot.  I just used a slotted spoon to drain most of the leftover water.

I like this and make it all the time.  I leave the skins on and make it a litle chunky.  I also use apple juice and brown sugar in mine instead of the while suga and cinnamon.

I have never made applesauce before and wanted to try it.  I made this last night and it is already gone!  I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup.  Since I prefer unsweetened applesauce, I think next time I'll try it with no sugar at all and see how it turns out.  Thanks for a good recipe!

So simple and really really good! I HATE canned applesauce but I needed applesauce for a muffin recipe, this worked great and for the first time I enjoyed eating applesauce on its own.  I will definitly make this again just for a snack!

this was great and I will never buy store bought applesauce again. I will double the apples next time but i think i will keep the cinnamon and sugar the same since it was a little sweet for my tastes

I wanted unsweetened applesauce for baking bread and stuff, so I omit the sugar and cinnamon, add an extra apple and 1/4 cup lemon juice, and used 1/2 water. Lemon juice made it taste real good!

I had no idea that so few ingredients could make applesauce taste like this!  I used macintosh apples and I think I will use less sugar next time, but that might just be my personal preference.  Otherwise, this is the only applesauce recipe you need!

I didn't know homemade applesauce was so easy!  I use an organic produce delivery service and order apples every week with the intention of eating an apple a day, but when I don't they build up pretty quickly.  This is a fantastic, healthy way to use up the excess.  I doubled the recipe, using a variety of apples. Used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 TJs spiced cider and 1/2 water for the liquid.  I had to cook them longer than specified to get them soft enough.  I think next time I'll take another reviewers advice and just let them stew all day in a crock pot.  We had it tonight with pork and I can't wait for it to fully chill so I can eat some more tomorrow.******* UPDATE: MAde this again, but left them for about 5 hours in the slow cooker on high and this was a MUCH better method. SO much easier, and actually tased better too and easier to mix because they cooked more evenly. My only complaint about this is that it doesn't make that much applesauce for as much apples as you put into it, but I think that's the nature of applesauce and not the recipe's fault... This is simply the best applesauce ever.

This is a really good recipe, I only gave it 4 stars because I think it calls for too much water and sugar!  This is my first time making applesauce, though my grandmother made it a lot when I was a kid, so I was craving some this year.I made a huge batch for thanksgiving last night, and some extra for my husband to eat before Thursday.  I used 6 lbs of apples (Macintosh), and about 4-5 cups of water, and 1 3/4 cup of sugar and about 2 tbls of cinnamon.  I used half white and half brown because that was all I had left, I also added nutmeg.    after about 15 minutes of cooking I was able to use my potato masher to mash the apples in the saucepan.  Then I added some whole very thin slices of 1 grannysmith, and let it all cook another 10 minutes or so longer.  I ended up straining out the rest of the water, because I like chunky applesauce like the kind at Chicken out. it was about 2 cups of water.  I have had to threaten my husband with no pie, if he eats all the applesauce before thursday.  It is taking alot of will power to stay out of it.

Excellent! I tripled the batch, and it turned out delicious! Left it a little chunky. I did drain some water, the recipe called for a bit too much in my opinion.  Also made a fabulous banana bread with this applesauce!!

SO easy, thank you!

YUM!

A bit on the sweet side so if you are using a sweeter variety of apple I would skimp a bit on the sugar.  Other than that a simple and perfect applesauce!

This is better than storebought. I didn't print out the recipe thinking that I'd remember the measurements, but I forgot. I did use 4 apples, but I used 2/3 cup water, 1/3 cup sugar and eyeballed the cinnamon. I thought it was too sweet and ended up adding extra water. So if I make it as instructed next time, it should be perfect. I left it a little chunky at my son's request.

WOW. Made this for hubby and stepkids, and all were impressed.  I have to admit, I am a novice, and was a little intimidated by homemade applesauce, but it was a hit!  Great use of 30 lb. bag of apples from our local orchard. It's almost gone, and I'm so disappointed.  I even reduced the sugar, and it's like guilt free candy.  Yummm...

Yum!  This was perfect, I had way too many apples and needed something to use them in.  I used about 1/4 cup of UNPACKED brown sugar, since I like it better than white sugar.  I used to recommended amount of cinnamon, and everything was perfect.  Everyone loved it!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy, tasty recipe.  I prepared my apples in the evening, put them in a slow cooker and let them cook overnight.  Mashed them the next a.m. with a potato masher and they were ready to go.  Rather than regular cinnamon, I went to a spice store and purchased Chinese Cinnamon - top seller item and it notches up the flavor.  Will be keeping this recipe.

Wonderful and oh so easy!  I cut back on the sugar - used maybe a heaping tablespoon - since I was not using tart apples, and I probably could have used even less.  I simmered  uncovered the last five minutes to let it thicken up some.   I may even try making unsweetened applesauce using this method, and if it comes out anything like this first batch I can truly say I'll never buy applesauce again!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I don't even really like applesauce so I have no idea what made me even make this to begin with.  But we both LOVED it and it was really easy to do too.  I followed all of the recipe except I used just under the 1/4 cup of sugar and it was just fine.  In fact in the future I may use even less sugar.  As a lot of people have mentioned, it all depends on which apples you use.  I was sick this week and all I wanted to eat was this applesauce.  Yum! I am so excited to know how to make my own applesauce.  It is very easy and so much better than store bought.

I used splenda because I don't eat sugar and it turned out really great.  My husband and kids loved it also.  Very quick, easy, and tasty!

Very good. Instead of sugar, I use honey though. (do not give honey to a child younger than a year old.)

Great, classic applesauce recipe.  I doubled it & used Cortlands fresh off the tree.  I ended up cooking for a few minutes longer, but other than that followed the original recipe.  Thanks for such a tasty recipe!

Thank you for the reminder on making applesauce!  Go figure should be a no brainer, but I always forget and ask myself, "add water?"... "don't add water".  Perfect for a grey day!

I used gala apples, which are quite sweet, so I omitted the sugar completely, which makes it better for you.  I cut the apples into quite small pieces to aid in mashing it at the end, especially since I had to use fork as I don't have a potato masher.  Simple and delicious.

I am not an applesauce fan but I had some apples that were going a little mushy on me and did not want to see them go to waste. So I made this recipe and I doubled it and cooked it in the crockpot for 3-4 hours on high.
WOW this is so yummy even from a person who does not like applesauce.

This is the best applesauce I have ever had and my kids also love it!  I made it in my crockpot- I cooked it about one- and-a-half hours on high until the apples were soft, but not too mushy, and then pureed it in my blender, until it was mostly pureed with just little chunks of apple.

This is an easy recipe and mine turned out well, however I wish the amount of apples was given by weight. Four apples, depending on the size, can differ greatly for yield. Also, I cut back the water to about 2/3 cup and still had a little too much water. I mashed it in the food processor and it turned out very nice.

this was a good recipe. i think it called for too much cinnamon, though. i'm not a big fan of cinnamon in applesauce, so... anyways, my younger siblings enjoyed it and said it was much better than storebought, but honestly, i couldn't taste a difference. however, i did like that i knew what i was putting into my body, no preservatives or weird chemicals. i had a little bit of trouble peeling the apples, but other than that, extremely easy!

Great, but can be improved upon. I recommend using 1 cup juice of choice (apple, cranberry, pomegranate - my personal favorite) and adding a handful of dried craisins. Then add lemon juice (1-2 Tbsp) and honey or brown sugar to taste after cooking down. I don't peel the apples either. They add wonderful texture (not to mention extra insoluble fiber!).

I used the apples from our tree but I have no idea what kind they are.  I bet Granny Smith would work best.

This is a terrific recipe that's easy to prepare and tastes great.  I have already made it four or five times and my grandson can't get enough of it when I make it.  I use Gala apples as they are firm like a Granny Smith, but sweet like a Delicious apple. I also leave it kind of chunky which gives it a nice texture.  This is better than any jar or canned applesauce, and it's a winner in my book!

The recipe is pretty basic, so I don't know if it was the apples I used, or the recipe itself, but the applesauce turned out perfect!! I took off the peel of a couple of the apples in one long string with a veggie peeler and added it to the pot to make the sauce pink.

It's probably fair to say that I prefer sweet applesauce and that's why I am only giving this rating four stars.  I do think this is a great recipe for children because it isn't too sweet. UPDATE: I made this today and now I agree with the rest of the reviews, this is a 5 star recipe.  My modifications were as follows: 5 medium-large granny smith apples, 1/2 cup sugar, a heaping 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg.  I also used a box grater to ensure all the apples were relatively the same size.

YUM!!  I've never attempted to make my own applesauce before, but we were without, and my four year old was unhappy.  I used 3 organic gala and 3 organic granny smith, 1 cup of water, and 1/4 cup of sugar.  It was a little sweet, but had the BEST flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.....we can't go back to store bought now : )

I have never made actual home-made applesauce before.. This was fantastic! I reviewed several of the comments, and followed their advice at the store, I bought 2 of several different varieties of apples.. I wound up using 5-6 large apples.. Instead of cooking them in a saucepan, I put them in a microwave safe bowl, and nuked them for 7 minutes.. Then I mashed them with a potato masher, and put them back in for another 7, and mashed them again.. This was superb! I had my in-laws over and they all loved it.. Still warm and a bit chunky, nice and sweet! Thanks so much! This is going into my favorites!

My arm is aching from the smashing, but it was worth it. I took another reviewers advice and left a little of the peeling on the apples for some interesting texture and pretty color. I also used a bit less water than called for and it came out great. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I just made this recipe this afternoon, and it turned out very nicely. I used Gala apples, though, and I think next time I'll try it with a different kind of apple, because it was lacking a bit of sweetness/tartness that I like in applesauce.
Very easy, very good. Thanks for posting this recipe!
Update---I've made this recipe several times now. The last time I made it, I didn't put in the suggested amount of cinnamon---I just dumped in as much as I wanted, plus I put in ground cloves. It needs a lot of spice to make the flavour come out. It was the best batch that I've made so far. 
Thanks again for this recipe! :)

This recipe was so easy... I just put it on the stove and cleaned my kitchen while it simmered!  It was delicious, too!  The only modification I made was I doubled the sugar, b/c I only had Granny Smith apples, and didn't want it to be too tart.  I also added a little extra water to compensate for the extra sugar.  Wonderful recipe, I don't think I'll ever buy jarred applesauce again!

Great!  I doubled the recipe and used half the sugar following others reviews.  Also I didn't peel the apples but instead put them through a food mill after cooking.  I think its easier and I hate peeling apples.  I will definitely use this again!

Loved this recipe. Changed the serving size to 20 & used less than half a cup of brown sugar. I put the peels in the food processor & used them as well.

Great. I used a mix of Jonathan, Golden Delicious, and Northern Spy. Doubled the recipe and used 12 apples, no sugar. Added some nutmeg, vanilla and a shot of brandy.

I followed the recipe exactly buy added a pat or 2 of butter to the finished product. It was amazing! People always rave about my mother-in-law's applesauce but at the get together, they finished mine and left hers!

It's so nice to see a recipe that doesn't require food processors and other fancy equipment. I'm glad to know the proper ratios of apples to water so I can increase the quantity easily. I now make it without any sugar. (It really depends on the apples.)

My daughter will not eat store bought applesauce but she LOVES this. I used 6 apples, added nutmeg and about a tsp of vanilla. I also only used 2 pinches of sugar, my advice is taste the apples after they've cooked awhile and if they aren't sweet enough then add some sugar. Also 3/4 cup of water isn't too much I used about double that just in case I got distracted, so it wouldn't burn. I just let the extra water boil down but left enough so that when I pureed it, it would be a good consistancy.

Fabulous! I used Honeycrisp apples, and next time I won't add any sugar.  

But soooo good. And I love the smell while it's cooking.

This was great! I pureed the apples with an immersion blender and they came out much smoother than anticipated, but that was my own fault. Still delicious. I added RAISINS while the applesauce was still hot and added ALOT of flavor.

Excellent applesauce!  I love my homemade sauce chunky and this was perfect.  I doubled the recipe and halved the sugar and it was just a tad too sweet, but that was probably my apple choices.  Went great with the "Skillet pork chops with potatoes and onions" from this site.  My husband "claimed" to hate applesauce, but LOVED this.  We will make this again and again!

This was simple & fantastic. I let the apples simmer for about 40-45 minutes and only smushed them 'til they were at a chunky consistancy (my preference over smooth). Served them with a big plate of pork chops, mashed potatoes and green beans. They were the first thing gone on everyone's plate!

Good recipe.  Some thhoughts...instead of water use apple cider and if you want a cinnamon flavor then toss in some 'red hot' candies, this will add flavor and make the apple sauce a nice pink color.

First time making applesauce and was really surprised at how easy the whole process was. I found that it was a little on the sweet side but it was still ridiculously good! I guess if I was using all granny smith apples, I would have used the recommended amount of sugar because of how tart they are but I used a combination of sweet and tart apples. The addition of the cinnamon was fantastic, it reminded me of going to my grandmothers house as a little girl. I doubled the recipe and was thrilled with the outcome, will become another addition to my recipe box!!

Delicious on French toast!  I also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom to give it an apple-pie-spice flavor.

All I can say is, you out did yourself girl !!!!!!  It was great !  The only thing I did different, was put a little more cinnamon in the recipe. I doubled it so I could can some of it. After putting it in the jars, I did the water bath for 20 min. (after boiling).

This looks like good recipe, but it all depends on your personal taste. I did not try the recipe (I have too many apples to count out just 4), but it looks as if there is too much sugar. I would add that amount of sugar to a huge pot, not just 4 apples. Apple sauce is pretty fool proof, you can't really mess it up, it is dependent on personal preference. The longer you cook it the smoother and more "velvety" the texture, shorter cooking with provide a crisper flavor and chunkier sauce. I cook mine in large batches (think 50 gal ice chest filled with apples) in the oven in 2 very large covered pots (even distribution of heat as opposed to stovetop -- decreases burning) stirring every 15-20 minutes. In additon to cooking method, you can also make it with or without skins. A grinder is a must if you choose to leave the skins on. Experiment and have fun.

Great Recipe. I was just given over 100 apples and i have to make something this weekend with them all. I did a batch with 16 apples. I should have done more apples or less sugar/cinnamon, but i will know for next time. The ammount of water was perfect. I simmered for 30 minutes or more because i forgot about it, and used an immersion blender to get it to nice consistency for my little kids. I have already tasted it and love it. I plan on making a batch for my neighbors tonight. I may try adding blueberry/blackberry from my neighbors plants for another mild flavoring as well.

Quite simply divine!  Well worth the time!  I was wondering if this would turn out the same if you put the apples through a food processor instead of chopping them?  Any ideas?  Thanks for passing along the recipe, it's great.

WOW! Made this for my daughter, as baby food. She 18 months and I used honey, as a natural sugar - and WOW! It's amazing. Full of flavor - but I think even without sugar it would be perfect!

Amazing...I used brown sugar and honey instead because that's all I had in the kitchen, and used cinnamon bark instead...still tasted amazing. So easy too! Delicious when it's nice and warm. Thanks!

This was very good and easy to make. If You cook the apples for a shorter amount of time you can have baked apples. I tried it and it is just as good.

I agree with everyone else - this was REALLY good. I might use a little less sugar next time because I usually buy the "natural" applesauce, but it was really good (and not too sweet) with the 1/4 cup of sugar.

Very very delicious. I used two Fuji, one Golden Delicious and one Empire for a nice combination. I like my applesauce a bit on the tart side and so added less sugar, and also because the Fuji apples were quite sweet anyway. Peeling and chopping up the apples by hand took a bit longer than I thought, but this was well worth it. The apples cook faster if you chop them finely - oh, and don't forget the cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg too!

I have made this a few times (usually in a large batch and I freeze the leftovers).  I reduced the sugar and replaced some of the white with brown sugar for fun.  This recipe definitely depends on the quality of apples you use.  The best I have made was using tart apples from a local orchard (Winesap, Ida Red).

Wonderful!!! I use a mixture of granny smith apples and gala apples. They are great with porkchops for dinner or breakfast. Another thing we like this recipe for is dessert. Just cook the apple chunks enough to where they are soft and warm, but don't mash them. Instead, serve them in their sauce in chunks over vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I made this for my two year old son, who's a huge fan of apples and apple sauce.  I meant to save some for him for the next day but we both couldn't stop eating it!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is simple and yet fantastic! I read online that you should use a combination of different apples for applesauce, but I only had Macintosh on hand so I used those - I was definately lucky! Turns out Macintosh is great for applesauce. It was the most delicious applesauce I have ever tried! For the next batch I tried some Gala apples... and it definately didn't match up. I think I'll stick with Macintosh from now on... the tartness really adds to the flavor... maybe next time I'll try a combination with Gravenstein. Sooooo yummy warm.

Really, really good - but definitely too much water in my case.  Does it depend on the apples?  I used Empire, 16 of them, and quadrupled everything.  I probably should have used more like 2 cups of water instead of 3.  But even after draining the excess water (and sugar and cinnamon) off at the end, still DELICIOUS!  Also, I only peeled and sliced, didn't chop.  Saved time and same end result once mashed.

I love homemade applesauce...the one I make is very similar to this. For even more flavor, add a little bit of nutmeg and honey. Also, if I have it on hand, I mix apple cider with the water. Really brings out the apple taste! SO easy and so much better than store bought.

Well, I am making this sauce for the second time this week. Tomorrow I am going to use it in applesauce cake with the brown sugar cream cheese frosting from this site. The only changes I have made are instead of water I am using a sweeter blush wine called Pink Catawba from the Lake Erie wineries and brown sugar instead of white. The first batch was consumed in less than 1 hour, LONG before dinner was even ready. *sigh*. Ill let you know how it works in the applesauce cake!

This is good applesauce. Used about double the apples and the same amount of sugar and it was still too sweet so next time I will use even less sugar. Otherwise very fast and good.

I have made this recipe probably 100 times now. It is terrific! My family loves it, I love it, and I never buy applesauce anymore. 

Having made it a number of times, I have played with the recipe. Here are my experiences:

I have doubled, tripled, quadrupled the recipe and it comes out great each time. It takes longer to come to a boil, but you cook it the same amount of time. 

Storage--I have found this freezes fairly well, so I often make a large batch. There are some texture changes, so I tend to leave the sauce I freeze a little chunkier so it can be stirred, etc. Let defrost slowly in the refrigerator. 

Cutting down the sugar--I have found this works okay with less sugar, but tastes watery with no sugar. You need a little sugar for the right taste with the cinnamon and to emphasize the apple flavor. The full sugar tastes best. We have also tried this with brown sugar, which gives a little more caramel flavor and deeper color. Use white sugar for the brightest apple flavor. 

Freezing--I have found

WOW!  I use applesauce in place of eggs and oil and this is game changing!  I made it with a big mix of gala, red delicious and granny smith.  I hardly cut them and tossed them in the slow cooker on high.  I added a TON of cinnamon, a splash of water and NO sugar.  Towards the 5-6 hour mark I started checking them, mashing with a wooden spoon.  After 8 or 9 hours I let them cool and put them in the blender with some more cinnamon, vanilla and fresh lime juice to freshen it up.  I have actually been taking it to work to eat, its so delicious and filling! I'm going to have to make more to use in recipes!!

Delicious!  I followed this recipes measurements and cooking instructions, but because I am between a Keto and Paleo diet, I used Granny Smith apples, Monkfruit for a natural sweetener and a touch of almond extract.  Yummy!

Simple, easy, delicious, and fun to make!

Used smaller Gala apples and 4 yielded a little over one cup of apple sauce.

Next time I will cut out the added sugar to see how it tastes.

Used this as a loose base recipe. 
Doubled the batch but only added 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of sugar. Came out super sweet and that was only half the sugar! I could have gotten away with only using 3/4 of a cup of water as well. It was a tad bit runny but still tasty. Will add less water next time! Glad I read the other reviews first before diving right in!

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner and loved it! Everyone in my family asked for more!! It made just a super small serving for each person even though I upped the recipe to 9 servings. It was hard to get all the chunks out, although it may have just been my apples.  I stirred the applesauce while hot with a wooden spoon, which got more chunks out.  We ate it slightly chunky, but everyone loved it just the same!!

“I love this applesauce!” My kids say the same thing every time I make it. I often add more apples but keep the water, sugar and cinnamon the same with perfect results. I mash or whisk it and leave lots of yummy chunks. A winner every time!

Very easy to make.  I made it with 2 red delicious and 2 granny apples.  I think the next time I make this, I'll make it with 3 red delicious as I had to add a little bit of brown sugar to balance the sweet and tart.

Delicious, just what I was looking for! Just for the record, I didn't add sugar, but used maple syrup at half the amount listed for sugar.

Delicious! Didn't add any sugar, didn't need it because the apples are sweet enough.  I did have a little extra liquid, but I just mixed it in and it's alright. Very easy. Also, didn't need to mash it - just stirred it after cooking and it was perfect!

I love the flavor and ease of this recipe, although....I doubled just the apples and used 1/2 cup of apple cider instead of water.  Sugar and cinnamon were to taste.  I'm so glad I found your recipe because I've been wanting to make applesauce for a long time.

I love this simple recipe. So much so that I made a bunch and put it in the freezer for eating throughout the winter months. I didn't add the Cinnamon this time but will next time.

I used 4 apples. Before I mashed them, I felt like there was too much liquid left so I strained most of it out (the sauce would have been too runny), then decided to use the extra liquid for another apple. If I make this recipe again I'll just use 5 apples in the first place, or use less of the other ingredients. So, the ingredient ratio wasn't right for me, but once I fixed that, It came out really good!

Followed recipe exact.  I used a electric mixer instead of potato masher. Texture was more like traditional apple sauce.  I have 5 teenagers and they loved it.  Excellent!

This is a  fantastic recipe especially if you are on the BRAT diet. My advice would be however don't use a gas stove or have it at the lowest heat possible. My apples were so burnt!

I went to the orchard on saturday and needed to use up some of the apples so I decided to make homemade applesauce. I used this recipe and it turned out great. I actually doubled the recipe and like a previous reviewer I also cooked mine in the slow cooker. I like my apple sauce a bit on the chunky style instead of all smoothly blended. But using this recipe will work for any style you like. Super easy.

I made this twice so far. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious but way too sweet for applesauce. It tasted more like pie filling. The second time I made a big batch and tripled all the ingredients except the sugar which I only doubled. I also used penzeys baking spice in place of cinnamon. It was perfect! I will be making this again and again.

Just wonderful, and even better on the 2nd and 3rd day (didn't last any longer than that).  I added a dash of nutmeg to mine, but that was the only change I made.

My family was spoiled a long time ago and will not eat "baby smooth applesauce", they want chunks.  I have made this several times and it always delicious.  In a hurry I have also cooked the apples in the microwave.  For a change I have also added cinnamon candies to the sauce to give it an extra zip.

Wow!
Super easy, super yummy. I had to cook a bit longer since I doubled the recipe. I also drained most of the liquid and reserved to add in as I used the food processor to blend it. This gave me the perfect consistency for us and, BONUS, extra apple juice for drinking!

I have made this recipe about 4 times so far since July (now Sept) and it hits the spot every time. I do add just a touch more cinnamon per our liking, but it is really good. Even my husband who hates applesauce eats it. One thing that I do change is to put it in the crock pot and double the batch. Set it on high and forget it. I do come back and stir it about once every hour but after 3 hours it is perfectly soft. After that I put it in my nutra bullet and blend the heck out of it. Smooth consistency and well worth the wait.

If you mix apples with sugar and let them sit for an hour or two, the apples will give juice and you won't need any water.

Good simple recipe.  I used a little less than 1/4 cup turbinado instead of white sugar and cooked it about 5 minutes longer so the apples mashed very easily.  Will definitely make this again, thinking about adding some strawberries or ginger powder next time!

Love it! Super easy, simple ingredients. I typically buy sugar free applesauce for my daughter, so I omitted it here as well. You get all the fresh apple flavor and the cinnamon, tastes great.

I’ve been making this recipe for years. To me it’s quicker than going to the store to buy applesauce. When I lived in western New York, I was in apple county. Each fall I would make a very large batch or 2. This freezes very well. Thanks for a great quick and easy recipe.

I had no idea how tasty homemade applesauce would be. The best part is the aroma. The taste is smooth and not too sweet. I'd highly recommend.

This was my first time making applesauce and it turned out great! The types of apples you use makes a difference. I mixed several different types that are recommended for applesauce such as Empire, Cortlandt, Fuji, Jonagold, and McIntosh. My family loved it. Thanks phatcat!!

I didn't add any sugar as I wanted it more tart and less sugary but the cinnamon was a great touch
I added along with the apples - pears and strawberries
Fruit sauce I guess but this recipe gave me the inspo!

This my first batch of homemade applesauce. My children asked me to make it for them. Next time I am going to make more variations to include sugar-free, and no cinnamon. No more grocery store applesauce.

This applesauce was wonderful! I have tried a few different recipes, and none of them had quite the right texture. I used six medium Red Delicious apples for 1.5 times the recipe, and I cooked them about 35 minutes to get them as soft as I needed them. Then, I blended the mixture in the food processor and, voila! The perfect applesauce :-)

Haven't used commercial applesauce in years!  You got apples--make this applesauce.  So easy and so good.  Going to add cranberries next time.

Luv this Applesauce! I added peeled roughly cut fuji’s up to the fill line in our 8qt InstantPot along with 2 cups of water, 2tsp cinnamon and the juice of 2 lemons. No sweetener needed! Set for 10 mins on manual with natural decompression time of 20 mins. Delicious! Especially served warm!
This is a new family favorite!

I cannot get enough of this recipe!!! I find myself making a double batch every Sunday!! The only change I make is to cut the water in half as many orders reviews suggested and to split the sugar in half, half white and half brown. I usually will to in a little extra cinnamon or apple pie spice well. Everyone loves this applesauce!!! Simple and delicious.

I doubled this recipe but kept the same amount of sugar.  I like applesauce on the tart side.  I lightly mashed the apples so that the sauce has a toothsome texture that stands up to a hearty main dish.

I just used this recipe and reviews as a guide for apple: water ratio and timing in crockpot.  I used gala apples, cranberries, cinnamon, no sugar, water in crock pot for 3.5 hours.  Mashed this and chilled. Perfect consistency.  We loved it and so did my 10 month old grandson.

I was disappointed with the ingredients in this recipe, actually, more sad than anything. One quarter cup of sugar? Why? I made the apple sauce without adding sugar. It was delicious, a 5* dish.

A simple and wonderful recipe that made an awesome first attempt at apple sauce for me. Thank you.  I used gala apples so it took more than 20 minutes for them to cook down.  I also substituted honey for the sugar and it came out great.  I used an immersion blender to make it smooth as I prefer it.  It was a little watery, so I cooked it a bit more.  I quickly found though that I had to leave the lid partially covering the pot, because bubbling smooth apple sauce can fly!  I then just turned off the heat, left it uncovered and stirred occasionally till all the remaining steam dissipated.  Perfection.

Hello, I am new here and I am a French. 

So it is my first recipe all English because I learn English. 

The recipe is very easy, and my son and me we have liked the taste.

Merci ;)

This is a simple recipe that doesn't require a lot of ingredients.  I've made this applesauce quite a few times, using 4 fairly large apples, & a different variety each time, depending on sale prices!  So far I've used Braeburn, Fugi, Pacific Rose, Gala, Jazz, Pink Lady.  Since they're all fairly sweet, I only add about half of the sugar, & used twice the cinnamon, maybe a bit more, depending on personal taste.   When the apples are tender, I mash them with a potato masher & leave a few chucks.  Chill & serve the next day!

Good recipe for applesauce, but needs some tweaks. I had a ton of apples to use up and found adding extra apples was needed (see second most helpful review). Although I scaled up the recipe, the first result was too sweet--made as written. The second time around, I used just less than half the amount of sugar and it was fine by us. Used a mixture of Macs and Cortland apples, which are sweeter though...so, keep that in mind if you try to make this recipe...with tart apples amount of sugar might be ok; with sweeter apples use less sugar. It also seemed a little soupy to me, but I just let it keep cooking down. Next time I'll use less water. I will make this again for a quick and easy applesauce, with some minor adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

This is pretty basic, but I wanted to have it in my recipes to remind me to make it. I don't put sugar in mine and it was still sweet. Depends on the type of apples you use. I used Galas.

I made this applesauce and it was delicious.  Taking advice from others I didn't add that much sugar, maybe 1/8 c.  I also only used 1/2 cup of water.   I used red and golden delicious apples as that is what I had.  I will definitely make it again.  Not going to buy canned applesauce anymore, I find them too sweet.  I can adjust the flavor and sweetness by using different type of apples. I also can control the texture!

Used 6 Fuji apples, one cup of water, 1/4 cup sugar and a tsp of cinnamon. It was fantastic. For my next batch I will probably cook it on a lower heat for longer. Thanks for the recipe!

It was fun to make for my family and their girlfriends.  They never had homemade apple sauce before.

I made this for my son after he had his wisdom teeth removed. He loved it and ended up living on it for several days.   It was so easy and so quick to make, it left me wondering why I don't do it more often.  My new "go to" recipe for a simple, delicious applesauce!

The recipe allows you to control how much sugar you add. The first time I added 3 sugar packets and a tbsp of maple sugar. The second time I completely eliminated the sugar. I never know how east it is to make applesauce, so this recipe helped me a lot so I give it 5 stars

I made this applesauce recipe last night to go with our dinner.  My husband and I thought it was delicious!  I did cut back on the water to 1/2 cup because I like my applesauce on the thick side.  Since my husband is diabetic, I used 2 tablespoons of Truvia Cane Sugar Blend in place of the white sugar.  It was just right...not too sweet...just sweet enough.  I will definitely make this again:)

I've made this at least four times now. I'll often add a tablespoon or two of lemon juice to this, and/or leave out the sugar entirely. It's so simple and tastes great!

Wonderful!  My kiddos loved it!  I did halve the sugar in the recipe and it was still super sweet, so definitely adjust the sugar based on the sweetness of the apples your'e using.  Will definitely make it again!

Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe! It turns out great every time and is a terrific way to use up any apple that's just past its prime. Tastes delish using any apple.

Turned out great! I’m at a higher altitude, so added a Tbs or so more water. Next time I might add a bit more. The flavor was perfect.

Quick and easy! Made it often, and use it as a spread on toast, and even on ice cream instead of commercial sauces.

I made this as written, but feel that  it was heavy on sugar and cinnamon (and I like cinnamon!)  Next time I make it I will reduce both by half.

Pretty good recipe. I used 5 apples instead of 4 and added a little more of each spice. It was a little too sweet afterwards so I added nutmeg and more cinnamon - perfect! Didn’t have a ton of luck with the hand masher or fork so I used my food processor (great consistency!)

Not only have I never eaten applesauce, I've also never made it until tonight. To my sock it was much better than I expected, my fella loved it too! That says a lot since he loves everything from a can and said this was the best he has ever had.  It was so easy, and I used organic sugar and apples so I feel like the flavor was even more heightened. Will be making this again will grilled pork chops soon!

Followed this recipe mostly, except I added much more cinnamon (not sure exactly how much more. I love cinnamon, so I went crazy with it), and I added approx 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg for every 4 apples.

I doubled and used 8 apples, 1/4 c.  Brown sugar and 1/4 c. White sugar. Used Granny Smith, 1 Gala and 1 honey crisp apple.  Added a little Lemon  juice.  Cooked about 30 minutes then puréed.  Delish!

you can substitute the sugar for a granulated sugar substitute and it works fine. I used only 1/4 cup of substitute and it was sweet enough.

Made this for my 8 month old son. Used 3 large Johnny Mac apples and 3/4c water. Medium heat, covered for 20 mins. They were so soft, only had to stir and find the impurities. Extremely quick and easy to make!

We make maple syrup so we have an abundance of that on hand. I deleted the 1/4 C sugar and added 1/3 C Pure Vermont Maple Syrup and it’s was delicious. Makes about 4 servings.

Made this with some modifications.... (1) I did not add much in the way of water because apples are naturally watery and do not require the extra water. I found adding any water at all was unnecessary. Tip- removing the lid from the pot allowed more water to burn off when it got too watery. (2) I reduced the sugar significantly and sweetened to taste once they were cooked down - apples can vary is sweetness though (3) I cooked the apples at a a medium low setting and they cooked for more like an hour. (4) doubled the cinnamon.

AMAZING!! I had a big grocery bag full of apples from a neighbour, and decided to make applesauce for my horse (instead of buying it for him every week) because he needs it to take medicine. I did 4x the sugar and cinnamon for the amount of apples I had, and made an oopsie cooking!! I only cooked the apples in the water, 20 minutes was perfect. Then drained **most** of the water out, poured the sugar mixture in and OMG it turned out perfectly. I've never made applesauce before,  and I barely cook! Super easy and lots of room for mistakes or adding your own ideas!

Basic home style applesauce like I learned to make from my mother. Suggestions I would add would be to add half the sugar taste the applesauce after the apples were softened by cooking and adjust to personal taste. I use cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon so you don't end up with brown applesauce, again personal preference. For 4 to 5 apples I find half a stick  gives the hint of cinnamon we like.

The apples were sweet enough that we could have omitted the sugar, but my family LOVED this recipe, made from apples right off our own tree. Highly recommended this simple, fresh recipe.

I loved this apple recipe.  So easy and very tasty!  I love applesauce with pork chops but kept forgetting to buy!  Had some apples and decided to look up homemade applesauce and very glad I did.  Didn't change anything, which I tend to do!  Thank you

This recipe is too good to be true. It is just so simple! I used gala apples, but the result was a little bit sweeter than I wanted. I can't wait to try this again with granny smith apples for a tart flavor!

Too much cinnamon wish I'd cut it in half as my sauce came out  completely brown red. I agree that the sugar is overdone as well. Really easy tho just need to measure according to personal taste.

I LOVED THIS! I used 3 Grannies and 1 Jazz Apple , I followed recipe to the t until I tasted it and thought it was a bit to tarty for my liking , so I doubled the sugar. It was PERFECT, and it took a total of twenty min and I have found my go to recipe from here on out for applesauce. Thank You!

Loved It!  Used Honeycrisp apples and cooked it in a crockpot and my home smelled delicious.  Best applesauce ever.  Will never buy ready made again.

The applesauce turned out delicious.  I used Granny Smith apples which are tart but compensated with a bit more sugar and cinnamon.  I enjoyed making the applesauce and my family ate it up almost as soon as I made it!

I doubled the apples, and used the same amount of water, and it was still too much water.  Also, I didn't add any sugar b/c quite frankly, it didn't need it.  My kids ate 6 apples worth in one sitting!

Halved the recipe because I only had 2 apples.  Followed recioe exactly, came out fabulous.  Had to take the cover off and cook down to desired consistency after rough mash of the apples.  
stirred some into my mashed potatoes with peas  accompanied with BBQ country style spare ribs and went straight to nirvana.

I loved the ease of the recipe.
I did make some adjustments. I used 6 apples, but kept the sugar and water measurements from the recipe.  I added a dash (or two) of nutmeg, ginger, and clove.
As I cut the apples, I squeezed the juice of a whole lemon over them to keep them from browning (and add flavor).

Made this applesauce to go with pork chops. The taste is delicious and sweet but it seemed a little watery. Next time I would cut the water in half.

Good recipe that mashes easily and cooks with no fuss at all. If I made it again, I'd add more cinnamon- I put in a heaping half-teaspoon and I still don't taste it quite as much as I'd like. Good for breakfast with cinnamon toast or as a snack.

I used this recipe as a guide.  I used 8 cups of apples (~10 apples), 1 2/3 C of water, substituted the sugar for 1/4 cup of honey, 1/2 T of cinnamon (we like cinnamon), 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Cooked over medium heat for about 15-18 mins.  Mashed it right off of the stove.  Let cool for about 5 mins.  Has great consistency, a great cinnamon flavor.  Going to be great with the pork loin roast for dinner.

A great combination with any pork dish.  I used part brown sugar and more cinnamon, but it’s easy to adjust any of the ingredients.  I wish all recipes were this quick and delicious!

LOVE this simple recipe!  At this point, I’ve decided that the sugar is pretty much unnecessary if you’re using decent apples. I may sprinkle a heaping teaspoon in there, but that’s plenty!

I made the recipe as is. Water amount, sugar.... all of it. Gala apples. Very satisfied with it. Made a nice/chunky sauce. I’d make this again for sure. No alternations needed for me anyway.

I got rave reviews for this simple to make apple sauce. My family requested that I omit the cinnamon and it was still amazing. I also added a small dash of salt to bring out the flavor. You will never want jarred sauce again.

I made this recipe for my 6 month old son who is just starting to eat solids. I used apples from a local orchard, which I think made all the difference! I cut out all the processed sugar the recipe asked for and it was still very sweet! Great consistency and good amount of cinnamon; I think this will become a favourite.

2nd time making this delicious recipe. I used xylitol instead of sugar. Much better for you and you can not tell the difference from sugar. I also used honeycrisp apple which have an amazing flavor. Thanks!!!

I used a mix of apples, and also added about 2 TB of brown sugar to add color (2 of the 8 apples were Granny Smith). Absolutely delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I used 3 "large" Jonagold apples.  It was fantastic!  Our boys said it was better than store bought.  It took very little time out of my day and was totally worth it!  They gobbled it up in 2 meals.

I have already made it twice.  Originally I made it with children and they all loved it, so I had to make it again.  This is not too sweet but just sweet enough.  You can always regulate the sweetness and the amount of cinnamon to put in but I used the recipe to a tee.  Delish

I used WAYYY less water and it was still too much.  I would use maybe 1/4 per 5 or 6 apples chopped next time.

Other than that this is a pretty easy recipe, just time consuming peeling and cubing apples.

I did a 4x batch with about 20 apples and it turned out delicious.  I drained a bunch of water after cooking before I started the mashing.

I really like this recipe. I know, I altered it a bit, but I just tailored a good recipe to my liking. 
I doubled it;  I used the equivalency of 8 large Macintosh apples from our tree, and 2 large, store-bought Galas, doubled the water and sugar, added a TBLSP of lemon juice,  and left out the cinnamon (which I added at serving time along with some  brown sugar, sprinkled on top ). I ended up just shy of 2 quarts!

Wonderful!!!! I used mostly macintosh apples which were plenty sweet for my taste so I omitted the sugar (and didn't miss it!) Also,  I cut the water to 1/2 cup.  Not sure why anyone would bother with a slow cooker for 3-4 hours when cooking on stovetop takes just 15-20 mins!  Very, very good. Tastes like fall!

I started making applesauce years ago when my kids and I came home from apple picking with 40 pounds of apples, uh oh! Finding things to do with the apples, I found this recipe, I have to say, I've never made it as Sarah says, I've always felt it was too much water and way too much sugar. I'll fill my crock pot with apples (about 20), then add about 1/2 cup sugar and only about 12 ounces of water. You really don't need a lot of sugar or water to make it delicious. Cook it on high for 3-4 hours and you have applesauce for a party. Don't forget the cinnamon, that's my kids favorite part.

I used brown sugar instead of white.  I doubled the recipe overall, but used only the original amount of sugar, and it was plenty sweet.  I added extra cinnamon because we like cinnamon.  Be sure to simmer long enough with the lid off the pot to boil off the excess liquid.  This was a great way to use up bruised apples.  I used HoneyCrisp.

I liked the taste and ease of making of this apple sauce so much, that I made it 2 days in row.
The apples I used were the sweet kind ( golden delicious and McIntosh) so I cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons and that was the right sweetness for my family.
The 1st time I made, I followed the advise of some reviewers and used less water than called for and that resulted in very thick apple sauce. The second time I used the exact amount of water and the consistency was just perfect for me.
I plan on making this quite often this Fall.
The one thing, I would recommend is to stay near the stove as this cooks because with the lid on, it gets foamy and  start to spillover. Removing the lid and stirring occasionally helps.

So simple to make, can be made while I'm cooking everything else for our weekly pork chop dinner. It makes any night special, and it's delicious!

Made this on the stovetop. Instead of white sugar, used brown sugar to give it a deeper sweetness. Used Penzey's Apple Pie Spice instead of cinnamon. I use my immersion blender to blend it to the desired texture. Good stuff.

I love making this recipe. The house smells great and the apple sauce tastes even better! I love that I can control the consistency, I personally like a chunky apple sauce.

This is my "go-to" recipe for applesauce.  The only change I occasionally make is to use apple cider (NOT apple juice) in place of the water.  You could also add just a pinch of nutmeg if you like.  This applesauce is one of my most requested dishes any time of year, and I always make sure I have some in the freezer.  It makes chunky rather than smooth applesauce, and that is how we like it. Be sure you use apples that are recommended for sauce; otherwise, you will find that the apples will take an exceptionally long time to "cook down."  I like to use a combination of Golden Delicious, Honey Crisp, Macintosh, Cortland, Staymen Winesap, and Granny Smith; never use Red Delicious or any other apple labeled "mainly for eating."

I used 6 lbs of apples, 1/2 c brown sugar and 2 cups water. I sliced the apples and threw them in skins, seeds and all. After cooking I ran it through a fruit strainer.  it turned out a beautiful rosy color from cooking with the skins. It made about 12 cups.

Perfect!! I ended up making alot more then needed as I was making it as a side dish for a ham I made. Like the OP said people who don't like apple sauce will love this. It's texture is way different then the store mush and tasts alot better. I also used half an half of Granny Smith and red dilicious.

The first time I made this I used listed ingredients. It was delicious!  Today, my second effort, I used juice of one lemon, 1/4 cup of whiskey and only 1/2 cup of water. And a slice of butter. It was great. My family loves the 2nd recipe I made!

To make this more diabetic friendly, I have substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I prefer using a combination of some sugar with some Splenda.

It tasted good but was way too sweat. Using less sugar will make for a much more enjoyable side dish. With this recipe, it's more like a desert.

Love this smaller portion Applesauce for 1-2 people. 
You can replace the sugar with same amount of unfiltered honey for a healthier version! Use a variety of apples for a unique flavor.  I plan on buying a sieve so I can cook with skins on for maximizing all the nutrients. Optional: use a sieve to remove the tough skins.  ;)

6.10.17   OK, I have to admit I did make some changes.  I’ve been making homemade applesauce FOREVER (so it seems), and I do in the microwave.  We’re not into sugar much these days, so I did cut the sugar way back (my apples were plenty sweet on their own), and we like our applesauce chunky, so I didn’t mash much.  The biggest change is that I cooked this in the microwave, covered, on high for 5 minutes...boom, done!  Honestly, I really don’t think you need a recipe for this, but if it helps some folks, so be it.  Ended up tasting good.

I've tried it as written, and it's good.  I also used Jules' tip with putting it in the slow cooker.  I find that the amounts of water and sugar needed depends on the type/ripeness of apple used.  I use firm gala apples, water and sugar as written (brown sugar works great), and sometimes add 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Either cook it on the stove as written or follow Jules' directions and dump it all in the slow cooker and it comes out great!!!

I made this for my 11 month old so I did not add in the sugar & honestly you would never have missed it. Aside from not adding in the sugar I followed the recipe as written. It smelled amazing while it was cooking.  He devoured it and I found it to be rather tasty myself. For a chunkier applesauce I would reduce the water by half.  Excellent recipe but may be to sweet as written.

While I would definitely make this again, I would not use as much water. I ended up having to drain out a lot of the juice to get the consistency I wanted (much like the store brand). I also pulsed it in my blender using the food processor attachment. I used a whole bag of Fuji apples, which was the equivalent of tripling the recipe. After draining out all the juice, I added some back in, along with a little water, and the sweetness was perfect. My husband and one year old absolutely loved it! Can't wait to eat it chilled!

I subbed in just shy of 1/4 cup of Organic Honey in place of the White Sugar.  In addition, I cooked in an Instant Pot, using Manual setting, High Pressure and cook time of 7 minutes.  For the Instant Pot, turn off immediately after cooking and let it naturally cool down.  If you try and vent the steam, it will spew out apple sauce!

Everyone loves this applesauce. But some of my family like a smoother applesauce so I put it into my food processor to take out the lumps. The flavor is perfectly delicious.

My hubby loves applesauce, but he is a picky eater, so usually only will eat Motts brand.  I made this for him while he was out of the house and he loved it.  I know this recipe doesn't say healthy but I dropped it one star because of the excessive use of sugar. Cut that in half and you have the same delicious snack that is healthy too

Made it without the cinnamon since I will be using it as a substitute for butter in cakes and cinnamon changes the flavor too much. It was perfect, not too sweet at all imo.

Such a simple and delicious recipe! I love that I can make it as chunky or smashed as I want. I think I'll slowly reduce the sugar moving forward depending on the apples. :)

Terrific every time. I used Vitamix to grind up raw apples into smooth purée. Cooked it as directed and it's terrific. I upped the cinnamon as I like a little more. I reduce the sugar by half, but add some Stevia to help keep the sweetness without all the calories.

Might as well add my 5 stars to everyone else's -- this recipe deserves the accolades.  There are fancier versions of applesauce one can make, but for quickness, ease, and consistently delicious results, this one is a total winner.

Very good. I've used another applesauce recipe for years but will be using this going forward. I reduced the sugar by about a 1/3, jusy because I prefer unsweetened sauce.

I was motivated to make applesauce after searching for am apple recipe to serve with pork tenderloin. Reading reviews sometimes helps, sometimes not.  I tried the crock pot...ended up just putting it on stove top to cook because after 3 hours it was just finally getting hot. I think adding sugar depends totally on what kind of apple you use. I made it with gala apples and only added cinnamon, no sugar. It was great. More or less water depends on how thick you like your sauce.

This is really good... with a couple of caveats. First, I used six small apples. I used the recommended amounts of water and sugar, and otherwise followed the instructions. It came out REALLY sweet. Don't get me wrong- it was good. But husband and I found it way too sweet to snack on, and ended up serving it warm, over nonfat vanilla frozen yogurt. REALLY good that way. If I were to make this again, especially to eat in a non-dessert way, I'd cut down on the sugar or even eliminate it completely. As a dessert topping, though, very good as-is.

my family can't get enough of this applesauce.  I now make it several times in the fall, and quadruple the recipe or more.  I also make it in the crock pot.  When quadrupling, I do not increase the water at all.  I also cut down on the sugar  per each time I double the recipe (so if making 8  apples, might only add 2/3 C sugar, might not go much over 1C for a quadrupled batch (my apple trees are red and yellow delicious so they are pretty sweet to being with so I've been trying to see how little sugar is the right amount).  And for personal preference, I use brown sugar instead of white.

I made no changes and this recipe came out great!  I was a little unsure of the amount of water, so once it started to simmer, I took the lid off. I used a potato masher, which was less work than a fork. It had a good consistency and flavor.

Loved this! Used it as a reference. Replaced sugar w/  organic honey & blackstrap molasses (just a tsp -eyeballed) also added ginger w/ the cinnamon. Turned out amazing. Used less water also.

As a result of my use of this recipe, I am now the President for Life, Seven Star General, Emperor of All Things Applesauce.  I love it, so I bought a crank operated apple peeler, slicer, corer so I can make 3 tons of this applesauce without getting too tired.

Just two slight things:
1. You can use less sugar.
2. You do not really need water, as the apples contain much water.  I even drained the applesauce a bit so it would thicken

I followed this very simple recipe and it's delicious! The store bought stuff is complete junk compared to this. It's not as watery as the other stuff so you can eat it with a fork. Thank you so much.

I use this as a reference all the time (because I can never remember or make things up as I go!) I added it to the notes on my phone so it is always available. I usually do 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp pumpkin spice. But it is a great recipe to start with!

I used this recipe as a guide.  Let my senses, smell, sight, taste dictate the rest. 
Also added vanilla and small amt light brown sugar. 
AWESOME.  Also don't waste time chop into small pieces, mashes VERY EASILY

This is a very good applesauce. I canned this sauce, so when I made this I did everything times 6 as to what the recipe called for. I also used some Apple cider to add more flavor and less water

I made a double recipe using granny smith apples and 1 honey crisp apple.  Allowed it to boil for about 10 minutes then let it simmer until the apples were soft.  I lightly mashed it so the apple sauce was chunky then simmered for another until a bit longer.  Perfect!  My husband likes it cold and raved about it.  It is great warm too.

Excellent applesauce and easy to make! I quadrupled the recipe to freeze several bags. The only thing I did differently was to use brown sugar. Yummy!

I made this with my mom and it turned out amazing! We used 1/16 of a cup of sugar and 1 tbsp of cinnamon. And, we used a slow cooker. It turned out so good and we are very very happy with this applesauce. I like how it uses ingredients that are just lying around the kitchen, and it saves money buying applesauce at the store. It tastes a lot better than store bought as well. 5 stars all the way!! I highly recommend this recipe :))

It's good. It's easy.
The amount of sugar should be varied, depending on how sweet your apples are. Use a bit less and add after tasting.
I added a splash of vanilla.

Love this recipe. It is also wonderful to add Red Hots (enough to make the sauce red) while it's cooking and eliminate the sugar and cinnamon (or add a little bit according to taste).

Fast and simple recipe and it tastes delicious. We cut the sugar in half and its still great. Used half granny smith and half gala apples. We read somewhere about mixing sour and sweat apples to get a good even flavor and it worked. Made a 4x size batch and it netted 5 pint jars.

I just made this tonight while looking for a quick side dish.  The recipe itself is simple and easy to follow and the results were amazing.  There wasn't any of this left over.  Some have complained about the sugar content in this recipe but to me that wasn't an issue, as sugar in moderation is okay and we're not guzzling gallons of sugar throughout the day.  A little bit of sugar isn't going to kill us here.  The only thing I added to this recipe was 3 pinches of all-spice.  Very delicious recipe!!!

Easy, delicious!  The only thing I want to comment on is the fact that the cooking time was not accurate for me at least. Mine took at least two times the suggested time but well worth the wait. I did chop my apples as the recipe directs so I'm not sure what I did different. Yummy though!

I didn't add sugar & used less water like another user suggested. It came out pretty good. I'm using honey crisp so I think they're sweet enough but I might add a little honey this time. I ran it through my ninja blender so it was super smooth.

Delicious. Definitely easy to make. 
However, with 14 apples diced into small pieces for the sole purpose of helping the apples to cook more quickly, it still took 40 minutes for the apples to cook properly. 
The neighbors I shared it with loved it, too.

I jazzed it up a little. Brown sugar (a little less than called for), Zest from one lemon and juice from that lemon, two chunks of ginger and a cinnamon stick. Pulled the ginger and cinnamon out before mashing.
I will never buy apple sauce again. I hope it don't eat it all before dinner.

I made this apple sauce and i followed the directions but it turned into apples floating in sweet water.  then i had the inspiration to put it in the blender after it had been cooked and all and it turned out one of the best apple sauce i have EVER had!!!  Love it and will defiantly use this recipe again.
Lol!  Our house keeper added milk to her's and it was sooooo weird!!!

Was even better after putting it in the blender. Correct ratio of sugar and water. Used Ginger Golds, which are a thin skinned, sweet-tangy apple.

This turned out just fanTAStic.  Although I hate it when people change the recipes......I changed the recipe.  I simply used a bit less water (1/4 cup per batch instead of 3/4) and honey instead of the sugar. Our apples were fresh off the tree though, and very juicy.  And I just find the sweetness from honey is "softer" somehow than granular sugar.  Regardless, this is a super simple, delicious recipe even I didn't screw up!!

I made this in the crockpot, on high for just a couple hours. It was excellent. I will double or maybe even triple next time. My daughter loved it!

First I read the reviews and adjust the recipe for the 10 apples I picked from our tree:  10 apples, 1 cup water (ample), 1/2 cop white sugar,  and a scant 1 teaspoon cinnamon. brought to a slow boil then covered and cooked for 15 min - awesome ! My  tree is loaded this year so I will be doing this again !

I don't normally like apple sauce, but we have an apple tree out front so I thought I would at least make it for my family. I tried it for myself and it was the best apple sauce ever! It tasted so much different from the canned stuff at the store, everyone else loved it as well. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I have used this recipe several times.  I do not peel the apples and I use Agave (Amber or Blue) instead of white sugar.  Be careful when using Agave , it is sweeter than white sugar (2/3 C of Agave = 1 C of sugar).  Consistently good!

I actually put all of the ingredients (with one extra apple) in a small slow cooker and set it to low for about six hours and it was amazing. No mashing necessary. Loved it!

I only used to apples just because I needed something quick to go with my porkchops. Just the two of us. Very easy to make. I only cooked it for half the time and it was perfect. Once the apples are  soft you really don't need to mash it too much.

Excellent recipe! I altered it by using apple cider instead of water, used a small piece of a cinnamon stick and mashed it with a fork because I wanted a chunky applesauce. My guests enjoyed it with smothered fried pork chops! This is a keeper!

Made a triple batch for our large family, and to use up the huge amount of apples we had. Decreased sugar a bit, and left it a little chunky. SO GOOD. Definitely making again!

I made this with some apples I froze a couple months ago. I partially defrosted two gallon size bags of sliced/cored apples, added 1 cup of water, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 cup of sugar, and a splash of lemon juice. After cooking it on the stove for 20 min. I let it cool and then blended it with my blender. It turned out great!

Wonderful recipe it tastes marvelous. The only problem with this desert like treat is that depending on the apple you won't end up with very much food, however it tastes good and is a great desert!!!

After cooking on medium for 20 minutes, the apples were still difficult to mash, so I dumped it all into the blender. The applesauce was delicious, although I ruined it by going a little crazy on the sugar.

So easy and delicious! I used much less sugar than the recipe calls for because we're not huge sugar fans. I suggest making the recipe without the sugar and adding it to taste as the apples cook. Some apples are sweet enough that you may not even need it.

I did not change a thing, other than a lesser amount of sugar. It was fantastic. I used 4 large honey crisp apples and received raves. It was not soupy at all, in fact much thicker than store bought.

I have already made this four times, each a different amount. Six apples, eight apples, anything! The one problem I have is the water. Please note, if you use very juicy apples you almost need no water at all! If you use dryer ones, use the amount listed. Honestly, I think that the water listed a little too much. Mashing the apples takes time too, so I advise using a tool,  or just cooking it longer. Either way, this applesauce was very good!

Made this a while back and we loved it! Even my little guy who won't touch Jared, or the squeeze pouch apple sauce gobbled this up! Thanks for the recipe ?? Making tonight because my little guy just had a palette expander put in and in need of soft foods that won't get stuck in it.

I have to agree with most of these reviews saying this was too sweet. Although after I split the sugar in half, it tasted pretty good.

Wonderful recipe! I've made it several times and it is positively delicious. I'd suggest using a food processor to puree rather than a fork to mash, but otherwise it's amazing!

I did not make any changes as I believe all recipes should be followed exactly as written for the first attempt.  Very much recipe and I will definitely be making this again in the future as well as sharing with family members.

My entire family loves this!! I'm rating it a 5 when following the recipe exactly. With that being said, we love sweets in my house. If you are looking for less sweet or less sugar, I've made it without and it was just as good.

Made it yesterday and loved it with some changes.  Used 6 Gala apples, 1/2 cup water, tsp cinnamon and fresh nutmeg and NO sugar!  Galas are sweet and they didn't need any added sugar.  Thanks for posting.

I make this for almost every dinner and party. Applesauce seems like a hard recipe, but no! All you need is sugar, apples, water, and cinnamon. I found that the measurements for this recipe is very accurate.  One thing I did do though (I did this on accident) was add about 50% more cinnamon that was in the recipe, the result was very good!

I thought it was super easy. I wanted to make a chunky sauce because all you can find in the stores is like baby food.  I thought this was way too sweet, and next time I'll make it without sugar and just rely on the sweetness of the apples. If it's too tart, I'll add half the sugar and go from there.  Otherwise, perfection.

I would definitely  make this again! I doubled the apples, used 1 1/4 cup water, just over 1/3 cup sugar and 3/4 tsp cinnamon. I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp vanilla. Medium heat for 30 mins.

Made it per recipe once and with brown sugar once. Grandkids liked both ways. I prefer the brown sugar but I do cut down the amount of brown sugar by about half.  Two year old granddaughter declared it "delicimuss".

Geeat recipe, as this is my second time ever making applesauce.  I used a crockpot as suggested, and tripled the recipe.  I used 2 cups of water, cut the cinnamon in half because I didn't want my applesauce dark brown.  I used both white and brown sugar, with a small squeeze of lemon juice.  I also used 2 drops of vanilla extract, and 1 drop of lemon extract.  What you must do is an hour into the cooking time, stir the apples and check the liquid content.  If your apples seem to be swimming in liquid, POOR some into a container (it is great apple juice/cider!)  Continue cooking, while checking and stirring frequently.  As the apples produce more and more liquid, continue to poor it in the container.  I preferably don't like soupy applesauce, that's why pouring the juice off is important.

I multiplied this recipe by 1.5 (because of the no. of apples I had).  It was good, but a too sweet for my tastes.  I am sure my kids will love it.

I've made this a few times now and am always pleased with the results.  It's a great way to use up those not so good looking apples.  I've used it without the cinnamon to make Jelly candies as well keeping it really chunky for the sausage and applesauce recipe on this site as well.  Very adaptable for different uses.

It's hard to go wrong with applesauce! These directions do the trick. I decided to use this with a bag of not-very-delicious old and bruised Red Delicious apples that I had bought by mistake. Didn't add any sugar and used extra cinnamon. After chilling in the fridge, the result is a wonderful yogurt topping.

My family was never into applesauce until I served them applesauce made from this recipe. In addition to having it as a side with our meal, we love having it as a dessert. Would give it 6 stars, if possible.

Not sure why I've been buying applesauce from the store! So simple & I can control what goes in (more importantly, what doesn't!).  I'll be experimenting with the amount of sugar, I usually like mine less sweet.

I made this for my step son to have for school lunches. I followed directions exactly, and in the end added a little more cinnamon. I'd say I probably doubled the cinnamon. He loved and so did I!

Great, easy, simple recipe. Mine was a tad too sweet, but the apples I used were very juicy. Next time I will cut the sugar down a wee bit. I added a bit more cinnamon and some allspice. Very, very good. Thank you.

I made this a few days ago. It is so yummy. I did mess up making it and because of that I needed to add more water but it still turned out great; my baby sister just loves this applesauce.

I always make big batches of this recipe  but i add a little more cinnamon for more of a kick. When  i chop the apples up i always make sure that they are thinly chopped since it helps make it less chunky in the end, when it is done boiling i allow for a few minutes to cool down. I always tend to use a little hand mixer to smooth out the chunks  instead of mashing it with a fork or a potato masher, it saves on time and it comes out with a better result. Ive tried this recipe at least 4 times, first following it to a T but my family just likes it more smooth and some more cinnamon but this is defiantly a keeper

Delish! And so easy. It made the kitchen smell amazing! I made it as is, except I quartered the recipe cause I just wanted one serving to try. I eyeballed the cinnamon and added some extra cause I love cinnamon. Could probably have done without the extra. ;) Great recipe! Would totally make this again!

I just needed to check measurements when making applesauce. I had about 50 apples in a box to use up- red and gold delicious. I used 2/3 c. sugar and a little less water than called for in the recipe-a little less cinnamon and a splash of vanilla- cooking it now on high in the slow cooker- filled a large oval slow cooker to the brim- plan on canning it in pints.

Amazing recipe.  If you boil the apples, spices and water long enough, you don't need to mash the apples.  I quadrupled this recipe and jarred it (family of 6) and everyone loved it.  Will make again soon! Down to 2 jars already.  I did add other spices like nutmeg and allspice that I would normally do to an apple pie to make it a bit spicier.  Came out amazing.  Very easy to make.

This is a great base recipe, just waiting for me to change it a little. One big change that I made was instead of water and sugar, I just used apple cider. It really enhances the apple flavor, especially since I didn't use great apples. I also put in more cinnamon, and added honey. After the apples  were soft, I used an immersion blender and it made it really smooth. DELICIOUS!

Well, I have an abundance of apples here-  all different kinds- Transparents, Macs, Jonnies, and Northern Spy.  I was canning applesauce, and decided to mix this variety, and multiplied the recipe x10.   Because some of the apple were more juicy than others, I used only 6c of water; sugar ended up needing only 3 c.  I used raw sugar.   The Spy is a very hard apple, and doesn't mash easily. So, I took the emulsion blender to it.  I left a few chunks, and it was fabulous!  My son absolutely LOVED it. So did DH, and all the other kids. So, its a keeper!  I will be on my third batch tomorrow, for canning. =)  Just keep in mind, that the amount of sugar and water will be largely dependent on what type of apples you use.

Made this today with 5 Honeycrisp apples because that's what I had. I used 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 2 tablespoons stevia,  the cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of water, put in crock pot on high for 3.5 hrs. It was a little watery so I drained it a little and blended it with my stick blender. Wow it is good, I will never buy applesause in a jar again!

Excellent and simple applesauce! I substituted 1 tbsp honey for the sugar. I also took the peel and baked it around 200F for an hour or so to make apple peel chips. It's a good way to not waste the most nutritious part of the apple. If you want, you can coat them in cinnamon sugar, but I just left them as is.

It was way too sweet for me and my family. Next time, I won't use any sugar at all. It was a good recipe, with a good amount of cinnamon, but too sweet.

Simple and delicious recipe! I didn't even have to mash up the apples after cooking- after 15-20 minutes they were deliciously soft. I also found the amounts of sugar, water and cinnamon to be perfect. At first it seemed like a lot of water, but it turned out to be just right:) Thanks for the simple recipe!

I have made this recipe to many times to count always following it exactly without a problem.  It gets rave reviews from adults and children alike.  Hint:  add 1/2 cup to your favorite carrot cake recipe even if it has oil in it and you will see  a big difference in the moistness of the cake!

This is the real deal applesauce - don't change a thing.  Great as a topping, a filling, hot on vanilla ice cream and perfect just on its own.
Good job, Sarah.

Easy and tasty.  The type of apple you use will determine how much sugar you will need to add.  If you are using sweet apples then of course you would reduce the amount of sugar.  I don't think it is necessary to give this recipe less stars because you had to adjust the amount of sugar.  You can make any applesauce as sweet or less sweet as you want.

It was amazing! Probably the best applesauce I've ever had. My husband always has apples in the fridge and there were a few he wasn't going to eat before they went bad. So I figured applesauce for desert would be a good idea. It made a decent number of servings.

I did add extra cinnamon because I love it, but it ended up being just a tad bit much. So I think I'll just follow the recipe exactly next time. Also, I used granny smith apples because that's what I had on hand. It gave it a nice tartness!

My family loved this applesauce.  My husband is diabetic so I tweeked it a bit.  Used combination of Gala, Honeycrisp, and Fuji apples (what I had and plus they are sweet too), and I substituted the sugar for Stevia in the Raw.  I also doubled the cinnamon, because we are cinnamon lovers.  It was fabulous!

This was delicious! My cousin is also on this site and reccomended it to me. I will try it with Splenda to make it free on WW. It is soooooo much better than store bought, heavenly with a bit of whipped cream, on top of pancakes. Mmmmm...

Had a bunch of apples that needed to be used up.  Used 12 apples - peeled, sliced and put in the slow cooker.  1/2 cup sugar, 1 full tsp of cinnamon and 1 cup water.  On high for 3 hours.  Used potato masher to mash up.  Worked great and tasted even better!  A great way to use up apples and so easy!

I had some green apples and wanted to try to make apple sauce ,I came across this recipe. Very easy to make, cooked over a low heat until soft but the only difference I made was to add some fresh lemon juice. I'm proud of myself for my first attempt and this recipe. So easy to make and taste yummy

I made this for Easter to accompany Ham.  I was very pleased with the results. My nephew and brother-in-law had seconds! I will add some nutmeg also next time and maybe less cinnamon. I used fuji and macintosh apples.  Very easy and adds a nice touch to dinner without a lot of fuss.

Great recipe! I put the cooked mixture in my magic bullet and it made it a nice creamy texture. I thought it was a tad bit too sweet but next time I will add less sugar. Very yummy over all!

I just made this recipe, but used two 3 lb bags, 1 cup of water, 1 cup of sugar and almost 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and it came out excellent! The apples were peeled and sliced and they cooked to mush with some chunks. I may put in a blender. I have not decided yet.

Yum! I have never made applesauce before and this was excellent! I cut back on the water, sugar and upped the cinnamon. I dumped it all in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours and mashed with a potato masher. Will make often!

I always want something sweet along with eating chicken and I didn't have anything, was out of applesauce.  I found some apples that were drying up a bit in the fridge and made this recipe.  I read the reviews about it being too sweet and too much water after I had put the apples on to cook.  Easy remedy, I drained the water off and mashed the apples with a fork and then whisked them a little.  I left out the cinnamon because I like applesauce plain.  Its GOOD ENOUGH with no additives!  It was wonderful, loved it!   The apples were red delicious apples and I'm sure the sugar in the water sweetened them up a bit, even though it was drained before mashing.  I will DEFINATELY make this again.  What a wonderful way to use up apples that aren't so great to eat, but are wonderful when sauced!

Really very good! Love that it's chunky. And, as another reviewer noted, it IS better cold than warm. If you eat it warm, you're going to be disappointed.

I just made this applesauce today for my daughter and son who had their wisdom teeth out yesterday.  I only added 1/2 cup of water and 1 tbsp of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  My kids loved it and it was a wonderful food to eat when they couldn't chew.  I also used my immersion blender to make it smooth.  They loved it!!

First time making applesauce and my family thought this was delicious. I used four large apples, so I kept the sugar the same (didn't find it too sugary at all), added a little bit more cinnamon. The texture was perfect too!

This is the perfect recipe for a simple and quick dessert (especially on those Fall days when you've picked way too many apples at the orchard, and need a great apple recipe). Didn't seem too sweet or watery, so I have to differ with some of the other ratings. This is a dessert the whole family can enjoy, and tastes best warm, just after it's finished simmering.

I read several reviews before starting and decided to cut back water and sugar - thank goodness. I used 8 apples, 1 1/4 c water, 1/4 c sugar & 1 tsp cinnamon. Heated for 25 mins and apples were perfectly "mashable". It was perfect, will be making this again with those adjustments.

This was soo good! I cooked mine in the crockpot for 4 hours on high per someone' suggestion on here. I also added a dash of vanilla extract, very yummy. Too much water though. I think the next time I make it I'll decrease it to 1/2 - 1 cup. Other than that, fabulous!

Very good!  Simple and easy.  I'm sure the water level depends on the apples...I simmered it just a few minutes after I mashed the apples to get the desired constancy.  This makes about 2 c...or 1 pint jar full.  Doesn't require a lot of effort to keep some on hand.

This is my first time making applesauce and it was awesome! Easy and delicious!! I doubled the recipe (used all Fuji) and added more cinnamon. The orchard person told me that Jonagold usually made sweeter applesauce and most kids would like it so I might try using Jonagold next time. Also I might try no sugar next time though, only water and cinnamon :)

Easy.  For cortlands, I didn't chop and they mushed when stirred.  I reduced amount of sugar and water.

I had no idea making applesauce was this easy!  I tripled the recipe and omitted sugar.  One the apples were done, I mashed them with an immersion blender and added Truvia for sweetness. Wonderful!

Excellent applesauce! I didn't use as much water, since apples have a bunch in them, but this will be a go-to, from this picky eater!

Very good and super easy!  Might cut back to 1/2 cup on water and a little on the sugar and cinnamon next time.

I will never buy store bought apple sauce again :) it's so tasty!!
I didn't even have to mash it, just stirred a few times while it was cooling off. Next time I'm definitely doubling or tripling the recipe.

Made this today! 28 apples, 3 cups water, 1 cup sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon.  Used my immersion blender at the end.  Canned 4 quarts from this.  It was an excellent recipe!  Will now be my go to recipe!

Amazing delicious easy. I always quadruple the recipe because I get bucket loads of apples. Sometimes I add extra sugar and spice, sometimes I leave it pretty plain and let the apples shine.

Turned out yummy but Four stars because I did not need nearly that much water - just put in a bit, probably about a 1/4 cup - and I used 9 ginger gold apples. My apples were squishy (which was why I was making applesauce, they were not very good to eat out of hand) - so maybe had a higher water content than other types of apples. Also, I cut back on the sugar just to save a few calories. Amazing that nine apples only made a couple of cups of applesauce.

I made a very similar recipe with frozen apples from last year, Splenda, and cinnamon. Filled the crockpot and all was done in about 5 hours. Scooped it out with a slotted spoon and had some cider left once I drained the bottom. Sooooo good! ??

Just tried this recipe and it is amazing! I had extra apples in the fridge and decided to try something new. My only feedback would be to use less sugar. Next time I do this I will probably do 1/4 the sugar called for. I personally like it hot as a chunky-er apple sauce.

I love this recipe! It is really so easy and you can modify it in several ways (adding other fruit and flavors, taking out sugar...etc.). I left out the sugar this last time... Still, YUM! The kids and hubby LOVE it also!

Super easy and delicious!  My first time making applesauce and the flavor is far superior to store bought in a jar.  The apples were free from my neighbor, so it's a very inexpensive recipe too.  Loved it!

Just tried it. I have a unique apple tree, 4-antique varieties grafted onto one tree. Almost every year the apples do not make it to September due to squirrels and ground hogs. This year is different. Five pounds of apples made 3-plus quarts of apple sauce. Juice and peel of half a lemon and sweetened with 1/2 cup each of brown and white sugar and 8 packets of Equal. Delicious! More apples on the tree so come on over! Apple sauce from Pop-Pop for grandson Eli, age 3.

I doubled this recipe and am quite dissapointed! Way too much cinnamon, way too much water (my applesauce is runny!) and I am glad I went with my instincts and didn't add any sugar. Way too much sugar in this recipe too. If I were to make this again,I would half the water and do a 1/3 of the cinnamon. Now i have a pot of applesauce that is almost unedible due to the amount of cinnamon in it!

This was so easy to make and 2 of my 3 boys say this is better than from the store and want me to make it more often.  The third would like it without the cinnamon.  I can't believe I never tried making applesauce before; but I know I will again.

We really liked this! Cut back a little bit on the cinnamon and added a sprinkle of nutmeg. Very good! The apples that I used were HUGE Gala apples, so the amount of water and sugar were spot on, but I think for smaller apples I would cut back quite a bit. Made this late at night, so I didn't use the blender since that would wake everyone up. Just cooked for about 10 minutes longer so the apples were really falling apart and mashed with a potato masher. Can't wait to try this again with different varieties of apples!

I made this with apples and pears that I needed to use up. I omitted the sugar and doubled the cinnamon. The only change I would have made is to lessen the water to 1/3 cup. Delicious!

It's my first time to make applesauce! I usually wanted to buy it from the store,but thanks to PHATCAT,I found out that making this is SIMPLE!
Just try it and see for your self! :)

Had a surplus of Braeburn apples and thought I'd try homemade apple sauce. This recipe was amazing, very simple and since I didn't use a sweet apple, the sugar was perfect. I processed the mixture in a food processer to get less lumps, worked great. This will be a repeat :-)

The end result was a little watery and tasted more apple-y than I expected, but was otherwise VERY good. I found that for peeling an apple, it works pretty well to use a potato peeler.

This is my go to applesauce recipe!  I prefer to make it raw though. I keep all of the ingredients the same except that I put them all in a powerful blender, like a VitaMix or Blendtec blender. I also leave the skin on for added nutrition and ease. Tastes absolutely wonderful! When we want to add a flavor I just add a 1/2 cup of which ever fresh or frozen fruit that I have on hand. So far have tried, Blueberry, Cranberry, Peach, Mango, and Strawberry. All have been terrific!

This is a quick, easy recipe that tastes great.  My mom made homemade applesauce for me (just once) when I was a kid, and I remember how delicious it tasted -- so much better than store bought applesauce.  After finding this recipe and having extra apples on hand, I made homemade applesauce for my daughter.  My daughter and I like eating the applesauce warm.  Your little brother is very lucky to have such a kind big sis.  Kudos to you and thank you for sharing!

I love this recipe. I use a combination of Granny Smith's and Red and Golden Delicious and leave out the sugar. There is enough sweetness in the 'delicious' apples to compensate for the sugar for me. I leave out the cinnamon, place in canning jars and process in a boiling bath for 10 minutes to seal. When I an ready to use, I add the cinnamon while it is heating for those of us who like cinnamon and I also throw in some chopped walnuts for added flavor. Yummy!

We loved this recipe and it became the only apple sauce my kids would eat. I always make 2 changes to this recipe: I use an unrefined sugar like Turbinado sugar (more caramel flavor) and I add 1 Tbs of Ghee (or brown butter).

Excellent recipe.  The type of apple definitely determines whether an adjustment to the amount of sugar is needed, but I will definitely use this as my standard recipe!

As is, the recipe is just OK. The water that it called for was way too much, so I ended up draining it out and adding back a tiny bit while mashing. Else it would have been extremely runny. I added more cinnamon as well - personal preference.

This was good but too sweet for me as written. Very easy to put together and totally worth it to have fresh applesauce. Great way to use up apples as well. I liked it a lot more the second time I made it. That time, I used brown sugar instead of white, less cinnamon, and apple cider instead of water. This is one of those recipes where I think it's really necessary to tweak for your personal preferences. Thank you for a great starting point!

I tried it in the crockpot as one other reviewer suggested and it worked out great, plus the house smelled wonderful. I doubled the recipe using 9 small apples, but in hindsight, I shouldn't have doubled the rest of the ingredients, as it was a little too sweet. Perhaps the 9 smaller apples were equivalent to 4 large.

I love making applesauce, I like using a soft apple that will cook down quickly. I wash the apples then quarter them and put them in a large pot with a small amount of water/applejuice. Boil until soft. Mash with a potato masher and strain through a sive. The sauce will have a nice pinky appearance. Add dash of cinnamon & nutmeg and that is it. I have also added pomengrates to the apples while cooking. Very flavourable. You do not have to add sugar - the apples have alot of natural sugar.

I used apples (Fiji & gala) from my front yard trees and it came out great...the neighbors think so too.  This couldn't be easier to make.

Delicious. I upped the recipe to 9 apples (4 red delicious, 3 granny smiths, 2 random red ones that were grainy).  I used 1/3 cups of brownsugar, but next time I'll use less.  Added 1 cup of water and 1 tsp of cinnamon, then after cooking mashed the apples up using a food processor.  It turned out surprising delicious and easy.  Will definitely make again and play around with different apples and amounts of sugar.

Absolutely delicious, plan to make it as a Thanksgiving side. It was my first time making applesauce. I used Cortland and Macintosh apples. I halved the recipe, it was a bit sweet, but well worth it. I will make this again very soon ! Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic applesauce, I used Gala apples as suggested in the video and was very pleased with the flavors.  I think that I would make a double batch next time because there were no left overs for later.

Wow was this tasty! Made it for my 18 month old and she screamed when she realized the bowl was empty. Super sweet with all that sugar, may consider cutting this back a bit but otherwise a very simple and quick snack for baby.

I thought applesauce only came in jars from the store till I discovered your recipe and made applesauce for the first time.  Quick, easy and best of all, delicious.  Used two Golden Delicious and two Fuji apples.  Left out cinnamon as I wanted a pure apple taste.  Result was a refreshing applesauce that blended the flavor of both types of apples nicely.  Fuji apples kept its shape after cooking but was tender to mash with a fork for a textured applesauce which I like.  I'm hooked on making my own applesauce now.  Thank you for sharing this duck's guts (Aussie expression for awesome) recipe.

My 14 year old son made this to use in his applesauce bread recipe. He used honeycrisp apples and 1/8 cup of sugar. Came out great with a smooth almost store bought consistency. Made the applesauce bread that much better!!! thanks Sarah!!!

Used old mushy apples and the result was a little watery – I guess I didn't have to cook it as long, so it never thickened right. Not sure – I'm not a very experienced cook. It did have excellent flavor, and I added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg for the smell (tuna fish pervaded my kitchen!).

The applesauce was very good, however, my wife and I agreed that the recipe results in it being too sweet.  The next time we will try it with 1/4 to 1/3 less sugar to see if that helps.  Otherwise it was very simple.

I've made this twice now, both times in the slow cooker.  REALLY REALLY GOOD!!  Considering there's barely any work involved (short of peeling the apples and mixing a few ingredients), so well worth making vs. buying!!!  First time, made it as written - entire family LOVED it (including 4 kids not always appreciative of my efforts).  Second time, tried others' suggestions of using brown sugar instead of white and a bit of nutmeg.  Still LOVED it!!!  The only word of warning (and to NO FAULT of the recipe), watch the kind of apples you use.  The second time I made it, I used apples that were squirting me as I was peeling them and I thought, hmmmm, I should cut back on the recommended water.....but I didn't.  When it was done, I did find it was a bit more watery but it still tasted great.  Just something to keep in mind.

I just made this recipe.  I also think there is too much sugar in the recipe so I reduced to only about a 1/4 of a cup or less with about a dozen Spy apples peeled and cored and quartered.  I added only about a 1/4 cup of water as the apples produce liquid also.  I also added a cinnamon stick while simmering.  Sauce is delicious and can be mashed easily to make a smoother sauce if desired. I didn't give a 5 star either because of the excessive amount of sugar and water as called for in the original recipe.  You can always add sugar after taste testing.

This recipe is super easy to make and absolutely delicious. We made four pints worth (about 24 apples) just a few minutes ago and our kids were begging to taste and eat it right away. I did reduce the sugar to 1/4c to my family's tastes. I also, instead of ground cinnamon, boiled cinnamon sticks with the apples. So pleased with how this recipe turned out and I can guarantee I'll be making it for many years to come. Thank you for sharing with us!!!!!

Delicious! Very sweet, very much like apple pie filling, but that's not a bad thing! I used cortland apples and added a tiny bit of freshly grated nutmeg.

The recipe is great for a topping for meats or ice cream!
I used it as a topping for pork chops. mostly drained the apples and pulsed them in the food processor.

This recipe is amazing!! I made it as a side for my 16 guests. Everyone raved about it even the adults. I doubled the recipe using 16 small Granny Smith apples and I followed the recipe exactly. It might seem a bit soupy but the liquid is absorbed. I made it the day before and kept quite a few large chunks of apples since I was also serving it to adults. I didn't want it to seem like canned applesauce. Don't miss out on this yummy dish! It will be a perfect side dish for fall:)

Soooo delicious.  I used organic coconut palm sugar in place of the white sugar.  I found only 2-3 tsp. of sugar was necessary, depending on the sweetness of the apples used.  This recipe is a keeper!

First time making homemade applesauce of any kind and it is delicious! I used 5 MacIntosh apples because they were small and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. It did still look watery after the recommended time for cooking but if that happens just let it cook a bit longer. Will definatly make again..but in a bigger batch next time! :)

This applesauce was so tasty, and very easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and added a little less water.  I also put half in my food processor to make it extra smooth for my 6 year old son, who is fussy about texture.  This recipe earned an A+ from my family!

This is a fantastic recipe. I quadrupled the recipe also and I added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract to one half of the batch to add a little something different. It is great to freeze so make a whole bunch and save it for the weather. We like to mix our oatmeal with applesauce to sweeten it instead of brown sugar or maple syrup.

Excellent recipe but just a bit too sweet and bland for my taste. Modified it by using 1/8 cup of sugar, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, wedge of fresh lemon juice and a dash of salt.

Some important details:  Apple variety and quality is key.  I use Breaburns as they have a good balance of flavor, sweetness, and tartness.  Often times your grocer will let you taste one of the apples and will cut a slice for you right there.  Don't slice the apples too thin, leave them in big chunks.  Thin slices tend to not break down as easily.  Sugar to taste after the apples have cooked down.  I make my own applesauce just to avoid sugar.  If you like sweeter applesauce, replace the water with apple juice.  I often times add brandy, bourbon, and/or rum in the beginning.  The alcohol cooks off and it adds a little sweetness and flavor.

Perfect!  I made no changes at all.  I used two organic gala and two organic pink lady apples.  So yummy warm off the stove, it is tempting not to devour it.

I got suckered in by a great sale and bought way too many Spartans so I've made this twice this week.  The first time I made it according to the recipe and found it very sweet, more like apple pie filling.  The second time I cut the sugar down to 1 tbsp and it's much more 'applesauce-y'.  So if you're using a sweet apple you don't need to add so much sugar.  But it's great!

I doubled the recipe and threw it in a crockpot as suggested by another reviewer.  It turned out awesome.  My family loved it. There was barely enough for everyone!

Instead of mashing the apples, I cut them into smaller (bite sized) pieces.  I put everything in the crock pot and cooked on low until the apples were very tender.  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to a serving of the hot apples and it's an excellent dessert!

This was awesome. I used a little bit more water than called for because I remembered the recipe wrong (about 1/4 a cup more) and it still came out absolutely perfect! A must have recipe!!

Lovely applesauce, just the right sugar/cinammon combination. Great with potato pancakes! I am just now making a sugar free (Splenda) version for my daughter. I added a little less than 1 1/3 c of water and just under 1/2 c. of splenda, and upped the cinammon a bit.

it's super delicious, but anything that sweet usually tastes pretty super. I used 5 small McIntosh apples and it came out good, but waaaayyy too sweet. Next time I will halve the sugar. Also, at medium heat, the sauce kept boiling over with the lid on. Even when I put the lid on half-way, it still boiled over. I had to reduce the heat quite a bit for the last 7 minutes so when the 15 minutes were up, i turned off the stove but left the sauce to continue heating in the pot.

Wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe pretty much - I used 4 decent sized Jonagold apples. I diced them, added slightly less sugar than required, a tad more cinnamon and same amount of water. At first I thought it was going to be too liquidy when stirring it after it started cooking, but it wasn't. The liquid  "dried up" nicely. I have small kids and texture is a big thing so I put it in my Magic Bullet for a few pulses and it was just wonderful! 4 apples do cook down to not nearly enough sauce... I could easily polish off that bowl all by myself. I will definitely be making this again. Super yummy and fairly healthy as well. When I do make more, I will be using less sugar.

I'm reviewing this for a second time. My husband is on a diet and normally uses the little plastic cups of apple sauce. I made this one and instead of the stated amount of sugar, I put in one tablespoon of sugar and one teaspoon of honey to sweeten it.  Just as good. Thank you.

This homemade applesauce smells and tastes great.  I received a gift of home grown apples (didn't know what variety) and this was an excellent way to cook them.  I thought the amount of sugar was about right for our apples, but we added a little more cinnamon.

I made this and found it a great alternative to buying the little cups in the grocery store.  However, being diabetic, I decided to re-run the nutritional data (I used 5 apples, since that's what I had).  When I ran the data, I got 48.5g of carbs per serving (my yield was 6 6oz servings).  Not sure what serving size they estimated, since they didn't include this data, but if they meant 4 oz, the carbs listed are about right - however, you should get more like 6 or 7 servings at that size.

Completely fast and easy, I made this in my crock-pot and added some powdered nutmeg and a touch of powdered cloves. Just the smell of it added togther with the cinnamon was delicious enough. Came out great. I had some left over juice in the crock pot though, so I just put it into a coffee mug and sipped on that, gotta love warm apple cider.

My daughter loves this applesauce.  I filled a crockpot with apples and pears and let it cook for four hours.  No mashing was needed.  I used MUCH less sugar than the recipe called for and it was excellent!

Wonderful!  I used four times as much of everything, except the water, and made it in the crockpot like some of the other reviewers and it turned out great.  My son said it tasted like heaven... and he hates store bought apple sauce.

Came out great!  I doubled everything but the water and there was still plenty of liquid.  Used my potato ricer for the mashing part which gave it a great texture.

Great cinnamon flavor - adjust the cinnamon if you like more apple flavor. My sauce came out a little watery, but I used apples that were on the small side, so that may have been part of the problem. May adjust the amount of water next time.

Loved it. My apples were a little tart so I ended up using a tad bit more sugar for my personal preference.  We're going apple picking this weekend and I will be sure to make this again.

Great!  My family loves it.  I make a large batch and freeze it.  Turns out wonderful.  My family likes smooth applesauce so I put the mixture thru the blender.

Excellent sauce - was a little sweet for me, so next time I will add just a little less sugar. Otherwise it was just perfect.

I doubled the recipe and made in the crockpot.I left the apples in big chunks and I cooked on high for 3 1/2 hrs. I wasn't sure what apples I was using(I had picked them in an orchard) so I followed the sugar amounts in the recipe. I agree with other reviewers depending on what apples are used adjusting the sugar might be needed. I really can't believe how easy this recipe was!

Quick and easy receipe. I used 8 Macs increased cinnamon to 3/4 teaspoon and added 1 tablespoon more of sugar (but that's our taste).  1st batched cooked in 20 miuntes 2nd batched in 25 minutes. cook longer if batch has more water after cooking time; it wll depend upon the apples.  Since we like smooth applesauce I put cooked apples in a food processer.  This is now my applesauce receipe. Off to buy "seconds" apples at the orchard so we can can applesauce. c

Living in Costa Rica sometimes makes it difficult to find foods taken for granted in the U.S. Needless to say, I was delighted to find this recipe - having never come across canned applesauce here in Costa Rica.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  I've made it a few more times and it always tastes wonderful.  Thanks, Irene

I never thought that making apple sauce was this easy.  I used empire gala apples.  I only added 1 teaspoon of sugar and my husband thought it was not sweet enough.  Next time I will add one more teaspoon of sugar, for a total of 2 teaspoons.  It was very delicious!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I had some apples off the tree that I needed to use and came across this recipe. I ended up making 3 batches! My daughter absolutely loved it, she won't eat store bought applesauce. I even used splenda in this instead of sugar, and I'm sure it was just as good. Thanks for the great and quick recipe!

First time making applesauce and my 2-year old was literally licking the plate as I was clearing the dishes. I suggest adding the sugar little by little to your taste. We didn't end up needing as much as it called for. Also added freshly ground nutmeg. AWESOME as we head into fall.

I made this a few days ago to use up some Gala apples.  I cooked this in the crock pot on high for 4-5hrs, used honey to replace the sugar, and halved the water (since the crock creates extra water).  This turned out great by itself, but would have also been good un-mashed with some ice cream and granola for a healthier dessert. ;)

Excellent applesauce, expect it was too sweet. Next time maybe no added sugar, or maybe just a tablespoon.

Very easy recipe!  I cut the water that was called for in half, added more cinnamon (since I love it), & added aspartame instead of sugar, to create a sugar-free alternative & it turned out awesome! The consistency was wonderfully thick & the flavor reminded me of apple pie without the crust.

My husband loves applesauce of any kind...well not exactly... it was always something i could never remember when i got to the grocery store.  Then I found this recipe and at the same time Costco had a dozen apples for some ridiculous price...Cameos, I think...so I bought them and came home and made a double batch, using the crock pot method suggested on this site.  I did as they said...less water, less sugar, as these apples were very sweet, and cooked for about 4 hours.  The last half hour i take the lid off to reduce the liquid and smashed the apples with the back of a spoon.  I also add some cinnamon, as we like that.  Eveyone i have served this to, including my sister who is a fabulous cook LOVES it.  In fact, she asked to have it twice when she was visiting this winter. If you like applesauce you will never buy another jar of it again with this recipe.

As far as applesauce goes this is a good recipe. I made mine in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours. I also used Splenda to sweeten it although next time I would decrease the sweetner. Thanx

Good recipe, but make sure you PEEL the apples!  Apple peels have a lot of insoluble fiber, which doesn't break down easily.  The inner part of the apple has a lot of soluble fiber which creates the gel consistency of applesauce.

I never made applesauce before but this is great.  After reading reviews I used my crock pot and cooked it for 4 hours on high.  I used 2 Cortland and 2 Granny Smith apples.  I split the liquid to 1/4 cup cider and 1/2 cup water.  I also split the sugar to 1/8 cup each white and light brown sugar.  And finally I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  I'm lucky I got any into the fridge to cool 'cause my husband kept eating it hot.

Great recipe! Really easy to make... used a few more small apples than what the recipe called for. I left them on the heat for about an hour and beat them with a hand mixer. Really yummy and a good way to use up the apples that we had left.

I cut the recommended amount of sugar in half, and added a few drops of vanilla extract and a dash of salt.  I served it slightly warm as a healthy dessert.  I would like to try it along with cinnamon crisps.  I will definitely make this applesauce again.

I followed this recipe to a T and it turned out excellent!!  After 15 minutes there was no need to mash the apples, they mashed up by themselves plus I like a little bit of lumps in my applesauce.

Tastes reminiscent of Cracker Barrel's cinnamon apples. I cooked it in the crock pot, and may have cooked it for a little too long, but it was still good. The sugar can be cut down though, as it was really sweet.

Really easy, and tasted great. I did alter it a bit by not adding as much water (I used 2/3 cup), and only putting in 2 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tbsp white- that was plenty. I also only added a few sprinkles of cinnamon.

Next I'm going to try this with pears, and may even add in a few strawberries :)

Delicious and easy! I agree that there is a bit too much liquid to use for mashing, but go ahead and add it while cooking and then drain it off a bit before you mash the apple pieces - it makes a wonderful cider!

This turned out great.  Always nice to have a simple recipe with simple ingredients to let what nature intended shine.  I used Rome apples, which are similar to Granny Smiths.  I thought it was great how it was, but if you're looking to cut back on your sugar intake (or if you're making this for young kids), I think it would be fine with less sugar.  It is definitely a cinnamon apple sauce.  If you're looking for regular apple sauce, omit the cinnamon.

YUM! This was so easy and came out tasing wonderful.  I will definately make it again. Like the other reviewers, I did use less sugar.  I tasted the apples before I added any sugar, and needed to use about 1/4 cup!  I also agree, it will depend on which apples are used.

YUMMY. That's all it needs, it was a hit even for my brothers who don't usually like applesauce. To make it a little yummier, I softened a couple caramels in the microwave, and popped them on top! Best applesauce I've ever had.

This recipe is great. I put it in our SMALL slow cooker, which has 1 level of temperature, kinda smashed it and stirred it and it was great. Just perfect.

This apple sauce doesn't have to be cool - it's great warm too.  It would be good warm with breakfast on pancakes or waffles.  Bravo!

This recipe is heaven.  If you have an apple peeler/slicer, it is so incredibly easy to make better applesauce than you can buy in any store!

Applesauce can be substituted in so many recipes for butter or oil, it only makes sense to make your own. This also can be made easily in the microwave in a covered micro safe dish. I peel my apples and then grate them from the whole apple till I get to the core. I don't add any water if the apples are very juicy and check for sweetness before adding any sugar. Cinnamon is a must for good flavor. Some apples don't lend themselves very well to applesauce because they don't break down very well. Haralson are such crisp apples, I have a hard time making applesauce using them. My favorite is Cortland, Macintosh, Granny Smith and Washington. Mix them up for a treat. Sometimes my Grandaughter only takes one bite out of an apple. I cut out the bite and put them in a ziplock bag and refrigerate until I get enough for some applesauce. No waste anymore... Thanks for posting such an easy recipe.

I didn't know making applesauce was so easy!  I've made this twice in the last 3 days because I ate the 1st batch immediately.   The second time around I cut back the sugar because it was too sweet initially.  I prefer chunky style so I didn't bother mashing the apples up.

Very simple, very good! I used pumpkin spice and a cinnamon stick to add flavor. Maybe a little less sugar- seemed almost dessert like!

Very nice and simple too.  I only wish I had a blender to throw it in at the end.  I used my hand mixer, but it's still pretty chunky.  Great for babies.  Since it's still a bit chunky I mix it with my daughters plain oatmeal in the morning and it cools down right away.  She loves it.

Finally!  The best applesauce recipe ever and it's really easy!  I used my apple peeler/corer/slicer and had my total prep time was 5 minutes.  I don't think I'll be buying applesauce anymore.  I used Gala, Golden Delicious, and Mutsu apples.

I've actually made this recipe a lot over the years, and this time it was just as delicious as always. I actual stopped putting sugar in altogether. Thanks for teaching me how to make delicious chunky applesauce. A recipe I'll never forget. 10/24/2008 Quick, easy. All of my friends were very impressed, and it took no time at all. Handed out the recipe to some folks, they loved it!

I think this recipe is great. Very delicious. But the only thing I would change, is I would chop apples in to small little pieces before cooking. This makes it alot easier to mash once their soft. Also, I drained just a tid bit of the liquid before I started to mash. Other than that, this is very tasty served warm or chilled.

I made this today, and felt that it needed a couple of small changes: I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and I added a small squeeze (probably about 1/2 tsp) of fresh lemon juice.

This is so easy and the taste is perfect.  I found it a little bit too much water but otherwise it was great.  I made it for a dinner treat and my five year old asked for thirds!  It is nice too because you can add the cinnamon and sugar to your taste as it cooks.

I went online looking for a recipe for applesauce after my sister-in-law gave me apples from her tree. I did this recipe an it took no time to prepare and it came out soo good.I'm going to increase the recipe and make a big batch for later.

We have several apple trees on our property, so I'm always looking for ways to use up lots of apples.  I doubled the recipe and didn't change a thing, except that I ended up cooking it for about 30 minutes.

This recipe is amazing! My son and husband ate it all immediately! The only problem I found is that when I doubled it I added too much water.  I drained the excess water when it was finished and it still turned out wonderful!

Wonderful applesauce! Harder apples take about 5-7 minutes longer, but it is worth the wait. I added a dash of ground nutmeg and used Splenda instead of sugar. Thanks for great recipe!

This is such a great, easy recipe. I picked some apples from the tree in the front yard, and had applesauce ready in time for dinner last night. I cut the pieces pretty small, but they still didn't all mash evenly with the potato masher after cooking them. So, next time maybe I'll try to cook them longer, or put them in the food processor at the end.

I thought there was too much liquid for this recipe.  I used quite a bit more apples than this called for and not so much water.  I also usually don't add so much cinnamon just because I like the flavor of the cooked apples without it.  I think applesauce is pretty flexible to make adjustments so you can play around with this recipe a little bit to get the flavor that you prefer.  This recipe is good though, I just adjusted it to our taste.

Applesauce just like granny used to make... I practically feel like I'm in her house as this simmers on the stove and fills my house with the warm, sweet and cinnamon aromas. Pure comfort food.

I don't like canned applesauce, but I've never attempted to make my own. Lately, however, I have been trying to make all my own food from scratch, and this recipe was amazing! I did, however, need to alter the recipe a bit. I used about 7 McIntosh apples, only enough water to cover the bottom of the pot, about 2 Tbsp. cinnamon, and only a few Tbsp. of sugar, tasting after each one. I only added the sugar after the apples had already become soft.
With the modifications....superb!

This is a simple, tasty recipe for applesauce.  It is kind of a tradeoff in my house though - my husband will eat it and won't eat packaged applesauce, while my picky three year old will eat the packaged stuff all day long and won't touch this!  I think that it is wonderful though, so it is frequently on our table.

Very yummy applesauce! After cooking, I reserved the extra cooking liquid and reduced it down to a syrup. I added the syrup to the apples and mashed, then chilled in the fridge. My 7 year old commented that it is very good warm, and would be good on ice cream. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a good basic recipe.. it wasn't anything special, and I hate to disagree with the other reviewers but I'm not sure it was THAT much different than store bought applesauce. But if you have extra apples, go for it!

It is extremely hard to get my children to eat anything even remotely healthy.  But this applesauce was a huge hit.  I eliminated the sugar and used 4 nice sized pink lady apples.  I too allowed it to simmer for about 20 minutes extra to reduce some of the water content.  Absolutely Delicious!

This is the best ever.  I used Granny Smith Apples and doubled the recipe, it is so good.  My son loves this.  I can't wait to make it for a family function.  So yummy thank you.

Very good applesauce, however I will put in less cinnamon as my kids thought it tasted like "the inside of an apple pie".

This is an awesome recipe, especially since I've been trying to cut all pre-packaged foods out of my diet! I used a mix of Gala and Granny Smith apples, and used brown sugar instead of white. Also, I don't put in the whole 1/4 Cup of sugar at once. I put in about half, then after I blend the applesauce in my food processor, I add more sugar to taste. I found my first batch was quite sweet, and this was the perfect way to sweeten it to my exact tastes.

Altogether, this is great and simple recipe!

Much better than store bought! I used 6 apples instead of 4. At the end of the recommended cook time, mine was still a little chunky so I turned the heat down and let it cook for another 10 minutes. Made it much smoother.

SO easy and SO yummy!  It took very little effort to mash, just needs to be cooked long enough, which wasn't much more than 20 minutes, as directed.  I used 6 MacIntosh, and followed the rest exactly.  Will certainly make again!!!!

This is the best stuff ever!  I'm not even a big applesauce fan to begin with, but gave this a shot after a visit to an apple orchard.  Wow!  I don't change anything in the recipe, although once I did try it with Splenda and it still came out perfect.  Thanks!

I had forgotten how easy it is to make fresh applesauce and how much better it tastes.  Thank you for this great recipe.  I used Rome apples and followed the measurements exactly.  My kids and I are spoiled now and won't eat the stuff from the store.

Very good recipe!  I usually make applesauce by simply throwing the ingredients in the pan, and I never quite get the ratio right until I do a lot of taste-testing and "doctoring".  It's nice to have a guideline.  I will probably cut down on the sugar next time because we like a more tart taste.  That is just a personal preference, however, and not a reflection on the recipe.  Thanks!

Easy and really delicious.
My kids prefer smooth apple sauce so I used my food processor to puree it, it's so harty and so good !
Depending on how sweet you apples are... May need to cut down the sugar a bit.

you can add 1 tbsp of flour to thicken the sauce, it will give the same texure of the canned applesauce.

Excellent.

I doubled the recipe, increased the cinnamon a bit and used a hand mixer to smooth it to my tastes.

I used cortland apples, might reduce the sugar a bit next time.

I love this applesauce!  I can't believe how easy it was!  I love smooth applesauce so my only change was to run it through a blender after being cooled as opposed to mashing it by hand.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Fabulously simple! My one suggestion: keep a bit of the peel on your apple for interesting texture and a hint of color in your applesauce.

This was very easy to make, but forget how much "work" goes into a little bit of applesauce.  Followed recipe and only enough to feed 3 toddlers....definitely will have to double next time.  Kind of sweet like a dessert, will reduce sugar next time too

Better than Grandma's applesauce! Granny Smith tart apples were used so it was not too sweet.  You could probably cut back the sugar a bit if you wanted to keep this recipe a little healthier.  So easy and so very good.

I love how easy this recipe is, and it came out the perfect consistancy.  However, it's way too sweet for my taste.  My husband described it as a good dessert.  Perhaps it was the apples I bought?  Anyway, I'll make this again, but next time, I won't add any sugar.

I made this recipe the day after my family and I went apple picking.  I found this recipe to be the best I've ever had before and my family trully enjoyed it also. p.s My husband said he hated homemade applesauce until he tried this one and now he'll never eat store bought again!!!  Thank You!

This is a great recipe and easy to double, triple, etc.  I did add a pinch more cinnamin and a dash of nutmeg.  My kids love it!  Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this and had the computer calculate it for 12 apples (12 servings) because that is how many apples are in a 3 lb. bag.  Used McAntosh which are slightly tart...but, I did the same as some of the other reviews and only used part of the sugar...I believe it called for 3/4 cup and I only added 1/2 cup.  I did add a bit more after tasting it when it was finished, probably 3 more tablespoons.  It tasted great as I like the sweetness.  I did not use as much cinnamon, just a couple of shakes.  I think this is a better way instead of following the recipe and potientally ruining the whole batch.  Had this for dinner and my daughter ate my bowl after finishing hers!!  Will definitely make again this fall!!

This applesauce is excellent!  I've tried making applesauce in the past but it always turned out watery, this is the thickest and tastiest homemade applesauce I've ever eaten.  The little ones love it!

This applesauce came out tasting better than jarred!  Next time I will try making with Splenda to cut down on the sugar.  Such a delicious treat!

Delicious!  I don't generally like store-bought applesauce, but I had some extra apples so I decided to try homemade.  I love it. I used a sugar substitute rather than white sugar and used a little less than the recipe called for. I also added a little brown sugar - maybe 1/2 teaspoon.

I love the recipe!  I ended up making 2 batches is one day and then ended up making a double batch the next day. My family couldn't get enough of it.  I don't think we will go back to store bought applesauce.

I made 10 servings and followed the recipe exact.  At first I thought it was too much water because my apples were small that we picked at the apple farm  I cooked it for at least an hour because there was so much juice.  I tried to mash it but it wasn't mashing well enough so I poured batches in my bullet and blended. The consistancy was perfect, my 5 yr old and 1 yr old loved it.  They were my tasters.  It made 2 canning jars full.  Thanks!

Next time I make this I'll have to remember to chop the apples smaller. I used 2 gala apples and 2 fugi apples that I cut into bite-sized pieces. I had to cook them longer than 20 minutes to get them soft enough to mash, so I lost some of the apple flavor which was dissapointing. I did sprinkle a little bit of ginger and nutmeg in the apples in addition to the cinnamon and sugar. I'll definitely make this applesauce again though.

Absolutely delicious!  I had a sudden craving for applesauce, and this totally hit the spot.  I've already made this recipe twice and it tastes wonderful every time.  Just don't forget to add the cinnamon!  I almost forgot the second time I made it and it didn't taste as good.

My kids loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe, but did not chop the apples.  I sliced them and let it cook a little longer (30 min. or so).  Great recipe and very easy.

I often tried to make applesauce, but it never turned out that well. This one turned out great!
