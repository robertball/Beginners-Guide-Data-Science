I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this recipe, and had to make it. It is not overpowering chocolate at all. However, it does have a slight burnt taste to it that was not agreeable. Maybe if it was cooked at a lower temperature would eliminate that. The bottom 'crust' has a tendency to fall off like most breadings seem to. Thanks for the challenge.

I was torn between 2 and 3 stars for this recipe.  At first bite it's not too bad.  Chicken came out moist and tender but then a lingering after taste that can be described as bitter and burnt comes out.  I think maybe because there is nothing to balance all the cocoa powder.

Terrible. just tereible. I have no other words than that. I would give it zero stars but it can't go that low.
