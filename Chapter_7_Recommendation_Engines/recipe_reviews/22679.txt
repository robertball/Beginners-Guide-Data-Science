Nice change from the ordinary meatball fare!! I did not pan fry them though, i baked them in the oven at 425 degrees for 15 mins.Then i put the other ingredients in the skillet and added the meatballs.Turned out great!

These are *wonderful*!!  Thank you!  As usual I had to change some ingredients - Italian bread crumbs, fresh ground ginger instead of powder, corn starch instead of flour, and I used ground sirloin.  As for preparation, I drained the meatballs after cooking them and while they sat, I mixed up the liquids in a separate bowl, then added them to the hot skillet to remove the tasty "brown bits" from the pan.  I had no problems with the thickener. I just substitued equal parts corn starch for flour (I don't like using flour). I did heat up the liquid to boiling after removing the meat - perhaps that was the issue for many reviewers.  I knew a "simmered" sauce wouldn't thicken - this did right away.

It's a *perfect* mix of sweet, spicy, and sour!  I served this over spatzle noodles with [frozen] sauerkraut on the side - YUMMY!

YUM!  My changes: Step 2.  Instead of just draining the fat, I moved the meatballs to a cookie sheet lined w/ paper towels & blotted them dry.  I also wiped all excess oil from the pan.  Step 3.  I just boiled down the sauce at the end instead of adding flour.  Served over store bought spaetzle with red cabbage & saurkraut. Thank you for a keeper!

Why would you put bread crumbs with Italian seasonings in a German dish? This recipe is awesome and doesn't need tweaked AT ALL! Thank you for it

I usually double the cooking liquid because we like more gravy. Like my Grandmother's sauerbraten recipe, I add 7 whole cloves, 7 whole peppercorn, 7 whole allspice along with the bay leaves to cook and thicken the gravy with finely crushed ginger snaps not the flour.I remove the whole seasonings with a slotted spoon before serving. Love this recipe!

This is so delicious and will be my go to recipe for an easy fix when we're craving german food.  I made a couple of minor changes I think improved the recipe, adding an egg to the meat/milk mixture.  also added a teaspoon of beef base to the liquid mix before thickening the gravy.  increased flour to 1/8 cup mixing in 1/2 cup cold water, making a thinner flour mixture to mix with the hot liquid.  added chopped fresh parsley for color before serving.

the egg gave the meatballs a very tender texture and the beef base enriched the flavor of the gravy. served it all with mashed red potatoes, sweet and sour red cabbage, steamed green beans and applesauce.  thanks so much for an easy german food recipe!

I really liked the concept of this recipe but being that I make sauerbraten all the time, I knew I would have to change this up. My mom was born in Germany, taught me how to make it and our version doesn't use allspice, ginger or cloves. Instead I seasoned the meat with garlic and onion powders salt and pepper and caraway seeds and minced onion. I did brown the meatballs as the recipe stated to get those flavorful caramelized bits on the bottom of the pan. Once browned I added more minced onion to the pan and then sprinkled in flour to make a roux. One cup of liquid was definitely not enough to make gravy so I used an entire box of beef stock. I didn't measure but slowly added in the sugar and vinegar until I was happy with the balance of slightly sweet and sour. The gravy was again seasoned and made richer with some Gravy Master and a dollop of sour cream to smooth it all out. The end result was very good and I thank you for a great start!

Amazing...I impressed my German husband and can't wait to cook this for his mother when she visits us from Germany. My husband was a little thrown off at first because it was made with ground beef but once he tried it, he said it was "impressing"

We were not impressed with this recipe; the meatballs were much too sweet; maybe if the brown sugar was cut in half it would have been better.

Wonderful recipe.  Easy to make and does not take much time once you get the meatballs formed.  A nice change from the same old meatballs.

For the most part I followed the recipe as written. The only difference is that I sauteed the onions first and added an egg to the mixture. In the sauce I used crushed ginger snaps instead of flour as a thickener. The second time I made this I also added 1/3 cup of sour cream to the sauce which made it smoother. I also tried apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Everyone loves thes meatballs.

My boyfriend and I didn't care for these at all. The meatballs themselves were tasty in a unique way, but the sauce had a really odd flavor, strong in vinegar and not much else. Perhaps I'm just not used to German cuisine, but either way, I will not be making this recipe again.

Very very good! My husband and I really enjoyed these a lot and we'll definitely eat these again. My hubby thought they could have been more tart/sour. My son didn't care for these although he ate anyway, he gave this 2 stars. I messed up the gravy when I added the flour/water slurry it clumped immediately and the gravy was lumpy, so I strained it and just poured it over the meatballs although it was on the thin side. I served this with egg noodles, sauerkraut, and sauteed apples. Great meal, thanks!

I prepared this dish for an Oktoberfest celebration we had at work and received loads of complements (served with kluski noodles). I set aside enough for dinner for my family...my husband and I loved it but it was not my picky 11 year old's idea of meatballs. I will make this again for a party but not for dinner at home, it was a bit time consuming.

Very bland recipe. the meatballs were very firm. I usually add and egg the ground beef mixture to lighten them up. The sauce did not have alot of flavour.

These were very good!  I doubled the amount of cloves and allspice, baked the meatballs (425 for 15 minutes) and thickened the sauce with crushed gingersnaps.  Served over egg noodles.  Hubby didn't care for this meal, but he is hard to please.  I thought it was great!  Thank you!

My family and I only thought this dish was so-so.  I normally like the taste of cloves and ginger but just didn't think it worked well with this dish.  Overall, it was too sweet.  Also, I didn't have much luck with the gravy.  Perhaps the juice boiled down too much but when I added the flour and water, it instantly clumped up.

Really good! My family, including the toddlers, liked it- only problem I had was getting the flour/water mixture fully incorporated, but it didn't effect the taste. I also left out the cloves because I don't care for them- plus I didn't have any. So, I added extra allspice. Very good!

Terrific! My family was a bit concerned about the sweet sour combo but all decided it worked. I served it to my German father and he thought it tasted very authentic. Ok - he would say that anyway but I did tweak it a bit and added an egg and extra bread crumbs. The sauce is easy to make and it you are in a hurry... it is great over pre-made meatless meatballs too. I like to cut back on the red meats.

We really enjoyed these, everything was going perfect until I added the flour/water mixture, it didn't seem to break down like it should.  I consider myself a "sauce queen" and sort of expected trouble from thickening the sauce that way.  Maybe the temp wasn't high enough; anyway this recipe is well worth the trouble to figure out a minor detail like this!

I am so glad that I made this recipe.  I served the meatballs over egg noodles.  Nice different way to cook with ground beef!

Not quite a substitute for proper Sauerbraten, but a really easy way to get your sweet and tangy fix!  I made this with only minor mods (which it didn't need).  I just slightly boosted all of the spices and added some beef broth to the sauce while thickening the gravy because I was concerned that it wouldn't be enough.  In the end even the diluted sauce was SO INTENSE that a lot of gravy wasn't necessary (this from someone who likes everything extra wet).  The recipe doesn't need changing but next time I'll add some onion to either the meatballs or the sauce.  I also might add some ketchup if only for nostalgia - my Pennsylvania raised, not German, grandmother used it in her sauerbraten recipe and its what I grew up with.  Keep in mind the sauce is already plenty tangy, sour, and sweet as is.  Looking forward to eating this again!

These sounded good and smelled wonderful cooking. But once we started eating, it was different. I will say the meatballs were good but the sauce was overpowering and my kids 15 and 9) gave it a thumb's down. I wish they had been better...

While the meatballs themselves were awesome, the sauce was too sweet...I think the next time I will tone down on the brown sugar.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and baked the meatballs instead of pan frying.  I too had problems getting the flour to break up for the gravy...something I will figure out.

The recipe was very good - it definitely had the sauerbraten taste I remember from my grandma's kitchen.  I made the recipe exactly as written - except I might have left them simmering a bit longer as I finished the German Spaetzle Dumplings recipe also from this site to go with the meatballs.

I really LOVE German food (I'm German myself), but didn't care for these at all.  The meatballs were bland and crumbled when I browned them (not completely, but many of mine cracked).  I think the meat mixture needed more liquid.  I also had problems with the sauce as others did.  Mine wouldn't thicken with flour, so I added some crushed gingersnaps per other reviewers suggestions (don't remember how much - I just kept adding until the sauce appeared to thicken), but it then clumped.  The recipe didn't yield much sauce either (and I like to pour a LOT of gravy over my meatballs).  I guess I was also disappointed b/c I couldn't find spatzel in the grocery store, so I had to serve these with potato dumplings instead.  No fault of Christine's, just bad luck all around.  Thanks anyways.  I'm sure you're a wonderful cook. : )

The meatballs tasted pretty good, but the "gravy" was just strange, it tasted like bay leaf flavored sugar. I would make the meatballs again, but I ended up making my own garlic white sauce, I would not make the gravy again.

The meatballs tasted pretty good....but the gravy needs some improvment.I'm from Germany and it does not taste like any Sauerbraten I have ever had....but it's worth a try.

This was great-the only thing was mine were a little dry and I think that's because I added an egg to hold them together and I used gr. sirloin instead of hamb.  Recipe called for 2 TB of water & 2TB of flour to thicken, that was like paste so I only used a drop.  Next time I will use reg. hamb and bake and use the gingersnaps to thicken.

I've never had sauerbraten or anything similar, but this meatball recipe beckoned to me from among the others. Maybe it was the German...I'm not sure.

But...WOW! I loved these! I made them tonight for dinner as a good friend of mine and her boyfriend came over. I followed the advice of another reviewer and thickened the gravy with gingersnap crumbs, which sounded a bit odd to me, but gave the gravy a delicious flavor. Yum. Sweet yet still tangy. 

I think I'm in love.

And if I was a man, I'd ask you to marry me, Christine!

I was just looking for an alternate meatball recipe to my usual....this was good and really has that German taste to it. Not all around fabulous, because of the uniqueness of the allspice/clove flavor but a 4 star recipe!

Delicious -- My boyfriend and parents loved it!! Next time I will probably add a little more vinegar to give it a more "sour" taste. Excellent over egg noodles and served with sauerkraut. MM!
