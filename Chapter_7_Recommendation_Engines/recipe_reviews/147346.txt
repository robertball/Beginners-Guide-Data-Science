This is the first time I used the pressure cooker to cook potatoes for  salad. The potatoes turned out wonderful and was so simple to do, without cooking them in a large pot of boiling water. The rest of the salad recipe was right-on, and lends itself well to adjusting the ingredients to your personal tastes.

Made half a recipe (cooked two large potatoes) and cooked the potatoes in my Nordic Ware microwave pressure cooker for 8 minutes.  There's no waiting for the pressure to rise and fall as there is in a regular pressure cooker, and it's great for preparing small quantities.  The fresh dill is a nice addition to the mayonnaise-based dressing.

The recipe was very tasty! I left out the dill since my family doesn't care for it, but otherwise it was great. I used smaller yellow potatoes (a little bigger than an extra large egg) and set them for 6 minutes in my Instant Pot. They were still a little hard in the middle after the suggested amount of time. I put them back in the pressure cooker for another 4 minutes and they seemed perfect. Next time I will let them cook for 9 0r 10 minutes before quick release. I think it's just the difference between pots that made for this discrepancy.

Very good Potato salad, I used a 1/4 cup of Miracle whip with the mayo as we like it with a creamer texture and on the sweeter side, We like the potatoes pieces on the smaller size and 3 minutes was all it took to steam them. Surprised no one mentioned when steaming the potatoes just put the eggs on top of them and with the Insta-Pot  set for 3 minutes with a quick release they come out perfectly hard boiled.

Great recipe!  Thank you!!  I made the potato salad the first time exactly as written and it was very good.  The second time, I increased the apple cider vinegar to 2 tsp and added about 1.5 Tbsp Maggi to the dressing ingredients and included a finely chopped baby dill pickle too.  My husband and son both agreed that it was the best potato salad they have ever had!  Definitely a keeper.  (I used the Whole Egg Mayonnaise also found on this site, and it is wonderful in this recipe.)

I made this for in my electric pressure cooker (Instant Pot) but used 3 quite large potatoes cut in half instead of the 6 medium. I set the potatoes in a steamer basket inside my pot and I cooked them for the 3 minutes recommended and natural pressure released for 7 minutes. They were not quite done so I pressured for 1 more minute, quick release. Perfect. It all depends on the size of your potatoes. For the onion hater in the house I used onion powder and followed the rest of the recipe as is leaving all measurements as written. Although I only had a small taste test I really liked this recipe. The amount of dressing was perfect for the amount of potatoes and I enjoyed the addition of dill. I used to boil my potatoes whole for potato salad but I actually prefer the pressure cooker method. Definitely a keeper in my book!

Have made a couple of times now. There are never any leftovers! Next time i will cut back a little on the mustard. LOVE pressure cooking the potatoes (I've used yellow, red, and russet...all delicious) in so much less time and without heating up the kitchen.

Great recipe. The only thing is I tried 4 minutes in the instant pot and found potatoes to be a bit too done so I did it again with eggs for 3 minutes. The texture and egg yolks were bright yellow and cooked to perfection in 3 minutes.  I did alter the recipe by putting water, salt, a bit of sugar and apple cider to cook and cooled potatoes on baking sheet with a little more apple or rice vinegar while I made dressing.  Taste delicious.

Very tasty potato salad! I'd like to double the recipe for a family get together. Does anyone know if I need to add more water or how long to cook the potatoes if doubled?

Great recipe when you are busy and don't have time to watch pots! I also did my eggs in the pressure cooker, and like other reviews, had to adjust my time for the potatoes. My children loved it!

This is the best!  Used my pressure cooker to cook red potatoes and my  egg cooker for the hard boiled eggs.  I don't peel the potatoes.  beautiful color.  The dressing is well balanced and doesn't drench the potatoes with mayo.  used dried dill about 3/4 t.  might use a little more apple cider vinegar next time.

I've made this recipe a few times now and it's one of my favorites for potato salad.  I also hard boil my eggs in the pressure cooker (separately).  We like dill so I add 2x as much and extra celery as well for a little more crunch.
