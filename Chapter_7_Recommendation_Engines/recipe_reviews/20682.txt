These are the best and great for on the go!  I almost always use canadian bacon and sliced cheese but whatever you have on hand is bound to taste good on an english muffin.

UPDATE:  Answer for Monique. T.  The ingredients call for ground sausage.  Refer to Direction #3.  It says while the eggs are frying form the sausage into small patties.  Place them in another skillet and fry until browned.  Remove and drain on paper towel.  Hope this helps.  Happy Cooking!!!!

One of my most favorite breakfasts. Works with almost any meat you have on hand. Sometimes, I'll add a little maple syrup drizzle over the egg (minus the green onion) and it's almost like having a particular fast food's all-in-one breakfast sandwich. NOTE: If you have a cookie cutter or even a biscuit cutter, you can cook your egg inside it, while it's cooking in the hot skillet. Almost like having an egg form so that way it's a little more controlled and will fit a little easier. Just make sure to spritz your "form" with a little non stick spray.

I have made several batches, using this recipe as a rough guide.   The best suggestion I have is for the eggs.....Whisk your eggs, milk,  spices together, then pour into a sprayed 9x13 pan.  I used 12 eggs to make 12 sandwiches.  Bake at 375 for about 15 minutes, or until set.  Cut into squares.

Susan, thank you for submitting this recipe. I realize that there are "advanced" cooks/chefs on this site, but there are also the beginners too! I have been making these for years, as well, but my granddaughter is going off to college soon, and this will be very helpful for her, as I've aimed her toward this site to learn new things from new people who love to cook. I remember learning how to cook, and some of the disasters that could have been avoided had I had some simple, clear instructions. Oftentimes "keeping it simple and basic" is most helpful!
Thanks again, Susan!

The sandwich is great but the cheddar cheese is sliced not shredded as per the picture. And the ground sausage is a patty.  Its not the picture of the described dish but the taste is great. I like my muffin lightly buttered.  Well done!

This was very good, but I used only 3 onions and next time I will chop them VERY small.The eggs were hard to turn over, but I cut it into two pieces with the spachela and it tuned out OK. I also put some salt and pepper in the eggs and used preshaped patties and put a slice of cheese on top and put it in the mic for20 seconds.

Been making these for years. I always use the egg rings, makes it so much nicer, except for cleanup.. A hearty breakfast to start off the day when you have to get out and work around the house.

This is a wonderful breakfast sandwich that cost me 46¢ each to make.  I made them with ham because that is what I had on hand.  I pan fried the ham to pull all the water out of it.  I baked the egg portion in my greased muffin top pan, and it worked perfectly.  I baked at 350° for 10 minutes.  I toasted the English muffins first and let them completely cool before assembling.  I think the key is letting all ingredients cool before putting the sandwich together.  I wrapped individually in parchment paper and stacked them in the English muffin plastic bag to freeze.  DH & DS microwave on high for 30 seconds, flip, and microwave for another 30 seconds.  This is for using from frozen state.  I'm making them again this weekend and going to try them with sausage.  My family loves this for a quick breakfast sandwich.

I have been making these forever and they are just great! So versatile and very hearty. Sometimes I lighten them up by using 100 calorie english muffins, egg beaters, lowfat cheese and either turkey bacon or canadian bacon. The possibiliteis are endless! I usually serve these for dinner with fried potatoes-YUM! :)

Quick easy sandwiches. I used bacon instead since I had it handy. I wish I knew what the sauce McD's puts on theirs that is all that was missing from this.

I used sausage patties and scrambled the eggs and cheese because I thought it would be kind of hard to flip over like an omelet.  I also left out the green onions.  My BF couldn't taste the cheese in the eggs so it probably would have been easier to just add a slice of cheese to the sandwich.  Tasty though.

Great idea for a make ahead breakfast! Sometimes we wind up in a rut with our menu ideas. Thanks Susan for your submission. I will be making these this weekend instead of the fluffy pancake recipe (from this site) that I've been making soo many times. Thanks again Susan !

YUM!  This is always good, anytime.  I used sage patties (great flavor) and I fold my scrambled eggs into a square about a minute after I flipped it over, real simple.  With paper towels, I placed both patty & eggs between & patted dry.  Thanx for posting.

This is really good! I made it with veggie sausage and Vermont cheddar. Yum! Yum! Not sure I'm going to try freezing. Cannot get my brain around the thought of frozen scrambled eggs. Eh... not going to go there.

Always enjoyed breakfast muffins and these are versatile. My daughter loves it with bacon, cheese, and eggs. After toasting the english muffins, we spread butter on them...yumm!

I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed this recipe before----I've been making these sammies for several years.  We love them.  They're wonderful to have on hand in the freezer.  Beats Mickey D's!!

The sandwiches freeze very well, but I've found that they are best if used within a week or two at most (eggs do not like the freezer.) One minute in the microwave and they are done.  I also sub turkey sausage to cut back the calories & fat.

These were wonderful with homemade dill rolls from the bread machine. I made more than needed and froze the rest for my husband's lunches. Scrumptious!

I like the idea of a homemade 'Egg McMuffin' but I found myself making a lot of changes to suit my own tastes. I don't like onions, especially in eggs, so I deleted them. I used a slice of swiss cheese instead of the shredded cheddar, which my husband and I really liked. I followed the directions for shaping the eggs into an omelette and then cutting it into pieces. I found it made the sandwiches bulky and uneven. Next time, I might try using something that will shape the eggs into six even rounds.  Finally, I made my own homemade turkey sausage instead of store bought and we both really enjoyed that too.

If you really want it fast without dirtying pans etc. use the microwave. Just toast the muffins and while they are toasting put an egg in a small bowl, sramble it up and microwave for about a minute or so. Buy the microwave sausage patties and microwave them according to package directions. Lay a slice of cheese on the sausage and microwave until it melts. Assemble everything and you're good to go!

I've made these for years but I use a canning lid without the inner lining to shape the eggs in a frying pan. Just crack the egg into the lid and fry, then flip and remove the lid for a perfectly round egg. You can also use a muffin tin in a large frying pan, just put some water in the pan for a more even heat to cook all the eggs you need.

Great recipe for an "Egg McMuffin." If you like your cheese on top, then do it that way. Change it up however you like. But this recipe is a great starting point if you've never made them or are looking for ideas. I made the eggs as stated but left out the onions. I used a blueberry English muffin and honey turkey for the meat. I lightly buttered the muffin first--yummy breakfast.

I LOVED this recipe. Every Morning I have to have  a quick doughnut  or  microwave something, but this quick and easy breakfast item made my life easier and better. Instead of using shredded cheese, I used sandwich cheese and broke it into small pieces I also didn't use the unions, but this breakfast sandwich still tasted all good!!!

This was a quick breakfast when you are crunched on time, but, still was hearty and flavorful.  It tasted similar to an omelette.

I make these all the time.  On the weekends I make them with ham. sausage, bacon whatever I have available and freeze them . My husband grabs one or two a day out of the freezer and microwaves them at work.  I always toast the muffins, fry the bacon crisp and put different types of cheese. Usually whatever I have which is  usually  cheddar.

Since I didn't have any sausage, I made the  breakfast sandwich with bacon and cheddar cheese. I used salt, pepper and a dash of garlic powder to season the eggs to give this sandwich more flavor. These are easy and quick to make.

A simple, satisfying breakfast sandwich. All I did differently was to omit the cheese because I don't care for it. Will make again.

Really good.  I made these with turkey breakfast sausage and Canadian bacon.  Both were good.  Just spiced up the eggs a bit (no salt since the other ingredients have plenty).  I used sliced Colby Jack cheese which was really good.  Love make ahead recipes for quick meals, thanks!
