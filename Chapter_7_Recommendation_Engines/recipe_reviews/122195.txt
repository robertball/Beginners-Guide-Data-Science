These were almost excellent.  However, here is what I will do next time to make them exceptional - 1) decrease the vinegar to 1/4 cup (and since I have not been able to like red vinegar for all I do, I will make it white) 2) add a clove or two while boiling the pickling liquid and mushrooms - then discard if you wish.  The clove is imperative to get that missing something...

These were awesome! They were tangy and sweet, but not overpowering like some recipes. The only thing I would change is add more mushrooms, probably 2 pounds. They do shrink quite a bit and there is a lot of liquid left. Everyone loved them! Thanks!

I used this recipe, but I canned them for a few weeks before eating them and the mushrooms were amazing!

I liked this recipe. I made it as directed, and will make again. I kept the mushrooms whole and let them in the fridge for a couple days. They were chewy and delicious. The mushrooms do shrink, I would say by almost half.

I was a little skeptical about how these would turn out. We could only find sliced mushrooms at the local market so that's what was used. We prepared as written except we canned them and they turned out great. M finace' loves them so this will become a regular item in our pantry.

delicious.... added some crushed red pepper... better than the ones you buy in the supermarket and for a fraction of the price.

A most excellent way to prepare an abundance of mushrooms.  I froze some in hopes that they will thaw and not be mushy.  I did use almost twice as many mushrooms b/c there was so much brine.
