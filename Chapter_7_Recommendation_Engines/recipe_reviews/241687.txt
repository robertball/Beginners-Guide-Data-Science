Nice very very nice. I didn't know what this was supposed to be. Is it a cake a cookie a bar type dessert? Well it is a mix of sorts. Crispy on top because of the egg cake/bar-like in substance-and very delicate. I ate it for breakfast after leaving it to cool overnight. It goes very well with tea. The flavour is aromatic and spiced thanks to the allspice and sweet enough to compliment an un-sweetened drink. The turmeric gives it more a hue than color. It yielded 9 squares. It covered the bottom of a 9-inch pan with about 3/4 of an inch in height and rises very little. If you need to double the recipe do so in two separate pans as I don't think it would be as nice if it were thicker. It's perfect the way it is! I used gluten free flour without xanthan gum and it fell apart easily so plan accordingly if you use gf flours. Thank you Jenna Arden for your adaptation of this treasure.
