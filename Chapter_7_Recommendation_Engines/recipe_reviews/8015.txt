This was quick and easy to make.  I cut the oil down 1/4c. and added 1/4c. lemon juice.   My kids enjoyed it.

This is a super moist cake and very tasty.  I also cut down the oil to one cup, I usually always use less oil than called for and substitute water or another liquid in just about every cake recipe. I would have made it again except I keep forgetting to pick up poppy seed filling.

This cake has been a favorite for every event I bring it to. Im constantly asked to give out the recipe but the Bakers brand is hard to find and the Solo brand is quite different not as smooth and sweet. Also using Crisco oil is the best and lightest tasting for this cake

We did not like this cake.  It was heavy and you could taste and feel the oil in it.  Sad waste of ingredients.

Finally a poppy seed cake recipe that is close to the quality of those delicious squares in European coffee shops.  I only made one alteration ... didn’t have evaporated milk so I did as this site recommended and used powdered milk with a low ratio of water to powder. I made a lemon rose glaze and it was gone in a day and a half. I’m still looking for a poppy seed ricotta square recipe.

yumm! I used a glaze on top: which was just 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and a little bit of milk like 1 tablespoon

Simple and fast recipe.  Let this cake cool 100% before tasting.  My 1st impression was that it was that there was too much oil as well, BUT after letting it cool 100% over night it tastes much better and you dont taste the oil as much as trying it say 30 min. after it comes out of the oven .  A smidgen sweet for me, but im not a sugar person and I dont think you can really cut back that much?  if anyone attempts withs a little less sugar I could love to know how it compares.

Tried cutting the oil to 1/4 cup. It was better but I still wouldn't make it again.
