I like orange and chocolate together, but the pulp made this not so good. I am going to try this w/ canned mandrin oranges in their own juice...I think that would be wonderful!

I was intrigued when I came across this recipe. I love chocolate and orange together and after reading the recipe I knew to expect a lighter chocolate and orange flavor. With that, I began to make the drink. I used half the ice since I don't like icy drinks. I made the rest of the recipe as written. I took a few sips. As other reviewers stated, it is rather pulpy and normally I don't mind the pulp but in this drink it just wasn't working. Also the chocolate taste is so faint it is barely there at all. The orange in it is also light so it ends up tasty like icy, frothy, milk. I found this recipe serves 2.

I used canned mandarin oranges as another reviewer suggested and the drink was great.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, It made a very thick and pulpy foam, the second time I used canned mandarins and it was much better.

it was ok but I found that I have a hard time peeling the orange so I scooped the insides and instead of using chocolate syrup I subed it for nesquik powder and its a pretty ugly color once the drink is done

I have made this drink for years.  I suggest you substitute the orange for pulp-free orange juice (use 1c).  Also; only use 1tbsp of chocolate syrup.
