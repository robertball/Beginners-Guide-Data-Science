This was pretty good and will make it again. I used fresh pumpkin in chunks and added a couple of other veggies I had on hand. Then I gave it a slight twist with an immersion blender leaving it slightly chunky and smooth at the same time. This is a nice combination of sweet and savoury. Thank you EVEAPPLE for the recipe.

Excellent!  Used curry to taste instead of cloves.  Used fresh corn.  Added a red bell pepper, celery and two packs of sliced baby bella mushrooms, and 1/2 cup white rice. Used paprika and cayenne pepper to taste as well. No need to use that much olive oil at all.  Used a little more than a tablespoon.  Sauteed leeks and garlic for a few minutes, then added the celery and bell pepper.  Sauteed a bit, then added carrots and mushrooms.  Sauteed a bit longer then followed recipe as written.

I made three changes initially which I don't think changed how I'd rate this recipe if I hadn't. I used 1 spicy Italian sausage link (diced), turnips (halving the potato content) and coconut milk instead of milk. With that said, it needed something more. As above, I rated it a 3. After this, I added curry and cinnamon which really added the flavor and depth needed to bring it to 4.5 stars.

Iâ€™m always needing a new idea for another way to use pumpkin instead of pies and bread. This is a very tasty and healthy alternative. I added bacon the second night to give it more flavor.

This is a great fall soup, very smooth and it really warms you up. I followed the recipe except I added some minced garlic and only used 8 cups of chicken broth because I like thicker soups. I also used skim milk instead of whole. It has a nice, rounded taste (not just pumpkin, although you probably won't care for this if you don't like pumpkin), but I thought it could've used a bit more flavor - perhaps more of the spices it calls for or some additional ones?

Great as is.  I can't have dairy, so the second time I omitted the milk but it was still very, very good.

This was the perfect recipe cleaning out the fridge and the soup was warm and thick and cozy on a cold winter's day.  I used a cup less broth as I prefer thicker soups and had a bit of shredded chicken leftover that I added although I really wish I would have tasted it before I added all the salt.

I don't really like the taste of pumpkin but I like it in soups.  This is a good pumpkin soup that does not taste like pumpkin and is easy to make.  You need to taste it and adjust the seasonings and liquids to your liking.  Since I did not have everything on hand, I made some adjustments and my family and co-workers Loved It.  I will make it again.

Used white onion instead of leeks, but leeks would be great.  Only used 1-2 T of oil to saute onions then added a little stock to simmer potatoes and carrots. Used canned creamed corn instead of frozen.  Added a can of rinsed white beans and used two potatoes.  Used White Cooking Wine instead of milk.  Used more parsley, salt, and black pepper during the cook and added a dash of cayenne pepper.  I hold back on the total broth and add to my preference.  Thinning soup, if needed, with more stock or wine. 
An optional add-in would be diced cooked chicken to make it even more hearty.
