This was incredibly good and rich.  Instead of making the ravioli, I used the filling to make stuffed shells.  It was a huge hit.

Very rich and many flavors. I used a buttercup squash instead of pumpkin(all boiled and pureed). Some people had confusion about the butter, but I melted 2 cubes in a pot and mixed in the onions, squash ect. I took the advice and used one box of jumbo shells. I stuffed them full and layed them in a baking dish. For the cream sauce I followed it exactley but added about 1 tbs maple syrup. I cooked it on medium heat for about 15 min (nice and thick) then stirred in some frozen spinach (didn't have sorrel). I poured the cream sauce over the shells and baked it for 20 min at 350 degrees. Sprinkled the rest of the toasted hazelnuts on top afterward and voila! So delicious.

I always skip the pasta making and buy fresh pasta from local specialty stores. But the sauce is superb, and an excellent compliment to both pumpkin ravioli and traditional cheese ravioli. I've made this a few times; it gets easier the second  time around. My mom, my boyfriend--everyone loves it!

The Raviolis ae wonderful, the sauce is lacking.  It would accent the taste of the raviol to have a cream sauce with maple or caramel flavoring added.

I couldn't get the raviolis to seal. So I boiled the pasta and used them as lasagna noodles instead. I aternated noodles and pumkin filling, topped with cream sauce, a sprinkling of italian cheese mix and nuts. Baked covered at 350 for 30 minutes, uncovered for 15. Delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I cut back to 1/2 the butter and 1/2 the hazelnuts. Used fresh spinach instead of the sorrel.

This was soooo fantastic. It was a lot of work, but so worth it! The pumpkin mixture is fantastic. We made it for valentine's 2007 and we made fresh pasta and then used a heart shaped cookie cutter to make heart raviolis. We made two batches of pasta and ended up still having about 2-3 cups of pumpkin filling left over. So we bought jumbo pasta shells the next day to use up the remaining. The sauce is sooo good. I will definitely use the sauce for other pastas. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm so glad I took another reviewers advice and used stuffed shells instead of making ravioli because no one in my family cared for this. Out of courtesy, they all ate it, but I threw most of it out. Sorry.

One of the finest raviolis I had ever tried! I agree that they are quite time consuming, but they worth every minute. I had never  done any pasta, this was my first recipe, and in my house everyone were delighted. Really nice.

Very good.  I have been searching for the ultimate pumpkin ravioli for years after having had it while traveling.  I would say that the hazelnuts are unnecessary (and so time consuming anyway).  I used a lot of spinach instead of the sorrel and substituted large shells.  Next time I'll only fill each shell about half full, as I found the filling to pasta ratio a bit high when completely stuffed.  Very close to "the one".  Definitely recommend a white sauce not tomato based or even a pesto on this one (and the one included here is pretty good).

I used shells instead of ravioli. It's easier to do and to find. I made this for several events, and it was a hit every single time. Instant tradition...  I did use butternut squash instead of pumpkin, but if you can't find fresh pumpkin, you could use canned.

Really great. I agree with the reviewer who said to cut butter in half.   I did not use this sauce but used a brown butter sage sauce recipe from marthastewart.com. I had a ton of filling leftover.  I think making the fresh pasta in a must.

Flavor-wise, wonderful and tasty! Ease of preparation, however, is not! This was my first time attempting ravioli and I tried hand-making pasta.. Hmm, that was an epic fail! I bought wonton wrappers from the grocery store and those were much easier to work with. They stuck together when I boiled them, though, and I basically had to make a ruined-ravioli "casserole". It tasted wonderful though. I will try these again when I have more patience with myself!

I used this as a base to make something a bit different but very good. I used jumbo pasta shells and stuffed them with the pumpkin mixture. I used a little EVOO instead of butter. I had some cooked spaghetti squash and added that to the mixture instead of the carrots. I added diced chicken. I used cinnamon and a pinch of ginger. I used the heavy cream sauce and added a jar of spaghetti sauce to it. I omitted the hazelnuts altogether cuz I didn't know how that would tatse. I also added fresh spinach to it in the very end instead of the sorrel. I poured the sauce over the stuffed shells and baked it in the oven for about 30 min. Thanks for the recipe!

We followed all the directions. We did substitute the nutmeg for mace and fresh ginger for cardamom. The stuffing was very flavorful. The sauce was a little plain so, we added a few fav spices, we also did'nt have sorrel so we put some fresh baby spinach.. The only step we skiped was rubbing the nuts?... We ground the Halzelnuts too. Turned out great! We had a ton of extra stuffing so grabed some jumbo shells and suprised everyone at work!

This was not as hard as everyone said. I did use the stuffed shells instead of ravioli. I also added asiago cheese 1/2 cup to the sauce and 86ed the sorrell. (couldn't find it anywhere). I also couldn't find hazelnuts. So i got frangelica liquor (1/2 cup) and boiled  it on the stove top to burn off the alcohol and poured the syrup in the sauce. It was great. I then toasted pecans and put that over top as I served it. baked the shells with sauce in the oven for about 15 min at 350 then sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and baked unitl cheese was melted. Highly recommend

This is an excellent recipe! I only gave it 4 instead of 5 because I had to change it. I thought the garlic was too much. I added extra cinnamon and a little brown sugar to try to get the garlicky taste out (I love garlic but not in this recipe). I used a homemade ravioli recipe I found and they were so good! I did follow the hazelnut sauce but did not put garlic in it and added extra cream. So good!

this was my first handmade ravioli and It was wonderful. Some of the ingredients were difficult to find but if I skipped a couple it did not seem to matter. The essentials made it in and it worked great. Follow the hazelnut recipe carefully. The second time I did not and that was a mistake.

This was soooo goood. It took half the day to make, but was so well worth it!!!  I had left over filling, so I used the larger shell pasta, filling them then baking. We could have had this for several nights in a row and loved it every night !!!

Great recipe, definitely restaurant quality! I took the hint from other reviewers and used large shells and spinach, which cut down on the time and cost of this meal. The sauce is great, even though it made me nervous to put cream over high heat, it came out fine! The colors in this dish make it an entirely impressive vegetarian meal.

Considering how much time this recipe took, three stars is the highest rating I can give. It should have been amazing, but was only somewhat good at best. We liked the pumpkin filling, but everything else was a waste of time. Looking at the ingredients for the sauce, I suspected it wouldn't be good. Should have trusted my instinct!

Anyway, I'll make the pumpkin part again, but will create my own recipe around it next time.

This was really good.  My teenage son complained  the whole time I was making it that it sounded weird and he wasn't going to eat it.  He then took one bite and said it was great, and asked for seconds. 

The spicing is what makes it so interesting.  I had homemade pasta in the freezer, so I rolled it out.  I used spinach instead of sorrel.  For the sauce, I cut down on the cream and made a white sauce with milk, cream and a cream cheese, simply because these were the ingredients I had around.  I did not use hazelnuts, as I didn't have any on hand and though there would be enough protein from the cheeses.

with changes I did like it....but as written? no. The onion, cardomom, allspice and mace overpowered the delicate carrot and pumpkin flavors by a lot and 1 cup of butter is a lot for 6 servings. I used half butter and half oil...but that is minor. The real problem is the overpowering spice. I am very glad I only made half a batch as I ended up having to double everthing except the onion and spices above to tone it down to an acceptable level where I could actually taste the pumpkin/carrot.

being a vegetarian, i always look for special seasonal fare to make for myself when everyone else is eating meat at the holidays. my meat-eating brother liked this more than i did, i think, actually. the sauce is a total wash, and when i reheat leftovers tomorrow i will have to really tweak it to get the most out of what i have. the carrot was too overpowering in relation to the pumpkin. the 3 cloves of garlic should go in the filling instead of the sauce (i also stuffed shells). i might make this again, but i have a feeling i might just move on to something else for next year. with some adjustments, the filling can have more potential, but forget the sauce altogether and find another -- cream sauce IS a must for this dish!

It did not turn out so wonderful.  I do not usually make my  own pasta.  My main recommendation would be to make the filling and use it for stuffed shells.

This was a nice change from the norm, but was very time comsuming.  Not being a veteran home made pasta maker, we ended up with some pretty sticky ravioli's (I read that you should cover them with a damp cloth while you make the entire batch of pasta up - so that they don't go hard.

The leftovers went into a baking dish.  Covered the ravioli with the sauce and will have a nice pre-made casserole this week for dinner.

I made this with my mom for Christmas dinner, and though we had a difficult time making it, it turned out very well in the end.  She makes a lot of traditional cheese raviolis and found this version very time consuming, even with the pasta maker.  The filling was too liquidy to use a ravioli cutter, so we had to make them by hand.  We put the filling in the fridge for about an hour to chill and that helped.  I couldn't find sorrel for the sauce, so I used spinach and fresh lemon juice.  It was pretty thin at first, but since we let it sit overnight, it thickened up a lot.  My dad was leary of ravioli's with pumkin, but he loved it!  We used the Fresh Semolina & Egg Pasta recipe.

I made a version of this using lasagna noodles instead of making ravioli and it was a big hit at my dinner party.

Sorry, no one in my family cared for it much. It was something different to try and I'm glad that we tried it. But, way too much work, too much fat, and too expensive to make again. (The only thing I did different was I put the filling in stuffed shells instead of making raviolis.)

The filling of the ravioli was good, but I did not like the creamy sauce. It was too runny. Also my family didn't care for it too much since it was somewhat sweet.

I substituted shells as others recommended.  I liked how the hazelnuts softened in the cream.

Loved this recipe. I did follow some other suggestions and replace the sorrel with spinach, but otherwise I still made the ravioli with my homemade pasta dough. It was great! I did have extra filling at the end so I froze it for next time!

Excellent! Like another reviewer, I stuffed this into shells and baked it rather than making my own ravioli - they don't carry pasta sheets in most Manhattan supermarkets. I was skeptical when the mixture was cold, since it had an odd taste, but I added a good amount of garlic salt, stuffed the shells, popped them in the oven, and drizzled them with a sage butter sauce (instead of the hazelnut cream sauce) and they came out incredibly tasty! I halved the recipe, and I don't know what I would do with it all if I had made the whole thing. As it is, I have plenty in the freezer reserved for a cold winter day!

This recipe is very time consuming. The butter it called for, never stated exactly where to put it, so we left it out. Also, the sauce never thickened. Perhaps needed corn starch? We were trying to create a dish we had at Wolfgang Puck's...not quite the same. But I still enjoyed the end result!

This was the one experience where I know I need a pasta maker.  The sauce was a bit bland, we added some frozen spinach to it which worked.  Great filling! I'll try it again with a pasta machine and a different sauce..

This was a really tasty recipe, but I did make some necessary alterations. I added 6 oz of asiago to the cream sauce to give it more flavor, this helped balance the sweetness from the filling.

I used wonton wrappers for this instead of fresh pasta dough and they did not hold together well when I boiled them. The general flavor was good, but the ravioli were all stuck together and not very attractive. I substituted watercress for sorrel because I couldn't find sorrel.

This was so delicious and I didn't even have half the ingredients.  If I had all the ingredients this would be even better.  Things I didn't have:  hazelnuts, maple syrup, mace, cardamom, sorrel.  I used fresh spinach instead of the sorrel, which I couldn't find.  Loved the filling and the cream sauce was just perfect with it.  Will try to make again but with all the right ingredients (except hazelnuts which I wouldn't like in it) and this would be evn more fabulous.

This pumpkin filling for this dish turned out way too bitter!  I had no idea how to fix it, so I unfortunately ended up tossing the whole thing!

this recipe was very intense to make but was a great hit at the party.  it took me hours to get the ravioli made since i was making them by myself.  all in all though it was worth it.  i did not try to sauce though; i used a tomato sauce instead.  overall rating though was that it was worth the work.

I love these ravioli. I was also unable to find sorrel, I made up my own sauce to go with -- olive oil, water, parmesan cheese and crushed pecans. It was mighty tasty!

Very tasty! Very filling and rich! However, very time consuming. Wish I didn't try this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving. Sorta stressed me out trying to make fresh pasta.

This is an amazing recipe.  I made it three years ago for the family Potluck Thanksgiving Dinner.  I still have people ask me for the recipe.  It was sooo good!  The sorrel was hard to find, and expensive, but I'd never change the recipe since it was soooo good.
