I admit I haven't found a way to prepare Brussels Sprouts that I don't like but this way tops them all!  They turn a lovely, bright, fresh green which provides eye appeal, then you get to the taste - buttery, slightly sweet, slightly earthy and all the way delicious. The 1/4 cup of butter made me nervous, but they are not greasy at all.  I didn't have honey butter so I simply drizzled about a large tsp of honey over them when they were almost done and mixed it in as I transferred to a serving bowl. The wine just pulls it all together.  I may add a bit of minced garlic to the onions next time.  And there will be many next times. Thank you, Pat.

I'm not a fan of Brussels Sprouts but I think this dish is delicious! I followed the recipe as-is.

Love Brussels Sprouts, but hate the trimming and chopping.  This recipe inspired be to break out my vitamix.  Took no time to prepare this delish dish.

Love Brussels! And this is a great recipe for them. I didn't have honey butter so I added some honey after melting the butter. I added garlic to the onions, and will add more next time. I also added pine nuts, though too late in the cooking. Next time I will toast them before adding them. Thank you Pat for a tasty new way to enjoy Brussels.

OK, so I might as well had made a new recipe, but this was a great start. I was craving tacos and didn't want to use regular greens, so I did this recipe. I'm a vegetarian so I opted the bacon and I didn't have cooking wine, so I opted that out too. Just used butter and honey because I didn't have honey-flavored butter and sliced the sprouts because my processor was too small. Added this as a taco base to my black bean taco (sour cream, cheese and fresh salsa), oh my god - it was amazing, really gave the taco flavor.

I did white wine vinegar instead of white cooking wine because apparently I can't read.  As I was getting ready to write the review I saw that it called for cooking wine.  I wasn't going to write the review, but she does add at the end that you could substitute apple cider vinegar...don't!

I made it as the recipe said, using honey with the butter and herb vinegar instead of wine vinegar. It was dull. I prefer the whole Brussels Sprouts. Next time I will leave them whole. I think I will like it better.

Really yummy!  I love brussels sprouts but never tried it shredded.  I cut some lengthwise and shredded some and it came out great.   I also added a little bacon grease for flavor!  Thanks, Pat.
