This was a really decadent, and very rich dessert. The name alone conjures up an image that  might not be enticing to some. Don't let that scare you away. This was very, very good. This combines two of my favorite things, cheesecake and pecan pie minus the pecans......what's not to love? I happened to have a deep dish pie crust in my freezer so that's what I used instead of homemade. The brown sugar layer was too much and would have over flowed the pie so, I did pour some into a small custard cup and bake that off separately. A very pleasant surprise and something I most likely will make again.

This was SO good, and easier to make than I thought. I didn't have a crust, or ingredients to make pie crust, so I used Graham Cracker Crumbs to make a crust.  I also had less corn syrup and brown sugar than I thought, so I halved the recipe after reading the review about having too much.  It was terrific, and the amount of filling was perfect.

I was testing pies for an upcoming church contest and this is great!  I had to substitute quick oats for the rolled and it was a little chewy, but still fantastic.  Plan to make again with the rolled oats. Reminds me a a combination of cheesecake and pecan pie.

I really loved this - I didn't know what to expect with the cream cheese in it but it was just great all together - very sweet, but pecan pie is also. Now and then a sweet treat is needed :)

Really delicous.  I made two pies at once and there was enough of the syrup filling for 3, in deep dish pie shells.  If I do this again, I will make extra cream cheese mixture and get a 3rd crust.

I liked the sound of this recipe and made some changes to it after reading some of the reviews.  I only had quick oats not rolled so instead of the amount called for I used 1/4 cup of quick oats.  It didn't come out chewy like others has mentioned.  Also, there was too much filling for my 9 inch pre-made pie crust.  I ended up with about 1 cup left over.  It seemed like a waste to me.

This got mixed reviews in my house.  I really enjoyed it, and though it had a very rich, creamy, buttery taste. It was a great combo of cheesecake and carmel.  I was suprised to find that the top didn't become crunchy, though.  It was a very chewy top layer.  I still enjoyed it.  My boyfriend, however, gave it a rating of "eh."  He thought it tasted fine, but was not interesting enough to make again.

This pie was really good!! I loved the chewiness of the oatmeal. I accidentally added 1 cup of 1/2 splenda and 1/2 regular sugar,instead of the 1/3 cup. I backed off of the brown sugar( I used splenda brown sugar)  a  little and it was just fine.It was diffidently a much cheaper pie and tasted fabulous just the same!! Thanks Arjherell. I will make this one again! :)
