Great bread; at first the crust seems rock hard, but then you bite into it and it crumbles into flakey bits and the inside is moist. In a word, awsome bread(ok, so it's two words)

Upon first viewing this recipe, I saw that this was one creation of which I would like to make, though I must admit that I was very overwhelmed by the amount of ingredients and time that it would take to make it. Minutes, no, hours passed, and low and behold, here in my very own hands I held, yes, I, that is me, Guido, I, Guido, held my very own Selkirk Bannock! For the flavor I added little cherry-tomatoes as eyes and a pecan as a puckered lip (hehe, made me laugh to look at him). Anyhow, I later cut a piece of him with my favorite knife (which I like to call the "Galleto"), brought it to my lips, and touched it to my tongue. The flavor was of vinegar; the flavor was of salt; the flavor was of pure white sugar which I ground from the cane this morning; the flavor... was beautiful! I can verily understand why the Queen would have but nothing else with her tea!

Crusty on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside.  I thought the raisins would be overwhelming, but they were delicious.  I omitted the egg yolk glaze because I was low on eggs, but it was just fine without.

What did I do wrong?  My dough was very dry and did not rise as my breads usually do.  I checked other recipes and they called for more milk and less flour.  Should I use the amounts called for in other recipes?

Real easy to make and delicious. I didn't use as much raisins as the recipe call for because it seems like a lot for the dough, but the bread still turned out great! Will definitely make again

Delicious! Try it with some melted butter and cinnamon mixed with sugar and it tasted just like Canadian beaver tails!!
