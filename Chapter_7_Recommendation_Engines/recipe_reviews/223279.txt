I love this recipe, it was wonderful. I followed the recipes but, I did omitted the grape tomatoes. My husband, who is 100% meat and potatoes kinda guy, he said I understand why you like it. That pretty much means he wont eat it but it wasn't horrible. This is recipe is one you can make and keep in the fridge. It stores well so you can have a yummy pre-made side dish for the next few days.

I followed this recipe exactly, i did really like the french lentils.I  did not like the flavor.  I have  used sherry vinegar before but I think this recipe could use something warmer in flavor.

Great flavors! I added red onions instead of chives and white basalmic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar.

I loved this recipe. I made it as written and my husband ate all the leftovers while I was at work the next day! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for a new side dish!

Excellent stuff! I used chicken bullion and water. I saved the liquid after cooking the lentils and then added white wine and reduced down with onions in it. I used this as a sauce for the salad. Careful not to add too much bullion as it will make the sauce very salty.
