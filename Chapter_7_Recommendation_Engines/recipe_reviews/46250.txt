Awesome recipe.  I'd had mashed turnip and carrots, and plain old mashed turnips, but with the potatoes they were so creamy...the flavor was wonderful.  I used light cream instead of milk, and didn't measure it- I poured until I got the right consistency for the way we like mashed potatoes.  Got rave reviews from hubby and parents- a definate keeper.

I like this recipe, but "one turnip" just isn't enough information, since turnips come in such a wide range of sizes. (Note how several reviews said it tastes just like mashed potatoes.) Better to specify approximate weight!

I'm not a big turnip fan, but mashed turnips are a part of the holiday meal whenever my family serves turkey.  This year it was my turn to prepare the feast, so I tried this recipe.  Only change was I used brown sugar instead of white, and added a bit more butter (can't remember if it calls for it in the recipe or not!).  It turned out wonderful!  Even my father, who hates turnips but dutifully takes a spoonful each year, got up for a second helping.  Thank you for a nice change to the traditional mashed turnip!!

I've never had Turnips at all. I love mashed potatoes, so, seeing as my produce box had a Turnip, thought I would try it.
We were not disappointed. Will definitely make again. 
I used red potatoes and I also used brown sugar instead of white, it added some extra flavor to it. Add the salt and pepper as you are serving. Enjoy!

A very good recipe for (as others have stated) Holiday dinner gatherings. I usually "drape" my turkey with bacon slices so once the turkey's cooked, I simply crumble up the bacon slices and add them (with 1 T. of the turkey drippings) to the root mixture. Turnips are bland, so for simpler occasions (such as a normal family meal), I slice up a yellow onion and cook it along with a couple of bacon slices. I've also been known to toss in some chopped scallion greens OR parsley OR chives OR cilantro just before serving to give it both some added flavor and some color (garlic lover that I am, I do NOT recommend adding garlic to this; too overpowering even for my tastes). This dish goes very well with a beef roast, pork chops and roasted chicken, too. Also, carrots can be substituted for the turnips and you wouldn't necessarily need to add any sugar. All in all, a good, hearty side addition to any cold day meal.

At first this recipe sounded kind of bland and I was very leary of trying it. But I had two turnips and had no idea how to prepare them. I found it to be a bit too sweet for my liking, but that could be my fault. I had two turnips to use, so I increased the potatoes to 4 large potatoes and increased the sugar to 2 tsp. I used Yukon Gold potatoes which have their own richness. I think I used too much sugar, 1 tsp would have been good. All in all a great recipe.

This was very easy to make, and I nice change from having plain mashed potatoes as a side. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed it. We also made it adding some shredded old-nippy cheddar cheese on top for the last step, which gave it a nice touch as well.

When my husband described what he was making for dinner (this dish) I said oooh that doesn't sound very good.
Well I ate my words and gobbled up 2 servings as this was incredibly good! 
I didn't see the point of cooking it lid on/lid off though. Thanks Nanna!

I have awarded fewer stars only because a novice cook needs "cup" measurements for the potatoes and turnip. Also after reading the recipe and several of the reviews I have also concluded that the turnip is correctly "rutabaga". Using the wrong vegetable in the recipe would make a tremendous difference in texture and taste! Rutabaga would be the correct one to use. I find turnips are rather tasteless and 'watery'. I have made something very similar in the past using rutabaga...thanks for the reminder...it is very tasty alternative way to serve potatoes and I will be making it again soon.

Yummmmm!!!  We substituted stevia in for the sugar and cut back a little on the butter and hubs and I loved 'em.  Kids like these okay, though they usually prefer standard mashed potatoes of one sort or another more (but with time, I think they'll learn to love these too! - learning to like grits was that way for them too....).  NOW, THE EXTRA BEAUTY OF THIS DISH IS....that, for those watching their weight, the addition of turnips cuts back on the amount of calories eaten via mashed potatoes, making it possible to eat more, and these are quite tasty to my way of thinking.  Not quite as versatile as whipped or country style mashed potatoes, but a lovely change of pace.  A very useful, tasty recipe!  Thanks for posting!  (BTW, we are not quite so likely to heat the oven if it's not already on, so sometimes we enjoy these straight from the pot instead of from a casserole.

My first attempt at turnips. I received some from a friend's CSA box. and did not know what to do with them. I made this recipe and it turned out well. I added only a little bit of sugar. I wonder if it is necessary at all. Thank you, Nana.

So we never had turnips before and I saw them cooking mashed turnips on that Famous Food Channel/Network and decided I would look for an easy recipe to try this. When I brought home the ingredients to cook, my fiance immediately started complaining about not wanting to eat turnips..but I proceeded none the less. I'm glad I did, these were awesome!! I make mashed potatoes a lot and adding the mashed turnips add a wonderful zest and flavor. I absolutely loved this recipe and will be making it many many more times. Thanks!!!

Tasty!  I diced & then roasted the taters & turnips, also used Yukons and about 5 medium.  Didn't realize I was pretty much out of butter, so I only added 1 tbsp.  The sugar gave the turnips a little extra kick.  Neat change for mashed taters.  Adding some cheese & garlic might be good too.

Tasted mostly like mashed potatoes with a funny after-taste. They weren't very creamy either (I think because of the consistency of the turnips).

I've never tried turnips, and our family liked this. It wasn't amazing, but I give it 4 stars because it got us to try a new food. We probably won't grow turnips again, but we will definitely use this recipe if they are given to us!

My first time ever eating turnips.  This was delicious.  I used cream instead of milk (no milk on hand) and I didn't add any sugar.  I also didn't cover it at all in the oven.  I'll be making this often.

Great base recipe. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I do feel it needed the brown sugar, not white, and also needed more salt. I also added parsnips to the mix. I ended up with 1 parsnip and 1 turnip to every 2 potatoes. This made a delightful mashed blend. Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was fantastic.  I used 3 medium potatoes and 3 medium turnips.  I also boiled some diced onions with the turnips/potatoes.  I probably could have used a little less milk.  Next time I will gradually add the milk until I get the proper consistency.

We've totally given up on regular mashed potatoes. Go this way with or without the sugar and you won't go back. Way better for you too! Thought it would have a funky taste, nope.

Really enjoyed this side dish. Paired it with venison backstrap. I might try adding an extra turnip next time as it wasn't quite enough for my family of 5.

A real turnip taste, which I love. Simple but lovely.

I'm about to make this for the second time, it's a wonderful way to get creamy rich potatoes without using as much butter or milk/cream as I do for just potatoes. These are not rutabaga as far as I can tell (rutabaga are orange, and more bitter- turnip are white and if you peel enough off, there is very little bitterness to them). I used purple top turnip, and it was awesome. I was worried hubby and babs might not go for turnip flavour, but they loved them too. A new staple in our house.

I made this recipe tonight mainly because I had two turnips on hand from another recipe. My family and I loved it, such a nice change from just mashed potatoes. Served with meatloaf, a typical comfort meal. I did use four medium potatoes and kept all of the measurements the same as printed in the recipe. Turned out delicious. I would recommend this for a surprisingly yummy change.

I doubled the recipe b/c I had so many potatoes--and it was devoured by the kiddos in no time. Calling it "Mashed Turnips" is a misnomer, though. This is mashed potatoes with added turnip. The turnip adds a nice unexpected sweetness every once-in-a-bite. You will really need to add salt to taste, and we added Herbomare and kelp to pop up the flavor, using a nice medley of multi-colored fingerlings for hte potatoes. Looked gorgeous with the purple skins ON and tasted really good. Saving this to the recipe box. Thanks.

This recipe turned out great on the first try. I didn't make any modifications. My family loved it and it was a great way to use some of the fresh potatoes and turnips we got from our CSA. No more boring ole mash potatoes. These potatoes had a nice kick to them.

My husband loved this!  My kids gobbled it down, too.  I'm giving it a four-star for now, only because I used rutabaga instead of turnip - and the smell brought back icky rutabaga childhood memories.  Will definitely make again - next time using turnip instead.  Might earn a five-star from me then.

Very good!  I bought some turnips at my farmers' market and didn't feel like putting it in chicken veggie soup this time, so I tried this recipe.  I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top before allowing it to brown.  We enjoyed it greatly.  Thanks!

Tatees and Meeps as us Scots would call it!  As a matter of fact, this will become a more regular side dish in the winter instead of plain mashed potatoes.  Very good!

As another reviewers said, turnips can vary dramatically in size. I solved the problem by measuring roughly the same amount of potatoes and turnips. Next time will definitely omit sugar add another 1/2 tsp salt.

I was looking for recipes to use turnips that a neighbor shared with us, and I thought this might be a good one to try.  I used one large sweet potato instead of the white potatoes, and left out the sugar and salt.  I also used just a tablespoon of butter and used just a little half and half in lieu of the milk.  I followed the cooking instructions as written (without adding anymore butter) and it came out great.   Very satisfying.

I made this for Thanksgiving for my sister who adores turnip.  It was a hit with many folks, some of who are not familiar with turnip. I would definitely make it again - it's an interesting, but not overbearing taste.

This was really good, the only thing that I didn't make sure of was the fact of checking to make sure that all the water had drained out of the pot when I drained the potatoes/turnips. They wound up a tad moist but were still good. I will definitely make these again.

I love this recipe. The turnips added sweetness to the mashed potatoes, and it make it less dense. I used equal parts turnip to potatoes (a little more potatoes).

Out of necessity I used a pinch of cayenne pepper in this as I was out of black pepper. It turned out very moist and so flavor full that no one at my dinner bothered to put butter or gravy on my mashed turnip and enjoyed it as served.

I always liked this recipe but I was surprised that my husband liked it.  He didn't think he was going to like it either.  Good stuff!

I love this recipe.  I got the biggest turnip I could find in the store and made the recipe exactly as it is written.  It did not brown but was still really yummy.  It was my favorite part of Christmas dinner!!!!

This was really good and really easy. An exciting variation on mashed potatoes. Great for a big feast but not a small 2-3 dish meal. Because it is so simple you need the variety of the other dishes to complement.

I don't eat turnips, but those who do say it was pretty good.

YUM! We loved these! I did not know what to do with my turnip and am thankful I tried this out - it was delicious.

Pretty good.  Mostly tasted like regular mashed potatoes though since the recipe just uses one turnip.  In fact, probably would taste quite the same without it.

This turned out really scrumptious, especially alongside the "Modenese Pork Chops" also on allrecipes.com.  Will make this again!

This just wasn't great. It was almost indistinguishable from your standard mashed potatoes.
