Soooooo good! My 4 yr old ate 1 1/2 of these. Hubby wasn't so thrilled with the idea of it, but then ate 2 himself! I had no spicy brown mustard so I added what I had....honey mustard! Turned out great! My Son said, "This recipe is a keeper Mom"! I agree. We added our veggies into our sandwiches to make it more like a loose meat burger. This is a stand alone or 'beef' it up kind of recipe. Thank you for it.

I made as is.  Some of my family members don't like pickles so I had some with and without.  Since I tasted both, I have to admit that the pickles give it a nice kick.  While doing AS IS, I thought that the meat had a nice flavor but could need extra seasoning or oomph.  I think that some of the suggestions of onions, garlic or garlic power, or others could help it out.  However, this is a quick slap it together meal and I am ok with not really tweaking it.  I would highly suggest going through the step of putting the sandwiches in the over for 10 minutes!  It takes the crumbly mixture which would normally fall out of the sandwich and nicely blends it with the bread.  Great idea!

This was pretty good overall. The pickle made it a bit salty though and I cut them a little too thick too. Maybe dill relish would work as well and be easier? The beef had a nice flavor but you do have to like mustard as it is dominant. I think adding some garlic and onion to the beef would give additional flavor and some depth to this dish. I used garlic salt instead of plain. Mine took 15 min in the oven to heat through. I'd give this one 3.5 stars. Thanks Verno1, I enjoyed trying this and might make it again.

Yum, we liked these a lot! If you're from Wichita, KS, you will recognize these as Nu Way burgers. These are pretty much exactly like the restaurants sandwiches, which is exactly what I was hoping for. I think next time I will add onions to the ground beef mixture, but other than that, it was perfect. The only thing that I changed when I made it this time was cutting the recipe in half because there were only two adults and one small child eating. Thank you for the recipe!

We really liked these.  I added onion and garlic to the beef as I cooked it and left out the salt (I think the chicken broth was salty enough).  I also didnt put on bread and put it in the oven.  Instead I served with artisan bread fresh out of the oven and we each put our own mustard and pickles on.  When my husband got seconds, he forgot the mustard and pickles.  He thought it just wasn't the same without them so he got up to get them.  Thanks for a great recipe.

LOVED these!  I live in the midwest and near my hometown we have a Maidrite sandwich shop.  These are sooooo close to the taste of their maidrites.  I omitted the 1/4 of yellow mustard and they were wonderful.  My husband said they were possibly the best maidrites he has ever had.

What a great lunch! Scored ground sirloin for $2.50lb and wanted something other than tacos, hamburgers or pasta w/meat sauce and THESE hit the mark.  My husband does not like dill pickles so put hot pepper hoagie relish on his. I put the pepper relish and pickles on mine. I did brown the meat in butter with onion and served in hot dog rolls (all I had) which kept the meat in & less messy. I put white American cheese on before baking.  BAKING is a MUST! Do NOT skip that step!!! Tastes like a poor man's Philly Cheese Steak.....this will be a regular lunch item in our house.  USE A POTATO MASHER to help break up the meat!!

This is super tasty! I made enough for two people so I used 1 lb ground beef, half a can of beef broth, and lots of onion powder, worcester, and spicy mustard to simmer the meat in. I also added onion. It was great! I will make it again!

Best loose meat recipe that I can find online. Made the recipe for four instead of twelve. DH is eating gluten free so we had mashed potatoes instead of buns.  Had mixed veggies on the side. You could say we had deconstructed cottage pie.

Our family of 9 liked this recipe.  We did half of the sandwiches with pickles and half without per kid request.  We also left off the mustard on the bun and let everyone put on their own condiments when it came out of the oven.

Wasn't too sure about this but we ended up really liking it and will make it again.  Scaled it back using only 2 lb of ground beef.

I really am giving this 4 1/2 stars only because of the changes I made - I diced up an onion and added to the meat when I cooked the meat - Used venison - I added a small can of mild green chile to my liquid, used and I also added some accent - Meat came out wonderful! - To my buns I put a slice of American cheese on one half and ketchup on the other - I was really worried my husband would not eat it because of the chile and mustard - But he loved it and came back for a 2nd one

Very cool!!! I had never had a loose meat sandwich before let alone made one...I really loved it. I used beef broth instead of chicken broth and I didn't crumble the meat as much so the flavor would soak in. The beef broth gave it a lot more flavor! Be careful not to use too much yellow mustard on the buns as it will take away from the flavor of the meat! This is an awesome recipe! I have shared it with family and they loved it too!

These were tasty!  I didn't use the oven.  I did add extra broth and used sandwich rolls.  The extra juice soaked into the roll and made it extra tasty.  Very easy to make.  All three of my teens enjoyed them, so I will be making this again.

A great switch up to sloppy joes!  Didn't have spicy brown mustard, so used yellow mustard, a dash of ground turmeric, and some minced garlic.  It was really good!

We had these for dinner this evening! Very glad we did!! Super tastey! I did make a few changes though. I was in a hurry so did not bake the sandwiches also I didn't use the extra mustard on the buns. I used mustard powder instead of the spicy mustard. Last but not least I added fresh garlic. It was seriously delicious. Whole family loved it ! I will definitely be making this again. Thank you & A+++ verno1 !

These are very tasty! I prefer this type of thing instead of sloppy Joes. I usually just halve the recipe, but otherwise keep it the same. If I'm short on time, I don't even bother baking them. I just toast the buns and fill them with meat and pickles and eat them like that.

This was great! I stuck to the recipe exactly except for adding some minced garlic and onion powder to the beef. This recipe was super easy and I didn't find it too salty at all. I may add some cheese next time- kept thinking the whole time I was eating that the only way this would be better is with a big old classy plop of cheez whiz on it!

These were SUPER YUMMY! I was skeptical, but have wanted to try these for a while now, and decided to go for it...so glad I did! The meat was very flavorful, but I have to admit that I cooked the meat w/ some chopped onion, just because I had it on hand to use (I don't think it was enough to affect the flavor much). I never thought the meat would soak in all that liquid, but it did, though it took longer than stated (maybe more like 40-45 minutes), which was fine with me. I only made 1/3rd of the recipe, and that was plenty for us. I'm used to sloppy joes, but these were an awesome change from that. I also served ketchup on the side in case anyone wanted to add any...it was good like that too! I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The flavor was sensational. Very savory and a bit salty. Exactly the kind of food I craved when I was pregnant!

The only downside to this recipe is that it's a bit messy for kids 6 years old and younger. They'll love the flavor, but you'll have lots of little pieces of meat to wipe up at the end of the meal.

I love mustard, but this literally made me gag, it was sooooooo strong. We had frozen burritos instead. Needless to say I won't ever make it again.

I made as described, except I added one slice of chopped Vidalia onion when browning the meat.  I also used honey mustard as did the other reviewer (you couldn't tell it was honey mustard in the finished sandwich.  After reading all the reviews, I took their advice and didn't skip the oven part - I'm glad I didn't.  Hubby/I both enjoyed these and I'll make them again!

When the only meat you have on hand is ground beef and you just can't stomach another tomato dish, this recipe saves the day! Really love this recipe, so does my husband, it is a staple for us!

I guess I don't get the Midwest Loosemeat thing.  These were way to mustard-y and salty for us.

These are very, very good. I've made them 3 or 4 times now and followed the recipe exactly. I think one of the key reasons they are so good, believe it or not, is the wrapping in foil and warming in the oven. It makes the bun nice and soft and slightly solidifies (for lack of a better word)  the meat so it doesn't fall out while eating. Do not skip this step.

This recipe is a home run big time!   I added a bit more pepper, and I browned the hamburger in a little water to make it crumbly, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.   I served the meat on large onion sandwich rolls. This  is not a recipe for Maid Rites, which I got to eat when visiting cousins in Iowa as a kid, but it is super good in it's own right!  I suggest not skipping the oven warming of assembled sandwiches at the end - I think that last step makes a difference.  Unwrap em, press em down to anchor the crumbly meat, and Pig Out!  Fantastic.

It was pretty freaking tasty!  I added a slice of Kraft cheese  and extra pickles to each sandwich and onion and garlic powder to the meat but pretty much followed the rest of the recipe. Got great reviews from family. Definitely will make again!

This was great and so easy. Both my picky-eating kids loved it as did my husband. I used beef broth instead of chicken because that's what I had on hand. Will make again!

Love love LOVE this!  I added onion powder and it was amazing! Double what you think you will eat because everyone will want more. I've made it twice in 2 weeks! Don't skip the tin foil toasting in the oven part, it makes it perfect! Once done, I did a thin layer of mayo on the top, perfect creaminess!

The sandwiches were pretty tasty. Definitely need to put in oven so that the bread gets a little toast to it. I followed the recipe, but added onion to my sandwich. I'm quite sure that I will make these again.

I have  friend from Iowa who introduced me to loose meat sandwiches a few years back.  his family owns a restaurant there and they ship them to him frozen.  I have been trying to recreate them ever since and this was right on the money!  super simple but delicious.  was a big hit with everybody.  kept the extras wrapped and made for an easy lunch during the week!

I made this recipe a few times as is, then found I liked it better when I doubled the amount of spicy brown mustard and worcestershire sauce.

I followed the directions and added nacho cheese to the middle of each sandwich.  AHHH...MAZE....ING!!!  I had a couple of things not turn out perfect though; 1st was that the meat with liquid step never evaporated for me, 2nd was that the burgers stuck to the foil (will spray with pam next time), and 3rd was the bun ended up slightly soggy.   None of these creating big problems, just a bit of a hiccup.
