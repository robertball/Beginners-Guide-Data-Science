I definitely recommend coconut milk and Kashmiri chile powder instead of jalapeno.  This way there is more of a blended flavor and not chunks of jalapeno which I find annoying in many recipes not only Mexican food for which they may be intended.  Roast your spices in a dry pan or with your onion to release their flavor.

Very good! I used light coconut milk in place of the regular. Even the kids liked this. I recently made a 'regular' version of this for the first time, which we all loved, but this was great for something on the healthier side. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
