My family loves this recipe! I would use three eggs next time. You could use ground beef instead of pulled pork or beef and add some taco ingredients to turn them into taco bites. We love eating them with sour cream.

This has football season written all over it. What a scrumptious little bite. My pork didn t have a strong barbeque flavor so I would add some barbeque sauce the next time to pump up that flavor. I added more cheese than requested in the recipe (personal preference). Be sure to allow them to cool slightly in the pan so they have a chance to firm.

I used regular bbq sauce no pork to make this vegitarian. I also used brown rice & white beans & measured them out equally. I will definitely make this a lot more with any type if beans or rice. I love them thank you.

I made only slight changes only because of what I had on hand... I used an 8.5 oz packet of quinoa and brown rice and because I used shredded pork from leftover carnitas I added about 1/4 c. BBQ sauce to the 1 1/2 c of meat. I also accidentally used 3 eggs instead of 2. That was my error but it still turned out really well. I don't have a mini-muffin tin so I used a regular size tin and baked them for 28-30 minutes. This perfectly filled 12 regular-sized muffin. My family really liked the taste. I will make them again.

These were a huge hit at our backyard 4th of July BBQ! Several people requested the recipe. I did use about 2 cups of the cheese and after letting them cool I had no problem with them firming up! I served them with a homemade ranch BBQ dip!

I could have sworn that I reviewed this before. This is our go-to dish for leftover meats. My family loves these and gobbles them up. Since I am using up leftovers and have odd amounts of meat my rule of thumb is equal amounts of meat cooked rice and cheese and adjust eggs accordingly. I usually sub onion for the beans. It doesn't have to be BBQ sauce either. I've used it with leftovers in other kinds of sauces including chicken tikka masala. The only downside is they sticks to the paper liners really bad so I use non-stick baking tins without the paper liners.

has a good flavor but didnt firm up enough - seemed to be too rice-y (according to the family). I tried to make patties and cooked them like hamburgers and then put them on buns and it was a pain but the family liked them like that as well! worth a try - I may even give it another go but I'll have to be bored to do so.
