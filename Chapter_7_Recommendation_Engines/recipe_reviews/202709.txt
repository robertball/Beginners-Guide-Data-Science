LOVE LOVE LOVE! Fun, easy to make,  and oh so yummy! Didnt have green onion so I used recipe white onion and sauteed with turkey. I grated the ginger root and only needed about 1-2 teaspoons. I love the toppings - the carrots, sprouts , and peanuts are awesome on these wraps! I also used hoison sauce as a topping. This is a recipe my husband and I LOVED!

Very tasty. I messed with the seasonings a bit as I like my food to be on the spicier side. Extra ginger and I added about 2 tbs sambal (chili paste) to the meat and veggie mix while cooking. Also served it with a dipping sauce made from hoisin with a little sambal and rice vinegar. Will definitely use this again.

left out the noodles, orange zest and half of the ginger root - used baby bellas instead of shiitake, because that is what I had on hand. Delicious!

Outstanding! I've made this twice now, omitting the brown sugar and mai fun to make the filling lighter. Everyone (including the kids) was surprised at how good it is, even those who don't like ground turkey. I am making it a third time as a hot appetizer for Easter dinner.

Delicious.  Also made with tofu which was great as well. The wraps were so flavorful you hardly needed a dipping sauce and my 2 and 5 year old enjoyed them as well.  Great recipe!

Yum.. I really liked these. Minor change was adding some broccoli and cabbage to the turkey mixture ( needed to use it up) I wasn't able to find rice noodles so I used shirataki noodles

This was awesome!  I loved the combination of flavors.  We're big fans of PF Chang's Lettuce Wraps and we think this was just as good!  I'm not a big fan of orange zest or bean sprouts so I left them out & didn't seem like it was missing anything.

Thanks for the recipe!  Was yummy!  A little sweet (maybe I put too sugar much accidentally), but with the Thai sweet chili, it was perfect.

I made this with Vietnamese vermicellie instead and wrapped spring rolls.  Was great too!

We made this tonight. It was a hit! I would give it 5 stars, but it was a lot of work. zesting, chopping, grating, mincing, saute and washing off each lettuce leaf! an hour and 20 minutes later...IT WAS DELICIOUS! We didnt have shitake mushrooms, plain mushrooms were still very good. Lettuce wrap fell apart so quickly. I decided to make it a "salad". Even though it was alot of work, I will make it again.

I was looking for something different to make with turkey. Although this wasn't a bad base recipe, it definitely lacked taste; just kind of bland.  I took out the noodles and brown sugar for a more healthy recipe.  Next time I plan on adding a little hoison sauce.

Everyone loved this!  The kids didn't have a clue that the green onions were even in it.    We left out the mushrooms since one family member is allergic to them, but it was delicious even without them.  The Sweet chili sauce was great on them.

I felt like I was eating at a great Thai restaurant! I had stellar results when following this recipe exactly as written. I'll probably cut the orange zest in half next time but that is just personal preference.  All of these flavors are excellent together and it doesn't need changing.  Easily feeds 4. Thank you blancdeblanc for a great recipe!  Just a note though, when cooking the rice I believe the recipe is supposed to say 6oz of mai fun rice noodles per 2 cups of water, the cooking instructions for the mai fun rice noodles were otherwise correct. You could also easily substitute different mushrooms without hurting the end result. And a $$ saving hint, shop at your local asian market and you will find most of the ingredients for this recipe sometimes 1/2 the cost of supermarkets - especially dried mushrooms you just reconstitute and use.

Loved this recipe! Tasted just as good, if not better, than restaurant lettuce wraps. Didn't change a thing and they turned out perfect. If I wasn't eating, I was saying how much I liked them! Will make this again, and again.

Excellent! I love PF Chang's lettuce wraps and wanted to make something similar at home. These fit the bill. Even my super picky kid had seconds.

I am new to asian cooking but found these to be easy to make and very good. I feel like adding the sweet chili sauce was a must and added a star to the recipe!

This is fabulously delicious, all the flavors make a great combination!    I made a few slight adjustments, I seasoned the turkey with salt and pepper, I substituted baby portobello mushrooms, and I added 2 teaspoons Sambal(chili paste) because I like a little bit of heat.   I did make my own Tamarind Cashew Dipping Sauce just as a preference.   I always keep Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce on hand, and my family loved the pairing of this sauce with the meal.

I added some red, orange and yellow pepper diced extremely fine to the ground turkey mixture a few minutes before it was finished cooking.  We ate the first servings on lettuce, as in the recipe.  Since there are only two of us, we had leftover meat and noodle which I mixed together and refrigerated.  My husband decided to heat it up and snack on the leftovers with some whole wheat (100 calorie bread round) toast.  It was  spectacular.   The flavors became better with time to blend.  We especially loved the subtle orange zest flavor mixed with the savory onion and garlic and cilantro.s

Yes they are a bit of work with all the chopping but well worth the time.  I used regular mushrooms and used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.

This recipe was great! Tasted so good, couldn't even tell it was turkey. The only thing I did different was grate some carrots into the recipe to cook with it. It gave it extra color. And I also topped it with shaved carrot as a topping.

So yummy! I didn't have lettuce so I finely chopped cabbage and put this on top and it was so good!  For my taste next time I would add a little more ginger, other than that it is perfect.

Awesome. Replaced sesame oil with white cooking wine and added sesame seeds.  Reduced sugar by 1/2.  Next time will add more shitake mushrooms.  Thank you for the recipe!! Delicious!
