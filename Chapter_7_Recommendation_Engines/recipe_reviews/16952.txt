I reviewed this recipe almost a year ago but I made some interesting changes and just had to share it with everyone on this site! I used the 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt and plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg as before. However, I am always interested in making recipes healthier so instead of margarine, oil or butter I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I often buy applesauce in those little single serving cups and one container is exactly 1/2 cup. Perfect for baking since you don't have to open a whole jar of applesauce. I added chopped walnuts as before but I was out of vanilla, so I tossed in about a Tbsp of dark rum. Wow!! That is the secret to butt-kicking banana bread!! Use good quality rum, such as Puerto Rican or Dominican rum. A good rule of thumb is..if you wouldn't drink it, don't cook with it! Same goes for wine. I cannot stop eating this bread and now I don't feel guilty because it's low in fat if you use the applesauce instead of oil or butter. I really hope someone reads this review and tries the rum version I have come up with. Enjoy!!

This was exactly what I was looking for!  I had 3 overripe bananas that I was getting ready to throw out, instead the light bulb went off to look on Allrecipes for an easy banana bread recipe.  I chose this one based on the reviews and the simplicity of the ingredients.  The only slight changes I made was I used butter instead of margarine, switched the white sugar to half white and half brown, and cut back the flour to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. I also threw in 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon.  It turned out perfect in 45 min. (an hour would have dried the bread out) and it is dense and moist like banana bread should be!  Thanks Libby, I will probably make this weekly with my leftover bananas!

I've never made a really good banana bread until I tried this recipe this morning.  I did modify some things--used real butter, half white and half brown sugar, added 1 tbs cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, and a dash of salt.  I didn't measure the bananas, but used the four I had on hand that were mostly black on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside.  Sprinkled the top with sliced almonds, since it's what I had on hand.  It baked up beautifully in exactly one hour.  What a great Sunday breakfast!

I have made this recipe a bunch of times now.  My husband loves it, but I add walnuts for him. It is so easy and tastes great! I make muffins out of mine and bake for 35 minutes instead of 1 hour. Making muffins cuts the baking time down.  I want to add that I now make this with 1 cup flour and 1 cup oatmeal.  It is less dense and more moist this way.

The recipe is good, it's me baking the banana bread that is a work in progress!
I have asked members for tips that really helped: don't over mix, lower rack so that top of bread is halfway point in oven, my loaf dish is glass so lower temperature in my oven to 325 degrees and tent with foil if the top of loaf is getting too dark.  I did as others suggested modifying the recipe and used half cup white sugar/half cup brown sugar.

I was worried about how this was going to turn out because I'm not the very best cook!  I was shocked with the results because I actually made something that tasted very delicious!!!  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I also sprinkled walnuts on the top.  The picture does not do it justice this is an amazing bread!  I've made it 3 times this month- it's THAT good!  It was the biggest hit at a potluck party and it was all gone.  This recipe deserves 10 stars!!! Try it and you too will fall in love with it!

Very good banana bread!  Added about a tbls of some wonderful Mexican vanilla I have and a pinch of salt...My mom always says to use salt and baking soda together to assure an even rise.  Also used butter...don't care for margarine! Used three large ripe bananas...don't like measuring!  Took about 1 1/2 hours at 350.  YUM!  Making a second batch now!

My rating for kids is low because I don't have any children right now.  So I don't know how easy it is for a kid to make.  However, I like the way that it bakes up.  I am taking some with me for my sister-in-laws wedding brunch.  It's that good. Thank you Libby for sharing this receipe with everyone.

This recipe AWEsooooome!!!  I added about two cups over-ripe bananas instead of 1 1/2 cups  AND (y'all ready for this?!?!) I greased the pan with butter and then coated it with cinnamon sugar! It was great. The sweet crispy outside combined with the moist center made for a delectable treat!

For years I have been putting over ripe bananas in the freezer. They do turn black and get very mushy when thawed, but they get mashed anyway. When you want to make this bread, just thaw a few on a plate and squeeze into the batter.  Whenever I see bananas on the "reduced produce" rack, I buy them and put them in the freezer for a rainy day.

I loved this banana bread it was yummmmy!  I did double the recipe to make 2 loaves & I added 1 cup chopped walnuts & 2 tsp cinnamon.  It really gets me that there are people who completely change the recipe & then give it a low star rating as if what they had done didn't change it from being a good or in this case a great recipe into a not so good one.  ***** all the way! Thanks

FANTASTIC! i used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour, used applesauce instead of margarine and eggbeaters instead of the eggs. Also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4tsp salt, dash of nutmeg and 1/2 cup walnuts. Made 14 muffins- baked at 350 degrees for 30 mins. EVERYONE, even the ones not into banana bread was raving about this!

I followed the recipe w/the following changes: butter instead of margarine, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and added 1 tsp vanilla and a handful of chocolate chips. I took the advice of another reviewer and drizzled a little dissolved brown sugar over the top before baking, which made a delicious crust. YUM.

Great recipe for those who don't have sour cream on hand, like most recipes call for. I made the recipe using the suggestions of other reviewers. I used butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I added 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and about 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I baked it in an 8-inch cake pan for about 45-50 minutes. It came out great! Everybody loved it, especially my picky eater, 2 year old nephew! Great (modified) recipe. This will definitely be my go-to banana bread recipe.

THIS IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF BANANA BREAD...I took others' suggestions and used butter instead of margarine and used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar; cooked in a silicone loaf pan exactly 1 hour, then when almost cool wrapped the loaf in plastic wrap to keep it moist...I've made this 3 times already and it comes out perfect every time!  THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

I absolutely LOVE this banana bread! I made it exactly as recipe says and it's wonderful. It's a little crunchy on the outside and deliciously moist inside. It's got the mild banana flavor I was looking for without the walnuts overpowering it as it is in some recipes. This banana bread is...... perfect. Only thing is I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes (total of 1hr 15 min) but that could be due to varying oven temps, type of pan, or a number of other factors. I wouldn't do a thing to change this. Thank you SO much Libby!

This recipe was awesome, and so easy! My parents, siblings, and boyfriend have been devouring it. Soo good heated with butter, and the consistency of this bread is the best I've ever had. Moist, not too crumbly, rich.

My only changes were (I doubled the recipe): I didn't have margarine or very much butter, so I had to improvise and use a mixture of butter and applesauce for shortening. I also added 1 tsp of ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.

Helpful notes: I found that 2 whole bananas=1 cup mashed banana.

I made 1 loaf and 12 muffins--the muffins were done in about 25 minutes.

Good base recipe. Very versatile... I added 1 1/2 c. frozen blueberries.  Used 1 c. whole wheat flour + 1 c. unbleached all purpose flour.  Followed the other users comments... 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 c. splenda, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 tsp. salt and dash of cinnamon.  Sprinkled wheat germ on top before baking.

I love banana bread and am constantly trying to improve it by finding new recipes.  I followed the recipe, but used half white and half light brown sugar.  I also added a tablespoon of vanilla.  My boyfriend said it was the best one I've made yet (believe me, I've made a lot!) and he ate about half of the loaf in 10 minutes!  I will be making this again and again.  Sometimes, I like to toast a slice of the bread and put peanut butter on it...yum!

A delicious basic recipe that should be in everyone's recipe box! The ingredient list is nice and short, and most of it is readily available in ones cupboard at anytime!

I made this bread but used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar and I added 1 tsp. vanilla. I also used super ripe speckled banana's and coated the pan with a light layer of butter. 

Baked for 55 minutes at 350 degrees and this bread came out slightly dense, fluffy and moist. A family hit here in this household... even with the 6 1/2 yr old who loathes bananas!

I love this recipe!  It's even better when you add 15oz of Pumpkin Pie filling (with all the spices already in it).  Either way, the bread doesnt last long in my house and its so easy to make and doesn't call for many ingredients.

This was amazing! I was shocked to actually be able to find a recipe that didnt contain salt. I did change it up a bit. Some of the other reviews suggested vanilla and cinnamon. Sadly I discovered that I was out of vanilla so I used 1tsp of peppermint extract instead. I then added a dash of cinnamon as suggested. Then instead of using the cake pan I used three bread pans. In each of the three loaves I added different things. I added walnuts to one, dark chocolate and mint chips to another, and a mixture of all my leftover chips (white chocolate, butterscotch, and milk chocolate/peanut butter...whatever was in my cupboard) to the last one. Then I only needed to cook them for about 30 minutes. All in all...absolutely amazing! The walnut loaf is nearly gone and I dont expect to be bringing any home from Bible study tonight ;-)

This was tasty. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour, as well as 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar. I know it made mine more cake-like, but that was OK with me. I still like my mommas recipe better...but only she can make it that way. In the meantime, this will do just fine. Nice and easy which was great because my 3 year old wanted to help. Thanks!

This recipe is so simple! I prefer making banana bread as muffins resulting in a much shorter cooking time ~40 minutes at the most.

Just made this recipe as is and it is wonderful!  I made 12 regular sized muffins and 12 mini muffins.  I did half with mini chocolate chips for my hubby and kids, and the other half with a sweet cinnamon sprinkle on top - to give it that little bit of sweet cinnamon crunch - yum!  They are good both ways, but I prefer the cinnamon!  I have another great banana bread recipe, but it is more complicated to make and is more cake-like.  This is a real hearty comfort food kind of loaf.  Just what I was looking for.  And it doesn't get any easier than this, folks.  Thanks so much for the recipe

This is such an easy and versatile recipe - I've used it so often in the last few weeks, I know it by heart now. I make this recipe as mini-muffins (bake time is 13 minutes), and my 5 year-old absolutely LOVES them. They're sweet, but not too sweet - just perfect. And you can really play around with it, too - I've tried this recipe with applesauce, pumpkin and bananas, as suggested, but I've also used pureed canned peaches, pureed strawberries and also sweet potatoes. I bet just about any pureed fruit would work. My husband and kids had no idea they were actually eating healthy muffins! This one is a keeper!

EASY! The more ripe your bananas the better. Let them get as brown as possible. Makes the bread sweeter!

Perfect as is, I use this recipe every weekend for banana muffins (bake in 40 minutes). The only addition I make is a half a teaspoon of vanilla and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. I also use butter instead of margarine. It's an easy recipe with great results.

This is the recipe I've been making for a while, except I make it with 1 t of vanilla, 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t of salt.  Just gives it an extra little something.  This one is great with almost any kind of fruit, with nuts, without, with chocolate chips...the variations are almost endless - definitely my "go-to" quickbread recipe!

This is my all time favourite banana bread recipe.  I often make it just as is but also use it as a base to experiment with.  If I don't have enough bananas I use apple sauce....I sub brown sugar for white...wheat flour for white.....I sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon....I sub apple sauce for the marg.....I throw in oats or flax seeds or chia seeds..chopped apple..raisins...nuts...whatever suits my fancy at the time and I have never had a fail. My personal fav is as written with sugar and cinnamon on top. Thanks for sharing such a versitile recipe.  MMM, it's baking right now.

Just a fabulous, simple recipe.  As someone who always seems to have bananas that are turning, I had everything I needed right in the kitchen.  Instead of making it in a pan, I baked in a cupcake pan with papers.  Quick, easy, and delicious.

This was my first time making banana bread and it turned out great!  Only made a few changes - 1/2 cup extra virgin coconut oil instead of butter and I only used 1/2 cup of sugar (1/4 white & 1/4 brown).  I used three bananas, I didn't bother to measure them out.  It was perfectly cooked after 55 minutes.  I will try adding walnuts next time and maybe make muffins.  Thanks!

Upped the banana, so it needed to cook longer and ended up a little over-done.  Delicious, all the same.

LOVE this recipe. I've only had it in my recipe box for 1 month and  I've been making it once or twice a week.  Its very easy to adapt to be allergen free and its awesome with chocolate chips.  I especially love that its so easy and straightforward.  Thanks for sharing!

I always seem to have overripe bananas on hand, but my banana bread was never turning out right. This was hands down the easiest and best recipe for banana bread I've ever tried. I followed a couple reviews by adding a bit of vanilla extract and doing half white sugar and half brown. I also used baking powder instead of baking soda. I used 3 overripe bananas. The bread came out beautifully and -- big plus, here -- it didn't collapse in the middle like so many of my quick breads and cakes do. I want to try this again with walnuts and/or chocolate chips. Delicious.

I just made this and it was a delicious classic!! I made the changes that others suggested with adding 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, added some vanilla extract, cinnamon, and instead of the margarine added unsweetened applesauce ( I like to take the healthier route whenever I get the chance). The flour amount was fine for me, it came out nice and moist. I had to bake it for a little over an hour, halfway through I had to add the aluminum foil cover. Next time I'll add some walnuts. My first time making banana bread was a success, thank you!!

Smells incredible baking and is very delicious! I had 4 over-ripe bananas and followed a couple reviewer suggestions. 1/2 cup white sugar w/ a 1/2 cup of brown..added allspice, cinnamon, cinnamon sugar, vanilla extract, reduced the amount of flour and added about a 1/4 cup or so of oats. Makes 12 muffins! This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe! I followed someone's advice on here and made it with half white and half brown sugar, I used a half cup less of flour, and I added a dash of vanilla. It was so good! I left it in the oven for 45 min. instead of 1 hr and it just turned out so good! It was moist and thick. Just the way banana bread SHOULD be! Definitely a keeper, even though I altered it a little bit. =)

I just finished making two loafs of this banana bread. It came out absolutely YUMMY!!! After reading reviews on this recipe I ended up adding 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and aprox. 1 teaspoon. of extra virgin olive oil. I recommend the extras, think it gives added flavor and moisture.

great basic recipe. I like to add healthy ingredients when I can and this is a great recipe to do so. I used 1 cup flour and for the second cup a mixture of flax seeds, whole wheat, wheat germ and oatmeal and of course chopped walnuts. Little vanilla and a pinch of salt. Turned out perfect!! yummy.

I make this banana bread every week because it is so good.  I followed the recipe except I made it 1/4 cup sugar instead of the suggested 1/2 cup.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I use 9" x 5" GLASS and shortened the cooking time to 45 minutes.  The result, always moist and yummy!

I chose this recipe because the prep time was shorter than my mom's bread she always makes.  This is a very moist bread.  I changed margarine to unsalted butter, added a little vanilla, and chopped pecans. It made quite a bit of batter so I placed extra in a little loaf pan for my daughter. She liked having her own little loaf!!

I must add that my mom liked this recipe so much better than hers that she threw hers away!  LOL

This was so easy to bake and it tasted yummy!  I don't know what the others did differently but it came out moist and flavorful for me.  And it didn't get soggy the next day.  My 5 y/o daughter even helped bake this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I made the recipe with 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white, and I added about 2/3 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. I cooked mine in muffin tins with muffin liners for about 20 minutes. They turned out great!  I would add about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt next time.

I was truly impressed with this super simple recipe! We have made it several times,it's just delicious. My mom still does believe that I do not use any wet ingredients,it is so moist and flavorful! We don't really measure the bananna's-just 3 or 4. THANK YOU for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is a hit every time I make it however I thought the original recipe was a bit bland so I've always made the following adjustments Add: 1 tsp Vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and nuts if you like. Its Dense and moist and hits the spot when your looking for something to snack on that's not so dessert like but still sweet. I often gift them

This has been my go-to recipe for banana bread for some time now.  It is virtually fool proof and always disappears in my house. It is moist, dense and very delicious warm with butter on top.  I doubled the recipe last time I made this but only used 3 eggs (whoops!) and the bread still turned out wonderful

It was easy to make but just didn't taste banana(ey) enough.  I added some vanilla and a dash of cinnamon and more bananas the next time and it was much better.

Great recipe, I actually added some more banana (probably doubled it) and an extra egg. This forced me to add an extra ten minutes to the baking time. But an overall easy and incredibly delicious recipe, thanks!

This recipe is very good as written.  I have dozens of banana bread recipes and any variation is very slight.  However, I cannot imagine ANYONE feeling a need to put CINNAMON in banana bread.  It totally overpowers the banana flavor.

Me encanta esta receta, los plátanos que me van quedando muy maduros los uso el fin de semana para hacer este pan. A mi marido le encanta y en España no es popular, ya que aquí no se suele hacer esta receta. Así que estoy encantada con Allrecipes porque todo el mundo comparte su gusto con todo el mundo. yo no he cambiado nada, ni una coma de la receta!! Así es perfecta, aunque tengo ganas de probarla un día con algunos frutos secos, pasas o manzana....o chips de chocolate...!! Muchas gracias, Libby por tu receta y saludos desde España.

Very delicious! I used applesauce in lieu of the margarine, and it took about 4 medium sized bananas to make the appropriate amount of mash.

Excellent basic recipe. I read reviews and used some of their suggestions. I used butter instead of margarine, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1 tsp of vanilla, plus I divided the sugar 1/2 brown, 1/2 white. The bread was fantastic!!!! I gave 5 stars because this recipe is a really great basic recipe and a lot can be done with it. Thanks for sharing.

I've never been good at banana bread but this one is easy and delicious!  I added 2 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of cinnamon.  when the bread started to firm, i sprinkled the top with a cinnamon and sugar mixture.  Wonderful!  Absolutely Wonderful!

I used a little bit more bananas than the recipe called for. A little tid-bit, freeze the bananas when they start to go brown, that way when you are ready to make bread, all you do is thaw them out over-night and you have already mashed bananas for the baking. YUM

Great starter recipe! Took advice of other reviewers: 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown. 1 1/2 cup flour & 1/2 cup oatmeal. Added chopped walnuts. Sprinkled buttered pan with sugar on bottom, sides, & top of batter.  Thanks!

No modifications needed what-so-ever!!!! Followed recipe exactly and it was sinfully delicious! I made a test loaf first since i decided to give this to the neighbors as a holiday treat. OMG...it could not have been better. i did take it out of then oven 2 minutes early cause I couldn't wait to eat it. It made the house smell sooooo good upstairs and down while baking. banana bred is wonderful hot out of the oven but its even more 'banana-y" the following day. C'mon tomorrow!!!!

This is very moist, which I love. I added suggestions from other reviewers: Added a dash of cinnamon, used 3/4 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar. It's a hit at my house. Thanks!

I was surprised this recipe didnt state a pan size, so I just guessed. I didnt mash the banana completely, i left it chunky, I also followed advice from previous reviewers and used half cup brown sugar and half cup white. This was lovely :-)

this  was not good at all in my opinion...It didn't taste as if it was cooked, but it was. I was heavy and not tasty at all. I think it has to be missing an ingredient. I have gotten many recipes from this site and this was the worst.. sorry

This is a nice simple recipe with banana flavor. The bread is not very dense, I would say it has more of a cake-like texture.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried!  I have made it about 6 times in the past 2 months, and each time, it is devoured eagerly by my friends and family.  It comes out moist and yummy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  SOOOO good!  I love walnuts though, so I added about 3/4 cup of walnuts to the recipe.  Perfection in a pan!

Be sure to use over ripe bananas. This is a Great banana bread and the house smelled amazing while baking! The other recipes I tried left the bread uncooked in the center but when I found this recipe and the tip to put a piece of foil, shinny side down over the bread and continue to bake a few minutes, everyone raved over this bread! The only thing I added was one tbls. vanilla.

It is very good but a bit sweeter than necessary. Next time I will use less sugar, maybe 1/4 cup instead. I will also add some spices next time.

I have used only this recipe for my Banana Bread for over 6 years.  I still have it from when I decided to first give it a try - on 2/11/2008 when I printed it!!  I love this recipe!  When I make it, I usually make a HUGE batch! (I'm talking 8+ loaves at a time!). I have to - because I end up giving loaves away to those that heard I made a batch!  Friends will save their bananas for me so they will get a loaf the next time I bake them!  This bread is so good!  It is so moist and natually good with the sweetness of the bananas!  LOVE IT!!

This was perfect. Let me just say, I've read tons of recipes, but this one was simple & to the point. I made 2 loaves. They came out great w/ the recipe the way it was written. The same day, I made 2 more loaves with some changes - just things I wanted to put in my bread (cinnamon, 1/2'ed white sugar for brown sugar, nuts, raisins). Those came out wonderful as well. So, let me add - this is a GREAT BASE RECIPE! So for my picky eater son - he loved it. For my Foodie friends at work - they loved it too. Thank you and happy baking.

This is a great starting point recipe and I did expand on it a little further. Instead of margarine I did use butter. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white because I did want to try keeping the sugar down. I think even next time I might try just 1/2 cup of brown to see how it works. Instead of all purpose flour I used bread flour because that is what I had on hand. I also added a pinch of salt and tsp of cinnamon. I took it out and it was extremely crispy and was a little disappointed but it tasted good. I waited til the next day to try it again and the flavors had a chance to meld so it was really good! The crust part was soft and tasty and the inside was dense and moist. It did remind me of my granny's banana bread which I do like. I'm probably going to try some other recipes but this is such a good, easy, pure, basic recipe it's hard to beat.

I love this banana bread. It is so simple, yet flavourful. I substitute the white sugar for brown, and I add cinnamon to it. I also sprinkle the top with a little brown sugar to add a bit of sweet crunch on top. Everyone raves that this is their favourite recipe that I make. Adding chocolate chips is also a nice touch, my kids at work love it with the chocolate. 5 stars for sure!!

This recipe is hands-down the best!  I've tried numerous other recipes but keep coming back to this one.  The past time I made it was with 3 bananas that were way past their prime (even for banana bread standards).  It still came out delicious!  I like to add about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, like my mom does.  Yum!

meh, it's definitely 3 star. I have had much better banana bread in the past. Moist enough but flavorless, even after adding cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Made 6 large muffins and baked for 30 min. I'm still looking...

Exact same recipe my great-grandma used, except she only used 3/4 cup of sugar. Always wonderful, always forgiving-you can use anywhere from 2 to 5 bananas with success. Excellent

I used 4 bananas (very, very ripe), added 1.5 tbs of rum and used butter. The crust was amazing but I wasn't impressed w/ overall flavor. Maybe margarine would have yielded better results.

I'm very happy with this recipe. I have made a gluten-free version twice now and it has turned out delicious! I just use gluten-free all purpose flour instead. I don't use margarine so I used real butter  and added 2 tsp of vanilla to the banana mix. I also followed other suggestions and used 1/2 c of brown sugar with 1/2 c of white sugar. I also just use whatever ripe bananas I have on hand, usually 2 or 3, instead of measuring it out. I've found that 45 min is ample baking time - 1 hr would be too long. This is a simple recipe that's a keeper!

This gets 5 stars for taste and simplicity.  The only change I made is to add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract as per other reviewers.  Also did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Added 1/4 tsp salt.  Will definitely make this again and again, maybe adding chocolate chips to the batter next time.

I'm enjoying a piece right now!  So easy and delicious - one bowl!  I used 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white sugar.  Meant to add cinnamon but forgot and don't miss it!  I did add 3/4 c chocolate chips though!  Very moist and tasty ... we'll see how much is left when my husband gets home from work!

I was looking for a simple recipe, and only had two over ripe bananas. So, I made some revisions. Since I only had 1 cup of mashed bananas, I also added 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin in fear that it might turn out too dry otherwise. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon, and sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking. The bread tested done at 55 minutes. It came out very moist, very pretty, and rose up nicely. My small family of three ate it up within a day. Love it with the changes that I made...

This is my first time making banana bread & I'm loving it.
Although I made some changes, replace margarine with butter, add a splash of vanilla extract & using only half cup of sugar cause I already used 3 big ripe bananas.
The result is crunchy at top & moist inside.
Absolutely loving it.
Thank u for sharing the recipe.

Great bread recipe!  I've made the banana and also several variations with this recipe.  Comes out great everytime.  I've switched banana for pumpkin and a dash of pumpkin pie spice and I also tried it with chunky applesauce and a dash of cinnamon.  Both were excellent just like the banana bread!

Delicious!  We make this recipe whenever we have left over bananas.  Today I tried it in muffin form with a little brown sugar on top before baking.  I think I should have pulled them a little sooner, but they still turned out pretty darn tasty!!  I made 12 big muffins, cooked them at 350 for around 30 min.  This recipe is a winner.

AWESOME bread! I used organic butter instead of margerine though. Actually, I used ALL organic ingredients. Unrefined organic sugar and all it was the best banana bread ever. I also threw in a few Pecans and did a crumb top, it was evil in the words of my boyfriend lol.

I love, love, and love this recipe!  My boys thought it was very tasty and one of them even said "mom this is the best banana bread ever".  I did make a few changes as Krista V. suggested.  Added the cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and substitued the applesauce for margarine.  Yummo!  We finished the first loaf so fast that we had to buy some extra bananas so can make some more.

never had banana bread before, so I have no reference to how it is supposed to taste, but this was just AMAZING!!!! Only difference I made was that I turned it into muffins and hence reduced the baking time to about 25 minutes.

Tried this recipe last night and it was extremely easy and very good. The Banana Bread was moist and delicious.  You can't go wrong with this one.

Moist and flavorful, easily a keeper.  I ~almost~ had enough banana for the recipe but not quite.  Rather than run to the store for just 1 more banana, I peeled and mashed up a pear that was on its last legs.  I didn't really taste the pear in the final bread but the addition ensured a moist bread.

I just had two banana's to use and it flavored the bread perfectly! So moist and yummy I couldn't believe I actually made it. I did add a little vanilla to the mix as others have suggested.

I really liked this recipe.  I did read others comments and followed some of their suggestions and added my own. As per another review Instead of 1 cup of sugar I used 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp Vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon and 3 bananas.    I also used whole wheat flour instead of white and 1/4 cup of ground flax seed.  I only used 1 3/4 c of flour.  Next time I will try only 1 1/2 c of flour because of the flax seed.  It only took 50 min to bake at 325.  It tastes great, although not as moist as most banana breads.

I followed the recipe to a tee. The only modification I made was that I used four medium-sized bananas instead of measuring 1 1/2 cups. This recipe is easy and simply delicious. Have baked this bread three times already. Thanks Libby!

Quick and easy banana bread - only added 1/2 capful of vanilla and some cinnamon. Different variations of sugar depending upon what I had such as 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white or applesauce as a substitute for one of these. Had many compliments so far. Thank you!

I have tried countless banana bread recipes, and this is far and away my favorite. I make it at least twice a month. The only change I ever make is every now and then I make the sugar topping from the banana crumb muffin recipe on this site. Everyone loves this and I am constantly asked for the recipe.

This was a good basic recipe, but did need some changes. I followed some previous advice and used 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and a few shakes of the ground cinnamon. I don't think the bread would have been nearly as good without it. I used everything else as listed, I think a little less flour would've been ok too.

This recipe was so easy, I couldn't believe I was making banana bread, ME, and it turned out heavenly, so very delicious and moist.  I used brown sugar as someone suggested because I love the flavor.  I made it in a muffin tin w/cupcake liners so I could share.   I will make this all the time now.  Thank you!

My sister and I hate when bananas start to get all mushy and brown, so we put them in the freezer for use at a later time. I decided I wanted to make bread with the bananas we had been accumulating and thought this looked like a simple enough recipe. I used the suggestion many reviewers made and used 1/2 C brown sugar & 1/2 C white sugar. I also decided to use applesauce instead of butter and it turned out wonderful!

OMG! Wonderful! If the reviews wouldn't have been so great I would have never tried this, just looked too good to be true!! This is my new base recipe, I made the banana..added chocolate chips to a loaf, walnuts to another loaf, made a plain one. I also used this recipe for a pumpkin with walnut bread, just left out the banana and added a can of pumpkin and quite a bit of pumpkin pie spice...just yummy yummy yummy! Oh, and I used the small loaf pans and got 4 loafs per recipe.

Very good banana bread! I made the changes that most readers suggested by doing half white sugar, half light brown sugar, reduced flour to 1.5 cups, used applesauce instead of butter, added 2 handfuls of chocolate chips, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 TBS spiced rum.  I baked it for exactly an hour and had no problems with it burning.  I checked it at 30 and 45 minutes just to be sure in case I needed to lower the temperature or cover it.  I used 4 bananas, 2 overripe and 2 ripe.  It had plenty of banana flavor, as the ripe ones stayed pretty chunky when I mashed them.  It is very moist!  I regret adding chocolate chips.  I think it makes it too sweet. The next time, I will omit the chips and add a little bit of orange zest.  Four stars because I really ended up not making the orignal recipe but a variation suggested by reviewers.

This is the best banana bread I have made! I did half white sugar and half brown sugar, I used 4 bananas, added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla. I used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. I also sprayed my bread pan with Pam and then coated it in sugar. SO good!!!

I gave this 5 stars because of its ease and good taste.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I had no problem with baking time as others have stated.  It was beautifully done in exactly 1 hour.  Will defintely make again -- next I will try making it with pumpkin.

EXCELLENT!  I love recipes that don't have 100 ingredients yet still taste great.  This is one of them!  Only thing I did different (as suggested by many people) is to add teaspoons of various spices, like vanilla, cinnamon or nutmeg.  And I added some chopped pecans, too.  My loaf came out a little dense but I'd rather have that than falling apart.  RECOMMENDED!  :-)

This recipe is great and easy, but I did follow some other reviews and tweaked it a bit. I used 1/2c white and 1/2 c brown sugar, used  4 med bananas. Used 1/4 c veg oil and 3/4 c non sweetened applesauce. The boyfriend did not even know that it was somewhat healthy, he said it was best banana bread ever. Oh, also added walnuts, a must in banana bread.

this is a really easy recipe to follow. i've made it 3 times and the third time was definitely a charm. i learned to beat it with a fork or whisk, not an electric beater. i also found that cooking it at 350 for 30 minutes then turning heat down to 300 for 40 minutes helped it cook more evenly. i will definitely be making this a 4th time.

Moist and delicious! I will certainly make this bread again. Also, my picky son toddler son loved the flavor!  I made single serving muffins out of this recipe, and they cooked at 340 degrees for about 45 minutes. I sprinkled about 1/4 cup (total amount) chopped walnuts over the tops right before they were put in the oven. YUM! They toasted right up.   My only suggestion, don't be so afraid to over mix the batter that you under mix it. I found about 4 little surprise "baking soda" spots. My mistake though!   I used 1/2 cup of golden brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of all white sugar. I also added one tiny pinch of nutmeg and two shakes of cinnamon. I am going to try switching the butter for applesauce next time, just to see what the difference in taste might be!

I'd have to say this was delicious!  I took the advice of adding 1 tsp vanilla, 1 T cinnamon, 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar (replace the 1 C of white suger).  My banana bread eaters of the house gives this a 5!

Great with these healthier subs: 1/2c applesauce for the margarine. 1c oatmeal, 1/2c white flour, and 1/2c wheat flour for the flour. I added 1 tsp each of vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Next time I will try substituting all the white flour with whole wheat to make it even healthier! Also, I made mini muffins, cooked 13 mins, and full-size muffins, cooked 16 mins. They were super moist, but had a nice crunch around the tops! Excellent!

Tried this recipe with the following variations: 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown; 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce (Subst. for marg. or butter); 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon (I used Ceylon, but Cassia would work as well); 1 tsp vanilla extract; 1/4 tsp salt, and the biggie - Whole wheat flour (Gold Medal) as subst. for white flour. Baking time was same, about 1 hour. Due to wheat variation, all outer surface was little bit tougher, but inside was very nice, not too moist nor dry. Taste: Awesome! :)

I made this for a group of 150 teens participating in an inner-city summer missions trip and used 25 ripe bananas processed in a food processor 5 at a time. I added 1 t cinnamon per recipe.  I was using extra large commercial foodservice foil pans & commercial ovens so the baking time needed to be SHORTENED by 10 minutes which really surprised me. I filled the pans about 1 1/2 inches deep. I cut it into 3 strips longwise then slices of about 1 1/4 inches wide which yielded 49 slices per pan.  It was super moist and a huge hit with the teens and leaders.

For a quick, no-fuss banana bread recipe, this one is perfect! I used real butter, 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and a little cinnamon.  I baked one loaf and we ate it right out of the oven.  I wish I would have added a little more cinnamon but my die-hard banana bread lovin son said it was perfect.  I baked it for 1 hour exactly and for me, the time was right on.

I think this bread is the best I have ever made!!  I did alter it like most of the reviews.  I split the sugars 1/2 cup white and 1/2 brown.  I added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I noticed alot of reviews were complaining about bake time and doneness.  What I did was pour enough batter to make 6 muffins and  pour the rest in my loaf pan.  I baked the muffins at 350 for 18min. and the bread for 40min.  It was a perfect amount of time, moist but done.  I think if I would have poured all of the batter in the loaf pan It would have been hard to get the middle done with out burning  some of the top.  I highly recommend splitting up the batter.  My kids love to eat the muffins more anyways.  I have finally found the best banana bread recipe!

It came out perfect, nice and moist. I didnt give it 5 stars, because it didn't have as much of the banana taste as I would have liked. Next time I will use 2 cups of bananas. :)

This was an awesome recipe. I made one little change and added 1/4 cup cocoa powder and left out that amount of flour. I also used applesauce and baked as muffins. So yummy as Chocolate Banana muffins!

I used this Recipe as the Base of my new creation. Butterscotch Banana Bread Topped With Banana Glaze...
I used all the ingredients for this recipe. My addition was Tollhouse Butterscotch Morsels to the Batter. Also made it in a Bunt Cake Pan.
It is Awesome!!
LOVE IT!!

This was my first time making banana bread and it came out PERFECT!!!  Of course I altered some stuff so here is goes:  I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter (to cut out all the fat), 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 3 very ready to use bananas.  I kept the eggs,flour and baking soda the same as what the recipe called for and it was just enough for ONE loaf pan.  1hr on 350 and it was ready.  This is my new recipe for our family.  My husband and kids don't like the nuts in banana bread so this works great!!!!

I made this bread today hoping it would turn out being that it was my first attempt at making banana bread! (I'm a baking rookie) It is delicious, moist, and super easy to make! I gave this recipe 5 stars because I know i'll be using this recipe whenever my bananas get too ripe! Thanks!

I used 4 med bananas and added a small dash of cinnamon. The rest I stuck to the recipe, checking it after 1 hour. It was delicious, not dry and there wasn't any left! I would make this one again.

I thought this recipe definitely needed salt.  Seemed bland and maybe when adding sour cream and cinnamon (which I didn't do) it makes a difference.  

I made 18 muffins and baked them for about 22 minutes.  They were good, but missing something.....salt??

I love this recipe, and so did my family! It is a very simple recipe-everything is very atainable. It took about 4 bananas for me to get 2 cup, and I used both cups. I think this really helped make this bread come out moist.  To add flavour, I took the hint from the other reviews and added about a tsp. of vanilla, 1 tbs cinnamon, and some groung cloves and nutmeg.  Even then, the flavour was simple, but not bland. Hot from the oven, warmed in the microwave, or cold from the fridge, this bread taste wonderfull!

I am eating this as I type...hold on... last bite...YUMMY!  I had three crummy bananas and was looking for something good to do with them!  I added vanilla, pecans, golden raisins, and used real butter.  My husband now thinks I'm a baker!  Thanks previous reviewers, and thank you Libby for this easy and delicious recipe.

Great recipe. I substituted a pre-packaged container of applesauce for the margarine/butter. Used 1/2 cup each of brown & white sugar as suggested by others. And added 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Perfection!!

So easy and the recipe lends itself to variations, eg I reduced flour by 1/2 c. And replaced with 1/2 c. cocoa powder for chocolate version. Friends LOVED it, even the ones who don't like bananas! But all 3 times I've made this, I used butter (not margarine) and less sugar - 3/4 cup (brown and white sugar instead of just white). The most moist result was with 3 large bananas. Usually only bake 55-57 minutes at most.

I made it, as someone else said, used 1/2 brown/white sugar, added some cinnamon and nutmeg, walnuts, and vanilla. It turned out moist and delicious. I made 4 mini loaves, and baked 20+ minutes.

The first time I made this recipe, I did so because it was easily halved and I seldom have enough bananas for the whole portion. When I make a half recipe I use a smaller loaf pan that I inherited from my mother. Now I make it just because it's easy and so good. Next time I'm going to add some nuts to it, pecans or walnuts, whichever is in the pantry. Never throw away overripe bananas again.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of others by splitting sugar half white, half dark brown.   I also added a little salt. Co-workers loved it! !

Always looking for a recipe to use up browning bananas and this one is simple but makes a bread that is moist and favorable.  I did make changes suggested in other reviews (e.g. 1/2c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 t. vanilla) and I added a 1/4 t. ground mace and walnuts.  It only ended up taking about 45 minutes to bake.  I will definitely make it again.

Use oil instead of margarine and for the loaf to be VERY MOIST! Also add about 1/3 c. chocolate chips or nuts! I only had 3 bananas (1 c.) so I used 1/2 c. applesauce in place of the missing mashed banana.

I loved this recipe. Things I changed: substituted 1 cup of flour for 1 cup of almond meal; added 1/4 cup of rum and 1/4 of cup of chopped pecans. I did not measure the banana - used (2 3/4)big ones. My husband loved it and I could not believe how moist and flavorful it was. Thanks for sharing!

this is the first banana bread recipe I've tried and been happy with! I found it needed a bit more time than an hour - maybe 1hr 15. I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a cup of chopped dates, a teaspoon of whiskey and a tablespoon of brewed coffee. I also used canola oil instead of butter. Moist, flavourful and delicious!

Awesome - to make it healthier I used applesauce for butter and egg beaters for the egg.  First time i used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown and added walnuts.  It turned out great!  I'm going to try and lessen the sugar next time.  Great recipe!

We loved this bread - simple and yummy!  I used real butter and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  3 very ripe medium bananas.  I set the timer for one hour, but the top wasn't set and I ended up baking for another 10+ minutes.

This was a great base recipe...I used gluten free flour, 3/4 cup of organic palm sugar instead of the white sugar and added 1/2 cup of coconut and 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts. It turned out beautifully. Nice texture and not too sweet. Best gluten-free banana bread ever!!

This turned out really good. Based on the recommendations, I did 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar.  I was looking for a richer banana bread, but until I find that recipe, I will keep using this one. It's delish.

Based on the number of reviews and the overall score of this recipe, I was seriously stoked to try it! In the end, no one in my household was terribly excited about it. It was dry, and the flavor was bland. I've had better banana bread than this...

This was a great base recipe. I added vanilla, cinnamon, and pecans.  The result was delicious, though it didnt rise as much as I expected. Many recipes include both Baking Soda & Baking powder, so maybe thats why this wasnt as tall, but still really good flavor and texture.

This was my first time making banana bread, but due to this recipe, it turned out great.  However, it did take 1hr 25mins to cook.  That may be because I didn't measure the bananas, just used four medium to large ones so maybe that worked out to more than the 1.5C of bananas called for in the recipe, and also because I used a glass loaf pan.  But the extra cooking time didn't dry it out at all.  It was delicious.

I've tried other banana bread recipes that call for vegetable oil and using margarine or butter gives it a much better taste and not as greasy. I just made it again and modified the recipe like other reviewers. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 c. margarine, 1/2 c. applesauce, 1 c. brown sugar, 2 c. AP flour and 2 c. whole wheat flour, added tsp vanilla and had a little over 3 cups of mashed bananas. Followed the rest of the ingredients and procedure. When mixing the dry ingredients into the egg and banana mixture fold with spatula until flour is incorporated.  Don't over mix. The banana bread will be moist instead of rubbery and dense.

Really enjoyed this recipe it was just slighty dry for me.  3 bananas was 1 1/2 cups for me, but I think that if I had a 4th banana it would have been perfect.

Pure awesomeness!!!  I'm a terrible baker, but didn't want two ripe bananas to got to waste.  So, I halved the recipe, added a pinch of cinnamon, tsp of vanilla extract, & did 1/4 C sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I also don't have a loaf pan, so I put them in 12 ct muffin tin, baked at 350 for 20 min & voila, AWESOME banana bread muffins!!!

I doubled this recipe to make two loaves, which worked out quite well! Something I did differently, was I used half brown sugar, half white sugar!

I was a bit skeptical when I saw the few ingredients, but thought I would give it a try.  I was amazed how fantastic and moist this was.  I have made it every week since.

I never write a review, however, I do look at others to see what changes and suggestions they have made.  I have to say, I just made this bread because the recipe was simple and I had all the ingredients on hand.  It is the best banana bread I have ever had.  I did add a little vanilla extract & cinnamon and I think it gave it a little extra flavor.  Loved it!!

WOW!  I've always failed at banana bread.  And to  think how this very simple to make recipe with a few basic ingredients has made me banana bread royalty in my family!  No changes are needed at all.  It is absolutely perfect as is.  Just between us, I do sprinkle in a few chocolate chips once in awhile and my kids call it my special banana chip cake. They ask for it often.  Thank you for the great recipe Libby!

Mmmmmm.. soooo delicious!
I like this recipe since it is very simple (I don't have the ingredients of other similar recipes) and quick.
I think this recipe is one of the best ways to use the ripened bananas before throwing them out.
Thanks a lot!

I live in the caribbean and I was looking for a recipe to use for all the bananas in our backyard.  This worked out great.  I only made two small changes: 1. I added about 1/2 cup of milk and 2. I added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I gave to our neighbors and church members and they loved it.

Like most recipes on here I read reviews before making them.  For this one I used butter instead of margarine, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 large very ripe bananas, 2 eggs, 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp of Watkins vanilla nut extract and a generous pour of Captain Morgan.  I then sprinkled Sugar in the Raw on top before baking.  Bake time was about an hour and 15 minutes and this has been deamed best banana bread ever by my husband.  Thanks!

I've looked at the different banana bread recipes on this site. There are a few!!  I used this recipe after reading some reviews.  I normally would use buttermilk in my recipe as I think it makes it moist.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used sour cream instead. This is a good basic recipe & I may try making this with applesauce or pumpkin too.  My modifications were: added 1/2 c. sour cream, 3 bananas (next time I would use one more because I prefer more of a banana taste) split the sugar,  1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar.  I like nuts and "threw in a handful!"  This was good and the reason for 4 instead of 5, is ...I will add that 1 extra banana next time!

I made a few changes to this recipes when I whipped it up --- Two tablespoons of applesauce in the place of two tablespoons of butter, one and a half cups of Raisin Bran as opposed to one and a half cups of All Bran, and a dallop of raspberry jam instead of the raisins, as I was all out --- But unforch, the finished muffins weren't nearly as sweet or as flavoured packed as I had expected, which was a little disappointing. Whether or not this was due to my changes to the recipe, I'm not sure.

However, they're reasonably low calorie, yet hearty and chock full of loads of fibre and other healthy goodness, so I can't complain too much!

One tip, though: Be sure to spray your muffin cups with Pam or something similar before filling them up with batter --- Yes, even if you're using paper muffin cups! Otherwise, they're gonna stick like a, y'know, witch. I learnt this the hard way, haha!

I have made this recipe many times and it always bakes up well,I some-times add just a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon.this last time I sprinkled the prepared pans with a sugar cinnamon mixture before I filled them with the batter.It gives the loaves a little bit of a sweet coating.My grandchildren love it.

The first time I made this, I added a bunch of other stuff to it like everyone said, but I didn't quite like it, so I made it again just as it says & it was wonderful, I used a bunt pan (1 hour) & also made some muffins which took only half an hour. So delicious!

I have been making this recipe for years. Although I have tried others I always go back to this  one. Instead of creaming the butter and the sugar I melt a stick of butter and add it to the wet ingredients. I use 1 1/2 c. of flour instead of 2 c. I don't measure the bananas. I use four bananas. I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I usually add walnuts and when the grandchildren will be eating it I add chocolate chips. It is a dense bread but it is very moist and super easy to make. It is a very basic recipe that can be easily adapted to fit your taste buds.

The first pastry item I've ever baked that wasn't from a can or a mix, and it lives up to its name! I can honestly say I've never tasted a better bananana bread (sic; a Discworld reference, ICYDK). I actually took some advice from reviewers: subbed oats for 1/2 the flour and brown for 1/2 the sugar. Only took about 45 mins in my oven (I really need to calibrate that sucker one of these days...) I'm really looking forward to making some variations on this one! (The pumpkin one sounds great!)

Well I listened to the person who said subsititue applesause for butter... Its thick dense and chewy, terrible terrible consistency. Anyway i guess the flavor is good, I used 3 over ripe bananas, a tsp of cinnamon, a touch of honey, and some orange zest.

This was very good and easy.  I did add walnuts, a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla, and baked it in muffin tins so it would bake faster.  I think they were done in 8 minutes or so.  I liked that they were not cakey or overly sweet.

I don't get it...I followed the recipe exactly, and it really lacks flavor...needs another 1/2 cup of banana and DEFINITELY needs some SALT...I would also recommend a little cinnamon and vanilla...maybe some nutmeg.

Very, very easy! First banana bread I've ever made and it was such a success. I tossed in a pinch of nutmeg, and drizzled melted butter with brown sugar over the top when it was out of the oven. Wrap it up in plastic wrap and tie a wide ribbon around it, you've got a PERFECT hostess' gift!!

The reciple was quick and easy which I liked.  The bread was very good.  My only complaint is that I thought it was slightly bland.  I think it needed either a tad more sugar or maybe more bananas.  I will use this recipe again and experiment.

This is wonderful banana bread: light and fluffy. I made muffins and a 8' x 4" loaf from this recipe. I used half white and half brown sugar, and replaced half the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat flour. The results were simply superb. I'd add some salt next time, and spices which I forgot. Delicious all the same.

Only used about 1.5 cups flour. Did half white sugar, half brown. Added .5 tsp vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon. Also didn't have baking soda so I used 2.5 tsp baking powder with a tiny dash of salt (about 1/8 of a tsp). Cooked for about 52 minutes. (Did 45 at first, but it was still wet inside.) Next time I will definitely be adding chopped walnuts to this! It tastes great!

I do not get all the hub-bub. This recipe alone is tastless, and I used 4 very ripe bananas. I'll give where credit is due - it's easy.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever tried.  My kids loved it and it was gone the same day that I made it.  So moist and delicious.  I did have to bake it longer than 1 hour.  I baked it for about an hour and 20 minutes.

Awesome just right sweet and moist bread.  I only had a cup of mashed banana so i added pureed apple sauce to make it required portion.  It turned out so well.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone loves it.  I decided to try some of the substitutions others have suggested.  Today I substituted 4 oz of applesauce for the margarine, used half white sugar and half brown sugar instead of all white, and half oatmeal and half flour instead of all flour.  The bread was a little more dense, but still delicious!  Next time I plan to add a little dark rum...yum!

Great recipe! I do add some vanilla, pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon. I also use half cut white sugar and half brown instead of one cup of white sugar. I use 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of margarine.

I gave this 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for - ingredients I had in my kitchen; easy; quick.   And, a great banana bread! I loved how moist it was, and my brother and boyfriend loved it.   Maybe next time i'll add some vanilla, or a little more banana.

I think this recipe is amazing in its simplicity. I give it four stars only because I modified it so much to make it what we thought was fantastic. As another reviewer suggested, I used apple sauce instead of butter. I also added a dollop of reduced fat sour cream, but you could probably use plain yogurt as well. It REALLY added something special, a bit of tangyness, to the bread and I would highly recommend it! I used half whole wheat flour and half brown sugar. We also added a teaspoon of cinnamon,a generous bit of freshly ground nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. I wouldn't dream of making a bread like this without vanilla. We made two loaves, one of them with A LOT of chocolate chips, not measured but probably about a cup or more. So, soo good. We will definitely be making this again in the future.

Made this Banana bread last night, it is a very good simple recipe. Tastes very good, plenty of banana flavor. The only thing I did different was adding a teaspoon on vanilla, great simple recipe, easy to make.

This was such a convienent way to use up my old bananas that no one eats. This bread was so moist and tasty. It is a family favorite! I used brown sugar instead of white. I also added black walnuts which gave an amazing taste! So delicious! Thanks!!

Quick, easy, and delicious!!!  I did use a few of the reviews and made two changes. I added 1 cup oatmeal/1 cup flour and also added a tsp. vanilla.  I baked the bread for the full hour and it is in no way dry.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks!!!

I finally had bananas that were ripe enough to try this recipe.  It was super moist and yummy.  You definitely need to bake it the whole hour.  I followed advice of fellow recipe users and had great success.  (Replaced margarine with butter, used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown, added 1/2 t vanilla, cut the flour down to 1&1/2 cups)

Loved it!  I also did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I added a tsp or so of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.  It was just the right amount of sweetness to me.  Very mellow.  Yum.  It looked very pretty too.

Great recipe.  I used 3 medium bananas and added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to taste as suggested.  I did find that the bread needed to be cooked for an additional 15 minutes.  It was very moist and good.  Not at all cake-like as many recipes are.

This is a simple banana bread that get convoluted by unnecesarry ingredients. I use 4-5 bananas and add 1tsp. vanilla. the first time I made it I didn't have baking soda so I used 3tsp. of baking powder. The 2nd time I made it I used the required 1tsp of baking soda. I have to say, me and my husband both preferred the look and tasted of the loaf made with baking powder!

Really good! I added a pinch of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla extract to add to the flavor.

Simple and delicious. Used 1/2 sugar 1/2 brown sugar, and just a bit of cinnamon and vanilla. Maybe will try all white sugar next time just for comparison, but this looked wonderful and tastes delicious.

Great recipe!  As others suggested I added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon, and a dash of salt.  I split the sugar 1/2 each of white and brown.  The only other change I made due to limited ingredients was that I used 1/2 the suggested measurement of banana and subsituted apple sauce for the other half.  SUPER yummy!

This is very tasty and easy to make. I like that the ingredients are simple and are generally always in the pantry. However, I did as was suggested by others and cut down the flour and substituted a half cup of brown sugar. I also added a bit of cinnamon, a cup of chocolate chips, and a few chopped walnuts. I prefer the taste of my mom's recipe, but it requires ingredients that most people don't just have on hand.

Very good flavor.  I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white.  Used 4 bananas, 2 c flour, 1/2 c wheat germ and 1/2 c pecans,  Mine seemed a bit dry; will shorten the baking time by 5-10 minutes next time.  Good basic recipe.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and got 2 loaves and a dozen muffins.  I added a tsp of rum extract instead of vanilla - Mmmmmm.  Also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown and a little salt (as suggested in other reviews).

This was yummy and super easy!  Based on reviews I made several changes, but I think the most important thing I did was not to overmix!  My last banana bread was a disaster.  I read reviews warning not to overmix, so I mixed everything by hand. Here are my changes: 1) Instead of 1/2 c. margarine, I used 1/4 c. margarine and 1 snack pack Granny Smith Apple Sauce 2) For the sugar, I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white 3) Cut flour to 1 1/2 c.  4) I added a shake of salt, cinammon and nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  I couldn't find my bread pan so I made muffins.  Cooked for 35 minutes and they turned out perfect!  Delicious on a rainy day.  I saw a suggestion that instead of two cups flour someone used 1 c. flour and 1 c. oatmeal and I may try that next time.

Excellent base recipe!  Actually its an excellent recipe by itself!  I always have these ingredients on hand for leftover mushy brown bananas.  I've addded peanut butter, or oatmeal, or almonds, or chocolate chips, or whatever extra goodies I have laying around.  Sometimes I add in an extra egg to make it a little more cake-like.

Super easy, moist and yummy! I made it as-is with three bananas. It was exactly what I wanted! I also think this will make a great base recipe for variations. I'm looking forward to playing with it more. :-)

This was excellent. My husband and kids and everyone else loved it. I used applesauce and it was moist with less of the fat. It cooked in less time than said but it could've been my oven. I hate to reduce the heat too. It started to burn alittle. very good!

I've been using my grandmother's banana bread recipe, but with instructions like a "pinch of this" and "a bit of that" my bread never turned out the same.  I tried this recipe and have been making it almost weekly for months now!  Every time it turns out perfect.  I do throw in a tsp of vanilla, 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  Also, I was out of baking soda so I substituted 3 tsp of baking powder.  So far, every loaf I've made has been just as good if not better than the one before.

Turned out perfectly.  Only changes I made were a splash of vanilla extract, and a little bit of cinnamon sprinkled over the top before I put it in the oven.  Cooking time was right on...made a super moist loaf.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good basic recipe.  However, I made changes and got rave reviews.  I took some advice of others and used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar and also added cinnamon.  I also reduced flour to 1 1/2 C and added 1/2 C old fashioned oats and then sprinkled a few on top before baking.  I made mini muffins.  They were so good and didn't last long.  I will make these again and again.  It's my new banana bread recipe.

This recipe is good but it needs a few additions to make it the best. I added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of chopped walnuts, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamin, and a half of package of instant vanilla pudding(keeps it moist). This seems like alot but its really not and it turns a good recipes into the best.

The only thing wrong with this bread...it is never enough.  So moist on the inside, crispy on the outside and then the bannana flavor takes it to a new level of heaven.  I get excited when the local grocery has over-ripe bannans on sale.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Great Recipe!! i had about 3 bananas to get rid of and didnt want a high maintance recipe so i was glad to see this one.  Skimmed thru a couple reviews and here's what i ended up doing- 1/2 cup each of both white and brown sugar.  Used 1/2 of apple sauce in place of the butter and added about a tsp of both cinnamon and vanilla and a couple dashes of nutmeg.  I topped the bread with sliced almonds and then baked for an hour-DELICIOUS!! super easy and it has a great consistency..not to too dense! THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE :)

I'm giving this five stars, but with reservations.  When I checked it at 50 minutes, the outside was overdone and the inside was underdone.  I covered it with foil to finish it, and I think that saved it.  However, once I peeled off the burnt crust it was really delicious!  I'm going to try it again but tweak the baking time/temp.  I'm also going to try it on convection rather than convention. I used butter, a tsp of vanilla and four medium bananas.

I've tried many banana bread recipes, both new and classic, but this one was perfect. Simple and flavorful. I've made it twice this week alone! 
We don't do margerine, so I subbed butter. I also like adding ground flax to my baking, and 1/2 cup added to this recipe was perfect. 
I also put my bananas in the food processor and really  puree them until they're thin and light. Makes for even fluffier bread and muffins.
For muffins, I baked 30 minutes instead of the hour for the bread.

This came out pretty well.  :D It was extremely easy and quick to make (I was making it while I was cooking dinner with my roommate).  I didn't have enough bananas, so I used apple sauce to fill up the rest of it.  I think it would have been nice and moist except I used high gluten flour!

Good recipe though!

I always seem to have such a hard time with banana bread for some reason.  But this recipe saved the day!  Many recipes don't have enough banana flavor, and even though you are only using 1 1/2 cups of banana, the flavor is wonderful.  The recipe is so simple I wondered if it would even be any good.  It truly is, it's a keeper for me and my family. Thanks

Good but not fabulous. I made these into muffins for my eldest son's kindergarden class.

I'd use butter next time and up the banana. Then it'll be mighty tasty.

Did not appreciate this recipe. The bread was very very dry. The only variation from the recipe was that I added chocolate chips. Wouldnt make again.

I've always made banana bread in my bread machine until last week.  I used this recipe with a couple of changes, half white, half brown sugars, 1 tsp. vanilla, and ¼ tsp. salt.  This was delicious and moist.  This will be the recipe that I will always use.

I tried this out of curiosity since it sounded so "plain."  It was delicious!  I have another favorite that I like to add part brown sugar and white, pure vanilla extract, and a handful of chocolate chips and some chopped walnuts.  That is equally delicious.

I used 3 very ripe average size bananas to equal 1-1/2 cups mashed.

Simplicity at it's best. That is my description of this bread. My only addition was a tsp of vanilla and I used half white sugar and half Splenda. Moist and flavorful.

Simple and delicious. I ate this all week for breakfast! I used real butter instead of margarine and I'd highly recommend tenting the top with foil if the rest is done but the top is not. Also, don't bake too long, moist banana bread is a winner!

i've tried many banana bread recipes, and i think this is by far the dryest.  i made another batch with bananas and pine-apple, the flavor was better, but there's  something missing... and it was still dry.

This was delicious! I did the same alterations that most other reviewers did...1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar. I did 1 teaspoon of vanilla and quite a few shakes of cinnamon. I have those rubber baking pans (I don't like them very much) but I only had to bake at 350 for 40 minutes and it came out PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a super easy recipe to make and is delicious!  I made a couple of changes.  I added most of 100g package of chopped walnuts, added the vanilla and cinnamon (like others mentioned) and I added a healthy handful of chocolate chunks.  DELICIOUS!  I'll definetly be making it again.

Hands down THE BEST banana bread I have ever made OR tasted!  I made a few alterations based on other reviews.  I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 dark brown sugar.  Real unsalted butter instead of margarine.  Added a tsp of vanilla extract and a tsp of cinnamon.  In a skillet I melted some butter and toasted some pecans with a little brown sugar.  I let those cool and then added them to the top of the loaf before cooking.  AMAZING!!!  The banana taste is the main focus in this recipe and the bread comes out VERY moist!!  I am purposely going to neglect my bananas now just so I have an excuse to make this bread every week!

This recipe is terrific!  I used this recipe to make banana bread for the first time and I was amazed at how simple the recipe was.  It turned out PERFECT!  I used more bananas than called for, four, and the consistency of the bread was perfect and very moist.  I added a little vanilla but other than that kept everything the same.  The only thing missing was the nuts. This will be my banana bread recipe from now on!

My dad and I have tried various recipes fo banana bread, and this is the best one yet. I used real softened butter instead of margarine, and replaced about half the butter with PEANUT butter. It was delicious! I doubled the recipe and made two 9x5 inch loaves.

This bread was very simple, but I don't think it was the best. Something seemed to be missing...I used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar, a splash of vanilla. I made this for my MIL but I am embarrased to say its not the best I have ever made.

This is a good basic banana bread recipe.  I did of course my usual changes to the recipe...added cinnamon and vanilla to bread mixture. Topped with chopped pecans then sprinkled a sugar cinnamon mixture on top then baked.  Gave away most to friends and neighbors who are always happy to get home baked goods from my kitchen.

I would not call this "the best" banana bread but it is rather good.  I followed some of the other suggestions of adding more banana, adding cinnamon and doing half white half brown sugar and the loaf turned out looking nice.  It still lacked banana taste but I like bananas.  I would recommend if you like banana taste to add a 2 cups of banana.

Came out well.  I used 4 big bananas.  I baked at 325 degrees as suggested by one of the reviewers because I used a glass pan.  I also baked it on the lower rack.  In addition I added some dark chocolate pieces to the top.  It wasn't necessary, but I'm a chocolate fan.  I felt that there was not enough bananas.  I would add another banana.

This is a great simple recipe. I didn't have enough bananas so I added 1/2 cup of cinnamon apple sauce. It turned out great. My husband couldn't get enough of it!

This was super easy to make, and it came out moist and not too sweet at all.  ***I made this again yesterday and decided to make a few adjustments: 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar; 1/2 all-purpose & 1/2 whole wheat flour; I used 3 whole mashed bananas (not just 1-1/2 cups); I added 1 tsp vanilla extra AND 1 tsp hazelnut Kahlua (I just happened to have some lying around!).  It was WONDERFUL!!!  Even the next day - cold OR reheated 15 seconds in the microwave :o)

I only changed this recipe by splitting the sugar 1/2 white 1/2 brown and it came out really good but the big surprise was when we ate it the next morning and it was even better!!  This bread is moist and lets you enjoy the banana flavor without a lot of extras and it's simple to make without a lot of ingredients you might not have around!

When I tried making this the middle of the bread never got cooked and it turned out very salty. I tried it three times and probably won't try this again.

Pretty good, but not the best.  I have done a few other Banana Bread recipes on this site and my favorite so far is Cathy's Banana Bread.  This one is good, but still missing something.  I followed the recipe just as listed (except used Butter instead of Margarine) and felt it could use more flavor, maybe some vanilla and cinnamon next time.  But it was very moist.  Cooking time was 40 minutes, not 60.

The bread was much much better than the recipe I was using before.  I took the advice of other reviewers and made the following changes: brown & white sugar; 1/2tsp. vanilla; few shakes of salt; 1 3/4c. of flour; sprinkled chopped walnuts on top before baking.  I added my own touch by melting 1tsp of butter over the top of the bread after immediately removing it from the oven.  Then I sprinkled brown and white sugar  over the top for extra sweetness.  It was devine!

Excellent recipe!  The bread came out very moist.  I used 1/2 brown sugar, and 1/2 white sugar, added a bit of vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg for a little extra flavor.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is a classic. I like to add chocolate chips and/or nuts and bake it in little muffin tins. It's a wonderful alternative to the gigantic muffins I used to buy at the coffee stand.

This is the best Banana Bread recipe.  I do  think that really good flour makes a difference.  I used Organic, stone ground, unbleached all purpose flour.  I have found that cakes, breads, biscuits made with cheap flour have a tendency to stick to the roof of your mouth. 
I made two small loaves and cooked them for 60 minutes at 350 and they were perfect.  The only problem is my Husband is eating them faster than I can cook them.

Peace and happiness!

My husband told me last week that he didn't like banana breads. He gobbled it up last night! I followed some of the recommendations of using 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, but I think the next time I make this, I will reduce that amount--it over powers the rest of the flavors for me. I only had 2 bananas, next time I'll add another, I like a strong banana flavor. I did add one more ingredient on my own, rather than vanilla, I added 1 tsp of almond extract to give it a little nutty flavor without having to add the nuts. It tastes great! I didn't give this bread the full five stars though because I wasn't too thrilled with the texture, a little dry, and the top got burnt after 50 minutes of cooking. I wanted to take it out earlier when the top started darkening, but the middle was still gooey. This was my first time making banana bread, so I still want to experiment with other recipies.

With all of the great reviews I thought I would try this recipie...it came out very dry and the only thing I had changed is I used butter instead of margarin.  Perhaps an hour is too long to cook?  I agree that it needs a little something, but I gave it a shot as is...I don't think I'll try this one again.

Perfect! The bread came out beautifully! It was light and fluffy not heavy like other ones I've tried. I did however add a little banana flavoring, only because I really like a lot of banana flavor. Will use again & again!

I borrowed ideas from other reviewers and came up with these mods: I subbed coconut oil for margarine, I used 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. dark brown sugar, 1/4 c. coconut palm sugar. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt and about 1/4 -1/2 tsp fresh grated nutmeg to dry ingredients.  After adding bananas to egg mixture, I threw in 1 tsp pure vanilla and 2 tsp dark rum. 
I stirred 1/2 c. chopped walnuts into the flour mixture before adding to banana mixture. That way they did  not sink to the bottom of the batter. I baked in a 9x5 loaf pan and it was done in about 40 minutes at 350. I have a Monogram dual fuel oven and it cooks rather fast. I will give it more stars after I taste it - tomorrow! It is always better after sitting overnight. Thanks everyone, for the inspiration to try this.

UPDATE 7/29/2016 - One week later we are still eating this bread. Wrapped in foil and kept in the refrigerator, it is better and moister than it was when first made. It is delicious lightly toasted with butter, or eaten cold by itself.  I changed the review to 5 stars even though I changed it. I want this bread all the time now!

This is an EXCELLENT basic banana bread. You can add to it and make it even better. Here were my changes: I used butter instead of margarine, I used half white, half brown sugars, I only used 1.5c all purpose flour and added 1/2 c. rolled oats. I only had 2 ripe bananas so I also added nearly 1/2 c. sour cream. I also added a 1/2 tsp salt, cinnamon, and an additional 1 tsp of vanilla. Additionally, I added some nearly rotten chopped strawberries (probably a cup), and I made a white, brown sugar and cinnamon mix to line my pan with. I sprinkled the leftover on top of the bread. This gave it a great, slightly crusty edge. I know, it seems like a lot of changes, but I wanted to pizzazz it up. It was AMAZING!!!

Love this recipe and definitely will be making them again and again. Very easy procedures with the most simplest ingredients. One reviewer is right one hour is too long in the oven so reduced baking time by 5 mins with total of 45 mins. Had to substitute the chocolates on the video with raisins and yay came out really great

This was probably one if the easiest, and best banana bread recipe's that I have ever made, and I have made a lot over the year's! So I think I am just going to stick with this one, as my go to recipe, from now on! It doesn't seem to make sense to keep trying different ones, when you know this one is the best, too many out there anymore, and I'm happy with this one!

It tasted great but a bit dry - I prefer my banana bread moist.  I might try just reducing the cooktime next time I make it.

This was my first time to bake any type of bread. I would shy away from baking bread because I thought it was hard and messy. My family loved the banana bread I made using this recipe. It was easy, homemade, and made from scratch. I did it! Thank you for sharing your great recipe.

I gave it 5 stars as a very good basic recipe because it was moist and good, not too sweet and I had all the ingredients called for unlike some of the other recipes that call for brown sugar, buttermilk or sour cream. I did add pecans, 1tbs vanilla and a half of a little snack size cup of cinnamon applesauce. It was just what I had on hand. I used 4 very ripe bananas. Great recipe to use with few ingredients.

This turned out wonderful! I adjusted it a bit: Used 3/4 white sugar, 1/4 brown sugar; 1/2 teaspoon vanilla & 1/2 teaspoon almond extract; 1/4 cup pecans; 1/4 cup chocolate chips and a sprinkle of salt. I also did not want to add eggs or butter, so I used 1/2 can of pure pumpkin. I still baked it for an hour and it came out great. The outside is a little chewier, but the inside is perfect!

I tried numerous banana bread recipes and chose this one as my keeper.  It is easy, moist and unbelievably tasty.  One time when I was mashing bananas I went overboard and ended up with 2 cups rather than the 1 1/2 c in the recipe.  It gives it a greater banana taste, so I continued using 2 cups thereafter.  But either way this recipe is AWESOME.  I highly recommend it.

Great Recipe and very easy! I made it with applesauce (instead of butter) and it came out very moist. However, next time I would add some kind of nuts and maybe dried cranberries or blueberries. :)

I love this basic recipe, so many variations on the reviews! I didn't have any all purpose flour on hand (I know crazy..) so I decided to experiment with some of my leftover flours from my little gluten free stint. I mixed 1 cup of sweet rice flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I did 1/2 and 1/2 with brown sugar and white sugar. Added a little vanilla extract with 2 SUPER ripe bananas. DELICIOUS! I would actually recommend to anyone that has sweet rice flour on hand to try it this way once. It makes the banana bread extra moist but still firm enough to handle (it reminds me of a cinnamon bun but a banana gooey cinnamon bun!!). I know it sounds like a weird combo, but I am going to make all my banana bread this way now! Yay for discoveries! Thanks for the inspirational recipe!

This is a great recipe for a simple, honest banana bread.  All I add is 1tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of salt.  Moist, dense and delicious.

I changed it bit because of what I had on hand.  I doubled the batch, replaced the butter with 1 can of pumpkin and 1/2 cup sour cream I wanted to use up.  I also used one scant cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp salt.  I got rave reviews!

Super delish!  Made 2 loaves with a few adjustments I found in the review.  Both loaves I substituted 1 c white sugar for 1/2 c white, 1/2 c brown, the margarine for butter and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Firt loaf I cut flour to 1.5 cups and second loaf I used 1 c flour, 1 c oats and addded chopped nuts.  Both were excellent!

amazing starter recipies for a great banana bread. all i did was do half half brown and white sugar add cinnimon wallnuts and chocolate chips. the KEY is to cover it with foil for the last part of baking and then KEEP in the the foil once you take it out to keep it moist and soft. THIS BREAD WILL MAKE YOUR DAY!

This is an excellent and easy-to-make banana bread recipe. I tweaked it by adding 1 tsp of vanilla, and instead of bakingit as a loaf, baked it as cupcakes for 25-30 min, or until toothpick comes out clean. I like doing it this way because it's easier to take to work and snack on. The only drawback is that the papers come out greasy with all the butter used, but as they cool, the butter is absorbed.

I used applesauce instead of 1/2 cup margarine per people's reviews, did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1/4 teaspoon salt and some cinnamon, to taste.  I also added 1 tablespoon dark rum and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Not sure if Malibu rum is considered "dark" rum, but the bread came out okay.  Not the best, but fairly decent.  I don't think it was so good that I'd be making it again, unless I was trying to get rid of some old bananas.

Banana bread always seemed like such an exotic hard to make thing. I was always amazed when my Papaw would make it, but I made this exactly as the recipe dictates (which is rare for me) and it turned out pretty good, and it was totally easy. I really like bananas, but there is such a tiny window in which they are good. I'm glad to have this recipe in my repetoire so I can buy loads of bananas with no remorse.

Just this evening I'm trying to make it with peanutbutter and banana w/ a dash of honey... in a muffin tin. We'll see how it goes. I figure I like those flavors on a sandwich so why not blend it all together.

My husband said this was very good bread (couldn't have any myself because of a banana allergy).  I took others' recommendations and used half brown and half white sugar and added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon.  I like that there's so few ingredients in this recipe though it still turns out well!

Love this bread! When I first made this recipe I was short on bananas, so I used vanilla yogurt to fill that portion.  It came out so great that I always use the yogurt.  I also like to add vanilla and some spices just for personal taste.  Doesn't last very long in my house!

Great, simple recipie. I add splash of vanilla too but that's just a personal preference. I've made this several times for my family and my son, who is very picky, loves it and asks for more.

SO easy! I was skeptical due to the short list of ingredients, but I'm so glad I gave it a shot! The only thing I should mention is that I felt like I had enough batter for two loaves, and so I separated the batter into two pans, and it was the right decision to make. Delicious!

Made these a second time, several years later, and added a little bit of applesauce (didn't have enough bananas) and a little bit of peanut butter (for flavor and protein). I also used less than half a cup of sugar, they were still plenty sweet. They came out WONDERFULLY.

One of the better banana breads I've made so far.  I added sliced almonds on top as someone suggested.

My first attempt came out really great.  I only used 3/4 cup of white sugar (didn't have any brown), 3 large ripe bananas, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, a dash of cinnamon and the rest of the ingredients listed above.  I cooked it at 325 F (only because I have a convection oven) for 45 minutes and it came out with a crusty shell and moist center.

This is some pretty good bread.  The only thing I did differently was 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I added 3 1/2 bananas bc that is what I had on hand.  I'm not sure what that comes out to cup-wise but the bread is just about gone and there have only been two people eating it for less than 24 hours....ha!

Excellent banana bread! I made mini muffins which took about 12 minutes and regular muffins which took 25 minutes.  for a moister bread, I only used 1&1/2 cups of flour instead of 2. I also used 1/4 tsp salt and butter instead of margarine. Also, I recommend combining a 1/2 cup brown sugar and a 1/2 cup white sugar to cream with the butter instead of just white sugar. To finalize these, I mixed in chocolate chips and I sprinkled a little cinnamon on each muffin before baking. They are amazing! Next time, I will try adding peanut butter to these as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made several different breads using this website, but this was by far the easiest!  It was quick and easy and I totally recommend this to anyone who's still a newbie to cooking like I am.  Did I mention it's delicious?  Cuz it's pretty fantastic!  Great recipe!

Very good and flexible! Subs I made include splitting the sugar with brown and white and using a multigrain cereal as part of the flour.  I also used applesauce instead of the oil/ butter.

I'll give this 2.5 stars. I thought there was wayyy too much flour in this, even though I reduced as others suggested.
Maybe go down to 1 1/4C and add more bananas... Problem with the way this recipe is written, 'cause it's so hard to tell how much banana you'll need to= 1.5 C.
Better to write it as "2 lg bananas, mashed" etc.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I made a small modification: I used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the margarine. Leaving everything else the way it was, this is a great recipe. I cut it into 10 thick slices that we can put a little butter or jam on for breakfast or just leave plain for a lunch box snack.

I only gave it 4 stars because I did make some tweaks as previous posters suggested: half dark brown sugar, half white; added tsp vanilla and dash of cinnamon; pinch of salt used just 1and 3/4 cups flour and used butter instead of the margarine. The house smells wonderful and the crust is just like when my mom used to make it. I will definitely make thus again!

I made a few mods. Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. Added vanilla extract to the batter, as well as chocolate chips (I just eyeballed the amount). I also used butter instead of margarine, only bc that's all I had in the fridge at the time. I only had two bananas but I added about  1/4 to 1/2 cup of applesauce as well. 

Very easy and came out great!

This is a great basic recipe that you can easily dress up.  I used 3 bananas and 1/2 C sour cream, 1/2 tsp of each: Allspice, Cardomon, Nutmeg.  The extra spices gave it an earthy warm flavor. I baked it for 1 hour and then for an extra 10 mins. with foil over the top so the inside cooked well.

Yummy. I sprinkled a little instant banana cream pudding over the bananas before I added them to the mix. It adds flavor and extra moisture. 50 minutes at 350 was perfect for this bread

Great Bread.  I sub white flour for some Whole Wheat flour.  I noticed that it had to be cooked a little longer, but trying to figure that out without burning the rest of the loaf while the center needed to cook longer.  Not sure if that was a result from using the whole wheat.  I also used 3 bananas and cut the sugar in half.  I also used egg beaters instead.  I added a handful of chopped walnuts.  Came out great!

Yummy! I have been looking for a good Banana bread recipe. I did add a little cinnamon and Cardamum and I used real butter instead of margarine. I turned out really yummy. One time I added chocolate chips. Another time I added Blueberries! Very versatile recipe!

The recipe came out wonderful but I gave it four stars because I tweaked it a little and added my own touches.  I used real butter instead or margarine and substituted brown sugar.  I also added some vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dash of salt.  I guess I pretty much made up my own recipe but this was basis, so I have to give credit where it's due.  Also, if you don't have the patience to wait an hour for fresh baked banana bread; make little muffins.  I baked mine for about 9 1/2 minutes and they were yummy!

A great basic quick bread recipe!    This recipe is very forgiving and versatile.  The recipe as shown works great, but it also works well with substitutions in place of the bananas.  Apple Sauce or any other type of fruit or pie filling works great.  My favorite is to use part fruit and part yogurt for the 1 1/2 cup serving of fruit.  I have substituted different types of flour and sweetener and they all work great.

Very easy, but I agree not as sweet as I usually expect banana bread to be.  But it's good!

This is a tasty recipe as is.  The second time I made it I used applesauce instead of butter and splenda instead of sugar and it still turned out GREAT.

great basic recipe! i changed it a little...used real butter instead of margarine; added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of salt; 1 teaspoon of vanilla; added 1/2 cup brown sugar to the cup of sugar already in recipe; decreased flour a bit...maybe by 1/2 cup...don't care for "tight" bread; added some walnuts...baked for about 30 minutes, give or take...voila! makes great muffins..kids (and adults) can just grab them and go...that's what my son did, right out of the oven...delish! :)

I am at a loss - I bake often and do not usually have a problem, AND I love all recipes and the review system - but I did what some people suggested and did half oil and half applesauce - and my banana bread did NOT come out well.  It was somewhat rubbery and I did not even serve it to my family.

I made this EXACTLY per the recipe (for all you purists out there) and just didn't care for this.  It had VERY little flavor (even though my 4 smallish-medium-sized bananas were VERY ripe!) -- think it could've used a teaspoon (or more?) of vanilla extract or even some dark rum, as another reviewer suggested.  Also, after only 40minutes, my loaf got extremely brown on top & all over the outside (maybe that was my metal non-stick loaf pan?). I doubt I'd try this again -- think I'll look for another banana bread recipe.

I used 4 medium sized bananas (roughly equivalent to 2 cups), and found that it wasn't as "banana"y as most banana breads I have had before, next time I think I'll try a recipe that calls for more banana.  I also made the mistake of following "MomSavedByGrace"s review on the recipe page and let it cook for 45 minutes so that it would not dry out too much per other people's reviews.  Although two toothpicks stuck in the center came out clean, after I let it cool I noticed that the entire middle of the bread had not cooked.  In the end I had to throw it out after only being able to salvage an end piece.  It did smell wonderful cooking though.

Yummy!!  I made this last night and did make some changes.  Instead of the butter I put in a 1/2 cup of applesauce with cinnamon already in it.  I split the sugar 1/2c brown; 1/2c white and the flour 1c white and 1c whole wheat and added some vanilla.  I will definitely make this again!  :)

Made my bread today and it smelled great. The only problem was that it tasted like it had too much flour or pastey. Definitely something us with the ingredients.

This bread is very good! I also added white chocolate chips, but I'll probably use milk chocolate next time. I also added some vanilla extract and cinnamon. My only problem was that the bread is a little dry.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!  After whipping up one batch, I realized that it wasn't going to be enough to spread in my 9 x 13 pan, so I hooked up another.  Used half to fill up rest of 9 x 13 and the rest in a regular loaf pan.  Haven't eaten, but as far as ease of ingredients and de-panning, this is a snap.  Puffed up nicely without burning too, but that's highly up to your oven.  Can not wait to dig into this luscious bread!

Great, easy recipe.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and some cinnamon.  As other readers have noted, I never measure the mashed bananas -- I just used four good-sized bananas, and the flavor was perfect. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Very good.  I had a little over 2 cups of smashed bananas, so I added it all.  Also, I substituted 1/2 of the butter with sugar free applesauce.  Last change was using 1/2 whole wheat flour and a dash of vanilla.  This makes it a bit healthier, but very good.  I baked it 65 minutes, but found some uncooked spots.

Pretty good.  Used applesauce instead of butter.  Brown sugar instead of white sugar.  6 bananas, 2 cups of WWF and 2 cups of oatmeal, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 2 tsp vanilla.  I still think it needs more bananas.

I added some vanilla and pecans and made mini muffins instead of the loaf.  They turned out wonderfully (obviously cut cooking time by a great amount). The butter creates great browning over the typical vegetable/canola oil that is usually used in quick breads.

Easy recipe and my husband loves it. I've never liked banana bread - I don't like baked bananas - but I'll take his word and the fact that it doesn't last too long around here. Good excuse for getting rid of bananas that have gone a little too ripe.

Very nice!  I went with half a cup of white sugar and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and a dash of cinnamon.  It turned out very well and keeps in the fridge for a long time without drying out.  Every once in a while I would just cut a slice and heat it up in the microwave for breakfast or a mid-day snack!  My husband and my 7 year old daughter both loved it as well!

this recipe is a winner! Good and classic! Since we are trying to eat healthfully, (love that word) I used half cup brown, half cup white sugar instead. Also,1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup multigrain blend flour! Then I added 1 cup of walnut pieces. It turned out beautifully! Great texture and full of flavor! Your recipe is so user friendly. Bets my old one. Thanks

I guess I didn't really use this review, though I used it for the basics. I used what I had on hand -- three smashed bananas, butter instead of margarine, half white sugar half brown sugar, two brown eggs, and my flour was half bread flour half wheat flour, and I added some cinnamon and vanilla.  But whatever the case, delicious!

YUM!!  This recipe turned out great!  I used a bit less sugar and and added some lemon juice and salt to it and not only did it taste amazing, but it was super moist and the house smelled wonderful for hours.

Delish! Turned out exactly as I had hoped. Great flavor and texture. I baked mine near the bottom of the oven and put some foil over the top when bread was sufficiently browned. I will be making this again very soon, and look forward to trying it with pumpkin/chocolate chips. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I also made minor changes - 1tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp cinnamon, I used 2 cups of bananas and I made sure my butter was slightly softened - it makes it easier to cream together and to distribute that buttery flavor. I also blended the dry ingredients first and slowly blended it into the wet mixture of the sugar, butter, eggs, banana and vanilla. I also added 1 1/2-2 cups of raisins (I love raisins!). I also have a glass loaf pan so I lowered the heat to 325 baked for about 45. This is the best banana bread ever!!

This was pretty good, a little on the heavy side though. I did make a few changes as recommended, added more cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg and one tap of vanilla extract. OH! and this recipe works pretty good for the bigger sized muffin too, just bake it 20-25 minutes instead of an hour. I sprinkled sugar on top for extra flavor.

Fantastic. I've tried more banana bread recipes than I can recall. I'll probably stick with this one with the modifications I picked up from other reviewers. I substituted 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce for the butter, I added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and 1 tbsp of good dark rum. I also did 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar. This turned out excellent. It took about 1 1/2 hours to bake up but banana bread always takes extra time in my oven. Anyway, this is a delicious recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is "fool proof".  I was teaching my five year old granddaughter how to bake and the phone rang.  I came back and we put the bread in the oven.  Ten minutes later, I realized we had left out the margarine.  I quickly melted it and took the bread out of the oven, stirred  in the margarine, and continued to bake.  The bread was still delicious. (I don't reccomend this technique, however).  When the loaf came out of the oven the center was still a bit moist so I microwaved the entire loaf for about 60 seconds, something I have done successfully before with dense breads. I feel this is better than browning the edges to death. I did use half white and half brown sugar,and added vanilla, salt and 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup oatmeat. I also sprinkled the bread with chopped walnuts and oatmeal.  Thanks Lilbby, this is a great starting point recipe.

Turned out great - not too heavy or soggy. I added some walnuts and a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Even stayed moist for a few days. Will use this recipe again.

I am not a big fan of banana's let alone banana bread. However, when this came out of the oven it smelled so good I just had to taste it. I spread some butter on a slice and it was delicious! I had 2 more slices that night :o) The only change I made was that I added about a cup of chopped pecans.

This was the recipe I used for my first time making Banana Bread, and it turned out great!! I ended up using 3 over-ripe bananas, a little more than the required 1 1/2 cups, and I decided to substitute butter for margarine. I also sprinkled a brown sugar/white sugar mix on the greased pan before pouring in the batter. When the banana bread was done baking, I brushed melted butter on top of the loaf and sprinkled some more of the sugar mixture on top. It gave it that extra bit of sweet! This recipe was very quick, and will definately be used again! Thank you :-)

Followed Directions pretty much to the letter only changes I made were is 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and when i poured it in the loaf pan i poured half the batter spread cinnamon applesauce over it then poured the rest of the batter. It came out wonderfully moist and very flavorful. even toasts in the toaster very nicely. my family loved this.

I made this banana bread with just a few changes. First, I detest margarine in anything because it's fake food so I used butter instead. Next, I had four brown bananas that were quickly going downhill, so I used all four. Then, as recommended by another reviewer I used two tablespoons of dark rum. I also reduced the white sugar to 1/2 a cup and add 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Next, 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of cinnamon. OMG! This was just out of this world! I made one for a friend of mine who brought it to her workplace. She called me while she was eating it and told me it was the best she had ever tasted...and her co-workers with whom she shared the bread were raving about it. Thank you!  The four bananas made the bread moister and the rum sent it over the moon. Wow!

Yummy - I love this....so moist.  I used 3 large bananas and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Wow!  I did only cook it for 45 mins.  I live in the mountain so that may have made a difference.  Yummy.  Will make again.

eh not the best at all. i added walnuts (can't imagine a banana bread without nuts!), cinnamon & cloves (really? no spices in this recipe???), and used 2 ripe bananas (didnt measure exactly but it looked like 1.5 cups..).... didnt think it was sweet enough. i like my quickbreads to be more like pastries not like health breads.

Is good. I was making this for my mom and she told me to add more bananas, and I was like 'whaa?' but it came out really moist and gooey! Now whenever I make banana bread I use this recipe and add more bananas. Oh and more sugar is good too! ^.^ I adds 1/4 cup more sugar and bout 4 bananas per batch. Try!

This was a very simple, very moist bread.  Only change I made was to add in nuts, about a cup.  Cooking time was off a bit, about 10 min, and remember that if you are using a clear glass bread pan, to cut your temperature down to 325 so that the edges don't burn

Great recipe!  I used butter instead of margarine and followed others' recommendations of 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar.  I also added a couple dashes vanilla, a sprinkle of cinnamon and some walnuts.  Very good!  Next time I'll be trying the oatmeal/flour and applesauce-instead-of-butter suggestions.  Thanks for sharing!

I took other reviewer's advice and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also used 1 cup flour and 1 cup oats.  Used 3 ripe bananas, 1/2 tsp vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  It turned out great.  I love the texture with the oats.  Definitely a keeper.

This was very easy and fast to mix up. Rich banana flavor, moist and not overly sweet. I added 1/2 tsp salt for taste.

I have to say, this is the best and easiest banana bread recipe I have ever made. I love that there is no oil in it. It's moist, light and terrific. I added some chopped pecans to mine and cooked it in a silicone loaf pan. It took about an hour and 15 min at the given temp of 350. I think 375 degrees would be better. Other than that, this recipe rocks. Very few ingredients needed and a beautiful result. This is definately a favorite. Thanks for sharing it.

This is my "go-to" banana bread recipe. It never fails, is easy to make, and tastes great! I've made it exactly as written, as well as substituting vegatable oil for shortening, adding spices, reducung the sugar by a 3rd, and using partly whole wheat flour. It always works.

This is a nice bread. The crust came out a little too crispy for me, but I might of baked it too long. Still has a nice banana flavor and it very moist.

I took the rum suggestion another step further...  I soaked 1/2 cup raisins in Knob Creek Bourbon for 48 hours and added them and the liquid....it turned out supremely moist with a deliciously enhanced flavor!  We really enjoyed it and will do that exact thing again!!  :)

This recipe is wonderful and so easy! I had 3 ripe bananas that I needed to use, and this was the perfect answer. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I used real butter instead of margarine, and added a tsp. of cinnamon and a tsp. of vanilla. I baked for exactly 1 hour and it came out perfect. This is definitely a keeper!

A simple recipe to follow. I made some alterations for a creamier bread. I subsituted 1/2 of the butter it called for with cream cheese and added 1 jar of cinnamon applesauce for additional flavor. I compensated for the extra sauciness by adding extra flour for thickening purposes. Both loaves were gone within 2 hours! Will definitely make this one again.

I wanted an easy all around recipe I could use regularly and change up as we had fresh item in season. I also wanted to be able to use whole wheat flour mix and apple sauce. I saw that others had done all of this and rated it high - I did not get the same results. I used 1/2 ww flour, 1/2 brown sugar and apple sauce instead of margarine, What we got was a bland, tough loaf. Moist on inside, but very tough and chewy on the whole outside and even though I used a full cup of sugar and 3 very ripe bananas and apple sauce, still not very tasty. This in not my new go to banana bread.

Great recipe.  I cut the sugar in half, mashed two bananas and added a cup of sweet potato puree.  Delicious.  Next time I'll use applesauce instead of sugar altogether, along with the banana and the sweet potato.

My kids enjoyed making this and we all enjoyed eating it! I used 4 bananas - didn't measure their volume. I also added a bit of vanilla and sprinkled the tops with sugar before baking (I definitely recommend this). I made it into muffins & they cooked in about 23 minutes (it made about 18 muffins).

Tastes wonderful, but turns out somewhat dry.  I have issues with it getting overcooked on the edges and undercooked in the middle.  I tried adding cinnamon and nutmeg (as suggested by a few reviewers) - which was interesting, but not my favorite.

I've made this recipe many, many times. It's absolutely delicious as stated. However, don't even bother making it (or any other banana bread) if your bananas aren't super ripe. It makes the bread extremely bland. I know, because I rushed things at Christmas and ended up with a dozen bland little mini-loaves. (By the way, this recipe makes 4 mini loaves.) Also, the margarine is a good idea, as it keeps the bread more moist than butter would, so don't substitute. I've tried making this bread with 1/2 brown sugar, but found that the difference in flavor (as long as the bananas are ripe) did not warrant the additional measuring. This recipe is so good, and so easy, that I have memorized it from making it so many times. =) It makes me feel like a grandma with a special heirloom recipe that no one would believe is actually really easy!

I tried the recipe with applesauce instead of butter, and added rum... It's very bland! Maybe next time I need even darker bananas, vanilla, cinnamon, real butter and less flour. Sorry, but it didn't do it for me!

I also added vanilla, raisins and cinnamon. Tip: don't let the pan over flow of you will have a mess in the oven, and lots of smoke ;)

I made some recommended changes and they became more then a 5 star! I used 1/2c. sugar, 1/2c. brown sugar, no butter but a 1/2c. of Musslemans(the best!) chunky applesauce. Also made them into muffins. They are very moist and light, tasty too. They are being scoffed up faster than the sliced bread! Thanks for the changes Treskele.

It's very tasty and easy to make, but I wish I would have taken a previous reviewer's advice to split the batter into two smaller pans. I just couldn't get the middle done before the edges started to dry out.

I also used 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1.5 c. Flour, vanilla, cinnamon and salt and used 1.5 c. bananas. It came out beautifully and tasted great! Mine did take 1 hour to bake at 350 in my oven; and was still moist. My bread pan was a tad smaller than what was called for though. I am happy with this recipe and will make a again. I'm getting a second piece... :)

I followed the recipe exactly and was wishing the end product was more moist. The addition of more banana might help.

I just made this banana bread and it turned out perfect. I checked the bread after 1 hour and I baked it for 10 more min, and it turned out moist and delicious. I had so many compliments on it, and my whole family really enjoyed it. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO PUT BUTTER ON IT! That is amazing! I will be using this recipe again. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked how easy this recipe was.  Also with ingredients I always have on hand.  I don't, however, have loaf pans, except my 1 small one I use for meat loaf, so I converted this to a banana muffin recipe and found it takes just under 30 minutes to bake that way.  I added a little cinnamin, nutmeg and a tblspoon of triple sec.  Yum!

I too used 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla. Took little over 1 hr for mine. It seems to beg for a 1/2 tsp or so of salt. Would add next time.

When I first looked at this recipe I thought it looked way to simple and that it couldn't be that great.  I needed a recipe for work that I could make quickly and it had great ratings so I tried it.  Normally I like spicy food and would have added some cinnamon and cloves but decided not to for a change.  Wow, I was really supprised at the flavor!  Really nice banana taste with a great texture.  Thanks, I'll use this recipe again as is.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and made 4 mini-loaves which baked for around 30 minutes. I was still shy of enough banana, so I added half a cup of crushed pineapple and threw in half a cup of coconut because it just seemed to go with the tropical theme I was getting into. This recipe is a great starting point and can easily be adapted.

I baked this for the hour and that was too long.  Probably would have got it out earlier but there were a few distractions at our house that day! Even at an hour, the kids absolutely loved it and it was still good. Followed recipe exactly, very tasty, but may try subbing some things next time for a healthier version.

simple and wonderful flavor, so easy. I let my mixer mash the bananas when I added them. Also used pumpkin instead of banana and turned out great. I make mini loaves for cuteness and baking time, plus they are always more moist.

Very good basic banana bread. It usually takes longer than an hour for it to bake completely, as this produces large loaves.

This was delicious, but I added more bananas, used half brown sugar and added allspice & cinnamon.  It was moist, tasty & 
yummy.  I had 6 small bananas in the freezer and used them all.

This is my first time EVER making banana bread or any type of bread for that matter, so with that in mind it came out really well and was super easy. It was a little dry and I feel like the recipe was missing something to make it a little more moist. Maybe if you eat it with butter, jam or cream cheese it will taste more interesting. But overall it was simple and not too sweet - perfect for breakfast, daytime snack, or potluck.

This is a great recipe for over ripe bananas.  I've been using this recipe for over a year and it always gets compliments.  I add about 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter but it isn't necessary.

I accidentily melted the butter when softening it. Sift the flour with the baking soda or else it clumps as it cooks.

Excellent recipe.I've been making banana bread for years now and it's since i no longer hv all my fave recipes with me, finding one that has great texture, the right sweetness, and simplicity, is a wonderful thing. I made 50% more, split the batter into one loaf pan and one muffin pan. I baked the muffins for 25mins, topped with a pecan each. That way i can give them to my neighbor, without having to make slices from the loaf.

Loved it!  Used six very ripe bananas, and added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  Extremely moist with a nice, fresh flavor.

This is so nice and easy and tastes great. I added a bit of vanilla per other reviews and I used whole wheat flour. I also baked 4 mini loaves instead of 1 big one to cut down on cooking time. This was great!

I have tried several different banana bread recipes on this site, and this is by far my favorite.  I do add a teaspoon of vanilly and a 1/2 t. of cinnamon.  I also on occation at chopped walnuts or pecans.  This is a very good base recipe, perfectly moist every time!  Thank you for submitting this!

Very good recipe for banana bread. Like some other reviewers, I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Lowered the cooking time to about 50 minutes, and it turned out great. Thanks!

Good basic recipe with a few modifications. As suggested by others: use 1/2 cup sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, add 1 TBS cinnamon, chopped walnuts. Reduce oven temperature to 325 and bake for 60-70 mins (watch carefully and tent with foil if top browns to quickly).

I did modify this recipe to make it more healthy for my daycare, but not enough to completely change the recipe.  I used whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup honey instead of the sugar, 1/4 apple sauce + 1/4 cup canola oil instead of the margarine.  The kids LOVED it and it turned out really nice.  The parents tried it, what was left (not much!!) and they couldn't tell that it was low fat/lower sugar  at all!  This recipe uses less banana's than my usual recipe but it's almost as good.  A keeper!

This was my first time making banana bread, I found this to be a very easy recipe.  It came out very moist.  I did as others suggested and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  Also I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tbsp of cinnamon.  I threw in about a cup of walnuts, Very tasty, next time I think I'll add chocolate chips!

Perfect! I followed the suggestions of the other reviews and did half white and half brown sugars along with a little less cinnamon and this turned out so good! My house smelled so wonderful as it baked! Just perfect!

This bread rocks!  EVERYONE loves it.  It is so tasty when it's warm with real butter on it. I've made it several times.  In fact, when I go to the grocery store, I look for "ripe" bananas on the sale rack so I can make it again...like tomorrow for example

I have made this bread twice now and it is awesome. My husband and daughter gobbles it up before I even get it cut. The second time I split my batter into 3 small loves. I did nuts in one loaf, dark chocolate chips in the other loaf and raisins in the third loaf. Baked all for about 45 mins. YUM YUM!

This was fantastic! I did add a few things: I doubled the bananas (I had a ton that were just on the border of bad), also added a cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Also did half brown, half white sugar as others suggested and used real butter. I was able to make 2 loafs our of the batter and they were gone in a day and a half! Will be making this weekly (great for breakfast w tea!!!)

I am very satisfied with this recipe. I was looking for something to do with my over ripening bananas with very little other ingredients and this was perfect. The kids loved it too. My husband said there is no need for us to go to our favorite restaurant for banana bread anymore. Thanks!

Not the best, but pretty good with a few changes that were suggested by other reviewers. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tbs cinnamon, used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown. I didn't measure my banana, but I used 4. It baked for about 55 minutes, and I had to cover it after about 35 mins because it was browning too quickly, probably my oven though. I think this would probably be very bland as written. Also, definitely better after being refrigerated overnight, it wasn't very good still warm from the oven for some reason. Quick and easy to mix up, and good enough to eat.

This is a very nice basic banana bread.  I certainly wouldn't call it the "best," but it is the easiest.  Based on suggestions from other reviewers, I used half white and half brown sugar.  I also used about 2 cups of bananas instead of 1 1/2 and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Although it's not quite as flavorful as I like, it is very nice.  If you're looking for something really simple that tastes good, you probably can't do much better than this recipe.

Tried this b/c of all the great reviews. Made it for my niece and nephew (spending the night) who loves banana bread.  Were we disappointed!  My husband and my nephew wouldn't even try it.  My niece braved it and shared a piece with me, then said "let's just save it for breakfast, o.k.?" This from a 6 yr old.  This was moist but did not "appear/feel" cooked through.  Very little flavor even though I used real butter, 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar, some cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg and salt. I did not like the texture.  Felt I wasted my ingredients, time, and let down my niece and nephew who waited so patiently then didn't like it.  Would not make again.

This is a very good but not best recipe. For a beginner this was easy and tastes very good. I did add some cinnamon and mixed in chopped walnuts. I'll try other banana bread recipes but since this my first I wanted to write a review and this is a good one to start with.

This is really good... I'm happy I didn't write a review right away because for some reason, it didn't taste so good when it was warm, but after it had been in the fridge for a while it tasted much better! It's such an easy recipe- i prepared the batter at 11 o'clock at night when I saw how black my bananas were and didn't think they would last another day, even for baking :@)I put the batter in the fridge and baked it in the morning in two narrow loaf pans, and it took about 40 minutes to bake.I used canola oil instead of margarine, and used three bananas (because that's what I had).I will definately add another banana next time. My husband and my two year old really enjoyed it :@)Thanks for the recipe!

I can't say enough about this recipe.  The only thing I added was 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  The second time I made it I included pecans.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Very good flavor and is moist!

I added the brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla that the other reader suggested and added a little more banana. This was the best banana bread i've made so far. Super moist!

This bread was good- a typical banana bread kind of good.  I was surprised by all the rave reviews, quite frankly.
2019- made this again!  It was tasty.  It called for so many bananas, I didn't have enough so I filled in with applesauce.  Very moist and good.

This bread was excellent, i had family staying with me and it was gone in less then 24 hours, powdered sugar and melted butter on top is definately the way to go, next time i'll add some chocolate chips for some more yumminess!

What a great banana bread recipe.  Really simple and good to have the kids help with preparing.  Could easily add nuts or chocolate chips to make it a little sweeter.

The bread was very easy to make, and smelled awesome while it was baking but came out a little dry, I will make it again but probably won't cook it for the whole hour, maybe 50-55 min. next time instead of the whole hour.. And i'll definitely try some other suggestions that people have made to improve it. But I definitely would suggest to give it a try. :o)

Wow, this was soooo simple and turned out just perfect.  I used brown and white sugar as suggested by others and am about to go make another loaf.  It really was great with lots of banana flavor, even more good flavor than other recipes that call for more bananas.  Yum yum, thanks.

This was a great starter recipe. I follwed some suggestions from other reviewers. I split the sugar so it was 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I halved the butter and used applesauce for the other half.  I also added some cinnamon and vanilla.  I made 4 mini loaves with this recipe and had enough dough left over to make another 2 mini loaves.  Keep an eye on it in the oven if you stray from the regular loaf pan size.  I would make again when I have bananas that are going bad.

I made this banana bread for the first time last night and took it to a get-together and with great success. I took others advise and stirred in a little sour cream, cinnamon and sour cream which were great suggestions! This makes a wonderfully moist bread. Thanks!

I did bake this mostly according to the recipe.  The only difference is I added the 1 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 tsp clove and chopped walnuts.  Before baking I sprinkled sugar, cinnamon & more nuts over the top.  Oh, and I made them into muffins for easier eating.  The texture was great, very moist and not cakey at all.  It could have used some more spice, they were a little bland.  Maybe 2 tsp cinnamon or some brown sugar.  But still very tasty.

This bread is so yummy, but I agree about it being better after it has had the chance to cool overnight.  And mine was overcooked after cooking for an hour, so next time I will start checking it at 40 minutes and take it from there.  But I will definatly make it again!

This is a very good basic recipe for banana bread!  Only thing I changed was I omitted the baking soda and flour and used self rising flour.  I'll make this again.  So simple!

I've been making banana bread for a long time, but this is the best recipe I've found.  Had requests for me to make it again right away.

Very good banana bread.  I was looking for one that wasn't too sweet or too dense and this one fit the bill.  I added a bunch of walnuts for crunch and used butter instead of margarine.  It took longer than 1hour to cook, but I always find that with banana bread and most loaves.

My son loved these, pronounced them "better than the box."  I used butter instead of margarine and 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar.  Quick and easy to make; baked beautifully in muffin cups for about 22 minutes.

Yummm!!!  
I actually used butter instead of margrine and cut the amount in half using applesause for the other half, and i cut the sugar in half using splenda for the other half.  Came out delicious and can't tell at all that it has half the fat and calories!!!

Oh, and be sure to use over ripend bananas (almost rotten) to get the full/strong banana flavor!!!

Excellent results.  The video mentioned adding chocolate chips if you have a chocolate lover in the house.  I added chopped toasted walnuts instead - about 1 to 1 ½ cups, and it was fabulous!  The bread itself was amazing with or without the nuts. A keeper.

I did the half brown sugar half white. I added in cinnamon, nuts and vanilla. IT DOES NOT NEED TO BAKE FOR AN HOUR FOR SOME PANS. I luckily checked mine at the 40 after mark and it was slightly overdone so disappointed on that end. I just made some glaze from powdered sugar, milk (almond or whatever you prefer) and vanilla it add more flavor and moisture. I would make again so I can perfect it next time.

I’ve tried a lot of different banana recipes, and this one is just not good. I added in cinnamon and vanilla cause it seemed wrong not to. It’s just a very dense (I’m adamant about not over mixing) and very dry.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe. I have made the suggested adjustments and use half white sugar, half brown. I add a little vanilla and cinnamon as well. On occasion, I will add cinnamon chips and it's delicious! It's also great as muffins!

This was the second time I made it. I  just cut out some of the sugar. I added some walnuts. Took it to my senior center and shared with 13  other people. They all said it was very good!

I also exchanged the 1 cup of sugar for 1/2c white and 1/2c light brown and added 1 teas of vanilla.  Good flavor, but I used a ceramic loaf pan and baked it for 50 minutes at 350 and the edges where getting really brown and the middle was slightly soft.  Didn’t want the bread to burn so I took it out... once it cooled it was a little raw in the upper center.  Next time I will try a metal loaf pan...  maybe lower the temp and leave in longer.

My boys just ate 1/2 the loaf. I added vanilla and walnuts on the top 1/2. One son likes nuts and the other doesn’t. We put butter on each slice with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Yummy!

This was a really good recipe, but I mixed a half cup of brown sugar and regular sugar and doubled the bananas. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla.

I was pleasantly surprised by this simple recipe! I followed others’ suggestions and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and some cinnamon.

A little sweet if you are concerned about sugar intake, but super super simple and the family loves it!!!!  I add walnuts and allspice or cinnamon.  Made a vegan version of it too with egg substitute and nutalex.  Super yum and very moist!

I've made this recipe several times whenever I have overripe bananas. Turns out great every time!  I use butter instead of margarine, but everything else as is.  I usually mash up my bananas first and scale the recipe based on how many cups of banana mush I have. Not all bananas are the same size and the ratio is important.

This is delicious and we decided to add white chocolate chips just to give it a bit of a sweetness. I usually like chocolate chips but the white is really fun.

I like this recipe a lot because it's sooo simple, no fancy ingredients...  I  just add a splash of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and sometimes I use half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Easy, simple and delicious.

It was absolutely delicious! I love adding chopped up walnuts to give the bread a little something more. I put in an extra 1/4 cup of sugar since I like my banana bread a bit sweet. Also, I was lazy and didn't completely mash up my bananas which resulted in some chunks of banana in the bread which I actually really liked. 10/10 would make again. This is my go-to banana bread recipe.

This  bread is great , always moist and always bakes up high . It's not the only BB recipe I use , but it's on my favorites. I always double the recipe to make bread and muffins so that I can add in what everyone in my family likes , the favorite is the peanut butter chips , if you love peanut butter and haven't tried that , you really MUST !

I made this recipe, substituting 1/2 C applesauce for the 1/2 C margarine. Frankly, I did not miss the margarine at all. I added 1 cup of lightly skillet toasted walnuts and then gave them a rough chop. I used parchment paper in a loaf pan for easy removal. I shared it with neighbors and family. They all loved it. It was moist and delicious! My grandchildren can’t wait for me to make more. ????

This is my all time favorite. Simple and few ingredients. Sometimes I add chocolate chips or dried fruit.

I followed the recipe as written - with two exceptions, I used 2 8x3x2 foil pans. (Throw away pans used out of laziness & ease) Also, I added about a cup of chopped walnuts. Bread came out so flavorful & moist. Bonus is how amazing my kitchen smells!! Will certainly use this recipe again. Just for reference, I had almost over-ripe bananas in the freezer waiting for use. I allowed them to thaw on the counter as I prepared the batter, I used 4 good size bananas. Perfection.

I used salted butter instead of margarine. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar. The addition of 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1 tsp. vanilla bean paste and 1-2 tbsp. dark rum made this a very delicious bread!

I have made this recipe twice now. Both times I have doubled the recipe.  Usually have more than 3 ripe bananas.  I use the next size smaller pans and it makes 4 loaves. I add vanilla extract to the mixed. I also add mini chocolate chips to half of the batter.  It doesn't last long in my house with 4 kids.

Great recipe! Made a few minor changes. Used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar. Added a splash of vanilla extract, 1 and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Would definitely make again!

I like the simplicity of this recipe. I don't usually have all ingredients in my cupboard but for this recipe I did.  I used margarine spread instead of the stick but it still turned out delicious.  My breads always seem a little darker than the picture but taste good.  I didn't alter the recipe with other ingredients and won't when I bake it again.  I do think I needed a half  to one more banana.  I used 2 medium sized.  But it was moist and yummy.

I give this recipe 5 stars as a good, easy basic recipe with lots of room for change if desired. I opted to use half butter and half applesauce and added a half teaspoon of cinnamon, but think it could use more. I like that the recipe calls for the banana measured in cups, rather than just calling for 3 or 4 bananas. Fruit comes in so many different sizes, and I needed about 5 ripe bananas to get 1&1/2 cups. When baking breads, cookies, or cakes, experience has taught me to start checking doneness at least 15 minutes earlier than the recipe calls for, due to variations in ingredients and oven temperatures and kind of pans used. Glad I did the toothpick test 20 minutes earlier. I always use an oven thermometer and used the temp called for, but no way it would have taken an hour.  I covered it in foil to finish it off for a few additional minutes, and dropped the oven temp 25 degrees. It still turned out nice and moist, but only needs about 40 to 50 minutes at 350. I will use this recipe again, but will probably use all applesauce rather than butter or margarine, and add more cinnamon and maybe even add some raisins and pecans or walnuts.

This recipe doesn't quite do it for me on banana bread. I prefer my banana bread much more moist. I agree that it  would probably be a great quick bread recipe to use with other flavorings. I might try decreasing the flour to 1.5 cups flour next time.

I've made this recipe a bunch of times and the only change was using half brown sugar like other reviewers recommended.  This last time I made muffins instead of the usual loaf and they were perfect!  Only took about 18-20 min to bake.

It is baking right now. Easy to make. I had a recipe that included buttermilk, but didn't have the buttermilk. I had started the original recipe which included salt(1tsp) and 1 tsp of vanilla. That is the only additions.

Gave it four stars when I made it as written as I found it a little lacking in flavor.  Very good but not great.  I then made using gluten free flour baking blend ( a cheap one), added 2 tablespoons of spiced rum, 2 tablespoon of pineapple frozen concentrate (no water added), 1/2 t of cinnamon and 1/2 t of nutmeg.  I also did what others suggested and blended brown and white sugar.  I know it's a lot of changes.  But, it can be done gluten free easily.

It was so delicious! It was nice and fluffy in the foil pan. More crunchy texture in the glass bowls. I had 3 cups mashed bananas so I doubled the recipe. I didn't have any baking soda so I substitute baking powder which is 3x the amount of baking soda..so 1 tsp baking soda equals 3 tsp baking powder. I added a little vanilla essence. I also used 1 cup white and 1 cup browns sugar. I will use less sugar next time and a little oil. I definitely need a loaf pan or glass bowls as the foil pan and glass varies in texture and cooking time .I will always make this again

Turned out great. I substituted coconut oil for the margarine for a healthier fat. It was the perfect consistency for a banana bread, I thought. Next time I may substitute applesauce to make it without the fat.

This bread took longer to bake--about 1 1/2 hours.  Maybe because I used 3 over-ripe bananas & added a little chocolate wine for flavor.  Also, I messed up and creamed the sugar with the egg first. Oh, well. When finally done, it was wonderful.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and a little cinnamon. Used butter instead of margarine.  I will make it again without the mistakes.

My 2.5 yr. old son is allergic to milk’s protein and eggs. It is sad to see his face while other kids, or his sister, are eating cake, cookies, etc. and he can’t. I’m no baker but I decided to look for recipes of cakes that he could eat, and I found this simple recipe to which I made variations to make it allergens free and the result is WONDERFUL. He loves it!!!! I have already made it 3 times, and everyone loves it. They don’t believe it has no eggs or butter.

I loved this recipe, only I too added my own twist by making it gluten free and still the best darn banana bread anyone I know has wrapped their lips around! Thankyou for the beginning of my all new glutin free beads and various recipes, dedicated to glutin free eating without losing a spec of the moisture or taste. I hope someone tries this, because I really want others to see just how amazing it is.
Using this recipe :
Use 8 ripe bananas
Double everything else. 
A cup of chopped walnuts of you like them. 
Use 3t vanella
Use glutin free Paleo flour, which is a blend of Almond flower, arrowroot starch, coconut & tapioca flours. 
I don't know anything about how to give the exact amounts in the bread. That part you'll have to figure out for yourself. Also, I use parchment paper because it's all I've ever used. It certainly always does right by me. 
Enjoy, and somebody please give this a shot! 
Thanks, Ginger 
Feel free to subsatute butter with apple sauce. 
Cook 50mins and check. Actually if check at 40.you want it just to the point of your pick chiming out clean. Not 5 mins after.
Ps I've tried to add photos three times unsuccessfully. Bummer.

O M G!!! I would give this 10 stars if I could!!! I used the recipe as a base with my own additions. I used 6 overly ripe bananas. I added 2 tsp of vanilla extract. We love to really taste our vanilla! I added 1/2 tsp of salt based on another viewers suggestion. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and threw in some walnuts . I buttered my mini loaf pan and dusted it with a cinnamon and sugar mix. As an experiment, I mixed blueberries in one of the loaves.  I baked them for 45 minutes at 350. The smell permeated the house amazingly! I removed 4 beautiful loaves and placed them on the cooling rack to cool. Well, they only cooled for a few minutes before we tore into them. The bread was super moist and dense. The best part was that beautiful cinnamon and sugar crust around the bread. The blueberry loaf was the ultimate!!!!!! This is now a staple for our household!!! Did I forget to tell you that I put the cinnamon and sugar mix over the top too???!!!I tried another banana bread recipe from this site and I couldn’t taste hardly any banana!!! This was soooooo delicious and even better the next day!!! Thank you all for your reviews and sharing your modifications!!! They always help me make recipes to my family’s liking and we end up with new recipes that we all enjoy!!!!

I reduced sugar to 2/3 instead of 1 cup.  Maybe baking time should be less as mine turned a little dry.

Instead of making the whole loaf of banana bread, I made muffins instead and added chopped pecans. If you make the muffins, half the baking time and keep and eye on them.

This is a fabulous basic recipe. I modified it quite a bit though. Are used one cup of whole wheat flour and one cup of white flour. Are used a quarter cup of margarine and a small container of unsweetened applesauce. Are used a quarter cup of white sugar and a quarter cup of brown sugar. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon, and some chocolate chips. It came out delicious

I make this in a 6-cup bundt pan in my Instant Pot pressure cooker. I add 1-cup of chopped walnuts as we like them and it just adds a nice touch. Following general directions for this appliance (2-cup water in bottom of pot, place bundt pan on trivet), cover bread lightly with parchment paper and foil, bake on high medium pressure for 45 minutes and 10-minute natural pressure release, then release remaining pressure. Cool in the pan completely then turn out. This makes the bread extremely moist, almost like a cake. Yummy. Hubby likes it topped with whipped cream. I would recommend this recipe as written, but add nuts if it’s your ‘thing’.

This is a great basic recipe if you keep the dry-to-wet ratio the same.  I threw a little bit of everything in this recipe: cooked yams, applesauce and some apricot jam that I wanted to use up. I measured those things and counted it as bananas! Then the rest of the recipe was the same. I know, it wasn't really the same recipe but since it is so versatile, I wanted to give it 5 stars.

Easy and simple recipe. Nothing more than what you need and makes a great dense bread. I add vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon and some chocolate chips.

Oh man, this is SOOO good. It's a very simple recipe, it's very much just banana, and it tastes amazing. I had 3 bananas that I had lot's of spots and sugary goodness, and I feel it made it that much better. This is fantastic, and if you like pure banana bread with no raisins or walnuts, give this a shot. I may try it again with walnuts later, but this is just perfect as is.

This is the first banana bread recipe I’ve tried and It is so easy and quick! Perfect texture, so delicious and moist. Tips: Make sure to fully mash the bananas to get the smoothest possible texture. Add one teaspoon of vanilla, a few dashes or cinnamon, and a little pinch of nutmeg.

It was easy and turn ok... I would put less less sugar though.  I added 1/3 cup of sour cream, and a cup of pecans...

I tried the recipe as written and added some Jamaican rum as a reviewer suggested.  Wonderful!  I won't make banana bread or any other quick bread going forward without adding rum.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious-moist and and very flavorful. Other banana bread recipes I've tried on this site were much too sweet, but this was perfect! I usually don't alter the recipes in any way the first time. And in my experience, when I try one that works, there's no point in changing it... otherwise, it's not the same recipe once ingredients are added, subtracted, or changed. I tripled the recipe so I could freeze a couple loaves, and the bread turned out perfectly!

I followed the suggestion to use half white/half brown sugar, decrease the flour and use applesauce instead of butter. I also added some vanilla and cinnamon and a pinch of soft. Next time I’m going to add more flour  and nutmeg. Check out the final product on IG @bakersdoesin

I made it with 1/2 cup each honey and maple syrup, and left the rest as is. It took about 1 hr 10 minutes to bake. This is a simple and delicious recipe.

I found this to be tasteless. I am a seasoned baker so I’m not afraid to change things up so I added extra bananas and like I reviewer suggested, added brown sugar and also cinnamon. It is just bland.  So disappointed. I doubled the recipe so I wasted a lot!

I tweaked the recipes and used 3 small very ripe bananas, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Added 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extracted, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and made sure to also sift the flour. Just for kicks I added 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips! It came out super moist and fluffy--perfection!

Made as cupcakes, baked @175C for 35 minutes.  Used  2 cups bananas in big chunks,  also 1 cup panela, 1/2 cup banana flour, 1 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, the rest is the original recipe.  Yum!

Easy enough for the kids to make mostly on their own, good texture, and very banana-y.  Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar for a little more depth of flavor and added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch of salt, per other reviewers.

Sort of bland. The second time I added cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and 1/8 tsp of salt. The third time I added walnuts as well. I only gave it 3 stars because, I had to alter the recipe so much. Good base/starter recipe, but not appealing on it's own.

Delicious! I added walnuts, used four bananas and 1 tsp. of baking powder and baking soda. If your bread is bland and dry either you're mixing it too much, your oven runs hotter than the temp on the dial and/or you didn't use enough banana. You could probably safely use up to five medium bananas in this recipe before it gets too mushy. If it's too sweet, only use as half cup of brown sugar.

Great recipe but i modified mine. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar while adding 1 tsp of vanilla to the mix. Also I only had 2 bananas (all I had)  and it still turned out great. Gave a slice of it  to a neighbour and she loved loved it!

Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I used half white, half brown sugar, and butter instead of margarine (I don't use margarine, anyway). I thought the flavor was pretty good, but not outstanding. If I try this one again, I'll probably play with it a bit to see if I can add some oomph to it.

This banana bread was okay, but I have tasted and made better banana bread with other recipes. The bread was super dense and crumbly. When I cut the bread, it sort of fell apart.

My favourite snack is moist banana bread! This recipe nails the craving every time I have one. It's flavourful and not overly sweet. Sometimes, I'll omit the eggs and use applesauce instead, or I'll add a little bit of vanilla extract but this recipe is delicious on its own.

Very good recipe!  I used butter in place of the margarine, and substituted Truvia, and sugar / stevia baking blend, for the sugar.  When I find that I have a banana that's getting overripe, I slice it up and put it in a zip lock bag in the freezer so that I always have banana on hand for banana bread.  Thank you for the recipe, Libby!

Not the best banana bread I have ever made. But it was super easy to make. I did add vanilla and cinnamon. I did not have any walnuts or else I would have added those too. I also prefer recipes with brown sugar than all white sugar.

I doubled this recipe, and I used half whole wheat flour and half all Purpose flour. Added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon of rum extract, and 1/2 cup of molasses. I kept busy in the kitchen and kept checking on the bread, I made 36 mini muffins, 21 regular muffins and one loaf pan worth of bread. One of the best recipes I have had.

I absolutely love this recipe! However, in order to make this allergen friendly for my son, I made a few modifications. I replace white sugar with coconut sugar, replace the eggs with ground flaxseed meal, replace margarine with dairy free/ soy free shortening, and I add about 1/2 cup of allergen free chocolate chips. We also use this to make muffins. This recipe is great both ways!

Excellent recipe!   Moist and not overly sweet.  I also added the topping one other reviewer suggested which was the 2T of sugar. 1t of cinnamon and 2T of chopped pecans.   I actually use and old spice grinder to chop the nuts.  Makes the perfect topping but excellent without as well.  This will be my new go to recipe for banana bread.

Big hit in my house and when they say "Best Ever Banana Bread" they are not kidding. Few and easy ingredients, no fuss and very tasty.  With lots of options to put your own spin on things if you so choose.

This is the easiest banana bread recipe to make! I wasn't sure the first time but hubby said it was perfect-- not too sweet. He ate half the loaf! I am making it again incorporating the suggestions for 1/2 brown sugar and adding vanilla.  The original recipe does not list vanilla, but I think it will be even better with.  Hoping hubby will like this version just as much.

No changes and it was wonderful.  Not too sweet, which we like.

Love the recipe. So easy. I added vanilla, all spice, and some walnuts but the flavor for the base is good. Easy recipe to have kids make. : )

This bread recipe is very good! After reading the reviews, I made a few adjustments, substituted 1/2 sugar with brown sugar, use 1.5 cup flour, added chopped walnuts and baked 1 hour. 
The bread turns out nice and moist. Yum!

I made this for the first time and I followed many tips given. I didn't measure bananas I used five, I hade some extra ripe frozen ones in the fridge. I used half brown sugar and white sugar. I didn't have eggs so I used organic flaxseed as a substitute and I added almond extract since I was out of vanilla. I also used a cup of oats in place of a cup of flour. My own added 'tis bits is I made a brown sugar and cinnamon crumble for the top and added some of my powdered organic peanut butter. You can't taste the peanut butter flavor at all but I didn't add a lot. The cake is super moist and full of banana flavor this would be perfect to serve with coffee in the morning. You can add all your own sparkle on this recipe and it still will come out great, you can't mess this one up.

This turned out absolutely delicious! I did not have margin or butter, so I just used olive oil (great substitute) and it turned out wonderful! It tastes soft and moist with a little crunch on the edges. I highly recommend you try making this recipe!

Thank you for making this recipe available for me to be able to build on. :)

I made it with self rising flour instead of all purpose and used 2 bananas and it was very good. Plan to make it again and share it with family and friends. Thanks for this simple recipe.

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup applesauce (homemade) and 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 whole cup of sugar. I also put some thin banana slices on top of the batter for garnish. I steamed it in the rice cooker until the batter was congealed; then I popped it in the oven and baked until the edges were crispy.

This is my go to recipe for my banana bread. I have made this recipe countless times. I bake and sell baked goods all the time and this recipe always gets rave reviews. I also mix it up a bit by adding nuts or chocolate chips too.

Delicous! I doubled the banana just because that's how many I had but it worked great! I also added 1/4 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp  cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Added in some candied, cinnamon pecans we got from Target too. Amazing!! We did end up making large  muffins instead of a loaf and cut the cooking time in half. Lots of modification but so so good!!

Made this with my MIL the other day, she said it was the best Banana Bread she's ever seen/made! It was delicious.  And we did swap the white for brown sugar and made double the portion of everything and it still turned out amazing. Very easy.

I really liked this bread.  Made two loaves by doubling everything but the bananas.  Next time will use more bananas as it came out a bit dry.  Also added 1/2 c nuts and 1/2 c mini chocolate chips.   My family gobbled it down.

Love this recipe. I'm not a big baker  but I had a large bunch of ripe bananas  that I did not want to go to waste.  The simplicity of this recipe was attractive to me. I did add real butter and a teaspoon of vanilla. 
 I gave a loaf to my mom who served it at her card group. It was a hit. In fact, my mom is going to replace her recipe that she has used for many many years with this one.

Fabulously moist and delicious, light bread. I've made a loaf but also used individual muffin cases for my second batch and those little loaves looked so cute!
I switched the margarine for coconut oil and the white sugar for coconut sugar- which lends a fantastic 'toffee' flavour to the bake. I also added natural vanilla essence and a tiny sprinkle of cinnamon for depth of flavour. 
Highly recommend!

This is a very easy recipe and came out nice and high and moist.  I do think it could use a bit more flavor, maybe vanilla or cinnamon. I didn't have much butter so used 1/4 c. Butter and 1/4 cup yogurt and it worked wonderfully.  Nice and moist and rose nice and high. I would make this again :)

This bread needs spice - I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves. Also used 3 small bananas which was a bit more than 1.5 cups. Substitute apple sauce for butter for a healthier alternative.

The texture was great, it looked and smelled perfect, and the taste was also good. We liked it. I'll be experimenting with it and making it again many times to come.

Based off other reviews and personal taste, I did half and half brown sugar and white sugar, added 1 tbs cinnamon, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp almond extract. I also got distracted while mashing bananas and didn't get a proper measurement, so I just used 5 large (ripe) bananas.

The main thing I intend to do the next time I bake this is to double the cinnamon, vanilla, and almond extracts. Maybe add a little bit of nutmeg for an extra kick. Just a personal preference.

I loved this bread! I thought that it was great but I don't think the margarine was a very good touch so instead I used normal butter. I don't think it affected the bread. But otherwise it was great!

Easy peasy!  I always add salt w cinnamon, added 1/2 cup cooked grits (always makes for moist) a heaping tablespoon of mayo and rum!  A smooth and very tasty treat!  yum

Thanks for this recipe  :)

Easy.  Liked the finished product.  My fault it was a little too brown.  I like the fact that the recipe has only 6 ingredients, all of which I always have on hand.  I will make it again but add nuts and raisins.  I usually make muffins but this time made the recipe in an 8x8 pan.  Worked well for slicing.

It was OK - good banana flavor and moist.  I tried it because it used more banana that my normal recipe (Betty Crocker White Nut Bread modified for banana bread) and didn't have milk.  I guess it was just not what I was used to.  It was a hit at the bake sale.  Don't think I would make it again for my family.  Going to stick with what I know.

I changed it slightly to use what I had on hand  I used shortening in place of margarine and used self rising flour in place of the flour and baking soda. And I had about 2 cups 5 mediumish bananas. Added a tablespoon of vanilla butter nut flavoring. Made into muffins baked for about 25 minutes at 350.

Delicious and moist! My 3 yr old helped me make this last night. We made it as written (with one minor misstep... I forgot to flour the pan after greasing it... Oops) still turned out perfectly. Looking forward to the next time I have super ripe bananas!

I add more banana to it (3 good-sized bananas is usually a good balance), and the occasional chocolate chip but this is easily my go-to for banana bread.

Very delicious, simple recipe! I like very soft and moist bread, so I made the following changes:

- Added 1 tsp. vanilla
- Added 1/4 c. sour cream
- Used closer to 2 1/4 c. of bananas

I made both a loaf and muffins with this, and they turned out wonderful! You can also add chocolate chips or nuts; I usually coat them in flour before I mix them in the dough, to keep them from falling to the bottom of the pan.

I normally make it exactly as directed, adding chocolate chips and walnuts... this time I attempted to make these vegan.  Lesson learned!!!  Eggs and real butter are just so much better, however it's definitely an acceptable vegan/egg-free/dairy free option using EnerG egg replacer.  I prefer this recipe over the other banana bread recipes because of the ingredient simplicity...less is more.  I always have these basic ingredients on hand.

Moist and less dense than our usual recipe, very delicious.  Notes for me:  1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugars, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla seeds in syrup, 2 cups bananas, 1/4 cup chocolate chips, butter.  Ran out of flour, used 1/2 cup self-rising.  Sift all dry together, mix all wet together, make well & combine w hands, gently add chips.  Bake at 350/45min. Let cool 30min b/f serving.

It was OK. The texture was a little off and it was a little boring. I even added a little pumpkin pie spice and still....just ok. Probably a good base though and with enough butter everyone ate it just fine.

This is a good base recipe, but I think it's missing several ingredients to make it great.
I made some changes and it was very tasty.
1/2 dark brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tsp. Vanilla
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
1/3 cup applesauce 

Came out moist and tasty.

I reduced the sugar and fat by 1/3 and substituted whole wheat flour 1/2 of the flour and reduced that a bit too. I also substituted coconut oil for the margarine and used 1/2 coconut sugar and 1/2 brown sugar for the white sugar. I made muffins instead of bread and sprinkled the tops with crunched up granola. They're our Saturday morning faves.

Yummy!!! I wanted a very basic recipe with no nuts for the hubby as he doesn't like. I followed most of the recipe, but i only had 2 over ripe bananas and i added 1tsp vanilla. I also cooked as muffins to cut the bake time down as we just couldn't wait to taste them. It made exactly 1dozen small muffins and they lasted 3 days. I will be using this as my go to recipe for banana bread from now on.

It's fall now, so I added 1/2 a 15 oz. can of pumpkin pure and 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice!  

Also, after reading other reviews, instead of 2 cups of flour, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup oatmeal.  And, instead of 1 cup sugar, I used I/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. 

I also made muffins - kept it at 350 degrees, but only cooked for 25-28 minutes.  They were so moist and delicious!!!  I can't wait to bake these again!  I may add chocolate chips next time!

Instead of using one 9"X 5" pan I used 2 5" X 3" pans and it came out just as nicely. I also used 1/2c of butter instead of margarine due to having to improv at the last minute. I never tried it with the margarine but the butter version was fantastic! I kept in in the over for just under an hour, which luckily gave me the soft yet solidified texture I was hoping for. I also added about 2c of chocolate chips for fun. :)

Needs work but a good basic recipe. I added walnuts, cinnamon, used only 1 1/2 cups of flour. Too much flour will make it dry. Also a dash of vanilla is good to enhance flavor

I was looking for a simple no fuss recipe and this was perfect. I had everything on hand and I love my banana bread with brown sugar, so I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of cane sugar.  I also added hand crush walnuts to the batter and topped the bread with brown sugar to caramelize in the oven.  My ol' my it turned out delicious and my boyfriend agreed that this recipe was a keeper.

The best banana bread I've ever made. Lives up to it's name. So tasty and bursting with banana flavors without being too overpowering. The banana bread is moist inside and slightly crispy outside just the way I like it. Best thing, is that the recipe is so simple! Just be careful not to overmix. I'll definitely make this again!

I've made this several times and it's a great recipe.  I even use it with plantain.  Using plantain or with bananas which are still a bit firm, I saute them in butter until soft enough to mash.  Plantain tends to be a little more fibrous than banana, so it makes a few fruit chunks in the loaf, which for me is all to the good.  I also add a teaspoon of vanilla, sometimes some cinnamon or nutmeg.  I like to add chopped nuts, but they are so expensive here on the island that I don't bother.

I haven't rated it yet but, it's in the oven. Seems to be a very dense dough. Smells yummy though! I followed some suggestions added 4 bananas, splash of rum splash of vanilla splash of black walnut extracts. 1 3/4 cups flour....can't wait to eat it! I'll let everyone know how it turns out!

I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of Malt-O-Meal which is the same as Cream of Wheat.  I also ran out of bananas.  I thought I had 3 but only had 2.  My mashed bananas equalled 1 cup so I mashed up 1/2 cup of canned peaches (2 snack cups).  I was also a tad short of margarine and made up the difference (about 1/8 cup) of apple sauce.  I threw in 1/2 teaspoon of baking spice and another 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon plus 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I baked the bread on the lowest rack for one hour. Well,  I thought this bread was going to be a disaster.  It turned out perfectly.  It is moist and dense.  The banana and peaches really compliment each other.  Great recipe.  I can't believe how so many substitutions can result in such a wonderful bread.

I only had two ripe bananas so threw in a big spoon of chunky applesauce, with some walnuts and put a little salt in as well. I used real butter, unsalted. It is a basic recipe which I like. Few ingredients making it fast and easy. I can add choco chips, or whatever I want to it and make it different every time. Liked it.

Very good.  I did make a few changes for the first time made - substituted butter for margarine; 1 c of sugar for 1/2 c brown sugar 1/2 c of regular sugar; 1 t of pumpkin spice (had on hand), 1 pinch of salt.  Want to try apple sauce next time.  Yum!

I make this recipe quite a bit. I usually will add chocolate chips, and when I put the loaf in the oven I sprinkle chopped walnuts on top and some brown sugar. Make sure you do this step before! I forgot last time, and was disapointed that the walnuts didn't stay on. But I guess that's what cooking is about - what works and what doesn't!

Very simple and moist. 1.5 cups of bananas is about 3 full bananas. Like other reviewers, i substituted half the amt of sugar with brown sugar, added a dash of salt, 1/2 t vanilla, and added some cinnamon. Used butter instead also. Baked in a glass pan at 325 for about 45 minutes.

This banana bread is wonderful!  I made a couple of changes.  I changed the margarine to 1/4 C. and added 1/4 C. vanilla yogurt.  I also added 1/2 C brown sugar and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 C.  I also added cinnamon and sugar to the bottom of the pan before I baked it.  FANTASTIC!

Simply yummy. Took like 5 mins to throw everything in mixer and baked it for 45 minutes. I used 1 3/4 cups of flour and it was super moist . I threw in some pecans and almonds but will add more next time as it was nice biting into a nut and it added a crunch to the cake. I will definitely be making this recipe again as I always have leftover bananas, next time I might put more than 2 for a more banana tasting cake.

Nice recipe! I have found that if you want a more banana flavor for this bread is to buy green bananas and let them sit in a closed plastic bag for 1 week! My family loves the great taste! :D

Love the simplicity of this recipe. Egg allergy over here so, used flax seed/water mix to sub....used 1/2 c whole wheat flour 1/2c regular..... I love the density of it. It popped right out of the pan and I wish my home could smell like this permanently! This for me was the perfect sweetness. My kids and husband love it as well. We'll be making this one any time we have 3 bananas looking to be used! Yum!

I must have done something wrong.  So disappointed.  Read the reviews and used the brown/white sugar combo.  Added some nutmeg and cinnamon.  Baked 1 hour, toothpick came out clean.  Tipped the pan onto the cooking rack and it was FAR from done.  Scooped what I could back into the pan and back in the oven it goes.  This is the FIRST time I am not been completely thrilled with any recipes on this site.  Chose 3 stars because I'm sure, once it is done...it was be awesome.

This was very good and will definitely be my go to banana bread recipe.  I tried to make it a little healthier since my son will usually eat it for breakfast. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup instead of the full cup. I also used 1/2 cup of white whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour.  This made the bread a little denser than we are used to, but it was still very good. I also added a dash of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla extract. Thanks!

I use this recipe all the time! I like to add oats to the banana bread. It's also great to substitute Sweet Potato puree instead of the bananas, and then top with either cream cheese frosting or nutella.

I loved this.  It turned out great.  So simple, I stayed true to the recipe but added some chopped walnuts.  Now that I know it is a keeper, I may experiment a little.

Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugars, cut flour back to 1 1/2 cups, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and sometimes I throw in 1 cup of chocolate chips. Delicious! I've made this recipe substituting 1/2 cup applesauce (as another member mentioned) for the margarine and you can't tell the difference! I make them into muffins instead of the loaf but decrease the cook time to 20-25 min

Great basic bread recipe!! I didn't have any bananas so I just used applesauce and added a bit of cinnamon. They turned out great as muffins (made a perfect dozen in 15-20 minutes bake time). I think I will try banana and zucchini with the same recipe. Thank you!!

I'm not the best baker, but this recipe seemed easy enough, even for me.  So I followed the instructions but used the suggestions from a previous rater MomSavedbyGrace and I added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  WOW...super easy super good....

I gave this 5 stars because it is so easy to make and turns out great!  I used 3 bananas that I had frozen for a rainy day. I baked it for an hour but covered in foil the last 15 minutes after I checked it and was concerned the center would not cook through. Came out perfect! I will use this recipe again.

This is a great starter recipe, I used 2 1/2 cups mashed bananas and added 1 teaspoon vanilla. Cooking time at 350 degrees takes 1 hour 15 minutes because of extra bananas. I recommend letting stand about 15 minutes then wrap in foil and place in refrigerator. This will produce a very moist Banana Bread.

This is a great recipe!  I followed what some others had said (1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar and add 1 tsp vanilla) and it was so tasty.  I decided to make muffins rather than bake it as a loaf and they turned out really well.  I only baked them for 20mins starting at 350F for the first 15 then down to 325 for the last 5 because they were browning faster on the top than they were cooking in the middles.  All in all, I will make this recipe again!

I did what Momsavedbygrace did and made a ew substitutions. I added butter instead of margarine, 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2, and mixed half brown sugar and half white sugar, as well as the 1 tsp vin. and sprinkle of cin. I also added 2 tbsp of applesauce to give it a creamier consistency. Outstanding and quick way to use up old bananas!

It was not my all time best banana bread... a little dry.  It was, however, very easy and if served right away nobody would know that it could get dry!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I make it with butter instead of margarine, 1/2 cup each brown and white sugar, dash of salt, cinnamon and nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and if I'm in the mood, a handful or 2 of semisweet chocolate chips.  The absolute BEST banana bread I have ever had!  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe - it will be an heirloom in our home!

Great recipe. Added 1 Tsp Cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, 1 tsp of vanilla and added raisins. It was great. Plus used mini loaf pan so I could freeze some.  Also took advice of 30 min at 350 then 30 min at 300. Moist and delic.

This is the first banana bread I have ever made, and it was great! It's also very easy. I made it after dinner spur of the moment when I realized my banana's days were numbered. The whole family loved it! Great recipe!

Super good and very easy! This was my first time making Banana Bread but I have a hard time ever following recipes, so I made some changes. I added some cinnamon and vanilla.  I also chopped up some apples and pineapple into small chunks and tossed them in. It added a very fun flavor. To another loaf, I added chocolate chips. Enjoy!

After reading everyone else's reviews on this recipe I decided to use less overall flour, because I didn't want it to dry out around the edges. I used 1 cup of white flour and 1/2 cup of whole grain flour. I can't even tell the difference!!! It came out delicious after I covered it (tinfoil) those last 10 minutes, to get the inside cooked evenly.  Oh! And I added crushed pecans. Was yummy!

Very good banana bread - made it just like the recipe. I'll try to add pecans/wal-nuts next time.  It made a very pretty loaf. It was light, not too sweet banana bread - Not as dense as most banana breads that I've had.

such an easy recipe. I have added different nuts to it for texture, used different types of sugars for different flavors, but it always seem to work out. As of late i've been adding peanut butter chips and my girlfriends' 10 year old son loves them. I don't make loaves; I use muffin tins and they freeze great.

Top notch recipe.  Baking and I have a chequered history but I followed this to the letter and it turned out perfectly: beautifully moist, well-formed and spongy.  Since I only had three bananas and worried the flavour might be a little mild, I chopped up some dates, added a dash of cinnamon and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  I also used 1/2 a cup of golden and 1/2 a cup of white sugar, as a reviewer recommended.

First of all this bread was great, but it came out a little....not as I planned. It was a tint to hard, and maybe it's just because I only put 1/2 cup sugar? I don't know but when I make this soon (I may make this tonight...deciding) I will put the real amount of sugar and see if that does any good.

I added 100 g of chopped walnuts and used raw sugar instead of white sugar.  It turned out great... less sweet than with white sugar, and hearty with the nuts.  However, I found that I needed to cook it on a lower temperature for a longer time period because at 170 deg C, it came out completely gooey on the inside and hard on the outside.  I decreased it to 150, and it was perfect.  What spice can you add, though?  cinnamon?  nutmeg?

This recipe turned out dryer and less flavorful (although I'm not sure why) than my usual recipe.  The bread had a nice, mild flavor, but the banana was not as bold (although I used plenty of bananas) as I would prefer.

I tried the suggestions from reviews. Even though I got a lot of positive feedback, I wasn't too impressed. I'm thinking maybe my bananas were too ripe, so I'll probably try it out again.

This is the BEST banana bread recipe ever!! My family couldn't get enough of this bread and I made 4 loaves! I did add walnuts to 1 of the loaves for my daughter (my hubby doesn't like walnuts) and it didn't alter the recipe at all. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will definetly keep this to use everytime I make banana bread!!

I have tried at least 6 different Banana Bread recipes. Not one has ever come out right. This recipe came out PERFECT the very first time. My boys loved it. I did use butter not margarine and added about a half a teas. of vanilla. Great recipe, thank you so much!

This was not good.  I personally did not think there was nearly enough banana taste.

Very good! This is a wonderful, classic banana bread. The only change I made was 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup sugar. This is my new banana bread recipe.

Based on the high rating of this recipe I may have done something wrong but I was not impressed. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great.  I cooked for the recommended time and temp and the inside was waaay moist while the outside was overdone.  Due to the high rating of the recipe and possibility of error on my part I will try this recipe again but will continue my search for a great banana bread recipe.

I'm a bad baker...mostly because I improvise and don't like to follow strict directions, a bad combination when baking. I've made this recipe three times now, each with slight variations, and the third times a charm! Here is what I changed and how I'll make this for now on: I only had whole wheat flour in the house so I used 2 cups whole wheat...I was scared this would make the bread overly dense but it had the same consistency as the first 2 batches (when I used only AP flour). I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1.5 tablespoons butter (for taste). Also, 1 cup sugar sounded like a lot so I only used 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet. I only had one egg left in the house, so I used that and added @ a tablespoon of water to the mix because it was a tad dry. Using 1 egg instead of 2 didn't seem to make a difference in the final outcome (first 2 batches I used 2 eggs). I also used 1/4 tsp of salt in the third batch which really helped the pop the flavor (I didn't add salt in the first two batches). My 2.5 year old son and I Love this banana bread...we call it Banana Cake (since we don't really allow him much sugar, this is a big treat for him). Hubby won't eat anything with fruit, so more for us!!

This is THE BEST banana bread recipe.   I like to add about 1/4 c. apple sauce to it, but other than that, it's perfect. Moist and tasty - I love it!!!

I made this last night and it turned out great! I used butter instead of margarine (would have used applesauce but I was out). I used 4 bananas - I didn't measure the amount. 1 3/4 cup unbleached flour instead of 2. I also added in chopped walnuts, vanilla extract, cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and nutmeg. It was very yummy :)

What a fabulous recipe! Krista V I took your advice and used applesauce instead of butter/margarine and it was great. I love when you can substitute with applesauce, I do it whenever possible to cut down the fat. I only made a couple changes to the recipe to suit my personal taste. I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Also I do not have a loaf pan so I used an 8x8 square pan and a small muffin tin. I ended up really liking these pan sizes because it only needed 20-25 minutes to bake and I can just grab a muffin on the way out the door. Thanks for the great recipe, I will use it often!

I made a mistake somewhere in this recipe and it still turned out great! I used butter instead of margarine, added cinnamon and vanilla and reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups and used 4 bananas. I havent figured out if its because I reduced the flour or because my bananas made  more than 1 1/2 cups but the texture was very different than most banana breads. The funny thing is that my family liked it better this way since it stayed so moist. So I guess whatever I did wrong I will just have to keep doing wrong!

Amazing!  I did a "trial run" because I wanted to be sure this was good enough to take to a dinner party.  I took other reviewers advice and added cinnamon and vanilla extract, and I did end up buttering the top just a little when I took it out but before taking it out of the pan to cool (helped keep the crust on).  It's such a great base recipie that I can't wait to play with this, adding other fun ingredients - it's for sure our new favorite!

Very tasty. I made the following additions: 1 extra egg (3 total) for a more cakey texture, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 brown sugar and 1 cup chopped walnuts. Plus I sprinkled a lot of white sugar on top.

This was possibly the best banana bread I have ever eaten!! My family ate almost this whole loaf for dessert after dinner! This was so easy to make with only a few ingredients needed. I did use salted butter instead of margarine, but thats just my preference. 5 STARS!! *****

Good, but a little heavy...I did add a Tsp of Cinn and a dash of salt, I used 5 med bananas, maybe a little over 1.5 cups, looking for more banana taste. Also, it did not rise much. Over all, good, but not the best I have ever had.

Tastes good but took forever to cook thru.  The only changes I made were to use butter instead of margarine (fake food, yuck!) and I added 2/3c. chocolate chips for fun.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make and very delicious!!!  Added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (not needed, I think) plus almost a whole bag of semi sweet chocolate chips.  Made it into muffins and baked for 30 minutes.  Came out more cupcake-like than muffin-like than other banana muffin recipes I've made, a nice change from the typical banana recipe.

This banana bread is SO delicious, moist, and banana-y. My husband likes it so much he requests it weekly. My only modifications are butter instead of margarine and the addition of chopped walnuts (or pecans) and a dash of cinnamon.

Very tasty. I almost doubled the bananas though. We like more of a banana flavor in ours. I believe that is up to the individual's taste. It was great! Thank You Libby!!

This was an easy banana bread to make, but it wasn't an award-winning recipe. I might make it again if pressed for time. My main complaint is that it wasn't moist enough and the flavor wasn't amazing. Still, this is a good basic recipe.

This is a great basic banana quick bread recipe. I followed Krista's suggestions (except the rum... but that sounds great!). I also added 1.5 cups pecans and 2 tsp. vanilla and made muffins instead of the loaf. This yielded 1.5 dozen muffins. Thanks for the great recipe and the fabulous suggestions.

Wonderful! What a great recipe. I, too, used one half cup of brown and one half cup of white sugar. I also added, like someone else here recommended, 1 tablespoon of liquor I had. I added chopped nuts. I used two bananas and half a grated apple which worked really well. Then, my mom gave me an idea to decorate the top with slices of banana and thin slices of apple. Finally I sprinkled brown sugar on the slices on top for a nice brown finish. Just great!

I had 4 banana's that HAD to be used, so I made this recipe. It was just as it says, the Best Banana Bread! I didn't have any walnuts on hand so I chopped up 1 cup of almonds and wowza, it was good! I also used self rising flour and omitted the baking soda.  Came out great! This one's a keeper!

Fantastic! I loved this recipe! It was perfectly delicious. I increased the recipe to serve 25, and I used 2 cups of bananas and a little under a cup of applesauce. It turned out wonderfully. My neighborhood kids came over 3 days in a row so they could have some. I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

This recipe was so simple, but I suggest adding chopped walnuts or pecans to add a little texture. Other than that I would say use more banana for more flavor.

Second time making this recipe and I am still impressed.  Made more modifications (added more rum than last time and a touch more butter and sugar) and used my muffin pans (large and mini).  AWESOME!

I gave this 3 stars, my boyfriend said 4 - I rounded up since I made a few changes. I replaced half the butter with applesauce and added some cinnamon. This bread was a little denser than I usually like. Also, the cooking time seemed way too long - I took it out at 40 minutes and it was still a little overdone. A fairly good, basic bread - but I'll keep looking. Thanks anyway!

This banana bread was a hit.  It was very simple, and the only thing I tweaked was I used applesauce instead of oil.  Delicious!  I would love to add some chocolate chips next time.

Very easy, very good. Next time I will have to double the batch, it disappeared so fast! To make it a little healthier I used homemade applesauce in place of the margarine and organic sucanat in place of the sugar.

great recipes!  Only used 1 1/2 cups of flour and the bread turned out moist and flavorful.  I baked it for about 60 minutes and had to put foil on the top turn the last 15 minutes to let the center catch up without over browning the top.  Will make again!

This banana bread is excellent.  It is very rich.  I always use 3 large bananas.  I also add cinnamon and chocolate chips - it's sinfully rich.  My family begs me to make it all the time.

This is a great and simple recipe. I did modify it somewhat, as others suggested: added 1 tsp of Vanilla extract, some cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, substituted half the flour with oatmeal, and stirred in some slivered almonds.  I also used a cupcake tin and baked them at 325 in my convection oven for 30 minutes.  They came out great and I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This was a wonderful recipe. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white with the recommended 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla. I also used 1/4 tsp of salt. This came out moist and soft. It did get darker on the top and I was worried it was going to burn while cooking, but as dark as it got, it didn't get hard or taste poorly due to it. My kids loved it and my husband is a terrible critic and even he ate it!!

Just made this w/my daughters on a whim because I was craving banana bread and had all the (few) ingredients on hand. I followed some other reviewers and used 1/2c white and 1/2c brown sugar, 3/4 tsp vanilla, added nutmeg and cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups (not purposely, but because that's all I had left). Bread was done at 45 min.  Very moist and delicious.  Will make again (and hopefully I have walnuts on hand next time).

Made this exactly as given even though I'd read some of the reviews.  It didn't nearly cook all the way through so was difficult to get out of the pan and oozed out the bottom.  I am going to try it one more time and I'll leave it in the oven for an extra 15 or 20 minutes to see what happens.  The taste however was exceptional.

I loved this recipe !! I did follow  "MomSavedbyGrace" 's advice and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, less flour, along with adding the vanilla and cinnamon.  It was WONDERFUL !  Hubby isn't much of a bread lover but couldn't keep him out of it !!

This is one of my favorite recipes for banana bread. I've tried a couple other recipes, but they never turn out quite as good. This is my go-to recipe when I have overripe bananas sitting around.

ok, it is in the oven now. My changes were 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla, sprinkle of salt. Instead of walnuts I put in a cup of chocolate chips. Can't wait to taste it, just wanted to write down my ingredients. well, we had too many desserts for our guests to try so right now it is in the freezer. I will get back to this after trying it!

Excellent! As per other reviews, I did 1/2 cup brown. 1/2 cup withe sugar, vanilla and cinnamon for more flavor. The dash of rhum recommended by Krista V. was just the kick it needed! I also tried it with either the butter or the apple sauce and it was excellent both ways. The only thing I did different was use 1cup all purpose four and 1 cup whole wheat flour. MMMM!

I took other suggestions and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added chocolate chips.  This is a very good recipe to start with.  I used very brown bananas, it was yummy. Thanks for the recipe!!

Nice, easy and moist. I put in an extra egg and used 100gr of regular sugar and 100gr of brown.

I liked the texture and density of this recipe. What I've been looking for. I did add nuts, vanilla and cinnamon. Otherwise I think it would have been bland.

As one reviewer suggested, I used 1/4 cup of apple sauce instead of shortening, added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and some nutmeg and cinnamon, and pecans. I also only baked it for 45 minutes and that was enough.  Next time I would add more vanilla, and lots more nutmeg and cinnamon. Raspberry preserves was the perfect topping right prior to its being served. My husband loved it, I liked it very much and I think next time it will be even better with additional spicing.

Darn close to the Better Homes and Gardens 1950's recipe my family has made for years. Great flavor, dense and moist, but a little sweet. I may reduce the amount of sugar next time from 1c. to 3/4c. I added 1c. of chopped walnuts to the batter and sprinkled a few more on top before baking. I divided the batter into four mini loaves and baked for 40 minutes. I would definitely make this recipe again.

This was my first ever attempt at banana bread!  I actually made muffins because I didn't have a loaf pan.  I added chocolate chips and used the 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.  I forgot to add vanilla,  nutmeg or cinnamon like some other reviewers suggested, but I didn't miss it.  I may add it next time.  I did cut the cooking time to about 40 minutes.  They were crispy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside!  I will make these again when I have leftover bananas!!

Deliceous. I followed other reviews and used half white, half wholemeal flour and half white, half brown sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I didn't measure the bananas as I had 3 small over ripe ones that needed using up. Only needed baking for 50 minutes in my oven. Thanks for this great tasting and easy to make recipe it is already a family favourite.

I'm not a very good cook, but I found this recipe easy to make and wonderful to eat.  I did take previous users' advice to bake it with 1/2 cup of white and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar.  I also sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  Yum!

I made a couple of changes- used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar.  Also, I probably ended up using about 2 cups of bananas.  This is a keeper!

Delicious. Mild banana taste; not overpoweringly sweet like banana bread sometimes tastes. (Perhaps it was because my bananas were not overripe yet.)  Great -- I just added in some chocolate chips at the last minute.

I thought this was a great recipe!  It makes a dense, delicious bread.  I realized we were out of butter and so I followed a previous poster's suggestion and used a single serving of applesauce and a bit of Haitian rum.  It came out great but very sweet.

Excellent. The modifications I made were to do 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, rather than 1 full cup of white. Added nutmeg and vanilla, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top prior to baking. This was simple, used ingredients I had on hand, and - for me - the 1 hour cook time was perfect. Will definitely use this recipe next time I have bananas left over. Thanks!!

I love this bread. It is so tasty and easy to make. I had never made banana bread before this. It turned out great. I followed another reviewer and cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups, changed the sugar to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white, also threw in a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  I couldn't taste any of those specific flavors in the bread but I think it helped round out the flavor. Also 45 minutes is all you need and around 35 my bread starts to get too brown on top so I pop it out and put tinfoil on it. Overall a great and tasty recipe. We make it almost every week with our left over bananas.

This was the first banana bread recipe I have tried so I wasn't expecting great results on the first go but it turned out great.  I made a little icing with powdered sugar, milk and vanilla and drizzled it over the loaf once it cooled. It was delicious.

I've made this banana bread several times now, and every time it has turned out great!  It is always so moist and that's the way I like it best.  Many recipes leave banana bread dry, but this one was perfect.  I also sprinkled cinnamon-sugar on the top of the loaf before I cooked it, and it was yummy!  This is one of our favorites!

Excellent recipe.  I used the changes reviewers recommended with white/brown sugar combination, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I made three small loaves, 3" x 6" and baked them for 43 minutes at 350 degrees.  I cool them in the pans for 10 minutes then on a rack.  AFter that I put them back into the disposable pans and wrap as a little gift.  I'll be making this again for sure.

This is the best recipe for banana bread ever!!! I used whole wheat flour instead of white and it came out beautifully!  I know that this type of bread ususally goes unfrosted, but I made a little cream cheese frosting on the side and talk about good OMG!

This recipe was delicious! I did make a few adaptations as suggested in other review: 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, 1 t vanilla and 1/2 t salt. It barely lasted 2 days in my house!

I made this yesterday. After breakfast today, it's all gone! I didn't bother measuring the bananas, I just used 4 fairly large ones.

It was so easy and I did what most of the reviews said and used 1/2cup of brown and white suger. 1 1/2 cup of flour, vinaila, and real butter. I also added chuncky puntbutter and chocolate chips. I also put foil over it so the center would cook faster. We all love it. Ps there is a lot so we made a loaf and 12 muffins. Thanks

Very good bread and SO easy!  I don't bake and this turned out really great and took no time at all.  I only used three bananas but will use four next time (didn't measure).  I think nutmeg and cinammon would improve the flavor.  I will add that next time, but overall a agreat and easy recipe!

Delicious, added toasted slivered almonds and walnuts then made it again two days later since we ate it all and added the nuts plus some dried cranberries......it is quite delicious.  Oh and to be healthy I added 1/3 cup of apple sauce instead of butter or oil......oh so good!

Easy to make, tastes lovely and my little one had fun helping too! I did use the changes that a few others suggested...We used 1/2 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla and a dash of cinnamon for some extra flavour. We also sprinkled chocolate chips on top before baking and dusted with powdered sugar afterwards. Fantastic and not too much effort to make even on a lazy Sunday!

I found this bread a little too sweet and in fact I could taste the white sugar.  Maybe switching to brown sugar may make it a better taste.

I had a hard time getting this bread done in the middle. It could have been me/my oven, but by the time the inside was baked the outside was dry. I might try it again but cover it with foil partway through.

This was really yummy and simple to prepare.  I had 4 bananas so I used them up.  It did take longer than an hour to bake for me.  Other than that I followed it exactly....would be awesome with nuts, but my son hates them :(...I give it 4 1/2 stars!

I quickly skimmed through a few other reviews and made a few changes:
I made a double batch, used 1/2c butter and 1/2c applesauce, used 1c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar, used 2c flour and 2c oats, used ~2c bananas and ~1c zucchini (I was short on bananas), also added a splash of vanilla, some salt, and some cinamon.  Also added a handful of sliced almonds and a handful of walnuts.
Baked in rectangular pan for 45mins.
Tasty and great texture!  Only complaint is that it is still a little too sweet for me -- will cut back on sugar even more next time.

Very dry and not very flavorful. I had to cook it for 1 hr 45 min instead of the recommended hour, after an hour the center was still liquid. It is edible but I won't be making it again.

this is an exceptionally good banana bread loaf! my only complaint is that it took around an hour and a half to finish baking, but other than that it was soooo yummy. most banana bread recipes call for so many ingredients, and being a full-time student and a full-time mom i was delighted to find a minimal ingredient recipe that tastes great!

My hubby claims he doesn't like banana bread but after making this one he has changed his mind.  I made it with gluten free flower for my son and his dad ended up eating most of it.  We will be baking this again soon but double next time.

Great recipe, but where are the nuts?? =)  I know, some of us love them, others don't!  The bread was great, but next time I'll skip the advice of adding cinnamon - it gave the flavor of cinnamon red hot candies, which I don't care for.

Excellent! I only had 2 bananas so I used 1 cup of sweetened applesauce, no margarine. I added quite a bit of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, and about 2/3 cup pecans. So good- a bit of sweet crunch on the crust and moist and soft on the inside. Best recipe I've made!

I wanted to make a healthy snack for my 18 month old son, so I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar to sweeten the bread, and replaced 1 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 1/2 cup of Salba, which is made from a ground seed and is a whole food. I threw in 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract, some walnuts that I had in the pantry and a handful of chocolate chips for good measure, and he loves it! Really yummy, and healthy too!

this is the same recipe my mom uses except she uses 1/2 cup milk in hers and another 1/2 cup sugar.  It is wonderful.  Perhaps the milk makes the bread even more moist???!!! I did see where one person thought it was too dry. Oh well got to stick with my mom!

I Loved this recipe and so did all my family and friends who tried it. I followed other reviews and made it with half brown sugar and half white sugar i also added about half a cup of chocolate chips. I made two loaves both were gone by the next day. I found that in other reviews it said to bake them only 45 minutes, i tried that and my loaves were raw in the middle. I baked them for 60 minutes and they were perfect. very yummy thanx for the recipe.

Super easy recipe, turns out fantastic!! I made them into muffins-used brown sugar instead of white (1 1/2 cups vs 2-did double batch), nutmeg and honey. SOO GOOD!!!

These are wonderful.  I made them into muffins and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar for a sweet crunch.

This is great banana bread! I had one old banana in the house so thought I'd use it somehow, and I found this recipe. I wanted something fast and simple. This is both. Since the one banana didn't come to quite a cup, I added chunky applesauce. The bread is  delicious! (I did find I didn't have to cook it quite as long as specified. I tested it at 40 minutes and took it out as it was done.) I will use this again and try some other variations.

Very good, very easy...just not sure I would call it the BEST.  I think it was a little dry, but maybe the bananas I used weren't ripe enough?  I will keep this recipe on the back burner and see if I can't find another that is a bit more moist.

I chose to make muffins out of the dough as I had no pan available to bake the whole bread in. They turned out great!
In the end I had about 14 quite big muffins that were moist, had a nice texture and a good banana taste.
Also, I found the recipe extremely easy to follow and will definitely make it again - maybe this time as a bread! =)

This is the easiest recipe ever! Tastes great and did not take as long to cook it as recipe states.  Instead of measuring bananas, I just put 3 soft bananas in it. Also taking advice of some the other people, I put 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla.  Came out great!

Wonderful recipe! So simple and very tasty! I also used the modification the others suggested and used half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar, some cinnamon and a bit of salt. I only needed two ripe bananas and the flavor was already very rich ^_^!

This is a very good basic banana bread recipe. What i like about it is that its so easy to add different flavors. Tonight I added vanilla, cinnamon and a bit of freshly grated nutmeg. I also used half white, half brown sugar.  I did not bake a loaf but instead made muffins and they turned out wonderful.

I made this using 2 large leftover bananas I had. Since I didn't feel it was enough I added my daughters gerber freeze dried bananas and a container of applesauce for some extra flavor! I also added some vanilla, nutmeg, and cinammon. I also used self rising flour since I didn't have enough of the regular on hand....turned out very moist and yummy! I did have to put foil on the outer portion of the top crust to prevent over browning but all in all an easy and delicious recipe! I also used butter and 1/2 and 1/2 brown/white sugar. Thanks!

Easy and wonderful!  Moist without being gooey.  I made changes as suggested by others - used butter, 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, added vanilla, out of cinnamon so used nutmeg, 2 very soft and 2 soft bananas then baked for suggested time in lower 1/3 of oven to line top of pan with middle of oven.  My newlywed husband now thinks I'm a genius in the kitchen.  Can't wait for bananas to brown again to try with added ingredients - next chocolate chunks and walnuts.

Seriously, this is just delish!  I made this yesterday and although it took an hour an 20 minutes to bake (not sure why), it was well worth it.  Tastes even better today.  I used half brown sugar, half white sugar, added cinnamon and vanilla as others suggested.  Yum!!  I will make this again and again.

This bread had the perfect flavor for such an easy recipe! I did a couple of things that other users suggested (such as using butter, adding a bit of vanilla, etc.), but the base recipe is perfect to start with. Next time I'm going to try adding dark chocolate or maybe a pinch of nutmeg and cinnimon to make it more wintery.

I have searched for the "perfect" banana
bread recipe for years and this is it.
It is super moist and very easy to make
plus the ingredients you have on hand.

This is the most perfect recipe you can get! So simple and perfect! I use real butter, though and I like to cook mine in a bread loaf pan(8 1/2 X 4 1/2), if you do this it looks like the loafs from the store(but tastes way better), however, I have to turn the oven temp. down to 315-325 degrees and I test it every 5 minuets after 50 minuets in the oven. I make this recipe every week and I wanted to just say thank you because it is so moist simple and as I said before- perfect!

The flavor was really great. I used two small/medium bananas, next time I will opt for 3.  I also did like others and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon (next time I would use more cinnamon).  My loaf was done in close to 50 minutes and was starting to burn on the top.

This banana bread was fine - the fact that it was so easy made up for the average taste. I added cinnamon and used butter, as some of the reviews suggested. It definitely wasn't bad, but I'll keep looking for another banana bread recipe.

I used half regular and half brown sugar; added 1 tsp. vanilla; used 4 over-ripe bananas and sprinkled regular sugar on top for a nice crust. 
It was very moist and delicious. I will certainly use this recipe again.

I'm not so crazy about this banana bread. I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar as suggested by others. The bread turned out quite dense but not as moist as I was expecting. I used 3 very ripe bananas--maybe I should have used more.

Delicious, and so easy!!  I did take the suggestions of other reviewers, and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I used three bananas because that's all I had.  Four bananas would be perfect, I'm sure.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is the second time I have made this recipe but I made it into 5 JUMBO MUFFINS instead of a loaf.
I also made a few alterations to the recipe...
REAL BUTTER
EGG SUBSTITUTE 
SPLENDA BROWN SUGAR BAKING BLEND (1/2c)
all in the same amounts that the recipe called for.
This made moist, dense muffins both times and the boyfriend raved about them.
THANKS SO MUCH!

It was very EASY to fix....as soon as it gets out of the oven we will see how it tastes.
WOW the banana bread is very good. The only thing that would make it better is if I could taste the bananas more.

I love this recipe! I also used half white sugar and half brown. I added some cinnamon, but I think it takes fine without too. Our family favorite addition is chocolate chips. Yum!!

It came out delicious!!! I used about 4 really ripe bananas and had to cook it about 5 minutes more. Seriously good! Next time I'll add some walnuts.

I make this recipe often and to change at times I'll us ALMOND extract - what a
wonderful combination with the bananas.

I also sprinkle French Vanilla Granola lightly over top before baking for 50 mins. and then topping with foil and baking another 5 mins. for a moist bread.   mag

This recipe was awesome!  I made it for my family and it was easy setup and clean up.  The one thing I did differently was that I left the bread in for 45 minutes, instead of 60 and it came out beautifully.  :-)

Oh my gosh, this was absolutely delicious. I'm a terrible cook and I've never made banana bread before, but these turned out great! I also added some cinnamon, a pinch of salt, vanilla, and walnut bits. To make it healthier, I used half brown sugar and also halved the butter, and it still turned out great. Will be making this again, and next time I might try it with half whole wheat flour to make me feel even less guilty about eating them.

This was delicious! My kids hate my baking but loved this. I added a half a bag of chocolate chips and my son eats it for breakfast and dessert. I also used at least 4 very ripe bananas.

This did not live up to its name. I added vanilla and cinnamon (I couldn't imagine how bland it would be without) and it didn't help. My bananas were very ripe and I followed the instructions correctly. It just wasn't any good at all. I even tried a slice slathered with peanut butter but couldn't eat it. I threw my banana bread away and was very disappointed.

Eh. As is, it's Really Really Banana, with nothing else to recommend it. It's a little wetter than I ever want quick bread to be, and it is desperately in need of cinnamon and vanilla.

Absolutely delish!  Lovely moist texture and rich flavor.  I made this using 5 smallish, very ripe bananas that I squished in the skins, 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar, plus added a tsp. of vanilla and a handful of semi-sweet choc.chips.  Made 18 good-sized muffins.  These will be made a lot in my house!  Thank you!

I don't think you can do a whole lot to mess this recipe up.  I was only able to scrounge up 2 bananas & then realized I didn't have a loaf pan!  So, I made 6 muffins out of the batter (which was pretty gooey because of the lack of bananas I'm sure).  Put them in the oven for the recommended time & they came out pretty good.  Still lots of banana flavor!  I will make again but ensure I have the correct items!

I've made this recipe many times for my husband's coworkers--at their repeated request. They love it. I top it off with walnuts for aesthetics and an extra crunch.

Easy enough that my 5 year old could do much of it by herself.  She was so proud- and it tasted so good!

I made a batch of this for my daughter's birthday party and this bread got rave reviews! I added the canned pumpkin and 1 tablespoon of cinamon as others had suggested with just fabulous results. This will be made again!!! Thanks for sharing!

I think this is a basic recipe that is great!  You add your own touches to it. I added 1/2 c of Applesauce, 1/2 c of Sour cream and I doubled the recipe and added chopped walnuts and raisins...It was awesome!  Moist!  Thank you Libby.  I made 3 loaves out of this. Yummy !

The best texture.  I read at least one review saying this was cakeish, but I did not find that at all.  I only had 2 bananas (1 quite ripe, 1 extremely ripe - it came out of the peel like liquid).  I didn't bother to measure the mash, but it gave the bread enough flavour either way.  Next time I'll save up more bananas.
Very nice crunchy crust and moist inside.

Easy tasty recipe but it really needs a little SALT.  It's too bland without it.  

I will make it again, but adding a little salt to really bring out the flavor.

This is a delicious recipe. It's very simple to make. Mine came out with a more cake like texture. I was hoping for something more dense and moist but overall it is very flavorful. Great Recipe.

Yum!  Just made this last night-- everyone's comments helped. Didn't have any vanilla though :(  I used 4 large "pretty black" bananas (~ 2 cups), substituted 1/2 of the butter with applesauce (unsweetened), and added 1/2 cup of walnuts.  Also, it did taste better after chilling overnight in the fridge. So moist and easy-- Thanks!

This really is the best. I've made it twice for work, and each time I got emails raving about it. It is so easy too! I can't wait to try the variations! Just a note - I use 4 nearly black bananas, and I added a pinch each of cinnamon and nutmeg, and a dash of vanilla.

Best I've ever baked. I baked it in a 8x8 inch square pan and it came out with a nice crisp crust.

It isn't too moist or dense and is quite light. I used 3 large bananas but I found this amount a tad too little. (prefer a stronger banana smell). I also added 3/4 C walnuts.

This was fantastic!! I am a terrible cook and have never mastered banana bread. This turned out great! It wasn't hard on top like most of them I have cooked and was very moist. I agree that it tastes even better the next day. Thank you for helping me master it!

I have made this several times and it is always delicious (would have given it 5 stars but I prefer a healthier bread-- I cut the margarine in half and used half whole wheat flour and it was still fabulous tasting).  But sometimes it is heavy and moist and other times more cake-like.  Is that just the result of slightly different cooking times, or is it something else?  Anyone know?

Wonderful recipe, even with a few changes to make the bread healthier!  I used half applesauce, instead of all margarine, and half whole wheat flour.  My bread took about 50 minutes, and did taste much better the next morning after a night in the fridge.  Thanks!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!! i am so impressed with this recipe and with myself. i used 4 very ripe medium bananas which came to about 2 cups mashed and added half a cup of walnuts. It only took about 40 min in my oven on 350 so keep an eye on it. DIVINE!!

This banana bread is awesome.  Makes me reminisce on my childhood baking banana bread with my Nana in her tiny kitchen.    This will definitely be a recipe I'll be baking for many years to come.  Delicious.

(And if mixing by hand, will give you some major biceps!)

Great recipe. Only thing I found was that the center would be a little uncooked if I used  9x5 pan so I am going to try it in a 8x8.Hopefully that should take care of the problem.

My friend made this recipe and it was Great.. and I'm not even a banana bread fan but I Loved this recipe! 

**Tip.. Tastes better cooled. We tried it while still warm and it wasn't great and didn't have enough banana taste but the next morning we tried it and it was wonderful!

This was the 1st time I have ever made banana bread and was surprised it was so simple! I used 3 med. size bananas just starting to get "spotted" and because my oven is fairly new, it cooked in about 43 mins. I made it last nite and had some, but it tasted even better this morning.I will definately use this recipe again.

I haven't made banana bread in eons, so thought this would be a quick and easy recipe to try.  This bread turned out so good, my family is clamering for more.  It's moist, filling, sweet, but not too sweet, and baked beautifully.  I also made one with pumkin filling, that turned out equally good.  I added a little more banana than was called for because I had it, and couldn't see the use of throwing it away.  YUMMY!

Yummy!!!  I added 1t cinnamon and 1t vanilla.  I made these in regular muffin tins and had to cook them at 350 for about 29 minutes.  One batch w/raisins, one w/pecans, one with chocolate chips, and one plain. Excellent!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very dry.
