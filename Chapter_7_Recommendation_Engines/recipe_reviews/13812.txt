This is always "my" dish to make for Thanksgiving. Usually I just wing it, but it was nice to have the proportions done for me- I always forget these guys need an unusually thick white sauce. I used more salt, pepper sauce and nutmeg than called for. I picked this recipe because I've always felt fresh nutmeg was the key to making this dish good and not too bland. Happy turkey day!

They were very good. My husband enjoyed them very much, as did I. I am going to try this dish for Thanksgiving this year as a change of pace.

Easy and tasty. My onions were too big though they were labeled boiling onions....I really should have bought super tiny onions.  A nice warm-the-tummy side dish to go along side your colorful veggies because it is blah-zay white.  Perhaps a sprinkling of parsley or something ....

successful basic recipe for a traditional holiday side dish.  omitting the hot sauce, comes out exactly like my mom made from the recipe her old german auntie gave her.

This recipe is perfect!  I love the flavor just a hint of nutmeg gives.  Perfect dish for our Thanksgiving meal.

Pleasant but not exceptional.  Need to at least triple the spices for a flavorful dish.  Next time I will try to increase the roux as well, because the sauce is a nice texture but does not adhere to the onions.
