I made these this afternoon after making something else for Thanksgiving and having left over coconut and pecans to use. I didn't change a thing about the recipe and they turned out tasty. I think I expected a cookie that didn't flatten out though. I rolled them in balls but they ended up flat. I think maybe I'd put a little more flour in next time to help them be a little drier like shortbread. Also I did not need to grease the pans. The first pan I put in burned on the bottom because of the oil on the pan but the next 2 came out better without greasing. Also it made 36 cookies for me.

I substituted the raisins for Choco-chips. Yum!  I like them, however, they were a little crunchy for my taste!

Two stars due to the fact of recipe confusion. I am confused with the cook time on the top states 10 minutes, the recipe states 25-30. My husband chose this recipe without full review of comments. Had I been aware of this discrepancy I would not have bothered. Hope they turn out okay.

I've been looking for an easy macaroon/cookie recipe that includes coconut, and this is by far the best that I've found. I made these last night and they're almost gone already. Thank you so much for the recipe.
