I wasn't a big fan of this dish. I made the recipe as listed and found that there was too much yeast for as little of breading that is prepared.  My breading grew over the chicken and the marinara sauce until I had made a chicken marinara pocket.  It had the overlying taste of yeast.  Not my favorite recipe.

I was not a fan of this recipe.  It took much longer than 30 minutes to cook, and longer than I thought to prepare.  Making regular chicken parm would've been just as easy and much better tasting.

Pretty good... We didn't use the bottom layer and it took only 20 minutes to make! The kids loved it!

I figured Id try this an see how it is. An was surprised that its very good. Though it requires some tweaking. Using popcorn chicken eliminates the cutting of frozen chicken strips, and putting cheese on before an after the sauce. Also it takes closer to 45min to cook. I had no issues with the breadbase.

The best thing  I ever made!  It is DELICIOUS!  Instead of buying the chicken and doing the chopping, I just got the Tyson chicken breast tenders and just put them in there without chopping it.  I liked it better like that and it saves time!  I give it 2 THUMBS UP!

This was absolutely delicious! I of course added more cheese because you never have enough cheese, but my family devoured this dish, there were no leftovers and it was just as easy to put together as the recipe said it was!

I love this recipe!  The first time I made it I thought it tasted like a restaurant dish.  I have made it with breaded tenders, nuggets, and cut up chicken patties.  By far, I like making it with the chicken patties the best.  I have shared it with all my friends and now they make it regularly and love it as much as I do!  So good and so easy to make!

Dish was okay, not sure if I want to make again or not. The bread batter took a lot longer than 30 minutes to fully cook, by that time the sauce I made had been a little over cooked. However, never hurts to try something once.

Quick, easy and husband liked it. Next time I will skip the breaded chicken and make my own...save on fat.  I think it would be just as good with home-baked chicken.

I didn't care for this recipe. The batter part took much longer than 30 minutes too cook. It tasted okay, but I'd probably never make it again.

I made exactly like the recipe and had no batter issues. I was initially afraid to try the rapid release yeast but it worked out perfect.  I used breast tenders and just lined them up and they were great and softened up nicely in the cooking process.

The first time I made this I only had regular yeast, not the rapid or fast acting so I used pilsbery crecent roll dough.  It turned out pretty good.  I did have maranara so I used vodka sauce and instead of using the frozen chicken I used thin fresh chicken and rolled it in egg and then a mixture of bread crumbs and parmesean cheese and placed on top of the batter (which I ended up making the 2nd time I made this)  I baked an additional 10-15 minutes, it was FABULOUS!!!

Very tasty and filling.  Had no problems with bread.  I thought the reviews on here are a bit harsh considering it is obviously not meant to be gourmet.  Husband and very finacky son loved it.

Made it exactly as stated: my husband ate 2/3 of the pan. I'll definitely be making it again. If I can find popcorn chicken I will use that since it was a pain to chop frozen chicken patties. The only downside for the recipe.

It has potential. I made it following the recipe as is. For my family it had too much bread, too much sauce and was too salty(probably because of the sauce). My advice: cut the bread batter in half along with the sauce. If I make this again, that is what I will do and maybe use chicken that isn't from a package.

very quick and easy recipe, and very good too! its hard for me to plan a meal everynight because my husband and i work nights. so i just popped this in the oven and it was ready when we got home. i made a few changes. instead of using the rapid rise yeast (which i could not find) i used pillsbury italian bread in the can. i rolled it into a ball and spread it out in my pan. i also used popcorn chicken instead of cutting up frozen tenders. it turned out great! i will be using this recipe again!

i made this for my boyfriend and myself, it says six servings, but really only serves three or two without any other courses or sides. I used raw chicken breasts, breaded and pan-fried it myself. MUCH better than using the other stuff. And, I just laid the breasts in there without chopping them up. The way this printed out, there were a few sections of the recipe that weren't in my vision initially. Because of that, I didn't see that I was supposed to add olive oil to the batter. So the bread was kind of flat. I didn't use marinara, I used Paul Newman's Italian Sausage sauce, and i added lots of cheese with my italian seasonings. The top of this was delicious, the bottom, not so much. Mostly because I forgot to add the olive oil. I would make this again. I rarely cook and don't really know how to, and it seemed to make him happy!

This dish was a hit with my picky eaters.  I will make it again but will be sure to cook it MUCH longer as I had to keep putting it back in the oven to further cook the dough.  Next time I will put it in for 45 minutes straight.  I also made and froze my own chicken tenders the day before and they worked nicely and I did not feel like I was serving my children a processed dinner.

This is a great meal for kids to make. One it involves my daughters favorite food (chicken nuggets) and due to the easy prep work she was able to assist me with almost everything. It tasted pretty good too. I'm not a leftover person and I enjoyed the leftovers from this meal.

This was ok, but I don't think we'll try it again. The dough definetly takes longer than 30 mins to cook through- if we make it again, I'd cook the dough part first and sprinkle parm cheese on it first. And instead of using frozen chicken patties- I'll fry up some chicken cutlets in italian bread crumbs, and use less sauce!

Very good. I didn't have breaded cooked chicken (didn't catch that part til I was already proceeding w/recipe anyway), so I used chicken tenderloins that I coated with a Ritz/Cheezit crushed coating. They weren't cooked, just defrosted. Otherwise prepared as directed. I think in the future I will prebake that crust for at least 5 mins; it was good but became a little soggy.

I was more in the mood for Grands Biscuits than a yeast layered crust, so I cut Grands biscuits up into bite sized pieces and baked them with the sauce and cooked chicken. 

This would have been a fantastic dish with that combination of foods, but I forgot that baking the rolls with the sauce would impede their actual baking, and I was hoping for more of a fast fix. As well as, the spaghetti sauce I used, Prego, was too much tomato for my taste.

Next time I make this, I will bake the rolls  separately, then add everything together when completely cooked/baked, and mix.

Looking over, I thought that the recipe had too much yeast. I used one envelope instead and it turned out perfectly. Also, it takes more time but I breaded the chicken breast myself with Italian seasoning and garlic croutons. Delicious.

We really liked this!  I used too much sauce because I accidentally poured it on the dough before.  I also breaded the chicken using a milk/egg/flour and bread crumb mixture before I cooked it.  And my dog stole some of the chicken - so we didn't have the appropriate ratio of dough to chicken, sauce etc.  I am definitely using this recipe again, keeping my dog out of the kitchen and pouring the sauce on LAST!

Delicious and super quick!  I decided to do mine in ramekins to make the portions easier since I was making them for just me.  I used half the recipe in 3 ramekins.  If anyone's using patties, if it helps 2 patties was about about half what was needed.  I mixed the dough in a separate bowl so technically my version wasn't 1 dish, but so worth it.  I think they turned out beautifully and tasted like a chicken parm sandwich on freshly baked bread.  I can see using this same recipe with precooked meatballs also.  Or for a lighter version, the precooked grilled chicken strips with no breading.  This is definitely a keeper!

Thanks to previous reviewers.  I only used 1 package of yeast.  I browned some small chicken breast chunks in olive oil with some salt/pepper/Italian seasoning and added some bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese at the end.  And I baked it for 45 minutes.  Next time I'll add a little more sauce because I used homemade marinara which had chunks of tomatoes in it.  Overall great flavor and my husband liked it and he's a real picky eater.

This recipe is MUCH MUCH easier than the ingredient list would suggest.  This was a good, quick, basic recipe that will be one of my go to in a rush recipes.

This was super simple to make.  I cooked my own chicken however.  The bread is quite yeasty and I kinda think it takes away from the flavor of the sauce. I don't know a lot about baking, so I will have to do some research, but there has to be a way to make the dough without 4 1/2 tsp of yeast.  It did cook up in the 30 min, but my oven was still slightly warm from baking my chicken.  Overall, a really hardy, simple meal.

Super easy to make! We doubled it and took it to a family function and the kids loved it along with the adults. I used the southern style chicken tenders and we topped it with more sauce when it was served...almost like a deep dish chicken pizza!
