This soup was wonderful!!!  I didn't have the processed cheese so I just used cubed sharp cheddar and colby jack.  Did add a little more potatoes and some broccolli.  Didn't have vegie broth so I used four chicken boullion cubes with package directions for broth.  Had on hi for four hours bacause I started kind late.  People who don't like soup liked this!  Goes perfect with the "Italian Soup Bowls" also on this site.  Enjoy!

Took me only 15 min prep time even with the extras I added ( shreadded carrots instead of chopped, broccoli florets, half a handful of green onion, pinch of chili powder, and minced fresh garlic). The flavors blended so well together and made the whole house smell so good during the cold winter. Served it with french bread for dipping and sprinkled shreadded cheddar cheese and parsley on top for garnish with a small side salad. Best of all, the WHOLE family loved it.

I made quite a few changes and ended up with a delicious, hearty soup!  I used salsa con queso instead of the cheese sauce, omitted the celery seed and carrots, and added a can of black beans, about half a package of fresh spinach (chopped up in the blender with the vegetable broth, then added) and 1 c of salsa.  I garnished it with shredded cheddar and a bit of cilantro, and WOW, what a tasty dish!  I feel a lot better about the nutritional value too with the beans and spinach added.  The spiciness of the salsa completely overrode the flavor of spinach.  I will definitely make it over and over.  Thanks for the base recipe!

This was fabulous! I really wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. I have had cheese soups in restaurants, and have always wanted to find that great recipe to make at home, but am always disappointed. I would say this is it! Here are the slight changes I made: 1 can of vegetable broth, double the potatoes, used the Kroger brand jar of processed cheese, added 1 clove minced garlic and I made it on the stovetop. (Since I made it on the stovetop, I sauteed the veggies in a little butter before adding the broth)Oh, I like others, added the creamed corn when I added the cheese. Excellent, thank you!

This was an Ok recipe. Would add the creamed corn at the end of cooking time if I made it again.  I increased the amount of potatoes and cut back a bit on the carrot. Could have used a small amount of sharp cheese with the cheese sauce

Very, very good. I made this for my friends (all non-vegetarians) and they loved it--one in particular who is quite the foodie.   I do have to say, though, that you will need to add a lot of seasoning to give it much zest. As it stands, this recipe is somewhat bland, but it just takes adding generous amounts of salt and pepper to bring it up to speed.

I also added more potoatoes than called for. I found the soup to be a little liquid-y. I would definitely add more veggies next time, maybe brocolli or cauliflower. The cheesy flavor was good.

Good base recipe. Some ideas I liked were, garlic, chicken, broccoli, red bell pepper, green onion, and frozen corn rather than canned corn. Came out excellent, with extra shredded cheese to thicken up! Thanks so much for this recipe.

Yumm!  Husband had three servings of this great soup.  Used only half of the vegetable broth, added broccoli, and used the salsa con queso.  Really, really good!

Great! You could also thicken it up, as the broth is a little thin. Totally filling, as long as you don't mind the calories. ;)

We really enjoyed this recipe! A great soup for a cold winter's evening. I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. With a salad and bread, it was a hearty meal.

I didn't like this at all.  Needed some real cheese, and the corn distorted the flavor of all other vegetables.

i'm not sure why but i think the vegetable broth i used was too salty though i've never had that problem before.  i used cheddar cheese instead of the jarred stuff and it just didn't melt well, it melted chunky. if i were to try this again i would definitely use a low sodium broth and different cheese.

I did this on top of the stove so I could serve something new for lunch. Used fresh celery and chicken broth; added Velveeta and some Cheddar cheese. Served it with hot, crusty French bread.  I recalculated the recipe for half and now I wish I had doubled it. Delicious!

I only gave the original recipe 4 stars, but with a few modifications it is definitely a 5! Instead of processed cheese I used regular colby jack (all I had) and subbed the celery seed for 3 stalks of celery. Delicious!

Great kid-friendly soup, and mom and dad loved it too!  I used some grated cheddar instead of the jarred cheese sauce to make it a bit healthier.

A friend gave me a very similar recipe years ago and it has become a staple on cold, winter nights.  It doesn't take long to make either!  I use Velveeta instead of jar sauce and saute onion, celery, garlic & carrots then add some flour before adding the broth and potatoes.  The flour helps to thicken the soup.  When the potatoes are done, I add the velveeta.  I never used creamed corn, but will try it next time I make it!

This recipe was great.  I scaled the recipe to 3 servings and it fit great in my smaller crockpot.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe except for using Velveeta cheese which was all I had.  I served this with Paprika Onion Bread also found on this website.  Try different kinds of vegetables in this.  I'll be making it again and again.

My husband gave it 2 stars, but I give it 3 because I liked it alright.  Definately a "base" recipe as it will not taste "divine" unless you embelish it with different seasonings.

This was so good and satisfying after a long day at work.  My husband even raved about it. (A devout carnivore)  Thank you, Corwynn!

However, I did find the soup to have too much liquid in it.  I know it's "soup", but I like it a little thicker. (I used 1 can of broth so I will scale that down next time I make this.)

And of course I vote for more potatoes! MMM!

The celery seed made it a little bitter so next time I'll just use chopped sauted celery.  Good basic recipe though.  Will definitely make it again with various veggie additions.

With suggestions from others reviewing this recipe, the soup was excellent. I peeled and quartered 2 large size russett potatoes, peeled and chopped 1 large carrot and placed those in a dutch oven.  I added 1 tsp. of minced garlic and 1/2 tsp of celery seed to the veggies then poured 1 15 oz can chicken stock over all. Covered the pot and brought the contents to a boil on the stove top.  Turned the heat down and let it simmer until veggies were done. I took my hand masher and roughly mashed the veggies -leaving some unmashed. I then stirred in the creamed corn and the salsa con queso and just heated through.  It was excellent. Took less than half an hour from start to finish! If the soup is too thick for you, thin with additional stock or water.

This was sooo great-I added more carrots and a
pinch of cumin and fresh garlic.
I also made on top of stove.
Thanks

No one in my family liked this.  Creamed corn was too sweet to be mixed with processed cheese.

AWESOME!!!  My picky-eater husband even liked it.  I added 3 cloved of fresh, minced garlic, just one can of chicken broth, and some frozen broccoli.  It tasted like restaurant soup!

This was REALLY good! I doubled the veggies and added 3 cloves chopped garlic and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. I dumped it all in the crock pot before work, let it cook for 10 hours and (get this) my husband got home before me and actually called me at work to say how great the whole house smelled. We both thought the flavor was remarkable and it could not have been easier. Don't leave out the celery seed!

I think this recipe might be worth trying on top of the stove but 8 hours in a slow cooker made it unpalatable. The veggies were way overdone, the corn was overpowering, and the taste was simply not very good.

I was really excited to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews.  But I was very, very disappointed.  My husband wasn't a fan either.  Soup was very runny and I didn't like the fake cheese taste at all.

I doubled the vegetables and it was still soupier than I would have liked.  I prefer my soups thicker.  I think next time I'll add triple the potatoes and carrots and throw in a can of whole corn, too.  It's a good base recipe, though.

I did a few of the suggested tweaks--used a little less celery seed than called for, and added a stalk of chopped celery ('cause I like it) and a head of fresh chopped broccoli ('cause I love it!). 

The cooking time sounded far too long to me, so I cooked the veggies and broth on high for about 4 hours, then added the queso, creamed corn, and a package of shredded Monterey Jack, which I hadn't planned to add, but the soup was looking thin, and that thickened it up nicely.

It was delish. Next time I think I'll leave out the potatoes and put in two heads of broccoli.

I made this today, and it was great!  I always add a little more spice to almost every recipe I make, and today I added curry powder to this one.  Other than that, very good!

Hubby liked this one more than I did, but I will probably make it again because I love using my crock pot!  I doubled the carrots & potatoes, threw in a whole onion, celery, and one can of chicken broth.  Next time I will try the processed cheese, I didn't have anything time and just used cubed cheddar & swiss.

the flavor was good.  I'm giving 4 stars because of how easy this is to make.  The next time I make this, I'll do everything except use the cheese stuff.  I'll make a quick cheese sauce and add that.  Also, I'll add just a bit of cayenne--not much just a pinch 

folks don't bother to rate the recipe if you are going to change everything buy the name! you are rating your own recipe!!!!!

This is a very good base recipe. I took the advice of other viewers and doubled the amount of potatoes and also added additional vegetables (celery and broccoli). I omitted the corn as I don't care for it much and added some chicken.  I used sauteed leeks rather than onion and added a bit of garlic.  I probably tripled the amount of pepper as we love it.  Both husband and son thought the broth could have been thicker but I don't like an overly-thick soup and thought it was the ideal consistensy.  All in all, a lovely soup. Thank you Corwynn!

Very good. I used mexican mild spicy cheese.
I added the cream corn last. I also used chicken broth
and added some additional vegtables. It was thinner 
then I expected, next time I will add more cheese.

I think this is a decent start for a good soup but it didn't wow us.   I have leftovers that haven't been touched.  I did not have creamed corn so I added canned corn and I used salsa con queso as another reviewer suggested.  I like the combination of corn, potato and carrots and the kick the salsa con queso gave it.   At the end of the cooking time I mashed the potatoes and carrots a bit in an attempt to thicken it up a little.  The overall taste was ok, but it needed something to liven it up and I'm not a good enough (or experimental) cook to determine what it needed.  My daughter didn't like the corn, my son thought it needed meat.  I will give this one another chance using less broth, a few spices and adding chicken and we'll see what we get.

I hate giving this 4 stars, b/c I did change it, but I think the base of the recipe was good.  I added ham, b/c my husband must have meat with everything.  I also added some diced up zuchinni that I didnt want to waste. I also used 2% velveeta.  Needed some seasoning, so we used garlic, pepper, italian seasoning. It was really good. I am sure it would have been good without any changes.

I really liked this! I made it per the directions except that I added extra carrots and potatoes and 2 cloves of garlic, mainly because they were there than out of any epicurean impulse.  I wish this soup thickened up more - next time I will cut back on the vegetable broth.  Otherwise  delicious!

I wanted this in a hurry so did on cooktop.I used 2 grated carrots,1 small rib of celery - smallish dice, 2 cans (15 oz) chicken broth and 1 can Campbells Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup(undiluted)and 8 oz. shredded cheddar cheese.I also would increase potatoes, I washed & cubed red potatoes, but did not peel.If you want a spicier soup add you own jalapeno or diced green chilies.

I never use processed food so I add fresh cooked corn, a little milk and cubed low fat cheddar cheese instead. Works fine, is healthier as it is lower in fat and sodium.

I used 8 oz. frozen corn instead of canned.  I used a spicy queso salsa for the process cheese.  I thought this turned out great, although it took me a lot longer than 11 hours to cook this.  I had to cook the vegetables for 16 hours in order to get them soft.  Maybe I should have set the crock pot on high.

This was fabulous with a few changes. I used 2 cans of chicken broth, cut up celery, carrots, and about 3 potatoes. I added a pinch of celery seed and some cut up chicken. I also omitted the creamed corn. Cooked on high about 4 1/2 hours then added the jarred cheese, and thickened it with some shredded cheese. It was phenomenal. My husband does not eat veggies and he chowed this down like there was no tomorrow.

I went back to look at the recipe again to see if I missed something.  I was expecting something much more flavorful based on the reviews.  It was bland and tased like processed cheese to me.  And I don't know how truly healthful it is either with all the processed cheese that is in in.  It was easy to prepare, but not even worth what little effort it took to cut up the potatoes and carrots.  Blah.

Sorry but I wasn't very impressed with this soup. It has some good basic ideas but the flavor was not good. I would suggest NOT using the creamed corn. It gave a weird sweet taste and combined with the salty cheese flavor it was nasty.

Great recipe! I made this last night and everyone liked it. I did however double the amount of potatoes and carrots. I will definately make this again, I might add in some celery or another vegetable in addition, next time. Great for chilly fall days.

Yum Yum!  I just used 1 can of veggie broth as others suggested and that worked great.  I used 2 potatoes and 2 carrots.  I also used the Kroger cheese queso and that added a nice spiciness to the soup.  What I really liked about this was that it didn't make so many servings.  So there weren't a ton of leftovers to eat.  Sometimes that's OK!

Awesome soup!  I did make a few tweaks to it though. 

1) instead of Jarred cheese sauce i made cheese sauce (found here and doubled: https://armagazine.com/2UMyYwY) 

2)  added chopped broccoli

it was very filling and I will be making it again

This was good, but next time I will use shredded Cheddar instead of the Cheez Whiz.  I think that would give it a better cheesy flavor.  Made a 2nd time and used 16 oz velveeta and about a cup of shredded cheddar.  Next time I will use more shredded cheddar and us 12 oz. beer for one of the cans of vegetable broth.  I added the creamed corn with the cheese.

Just finished making it with a few tweaks as suggested by others
I used homemade chicken stock and velveeta and some shredded cheddar
A whole onion
Celery and celery seed
Carrots and extra potatoes
I did not use the corn
But did put some shredded zucchini and more shredded carrots in when I put the cheese in 
Would have used broccoli if I had some too
It was so yummy

Great soup! Did add double potatoes & carrots. Used Tostito's salsa con queso cheese in the jar and 1 tsp worcestershire sauce. Cut down on the celery seed to half. Thanks for the recipe, It's a keeper :)

This soup was very average and nothing special unfortunately. After I read the reviews, I see that most of the higher scores changed the recipe by doing many things different or adding things. My husband made this recipe and he followed it to a T and it was average, but nothing special or tasty. I know it's nice to add your own touches to each recipe but following the recipe didn't do it for me this time. We did use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.

This soup turned out very well.  I will definitely make again.  I used a jar of salsa con queso for the cheese sauce.

I really loved this soup after I added a few things.  I had some left over meatloaf that I added, and I added a can of kidney beans, a can of diced tomatoes, and some frozen green beans.  Very good.
