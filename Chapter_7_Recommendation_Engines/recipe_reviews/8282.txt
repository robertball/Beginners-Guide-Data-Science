I am an experienced cook, and here is my review: I followed this recipe to the exact ingredients and directions given. The frosting taste too much like cream cheese and is not stiff enough for frosting a layered cake. It is NOT runny, and will work great on a single layer or cupcakes. However, after frosting my 3-layer cake, I placed my cake in the fridge to allow the frosting to stiffen even more. And, 5 minutes later I opened the fridge door and found my top layer lying in front of the cake plate. For those of you who are questioning if a Red Velvet cake is a chocolate cake, the answer is “yes.” And, this cake is by no means in the chocolate cake category. It just does not taste like chocolate. For ‘just a cake’, it is good. But, not for Red Velvet because, again, it should be a chocolate cake. My suggestion to alter this recipe would be to add some confectioners sugar, vanilla flavor, and a dab of flour to the frosting. As far as the cake itself, I would reduce the eggs to 2 and then add 3 eggs whites, double or triple the cocoa, and cook for 10 minutes longer.

I made this cake for my husband for his birthday, it was phenomenal. I did have to leave it in the oven about 15 minutes extra. And I would definitely sift the cocoa with the flour and add food coloring to butter sugar mix. I have submitted a photo of the cake i made, just click on the picture on the recipe to see the color I acheived following the recipe exactly, if you are going for a deeper red I would add 2-3 times the amount of food coloring. To ice the cake I would make sure you let the white chocolate cool to luke warm because if th icing is to warm you won't be able to work with it. Also to lower the amount of fat I used 8 oz regular cream cheese and 8 oz fat free cream cheese and it tastes great. I have to say i was shocked by the amount of butter in this cake but it tasted sooooo good, we had to give some of it away or we woul dhave been balloons.

I did not care for this recipe.  I made it for a neighborhood block party and ended up throwing it away.  I have found many recipes on here and they were great but, never goofed making one before.  It was like a sponge cake and not very moist.  I guess I should have known when it called for 6 eggs.  I think that made it too heavy.  A waiste of ingredients.

This was hit!
For those of you out there, who like me do not like the flavor or use of food coloring, please keep in mind the original red velvet cake recipe calls for the use of red sugar beets. So taking that as a clue, I put some red sugar beets through the juicer and used that juice instead of the artifical red food coloring. It came out beautifully and super moist!

Another recipe trying to fit 10 lbs. of stuff into a 5-lb. bag. Way too much batter for 3 8-in. pans. The recipe should have asked for 3 9-in. pans, and even then I am not sure the batter would have fit properly. The pans kept dripping, making a mess in the oven. Another matter: in step 1 the recipe specifies 350 F as the oven temperature to be used. In step 5, however, the temperature asked for is 325 F. I used 325 F and ended up having to keep the pans in the oven for about 15 more minutes, at 350 F. other than than that, it did come out well, and was highly liked. Will make it again, but using the 9-in. pans.

I fixed this today for a birthday celebration. I have never made a homemade cake before and never even tasted red velvet cake. Let me tell you this is wonderful!!!! I took other's advice with the coco by putting 4 1/2 Tablespoons with the flour and sifting it together, also used 2 1/2 bottles (2 1/2 ounces) of red food coloring, used 3 9" cake pans, and baking it at 340 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes. It came out perfectly. I think the recipe would be right if the person who posted it had told us to put 1 pan in at a time on 325 for 25 minutes. I bet that is what the recipe should be!!!! We had 6 or 7 Foreign Exchange students from New Zealand, Germany, Columbia, Austria, Switzerland, Australia, and Italy and most laughed and said they all made the comment that they had never seen a red cake and one of them thought the cake was bleeding. It was funny! Everyone raved over the cake. I thought it was wonderful!!!! I made the icing the night before and made sure it was cold...it made it thicker so it wasn't runny! Then after spreading the icing I refrigerated the cake so it the icing wouldn't be too runny! It had a GREAT flavor! It is an EASY cake to make!!! Thank you!

This recipe is great! I bake all the time and if you follow this recipe to a T it turns out great! I do have one advice instead of making three layers I do two 8 inch, 1 smaller like a 6 inch for the top. Then, for the left over cake mix bake in bread pan until done once done let sit until almost cool then crumball for cake toping or to decorate cake it makes it look elegant I like to sprinkle it on the sides and just a small pile on the top! Great cake!!!

Four stars are for the icing, because I didn't use the cake recipe.  I use my grandma's red velvet cake recipe that has been tried and true for decades,and is a little different from this one.  I made it for Christmas last year and have gotten several requests to make it again this year.  I usually make my RV cake with plain cream cheese frosting which is still very good.  But I never got as many compliments as when I used the white chocolate cream cheese frosting from this recipe.

Taking the suggestions of other reviews and adding additional buttermilk and cocoa made this the best.  I've been making this recipe for about 4 years and its alway a little on the dry side.  I took some time to read the reviews when I reprinted my faded copy and to my surprise the cake turned out moist, tender and very chocolaty.  All this time it's been the recipe not me!  The frosting has always been yummy, but on the revised cake, it was absolutely phenomenal.   This is a time consuming recipe but it is well worth it.  I put chopped nuts around the edges and whole pecan halves on top.  It is beautiful and delicious.  Give it a try with 1 & 1/4 c. extra buttermilk and 1 1/2 tbsp extra cocoa.  It makes the difference and the cake is wonderful.

Very good cake, however this recipe needed tweaked just a bit.  It overflowed in 8" pans, so 9" pans would work much better.  Also, I found it needed to bake for a total of 45 minutes.  For the frosting, I used 1 stick of butter and let the cream cheese come to room temp to be nice and soft and manageable.  I added 2 C of confectioner's sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and beat it for several minutes.  This made the frosting really easy to manage.  It allowed it to get firm and keep the cake from sliding.  It turned out very good!  I'll make it again.

As a baker, I have tried several versions of red velvet. While this one was a little too sweet for my taste, our guests LOVED it, claiming it was the BEST CAKE THEY HAVE EVER HAD!!! And, that is saying something. 
I followed the recipe precisely, allowing all of my ingredients to reach room temperature first and first sifting A/P bakers flour. There was nothing "dry" about this cake.

Followed recipie but used 9 inch pans as the vinegar and baking soda combination really elevate this cake. Used double the the amount of cocoa and refridgerated the cake before icing, a trick I learned when I used to decorate cakes. No crumbs get in the icing. Turned out very moist every one loved it!!!

For the icing...
I made a different RV recipe for cupcakes and used the white chocolate icing. Like someone else said make sure all your ingredients are @ room temp before you start.

I too am an experienced (professional, retired) chef.  I love this recipe and from my research about the origins of Red Velvet Cake and why it is red, this recipe is very authentic.  The frosting was no problem.  My guests that had the cake are Southern and very picky about traditional dishes - they loved it.  If they hadn't I would have been sure to know because like I said, they are very picky.

Ah bliss!  This is red velvet cake. Being a southerner (transplant though I may be) It is a delightful cake.  I have been up and down the east coast and across the United States (being Air Force Officer brat myself) I have been in many fine establishments and known many Southern Gentlewomen who have this exact recipe. Except the white chocolate spin on it.  Now while cream cheese frosting may indeed not be "traditional" as tone reviewer put it it is now a new Southern tradition.  As the red devils food cake is known for its tang so is cream cheese which compliments it.  Sometimes newer is better.  This recipe doesn't claim to be old fashion or traditional.  I love a new spin on an old favorite.  I can name at least 300 Southern bakeries that use cream cheese frosting on thier red velvet cake.  Why because I am a aspiring baker who is almost ready to open her own.  I will be using this recipe.  My husband is a Sheriff and his whole dept loved them (with quite a few Southerners in there by the way) They said it brought them back to thier child hood. Also as a note cream cheese has not become traditional until late last century because of refrigeration.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe, great taste.  Few alterations though...  you do NOT need that much food coloring!!!  about .1 to .2 ounces will work!!!  Also cooking time was a lot longer than expected.  Took about 20 minutes longer.  (1000' above sea level and gas oven)

this was my first attempt at a red velvet cake and i as many others have stated followed this recipe to the t and had no problems what so ever. i will the next time use 2 oz of red food color as i want the deepest of red velvet cakes! i haven't tasted the cake yet as i am taking the advice of my dear review freinds who have helped me immeasurably thru the years and will be refrigerating it for a day b-4 decorating and doing the same with the icing recipe which i also followed exactly and refrigerated. the cake texture was perfect as for baking and they fell out of the pans!! as far as i can see for now these layers appear perfect and i will add to this review 2nite when i finish my valentine creation for my employees!! 2/10/09 well i finished this cake last night and it was worth waiting to finish as it was very easy to work with cold.  the cake was perfect in every way and i'm not sure why others had problems? the cake was dense and delicious with just a hint of chocolate flavor. my ignorance of red velvet cakes may come into play here but i as well as those who shared this creation with me enjoyed this cake very much!  my friends and employees like myself are not shy, they would have not hesitated to give a discerning review!! the icing is to die for although it is soft and not so easy for use in decorating unless maybe a small amount of confectioners sugar were to be added to stiffen it up but i wouldn't ruin the taste. one of the nice things with this icing is that it doe

I have grown up with red velvet cake.  My grandmother made it for every special occasion and it was always my birthday request.  However, being a true Southern cook she made the 7 minute frosting, not the cream cheese. My grandmother's recipe calls for only 2 eggs, which makes it lighter, too.

This is a really wonderful cake recipe and is so good my daughter asks for it every year on her birthday. I did make a change. Decrease the butter in the frosting to 1/2 cup and chill after frosting it comes out great. I also put in 6 tbsp of cocoa and the chocolate flavor comes through better.

Wonderful cake "as-is".  I did not add any food coloring.  We are generally trying to avoid artificial ingredients - why intentionally add this to a perfectly good home-made cake?  Thanks for this recipe!

WOW ~ EVERYONE loved this one - it took a little time - but to worth it    I made it for a birthday cake and it was superior to any other red velvet cake I have ever made & I have made quite a few!   Take your time with this one and make sure that you have time for everything to mix - you will be very glad that you did!   enjoy!

Very moist cake! Used 1/2 all-purpose wheat flour, then 1/2 wheat flour. Spinkled cake/frosting with coconut! Everyone loved it!

This was the first cake I had made from scratch.  It turned out amazing!! Super moist and the frosting is the perfect pair.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It became a huge hit with my family & friends. Thank you, Pal, for sharing it with us. =)

This was my 2nd attempt at a red velvet cake.  The first one (different recipe) was WAY too dry and terrible.  This one turned out PERFECT!  I am not an experienced baker, but this was easy to follow and I am keeping it in my recipe box!  I made the frosting, and did not like it at all, so I will stick to the traditional easy to make cream cheese icing.  That is the only reason this got 4 stars from me.

Made this cake Saturday night for Sunday dinner which is always a big deal at my house.  As a child growing up i had an Aunt who always made the Red Velvet Cake for every holiday. I have searched and searched for one as close to hers as i could find and this is it.  This cake was moist and the color was out standing.  This cake was gone by the end of the day.  I take extra time in beating the butter and sugar as well as beating in the eggs one at a time.  The only I did different was I sifted in the coco to make sure i did not lumps. I used a differnet basic cream cheese frosting. Kids commeted it almost was as good as Aunt Celeste's cake.

I did use this recipe but, I made some changes to it 1st I cut my flour and sugar down to 2 cups (made me have less batter & it is enough for 3/9 inch pans or 2/10 inch pans), I added 2 ounces of food coloring, used 4 eggs and seperated the whites(using them last by folding them into the batter), I tripled the amount of cocoa using a sifter that the recipe called for.In the end result; this cake came out a beautiful in color and light as a feather & tastes great. The icing;
I followed the recipe as instructed but I added alittle powered sugar to it and place pecans around the icing.When making this cake try using the adjustments that I made to it and you will not be disappointed with the end result. I WILL BE MAKING THIS CAKE AGAIN FOR MY FAMILY.

This is a great recipe, but much better with the following modifications:
1. Add another cup of milk
2. After creaming the butter and sugar together, mix remaining dry ingredients and set aside. Combine remaining wet ingredients. Add wet and dry mixtures alternately to the butter/sugar keeping an even consistency.
Enjoy, and I hope this helps.

I made this cake for Valentine's Day.  The cake was moist and kept well in the fridge after a few days.  The frosting was different, but a bit too cream-cheesey.  To sweeten, I placed See's Candy Cinnamon hearts all over the cake, and that made it for me.  I would take a hint from others and add some sugar to the frosting, or more white chocolate.  There was frosting left over, but better too much than too little - I was happy to have enough frosting to cover the cake!

I received nothing but rave reviews about this cake!  It is definitely a keeper!  The white chocolate cream cheese icing was a little too cheesey, so I modified it by adding two more ounces of white chocolate, a little vanilla and confectioners sugar.  Next time I will only use one 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of two.

Ingredient amounts are way off.  You can't make a red velvet cake without 2 ounces of food coloring.  There are too many eggs, and too much flour and sugar for the amount of red food coloring.  This cake needs to be vibrant.  For the amount of eggs, flour and sugar, I'd use at least four ounces of food coloring.

I was really disappointed with this cake.  I found it  to have very little flavor- definitely not chocolate, and I agree with the other reviews that said the frosting was too runny for layering.  I didn't really care for the flavor of the frosting either.   I won't make again.

This was a good cake. I agree it was a bit dense, but all in all, I would make it again. I took another person's advice and added vanilla to the frosting and that was a plus.

I tried just the frosting on another red velvet cake recipe.  I refrigerated it overnight to firm it up, but it really was too firm to spread then.  I let it return to almost room temperature, and it spread on the 2-layer cake very nicely.  I used Baker's white chocolate, and the flavor was not as good as I would have liked.  Think the Nestle's white chocolate morsels' flavor would have been a little better.  It had kind of an off flavor, too, and I'm not sure what that was from.  Probably won't try it again, unless I use a different white chocolate.

I made the cake and followed the ingredients exactly.  Tastes great! However, I used three 9 inch pans. Instead of the frosting listed, I used traditional cream cheese with pecans and did a chocolate drizzle with more pecans on top. They LOVED it!

Thank you for this excellent recipe. I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa and used a traditional cream cheese frosting recipe from elsewhere on the site. Just like mom used to (and still does) make!

I was nervous to make this as I am not a cake baker, but I followed the advice of past reviews and did 5 eggs and 1 egg white, then 4 TBL cocoa powder instead of just 3. I baked it in 2 large 9" pans for 35 min. I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe which made a LOT of frosting. I decorated my cake with a cocoa powder snowflake and green and red M&M's around the edge. It looked and tasted SO good I could have danced in my kitchen!

very good cake. even better frosting! just   a few things i would change the next time i make it.  1. do not overcook.  used 2 10x2 inch round pans, and baking it for the said time made it a bit dry. stuck it in the fridge and it became sort of dense. 2. do NOT used salted butter for the frosting!! i used salted butter and it came out too salty, almost chese-like. 3. do not burn white chocolate. i did (forgot to use double boiler in my excitement) and the frosting turned a caramel color because of the burnt chocolate. 4. do not refrigerate frosting. i had so much trouble frosting the cake because it was really sticky.. probably because i burnt the chocolate. but that's my fault already. 5. i quadrupled the cocoa powder since i love chocolate, and 3T just does not seem enough. i'm glad i did. 6. i used powdered food coloring. mixed it into the buttermilk before adding that to the mix. 

otherwise, very good. will make this into cupcakes for valentine giveaways with little heart sprinkles on the top

I wasn't crazy about this cake at all.  
Too dry, and the icing wasn't great either...cream cheese icing doesn't belong on red velvet cake - but I guess if you want an imposter red velvet cake, it'll work.

Very dense, but tasty, pretty cake. I added 2 additional Tbs of cocoa. Delicious frosting. Not exactly what I was looking for in a red velvet cake. Next time will look for a recipe with a more traditional texture.

This is like the best cake ever, or at lest the frosting, though fairly basic it is incredible! The cake it self is so so, It was used to make a wedding cake and there was a big issue with the middle of the cake sinking, but combined with the frosting it's a master piece.

Two attempts were a bust. This did not rise, was not even close to being fluffy.

This was a wonderful cake recipe. I have made it two years in a row for my daughter in law's birthday and she loves it. However I did make one change that really makes it a lot better. I put only half a cup of butter in the frosting. Cream together the cream cheese and add the luke warm melted chocolate and then cream in the butter. Frost the cake and then put it in the refrigerator till the frosting is firm. After that you can let it set out and the frosting stays put.

Overall good recipe but the colour was not ad red as would have Liked and the bake time was not enough next time will bake for at least 5 extra minutes.  Frosting was yummy and very good consistency . Would make again with miner tweaks.

This was my first time eating Red Velvet Cake so I have nothing to compare it too but it was fantastic and I got rave reviews.  I made this as a birthday cake for my boyfriend.  Second round I adjusted the cooking time and made cupcakes.

I followed the recipe to the letter with these exceptions: I sifted the flour and cocoa powder together, blended the food coloring with the creamed butter and sugar, I added the egg yolks one at a time and beat the egg whites until stiff peaks formed then folded them in at the end.  The cake came out very nicely but wasn't very sweet.  I did have to bake it a lot longer than the recipe suggests (about 45 minutes per pan).

Great recipe, I saw some people said it was dry so I doubled the frosting and made sure there was enough between the layers. It got rave reviews. It was even moister the next day.

I have made this countless times for co workers and family, it is my staple cake recipe.  The white chocolate icing is devine (use Lindt chocolate) you could smear that on anything and it will taste great.

I made a double batch of this for a friend's get well party and made a two-layer rectangular cake out of it. A single of the frosting was actually enough to frost both cakes. The flavor was exquisite, and the texture was just wonderful. The frosting was a hit too. Highly recommended.

To those who think a red velvet cake is a chocolate cake has not had a real red velvet cake. The coccoa is only in there to make the cake a darker red. If you want a chocolate cake than make a chocolate cake. I do agree that it has way too much flour.

I MADE THIS CAKE FOR MY FIANCES BIRTHDAY THE OTHER DAY. IT TASTED RATHER DRY. IT WAS MISSING SOMETHING. I THINK IT COULD'VE USED A LITTLE MORE SUGAR. IT WAS SORT OF BLAND AND NOT MOIST ENOUGH. I THINK NEXT TIME I'LL TRY ANOTHER RED VELVET RECIPE. :\

I have been using this recipe for many years - scaled down to fit 2 pans.  When I make it here at home in Switzerland it turns out amazing (although I add more cocoa), but when I made this recipe in Canada, it turned out terrible.  The cake was dry and the icing was horrid.  I don't know what the reason is, but here at home in Switzerland, it has become our "family birthday" cake.  We love it!

This cake is a winner! A couple of things - I added more red food coloring,with only one bottle, it was way too pink.  I like two bottles.  I used cake flour, wow, this makes such a difference in the texture.  I will add more cocoa powder next time, not quite enough chocolate for me.  will make again and again.

Loved this recipe!!!! Cannot believe people have knocked it. I first tasted a red velvet cake in the USA and wanted to try it here in Australia, and the first attempt using a different recipe was SHOCKING!!
This recipe turned out SUPERBLY and I am glad to say that I have since passed it on to ALL the guests at the function (about 70 in all!!!).
WELL DONE on FINALLY getting a recipe that makes sense and is easy to follow!!
(By the way, I put the oven to the first recommended temp and then TURNED DOWN THE OVEN when placing the cake in!!! Didn't take much to realise this!!).

Overall the cake was very good.  It was a little sweet and not chocolaty enough.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made cupcakes (lots of them) and used cake flour instead of all purpose.  
I would definitely recommend this recipe but add more cocoa and reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup.

I dont know why anyone had any complaints about this cake....it is delicious!  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect.  Also, for all of you that skipped the white chocolate/cream cheese frosting...you're missing the best part!  This is my new favorite cake!

Acording to my husband this is the greatest recipe of all time.  He actually wanted me to give it to the bakery that did his groom's cake for our wedding! The only change he has me make is to add more red food dye, I usually use 3 or 4 oz.
GREAT JOB, this is a staple in my house!

This cake was a big disapointment. I made it for Christmas day and was embarased to serve it. The frosting is wonderful (hence the two stars), but the cake was VERY dense, dry, and chewy. I will NOT make this cake again. A big let down after all that work.

This cake is absolutely phenomenal!  I took one of the other reviewers advice and added more cocoa, since I like to taste the chocolate.  I added 4 1/2 tablespoons of cocoa and sifted it with the flour.  I also added more 1/3 cup of red food coloring for a darker red color.  I also used cream cheese frosting instead of the white chocolate.

This is a great recipe for red velvet.  The only thing I changed was adding an extra ounce of food coloring and adding some black walnuts.  My Aunt bakes frequently, but I couldn't catch her to get her recipe. I have to bake when I psyche myself up for it.  It was my first cake from scratch.  It turned out great and is darn near gone 1 day later.  It is nice and moist and it is delicious.  Only difference between it an my Aunt's was probably the feel and texture of the cake.  As long as it tasted the same I am thrilled.  When I read the recipe to my Aunt she told me it called for too many eggs.  Maybe that's what changed the texture.  I don't know I'm just a cook trying to be a baker.

This was soooooo good!!  I cooked it in a bundt pan and it took a LOT longer - probably almost 50-60 minutes in a 325 degree oven.  and also it just about didn't fit in the pan but OH was it worth it!  This is definitely a keeper!  I also took a previous rater's advice and sifted the flour and cocoa together, instead of mixing the cocoa with the red food coloring.  worked out perfectly!

I/we loved the cake, however I feel the cocoa could have been incorporated into the mixture if sifted with the flour instead of added with the butter mixture & food coloring.

I adore this recipe (I've made only the cake part and use a standard cream cheese frosting).  I do mix it more like a traditional cake recipe: combine all dry stuff, combine all liquid, add these alternately to creamed sugar/butter/egg.  That has given me consistently beautiful results several times.  I do like the cake a little bit redder, so when that is wanted, I add more coloring.

This cake is pretty good, moist and yummy!  I love how fluffy it is with the butter and eggs.  I also enjoyed the delicious white chocolate icing to accompany it.

I used this recipe just for the icing. I added 1/2 c of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to make it a little sweeter (kid friendly) and a little thicker for cupcakes.

I used this recipe to make a red velvet cake for the first time. It was very sweet. I love the moistness of the cake and will make again but cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups

First time making red velvet cake.  Decided to make it as cupcakes.  Overcooked the 1st batch.  Not the best red velvet cake I've tasted. I am not sure if that is the recipe or the baker, however.  It seemed to be missing something, but I am not sure what.

With this much cocoa, it is difficult to get a true red color, but the flavor is good. The white chocolate cream cheese frosting is phenomenal and easy to make!

This cake was absolutely fabulous! I made it for my boyfriends 40th birthday party and it got rave reviews. I will definitely make it again. I made it with classic buttercream frosting. It was very moist and delicious. The best red velvet cake I ever had. I added 1/4 cup more buttermilk and 1 1/2 more tsps. of cocoa like the other people who rated it suggested and it was perfect!

This was my first time for making red velvet cake.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 4 Tbsp of cocoa powder as some previous reviewers suggested.  I made cupcakes and adjusted baking time accordingly and they turned out perfect in flavor, density, and texture.  I gave only 4 stars because I didn't use the icing called for so I can't comment, instead I used a simple but wonderful cream cheese icing recipe found on this site

I bundted it and had to raise the cooking time quite a bit. It made my daughters birthday. A week later I was asked to make one for work and it was gone in minutes. To this day people beg me to make it for them. The one different thing I do is to whip the icing til it is almost frothy

To add the vinegar/baking soda mix without lumping, I put a little of the dough into the cup and mixed it all together before adding it all back into the bowl.  It blended quickly and smoothly.  Also, I halved the recipe (bit much for two people), and then cooked it thinner to make the layers.  My husband wanted it to be more moist, and wanted a sweeter frosting.  Cream Cheese is less sweet here, so maybe I'll add some sugar next time.

I made it on Saturday it was gone Sunday night!!! Oh and I replace real sugar with splenda for baking for the cake and used splenda for the frosting if you add a splash of lemon juice it will definitely kill the slight after taste in the frosting. Everyone thought it was delicious. Wonderful for the first time!!!

I baked this cake for a birthday and it was dry and had the texture of a pound cake.  I would not recommend this recipe as the cake is not moist.  This was given a grade by some of the guest and they were not impressed with it.

If you are from south and expecting a red velvet cake like the kind your mama made, this ain't it. Too, too dry. Nice try though, still a tasty cake for those who don't know any better. Good Job!

If you are looking at the picture attached to this recipe and are imaging a fluffy, tasty, and moist red velvet cake, what this recipe will give you is a funky cake -kinda bland in flavor and totally bland in character.  What I got was not reminiscent of a red velvet cake in any sense.  The frosting was nice so you can probably piece that part of the recipe onto a better red velvet cake recipe.

A red velvet cake is NOT a chocolate cake! It is, in fact, a buttermilk cake and there are some recipes that do not even contain the cocoa. Great frosting if it is completely cooled, but I think the cake itself may need some tweaking.

the rating is for the icing, which is UNbelievably good, but was all i made this time around, using my own red velvet recipe for the cake part. 
I took someone's advice and added a bit of confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract to make it a bit more manageable for decorating. I piped the icing onto cupcakes and they were snatched up quickly by my guests! 
I could have eaten the bowl of icing by itself!

WOW!!  I made this into cupcakes for a friends birthday, everyone raved about them.  I did use home made cream cheese frosting though, only because that's what she wanted and it was her birthday.  These were moist and super good, not too too sweet.  I baked the cupcakes at 350 for 22 minutes in reynolds baking cups.

I don't believe the overall rating for this cake is very accurate. Before making the cake, I only read the front page reviews, but if you continue to read others, a great deal of people rated it at 5 stars for the icing alone. The flavor was good; however, I didn't care for the texture at all. It came out DENSE and DRY. I followed the directions, and by the suggestion of other reviewers, used 4 1/2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. I bake quite often and instinctly wanted to make my own adjustments but didn't because this was my first red velvet cake. I made it TWICE thinking I had made a mistake, but the flavor and texture were consistent in both. Very disappointing. My rating is still 3 stars because the flavor was good, it rose nicely, and was fairly easy to frost.

I only used the frosting from the recipe, and did not care for it. If I let the chocolate cool it would start to harden and never incorporated into to frosting smoothly,and way too much buter.

Cake came out pretty dry. Too much batter. White chocolate was undetectable in frosting, and frosting wasn't sweet at all. Will try a different recipe next time.

Wonderful.  I have made this cake twice and realized some mistakes.  The first time I used liquid food coloring which I thought made a nicer color than the gel I used the second time.  The first time I only had one cake pan so I had to cook three different times for 30 minutes each which made an outstanding dense cake.  This last time I was prepared but the cake was over cooked at 40 minutes and came out a bit dry.  The icing ages beautifully.  It was the best on day three in our frig..  It's a keeper recipe.

The taste was ok...but the texture was not ok. I will not be making this cake again. On the plus side though... I made the Cream cheese frosting I recipe from this site and it was FABULOUS. I'll be using that frosting with a different red velvet cake in the future.

This cake turned out perfectly! I used three 9" pans instead of 8", and the layers were perfect. I can't rate the icing, because I burned the white chocolate and had to send someone to the store for some pre-made cream cheese frosting. A word of warning: Do not EVER purchase Duncan Hines cream cheese frosting! It was terrible.

I won't be making this again. I followed the recipe and I used some of the suggestions like doubling the chocolate, cooking it longer, but it did not work for me. The frosting tasted too much like cream cheese. It needed something else.  The cake just didn't have much flavor at all. It was very bland.  I used one of the suggestions to juice a beet and use that for the coloring, but my cake still came out brown looking. It just didn't suit our taste.

I added an extra egg to this recipe and made a batch of cupcakes which were fantastic! This was the most successful scratch cake recipe I've ever made. I filled the cupcakes with the frosting, and made rosettes of frosting on top of the cupcakes. The frosting held the shape of the rosettes very well. This one's a keeper!

Too much batter, ended up throwing some away.  The cake didn't rise as much as I'd like and when it was all said and done it tasted like a "Crazy Cake" without enough chocolate.  6 eggs?  Plus, I had to cook it way longer then the recipe called for. I'll be searching for a different Red Velvet Cake recipe for next time!

I altered the recipe just a little:  instead of 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa - I used 4oz.  Also, used 2cups of buttermilk, 2 tablespoons of vinegar and it turn out great!  Nice color, texture and delicious!

Excellent recipe! I made a few minor changes by sifting the cocoa with the flour, baked for 35 minutes at 340* and used 3-9" pans instead of 8".  I used my regular cream cheese frosting also.  It was delicious, lots of compliments!

Great cake, sorta like a pound cake texture.  Lovely!  Didn't use the suggested frosting though, and added just a little more cocoa...cause i like cocoa.

This is my husband's favorite cake.  This is the recipe I've been looking for.  This cake was dense and moist. I did follow some adjustments from other bakers - 2 bottles of red food color and sifting the cocoa with the flour.

I saw this cake on the Biggest Loser and had to make it. I live in Australia and had never heard of Red Velvet Cake before.
Luckily I chose this recipe, it turned out perfectly. I made 24 cupcakes for my daughters 5th birthday and a square cake for the adults. I cut the cake in half and filled it and covered it with the icing. I followed the ingredients to a T. The cake did not crack at all. I think the secret is not to open the oven door.
Next time I would like it to taste a little more chocolatey, so I'll add more cocoa, but you should have seen the Aussie faces when presented with a red cake ! I think thats half the attraction. I barely had any left. I will make this cake at Christmas this year again. It sure is stunning and well worth the effort.
Thanks.

The 3 stars are for problems I had.  I have been cooking many years & people say I am very good.  Problem: When I made this cake I put it in 8" pans as told.  I thought it looked like too much batter but after checking the recipe again I proceeded.  It overflowed all over my oven.  A huge mess.  So, I remade it using 9" pans.  Perfect.  Also, was there supposed to be powedered sugar in icing?  Totally runny made the way of the recipe.  It might be our high humidity but this was the messy cake I've ever tried to make and of course it was for a special event.  Taste - wonderful!  Esthetics - not so good.

I have been looking for the perfect red velvet cake recipe and this is it.  the only thing I did differently is to make this as cupcakes I bought the foil cupcake liners that do not require a baking pan I used the whole box, that was ok I took the to our luncheon.  The frosting was creamy and smooth and just perfect, a definite keeper

Me and my family loved this recipe! Very rich, very moist, and the icing was amazing. I did find that I had to leave it in the oven for fifteen minutes longer (perhaps due to elevation.) Some mention that their cake was not moist, so i might advise some time in the fridge. I iced the cake shortly after the layers all cooled, and it was in the fridge over night, so there were no problems with that. You will need to add alot more food coloring - try 2 - 3 times as much as the recipe calls for if you want a true red. So good.

I tried this recipe for our weekly office treat. I followed the recipe except I used splenda instead of regular sugar. I must have done something wrong because the cake was not good.I ended up buying something for the office. I was very dissapointed.

Not a good recipe.  I had to cook it longer than stated, so then of course it was dry, and add about a cup of powdered sugar and some vanilla to the icing to have it taste like anything but "greasy".

I have baked many, many cakes from recipes from allrecipes.com, but this is the most disappointing....the icing is great, but the cake is is not..i wonder if the 6 eggs is a mistake...the cake is so dense that it is chewy, a real disappointment after the time and ingredients needed for this cake

The cake was awesome even though it did need more baking time, about 15 to 20 minutes more. The icing I had to tweek because i didn't have enough white chocolate so I subsituted about 2 more cups of confectioners' sugar, it still was not thick enough for me but I will have to work on that some more. GREAT RECIPE!!!!

This cake was really outstanding. I was nervous, because I had never done a red velvet cake before. I baked it in a heart shaped pan for valentines day- it turned out beautifully. I would definately say that 1 oz of red color is plenty! It is an entire bottle- the color was perfect. I used cake flour- which make the texture almost like angel food cake. Wow. I was, however, a tad disappointed by the frosting though- perhaps I did something wrong. When I added the melted white chocolate to the cream cheese and butter, the chocolate started to "clump up", so I had to push the frosting through a fine sieve before I could frost the cake, otherwise, it was chunky. Not quite the texture I was looking for. I think I will use a standard cream cheese frosting next time. The cake though, amazing.

I did not care for this recipe, and I make a lot of cakes from scratch.  The butter made the cake very heavy and dense, with an unpleasant spongy texture.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone...

If you like a buttery frosting - you will love this one!  I made this for Valentine's Day and all of my co-workers LOVED it!  I too had extra frosting left over, but I was glad to have extra than not enough.  Wonderful, wonderful cake!

Don't make the white chocolate cream cheese icing - I did not care for it. I'm really surprised how many people gave the icing a good review. I tend to be forgiving but  there was too much butter and it needed confectioner's sugar or something to combat the strong butter flavor.

I found this recipe on the UK site first. I made it exactly as stated and it turned out as a lovely, light cake. It looks fantastic and tastes even better. My mother had a piece and then insisted I left a wedge of cake behind when I left! I do find though, that the frosting can be a little rich. Pop the cake in the fridge for an hour or so and the chilled icing won't seem quite so rich.

Delish!  I got rave reviews on this cake.  Everyone was amazed to know that I made it from scratch because it was so good it tasted like it had to have come from a box!  I followed the recipe to the t and didn't need any alterations.

I made cup-cakes with this recipe, and they were delicious.  The cake was moist, and the frosting a perfect match.    Frosting Tips:    1. It is VERY sweet -- I loved it, but you may want to go easy on the frosting or use a different frosting recipe for it if you don't have a big sweet tooth.   2.  It will be very soft at first - give it some time to rest in the fridge.  (Not too long; it will harden)   3.  This is plenty of frosting for a 3-layer cake, too much for cupcakes!

what did I do wrong ?! ... first the good news, when finished the cake looked and tasted excellent ... however til then, the most most pain the .... cake I ever did, so thinking I did something wrong , cake didnt rise, but somehow managed to spill over ... all stuck to pans .... when cooled all 3 layers had massive craters in center ..... edges were crusty .... but managed to salvage cake , using lots of extra frosting, LOL ... but as said, when all done, it was excellent ..... I did do 2 substitutions, used raspberry vinegarette instead of reg vinegar ..... and added powdered sugar to frosting . .... why the numerous issues?

Red Velvet cake IS NOT chocolate cake! Adding too muich cocoa would make it impossible to see the red color! Red Velvet is only supposed to have ahint of chocolate flavor. Also, cocoa driies it out. And yes, too many eggs for this recipe. Also, oil should be used - not butter. It's the buttermilk that gives Red Velvet it's distinct flavor.

over the years, i have found that i'm not a very big red velvet cake fan, but this recipe is absolutely stellar. the only thing i would change about these cakes would perhaps be a longer baking time, but other than that, i will use this recipe from now on... thank you! =3

I followed the directions of this recipe exactly, except I made cupcakes instead.  They came out well, but the cake was a little too sweet for me.  Nice moist and spongy texture, though.

I followed this recipe exactly and my cake turned out GREAT!  I had a football mold that I used, so it took a lot longer to bake obviously, so I checked it often.  I used a different icing recipe from this site.  The cake was SUPER moist and d-lish!  Everyone at the party LOVED it.  I made is on Tuesday, iced it on Weds and ate it on Thursday and it was great!  The mold I have is for 10 cups, and this amount was perfect for it.

Excellent cake, not to sweet and the icing was awesome. I went straight by the directions and the only problem I had was the 325 for 25 minutes in the oven, I had to leave it for quite a bit longer. It was the tallest cake I've ever seen and it was a hit at the party !!!!!!

Overall, I liked the recipe. My cake turned out to be good and moist. Everyone enjoyed and commented on how moist it was. I do agree (with other reviews) the cocoa should be doubled. To get a deep red color, I used 1/4 t of Christmas red icing gel. I also added 1/8 c of beet juice.

Very good! Will make it again. I just iced it and had the 1st piece. Next time I will make it 4 layers as each layer rose to full layer height. Icing is good, but I prefer a thicker sweater icing (only think keeping it from 5*).  This is not real sweet, but is very very light and fluffy - not bad, I just have a terrible sweet-tooth! Very easy to make. It's a keeper!

I have made this cake for my son's birthday for many years. He turned 34 July,22 and was out of town on Navy duty. I am making it today because he comes home tonight! It will be in his refrigerator waiting on him! I make it in 4 layers and a double batch of the icing! We prefer it cold from the fridge! It is even delicious straight from the freezer especially the icing. My Mother used to make the same cake but with a Crisco icing, I haven't found that recipe since she passed but nothing beats WHITE CHOCOLATE!!!!!!!

I'm not a fan of red velvet (don't like cream cheese frosting) but I made this for my roommate who had been craving red velvet. He's WAY more talented in the kitchen then I am, so I was a bit nervous, but he LOVED it! I think he especially enjoyed the frosting as it is more than just your average cream cheese frosting. The cake (the part I like) was exactly right for red velvet - choclate, but not too chocolate. I'll definitely keep this on hand for future roommate surprises!

I made this recipe tonight - my first red velvet cake - and it was awesome!  I even forgot to add the vanilla and salt and it was still good.  The frosting was perfect for the cake as well, although I can understand why some people added the powdered sugar to stiffen it up a bit. I used a kitchen aid mixer so I was easily able to get it to "whip cream" consistency. 

I did want to add (similar to other viewers) that with my oven at 325 it took nearly twice as long to bake the cake. Every oven is different of course, so I think next time I'll do 350 for 25 - 30 minutes.

Not a favorite in our house... The cake lacked a certain flavor, it was just too bland for my taste. And the frosting was a little too salty, I don't know why... probably because of the brand of cream cheese I used.

I made this cake for the family for Christmas, and it turned out great!  There were a couple things I changed:  9" pans; 350-degrees; 1 regular cream-cheese and 1 light cream-cheese; green-sugar sprinkles all over.

This is a super "heavy"-eating cake, with all the butter and eggs, so the light cream-cheese helped just a little.  The green-sugar sprinkles with the deep-red cake made for a very beautiful "Christmas"-looking cake.  I'll submit a recipe-photo for reference.

I was unsure how much icing to put between each layer, so it ended up being a little thin, which actually helped to reduce the richness of the cake, but it didn't look as nice.  Sifting all the ingredients helps make the cake lighter.  Also, I THOROUGHLY mixed the cocoa and food-coloring until the mixture was really DEEP-red, then mixed into the batter and the color turned out perfect.  Highly recommended for special occassions, and I will definitely make again.

This didn't work for me. There was way too much batter for the pans. I had to extend the time by about 15-20 minutes. And I did not care for the taste.   This one is not a keeper for me!

My friend and I found the cake to be bland, but w/ this frosting that's ok because otherwise they would have been fighting w/ each other.  I also had to bake it an extra 20-25 minutes.   I chilled the frosting about twenty minutes in the fridge before spreading it since it was so runny, but once I did that it was fine.  I'm not sure I'll make the cake again but I will probably use the frosting again w/ my chocolate cake.

I had thought red velvet cake was supposed to be chocolate-y but I didn't find that to be with this recipe. Kind of disappointed in that. 
I followed directions exactly- aside from that fact that I filled three 8.5" pans (instead of 8" pans). It was still more than enough batter than I needed and I probably should have thrown some out.
I had thought the white chocolate would have been a nice flavour in the frosting but it was really overpowered by the cream cheese.

Overall, it's edible but not something I (or my family members) would make a special request for.

Perhaps the pan size should be 9" pans not 8" but I ended up using 3 - 8" pans and had to cook it for 40-45 minutes.  (Looks like most people who have had success are making cupcakes or sheet cakes...) from the comments others have also had the same problem with the 8" pans.  The batter almost spilled out of the pans. (I added just a touch extra buttermilk but everything else was to the recipe) Tasted ok, could have used just a little more chocolate, The frosting was not sweet at all, I added a generous amount of corn syrup to it and it perked up.

I was surprised to find out that the recipe did not yield too much batter. It was a perfect amount actually. I even added an extra half cup of buttermilk. I did sift the cocoa and flour like everyone said to do as well. I did not use the frosting recipe even though I wish that I had. The only complaint I had was that it  actually turned out to be a BROWN velvet cake instead of red. I didn't have enough food coloring so it was kind of a pink batter. However, after baked, it turned brown...very ugly.

There is something definitely wrong with this recipe.  My wife made it 1st time and it turned out great.  The next two times it turned out horrible.  After looking back throught the reviews it appears that other people are having the same problem with inconsistency.  It's like you don't know what to expect.  I will have to find another recipe.

I don't know.  Something just wasn't right with my attempt at this cake.  I used 4 Tbs of cocoa instead of the 3 the recipe called for and it still did not taste chocolatey.  Barely a hint of chocolate really.  If anyone else tries this recipe, you might consider doubling the cocoa.  The cake had a good consistency though.  I used 2 8.5" (that's what they measured anyway) cake pans and baked the cakes for about 15 minutes longer.  The cream cheese icing was good but VERY sweet.  It was a bit much for my taste.

This is a great recipe. I think that persons who said that there was too much batter didn't realize that the recipe yields THREE 8" cakes. I got 3 lovely cakes. My only error came with the frosting. I left the chocolate in the microwave a bit too long, and it needs to be cooled a bit more than to lukewarm. It became runny. So i put it back in the fridge to chill, then when it was chilled again, I beat it till it got to the right consistency.

The frosting is good. However, I am disappointed with the cake. Maybe it was just because of the good reviews.

this cake is so good, you don't even need the icing.  Very nice and moist just what I was hoping for. I followed others advice and mixed the cocoa with the flour.  I also made it 1/4 cup cocoa, the more chocolate the better. I just couldn't get the red that I was hoping for but turned out great none the less.

I used the converter to have this recipe feed 80 and it came out excellent. Next time though I would probably sift the cocoa in with the flour and add the food coloring by itself as someone else had suggested. The paste was clumpy and too thick. I didn't use the frosting suggested but the cake was a hit!!

A lot of comments said how dry this cake was, and I thought so too, until I frosted and refrigeratored it for a few hours.  The cake was so good I feel I must give it away, for fear of eating the whole thing!

This was my first try at a red velvet cake, and it was great! I made it for my daughter's birthday, and it was the first time I have not thrown leftovers away - our family ate the whole thing.  I sifted the cocoa with the flour, as suggested, and I also used only 3/4 c butter in the icing.  It was perfect, and not too sweet. I have also used the icing recipe on another cake since then - it is very good and so easy to make.

This cake is excellent!  I have used this recipe twice and each time, I get more requests for it.  I don't use the white chocolate in the frosting because it's rich enough without it for our taste.  It's still an awesome cake.

Well, my cake looks beautiful...just like the picture on the front page.  But the taste was just so-so.  Nothing special.  It was a good, basic cake...but definitely didn't "wow" us at all.  The frosting was a huge disappointment...not enough sweetness and the consistency was just "off".  If I ever make this again, I will find another frosting to top the cake.  Everyone in the family had a slice for dessert, but didn't finish their piece and I still have a TON of cake left...just not the kind of thing you want to go back and have a second piece.  Oh well...to each his own.  This was just not the one for us.

I had an order for a red velvet cake, and wanted to try a new recipe and I could not have picked a better one.  I did add 1 oz. more red food coloring, but everything else was perfect.  My customer said the cake was "Divine!".

I did not care for this!  Adding the food coloring to the cocoa powder only made a paste that was nearly impossible to blend well into the batter.  I ended up having to add another ounce of red coloring so that there was some sort of color.  The frosting was not very good either. I then tried it with adding powdered sugar much like a cream cheese frosting with the white chocolate, it was ok.

Wonderful cake recipe, I like to use a bit more cocoa than the recipe says. Eighty six the frosting and replace it with a delicious butter cream or cream cheese and you`ll have a great cake.

This cake turned out fine, but I found it to be off.  The cake itself seemed to lack flavor, and was a bit too dense for my liking.  I also found the frosting to be too rich and not a good complement for the cake.  I can't say it was a bad cake, just not my cup of tea.

This was the first cake I've ever baked from scratch. It was easy to make until I got to the frosting. I was really looking forward to the white chocolate cream cheese because it sounded so good. Since I just started baking, I didn't realize you had to be so delicate with the white chocolate, so of course it burned. I had to resort to another reader's suggestion and use the powdered sugar frosting which turned out great.It was a very tasty cake, everyone loved it. The only thing I would do differently is cut the baking time down a few minutes, as the edges came out a little overdone. Overall a great recipe!

Made this for Christmas and stored in freezer until the 24th. But did a sample of cupcakes and it turned out good. But with my oven on the suggested 325 degrees I checked it and the center was not done in the recommended time. So I kicked it up to 350 to finish 1st 2 layers. On the last layer it was 350  and it cooked to perfection. So for me 350 would be the cook temperature for  approximately  28 to 30 minutes.  I did it with a cream cheese frosting with white chocolate.

I made this cake a few years ago and it was delicious.  I added Peppermint extract to the frosting that made it just perfect for Christmas dinner.  It was a huge hit and I will be making it again this year.

This cake was delicious. It makes  three very nice layers. The only issue i had was that i could have used a little more icing and i would cut the butter back a little bit.  But it made for a beautiful cake

This was my first go at baking a Red Velvet Cake and I used this recipe to the letter. The cake was a success across the board in appearance, taste, and ease of preparation. It was for a birthday dinner and specifically requested so I was a bit nervous. So happy I chose to use this recipe. I did see where someone had noted an issue with icing the cake and I took that into account. After preparing the icing, I placed it in the refrigerator overnight and had no difficulties at all. Otherwise, I do not think the icing would have been stiff enough to apply and adher easily to the cake.

It was a disaster because I did not stick a toothpick in the center to see if toothpick came out clean. After cooling all three cakes dropped in height to fill about half of each pan. It dropped from fluffy to dense cake. I put the driest one on the bottom. Then spread frosting. Then I flipped out the middle layer on top. The bottom of the middle layer became the top of the two layers and the top was partially runny and uncooked. So I put the two layers with cream frosting in the center back into the oven to dry out.       As you know frosting hides a multiple of sins so cake looked half way decent after frosting the top of the two layers and then adding the top layer and frosting whole cake.

It turned out to be a  bit dry, tastes good but dry so next time I recommend people who will try it to add a little bit more buttermilk maybe a cup or cup and a half and 2 teaspoons of baking powder to have that fluffy shape so you'd be able to cut it and put frosting inside. Also add more white chocolate in the frosting and a bit of butter to make it a bit creamer

I had the cake about made and realized I was out of vanilla extract! So I improvised and put most of a large box of sugar free vanilla pudding in it. Had to add some more buttermilk and it made 3  9inch cake pans. This cake was sooo moist and delicious! The puddings going in it the next time I make it too lol.

The cake was a 5 star but the frosting threw me off. I was baking with my friend and when we tasted the finished product of the frosting it tasted to muck like cream cheese. We fixed this just by adding a 1/2 cup of sugar.

The cake is great but I didn’t try the icing.  I use a different one. This cake the first I made it I used a think food coloring and didn’t mail the color. The second time around I iced MCCormicks liquid red. Perfect!!! The taste and color is there. The measurements and heat is great. Has my vote.

This  was a pretty good recipe, but I thought it was a bit on the sweet side.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup. I also had to increase the cooking time by 15 minutes   and cooked it at 340 degrees, which was perfect.  I  only had 2 8-inch pans, so I made cupcakes with the remaining batter  and cooked them for 22 minutes.  I used a standard cream cheese frosting because I don't like white chocolate. I also increased the cocoa powder to 1/4 cup and added an extra 1/4 cup buttermilk.  I think those were good changes.  With my changes, I would make it again.

Great recipe!!!  I just added an additional tablespoon of cocoa powder and baked my layers 35 minutes vs the 25 minutes stated in the original recipe.   I also made  a traditional cream cheese/buttercream type frosting.  ....Definitely keeping this recipe for future use!!!

Yay!!! Red Velvet Cake!!! I can't tell you how many times I've made this and it's Always a show stopper. Frequent requests from the husband,  friends, and family for the particular treat.
DO sift your cocoa with the flour and I add the red dye #4 to the buttermilk. For those that have trouble with the White  Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting, try melting the chocolate in the microwave and leave it there while the butter and cream cheese come to room temp. It stays liquid but cools down nicely so you don't end up with a runny mess. If it's really hot in your kitchen, try placing the mixing bowl in the sink filled with ice water for the blending. It used to do the trick for me when I was living in the Caribbean and baking at 80 plus degrees and 110% humidity. DELICIOUS cake and frosting. Many thanks for such a lovely recipe.

This cake was great! I especially loved the white chocolate icing it was  great to go with the cake! I did however use 1 less egg white as with every cake I make  and this is for  moisture purposes. This cake turned out great, it was a hit for Christmas my family loved it!!!  So moist so full of flavor!

I have used this recipe for years, way before the recipe box was around.  I am out of town without my print out.  Thank goodness I found it again.  This recipe is awesome!  I also make truffles with it.  I crumble the cake and mix in the frosting.  Spoon on a cookie sheet and freeze.  Then I dip them in white chocolate. I keep them frozen.  Thaw just before serving. Greatest hit!

I made this recipe for a friend to congratulate her on being accepted to her dream college. It was a small personal sized cake so I cut the portions in half. I also did not use the included Cream Cheese icing recipe and instead substituted my own. It turned out very well. It wasn't too sweet and everyone loved it. I would recommend reading it through once before you start. There's a sections where mixtures are put together in three separate bowls. It could be confusing if you're not expecting it.

I think the recipe was just okay.  I was questioning the baking temperature of 325 from the beginning.  After the amount of time called for in the recipe, the batter was still very runny.  I had to leave in the oven for an additional 15-20 minutes, which probably attributed to the dryness.  I think if the recipe called for 350 the cake would have been ok.  It just was not moist at all.  I use my own cream cheese/powdered sugar frosting which everyone likes.  No, was not a fan of this recipe.

Great recipe for cake (did not use icing recipe); moist cake, not too heavy as some red velvets tend to be.  Everybody loved it this holiday season.  None to throw out.

I gave it a 4 star rating because of all the changes i had to make to the recipe.. but it turned out amazing! I reduced the sugar and flour to 2 cups each, doubled the cocoa, and baked it at 350F in one 10x14 pan. The only other things I should have done were to double the food coloring, and sift the cocoa with the flour. As far as the icing, I hadn't read the reviews regarding salted butter before I went grocery shopping, so I made it with white chocolate chips, salted butter and lowfat cream cheese. I whipped it well in the mixer, and added 3 tbsp of confectioners sugar. Once it cooled for about 10 minutes in the refrigerator it was good to go!

I had this cake when I lived in the States a few years back (I'm a native European) and I absoultely loved it. So I was excited to find a recipe that didn't call for cake mix. So I made this for me and my sisters birthday and it did taste ok. Very rich though. However it was quite messy to make and terrible to frost. It just crumbeld and there wasn't enough frosting to do the whole cake. I ended up useing whipped cream on the outside. I also had to leave the cake in the oven for about 20 min. more than the recipe called for. However, everyone liked the cake and it did taste fine.

as per many other reviewers, the cooking time/temp was very confusing and it ended up coming out very dry, not what a moist red velvet cake should be.

but the frosting recipe is delicious and i will definitely use that for other recipes!!

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was pretty good.  It was pretty heavy for our taste...but GOOD. I did add a little bit of powdered sugar to the frosting.  It looked great too.  I have posted a pic.

Great cake. The flavor was awesome. It was easy to decorate and was perfect for 3 9in Pans. I took some of the other reviews advice and used 9in pans. I'm using the recipe for my son birhday cake I'm making a guitar and It will be blue or green. I will use this recipe again. The frosting was really rich but it was good. Not a good frosting for piping though.

This recipe was awesome.  I cut back a little on the sugar, about a half cup, and added a little cinnamon.  There was exactly enough batter for three 8" pans and the cakes popped out beautifully.  Thanks for my new red velvet recipe!

I'm not a big fan of Red Velvet cake, but it was requested for a birthday, so I decided to try this recipe.  I used 2 9 1/2 inch round pans instead of 3 8" - no problems, I just reduced the batter slightly.  The icing is wonderful, but the cream cheese can overpowering the taste of the cake, which I didn't think had much by way of flavor anyway.  I think it is a beautiful cake - nice rich red color and the icing is delicious.

I have tried this recipe 2 times so far. Each time it seems to be lacking something, I can't figure it out though. It has great flavor, even a little more chocolaty with pudding instead of the cocoa, but it still comes out flat, not as fluffy and moist as I would like. I love the icing though, its a keeper in my recipe box for sure!

I made cupcakes with this recipe. They were very dense and didn't turn out as moist as I would have expected. The flavor was very floury / buttermilky - not many other flavors came through. The frosting was very liquidy at first, but after it had time to cool all the way, it was a good consistency. Unfortunately, it was not very sweet either - just tasted like straight cream cheese.
Definitely won't make this recipe again.

Very good cake recipe--I've never made or eaten a red velvet cake before this one, so I don't have much to compare it to, but it came out very light and fluffy.  Not too chocolatey and a nice Valentine's Day treat for my friends.  I used a different icing since cream cheese is not available where I live, but I would definitely make the cake again for a festive occasion!

wow! this was a really great recipe for red velvet cake. I dont have much to compare it to, but i thought it was really excellent. I did not use the recipe for frosting. Instead, I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe. All in all, i thought it was very very good. (You just have to ignore the calories and fat... haha!)

I tried this one for Christmas and it was great.  I didn't use the frosting that was used in the recipe. Somehow it didn't look right.  I used confectioners sugar, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla with a little milk depending on how much cream cheese you use.  It was a hit! cbs

It's surprising how many mixed reviews this recipe has received.  My only problem was the baking time.  At 25 minutes my was extremely soupy.  I left it in for almost 20 minutes more.  I've never made this kind of cake from scratch so I was a bit concerned with over baking it.  I took it out maybe a little too early.  the center was undercooked and I had a hard time taking it from the pan.  It didn't look pretty, but it tasted good.  I giggled the whole time I was frosting it so it was fun!!  I liked the frosting.  Maybe some people over melted the white chocolate and it was a tad bitter.  I'll give it another try to see if it works out better next time.

Very Good, I espically Love the Icing. It wasn't to sweet or not to sweet it was just right. And it balanced off with the cake. i made it last night for the first time and i only have one slice left. yeah i also noticed that it need 15 to 20 more minutes but other than that it was good, i also thought about putting powder sugar in it but i don't like it to sweet so i decided against it, but maybe next time i will..

Awesome cake. I might consider a different frosting recipe next time. Like some other reviewers, I found the consistency of the frosting wasn't right as written so I didn't put in the last 1/4 cup of butter and then had to thicken it with about 2 1/2 cups of powerdered sugar. It's totally delicious and perfect for me because I love a super rich frosting, but I could see how it could be too much if you don't have a hyperactive sweet tooth like me. The cake came out perfect and delicious. I added the cocoa and the food coloring separately as some reviewers had suggested and that worked great.

I found that it needed a good 15 more minutes, the cake was "ok".  The icing was far too rich - and believe me I don't think I've ever said that in my life!  Overall was just "ok".

i need to start by saying i am a novice baker.   this recipe was a bit vague for a newby like myself.  after adding the chocolate/vinigar combo, it was very difficult to get the lumps out... a good half hour of mixing and squishing lumps.  but the end result was magnificent.  thanks for the recipe.

Ive always wanted to try to make a red velvet cake and Im SO glad I tried this one.  Its magnificent!  I also added almost double the food coloring, one ounce is just not enough.  I used cake flour and the batter was very smooth.  9 inch pans worked fine for me. The frosting does NOT need a whole cup of butter.  I used about 3/4 cup and still had to add about a whole cup of powdered sugar.  Over all, superb.

Definitely time varies by the pan you cook it in.  I used a 10-cup capacity, heart shaped decorative Wilton pan - worked like a gem, yet I had to cook it much longer closer to 55 minutes.  

I WILL USE THE ICING ON EVERY CAKE I MAKE NOW, FOREVER - it's delectable! It truly "melts in your mouth"  :)

This cake is definate better if you practice it a couple of times. I followed previous advice and added the coco powder seperately from the food colouring and added icing sugar to the frosting (which is an acquired taste, I agree) My only other word of caution would be to make sure that the frosting has cooled down enough before you assemble the finished cake, otherwise you end up with an interestingly lopsided affair! Good conversation piece though.

This cake is a joy to make.  I think it's fun to have on Valentine's Day.
