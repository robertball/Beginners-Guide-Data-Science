What a simple and perfectly refreshing summertime drink this is!  Not only is it delicious but pretty when garnished with fresh raspberries.  These will be a regular fixture poolside.

One of my most favorite summer cocktails. I like this with cranberry lemonade or Newman's Limeade, too. Noms. This is a definite make-a-large-pitcher drink.

I've been making this since college and it's one of my all time favorite summertime cocktails.  It is really good if the vodka is frozen.

Fabulous cocktail that's perfect for those hot summer nights when you need something light and refreshing to cool you down! I used a tall glass filled with ice (a bit more raspberry vodka...) and "Simply Lemonade". Lightly stir, garnish with a slice of lemon, throw in a few raspberries, then add a straw if you like. In no time at all your tastebuds will be in for a treat! This is definitely something you won't be able to keep to yourself, but want to share with friends. Heck you may want to scale it up and make a pitcher of this for your next BBQ - it's that good and that simple to make. Thanks for a great recipe K-Dub!

I really liked this drink!  Fixed for a little get together we had awhile ago and it was a hit!  Very light and refreshing.  This will be a regular in this house.

Best summer time drink! It is delicious, refreshing and light. Nice balance of tart and sweet and perfect for a hot summer evening. Be careful because it is very very smooth and very easy to drink more than you maybe should. My new summertime favorite!

UPDATED: I'VE MADE THIS SEVERAL TIMES SINCE - BUT WITH REAL LEMONADE. I ALSO USE A TAD BIT MORE VODKA TO BE SURE I CAN DETECT THE RASPBERRY FLAVOR. PERFECT! :) This was pretty good, very light and refreshing. Since I am the only "fruit lover" (my fiance is a confirmed fruit hater!), I made this for myself. While grocery shopping today, I saw that Smirnoff vodka was on sale, so I picked some up for the sole purpose of making this (I've been eyeing this drink recipe for a while...). When I got home, I realized that I had only a shot's worth of Minute Maid lemonade left (darn!), but I did have Crystal Light "on the go" lemonade packets in the pantry, so I made an 8 oz. glass and decreased the booz accordingly. I could only taste the Crystal Light!!! My fiance "tried" a sip, and all he could taste was the raspberry flavor (go figure!). I guess time will tell how potent my drink really was :) I WILL try this again (after all, I bought an entire bottle of Smirnoff vodka... lol), but with REAL lemonade, hoping for the best! Thanks for sharing, K-Dub!

We really liked this, although for my personal tastes the ratio was a bit off. I liked it better with 1 oz. vodka, to about 1 C. to 1.5 C. lemonade. My husband is diabetic, so we made with sugar free lemonade and it was great.
