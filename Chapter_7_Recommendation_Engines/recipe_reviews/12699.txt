My husband had one of these pies from Costco and fell in love.  I decided I would try to make it myself and I'm so glad I came across this recipe.  This was the first pie I've ever made.  It was super simple and my husband said this was better than the Costco pie.

This was good and easy to make.  The apple slicing took the longest.  Five apples was WAY too many...I only needed about three medium sized granny smith apples, and the crust was overflowing.  The pie was delicious and disappeared in minutes.

I made this pie for an after church lunch one week, and it didn't turn out at all. After cooking it for as long as the recipe says, the apples were still almost hard, and the caramel turned all soupy. As a result the crust was soggy, and the overall taste was not too good. Hopefully it was just my oven or something, otherwise, I don't see how this won any awards at all -- quick and easy or not. Sorry Sheryl!

I made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I used 1/4 of flour and it was not runny at all. Pair this recipe with the King Arthur Flour pie crust and watch your family and friends weep.

I picked this recipe because I am not a baker but wanted to make something quick and easy for my boyfriend's birthday.  This is his favorite pie.  It didn't go so well.  "Pie Shells" and "Pie Crust" are different, but this said get shells, and they don't come out of the aluminum pan very well and I didn't have a rolling pin and had to use a bottle of wine....you get the picture.  Then it didn't say to PEEL the apples first, and I followed the directions and it came out gross with the peels on...and lastly, it was really soupy.  I won't be making this again.

This was so amazing and easy!  I used a pre-rolled crust and followed all of the directions, except I only used two tablespoons of sugar because I wasn't paying close attention to the directions.  Still, it tasted amazing, even with fat-free caramel dip!  I will totally make this again and again!  It wasn't running at all!

Delicious for the holidays! Since I used whole wheat pastry flour, I left out the 2 tbsp on the crusts. I serve this with cinnamon whipped cream.

I made some apple pies using this recipe and got rave reviews from co-workers who received them as gifts. It was a very quick and easy recipe built for someone on the go or multitasking. I plan to use it again in the future.

Delicious! I used Cortland apples that we picked at our local orchard, and it was just sweet enough without being too much. They were on the small side, and I used about 4 3/4, after the kids got done stealing slices from the bowl. The only real change I made to the recipe is, I didn't have brown sugar on hand so I substituted white sugar along with about a tablespoon of molasses. I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts and added a little milk glaze to the top, and it turned out beautifully! Will definitely be making this again.

I like it very much. It's even good if you add some mango to as well. Also i use half Splenda and half brown sugar to cut down on the sugar content. This is a quick and easy pie that's very tasty!
