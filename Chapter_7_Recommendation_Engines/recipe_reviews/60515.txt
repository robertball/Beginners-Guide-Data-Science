You must spice these up a lot! and then they are delicious. I substituted whole wheat flour instead of regular. I added salt free Tony Sacheres (sp?) and hot sauce. My family really enjoyed these. I also only used cooking spray instead of deep frying these and the cooking time went up to probably 4 minutes per side on pretty high heat. Thanks for this recipe. I will use it again when my okra produces in the garden!

We loved these!  Since we are originally from the North, okra is a somewhat foreign food to me.  So, since I've found that I actually like it, I've been trying to find different ways to use it, and this recipe is great and so easy!  Like the other reviewer, next time, I think I will put some more seasoning in the mix, but the consistency was just right and they have that real "comfort food" taste.  They are great dipped in ranch or hot sauce. Yummy.

These are very good.  I substituted for the salt and pepper, garlic salt and cayenne to add more flavor.

Great recipe, I like the fact that you make them into patties, makes them alot easier to deal with while cooking. Taste is restuarant quality. Will be making these quite often.

I'm not talented at frying what-so-ever.  I burnt the first batch, but the second batch were WONDERFUL. Even my husband who doesn't like okra much enjoyed them!  He rated it an "I would eat this again" which is great!

I seasoned these to taste with some Jalepeno seasoning black pepper and salt, also subsituted 1 fresh squash diced finely for some of the okra. These turned out fantastic.

Great way to use up a lot of Okra! My two-year-old even liked them with a little ketchup. I served them with a spicy french salad dressing and cajun-spiced oven-baked tilapia... yum!

These were pretty tasty.  I did add about 1 tsp of garlic salt and it really enhanced the okra flavor.  Of course, we add that to just about everything!

OK, so I didn't mince the okra.  It was thin sliced.  Maybe that was the problem.  It was like okra hushpuppies.  Maybe I'll try again and put the okra in the food processor, but it would just be easier to bread and fry.

My daughter in law is always making a different predinner snack.  THIS was made the second time, as the bread for the meal of veggies.  Absolutely wonderful and she deserves all the praise she got for finding this simple - divine summer bread/snack.  Make no changes.  It's perfect.

i eliminated the oil to fry in because I "dry fried" my patties.  I used chipotle chili pepper instead of black pepper, and garbanzo bean flour instead of ap flour.  These are great tasting, especially with salsa!

8.2.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/60515/okra-patties/ ... 'Directions seemed "off" so I did what I thought was right:  Combine dry ingredients.  Combine wet ingredients.  I subbed milk for the water. Combined okra & onions.  Added wet to dry, then the vegs.  I actually had a pound of thinly sliced okra (rather than a pound, finely chopped which implies to me that weight included the tops).  With that in mind, it needed more salt - & some cayenne.  When I make again, & I will with okra coming in strong, I'm trying 1 3/4t salt & 1/4t cayenne in with the flour.  My recipe for cayenne salt: 1pt cayenne, 3 pts salt.  Good to know if you've got kids who aren't so daring.  Mine made about a dozen goodsized babies - done in half inch of oil for about 5 minutes on each side.  Thanks for the recipe!

Okra patties are a very southern food, if you are not from the South then you might want to avoid this dish becasue you could easily make it more difficult  by adding things not needed.  These are a simple and should remain so.  Seasoning needed: sea salt and course ground black pepper. 
Use fresh okra!  I bought a homegrown okra from a local farm, from a mom and pop grocery store and had to double the mixture.  Use a good, course corn meal. If you're looking for a low fat snack, don't try these. Use oil, preferably peanut oil. You don't have to use too much, just enough to be able to flip them over but keep them cooking. Using cooking spray, these will not taste the same. As a southern woman, my grandmother made these as a side for dinner, when I made this recipe (doubled and with fresh okara) they were very close to her recipe. Excellent. Don't forget the sea salt and course ground black pepper. no more seasonings needed to taste like a real okra patty. :) One thing I did differently was the whole wheat flour instead of white...could not taste the difference!

These are wonderful.  Something different and fun.  Much easier than the traditional fried okra. I do agree with lacking in spices.  I thought it needed more salt and pepper

These were good, though I might make them a bit smaller next time.  Will definitely add some extra seasonings for a better depth of flavor. Cayenne, or cajun seasonings, or Old Bay.

I LOVED these! It is kinda difficult to chop the okra so small but next time I will use a food processor. I added extra seasonings but that was all. I like red pepper flakes and garlic powder in addition to what spices this recipe already called for. I will make these again for sure. Thanks!

This was a lovely recipe----truly, and we even loved the patties cold the next day!!!!  I added some southwest spice, onion powder because I did not have enough fresh onion, and not sure what else  . . . Oh, I put some of the okra in a small food prcessor so the textures of the okra would be varied .  .  . we loved it!!!!   thanks for sharing!

Made it. Great base recipe. I added more dry seasoning... Garlic, Onion, red pepper, salt.....a lil more water, and even extra okra(thin sliced some and did some in the food processor). I dropped them by the tablespoonfuls in to a cast iron skillet with maybe 3/4 cup of cooking oil. Once the bottom was brown I flipped it and flattened it to make sure the okra was cooked through. 
Everyone loved it, even my son that swears he HATES okra, loved it.
Next time I'll try freezing them by the spoonfuls, then flattening them in panko, and baking them on parchment, to cut out the grease.

As suggested by others, I spiced these up a bit. I subbed 2 tsp of Tony's Creole Seasoning for the salt, upped the ground pepper to 2 tsp, and added a clove of garlic (pressed). I sautéed them on medium heat (in olive oil) in a cast iron fry pan. They were easy to make and tasted excellent. Even better the next day! Thanks for this recipe!

Great recipe.  Relatively fast prep time; easy to make.  My husband loves them.  I don't like okra because of the texture, but even I like these.  I'm adding to my collection of best recipes.

Great idea!  We're more into Tex-Mex, so that might explain why my family didn't happen to care for the bland 'Southern' version (though I typically adore southern cooking).  However, with 1/4 t extra salt, a good bit of garlic, cayenne, and chili powder, these were very good (reminded us of hush puppies somewhat).  My husband actually loved them, especially topped with salsa verde - and he's not quick to like okra just any ol' way.  He doesn't even often like fried okra.  ---  We had several leftover patties the next time that we had okra from our garden.  I chopped both the okra (sliced as for fried okra) and the leftover patties, and sauteed them together.  After the okra was no longer stringing off any goo, I sprinkled on a bit of lemon juice, and continued to saute for a bit.  The result was like a simplified version of fried okra.  I served them on the side with brown beans and salsa verde (yes, we love salsa verde, but when we run out, regular red salsa is good with beans, I hope that works as well with the okra one of these days - because the leftover pattie/fresh okra hash was amazingly good with the beans and salsa verde).  --  BTW, the first time we made these, I diced them in large *mince*, which was not small enough.  Now I mince them quite small by slicing them very thin and then working my chef's knife as if mincing herbs or garlic.  It takes a little bit of time, but not terribly long, and I personally prefer that to cleaning okra out of any machine.....

I made these exactly following the recipe, and they tasted good. I can see other people's suggestions for adding extra spices being useful too. We served with some hot sauce.
While they were good, they were pretty 'heavy' and I'm not sure if I'd make them again. But then again, I'm not a huge okra fan either.

We had a huge amount of okra to use up so I tried this recipe. Chopping the okra finely is a really tedious and sticky job, so I ended up whizzing them in the food processor. I made these at my moms house. I doubled the recipe and it made LOTS!! Made half as written, and the other half I added some curry powder, garam masala and cumin to it. Let me tell you, it really needed the spices! The first half was good, but a bit bland, hence the four stars. The second one was really good and flavourful. Everyone loved it. THIS one deserved FIVE stars. So IN SHORT, WITHOUT SPICES=4 **, WITH SPICES=5**. THANKS FOR SHARING THIS GREAT RECIPE!

I was looking for a different way of doing okra, and this recipe really fit the bill! I used wayyy less than 3 cups of oil for frying, and I added a little bit of garlic powder. My only complaint was that the patties turned out rather dry (ketchup didn't help). Thanks!

Tasty! You will likely need to season to your taste though... more salt and pepper along with garlic powder, cayenne pepper and paprika seem to do the trick. Will likely use this recipe again in the winter, using frozen okra, to satisfy my cravings. Thanks for sharing!

Good, next time will try with a different seasoning.  Tried garlic and creole respectively and neither really did the trick.  Next time will try something with a little heat!

These were great! My coworkers enjoyed them as well. I added some Creole seasoning to the batter, but I think next time I will spice these up more. Either way, this recipe is a keeper!

Having rarely eaten okra and never cooked it, I was somewhat at a loss when given a bunch of fresh okra.  I decided on this recipe, and as written I would give it a 3 since it was rather bland.  However, it has the potential to be more flavorful with the addition of seasonings as other reviewers suggested, or maybe some Cajun seasoning.  We both thought it needed some dipping sauce and tried spicy ranch and that greatly enhanced them.  The recipe doesn't say how large to make the patties, but since they're referred to as snacks I would imagine they are supposed to be smallish.  If you've never cooked okra, this is an experience because the consistency of the uncooked product is WEIRD!!!

These come out really well when you add some garlic and throw some chopped hot peppers to the mix. Many people I know who think they hate okra love this dish--it's delicious.

This recipe was a little bland for my husband and me, but our 18 month old son LOVES it.  Next time I make it, I'll try adding more easoning, maybe seasoned salt.  I didn't fry them in the 1" of oil the recipe calls for, I just used a bit of oil in the frying pan, so that may have affected the flavor, too.  But I will definitely make it again.

So great! I added Cajun Seasoning to my preference and quartered the okra lengthwise before chopping. I tried to half the recipe, but couldnt use a half an egg. So I must have double the amount of egg  needed. But they held together great and fried up great in vegetable oil on medium heat about 2-3 minutes on each side. Had them with black eyed peas and it was a great dinner! Put them under the broiler the next morning and had them with scrambled eggs...even BETTER!!! So good!

These need a lot of spicing up.  I added red peppers and a garlic clove.  I also substituted the salt and pepper with cayenne, red pepper flakes and southwestern chipotle seasoning.

Made as is, make sure the okra you use is tender and chopped small. Some of the okra out of my garden was tough. Other than that i thought it was an easier way to use up okra.

I cut the flour down to 1/4 cup and increased the cornmeal to 3/4 cup and added a bell pepper to the second batch. They 
they turned out a lot better.

This was a great base recipe...for the two of us I halved the recipe, sautéed the okra and onion in bacon grease first, and substituted about a half cup of Jiffy muffin mix for the cornmeal, flour and baking powder.  I used one egg and substituted about a quarter cup of sour cream for the water.....delicious!!

This is a good recipe, and is very easy.  I love okra this way.  The women in my family have made it for generations.

A variation on this recipe.  Cut-up fresh okra finely, or use frozen, non-breaded.  Place in a saucepan with water to cover, and boil for about ten minutes.  Drain well, and use as the above recipe.  YUMMY!

I used fresh okra and instead of salt I used garlic salt with parsley flaked and some Tony's Creole seasoning along with the pepper. Since it was my first time making it I am going to have to adjust the cooking method to be able to make the okra more tender, in some pieces it was kinda like pulling bones out of the fish you are eating. The taste was great though, I am sure with a couple adjustments this is going to be one of my favorites!

My toddlers both loved this dipped in ketchup, but to my taste it was a 3-star recipe. That said, I think it could be made into a 4 or 5 star recipe if I had formed it into thin patties instead of just slightly flattened spoonfuls. The tastiest part is the crunchy brown exterior, so I think a thinner patty would be better. If I make it again I will also add some garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper.

I really liked the flavor and taste of this recipe.  I am a lover of fried okra, but was looking for something a little more healthy and this was it!  It was a lot of work though, and a bit messy for someone who has never fried anything before.  I will definatly keep this recipe and continue working on my frying skills.  :)

These are good, but I think I prefer just plain fried okra. To be fair, I only thinly sliced the okra, I did not chop.

very good recipe to work with on the fly. I had a 6 or 7 okra that a friend gave to me and just put in enough onion equal to the okra and eyed the rest of the ingredients (+ garlic powder and cajun spice). Also, I didn't finely chop anything. these came out really good! I'm eatting them with sour cream.

Very very good.  My husband and I loved them.  I did cut down on the oil a lot though I used about 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup of canola oil. I think they will be great with cayenne pepper.  Perfect way to use fresh okra!

Pretty good.  I took some liberties with this recipe.  Since I didn't have enough okra, I added some chopped spinach.  I also used egg substitute for the egg and added some cayenne and red pepper flakes for an extra kick.  I also didn't use the veg oil and instead used non-stick cooking spray.  Came out really well.  Sadly I will never make okra again...I had no idea it was SLIMY! Ewww.  Will eat it again, if I can talk someone else into making it for me.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good Lord, these are tasty! I read the raves and thought, "It's just an okra patty... How good could it really be?!" The answer is: Better than I ever could have anticipated. The only changes I made were to add garlic powder and fresh banana peppers. The flavor and texture were both fantastic—I will absolutely make these again.

Definitely a keeper!  I used a little higher proportion of okra, because I needed to use it up.  I added garlic powder and thyme, and that was definitely a nice combo.  This recipe could be used with any vegetable fritter idea.

It looked good, smelled good, tasted bad!  I was disappointed with this one.  I tried to doctor it up, but it just tasted like fried hay!  I had high hopes on this one after reading the other reviews!

This is the best.Try adding a little bit of garlic powder that makes it better.

Had fun with these!  Took to a family reunion and to church potluck and people had to guess what the secret ingredient was after they ate one.  People who said they did not like okra where eating and liking these before they ever knew that they contained okra!
