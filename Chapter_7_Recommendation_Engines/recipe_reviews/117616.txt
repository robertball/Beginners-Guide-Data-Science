This was absolutely delicious!  Tasted so much like summer.  The only change I made was to use cinnamon instead of mace.

I had foolishly bought a number of peaches over a busy weekend intending to make jam, but never got around to it. By Monday those peaches were giving me the stinkeye every time I passed the kitchen. This recipe was a great way to use them up. The crust is delicious, the fruit jells very nicely, and there is just nothing that's not delightful here. Left out the pecans, used nutmeg and cinnamon instead of mace, snuck some whole wheat into the topping. So so good!

This cobbler looks as good as it tastes. The topping browned beautifully, and the fruit retained its shape and color. It had a wonderful sweet/tart flavor and aroma. I didn't have any mace, so I used nutmeg. I also put a little cinnamon in the topping. Very good. I will make this again!

Just wish I had read the recipe and used 5 cups of peaches instead of just 5 peaches!  Otherwise, this was easy to make and very good. Used peaches from our backyard tree and frozen wild blueberries. I prefer to use wild blueberries because I find they are less soupy in recipes.  Didn't have mace so substituted 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  The topping is more biscuit-like (which we prefer) - I placed it on top of the fruit mixture in clumps and it spread beautifully during baking.  Can't wait to make again - a great summer recipe.

Mine didn't turn out so well, and I bake all the time. The top browned nicely, and my toothpick came out clean. After it cooled for a few hours, we dove into it and the topping was all gooey underneath, like pancake batter, and got into the fruit. Not sure about it... but I might try again later.

I've made this twice now, the second time I substitued blackberries instead of the blueberries and added and extra tbs of cornstarch. Like the other reviewer I also did not have mace so I used cinnamon. My Mom said it was the best cobbler she's ever had. It's gone the night I make it! Definatley a summer favorite.

Very good flavor. I used sherry instead of apple juice. Yummy. I didn't give five stars because the topping was kind of sparse rather than nice and thick like some cobblers are. However, I used an extra 1/2 C or so of both peaches and blueberries. If I were to make it again, I would double the doughy topping unless I stuck to strict fruit measurements. Oh, and I used 1/2 tsp. of cinammon and nutmeg instead of mace, as other readers suggested. I would probably add more spice next time, too, because I love cinammon taste on peaches. Still, it was very good and not at all difficult to make.

Absolutely delicious.  Flavors are amazing and it's pretty easy to make.  The one thing I suggest though, is doubling the topping if you like your whole cobbler covered with pastry.  I made it in a 2 qt pyrex and there was only enough topping to cover about half.

Delicious and big hit at our house.  I had some cinnamon-sugar to use up, so I put that in the topping, and it was great.  Altered the peach-blueberry ratio a bit (more berries) and the consistency was still fine.

This was a very simple but yummy recipie. I did add a touch of cinnamon and honey to the topping and drizzle honey over the mixture before cooking.
