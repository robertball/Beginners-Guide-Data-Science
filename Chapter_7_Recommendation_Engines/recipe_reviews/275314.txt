These green beans were absolutely delicious, plus so easy to make! I didn’t have the bacon bits, but I did have regular bacon. I cooked 3 pieces and crumbled that into the slow cooker along with the rest of the ingredients. I tasted these as soon as they were done and they were good; however, I was invited out at the last minute and put them in the refrigerator to be eaten the next day. The next day they had so much more flavor! I guess sitting overnight helped all that flavor to fully develop.

I love an easy “dump” recipe, where you throw all of your ingredients in the pot and “set it and forget it”! A total win on that alone. But the peppers, onions and bacon seal the deal for sure! I was a little concerned that having only butter as the liquid, but it was perfect! I used a garlic pepper seasoning that I had and it was perfect! Thank you for a great recipe!
