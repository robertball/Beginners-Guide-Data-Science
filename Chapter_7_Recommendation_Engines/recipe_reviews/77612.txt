Where do yo find Tasso??  This is my husband's FAVORITE dish that he used to get at a little restaurant in Crowley, LA.  I have made it before with out the Tasso, because I can't find it anywhere.  It's still good, but I think it would be better with the Tasso.

Perhaps you should rename this recipe  Crawfish and Tasso Pasta. Someone forgot to add the shrimp! LOL! It happens.....I can get carried away thinking of other things that I can add to a dish to make it a bit different, then forget about the main ingredient. It's all good though. I presume that 1 pound of shrimp is needed in this recipe in lieu of the crawfish. I made this dish last night using the crawfish and it was absolutely delish! Creamy, smoky, a bit spicy. My kind of dish.

I found this recipe after looking for something to do with some leftover Tasso I had from a recent trip home to New Orleans. This was soooo friggin' good!!! I didn't have any crawfish so I went with only the shrimp, but I'll be making this for my next dinner party and when my family comes to visit!

This was a great recipe and very easy to make.  If you don't like spicy I would use less tasso or just plain ham.  Otherwise it was delicious - thanks for sharing it.

Really liked this! Used a package of diced ham instead of Tasso and added a couple of drops of liquid smoke. Hubby loved it and left overs were great too/

I received my first "awesome" from our 16-yr-old and my husband was in raptures.  I followed the recipe except for a few 'availability' exchanges.  Red pepper instead of green added some nice color.  Half-n-half instead of cream.  Since i wasn't serving a salad, I added some snow and sugar snap peas.  Again, nice color.  Yum!!

This was really delicious and easy to make.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, and it was just right.  Using real tasso probably did make this recipe stand out.

I double up on all ingredients and go with 3 lbs of shrimp.  It's amazing.   All our guests think it is better than most N.O. restaurant pasta dishes.

The only thing I did differently was add lime juice and red onions. I couldn't find tasso ham. So, I just got another type. LOVED THIS.

We loved this! Had leftover crawfish tails from a boil and used those--didn't have shrimp but still so good. Smelled wonderful! Had to use dried herbs(no fresh in house) but the flavones were still all there. Will definitely make again!

Made this tonight with some gulf shrimp and homemade tasso. I only had dried seasonings, but it still came out great. Will definitely make this again, so thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was easy to make but I didn't have heavy cream so I used coconut milk and it was great!  Made with shrimp.

This recipe was delicious! We got some tasso from my mother-in-law and were searching for a recipe to use it in and found this one. We made it using shrimp instead of crawfish and I only had dry herbs but it worked out just fine. I added a picture to this recipe so people can have a look at how mine turned out as there are no other pictures at the time. We really enjoyed this and will make it again.

Really good.  Used whole milk instead of cream as I didn't have it.
