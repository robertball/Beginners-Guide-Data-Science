Exellent flavor! I  tried 3 different cheeses, blue fcheese in some, cheddar in some and asaigo in most, and then wrapped in half slice of bacon. Make sure you put on a boiler pan so grease can drain. Also, if at 20 min. the bacon is not done enough for your taste, do not just let it bake longer...the cheeses will run out! Instead, broil for the last 5 minutes to crisp up the bacon.WEAR GLOVES & melon baller does an easy job of taken the seeds and veins out. As you are de-seeding them, put the clean ones in a bowel of cold water in the sink. Run clear cold water thru them or rinse and change water. Soak them while you are preparing other ingredients.Take gloves off and discard as soon as you are finished handling the peppers or you could get the hot pepper juice on your cabinet pulls, frig door, pot handle,etc! After assembly, place the whole pan of peppers in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to get the cheeses really cold so they don't ooze out!  UPDATE: To make them faster, after you have the peppers cleaned and soaking in cold water...make little "cigars" of the filling approx. the size of your peppers. Then just place inside the pepper, mash in a bit, stick in freezer to chill. It made filling them go so quick that way...

I have been making a creamcheese, shredded jack cheese and parmesan version of this topped with crumbled bacon for years.  Regardless of what anyone else brings to a potluck, if these are around, they are the first to disappear.  I'm sure the sausage version is just as good, or perhaps even better.

I do have a couple of suggestions:  there are jalapenos and there are jalapenos.  In years past, they all had a lot of heat.  Now it seems to depend on whether they are from an "Americanized" hybrid.  Some of them are not much spicer than a bell pepper.  Also, if you make sure that the chiles are baked to a point of tenderness (cover loosely with foil if they are browning too quickly), much of the heat of the chile is diminished.  

If a hot chile does happen to get you, don't drink water or beer to cut the heat...it won't happen.  Milk is the antedote as it cuts the capsaicin, which is not water soluble but responds to milk, sour cream, etc.

I had rave reviews from a big family - and late arrivals who had to eat them cold were mad that there were none left, but glad they got a taste.  Tips - to make them less greasy - just pile the sausage on paper towels after you cook it!  All that grease gets sucked down and you are fine.  As well, I recommend putting the peppers in the oven (same temp) for about 8 to 10 minutes so they get a bit soft.  And a quick tip for gutting the peppers out - use a small melon baller.  Saves you so much trouble.  Other than that, picture perfect, thanks a mil!

I made these over the weekend for a pool party and they were a hit. During the last few minutes of baking, I topped the peppers with some shredded mozzarella. They were so good even for those that don't like hot stuff. When I received the recipe, I was told to cook them on 350 for 20 minutes. The Jalapenos are just a bit firmer at that temp.

I made 70 of these with spicy turkey sausage for a Thanksgiving Potluck. They were wonderful and the first item emptied. I wore gloves while halving and used a grapefruit spoon to clean out the seeds. I also wrapped each in 1/2 slice of bacon. I cooked them on the broiler pan with aluminum foil on the bottom - not greasy at all and hardly any clean up.  My husband's(and his coworkers) new favorite!

These were really tasty.  Warning, though, they do not save and reheat well so only plan on making what you think you'll eat that night.  Thanks for the recipe!  I think I might use these as a topping for pizza.  :)

I made 4 dozen of these yesterday for a birthday party and every one was eaten and they were looking for more!  Great recipe.  I used Italian sausage - 1/2 sweet and 1/2 hot and low-fat cream cheese and baked them for 25 min.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much.

I used a 4 mix shredded cheese in place of the parmesan, and half hot half sweet bulk sausage.  Surprised me that they needed a bit of salt.  Hot but not too hot, nice flavor.  I like that they can be made in advance, frozen, then cooked, especially because they take a long time to prepare - seeding those peppers is time consuming! Will make again - lovely flavor and satisfying.  If I were a beer drinker, I think these tasty little suckers would call for a cold one.

Great recipe, everyone loved them! Definately makes plenty of filling.  I doubled the recipe and had enough for 3 lbs of jalepenos.  Don't forget to wear those gloves when handling the peppers!

I should say first that my changes to the recipe only cater to true chili heads...it may make normal people cry. This is such a simple recipe, but the flavors are great. I didn't have any parm, but instead substituted organic cheddar. We like things extra spicy so I added 2 tablespoons cayenne to the pork sausage while sauteeing it. I was very willy-nilly with the peppers...left in a lot of ribs and seeds to keep it extra hot. Threw it all in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 degrees. It was great - the bottoms of the peppers were browned and roasted. Everyone who was over here watching the game enjoyed these. Nothin like a snack hot enough to get the snot and tears running!

These have been a big hit every time I made them.  I'm not sure if this has already been mentioned but you should use the tiniest METAL measuring spoon from the set to scrape out the seeds/meat of the pepper.  Your fingers will thank you for it.

I have an outrageous amount of jalapenos from my garden and this was a great way to use some of them up! I made them for my fiancee and his coworkers for a treat and apparently they didn't last more than a few minutes! I managed to eat half of one, to taste test, and they were pretty good (minus putting my delicate taste buds on fire). I have a feeling I will be making these quite often!

These were absolutely wonderful!!! I used a blend of half hot and half sweet Italian sausage; I also used "light" cream cheese with chives. Everyone commented on how good they were and several people asked me for the recipe. The only thing I did wrong was to not make enough!!! I will double it next time. Thanks for a fantastic appetizer recipe!

I wanted to give these a high mark, because I love jalapenos and love filled jalapenos even more. However, these didn't not come through for me. The presentation was good, with a creamy texture with the crisp jalapeno. However, the overall flavor fell short for me. Creative, but not a 5 star.

Made the recipe with only a change to the cheese.  I used a mild fennel and roasted red pepper sausage, and 4 cheese blend ( provolone, asiago, parmesan and romano ) that I buy at Sam's club instead of parmesan. Excellent flavors. Will be making these again.

These were really good! unfortunately my guests were not into spicy, so i did the next best thing, walked them over to my neighbors who do like spicy and they LOVED THEM. I did try this with some Anaheim peppers and it was very good with them too. I have some mini bell peppers in my garden. Next time i am going to make it with the tree types of peppers so people have a choice.

AMAZING! I cooked the cleaned jalapenos for 8 minutes in  425 degree oven, let them cool, then stuffed and baked them.  Also, I substituted Mexican Chorizo sausage for the regular kind.  WOW!!!

This is such an awesome recipe. I like to add roasted garlic to the filling and if I have it on hand, substitute the Parmesan for shredded cheddar and jack cheese

Try these wrapped in puff pastry!!!

Line them up on a baking sheet lined with foil and bake them for 11-12 minutes until nice and golden brown :D It's a delicious little filler and it tastes so good.

Yum yum YUM!  The jalapenos at the store didn't look great, so I used Italian Long Hots instead.  I kept them whole, but sliced them down one side and stuffed them that way.  Everyone loved them!

These are absolutely the BEST! I have used all kinds of sausage with this.... ground chorizo, spicy breakfast sausage, maple sausage and all worked out great! My husband doesn't like cream cheese too much so I cut that in half. I also use Neufchatel to cut back on the fat and calories some. I have taken this dish to lots of parties and even the people who don't think they can stand the spice of jalapenos love these!

These were absolutely awesome!  Had a lot of mixture left after heaping it on all the jalapenos.  Definitely, the larger the jalapenos the better.  A pound and a half jalapenos might be sufficient to not let the mix go to waste and prevent excessive oozing when baking  :)  .

These were a huge hit. Nice and spicy! I used half parm and half sharp cheddar.  Baked at 400 for about 20 minutes.

Best ever. We like them with just a wee bit of crunch. 10 - 12 minutes vs the 20 in the recipe. A melon baller is great to deseed the peppers. And, degrease them by placing the cooked sausage in paper towels. People are disappointed when I don't bring these to gatherings!

These were delicious! After coming out of the oven, they didn't last 10 minutes and I made 60! I added sharp cheese in addition to the other cheeses and crumpled bacon on the top.

Wow....soooo good! I have never made any stuffed fresh jalapenos before...so I was a little nervous....but I love to eat them. I used hot Italian turkey sausage which I cooked and crumbled of the casing with garlic and a little olive oil. I also used low fat cream cheese. Stuffed 16 jalapeno halfs and baked...the last 10 min I topped shredded montery jack cheese. Excellent! Great party food!

I made these this past weekend for a Christmas Open House and they went over very well. I did have someone ask for the recipe for the "appetizer with the green peppers" and she was floored to learn that these were actually jalapeños. Seeding them and then baking takes most of the heat out of them so that they are just spicy instead of fiery.

These are a knockout!  The whole family scarfed them up during half-time. I used half jalapenos and half banana peppers because that is what the garden gave me! I used hot Italian sausage and I am glad I did, otherwise the banana pepper ones wouldn't have had enough heat. What worked for me was placing the filled peppers on parchment paper on a cookie sheet. 400* for about 15-20 min. Perfection and minimal cleanup. The only thing that would have made any improvement would have been a win by those poor Redskins. Give this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed! Update 9/6/11: Be sure to eliminate as much grease as possible after browning the sausage...I remember now that when I made these before, after draining the grease, I blotted the sausage to get rid of more. This time I forgot to do that and they were a bit  greasy, but still excellent!

These are so, so, so good. I could have eaten the entire batch myself. I chilled the filling after I mixed it to make filling them easier. These were eaten more quickly than any other appetizer I've ever made.

Dangerously delicious and too easy to make!
Make sure to wear some gloves when cutting out the seeds or your hands will burn all night as will any bodily parts you make the mistake of touching!

I have made a version of these before.  I used shredded cheddar cheese and added a smidge of ranch dressing seasoning mix to the cream cheese instead of using the dressing.  I also grilled them for about 15 minutes.  I don't know if I chose really small jalepenos or what, but these things had some heat.  I scraped the insides out the best I could.  They were still awesome and were all gone by the time the main course was ready.  We just all had a little tear in our eye after each bite and drink to chase the heat.  Would still make again ;)

These were the first to go at my get-together. You will love these even if you dont normally like spicy food b/c by scraping off the jalapeno seeds, it removes alot of the heat while leaving great flavor. I also used this recipe for stuffed zucchini.

Loved it and they were super simple to prepare.  I opted not to include the ranch dressing and it was still very flavorful...don't feel like anything was missing.  These stuffed jalapeños WILL be added to future party menus. Yummy! Thanks MERLOT_58!!!

These were amazing! I had never made stuffed jalapenos at home before. I found out that gloves are a must when working with a lot of jalapenos ... my hands were on fire when we were done eating them. I used a spoon to scrap the seeds out so I'm sure the extra juice from that didn't help. I only had 4 ounces of cream cheese so I added shredded mozzerella along with the parmesan. I topped some of them with a drizzle of ranch dressing. They were a huge hit with the fam and I have been asked to make them again this week.

HOLY COW...this was sooo good. Usually in the past I've made bacon wrapped jalopenos (also, on Allrecipes.com) and they've always been a hit..very tasty. I saw this recipe and thought it'd be nice to change it up some. So glad I did! This is now my new stand-by for appetizers for watching the football game (GO BLUE!). Made the recipe as is, and used spicy pork sausage.

YUMMY!!  I absolutely love these and so does everyone else when I decide to share and take them as an appetizer to a get-together.  Every time we are invited to something I am asked to make these and they are always the first to go.  They are fantastic with ingredients listed, however I tend to add garlic and/or other spices which we like.  Sometimes I make with sweet Italian sausage or spicy depending on the crowd.  I also usually make half jalapeno peppers and half mini sweet peppers for those who don't like the "bite" of the jalapeno.

Excellent, fabulous, delicious.  I followed directions exactly and had delicious treats in no time.  I wore gloves and soaked the peppers in cold water and  made the mix and chilled it thoroughly before stuffing.  I had no problems with it spilling out of the peppers.  One of my favorite recipes, thanks Merlot_58

Very good and so easy.  Hard to please boyfriend inhaled them!  The only tweak I might make next time is to use a mild sausage in lieu of the hot.  Depending on who I'm serving.  Two thumbs up, even good cold and that's the ultimate test.

Awesome! We used an italian turkey sausage. We also left them whole and stood them upright with a jalepeno grill rack in the oven. Great flavor. It's a keeper!

These were awesome!!! The first time I made this recipe as written, the second time I was looking to do something a little different so I changed it up a bit.  I added cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. I also roasted my peppers for 10 minutes in the oven the chopped them up.  I mixed the peppers inside the mixture and put this inside of wonton wrappers and fried them. It was SOOOO good!

I am an attorney who has little to no time to cook. This recipe is SO QUICK AND EASY, and all of my friends thought I had some sort of "secret recipe" because they were so good! Do not worry about these being too spicy for some! Even my friends who do not like spicy things, and some who just plain hate jalapenos, LOVED THESE! Highly recommend for any appetizer or potluck dish!

These were good but I honestly think they were kind of bland.  The jalapenos don't have much kick when cooked so all I tasted was sausage mixed with cream cheese.  I made them for a party and about 1/2 of them got eaten but people did say they liked them.

*Note to others, do wear gloves when slicing this many jalapenos*

Outstanding!  I picked 18 jalapenos at once from one plant and didn't know what to do with them.  Found this recipe.  It is AWESOME!  It was very easy, didn't take too terribly long to prepare and turned out fantastic.  I stuck some in the freezer.  I imagine they should freeze well.  This would be impressive to serve at a party or family gathering!

I made these for a holiday get-together and my in-laws really liked them. I used spicy sausage and was afraid they might be too hot for everyone's taste, but they turned out great. The cream cheese helps to cool down the spice of the jalapenos. Instead of ranch dressing I use about half of a packet of ranch dressing mix because I prefer the flavor over bottled ranch dressing. Awesome recipe for parties! Just be sure to make plenty!

This is a great and simple recipe, easily 5 stars, however, it is not spicy at all once the jalapeños are seeded. I feel like adding some grated pepperjack cheese and serving with jalapeño ranch sauce is much better than the original. If you like mild -- in my opinion, very mild -- food, then this recipe is fine as is.

I tried this yesterday for Christmas...I do not like spicy, so I did not try it. BUT everyone who did LOVED it. They raved and raved about it! I am making it for New years as well! No one really used the ranch/blue cheese, loved it as is. I did add a little mozarella cheese though. It was a hit! Thank you!

These were awesome! I would leave them in just a little bit longer so they can get crispier but they were very good. They didn't even need the ranch dressing, great on their own.

Awesome! No changes and these came out wonderful.  Not hot at all, but had a good roasted pepper flavor. Great with or without the ranch dressing. And I must admit I had a couple of left over ones straight out of the fridge and they weren't bad at all.

These were absolutely wonderful!  I used reduced fat cream cheese, and because I found I was out of Parmesan cheese, I used mozzarella instead.  And as another reviewer mentioned, I put in some finely chopped green onions and garlic powder.  These were so good, my husband and I ate them for dinner with just some beans on the side.  There was some leftover filling mixture which I heated up the next day and spread on toast.  Yum!  Thanks so much for the recipe, MERLOT_58!

OMG!! These were amazing! I made these for my hubby's bday party and they were a hit! Instead of the sausage, I just cooked up some ground pork and threw in some spices.  Also, I used a pre-shredded mixture of cheese.  Are making them again tonight!  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!! Huge hit at Superbowl party I took them too. Make sure to not breathe in the fumes too much when working with that many Jalapeno's.  I made a double batch and I started to cough a bit, and make sure to where gloves when de-seeding.  Maybe because I de-seeded so many, but finger tips will start to burn a little about an hour or so after you're done.  Made exactly how the recipe stated too.

These were terrific and a very big hit at a party we had.  We doubled the recipe as we were expecting 30 folks, and this ended up with about three broiler trays worth of peppers.  We used hot pork sausage and subbed chihuahua cheese for the parmesan.  We browned the sausage and stuffed the peppers the night before the party and then baked them as guests kept arriving.  We had about half a tray left over which we stuck in the fridge over night.  The next morning, we diced up the remainders and used them in an egg scramble with fresh guacamole for breakfast.  Then for dinner we marinated two tilapia fillets with lime juice, cumin, roasted garlic and cilantro, and sandwiched the diced leftover stuffed peppers between the fillets.  We poached the stuffed fillets in the lime juice marinade inside tin foil for about 20 minutes and served it with mango salsa, guac, lettuce and tortillas for a spin on fish tacos.

HUGE HIT at the party!  I made them just as the recipe says.  No need to pre-bake the peppers.  Didn't even need the Ranch dressing.  May I suggest you wear gloves while cutting/seeding the peppers though.  Will definetely make these again!!!!!

We love this recipe.  We are always asked to bring it to every event we attend.  I also have it at every one of my parties. So yummy!  I make the filling ahead of time and stuff the jalapenos.  Then bake them right before I need them. Oh, I also use light cream cheese and reduced fat flavored sausage.

Stuffed these last night, baked them this morning and brought them to work.  They are almost gone in less than 30 minutes.  Very tasty.  I used Bob Evans Hot & Spicy sausage and a shredded three cheese blend of romano, parmesan, and asiago cheese.

This isa great one! It's easy to make and I am asked to share this recipe by multiple people EVERY time I bring it. Here are some tips for people that don't work w/ peppers much. When cutting so MANY peppers always wear gloves. The oil from the pepper can give you quite a burn on your skin (it took me 3 whole days to get over mine). Also, if you don't want them so spicy, use a paring knife to take out all the white paper like lining inside of the pepper. That's where the heat is. These are not good cold. For parties, I gut the peppers and premake the stuffing. I just stuff them at the party and pop them in the oven. Super important: DONT FORGET THE RANCH DRESSING (I use the chip dip kind).

I grow my own peppers every year and freeze them so I can enjoy stuffed peppers all winter.  I usually use the bacon and cream cheese version.  However, when I made this recipe for an event, they flew out of the pan!  Everyone decided this version was SO much better.  I'll save the other version for the campfire instead.

Great recipe. Alternative: before you put jalapeños in the oven, wrap them in bacon and secure with a toothpick. Bake in oven for about 30mins or until the bacon is cooked. Not a healthy alternative, but anything wrapped in bacon is delicious.

Outstanding!  I did not have the Jalapenos but did have a bag of the small sweet peppers - red, yellow and orange from Costco and used hot and spicy sausage.  Very delicious and easy.  I will definetely add to my favorites list.

This stuffing mix is so good that I've had multiple people ask me for the recipe.  It works in all types of peppers (try banana peppers for a nice kick), as well as mushrooms.

I made these for a dinner party and everyone raved about them, especially the men! They didn't turn out very spicy, so even those who don't like spicy food ate these. So easy to make. The only annoying thing was because of the rounded bottoms, several of the pepper halves wouldn't sit still and kept turning on their sides, causing the filling to ooze out. I'd recommend taking off a very thin slice off the bottoms (a mandolin would work great!) to help them stay put. I also ended up cooking them a bit longer (30mins), but at a lower temp (400*). Otherwise the peppers weren't fully cooked.

These were delicious but were VERY hot even after seeding.  I was surprised.  I took one bite and for someone who loves hot/spicy food, my mouth was on fire.  I almost didn't bring them to the party I was going to but my b/f talked me into it.  The entire plate did get eaten....but no rave reviews.  I use jalapeno a lot so I was surprised this was too much for me...maybe rinsing them before stuffing would have helped reduce the heat.

These are absolutely fabulous! Usually I make recipes from here as directed first, and tweak, if necessary, afterward. However, with this one we didn't have pork sausage, but had hot Italian sausage. We also only had 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese left, so we went with that and a 1/2 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese. We didn’t have Ranch dressing either, but we did have sour cream. Even with these substitutions they went super fast! My husband wanted to try them with adding minced jalapeno, onion and garlic to the cream cheese mixture, and WOW! We have kept the initial changes along with additions, and now serve them with Pico de Gallo salsa and sour cream. There are never any leftovers, and we always make at least a double batch to serve. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These are the best!  I get requests for these all the time and have used for family gatherings, reunions and snacks just for us.  I am growing my own jalapenos which saves a trip to the store.  Maybe we should think about raising some pigs for sausage... just a thought!!!

Excellent!  Taste great!  Don't taste the mix before it's actually cooked, you'll think something is missing.  Once it is cooked, it all comes together!  Gonna make more today!

Absolute hit anywhere I take these! Save any extra sausage mix for a dip on the side. I've also used Pablano peppers when the jalapenos didn't look very good & it made a great side dish rather than appetizer.

These were pretty good! I thought that they could use a little more flavor. Next time I am going to get a flavored cream cheese to add a little twist to it. I used the hot sausage and parmesan cheese. I might change up the cheese too. Overall, the cookout loved them.

Everybody loves these, easier to halve them when cleaning and trying to stuff them (v. whole).  I also put a 1/3 piece of crisped bacon on top

This are always a huge hit! I bake them for an extra 20 minutes so they are crunchy on the top. I also use large green red and yellow peppers with sweet sausage and stuff them for dinner. Yummy!

Made these tonight, added some of the jalapeno seeds and a tablespoon of Worschterschire sauce to the mix.  Drained the sausage in a colander (hot/spicy) and blotted with paper towels.  Cooked for 20 minutes without pre-cooking the jalapeno's.  They were done in no time. I used baking rack in a baking pan with aluminum foil in the bottom to catch drips.  They were fantastic.  Didn't need to pre-cook the Jalapenos or anything.  My husband says they are fantastic and thankfully I bought extra jalapenos' so we will have more tommorow.

Very good, but I would suggest that you use rubber gloves when you remove the jalapeno seeds or your fingers will burn for a couple hours after!

These are great and go quickly! This is my second time making them; both times the only thing I changed was adding a little mozzarella to the mix and sprinkled some on top too, before baking.

These were GREAT!!!  The only thing I did different was I added some grated Mozzarella cheese to the mixture.. I personally wouldn't change a thing on this recipe.. I didn't have any problems with the mixture running while cooking..  I even made omelets the next morning with the left overs..

These were good, my family loved them. However, I thought the sausage overpowered the jalapeno. Next time I'm going to substitute the sausage for some crumbled bacon.

My husband picked this recipe out for his Super Bowl party.  They were amazing!  I am so glad I doubled the recipe.  Everyone raved about them.  I used JD Hot Sausage, but these were still pretty mild.  Also, make sure you really squeeze the grease out of the sausage, or they will be swimming in fat.  It is not enough to drain the fat from the browned sausage, you need to put it between some paper towels and squeeze as much of the grease out as you can.  Also, wear gloves when handling the peppers.  I recommend this recipe very highly.

With some changes, it is def. 5 stars...I doubled this recipe to make approximately 75 peppers for a catering event I did, and it worked out well. I still only used 1 lb of the ground sausage (I used "hot"), omitted the ranch, and substituted about 1/2-1 cup of low fat sour cream, and added 1/4 C each of red and yellow bell peppers, finely chopped. Awesome recipe!  -- A melon baller works wonders to take out the seeds/middle of the peppers!

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.  I've made these 3 times and have not altered the receipe at all except for stuffing some of the leftover stuffing in mushrooms and sweet red peppers.  Mushrooms were not good, red pepper was ok for someone who does not like jalapenos.  My husband can make a meal out of these.  AWESOME.

These are a variation of ABT's (Atomic Buffalo Turds). I cut the top off the jalapeno and hollow it out with my pepper corer. Then I use my Jerky Shooter to fill the peppers. Load it with the filling, stick the nozzle in the pepper and pull the trigger until it is full. It's easy to overfill so take it slow on the trigger. Wrap with bacon and put a toothpick through to hold it. I do them on my smoker at about 275°F with hickory smoke. When the bacon is done so are they. Good eats Maynard! A COLD beer is required.

As with any appetizer based around jalapenos, my guys and I loved them! They are on tap for the AFC playoffs tomorrow (go Jets!) and I will prep them today, refrigerate them overnight, and bake them when needed tomorrow. All I have on hand is sweet sausage today, so I will add some cayenne, dried chipotle or ancho chile powder to bring up the heat. The tip about using a melon baller to easily remove the seeds/membrane is great! I use the smaller end. I do my jalapeno prep inside my cleaned out sink, to prevent the seeds from skittering about (I have a dog and don't want him ingesting any strays seeds). I also specifically buy chubby/wider jalapenos instead of longer/thinner ones so that the jalapenos don't roll over on their sides during the filling/baking process. Yum!

Delicious- I stuffed these the night before and baked them day of, they came out great and were a big hit. They can be messy as the jalapenos get very soft, but they are so yummy!

This is the best!  Yummy!  I thought it would be too spicy but it was not.  Ohh we love it in our house.  for my husband it was not spicy enough.  If it was just for him I would have made it with spicy sasage.  He said it would be better to mix in some of the seeds with the sasage mixture, but i don't think I could handle that.

I have made stuffed peppers for many years. It just never had occurred to me to use jalapeno, or any other, hot pepper.  Thanks for this recipe!  I didn't serve with the Ranch Dressing, as suggested.

These are great!  I like to get some small yellow, red and orange peppers that aren't hot and stuff them along with the jalepenos.  It makes a beautiful presentation and satisfies those people that don't like spicy food.  We don't dip ours in anything but love them just how they are, hot out of the oven.  YUM!

This is such a great appetizer to bring to parties! Everyone thought they were fantastic!

I made a few changes - I used small sweet peppers (red, orange, and yellow) because my supermarket did not have jalapeños. I also used chicken sausage instead of pork. They had a small kick, but without the heat of the jalapeño, they were much less spicy and probably more universally appealing for people who do not like a lot of heat. I used other's suggestion to roll the mixture into small cigar shapes, and this made stuffing the peppers easy and quick. Also, cooked these covered with foil to protect from blackening. 20 minutes at 425 cooked these to perfection. A must-try!

This is perfect party food. I brought a batch to a 4th of July party and none were left. I didn't know how hot the jalapenos would be, so I also added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to the filling mix. They came out at a very good level -- probably almost too hot for some, but the right kick for most. I had a lot of leftover filling that became omelette filling that morning.

I just made this for the husband, and to say the least, he told me it's in his top five favorite things for me to make.  The jalapenos were still crunchy, the stuffing as flavorful, and it was overall delicious.  He's threatening to start watching football and have a Superbowl party just so he can invite over his friends so they can taste these.  Wonderful recipe!  Will have no choice but to make them again!

Absolutely delicious!!  Every time we make them we hear rave reviews!  Everyone asks for the recipe.

My wife loves them with the raw pepper ... without baking them.  The crunch of the cool, crisp pepper with the warm cheesy/sausage mixture is amazing!!  If you haven't tried them that way, you should ... SOOOO good!

Awesome!!  Added a little green onion to the cheese mixture and used an Asiago/Parmesean cheese mixture in the cream cheese with Elk sausage.  Wrapped them in bacon slices.  TO DIE FOR!

This recipe was awesome!  My husband and I love to snack rather than eat a meal, so this was perfect!  I crushed some Ritz crackers and sprinkled over the tops of each pepper to add some texture.  

Great with a bottle of Blackberry/Blueberry wine!

I make these using Italian sausage instead of pork. Also, shredded Italian 3 or 4 cheese blend. My family LOVES them.

I've made these several times and people love them. I also like that every time  you eat one you never know how hot it will be.  I used a turkey sausage with reduced fat cream cheese and a good quality Parmesan cheese.  You don't miss the fat at all!

Greasy but good. I used blue cheese and Monterrey jack. Incorporating bacon might be good. So might some cilantro.

Finally had a chance to make these. They were a hit! We put the cooked sausage in the mixer to break down the bits into very small crumbles. That was key. Next time we're going to cook them on a drying rack or a broiler pan to let the grease drip.

Gosh, I can't believe I took so long to rate this.  Have made this several times, by request.  Yes, its time consuming to stuff the peppers, but I have made the mixture a day ahead, and then stuffed them earlier the same day I am making them.  Everybody loves these!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it is awesome!  It's just the perfect amount of kick.  I was afraid it might be too spicy since I've never cooked a jalapeno before.  If not for the fat content, I probably would've eaten the whole batch all by myself!

I made this for my Husband's Birthday Party last Friday. Based upon the reviews I doubled the batch. I bought exactly 2 lbs. of peppers, which gave me 64 halves. I still had some stuffing left over, which we (the bakers) snacked on with tortilla chips while we finished cooking. This was the hit of the party! They were all gone within the first hour. My Brother and his wife are planning on bringing them to our family Christmas Party. I didn't have 2 cups of shredded parm, I only had 1 1/2, and this still turned out amazing. We did not use ranch, why cover up this perfect pepper? Thank you Merlot! This will be a MUST HAVE at all of our future functions!

Just cleaned out the garden and decided to try this recipe for the freezer. Made a double batch and baked a few to try for lunch.  Headed to the store later for more ingredients for another double (or more) batch tomorrow!!  I used italian sausage, added some garlic and Romano cheese. EXCELLENT!!

Awesome poppers, I grow alot of Jalapenos just to make this receipe all season long. I modified a bit...used red. fat cream cheese and 1/4 cup locatelli then triple the receipe these are excellent cool & I share with everyone. Make 1/2 really hot and 1/2 mild...scrape all the stems and seeds into a bowl add 1/2 your cream cheese mixture to the bowl of stems and seeds thats your really hot version be sure to tooth pick them....no dip is needed once you start you can't stop!

Absolutely fantastic! I've made these 3 times, and they are becoming a constant request- a huge favorite among my family and friends. We like more spice, so I used Hot Italian Sausage instead of regular and I never remember to dip it in Ranch- but its perfect even without. Thanks so much!

These had way more flavor than I thought they would.  I should have made double because they were gone way to fast!  I sprinkled cheese on the top before I put them in. So yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful appetizer that has just the right kick as modified, thanks to all the reviews. Here is what I did: Used a 50-50 mix of sweet and spicy Italian sausage Used an electric mixer to combine the ingredients Shaped the cream cheese mixture into little "footballs" to facilitate stuffing the peppers Froze the cream cheese "footballs" that we didn't use.  You can either set out to thaw or microwave to thaw We noticed no loss of quality due to freezing Used a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon (my smallest)to seed the peppers Microwaved the seeded jalapeno peppers for one minute to soften final product

These are so ridiculously good.  When I first made them I decided that it would be the ONLY time I made them, as they're kind of a pain to seed all of the jalapenos, but once I tasted them, I made them again less than a week later!  I doubled the recipe (highly recommended, as they go very quickly!), and used one hot sausage and one regular.  I wound up just eating the remainder of the filling with a spoon!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful!!!  I wanted to make something new for a get together with friends over the weekend and they all couldn't get enough of them.  Followed the receipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Our friends said that they were a do-over for sure and to make sure I made them for our next gathering.

These are to die for.  I add fresh ground dried ancho chili's to the mix.  These are what everyone looks for me to bring to anything and they are the first thing to go.   Melissa in Ga.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  I just happen to fix these for a last minute idea for a church gathering.  The kitchen help loved them so much, they kept them for themselves!  I took that as a compliment!  Everyone that tries these asks me for the recipe.  It is a MUST to try these!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Sooo good warm, and almost as good when served at room temperature.  I tried stuffing the peppers the night before I needed the dish, and those came out a little greasier/softer than if put together right before you cook them.  Still quite good, but if you don't have to pre-stuff, don't do it.

Very delicious!  I used Aidell's Cajun sausage, lite cream cheese, shredded cheddar, and green onions in my mix. 350 degrees for 20 min was perfect.

I'm one of those anti-heat weenies that can only handle the most mildest of salsas at best (or what my husband calls "tomato juice") but I had a craving for these after a tiny bite at a party (which was followed by lots of soda, bread, and queso). After much research this is what I found: 1) the older the jalepeno, the spicier. The older the jalepeno the more little white flecks on the surface. Buy peppers with the least amount of white flecks. 2) as you seed these run it under cold water, then let them soak in water for about an hour. changing the water frequently.  They had absolutely no heat and I ate a PLATEFUL of these! I also wrapped a few in bacon just to see. It was a little overpowering (and I LOVE bacon). I like the ones without better. They are DELISH!!

Ran out of time to stuff all the peppers so I chopped up the jalapenos and added them to the stuffing.  I carved out the middle of a large zucchini and baked it for 30 minutes at 350 and it was the best stuffed zucchini I have ever eaten!

This is a super LOW CARB recipe that my boyfriend went nuts over and now requests numerous times per week! I did, as usual, add my little tweaks here and there; I used spicy pork sausage (the fennel seeds and hotness really add a nice zing), didn't completely core the peppers to keep some of the heat, added some minced garlic, used both Parmesan and Monterey Jack, threw in a few drops of Habanero hot sauce (what the heck - BF loves the hotter the better), a little S&P, a bit of LiteHouse Ranch Dip, and a few chopped scallions.   Along with the jalapenos, I had some mini red and yellow peppers that I stuffed to use as a buffer from the heat between jalapenos (and for me personally since I'm not a gigantic fan of extremely spicy food). Also... we wrapped them in foil and threw them on the grill with our steaks for about 10 minutes.   YUM-O!

This was wonderful! I didn't stuff a full pound of peppers as there are only 2 of us, so I put the leftover stuffing in the freezer for a later date and it was even better the second time. The second time I had some portabella mushrooms and stuffed them with the stuffing as well as some peppers. I cooked them all in the same pan, all I can say is WOW! These turned out great as well. Thanks for the great recipe.

We love these.  With that said, we have an even more favorite alternative - but got it from a friend.  Instead of always replicating what he did, we wanted to find something a bit different.  While these are good - the other more favorite ARE better.  For those, same thing with the peppers.  In the peppers is a mix of cream cheese, RAW maple sausage and green chiles.  Mix it all together.  Stuff the peppers.  Wrap in bacon and secure with a toothpick.  We then cook these on a rack placed over a jelly roll to help keep the poppers from sitting in the grease.  Cook until bacon is cooked (and sausage will cook faster) at 425 in the oven (or you can cook on the grill, too).  Usually takes about half an hour.  OMG, they are amazing.  Same general thing, just a bit different.

For this recipe, we love the difference that the parmesan makes.  They are just different enough that we usually make both - and everyone always asks for both, too, when we are throwing parties.

These were very good, it was missing the heat, next time I will leave some seeds in to kick them up a bit, I also added about 1/4 cup of ranch dressing to the mixure, before baking. Everyone enjoyed

I agree with the person who said the jalapenos need to be cooked a little first.  They were still pretty crunchy, which I don't really like.  But other than that, they were alright.

These were pretty good.  A little on the spicy side, I must not have gotten all the seeds and white veins out, (although I thought I had done a good job of scraping....  )  Overall a good flavor, the filling is yummy and easy, not so easy to clean out the peppers.

i followed this recipe to the T.  Next time I think i will cook the jalapenos for 10 min before adding the filling and cook it for the recommended time.  I didn't like that they had a bit of a crunch to them.

Made these excactly as instructed.  Came out very nice.  Will fix this again and again.  One note of caution.  Make sure you get all of the seeds as well as the white fleshy matter in the pepper out.  I did on some and not on others and there was a HUGE temperture swing from one to another.

OMG, amazing! I substituted the sausage for chorizo was the only change I made. Hubby loved them and he's not a huge a fan of  poppers. Will definitely make again.  Found my new go to appetizer!

These were a huge hit at our Christmas Eve spread!  Following tips from others, I used a very small metal measuring spoon to scrape out the seeds, and pre-cooked the cut, cleaned peppers for about 8 minutes in the oven before stuffing.  I substituted a 3-cheese Mexican blend for the parmesan, mixed it with the sour cream and sausage, then sprinkled parmesan on top before baking.   I will definitely make these again.

I must have made this recipe 10-12 times already.  I see from other reviews that people will tweek this by using different cheeses, using bacon, etc.  I make it exactly as written and I suggest at least for the first couple of times you do the same; then after a dozen or so times ...... I usually make about two dozen (twelve large jalapeños cut in half). Use large jalapeños or you'll regret it.  Someone, not me, came up with a REALLY good recommendation when it comes to seeding the peppers. USE A MELON BALLER! (Small end) It will save you a LOT of work/time. (Thank you to whoever posted that idea.)  Finally, for those who think that jalapeños are too pungent. Yeah, they are pungent; but, not after heat has been applied to them.  Don't ask me. I don't know why this is but after you bake these babies they're only slightly, very slightly, spicier that a green bell pepper. (IMHO)

Easy & delicious - the fresh jalapeño peppers were very mild, so use a spicier sausage if you want extra heat.

This recipe is super easy.  I made these for a Superbowl party yesterday.  I used chorizo sausage and it made them really flavorful.  I served them with Litehouse Ranch dressing for dipping and they disappeared in a flash!

I made these as an appy for a cocktail party and everyone loved them! Some turned out hotter than others, not sure why, but I got rave reviews. I am not a fan of jalapenos but I still thought they were good. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe but I made some changes. Instead of Parmesan cheese I used pepper jack. I mix the pepper jack in with the sausage to melt it in the pan. Then I put the sausage and pepper jack into a bowl and mixed in the cream cheese. Everyone loved it. I'm not so sure they would've liked it with cream cheese and Parmesan.

Wonderful recipe! I have been wanting to try this for a while, and it was everything I was hoping it would be! I did follow reviews and soak the jalapeños in cold water. I don't eat pork, and the beef sausage has been extra greasy lately, so I substituted in some turkey sausage. It wasn't ground, but I skinned it and chopped it up, and it worked beautifully. I also wrapped them in Turkey bacon, and broiled it for 2-3 minutes at the end. I brought some to my mother-in-law, and after making everyone try some, she then stole the pan and hide it for herself! I also made the whole batch, but then froze some (uncooked) to heat up later, since they really are better fresh, and they are the perfect side/appetizer.  Definitely will be repeated!

These are delicious! I never come home with leftovers. They are good hot or cold.  The sausage and Parmesan cheese are a welcome change from the usual bacon and cheddar you find with stuffed jalapeños.

I have made these a couple of times and have made some needed changes. Only add ¼ parmesan cheese (I use Pecorino Romano but parmesan will do); if you add the full cup they are no longer creamy, and creamy is what you what. Cook your sausage until very well done. The cream cheese adds the moisture you need and crispy sausage bits work well. Lastly, after baking for 17 min. I add a little panko bread crumbs over the top and broil for 3 min., being careful not to burn them. Trust me on all this!

OMG These are so SPICY HOT! My husband took one bite. I got one and a half eaten but thought the spiciness of the jalepeno's was too much. We both like spicy food but not THAT spicy!

I love hot things now, jalapeños seem tame now that I am used to Habaneros.  But. I did learn a secret in Mexico.  If you get too much hot a bit of honey stops the burn instantly.  You can even rub it on your skin, like for example your lip, or your hands, and it cures it.  I got a soup too spicy once and tamed it down with honey also.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!! I seasoned the sausage with salt and pepper while cooking it.  I used a reduced fat 4 cheese mexican mix for the shredded cheese instead of parmesean since I don't care for it much. I also wrapped these with applewood bacon....yum, yum. I made two batches of these and I think they were gone in less than 20 minutes. Huge hit! Thanks for sharing!

These were so good! My husband bragged to everyone how tasty they were. I made 1.5x the recipe and filled a bunch of anaheim pepper. That was all we had in the garden. I added about a teaspoon of cayenne to the cheese/sausage mixture and a few splashes of bottled jalapeno sauce. they turned out fantastic. easy to prepare. I steam my peppers in a glass pan for 3 minutes to soften before stuffing and baking.

I have made this recipe twice now for family events and it has been a big hit. All of my relatives can't get enough! I did run out of jalapenos though so I substituted in some green and yellow bell peppers. The yellow bell peppers really bring out all the flavors. Also, I found that if you want more of kick with the jalapenos, keep the seeds and mix them back in with the sausage mixture. I love spicy. Thanks for this great recipe!

Made this for a church event and they were gone within no time at all! It is a good amount of heat (definitely not for those who dislike spicy), but I was thrilled with hot easy they were to make and how yummy they tasted. As long as you have the time to de-seed the peppers, this is a winner of an appetizer!

I give this a 4 due to my personal need for doctoring this recipe to make it more flavorful. I used a combination of ground pork and chorizo sausage for the filling. I also added a few cloves of minced garlic and onion. In addition to the cream cheese and parmesan, I added some colby jack. I also made the stuffing the day before which helped the flavor. All in all, a great recipe--it just needed a tweak or two.

I made these for a BBQ and they were a huge hit. I was surprised at how mild the jalapenos are after removing the seeds and baking them. Will definitely be making these again, possibly bacon wrapped next time.

Too dry.. maybe I drained out too much of the sausage fat after it cooked. I didn't use cheap ingredients so I'm not sure what happened.

These were delicious and very easy to make.  However, the jalapenos I used were not very spicy. My family loves spicy foods and most couldn't taste any heat, luckily I anticipated this and saved the seeds and sprinkled them on top of the second batch, which helped.  I also tried Hungarian Wax peppers, which are spicier, but most of my family could even go hotter than this.  Will definitely be making again, but will try out a greater variety of spicy peppers.  I may also use hot sausage next time.

I make these with turkey sausage and they are super easy and always a huge hit, I've made no adjustments but might add a little chopped parsley just for looks.

These peppers were a hit at a holiday party.  I accidently bought ground pork instead of ground pork sausage.  I just added garlic, onion, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper and they tasted great.

I just made these!! Very tasty. They've been out of the oven for 15 minutes, and they are gone!!The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan and 1/2 cup of 4 cheese Mexican Blend shredded cheese.

While prepping the jalapenos, I was sure that these things were going to be way too hot. The fumes were making me cough. I got some really potent jalapenos, I guess. However, after I filled and baked them, the heat was not bad at all, and the flavor was wonderful. If you are on a low carb diet, these things can be a real secret weapon to your success.

Made this recipe for a party and low and behold my husband (so picky) loved it. He told me to be sure to make them again so he could them to work. I think 20 minutes is to long to cook them though.

I didn't realize my oven was on broil when I put these in, but they turned out fantastic that way so I'll probably broil them again next time.  No ranch dressing was needed for us.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I both ate one when they first came out and thought they were way too spicy.  We thought there was no way anyone would eat one.  But an hour later the spiciness must've dripped out some because they were delicious!

What can I say that hasn't already been said?!  Excellent recipe, will definitely be making again.  I served them with the Green Onion Ranch Dip from this site and the combo was a great hit. There was three people eyeballing each other for the last one!  I had leftover stuffing which I used to make an omelet with this morning.

Loved these.  I did soak the Jalapenos for an hour in iced water to reduce the heat.  Cooked the sausage on an electric skillet, covered with foil in the oven to save them from burning.

These are easy to make and everyone loved them!  I used breakfast sausage because it was easy and already seasoned.  Very tasty!

Huge hit with all who have tried them!  No need for the dressing.  Best with good quality grated cheese.

I served these as part of our Super Bowl fare. They were good but got soggy fast. I will probably only make them for smaller get-togethers in the future.

I made these for snacks for the Super Bowl.  They were wonderful!.  My son wasn't sure he wanted to eat jalapenos that were stuffed with sausage and baked rather than stuffed with cheese only, breaded and fried.  He loved these!  They had just the right amount of bite.

Made these for the Super Bowl and they were a HUGE hit!  I used spicy sausage and it was great.    The recipe suggests dipping them in ranch dressing, but I don't think they need it.  They are perfect, as is.

Made these for the super bowl this year.  I bought 20 peppers, turned out to be 1.5 pounds.  Scraping out the seeds/ribs was the most time consuming part of the process, but the end result was outstanding.  Everyone raved about these, and all 20 peppers were GONE within 20 minutes.  There was an entire kitchen worth of food! Thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome.  I change it up a bit using bacon bits instead of sausage and a Kraft Mexican blend of cheeses instead of the parmesan.  We like them hot or cold.  My husband puts them on his hamburgers.  Weather permitting we grill.

These are AWESOME!! I added cheddar cheese to the mixture and also some dried cranberries for a little sweet addition. They were scarfed down! Will definitely be making these over and over again! Slightly greasy... DEFINITELY drain the sausage over paper towels. They would've been really greasy had I not done that.

YUMMO!! These Jalapenos were awesome.  Everyone devoured them in no time.  I brought some Ranch dressing to serve with them, but it was not needed.  Only change I made was to use Jimmy Dean Mild sausage.  I added a few drops of Habenaro Chili sauce to half of them for a little more kick.  Next time I think I will try the Jimmy Dean HOT sausage.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good. Made as written. I used a breakfast sausage (not the best choice) but it was still good. Next time I will use Spicy Italian.

I was blown away by these peppers last night!  I made half the recipe as a test for a family dinner next week and I ate about 15 of them.  I placed 1/3 of a strip of bacon on each stuffed pepper before baking and it was a smart move!  The best part of this recipe is how cheap it is to cook.  The peppers were $.99 per lb so this whole recipe costs about $8.00 to make and it would be about $25 worth of restaurant jalapeno poppers.  Two thums way way up!!!!!

This was a hit at a New Years Eve party I brought this too.  Just to keep in mind, I made mine for a serving size of 36 but did not need to have three pounds of sausage or cream cheese.  A little goes a long way in this dish!

These earn a 5-star rating based just on the number of requests I get for this recipe.  They are always a big hit no matter where I take them. We double the recipe and use half original sausage and half zesty hot. So easy and with minimal ingredients. I made another similar recipe from this site that was much more time-consuming and required alot more ingredients.  This particular one, however, seems to win hands-down.  Make sure to wear gloves when preparing the peppers. Also know that alot of the heat cooks out of the peppers so they are not really all that spicy. Give them a try!

I took the advise of another and pre-cooked the peppers for 8 minutes to soften.  I wonder if that is why they were starting to ooze out the filling after only 8 minutes once stuffed.  No matter, they were wonderful and the hit of the party.  I served them with the Christmas Jalapeno Jelly and it kicked up another notch.  Great recipe.

These were great! I've made them twice now and found myself coughing the whole time I was seeding them, so be warned. I didn't use the whole cup of Parmesan, instead I used 1 cup of already shredded cheese from the store and just a little bit of Parmesan (maybe 1/4cup). The second time I made them I added some jalapeno jack cheese for hubby & his co-workers. I'm making them again on Christmas but this time suckered my brother into seeding them. lol

Very good!  yes, my hands were burning later in the evening - like a delayed reaction.  I should have heeded the advice to wear gloves.  I only made about 8 jalepenos worth.  They were a hit!

update - made these a few times now - didn't have gloves but put my hands in plastic bags while de-seeding which worked fine.  These are always good but sometimes a bit mild - when you use hot italian sausage that helps add some heat if you like it that way.  They're a great go-to appetizer!

I used 1lb ground pork and seasoned it with 1 tablespoon of veg oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and adobo since I didn't have pork sausage. I also used mexican cheese mix instead of parm.  They were still incredible! I put them out as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and they were gone before all the guests got here! It made more mixture than peppers, so next time I will use the same amount of mixture with a mix of jalapenos and long peppers! The heat was not an issue for anyone. I cleaned them well and baked for the recommened time and they were not too hot for anyone!

Thanks for the recipe. Defineatly a keeper

Excellent appetizer! I made these twice in one week. They are a little time consuming to make (and rubber gloves are a must!), but they are so worth it! Update: Here are a couple tips I've learned after making these so many times: 1. if you don't have any gloves, stick your hands in baggies. it works in a pinch. 2. I use a grapefruit spoon to scoop the insides but I do leave some seeds in for heat. 3. I know this sounds odd, but if your sausage is really greasy after you cook it, give it a little rinse with some hot water. I also have been know to add crushed red pepper, and I've used all kinds of cheeses. I'd give this 10 stars if i could.

Great appetizer to put out for parties.  My family liked this a lot and if you take out all the seeds it is even good for the kids.  I like to leave a few seeds in the adult side of the cookie sheet- some end up a "little" hotter than others.

One of my absolute, most popular appetizers EVER! I've made these countless times (sometimes, I add bacon or wrap in bacon) and I can't tell you how many compliments (and recipe requests) I've received. They are always all gone and requested at every party or event. FABULOUS recipe AS IS.

These were a favorite for the holiday picnic. I stuffed big bannana peppers and jalapenos. Love them.

Don't forget to remove the seeds and ribs of the jalapenos first.  (UNless you like then to be REALLY hot.)  I love spicy food so I thought I would get sweet Italian sausage and leave the seeds in--barely able to eat them all!

These were a big hit at a get together with friends. I doubled the cream cheese because the sausage took over and the filling wouldn't stick together. Overall, a great recipe to use up all those jalapenos from the garden.

I have made these so many times I have lost count.  My bosses and co workers request these everytime we have a snack day.  My boss says he has tried similiar peppers at various restaurants and he always tells me that mine are much better.  I totally agree about wearing gloves when preparing the peppers or you will be sorry.

Mmmm... they were good. I halved the recipe and made it for a snack for me and my husband and they were good. I could't help but wrap bacon around them after putting the mixture on the pepper (i have always had bacon with stuffed jalapenos. the only bad thing about that is they were not hot enough. My husband suggested putting in a few seeds in the mixture. I thought about making these for a christmas gathering we are having, I think I will add a few seeds in and see how they turn out.

I made this last night for a holiday party and thought they were very good. However, as mentioned in some other reviews, I strongly recommend you wear gloves when seeding the jalepenos. I made about 40 of them and by the end my hands felt like they were on fire. They hurt for hours! I added chopped scallions to the cheese mix and sprinkled a little mozzerella on top before baking. They looked and tasted great. Only problem was that even after I removed every single seed and the membranes, my jalepenos were still very, very spicy. Will try again though. Thanks!

This recipe is SO GOOD!  I used Hot Italian Sausage with Parmesan Cheese.  I took it to a Bronco party and the jalapenos were gone before the game even started.  We didn't think there was a need for the ranch dressing.

My family loves spicy food so I figured I would double the recipe as I was making these for Thanksgiving appetizers.  Let me tell you 2 lbs was definitely not enough, the enitre tray was cleared in 10 mins and not everyone got to try them.  Everyone has asked me for the recipe.  I even had to make 2 more lbs the next day for some out of town guests who stopped by and once again the tray was cleared in a few minutes.  I have already been told to bring these for Christmas.  I am going to another holiday party next weekend and these will definitely be coming with me.  They are so easy to make and everyone will love them, trust me!!

These were really good, though the jalepenos I got from my supermarket were barely hotter than a bell pepper.  With hotter peppers they would be fabulous.  Also, serving them with ranch dressing was key.  I will definitely serve these again for company. It would be easy to prepare them ahead of time then pop them into the oven right before you want to serve them.

I used fat free cream cheese...turkey italian sausage.  The jalapeno coring process was time consuming.  I personally didn't love them, however, my husband thought they were excellent game day food!

WOW!!!!! I only fixed 10 peppers which gave me 20 halves.  I thought this would be plenty because I only had 5 people over.  They constantly reminded me that there was not enough. Everyone absolutely loved them.  They were delicious. The next time I make these I will leave a few seeds in order to get a little spice.  Will absolutely make this again.

This was a great recipe!  The only change I made was to use homemade ground chirizo sausage that my husbands great grandmother sends up from texas. I made 30 of these for a football game party and I don't think that they were out of the oven for more than 10 minutes when they were gone!  Everyone loved them and I got a dozen requests for the recipe!

I substituted half of the sausage for an equal amount of bite-sized slightly pinked shrimp. I was very good. Next time I'll add mushrooms. (Remember to wear gloves when seeding the jalapenos. I forgot and "burned" my fingers.)

OMG.  I guess I'm used to the "poppers" you buy at the store and order as an appetizer at a restaurant.  These are the real deal & they are incredibly spicy, unlike the others.  I had to eat 3 popsicles in a row to put out the fire!! LOL.  I like spicy food, but this was way beyond desirable.  Will not be making again.

These are the best!  I quickly made a batch of my own after a co-worker brought some to an office party.  Major important - wear gloves when working with the jalapeno's.  I didn't and boy did I pay for it for a few days.  My only suggestion:  make sure to crumble the beef/sausage finely.  It stuffs easier.

Served these as an appetizer and got so many compliments.  I split the cream cheese/sausage mixture in half, and to one half I followed the recipe exactly, to the other half I added sharp cheddar cheese instead and then coated them with crunched up rice krispies (for a crunchy texture) and they were excellent.  Both were amazing!  The ranch dip is awesome with it!  Definitely a keeper!

These were excellent. Took them to a birthday party. I was running late so I thought to cook them at the party. Unfortunatly, the apartment clubhouse did not have an oven. I set them out, uncooked, and they disappeared. I made sure to scrape out all the seeds and membrane but some people still thought them too hot. I'll add some of the seeds to spice them up and cook them next time for myself

Very good recipe! Just like my grandma's.  I used homegrown jalepeños for mine. Some had more heat than others. Took these to my in-laws for dinner and they are not the spicy food type of people but they loved them!

KETO Friendly!!  My go-to recipe for the past 5 yrs. We love this recipe. I like to sprinkle more parmesan on top of the peppers before baking them.

I have made these peppers many times and they are ALWAYS gone at parties, even when I’ve made more than the basic recipe. If they’re still on the platter people keep eating them. Gave it 5 stars because the basic recipe is so good but I have changed it up from time to time. I always use HOT pork sausage (remember, the peppers themselves aren’t hot if you remove all the seeds and white membranes), and sometimes I mix in a little shredded cheddar blend or some pecorino Romano, just depends on what’s in the fridge. Even people who say they “don’t like hot stuff” that try them always love them, it’s the perfect blend of soft baked peppers, sausage and CHEESE!

I used asagio and parmesan cheese.  I'd use a little less cream cheese as well next time. Overall they were good.

I brought it to a. Christmas party and it was a hit.  It was so easy to make also.  The filling makes enough for more than 1 pound of peppers.  It’s more like 1 1/3 pounds.

Wonderfully simple and delightful recipe! Made it for thanksgiving dinner, for a slightly different change on tradition. Started with two dozen peppers, thought I was over doing it.  Had zero left overs, everyone loves them!

I tried this recipe with a mix of jalapeño and sweet peppers since I was not certain how spicy the recipe was. I used store bought peppers.  I was able to use one recipe for 22 peppers. The jalapeños were not too spicy. Next time I’ll use them exclusively. We did not need the salad dressing. I had ranch dip and onion dip available for dipping but the peppers were so yummy and cheesy they were not needed. One family member who likes spicy, has made jalapeño poppers himself said these were really good. He typically wraps his in bacon and cooks them in the smoker. I think he was surprised at how good these were and soooo easy to make.

Delicious!  A bit time-consuming, but relatively easy.  I didn't have parmesan, so I used mozarella, which worked out great.  I made too many for my small group.  I'm going to see how well they freeze, either already cooked or uncooked.  I hope to get back to this to reply.  :P

These are very good.  I had to make my own breakfast sausage so I think it affected the flavor.  I think they would be very good without the meat or with Chorizo sausages.  I would make these again.

This was awesome. I think it will be my go to app. Seems like you could do everything in the AM and then refrigerate until yo're ready to put them in the oven. They browned so nicely and the peppers were so sweet.

I made a vegetarian option of these with gardein beetles ground (frozen isle at Giant) and added a shallot finely chopped.  Same amount of cream cheese and parmesan.  You need to heat the ground slowly and add the cheese to it warm because it's premade.  Delicious!  I will make the sausage for my carnivorous friends.  Thanks for sharing this.

I added some fresh garlic and salt and pepper to the mixture and topped each stuffed pepper with shredded mozzarella cheese.   These are very good!  Made about 20 large jalapeños.

I made these for my wife and I, went by the recipe and made about 24 med sized peppers and still had about half the mixture left.... so, I had some small sweet peppers in the fridge and stuffed them too...try it..! They were better than the jalapeño poppers were, which were out of this world good...!

These have been a family favorite for years, they all insist we bring them to every family function. We make ours slightly differently but they taste almost the same, if not... a little better. We use 1 pckg of bulk sausage, 1 8oz pckg cream cheese, & Old Bay seasoning (to taste, u have to keep adding until u get to desired saltiness & flavor.) I usually cook the filling a day ahead of time bc it’s easier to handle & stuff the peppers when it’s chilled. I bake them at 375 for about 30-35 mins. I fill the baking sheet w/ as many peppers as I can, that’s why I bake that long. If I’m only making a handful then I bake for about 20 mins. This also depends on size of peppers. I look for the really big ones because stuffing peppers is fairly tedious. Make sure u use gloves when working w/ peppers, I’ve gotten some bad burns from them!!!  Once you try these, you will be addicted!

These are addictive and SO delicious.  I didn't have parmesan cheese so I used cheddar cheese and they tasted great.  I scooped out all the seeds and they were just the right about of heat.  Real heat lovers could probably leave some of the seeds.
Had 2 left over so I wrapped them in plastic wrap and froze them.  Later, took them out, put them in the microwave and they were ready to go.  Nice to make some ahead and have a few whenever you want without all the mess to make them 
from scratch.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Super easy to do. If you cant do this, stay out of the kitchen. When mixing sausage and cheese mixture, do it by hand. Dont crumble your sausage up too small. People tend to like the texture of knowing there is meat in there. 
   You could substitute cheddar or other cheeses. I used spicy sausage that really wasnt that spicy. so i add some crushed red pepper flakes and diced onions when i was cooking sausage. 
  It turned out excellent. Thank you.

These are AMAZING!  Even my 9 year old son loved these, he ate 5 with dinner!  Only thing I would change, is to add a little more cream cheese-my package of sausage was a little over a pound.  Will make these again!

I just made it for Super Bowl party. It sounded too easy so i made some alterations just for fun, like some reviews suggested. I used 11 large jalapeño peppers, cut in halves and gutted with tiny measuring spoon, kept tails on; i used hot Italian sausage, although it turned out too mild anyway, next time i will add red hot flakes, or cayenne. I used only half of Philadelphia amount; I used Parmesan half in half with mixed shredded cheeses we had at home, total amount as in original recipe. I fried and drained sausage, and at the same pan caramelized two table spoon of chopped sweet onion and two little cloves of garlic, chopped, and aged to the meat. I shaped by hand little “sausages” from staffing and inserted into the peppers halves, easy and quick. I used baking as one review suggested 350 F for about 30 min. All proportions were ideal, all peppers were stuffed and no leftover stuffing. Everybody liked it.

I've made this 4 times now. It's always a hit. It's best to grill the poppers. This last time I used cojita cheese instead of Parmesan for a more authentic Mexican flavor.

Need to make sure the scallops are very dry otherwise they don't brown well in the pan. It always makes more sauce than we need so might want to cut back on the sauce.

These are so, so good.  We leave just a little bit of the membrane in each pepper so that they have a kick.  I also use a melon baller to remove the seeds and membrane - it makes for fast work.  Finally, serving the spicy version of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing on the side is the perfect accompaniment.

These were really good!  I used turkey sausage because that is what I had available.  I topped them with some grated cheddar cheese.  We didn't have any ranch dressing, but my husband thought they tasted great with a dab of sour cream on them.  They weren't a lot of work, so I'm sure I'll make them again.

This was a great dish to serve at a party. Pretty simple to make and was a big hit for the effort involved. 

Not very spicy for those that may be worried. I used Italian sausage instead.

After reading many of the the reviews, I was excited and hoping these would be fantastic but sorry...I found them to be quite bland.  I followed the recipe to the T but wasn’t impressed.

as is the recipe is really tasty, however I like my poppers with more heat so next time I make them I'll leave some seeds and add some chili flakes to the sausage to give it more of a kick. I also felt like at 425 degrees and 15 min was plenty enough for them to crisp up but not burn. this is definitely an appetizer I will make all the time from now on.

I have been making these for years, I double recipe and use half hot half mild Italian sausage. I then stuff mushrooms and jalapeños. Love love love! These go so fast when put out for a gathering. I also leave seeds in some of the jalepnos for those that like more of a bite.

This is a great and simple appetizer, except I don't like jalapeños, so I use the mini red ,yellow ,orange, sweet peppers and they work perfectly and I also have stuffed mini bellas with this mix as well, very versatile mix and can be used in different things and always yummy and a big hit!

A crowd pleaser as written! Try using maple sausage or after browning and draining regular sausage just stir in a teaspoon of maple syrup before adding cream cheese. I omitted the parmesan due to saltiness. Wrap in applewood smoked bacon, secure with toothpicks . Bake on shallow sheetpan at 350  for 30 minutes. Spicy, cheesy, smokey with a hint of sweet maple. My crowd was addicted! Note: half and stretch the bacon a bit if you have thick sliced variety to ensure it cooks in 30 minutes.

This was the first recipe I made from AR and is as good today as it was over 5 years ago! I make this appetizer for all occasions and make adjustments with spice as needed. Awesome recipe thanks a bunch! Spiced it up with diced habaneros mixed in with the cream cheese ..... yikes!

Crowd-pleaser! But BE ADVISED that cracking open 10 fresh jalapeños and scraping out the ribs and seeds will fill your lungs until you cannot breathe and you are taken to hospital. OPEN A WINDOW AND TAKE BREAKS AND HAVE A COOL GLASS OF WATER NEARBY. Great tips thank you: Make cheese mixture into cigars, then place into pepper shells. BEST TIP: The one who said to place the mixture in a BOWEL.

High marks!! When I make them again, which will be soon, I’ll use half hot and half regular sausage. But I made them just like the recipe and I loved them and everyone that ate them did too! I will double the recipe next time. Easy easy easy and a crowd pleaser!

Each time i have made these, they have been a hit!  You can play with the breakfast sausage depending on your guest. I have found mixing hot and mild sausage equally gives the dish a nice kick that most can handle and enjoy.  I usually make a few “surprise” peppers by adding some of the jalapeño seeds!

Excellent appetizer. Used regular sausage and a three cheese blend of Parmesan, Romano and Asiago.  We cooked up some bacon,crumbled it and at the end topped the jalapeños. Placed them back in the oven for 1-2 minutes to warm the bacon. Served with blue cheese dressing for dipping.

I added shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture. These were a huge hit at a party and i had several requests for the recipe.  I think 20 minutes in the oven makes the peppers too soft, so I changed to 17 min..... however, people like them both ways.

Perfect appetizer for gatherings. Everyone asks for the recipe and loves this! You can even make a “skinny” version with turkey sausage and low fat cream cheese and it’s still so good!

made them for a small gathering.  They were gobbled up in minutes.  So easy to make and quite the crowd pleaser.  Only mistake is to double the batch so there's more to go around!!

Wow! This is so easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly! No alterations, exceptions, substitutions, nothing. My husband love them and so did I. We have an abundance of jalapeños this year and they are perfect for this sort of appetizer/meal (if you eat enough of them)! I made the filling ahead of time so that I could just stuff the jalapeños when I was ready. We have made this recipe four times in the last two weeks and there is no end in site, yet.

I love these!  I have made them several times and frozen some to take out on another day and throw in the oven.  I use the bag of multi colored mini peppers that are mild.  Next time I may try a spicy cheese to mix in.

Easy to make. I used a pork sausage and it was a little overpowering. You could not taste the cheese, just the pork and I did not use a lot of pork. Next time I think I will use turkey pork as it is lighter and will use less parm. But these do have a bite!

These had no real depth of flavor.  Couldn't taste the jalapeño at all.  Kinda disppointed.

Delicious! I used four large jalapenos peppers that my co-worker gave me from her garden. I used grated Parmesan cheese and the full 8 oz of cream cheese and about 1/2 lb of Jimmy Dean pork sausage, and it turned out perfect!! Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely be making these all the time!

Definitely use sweet italian sausage (not spicy). If the peppers are small more may be needed. Make sure to stack peppers close together, so they don't roll over and the insides fall out.

Most excellent recipe.  Followed the recipe to the tee and they vanished within minutes.   I did however get the sausage from a butcher and give them a generous sprinkle of parm before baking to ensure the golden brown crust.   Served  them with sweet & sour sauce as we had ranch on the table all ready.  Thank you.

We definitely enjoyed these and they're super easy!  I might add some crumbled bacon to the mix or some cheddar cheese- or both!  But all in all an easy and delicious recipe.  I used Italian sausage.

I thought this receipe was very good as is.  If you don't like heat then make sure to remove all of the seeds and any white membrane inside of the jalapeno.  Next time I will try this with bratwurst in place of breakfast sausage.

I  will definitely be making these again.  Everyone enjoyed them.  I had leftover cooked bacon the next day and just put a small slice  on top to keep them from drying out when i reheated them.   This worked really  well.  They enjoyed them a lot even when reheated.  Thank-you for the recipe.

I made no changes to this recipe.  I made  these for a weekend getaway with friends at a VRBO. They were gobbled up. They were perfect spiciness for the more sensitive palate. Those with a more adventurous palate added a few drops of hot sauce. I fried the  pork sausage at home, drained the fat from it and when cooled I put it into a Ziploc bag and froze it overnight so by the time we got to the rental all I had to do was mix all the ingredients together and bake it. So easy and  minimal cleanup . I would consider a half regular half spicy pork sausage mixture next time (but consider my guests).

These were great!!!  I made them up hours before our party began and stuck them in the fridge.  Then 10 minutes before our guests were due I popped them in the oven.  The seeded peppers are not super hot!!!  The sausage and cream and parm cheeses make a fantastic combo.  These were a huge hit and I felt like the queen chef!!!!!!

Definitely a crowd pleaser.  Actually received this recipe from a friend on Thanksgiving, so I was happy to get exact directions.  They turned out great.  I had prepared them ahead, except for the baking and thought I took them out early enough to get to room temperature.  Actually had to cook them a little longer than directed but everyone still loved them.  (Despite the wait.)

I made as written, cleaned all seeds and membrane  from  peppers. Proportions were spot on and the filling held together! With that said, there was no heat what so ever. Great recipe that I will adjust up with spice and make again. Thank you for sharing a good recipe....one note, due place cooked sausage between paper towels and squeeze excess oil/fat before combining.

I made this recipe for a New Years Eve party, I doubled the recipe and ended up with 50 jalapeno halves. After about two hours they were all gone! Everyone loved them. The only change I made was I didn't have enough parmesan cheese so I went half and half parmesan and sharp cheddar, the rest of the recipe was followed exactly. I did get one suggestion from a friend who thought they weren't hot enough. He says to leave a few seeds in next time. LOL

Overall the recipe was fine in that it was easy to follow and cooked well but I didn't like the flavor at all. I'm not sure if it was the mixture of cream cheese with sausage or what. It also didn't look very appealing. The cream cheese gave it a white, unappetizing color. I would have rated stars but one of my guests really liked them so I think it's only a matter of taste.

This stuffing is amazing.  I used poblano  peppers instead of jalapenos because they were so small at the store there was no way I could stuff anything in them.  This substitute turned out fine and I found more people were able to enjoy them since they lack the amount of heat as a jalapeno.  I have used the stuffing in many different recipes and often times I will add fresh mushrooms or some some additional spices.  Love this!

These were delicious and easy to make!  I made them just as recipe states and didn't find that anything needed to be changed.  I worried they'd be too spicy for some of the more sensitive palates at our party, but everybody loved and raved about them!  If anything, you could leave some seeds in for a little more heat.  Will definitely make these again!

No matter how you make stuffed jalapenos they are a hit and disappear

Delicious, but mostly as an idea generator. I can't really rate the recipe "as is", because I made it my own way, first grilling up some chorizo sausage meat and then adding all kinds of  different cheeses, pearl onions, seasonings, hot sauce, etc...

We found these poppers to be quite yummy!!  The stuffing mixture is flavorful, but I probably should have drained the pork sausage a bit longer, as the final product (to me) seemed a bit greasy, but my man loved them. My only critique for myself is to buy more jalapenos next time, since I ran out of peppers, I ended up over stuffing them, which usually wouldn't be a bad thing, but in the baking process some tumbled over. I stuck to the original recipe, no alterations. Will certainly make again!

This was delicious and super easy.  I might use a bigger pepper in the future, like a cubanelle or red pepper, to save some time.  The most time consuming part was cleaning the peppers.  It was also super scary for me because I fear hot peppers :) However, once you scoop out the entire insides of the jalapeno, it's not hot anymore and doesn't taste much different than a green pepper when cooked.   So, unless you leave some hotness, I think any pepper would do for this recipe.

I made substituted an Italian cheese blend for the parmesan.  
I also switched up the peppers - I made half with hot peppers & the rest mini sweet peppers so that people who don't like spicy foods could still eat them.   They were a big hit at a new years eve party.

This one turned out great. The only thing I changed was to add a handful of Mozzarella cheese.  Even people who "don't like peppers" liked this one.

I made these yesterday (by the way Happy New Year!) and took to a New Year's party.  I doubled the recipe and they were gone before you knew it.  I forgot the ranch dressing and nobody missed it.  Everybody loved them.  I will be making these all rear round because they were so great; and easy too!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  Debbie

Just made for NYE! Absolutely delicious! Made exactly as the directions noted...no substitutions. Thank you all for suggesting wearing gloves to handle the jalapeños and using a melon ball scooper ....worked perfectly. I don't think the ranch dressing is necessary they are so flavorful but maybe that adds another layer. Enjoy!!

Every time I make this recipe for a party, they are eaten as fast as they come out of the oven.  Some people think they may be too spicy hot, but once convinced to try one, they are addicted. Make sure you don't oil or grease the cooking pan.  The jalapenos produce enough oil by themselves.  I prefer using Jimmy Dean Sausage for flavor and ability to chop fine.

I have made a similar recipe. I use Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage.  1 c Parmesan cheese, no dressing. But I do cut up 4 or 5 green onions, the whole thing. Mix with cream cheese, bake for 20-25 minutes on 425, until golden brown.

This was delicious!!!! Although what I did different was I added the ranch into the mix to avoid the dipping & all. It turned out sooooo good!!!! My family Loved them! Although I did need about another 1lb of Jalapeños since I added the Ranch to mix "FYI".

I am giving this a 5 star rating for its simplicity and great taste!  
I used mixed cheddar and jack cheese in place of the Parmesan. The only problem with these was that I did not make enough.  These will be a staple in our house!

If you have leftovers, cut them up and cook with potatoes to make a hash, two eggs on top - tasty.

I need to try with parmesan next time. I had to use mixed cheese, but otherwise followed recipe.

I paused a football game to come and leave this review!
These were awesome. Ive been looking for something to do with  all of the jalapenos  I grew in my garden. Im so glad I stumbled onto this recipe. The only advice I would give is keep an eye on them, depending on the size of the peppers and amount of filling,  15 minutes might be enough.  (my garden peppers varied in size,) I will be making this recipe for years to come!

Very good!  Had never made these before, but had eaten some with a sausage stuffing so I chose this recipe.  I used a serrated grapefruit spoon for cleaning out the membranes and seeds of the jalapenos, and I think that was ideal!  Worked much better than my melon baller, which was too large.  The only change I made was using about half parmesan cheese and half a Mexican mixture, which is what I had.  The extras are chilling in the freezer to bag up right now.  I did lower the temp to 350 after about 20 - 25 min. and cooked about 10 min. longer, but I had chilled the filling to do later.

We absolutely loved these!  I made them to take with us to a party we went to and everyone raved about them and requested that I bring them to the next party as well.  I will definitely make them again!  The only thing I  added was some crumbled bacon pieces on top just because I love bacon.

My friends and family love these.  I originally tried them at work when someone brought them in and they went very fast.
I don't use bacon or other cheeses, but just follow the recipe.  The key is good peppers.   Since cooking them reduces the heat, you want to start w/ some hot ones so by the time you serve them, there is till some "zip".   Yes, you can keep some of the seeds as those add heat but no one wants to eat seeds.

Made 'em. Loved 'em. If you like it 'hot' - mince the pepper seeds and ribs, and add them to the mixture. I don't like waiting for cream cheese to soften so I put the cooked/drained (still hot) sausage over the cream cheese in a bowl. Fast softening. The ranch dressing is a must.

They ended up just being okay.  The filling was lacking flavor for me.  My mom had suggested that it would be better served as just a dip and cut up jalapeno into the mixture.  I may try it again as my mom has suggested.

This is a quick and simple recipe that invites experimentation.  I’ve made these three times over the past year with great results.  For my first go, I made the recipe as-is and it was a delicious.  Next, I tried wrapping the peppers in pre-cooked bacon with even better results. Most recently, I used extra sharp Vermont Cheddar instead of Parmesan and brushed the tops with a thick Texas BBQ sauce immediately before baking.  The result was a sweet peppery glaze that played nicely against the heat of the peppers.  Anyway, for me, this one is a keeper.

These are super tasty.  I have made them twice and both times I had more stuffing than jalepenos so next time I will probably get a few more than a pound.  Also definitely wear gloves.  The first time I didn't and my hands were on fire that night.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the third time I have made this recipe to bring to parties. I have had rave reviews each time & no left overs. It's an easy recipe with only 4 ingredients but a little time consuming with the seeding and stuffing, but well worth it. This recipes calls for one pound of jalapenos , the one I have calls for 22 medium size jalapenos and always works perfect ! Wear gloves when seeding. I didn't and had to soak my hands in milk to get rid of the burning feeling !

Perfect! Removed all the seeds and these things still cleared my sinuses very well! Definitely spicy. I used Parmesan cheese, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Jimmy Dean all natural pork sausage. Very quick and and say to make, but be careful with the jalapeños when cutting them in half- can make your fingers burn burn burn! These were full of flavor and I recommend them to anyone.

I have to make these every time the wife's work has a potluck.  To say they are loved is an understatement.  I love the original recipe.  But also love playing around with different ingredients.  Have used chorizo to great affect.

I made these for the Super Bowl & since it was my first time making this  I made a very small batch  but i'll be sure to make a big batch next time.  They were SOO good....a little crunch with the pepper then creamy tasty goodness.  My husband suggested using bacon next time....we'll see.  I used evenly shaped peppers (6) allowing 2 bites each per half.

This is an awesome appetizer.  I have used the oven once and the grill twice.  Cook 10 min for spicy, 20 min for medium, and 30 min for mild.

Have made these several times, I like them better when they cook a little longer.  20 minutes leaves the peppers with too much crunch.  I like them a little more well done but love them.  Great recipe.

Awesome!  I used canned parmesan cheese, but next time I'll use parmesan from the dairy aisle or try another cheese.  It took longer than I thought to prepare the peppers, though.

Very good and a unique flavor as opposed to the everyday jalapeno poppers. I used Jimmy Dean's sage sausage and mixed in about 1/4 cup of sharp cheddar. These didn't last long at the party.

I've made these maybe four times now.  They are a big hit.  I usually use 32 jalapenos and I believe two pounds sausage, one  spicy and one not.  Also, don't cut the white veins out 100% otherwise you will be left with a non spicy Jalapeno.

I used whole jalapenos that I cored and seeded.  I also used homemade sausage.  I stuffed the jalapenos and cooked them on the grill using my jalapeno popper holder.  Delish!

Read all reviews and thought, it can't be that good... wrong!  It was the hit at a NYE party!  I used both jalapeno peppers and small sweet peppers.  Next time will just use the jalapeno peppers since everyone said they were very mild.  Much better "vessel" to fill and bake.  Will be making it at next cocktail party for sure!

Huge hit at the Christmas Party. The cream cheese is a great balance to the spicy jalepenos! Next time Id serve them on top of paper towels to help absorb some of the grease though! Super easy, quick and delicious recipe.

Made twice, each time needed to increase the amount of Jalapenos I use.  And still have left over filling.  

Both times I made it the same way with changes from the original.  One block of softened cream cheese 1+ cup of shredded colby cheese mix.  

Mixing in the bowl, I added about 10 dashes of Frank's Red Hot sauce.  I let this sit as long as I can.  1-2hrs in the fridge works, but tasted better sitting overnite.  Also added a little bit of salt/pepper.  

Taking a pound of bacon, I cut this in half and it fits perfectly around half a pepper with filling.  To hold the bacon in place, I soaked some toothpicks in water for a couple minutes.  

Top each finished piece with a touch of Salt and pepper for color.  

I baked at the suggested temp for 15-16min covered with foil, then broiled for the last 5 minutes to crisp up the bacon.  The bacon on the bottom of the pepper still needs a few more minutes so I'm going to extend the cook time to about 17min, then test the broil for about 4min.

These little appetizers are delicious, and pretty easy to make. I prefer making these over regular Jalapeno Poppers because you don't have to make as many since they're cut in half! I will definitely try these again!

I followed the recipe as written and made some without the pork sausage and both varieties were a HUGE hit! Great recipe! Although the prep time is definitely longer if you don't start halve and seed your jalapeños beforehand!

Delicious!   I always make for football parties and everyone loves it because it is different.   I like it because it is spicy hot!

Everyone loves these. I use a Hot Italian sausage. I also serve a sour cream dip mixed with chipotle powder.

I used whipped cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, and 1 pound bacon, cooked and chopped instead of sausage.  Really easy, can be made ahead and baked 20 minutes before serving.  So good!  I like it because the bacon is evenly dispersed throughout and doesn't come off the popper in one piece.

Excellent.  Used chive and onion cream cheese, and realized too late I should have worn gloves to de-seed the peppers!!  This will be a regular in our house!!

I followed the recipe to the letter. I didn't use any ranch dressing. I thought they were too cheesy and not spicy enough. My jalapeno peppers were mild.

Made this as directed. Also tried some cheddar on a few and then some mozzarella on a few. I liked the ones with mozzarella more than the others. Also, baked at 340 for 20/25 minutes per other remarks. However, my family and I still prefer poppers bacon wrapped. Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS!! ... and so EASY!  I always clean all the membrane and seeds from the peppers because I have issues with hot stuff (tho I love them!) causing me digestive problems, but these do not bother my stomach at all if I'm careful not to leave any membrane and clean them well. I've shared this recipe with some family members and it is always a huge hit. I've made these several times and they never disappoint! We LOVE them.

I used poblano peppers because I couldn't find a decent sized jalapeno and that worked OK. The smaller size of the jalapeno is a more appropriate sized vessel, but the taste was still good. I also chose to use pepper jack cheese because I wanted to jack up the heat. And that also worked well. Next time, I'll sprinkle with a little cheese before baking and maybe some buttered panko to give it some crunch. Overall a good recipe and glad I tried it.

These turned out great! My dad can't handle spicy foods, so I made some with poblano peppers. He really liked them and they were very mild. I, on the other hand, would like the jalapenos a bit spicier. Next time, I will mix the seeds in with the sausage mix to give some more heat.

I made these for a cookout and they were a HUGE hit! Based on other reviews, my changes were using 3/4C of cheddar jack and 1/4C of shredded parm, wrapping the jalapenos in bacon, and throwing them in the freezer for ~15 minutes prior to cooking them on a wire rack. I was very impressed with how these came out, and other people who have tried my appetizers (mouthwatering stuffed mushrooms on , spinach dip, etc. from AR) said that these take the cake. These were so good that I was asked to make them again for a cookout next week!  Thank you very much for a new staple for social gatherings!

This was very easy to make, and was very flavorful.  I served it with a cucumber ranch dressing.  I had doubled the recipe.  My husband would like me to use smaller peppers next time and not as much cream cheese.  Definitely a repeat.

Excellent appetizer. We made it exactly as written. We wore gloves while working with the peppers. We didn't do any of this complicated soaking, wrapping with bacon, and adding extra ingredients. Prep time is quick if you keep it simple. The recipe as written is wonderful. No need to make things complicated. I loved the texture of the peppers. However, the hubby did say he would like the dish even more if the peppers were a little crisper. So, adjust cook time by a few minutes per personal likes.

I'm asked to bring these to every family gathering.  Absolutely delicious.  For those that say it is too spicy - make sure you remove all of the seed and scrape out the pepper a bit before stuffing, that will help.  But for me, I love it spicy!  So good, thank you for the recipe!

I liked the recipe, it was very tasty. The only difference is that I replaced the pork sausage with Jimmy Dean's Fully Cooked Turkey Sausage Crumble. A much healthier and easier approach that makes me feel better about all the cheese that is in the recipe. I also sneaked in some finely shredded carrots to make the colors pop.

Our family loves when I make these for the holidays.  Last year I made a raspberry dipping sauce which complemented them nicely. I use a 10 oz jar of raspberry preserves and 1 T white wine vinegar and heat in a saucepan.  Hope you enjoy it too!

I made these as something that my friends and I could eat on a low carb diet. They were great! As a matter of fact they were so good that all of the non lo carbers ate them all up and we barely got any. I did make a few changes like adding extra cheese and wrapping them in half cooked bacon before baking them but they were definitely a hit!

DELICIOUS!!! I did change some things... I used a package of hot Italian sausage and cut up about 1/4 cup onions and 1/4 cup jalapeños and added it to the meat while it was browning and with all my lefts overs I made awesome mini quesadillas!! Great for a quick lunch!!

This was an okay recipe.  Definitely not no 5 stars. I should of left the seeds in mixture because there was not much spice and that is that i did add chili flakes to the sausage. I dont think ill try again.

These are excellent!  Warning: Be careful when preparing the peppers to work in a well ventilated area, the fumes coming off the peppers can really cause your eyes and nose major distress.  But, it's well worthwhile!

Delicious!! The whole plate will be gone minutes after you set it out! Everyone loves these little jewels. Just be sure to clean out all the pepper seeds so the guests who don't like "hot" foods will be happy!You can't go wrong with this one!

Heck, yeah! These are head-and-shoulders above! I've made these time and time again, often cooking them on the grill in lieu of the oven, especially on hot summer days. Wanna take it up a notch? Substitute sharp cheddar for the Parmesan - the cheddar really compliments the heat of the jalapenos. Either way, they're delicious.

I made this recipe (X4) for a party, and people loved them. A couple of notes - I used half chorizo and half plain pork for the filling, and it really gave them some flavorful heat - though the porks do tend to leave a bit of grease laying around. Also, if you are halving and cleaning a few dozen jalapenos, DEFINITELY wear a pair of gloves. My hands were on fire like you can't believe for days - especially my nail beds on my hands - and it pretty much ruined the party for me. LOL. But people loved these...

Altered a little. I substituted a Filipino sweet sausage. Topped with fresh garlic, shredded cheddar/jack, and added some of the seeds in the cream cheese mixture for a little heat.

Great recipe. Definitely a go to when needing to bring an app or side dish. I push the tops into a coating of Panko bread crumbs and before serving I drizzle with fresh sour cream and garnish with cilantro.

This recipe is really good!!! The all the flavors cook down when they are baked and blend together well, nothing overpowers. I found the number of peppers needed depends on the size. I had 15 large peppers and it worked perfectly. Great recipe!

The filling for this recipe was good, but the jalapenos were so spicy that I could not eat more than a half of one --- and I made a ton! I took out the seeds but it was still super spicy, and I am a person who likes things spicy. Even with a glass of milk I could not eat these, but perhaps I had spicier jalapenos than others. I am also a vegetarian, so I followed the recipe as directed, except I used soyrizo (soy chorizo) to replace the sausage. I would make these again using either green or red pepper slices or milder jalapenos. In contrast though, my husband ate a lot of these and can handle spicier food than I can. Technically this should get 1 star since I really couldn't eat it but I'm giving it 3 since I blame the jalapenos, not the recipe.

Every time I make these, people stand around the table saying how they hurt so good, and can't stop eating them.  I use hot sausage and add the seeds back to the mix to make it hotter.  I then substitute half the cream cheese for goat cheese.  Makes it even better.

This was wonderful!  I made this yesterday for the first time, and used both jalapeno & poblano peppers, and hot Jimmy Dean sausage, with a little Ranch mixed in with the cheeses.  Ohhh did we enjoy them.  Personally the jalapeno were too hot for me, but the poblano were perfect!  Will add to my favorites!

This recipe is delicious. I was surprised as there are such few ingredients. Excellent flavor. The two of us ate the entire pan. They are a little labor intensive. I need to find bigger jalapenos next time. Will make again and again.

These are excellent.  I would suggest cooking the bacon slightly before wrapping the Jalapeños and backing.

Fantastic!! And not fried! I added 2 chopped green onions to stuffing, half hot and half mild Italian sausage and half sharp cheddar and half parm. I had some stuffing left over so I stuffed some mushrooms. I brought these babies to a margarita party and they were gone in a flash. I have been looking for a go to appetizer to bring to parties and this is it.

Wow!  I am so glad I made these! I had some extra jalapenos from the garden that I needed to use, and this was definitely a keeper recipe.  I'm a 'use what you have' cook, and realized halfway through preparation that I didn't have any parmesan, so I substituted shredded cheddar.  This is a new favorite that I will make again and again.  Thanks!

SO DELICIOUS!!! I would definitely recommend and make again.  The only change I would make would be to cut back a smidge on the cream cheese - only b/c it's so rich...just a matter of personal preference, but I would like more sausage stuffed inside. I didn't have any jalapeno peppers, so I used poblano peppers instead - steamed them & removed the skin.  The ranch drizzled on top really completes it! Really enjoyed it, thanks for sharing ;)

I have made these for so many gatherings, they are always the first munchie to go.  I use JD turkey sausage crumbles to cut down on fat and grease and add a little sea salt and cracked pepper.  Bacon works good as well if you don't have sausage on hand.  These are so good just on their own...  the ranch dressing is unnecessary.

Disappointed with these. You can't really taste the sausage or parmesan. Just tastes like cream cheese to me.

Wonderful!! I wouldn't change a thing. I cooked mine for a little less time sine I used small jalapenos and hot banana peppers straight from my garden. Make sure to drain and blot sausage well to avoid it being greasy. Thanks for the recipe!!

Made these with some modifications, added some cumin/ lime juice and chili powder. They were pretty great. I also made a batch using chopped up Buffalo Wings from Duffs instead of the pork and they were a big hit.

I like this recipe, but think it has too much cream cheese, which muted the sausage and parmesan flavors. Next time I'm going to use a little less.

what a hit at a Mother's Day Party. I did 2 pounds of jalapeno peppers and there was enough stuffing plus the flavor was excellent with not a one left over. The receipt was so easy for a last min. thing to make and will be doing it again soon.

Very good.  We used ground turkey with Cajun seasoning.  The rest per recipe.  Think next time I will top the finished pepper with any ol' cheese and pop under broiler for a minute.

Recipe is easy, quick to make, and delicious :).  I made a few substitutions, but they turned out really yummy.  Instead of jalapenos, I used Fresno chile peppers.  I used quark instead of cream cheese.  Lastly, I used some vegetarian Italian sausage to crumble on top of the stuffed peppers.  I will definitely make these again!

This has great flavor.  I don't really like the spiciness of jalapenos so I used poblanos and they turned out perfectly.  So simple yet very tasty.

I’ve made these peppers for years since I found this recipe a few years ago! ALWAYS gone in a flash! I followed the recipe exactly the 1st few times and now I change it up slightly depending on the crowd I’m serving. After I remove seeds and veins (if the crowd doesn’t like spicy) I always roast them in a big pan for 10-20 minutes at 350*, it helps soften them a little and then the mixture melts into the jalapeños. Sometimes I use hot sausage, cheddar cheese etc. This recipe is very versatile, always try the recipe the way it’s written then change it up to your liking!

This is a great recipe for those of us on a low-carb diet.  I reduced the amount of cheese the second time around as it was a little much for me, but overall easy and great even after refrigerated and reheated!

Took these to an Oscars party and they were a hit. The hubby went crazy over them, he said they were the perfect bite of meatiness with the jalapeño underlying flavor. Plus the cheesiness of course.. No one even used the ranch, they had plenty of flavor on their own. Used disposable gloves when seeding the jalapeños with a spoon and filling them. Really could taste each flavor component on its own, with the cream cheese bringing it all together.  This recipe is absolutely perfect as written.

Those of us that have been using a smoker for awhile may know these as ABT's (not to offend but it stands for Atomic Buffalo Turds) and might even have the vertical chili roasters for making them from whole jalapenos. Add a half slice of bacon to the top of these and viola', ABT's. I've made them with a variety of cheeses and things like fresh seasoned bread crumbs on top over crumbled bacon. I would recommend adding a good spice rub to the cream cheese mixture for a great burst of flavor.

These were great!  I did sub colby jack cheese for the parmesan, just for our tastes, so I almost didn't review it.  I think it would be good with the parm though.  I made the first batch with only that substitution and they were gone so fast I had to make another double batch for our super bowl party last night LOL! The second batch, I added a good shake of Tony Chachere's seasoning and sprinkled bacon bits on top- oh my goodness - they were over the top!  Thanks for a great recipe :)

I have been making this for years and it is always the most asked about dish at every party! The first time I made these I felt like I had been pepper sprayed while scraping out the seeds. Now I fill a clean sink with cold water and hold the peppers under the water while using a spoon to do the scraping. Also, when I saw the original recipe for this,it called for 22 large jalapenos, which I have found is the perfect amount everytime. I put out the ranch twice and no one used it. Needless to say I don't put it out anymore I find romano cheese has more of a bite to it which gives the whole thing a better flavor.

These are very good!  The cream cheese and sausage seem to lessen the bite of the Jalapeno.  I served these along with another type of cheese stuffed jalapeno and if you wanted the mild version this is the recipe that fit the bill.  Thanks it allowed me to accommodate everyone

These were a hit at our Christmas Eve party. It was the only dish that was completely gone at the end of the night. They are pretty easy to make as well! The only suggestion I have is to use gloves (I used non-latex) while prepping the jalapenos, so that you don't have to worry about getting any burns from the jalapenos. We have a toddler and I was very worried about getting any of the oils from the jalapenos on her, and the gloves were a great help.

I did this with red hot peppers, which are a little spicier than jalapenos (and way cheaper). One friend and I ate about a dozen each in maybe...four or five minutes? Delicious.

This recipe was great!  I used the leftover filling in mushrooms and both the peppers and mushrooms were a huge hit.  The peppers weren't very spicy but had good flavor. Will definitely be making these again!

Delicious! I used a mix of jalapenos and banana peppers, and I believe the banana peppers won the taste contest. I also wrapped these in half a piece of bacon because I could. These were so good on their own I did not use the ranch dressing.

Made this recipe twice.  First time, used a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  Bunched the stuffed jalapenos together so that they wouldn't fall over during baking.

Second time, used a roasting pan, and put the stuffed jalapenos between the grooves so that they wouldn't fall over during baking.

Stuffed jalapenos tasted good both times.  I used a milder sausage the first time, and a spicier sausage the second time.  I think I will
try making them again using a different cheese than Parmesan.

I made these, but unfortunately I did not have the cream cheese the recipe called for so I just made them without it.  Even with that missing ingredient they were incredible.  I am a single father of four children so I look for good tasting items for meals and this definitely fits that bill.  The kids are waiting for me to make them again because they were so good.  If you get a chance you have to make these.  They are great.

The flavor is amazing - I made two different versions, one with spicey Italian sausage and one with chirizo sausage. Both were excellent. Also added fresh basil, oregano, and green onions. The stuffing stays in the peppers unlike previous recipes that I have tried. These are so much easier and tastier than the bacon wrapped poppers!!

These are frickin delicious!  Not spicy just tasty!  When Jalapenos are cooked they are kind of like green chiles... have great flavor and these are a must try!  Made them for the first time for a party... they were a hit!  Go great with the Ranch dressing but really... what doesn't taste great with Ranch?  I will definitely make these again!  OH, be sure to get the shredded parm cheese... my hubby did not read the recipe correctly and used the grated stuff in the can... still turned out okay but were a little dry.  Would have been even better with the correct cheese... oops.  LOL

I love this recipe and have been making it as is for a few years.  I just took it to a potluck today and they were gone w/in minutes.  One person said they were the best stuffed peppers he's ever eaten, another hugged me after eating one and begged for the recipe, and word of mouth was so good that people who didn't get any were asking for the recipe.  Just wanted to let you know!  :)

You might try "TAMU" jalapenos as they are not as hot as regular ones. These TAMU were developed by Texas A &M University to be grown as a milder version. Also sold in some grocery stores. What a great recipe, baked, not fried!

Absolutely the best stuffed jalapeno recipe by FAR!  I'm so glad I found this recipe because I have made these several times since.  Perfect for Super Bowl parties and the like.  They disappear really fast.  You may as well have several copies of this recipe on hand whenever you serve them.  It never fails that people ask for the recipe.  Try these - you will love them.

These were a hugh hit with my family.  So easy to make and so good.  Even the picky eaters who say they don't like jalapenos, thought it was tasty.  My Dad said it was his favorite appetizer on Christmas Eve. Will make again and again!!!

These where a hit at a New Year's Eve party we went to.  Easy to make!  The only problem I had was the jalapenos available in our area this time of year are very small so I had alot of left over stuffing mix.

Fabulous!  I made these for my husband, as I don't really like jalepenos.  I tried them and LOVED them!  Instead of draining my sausage, I rinsed it off in a colander after browning.  I did need to add a tiny bit of salt because of that.    I will certainly be making these again!

I made these and also used mini sweet peppers for those who aren't as fond as spicy- NO RANCH NEEDED. they were a huge hit- so easy and so much flavor. I mixed 1/2 hot and half mild Jimmy Deans sausage. this is my new go to recipe!

Fantastic recipes for a company potluck. They ate 'em up! And not too spicy for anyone in the group.

I have made this treat several times for various events.  I made it this past weekend for a tailgating appetizer and was worried that the pepper would get mushy before they were eaten, but I was wrong!  They were great and EVERYONE loved them!  I even had someone tell me they were on his 'TOP 3 best apps of all times' list!!  PS I added a little garlic in while I was browning the sausage this last time and they were awesome!

Loved these peppers!  I like my pepper a little more "done", so I precooked them in the microwave for about 4 minutes, let them cool down and filled them...popped them under the broiler for about 5 or 6 minutes and served them---fantastic! They were super spicy but we kept going back for more until they were gone :)

Very simple and tasty. I kept the seeds for half of the jalapenos just to give it a little heat.

We were looking for something new and exciting for the July 4th celebration we have each year.  I can tell you this recipe was a "hit with the crowd"! Never mind all the other food we had or the grill BBQ'in chicken, brats, etc... everyone wanted these Stuffed Jalapenos.  They were fabulous and "Gone in 60 Seconds"

These were delicious and easy to make.  I had quite a bit of extra stuffing left over as mentioned in previous reviews.  Also felt mine needed a bit of salt as well.  Family really enjoyed them and and I would definitely make again.

I love this recipe and everyone I make it for loves it even more.  It's the first thing gone no matter how many I make.  They tend to get greasy, so I bake them on a rack so they don't end up sitting in all that grease.

These were really good.  I put the pepper halfs in the over for 10 minutes before stuffing.  Also, I advise wearing some rubber gloves while cleaning the peppers.  I have been done cooking for a couple hours and my hands are still on fire.

My husband and neighbors loved these and they were so easy to make.  I made one batch blanced peppers and one batch without blanching and they tasted the same to me.  Thanks for the great recipe just in time for football season snacks.

I combined this recipe with the Stuffed Jalapenos III recipe and wrapped bacon around the outside of the jalapeno.  It was a HUGE hit and I was asked for the recipe by half a dozen people.  Thanks for sharing it.

These take a little effort to put together. If I had a melon baller it would have been a lot easier to scoop out the insides. They are worth it though, they taste awesome.

These were excellant and a big hit. I like things spicy so I used hot/spicy sausage and I used a combination of shredded parmesean and mozzerella cheese.

I would give this 4 1/2 if I could.   The stuffing is enough for 2lbs of peppers.   I did not think this was super spicy.   I used low fat cream cheese - I would be interested to see how it would be with turkey sausage.

These were really good. The reason I didn't give it an extra star was because, even though they were very good, I have had better.  I halved the recipe and used 12 medium peppers.

I liked the heat on these, but I didn't like the cheese. I was thinking it would be more cheesy...like pizza. I think I will add shredded cheese next time.

These are great!! They get eaten up right away!! Amazingly, they aren't hot. Definitely can use 2lbs of peppers though for the amount of stuffing it makes.  This also works well stuffed in mushrooms.  Delicious!!!

These poppers are fantastic!  I used lowfat sausage and lowfat cream cheese - if there is such a thing - and they weren't greasy at all.

These were really good, but just a tad bit too greasy, due to the sausage.
