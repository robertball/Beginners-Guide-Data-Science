Very good recipe but I would skip the cocoa and use all chocolate bars. I've made this many times and find that using cocoa gave the cake a grittier, more brownie-like texture. So I now use 2 full bars of Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chocolate (8 oz. total) and skip the cocoa powder completely (ADD 8-10 min. cooking time). I still use the same amount of sugar. Using ALL chocolate bars gives this a silkier texutre not to mention a stronger chocolate flavor. 4 stars as written, 5+ stars for slight alteration.  Serve with fresh sliced strawberries or raspberries and a dusting of powdered sugar for a dessert made for company.

I prepared this recipe about a week after trying it at a fancy restaurant. Without a doubt, flourless chocolate cake is yet another food that I previously thought was a high-end, 'classy' dessert that I could only get at the most expensive places. 
This version has it dead-on; it is absolutely scrumptious and luxurious. 
It should be noted that I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels and Splenda, and it still came out excellent!

This was o.k.and makes for a very quick last minute dessert. However, the cocoa gave it more of a brownie taste than a chocolate cake/torte. There simply is no substitute for chocolate, LOTS OF IT!  Therefore, Flourless Chocolate Cake 1 from this site is the hands down winner of the Flourless Chocolate Cake duel. For an elegant dinner party, make Cake I. For a quicky for the kids, make Cake II.

Made this in mini muffin tins and topped with Hard Chocolate Glaze as suggested by AzMelody. Be sure to grease and dust your tins with cocoa powder or they won't come out of the pans. A bit time consuming but well worth the extra effort. I made these a week early, froze them and frosted the day before the party. They were a big hit.

Wonderful!  Absolutely delicious.  I had a gluten-intolerant guest over for dinner last night.  She said this was the best gluten-free cake she ever had.  The other guest went crazy for it as well.  I don't have a double boiler, so I just melted the butter over low heat in a saucepan, and then added the chocolate.  I divided the batter into 3 4" springform pans (although, I think I might use 4 next time; each serving was really huge), using pam and cocoa powder on them before putting the batter in.  They popped right out after they had cooled.  I turned them upside-down to get a flat surface and then drizzled chocolate ganache over them and topped with piped whipped cream and fresh quartered strawberries.  It looked very elegant and tasted just as good.

Excellent.  Very rich.  Very simple to make.  I didn't use a double-boiler.  I used the microwave to melt the chocolate & butter.  Turned out perfect.  Small slices with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, some strawberries and whip cream.  A big hit!

This was the easiest flourless chocolate cake I ever baked, and tasted just about as good as the more complicated recipes.  I baked two for a party and, since I had only one springform, I used a regular 8 inch cake pan for the second cake.  It was very hard to get the second cake out of the pan, so next time I will use my mother's trick and line the bottom of the greased pan with a circle of wax paper before I pour the batter in.

This recipe is fantastic!  We poured it into a cupcake pan instead of a cake pan, made a simple choclate ganache (heat up cream or half & half and stir into chocolate chips) and created restaurant-quality chocolate lava cakes.  I highly recommend trying this recipe!

I have made this recipe multiple times and it always gets rave reviews.  My boyfriend even requested this as his birthday cake!  I don't have a double boiler, but I used a saucepan over low heat to melt the butter and chocolate.  My favorite, very slight variation is to bake as 10-12 cupcakes (no alteration to ingredients) -- it makes perfect single portions.  Excellent when topped with a small scoop of mocha almond fudge or coffee ice cream (not so much as to overshadow the cake itself).  Amazing for being so simple to make.  Thanks so much!

Lovely! I used a 9 inch pan, so it came out a bit thin, but considering how rich it is, that is probably just fine. Also, I added 1 tsp. of espresso powder to enhance the flavor of the chocolate. This is extremely easy, and if you like chocolate, this is the recipe for you. I can't imagine it not turning out. I lined my pan with parchment paper greased and cocoa-powdered, and it came out like a dream.

This is a Very Rich Cake. Something you don't want to eat very often.  BUT, when you do, it is DELICIOUS. It is a very dense cake as well. If you want a Lighter cake:

1. Separate the egg whites from the yokes and place in separate bowls.

2. Whip the egg whites until they are fluffy and form stiff peaks(DON'T OVER BEAT)

3. Whisk the YOKES into the warm chocolate mixture one at a time.

4. Follow by FOLDING with a spatula the egg whites 1 scoop at a time until everything is incorporated.

this will get you a fluffier cake. some people like it dense so do as you like...

GREAT RECIPE!!

We love this recipe!  Our son is going gluten free because of stomach problems, and we really missed brownies and cakes. No more! This is amazing!  And so easy...We make this in a 4 cup measuring cup. First, we melt the butter and chocolate chips (1/2 bag) in the microwave and stir it til smooth,  then we add all the other ingredients on top, mix it up and pour it in the pan. It does not get any easier than that!  Thanks Shana!

Oh! My! Goodness!  This cake is amazing!  I made it for Thanksgiving dessert for a relative who has celiac.  I'm so glad I did.  I scaled it to 12 servings and baked it in a 9" pan (in response to the reviewer who said it was flat), but used more like 10 oz of chocolate--Ghiradelli's bittersweet chocolate. And by rounding up, I also rounded up the egg to 5 total. After adding the sugar and cocoa, I beat it with my mixer, adding the eggs one at a time.  It ended up the consistency of cake batter.  I lined my cake pan with waxed paper, which I dusted with cocoa. And, I baked it in a water bath.  I covered it with a ganache, not because it needed it, but because it made it prettier.  Ohhhhhhh, this is wonderful.  Thanks for such a great recipe, Shana!

I have made this twice. The first time I made it just like the recipe called for. It was SO good. The second time, I bought a pre-made oreo pie crust, and filled it with the cake batter, then right before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled the top with chocolate chips. I baked it for 40 minutes. IT WAS INCREDIBLE!! The mix of all the different chocolates was great! I highly recommend trying it this way

The taste of this cake was very good, however I wish I would have read more reviews before making it this first time. As others have said, the 30 minutes was not long enough to bake it.  I trusted the recipe and didn't know what it was supposed to look like when 'done', so I took it out after 30 mins. Big mistake.  After 10 minutes cooling and turning it out on a rack, it was obvious it was not done in the middle at all.  I put it back in the pan and oven at 325 for 20 minutes, but that didn't really help much.  Since it wasn't really done when I took it out of the pan, part of it stuck.  I will make this again, because the taste & ease of making it was great, but I will either modify the time, temp or both to higher and longer. I gave it 4 stars because I think the instructions are defective, and they should say to bake it 30 to 40 minutes and give some sort of test for doneness, such as a clean toothpick.

After reading the reviews, I made the following changes:  Used 8 oz of semisweet baking chocolate and eliminated the cocoa powder.  Separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites before folding into the rest of the mixture.

I brought this to a dinner party last night and served it topped with whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  Not a crumb was left and everyone wanted the recipe!   We paired this dessert with a bottle of 7 Deadly Zins wine from Sonoma Valley which turned out to be an excellent pairing!

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, Shana!

Excellent! Note: the way to avoid the graininess of the cocoa is to SIFT it into the batter. It comes out smooth as silk and has that added richness that the chocolate bars alone can't deliver!!! I also made it in a springform pan, cut a piece of wax paper to fit, sprayed it with Pam and dusted it with cocoa. No problem inverting onto another plate. Cooked it at 375 degrees for 20 minutes in my convection oven.

Update: I made this again and covered with Shiny Chocolate Glaze and sugared raspberries. / This was so easy and so good. I tossed strawberries in a bit of sugar earlier in the day and served them on top.

Excellent taste and texture.  I was in the mood for something exotic, and so I added 1/4 t cinnamon and 1/4 t red pepper.  (Might try 3/8 t of each next time.) I served the pieces on white plates, drizzled chocolate syrup over the plates, and garnished with whipped cream and sliced strawberries.  Definitely a hit.  :-)

I find this cake to be very pleasing as a relatively traditional flourless chocolate cake.  It is very dense and rich, with nice texture.  Enjoy sliced with berries and unsweetened whipped cream.  I have used this recipe in the restaurant where I work and it is always a hit.  
Chef's tip, be sure to avoid over mixing or under mixing the cake batter.   Mix just until everything is fully incorporated.  I have probably made this about 20 times, and always turns out.  I don't recommend the "custom versions".

This is a great, quick recipe. I portion the batter into 8 ramekins and serve without turning the cakes out. There's room in the ramekin for a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Like eating a brownie/hot fudge sundae.

I had this dessert in a restaurant and really enjoyed it, so looked up recipes to try to bake it myself.  I tried this recipe just because it was quicker than the cake I version.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out beautifully.  The texture was exactly what I was looking for.  Other reviewers have compared it to a brownie but I do not agree with this at all.  It is dense, moist, intensely chocolatey and just the right amount of sweetness.  And simple as can be to make!  I saved even more time by melting the chocolate and butter in the microwave, and I lined the pan with a circle of parchment paper, then sprayed with Pam and backed for 30 minutes- no trouble at all turning it out onto a rack after 15 minutes cooling time. This recipe definitely goes into my winning line-up!

I love this cake! I am trying to follow a low-carb lifestyle and HAVE to have chocolate every now and then. I followed the recipe except that instead of sugar I used 1/3 cup Blue Agave Necter (it's an all natural sweetner used in place of sugar, can be bought at any health food store) and it turned out wonderfully! Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Will definetley be making this again when I'm having a chocolate craving.

Awesome cake.  Used semi-sweet chocolate chips and quickly melted them in microwave with the butter.  Used eggs laid same day and separated the whites and beat them until peaks formed then folded them into the rest of the blended ingredients. Baked it in my toaster oven for 35 minutes.  Finished it after it cooled with sifted powder sugar.  Next time I will have fresh picked raspberries and whipped cream to serve with it.  If I hadn't forgotten to buy flour for the pantry, I never would have found this recipe.

Recipes like this are the reason I like this site so much.  I bake a lot but had no idea how to make the flourless chocolate cake my husband likes in restaurants - I even thought I might buy one, but it was easy to achieve perfection!  I read these reviews, and thanks to one who said the cocoa imparts a brownie flavor, I omitted it and used half a bag of semi-sweet chips and small box of TJ's dark chocolate valentines truffles (recommend seasonal clearanced chocolate = cheap and fresh). So I cut down the sugar, melted chocolates and butter in the microwave. Stir OFTEN and keep water away from melting chocolate. Baked in a spring form pan using spray and cocoa on the bottom, but I did have to bake it honestly 20 minutes longer to set at such a low temperature.  Voila - fantastique! Also divine reheated in microwave for 15 seconds.

This is so chocolatey and gooey and delightful!  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top and cut it into 16 bars.  Mmm.

Exceptionally easy! I followed one of the instructions and left the cocoa powder out, and the cake turned out really smooth and chocolatey. Topped it with raspberries and almonds (almonds only because I did not have powdered sugar). I will definitely make this again.

Easy, quick and delicious dessert.  Just be sure to grease the pan very well and wait until the cake has completely cooled before you try to take it out of the pan.

I made this recipe *exactly* as directed (though I found it unnecessary to use a double boiler by first melting the butter then adding the chocolate and stirring off the heat).  *Very* easy and it tastes *fantastic!*  I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and weighed them to make sure I used the right amount.  Very chocolatey and not over-sweet.  Great on its own but I look forward to trying it with whipped cream and raspberries.  But... apparently this recipe needs more than 30 minutes in my oven.  I baked the cake for 30 minutes and (as one reviewer suggested) ignored the fact that it still seemed a little gooey in the middle.  I let it cool 10 minutes in its pan (as directed) and then turned it out onto a cooling rack... only to see the middle fall as the center dripped through the cooling rack onto my counter.  Oh well!  I'll try again... I can already tell from a sample of cake at the edge that was fully cooked that it's worth it!

Can't believe I forgot to rate this, it is great!!! Perfect for Passover, but only for serious chocolate lovers (otherwise the flavour may be too intense). I much prefer it to the other flourless chocolate cake recipe on this site, it uses much less chocolate, requires much less work and it's very yummy!!

This was so delicious and so easy! I topped it with Hard Chocolate Glaze (http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/HardChocolateGlaze.asp). See the picture accompanying the recipe to view the yummy result. I'm making one of these tonight to take to my Celiac support board meeting tomorrow :)

Was THE best cake we've had! Substituted Coconut Oil for the butter (use 50% of the amount called for) and raw cane sugar (and cut it down to less than half of what was called for). Frosting was coconut oil, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Top it off with fresh raspberries and you have our new fav dessert!  

I live in Switzerland so we have fabulous baking chocolate here and used virgin coco oil brought in from the US.

THANK YOU- this was fabulous and easy and I'm making it for the second time now!  Let's see how it turns out...

Oh my my, this was WONDERFUL and I made some very low calorie changes!  (This was hard for me to do since I LOVE the real stuff!)  I used 1/4 C. unsweetened applesauce for the additional 1/4 C. butter, All Splenda for the sugar,  and Egg Beaters for the eggs.  This changed the calories from 285 per slice to 113 per slice!  It turned out fantastic!  The only thing I think would make it even better is to use Truvia or Stevia instead of Spleanda since I have heard it they do not leave any after taste at all.  For me, the tiny bit of an after taste of the Splenda (even if there was one?) was worth shaving off all those calories.  What a fantastic recipe worth making either way you choose.  Delicious warm or cold.  So dense and moist it really does not need any kind of topping at all.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful treat with us all!

This made a wonderfully decadent birthday treat for a wheat intolerant friend.

I used 3/4 cup chocolate chips instead of baking squares, and substituted coconut oil for butter (1:1). Coconut oil also came in handy for greasing the springform pan, which I then dusted with cocoa powder.

This came out like a (thin) moist and very rich chocolatey brownie. Great topped with a dusting of powdered sugar and served with vanilla ice cream and a few fresh strawberries.

This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Before I baked this I read most of the reviews. I used unsweetened Ghirdelli chocolate and 1/2 cup each of both white and light brown sugar. I added 1 1/2 t vanilla and then separated the eggs. I melted the choc. and butter in the microwave then whisked the egg yolks and sugar until lemon colored and thick. Then I mixed in the melted choc/butter. I sifted the cocoa and whisked the egg whites until soft peaks formed. I then folded the cocoa and egg whites alternately until thoroughly blended. I baked it in a pie dish to make it more of a torte and baked for 22-25 mins. Cooled it in the pie dish and decorated it with a white chocolate ganash. then dusted lightly with a mixture of 1 t cocoa powder and 1 t powdered sugar. Served it with vanilla bean ice-cream when still warm and it was lush-ious! Not a crumb left!! My husband raved about it so I will definately be making this again!

I followed the modified directions which say to omit cocoa (I find it grainy ) + add 4 oz of chocolate. I used good Ghirardelli chocolate and followed the directions otherwise.  On a side note: I don't understand how this works w/o tempering the eggs, but I tried it and it just separated in the egg...    I have professional baking experience and I feel that I did this correctly, but something just wasn't good about this. In fact, my husband said it was "Awful" and he would never make it again. Greasy, dense, tasted like an underbaked brownie. I'll continue looking for other recipes. Not good. Too bad.

This was my first time making a flourless chocolate cake and it turned out really rich and chocolaty and delicious. However, next time I will use wax paper on the bottom of the pan (in addition to the grease and cocoa dusting), because even after cooling it for 12 minutes, it still stuck to the bottom and came out in pieces :(   It still tasted great though.

Made this for a friends birthday and added crushed mini peanut butter cups to the top.  Then mixed up Chocolate ganache and peanut butter glazes (both recipes from Allrecipes.com) and decorated top of cake with a criss cross pattern.  I think the men loved it more than the women.  The cake lasted less than an hour!

This is the first time I was ever "WOW"ed enough to want to sign up and post a review.  I wanted to make my friend a cake for her birthday, but all I had around was whole wheat flour.  Haven't found a satisfactory chocolate cake recipe for whole wheat, so thought I would try this.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a glass pan(next size down from 13x9), as well as subbed chocolate chips for the chocolate.  And I used organic evaporated cane juice in place of sugar.  Baked it longer of course.  WOW!  I really wasn't expecting much, but this was AWESOME!  Cross between cake and brownie.  Just great.  Did I mention that it also is the EASIEST cake I have ever made in my life?  I bake a lot.  This is E-A-S-Y!

I used this cake as a base layer, added a layer of peanut butter mousse (mixed 8 ounces cream cheese, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 14 oz sweetened condensed milk, and 1 cup cool whip), and then covered with the "Chocolate Ganache" recipe from this site.  It is very rich but very very good!

Definitely use a spring form pan! I used a regular, non-stick cake pan, sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled with cocoa powder (as directed) and the cake fell apart when I tried to turn it out. I was able to salvage it by pouring the Hard Chocolate Glaze (recommended by reviewers) over it, which acted like cement and filled in the cracks. The glaze saved the day! Flavor was awesome and I'll definitely make again!

just made this recipe - used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of chocolate and cocoa - as per some reviewers advice. 
so.. I ended up having to bake it and extra 50 MINUTES for a toothpick to come out clean.. at which time my bf asked if it was burning.. i took it out, it was beautiful,cooled it for 15 minutes and it had sank a tremendous amount. it came out fine (with parchment, grease and cocoa, and to my surprise - the bottom edges were burnt and the middle was gooey & wet.i am a trained culinary student and i have a brand new 36" gas convection oven.. so its not bc of lack of experience or a weak oven. not sure what happened here. very disappointed.

I made this for the first time last night for an 8 person birthday dinner. The British birthday girl is historically hard to please when it comes to desserts as she does not really like sweet, sugary things. When I saw the number of people I thought the cake wasn't going to be enough, but it turned out to be the perfect size. I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate squares (cheaper at Marshall's than the grocery) which turned out to be a very good choice. When I was dislodging the baked cake from the pan to the cooling rack, it cracked in the top a little which led to my decision to frost it -- another a good choice. I melted 4 more squares of Ghiradelli and some butter and topped it off. I meant to get raspberries to garnish but forgot so I snipped a few petals of beautiful sage out of my garden and put it in the center. It was lovely and I told the birthday girl it was a metaphor for her wisdom. After the first bite the hard-to-please birthday girl told me it was "excellent" and "better than (her chocolate cake)" which was followed by several similar compliments by the other guests. I was so pleased. The cake was so easy to make and it turned out to be beautiful, decadent, and gourmet-like. I plan to make this recipe a default for future special occasion cakes.

I made this with only two changes : used 8oz. of semi-sweet chips instead of squares and cocoa powder. (what I had on hand) I sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top of the cake before baking. I chose not to frost the cake although I did drizzled melted chocolate to create a beautiful cake. Got great raves from my bible study group. They requested I make this cake again. Thank you for a fabulous recipe.

This is great - and easy.   I beat the egg whites separately and fold them into the batter.  I made this as cupcakes and baked them for 20- 15 minutes.  Watch them closely to be sure you don't over-cook.  The middle will sink - fill it with ice cream and serve hot!

This cake has become a holiday favorite in my household.  I always serve at our Christmas Eve dinner.  Everyone is always super impressed and would never guess how simple this is to make.  I double the recipe and bake in a 10" springform pan.  I have never felt the cocoa powder compromises the texture, which is smooth and velvety.  Cover with chocolate ganache and serve with raspberry sauce, whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, or all of the above.  Absolute chocolate decadence!

This is my first ever flourless cake.  Make sure you LOVE semi sweet chocolate before you make this. It also helps to LOVE slightly undercooked brownies,too. It was good, very rich & fell apart if cut into too large a piece. The cake does not rise much. I cut it into about 1" pieces so it would stay together. The flavor & texture are good; just remember, it is not your typical chocolate cake. It would be great with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream to counter balance the intense chocolate flavor.

WOW!  Made this (one day ahead) for Mother-in-laws birthday party last night.  Super easy, and incredibly delicious (covered it with semi-sweet ganache "icing" (chilled 30 minutes in freezer, then whipped), and decorated with 12 pecan halves near the edges, all facing inward like the numbers on a clock).  For cake, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips melted in the microwave (gradually) with the butter added half way through melting.  Mixed in other ingredients and poured/smoothened into cake pan, oiled and dusted with Cocoa.  It came out EASILY and carved/served EASILY. Poured/spread ganache after it came to room temp, then placed pecans, and refrigerated overnight. PERFECT and OH SO DECADENT! Will make it again for a dinner party this weekend.

My niece has a gluten intolerance so I try to find desserts she can eat.  This has far and away been the easiest of the flourless chocolate cakes I've made and it's incredibly rich and decadent.  I also have a super-simple chocolate glaze recipe that I use instead of frosting it.  Whoa!!  I will say that I had to increase the temp a little because the first time i made it after 30 minutes the inside was basically soup.  But this was a big hit and a keeper!

INCREDIBLE!!! I took the suggestion of using more chocolate bars (8 oz total) and omitted the cocoa powder. Defintely takes a lot longer to bake than the recipe states (and I have a new oven), so be patient :) I made individual cakes in ramakins ( sprayed Pam on them vs. using cocoa powder) for my guests and finished it off with a a smudge of whipped topping and a couple raspberries for garnish/color. No frosting needed. INCREDIBLE!!!

We made a few changes to this recipe and LOVED the result! We substituted 1/2 cup honey for the white sugar, and made our own baking chocolate by combining 3 Tbsp cocoa with 1 Tbsp butter for every ounce that was required. The result was an incredibly chocolatey smooth cake that came out of the oven with its own frosting. It had a melt-in-your-mouth texture and did not sit on the counter very long! We ate ours without whip cream or ice cream, and loved the intense chocolate taste. We will definitely be making this recipe again!!

I made this cake for Easter for my cousins young children who all have a gluten allergy.  I took others advice and used 8oz. bittersweet chocolate instead of the cocoa powder.  The cake was a little tricky to get out of the pan, even though I had greased it and dusted with cocoa powder.  The cake itself however was fabulous!!  It has a great consistency like cheesecake and everyone loved it.  A little chocolatey for the kids, but with extra whip cream and strawberries even they wanted seconds.  It was easy to prepare and I highly recommend this recipe!  Definitely a keeper.

This was good, but was much more fudge-like than true flourless chocolate cake.  I used all chocolate bars instead of cocoa as one reviewer suggested, but had to add WAY more cooking time.  At 25 extra minutes, cake was still runny/gooey in center.  I would say if you're using all chocolate/no cocoa, cook time should be at least 1 hour.  Good, rich flavor though - everyone liked it at book club, but I'm searching for a more traditional flourless consistency.

I've made this twice since I found the recipe a month ago, and it has gotten rave reviews both times. It's very easy to whip up. I made it in a white ceramic tart pan and found that I had to bake it 10 or 15 extra minutes before a toothpick came out clean. I just left it in the pan and dusted the top with some powdered sugar, and it looked beautiful. I buttered and dusted the pan with cocoa powder, and the slices came out no problem.  I think some of the people who were disappointed with this recipe read "cake" and were expecting some kind of fluffy layer cake. But flourless chocolate cake is supposed to be dense, like a fudgy brownie with a much more sophisticated chocolate flavor. Don't make this expecting to layer and frost it like a birthday cake. Just the thought of that makes my heart flutter in fear of death by chocolate.

I've lived on a gluten-free diet for several years now and love that this cake is both easy and delicious. Normally gluten-free cooking involves a lot of chemistry, mixing flours and crazy ingredients, with variable results. Not so here. It doesn't require complex flours and always turns out well. I've made it for gluten-full friends who loved it. For variation, top with caramel sauce (the kind from jar works fine) and fresh strawberries.

Unbelievable!  Absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  I accidentally baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes and it turned out perfect (I live in Colorado so baking time/temp is different).  I served it with sweetened whipped cream and everyone loved it.  Thank you so much for sharing.

If you love chocolate this is great- I used chocolate chips because I had them on hand- and I sprinkled a few extra on the top before baking. I also had a hard time getting it out of the pan- so it didn't look pretty but tasted great. Make sure to have a glass of milk on hand because this is really rich!

This recipe was amazing!! Everybody loved it!! I followed other suggestions and made with all dark chocolate and omitted cocoa powder. I also added peanut butter glaze from this site which I drizzled over the top of the chocolate ganache also from this site. It was really good warm but better cold!! Put leftovers in fridge and tried next day......WOW gooey goodness!!! Thanks!!

This was so easy, and a perfect gluten-free dessert for a simple salad bar lunch....I followed the directions almost exactly. But I forgot to turn the cake out to finish cooling on a rack. So it was hard to get the first piece out!  I think next time I make this, I will put a piece of waxed paper or parchment paper on the bottom of the pan, then grease and use the cocoa powder on top of the paper. My husband liked this cake so much, he is going to make enough of them to serve 100 people at a community New Year's Eve dinner! He is planning on dribbling carmel sauce on the plate, add the piece of cake, and put a dollop of whipped cream on top!

While I've made better flourless chocolate cakes this was still easy and incredible tasting! The other recipes call for so much more chocolate and are more expensive to make. This one goes together about as fast as any box mix would (I melted the chocolate and butter together in the microwave at 50% power for about one and a half minutes, stirred until the chocolate was completely melted, then stirred the rest of the ingredients into that bowl, and had only one bowl to clean).  My boyfriend absolutely loved this! I used 4oz Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate, which I think was really good in this and I prefer it to the semisweet- I believe a chocolate dessert is only as good as the quality of chocolate used, and Ghirardelli's bittersweet is the most affordable and readily available of my favorite chocolates. We made this at my boyfriends house and he had Hershey's cocoa powder (I usually use Dutch processed from Penzy's, but this was very good, and I will use it again) and only a 9" cake pan, so I reduced the temperature to 275 degrees because the batter was thinner in the pan. The results were rich and decadent and extremely chocolaty. We put some whipped cream on top. It was great warm, but I liked it even better cold the next morning. He took the rest to his son in a care package to take back to school with him. Now I have to make another one! Like I mentioned above, I really appreciate how inexpensive this is to make. Thanks so much!

Absolutely delicious!  One of my goals, after being diagnosed with Celiac's Disease, was to adapt all my favorite family recipes to be gluten free.  When I read this recipe, it provided me the basis for modifying my family’s Texas Sheet Cake recipe.  

Here are the changes I made to turn this flourless cake recipe into my version of Texas Sheet Cake.  #1 – I doubled everything in the recipe with the exception of the eggs.  I only used 3 eggs.  #2 – I melted the butter and chocolate (I used semi-sweet chocolate chips) in the microwave.  #3 – I used Mexican vanilla in the batter instead of regular vanilla.  #4 – I poured the mixture into a small 16x11 sheet pan (lined with parchment paper, greased with butter and dusted in cocoa powder) and baked as directed.  

#5 – Instead of topping with ganache, I used this icing recipe.  1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional), 1 stick butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, 6 tablespoons milk, 1 pound confectioner sugar, 1 teaspoon regular vanilla.  Mix butter, cocoa and milk.  Heat over a low heat.  Remove and add sugar, vanilla and nuts.  Pour over cake and spread.  I now have a gluten free version of my families Texas Sheet Cake.  Enjoy!

I can't say enough about this recipe, but I made a couple of changes to make it even easier.  I've tried many flourless chocolate cake recipes, and this is IT.  I melted Nestle chocolate chips (semi sweet) instead of the squares in the microwave, in small time increments (20 seconds).  I then buttered, and dusted with cocoa my muffin pan.  I was able to get 9 inidvidual cakes.  I baked for about 20 minutes until the tops puffed slightly. I cooled completely, and they turned out nicely.  Put them in the fridge, and then right before dessert,  a few days later, nuked them for about 15 seconds and topped with ice cream and chocolate shell.  Right out of a restaurant, and EASY.  Our friends loved them just as much as we did.

I made this cake for a friend, couldn't even give it to her.  The cake wouldn't come out of the pan.  It came out in pieces, which tasted like fudge, but such a mess!  I won't try this one again.

Parchment paper is a must - I greased and cocoa powdered my spring pan, and the cake still stuck to it so much that I could not serve it to company.

Very great gluten free option! I brought it to work as a tester and everyone loved it! My Gluten free friend hid the cake on the other guests.  Turned out more like a brownie though- not a cake.

I made this exactly as stated! I thought it was really good and chocolatey. I can't believe there is no flour in it! Even though it is perfect, I might try adding a Tbs. Of cinnamon or melted chocolate for an icing just to have something different every now and then but it really doesn't need changing. Will make again!

this was good in terms of super simple and totally squashed my out-of-nowhere-super-intense need for chocolate. 30 mins at 300 degs cant possible be the correct temp&time.. im kind of surprised only a few other reviews mentioned that. maybe my oven,thermometer,and timer all malfunctioned?? in any case, i kept this in for 30 mins at 300, and it was completely raw in the middle, kept it in for another 15 at 325. it was still a bit underdone at that point, but i just wanted my fix so i took it out. i  just made this but it seems like it will hold in taste for at least a week. Might even freeze a bit for when the next craving hits!

Very rich. I will cut back more on the sugar. Served with whipped cream flavored with almond extract, as well as fresh raspberries.

Fantastic. made this as a last minute birthday cake for my son when I found out one of my guests just told to avoid gluten. It was a huge hit. I did double the recipe, used regular Cadbury's milk chocolate and baked it (double the time) in a 9 inch cake tin. It rose beautifully and didn't flop. Sprinkled with icing sugar and served with cream or icecream. Will be a regular on the party menus here.

This cake is absolutely delicious--just as good as any flourless chocolate cake in a restaurant!  However, I had the same issue as some other reviewers: the cake was not done after 30 minutes in the oven.  I took it out after 30 minutes and after letting it cool in the pan for 10 minutes it still came out mushy in the middle.  Not to worry though--it was like eating chocolate pudding.  Next time, I will bake it a little longer.  Definitely worth your time to make it!

Very, very, good!  I tried the Trader Joe's cake and thought it was yummy and thought that maybe I could duplicate it - well this recipe puts TJ's to shame!  I haven't tried it with any of the mentioned toppings...but by itself, all the gals at my craft get together agreed it was the BEST.  Easy to put together - I used a springform pan to keep it simple!

A springform pan is a must!  I tried this first in a cake pan and destroyed it trying to get it out.  Then I used a springform pan lined with parchment, greased and sprinkled with cocoa - it was perfect.  It's tempting to over bake this but don't - it seems a bit raw when you take it out.  I used a bittersweet chocolate ganache and whipped cream (any fruit would be heavenly with this). My chocoholic friends raved about it and it was so easy!

Easy, easy, easy! I make this cake for dessert for company and everyone loved it. Melt the chocolate and butter together in the microwave on low heat to simplify even more. I paired the cake with Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting (also on this website) and added chopped pecans around the outer top edge then added two rows of Hershey's dark chocolate chips. It looked and tasted fantastic. Our friends left with both recipes and the next day I had to print both recipes for my son's friend's mother because he loved it so much.

This is good, but the texture was a little off for my tastes. It was a little crumbly and cakey, where I would have liked it to be more velvety and dense. I may have cooked it a little too long, as I did leave it in for 5 extra minutes. FYI, I used unsweetened chocolate squares (because that's what I had lying around) instead of the semisweet and it still tasted great.

A very quick and easy recipe.  I melted the chocolate and butter in the microwave, and it worked out great.  I used the springform pan, which was a good idea.  We sprinkled some powdered sugar and added a little whipped cream, and ate it rright up!

This was too die for.  So simple!!! I served it warm with three topping choices, fresh raspberry sauce, caramel sauce or double chocolate... everyone raved about it no matter which sauce they chose!

Will try making it again substituting splenda for the sugar to make it a little more carb-avoider/diabetic friendly.

This is not my very best flourless chocolate cake recipe, but it is good, simple, and all the ingredients are on hand.  My kids loved it. For the semisweet chocolate I used 3/4 c. chocolate chips.  As one reviewer suggested, I melted the chips & butter in a glass 4-cup measuring cup then just added the rest & mixed it together in that. It made it easy to pour into the muffin pan.  I used a silicone 12-cup muffin pan, set on a baking sheet for stability.  I lightly oiled the muffin cups, baked about 20 minutes, then took them out of the oven and let them rest in the pan 10 minutes. It worked great.  Thanks! UPDATE: This cake is MUCH better thoroughly chilled, the next day.

This was really simple to prepare and looked fantastic with a few raspberries and powdered sugar on top.  So fantastic, in fact, that it was being sold for 4 times the price of the other desserts at my daughters' school event that I took it to.  A winner!  I also increased serving size to 12 and put it in my springform with greased and cocoaed parchment on the bottom.

Amazing cake.  Can be eaten warm with ice cream or with fresh fruit.  Doesn't even need a frosting.  Some reviews mentioned the cocoa makes it gritty but I disagree.  No grittiness.  All my coworkers loved it.  Would not change a thing on this recipe.  It's perfect the way it is!

This was fantastic! Such a treat! Thanks to previous reviewers, I decreased the amount of cocoa (put in a heaping tablespoon instead of the 1/2 cup), and used 6 one-ounce squares of semisweet chocolate instead of 4. Lined the pan with parchment, and used Wilton cake release around the sides of the pan. Baked for 35 minutes, cooled for 10, and the whole cake was gone in the blink of an eye! We served it with whipping cream to make this dessert even more decadent! Thank you so much for sharing this gem!

I followed MommyFrom Seattle's recommendations. That made it delicious! Skip the cocoa and use all chocolate bars. I've made this many times and find that using cocoa gave the cake a grittier, more brownie-like texture. So I now use 2 full bars of Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chocolate (8 oz. total) or use one bar Bittersweet and one bar semi-sweet and skip the cocoa powder completely (ADD 8-10 min. cooking time). I still use the same amount of sugar. Using ALL chocolate bars gives this a silkier texutre not to mention a stronger chocolate flavor. Serve with fresh sliced strawberries or raspberries or vanilla ice cream and a dusting of powdered sugar for a dessert made for company.
Tried it with Satiny Chocolate glaze and it was great!

I am not sure what happened but I had some technical issues. After the cake cooled in the pan, I could not get it out. It was stuck to the bottom. It really tasted great but it was so heavy and moist it did not want to come out of the pan and completely fell apart. I must have done something wrong because this recipe has 5 stars...I greased and dusted the pan with cocoa powder and let the cake cool completely. Maybe I will try this again because it really tasted great despite it falling to pieces.

This cake was absolutely fantastic!  I took a chance and made this for the first time, for a Christmas potluck (without first testing it)... got nothing but rave reviews and requests for the recipe.
 (they even ate the crumbs off the plate).  :-)   Used the tip about using '2' 4-oz bars of Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and omitting the cocoa powder - baked in a 9" pan for the same amount of time in the directions.  I would DEFINITELY recommend using Bittersweet instead of Semi-sweet ~ more intense chocolate without being over-bearingly sweet.  I personally am a food (especially dessert) snob  :-)  ~  I was thoroughly impressed!  Would give this 20 stars if I had the option!

This cake is delicious and perfect for someone who can't eat gluten and I would recommend it to even those who can. To make it a bit healthier I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, substituted 1/2 cup canola oil for butter and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. The texture was heavenly and while it was less sweet with the reduced sugar, it tasted perfect to my palate. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have made this cake a couple of times now and it always turns out perfectly. I sometimes substitute cocoa powder and veg.oil for chocolate when I don't have any on hand. i like to top it with fresh whipped cream and berries. I have also halved this recipe with no problem. When I halve it I use it to make a thinner cake which I then use as base to a chocolate mousse cake. Great recipe!

WOW. This cake is AMAZING!!! Good solution for my Passover chocolate craving. I think it needed about another 7-10 minutes in my oven, and I would just oil the pan next time (no cocoa) as it didn't come out as easily as I liked. But it was so fudgy, so chocolatey, so delicious!!!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added twice as much chocolate and skipped the cocoa and added 5 mins of baking time. It had a lovely silky texture. I lined the bottom of the pan with a round piece of parchment paper and sprayed the pan with parchment and dusted with cocoa powder and the cake came out beautifully. I highly recommend baking it in a 6 inch pan instead of an 8 inch pan. In the 6 inch pan the cake was about an inch thick once baked, and would have been really thin in a larger pan. To decorate the cake: I cut the ends off a bunch of strawberries and stood them upright (cut side down), to cover the whole surface of the cake, and then sprinkled with icing sugar. It looked really pretty and was delicious!

Dense and rich, this is a less-is-better cake - we served thinner slices than a regular cake.  My family loved it!  Thank you!

This was great! I made a substitution, Peppermint extract because I was out of vanilla, and mixed peppermint extract with a tub of store bought frosting and frosted the cake. Then sprinkled crushed candy cane on top, great for the holidays! The only problem was the cake sticking to the bottom if the pan. Very moist and tasty though!

I made this cake for a girlfriend of mine who has stomach problems and cannot have gluten.  I made it exactly how the recipe says to and it was delicious!! I put the mix in mini muffin molds and they were like little brownie bites.  I even made a whipped cream cheese frosting to put on top and it was even better!! I recommend this recipe for anyone who is looking for a simple easy to make cake!

I just made this recipe today since I have a guest coming over tonight with wheat allergies and I must have done something terribly wrong! I used the 8 oz of chocolate squares and omitted the cocoa powder. Then I put the mix in a muffin pan which I had greased and dusted with cocoa powder. Then I baked them at 300 degrees for 30 minutes, and they came out very undercooked. So I put them in for another 10 minutes and I thought they were probably done. I stepped away to let them cool and came back to fallen cakes. They were falling in the middle. I cooked them a few more minutes and they are still very mushy. What did I do???

was in the need for some major chocolate therapy and it's left over night at my house so I decided to throw this together for dessert....I followed MommyFromSeatle's advice and used all chocolate instead of the cocoa, I only had semi-sweet on hand so I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. It came out perfectly!!! I don't have an 8inch pan so I used my 6inch and poured the rest into a muffin pan. Super easy and tastes like you'd pay big bucks for one slice at some fancy place...Mmmmmm!

I made this last nite for my friend's birthday. Most recipies for flourless chocolate cake look really hard, but that's what he wanted...then i found this one! I used a 9 in springform pan, so the 30 min bake time was perfect. I used semisweet chocolate chips instead of squares, but that seemed to work well. I'm not a big flourless cake fan but the birthday guy loved it and so did our other roomie! I reccomend this it was very easy.

I followed the recipe exactly and made 2 cakes.  Both of them broke into 3 or 4 pieces when inverting onto the cooling rack.  I pieced them back together and frosted.  I'll make it again but will use a spring form pan to ensure it stays in one piece.

Tasty. Could have been a little more presentable, but salvaged that with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site (prepared it on the thicker side- so it wasn't so runny).  Served with a raspberry sauce I made by cooking the berries with some sugar/syrup.  Will probably make it again.

Great recipe...i modified it for a low-carb/no carb version and worked out great. First attempt I followed the variations noted from other members subbing 8 oz dark chocolate for cocoa and splenda for sugar...came out quite bitter so 2nd time around I used 4 oz Sorbee brand 0 carb milk choc and 4 oz Sorbee brand 0 carb dark chocolate and a full cup splenda rather than 3/4 and baked within individual well greased ramekins for about 25 minutes. Turned out WONDERFUL so rich and chocolately without the bitter tinge the previous had. Love this recipe. For what I can tell this would be 100% carb free as the chocolate is sweetened with 100% sugar alcohols and indicates 0 sugar carbs. Am I wrong? If anyone knows better please do comment as it would be great to know if this really is 100% net carb free. Thanks!

I baked mine in a 10" silicone cake pan and put it in a cookie sheet with about 1" of water to help with the dryness. I greased and lined it with wax paper just to be sure and it turned out of the pan beautifully.  I do not recommend cutting down on the butter.   The center was perfect and if I had not tried to cut the butter a little I am sure it would have been good all the way round.  To be honest though I am partial to the Flourless Chocolate Cake 2 on this site.  I use my silicone cake pan on both recipes and they turn out wonderfully.  Thank you for this recipe.

Very dark and decandent.  My mother-in-law loves this so I made it for her.  She loved it.  It wasn't as smooth as I thought it would be, probably something I did.  Soooooooooooooo easy and delish!
Would make again.  I used a chocolate ganache from this site.

This dessert is THE BEST here on allrecipes in my opinion (and I have tried many here). Bake this in an 8" springform pan which has been coated with butter-flavored cooking spray, then dusted with sifted cocoa evenly. Use the 60% cocoa Ghirardelli bittersweet bar (it is 4oz.) to make this a dessert of quality. Top slices with the "Hot Fudge Sauce II" recipe here on allrecipes, except change that recipe to include only half of the evaporated milk suggested & add a little extra powdered sugar (and a little sifted cocoa) to the sauce to further thicken it up (I used melted black forest truffles for the hard chocolate called for in the sauce). To serve, place on slice on a plate, pour on some hot fudge, put a dollop of vanilla ice-cream on top, then more hot fudge, a few raspberries and a mint leaf. Beautiful & the richest chocolate dessert I have found EVER.

YUMMY! This is the first review I've given--this is SO yummy.  We have a friend with a daughter recently diagnosed with celiac disease, so I baked this cake this afternoon for their family. I had planned to make our family one, also, but forgot to buy more butter.  The cake smelled SO good--and my 10-year old sampled a tiny piece before I could tell him not to.  He was checking the cocoa powder, hoping it had wheat in it, so we could keep the cake!  I tasted a tiny bit, also--so, here are my conclusions:  I used milk chocolate chips (1/2 cup) because this family only likes milk chocolate.  I then reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, because of the sweeter chocolate. I also added a dash of kosher salt, and a tiny sprinkle of cinnamon (I always use cinnamon with chocolate). I baked it in a disposable pie pan, because I never remember to get my dishes back from friends.  It came out beautifully, and it is a very moist, dense chocolate cake-ish thing.  It has a much finer texture than cake, and is smooth and dense, but isn't gooey like undercooked brownies are.  So easy--definitely worth a try.

Delicious! I used 1/2 tsp. of vanilla, and 1/2 tsp of almond. So quick and simple to make. I used a recipe on here for the hard chocolate glaze. Tastes even better the next day, and cuts better/prettier about 6+ hrs after finished.

Yummy....delicious and RICH!  Craving chocolate cake, I stumbled upon this recipe - glad I did, because it's perfect.  So rich that after a few bites I was done (which is a GOOD thing!) and I was glad that I decided against the chocolate glaze that I had planned for this.  Went instead with some fruit and would do that again for this particular cake.  I don't own a double boiler, so I melted the chocolate and butter over low heat in a regular saucepan - stirring constantly.  Also, used chocolate chips and raspberry flavored cocoa mix since that was all I had and they worked just fine!  Thanks for a nice and easy chocolate cake!

Absolutely delicious! Wonderful texture and has a great flake on the top-I just dusted the top with powered sugar and it looked lovely.  I used Mexican chocolate instead of semi sweet; it’s a bit darker and adds that hint of cinnamon. I also recommend a dash of salt.

I have made lots of different chocolate flourless cakes before and this one was the most simple!  It was delicious and light, not as sweet as most of the ones I've made.  I topped it off with a thin layer of chocolate frosting and whipped cream - yum!

I am a true chocoholic, and this recipe was amazing! Served with a creme anglaise, it was elegant, simple -- and used items that every cook has on hand readily. The texture was soft and delicious -- warm slices 10 sec. in the microwave the day after. I added about two tblsp. of flour, though and got a more "cakey" consistancy. EXCELLENT recipe!

Very good, rich and easy to make. I made a couple adjustments: used 73% dark chocolate and 1/2 cup stevia/sugar blend. Next time around I will try skipping the cocoa powder and use all chocolate bar, as suggested by MommyFromSeattle.

Great recipe! Just like in the best  restaurants. I did modify slightly and also eliminated the cocoa powder and instead used a full 8 oz. of toll house dark chocolate morsels. Cooked for 40 minutes. The reviews of everyone was very helpful. My cake did stick so I used a fun heart shaped cookie cutter (it was valentines day) and was able to cut out 8 perfect single servings! So cute and garnished with a scoop of vanilla and fresh raspberries!

Little effort-Big reward. I used a spring form pan for easy removal and it was in the oven for 35 minutes. Dusted with icing sugar. This is a great one to make for company. So easy, super delish. Thx Shana Hillman

This is an easy great recipe.  I followed one of the comments and used 8 oz of chocolate instead of the cocoa.  It was super delicious.  I also served it with whipped cream that I made.  My family loved it!

I made this cake for a birthday at work....  I used a 9" cake pan and still took longer, about 40 min to bake.  Once cooled, I spread sugar-free raspberry jam over the top.  This was absolutely amazingly good!!  We cut it into 10 wedges, and for us, it was plenty and we have some left for another day...

I had to make my own semi-sweet chocolate with cocoa powder/xylitol/butter, I melted it then added the rest of the ingredients except for the extra cocoa which I completely omitted. Also I subbed xylitol for the sugar. Baked 300 for 40 minutes. Came out great!

This is the best dessert for a group of girlfriends ever!! I make this over and over and it is almost impossible to mess up. I do stir the whisked eggs in last to keep them from scrambling int he melted chocolate. This is a delicious, deep, dark chocolate!!

Absolutely sublime!  Made this for a gluten-free friend and loved it so much made it again the same week for a family birthday.  So decadent, deep chocolate flavor, silky texture - yep.  It's a keeper.  I had to substitute half bittersweet chocolate, half milk chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand, so I cut the sugar in the sugar-water mixture down by half.  I was worried it might be too sweet but nope, it was perfect!  Served with powdered sugar on top and a plum sauce on the side.  This cake was better than desserts I've had in fine restaurants.  My husband and I fought over the last piece lol! Highly recommend!

So easy.  Followed the directions exactly EXCEPT I heated the chocolate and butter on lowest heat in a sauce pan on the stove.  

Also,  glazed it with chocolate after.  I actually like it better chilled then hot.  

Delicious!

I've made this 2 different times and both times have required a longer cooking time than 30 minutes, closer to 40-50 min for me. I used a 9 inch round pan, maybe that's the problem?? Having said that, this is delicious!! Our oldest has a newly discovered wheat allergy and he LOVES this. This will be a recipe that's used several times.

Wonderful served with fresh raspberries.  I have tried other flourless cakes before and they are often dry and dense, this is rich and moist.  This recipe is a keeper and good enough for company.

Oh, my God!!! I was a bit skeptical about that recipe, I couldn't quite picture in my mind what that cake could taste like, but, wow! it is amazing. I just followed the recipe, and it turned out fantastic. The only thing I would change, next time, is bake it a little bit longer, when it was warmed over for serving, the middle was very soft.

Made this earlier today and it was amazing. I had to make my own semi-sweet chocolate, but after everything together, it was perfect. It does have a dense quality, but not that of a brownie, in my opinion. It's more like a Lava Cake. It doesn't really rise, but that's fine, because a little bit goes pretty far and has no problem curing my sweet tooth.

I took the advice of others & used 8 oz of semi sweet chocolate & left out the cocoa. Melted the butter & choc in the microwave in a 4 cup measuring cup & mixed in the other ingredients. Baked in a 9" cake pan at 325 degrees for 30 minutes. I greased & floured with cocoa & had no stick issues. I couldn't wait 10 minutes. I flipped it out of the pan after 5 minutes. I think I could have cooked for 5 more minutes as it was slightly gooey in places, but overall, it was awesome! Served with vanilla ice cream & a small amount of chocolate syrup. YUMMY!!!

Tried this recipe earlier today. Since my husband and I don't mind and have no problem with Gluten then I added 1/2 cup all purpose flour, thought it would give more volume. Turned out good, but I just feel it is a bit dry. I kinda regret putting flour, but it worth experimenting. Next time I'll try the recipe as it is.

Tasty! I omitted the 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, and added an additional 4 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate. I would recommend using an electric mixer to mix the ingredients to get a uniform consistency in this cake. I whisked and whisked and even in the bowl, it did not look like it was coming together. I poured the batter in a cake pan without using the electric mixer. The end results came out with areas of the dessert where you can see "sections" of cooked egg. It did taste fine. We ate it no problem, but visually seeing those gelatinous sections of cooked egg may turn some people off.

I made this for my brother, he is T2 diabetic and watching his carbs along with his sugar.  I subbed sugar free chocolate chips and Splenda.  It was wonderful!  Rich and chocolatey.  The top formed a crisp crust, it might have been the Splenda didn't melt all the way, but made it even better.  This will be his new go to dessert.

This recipe is so simple and so delicious and completely gluten free.  Anyone can make this. If you want to add a bit of a change to complement coffee or ice cream you can add a little flavoring.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  I'm making it again for a special dinner and adding hazelnut extract this time.

I have to give this 5 stars because I can't think of any reason not to. 

I practically licked my plate clean. I don't believe this cake rose at all (which makes sense with the lack of leavening agent). It was relatively simple to mix together. 

Gooey brownie-like texture. Rich flavor but delicious and not overpowering. Powerful flavor so you won't want to eat the whole cake but still be satisfied. Tastes like a lot of calories but its not. Would be great with fresh raspberries or raspberry sauce.

The best way for me to describe this would be costco muffins, triple chocolate cookies and the best brownies all wrapped into one. Love!

Oh and I baked for about 40 minutes, checking after 20 minutes with a thin blade.

I loved this, but made a few changes. I did 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of semisweet chips instead of the squares. I melted the chips and the butter in the microwave instead of the double broiler. Quicker and much easier for me. I garnish with cream cheese icing and sliced strawberries on top. Delicious and gluten free!

Wow! Need I say more !? A true Chocoholic will understand this comment. I made this for our New Year's Eve party (the night before) and it was amazing. One of our good friends cannot have Gluten so this recipe was perfect for her. All of the women indulged in this little piece of heaven.  The "cake" comes out very thin but as other reviewers noted, it is rich so don't worry. I heated it for 15seconds in teh microwave and added chocolate sauce and Vanilla ice cream, YUMMY! Based on other comments I left mine in the oven for 35 mins, not sure if this was really necessary. The cake is quite fragile so be careful when taking it out the tine. I used a disposable 8 inch tin and had no problems with sticking. Used parchment paper on the bottom and cocoa powder on the sides. Will make again in a heart beat. Very quick and easy to do, not a lot of ingredients.

So good! I made 1 1/2 batch and cooked it a little longer. It was smooth, not gritty at all, and perfect for my guests who could not eat gluten.

I make this alll the time, and it is always a major hit, for my husbands holidays, and my gluten free friend, I need to double the recipe to feed all, and it works.  I top it with whipped cream that I mix espresso into.

Making it today for a dinner party!

This recipe is very good.  However, the first time I made it, the cake wasn't cooked enough after 30 min.  I made another -- and it actually had to be in the oven for 1 hour before a toothpick came out clean.  Hence the three stars ...   Once I got it right, it was delicious!

Awesome!! Made it exactly as written. 
So simple to put together. I highly recommend it for any occassion. It can really be thrown together last minute, if you have the chocolate on hand.
I understand the comparison to a brownie, but....   
the texture is way different! It is silky and smooth. Decadent is the best word for it. It is to brownies, what a quality chocolate truffle is to a "candy bar". Both are good, but...

I try to never do this, but I had less than a tablespoon of cocoa powder so I had to make an adjustment. I followed another reviewers suggestion of all chocolate squares, so 8 in total. Ok, I lied, I also didn't have foil, so no water bath either..sheesh eh? I did use the the scant amount of cocoa i had to 'flour' the pan :-)  What I would like to say is this versatile and exceptional recipe, still turned out, rich, smooth and amazing served warm. I would do the hard chocolate glaze for company, just to pretty it up a touch, but casual and just for two, go ahead...eat it from the pan lol. Big thanks to the original poster, this is a 'top shelf' recipe if ever there was one.

Really yummy and low in carbs.   I used sugar free chocolate bars (chocoperfection) and also Splenda Sugar Blend (increased to 1/3 cup plus 2 T) and poured the batter into mini muffin pans.  They were very hard to get out though even though I did dust the pans with cocoa powder.  Next time I will spray the pans with Pam.

I made two of these and layered them with a fluffy white icing for my Mom's birthday, and it was a big hit. I was impressed that the cakes worked out so nicely because of the substitutions I made- I only had milk chocolate, used splenda, and substituted table syrup for vanilla. I was thinking about not using cocoa after reading other reviews, but ended up going ahead with it, and actually really liked the texture. Thanks!

This recipe is excellent - it wasn't brownie-like at all to me. It had a very smooth texture and nice rich chocolate flavor. I made a chocolate glaze and drizzled it over the cake and it worked great. I made the recipe as-is with no modifications.  Make sure to microwave it for 30 - 45 seconds before serving. It is incredible warm.

Ok it's true about the brownie thing people are saying. My problem with it was the cake turned out really really thin. Exactly how small does the baking tin need to be?! Tastes great though.

I just made this last night for a friend at work who has celiacs disease.  It was very easy to make - I followed the recipe exactly except that I used semisweet choc chips instead of squares.  I baked it for 30 min.  When I checked it - it appeared not done, so I left it in for another 5 min..  When I removed it from the oven it looked beautiful - however, upon cooling the entire thing sank to about 1/2 inch!!   I still served it here at work today and while it tasted great (very rich, sweet) - it was more like fudge than a cake.   I must have done something wrong - has anyone else had this happen?  The recipe says to bake at 300 - maybe it should be a higher heat??  I'd like to make this again but would like it to stay risen!

I eat gluten free and my friend introduced me to this cake when she had me over for lunch. I made it the following week because it is a chocolate lovers dream come true! True, it is a very dense cake, does not rise much, but it is so rich and when eaten straight from the fridge, tastes and has the texture of slightly softned fudge :). So good.

This cake was okay.  I used truvia instead of sugar and it came out crumbly and dry.  Perhaps I mis-converted the sugar required.  The texture and flavor were better after refrigerating overnight.

I followed this recipe as written and had problems removing it from the pan.  It was almost undercooked, but I trusted the recipe.  I could not get it out of the pan in 10 minutes cooling time, so I let it cool longer.  When I tried to remove it, it crumbled.  The taste was perfect for whom I made it, it tasted like dark chocolate.  She just ate it with a fork out of the pan.  Probably won't try this one again.

It was great. Real tasty. I used the version where with all chocolate no cocoa powder except to line the pan. It's what a flourless chocolate cake should taste like.

Simply delicious!!!  No frosting neeeded to taste absolutely yummy - but if you want to add a glaze or a dusting of powdered sugar it's great that way too.  I made this for a craft night at my house (no frosting) and it was a hit!  The gals couldn't believe the flour was missing from it!  Will be making this often at our house!

The only reason this is getting four stars instead of five is because I made it once as written and once with the suggestion to use all chocolate and increase the baking time 10 mins.  This second way is outrageously better than using the cocoa.

DELICIOUS!  I needed to make a gluten-free chocolate trifle, and this cake was perfect for the job.  It was like a super-fudgey-brownie cake, and was excellent when paired with the whipped topping, pudding and Kahlua in the trifle.  I used dairy-free margarine to bake the cake and it came out just fine.  Will definitely make again.

WOW!!! Family loved this and didn't even know it was gluten free! Followed suggestions of MommyFromSeattle and will definitely label this as THE chocolate cake to make when asked to make chocolate cake. I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder.  Topped with hard chocolate glaze recipe.  Very elegant looking and the glaze firmed up nicely.

This was delicious!! I didn't expect it to be so good. I've never baked a "flourless" cake before so didn't know what to expect. It is very rich and chocolatey. This was the dessert for my V-day dinner I cooked for my boyfriend and he loved it. It's brownie like but seeing how I love brownies I wasn't complaining. To offset the richness I served with Cool Whip and sprinkled w/ chocolate shavings. I will definately be making again.

This was dense and fudgy, but light at the same time, and just melted in my mouth with every bite! I might have undercooked it a bit (my oven can be a little slow) because it wouldn't come out of the pan, but we absolutely loved it!

followed reviewers advice and used all chocolate, no cocoa.  it was amazing- although i forgot to add 10 min to cooking time for using all chocolate.  so it was more like a mushy brownie.  but it still was amazing.  we also used 3/4 dark chocolate and 1/4 milk rather than all semi sweet. i think next time i'll use ramekins or cupcake tins- seems like it would be better out of a cup.   just remember to add 10 min cook time if you're using all chocolate!!  i made it again with 1/4 teas. cayenne pepper and a dash of cinnamon.  excellent!

Fantastic!  This was easy & delicious.  The flavor was rich & luscious.  I used a spring form pan & lined with parchment paper, dusted with cocoa.  It was easy to plate up.  Garnished with real whipped cream, fresh raspberries and drizzled with rasb. sauce.

Wow!  This is an awesome,awesome dessert.  My daughter is gluten intolerant, so I made this for her birthday with the chocolate ganache from this site (cut ganache recipe in half). After reading the reviews I decided to skip the cocoa and use all semi sweet  chocolate. For Christmas, I made a coconut topping by boiling 1/2 cup of heavy cream, removed from heat and added 12 or so large marshmallows until melted, and then added 5 oz of sweetened coconut.  After spreading this on the cake, I added the chocolate ganache on top.  If you love decadence and chocolate, this is the recipe for you.

I had a little trouble getting this out of the pan but I attributed that to not using cocoa powder to coat the pan (wanted it gluten-free).  I made the hard chocolate glaze from this site which set up fantastically, and then melted some seedless raspberry jam as a sauce for the plate.  I dusted a little powdered sugar over the top and put a few raspberries on the plate...simple, delicious, and elegant!

Good recipe.  I followed the reviewers suggestion to use all chocolate and omit to cocoa.  It took well over the suggested baking time in my oven. I baked the cake (with changes) for an additional 10 minutes....could have used 15 or 20.  But great flavour.  Will make again with the changes and increased baking time.

This is a great and very easy recipe.It came out from the pan perfectly when I made it, I didn't even use a springform. I just liberally greased (and dusted with cocoa powder) my non-stick 8" pan, although it is crumbly when sliced, but considering it's still a cake and not a fudge, I think it's perfectly fine. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good even without a topping. Thank you for sharing this!

I made this last night and it was wonderful! I also did not use the cocoa powder, but used half semi-sweet and half dark chocolate blocks. I used a drizzle of dark chocolate pieces melted into a little heavy whipping cream and then topped with whipped cream. It was exactly what I was craving.

This 'cake' is very much like fudge once it's in the refrigerator. My husband kept insisting is wasn't cake. But, he loved it. I served with vanilla ice cream and sweetened whipped cream and it was delicious. Gone in two days. I followed suggestions and used parchment paper to like my pan and greased it very well. The  cake came out very easily, although it broke when I placed it onto the serving dish.

This was really easy and absolutely delicious.  It was really rich and after taking it to a mothers day lunch, I cut up the rest into small pieces and put it in the fridge (as another reviewer suggested).  Now it is kinda like fudge, yum!  I also topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for taste even though the texture was a bit crumbly, but just amazing tasting so who cares.  I doubled the recipe and used a 10" springform pan.  As written it would make a very small cake.  I had to bake for just under an hour (about 55 min.). Many other reviewers poured glaze over the top but this is a VERY rich cake and for me it would be overkill. Instead I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and everyone thought it was fantastic.

I was searching for a recipe for a flourless type cake I had in Maui on my wedding night, trying to recreate for my one year anniversary.  This isn't exactly like that but this is SO yummy! A must for chocolate lovers and very very easy. I melted the chocolate in a sauce pan due to no double boiler and used dark chocolate.

I made this for a Seder supper, it was easy, didn't need any special ingredients and everyone loved it!  I went with the recommendation to skip the cocoa powder and add 8 oz chocolate instead.  Dense, rich, moist, very chocolaty.  Easily cut into 12 pieces.

I made this and it was the hit of a baby shower, however I did triple it and bake it in muffin cups, lined with paper which I peeled away after the cakes were cool. Each muffin cup was filled 1/4 cup of the batter and baked for 30 min, it yeilded 27 cupcakes. I did ice them with ganache, yummy and easy!

okay....so this cake is very FLAT....which is to be expected from one without flour I guess.  :)  it looks BEAUTIFUL though, an I just took a nibble off the dge and it tastes awesome too!  So, make this cake if you want to impress, but don't make it if you want a huge, enormous cake....

This cake is for serious chocolate lovers ONLY! I used extra dark chocolate and unsweetened cocoa powder, but added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar to compensate. Not only is it delicious, but it's super easy - even non-bakers can whip it up and look like they know what they're doing.

I made this recipe for a Passover Seder.  I think it came out just as it was supposed to, and it was very good...tasted exactly like undercooked brownies...but I wouldn't say it was the "end-all, be-all" dessert.  I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  Would I make it again?  Possibly, since it was very easy and fairly inexpensive to make.  But, as far as taste goes, I'm still looking for a Passover dessert that has that "Wow" factor.

Although it came out looking a little iffy, this cake was great tasting. Be sure to make sure the chocolate is cooled before adding the eggs, or in the end there will be bits of scrambled egg on top of the cake.

I made this in a small bundt pan.  When I took it out of the oven it was at least 2 inches tall, but it collapsed to about 1 inch.  Maybe flourless cakes always do that.  But it tasted fabulous.  I used Ghiradelli's 60% cocoa bittersweet choc chips, and a local brand of cocoa powder.  I received rave reviews!

I made this for work where we have a guy who's allergic to gluten. It turned out really good! Everyone loved it. Only thing I would do differently next time is maybe use a sweeter chocolate like milk chocolate, but that's just my taste. I used a semi sweet chocolate ganache frosting with this.

Super chocolately and super yummy!  We didn't even bother with toppings, it was so good by itself.  Definately for chocolate lovers.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because it is very stick and hard to get out of even the springform pan I used and it doesn't look like much.  You have to dress it up to make it look appetizing, but once it hits your mouth. . .mmmmmmmmmmmm

This was my first attempt at flourless chocolate cake, and I'm completely sold!  I used dark chocolate chips, a little less sugar, and kahlua in place of vanilla extract.  My sweetie and I had to control ourselves from eating the whole thing warm from the pan.  I wish I had some vanilla ice cream for the top, but it's still great.  It did fall apart though, despite precautions... ;-(

It's great for those of us who like our chocolate unadulterated by most anything.  I'm going to try other flourless recipes too, but this one is an easy keeper.

UPDATE:  Baking in a springform pan makes removal much easier!

This chocolate cake recipe was very good.  It was easy to make, and tasted great.  I saw a recommendation to use the Hard Chocolate Glaze recipe with this (http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/HardChocolateGlaze.asp), and it turned out great.  This cake is definitly for chocolate lovers though.

MUCH better than I expected!  It actually tastes a lot like a brownie.  Very rich, but very good!

By reading the reviews first, I was pretty much expecting to have problems getting it out of the pan, which I did, but it sure has a wonderful flavor. I servied it with fresh whipped cream sweatened with Splenda and it was yummy!

I baked for the recommended time, but when i turned it out, it wasn't finished so i managed to get it back in the pan and bake another 10 minutes. Otherwise, very good, although the recipe didn't make as much as i had anticipated. I frosted it with mocha icing.

This cake is great! It is about the easiest cake you will ever bake, and it's SO much better than a regular chocolate cake. I just made it for a birthday (birthday girl has a wheat allergy) and I'm tempted to make one for home.

This was good.  I followed the directions exactly.  Make sure you grease the pan well and let it cool a little before you try to take the cake out of the pan.  I prefer eating mine cold (I keep in the refrigerator) with a hot cup of coffee.

I used dark chocolate chips instead of the baking squares. I baked it in a springform pan like someone else had suggested. I dusted it with powdered sugar after it came out of the oven. Everyone raved about how this tasted like something you would buy at a restaurant! We have a gluten intolerant daughter and this was perfect for her but didn’t have any weird tastes.
This recipe will become a go-to one for us because it’s that good!!!

KETO 
First off there isn't enough stars for this recipe!   A number of people in my family are doing Keto so altered it some. Used 4 oz of Baker's unsweetened chocolate, 1/2 cup of Splenda, 4 eggs, 1/2 cup of Hershey coco, tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup of butter (only had Kerry Gold)
Beat eggs till they were almost double but not whipped, folded into the double boiler (small pot in a bigger pot of boiling water) off the heat with melted butter, chocolate, coco and sugar substitute.  Took some hand stirring to get it all incorporated to a batter. 
Prepared 9" baking pan (it was Teflon) with butter and coco dusting, baked for 35 min and that bad boy separated and almost jumped out the pan after the 10 minutes cooling!
Made confection sugar using 1/2 cup Splenda with tsp of corn starch in a ninja blender (that junk was confectioners sugar) to dust the top of the cake
Used Splenda to taste for whipped cream and a quarter strawberry to create the picture of extravagance.
I am not an agent for Splenda, it really did satisfy the sweet chocolaty craving my family had for desert! Of coarse if you have a better one use it!  Was told that this can be make for my birthday! Lucky!
Prepared it just as written with the Keto friendly ingredients  and wanted to thank Shana for the great recipe!
Not here to advocate diet lifestyle but 40 something lb loss since June 2018 and eating pretty darn good!

It was awesome and a big big hit at the office.
I traded some semi sweet for some bitter, did the egg separate and beat the whites.  Baked at 300 for 30 minutes, perfectly done.  Parchment on the bottom, no problems getting it out of the spring form pan .... will definitely make it again :)

This was so easy and fast. I didn't let it cool in the pan long enough though, so when I tried to turn it out it broke in half. It wasn't for a special occasion thankfully. Next time I'll wait longer for it to cool.

This did not work for me. I followed the recipe and the ingredients separated out from themselves. I going to try it again though. But just make sure you stir it very well.

I've made this recipe a couple of times, and it truly is deceptively easy.  I like to top it with a bit of fresh fruit, which complements the depth of the chocolate.

Insanely delicious!I dusted the bottom of the buttered parchment with ground almonds and added 1/2 c flaked coconut and a 1/4 c. more ground almonds to the batter.  The cocoa powder is not any substitute for chocolate bars. I used 2- 3.5 bittersweet bars and added another ounce of chips and another 1/4 c. sugar. I separated the eggs, beat the whites and added them to the batter at the end. This is a torte, not a cake. Almond Joy! Next time I will add almond extract instead of vanilla or maybe in addition to it!

great recipe but can be made much healthier!  
Made it the first time with semi sweet chocolate bars as recommended and omitted ALL the sugar- it was delicious! like eating a chocolate bar-- second time around used 100% cocoa bars and honey to sweeten- omitted the butter and subbed same amount of coconut oil and it was still delicious! 
 Next time will try subbing the honey with agave and eggs with applesauce (1/4 cup per egg) for a vegan friend- hoping it works!

This is a tried and true recipe.  It's easy and the results are always delicious.  I always add some raspberry puree over the top of each slice, made from frozen raspberries I cook on top of the stove.

Wonderful. My daughter's boyfriend can't have gluten so I made this for them to enjoy for Valentine's Day. It was a hit. So moist and fudgy. I used Ghiradelli dark 80% cacao chocolate and Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder and it had a wonderful depth of flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Can be made with Splenda and still taste wonderful.  Be careful not to overbake.  I plated slices and warmed in slightly in the microwave before serving and it was nice and fudgy.  Store leftovers in the refrigerator and they keep very well.

This cake is amazing! It doesn't take long to put together compared to some of the other flourless cakes, but tastes so good! I made this for some people with gluten allergies at my brother's party, and everyone started to eat this one instead of the regular cake. It tastes fudgy and goes amazing with whipped cream and strawberries. One suggestion though- use waxed paper of parchment paper on the bottom of the pan because it stuck really bad when I tried to get it out.. Other than that.. AWESOME!

Fantastic recipe! My 12 yr old son helped make this for a dinner with the inlaws. Everyone was impressed! Oh and we only had orange flavoured chocolate (and used a few bars more than the recipe) so it was a flour less chocolate orange cake. Absolutely delicious.

Really good - a little rich for me but what I was expecting. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly (except I forgot to follow my protocol of putting parchment paper in the bottom of the pan which led to difficulty getting the cake out...)

This is an amazing flourless chocolate cake! It looks really sad when it's done baking because it sinks a lot, but just whip up some homemade whipped cream, homemade caramel sauce, throw some sliced strawberries on there, and it looks like it's out of a fancy restaurant. My husband and I love this recipe

I couldn't get it out of the pan! I followed the recipe exactly, but after 10 minutes of cooling, I realized that the cake wasn't done after 30 minutes. So I baked it for 10 more and still couldn't get it out of the pan. After 40 minutes of cooking, the cake wasn't done! So I guess it depends on your oven? I also like the wax paper trick I saw someone else mention. I scooped out the gooey mess and served ice cream over the top. Everyone loved it.

I LOVE this recipe! I am new to the gluten free world- its been about 4 months and this is my first attempt at a gluten free dessert. I loved it! I was having a major chocolate craving and this hit the spot! Very comparable to the kind I use to buy at my favorite Artisan Café. I didn't have any semi sweet chocolate squares- so I subbed some hot fudge syrup ( I was desperate for chocolate, lol)it turned out great! My only struggle was getting it out of the pan. May have been my substitution though. I buttered and cocoa powdered the pan, still stuck and came out broken. I didn't need it to be pretty though so it was fine.

An awesome treat! I made the recipe one day and decided the next day to experiment to come up with a healthier version.  I used half the butter and replaced the other half with unsweetened applesauce. I then replaced all the sugar with replacement sugar (no name "Splenda").  I also separated the eggs, beat up the whites and added to the recipe as another review suggested. Was THRILLED with the results. The recipe made 9-10 cupcakes and they didn't fall as the other recipe seemed to do. Love the new version and will definitely do again!

I followed the instructions exactly except that I forgot the vanilla extract and it didn't make a difference. The texture might have resembled a brownie but who doesn't like brownies? My sister came to visit and I had to whip up something quick, so I made this and it took only a few minutes to put together and 35 minutes in the oven. By the time my sister arrived the cake was cooling in the pan!

I had high hopes for this recipe and I made it for my fiancé and his family for his birthday. MAJOR issue: the cake will not come out of the pan if prepared as written. I heavily greased the pan. Must use wax paper or something in the pan or use another recipe for better instructions. Tastes good, but is practically just a fudge. I'd recommend a different recipe or prepare this in individual saucers so it won't have to be removed from the cooking pan. Check out the recipe for The Black Beast; I'll make it next time and it was highly recommended by a friend.

This was great! It reminds me of a fudge cake, and my husband thinks it's like a brownie cake. I topped it with chocolate ganache.  Next time I'll try it with all chocolate bars as a reviewer suggested, but I like the original recipe a lot.

This is one of the easiest recipes I have tried but a lot of the reviews are right that it may take 10 or so more minutes in your own oven. The centres of flourless cakes in all the other recipes I looked at said that the centres were meant to be slightly gooey looking. I just took it out when a toothpick came out clean. I let it cool in my pan for 20 minutes and then completely on a wire rack. I use silicone cake pans and they do not need to be dusted or greased. I didn't grease or dust and the cake came out completely fine. It has an extreme chocolate taste almost like eating a 70% Dark Chocolate bar. If you prefer sweeter chocolate I don't recommend this cake or any like it as most are meant to taste like this. I will try going full chocolate next time instead of with the cocoa. Also I would like to point out that I am in the UK and used an electric fan assisted oven and so had to bake it at 130 degrees celsius if you have the same always deduct 20 degrees from the celsius temperature given if it does not list a fan assisted temperature as well. I hope this helps.

Made this for Passover and it was fabulous!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I had trouble removing it from the pan.  I had a lot going on in the kitchen the day I made it and may not have waited a full 10 minutes to remove it from the pan, so that would be my fault.  Despite that, we were able to mush it back together and it was delicious.  Each time I had it, I paired a sliver of this with a sliver of cheesecake for an awesome combination.
Update:  Made it again tonight.  To make it a little healthier, I used raw cacao powder and coconut sugar.  I set my timer this time, and it came out of the pan easier, but not 100%.  There was still a chunk in the pan, but I was able to mush it back into place once again and no one could tell.  Very easy recipe that comes together quickly with little cleanup.

I thought this was very delicious! Will make it again. I followed another suggestion and used two bars of chocolate bars instead of the cocoa powder. I did use cocoa powder when I greased the pan. I don't think that worked well to keep the cake from sticking. I would have given this 5 stars if I followed the recipe exactly. But since that annoys me when others don't rate the recipe as written, I will only give it 4 stars because I altered it.

This recipe is delicious, but I tried twice, and could not get the cake out of the pan in one piece.  It cracked and fell apart.  I used my cookie scoop and make cake balls out of it, dusting half of the balls with cocoa and half with powdered sugar.  On my second attempt, I left it in the pan and dusted it with powdered sugar over a heart shaped paper doily, then carefully removed the doily.  It camouflaged the cracks well!  Maybe I should bake it longer than 30 minutes next time.  I'm not sure why I am having trouble getting it out of the pan.

while the recipe is delicious, it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to get it out of the pan with out it turning to complete mush!  I baked it threes times, all with the same outcome.  I ended up cutting the cake into small pieces to get it out of the pan and covering it in the ganache icing and passing it off as fudge pieces!

This was too much like a brownie unfortunately. Maybe beating the egg whites separately and creating some volume would fix that?

I have 2 kids with celiac, thus gluten free recipes are a must. Not all gluten free meals are tasty- often times the weight and textures are off. This cake is truly the exception. I left out the cocoa powder and used extra dark morsels instead. It was fantastic. Definitely a keeper.

So delicious and so, so simple.  Baking is not my strongest talent, but this dessert made me feel like my kitchen belonged in a fancy restaurant.  I used half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate morsels, melted in the microwave, as that was the only chocolate I had on hand, and   I used the other half of the bag to make a Ganache topping (recipe from this site). The combo of cake and topping put the whole thing over the top.  If you have a craving for chocolate decadence, this delicious and easy recipe is it.

A chocolate lovers dream! So very easy to make, but the end result is so deceptively "complex" - always a hit with everyone who tries it. I like to top mine with a dark chocolate ganache, which adds a nice creamy layer to the top of the cake (as well as a smooth, glassy look). Great with fresh strawberries! This is a recipe I will always come back to.

I used 8 oz of semisweet chocolate as another reviewer suggested and this kicked it up a notch.  I also melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave.  Made this and even simpler recipe.  Delicious.  Will make again.  We also ate it while it was hot.  Fell apart a little, but it was just the family so it didn't need to be beautiful, only delicious!

I also melted the butter in a saucepan and then added the chocolate. It worked just fine that way, if you don't have a double boiler. Instead of squares of chocolate, I measured out 4 oz of semisweet chocolate chips, which also worked fine. I made this as a treat for my husband and topped it with Sweetened Whipped Cream, also from this site. It was EXCELLENT! Easy, fast and something for which I almost always have all the ingredients on hand!

This recipe was a big hit.  My husband has a similar version to this at a local restaurant so we made it tonight for supper.  He was very happy with the results and so were the rest of my guests.  Very easy to make.  We used the 9 inch pan as well and it only made it a little thinner which still worked out well. Thanks

In a word AMAZING! Got rave reviews by all who ate it! I used Hersey's Special Dark cocoa powder (I think it tastes better than the more expensive brands). I topped this with ganache (Ingrid Vogele's recipe from this site) and mini chocolate chips around the outer edge. Simple to make, looks great and tastes even better, thanks so much for the recipe:)

Made using light butter and Splenda Blend.  Came out wonderfully and no one knew the difference.  Big hit with the family at Thanksgiving.

If you use 8oz of bakers chocolate & omit the cocoa (as per another raters advice) it is a perfect melt in your mouth brownie recipe. Next time I will bake using cocoa & see if it turns out more cake like.

I tried using all chocolate bars like a reviewer suggested but the "cake" ended up more like fudge. I will try again using the original recipe.

I followed the recipe and it came out absolutely delicious. The only difference was that I used a saucepan in low heat (as someone else suggested as an alternative) and I used a muffin pan. If my boyfriend thinks they are superb then we have a winner. Kudos!

A simply delicious dessert that is effortless!  I followed others' suggestions and used extra chocolate instead of cocoa powder.  I also use Nestle semi sweet chocolate chips to make it even easier and microwave with the butter.  I also made a simple chocolate ganache to cover the cake with 4 oz chocolate and 4 Tbsp. Smart Balance Butter.  It came out great.  I lined the bottom of the pan with wax paper and it worked, but I had to peel it off very carefully.  I served it with fried ice cream and it was a huge hit!

This was fabulous but it needed a little sweetness-I used a chocolate frosting/glaze recipe I made up and it really bumped it up a notch. The texture is similar to the black bean brownie recipe I found on this site. Delicious!

this tasted great! it was very brownie-like, which i didn't really expect. but we still enjoyed it. tastes even better the next day. i doubled the recipe because i only have a 10" springform and was afraid it would be too thin otherwise. also, i greased the pan, lined with parchment and grease the parchment. it came out of the pan with no trouble at all. topped with homemade whipped cream and loved it!

I made this exactly as the recipe states, except I think my round pans are 9-inch. I thought it was really very good, rich and chocolatey. I just melted my chocolate and butter in the microwave, then let them cool a little before adding the eggs. Next time I want to make a berry whipped cream of some sort to serve on top and lighten it up a bit.

This was to die for! I followed the recipe as written. I took extra care to very slowly add the eggs as tossing them all in at once into hot chocolate batter will almost cook the eggs. Adding slowly gave me a lovely smooth consistency, not a gritty brownie one. I made it with a raspberry coulis to drizzle on top and whipped cream on the side.

This was soooo good.  I love cake and was really bummed when I found out that I can't eat it anymore....until I found this recipe!! I made and put the leftovers in the ref over night covered and it was even better.  Next time I make this I'm going to make it the night before.

great recipe. i read some reviews and decided to use all chocolate instead of using powder, then i realized it undercooks even if you add the extra time. so i had to bake it a little more. great flavor a little sweeter than i wanted but overall its a good alternative for bread cake. pure chocolate goodness.

After 30 minutes, a toothpick was still wet. I cooked it for another 5 and while it still seemed a bit moist, I took it out anyway. After cooling for 10 minutes, I tried to get it out of the pan. It came out like a doghnut, leaving the middle in the pan. However, it tastes really good. :) Next time I will probably use wax paper on the bottom to help ensure ease of removal. (I also used a pie plate since I don't have a round cake pan).

Great recipe, served to guests who were gluten intolerant and this was devoured. It is very rich so a small piece with whipped cream and berries on the side was perfect.

This cake was awesome, so easy to make! Its warm and gooey and yummy!!! The only thing I came across was to cook it a little longer than what it said, like 7 minutes, it just was not done after thirty minutes. Great served with some fresh raspberries and whipped cream! Enjoy!

this is fabulous!!! I made mine in a mini muffin tin with paper liners.  The papers didn't come off very well when the cakes were even slightly warm but the next day them came off super easy.  They tasted just like one bite brownies!!  It was super easy too!! I'll be making thing for years to come!!!

I was craving chocolate and wanted to make something quick and easy with ingredients I already owned.  This recipe was it!  I only had a 9 inch pan so I entered the number 12 in the servings calculator and used those portions (except I kept the egg count to 3).  It turned out perfectly.  It did take 35 minutes to cook and it isn't the most wonderful flourless chocolate cake I've had.  But it was exactly what I was looking for today: quick, easy, and intensely chocolate!

Not what I expect at all! I followed the recipe to the letter, except I don't have a double broiler so I melted the chocolate in a copper pot on low heat stirring constantly. The consistency was too oily and falling apart like pudding more than cake. I wanted a really dense heavy recipe and this did not turn out well at all. The taste was delicious, that was about it. I'd use less butter next time or try a different recipe.

Followed the directions exactly except used a chocolate bar. Turned out perfectly.  Though, next time I may put parchment paper on the bottom so it won't stick (still stuck a little bit with grease and cocoa powder.  Very chocolatey and very good!  Made a satiny chocolate glaze by Ginger from this site and it went perfectly.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday, and he went wild over it.  The best part is that it was incredibly easy to make while also being ridiculously melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I modified the recipie to substitute 4 oz. of chocolate for the cocoa.  Overall, I used 4 oz. of dark and 4 oz. of semisweet chocolate.  If you use this method, make sure to grease and dust the pan very well as the middle of the cake might stick.  Since I don't have a double boiler, I melted the chocolate in the microwave with no problems.  The cooking time of 30 minutes was pretty accurate, but I might decrease it slightly when I make this again as the edges of the cake got slightly overcooked in my opinion.  This recipe is great as is but would also lend itself to creative toppings and the addition of flavor extracts or liqueurs.  I'm excited to make it again in the future!

i'm giving this 5 starts because it was quick and easy, but more importantly it made my son's day. he's a 3 year old autistic and we're transitioning him to gluten free as it's been known to help with some of the symptoms. he loves chocolate cake (he calls it "heck") and since he already had to give up his fave cereal i knew i had to find him a cake. well he loved it. it was more like a brownie but he didn't care. i personally didn't care for the bitter taste from the cocoa but he was fine with it. and i didn't have to look for all those weird gluten free ingredients. this is a keeper and will be my son's new "heck." THANKS!

Too much cocoa flavour for me; although could be using a poor quality powder.  Imagine it makes a difference, considering the amount that goes into it.  Didn't really satisfy a chocolate cake craving either; felt more like chocolate fudge than chocolate cake.

DELICIOUS! Found this while looking for something to bring over to my mom who is gluten intolerant. Everyone loved it. I took the advice to use all chocolate (I used semi-sweet morsels) and no cocoa and served it with ice cream & strawberries. The family was split 50/50 on vanilla vs. coffee ice cream, so bring both like I did. Heaven on a plate.

I just made this cake for a potluck dinner party and oh my was it great!!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 10" springform pan, and I added 10 min to the cooking time.  When I took it out of the oven it looked a little under done but I didn't want to over cook it either.  It was delicious and gooey in the middle kind of like a lava cake but it still cut beautifully.  I served it with a raspberry coulis.  The combination of the rich cake and tart sauce was amazing!  I recommend this recipe highly, and don't over cook it because the "goo" factor is the best part!  And to have it extra yummy heat it for 12 seconds in the microwave before eating (I just ate the last piece thank goodness I don't have to keep looking at it!)  Enjoy!

I made this on Valentine's Day for my boyfriend who suffers from celiac--he loved it and has already asked me to make it again. I thought it was wonderful--and my 7 year old liked it too. I mixed up some strawberries and a little sugar--and served the cake with them and some real whipped cream. YUM!

Wonderful. I made this for a Valentine Party. It traveled well.  Great for those with gluten allergies. I sifted powdered sugar on top then some red sprinkels on the powdered sugar. I also used all chocolate and not the cocoa powder as well as the tip for using wax paper on the bottom of the cake tin as well as using cocoa powder instead of flour.   Great suggestions and wonderful tasting cake.  I will make this again.

This is a wonderful cake for people who are watching their carbs.  I substituted Splenda for the required sugar to further lower carb count.  I also did a white chocolate ganache to complement the dark chocolate.  I'll be making this recipe again!

This was fabulous!! My family loved it. Very rich. My mother-in-law follows a Glueten Free Diet and she absolutely loves it.  I followed the recipe exactly. I melted the chocolate and butter in a glass bowl atop a pan of slighty boiling water.  I also followed someone else's advice and divided the mixture between ramekins (7). Though I did not spray the ramekins first. Baked at 300 for 40 minutes.  The original 30 just wasn't long enough.  We were going to top with ice cream and eat right out of the ramekin but decided to turn them out into a bowl.  So, after 10 minutes of cooling, a ran my very thin cake tester around the edge of the ramekins to loosen the cakes and they popped right out, no problems.  Fantastic!  This will be a staple in our house, especially for my mother-in-law.

I used 1/2 splenda for baking and 1/2 granulated white sugar.  I also lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and sprayed it with pan spray.  The cake peeled right off and no mess to clean up!  Wonderful with aerosol whipped cream on top  :-)

This was very interesting! I made as directed, but cooled only for 10 minutes in the pan, as I had to dig in after that. It was delicious and easy to take out of the pan after cutting it into pieces. Make sure you butter the pan very well, and dust as well, as the recipe suggests.

This recipe was really good.

It's very easy to make but not so easy to get them out, even though I greased and dusted with cocoa powder as suggested by some members. I also doubled the portion, added 2 and a half tablespoon of freshly brewed espresso and baked in big muffin tins (yielded 11) for about 25 mins. The small cakes collapsed quite a bit once cooled down but taste great good. Will certainly make it again.

This recipe is awesome, a true chocolate lovers treat. I made it for my mother's birthday. I followed the recipe as is. It is no time or trouble to make and the results are outstanding. The only problem I had was it breaking when I removed it from the pan. Not an issue, I cut it into chunks and layered them onto plates topping each portion with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. This is a recipe I will surely make again.

Big hit! I prefer it with all chocolate chips instead of the cocoa, but it is great both ways! I also added a chocolate glaze as recommended in another review and it was great.

This wasn't too bad, though it's definitely not a "cake" in the way most people think of cake. Of course, if you take out a classic cake ingredient like flour, you really shouldn't expect to get the exact same results as you would get from a cake with flour. I used applesauce instead of butter to cut way down on the calories. Mine had a mousse-y fudge kind of texture. It was quite decadent. I used cocoa powder as directed, but my cake wasn't "gritty" as another reviewer described. It was perfectly smooth. Maybe it's because I used fresh cocoa powder and mixed the batter very well? I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. This cake is also difficult to get out of a pan (either whole or in slices) without breaking it into several pieces. It can be done, but it's not easy.

Unbelievably good!  I read some other reviews before trying this and decided to double the chocolate and cut out the cocoa.  Served it warm with raspberry sauce and it was fantastic.

Okay so I tried this recipe last night with the following modifications.  I used the info from previous reviewers of substituting all chocolate for the cocoa.  I also added the following adjustments for a low carb version with 8 oz unsweetened chocolate, and xylitol instead of sugar.  I added 2 teaspoons of xylitol for each ounce of unsweetened chocolate before melting, and xylitol for the sugar in the rest of the recipe.  I came out very dense and very thin.  I think it would be better as a fudge tart with a pecan crust.  I think I'm going to try this next time.  I made a vanilla cream sauce for the cake and cut into circles with a cookie cutter to serve.  Everyone loved it.  Xylitol is the best sugar substitute; it bakes great and tastes better.

excellent! when i flipped it out of the cake pan, it broke into several pieces, BUT i pieced it back together & after it had cooled, i poured a delicious ganache on top (ghiradelli semi sweet chips w/heavy cream) and it hid all imperfections!  tasted very fancy and was even great a few days later. would definitely make again.

Very yummy and easy to make.  Be sure to grease the pan *liberally* with crisco and then add the cocoa powder.  The first time I made it I greased the pan lightly and it didn't come out.  Not a problem, as I just broke the cake up into little bite sized pieces which is enough of this rich dessert!  :)

Baked it in a 8" springform but it only got to be 3/4 inch tall.  It doesn't look much like a cake but warm under ice cream it's delish!  The chocolate is incredibly rich. I put the leftovers in the fridge and it's the best "fudge" I've ever had.  Keeps well there too. A week later and we're still eating it a bite-size (or 2) at a time. I'll make this again just for the intense and real flavors.

Didn't expect it to be so thin, but very chocolatly and very good.  Didn't use cocoa powder, just 2 chocolate bars.  Also, was a sinch to get out of the pan since I put a circle of wax paper on the bottom, I highly suggest doing that.

This cake was very easy to make and it is very similar to a chocolate souffle that I've had before at one of our more high end restaurants.  Instead of bothering with a double boiler I simply melted the chocolate cubes and butter together until smooth and shiny before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Over all I think this was a very good recipe.  The only 'problem' is that it is so rich that one can only have a few bites at a time.  Chocolate lovers dream.

Oh Yum!!!!!  So quick and wonderful!!!  Our 15 year old daughter made this cake up in no time.  She really worried that it wouldn't turn out without flour.  She was completely amazed that it not only turned out....but that it is some of the best chocolate cake that we've ever had!!!  She used regular semi-sweet baking chips...and followed the rest of the recipe.  She did bake it for 5 minutes longer...that is just probably difference in ovens.  

We didn't even need frosting to enjoy this cake......so good!

Thanks So Much For This Recipe!!!!  This will Be Our Family Favorite!!!!!!!!

What a wonderful cake!  Very rich and fudgy, so a little goes a long way.  I baked it an additional 5 min. since it didn't seem to have set up all the way, with no adverse affects.  Served with vanilla ice cream and sliced stawberries - tastes just like the Torta di Chocotale at Olive Garden!  Definite keeper!

WOW!  It's absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Only thing is I used semisweet chocolate chips instead of squares because that's all I had.  This cake does not need frosting, I actually prefer without it.  Thank you!

This is INCREDIBLE!  I love it - my new favorite cake. :-)  I have a high allergy to wheat and gluten, so I thought I'd try this flourless cake - and I also want to recommend it to those who are not allergic to wheat or gluten!  Yes, it's a very thin cake, but once dressed up with some sifted powdered sugar and crushed walnuts and pecans - it is perfection.  It's so decadent, you don't need it to be thick anyway.  I made this in a springform pan, to make removal, easy.  I melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave for about a minute, at 70% power (less dishes to dirty)! :-)  I can't wait to make this for guests!  Thank you!

I think this recipe is easy and delicious!  I made it for dessert on Christmas and my family loved it!

As far as the comment on using real chocolate for better taste versus cocoa powder, I would have thought that to be true.  But I was surprised the cocoa powder works just fine; I did use an organic cocoa powder that is a bit higher end, so that might account for such a great flavor!

I recommend highly recommend this recipe!

I tried this recipe after my best friend brought a flourless cake home from Target that had 59 grams of fat per serving in it!! This one wasn't as good as that one, but it was pretty good. The cocoa that was used to dust the pan made the cake very bitter and it was a little more dense and less fudgy or cakey than i expected. It really keeps it's shape and is really heavy. I bought walnuts and caramel for me and ready whip for my other guests. They liked it, and since it was so easy to make I'd definitely make it again!

This is great- I've never made a flourless cake before.  I used Nestle Chocolatier 62% cacao chocolate for this recipe and it gave the cake a delicious deep chocolate flavor.  I wanted to make a ganache for it, but thought that a dark chocolate ganache would be too much, so I made a white chocolate ganache, using "Chocolate Ganache" from this site (using white chocolate instead of dark).  I'm not sure if I underbaked this, but it was very, very moist; but maybe it's supposed to be that way.  Whatever it was, it was good!  Everyone who tasted it liked it.

I made this for one of my friends on his birthday and he enjoyed every bite of it...along with the guests! It was so rich and chocolaty but it had a brownie texture which I think made it seem even more rich. I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked it in a springform pan. I will definitely make this recipe again, especially if I feel like indulging.

Deliciously rich and wonderful! A very easy recipe, not daunting for the non-baker like me. A hit -- looks and tastes a lot more impressive than it really is! A couple of notes: 1) I just melted butter and chocolate together in a pot on low heat, no double boiler; 2) mine crumbled into pieces when it came out of the pan, despite greasing and powdering with cocoa. I solved this problem by icing with Hard Chocolate Glaze from this site. Totally hid the problem. I also dipped some strawberries in this glaze.

I made this because my friend's dog died, and they needed comfort food, but i didn't have any flour around the house. well, i didn't have any chocolate around, so instead i used the baking cocoa with oil sub listed on the container. it's 3 T cocoa for 1 T oil=1 oz baking chocolate. well i ended up using 3/4 c cocoa and 1/4 c oil to make the full 4 oz. because it was the unsweetened cocoa, it needed alot more sugar but i didn't add enough at all. so to make up for that i tried to make a really sweet frosting, and it helped with the bitterness. i made these in muffin cups, and they turned out like little round brownies, like the kind you can buy at the store. they were really good, but i think they taste more like brownies than like a cake.

delicious! This is my stepmum's favourite dessert right now and she doesn't like chocolate! It's EXTREMELY rich and very shallow. I recommend doubling the mix for a normal looking cake, but then again, its so dense that maybe it's good to keep it short. I used Splenda and Cadburys Lite Chocolate.

One of the Easiest recipes Ive ever made! Did the whole thing in one bowl too. Made it in a spring form pan as others had suggested. Didnt find the cake dry at all it was very moist. I dont like an over load of chocolate so i used fresh whipping cream for the 'frosting' and drizzled White Chocolate Mocha frosting from this site. garnished with white chocolate shavings. Everyone raved.

Hi there - some people have said their cakes crumbled coming out of the pan - I've since started lining my pan with a parchment round as well as greasing and flouring both the pan and the parchment with cocoa.  It hasn't happened since.  Also I did a special version of this cake for a friend using 1 tsp of dried ginger and 2 tbsps of grated fresh ginger and it turned out great - like the dark chocolate/ginger truffles from Godiva.  Enjoy, Shana

This was a good and much easier version of the flourless chocolate cake.  I have made this twice.  The second time, I added orange extract and it was purely divine!  This is my dream dessert!

This is a very simple recipe that makes a very moist, smooth, chocolaty, and heavenly cake!  A springform pan would be helpful for a nice presentation, but I was fine with serving it from the cake pan. I used some semi sweet chocolate chips with the baking chocolate and it came out great! A nice change from the usual cake texture. Thanks!

This recipe is easy and tastes awesome.  I used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar to reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe and it worked perfectly!

This was an awesome dessert...easy and quick to make; foolproof, just follow directions.  I topped it with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel syrup.  I am making it again and will puree frozen raspberries as the syrup.  YUM!!!!

I followed most people’s advice and used 8 oz of the chocolate instead of adding the cocoa. I had to cook it for 55 minutes before it set up enough to cool it on a rack. It was delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and brought it to a church potluck.  It was all eaten - everyone who had it raves about it.  I topped it with seedless raspberry drizzle and fresh berries.  Absolutely delicious.

I baked it in a 10x10 brownie pan. It was very thin and stuck to the pan in the middle.  But it was delicious.

I make this as a special treat for my husband.  It's his favorite!  Very rich.  More like a truffle cake.
I omit the cocoa powder and use twice the melted chocolate.  Delish!!!

I've made this before and it's so easy and delicious -- the only chocolate cake that I really make. I find it very chocolatey, but still cakey, which is how I like my flourless chocolate cake. I might add a dap of salt as I like that. I also typically melt chocolate and butter slowly in the microwave: 10 or 15 seconds, stir, repeat until all melted.

Moist and delicious!  Used a little over a half bag of semi sweet chocolate chips (melted in microwave). Followed recipe exactly.  Needed to cool cake 30 min before released from pan. Will make again!  Delicious served with vanilla gelato!

I made this for a Nova Scotia sparking wine tasting with friends (one wine was served with chocolate). It was an outstanding very popular dessert. After reading the reviews I made a few adjustments - I used 6 oz of chocolate (3 ounces of semi sweet and 3 ounces of 70% dark chocolate) and 1/4 cup of cocoa. This was a stellar combination - the cake was chocolatey, not too sweet with a silky texture. I used a 9" springform pan (I don't have an 8" - it was thin, but worked just fine with a dollop of whipped cream). It was fast to make and my new go to chocolate cake (plus it's gluten free dessert option for my celiac friends).

Used 8 oz chocolate chips and no cocoa powder as another user suggested.  Add 10 minutes to baking time.  Rich and delicious.  A keeper.

I made this for thanksgiving. A gathering of 50 people. By far this was the favorite dessert. I didn’t change the recipe at all, btw. My sister in law was shocked I’d made it in my toaster oven. :-) I doubled the recipe so there would be enough for many tasters. It still came out great.

This was my first attempt baking a flourless cake. Everyone loved it! I decided to use 6 ounces of chocolate chips instead of the chocolate squares. In my oven it took about 36 minutes to bake. It turned out moist and dense with a rich chocolate taste, and very easy to make.

Phenomenal cake! Now my daughter, who has celiac, and I, who am gluten sensitive, can enjoy a super-yummy dessert. 2 important things to do, as 2nd time I made it, I didn’t do—SIFT the cocoa. Additionally, whisk the eggs— I put them in one of those small “bullets“ like a small blender and whisk them till they’re fluffy-ish.

I was looking for something for Passover...this was really good!...it was very fudgy tho. I left out the cocoa and used all chocolate bars as per the review. I doubled the recipe the second time, swapped out 2 milk chocolate baking bars for two of the dark chocolate ones and added 2/3 cup flour. Delicioso!!!

I made this cake as nondairy so I used olive oil in place of butter. In addition,  I used high-grade bittersweet Swiss chocolate in place of semisweet chocolate.  I also used raw sugar in place of regular granulated sugar...also,  I cut back on the amount of sugar (used 1/2 cup).
Each time I bake this cake,  my guests devour it! 
Extremely highly recommended.
Note:  using high quality solid chocolate makes a big difference for this cake.

This was a hit at our family Easter. I made it exactly as written, and there wasn't any graininess to it. It was rich, smooth, delicious, and so easy to make! I used 85 percent chocolate bars from Aldi for the bittersweet chocolate. Served with fresh whipped cream on top. This is a keeper!

Agree with some of the comments that suggest ditching the cocoa powder for another bar of chocolate. I also add a tablespoon of coffee to bring out the chocolate flavour. I serve with fresh raspberries, mint and vanilla ice cream :)

All in all, this recipe is quick, easy and enjoyable to follow. Highly suggest!

Very rich, very dense, very chocolate cake. Ate it warm, about 30 mins out of the oven. Seemed a bit greasy. Made as written except added a pinch of salt (used unsalted butter) but likely could have used more to counter the sweetness. I melted butter and chocolate on stove over a low flame in a small saucepan, then added other ingredients once melted. Was not over sweet but it was sweet. Stuck to my Sur La Tab greased and chocolate dusted pan. It may have needed to cool longer than the 10 mins stated prior to removing from pan as it was still very hot (likely all the fat in it.) It is very easy.

Made it as is for a function that a gluten free diet person attended. In the past haven’t cared much for gluten free, not a lot of taste. This cake killed it! Everyone loved it, almost fudgey tasting, really good.

Fantastic!  Added 2 more squares of unsweet chocolate and was too lazy to put parchment on the bottom of the pan.  Tore a little coming out but patched it up easily, sifted powdered sugar over a doily on top, and added fresh strawberry slices.  Happy accident -  toppings made it tastier and prettier!  So easy to make; melt in your mouth texture; perfect level of sweetness with the extra unsweet chocolate (our taste runs is on the "less sweet" end of the spectrum).  Home-made whipped cream made it complete -

Super yum! I made exactly as directed. I used a silicone muffin pan and made 9 individual cupcakes for 9 people.

We love this gluten free flourless chocolate cake! I use half the baking chocolate, with 1/2 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp vanilla flavoring. Next time I'm going to try orange flavoring with the vanilla.

I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out fabulous ! Moist, gluten free.... I dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled prior to serving with seedless raspberry jam that I heated up. Topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Was a hit for all. Of us Gluten free and not !

I only had one stick of butter and was relieved to find this recipe. I adapted as another reviewer suggested and used all chocolate vs using half chocolate/half cocoa. I used Ghirradelli bittersweet (60%) chocolate chips with a few semi-sweet chips thrown it to hit 8 oz, and I melted the chips and butter in a microwave-safe bowl (30 seconds, mix, 30 seconds, mix, 15 seconds, mix, 15 final seconds, mix). I served the cake with fresh strawberries to cut the richness. I wasn't sure how air-tight my spring form pan was, so I put a sheet pan on the bottom rack and I was glad I did -- a little butter dribbled onto the pan during cooking. I only greased the pan with Pam, as I didn't have any cocoa powder handy, although I did put a piece of parchment on the bottom; I didn't have any issue removing the cake from the pan. An unexpected and delightful -- and easy -- dessert.

I made this tonight.  Smelled great while it was baking.  Cooled it in the pan but when I went to take it out it wouldn't come out of the pan.  Greased the pan before I baked it.  What did I do wrong?

Deceptively easy. Delish. Crowd pleaser and perfect accompaniment to Guinness Beef Stew (also a Chef John specialty).  I served it on a bed of homemade raspberry coulis.

I've made it twice now with rave reviews, but I slightly altered the recipe each time. The first time I spinkled in some cayenne in a nod to the film CHOCOLAT, and it was a cheeky good undernote. Second time I used mint oil instead of vanilla and one happy mouth said it tasted like a Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie.

Amazing and easy! My 11 year old made this with my supervision. We used a jumbo muffin pan to make 6 individual cakes. He put whipped cream on top with a caramel drizzle. He was quite proud of himself.

We liked it and although I followed the directions exactly, it needed a bit more baking and then I could not get it out of the pan.  So, I made a couple of "desconstructed" cakes but managed to get out 5 pieces, which is all we needed.  It tastes very chocolatey and wonderful.  I just wish it came out of the pan nicely.  ah well....

I made this recipe exactly as described, topped it with whipped cream, and it was absolutely delicious!  It is kind of dense, almost more like a fudge brownie.  My husband and kids loved it.  We will definitely make this again!

Did anyone else notice the video showed using "5" ounces of chocolate while the recipe uses 4?  Which is correct?

I used dark chocolate chips and the cake TASTED delicious. However even adding ten minutes to the baking time, the cake never completely baked in the middle.  Of course it was impossible to remove nicely from the pan without coming apart. Not sure if I should bake at 350 instead of 300, as instructed. I also would like to use Splenda to lower sugar. I’ll try flourless cake 1 next time!

Question: where does the 29.9 carbs come from? That’s a lot of carbs for it to be Flourless. I have diabetes and when I make this I will substitute the sugar for Swerve or Monk Fruit and I love the idea from Mommy of Seattle using bittersweet or high cacao chocolate bars to get a more chocolatey cake. Thanks for a quick easy recipe!

I have made this numerous times and find it’s a winner every time. I do the similar with buttering the pan with butter and dusting the pan with cocoa but line the bottom with parchment paper.  Also I call it a flourless Chocolate torte the with Jewish Holiday you can have this dessert.

Tasty! I made it with just chocolate chips, no cocoa powder, as other reviewers suggested. I served it with a strawberry frosting (I just pureed strawberries in the blender and then mixed in powdered sugar, and I added some sliced strawberries in a decorative arrangement on top). I made a double recipe of the cake but still baked it in one round pan, so it needed more baking time. I gave it an extra 10-15 minutes, but that turned out not to be enough, and it still ended up gooey. And unfortunately I didn't have enough powdered sugar for the frosting to really get to the usual frosting thickness. So it was basically chocolate goo mixed with strawberry goo - but people loved it!! Guests at the party thought it was supposed to be that way, and it was a big hit!

Where is the recipe for the glaze that is pictured on this flourless chocolate cake? I have made the cake before and it's easy and decadent, but I remember the recipe actually including the recipe for the glaze as well.

Deep chocolate flavour!  9 inch pan @ 30 minutes was perfect. Will definitely be making again and trying some of the toppings mentioned - we ate it plain and it was yummy!  Rich and decadent.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9" cake pan. Baked for about 55 minutes. Used a parchment paper circle on the bottom of the pan for ease of removal. Decorated with powdered sugar and raspberries. Please loved it!

Amazing, I loved this recipe but I changed one thing: the amount of sugar. I put half of the amount and used coconut sugar. It was still sweet and delicious.

Easy, simple recipe made from kitchen staples that I happened to have on hand. Substituted 4oz (1/2 c) semi sweet chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate and it turned out great. Followed the advice of Crobbart to make cake fluffier (separate egg yolks from egg whites, beat egg whites before folding in separately)  Poured batter into cupcake papers and cooked for 30 min. Served with a dollop of cool whip to compliment the richness of the cake. Husband and gf guests loved it. Will make again.

I used dark chocolate rather than semi-sweet. I put a glaze of 1/2 C melted dark chocolate, 2 C mixed berry purée, 1/2 C butter & 3 C powdered sugar all mix together. It was a so decadent!!

People raved about this recipe!!!!   I skipped the cocoa too and used Ghiradelli Semi Sweet chocolate bars 80z total!  It was delicious.  My only issue is getting it out of the pan, I would recommend parchment paper to line the pan with.

Used what I had on hand and it was pretty good, considering I didn't follow the exact recipe. 
Subbed 3/4 c. semisweet choc chips for choc squares, splenda for sugar. Sifted cocoa powder. Added 10 min to cook time. Keeping this one to try again.

Loved this recipe!  I made it in a 9” cake pan since that’s all I had. The batter was only about 1/2” thick so I was worried it would be too thin. It did puff up some during baking but was still only about 3/4” thick after cooling. I baked it for 25 minutes and that was about right. The taste was amazing and I will definitely make this again but I plan to get an 8” round pan for next time. I served it with a dusting of powdered sugar, homemade whipped cream and raspberries on the side. Everyone loved it except my 12-year-old.  It may not be a kid-favorite.

Ok so attempt 1, I tinkered w the recipe too much, added  more eggs & too much liquid, and baked in a bundt pan. It was like delicious rich pudding and not quite set enough to turn out even after 50 minutes baked.  Attempt #2 I made as cupcakes and stuck  to the recipe much closer, used less liquid- meaning instead of a bunch of extra eggs, cream & espresso, I kept the 3 eggs called for, reduced the espresso I added to 1 tbsp and ditto on cream. I actually needed to add some liquid to this because I used unsweetened baking chocolate and the unsweetened cocoa and therefore had to up the sugar from 3/4 to 11/2 cup. Trust me keep the cocoa powder, it replaces flour & is needed for texture. Trust me add the espresso (just buy a shot from a coffee shop)as it makes the whole thing come together. Don’t use a bundt pan! Do use cupcake liners & bake in muffin tin. 1 recipe makes 12 regular sized cupcakes. I suggest using cheap chocolate until you perfect it. Then break out the Valrhona. I’ve got raspberry cream cheese ganache firming up to top these with right now.

Great gluten free option!  I made it as written, but did separate egg and beat egg white into stiff peaks.  Mixed in egg and then folded in egg white.  Baked for 40 minutes.  Honestly, it was PERFECT.  The outside is a bit brownie-like in texture, but the inside is moist, thick chocolate.  I've also made the Flourless Chocolate Cake I on this website and definitely preferred this version.  Not to mention...super easy.

Made this for my husband’s 60th birthday party and everyone loved it!  A small slice is plenty as it is very rich. It has a similar texture and taste to a decadent brownie. Will try it next with 4 oz of semisweet chocolate instead of the cocoa powder as someone suggested.

I made this exactly per directions, with no real expectations because I haven't baked gluten free before. I already had everything on hand, and it was easy. 
It seems more like a giant brownie than a cake, but it's all good! It has a rich, deep chocolate flavour, and is perfect as a small wedge warmed for 20 seconds in the microwave and served with a small scoop of ice cream, or dusted with icing sugar and drizzled with caramel topping.
I would serve this at the end of a dinner party, or any other time, for that matter. It's yummy.

It turned out ridiculously delicious, I doubled the recipe so I could make a layered cake.  I filled two cake pans and it turned out great!!! I made homemade strawberry jam and put it for the top of the first layer of cake, then I put the other layer of cake on top on the jam and then put chocolate ganache on the very top of my cake.  I served it with whipped cream on the side, so it was also very light.  The cake by itself is very rich, so you don't want to put frosting on top of the cake, even if you put the cake batter in cupcake liners in a cupcake tin you will still not want to put frosting because it's still very rich chocolate. Overall was super good and definitely recommend it for others to try

This cake was amazing! I couldn't find bittersweet squares, so I used chips and didn't use a water bath. Instead, I placed a pan of water on the bottom of the oven. I made a raspberry sauce to accompany. Perfection.

The only thing I did differently was cut out a piece of parchment and add it after you butter and cocoa the pan.  It falls right out. I have a convention toaster oven and in 10 minutes exactly,  it's done. It doesn't even need Ganache. I sprinkled powderd sugar and everyone loves it. It's dense but not heavy. It's not crumby and It melts in your mouth.

Good recipe, like others suggested it, I skipped the cocoa and replaced with a total of 8 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate (I used chocolate chips).  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and I still think it was too sweet. I will try it next time with even less sugar!

Easy, quick, and yields an impressive cake that suggests a far more advanced level of baking was involved!

I made this late at night so I wanted a recipe that was quiet (not requiring any noisy electrical appliances such as beaters) and quick. I also approximated Australian equivalent quantities for the sake of ease, and I doubled the recipe (baked one large springform cake and two mini springform cakes).

I used approximately twice the called for quantity of chocolate (I just didn't want any left over chocolate lying around the house!), and therefore reduced the sugar and cocoa slightly.

I also whisked the sugar into the eggs to help it dissolve. 

I served it with whipped cream. The cake turned out perfectly and everyone loved it. Perfectly bittersweet, light yet rich.

Usually you can't take such latitude with baking. But this is a super forgiving recipe because it relies on eggs (rather than a chemical reaction) for air and is quite high in fat anyway. Therefore I think you can safely play with the ratios of chocolate, sugar and cocoa. Might even work to substitute coconut oil for butter for those who can't tolerate dairy.

Divine, easy, crumbly when hot.  Used dark chocolate squares instead of chocolate chips.  Stands up well to cutting shapes with a knife.  Next time I am lining the bottom of my cake pan with a circle of parchment paper, it sticks and cracks the cake.

Absolutely delicious as written! This was our Valentine's Day dessert and it was pure chocolate decadence. I served it with Chef John's Fresh Raspberry Sauce for a perfect finish to our special meal. It was so incredibly easy to make that I can see myself whipping it up often. The leftovers were nice when heated in the microwave per the instructions.

This is a great recipe!!! My brother said it tasted like it should be served in a nice restaurant.
A great hint to avoid any grittiness: mix the cocoa and sugar into the chocolate when you take it off the double broiler. Mine was not gritty whatsoever! I've made it twice, the first time I was short an egg so I threw in a few tablespoons of sour cream. Amazing! Put a thin layer of frosting and it's like a rich fudge cake. Thanks for the best GF dessert ever :)

I've never made anything gluten free before, however I feel that this cake should have been better .  It was very simple, but it came out half an inch thick and it was very soft not cake like it all it wouldn't feed a family of 6 I don't think I would make it again

Made this cake as the recipe calls, it needed about 45 minutes to set up in the oven, then when it came out it collapsed and the center turned to goo. Had to give it 30 minutes in the pan to cool then turned it out onto a cooling rack and it was so gooey it started to go through my cooling rack!! Flipped it out into a pie pan and stuck it in the fridge. But even with the issues, its like a brownie cake, really moist and fudgey. And after it cooled I poured a vanilla bean infused simple syrup on top and frosted with Swiss Buttercream. Holy moly sweet ooie gooie goodness!!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry sauce.  My husband loved it.  It did come out of the pan a bit hard. The second time I made it for our nephew that needs gluten free and dairy free. I baked in a springform pan this time and covered my pan with wax paper as well. I substituted coconut oil and blue agave for the butter and sugar.  I used Hershey special dark cocoa and sifted it before adding to the batter.  I beat the eggs till thick and foamy and then stirred into batter.  Baked for 30minutes as directed.  Although not as tasty as if I had used butter, it was still very good.  Everyone loved it!

Simply the best!  I don't alter it and it is perfect.  I love to make cupcake versions and serve to guests.  Everyone raves and wants the recipe.  Also I have left this in the oven too long a couple times... still fantastic!  Fail proof in my house = complete win!

I have made this yummy cake twice now. Both times I have received great responses. The first time we enjoyed it warm with vanilla ice cream. The second time we enjoyed it with whipped cream, strawberries on mint leaves. One of the comments was, "this cake is much lighter then other flourless cakes I've had." It's rich goodness!

This is NOT an easy recipe to make. I cook but I dont really bake that much. I thought I would try this for a party. Lets start by saying melting chocolate is not an easy thing or even a clean thing. My kitchen was a mess and so was I. To bad chocolate is bad for dogs. Once it was complete everyone loved it! It is very rich. I did use coffee instead of water for extra flavor. I might try it again but Id have to figure out how melt chocolate better.

A chocolate lover's delight! Very easy and quick to make, excellent flavor and texture, absolutely no need for frosting, IMHO, but ice cream or whipped cream (or both!) is a must. 

Use good-quality BITTERSWEET (baking) chocolate for best results, as in the original recipe published in Gourmet Magazine in November 1997. (Gourmet also omitted the vanilla, which is unnecessary but can't hurt.) 

BTW, this is a typical flourless cake -- thin (about 3/4 of an inch thick) and very dense, somewhat like a chewy brownie.

Edible - just - if you like very bitter chocolate. Although this was layered four times with a chocolate glaze - again 70% cocoa chocolate - and cream and strawberry coulis, and despite the chocolate aficionados assurance that 70% cocoa chocolate is the ONLY chocolate - our family of milk chocolate lovers (about 33% cocoa) found this so bitter as to be virtually inedible. We even took pity on the dog and didn't feed it to him! On re-looking at the menu as I'm writing this recipe, maybe by semisweet you mean 50% cocoa chocolate? Here in Oz we don't talk about semi-sweet chocolate. This was to be my daughter's birthday cake; she wanted a flourless chocolate cake and I'm just glad that I made a trial version. I suspect the main issue is that we just are a family that doesn't like bitter chocolate. I'm glad everyone else seemed to enjoy it ;)

This is a giant brownie, not a cake.  Slathered it with bittersweet ganache. It was pretty tasty but will not make again.

This cake is perfect - easy and delicious.  I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa powder and a very good quality semisweet chocolate.  I lined the pan with buttered and cocoa-dusted parchment paper.  The cake came out perfect and it was an excellent desert for Passover.  I made a rasberry coulis which I spooned onto each plate for serving.

I made this recipe for my dad who has celiac disease and requires a gluten free diet. I followed the recipe as written and served with strawberries and vanilla ice cream. I'm not giving this five stars because as a "cake", it disappoints. However, it is a great brownie. It is very fudgy, moist, and dense (not cake-like at all). I would make this again as a brownie in a heartbeat. Also, for those who require gluten free diets, this recipe is way better (and cheaper!) than the packaged GF brownie mixes you buy at the health store.

Excellent.   I followed the advice of someone else and excluded the cocoa powder increasing chocolate to around 8 oz. (used half of a 1 lb. chocolate bar from trader joes).  It was a hit!  I made them into about 8 cupcakes a.k.a. mini cakes for portion control since this dessert is so decident.  We also found that heating the cupcake in the microwave for 10 seconds really enhanced i!

I like this recipe using all chocolate and no cocoa powder. no need to use a water bath and stuff like other recipes call for. I had a hard time getting the cake to release from the pan so i am going to try grease/cocoa powdering it as before but also line the base with a piece of greased parchment paper.

Perfect recipe! I did not use cocoa powder but added extra chocolate and substituted stevia for sugar so that my mother could eat it on her birthday and still obey her ketogenic diet. Everything tastes better guilt free!

Delicious! Very rich and choclatey, which I love. A little difficult to get out of the pan, but I got so many compliments on this cake. I served it with creme fraiche and macerated strawberries.  Fantastic and very easy to make. Plus one of my friends can't eat gluten and she was so happy to hear that it was gluten free - she hadn't had cake in years she said!

So easy to make...I altered the quantities a bit because believe it or not, I couldn't get sugar nor cocoa. Used almost 2 ounces of chocolate instead, same amount of butter, 6 eggs and Toddy (half a cup). Turned out AMAZING!! Perfect as Passover desert, and my family loved it!

I followed the recipe except used 6 oz chocolate chips and heated the cocoa powder with the chocolate chips and butter.  We LOVED it!  It was fantastic. Will be great for company served with homemade whipped cream.

This was very good.  As suggested by another reviewer, I used all chocolate - no cocoa powder. I substituted the cocoa powder with 4 oz of bittersweet chocolate.  The rest of the recipe remained the same.  This reminded me of a cake that is made in a high end bakery in my area.  Mmm Good!

I found it very simplic which is a good thing especially gluten-free. Although I did not understand what a double boiler and the wording on step two how you simmer water with chocolate after it has been melted??? Looks advertising yummy.....

Perfect for the chocolate lover like me.  I used a mixture of bittersweet and milk chocolate bars.  I also used part splenda/sugar.  I did one and a half the ingredients as I only had a 9" pan.  Came out perfect!  My husband couldn't get enough. Thanks.

Excellent flourless chocolate cake!  Tastes just like the one from McCormick & Schmicks!  Very rich but that's what a flourless chocolate cake is supposed to be!  Super easy to make too which makes it even better.  We had to make 1-1/2 recipes because we had only a 9-1/2" round pan and not an 8".  I cooked it for 35 min instead of 30, only because it was a larger portion.  I used the ingredients just like the recipe states and it was phenomenal!  No need for any substitutions.

This was so good!  I forgot to make the glaze to go on top, but it was so rich and the texture so smooth.  I had to laugh at how thin this cake was.  Doesn't look like much, but you don't need a big piece to be satisfied.  Serving it with the glaze and some fresh berries is suggested for ultimate goodness.  I love that this is gluten free.

I’ve made this many times, it’s a family favorite! Here’s a shortcut. Microwave the butter until melted. Add the chocolate. I usually use quality chocolate chips.  Let stand until the chocolate melts.

Everyone who had this loved it. I added some almond extract and poured the batter into extra large muffin tins. I also baked them longer than the recipe calls for, but it was extra humid that day, so I'm not surprised. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

My family loves this recipe.  It is also great to take to parties or bake sales.  It is really very simple.  I replace the cocoa powder with more chocolate like others suggested and it has a rich, chocolate taste.  Adding the hard chocolate glaze to the top finishes it off nicely. We love this served with fresh raspberries, strawberries and a dollop of cream.  Yum!

Amazing. Huge hit. Served dusted with powdered sugar & drizzled with raspberry sauce. I cut down the cocoa powder to 1/4 cup & added more chocolate.

I made this for my B-I-L's birthday party and I didn't even get a piece but apparently it was the best thing that everyone at the party had ever tasted....they all agreed it was so rich and moist. I can't wait to make it for myself! LOL I'm giving it a 5 regardless of the fact that I haven't tasted it because it was ridiculously easy to make and got such rave reviews!

IMO this is more like a brownie; however, it is very good...very rich and chocolate(y).

A huge hit!  I didn't have solid chocolate, so I substituted with chocolate chips.  I made it peanut butter flavored by using 1/2 c pb instead of butter and used peanut butter chips instead of semi sweet.  It was good the first day but 100% better the next so let it sit awhile.

Yum Yum! I needed a recipe for a dessert with no flour and this fit the bill. My husband said it tasted as good as it smelled when it was cooking :) I changed the serving to 10 since I used the springfoam pan and it is 9". Did end up cooking it a little longer than the orig recipe by ~10 minutes.

This was very simple to make and tasted great.  Mine turned out quite flat - not sure if I did something wrong or if it had to do with the 9" (rather than 8") cake pan I used.  Decadent and easy - I'd probably make this again.

Awesome cake!  I skipped the cocoa and added more chocolate squares and it made it a richer torte-like dessert.  I also mixed in 4 or 5 York Peppermint Patties and it gave it a lovely minty flavour.  I iced it with the the hard chocolate glaze recipe on this site and my guests gave it rave reviews.  Best cake they all had ever had!!

SOOO yummy! I made this for my parents' 30th anniversary and they absolutely loved it. It was kind of tough to get out of the pan, so some slices weren't perfect, but I topped it with whipped cream and strawberries so nobody could tell :o)

I made this last night for dessert.  I served it with warm raspberry sauce and it got great reveiws.  I liked the easiness of it. However the next day the leftovers, although delicious, had more of the texture of a rich brownie.  I will indeed make this again.

This was like eating the richest goeyiest fudgiest brownie EVER! I made it for valentines dinner and my man couldn't wait for me to serve it, he just dug right in after dinner.  I hate semisweet chocolate so I used Hershey's Special Dark baking chocolate. Best decision I could have made. It didn't taste like crappy chocolate chips (yuck!). It tasted like something you'd get at a fancy restaurant. A good pan and good oven are important to this type of recipe, but I had neither and lost the middle of the cake (it stuck to the pan), but I blame it on the bad pan and not so great oven I was stuck with. Extra grease on the pan next time and maybe 2 or 3 more minutes baking.

Tasted too much like the cocoa powder, wouldn't come out of pan neatly even after following the directions I felt it was a waste of money... it was to be dessert for Valentine's Day. But other people have had good luck so maybe it's an oven problem on my end.

WOW, yum! So rich and moist. It looked great when I left it on the rack to cool, but when I tried to move it onto a serving plate it fell apart. Literally, into about 5 big pieces. Might have been something I did wrong? It still tasted amazing and I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

It's pretty good! I used Nestle's Chocolatier baking bar (I think that's what it's called!!). I do wish it was a little puffier, but maybe I will whip my eggs a little longer to get a taller cake. Mine was very, very good. Served with whip cream with cointreau added and strawberries! yum.

I was reluctant to make a flourless cake, but I needed something in a hurry.  This recipe was easy to whip up, and the result was so decadent.  I used a 7.5" springform pan because I don't have an 8" cake pan, and it worked wonderfully.  The cake puffed up considerably in the oven, and then fell to about 1" as it cooled.  Aside from the pan, the only other thing I did different from the recipe was I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate instead of semisweet, though I think they are very nearly the same.

I made this for a co-worker's birthday (she has a wheat sensitivity) and it was a TOTAL hit. I agree that the consistency is more of a brownie, which was completely ok with me as I wasn't looking for antyhing overly formal. I made it into cupcakes, lining each tin with parchment paper, then greasing and cocoa-ing the edges. It was time consuming, but I didn't lose a single cake when I pulled them out of the tin. The recipe itself is an absolute BREEZE. I used the microwave to melt the chocolate, then stirred in the rest and I was done! Topped with "Hard Chocolate Glaze". This recipe is fabulous!

The cake turned out much flatter than it appears in the picture, but tastes DELICIOUS! I planned to top it with ganache and strawberries, but the cake is so rich it doesn't need anything else. I'll definitely make this again.

Very rich.  I used Lindt dark chocolate with 85% cocao.  This cake was quick and easy.  A little goes a long way!  I also made it in a square pan and it turned out well.

Absolutely delicious!!  I used 2 eggs and one egg white.  A bit less sugar too.  I made nine cup cake sized (perfectly shaped), but could have made 12 and would've been perfect.  These are very, very rich, so MUST be served with something to balance the richness--I served with vanilla bean icecream and raspberry sauce.  I buttered the pans really well and coated with cocoa, and they came out w/out a problem.  Much like the chocolate domes served at PFChangs!!  YUMMO!
