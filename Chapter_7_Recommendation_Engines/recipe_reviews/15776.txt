We all enjoyed this dish very much.  I did not have any sour cream, so I used all yogurt and it was fine.  The shrimp in the sauce was delicious.  I think next time, though, I will mix the noodles in with the sauce before serving as the noodles seemed a little dry and bland with it just served over the top.  I used a brandy we bought at a winery in Michigan that was made from their grapes.  What wonderful flavors!  We topped it off with fresh-grated parmesan cheese and served with salad, homemade bread and a bottle of Virginia chardonnay.  Thank you!

OUTSTANDING recipe!

Very easy to prepare, but it comes together VERY FAST.  Believe Holly when she says to cook the pasta first.  This dish is a mess for most of its very fast pretparation and then it comes together all at once!

I used scallops and shrimp.  I also substituted Gran Marnier for cognac.  The subtle orange flavor was very good.

Use a good strong Hungarian Paprika.

Thanks Holly for a great one!

I have made this twice, LOVE IT!!! I use shrimp and sea scallops. I do not care for green pepper, so I used only red pepper. I also had no cognac and subsitiuted sherry. I also used vadalia onion rather than scallions. The end result was wonderful. The second time preparing it I used angel hair pasta rather than fettucine. We prefered the Angel Hair pasta to fettucine. Regardless of the changes the recipe is awesome. I will continue to enjoy this one!!! Thanks Holly for a great recipe!

I loved the rich & creamy sauce without the guilt (I also used low-fat yogurt & sour cream).  I used olive oil instead of butter, so the end result was probably a little less flavorful than intended-- I ended up adding cayenne pepper & a hint of parmesan.  The shrimp sauteed in paprika were absolutely delicious!

This did taste fantastic; altho I'm only giving 4 stars because I added WAY more garlic and shallots (does anyone really measure these ingredients anyway??).  But seriously, 1 tsp of garlic in a shrimp/pasta dish??! Ingredient wise it's an awesome dish and doesn't leave you with that heavy feeling that a typical creamy pasta dish often does.  Will be making this often I'm sure, thanks for the great idea!

This was absolutely delicious. And easy too! Next time I think I will squirt it with a lemon before serving.

Holly, this is a great recipe.  I really liked the way the yogurt and sourcream made such a creamy sauce taht tasted like it was loaded with fat but it wasn't.  Especially if you used nonfat yogurt and non-fat sour cream like I did. I will use this yogurt-sourcream sauce on pasta a lot now that I have discovered it. Thanks for a great recipe.  Also I used scallops instead of shrimp.

I would actually give 4 1/2 stars if I could. It has a very nice flavor and pretty easy to make.  Needed something low fat and low salt, so I switched out the shrimp for Tofu and it still tasted good, while being a healthier version. Thanks for posting!

this came out really good, but i modified it to what i had/our likings.. so here's what i did.. used 2 T of capers, and added 2 T of caper juice on top of it since i didn't have the brandy or any comparable liquor.. had a heavy hand with the pepper.. used all yogurt.. tripled the garlic.. used onion in place of shallot.. used all green bell pepper.. tossed in an 8 oz package of slice mushrooms.. added a few shakes of parm.. used elbow macaroni instead of fettuccine.. the bowl might as well have been licked clean.. ty for the start of this wonderful dish

This was soooooooo good!  Hubby loved it.  I only had a pound of shrimp so cut the plain yogurt down to a half a cup.  Also used white wine instead of brandy because it is what I had on hand.  The cilantro was the perfect finishing touch.

This was delicious!! I used penne pasta instead of fettuccine, low-fat sour cream and nonfat greek yogurt.  I mixed the pasta in the sauce before serving so it soaked up the flavors.  Next time I'll try adding some red pepper flakes for some kick.  The leftovers made great lunches too!

Very flavorful and delish.  We used rum instead of brandy and 1t of dried cilantro at the end.  The sauce was more watery than I thought it would be, but still a very good meal.

Great flavor! I used scallops and dried basil instead since I'm not a fan of cilantro.  This dish tasted like summer to me.

This was a great creamy pasta that did not use heavy cream or lots of other high fat ingredients.  I used fat free sour cream and yogurt, and used yellow pepper in place of the green pepper.  Also I and had to omit the brandy because I didn't have any, but I would use it if I have it next time because I think it would be a good addition.
