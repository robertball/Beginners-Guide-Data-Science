This is a great baseline recipe for you to tweak according to what your tastes are or what you happen to have available. It's easy enough to change out the type of milk, yogurt, or fruit. I used unsweetened almond milk, non-fat vanilla Greek yogurt, and bananas in one small jar and blueberries in the other. I also needed some Truvia to sweeten it up a bit. Half the recipe was plenty for my breakfast.

Great easy recipe. You don't exactly need the jar, but if you want to use it, it's still fun. I used regular milk, but sweetened it with honey. I definitely recommend adding fruit before you serve it.

I make a few of these to have them ready for when I am in a hurry.  Somebody mentioned precooking the oatmeal but it is not necessary since rolled oats will soften over night and be as if cooked.  This is perfect for the family on the go.  Make each one up according to personal tastes.  Your family will love you 8)

Some people are saying to cook the oatmeal first... that defeats the purpose of this easy make-ahead breakfast!  If you use the right oats, you don't have to cook ahead.  Add apple sauce and cinnamon, cocoa and bananas, brown sugar, or peanut butter to the jar for some variations.  My kiddos always love this!

So easy! I searched for the simplest overnight oatmeal recipe and this did the trick. After a few tries, I've modified the following: I use half a container of greek yogurt instead of measuring a half cup. I use 1% milk instead of almond milk. I really want grab & go, so I added the fruit when I made it, not the next morning. Sliced bananas and frozen strawberries are a winner. Frozen blueberries didn't translate. I make them two at a time and so far the jar that sat an extra day was better. I might try extending the times to see if I could make four in a batch.

This tasted slimy and uncooked to me.  Another way to accomplish the same goal is (the night before) bring water to a boil, stir in oatmeal, turn down heat to a simmer and simmer for 2-3 minutes.  Turn off heat and let sit overnight and your oatmeal is done in the morning.  Add milk, yogurt and fruit and voila!

I really enjoyed this. I have always wanted to try a recipe like this and I'm glad I picked this one. It was so easy to make. I used regular strawberry yogurt and regular milk. When it was ready to eat I added the sliced bananas,  honey and a dash of nutmeg, so good. I can't wait to try different yogurts, fruits and spices. Thanks for this great recipe.

I d not  precook the oatmeal!!!!! There are endless possibilities! I love it with crushed pineapple. I add some of the juice from the can instead of milk and I never use that much milk. I also add some chia seeds. I make an entire weeks worth and take it to work for breakfast. I also add my fruit at night (except bananas). This is an easy and great breakfast - or snack :)

I made this recipe exactly as specified, using almond milk and peach flavored greek yogurt.  I personally didn't care for it.  I think I was expecting more of a muesli texture.  This had a much richer, almost slimy texture and the oatmeal was chewy in a stale-sort-of way.  Maybe if I switched to a regular yogurt instead of a greek yogurt I would like it better, but I think I will look for a different recipe instead.

Taste was great for me, but officially my son still doesn't like Greek yogurt. So I tweaked it up, and now, I use this recipe all the time as a baseline with vanilla yogurt instead of Greek. This is an amazingly versatile recipe to any taste (even used it to add 1tsb grape jelly and 1tsb peanut butter for some weekend fun breakfast). Thank you!

I tend to get into "jags" with my eating, and this one is my latest.  In the spirit of the season I stirred in pumpkin puree along with cinnamon and nutmeg.  just before eating I topped with a touch of honey and walnuts.  SO Good! Not to mention MUCH less expensive than buying the name brand "seasonal" individual cups!

delicious and so easy to change up the flavors!  We've used vanilla yogurt, vanilla almond milk, flax seed, chia seeds, and  all sorts of fruits and chopped nuts.   Keeps it from getting boring when you can so easily change the flavors.    Great recipe base!

Thought that the ratio of oats to liquids was spot on, especially if you add fruit such as banana.  I used plain oat milk (to cut back on sugar), added half a banana and about a tablespoon of chopped pecans along with generous dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Incredibly flavorful and so much healthier; didn't miss the sweeteners that most instant oatmeal brands have.  I've had this breakfast cold and hot,  both are good and a minute in the microwave doesn't overly thicken the oat milk.

I reviewed this after the first time eating it for breakfast. I thought it was too thick, and I had to add more milk when I went to eat it. However, I ate this for dinner tonight, and I liked how thick it was. I guess I just wasn't in the mood for it the first day. I made a double batch and had enough for 4 servings. I added cinnamon and dried cranberries when I made it, and then added pecans and some cinnamon and sugar on top when I ate it. I definitely liked having the crunch of nuts, because it is kind of gooey when not cooked.

Wasn't sure about "cold oatmeal" at first but intrigued by the nutrition.  Now it has grown on me after a few mornings.  I used Kefir in place of Greek yogurt and skim milk for sweetened almond milk.  I also added 1 Tbsp chia seeds.  Thanks for sharing.
