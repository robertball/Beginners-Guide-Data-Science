Wow!  This cake was absolutely tooooo
sweet.  Adjust sugar to approximately
2 cups.  I never heard of 3 cups of 
sugar to 3 cups of flour.  I made this
and did not serve for Easter.  Made
another cake for dessert.  Much, much
too sweet.

This cake was very disappointing. The texture is quite odd as it is heavy and wet. No one in my family cared for it.

THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT TAKES TO CREAM THE SUGAR AND BUTTER IS A BIT MUCH BUT OVERALL, THIS IS A WONDERFUL CAKE AND FULL OF FLAVOR.

I made this cake last night.  The cake it self was a little on the dry side but the glaze brings it all around.  I loved this cake.  The recipe was easy to follow.  I will keep this recipe and make it again!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because although it was easy to prepare, I thought it was a bit too sweet. I would consider cutting the amount of sugar in it just a bit, maybe 2 cups of sugar instead of 3. A Tasty cake all the same though, Thxs for the recipe

I did not care for this recipe. i make homemade cakes every other day for my family and this was by far the worst! it was dry, not very flavorful at all. i made my own frosting with cream cheese, lemon extract, vanilla, and 10x sugar and that helped somewhat.
