I think any dried fruit would be good in these! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and subbed oat bran for oats (I was out of oats). Walnuts, too, for pecans. Everything worked great. I will let rise just a bit longer next time and try adding a bit more sugar. I also baked a bit longer as they still seemed moist in 25 min. Otherwise, beautiful. SHAPING TIP: While poking a ball of dough is the "fastest" method, forming an 8-inch rope, and pressing ends together very well, makes the best-shaped treats.

I have made these many times now and love them!  I have also tried using different dry fruit from the store and wow....YUM!  I have also made them without my bread machine and think I can make them in about half the time.  They are great and I can't say enough good things about them!

This was so easy in the bread machine, and the bagels were wonderful!  I think this recipe is flexible too, as I added 1/8 cup sunflower seeds and subbed english walnuts for pecans.  My daughter is begging for more of these bagels!  Thanks for a winner of a recipe for ease of prepraration and great taste!

Mine were small, which is perfect for me.  If I can master these and frozen mochas, I will never leave the house. :)

I used currants instead of the dried cranberries, and honey instead of the sugar.  Making 12, I topped 3 with the cinnamon-brown sugar mix, and was disappointed with the sticky finish.  Next time, I will completely omit the topping.  These are great!

I really enjoyed making these bagels - I wondered about it because of having to boil them and then bake! I thought it would be lots of trouble but they were very good for my first try!  I also subbed some whole wheat for part of the flour.  Great toasted for breakfast spread with cream cheese.  I'll be doing more variations with this recipe.  I really like it.  :o)

These were truly delicious!  I will be making them again and again, I'm sure.  It was very helpful to me to read the other reviews.  I took the advice to leave off the brown sugar-cinnamon topping, and they are just wonderful without it.  This was my first time making homemade bagels, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was.

These are super easy to make - don't let all the steps fool you. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and used plain old reg all purpose flour not bread flour and it still turned out great. Salt is important so don't omit. I also agree with some other reviews that I wouldn't do the cinnamon sugar topping next time- it doesn't add a whole lot

These smelled really great, but I think the cinnamon took away from the cranberries, they ended up tasting more like raisins.  I didn't use any nuts.  Was ok, but won't make again.

These are delicious.  I like the combo of nuts, cranberry, and cinamon sugar.  Very easy, too.  I've made bagels before and the directions are on par with the others.  My only side note is that it took me another 10 minutes to bake--they looked a bit raw.  So I added time and they were perfect.  Thanks!  Now I'll have to make several batches of these.

I made these bagels three times, and they turned out delicious each time. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and subbed oat bran for oats. They get eaten as fast as I make them

Bagels were a little bland... the only thing that gave flavor was the cinnanon-sugar topping.  I liked the texture with the oatmeal, but I think I may try tweaking recipe next time.

A little complicated but they're good.
