What a tasty and healthy alternative! Piece of advice - if making for a party, prepare this at the very last minute...after an hour the green gets darker, then after 2 hours, very dark green, and 3 hours its brown. Doesn't look appetizing, but tastes good.

This is a fabulous alternative to frosting. It was tasty. My kids loved it. It has a citrus flavor, so I would only use it on lemon, orange, or other fruity-type cupcakes in the future. Also, it was a little runny and refridgeration didn't help it much. The color does change with oxidation, but not much until a day or two later.

This icing has a good taste but the texture is more stretchy than traditional buttercream.

No complaints here! It was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly - one of the few vegan icings I could find. Will definitely make again!
