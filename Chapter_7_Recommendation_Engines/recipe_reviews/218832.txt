This was the best chili recipe I have tried in a long time.  It was very hearty and had an awesome flavor.  This will definitely be made again.

absolutely the best chili EVER!!!! Using olny ingredients I had on hand.... I did not use the cumin, celery or red pepper flakes and instead of only using kidney beans I used a trio of pintos, black beans and kidneys. Also  instead of garlic cloves I used garlic powder. This is now my go to chili recipe. Even my very picky eaters gobbled this up after insisting they did not like chili. Thank you so much!!!

I did not add the celery. I also used regular diced tomatoes as I didn't have tomatoes with green peppers and onions. I browned the meat with the onion and garlic, then I threw it in the crockpot with the remaining ingredients and let it cook on low all day. I think this is good, but it wasn't chili for *us* until I added more chili seasonings (chili powder, coriander, mexican oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder). After I added the spices and my husband and I tasted-tested, we liked it much better.

I made this recipe as the directions called for:  my husband; took one bite and didn't like it - he didn't like the Italian sausage; my mother said it was ok but she thought it had too much cumin;  
I thought it was too sweet - tomato paste/brown sugar.  I won't be making this again.

So good! The perfect combination of ingredients. I added mini bow-tie pasta to it. I won a chili cookoff with this recipe last year and will be making it again this year!

Delicious!  We made it without any Italian sausage or Worcestershire because we didnt have it on hand, and it was DELICIOUS!  Love the flavor of the kidney beans and the tomatoes.  YUM!

Chiliville Chili Haiku: "Eek, this is too sweet! Needs more beans and less sugar. Overall, okay." I thought it'd be unusual to make a chili that had both ground sausage, as well as the standard ground beef, so I gave this recipe a try, but it was just too sweet for us, either due to the brown sugar, or the Italian sausage. The only change that I made was to halve it, but gosh, 1 can of beans seemed pretty skimpy to all the meat. I'd make it again, but reduce the sugar, drop the sausage, and increase the beans.

This was different from my usual chili, but so very good! (And easy) I plan to make it again and again. Using sausage instead of plain ground beef added a nice flavor.

Just made this dish, recommend you cook it for 2.5 hours, then add the beans. Husband thought it was very good. Easy to make.

Fantastic chili! You can add corn, too... This one is a keeper. Placed in slow cooker after the meat was skillet cooked - everyone loved it. (Also, I doubled tomato paste to make it thicker. Not necessary, but i wanted a thick consistency.)

Who knew what some Italian sausage could do to chili???    The only thing that I did differently was to cut the brown sugar way back, other than that, followed the recipe to the letter.  Great Friday night dinner with very different flavor that came together quickly.  We loved it.

I wanted to make this for the fellows while they watched football but I had to work with what I had.  I omitted the beef broth, replacing it with V8.  I increased the cumin and chili powder and omitted the sugar. It was refrigerated overnight so the flavors had a chance to blend.  They INHALED IT!  This will be made often, I love how the sausage improves the flavor.

I made this with a few modifications to suit our taste and we loved it! Instead of the 3 cans of diced tomatoes I just used one can of Rotel tomatoes and a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. I did one can of kidney beans and one can of pinto beans for a little variety. Based on the comments from other reviewers, I omitted the brown sugar and I'm glad I did. Italian sausage has a bit of sweetness so unless you like your chili very sweet, I would not add it. We topped our bowls of chili with sour cream and chopped avocado and scooped it up with tortilla chips. Yummy!

This is my new go-to chili recipe!  I omitted the celery (didn't have any on hand) and the brown sugar since I do not care for sweet chili, but this was a hit here at home.  I added extra beef broth to loosen it up a little, and next time will only use one can of diced tomatoes, instead of two, but, WOW!  This recipe is a keeper!

Very good chili recipe, I only used 1 celery and next time I will cut down the amount of beef stock to 8 oz and use crushed peeled tomatoes instead of diced.

I made this as directed, other than substituting the ground beef out for deer burger I had on hand.  This chili was just ok.  I liked the addition of Italian sausage, but I would have liked more of a chili flavor.  I would have to add quite a bit more chili powder and cumin to achieve this, but I doubt I will be making this chili recipe again.

I tried this in the slow cooker, cause I thought it would be good that way.  I only made a few adjustments to the recipe.  I put it in the slow cooker, of course, but I also used 1 can red kidney beans and 2 cans of northern white beans, for variety, instead of just 2 cans of red kidney.  I also used plain diced tomatoes, because that is what I had on hand (and as I always say, I believe in using what's available).  Since I didn't have the diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions, I added a green bell pepper, diced. I didn't have any tomato paste, so I left it out.  I used some garlic powder because I didn't have enough cloves, and finally I used 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce (this was an accident, but it turned out yummy, I love Worcestershire sauce, so I left it in my version of the recipe).  I loved this recipe and will use it again for chili.

My first ever Chili Cook Off. Didn't change a thing. And walked away with a 3rd place Ribbon. Johnsonville Hot Italian sausage was the star, every judge made a comment about how obvious it was that I used fresh top quality sausage was what caused this to stand out above all the others.  Great Recipe and fun day thanks to Johnsonville.

This was good.  I made two changes.  I substituted fresh diced bell peppers instead of using diced tomatoes with bell peppers added. Also I let my chili simmer in the crock pot on low for about 5 hours, adding the beans after 3 hours, before serving.  My only critique would be that during preparation it needs salt added.  But that is personal preference.

l went over the reviews before making it. 
 Did not have spicey tomatoes, did use Aylmer tomatoes. 
 Best canned tomatoes l have ever tasted.  Used 1 can, that's all l had, 
 Added an extra tablespoon of chili powder, added a can of hunt's tomato sauce,
 and a cup of beer.  Chef John said beer brings out the tomato flavor. 
 Added a cup of celery diced. and a full onion.
 Used Johnsonville hot ltalian sausage.  
 Added a few more spices since l didn't add spicey tomato's with onions and peppers.  
 Did not drain the fat, cooked everything for 1 hour, then put it in a slow cooker
 for 6 hours, best chili l have ever tasted.  Everything else by the recipe. 
 l love the tomato taste with a good chili taste.
 l like to make things a few times before handing it out, this way my friends think l'm a good cook. 
l will make chili this way, best l've ever tasted.
Mine was ready in 8 hours.

Absolutely the best I've ever had. Ground turkey works well in place of beef. Made no other substitutions. When you put a bite in your mouth, the first thing is a burst of flavor, followed by a slightly sweet flavor, followed by a nice peppery heat. It is very easy to adjust the heat without changing the flavor. This will be my "go-to" chili!

I was looking for a recipe that was closer to a Wendy's style chili and I think this is great!  I made it without changing a thing.

This chili had the perfect amount of spice. I followed it to the letter but added a can of corn because I always loved chili with corn. Compliments to the chef :)

This recipe is excellent!  I don't get why   people say this is too sweet. I used the 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and it wasn't sweet. Everything blended perfectly. I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage links and removed the casings. I used fresh green, red and orange bell peppers because I don't buy diced tomatoes with bell pepper, I had the plain ones. I followed the recipe the rest of the way except when it came time to simmer it, I put it in my crock pot for about 5 hours , adding in the beans the last 2 hours. I have always used celery in my chili, not sure why so many thought this was an unusual ingredient. We enjoyed this tonight with cornbread and saltine crackers. It was delicious and has moved up on my list as one of my favorite chili recipes!

This is a really good chili! I like the addition of sausage along with ground beef. I did sub the beef broth with beer to add more flavor, which I always do.  My only complaint is that this was not spicy enough for me, but I like really spicy.  This is a great chili for a crowd since it is mild enough for everyone and then guests can add more hot sauce to their own liking! I would definitely make this again.

I attended a cooking school class and this was 1 of the recipes prepared. The next night I tried it myself skeptical that it would have great flavor because of the cooking time.  We were Pleasantly surprised!!  It has great flavor without the waiting time of traditional chili.  definitely 1 of my weeknight recipe go-to's

Me & my husband loved this chili!  Much lighter than other recipes I've tried, but still super duper filling.  I thought that since it wasn't so thick or heavy, I would be able to eat more of it, but I was pretty full after just a small serving.  It was hot in that it helped raise your body temp and make you sweat as you ate it (so perfect for those cold winter nights!), but it wasn't very spicy, which was great because I'm not a fan of those "set your tongue on fire for the sake of it" types of chili recipes, and don't like spicy stuff in the first place.  I paired it with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread (cut up "croutons" to sprinkle on top, along with some shredded cheese) and it was AMAZING.

I made this for dinner tonight. The two meats together are really good. I would add a little more liquid as we like our chili a bit soupy. I would leave out the celery next time. Just not a normal chili ingredient for us.

Delicious! I have never made chili before with Italian sausage (I usually just use pork), so this was a first for me. It came out great! Really the only thing different I did was add a little smoked paprika and chipotle seasoning, and I omitted the celery. We just finished a big bowl over fritos and smothered in Italian blend cheese. Yum! I really believe the sweetness of the sausage made the dish. I will be making this again.

This recipe is amazing!! I omitted celery and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Wow!!! I had to make it twice just so I could take a picture of it. All I got was a basic photo that doesn't do it's justice. We will keep this recipe and use it as much as possible. Wonderful!

Very tasty! I mis-read the ingredients before going to the store, so I had to improvise on the tomatoes - used 1 (14.5oz) can of diced tomatoes with onion, celery & bell pepper along with 3 (10oz) cans of diced tomatoes with green chilis - but I really doubt that made much of a difference. I used the Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage and I did simmer for a longer time (probably an hour), but only because we were't ready to eat. Everyone really loved this chili!

Ok, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  I have always used ground chicken in place of the ground beef, but this time,I went exactly as written.  The result???? Pretty dang good!  I used ground sirloin.  We loved it!  I love ground chicken and will remain a fan, but using beef in this was definitely the way to go!   Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for the recipe.  I made it just as written except that I used splenda instead of brown sugar and precooked turkey sausage.  It was very good and filling and easy to assemble.

I was cheap and had some Italian turkey sausage in the fridge that I substituted for the regular sausage.  My grocery list was long enough without.  The end result you really couldn't taste turkey at all.  The chili itself was absolutely wonderful.  The spices made it just right.  Maybe a little spicy for me, but the family loved it at just that point.  I also really liked the celery in it--not something I'd usually think about putting in chili.

Only changes I made were that I used three different kinds of diced tomatoes. (With onions and garlic, fire roasted, etc). I sautéed the beef, sausage, onions, garlic and celery together. Then I put them in a large pot, added the other ingredients and simmered for 20mins. Served as suggested with cheese and sour cream and onions. The second time I made it I added 3 Tbs. chili powder and the spice level was better. Also, if using dried beans, soak them overnight, then simmer Gently in lightly salted water for 1 hour. Reserve cooking liquid. Use half bean liquid and half water to add your bouillon to create beef broth.

This is sooooo good.  I always make a double batch then freeze some.  Freezes very well.  Unfortunately for me I don't add the beans (hubby doesn't like them).    Serve with good ole' homemade cornbread for a delish meal!!!

My husbands favorite chilli recipe now.  I used a couple varieties of beans - black and kidney, and also added corn (fresh if you have it, frozen if you don't).  Creates some visual interest as well as a texture.

I won a chili cook off today with this recipe!! I realized at the last minute that I didn't have brown sugar, so substituted a little honey and it was great. Loved it!

This was really good! A lot less labor-intensive than the chili I usually make, and packed with flavor. I really like the added punch from the sausage and the slight hint of sweetness from the brown sugar. I made this exactly as written and would definitely make it again. I used the 50% lower fat Chicken & Pork sausage. I like to let it simmer longer than 20 mins for the flavors to really blend. Yum!

Best Chile EVER!  I can say this because I don't like Chile!  The sausage was the key ingredient, in my opinion.  My husband thought the addition of celery was genius (I just let him think it was my idea!).  This is a monthly "must have" for us from now on during winter months.  Thanks Johnsonville for great sausage and a great recipe!  Love the idea someone gave of adding bow tie pasta!

This is a good chili recipe.  Season to taste.  The Italian sausage adds a nice flavor to the chili.  My family loves it served in a homemade bread bowl.

I made this for our small group and it was well liked by everyone. Several people went back for seconds! I will definitely make this again. I had shredded cheese and sour cream to add if desired and I served corn bread and a salad to go along with it.
I liked it so much that I ate a bowl of it for breakfast the next morning :)

The best chili I have had! No more buying chili seasoning packets. I did adjust the sausage & beef ratio to meet our preference. I used 1/2 sausage to 3/4 beef. Other then that I served on cornbread waffles. Enjoy!

My teen and I made this for dinner last night - and though the whole family enjoyed it, we all agreed that it was a little too tomato-y for us, and it had more liquid than we like.  To solve that, I think I would simmer at least half of the time with the lid off.  We did like the combination of ground beef and Italian sausage, which I will incorporate into my personal recipe going forward.  :)

I always use grilled hamburger in my chili, V8 juice, and jalepenos.  The Italian sausage was an interesting twist.  I will skip the sugar next time.

Definitely a good chili, though I did make some changes.  I omitted the celery because my husband doesn't like it.  I only used 2 cans of beans and subbed 24 oz of salsa for all of the diced tomato.  Turned out great!

This was good with a few tweaks! I thought it was a little sweet and needed more flavor so I added about 2 tsp. salt, and an extra tbls chili powder and an extra tsp. of cumin. I also let it simmer for 40 minutes instead of 20. This help to deepen the flavors. I served mine with shredded cheddar, sour cream and green onions on top. I also used this chili for chili fries...yum!

Good flavor, but not quite enough heat for my taste. I'll add a dash of hot sauce next time.

I tweaked this recipe and not for any other reason except I screwed up my grocery shopping.  I used two small onions and chopped up one medium green bell pepper due to not having the tomatoes with onion and green bell pepper.  I discovered my beef broth was gone, so I added a cup of water and two teaspoons of garlic salt after discovering I didn't have garlic either.  I used two cans of Italian style plum shaped tomatoes in puree (1 lb. 12 oz. each) since I didn't have tomato paste and love the extra tomatoes.  I followed the rest of the recipe the way it was written, and have been cooking enough to know that my changes wouldn't severely alter the taste.  Loved the chili recipe, and it put a kick into my usual go to chili fare!

I made this last night with the Johnsonville® Italian Ground Mild Italian Sausage. It came out great. My tomatoes had onion, celery and green pepper so I did not add any additional celery. I also only used 1 tbs. of chili powder. I was concerned it may be too spicy with two. This was a delicious and hearty chili!

The addition of sausage was a nice variation on our usual chili.  I added molasses instead of the brown sugar and it turned out very well.  Everyone enjoyed it.
