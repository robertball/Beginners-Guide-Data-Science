Really tasty! I don't have a slow cooker, so I sauteed some onions and garlic in a large pot, tossed the rest of the ingredients in the pot and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, added the chicken in and allowed it to simmer for another 15-20 minutes and my husband loved it!

This chili was good.  I scaled it down to 3 servings and while preparing it, I accidentally grabbed the beef broth instead of chicken broth so it was not quite a white chili in appearance.  However, it tasted good with a nice level of spiciness and combination of spice.  I will make it again (using the chicken broth next time!)

White Chili V Haiku: "Fantastic chili! (But what's a 'jar' of white beans?) Not quite thick enough." I had cooked and shredded 4 bone-in chicken breasts in my crockpot and saved the broth, so I used the 2 cups of chicken from that, along w/ the leftover stock. (Surprised at the addition of crushed tomatoes, as the white chilis that I've always made mostly consist of chicken, hominy, white beans, and spices, and no "red" ingredients.) Also used 2 cans Great Northern, 1 can Cannelini, as I wasn't familiar w/ 48 oz. jars of beans. Threw in a half-empty bag of frozen corn, and"Taco Seasoning I" instead of packets, and well, this was a pretty awesome chili, buuuut it was too watery/more soup consistency than I'd have liked, but still tasty nonetheless.

I don't think it should be called white chili if it has a can of tomatoes in it.
