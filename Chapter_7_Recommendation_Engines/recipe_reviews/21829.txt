I make these all the time but the cook time and meaurements are different. I use about 3/4 of a pound bag of pretzels, 1 package of ranch, 1 tablesspoon garlic powder and 1 tablespoon of dried dill and definitely not olive oil! Use vegetable oil and use just slightly over 1/2 a cup. Cook at 250 and stir to coat every 15 minutes for 1 hour. I promise they will be perfection. I have made them for years and they have been a hit, each and every time.

My family makes pretzels similar to these...however they don't need to be baked.  Prepare and let the pretzels "marinate" in the oil mixture for 8 to 10 hours (shaking or stirring every so often to get the oil distributed) and the mixture will soak into the pretzels.  Also, replace the oil with popcorn oil for added flavor (as mentioned by another reviewer as having done).  These are addicting!

Well folks, I did some testing.  My sister wants to serve these on the appetizer table at her wedding, so I did a trial run. First time I did three batches, using three different oils, and then baked half of each batch and let the other half unbaked.  For each batch I used 16 oz pretzels, 1/2 cup oil, 1 package Ranch (I had the bulk stuff, so I used 3 T which is almost 1 oz), 1 T garlic, 1 T dill weed.  I tried them with EVOO, veggie oil, and melted butter.  Results?  As far as the oils, I personally liked the EVOO best, but it isn't significantly better, so we are going with veggie oil for the wedding.  Melted butter didn't work well. It clumped up and definitely needed baking.  As far as baked vs unbaked, there was really no significant difference, other than I thought the baked ones tasted slightly burned.  I baked at 250 for 28 minutes.  Even with only 1 T garlic, the garlic was overwhelming.  I just mixed up a second batch using 16 oz pretzels, 1/2 cup veggie oil, 4 T ranch mix (if you are using the packages, I'd just go with one package) and 3 T dill.  Skipped garlic altogether. Didn't bake.  Much better.  These keep well, prob. for 2 weeks. Tip: get good quality dill.  The first I got from a bulk food store, and it tasted like dried grass.  Then I got some from Frontier Herbs, from a bulk bin at a health food store.  It was much darker green, and is delicious.  I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because of the huge garlic amount, and because it doesn't need baking.

These were so easy and went over very well at a Supebowl party.  I did use vegetable oil as per some reviewers advice.  While I love olive oil it does have a very distinctive flavor that I just didn't see lending itself well to such a "snacky" food.  I used 1 tbls of both the garlic powder and dill as well, again per reviewers advice.  I will certainly make these again and again.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but
I don't usually have dry ranch dressing
mix on hand. I made up the core ingredients of seasoning that's in ranch
dressing, used vegetable oil instead
of olive (because olive oil tends to
be a bit heavy when making snacks like 
this) and added about a 1/4 c. of grated
Parmesan/Romano cheese. Tasty. Good 
change from your usual pretzel.

Made these many times.  People ask me to make them all the time now too. I use only a half cup of oil and often use veggie (or regular olive oil, not extra virgin).  Also I use 1 TB garlic powder, 1 TB dill and 1 TB lemon pepper instead of the 3/3.   I usually about 1/4 tsp of cayenne for heat.   And I cook at 250 for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  Yeah, yeah, I know I made of ton of changes.  It's developed over the couple of years I've been making them.  I still think my rating and review are valid, the recipe is quality just for the idea alone.

Excellent recipe that is sooooo simple!  I took the advice of others and used vegetable oil vs. olive oil and cut that to a little over 1/2 cup.  I also used 1 tbsp. each of garlic powder and dill vs. three.  I put everything into a tupperware container to toss and marinate.  I think you just have to judge with your oven - start with a low temp. and toss every 10 minutes until done.

I use butter flavored popcorn oil when marinating pretzels instead of olive oil.  I love the light buttery flavor along with the other spices.  I've never made marinated pretzels with the big sourdough pretzels until today and I liked it better.  They're not as pretty, but they soak up the flavors much better.  Yum!  They're addictive.  If you're serving them to more than 4 people, you might want to make a double batch!

I make pretzels similar to this all the time & everyone seems to love them.  I only use about 1/3 cup of oil & do not bake them at all.  They dry out after an hour or two & are ready to eat. I took away 1 star because you definitely don't need that much oil & Why bother baking them?  I use the tiny twists & only add the ranch dressing mix & dill to taste.

Way too much dill. It really ruined the pretzels. Go with suggestions if using this recipe.

I use pretzel sticks and extra virgin olive oil. The EVOO adds even more depth and people try to guess the flavor. When I tell them they respond with Yes that's it! They love them.
I've made them with Orvile Redenbacher's butter oil too but the EVOO wins for flavor. Better for you too. 
I also don't cook mine. I mix it all in a resealable bag and roll it around once in a while for two hours.

I came on line to add this recipe to All Recipes. My sister's version is almost the same but adds lemon pepper (1/2 tbs) to the marinade. She also uses only 2 tbs each of garlic powder and dill weed.

These pretzels are fabulous. I made 6 batches for Christmas and all are gone. So I guess I will be making more for New Years. My family uses them as hostess gifts. Save the pretzel bag abd refill it when the mix is cooled. Put into a pretty basket and there you go!!

Addictive! I used the pretzel twist and added butter flavored oil instead of veggie oil.  Next time will reduced the garlic and dill from 3 tbsp. to 2 tbsp. Saw no difference with the pretzels being baked or not.  Will leave out the baking step. Marinate in Ziploc, coat oil evenly then coat with dry mix evenly, let stand for an hour or two to soak it all in and enjoy.

This is the 2nd "doctored up" pretzel recipe I've tried off this site and I have discovered that I think pretzels taste best by themself. Thanks anyway.

Great and simple recipe.  Also better for you than the recipes with popcorn oil. We love salty, so I added some lemon pepper and celery salt. Thanks

If you use mini-pretzels, don't use this recipe!!! I didn't read the reviews and put in the 3/3 garlic powder/dill and it was WAAAAYYYYYY too much! Next time I will try the 1/1. Note: if you think the pretzels have too much seasoning, you can put them in a brown paper bag and shake them. A lot of the seasoning came off and they were edible.

These were good!  I burned some by mistake (oven up too high!) and we STILL ate them all!  A nice snack for our family to munch on over Christmas weekend.

You can make this without the ranch mix if the mystery ingredients scare you!  Just make this recipe without the ranch mix-- 3/4c extra virgin olive oil, 2 table spoons of dill, 3 tablespoons of garlic powder. The flavor of the olive oil is great!  I don't know why people don't like it, just make sure it is extra virgin olive oil.

Very good.  At first the dill seemed a bit much, but my wife and I began to crave them.  I would say adjust the amount of dill weed according to your preference, but the balance of dill and salty pretzel is both novel and refreshing.

I had ceasar dressing mix on hand and pretzel sticks... can only imagine how wonderful it will be on sourdough pretzel chunks with ranch.  As good as the flavored pretzel bites that cost you a fortune at the store.  Looking forward to trying with lots of different seasoning flavors!!!

I thought these were good.  Used Orville Redenbachers Popcorn Oil instead of no flavor oil - but I use Penzeys garlic powder and 3 T was WAY too much.  They were very garlicky.  Next time I make them, I think I will leave the garlic out, they don't need it with the ranch.  And I agree, they don't need to be baked, just wait until the next day and they are perfect.

This was just ok.  I followed the recipe, except I used pretzel sticks.  The olive oil seems way to strong, I could taste it in every bite.  I would think an oil to just help it all stick to the pretzels would be better, vegetable oil maybe.  Definitely cut back on the dill by a tablespoon or so.  I love dill, but it was too much.  I don't think I will make these again.  Edit:  By the next day the olive oil soaked in very nicely, blended with all the other flavors, and made this a hit with the family!  I guess they just needed to set longer.  I think I will still try veg. oil next time, and a little less of it, but I will probably try these again!

I felt the dill was overpowering and could barely taste the ranch. I also felt the pretzels tasted burnt. Next batch I will up the ranch, lower the dill and garlic powder to be safe. And taste before baking and use a lower temp in the oven.

This was a great recipe and easy to throw together for a Super Bowl party.  As per some of the reviews I only used 1 tbs of Dill and 1 tbs of garlic.  I thought it was still a bit too much garlic.  Next I make this, which I will, I will only use 1/2 tbs of garlic.  
Thanks for sharing!

These were a big hit with a large group of teens. I doubled the recipe, using grapeseed oil, as it doesn't have a distinctive taste to distract from all the spices.  I put them in a 2 gallon bag to marinate. They were best right out of the oven. But a word of warning...be attentive..some of mine burned.

Way too garlicky!  And I love garlic.  Next time will try 1 Tbsp garlic and a different oil.  Has potential for greatness though.

I used the 1 tbsp of garlic powder and dill weed, a whole packet of ranch, and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil  version and I did not bake them and they turned out pretty good! I just let them marinate in a bag for awhile shaking it every so often!

I thought these were very good.  I would add more pretzels though which would suit my taste.  Also did a 1/2 c. oil, 1 T. each garlic powder and dill.  I baked for an hour mixing every 15 minutes.  They were a little to salty for me so next time I would not dump the bag of pretzels but leave out the salt that falls off and is in the bottom of the bag.

I vary this recipe by adding 1-4 t of Cayenne Pepper and 1T of Onion Powder.  I also have found that you need to add olive oil while baking to prevent a bunch of powder in the bottom of the pan.  Everyone loves these.  I've also found that, if they are going to be eaten within a few days, you can add butter while cooking and it makes them richer and smoother.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this as is and altered it to suit us.  We prefer the altered recipe.  I cu the oil to 1/2 c, and cut spices to 1T each of dill, garlic powder, dry ranch dressing, and lemon pepper.  I was asked for the recipe by several people.  I marinated them in a plastic gallon bag for ease.  I also baked my pretzels at 350 for only 10 minutes.

I also decreased the dill and garlic powder to 1 T. each, and I decreased the olive oil.  I couldn't taste the garlic powder, though.  The dill definitely would have been too powerful with the full 3 T.

These were such a hit, I was asked to make them again the next weekend.  The only thing I changed was I used half the amount of dill and garlic powder the recipe called for...I thought that was plenty of seasoning.

This was pretty good.  I put these in little cellophane bags to give out at Christmas time.  I do suggest reducing the amount of oil to 1/2.  I used 1/4 olive oil and 1/4 vegetable oil.  The olive oil taste was strong the first day as someone else had mentioned, but the second day, they tasted much better.  I also reduced the garlic powder to 2 tablespoons and it was still a bit too garlicy, in my opinion.  I did not have dill weed around, but I will make sure I get some next time.  I used to love the oyster crackers made this way and I think it was the dill weed that gave it that yum factor!  I will update my review when I try that!  I recommend doing these as gifts because I had a couple of gift receivers who were diabetic and they could not eat the cookies that I baked, but they ate these.

I have been making a similar recipe and everyone loves them. Its a little different then this one. I use the big sourdough pretzels and break them into bite size peices, 3/4 Vegetable oil and only 2 tablespoons of dill and garlic (along with the ranch dressing packet). They are baked at 200 for 1 hour, stirring every 15 mins. Everyone asks me to bring them to cookouts! There is never any left overs.

I loved this!  I had friends over & forgot about the pretzels in the oven. The 1st batch cooked 15 min instead of 10, and they came out burnt.  The sceond batch I remembered about and they were excellent.  A few people did not care for the dill.  Everyone wants a batch, so I will be making them again just w/o the dill.

Except for leaving out the dill weed (didn't have any), I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. Used sourdough pretzels that came in bite-size pieces - nicer than breaking up big ones. Took these to a women's event where they went unnoticed amidst the other snacks for awhile, but eventually people got started on them and ate most of them. My husband didn't like them, but that's just him. If I make these again, I would use less garlic. Also I found I liked these better after a day or two.

I made them with the ranch, 1 Tbl. Garlic powder and 1 Tbl
Dill. I used 1/2 cup canola oil.  I let them marinade for 1 hour and then put them in the microwave for 3 minutes but stirring after every minute. Delicious!

Made it according to the recipe the first time, and brought it to a party for friends to try.  The general consensus was positive and they are definitely good with a cold beer.  I fwlt it was too heavy on the garlic.  I have since made them two more times, both times lessening the garlic powder from 3 T to 1 T and then adding 2 T of other salted spice mixes.  Tried Penzey's Fox Point - excellent.  Also tried We Dat's Original - also excellent.  I'm going to continue to experiment, using these ratios, as these pretzels are turning out great.  I've have been baking for 15 minutes at 250 degrees to avoid over browning.  Thanks for posting this recipe!  I encourage others to try it and experiment a little!

I followed the recipe exactly. In my opinion, there was too much oil and way too much garlic. If I were to do these again, I would use vegetable oil, 1 tsp garlic and cut the dill in half. These are going in the trash.

This is a favorite at our house.  It makes great gifts, too.  Here are a few hints that work for me.  I buy the pretzels at Dollar Tree, Pennsylvania made. I use whatever they have.  I cut the garlic powder down to two tablespoons.  Have an extra bag of pretzels on hand because you can add more as you go along.  Also, I cut a small hole in the bag to shake out the excess salt. Lastly, I don't bake them.  I just put them out to dry on waxed paper then put them in airtight containers.  Since I'm on a mission to save money, I make my ranch dressing using a recipe from  a copy cat site.

I've made these for years.  Its one of those special treats, but so addicting!   I use grapeseed oil,  add 1/2 tsp onion  salt and 1/2 tsp of lemon pepper to my mix in addition to what is listed here.

I never put mine in the oven.  I use the microwave.  Make sure the pretzels are in a large/deep microwave bowl.   Stir well, microwave on high for 2 minutes.  Stir again, microwave again for 2 minutes.  Stir well,  cover and let cool.

Keep the mouth wash handy!

I made some changes. 1/2 c popcorn oil, 1tbsp each seasoning plus packet of ranch. Toss pretzels in oil then sprinkle seasonings and shake all in paper bag. I shook them 5/6 times in couple hours bonus is paper bag soaks up some excess oil

Great recipe. My fiance loves it. I had to make a few tweaks, though. There was way too much garlic. I dropped it down to a single tablespoon of garlic instead of three. You also don't need that much oil. Depending on what you use, start with a quarter of a cup, mix in the seasoning, and add oil until it's loose and will easily spread over the pretzels. I usually end up with nearly half a cup. And I never use large pretzels like is suggested. I use pretzel sticks.

Halfway through mixing ingredients I realized I only had garlic salt (instead of garlic powder). If you're in the same boat, no worries-- you can sub in garlic salt and it will still taste great!

I used 1/2 c vegetable oil and slightly less than 2 tbsp each of the dill and garlic. A big hit at work.  One cannot purchase in flavoured pretzel chunks here so I used sourdough pretzel twists from the bulk food store.  I plan to try this recipe using nacho cheese seasoning.

Been making these for years, but with mini pretzels. They are fabulous and everyone asks for the recipe.  I am going to try these with the big sourdough pretzels from Costco. Yum! (Only bake for 5" if using mini pretzels.)

I used a 20 oz bag of mini pretzel sticks, used olive oil and only a 1/2 cup, doubled the ranch mix because I love ranch, cut the cayenne in 1/2 and put extra 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt. Perfection! Quite a little kick. Can't imagine if I'd used the full amount of cayenne or less pretzels. These are perfect!

Way way way too much dill weed and probably too much garlic. I couldn't even taste the ranch dip by the time I was done. Then there was the ton of seasoning all over everything trying to eat it. I even had a bigger bag of pretzels than this recipe called for. I ended up pouring the pretzels in my collander and sifting out as much of the seasoning as I could. It is somewhat edible but it will take a while to get the dill taste out of my mouth. I will try it again but with much less dill weed and garlic. Again I can't even taste the ranch. I've made ranch pretzels before but my ranch was always clumpy with the oil so I was looking for a better way to make them. Before I had coated the pretzels with oil then added the dip which made the dry seasoning clumpy. I also tried mixing them together but I couldn't taste the ranch (maybe too much oil). Maybe with a lot less dill and garlic I might get a recipe I can take to family gatherings.

As written, this recipe is flawed. ( eight people at the gathering all said the same).  It requires much to much garlic powder  and dill.  A third of the amount is sufficient .  On the second try, I decreased the oil t 1/2 cup.  With suggested changes from other reviewers I would give 4 stars.

My family has been making these for years. I always find the amount of seasoning overpowering.  I finally tried using only 1/2 of a packet of ranch dressing and 2T of the Dill and Garlic Powder.  Kept the oil the same (used Olive Oil just cuz I had more,  I have also used Orville's popcorn topping oil and canola... not much difference)  Also I like to use a butter flavor pretzel.  I should mention, I have made both with "marinading" and without and there was no difference.  

 My fam liked the pretzels much better this time.  I served with Champion Dip recipe from this site, awesome!

I make these a lot during the Holidays.  I omit the garlic powder (way too much garlic!)  and I never bake them, they come out great!  I use a plain vegetable oil instead of olive oil to let the  Ranch flavor come thru.  Sometimes I'll do half pretzels and half cheese or goldfish crackers.  Excellent!

I was looking for a recipe that my grandmother used to make and started with this recipe as a base.  However,  my grandma always used Orville  Redinbocker's  popping topping as the oil. I used the smaller Roll Gold Tiny Twists instead of bigger  pretzels. I only used 1tsp of garlic powder,   1TBL of dill weed, and a 1 oz. pkg of ranch seasoning.  I  coated and stirred every few minutes for about 30 mins.  Then cooked at 250F for 20 mins,  stirring every few minutes.  Thank you for helping me find a good base recipe, even though I significantly changed a few things.   Very helpful!

I made these as the recipe says and they were way too seasoned.  I  made them to take to a party and barely any were eaten.   I might try it again sometime and cut the ingredients in half or just brush the mixture over the pretzels before putting them in the oven.

My family found these waaaaay too garlicky!!! 3 Tablespoons garlic powder?  Way too much.  These ended up in the garbage. I think the recipe would be great, depending on your tastes, but personally I need to tone the garlic way down.  Deserves to be fiddled with though, to find a good balance for you.

Very good & very easy recipe.  I used 1/2 a bag of pretzels, a .75 ounce packet of ranch drssing mix and 1 1/2 tbs of the seasonings; everything came out tasting really good. Since my family is big on garlic, I might up that a little more next time (it's not "just right" unless you stink like it all day, lol). I used the smaller waffle pretzels & 6 minutes was PLENTY of time to bake them, I am guessing the 10 minute timing probably pertains to the larger sourdough pretzels that the author of the recipe suggests using.  In any case, thanks for sharing a cheap & easy snack recipe!  :)

Very easy, and very popular at parties.  My friend promised me that you don't need to bake them and she was right.  You just flip the bag every few hours whenever you go into the kitchen.  So simple and delicious (and ADDICTING!)

To keep it low in cal, I only used 1/2 a cup of olive oil. I also altered it to 1 and 1/2 tbsp. of garlic powder instead of 3 tbsp.

This recipe is wonderful. I have made it before using oyster crackers instead of pretzels. The pretzels are better I think. Next time I'm going to cut the garlic powder a bit. But still a hit!

Yummy!  I made this recipe twice, using different pretzels each time.  The first time I used broken rods.  They were saltier and had a mild ranch taste.  The second time I used waffle shaped pretzels.  They had a bolder ranch taste.  Both were a great snack though!

I make this often, but I use Orville Redenbacher's Popcorn Oil instead of the olive oil. Then I bake the pretzels (without marinating)in oven at 200 degrees for about 15 minutes. I love it.

Great with beer or wine! I used only 2 Tbsp of garlic powder (did not have more), therefore added 1/2 Tbsp garlic salt and reduced dillweed to 2 Tbsp. It worked out wonderful. Thanks

If you want to make a snack that your guest wont be able to keep their hands off of, this recipe is for you!  These pretzels are wonderful...you can't stop eating them!  I used a local pretzel (Hammond's) and Hidden Valley ranch dressing mix.  I also took another reviewers advice and added a little lemon pepper.

I've made something similar with oyster crackers but I like this better. Yum, no leftovers and rave reviews from a crowd of men at a golf outing.
