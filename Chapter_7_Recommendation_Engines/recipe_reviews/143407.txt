This was very very good. I cut the salmon into four fillets, wrapped them in foil, and baked with a little bit of salt, pepper, and olive oil at 350 degrees F.

When they were just barely done, I spread the sauce on them and let it bake some more uncovered so that the sauce just barely browned.

Company Worthy and Restaurant Quality!  Be sure to make your sauce ahead of time to let the ingedients meld.  I added more dijon, lemon, and the 4 cloves of garlic made it very garlicky!  But it's all good, believe me!  I baked the salmon too, only because of thunderstorms here.  400 degrees for 17 minutes - - perfect.  Austin, this is one fabulous recipe.

Very good.  Only suggestion I have: make the sauce ahead (a couple of hours if possible) and put in the fridge until ready to serve.

The flavor of the sauce was a lot more tangy than I expected - which is good! I baked the salmon 'cuz I would have wrecked it on the grill - believe me. Otherwise prepared as written. Really nice - even my 19yo (a man of few words) said it was "awesome." Thanks for the recipe, Austin! Sorry my pic didn't turn out as well as I hoped, and yes it IS worth the calories! SunnyB ;)

This dish has a great concept. I really enjoyed topping the salmon with lemon slices. However Tarragon was not the right herb. I would suggest dill or some other alternative. As well, I found the salmon to be a bit dry. Next time I made it I wrapped it in tin-foil and baked it for just over 15min at 400F. Perfect!

I went to Costco yesterday and got some salmon and decided to try out a new recipe.  This one seemed to be easy enough and I trust a previous reviewer so I had to give it a shot.  I'm glad that I did.  It turned out super.  And Mike is right on the money with the time tables.  Very tasty!

10 minute prep time, 10 minute cook time.  So quick & easy.  Blend the sauce very well to mix flavors.  From first to last bite the taste put a big smile on my face.  Outstanding.  I will definately serve this to company.

I was surprised at how tasty the lemon garlic sauce was! I ended using trout and baking the fish, so the 2 tbsp of olive oil called for grilling wasn't necessary. And the amount of sauce they tell you to put on each 4oz piece of salmon is WAY too much. If you cut the sauce in half, you will still have plenty to use (and it will save you some calories).

I was a little concerned that this would taste like mayo but the sauce was great. I also added lemon pepper to the salmon and made it on the Foreman grill. Great!

This was a fabulous recipe and a wonderful tasting sauce! I'd never cooked with tarragon before - I am not a fan of anise - but it was delicious and the licorice taste was subtle. Thanks for the keeper!

I agree with Mike in that this is certainly a company worthy dish. Can't wait to make this for my friend Ro. I made this for lunch today and didn't need to grill the fish as I had salmon in the freezer that my hubby had smoked last month. I used lite mayo and it still made a fabulous sauce. I'm not a huge tarragon person, so I used snipped chives instead. Shared this with my daughter and we both loved it. Thanks a bunch Chef Austin!!

Outstanding!  I was afraid the garlic and lemon would overpower the salmon but I was so wrong.  I must prepared salmon 50 different ways and, so far, this is a hands down favourite.  I took the advice of a few reviewers and prepared the sauce a few hours ahead and because I'm not fond of cold sauces over hot dishes, I applied the sauce for the last half of the cooking time and reserved some of the cold sauce for dipping.  What a treat!  My wife steamed some broccoli with garlic and red peppers then chilled it and added some olive oil and I baked some sweet potatoes with a splash of honey to complete the plate and it turned out to be one of those dinners where everything complimented everything else.  Our discussion over dinner (between mmmm's and 'oh yeah's' was about who we could invite the next time we make this.  Our only disappointment is that we could only award this recipe 5 stars.

First let me say that I have never liked dried tarragon.  I have tried it many times in recipes, enough to know I did NOT like it.  I decided to try this dish, for something new on a Friday night during Lent.  I am so glad I did.  I used the fresh tarragon, and was pleasantly surprised.  I followed the recipe to the "T".  The only thing I did differently was I grated the garlic instead of mincing it.  That was probably not a good thing to do.  The overwhelming taste of garlic (hot/burn) upon tasting it was horrible.  I put in about 1/2 tsp of sugar, hoping it would help ( I don't know why, it was all I could think of at the time).  And with sitting before we ate, I would had hoped it would have mellowed out.  It did, but only slightly.  My DH and I liked it.  I will make it again, but cut back on the garlic, or at least not grate it again.  We LOVE garlic, and this was just too much.  Thanks Austin, for giving me a new sauce for my fish!

I made this with sour cream instead of mayonnaise because we're not fans of mayo, and we LOVED it. I also used white pepper instead of black pepper, but am sure either would be delicious. Tarragon is kind of a polarizing spice (not everyone loves it), but my family loved this. I will use this again with salmon, halibut, and possibly even chicken. Thank you!

Baked instead of grilled, just to avoid burning the house down lol and bam! Perfection. This was very simple and delicious! I followed other reviewers advice, did about 15 minutes at 400 and then a few extra with the sauce. Must try this recipe!

This was really delicious!  Made it with Alaskan salmon steaks that my husband brought back from an Alaskan fishing trip.  For two steaks I used half the amount of sauce that was recalculated for two steaks (a fourth of the original recipe) and there was plenty of sauce for the two of us.  I omitted the lemon zest (since I used bottled lemon juice rather than a fresh lemon) and it didn't seem to be missing anything.  I also used about 1/3 less fresh tarragon and it seemed to be just the right amount.  I will definitely make it again!

Delicate and delicious. Cut the olive oil to 1/2 T. for both the fish and the sauce. I didn't have tarragon so I used dill instead and it was excellent. I baked the salmon with the oil and spices at 375 degrees for around twenty minutes, then poured half the sauce over it and baked for an additional ten minutes. I served it with the leftover sauce. Wow - what a treat.

This was my first time cooking salmon and I was pleasantly surprised.  Based on prior reviews, I baked the salmon in tin foil with olive oil, salt and pepper at 400.  It took close to 25 minutes. (probably because it was my first time and i kept opening and closing the oven, so don't do that).  I glazed the tops of the salmon with the sauce 5 minutes prior to it being done.  I'm a sauce queen who needs massive flavor, and boy, did this have flavor!  Since I only used 2 fillets, I could have cut the sauce in half and left out a clove or two of garlic.  I used 2 tbls of minced chives as well, which was also too overpowering. (1 tbls would suffice)  In all, the salmon was moist and delicious.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe for my first experience with cooked salmon!

Perfect addition to your salmon recipes.  We also used it as a sauce over our side of broccoli.  We will definitely make this again soon!

We loved this!  I used 1 tsp dried tarragon and 1 tsp dried dill (didn't have any fresh herbs on hand) and it was great.  Will reduce the amount of garlic next time, a little too strong for my 4 yr old.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Tangy and delicious.  A wonderful addition to a list of Salmon recipees that often taste similarly.

I baked the salmon instead of grilling, so delicious.  My entire family yummed it up.  I will without a doubt, make this again

I made this tonight and my husband declared it a restaurant quality dish. Says I can "make it anytime". I put the salmon in some heavy duty foil with olive oil, salt & pepper and grilled it.Thank you for this easy and delicious dish.

Yum!  Loved the sauce and I don't really like mustard or mayo (DH picked out recipe) but it went great with the fish.  One tiny change, used lime instead of lemon and thyme instead of tarragon, since didn't have the others in the house.  Think I want to try the sauce again with a bit of dill.  Also think the sauce would go great with crabcakes.  Getting hungry again. . .

We tried this last night for dinner and the sauce is great! I had to use dill because i forgot the tarragon and that worked out fine. We grilled ahi tuna and topped it with this yummy sauce. Oh i also added a tablespoon of capers to it because i think capers go great on fish.

This dish was really delicious...I also baked it since I don't really grill.  400• for 13 mins without the sauce then 3 additional minutes with sauce came out great!

I didn't think I had enough gas to grill this. So I baked it at 400 for 14 minutes and was very good. The sauce pairs up with very nicely. Served with spicey garlic green beans and rice. Will make again.

This was fantastic. Restaurant quality meal served with a salad and garlic mashed potatoes. I added a little hot sauce to the sauce and sauteed the salmon in garlic olive oil. A real keeper!

Love fish of all kinds I’m from the maritimes . I tried this recipe today. I looked over some reviews and did change one thing . I used honey Dijon as that’s all I had in the fridge ..wow the honey did well with the lemon juice. By the time I went to take a picture the salmon is gone. :) I took advice from one review and did cut it in portion size placed in parchment paper at 375 and placed the sauce about 7 minutes before done. Husband said it’s awesome! We will be making this again thanks Allrecipes you never fail me. :)

Such an easy recipe.   I’m always looking for new ways to make salmon.    The anise flavor from Tarragon paired with lemon, Dijon mustard and garlic is perfection.

Very good on the grill and would make again in oven if necessary. Can't clear up the tarragon debate bkz I was out so I substituted dillweed. You can really taste the lemon. Only needed half the amount of sauce than was listed, you don't want to drown your salmon. Plus this isn't a marinade so a good last minute choice.

We eat salmon 1-2 times a week and so were looking for something different from our favorites. This sauce might make a good salad dressing, but didn't cut it for salmon. Sorry.

If you like to taste raw garlic first - and then the salmon - this is the recipe for you. Personally, I think raw garlic ruins this sauce.  In future I will use powdered garlic.  I do not agree with a previous reviewer that tarragon is the wrong herb.  I think that a modest amount of freshly chopped tarragon in the sauce is lovely with salmon.  I also loved the addition of lemon.  Except for the overpowering garlic, this sauce was perfect.  It should be served room temperature, not cold.  Oh, and by the way, it is not necessary to wrap salmon in foil.  Simply brush with a little olive oil and bake for 10-11 minutes at 400 degrees.  My favourite main dish for guests because it is so beautifully simple....  not to mention nutritious!

I did not have fresh tarragon so I used 1tbsp dried. The sauce had quite a bite to it, either from the lemon juice or the garlic, but it didn't take away from our enjoyment of the dish. We also used it on our steamed broccoli/cauliflower mix and found it quite tasty.

I usually cook salmon to go with red wine because that's my husband's preference.  Today, he opened white wine, and I made this because my tarragon is still alive in November.  I had to cook in a hurry so just trusted the recipe, and it was PERFECT!

This is an excellent sauce;  I have made it with the base leaving out the tarragon and adding dill OR leaving out the lemon zest and adding a dab of creamed horseradish and a tablespoon of sour cream...it is all good!!

This recipe was awesome! My husband and I basically licked our plates clean. My 3 year old even liked it! I baked mine in tin foil on 400° for 15 min and drizzled with olive oil and covered with sliced lemons. Very good. thank you!

I wanted to switch up my regular salmon recipe and wanted to try something with tarragon. This was beyond amazing and super easy to prep! We even dipped our broccoli and potatoes in it :) I had a lot of left over sauce so I think I'll try this over chicken (and my husband wants to put it on his poached eggs in the morning). This has gone in my recipe book and will definitely be made again!

Outstanding, easy to make, but listen, the other reviews are correct let this mixture set in the refrigerator for two or three hours prior to serving. This lets the true delicate flavor of the tarragon to peak.  I added a tea spoon of honey to reduce the tart of the lemon.....very good. BIG BOY

I thought it was great.  Nice way to spice up plain salmon.  My boyfriend thought it was a bit citrus-y

Really nice for a change. I like the sauce. I only used 3 medium garlic cloves and it was enough. Didn't have tarragon so i used dried basil. The next time i make it, i will use less mustard because it was a little strong. The salmon i used was not high quality. the sauce really helped to make it a good meal and remove some of the fishy taste. I can't wait to try the sauce with better quality fish. Much better after the sauce was refrigerated for about 3 hrs. Made it with potatoes and yellow squash. Yum!

I like this a lot.  The mustard was a really nice touch, not something I would have thought to put on salmon.

I thought that the flavor was not worth the extra calories.
