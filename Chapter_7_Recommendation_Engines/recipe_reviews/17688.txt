I only made the frosting (not the cake) I needed something quick and found I was without alot of ingredents) and its really good. I was afraid it might not be enough so I added 1/4 cup more choc chips 1 extra tablespoon coffee and 1/4 extra butter. This is a really tastey frosting. Super easy and I am sure I will make it again.

I had family over for Labor Day weekend 2007 one of them being pregnant so I decided on the Yum Yum cake. It was a big hit with everyone especially the second morning when it had been in the refrigerator all night and the chocolate chips had hardened. My whole family left with a copy of the receipe. Two Thumbs Up!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is rich chocolaty and delicious! Baked in a bundt tube pan took 45mins. Changes I did: I used 1.5 cups of white sugar 3/4 cup of cocoa powder and milk instead of water. Didn't make the frosting. Seriously good- I sprinkled almond flakes on top cut the cake in half and spread vanilla buttercream in the middle. I would maybe use 2 eggs next time for extra leavening since the batter was fairly thick anyway even for a pound cake. The cake was just a little denser than I'd like otherwise very yumyum!

Wow! This is more like a brownie than cake. I could eat this all day. I will not be making this for home as I will surely eat it all. Only for special occasions! I don't like coffee so I left it out. It was amazing with Rich Chocolate Frosting. Not for non-chocoholics!

i am not actually writing this as a review... i am writing to ask a question. what happens if you do not have the unsweetened cocoa or sour cream how does that change the recipe?

Really enjoyed this. Made it with a butter substitute and flax instead of the egg (food allergies...) but it was terrific. Moist inside and a bit of a crust on the outside. Will make often with and without the chocolate chips.

This is very rich and heavy but the chocolate lovers I know really enjoyed it. My coworker asked for a chocolate cake for her birthday and she got it. Very easy too but incredibly heavy. I greased a bundt pan exceedingly well and it was still hard to get out of the pan. I decided not to make the frosting so I can't speak to that. Since I made in a bundt pan it took closer to 1 hour 20 minutes. I baked at 350. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! The frosting is wonderful. We discovered that you really do need to beat it while it's chilling or it just doesn't work. It's worth the effort though. This is definitely one of our go-to recipes now.

Awesome cake! Love the texture and taste. Very moist with a great chewy gooey bite to it! I've so far made dozens of different chocolate cakes and this one is one of my favorites. Very rich not too light in texture. My mom did say it was too moist for her taste so not her favorite. Others in the family thought it was awesome! Thanks for sharing:)
