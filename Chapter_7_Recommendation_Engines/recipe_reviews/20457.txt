This recipe has definite potential.  I added the cheese in the mix instead of putting it on top but it was still a little bland.  Next time, I would double the cheese and use about 8 oz. of egg noodles.  Another thought would be to eliminate the cream of mushroom soup and velveeta and substitute it with a can of nacho cheese soup instead.  Oh!  And my boyfriend calls this "Corned Beef Hasherole"!

I didn't read the recipe all the way through first and added the cheese into the hash mixture, so I ended up using double the cheese as I had to use another 1/4 lb velveeta for the top.  I only used about 8 oz of egg noodles.  Next time I won't add any salt because it was a tiny bit too salty for me.  A great brunch dish.  Thanks Aubrey.

Great flavor!  It's a keeper.  The only thing I didn't like is the velveeta on the top.  I will incorporate cheddar cheese into the dish itself next time I make it.

I'm always wondering what different can be done with corned beef hash and this worked well.  However, I'm glad I read the other reviews first because I only used half the noodles and this was perfect.  Twice as many would just be WAY too much.  I used a combo of American and cheddar cheese, which was decent, but Velveeta would've been better and I didn't have any.  I also did my usual substitution of cream of celery soup since I don't like mushrooms and this usually works well.

We made for dinner and added a little bit of garlic along with about 1/4 cup Parmesean/Romano shredded cheese to mixture.  It was alright, but nothing I'll probably make again.

I used extra onions and sauteed them because I do not like crunchy.  I doubled the cheese and only used half the recommended noodles.  Turned out very good.  Be sure and cut the noodles in half.

Great recipe.  This is one that you can just keep all the ingredients in the cabinet for that emergency meal that wasn't planned. Between the corn beef hash and the processed cheese no additional salt is needed.

Better the second day, but the corned beef flavor doesn't ever really come through.  It may as well be tuna.  The cheese really seemed to overpower everything else.

I do not pre-cook the egg noodles and I put most of the cheese in the mixture, I just fold them into casserole dish. Save some cheese for the top and throw some crumbled potatoe chips on top 5 minutes before you take out of the oven. Yummy!

I loved it, can't say the same for my family though.  My 13 year old barely ate it and my husband liked it and said it seemed better for dinner than breakfast, he also said that it needed more corned beef hash.  I think this was my fault.  I was trying to take the advice of others
regarding this recipe and I was trying to tone done on the egg noodles but the problem was I didn't have enough of one kind of egg noodle so I mixed them together and I think it made too much.  I also didn't have a processed/velveeta type cheese so I used what I had which was a four cheese mexican and monterey jack cheeses.  This recipe is definetly a keeper and with a little more tweeking, my husband might even LOVE it.  I gave it five stars on my personal review only.

I had leftover corned beef brisket I cooked a couple of days before & we were tired of sandwiches, so I was looking for ideas & found this recipe as a basis, but made lots of changes.   My husband doesn't like noodles, so I substituted a 2-lb. bag of chunky hash browns (thawed), chunked the corned beef, used cream of chicken soup, used a 12 oz. bag of shredded cheddar cheese ,)(1/2 in the mixture, the other half on top) in place of Velveeta, also added a can of peas.  Five minutes before removing from oven, crushed some potato chips on top for a little crunch. I had to use a 9x13 inch pan. We loved it!!!  Would probably add some spice for a little more zest next time, however, but it was very good .

Do NOT use processed cheese! Use normal shredded cheddar cheese.  
You can also add a 1/2 cup of frozen peas to add some vegetables to the dish.

This recipe didn't have much corned beef flavor, it really just tasted like tuna casserole. My boyfriend is a big Corned-Beef and hash fan, but wasn't crazy about this dish.

I'm giving this a three because my family was torn in our ratings.  Hubby & our 10-yr old son liked it quite a bit.  Our 6-yr old daughter & I didn't care for it.  And I love fried corned beef hash.  So, this one is a toss-up for us.

My family loves this recipe. It is  a breeze to throw together and is very tasty. The only thing I changed was instead of using an entire small onion, I only use half an onion. Thanks for a keeper.

Good recipe!  Not SUPER, but good!  Try adding double the cheese and using a larger casserole dish.

I made this and will make it again!   I did read other reviews and doubled the corned beef hash, halved the noodles and added a  tiny bit more milk.  I also mixed the cheese through out and put a potato chip topping on it.    Okay I've become "one of those"  that I loathe who changes up the recipe but at least I didn't criticize it  and give it one star in the process!     Great base recipe and a classic as far as "even better the next day" !!!!     Maybe a little bland for those of us who like spicy foods but I'm not sure what i could add aside from lots of black pepper to enhance spiciness.   Perhaps some red pepper flakes?   It definitely does not need salt.     A keeper!     Thanks for sharing this!

it's good. I didn't use American cheese because I loathe it. But if I were to take again I would use Cheddar. I only had parmesan and its ok. and I only used 6oz dried noodles. Would be good for a brunch dish.

The family loved it. What an easy and inexpensive dish. I did add about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the main casserole, and then the Velveeta cheese on top. We do love our cheese.
