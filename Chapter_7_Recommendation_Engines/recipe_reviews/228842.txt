Really good. Add more turkey/chicken stock and reduce the curry. It overwhelmed the other flavors. Will make again with leftover chicken too!

Super simple, very mild, but I added some almond milk to make it creamy and make more sauce (and avoid dairy), so I'm sure that threw off the flavor a bit.

Make this just as it is written and was very good.  Served it on wild rice, everyone enjoyed it and even asked for the recipe.  There is not very much sauce I will add more stock next time I make it. If there was  more sauce I would have given it 5 stars.
