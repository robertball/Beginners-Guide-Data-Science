I've never been much of a cake-baker. My cakes have always ended up resembling something of the Leaning Tower of Piza or a crater in the moon - just ridiculously deformed and extremely creative "works of art" that all the icing and frosting in the world could never make level. I hate to sound like an infomercial, but until I found this recipe, I thought I was doomed to cookie baking for the rest of my life. This recipe was extremely easy, and after reading the reviews, I made a note to use only 3/4 c. of sugar, since I was using a package of already sweetened coconut. And to avoid any of the grittiness that some of my fellow bakers experienced, I made sure to use extra fine granulated sugar (try C&H's Baker's Sugar)- it should melt right in. To ensure that the icing wouldn't be runny, I made sure not to overblend the filling and whipped cream, and refrigerated the mixture for about half an hour while the cake was cooling. After everything was assembled, the result was something actually visually stimulating, and although I did an awesomely bad job at splitting the layers, the filling does a wonderful job at concealing this fact, since the color of the filling blends in with the cake. For once, I ended up with a masterpiece that raked in so many compliments it inflated my ego. Thanks, Kathy!

Everything that I read about this cake is true - its delicious!  The whole family loved it and said that it was one of the best things I'd ever made!  The only thing that I changed was to use low-fat whipped topping, and I followed the low-fat recipe for the white cake mix.  If this is what my low-fat version tastes like...

This cake was so delicious.  A definite must for coconut lovers.  The frosting was the absolute best.  It was really simple to make, but looked like it took hours.  I especially liked that I was able to make it so far ahead of time.  I made it on a Monday night and we had it for Thanksgiving on Thursday.

Try using fresh coconut.  Use a corkscrew through the eye (soft spot) on the coconut and empty the coconut milk into a measuring cup.  Use this milk as part of the liquid in the cake.  To open the coconut hit it with a hammer to crack it.  Clean and wash fresh coconut and grate.  You can use a food processor to grate the coconut quickly.  Use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the coconut in the cake batter.  I used lemon curd (lemon pie filling) between the cake layers.  I only used two layers.  This can be purchased canned, with the pie fillings or you can make your own.  For the frosting I only used half a 8 oz. container of whipped topping, 1/2 cup sour cream and sugar to taste -- about 1/2 cup.  I added about 1 cup of the shredded coconut to the frosting mixture.  Toast some coconut to put on top of cake.  Freeze leftover coconut in small zip-lock  bag for a future project.  This is an easy recipe compared to my usual coconut cake and it got rave reviews.  Thanks Kathy.

This is the best coconut cake I have ever tasted!  I made it for Thanksgiving last year and my family has requested several since then.  As the recipe says, it is much better if refrigerated for at least three days. The longer it sits the better it is!!

This is one of my very favorite recipes ever - though I like to make it with a butter recipe cake mix. The recipe should state that frozen (or better: fresh!) coconut should be used... I think someone in the reviews used canned (sweetened) coconut - which would be far too sweet.

This recipe is absolutely the easiest and very best coconut cake I have ever prepared, served and eaten!  I recommend this recipe just as it is printed, although the second time I made it I used low-fat sour cream and low-fat Cool Whip and it tasted just as delicious.  Kathy is right...it just gets better and better the longer it is refrigerated.  I will never use another coconut cake recipe than this one.  Thanks Kathy!

I made the white cake using the "egg white" formula on the box. Made in sheet cake pan then split that once. This left enough icing to put inside with the filling. Couldn't find x-fine sugar as someone suggested, so I ran my regular sugar through the mini chopper. I think the longer the cake sits the more the sugar dissolves and becomes less grainy. I did let the mixture sit in fridge before assembly as someone suggested. It was very good and I would make it again. Easter guests loved it.

This cake is a crowd pleaser every time!  I add some coconut to the batter as well.  I do not seperate the frosting, I mix all the frosting ing. together.  It is easier when making cupcakes to do this and I find the frosting ends up fluffier.  This is a standby for our family.  At Christmas I make it in the shpe of a tree and we decorate with candy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved it. I made a mistake & reversed the sugar & sour cream amounts. Ended up using 2 c. sour cream, 1 c. sugar & the coconut. It was absolutely a delicious mistake! When I make my cake mixes I use milk instead of water & 1/2 oil & apple sauce for the oil. You can't taste the apple flavor but it makes for a very moist cake. No matter what flavor including chocolate. I buy snack cups of unsweetned apple sauce and put oil in the bottom of the correct size measure cup. example: fill 1/2 with oil & a few tablespoons of apple sauce until it reaches the top of  the measure cup. The cake is best mellowing over night. Actually any cake is better done the day before. It mellows & infuses the cake with more flavor. I made the filling the night before I made cake mix, just to save time. But, I noticed that the coconut absorbed the liquid from the sour cream & was really delicious & fluffy. I will do this again next time.I also think the sugar can be cut to 3/4 cup. I love sweet & this is plenty sweet. My friends devoured the cake in no time. My coffee gang loved it. Did you know you can toast coconut in a T-Fal type pan with no oil. The coconut has plenty of oil in it. Just use a medium heat & stir constantly & the coconut will toast.

I've made this cake for years.  My Grandma would make several and freeze then give away during xmas.  I do cut the sugar by a 1/2 cup, and I also chill the sugar,sour cream, coconut mixture all day in fridge to keep cake from sliding.  Once I build the cake I then chill again for 24 hours.  This cake gets better as it sits.  I never eat coconut cake any other way.  My husband 'hates' coconut, but he loves this cake!

I made a half-batch of frosting, as I didn't split the layers of my cake.  It was plenty for two layers, but it wouldn't stay on the cake even though I kept it in the fridge...  The frosting puddled down the sides and pooled around the base of the cake, making for very poor presentation.  I followed the directions, so I'm not sure what happened...

The coconut cake is crutial to our thankgiving dinner and i must say this was a huge hit!  i did use several of the alterations suggested.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup and made it superfine using my chopper.  I also didn't think there was enough filling so I 1 1/2 it.  fantastic recipe!  thank you

I've seen this one before & was always intrigued.  This year, I pulled the trigger and I'm so glad that I did!  Excellent recipe.  
The frosting alone is 5 stars.
Just to share a hack on the cake mix - sub out the water for milk, add an extra egg and sub melted butter 2:1 for the oil (instead of 1/2 oil use 1 cup melted butter).  It will give you a more "home made taste" if you don't want to bake a scratch cake.

This was an okay cake.  I'm not a huge coconut fan, but it was tasty enough.  Just wouldn't bother making it again.  Coconut lovers might like it much better.  I'd give it a 3.75, but that's not an option.  It wasn't hard to make and looked nice.

I made this cake with a coconut flavored cake mix. I only used slightly over one cup of sugar in the sour cream, and used less than half of the flaked coconut. The sugar gelled up well overnight-no graininess at all! The filling seemed really runny, but once poured over the cut layers, it soaked into the cake really well. The best part of this cake is the cool whip/sugar/sour cream frosting! It compares to getting the whipped frostings at bakeries! I could eat it with a spoon! I think the fact that I used a coconut cake mix, in addition to the coconut flakes made it a bit of overkill. Next time I will stick to the recipe and use white cake. This cake was definitely a hit with my guests, and super moist! I will definitely be making again...And will be making the frosting (minus the coconut) to use on a red velvet cake. This finding a permanent place in my recipe box!

My husband loved this.  I cut out a half cup of sugar because one of the other reviews
said it was too sweet.  I think this worked fine, because I had to smile when my husband
said it was great and not too sweet.

Since I am a cook, not much of a baker, because I don't like to follow measurements, I tried to make this cake for my 30th anniversary. Learned you should always read the reviews for extra tips before you start. I cut the sugar down by 3/4 of a cup, because I used sweetened coconut. Should use unsweetened coconut. Also, because I only had half the amount of coconut on hand that I needed, I just went with it. It was fine! If I make it again, I will use half the amount of coconut that it called for. Also, threw some coconut into the cake batter. I also didn't wait three days to cut into it. Could only wait 24 hours before the cake drove me crazy, wanting to try it. It is absolutely delicious! Will make it again, and again, and again!!! By the way, found this on a free app I got on my IPhone. The Spinner meal planner is genius.

I have made this cake for many years and everyone loves it. The only difference is that my recipe calls for coconut from the freezer section. The coconut taste like fresh coconut with no sugar added. Sometimes I use chocolate cake mix which is wonderful. It may be hard to wait 3 days, but the wait is worth it.

This was probably the best looking cake I have ever made. It turned out perfect. I was sooo suprised. The only change I made was I cut back on some of the sugar after reading some of the reviews. I did make this cake about 4 days early, and everyone LOVED it. I couldn't believe how good it tasted. It was very easy to put together. Thanks for the recipe.

With 3 small boys and a husband at home, I hardly take the time to submit reviews on anything, but this review needed to be entered.  THIS CAKE IS EASY AND TASTE AWESOME!!!!!!!  I made it for Easter dinner and it disappeared before we left the house for Aunt B's, so I had to make another.  The kids blamed it on the Easter Bunny?   I was just 
happy they enjoyed it so much.  TRY IT, IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!

This was a good cake, but very sweet.  I think I will half the filling next time and only cut into 2 layer, I did 3 and the cake was too thin.  I also did not toast the coconut on the outside.  We liked this cake.

My first attempt at a coconut cake & it was a huge hit for Easter.  I told my husband that I needed to make it three days in advance and he named it Jesus cake because Jesus was resurrected on the third day and we were having it on Easter Sunday.  I thought that was quite clever.  I followed others' advice on cutting back on the sugar to 3/4 cup and I used the sweetened flaked coconut because that was all I had.  We ended up with only a three layer cake because I discarded the top of one of the cakes to make it stack nicely.  I will definitely make this again.

Totally awesome!! I made this the day before Christmas, and my husband couldn't wait. I woke up the next morning, and a there were cuts in the cake. He absolutely loved it. He's a coconut lover, so I put more coconut in the frosting for him. It is a good idea however to not put as much sugar for the icing. It was wonderful to the taste buds! Thanks.

I made this cake for Easter to make a bunny cut-out cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that, to the white cake mix, I added an extra egg and a cup of sour cream to enhance the flavor and texture of the cake for shaping into a bunny. It also helped it to taste less cake mix-y.  This worked well, and the whipped topping frosting made it so easy to frost and decorate my bunny!  The kids helped and had a ball, and everyone agreed that was cute AND tasted great!

I make this cake every year for Christmas and Easter and everyone loves it. My recipe calls for 2 six oz. packages of frozen coconut and I think that tastes much better than the packaged coconut.

I have made this cake twice since Easter. Both times it got rave reviews. It is good but very sweet and rich. The second time I made it I added raspberry jam to the filling. It tasted heavenly but turned the filling a strange gray-lavender color. I c Coconut lovers will not be disappointed. I will make this cake again and again. It is a great "special occasion" cake.  Easy, too!

Oh my, this was heavenly!  I think I'll reduce the sugar next time because it was quite rich, but really delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe...bonus because it can be made ahead.

My sister-in-law gave me the recipe for this cake a few years ago and it is amazing!  Don't let the short ingredient list fool you and definitely leave it in the frig for the full 3 days.  Everytime I make it people ask me for the recipe.

Yummy! I used lemon cake instead of white. I also used only about a cup of sugar for the filling. It sat in the fridge for three days until the party. My family loved it! The coconut filling was definitely my favorite part!

This cake is delish and everyone loved it but it is way too sweet.  I even reduced the amount of sugar to one cup and it was still too sweet.  DON'T put in the full two cups of sugar!  Next time I make this I will use half cup.

I was looking for a great coconut cake recipe and I have found it!  This cake just gets better and better each day it sits in the refrigerator. It was moist, yet light and not too sweet.  I personally loved the toasted coconut added on top.  Looks and tastes fantastic! A must try recipe...

This is a great cake & it most definitely is best if you leave it refrigerated for the three days recommended. We used to have it every year at Christmas but it's been a while since I made it. I always use a yellow cake mix & I also add crushed pineapple in heavy syrup, drained but with a little bit of the syrup left, to the mixture that goes between the layers (not too much syrup or it is too soupy). Over the three days, We called it sour-cream coconut dream cake. Yum!

I made this cake for my MIL birthday and everyone loved it.  I added cream of coconut to the cake and to the filling.  It was too sweet for a few people but otherwise everyone raved about it.  I will make this again!

This recipe was great. I added cream of coconut to the cake(suggestion from another recipe) which was a great touch. This cake should definitely be eaten at room temperature. When you 1st take it out the refrigerator, the icing and filling are very stiff. After letting it sit out, the icing and filling became creamy and the cake was extremely  moist. TWO THUMBS UP!!!

This is the best coconut cake recipe!! Super easy and super yummy! It really is true--the longer it sits the better, but it's hard to wait! I actually cut in to it after only one day of refrigeration, and it was great!  But as the week went on, it just tasted better and better!!

This is sooooooooo good. It does need at least 72 hours, and even at that the filling is a tad "grainy"...Once it's cut though, it's gone so I don't know about it lasting any longer!!

I made this for a co-worker's birthday today and everyone is raving!   Per other reviewer's comments I used only 1 cup of sugar and I used lite Sour Cream and Lite Cool Whip--and no one can tell the difference.  Really a treat.  Will definitely make this again.

I am not crazy about coconut but this recipe is out of this world.  I even use different flavor cake mixes and it adds just an extra punch to it.  Lemon cake mix is my favorite.

This was really yummy and very easy to prepare.  (VERY sweet, too.)  Assembly did take a few minutes but wasn't difficult -- don't be intimidated!  I didn't make it in advance as recommended... will try that next time to compare.  If you really like coconut, you'll enjoy this cake!

It was really hard to wait 4 days to eat this cake.  But it was well worth it, the cake was incredible.  I am going to make it again using red food coloring for a baby shower I am hosting this weekend.

This is a wonderful cake!  It is very moist, and I only let it sit for two days before serving.  I did not add the coconut on top and it had plenty without that.  I did add the zest of one lime to the filling to cut the sweetness just a bit.  Everyone loved it and I can not wait for any excuse to make it again!  Everything about this cake is delightful!  Thank you Kathy!!!  P.S. I am thinking about adding some crushed pineapple to the filling next time!

made this cake for Easter....DELICIOUS!!! Everyone really liked it...made a few changes to recipe after reading other reviews.  Only used half the sugar and used powdered sugar instead of the granulated.  Also made the filling the night before making the cake and let is sit in fridge to firm up before icing the layers.  Will be definately making this again.I also used the coconut milk instead of the water in the cake mix and I was able to find the frozen coconut.  It is not near as sweet as say Bakers but I did use the Bakers on top.  My sister said this is now the cake she will be asking for.

I followed this recipe verbatim. I thought this cake was beautiful. It tasted good too but, I was very disappointed that it completely fell apart when sliced (even using a spatula for support). It was dry! With all the rave reviews and 3 days of anticipation, I was very disappointed! Will not make again.

Normally, I make everything from scratch and never use cake mixes, but this recipe can't be beat for fast, easy, and delicious! One change I recommend, though, is to use confectioners powdered sugar (10X) instead of regular granulated sugar, and to reduce it to 1 1/2 cups. It was still pretty sweet, but I wanted to be sure to have enough filling, so I counteracted that by adding  a few extra tablespoons of sour cream. Fabulous!

I don't know if my version is "better", but I tried to make it a little lower in calories since my Mom is diabetic. I used a Pillsbury Moist Supreme Reduced Sugar cake mix and used Crisco canola oil with Omega 3 DHA oil and egg beaters. Per someone else's suggestion instead of water I used Lite Coconut Milk and then baked as directed. For the frosting I used 2 cups fat free sour cream, 1 cup Splenda sugar blend and a container of Lite Cool Whip with the coconut. Haven't tasted the whole thing together yet, but the cake smells divine and the frosting is awesome, but not TOO sweet.

This is a great recipe - my only adjustment would be to use confectioner's sugar. The original recipe callas for white/granulated sugar, which give the frosting a gritty texture. Not bad, but the confectioner's sugar may eliminate it. Otherwise, an awesome cake!

I made this for an auction at church. It sold for a great deal of money, and the family that bought it let me know how very pleased they were with the cake. Their eight year old girl, a VERY pickey eater, loved it and kept asking for more. They bragged so on the cake that I was forced to make one for myself.  I was NOT disappointed!

This turned out excellent.  My husband who doesn't like coconut cake couldn't get enough.  I added some of the coconut to the cake batter and it added really great taste and texture to the whole thing.

Excellent !!!!
Even I usually  do not like the coconut related food, I love this cake.But it is really too sweet. ( I used sweetend coconut flakes, and only 1 cup of sugar.) My HB does not like too sweet. Next time, I will reduce the sugar.

This recipe is the best coconut cake I've tasted and one of the easiest.  It's great as a company dessert because you make it a couple days in advance.  Everyone loves it...I gave it a slightly lower ranking in the kids area because kids generally do not like coconut.

This is a fabulous cake . I have made it for years . There is no such thing as 18.25 oz cake mixes . I use 2 mixes to be able for it to be sliced in two so you have 4 layers using 9” cake pans. All the cake mixes I find at my store are 15.25 oz.

I am 73 years old and this is THE best coconut cake I've ever had...and so easy!  After reading most of the reviews, I made it exactly as written (except I didn't toast the coconut topping).  I had about 1/2 cup of coconut left, so I must have reserved a little too much for the top.  The thread idea for cutting the layers didn't work for me (I even tried dental floss), but the thin boning knife from my knife set worked great.  I used my 8" cake pans so the layers would be thicker.  I used a Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix as my base.  Yes, I used 2 cups regular sugar in the sour cream mixture, and it was perfect.  After 3 days in the fridge, there's no graininess...it all melds into one flavorful cake.  I also used sweetened coconut and it was perfect.   My husband had requested a coconut cake for his 75th birthday celebration.  I was a little nervous, making something for the first time for guests, but I needn't have worried.  Since I thought some of the 23 people attending wouldn't care for coconut, our grandson made a couple dozen strawberry cupcakes for us.  However, only 6 people (mostly kids) took cupcakes, and one came back for coconut cake after he heard others raving...and the coconut cake was gone!   Several said they normally didn't care for coconut cake, but this one was amazing.   It was so moist, creamy, flavorful...almost like pound cake, but lighter.  And they couldn't believe the icing was mostly Cool Whip!  Genius.   I didn't personally think the cake w

I toasted all the coconut I put on the outside.  That was the only way to go.  The cake was amazing and everyone in the office loved it.  People were disappointed when we went to get some the next day to have with morning coffee and it had disappeared already.  We guessed folks went back for seconds the day before.  Tee-hee.  The only hard part about this cake is having the patience to wait for it to marry-up for three days.  Oh the agony of the wait when the delciousness in the fridgeis calling your name.??

This cake is da BOMB. I made only one change, and that was I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, instead of the 2 cups that the recipe calls for. Perfect! Because I am such a huge fan of coconut, I knew the hardest part of this easy recipe, was waiting for 3 days to cut into it. One of my girl friends came up with the perfect solution. She invited me to stay at her house until it was time for me to cut the cake. Of course there was a catch. At the end of the third day, we would go back to my house, and I would have to let her eat as much of this cake as she wanted. She loved it, and there was only half of the cake remaining after just one sitting. So much for bringing it to the office. Guess I will have to make another one.

Everybody really loved this cake.  I made 2 this week it was that good.  I had whipping cream so I used real whipped cream(with a little instagel) instead of the pre-made kind.  I also used coconut milk, and extra vanilla in my cake as part of the wet ingredients, and couple tablespoons in the frosting as well.  I like the frosting because it was light and delicious, not sickenly sweet like most.  The cake is a lot better the next day after sitting in the fridge all night believe it or not!  Also, if you put the sugar in your sour cream first before you start everything the sugar will dissolve most of the way when it comes frosting time, because it is quite grainy at first.

The cake was very tasty! It is a bit on the too sweet side and I cut back the sugar by a quarter of a cup as suggested by other reviewers.  Next time I make it I think I will combine the sour cream mixture with the Cool Whip at the start because I feel like the sour cream mixture just kind of disappeared into the cake and you hardly knew there were several distinct layers. I really liked the frosting on the outside and I think that would be good between the layers as well. I think you would probably have to increase the amount of Cool Whip to do this.

This cake is amazing!  I only changed a couple things, 1 based on other reviews, and one out of necessity.  After reading reviews, I added a little less than 2 cups of sugar.  About 1 3/4 cups.  I made the sour cream/sugar/coconut mixture while the cake was baking and put it in the fridge.  I also used unsweetened dry packaged coconut, which is perfect.  I did try the cake after about 4 hours in the fridge, and did notice the grittiness of the sugar as others had mentioned.  After trying it today (3 days refrigerated), the grittiness is gone.  I also did not have round cake pans so I baked in a 13x9 glass dish, and cut in half.  I didn't do the layers, as I was afraid of the whole thing crumbling without baked sides.  So I had more of the inside mixture to add to the whipped cream frosting, which made it even tastier!!  Even my husband, who does NOT like cake, loved it!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

FAIL. I dont know what I did but it stuck to the bottom and was a huge sticky mess. It was really good though as cake peices but I wish it had stuck together. I put  tons of spray on and I believe the sticky part was the coconut cream. I will try again sometime and hopefully it turns out better.

Made this cake for Easter Sunday and it was HUGE hit!  My 93 year old dad and 90 year old mom said it was the BEST CAKE they ever ate -- The only thing I changed was I used half the amount of sugar called for and used superfine sugar as someone else said.  Next time I might double the amount of sour cream mixture so I have more to add to the frosting.

I made this cake for my boyfriend, who absolutely loves coconut cake, and it turned out AMAZING! I made one small change...I added a couple tablespoons of sour cream and about a half cup of cream of coconut to the cake batter. Yum!

Best ever! This is the best coconut cakes my family has ever tasted! Usually my husband does not like coconut cakes because they are too sweet, but this one is perfect! I did put the sugar in my vitamix to refine it (as some have suggested), and it really does taste better frozen 3 days later! Thanks

I made this cake for my friend's birthday-she loves coconut!, and it was a huge hit!! Everyone loved it! I did follow the reviews, and halved the sugar, and put the sour cream/sugar/coconut mixture in the fridge for an hour to stiffen it a bit so it wouldn't run. I also did not over mix the whipped topping/sour cream mixture. I could not wait the 3 days-I saw this recipe the day before her birthday!, so it sat in fridge for 24 hours only, but it was so tasty! I'll be anxious to see how it is when you wait the full three days! This recipe is easy and delicious, thank you for sharing!!

Delicious! I did substitute confectionary sugar for granulated and tinted the frosting pink. The white coconut sprinkled over the pink made for a beautiful birthday cake for my stepdaughter. She loved the whole cake but especially the frosting! My husband and son in law kept telling me how good it was and what a good job I did. This was a real compliment because I make cakes all the time and most times get one comment on how good the cake was, not all the fuss I got for this one!

I've made this several times and everyone loves it.  It is easy and absolutely delicious.  I also love that you can make it in advance.  It's not an easy cake to take though on a long trip.  I took it from Indiana to Illinois on Mother's Day and I was shocked it was still together from Friday to Sunday.  Four creamy layers that could slide but it made it.  Wouldn't want to try it again though.

I made a few changes, I used 1 1/3 cup of whipping cream, and added about a tsp of coconut & rum extract to the whipping cream, little more flavorful the 2nd time around with the variations.  I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 & 1/2 cups of the white sugar, just because I like brown sugar, tasted marvelous ;) !!

Great recipe, I let it stand in the fridge for 2 hours, it was better than on the next day, I also added 2 cups of sour cream instead of 1 cup, also it defenetely came out way too sweet(and I love sweets), so next time I'll decrise sugar by half.

I'm not sure what happened.  I followed the recipe just as it was written and I had the same thing happen as someone else.  The filling was gritty and when i mixed the cool whip in for the icing it turned totally runny and goey.  i have never failed this badly at a recipe before.

I baked this cake for Mother's Day, it is very good.  I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of Splenda and I used Low Fat Sour Cream and Low Fat Cool Whip.  Although there was a little more sour cream taste than I wanted.  I also only made two layers, and I put filling between them and on top.

This cake is GREAT! It has the best frosting ever, according to my mom, and I agree. I took it to a gathering and one person said it was a "slice of heaven". Absolutely delicious, and very pretty too.
Note: If you use sweetened coconut, as I did, decrease the sugar to 3/4 C.

This recipe was so easy and produced a delicious, moist cake that my family absolutely loved!  I could only find sweetened coconut, so I followed the advice of others and reduced the sugar to one cup and it turned out perfectly.  I don't even like coconut usually, but I love this cake!  Thank you for a great recipe.

excellent recipe.  2 suggestions though...if you add coconut to the batter, consider using large bread pans for the baking so you have a rectangular pan.  the addition of coconut makes the cake hard to cut without crumbling apart.

also, if you use sweetened coconut, reduce the amount of sugar to 1 cup total.

You have to really LOVE coconut to like this cake because it's filled with a LOT of coconut.  I may have liked it better with less coconut between the layers and more toasted coconut on the top and sides of the frosted cake.  Be sure to slice the cake into small servings unless you are really hungry for coconut.
