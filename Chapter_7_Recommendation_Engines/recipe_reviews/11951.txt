My husband and I are both Italian, so everything I make has to be authentic! This recipe is wonderful. I followed the ingredients as written, (except for using olive oil, of course!!)
I know the amount of oil and butter may scare some, but it does make the dish. There are other recipes using only clam juice and wine as the base, but I find them not as decadent with lack of substance (much lower in fat and calories though:). I did sautee the garlic first(tons of garlic!), added crushed red pepper, and thickened it with some fresh parmesan at the end. I know some reviewers used cornstarch and flour, and that may have been good, but I was scared to do it!
Anyway, thanks for the recipe!

I used OLIVE oil (1/4 cup), 2 tbs. butter, and 4 garlic cloves.  I gave it 3 stars with the vegetable oil-try it with olive oil for a 5 star recipe.

Excellent.  I searched all over the site to find the best linguine with clams recipe, and this one did not disappoint.  I used half the amount of olive oil that is recommended, simply because the amount of total fat scared the pants off of me.  I subbed half of the pasta cooking water for 1/4 cup of oil.  I also used fresh basil, and about four cloves of garlic.  Rave reviews from dinner party guests.  They practically licked their plates.  Enjoy!

Great basic sauce!  I tried it once with no changes and it was very good.  Last night, for the second try, I used Pepperolio (spiced olive oil) with the butter.  I sauteed lots of garlic and a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes in the butter/oil before proceeding.  Instead of thickening the sauce with cornstarch I used some finely grated parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

This is the best linguine with clam sauce I've ever had.  Even better than from a restaurant.  And the sauce is so easy - I started the sauce when I started the water for the pasta and they were both ready at the same time.

Real easy and tasty. When I want to be ''fancy" I use  real little necks and a ''fancier'' recipe (more herbs, wine, etc). But for quick and simple to the table in 15 minutes this is a WINNER of a basic and easy recipe. I only did things a little differently - used olive oil instead of veg. oil and used garlic puree instead of minced garlic - I was out of fresh. And last five minutes added 1/3 cup grated parma cheese to make sauce a little thicker along with a 1/4 pasta water (starchy water  helps thicken instead of corn starch). Then I only added the clams the last two minutes or so of cooking so they would not get too chewy. In the time it took to cook the pasta the sauce was ready!  Recipe ''adaptions'' aside, this is a great recipe and I already printed a copy to keep it handy for next time. Clams are already on my grocery list again for when I make this again! Thanks Miss Dorothy for helping me find a new twist on one of my old favorites.

WOW!! Very rich, even with using light butter. Love the deep flavor, surely better than adding white wine. This is our new favorite dinner and so fast to put together- this deserves 10 stars!!!  Always take advice of Italians and added the extra garlic, red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese. Even added extra parsley :-)

Great basic recipe - I added several of the "suggested" items from reviews - lemon juice, parmesan cheese and white wine - did more basil cause we like that flavor ! I've read how some people get upset that the EXACT recipe isn't followed when reviewed, but I rarely follow a recipe exactly !  What I like is a good start, then I go from there - that's what cooking is all about - "making it your own" !  This is a 5 star starter and w/o any additions, it would still be good !

Yummo! I followed the advice of those before me and altered the recipe: I used 5 minced garlic cloves,  about 1.5 tbl basil, 2 tbl of butter,  1/3 c. olive oil, juice of 3 cans of clams--but the meat of 3 cans & topped each portion with shredded parmesan. My husband & I loved it -Even my 3 year son ate it (minus the clams)!  We took the leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I radically changed the prescribed recipe.

My family loved this.  My daughter asked if we could have it again the next night.  It is extremely easy and fast.  I did thicken the sauce with a little corn starch and I sprinkled it with grated parmesan right before serving.

Like many others, I'd like to suggest just a few tweaks that make this a 5 star recipe. Use olive oil (I used extra virgin) rather than vegetable oil. I added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes but saut√©ed them in oil first to tame their spiciness. I also added 3/4 Tbsp corn starch (sifted) to thicken the sauce. Oh, and I always prefer fresh over dried basil and parsley so I used those to taste. I topped the whole thing with a little parmesan cheese and fresh squeezed lemon. All these tweaks added layers and depth to the recipe that worked VERY well. If fresh clams are available, get enough to serve a couple per serving and add that much more fun to this dish!

This recipe is very simple, basic and absolutely delicious. Linguine with clams is one of my husband's very favorite dishes and he loved this. It's very easy to add ingredients to your preference. I halved the recipe but kept all proportions exactly as called for except the garlic which I doubled. I first melted the butter in the olive oil over medium high heat. I then I added 1 tbsp Red Pepper Flakes and saut√©ed along with the garlic for about a minute. I added 1/4 cup dry white wine and cooked for about another minute. Then I added the rest of the sauce ingredients. An easy way to thicken your sauce is to take about 1/2 cup of the pasta water just before you drain it and stir it into the sauce. The starch in the pasta water will act as a natural thickening agent.

Wonderful flavor!  I did cut the butter and oil to 2 tbsp. each, 3 cloves of garlic, added some red pepper flakes and a bit of cornstarch mixed with water at the end.  Also served topped with a bit of parmesan.

I think I could eat this every night of the week.  It was wonderful.

These are good ingredients, but I do have some additions.  I use about a half of a small yellow onion, 1/4 cup white wine and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also use fresh parsley.

Saute the onion, garlic, and 1/2 of the parsley in the olive oil and then add the wine.  Simmer the sauce with the clams and juice while the pasta cooks.

When the pasta is ready I make a roux with flour and butter, and add it to the sauce to thicken.  Then I combine all the ingredients.  It's amazing!

Just made this dish for dinner tonight, had everything on hand in the house. What an amazing, easy last minute kind of meal!  I used whole wheat spaghetti, and for 1 lb of pasta, next time I would definitely increase the amount of garlic, as well as increase to 3 cans chopped clams.  I also used fresh parsley and basil, which is what I have growing in my garden.  A definite repeat keeper!!

Excellent and easy, even my kids liked it.
I try and use as many fresh ingrediants as possible to offset the canned.  
I start by melting the butter, then adding the fresh garlic and I use olive oil.  Then I add a little lemon zest and fresh squeezed lemon along with the juice from the clams.  I omit the basil, but add fresh parsley and a little pepper.  When noodles are al dente, add the Whole Baby Clams (not minced) and then add drained noodles.  Toss together over heat and top with lots of fresh parmesan.   Yummy!

This was delicious. Here are the changes I made: I used fresh parsley, and doubled it. I completely forgot to add the basil at all, but I will add it next time. Same with the pepper (the family walked in the door and I got distracted). It is a little heavy on the OLIVE oil but I made garlic bread as a side and it worked to soak up some of the extra oil.

I made this today, and my whole family devoured it! Which was quite a surprise, because the normally are not seafood eaters, outside of fried fish and shrimp most of the time! It was a simple and very easy recipe to put together, but tastes like you spent forever on it. Only thing different I did was up the amount of garlic, but our family loves galric. Served with a side salad and grilled Texas Toast.

This recipe has promise, just not prepared like this.  Use olive oil, not vegetable oil.  Heat the oil in a sauce pan over medium high heat.  Add the garlic (twice the recipe) and saute for 1 minute. Add the white wine and reduce by half.  Add the butter, parsley and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  After 2 minutes add a can of whole baby clams.  Saute for 1 minute and add to the cooked linguine.  MUCH better this method.

Very good. Needs more garlic.  Did four cloves, needs about 7 minced.  Used Olive oil and chopped a half an onion really fine. Didn't boil when added clams at the end. As suggested. Fresh parsley, chopped in chopper.  Basil flakes.   Hubby liked it. Tasted the butter. Said more garlic please. Just as good as the restaurant.  Son says more garlic.  So more garlic! If that helps ya! Enjoy it!

This was the BEST white clam sauce I have ever made!  The only change I made was that I used a jar of minced garlic with juice and increased it to a full teaspoon and added about 3 tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the sauce at the very end to thicken the sauce a little.  The sauce was AMAZING!

Excellent! I omitted veggie oil and used olive oil but only have of what it calls for. I used 1/2 the butter also. I added lemon juice, crushed red pepper flakes, and white wine. I also cooked it on medium for 10 minutes after boiling stirring frequently. PERFECT and light.

For one pound of pasta, I found that only 2 cans of clams wasn't enough.  Instead, I used 4 cans of chopped (not minced) clams and the clam juice, 2/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 4 cloves of chopped fresh garlic. I added one tsp of all purpose flour mixed with 1/4 c cold milk, then added it to the sauce at the end, cooking until bubbly, for thickness and mixed into the well-drained and slightly dry pasta.  The drier the pasta, the more it will absorb the clam sauce.  Delish!!

I'm never buying it at a restaurant again knowing how easy it was to make at home. Very customizable -- add whatever spices you prefer! I used a flavor rosemary and herbs olive oil. Fantastic!

This really was a delicious and simple recipe.  I did follow some suggestions and used slightly less olive oil and substituted in some of the pasta cooking water to thicken it.  I also added red pepper flakes.  The flavor was just wonderful.  The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I really did think it was kind of too oily.  Next time I will cut back on the oil / butter and use other ingredients.  Overall great recipe though!

This is awesome!!!  Kids loved it :) The only thing I did different was change the oil to Olive Oil and I only had fresh Basil so I chopped up three leaves...All ingredients were in the house.  This was so easy and so good. Next time I will serve with fresh bread and salad to complete this meal but it's not needed.  YUMMY and Thank you for this awesome meal.

I loved this.  I used one extra can of clams and more garlic and dried herbs than it called for ( 1 T parsley and 1 t basil )  and it was great.  Certainly can cut back on the oil without any change of flavor if youo desire.  Great and simple recipe!!!!  Try it!

We really enjoyed this. I followed most of the directions but used only 4 T olive oil and 2 cloves garlic. Omitted basil. I sauted my garlic first to release it's flavor. I also added 1/2 c. of half and half cream. I added 1T cornstarch mixed with a little half and half just to give it a bit more thickness. Dunked a nice crusty italian bread in sauce. I also used a litte less pasta, so we could have a lot of sauce on it. Served in bowls. Very good both ways! It was so fast and easy! Thanks Dorothy!

This was my first attempt at clam linguine, and it was so much easier than I expected.  I get this at a local restaurant and like it, but their sauce is pretty bland.  This sauce, is not.  I made it just as written but reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.  I thought I would try it based on other reviews knowing I could just add it in later if needed, but I didnt think it needed it.  The sauce is very flavorful, but only enough for two servings if you ask me.  The author says to add chicken broth to extend it, but I didnt see that and added a bit of the water from the pasta.  It worked fine, but the broth would be better.  All in all, I will make it again, and again, and again.  Cheaper than the restaurant, better flavor, and now that I've done it once, I could make this start to finish in 15 minutes.  What dinner can you make in 15 minutes that tastes like this and satisfies that craving for clam linguine?  I cant even drive to the restaurant that fast.

My Fiance is Sicilian and when I was searching for a new recipe I came across this. This is the exact recipe his Nonna(grandmother) uses that her family has made since they were in Sicily! Only minor differences, we use fresh parsley and olive oil

Took the suggestions and made this with olive oil instead of plain veg oil, more garlic,  used red pepper flakes, the parmesan, and FRESH Italian parsley.  Helloooo-was it ever yummy!!! Also, I added an extra can of chopped clams for more body, and only simmered the liquid from them with the other ingredients (mom's from WA, and it's sacrilege to over-cook seafood), then added the clams at the end just to heat them through. Had the leftovers for lunch next day!

This was VERY good! And so quick and easy. Ran out of olive oil so used half n half olive/vegetable and it still turned out great. Would have used more garlic myself but my BF is not a big garlic lover. I ended up thickening it a bit using cornstarch which I DON'T like doing but since I like a thicker sauce.. .  will be looking into using pasta water and less oil next time as others have suggested. . . AND oh yes . . . use FRESH herbs if you can ! I did ! Served with parmesan YUMM !

I'm sorry, I did not care for this. When I poured the sauce on the linguine, the sauce all went to the bottom of the bowl.  On the plate, the sauce separated from the linguine.  Needs some cream, more garlic, maybe onions - it was just totally bland!

This is such an easy but elegant dish - - totally company worthy.  I halved the butter and oil.  I also added some sliced onions, red pepper strips, and much more garlic than called for (the more the better).  Some white wine, bay seasoning, and juice of 1/2 lemon, also added more depth to the dish.  Good stuff!

This was excellent for a quick and delicious clam sauce. I added 1/4 c. of white wine to give it some tartness and balance the flavors. I let it reduce for a 1/2 hr. My husband and 9 year old son both loved it.

This recipe was quick, easy and delicious.  I took another reviewer's advice and used 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 tbls butter instead of the listed oil and butter and added a splash of white wine to give it another layer of flavor but overall it was yummy.  My kids even liked it!

I followed the recipe and it came out too oily and bland. I added some lemon juice and salt to help the flavor. My kids loved it, but it upset my stomach. I will cook it again but I will cut out most of the oil.

Yummy! I cut the oil in half, used fresh basil instead of dried, added 2-3 Tbsp of sour cream to sauce for extra flavor, and added a little corn starch to thicken it up. This will be a regular dinner around our house.

As is, it is BLAND. Add some parmesan, some crushed red pepper and about 12 times as much garlic and it's yummy.

This was a good recipe to get started with - there are so many variables one can do- I did saute the garlic in olive oil and added red pepper flakes - fresh basil and parsley and added a little low fat half and half. at the end to thicken just a bit.... really very good

I couldn't believe how easy and delicious this recipe is! As good,if not better than I've had in any restaurant. I didn't change a thing in the recipe,and almost felt like a chef when I was done. Also, forget about 30 minute meals or takeout,this was so quick,it was more like a 20 minute meal. Thank you,Dorothy!

Excellent!!  Followed recipe as directed. EASY & QUICK! I love meals that use very few dishes.  Here you have your saucepan and a stockpot, a few utensils and that's it!  I served this with crusty french bread ala Pillsbury refrigerated dough and a tossed salad.  Best meal I've made in a long time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Because we like a lot of sauce, I added an 8oz bottle of clam juice to the recipe. I used garlic oil instead of veg oil and this was outstanding. The best Linguine w/Clam Sauce we've ever had. Thank you.

This recipe is so incredibly easy and equally delicious!  I substituted extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil, used 1 tsp of minced garlic, fresh parsley and basil, and only 1/8 cup butter.  It does not need more than that.  I avoided boiling the sauce as that will make the already cooked canned clams too tough. Top with shredded parmesan cheese...Whala! Tastes like you've spent hours in the kitchen ;-)

This is great...but I really watch my fats.  Believe me...you don't need all of the oil and butter.  It is really great without it.  Just enough to saute the garlic and onion is all that you need!!!

Yummy!!! I always double the amount of garlic and parsley.  Use fresh parsley if you have it, it really makes a difference.  We also sprinkle ours with a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes for added kick!

This was a great recipe - which I really enjoyed! I cook gluten free, so I used a corn/amaranth/quinoa past - and it worked fine. I can't say much more than that. It was awesome.

5* Restaurant style Clam Sauce for sure! The only thing I changed was to have 1 tablespoon of garlic, as we love it in our house! My 78 year-old Dad's comment was "More sauce and less linguine next time" even thought his linguine was SWIMMING in the sauce - he said he could eat the sauce as a soup. DH and my 6 year old grandson also love this sauce. Easy and delicious is just my type of recipe!

Pretty good for canned clams. I would make it again but I would use more chopped clams to make it a more chunkier sauce. Definately use more garlic for this dish.

My husband and I liked it, but our toddler wasn't interested.  I cut the oil in half and used olive oil.  There was plenty of liquid with this.  If you like a butter flavor, this recipe is great.

This was really oily tasting.  We used way more garlic than suggested.  We love garlic!  Thanks goodness because it lacked some flavor.  The parmesan cheese really made a difference once added to the top.  Probably won't be making this again.

This is REALLY tasty, and very fast to make!  I cut the oil in half, and made it more creamy by adding 3 TBS of sour cream.  Then I thickened it with about 1 1/2 TBS of corn starch.  Using fresh basil and parsley makes it even better.  I served it once over pasta, but quickly the next time over leftover rice and it was great both ways.

The sauce was really good.  Really simple to make.  I did add a bit more garlic and when I served it, I tossed it with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.  Also I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, but still used the butter.

Great base.  Use  extra virgin oliv.e oil in place of vegtable oil.  Use Choppeed cilantro frozon and dry basil . Added more garlic.  I would use  2 can of minced claims with juice and added one or two can with no juice.  Needed more clams. Use red pepper flakes instead of  black.  At the end I added about a table spoon of peorino romano to take the place of the salt to the sauce.

Tastes great and comes together quickly.  I used olive oil versus vegetable.  I also added a few hot pepper flakes for some kick but that‚Äôs just personal preference.  When I‚Äôm using canned clams I prefer not to boil so I brought the sauce to boiling with just the clam juice and then added clams.  This helps to keep them more tender.  I finished the pasta with a squeeze of fresh lemon.  A great pantry recipe and very versatile!

I made this tonight for dinner.  Spouse liked the recipe.  I did sub garlic olive oil for vegetable oil.  I used a can of chopped clams and baby clams and waited until there was less than 4 minutes left on the pasta cooking time and added the clams as you just want to heat them up.  Longer exposure to heat makes the clams rubbery.  I also added some parmesan cheese to thicken the broth.  Fast, good, and fattening but as a semi monthly meal I say enjoy and calories be dammed!

Great recipe!  I  changed the vegetable oil to olive oil,  increased  butter to 1/3 cup, 4 huge cloves of garlic thinly sliced that I saut√©ed in the butter and olive oil,  home grown basil, parsley & hot peppers  and always add 1 more can of clams. This is great tonight & for tomorrow I add another can of clams & fresh linguine to the leftovers if there are any!

I have been making this recipe about once a month for at least 5 years. I use FAR less butter and oil, and usually add extra clam juice and a little hot sauce or a finely minced hot chili. Sometimes I'll saute a bit of garlic and onion at the beginning, and add a little alfredo. Often I make it just as it is here. We keep a few cans of clams and linguine on hand at all times, because this is one of our "Yummy dinner in 15 minutes" standbys.

I tried it tonight but made a couple of changes that I think really improved it:  used EV olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used fresh parsley (at the end) instead of dried.  Added some red pepper flakes and a dash of white wine to the sauce.  But most importantly:  I made the sauce in a skillet and added the cooked pasta to it and let the pasta soak for 10 minutes or so.  The sauce thickened and I added grated parmesan at the end and more on top as we ate.  It was very, very good.

I omitted the butter, used Milanese Gremolata olive oil ("infused" purchased from an olive oil store), topped with a little grated Parmesan and it was wonderful!

Great and easy. I swapped veg oil with EVOO. Used fresh basil and used Italian seasoning as I had no parsley. Served with salad, made a fast and easy meal.

The recipe is 'somewhat' close as to how this is supposed to be made. However, the mere idea of using vegetable oil is beyond preposterous! Not only that, but a half cup of it is insane! Olive oil ONLY, as that is what is meant to be used, and certainly not a half cup full! What are we doing here... deep frying? YIKES!!

I made this recipe but sauteed the garlic first and added fresh flat leaf parsley chopped.  I used 3 cans of chopped clams and the juice.  It was delicious and of course the linguini.

Great pantry dish! Only takes minutes and presto, a delicious low-carb dish. Would be enhanced by a little acid--lemon juice or white wine--but recipe's definitely a keeper.

I halved this recipe for just the two of us and it worked out beautifully.  The changes I made were doubling down on the garlic and I used my very best EVOO.  This made for a somewhat lighter sauce than the most popular canned version.   In the future, I may add extra clams.  One great piece of advice from another reviewer is to wait until just the last minute or so to add the clams to ensure they are tender.   This really works!   Thanks for the tip.

This was excellent. Husband and I try to spend as much time in Italy as possible and this is our favorite dish. Made a couple of changes, 1/4 cup olive oil, 4 garlic cloves and 1/4 cup white wine (Sauvignon blanc is what I usually have around). Very easy to make and is really delicious!

Loved it!  I did use olive oil as others suggested, as well a a big handful of grated Parmesan at  the end to tighten it all up.  Also, a fair amount of salt to make the other flavors pop.  So easy, delicious and fairly inexpensive.  I won't be ordering this out at restaurants anymore!  Thank you for this great recipe:)

This recipe was decent (4 stars), though a little bland for our tastes. The second time around, we added the juice of half a lemon, and 1/4 c of olive oil + 1/4 white wine instead of the vegetable oil, and doubled the dried basil. We browned the garlic in the olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. 5 stars after that!

Great recipe!  My kids love it too.  I use olive oil, and saute the the garlic first.  Then add about 1/3 to 1/2 cup dry white wine.  After about a minute, add all of the other ingredients and a dozen clams.  Once the clams open I add about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of cream to make it into a nice white sauce.  Add fresh parsly at the end.  Delish!

This recipe is just what it claims to be - quick and easy.  It's not like the linguine with clam sauce you'd expect from a restaurant, but it's still really yummy and good.  I sauteed the garlic before dumping in all the ingredients, and used olive oil as recommended by so many other reviewers.  I found the liquid a bit liquidy and might try adding some of the pasta sauce to the final minutes of cooking to try to thicken it up.

This was SO good and easy to make.  My husband who grew up on the coast said, "It's the best ever" and my kids (6 and 8) loved it too.  I made a couple of changes based on other reviews.  
I used 1/2 the butter, olive oil instead of veg oil, 3 cans of clams (1 minced, 2 chopped), more basil, and added 1/2 T oregano.  Also, I added about 1/8 C parmesean, 1/8 C pasta water and 1/4 C milk to help it thicken.  I served it over gluten free pasta and it was amazing.  We are fighting over who gets the small amount of leftovers tomorrow :-)

This recipe rocked! I've made it 3 times in the last 3 weeks. I used 2 large cloves of garlic and added crushed red pepper to the garlic as it simmered. As recommended by some, I used 1/2 the butter and replaced it with equal volumes of pasta water. I finished the pasta off in the pan with the sauce and added parmesean cheese to thicken it. Soooooo good!

Love this recipe. Like others, I used olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil.  Much better results. I cooked my pasta, drained it, and made the clam sauce in the pasta pan. Then, mixed the pasta in with the sauce. I love one-pan meals. My husband and daughter loved it. Served with salad and scali bread. Delicious and easy!

I made this with some left over curly pasta. I added LOTS of garlic (because I like garlic) It came our great. Clams are really high in vitamin B. Great for women who have just had a baby I think that this is a simple enough recipe that mos hubbies could make it for the family.

My 11 year son said this was the best linguine & clams recipe in the world.  I used a little less than 1/4 cup of each reduced fat butter and olive oil.  Used 4 cans of clams, but juice from 2 cans of clams.  Also used 1 TBSP garlic, 1/2 small onion finely chopped, 1 chopped roma tomato, red pepper flakes, tiny bit of white pepper and 1/4 -1/2 cup white wine.  Let the broth reduce for 20 minutes if you need to or thicken by adding 1/4 - 1/2 cup pasta water or 1 tsp of tomato past.  Add clams at the very end so you don't overcook them.  This was absolutely delicious!  My son also said this was better than his favorite clam dish at Amici's in Vacaville, CA.  He even wants to take leftovers to school for lunch.

Deserved 10 stars + for simplicity and deliciousness!  I will never have canned clam sauce again.  Took some advice of reviewers and used olive oil, parm cheese, red pepper, a little lemon juice and a bit of pasta water and chicken stock since I made too much pasta.  This was soooo fast and so easy, I couldn't believe how great it was!

I liked this recipe. It was very good and easy to prepare. If you want a true taste of Italia, use a light olive oil instead of cooking oil, try fresh clams and don't forget lemon. I'm glad this recipe refrains from adding cheese (not authentic) but I'm sure tastes good to the American palate.

I made this a few months ago, and don't remember too much about it, other than that I liked it quite a bit. It has a good amount of clams. I'm not sure if it's a typo in the recipe or not, but 1/4 TABLESPOON of dried basil is a non-conventional measurement (instead of 1/4 tsp.) to me, but I approximated it anyway. This is a pretty easy, tasty and filling meal.

This was REALLY good, but a little soupy.  I added 4 cloves of minced garlic, used fresh basil instead of dried, and 1/3 c. olive oil.  I think next time I will use 3 cans of clams and drain 2 of them.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I'm a huge fan of linguine with clam sauce when I'm at Italian restaurants. This was a very good version. I substituted olive oil for the veggie oil, of course, and didn't use quite as much as it called for. But other than that, followed the recipe with great results.

It's a keeper. Even the triplet 9 yr olds loved it. Used olive oil and lots of garlic as suggested by many. Served with roasted broccoli and garlic toast. Yum!

I made this for the first time last night and not only was it delicious, but it was also easy. My picky 6 yr old, and my picky husband also loved it! I followed the recipe exactly - except I used 4 cloves of fresh garlic. I also grated fresh Parmesan over the pasta once it was served. French bread dipped in olive oil with garlic completed the dish. I had left overs for lunch today, and it was just as good the second time around. If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!

I cannot believe how simple and tasty this recipe is!  My boyfriend's favorite dish is white clam sauce (he usually orders in restaurants) and he absolutely LOVED this dish!  Thanks!

The only thing i plan to change next time i make it is i will reduce the oil to 1/4 cup and add maybe 1/4-1/2 cup of white wine (it was just a little too oily for me).  I also used fresh parsley and garlic when I made it.  Fresh does make a little difference!

Ever since finding this recipe, I don't buy canned clam sauce anymore. I do saute the garlic in the oil (until right before it browns) before adding the remaining ingredients. Also, I crush the dried herbs in my palm before adding them to make sure their flavors are maximized.

I made this for my family for New Year's  Eve dinner, with quite a few adjustments which, we think, make it a 5:  I added 6 oz. crimini mushrooms; in place of dried herbs I used a fresh bunch of basil and parsley; I used 5 cloves of garlic and 3 cans of clams, using all the juice.  I thickened with cornstarch.  Everyone loved it!

I so agree with the other reviewers about the oil issue. Way too much here. I decided to ditch the oil completely and replace it with white wine. This would have been very bland had I not added seasonings including fresh garlic.

Our 2 year old absolutely LOVED this...she asked for more twice and ate just about as much as we did. It was a little too oily for me and next time we make it we will cut back on the oil and use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Very east and quick, but concerned a bit too high fat.  I cut the olive oil in half and used smart balance and it still tasted good.

This was absolutely delicious!  Very similar to another recipe on this site, but much better by far.  I added red pepper flakes and garlic to the oil/butter mixture, then followed the recipe to the t, except I used cilantro and fresh basil.  It was sooooo good and easy too!  Thanks a lot, will be making again.

I added one can of mushrooms, and used three cloves of garlic. About two tbsp of cornstarch made it a perfect creamy consistency. Don't forget grated parmesan on top.

Very good recipe, make sure you strain your clams and rinse and rinse again to get rid of any sand, be sure to strain the juice very well also. I like this recipes with fresh mushrooms, onion, and a little sour cream and dry white wine in the sauce.

This is good, but I use olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and butter -- I think it gives it a more authentic taste.
Also, I recommend sauteeing the garlic for about 30 seconds (do not brown) before throwing in the rest of the ingrediants.
I also add a dash of red pepper flakes right before the end.  Very yummy.  :-)

Linguine with clam sauce is my favorite dish but until now I haven't been able to find a great recipe!  This is as good as eating at my favorite resturant.  I thickened up the sauce with a little flour right before I served it.

THIS is an EXCELLENT recipe! Agree with other reviewers, Olive Oil is a must! Saut√© the garlic a bit with a tad of the Oil. Used tons! Bit of red pepper flake.  Adding the fresh Parmesan right before serving gives it that ‚Äòsilky‚Äô kind of thick.  Flavor was best I‚Äôve made in quite some time!

This is an awesome recipe that equals many linguine with clam sauce dishes I have had in restaurants. Many of the ingredients most cooks have in their pantry already so it makes it easy and quick for last minute dinners. The next time I make this again,  I will saut√©  my garlic and substitute EVOO for vegetable oil. However, I am rating this recipe as written.

This is a great marinade. I followed the receipt for the most part, I did cut the Ginger and Cinnamon in half as suggested. But there was still a nice balance of flavors.  The chops glazed up on the outside.  I will use this again and think the reduced sauce would go excellent on grilled Salmon.

With the added changes, it was awesome. After I put the water in the pot, I started on the sauce. I used OLIVE oil (1/4 cup), 2 tb of butter, and 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. I sauteed the garlic first and then added the rest of the ingredients plus 1.5 tb of white wine. Just before serving, I added parmesan cheese to thicken it a bit. Restaurant quality!

This needs some acid! Too much oil and not enough flavor. We threw the pasta away after a few bites.

Amazing simple and tasty recipe that you can easily tweak.  I like to turn up the spice with extra red pepper flakes and I also add a splash of white wine.   Scrumptious!

I used this recipe as a guide but  tweaked it according to my family‚Äôs taste. Used  a stick of butter, 4 large garlic cloves, two large cans of clams and juice, three Tbs flour to thicken, and a teaspoon of basil. Fresh parsley to garnish. Yum!

We added a pound of fresh, washed clams and let them steam open in the broth.  It was delicious and just added that extra touch.

Absolutely scrumptious! I did alter a few things, but not much.  Used half the butter and half the olive oil, added lots more fresh garlic plus one bunch of green onions, an extra can of clams (without sauce), a dash or two of red chili flakes, and a squirt of lemon.  I think I‚Äôll use the chopped clams next time rather than minced, and I really needed only half the pasta. This recipe is so easy to customize to taste, which is just what I did. My clam hating husband even loved it!

This was delicious and amazingly simple. I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil, 3 tsp of minced garlic, added whole clams to cook in the sauce and made shrimp with saut√©ed baby San Marzanos on the side. Topped with fresh grated Parmesan, paired with a Pinot Grigio. Way more delicious than I was expecting. I will definitely be making this again.

This pasta dish was really good and I will make it again.  My husband loves clam linguine but this is my first time making it.  I used olive oil and very little butter as some other reviewers suggested and I also used fresh clam strips so I used bottled clam juice with it.  I used Parmesan cheese at the end to thicken it instead of flour.  I did use more spice than the recipe called for and used a lot of fresh garlic.

I gave this recipe 4 stars.  I replaced the vegetable oil with 2T olive oil.  Half cup of veg oil in the sauce sounds unappetizing. And really unhealthy!  I did add a splash of lemon juice and about 1/4 cup white wine. These last 2 ingredients add a little tang to the sauce.

I saw this in the November 2016 issue of allrecipes magazine and had to try it.  I served with garlic bread and we enjoyed this very much.  I might add white wine next time around.  Thank you!

I just made this recipe tonight it's really good. The only thing I would change in adding a little more citrus!

better than most restaurants. the reviewers that said theyd put this on a monthly schedule are wrong.  weekly minimum...better yet every other day. I would not mention the calorie count to anyone but suggest celery and water for breakfast and lunch before presenting this superb dish.

We loved this! I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added grated Parmesan cheese right before I served it. My husband, who is very picky (funny) about any seafood dish that I make, thought it was fantastic!

I thought the flavor was lacking.  At least when you make this dish with clam sauce and wine (and a little lemon) there's more flavor.  This was good, but sadly I'd say not worth the high fat content.

Loved this! My mom used to make something like it when I was a kid. I happened to run across it again recently after randomly thinking about it and not being able to place the ingredients, I just knew it had clams. Then, I found this recipe on the magical Allrecipe's and made it at home. It cost $5-$7, with quality ingredients, took the amount of time to boil the noodles to throw it together and was yummy! I used fresh herbs instead of dried as it's summer and I had them on hand. I'm sure dried will be fine over the winter. I served it with crusty garlic bread and a side salad. It's going into the dinner rotation for sure.

I followed the recipe to a T.  I can't figure out what I did wrong.  Waaaaaaaaaay too much oil.  I had heart burn before I even finished.  Awful.  Only recipe with which I have had a problem so I figure, must have done something wrong.  I've made it three times, but never again.

The only change was that I held back adding the clams w/juice until after the garlic had browned a little bit.

Made per the directions.  Sauce turned out good.  I really like clams and found that canned clams left me disappointed.   Or, perhaps it was the absence of another incrediant not listed.  I'll try this or other linguine & clams recipes  in the near future.

I made it as described, except I didn't use all the juice in the minced clams can & my husband LOVED it and he can be pretty picky in that his Mom was one fantastic cook and he can be particular with certain meals like this one! I don't eat clams so I can't say but I can rate it 5 starts by the feedback I got! Enjoy!

My pasta ended up in a huge puddle of oil. Either the amounts need to be adjusted or a binder (parmasean? bread crumbs?) needs to be added. Will not make again.

This clam sauce was of restaurant quality.....very good!!  We loved the addition of the basil.  Only thing I added was some extra garlic to it.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.

All I can say is "WOW!!"
This was my first attempt at making clam sauce, and I'm sorry I've waited this long. This recipe is so easy and convenient to whip up.
I did substitute fresh parsley vs. dried, substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and reduced it to 1/4 cup. I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth instead. Also, added additional minced garlic for extra flavor. 
I found the sauce to be on the thin side, so I thickened it a bit with some corn starch.
I will DEFINITELY make this again!! I no longer have to buy canned clam sauce when I want to make a quick and easy meal.

Made this recipe using a few suggestions from other reviewers: 1/4 olive oil instead of veg. oil, added a little butter, added a little extra garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes, and parmesan at the end.  Super easy.  Everyone in the family (incl. 4 kids) loved it. Delicious!

This was so easy and delicious!  I varied the recipe slightly out of convenience but I'm sure it's great as is.  Here's what I did, which I would suggest if you want to make this dinner even nicer:

Steam ~2 dozen little neck clams in garlic butter and white wine per the instructions of this Allrecipes article, http://allrecipes.com/howto/cooking-clams/.  

Remove the clams from the pan and set aside, but leave the liquid on low heat and let it reduce a bit.  Add 3 tbsp butter (since I already used 1 tbsp making the garlic butter for the clams) and most of the ingredients above.  I omitted any additional garlic since I already used a full teaspoon and only used about 2 tbsp of olive oil.  Follow the rest of the directions and serve topped with the steamed clams.  SO GOOD!

The sauce to pasta ratio is way too low.  As is, too oily without any substance.  So much fat, and no body.

Needed some changes - olive oil not vegetable oil. Also added a touch of white wine, lemon juice, along with seasoning (salt and pepper). I also added half&half to give it a slightly creamier texture.

I made this yesterday and it came out delicious! It was so easy to do. I made it exactly as the recipe says (butter and oil and all) with one exception: I waited until the end to add the clams and clam juice. I will definitely make this again and share with friends! I am right now cooking some more linguine and going to eat the leftovers. It was wonderful with a side salad too.

I'm a terrible cook but this was so easy, even for me!  I wanted a clam recipe because they are high in iron and I am deficient.  The recipe says it takes 32 minutes, but it took me less than 20.  Great simple recipe.

I decreased amount of oil by half or better, but still this was so delicious. I've been using a recipe that calls for white wine and only olive oil but the butter makes this so rich tasting, I won't go back to my old recipe!

Easy, fast and fantastic.  I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and a lot more garlic (I think 8 cloves) plus a lot of parmegian (sp?).  Loved it!

This got a big thumbs up from DH and 19 yr old son.  I liked how easy it was to make (I am allergic to seafood so I didn't eat the finished product).  I agree with others about adding more garlic (I used a heaping tspn for 4 servings).  I also cut back on the oil.  For 4 servings, I used 1/4 cup butter and simmered the garlic for a few minutes.  Then added 1/4 cup EVOO, 1/4 cup pasta water, 1/4 tspn red pepper flakes, and 1 can of minced clams and their juices.  Brought it a boil.   Dished it up atop the pasta and topped with the chopped herbs.  I was afraid it was too saucy but hubby said if it was thicker his bread wouldn't sop up the juices as well.  Next time I might add 1-2 tspn flour to the butter/garlic mixture and let that cook before adding the other ingredients.  I'll probably also sub dry white wine for the pasta water so I can prepare the sauce  while the pasta is cooking.  This is soooo easy to make that it will go into my list of "go to" weeknight recipes.  If using dried herbs all the ingredients are typically on hand.  Terrific recipe, Dorothy.  Thanks for sharing.

PS - For other who don't/can't eat seafood, prepare the recipe up to the adding the clams part.  Divide the sauce in half and add 1 can of clams to one half.  Add 1/2 cup dry white wine and 1 tspn Better than Bullion (chicken flavor) to the other half.  Heat both through and serve as described.

Super easy and very tasty!  Added red pepper flakes for an added zing and a dozen fresh clams steamed in the sauce while it cooking for presentation and an added wow factor.  Made my in-laws proud, will make again and again!

Easy and delicious recipe using canned clams. Canned clams are an excellent source of iron and I'd prefer to eat this instead of liver! I added the parm at the end as suggested by others.

Yum! This was a nice change from the super creamy version I usually make. Thank you to the earlier reviewers who suggested the red pepper flakes. I served this with whole wheat noodles and my 3 year old tried to drink the sauce that was left in her bowl!

Not sure what's more surprising - how EASY this was or how GOOD this was!  Made it just as written with a couple of minor changes.  Only changes were using 4 cans of clams, a little more garlic, and about half the butter.  Evenstill, how yummy.  Everyone (even my picky "I hate everything" 6 year old) liked it.

Following tips from other reviewers, I added sour cream to the sauce, thickened it with pasta water and cornstarch, added more minced garlic and used fresh minced parsely. The result: divine! My hubby and kids loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making linguini and clam sauce and was very happy to find a recipe with such simple ingredients (no need to buy white wine). I couldn't believe how good this turned out! I'll be making this one again!

Having never made a clam sauce for pasta before, I was a bit nervous - but this was wonderful!  I had some fresh steamers left over from a previous meal, so I used 1 can of minced clams instead of 2, and just purchased some clam juice, eyeballing the liquid level using the empty can.  It was quick and easy, and hit the spot!

Read the reviews and tried this recipe. I liked that it was so easy.   I followed as written and thought it tasted very flat.  I added a pinch of salt and that seemed to wake it up a bit.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I halved the servings to have as a second sauce with my standard meatball and tomato spaghetti sauce.  It was so good that next time I'll make all clam sauce.  I didn't think I was much of a clam sauce person, but I am now!

I halved the recipe to make it for 4 servings.  I wish I would have made the full amount of sauce though!  This was sooo yummy. I used all of the butter and substituted olive oil for vegetable oil. I added red pepper flakes and parmesan as someone else suggested. Thanks for a great clam sauce recipe! This will be made often in our home.

I used fresh parsley, and cut down on the butter/oil (used enough to saute the garlic and parsley).  Very good.  Very easy.  A big crowd pleaser.

Just to let you know use vegetable oil, not any other type of oil. And also to help with flavor saute garlic, oil, and butter for a few minutes without added the calms. Just for a few minutes. I'll try this again and hopefully i'll do it right.

i cut the oil and butter by half, and added 1/8 cup of wine to extend the sauce.  i also used garlic salt and lemon pepper to taste. i also nixxed the parsley but doubled the basil (no parsley fans in my house).  2 cans of whole clams instead of chopped. subbed the linguine with fetuccini and it was great! next time i'll try it with fresh clams!

Delicious- my boyfriend didn't like it because he doesn't like creamy sauces in general, but I loved it. Have made it twice already now and it's perfectly easy to whip up after a long day at work.
