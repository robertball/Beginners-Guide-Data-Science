This was really good!  I used it for a Caribbean Party I had and everyone really enjoyed it!  I added a little bit of Sprite to taste to cut the sweetness.

This was very sweet and the brandy lent it a strange taste, not to mention the fruit punch. I have to pass on this one in the future.

I didnt like this at all.  The flavors clashed and didnt taste very well together.  I might try again with a different fruit punch next time to see if its any better.

I made this as a punch, made a bulk amount, and substituted peach schnapps for the apricot brandy and it was a huge hit.
