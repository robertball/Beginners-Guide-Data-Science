Very tasty and easy to make. They are quite rich so I cut them into smaller bars. I also added about 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. Everyone enjoyed them at a recent party and asked for the recipe.

These bars deserve a better rating than 3 for their taste.  They were pretty good.  I was a bit disappointed because they looked pretty plain and I had a hard time getting them out of my baking dish.    Mind you - that didn't stop my family from gobbling them up.

My husband loves coconut, but isn't much of a dessert fan.  He ate 3 of these right out of the oven.  Very tasty!

My husband and daughter love this recipe.  The only thing I will do different is use crushed graham crakers on the bottom of the pan instead of mixing them into the mixture.  This will help the mixture to not crumble apart.

One of the easiest and tastiest recipes yet!!  I am the mother of two toddlers and only have time to bake later at night.  I was able to make three batches of these tasty treats after 9:30 pm and was still in bed by 11:00.  My coworkers loved them.  Big thumbs up!!

Very Important Info: Bake on wax paper and right after you take the pan out of the oven, remove the wax paper, carrying the slab of yumminess and flip it over quickly upside-down onto a large plate. Slowly, peel back the wax paper and - tada! No mess and nothing is stuck! Cut when cool. These were so delicious, my coworkers loved them!!!!!

These are so good.
I used a little more graham cracker crumbs, a 14oz can of condensed milk, the coconut and chips. I then chopped some roasted pecans and sprinkled them over the top. I used parchment paper to press it all down into the pan. I baked them for 25 minutes, let them cool and they were delicious. I'll be making more of these very soon.

Goopy, sloppy piece of garbage you can't even cut.  I tried it twice and neither time worked.  I ended up balling this mess after it baked and coated them with cocoa.  It was the only way it could be salvaged.

I made this recipe in layers.  Using a graham cracker crust, then the coconut/condensed milk, and then put the chips on during the last 10 minutes of baking, smoothing them out when removed from the oven.  My husband loves to bring these to work during the holidays as part of a cookie/bar tray for his employees. Thanks!

Easy to put together, and everyone enjoyed them.  I just thought it strange that it calls for 1 2/3 c. sw. cond. milk. I used a 14 oz. can, which measured about 1 cup, and they turned out fine.  Easy, quick, and good!

This recipe is really nice and I liked the fact that it satisfied the chocolate craving but did not end up sickly sweet. I used Digestive Biscuits as family do not like the flavour of graham crumbs and the only chocolate I had on hand was beads of Belgian dark chocolate.  It worked very well for me. My family liked it very much.  Thank you for posting an easy and yummy bar.

These really hit the spot when looking to feed the sweet tooth. Surprisingly, they are not ovely sweet, just very, very yummy! Super easy to make and they keep very well. I also melted about 1/2 c. of choc chips with 1/4 c. peanut butter and frosted them after they had cooled. I'm going to make some (w/out the topping) to take camping this weekend as they will make an excellent "on the go" snack for hiking.

They do taste good. They were a bit difficult to get out of the pan. The top got quite brown, and the rest was pretty gooey. I'd like a more homogeneous consistency, but the consistency didn't detract from the taste. As mentioned earlier, they are quite sweet. I may try this again and try several modifications now that I see the shortcomings. I will likely finish eating all of these. They are quite tasty, in spite of their problems.

People go crazy over these bars.  They are always impressed and can't believe how simple they are.  I always up the chocolate amount, because I want more of a CANDY.  Also have made gluten free by using almond crumbs instead of graham crackers.  Excellent recipe.

Wow ...these were incredible.  I did make the mistake of putting the graham cracker crumbs on the bottom and they stayed there so I just spooned them on top after plating. I also used a 14 oz can of condensed milk per the other reviewers.

Love this recipe! The second time I made it I also added some chopped nuts and it really enhanced the flavor and texture. I also like backing these on 9x13 pan and making them a little thinner.

These were GREAT!  Similar in taste to 7 Layer Magic Bars, but I loved that you just mix everything together and bake.  Less crumbs dropping as you eat these.  This is a keeper.

These bars are pretty good, and very easy due to the few ingredients. They're chewy.

Just made these for my coconut-loving father-in-law.  Five stars for ease, taste and texture.  I lined my 11x7 pan with parchment and snipped the corners for overlap.  Had no problem removing the bars from the pan and parchment. I popped the whole thing in the fridge cool and cut into small squares.  Unfortunately, I keep eating them!  Also, I did use one 14 oz can of SCM and they were perfect.

I layered this recipe and mixed the bottom cracker layer with a small amount of melted butter to make a lose crust. I mixed the coconut and milk as directed and sprinkled the chips on top. The trick is to allow them to fully cool! If you touch them before the pan is cold you will end up with a mess.

It's amazing what a 'mixed up magic/7-layer bar' tastes like, it's actually really good.  I used an 8-inch pan and checked it at 28 minutes and it was golden brown and almost too done around the edge, so I would check it at about 25 minutes.  Also, I used one 14-oz can of sweetened condensed milk (easier than measuring).  I think adding some butterscotch chips would be good as well.  I liked that they were chewy (although a bit hard to get out of the pan).  Love that it is quick, simple, and easy yet good and flavorful.

Super quick, easy, and tasty!  Having only 4 ingredients makes grocery shopping easier. I have made it 3 times in about 10 days and EVERYONE (even ones that don't usally like sweets) loved them!  It is SO EASY TO MAKE that my boyfriend- who NEVER cooks, even made it!  Great recipe! thank you!

I doubled the recipe and accidentally put too many chocolate chips in...like anyone would ever complain about that! :)  I baked it in a 13x9 pan at 325F on convection for 35 mins and it's perfect.  An oooey gooey chocolate mess.  Love it!

Just did not do it for us. Every time we took a bite it was as if it was missing something.  I will not make again. Oh and I prepared the pan per the other reviewers not sure it will ever all come out of the pan just short of a jack hammer.

These were AWESOME! They were a huge hit with everyone!! Only having to buy and use 4 ingredients was great and the preparation couldn't have been any easier, either. You can keep all of the ingredients on hand and whip them up as a quick dessert anytime. I am passing this recipe along to my friends, too.

I had the same problem as a few of the other reviewers who noted that these are way too gooey and sticky (and I even added more crumbs and less condensed milk than the recipe called for!), and they were far too sweet. I might try it again with modifications, maybe less condensed milk and add more crumbs or some flour or something else to soak up the sweetness.  They were easy though...

They were delicous except it was chewy on he edges and the bottom. I would also decrease the cocont and increase baking time to 40 min., but other than that it was good.

These bars taste great and are so easy to make.  If you like nuts, try adding almond slivers.  Just sprinkle the almonds on top of the melted chocolate.  We make these every Christmas and always do one batch with nuts and one without.

This is a great weeknight dessert. It was so easy my daughter actually made it.
We kind of skeptical of how they would out but they were great, expecially if you love coconut and chocolate. We double the recipe because we're a large family but accidenly added the whole bag of chocolate chips. They taste kind of like a really sweet version of a chewy granola bar.

Similar to magic bars, I like this better because there aren't as many ingredients. I just crumbled up graham crackers in a bag and followed with the rest of the ingredients.

These are so good, the whole batch disappeared in less than an hour! I've already gotten requests to make these again. Thanks for a great (and super easy) recipe.

Can't get any easier than this one....made for a chocolate / coconut fan...absolutely loved it...shared with others and recipe requests followed. I used mini chocolate chips rather than normal size.

The ingredients are similar to "Magic Bars" (without the nuts) that my mom used to make. This is more cake-like though and is mixed together as opposed to layered. I scaled down the recipe because I only had a cup of sweetened condensed milk. (That may have affected it)  I also baked it in a smaller pan. My husband and daughter like them. I think it needs a little something, but cannot quite put my finger on it. Still, it was a nice treat. Thanks!

A good one made in a few minutes only. Very similar to the coconut rocks (rôchers coco) we find here in Europe.

Made 1/2 batch and baked in a rectangular pan. Turned out quite soft, delicious but not pretty to look at. Put them in the freezer to harden them up but to no avail. Now have coated the squares in nuts so that they can be removed from the serving plate! Not sure what I did wrong?

These bars were so easy to assemble.  I love short and sweet recipes.  Next time I will cook them longer than recommended.  I like a little crunch and mine came out pretty soft.  I may adjust the ratio of sweetened milk vs. coconut and graham cracker mixture.  I tend to like mine a little on the dry side.   The flavors were awesome and I will definitely add nuts next time.

I loved this dessert! I am not a baker so this was perfect for me.
I took the advice of another reviewer and greased the bottom of the pan with lots of butter and then did a layer of graham cracker crumbs. On top of that, I did a layer of butter and graham cracker crumbs mixed together. I only did about a cup of the graham cracker crumbs into the mixture.  It was no problem getting them out of the pan. Make sure they are fully cooled. 1 2/3 cup of condensed milk was a lot. I added more chocolate chips and next time will cut the milk down to 1 1/3 or 1/4.  This was made for our bi weekly family bbq and everyone loved it!

I read reviews & took the suggestion of only a can of sc milk.  Also greased the pan, added wax paper, greased it, too; removed immediately after baking.  Oh, I pressed walnut pieces on top.  Tasting the nonnut pieces, eh; pretty good, but really could use some crunch.  With nuts, much better - & more attractive.  My suggestion:  Add 'em to the mixture & drizzle melted chocolate on top.  Sooo easy, just not wow-wowing.  :/  Suggestion for the next person:  Add some vanilla &/or coffee extract.  Mmmmm?  :D

These are amazing as far as flavour goes, but when made as-is they lack visual appeal and are hard to cut up into squares to serve. I've made them many times and now I make the bottom a typical graham crumb and butter crust, then sprinkle the chocolate chips and coconut over, then pour the condensed milk on top of that.  The end result is just as delicious, but looks much nicer and is easier to serve.

I think this recipe is great!  If your lactose intolerant try the dark chocolate chips that are semi sweet.  Also I substituted cream of coconut (comes in a can at the grocery store) for the condensed milk.  The bars turned out excellent!!! Thank god there are alternatives for people like me and my fiance.

My husband loved these, but said that would be eve tastier with vanilla ice cream on the side.  I also love them, I can't believe that the calorie count is correct because 2 tablespoons of condensed milk already have 130 calories.  S as long as you are willing to indulge, then they are a great treat!

These were just ok. They seem like they are missing something. They just weren't sweet enough. Mine stayed gooey. I did exactly as the recipe stated and they browned on the outside, but not in the middle. Maybe adding more chocolate chips would help the flavor, but as written, I don't recommend it. The rest are going in the garbage. I hope this helps. They definitely aren't terrible, just aren't impressive at all.

I love this dessert! It combines two of my favorite things: chocolate and coconut! It is also very quick and easy to make. Just be sure to grease your pan very well, as it often sticks.

Delicious and so easy, but I did have a bit of trouble getting them out of the pan, and it was well greased (bottoms and sides) with butter spray.   I used vanilla wafer crumbs instead of the graham cracker crumbs, and it turned out just fine, just a bit lighter in color than the pic of the original recipe. I am going to use this recipe again, and I've thought about adding in some craisins to give it a bit of holiday flavor for Thanksgiving/Christmas.

I might have done something wrong.  Mine never really hardened up.  It did taste good thought.  I tried to toast the coconut before I made the candy because I like the flavor better and so that might have changed the overall outcome.  So I hope you have better luck than I did.  We drizzled with melted chocolate too!
