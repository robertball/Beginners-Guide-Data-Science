This chicken was great! I mixed all of the spices, olive oil and lemmon juice and rubbed it under the skin of the chicken and then over the top of the skin and poured the remainder in the cavity. I put about 3/4 cup water in the bottom of the pan and baked the chicken upsidedown with the breasts in the juices. I covered the whole thing in foil and in 2 hours the flavorful meat was falling off the bones. My company raved and everyone ate way too much. Served with baked apples, green beans and fresh bread. Delicious!

Very good.  I used boneless, skinless breasts; dumped on all the olive oil and lemon juice then sprinkled both sides with the herb blend.  Tasty and tender.  Baked at 350 for 30 min.

Without a doubt, one of the best chicken recipes I've found on this site to date. I just mixed all of the seasonings with the oil (doubled for a 5 lb. chicken) and brushed over the chicken. Stuffed the cavity with the spent lemons, a quartered onion and a few cloves of garlic. In the end, I added a few Tbsp. Wondra flour to the drippings to come up with a delicious lemon-herb gravy. This recipe is a true find... thanks so much, Barbara!

The only problem I had with this recipe is the specified cook time. Be prepared to cook the chicken at 325 degrees for around 2hrs - 2hrs 15min. At a little under 1.5hrs the meat was still very pink.

With my few changes, 5 stars! I used a 6 lb. roasting chicken which took 2.5 hours at 325 in a high-sided large aluminum pan. I doubled and mixed all the seasonings together using my own herbs for the Italian seasoning. I added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice and no olive oil. Instead, I mixed it all up in a 1/4 cup of melted butter and refrigerated until the butter was fairly solid. I lifted the skin of the chicken and applied the chilled and seasoned butterbits directly to the meat, saving some for the skin. After rubbing the rest of the butter into the skin, I also sprinkled on more garlic powder, salt and pepper. The only thing I used inside the chicken was half of an onion, 4 chopped garlic cloves and the lemon skins. Baked breast side down and tented with foil in 1/2 cup of broth for an hour at 325; the second hour I turned the chicken over and placed baby red potatoes around the chicken with no foil tent. I did not need more broth, but you should add some to keep the taters moist if needed. Check often, don't let it dry out! The last half hour I poured off most of the broth, turned the oven up to 400 so the skin of chicken and potatoes would crisp a little. Very Very good! You know it is done when you can practically tear off the legs and the juices are clear. If you are starved, the wings get done early, rip em off and have a taste-test! Thanks Barbzal!

i read somewhere on this site in the cooking tips section that brining the chicken would add extra flavor so it really worked. those who found it bland may want to try that.  i left out the seasoned salt,  brushed on the lemon juice/olive oil mixture first then rubbed on the seasonings. stuffed the inside with lemon wedges as suggested and added a bunch of garlic cloves too.  even using a smaller chicken took way more than a half hour, more like an hour and a half. used a roasting pan and left the lid off for the last half hour to crisp the skin a bit. next time will use more of the season mixture, it was almost the best part of the chicken!

Fabulous!  I did rub under the skin (we don't eat the skin) and added a quartered onion, 5 cloves of garlic and the lemon rind inside the body cavity while cooking.  This chicken came out perfect and everyone LOVED it!  Will definitely make again!

lovely, lovely, chicken! I made my own herb concoction too, using herbs de provence, dill, rosemary, tarragon, italian herbs, and essence of emeril. i also stuffed the cavity with the squeezed lemon skins, and baked a 5.5 1b chicken at 350 for about 2 hours. It was moist, lemony, and wonderful!

5 5 2005 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8709/roasted-lemon-herb-chicken/ ... This recipe gets five stars the first night & three the next. I got a Perdue (big) chicken so doubled the ingredients. If you double it, donâ€™t double the oil. It was very oily. I used 1/2cup lemon juice for the juice of 2 lemons & coarse ground black pepper. I also let the remaining (after rubbing some inside) dried spices sit in the lemon juice to rehydrate then whisked in the oil & used a pastry brush to apply it. It smelled great & tasted good. I wish I could have eaten more the first night. 10/18 'Tried w 1/4c lemon juice & basted.  Yum.

This is an easy recipe and the chicken is great.  Although I recommend making an extra portion of the oil/juice mixture for basting.

Huge payoff for very little fuss.  The flavor was out of this world excellent!  I didn't use the mustard powder, used only one lemon since that's what I had, and stuck the juiced lemon in the cavity along with a couple sprigs of fresh rosemary . I really liked the lemon juice mixed with the olive oil!  I started the oven at 450 degrees for 20 minutes, then finished at 350.  Fragrant while it's roasting, beautifully golden brown, and incredibly juicy, moist and tender.  I made a pan sauce which was outstanding - added some chicken broth and a little white wine to the drippings, then reduced it until it thickened to a luscious, velvety sauce.

I couldn't believe how tender this chicken was!  I followed the recipe as written with a fantastic result.  I had to tent some foil over the bird towards the end of the cooking time to avoid over-browining. I added some chicken stock to the bottom of the pan as it cooked and basted now and then. When done, I poured off most of the drippings (didn't want my gravy to be too lemony) and added additional chicken broth, a touch of dry sherry and thickened it with a bit of milk and cornstarch to make a wonderful gravy.

For anyone who likes to look at a recipe and then make it better and then tell us all what you did--DON'T.  This recipe is just right the way it is.  I have made it twice now and have had compliments both times about how moist the chicken was and how it tasted perfect.  It is such a simple recipe but the flavor is great.

I just used the boneless skinless chicken breasts, put 4 in the crockpot on lunch. Covered both sides of chicken with rub, drizzled oil and lemon juice and went back to work.  Awesome dinner when I got home.

Those who said the chicken took a lot longer to cook are those who stuffed the chicken with lemon and/or onion. Of course it's going to take longer! Just like roasting a turkey--stuffed or unstuffed require different cooking times.

Wonderful recipe with a few changes. I used a 5 lb. chicken and doubled all the rest of the ingredients.  I used a pastry brush to coat the skin with the lemon/olive oil mixture (inside and out).  Following this, I rubbed the inside cavity with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the seasonings, and heavily sprinkled the rest all over the coated bird.  I baked this at 325 degrees for 2 1/2 hours, basting with the leftover lemon/olive oil mixtures about every half hour.  Delicious!!!!!!!   Meat falls off the bone, juicy and very tasty!

I can't think of one negative thing to say about this recipe.  It was absolutely fantastic!  Be sure to slide the lemon juice/olive oil mixture under the skin of the chicken.  I also basted the meat every 20 minutes or so.  The lemon flavor was as we might hope--clearly prevalent, but not obnoxious--just the right suggestion of the lemon flavor.  I served this chicken with risotto and fruit salad ... it was absolutely delicious.

I pour the liquid over the chicken before adding the spices.  That way, the spices will not run down the sides.

Great chicken recipe!  Our bbq died this weekend and we were having company tonight for dinner..I needed something BBQ like to serve that I could cook in the oven..Glad I chose this!  It was fantastic.  The only changes I made were to double the seasoning and sprinkle a little on after I poured on the olive oil/lemon onto the chicken.  I also put 1/2 a lemon inside the cavity of the chicken, along with a couple of cloves of garlic.  This will now be my new go to chicken recipe!

We had this at Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly.  I mixed the season with the oil/lemon juice and rubbed it on the chicken.  I then stuffed the cavity with half a lemon and 4 garlic cloves.  Very good.

I'm so impressed with this simple recipe!! It tastes like a mix between Italian and Greek seasoning! I measured everything out exactly using 6 T. of bottled lemon juice in place of the fresh squeezed lemons and only added extra garlic powder and onion powder. I mixed all this together and poured over five chicken breast in a gallon size ziploc that I had pounded flat. After marinating for only three hours, this chicken had Sooo much flavor when my DH grilled it! I will definitely make this again, it's hard to keep chicken breast moist and flavorful and this recipe does a great job of that and is low calorie too!

This chicken is delicious and full of flavor!  I used a 7 pounder and the spice mixture was perfect and did not need to be doubled.  I brined the chicken for about 2 hours beforehand and then followed the recipe.  I did add about 1/4 tsp of lemon pepper seasoning since my chicken was so big but other than that kept the measurements the same.    I stuffed the cavity with the squeezed lemons and I think this intensified the flavor.  I did add about a cup of water to the bottom of the pan for basting and my chicken was done in 2 hours.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I did try to make a gravy out of the drippings but ran into problems because of the oil.  I did  end up making a good gravy using my chicken francaise gravy recipe.  I heated up some chicken broth and wine, took the lemons out of the cavity and squeezed out the rest of the lemon juice from 1/2 lemon into the broth.  I added some butter and flour and simmered until I got the consistency I wanted.  Amazing!!  Thank you Barbara, this is a keeper!

I followed this recipe as written.  The cooking time was off for me.  My chicken was a little over 3 lbs but, even at that I cooked this chicken for 2 hrs. 10 min. and the thigh area was a little pink. I kept checking at this point until the juices ran clear and there was no sign of pink meat. After letting the chicken sit for awhile I could not believe how tender and juicy it was when I was carving. I pulled the skin up and rubbed in the seasonings along the breast before cooking.  The smell in my kitchen during the cooking time was amazing. Can't wait to try this recipe again.

I tried this recipe, it was the best lemon herb chicken, I have had.  I read a few of the other reviews, before I made it. I noticed a few other reviews, suggested to go  2.5 hours at 350. I guess it depends on the oven. I have to say that this is as good as a rotisserie  chicken.

delicious and so easy.  I combined the seasonings with the olive oil and lemon juice.  only used 1 lemon and after squeezing it put it in the cavity with a few slices of onion and a few tablespoons of the seasoning mixture.  Also rubbed the seasoning under the skin.  Covered with foil until the last 15 min. Then removed the foil and increased the temp to 400.  Crispy skin and so juicy inside.  Thanks for sharing!

I roast a chicken every Sunday and the best, most flavorful and easiest way I've found is to first rub the whole chicken with salt and pepper (under the skin and inside included) and then with prepared pesto and lemon juice. I use about 1/2 cup pesto and 6Tbs lemon juice for a 5lb bird. I roast at 350 until the bird is 165 degrees. I use the leftovers all week in pastas, and salad. the chicken stays extremely moist from the olive oil and the basil gives the chicken a sweet and mild flavor and the citrus gives a really nice freshness and also helps to tenderize the bird.

This was really good. It did not mention to cover it with foil as I normally do when I cook chicken this way. I did baste it though then I suppose you would not need the foil.

This is pretty good.  I zested the lemons & added the zest to the rest of the seasonings.  I also put the lemon juice/oil mixture on the chicken first before rubbing in the seasoning so it would stick to the bird.  After juicing the lemons, I put the rind inside the bird.  It made it more lemony, but not overpowering.

So I made this chicken for Christmas dinner. A couple things went wrong because I wasnt paying attention. First I didnt have an mustard powder, so I used a little bit of onion powder instead. Second, I just now noticed this recipe is for a 3 pound chicken. My chicken was 6 pounds. I should have doubled. But I've got to say I cant complain. My chicken took about 2 and a half hours to cook and it was beautiful. Not only that but it was so good! My guests loved it. I definately thought the lemon was enough, but next time ill double up on the seasonings if I use a big chicken again. Great recipe!

Fantastic! I had a 6 pound chicken, so I doubled all the ingredients and baked at 350 degrees F for just over 2 hours. It turned out beautifully and tasted wonderful!

i've made this recipe twice for my homeboys, and they liked it.some of the other reviews mentioned that the meat was pretty bland, so i brined it for 2hours before   baking it. I found the brine recipe on this site, but i don't remember what it's call. Basically about 8cups water, 1cup kosher salt, a whole orange and lemon,cut and juiced,4 bay leaves, about 2tbsp sugar, handful of chopped garlic, a handful of dried thyme and a whole sliced onion. dump ur chicken in there at room temp for 2 hours and follow the recipe. 
the second time i bake the chicken, i used 1/2 tsp olive oil instead, cos 2tbsp is really too much. Chicken breasts -30min, thighs with skin on (yummilicious)-45mins, i also tucked the lemon wedges under the skin while bakin and removed them just before serving. Thanks for sharing!!

This is my third time making this chicken. And each time it was just WONDERFUL we simply mix the olive oil herbs and lemon juice together and rub that all under and over the next day we use the rest for our salads : > Thanks

Delicious!!! This is my new favorite chicken! The only adjustments I made was for the size of the chicken. I used a 7lb roaster - so I doubled the ingredients and cooking time. I also added a sliced lemon to the chicken cavity for cooking.

This was awesome.  Smells divine.  I had a 5.5 pound chicken so wasn't sure of cook time.  I googled roast times for chicken and came up with 1.75 hours at 375 degrees, first 10 minutes at 450 degrees to give it nice crunchy crust.  Was done at about 1.5 hours and cooked perfectly.  I made as directed except doubled the seasonings and lemon and oil due to size of chicken. Only thing I did different...after squeezing the juice out of the lemons for the marinade, stuff them into the cavity of the chicken while cooking. Yum.

My new favorite roast chicken recipe. I'll be making this one again. For the most part, I followed the recipe exactly. As others suggested, I did rub spices under the skin...also added about 1/2 tsp of kosher salt to the spice mixture. I stuffed the cavity of the chicken with a lemon, cut into quarters, and 4 smashed garlic cloves. I served with "orzo and kale" recipe from this site, along with a whole grain baguette....and a nice bottle of wine. Wonderfully, simple....and makes the house smell great!

Delicious and simple recipe! Made it twice. Minor changes, I didn't have mustard powder so I used "onion powder instead." Also, I added a dash of "lemon herb" spices and lots of lemon zest on top of the chicken and marinated it in the fridge for a least 30 minutes. Then, I baked it at 350 degrees covered in foil for about an hour. I then uncovered the chicken and baked for about 20 minutes in 325 degrees. Really juice, lemony, and tasty!

Great and easy recipe! It is so moist and flavorful. I used chicken breast in a roasting bag with the seasoning. It was faster than the whole chicken.

I don't think that there is anything in the world quite as satisfying as a good roasted chicken.  Yes, I am the one who has everyone rolling their eyes at a fine restaurant because I order the (yawn) chicken.  So, as a roasted chicken afficionado, I have to give my highest compliments to barbzal and this recipe.  I used an organic free range chicken from Trader Joe's and after squeezing the lemons, I stuffed the rinds inside the seasoned chicken.  Delectable!

I have made this recipe before and we really liked it. My husband requested it again, which makes it a definite 5 star! I make more of a paste with the spices and oil and use lemon pepper instead of lemon juice.

This was really yummy!  I usually make my roast chicken similar to this, but decied to actually use a recipe.  I omitted the mustard powder, because it just didn't seem to fit.  I used about 1/2 can low-sodium chicken broth to baste the chicken as it was cooking.  Great flavor!

Excellent recipe.  I made a 6 lb. chicken and increased the recipe measurements by 50% (3 lemons, 3 T olive oil, etc.)  It was a HUGE hit.  I also cooked the chicken in an oven bag.  The meat was very flavorful and fell off the bone.  This one is a keeper!

One of the best baked chicken recipes I have tried! I used the left over chicken and made a pot of chicken noodle soup. My husband said it was the best I have made, and I make a lot of soups! The herbs on the chicken cooked into the broth and added just the extra touch. I will definitely make this again.

Typically, I don't roast chicken this way and wanted to try something different.  I found the taste to be fine, but bland, and I really didn't like all the lemon when I tried to make gravy with the drippings. It would probably be a great marinade for grilling. My family liked it, especially the kids.

Why do so many people put everything on and under the breast and then turn it over? One even put seasoned butter on the breast and turned it over. Doesn't it all just run all over the bottom of the pan when done like that? I don't get it.

I found that if you rub the lemon under the skin, and then rub the herbs on it works better.  I also put some lemon slices inside the bird. I then use the oil on the outside skin. I also put a small onion, and a cut up carrot and a celery stalk inside also. This is extra yummy. I also use the carcass meat for chicken and noodle soup, and it is divine. Just boil the meat off the bones, remove the bones, and make the soup. We love this. Cooking time varies with the size of the bird. I use a thermomenter and aim for 185Â°F in the thickest part of the thigh next to the breast, or better yet, get a pop-up timer for chickens.

Just had this tonight (literally 10 mins ago) and everyone loved it. It had a nice lemony flavour and was so easy to make. Like other reviewers, I mixed everything together. I used oregano instead of Italian seasoning, used only 1 lemon, and I omitted the mustard powder (didn't have any). I also used 2 bone-in skin-on chicken breasts - I poked them all over with a fork, then marinated them with the sauce in a large Ziplock bag for about an hour. They turned out juicy and very tasty. We had it with Fettuccini Alfredo and a simple garden salad. Next time, I will try this with a whole chicken :)

Huge flavor and so moist! Delicious on it's own or phenomenal as chicken salad. I usually cook my whole chickens breast down to keep it from drying out, but no need with this recipe if you baste every 25 minutes with the lemon mixture. Will be making this many more times!

This came out extremely well. I doubled the weight of the chicken, and it took about an hour and a half to cook.  Stuffing the body with lemons seems to add some flavor. I also covered the chicken with tin foil to let the flavors penetrate the meat, and then removed it for the last 30 minutes of cooking to get a nice brown skin on top.  I served this with the roasted vegetable recipe found here. The two were a definate hit, and I will be making this again.

This was my first attempt at roasting a chicken, and I was sure I was going to totally botch it up.  Boy, did I surprise myself...and my husband!  I made my own italian seasoning of basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and marjoram, stuck one of the lemons in the cavity after I juiced it, and cut up a few red potatoes and threw them in the roasting pan too.  It took a lot longer to cook through than I expected, but the end result was well worth it!

I really liked this recipe.  Instead of putting the marinade on the outside of the chicken, I rubbed it directly on the breast under the skin.  The flavor was just incredible.  Great served with grilled vegetables.  Definitly will make this again.

Came out pretty well. I think next time, I will put some seasoning under the skin, so the flavor will better soak in. I combined it with another recipe for baking veggies underneath the chicken at the same time. Yum!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of a whole chicken with wonderful results. I seasoned both sides of the chicken generously with the herb mixture, then drizzled the olive oil/lemon mix over the chicken and poured the rest of the liquid around the sides of the pan. The only thing I changed was the amount of olive oil because I am dieting. I used two teaspoons of oil with the juice of one large lemon. It was perfect with the amount of chicken I had. The result was super moist, delicious chicken.

I made this on New Years Eve with crackpot mashed potatoes as a side dish. My husband and son both loved it and asked me to make it again......and let me add that my son is VERY picky about seasoning on chicken! I did use chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and baked it for about 30 minutes. I did not have mustard powder on hand so I used a small squirt of regular mustard and it was fine. I saved some of the seasoning blend and fresh  lemon juice and poured it over my vegetarian cutlet and it came out delicious.  This will be a repeat in my house!

Family loved this.  I did bake it covered for almost 2 1/2 hours.  I mixed 1/2 tsp each of basil, parsley and oregano for the Italian seasonings since I didn't have that.  Then I quartered a red onion and stuffed it in. I added some water to the pan, covered then baked it. I cheated with the gravy and mixed about 3/4 cup of the pan drippings with Heinz's jar gravy and heated it in the microwave.  Everything was so delicious.

This chicken turned out moist, juicy and very flavorful. I also put onion quarters, garlic cloves as well as the lemon in the cavity. I also mixed the seasoning and oil together and rub on the bird. Wonderful flavors. Nice recipe barbzal.

I just tried this recipe today. I read the other reviews and I am glad I followed what everyone said about doubling the seasonings. But I only gave it 4 stars because though I only used on lemon, it came out too lemony for me and my family.

The only thing I changed with the recipe is that I put the lemon - olive oil mixture on the chicken first prior to the herb mixture and I used regular salt instead of season salt. The chicken I used only needed about 1 hr 20 minutes in the oven. Excellent, the best roasted chicken I have made to date!

super dinner! mixed all spices with lemon juice and oil (doubled the ingredients) rubbed all over and inside of 2 chickens, then peeled two lemons and stuck them inside the chickens and put them on my Ron Propel Rotisserie.(remember, "just set it and forget it") they got golden brown and a little crusty while the lemon rolled around inside dripping the lemon juice. it was so moist and tastey. served with mashed sweet potatoes and a glass of wine.

a super easy recipe and the house smells wonderful while it's roasting! Combined all ingredients of seasonings + lemon juice + olive oil in bowl (used herbes de provence and Greek seasoning instead of Italian) and rubbed mixture inside chicken as well as under skin and over skin. Also rubbed inside w/ butter and inserted pats under skin. Stuffed w/ garlic cloves, lemon halves, fresh rosemary and oregano. Turned out great! BF ate half the chicken himself

Delicious! Made this last night for my family and we all agree that the flavor was sensational!  We don't eat much red meat so we have chicken several times a week, I try to  be innovative, I make at least two or more new recipes per week. Believe me when I say this was a lovely treat for us, and so easy! (I didn't even tress the chicken.) Will make again and again. I always try to follow the recipes that I get from this site exactly before I make any changes. I can't stand it when people write negative reviews when they didn't make the recipe they are reviewing.  I did have to make one change in my first attempt at this recipe in order to prevent burning. About twenty minutes into the cook time, the first time I went to bast, I didn't have any juices to bast with so I had to add 2 cups of chicken stock to the bottom of my roasting pan, about 40 minutes in I loosely covered it with foil when I noticed the juices were drying up again. I was worried that it would burn, but it was perfect.  I paired this recipe with simple steamed green beans and Gourmet Mushroom Risotto (recipe I also got on this site, you have to make it with this chicken) it was a perfect Sunday dinner. If you are a beginning cook looking for a great meal with a recipe that you can follow exactly. Make this along with the risotto, you can not fail! Plus I got an added bonus, two meals in one...with the left over chicken I made a delicious chicken salad. Thank you for the great recipe!

This turned out awesome!  I took other member reviews into consideration when making this and here are the changes I made:  cut up a whole onion and placed it inside the chicken, as well as one of the lemons after I used the juice, 4 cloves of fresh garlic.  I covered the chicken with a lid for about 1 1/2 hr of the cooking time, than took it off for the last 30 mins (it took 2 hours to cook the chicken) so the skin ended up crispy. I also rubbed the mixture under the skin and added dried rosemary to it as well before cooking.  I basted the chicken every 30 mins or so.  Had it with scalloped potatoes from this site as well, AMAZING dinner!  Thanks for the sweet sweet chicken recipe, I am making it again this Sunday!  :D

This was very good. I made this for my mom and dad and they both loved it. I followed the recommendations and mixed all of the ingredients together including the lemon juice and olive oil and rubbed it throughout the whole chicken including under the skin. Stuffed the cavity with quatered onions and lemon wedges. Covered with tin foil and basted every 30 minutes until it was done. Served with cranberry sauce. MMMMMM thank you for this recipe.

This came out so tasty and fragrant!  I rubbed the spices under the skin and added sprigs of fresh rosemary under the skin and in the cavity.  After cutting the lemon in half but before squeezing the juice, I sliced four super-thin lemon slices and added those under the skin.  The lemon/olive oil juice was rubbed all over, under the skin and in the cavity.  Juiced lemons went in the cavity.  Superb!

Big hit with family and friends. I recommend marinating over night with spices only and adding lemon and oil mixture just before cooking.

Beyond moist, juicy, and tender... My boyfriend picked up the chicken leg to take a bite and the meat all just fell off the bone. I was looking for more flavor throughout the chicken though it definitely did taste great. My boyfriend also raved nonstop about how amazing the skin was! So all in all, a successful first attempt at roasting a chicken.

I was curious about the combination of seasonings, but since a whole roasted chicken is too much food for just two of us, I marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts in all of the listed seasonings, along with the juice of one lemon (and its zest for a more intense lemon flavor), & a touch of olive oil and grilled them!  The flavor was very nice and this will be a good quick dish for us again in the future.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Barbara.

Quick, economical and tasty.  Next time I'll double the spices for a 4.5 lb. bird.  I substituted lemon juice for the lemons, and doubled it - making it 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup olive oil.  I poured some over the chicken before putting it in the oven, and basted the bird periodically with the rest as it cooked.  In the end, I did as another reviewer suggested and whisked some flour into the pan drippings making a nice lemony-herb gravy - which we served over some simple white rice.  A nice meal, my family gave it 5 forks! :)

Absolutely Wonderful! What I did differently was to put it in a brine (found on this site) 24 hours before preparing it.  I also put the olive/lemon mixture on the outside before putting on the seasonings.  I used a bird twice the size so I doubled most of the ingredients except the olive oil.  I used 1 extra teaspoon instead of 2.  I always invite my niece and hcr children, and my nephew for dinner on Sunday's and they really loved it.  Since my niece only has a three year old and a 2 month old, she will use a Roaster instead of a Turkey for Thanksgiving this year and use this recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Fabulous, juicy chicken. I add the olive oil to the herbs so they stick better. Also, stuff the lemon halves & a couple rosemary sprigs into the cavity. Like other users said - cook breast side down until the last half hour. So juicy!

Always fabulous!  I have made this a number of times and it always comes out great.  I actually brine my chicken the night before roasting using the Basic Brine recipe on this site.  I make sure to rub the oil/lemon mixture under skin and then I throw the lemon pieces in the cavity to give the chicken a little extra flavor.  I roast it breast side down until the last 30 minutes, then flip right side up to crisp the skin.  I usually have to make two chickens so I can have leftovers for salads and sandwiches!

No matter what I do to my chicken, it always comes out moist because I roast it breast side down. I loved the seasonings Barbara (never would of thought of dry mustard) and I thank you submitting this recipe!

I thought this was a pretty amazing recipe!  This was my first experience cooking a whole chicken.  The seasoning is delicious!  The only thing I will do different next time is to let it cook awhile before I re-baste it, to let the spices "crust" on the chicken so they don't wash off (if that made sense).

I made this last night and will DEFINATELY make it again.  Beautiful!  After cooking I had to drain off a lot of fat (the oil) , but the gravy was fantastic - wonderfully different lemon flavor!  I would most certainly recommend this recipe.  One substitution: used 6T of lemon juice instead of lemons.  One suggestion: ignore recommended cooking time in the actual recipe and follow what it says up top under 'Prep Time' and 'Cooking Time'.

very good...  very tasty...  definitely needed to cook for more than 30-45 minutes though.  I cooked it for 1hr 15minutes and turned it up to 350 the last 30 minutes (it was getting hot in the kitchen...)
thanks!

I love this chicken! I made it today for dinner and for lunch! I followed the recipe  written, however, I used chicken breasts. I had to use an instant thermometer to make sure the chicken breasts baked correctly. The only changes I made were that I only used 1 very large lemon, canola oil and added 1 teaspoon onion powder. I basted chicken every 30 minutes and tented with foil when it came out of the oven. The chicken was tender, juicy and so delicious. LOVE IT!

It's the closest to how I want mine done except that I use fresh ingredients like real garlic, fresh thyme and parsley. I add potatoes an hour before the chicken cooks so this becomes a full meal with salad served on the side.

Delicious! I actually used fresh rosemary and thyme on the inside of the chicken and next time I'll swap olive oil for canola oil because the olive oil tends to burn easily.

I used a garlic oil which I make with roasted garlic 1 tbsp & 1tbsp of butter mix in the seasonings and add the lemon,which I slice into thin slices.Place this into your roasting pan and refridgerate til it gets firm.Then I slide the coated lemon slices under the skin.Add some lemon ,garlic and onions in the cavity Roast as usual, there is always enough of the butter oil on the bottem of pan to rub on the skin if desired(we don't usually eat the skin).Thyme and cayenne added to the seasonings add wonderful flavor as well.My chicken was almost 7 lbs (a big bird) so cooking time was extended.Very good recipe.

Really juicy.  Really flavorful.  Way too sour.  It definitely does good on the lemon flavor, but it does almost too good.  It was sour enough to be almost inedible.  My husband suggested marinating next time; I am wary that will make it worse.  Probably won't make again.

Tried this recipe and absolutely love it!  I used 4 tsps. of Italian seasoning, 1 tsp. of mustard powder, 2 tsps. of garlic powder, 2 sprigs of fresh Rosemary inside the chicken, and 6 cloves of sliced fresh garlic placed inside the cavity and around the chicken.  Chopped fresh Rosemary sprinkled on the outside.  Great recipe!  Everyone that I've served it to loves it!  Thanks you!

This is one of the best chicken dishes I think I've ever had. Absolutely perfect as is... juicy, flavorful, I can't get enough. The juices make an excellent pan-dripping gravy and this goes really well with roasted red potatoes. Just pour the juice over them!



Edit: I've moved to bigger chickens (~5lbs) since 3 lbs isn't much food for 2 people. The cooking time for this recipe would then be off. I now cook at 425 for 10 minutes and turn the heat down to 350 and cook for 20 minutes per lb. Great crispy skin, JUICY and delicious meat underneath. Brining the chicken has great results as well if you have the extra time. Happy cooking!

Attempting this with a monster, 7.5 lb Purdue Oven Stuffer Roaster! Reporting, real-time as it cooks.
I doubled everything, but I couldn't fit all 4 spent lemons & a softball-size onion in its cavity! Apparently a 2.5 sized bird didn't get me a 2.5 size cavity! (Managed 12 cloves of garlic, though... priorities!) Combined wet & dry ingredients (had no seasoned salt - subbed w/poultry seasoning & salt) & rubbed inside, under skin & outside. Tented, breast-down, on a rack, in my turkey pan over 1c water & 1c Chardonnay, @ 350, for 1 hour, no basting.
Flipped it to breast-up @ 1 hour, removed tent & basted with oil/juice/rub mix & threw 2 lbs of red potatoes & the onions that wouldn't fit inside, in bottom of pan.  Kitchen smells amazing... the kitty's going nutz! (Me too!)
Basted with oil/juice/rub mix @ 30 min intervals for remaining 90 min. The kitty is losing her mind (as are the Mrs & I)!
Do I trust the pop-up? Yup!
Out, tented & resting. Mrs is doing frozen Italian green beans, in MW as a side.
YUM! Will make again... with a smaller bird!

This is a keeper recipe.  Made as directed except only had chicken breasts, not the whole chicken.  Loosely covered in foil, for 30 minutes, basted and turned down oven to 300 until rest of dinner was done (15 minutes or so).  Husband and son loved the lemon flavor, the oil helped it not to dry out.  I added about 1 Tblspn of Tarragon vinegar to lemon juice & oil, gave it a little depth.  Will definitely serve again, good enough for company.

Since there only two of us, I followed one reviewers advice and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, coated the chicken with the oil and herbs and cooked for 30 minutes. I would use a whole chicken for a family dinner. We moved this chicken to the top of our list. We both love lemon chicken and this was delish!

The spice mixture lemon & oil is a good blend of flavors. To infuse the flavor into the chicken, I ground the spices in an old coffee grinder I keep for grinding/ blending spices. I then mixed them with the oil & lemon and used an injector to inject into the meat and under the skin. I also rubbed the skin with the mixture and paprika. Paprika gives a nice color to the skin. Chicken was oozing with flavor and moist.

I too brined my chicken before and added onion and garlic cloves to the cavity before roasting.  I use several herbs to season and add flavor.  The chicken was great.

OMG!  I tried this recipe last night, and it was a total hit with my guests!  I ended up getting 5 bone-in breasts, and I doubled the amount of rub.  I soaked the breasts with the lemon and oil for about 15 minutes before rubbing, and then rubbed the chicken all over.  The cook time was more like 45 minutes in the oven.  Overall, it was a great recipe...super easy and AMAZING!  I even got an applause at the end of dinner.  I served with a greek salad and angel hair pasta with pesto.

This was such a nice variation from the common lemon rosemary chicken I typically see recipes for. The only change I made was cooking in the crockpot rather than my oven. It was so tender and seasoned perfectly. I will make this again.

I REALLY LIKED THIS CHICKEN DISH, PUT SOM HERBS UNDER THE SKIN AND SOME LEMON CUT IN FOURTHS AND PUT INTO THE CAVITY, COOKED IT ON A RACK AS TO CRISP ALL OF THE CHICKEN SKIN, ONE REVIEW SAID THAT THEY PIT THE CHICKEN IN UPSIDE DOWN INTO BROTH, THAT SOUDS LIKE THE SKIN WOULD BE RUBBERY, OR SLIMY, ANOTHER COOK, JASON24 SAID HE COOKED IT AT 325 AND WAS PINK, JASON24 COOK AT 350 AND IT WILL BE DONE AS LONG AS IT IS AT LEAT A 3 LB BIRD. ILL MAKE AGAIN SOON, THE FOUR STAR IS BECAUSE I MADE MY OWN CHANGES, TO MY TASTE AND FOR ME IT IS A FIVE STAR, BUT USE WHAT YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR OWN 5 STAR!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellent, the only change I made was that I made it in the crockpot on low and let it cook for 7 hours. I also put green beans in with it and added a bit more garlic to make lemon garlic green beans. It turned out wonderful!!!!

Left it in for 1.5hr first at 350Âº and it only reached 130Âº inside. Put it back in for 30min at 375Âº and it worked. Everything was very juicy but the carrots were a little dry and tough. The chicken went great with the wife's mushroom and spinach side.

This was very tasty! The herbs were great. I didn't get much of a lemon flavor though, and I was looking forward to it. Maybe cutting up a third lemon and putting it in the chicken? I will try that next time.

A wonderful tasting and easy to bake chicken.  I followed the directions but tweeked a few things.  I used garlic infused olive oil and mixed all spices with the oil and lemon juice as others suggested.   I also followed suggestions and stuffed with lemon rind, onion quarters and garlic.   Very moist and flavorful

Fixed this for the family last night and they loved it. I did add the oil/lemon mixture to the bird first and then put on the seasonings.  I had a 5lb chicken so took a little longer to cook.  I also put potatoes and carrots in the pan and cooked it all together. Everyone had seconds and cleaned their plates. Will be fixing this again.

I had never baked a whole chicken before and this recipe is GREAT!  Easy to follow and tastes wonderful.  The flavor allows you to use the leftovers in other dishes like chicken salad or chicken with biscuits and gravy.  I used far less lemon because I am not as big a lemon fan for chicken and it was still wonderful.  I cooked my five pound chicken in a roasting pan at 400 degrees F and covered in foil for an hour and a half and then removed the foil and baked 10 minutes to make the skin golden brown.  Worked great.

I love how zesty and juicy this came out. I used the recipe on boneless breast instead, but I will definately be making it with whole chickens when I have a bigger crowd to feed.

Very Very good! I hesitated using both lemons, but I am so glad that I did. It was just right. I peeled the spent lemon away from the rind and put it inside the bird.  I made more rub than instructed, like I said I had a very large bird.  great recipe/ definitely will make it again, and again...I may never use my crock pot again for a whole bird.  roast and enjoy

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  I make this at least 1x/month for my family and they eat it up.  Have made it when friends come over for dinner and the wives ALWAYS ask for the recipe.  Very easy to make, but no one will believe how little effort it takes!

Great recipe.  I used a 5 pound chicken and cooked sligtly longer (I believe it was 2 and a half hours).  I covered most of the time per suggestion of another user, and then let it brown.  I used the leftovers and shredded it up to make chicken tacos the next night.  It really added a nice flavor without being too overpowering.  I would definitely use this one again.

We picked up a couple of whole chickens at 49 cents per pound just this past week.  Was looking for something to use several lemons I had on hand that were close to being tossed.  This recipe fit the need.  This was absolutely the moistest, tastiest whole chicken I have ever cooked in my 36 years plus of marriage.  I did make a few adaptations.  Using a baking pan with a rack, I cooked up 2 cups of chicken broth (using "Better than Bouillon" brand) and poured that into the bottom of the pan.  Added the spices with poultry seasoning and some minced garlic inside the cavity of the bird along with the leftover lemons.  Used the same seasoning and rubbed it on the skin and directly on the bird, under the skin.  Since this was a 5 lb roasted chicken, I baked it at 350 degrees for about 2 hours.  Basted the bird every 30 minutes.  We didn't want gravy, but those drippings would have made a luscious gravy.  However, we couldn't let the juices go to waste, so used the leftover drippings to pour over our chicken.  This was so very easy to make and so yummy, this will be a regular at our house.  Thanks so much, barbzal for sharing this delicious recipe.

This was a really good base-recipe.  I used all the same seasoning as suggested.  I, however, put mine in the slow cooker all day.  Also, instead of lemons, I stuffed my chix w/unpeeled-garlic cloves.  I also added white wine in the slow cooker and made a gravy from the drippings/wine after it cooked all day.  Yummmm

When I made this, I was looking for leftovers for other recipes, too.  While we were not disappointed, we were not wowed, either.  It was just OK for us.

This is a delicious recipe, however I increased the seasonings by 1/2 which I'm glad I did. I also substituted boneless breasts, mixed all the ingredients together, pierced the breasts and placed in freezer bag to coat. Next time I will let this marinate for a few hours or overnight for more flavor. This was a definite hit, thanks for the recipe!

Holy moly, this is probably some of the best chicken I have ever had. And it's really easy to make! Be sure to use fresh garlic, stuff the inside with a few cloves and lemon wedges, and cover the pan in tin foil. Delicious.

Very tasty!  I rubbed some of the seasoning under the skin for extra flavor.  Added lemon pepper seasoning, extra garlic powder, & pepper.  Baked at 325 for 2 hours.  Roasted baby potatoes in pan with chicken...they had great flavor!

This turned out great, although I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't have any lemon juice so I sprinkled lemon pepper all over the chicken, sprayed olive oil over the top and then added 1. cup of chicken broth at the bottom on the roasting pan (make the chicken so much more moist than without). I will definitely make this more often, even trying as written when I get some lemon juice!

GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!  I put most of the seasonings under the skin and then a little around the outside and in the cavity.  I also cooked it upside down and turned it over the last 30 minutes of cooking.  Threw in the butter potatoes (that's the brand from costco that tastes like they have butter on them, but don't) inside the roasting pan and everything came out PERFECT!

The addition of the dry mustard to otherwise 'normal' roasting seasonings resulted in one tasty cluck.  I stuffed the cavity with the spent lemons (why waste a good thing??) so the lemon flavor was more prominent.  Very flavorful indeed.  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  I only added one tbsp. of olive oil, rather than two.  Next time, I don't think I'll add any oil, but I might add more lemon juice.  I might also cover it for part of the cooking time.  The liquid in the pad seemed to absorb to quickly and I ended up adding water several times.  Will definitely make again.

Oh my goshâ€¦this simply beats any store bought roasted chicken!!!  This was the first time I have tried to roast a whole chicken, and it was so much easier than I thought it would be!  I stuffed the squeezed lemon, and a the chopped up onion, and some fresh thyme into the cavity of the chicken, and the flavor was just wonderful!

This was a GREAT recipe.  Our family really loved the flavor and how tender it turned out.  I put the seasonings on after the lemon/oil mixture instead of before as directed, and let it roast for a while before basting.  That really sealed in the flavors and made the skin nice and crispy.

Very good.  Very easy.  After squeezing the fresh lemons, I stuffed the remaining peels into the cavity of the chicken.  Used the carcass and giblets/neck to make a wonderful chicken broth.

The chicken was moist and aromatic but I was not a huge fan of the flavor. It seemed to be laking "something."  I followed the recipe to a T but added fresh Rosemary and fresh Thyme to the rub. I also stuffed the bird with the lemon halves and some fresh herbs.  Overall it was good but not great.

Not bad. I was trying to "copycat" the grocery store rotisserie chicken we love, so I may have had different expectations. I didn't care for the mustard flavor, and if I make it again I will omit it. Also my 3.5 lb. chicken took a little over two hours to cook at this temperature, and the skin didn't brown at all. It was a good meal but I found myself wishing I'd bought the grocery store chicken.

Definitely a keeper. I rubbed the herbs on the outside and inside of the chicken and under the skin. Also, because I didn't have lemons on hand, I used six tablespoons of bottled lemon juice as one other reviewer suggested. It turned out great and it would have either way. This is just a wonderful recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was delicious!  Here's a tip-if you want to make gravy with this add some water to the pan toward the end of cooking.  Then when it is finished add more lemon juice with chicken broth or maybe some white wine for more liquid and then thicken with flour/water. Just great!

I put onions and potatoes in the roasting pan with the
chicken, and the juices from the chicken permeate

My favorite weeknight dinner. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts, subbed season salt with sea salt. Omitted mustard powder-didnâ€™t have any. Added onion powder, sliced onion and fresh garlic cloves. Baked at 350 for 1 hour.

Excellent, I did however add a few more ingredients. I added lemon pepper seasoning, and some fresh thyme and rosemary. I used chicken breast instead and cut them in half for ease of time. The dish came out fabulous

I used chicken breasts simply because I cook for one person. I will certainly make the whole chicken for more people. I appreciated the reviewers who used chicken breasts as an alternative, that helped a lot. My boyfriend really loves this chicken and it was awesome with roasted veggies. Thank you for the recipe.

This is delicious. Only thing I do differently is start out with a 450 degree oven and roast it in a cast iron skillet. Periodically I  baste and add a little white white wine to the skillet. This makes for an amazing sauce to spoon over chicken. ( Chicken will also cook more quickly)

Great recipe! I can't imagine how anyone thought it was bland. I thought it almost five stars but not quite, so went with four. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Wonderful! Definitely the moistest chicken I have ever made.... I did make a little change based on reviews (I know, I hate when people do that!) BUT I cooked in a roasting pain with rack, cooked at 400 for 10 min then for 20 min per pound at 350. It was PERFECT!

This recipe was just great. I tried it many times on pieces as well as the whole bird. But i prefer leg pieces. I like to add a little more ingredients to make more seasoning mix. I season it over night and bake about 1 1/2 hours. Fall of the bone delicious

This was very tasty.  I used finely chopped fresh basil and ginger with the olive oil and lemon juice and rubbed under and on top of the skin and stuffed the rinds inside the cavity.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe . I used 2 cornish hens because they were in my freezer & needed to be cooked . I mixed the oil , juice of 1 lemon , Italian herbs, garlic powder ,onion flakes , salt & pepper and a little honey dijon mustard, because thats what I had on hand , together  to get them more evenly over the chickens.It was nice and juicey & tender .Think I will try this mix on chicken breast on the BBQ next summer .

We had bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts. Made it very close to the original recipe, but didn't make exact measurements.  We both LOVED it! Delicious and on our Make Again List for sure. Made it with 1/2 butter & 1/2 EVOO because we love the crispness butter imparts.

Kids and husband LOVED this.  I actually cooked it longer on a lower temp (to accommodate a hectic soccer schedule) , and it turned out great!  I stuck to the 3 LB bird, but I think next time I will  need a bigger one (or 2)!  Home Run in my house!

Good seasoning blend but not sure if I would go through the trouble of the lemons - lemon pepper seasoning does the same.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I added rosemary to the herb mix. But that's just my preference, I'm sure it's lovely without. I'll definitely be adding this to my holiday dinner menu! By the way, I roasted my chicken breast down and it was tender and juicy.

This was a moist and superb tasting roast chicken. Next time I will use more lemon juice and try putting it into the cavity as some had suggested for a more intense flavor but all in all it came out great! I will definitely bake this again and again. BTW my husband loved it!

I did everything the same as Ellie May (9/17/11-review) except rather that the 6lb roasting chicken I used a lamb roast and added mint jelly when I basted it.  All done with tongue-in-cheek. Puh-leeze!!!

Fantastic! I no longer eat the skin either, but my dog gave the skin a paws up! Jason, it's 350F, not 325. Personally, if your oven is correct, it should be done in 1 1/2 rs. Especially, if it is only 3 lbs. these days, the only 3 lb. chickens I have seen, are those ones that the store sells already cooked. Foster Farms has very nice plump chickens. Thanks for the recipe. I need to try the marinating in a bag trick. Sounds like it would be more moist.

This is a great recipe, not my favorite mind you but a good one to mix in and occasionally so we aren't always using the same roasted chicken recipe. We used a 6lb chicken so all I did was set the oven to 375 and kept everything else the same. The seasoning with the lemon was nice, we put our used lemons inside the chicken as we always put a lemon or 2 in all our chicken and turkeys when we bake them, and everyone liked it...especially the gravy made from the lemony seasoned juices!

It came out very bland for us, even doubling all of the spices. I think I will stick to my original roast chicken recipe.

I love this recipe. I did make an adjustment to the temperature and time. I cooked the chicken uncovered for 2 hours at 325 degrees. I also put a half of onion in the cavity of the chicken, added great flavor.

I did use boneless skinless chicken breast, other than that I made no changes. Cooked for 35 minutes at 350 degrees. These were perfect as is. I might add more lemon next time, but were great.  I just loved the lemony taste.

Reading a few reviews I used this recipe for chicken breasts in a crock pot â€“ the liquid was WONDERFUL â€“ used it on rice. Next time Iâ€™ll double the spices and lemon juice for more â€˜sauceâ€™ to flavor more rice. My husband loved this recipe!

i ended up using 2 lbs of breast meat and doubled the pepper.. was too warm out so i used my george foreman.. i was worried about it having very little salt and me & bf dont like salty foods.. but i should have doubled the salt too.. i was thinking about sauteeing it and it probably would have helped or maybe if i would have marinated it.. bf liked it more than i did.. but we still finished off the lb btwn us two.. ~~UPDATE.. this came out so much better using a whole chicken than with those breasts the first time i tried this recipe.. nearly tripled the seasoning salt and used all of KATESTROFE's suggestions.. bf made this and did a great job.. we cut up some potatoes and lined them underneath the chicken on the bottom of the baking dish.. served with some steamed green beans.. so yummy.. i'm so glad i decided to try this again

Both my hubs and I enjoyed this but weren't as impressed as I hoped we'd be. While the meat itself was REALLY good, the sauce was WAY too lemon-y. My husband commented that the gravy I prepared from the pan drippings was incredibly tart and overpowering. Even an entire can of chicken broth did NOTHING to cut the lemon flavor. :( Since we both enjoyed the chicken itself, I think I'll attempt this again, but will be sure to cut the lemon in HALF! I will also rub my bird with the spice blend the night prior so that it has time to really soak in. NOTE #1: If you are not a fan of skin (like me), be SURE to also rub the spice mixture UNDER the skin! It makes a HUGE difference (I think the meat itself would have been terribly bland had I not done this). NOTE #2: You can add a quartered onion, several crushed garlic cloves (HIGHLY recommended) and / or a couple reserved lemon halves to the cavity of your bird for additional flavor. As an added bonus, the roasted garlic can be gently mashed and added to your gravy (if you choose to make one). Served with mashed potatoes, green beans and dinner rolls, this was an effortless, comforting meal - just go easy on the lemon lol! Thanks for sharing, barbzal! :-)

This recipe is delicious!  I made it for a dinner with a friend and it is very tasty.  The skin with all the seasonings is delicious and the chicken itself was very moist.  The only thing I didn't like is that most of the chicken didn't really have seasoning on it so was flavorless except for chicken flavor.  If you make this recipe, be sure to not expect the whole chicken to be flavorful.

This was wonderful.  Used boneless chicken breasts instead of whole chicken, put chicken in dish, squeezed lemon juice over, added olive oil then mixture of herbs, baked 375 for about 50 minutes, juicy and delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe!  Everyone complimented on the chicken.  My only thought is to increase the amount of seasoning for future versions.  I enjoy a more densely flavored chicken.

Moist, flavorful and best of all easy. I would not change any ingredients. I did rub the herbs under the skin as well as on top for even more flavor. I did cover mine losely with foil for half the cooking time,
( I hate the grease spatters), and increased the heat
for the remainder, so the skin was crispy and nicely browned. Next time I'll do parts of the chicken. Thank You for Sharing

The chicken came out yummy and all juicy. I rubbed the whole chicken inside out with some margarine then I put the spices and the sauce. it made it really juicy. It's the first time we don't fight over the legs leaving the dry breast because as my husband said:" It feels like there is no more juice and dry parts it's all one big yummy juicy chicken". So glad I tried it

IT WAS GOOD BUT NOT AS TASTY AS I WAS HOPING. I THINK THE SPICE MIXTURE WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SKIN OR ADDED AFTER THE OIL LEMON MIXTURE.

Excellent flavor, although it is tricky to keep the spices on the chicken when drizzling the oil/juice combination.  Otherwise, the flavors come together very nicely for a juicy baked chicken.

This has been a HUGE hit at several dinner parties!  I've tried several roast chicken recipes and this is definitely my favorite.  After squeezing the lemon juice, I put the halved lemons inside the chicken along with a whole garlic bulb cut in half.  It adds even more flavor to the chicken.  I usually roast a 5 lb chicken and it serves 6 at most.

This recipe was easy to follow.As lemony is not my flavour I went for a little spicy. I added chopped 1 large scotch Bonnet peppers and 5 cloves garlic > I rubbed this over the chicken and stuffed a little under the skin before adding powdered seasonings> I also stuffed the cavity of the chicken wth a small amt (1 tbl spoon) in the chicken wth 3 sprigs of thyme.Its important to brush off any of the chopped pepper and garlic that may adhere to teh chicken as this will burn.

VERY GOOD!  Had a VERY lemony taste to it, though.  I think next time, I may omit the lemons inside the chicken and just baste it with the marinade.  That should be enough to get the "lemon" point of the recipe.

Yum! This turned out really well. I roasted 2 4lb chickens, so mine took a little longer to cook. I threw the lemon peels inside the chicken after squeezing them for the oil, otherwise made exactly as written. Nice! Thanks for the recipe!!

Oh. My. Gosh. Made this tonite. My husband and I didn't even sit down to eat, we just stood by the stove and devoured most of the bird in about 5 minutes. I used a 4 pound chicken - took about 2 hours to cook. Added some garlic cloves, chopped white onion and half a lemon to the cavity, about a half cup of water to the pan, and lots of little butter pats to the top of the chicken. The top was so crusty and delicious. Totally making this again.

This recipe is great! I just mixed all the spices with the lemon juice and  olive oil and rubbed the whole chicken inside and out. I wrapped it in foil for about 3/4 of the way and then uncovered it to brown. The results were a flavorful and juicy chicken that my whole family loved.

The recipes was very good and easy.  I didn't realize I didn't have seasoned salt until I started getting the seasoning together so just used some regular salt & paprika.  I will definitely be making again & making sure I have seasoned salt.

I was pretty nervous about making this for Mr. "Not Real Big On Lemon" - but I threw caution to the wind, and put it together.  Only changes were: Adding a kiss of rosemary, and stuffing the cavity with lemons and onions.  The first hour was spent covered in foil, and basted every thirty minutes.  Moist, flavorful and wouldn't you know?  The chicken was literally picked clean.

WOW! I've been searching for a easy and delicous way to cook whole chicken and my search ends here! This was excellent, it uses ingredients I already have in the house, no chopping and no hard to follow cooking instructions. Great recipe I will make this again!

Really easy to put together with items on hand in the kitchen and very flavorful.  I used more lemon to suite my taste.  I used the left over chicken to make chicken pot pie the next day.

Delish!  Really nice clean fresh flavors.  To cut down on all the basting cover with alum foil the first 45 min of roasting.  Then continue Roasting uncovered another 45 min.

Perfect! - I was looking for a new roast chicken recipe, having abandoned my Delia Smith version, and this was an instant hit. I zested the lemons before juicing them, and added the zest to the herbs & juice and oil, and rubbed everything on together.  Also stuffed the chicken with the leftover lemon-rind pieces. Added a bit of sherry to the liquid in the bottom of the pan. Cooked it in a covered roasting pan for 20 mins/lb at 375, then 15-20mins at 425 to brown.  Served it with Onion Roasted Sweet Potatoes also off this site.

I think this recipe is foolproof.  I had never cooked a whole chicken before, so I was a little nervous about trying it.  It turned out great!  It was very flavorful and moist throughout.  My fiance loved it and he kept raving about it the whole time we were eating.  I used a 5 lb. chicken so it took a little over 2 hours to cook.  Also I brined the chicken for about an hour before cooking.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe.  The only thing I had problems with was the cooking time.  I left it in a little longer than directed, but still had spots close to the bone that weren't done.  Other than that, this was a wonderful trade off to normal chicken dishes.

This was good but slightly too lemon-y for me. That was probably my fault. I sliced lemon(very thinly)  & put under the skin of the chicken before cooking. I also chopped about 5 medium size red skin potatoes & put around the chicken before roasting. The potatoes absorbed the flavors from the chicken, lemon & spices. I will probably make this again.

I never made this type of chicken before, so this one was new for me. I made the chicken exactly as written and it came out perfect. I didn't know what to make on the side so I threw some butter tasten biscuits in the oven and used "Cream of soup base" by Nell Marsh from this sight allrecipes.com. I added some of the broth from under the chicken and added some cooked california blend frozen vegetables in the cream of soup base. It was excellent and my boys (husband and three sons) gave me Great reviews. It tasted just like Chicken and Dumplings. This one is going into the recipe box for sure. Thank you for sharing..

This chicken is very good. I used an oven stuffer roaster with a pop-up timer, which makes it so easy. I put the squeezed lemon halves inside the bird to add more flavor. This is a great way to prepare a whole chicken.

This is the first and only roasted chicken recipe that I have ever made, and it was fantastic. I follow the recipe exactly, and it turns out great every time--my husband and I love the flavor!  I try to make this when I have time to brine the chicken for 2-5 hours beforehand (using the instructions on this Web site), because I find that it turns out even juicier, but I have made it when I haven't had time to brine it, and it still turns out great.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

thought this was ok, tried it on a whole chicken, rubbed 1/3 of the marinade under the skin, and divided the rest into the cavity of the chicken and drizzled it over the skin.  didnt impart much flavour into the chicken itself though.  ps subbed garlic powder for minced garlic and also added half an onion into the chicken cavity whilst baking :)

I've made this numerous times, and it always turns out great.  It's a basic recipe that you can build on.  You can vary the spices to taste and it will still turn out great.  I always cut an onion in half and stuff it inside.  Not sure why...probably because that's the way my mom did it!

So delicious!  I had never made a whole roasted chicken before and I was so pleased with the ease of this recipe.  I did not have mustard powder, so used 1 Tablespoon of dijon mustard, mixed that with all the spices, then rubbed all over the chicken.  Stuffed the cavity with lemon, garlic cloves, and onion.  Baked the chicken in a pan with quarted potatoes, squash, and carrots.  The veggies took on the flavor of the chicken seasonings.  The meal was just great!  Will definately make more often.

It was okay.  Actually I made a gravy with the lemon/oil as suggested below & made rice--and I liked that the best, kind of reminded me of Lemon Rice Soup.  I may make again just to make the rice & lemon gravy!  Otherwise easy & tender chicken.

I am going to have to assume that anyone giving this 5 stars has yet to try the "roast sticky chicken-rotisserie style" also from this site.For me,this was just a reminder that chicken is chicken...cause it takes more than this to make it special.

I give this 4.5 stars.  It is very good, but not the best I've had.  I cooked it on convection roast at 325 for the first 45 minutes then I raised the temp to 375 for the last bit of cooking.

Good but not as good as 'Lemon Chicken III' it was a little to tangy and spicy for me and I think I chared the skin a little too much, but I liked it none the less.

This was perfect - I used lemon juice and more italian seasoning. I also added just a smidge of the red seasoning salt. I had no mustard powder so I whisked that and real garlic into the marinade. Smelled great cooking and tasted fantastic. The mister was cutting in up and trying pieces and said " I really like this!" This will now be my reicpe for roasting not just whole chickens but if I am doing bone-in chicken breasts. I can't to try it on the barbecue, where I would marinte the chicken with all the seasonings and lemon.

Tripled the amount of herbs to add for flavor. Out of curiousity I roasted the chicken "Beer Butt Style" with about 3/4 can of beer. It help keep the bird moist and added a hint of beer flavor to the meat.

I buy whole chickens all of the time mostly to cook and use in casseroles.  So this was my first venture into roasting with seasonings.  I grew up on bland food it is nice to have some flavor instead of being boring.  I used 1/4 cup bottled lemon juice and 1 TBS of Lemon pepper insted of juice of 2 lemons and kepted everything else the same.  Very Good.  Thanks for posting!

Really easy and delicious!  The cooking time is way off though.  You need to cook a 3 pound chicken for atleast 75 minutes - if you only cooked the chicken for 30 minutes like the recipe suggests, the chicken would still be clucking.

YUM!  This was so good!  And so much easier than I thought cooking a whole chicken could be, this was the first roast chicken I've ever done, and it won't be the last thanks to this recipe!  I had a 4lb chicken and cooked it about an hour and a half until my thermometer read 170.  I also stuffed the squeezed lemons into the chicken for flavor.  This was juicy and tasty, and leftovers went wonderfully in the "White Chili I" (by Dierdre Dee) recipe from this site.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!  Thank you, thank you Barbara!

I found the recipe took a bit longer to cook.  At about 375 degrees, a slightly over 3 lb chicken took more like 50 - 55 minutes to reach temperature, but the herbs were great and the chicken was very savory.

This chicken is such a hit even my 2 year old daughter loves it. It's part of our weekly menu. I also parboil a lemon and place it inside the chicken (a trick from Jamie Oliver). This infuses the lemon into the meat and keeps the chicken very moist. A bit of wine in the tray for basting also adds some flavour.

Big hit with the company. It did take longer to cook more like 2 hrs. I stuffed the chicken with the lemons and 4 cloves of garlic.

I used a 6 lb chicken and like another reviewer advised, I also rubbed the spices and lemon juice/olive oil under and on the skin. I slso used quartered potatoes and wrapped the whole thing in foil. It took about 2 1/2 hours to bake.
It was SO WORTH IT! This was the juiciest chicken ever!! Thanks for a great recipe.

Easy and wonderful.  I put the whole chicken in my 6-quart Nesco roaster and followed the recipe as given. I'll make this one again!

I made this.  My only complaint as of this moment, as I am waiting after I cooked it an additional 30 minutes and am resting it again for 15 minutes, and an praying it is still juicy and tasty.  I am furious that it was not cooked in the time the recipe called for.  All my sides are sitting getting COLD while I cook this chicken an additional 30 minutes and wait an additional 15 minutes.  AND, I USED A THERMOMATER AND IT REGISTERED 186 DEGREES ON THE THIGH SO ..... I CUT TO SEPARATE THE LEG AND IT WAS NOT DONE!!!!

Loved the lemon flavor. I cooked for total of 2 hours: 1.5 hrs in roaster with lid on, basting every 25ish mins. Took lid off for the last 30 minutes and it was golden brown and fall off the bone tender. Great Recipe. Wonderful flavor.

Nice flavor. I mixed all the spices with the lemon juice and olive oil. I shouldn't have listened to a reviewer who suggested roasting the chicken @ 450 for 20 minutes. The bottom of the pan turned black. Next time, I will follow the recipe as stated. I'll also add more salt, I found it a bit bland. Also, 90 minutes was not enough time. I had to leave it in for 20 more minutes. I added white wine and some chicken broth in the beginning to the blackened pan to give it some liquid. I'll update next time.

Tasty, juicy, baked a 5 lbs chicken for 2 1/2 hours and was  perfectly done.  I did tent it  in the last half hour.  Put onion, lemon and garlic in cavity, and basted only a couple of times.

I didn't have the exact spices so I used Herbs de Province, a bit of poultry seasoning and a bit of lemon pepper along with the ones listed.

I had a smaller chicken; I only needed one lemon.

I cut down the backbone and flattened my chicken to cook it faster- I had a nearly 6 pounder.  The oven temp was 425 degrees and it cooked in about an hour and 15 minutes.  It was SO delicious!!  I am making it again next week already and itâ€™s going to be my new go to for meal trains!

I made this recipe with my 8 year old son as part of his Cub Scout badge requirements. The entire  family ended up loving the recipe! We basted the chicken three times while it cooked and we covered it with aluminum foil for the first 45 minutes at 350.

I roasted 3 6+lb  roasting chickens. Like others I mixed the butter with the herbs and some of the lemon juice. Rubbed it all over the chicken and under the skin then put it back in the refrigerator overnight. Next morning I roasted it with the lemon skins and onion in the cavity. Took it to a luncheon with about 15 people mostly senior citizens and got rave reviews. Thank you for sharing.

This was my first time ever cooking a whole chicken. Followed the directions exactly, and it came out great. I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe stated, but that was the only variation. 

Next time I would actually probably season it a little more or brine it before hand to give a little more flavor.

It was good. My personal opinion  isn't for a very strong four star. Maybe if grilled rotisserie style. Family  didn't rave about it either. Sorry. Used all the left over chicken for fatitas the next day.

Ive tired the recipe and I liked the seasoning, but what I did was cut into the skin of the chicken and used my hands to season the meet properly, I don't like how they just places the seasoning on the top it should be well seasoned .just my preference and I also mixed all my ingredients because it doesn't make sense washing off the seasoning.

I made this with a 9 lb Perdue Oven Stuffer Roaster in my "OSTER 24 Pound Turkey Roaster Oven" crock-pot.   All I did differently is add a little water in bottom of pan.  The pan dripping were very flavorful (chicken, lemon, herbs) so I added some chicken bone broth about 45 minutes prior to it being done.  Because it made a lot of broth, I'm thinking of making a lemon chicken avocado soup.

Great recipe! I used regular salt because I didn't have season salt.  I used a broasting  pan and covered for the first hour. I sliced and seasoned potatoes (garlic powder, dry chopped onion, paprika, salt, and olive oil) and added them around the chicken for the second half of cooking. Uncovered and browned in end. So delicious!

It was VERY easy to prepare for my family.  I have a Myer Lemon tree in the backyard which helped to make this chicken dish even better!  I WILL be making this one again!  I placed the chicken on top of Herb Rice and a lettuce salad with gorgonzola cheese!  YUMMY!

Simple.  I actually placed it in a slower cooker at the lowest temperature.  It is a simple and great dinner.  The aroma while cooking is so nice!  Anyone can prepare this meal.  Prepare ahead at night, place it safely in the cooker.  Come home to dinner.  It looks pretty as the picture and smells grand.  Follow previous advice to add the juice first and spices after, simplify!  Yum!!!

We loved this recipe. Used boneless skinless chicken instead of a whole chicken. mixed the seasonings and liquids together and cover the chicken with it and let it bake. Will be doing this one again.

This was amazing!!!!!! My kids loved it, and they are hard to please. I roasted it with onions, potatoes, and carrots. I added olive oil and a pack of onion soup mix to the vegetable mixture for added flavor. I baked the chicken at 375 for 1.5 hrs, and it was perfect when it came out! Will definitely make this one again!

I rubbed the seasoning under the skin and cooked longer, monitoring the temperature of the chicken. I've made this a bunch of times and I can't get enough.

I love this recipe. The only thing I do differently is put the lemon skin into the cavity before popping it in the oven. Also, I found it took about 1/2 hour longer for my chicken to be done. They (2) in the pan may have been slightly more than 3 pounds.

A neighbor was picking lemons moments ago, so I can home to find a recipe like this. I had a fresh organic 5.25 lbs chicken  and wow! I am about to say this is might be the best way I've roasted a chicken. Unreal moist and great flavor with the herbs called for. Only change I did was the olive oil I used was infused with orange. Have to say I cook this one for the Queen!

I used chicken breasts and thighs. Did not have Italian seasoning.  Used thyme, basil, rosemary, dry mustard, and lemon pepper.  It  came out quite nice.

I made this as a low-salt recipe for my in-laws. I used less salt than recommended and it was outstanding! Also, I scrubbed the skin with the lemons and topped with oil. Very nice. Tonight, I spatchcocked the bird so it will cook faster.

Nice and easy recipe for cooking a whole bird. Set my oven to 400 for 90 minutes, and it was still nice and moist. It wasn't as lemony as I expected. Will have to try another way to make the lemon flavors "pop" a little more.

This chicken was fantastic! I added water to the pan as suggested in the magazine, and with the moisture, there's no way the chicken will dry out.  I even overcooked - left in for 2 hours - but it was SO good.

It was good, i like the seasoning mixture which i followed to a T. I drizzled with olive oil, but also pats of butter. Also added 3 garlic cloves to cavity along with the lemon halves.  Also cooked in crock pot instead of oven and it turned out great.

Made this the other night and it was delicious! We added a half cup of water to the bottom of the pan to help keep the chicken moist and covered it in tin foil the first 1 1/2 hours. We cooked this at 8,000ft so we did 375 degrees for around 2:15 hrs. We cut up potatoes and covered them in the same mixture and cooked them on the second rack for 1:15 stirring when we basted the chicken. Great meal! Meat just fell off the bone.

The chicken was so tender and juicy.  We quite liked it, although I felt it needed more seasoning.  Perhaps some additional salt.  I didn't have italian seasoning, so I made up my own mixture and I don't think I added enough salt.  I also failed to baste it as it roasted.  Also I used Meyer's Lemons, which are more mild. So next time I make it I will  follow the recipe a bit better.  I roasted it in a convection oven, which may have helped with the juiciness.

Yum! I did quarter my lemon and toss it in the cavity after squeezing out the juice. Otherwise as written. I only had time to baste once at the end. New family favorite.

Loved this simple way of making a chicken!!  Made 2 whole chickens at the same time so I doubled everything and also trussed the chicken legs for even cooking and for presentation.  Upped the oven temp. too to help with the cook time for 2.  Everything came out perfect and juicy.  :)

This one is a keeper. You can totally turn this into a real quick meal for crazy after school time frames. I didn't have a whole chicken so used 5 chicken breasts and just cooked it on the frying pan on the stovetop. I put the oil in the pan and warmed it up. Next I cut the breast up into strips while it was raw. I mixed the seasoning together and then tossed them with the breast in a gallon ziplock bag and dumped them into the pan. I Let it cook for a bit then turned the strips over and squeezed half a lemon onto the breasts. I kept turning the chicken and squeezing half a lemon onto the breasts till they were cooked. I used the two full lemons the recipe recommended. Quick and yummy. We'll be making this again.

I like the combination of these seasonings so I will definitely be making this again with some adjustments.  I did not use olive oil, I used chicken pieces instead and used 3/4 tsp lemon pepper seasoning (instead of lemon), and therefore, omitted the ground black pepper.  The Lawrys lemon pepper has lower sodium compared to most, but because it has some salt, I used lower sodium seasoned salt but felt I needed to lightly salt the chicken just in case there wasn't enough salt in the mixture.  I rubbed all seasonings onto the chicken, refrigerated overnight,  baked covered for an hour at 375, and uncovered for about 40 minutes.   The result:  even after overnight refrigeration,  it still needed salt and more lemon flavor.   Next time will use 2 tsps lemon pepper,  will use regular seasoned salt (instead of lower sodium and maybe even an extra 1/2 tsp), and will possibly add another 1/2 tsp garlic powder.

I loved this, but only with some changes.  I added a ton of garlic, and some fresh rosemary to the dressing.  I also included the lemon juice to the mix of things that I rubbed under the skin.  Additionally, I added a number of whole cloves of garlic and lemon slices inside the cavity of the chicken while it cooked.  For an additional meal I took the chicken carcass and the giblets and made a wonderful broth (in the slow cooker with some additional ingredients) and the leftover chicken, and made "Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup".  Both meals were great!

Very easy and very flavorful. Guests will be impressed when you serve this tasty chicken! I popped a couple of potatoes in with bird, so we had roasted potatoes as a side. I also steamed some wax and green beans and some carrots for a very colorful meal. Highly recommended!

I made this using a 5 lb. chicken (the recipe in the magazine said use 4 lb.) and pushing the seasoning a little.  I even had doubled the seasoned salt as you suggested and basted frequently.  Turned out totally bland and tasteless. Just wasn't enough seasoning.   I won't try it again.

This wasn't a bad roasted chicken, it just wasn't a great roasted chicken.  With all the prep of herbs and lemon juice and inside and out and....I guess I expected more.  The only change I made was to throw the empty lemon shells-after juicing-into the cavity before tying the legs together.  I normally use Ina Garten Perfect Roast Chicken-http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/perfect-roast-chicken-recipe.html.  I think I'll stop trying to change what works for me.

It was pretty good. I think it would have come out better had I allowed the chicken to marinate a little longer rather than to season it and stick it right in the oven. I also feel I should have put more of the seasoning under the skin as one other reviewer mentioned and I may have used a bit to much lemon.

My husband liked it more than I did. It was just okay. I really didn't taste any lemon flavor, even after following other review's suggestions: I baked the chicken at 325 for 2 hr 20 min, put the lemon rinds in the chicken, and doubled the herb mixture. Even then, all I could taste was the olive oil, and I didn't double that part. I just don't seem to like meat dishes that use olive oil. It makes it taste greasy. I think this is a good recipe, but I'm definitely considering substituting the olive oil for something else or cutting it out entirely.

My 14 year old nephew cooked his first family dinner tonight and this is the recipe he chose. We followed the recipe almost exactly, after we doubled the ingredients because we used a very large chicken. Our changes: after reading some reviews we mixed all the spices together in one bowl with French's mustard because I didn't have powdered mustard. We also used all fresh herbs from our garden including the garlic and put the squeezed lemon halves inside the chicken. He was very anxious over how it would turn out but he needn't have worried, IT WAS DELICIOUS!! Moist, flavorful, finger licking good! With white potatoes cut in half added in the last hour and buttered green beans it was a meal to be proud of and we are all very proud of him, almost as proud as he is himself. Really impressed his mom! She could not stop raving over the flavor and how tender it was. Now he's asking to make dinner tomorrow night as well so I came here to find a recipe and decided to write this review for him to encourage his interest. Keep up the good work Dante! It is an honorable pursuit to provide delicious, nutritious meals for your family and you are well on your way. How do you feel about shrimp??

It's a great recipe, and this BTW was my first time ever making roast chicken. The seasoning was the very best, I doubled the recipe for it and used it all. I was looking for something to work with what I had, and I did make a few changes. I had seen from reviews about the importance of crispy skin so because of that and the fact that I was using thighs instead of a whole chicken, I googled and found a Martha Stewart recipe to combine with this one. 

1.) I doubled the herb recipe and placed 1 T of it underneath the skin and rubbed the thighs down, the majority of the rest I rubbed the skins down with, and what was left I put it into the olive oil and lemon juice mix. I then placed them skin side down in the pan.
2.) I used 1/2 cup of olive oil and 1/4 lemon juice (next time I'll add a bit more juice, possibly to the equivalent of 2 lemons), and I poured it over the thighs
3.) Because my electric stove is nuts, I baked them uncovered on 325Â° for 15 minutes, basted them, then baked for 10 mins more, I flipped them over and basted them a little, then turned the heat up to 350Â° to try and get a crispy skin, and baked them for 10 mins more. I wasn't happy with the appearance, and I was worried that I didn't cook them long enough so I basted them and put them in for another 10 mins. Very brown crispy skin, and moist and tender.

Easy & tasty. I just threw all the ingredients in a bag with chicken thighs (decreased olive oil) marinated for a couple of hours & roasted in the oven. This will be my go to chicken marinade from now on. The mix of flavors is delicious.

Great flavour on the skin, didn't permeate through to the chicken as much as I would have thought. Will be great as a bone broth with what remains.

This is fabulous! Much better than the chickens you buy already roasted at the stores. I had a five lb. chicken and doubled the herbs (but didn't use them all) I only had one lemon, so I added the juice of half of an orange. I stuffed the chicken with the squeezed lemon and orange, and baked at 375 for two hours. The family raved.

This is a fair/good recipe. I wouldn't say that it it's 'great'.  Less flavor than what I ordinarily like. Definitely needed more cooking time.

The only thing that i noticed was when it says drizzle oil/lemon mixture over chicken it didn't say to save some for basting, oops. Also for the beginner cooks (like me) make sure you cover the chicken with foil or it burns!!

This was quite tasty, having to transport it and smell it the whole way was positively torture.  It was very easy and a great return on the time/effort.  Make sure you have bread as the drippings/sauce is delicious.

So delicious! This recipe is so simple to prepare and won't break the bank when you're on a budget once you have all the spices in your pantry =) I served this at a dinner party and it was a winner. 3 whole chickens picked to the bone (everyone had 2nd's and took some home) Will definitely be using the recipe again!

This was really good! It did take over an hour to cook, but I was prepared for that. I mixed all the spices with the oil and lemon juice and painted it on the chicken on top of and under the skin. I poured some inside and put what was left of the lemons and a few fresh crushed cloves of garlic in too. Really tasty, my boyfriend said it was the best roasted chicken he's ever had.

Instead of seasoning salt, I used lemon pepper. I also stuffed what I could of the juiced lemons into the cavity of the bird. I made no other changes. We really liked it. Next time, I think I might use butter instead of EVOO and add thyme. NOTE: I did use an organic chicken. I think that really made this recipe even better.

Great blend of spices. I used all the ingredients called for and put some potatoes, carrots, onions and a cup of chicken broth on the bottom of the pan. Then placed the chicken on top. Cooked the whole meal in one dish!

This was a great basic recipe for roast chicken. I baked the chicken on a bed of sliced onions and minced garlic, along with the olive oil/lemon juice blend. I bought a chicken already cut up and seasoned both sides with Italian seasonings, kosher salt and black pepper. Best roasted chicken I've made!

This was just alright.  Nothing spectacular.  The lemon was ok with the chicken, a little overpowering, but not bad.  I think I'll keep looking for that perfect roasted chicken recipe.

Really great recipe with a nice addition of lemon.  I mixed all the herbs, fresh squeezed lemon juice, and some olive oil (more than 2 tbsp) and drizzled over and in the chx.  Put 2 lemon halves inside and 2 in the pan...make sure to put water in the bottom of the pan.  Made a wonderful lemon herb gravy.  Will def. make this again!  Thx!

This was very easy - my first roasted chicken! I was so impressed with the recipe and how it turned out. I thought maybe it would be oily but it was very moist and the chicken melts in your mouth.

Very tasty.  I put this in the crockpot with a few onions, the rub on the chicken as listed in the recipe, but also put the lemons in the cavity.   Tasted wonderful and falling off the bone tender.   Used the leftovers in chicken soup!  Thank you!

i prepared this for dinner and was surprised how good it was.  i did make a few changes.  instead of seasoning salt i used lemon pepper seasoning. i did season the chicken and then the skin( I used a whole chicken). i also placed a whole lemon cut in half inside the chicken.  i then placed it in the crock pot for 5 hours on low.  i then separated the chicken from the broth it made and placed the chicken in a baking dish and placed in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.(your chicken will fall apart because it is sooooo tender, so be careful).  well i take the chicken out of the oven i then pour the juice back on the chicken.  yummy

The seasonings on this were FAB!!!!  The cooking time for my little bird was too long- when cooking an organic, locally raised, non-commercial bird, I think the cooking time should be MUCH less!  My bird was 3.5 lbs and 1.5 hours was WAY too long- the breast was nearly inedible.  I also will add some rosemary to this next time- the flavors seemed to lend themselves to some rosemary too!

This was good - but very herby.  The flavors are more fitting for an advanced taste pallete.  Everyone in my family said it tasted good, but that it was herby (can't find a better word).  Maybe I left too much on the chicken, not sure.  Either way, it was still good.  I didn't have a whole chicken, so I just seasoned chicken breasts and then baked them in the oven.

Absolutely delicious and very tasty!! I used a mixture of drumsticks and thighs instead of a whole chicken and they came out wonderfully flavorful and moist.   I didn't have mustard powder so I substituted onion powder and instead of real lemons, I used lemon juice so we didn't get an overpowering citrusy taste, just a delicate taste with lots of robust flavor. Definately a keeper!

Pretty good for my first roast chicken.  It had a very good lemon taste.  I stuffed the left over lemon in the cavity, plus some onions to give it more flavor.

My husband and daughter liked this very well, and it is easy to make. They really like gravy, and I found that about halfway through the cooking time the chicken had soaked up all the juices. So I heated a can of chicken broth in the microwave and poured it over the chicken. There was plenty of juice at the end to make a lovely gravy and the herbs and spices from the rub really enhanced the flavour. If you are going to do this, taste before adding any additional seasoning to the gravy, because you probably won't need it. Thanks!

My family loved this.  It tastes just like a rotisserie chicken.  I did not make any changes to the recipe, but did bake it in a small roasting pan with a cover instead of a 9x13 pan.  Fantastic!!!

Very juicy!  I didn't notice a lot of lemon flavour and I made a point of stuffing the cavity of the bird with the juiced lemons.  It was tasty nonetheless!

This was very good and so simple to make.  Loved the flavors.  I cooked mine in a roasting pan that had a wire rack, to allow the drippings and olive oil to run off, then used the juice to baste the chicken. I had a larger chicken than the recipe called for, about 6 lbs.,but did not double the recipe and the amount worked just fine.

Very tasty! Here are the things I did differently . . . 1. Used about 2 lbs. of bone-in thighs (they were on sale!). 2. Used the same amount of spices listed. Cut back the lemon juice to one lemon and 1 tbsp olive oil. 3. Rubbed the spice mixture underneath the top skin flap of my chicken thighs. Then sprinkled the rest of the mixture on top of them. 4. Drizzled the lemon/olive mixture underneath the skin as well as on top of the chicken. 5. Baked in a 8X8 pyrex dish with lemon skins, a few cloves of garlic, and onion slices. Next time I would nix the lemon skins -- my chicken was very citrus-y. 6. Baked at same temp listed in recipe until chicken was cooked through (prepare to keep them in the oven for awhile!)

It was ok - not flavourful enough for me. I think it would have been much better if marinated overnight (or at least for a few hours). Good basic recipe though! Thank you.

Very delicious.  The subtle flavor of the lemon went great with the zestier spices.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and rubbed the spices on one side and poured the lemon juice/oil over top and baked for 30 minutes.  Super easy and delicious!

Yum!  Instead of a whole chicken, I used 2 pounds chickens pieces.  I coated each piece with lots of herbs inside and outside the skin and used a little less oil.  Quick and delicious.

I used boneless chicken breasts. I poured the oil and lemon juice mixture over the chicken and sprinkled the seasoning mixture on each side of the chicken. I baked at 350 for 20 minutes (my chicken breasts were very thinly sliced). SO GOOD!

Excellent, and the chicken was VERY moist.  Instead of "Italian Seasoning" I mixed Orgeano, Basil & Thyme. It was great and my husband kept asking me what I used becuse it was so good and different, but yet not an "odd" taste.  Thanks for sharing...the mustard I think makes the difference!

Whole chickens were on sale for 77 cents a pound.  This was the recipe I chose to help me take advantage of a great deal, and wow, what a tasty lil chicken!  Followed it to the T.  Served this with scalloped potatoes (also from this site) and a spinach/strawberry salad.  Nice.

Great recipe!  I normally don't make a whole chicken, but the price was right.  I used previous reviewers' suggestions of combining everything and then putting it on the chicken.  I added fresh thyme because I had some on hand and it came out great.  Definitely will use this recipe again.

Amazing!  I also rubbed the spices under the skin, kept it covered w/ foil for the first half of roasting then took it off, skin was nicely browned and delicious.

Delicious!  The flavors are very nice and the lemon is not overpowering at all.  I even put lemon pepper on the chicken itself.  I used chicken breasts.  Kids liked it.

My DH who does NOT like chicken just asked for me to use the seasoning on the game hems that we're having tonight.  He was said that even the leftovers were still moist and flavorful.  Thank you for a recipe that we both like and that will help me get him away from beef!!!!

I cheated with this recipe since I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used lemon juice instead of 2 lemons, and I did not use mustard powder (didn't have on the shelf).  This was very easy and very GOOD!  My husband and I really enjoyed the juicy chicken.  I will definitely make it again!

This is a good spice mixture for chicken. I used the rapid roasting method (found on this site) instead of what was recommended in the recipe. Instead of seasoning salt I used lemon pepper seasoning. Overall, a good recipe.

Simple and delicious!  I used a combination of chicken breasts and legs, put them in a 13X9 inch pan, mixed up all the remaining ingredients and poured on top of the chicken.  I cooked this in the oven using my convection roast setting, basting periodically with the juices in the pan.  Everyone enjoyed -- Thanks for sharing!

The flavor and ease of this recipe gets all five stars, but the cook time needs to be a little longer.

this is very good chicken, but would like more flavor in the meat instead of on the skin. next time i will try to mix lemon juice and olive oil with the seasoning and inject into meat before baking.

My first attempt at a whole roasted chicken and it came out great.  Super easy and moist.  There was a lot of lemon flavor but I love lemon so it wasn't a problem.

A great recipe for summer - tasty and refreshing.  I had planned on doing a roast chicken supper but the weather was just too hot so I decided to cook the chicken in the morning and eat it cold.  I also wanted to add some flavour (no gravy etc for flavour) and this looked good and it tasted good!  I made as stated but I put the rub (mixed with some lemon juice) underneath the skin on the breasts as well as in the cavity and outside and I put the squeezed lemons inside the cavity along with one onion and some garlic cloves.  If you wanted to be ultra healthy you could forget the olive oil and just use the lemon juice.  Still produces a tasty bird!

This turned out great!  I had a whole cut up chicken so I used that, and I grated some lemon zest over it also.  The chicken came out very juicy.  Me, my husband and my 2 yr old all loved it!

Awesome flavor and it's super easy to do!  I followed the recipe to a T.  I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I might change is to rub some of the seasoning under the skin, like one of the other reviewers mentioned.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was very good.  I just used one lemon and left out the mustard powder because my husband doesn't it.  He really liked this, though.  It was easy to prepare and very tender and juicy. The skin got very crisp, too.  I'd likely make this again.

This recipe was delicious. I did not have fresh lemon so I used lemon juice. I think next time I will use fresh lemon cause I think it will probably add more of a lemon flavor. Overall, very big hit in my house. Will definitely make again.

I used a salt brine for two hours the night before.  Rinsed & dried the chicken and put all the spices on it & in it.  Then poured lemon juice mixture over it and left it in the fridge overnight.  I cooked it breast side down in a Pampered Chef stoneware pan with a bowl on top of it.  People at work loved it so much they asked for the recipe. I will make it again!

First time I have ever made Roasted Chicken and it turned out very moist and looked beautiful.  However, I doubled the spices to try to difuse the lemon, and it was still a little too lemony.  Will cut down the amount of lemon next time, but will make again!

I found this recipe to be way too lemony. I could hardly taste the chicken amidst all of the lemon. Definitely not one of my favorites.

Easy, inexpensive, and tasty:)  The flavor is in the skin and drippings, so since I don't like to eat the skin, I dipped each bite in the drippings before eating.  (I didn't bother making gravy out of the drippings as some other reviewers suggested, but if I made this for company, I would.)  My husband (who does like the skin) said that this chicken is better than one from the grocery store, but not as good as something from a nice restaurant.  I used a 4 1/2 pound chicken and cooked it at 350 for 2 hours (breast side down for the first 1 1/2).  It was perfectly done and nicely juicy.

This was pretty good. The only change I made was to use a 3 lbs chicken breast rather than the whole chicken and we put some butter under the skin to keep it moist.  The only thing I would have liked is if the juices in the bottom of the pan would have kept better for sauce.  For some reason all the juices burned onto the pan.

This was good...the only thing is that I had a 3 lb. chicken, and I had to make more of the dry seasoning-when I mixed all of the dry ingredients together to put them on the chicken, there was not enough. Also, instead of basting with just olive oil and lemon juice, I used olive oil,lemon juice, lime juice, oj, and fresh garlic...will definatley make again!

This was my first attempt at cooking a whole chicken, and it was definitely a success.  I made it exactly as written, except used lemon juice instead of actual lemons.  The chicken was very moist, and the flavor was light and delicious.

Very good recipe.  I doubled and made 2 large roasters for a potluck dinner.  They got put out near the end so I was thinking I'd have enough to take home to my husband but somebody took an entire chicken, bones and all.  Guess what he will get is leftover pieces in lemon sauce, served over rice, which I'm sure will be delicious.

Made this tonight for supper and I really enjoyed it.  My chicken was 1.5 lbs heavier but only took 1 hour longer to cook.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

The skin got a little black, but the flavor was great and the recipe was easy.  Most of the flavor was in the skin, though -- I would have given it 5 stars if the meat had that much flavor.  I had to cook mine about ten minutes longer than the recipe said.

This tasted fantastic.  I was an idiot and accidentally put my bird in the pan upside down, but it still came out wonderfully.  Word of advice:  Don't try to use the pan juice to make gravy...the lemon tastes too weird in a gravy!  Thanks for the recipe!

FANSTASTIC!  I made this dish last night for dinner and it was the juciest most tender bird I have ever made.  I LOVED the idea of the mustard powder and added some fresh grated ginger root and that gave it a extra fabulous kick!

This chicken is fantastic!  It tastes just as good as those rotisserie ones at the grocery store for $6, and I bought 2 uncooked chickens for less than that.  I ran out of mustard powder, so I used mustard seeds that I crushed a bit (one of those spice rack items that never gets used)and it tastes great.

Thank you for this wonderful roasted chicken recipe.   I have been cooking this for years now and I never get sick of it.  The only changes I have make is I use a 6 pound chicken and I double the dry spice and I keep the liquid the same 2 lemons and 2 tablespoons olive oil. For Christmas I gave all my sons teachers this recipe a baggy of the dry spice with a small gift card to go to the store and buy 2 lemons and a chicken and it was a hit.

This is a very good recipe. I added a little more seasoned salt over the chicken, I also put the lemons inside the chicken after I squeezed them. I baked for 2 hours and basted often. I just finished eating this and it is definitely a keeper!

This was very juicy and moist. I rubbed the chicken with butter inside and out of the cavity first instead of using oil. I used minced garlic instead of powder, I didn't have mustard powder, so I used regular mustard. I used bottled lemon juice, and I ran out of Italian seasoning and had to use just oregano. I guess I pretty much changed everything! Anyway, it was really great, and the family loved it!

I have made this recipe a couple of times.  It tastes fantastic.  My whole family likes it.  The chicken stays moist and tender.  The reason I gave it four stars rather than five is that when I drizzle the lemon/olive oil mixture over the chicken I find the spice mixture washes off.  I then have to scoop it up from the bottom of the pan and put it back on.

Mmmmmm!  I had over a 4 lb bird so I doubled the spices, and I used half lemon, half lime juice.  I also basted with chicken broth every 20 minutes or so.  Great recipe!

Absolutely fantastic!! I cooked the chicken with lemon quarters in the cavity, as suggested by other reviewers. I also needed double the lemon/oil mixture to keep the chicken moist. I cooked mine for 2 hours, adding potatoes after about 1 hour. I will add some salt to the spice mixture next time.

This was very good.  We peeled the skin off because to be a little healthier, but the meat underneath was very moist and flavorful.  I think the next time I make it, I may try it with only 1 tablespoon or less of olive oil (it seemed a little greasy to me when handling. I must have had a larger bird, because mine took longer than 45 minutes to cook all the way through. Otherwise, I would not hesitate to make this again.

I cooked this as described only substituting 6 table spoons lemon juice as one subscriber suggested.  No one in my family was overly impressed with it as we all felt it lacked flavor/taste.  The meat was very juicy; however we won't be trying this one again.

Big Hit!  I cooked 2 game hen rubbing all the herbs inside and stuffing lemon inside each hen after squeezing out the juice.  Obviously, there was a mistyping of the overall cooking time, only common sense.  I cooked the hens for 1 hr. 20 min.  came out wonderful.

This was good but needs a little more seasoning than called for.

This was the juiciest chicken I have ever made. I did have to substitute the lemon with lemon juice and it was wonderful!!!

I used a lot more lemon than the recipe calls for.  Also, a couple of fresh cloves of garlic instead of powder really helps out the flavor.  I've made this many times, always a crowd-pleaser.

This was good. I used lemon juice instead of fresh lemons and it turned out well. It took forever to cook though. I only had a small chicken.. maybe 3 lbs and it took a long time. Do not pay attention to the cook time and I would cook at 350 next time.

Super easy & flavorful recipe!  I stuffed the cut lemons into the chicken cavity, too.  I also followed the pop-up thermometer and my own meat thermometer to test doneness.  Before cutting, I let it sit for almost an hour to retain moisture and it was well worth it because this was some moist and tasty chicken.  I cook chicken early in the week to cut it up for use all week and I just finished my leftover lunch with the chicken and it was scrumptious cold, too!  This recipe doubles without problem, too.  The smell is wonderful!

Very tasty and moist.  I used two four pound chicken and cooked with halved-lemons stuffed inside.  Made for a dinner party of six and every one loved it!!! Total cookie time was two hours for the two birds.!!

My husband LOVED it and said it was the best chicken I'd ever made.  Small improvisation included seasoning salt instead of the Italian and I added some Greek seasoning from Epicure Selections.  Wonderful!

This recipe was ok for us, not as spectacular as we expected.
