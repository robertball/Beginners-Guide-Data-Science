I've used this recipe so often and vary it each time.  I've never been disappointed!  Olive oil also works great!

Very nice change from the usual roasted potatoes!  I would suggest melting the exact amount of coconut oil but adding it to the potatoes a little at a time because I did think there was maybe just a little too much there (hubby didn't).  I also would go a little short on the salt for the same reason (hubby didn't think so).  I did a small batch of these because it is just the two of us.  I ran out of the one kind of onion, so I used a combo of sweet and red onion and shallots.  I think I preferred the shallots, actually.  And I'm not sure why pepper wasn't used, but that's easily rectified.  I'm giving this the whole 5 star rating in spite of what I've written because I know that these will be made a number of times in this kitchen!  Thanks so much, Joni!

I loved these!!! The coconut oil is wonderful! I added some roughly chopped parsley, and it was even better. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Really good and easy!  There were no leftovers.  I appreciate the fact that coconut oil is healthier.

Not sure why the recipe called for only 8 potatoes; fingerlings aren't large so use your best guesstimate.  I used about 10-14 and kept all the other ingredient measurements as written.  I sliced my fingerlings on a mandolin slicer to make them more even.  Instead of using fresh garlic, I sprinkled in garlic powder.  After pouring everything into a baking dish I topped with a shredded Italian cheese blend and bread crumbs.  Cooked at the indicated temp for 45 min and the potatoes were cooked but not mushy.  Very good recipe. Will make again.

These are wonderful with the coconut oil, adds a whole new dimension on oven roasted potatoes. I also had some fresh parsley to use, so I chopped some up and tossed around.

I made this recipe for the second time, tonight. All three of my picky eaters, who rarely agree on anything, asked for seconds. I love this recipe! I only wish I could the potatoes to come out a bit more crisp.

Nothing here worth repeating.  Cook time was 20 minutes longer than the recipe indicates messing up timing.  The added ingredients added no flavor of notice to me and my guests.

delicious and easy! Although used a lot more than 8 fingerling potatoes...I think that is a typo.  I imagine it would be WAY too salty with just 8 (the onions add ALOT of flavor).  I used approx 4lbs of potatoes and the rest of the ingredients remained as is.  I sliced all the potatoes in half and baked for approx 50 min.

Way too much salt in this recipe. I will try it again with a fraction of the salt. It has great potential.

Too salty, too garlicky, after 45 minutes, still not quite done.
