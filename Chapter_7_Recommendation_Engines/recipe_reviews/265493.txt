I followed the recipe exactly as written and I would recommend getting pitted olives, taking the pits out was very time consuming. Try the olives at the olive bar if you cannot find the brand mentioned in the recipe. The bread had an interesting flavor to it. Very salty! I will not be making this recipe again as this was just not in my families flavor profile.
