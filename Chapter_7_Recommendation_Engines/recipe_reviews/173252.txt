Dense, moist, fruity, and delicious! I love this recipe, but DH is not fond of fruit and nuts in baked goods (strange man) so I weighed the batter and removed half before making those additions. I made 12 muffins with the removed batter. They baked in about 19 minutes. It's good without, but I prefer the cranberries and nuts. I toasted my walnuts before chopping them for more flavor. Thanks for a keeper!

Delicious! I made a small adjustment. No ground flaxseed and dried cranberries  in hand. I used fresh cranberries instead. Perfect for my hungry teenage boys' afternoon snack!

Would definitely make this again!!  Delicious!!  Doubled up on the apple sauce, used whole flax, and substituted almonds for walnuts.  There are so many variations possible for this recipe.  Five stars from me!  :)
