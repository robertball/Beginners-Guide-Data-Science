I have made this several times and it is really, REALLY good.  I have played around with it using half-and-half sometimes and cream others.  I prefer using cream, because I like it creamy.  I would definitely recommend using at least whole milk, and not going below that.  Otherwise, it would be too watery, and not at all like a true Bisque.  Also, I use canned tomatoes.  Two 28 cans work perfectly.  Last night I used crushed tomatoes, because it was what I had, and the boyfriend loved the bits of tomato, but I have also used tomato sauce, and I think I prefer the smoothness of it.  Either way, it is a fantastic recipe, and fun to play with.  It seems to come out great however you manipulate the ingredients!

Very good.  However, I did not use fresh tomatoes.  Too much work.  I used 2-16oz cans of diced tomatoes and 1- 16 oz can of tomato sauce.  Also, make sure you use whole milk or half and half, 2% / skim won't cut it.  I also bumped up the sugar to cut the sharpness. Turned out to be thick and creamy, very filling!

This soup was wonderful.  I did not have fresh tomatoes so I used (2) large cans of crushed tomatoes and a can of petite diced tomatoes.  I also used half & half.  It tasted like something from a restaurant.

I love, love this recipe!  I do not have a food mill, so I peeled and seeded the tomatoes, then used my hand blender to puree. So good, thank-you!

Loved It!!  I may never buy canned tomato soup again.  I  used two large cans of crushed tomatoes (processed 1 can in the food processor).  I used 3 cups of 1% milk and 1 cup of whipping cream.  I also added more sugar, basil and threw in some garlic.  I will definitely make again.

We thought this recipe was excellent.  I used canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh and 2% milk.  It's also even better if you add a little more fresh pepper and sprinkle parmesan cheese over the top just before serving.

Make this soup! Believe the reviews! It's an excellent recipe, and very forgiving with slight alterations. Lots of people seem to be using canned tomato. I have made both and the fresh is 10x better. Take the extra time. (if you don't have a food mill, just Blanche the
Tomatoes [put in boiling water For 10 seconds, then into Ice water]. The skin will peel right off. Take out the seeds, then run the tomatoes through a food processor or blender.) Follow the rest of the instructions! I personally add 2x the dried basil, and also add about 8 fresh basil leaves. Use half and half instead of milk for a creamier texture. I would suggest using 3 cups instead of a full quart, for more tomato flavor. Also, I add a little garlic powder. It's very easy and forgiving to make. Defintely give it a try!

Excellent!  I made this the day before I hosted a luncheon, then reheated the  soup in a covered soup pot (as in a ceramic pot with a lid) inside the oven.  I think it tasted better the day I served it, since the flavors had 24 hours to blend nicely.  Had some soup left over, it freezes well.  Used canned tomatoes, but want to try fresh next time.

This bisque is fabulous!!  I also used canned tomatoes plus a can of petite diced for texture.  I would also recommend adding more sugar, and salt & pepper to taste.  I also added a bit more dried basil, oregano, and some onion powder for a kick.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious!  Taking the advice of several reviews this turned out excellent.  I followed the basic recipe but used 3 cans of the 14.5 oz. diced tomatos that included basil, garlic & oregano. Secondly I used 2 1/2 C of whole milk and 1 1/2 C skim milk.  I also added more dried basil, oregano, celery seed and minced garlic.  For that extra kick as suggested I added some ground cayenne  pepper.  All of the extras were not measured.  That is the great thing about this recipe, it allows you to play with different seasonings according to your taste.  My husband also added a bit of tabasco sauce because he likes it extra spicy. I added a bit of parmesan to my bowl.  I cooked it longer than the suggested time after adding the milk portion to the recipe, the longer it cooked the thicker it got.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

AMAZING! I had so many tomatoes left this fall that I really wanted to try and use them up. This is the perfect way to do it. I'm not sure how the taste of canned tomatoes compares, but it does take a bit of extra work to use fresh. I'll assure you if you do the work, you can't go wrong with this soup!

I followed others advice to use 2 28 oz. cans of crushed tomatoes.  Much more tomatoes are required for the ratio of the white sauce added.  After I added the white sauce, there was hardly any tomato flavor there.  I'd recommend halving the amount of milk (really a white sauce.  The recipe also needed more seasonings like garlic and a lot more basil.

I took another reviewer's advice and used 2 16 oz cans of diced tomatoes and 1 16 oz can of tomato sauce. (Sorry but stewing the tomatoes sounded way too complicated).  I also made the roux first then just dumped the rest of the ingredients in so I didn't have to dirty 2 pans.  ;o)  It was DELISH.  Will be a regular in my house - very easy and quick.  Thank you!

I also followed other reviewer suggestions to substitute 2-28 oz. cans of petite diced tomatoes (=3.5 lbs.) for the the 2 lbs. of tomatoes.  More bouillon, basil, sugar, & pepper are needed for the extra tomatoes. However, I used less salt--taste it first before adding.  This soup is great with the extra tomatoes.  It is a really rich recipe, and I will use less butter next time.

My husband and I just went to a restuarant and he had this soup.  He asked me to find a recipe for it and I found this one.  I cheated and used canned tomatoes and followed the directions.  We loved it except for my husband of course wanted it a little chunkier but I loved it.  It was a little acidy so I found out I could use baking soda (sparingly 1/8 tsp at a time) to cut the tart the sugar only changed the flavor. I also used heavy cream instead of milk.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Great recipe!  Followed others suggestions and used canned crushed tomatoes, fresh basil instead of dry.  I also added about three quarters of a bag of fresh spinach that I chopped.  Sprinkled with goat cheese before serving.

I’m still making this recipe after several years.
I usually buy two 28-oz cans of diced or stewed tomatoes (seasoned). I just toss the tomatoes into the blender and puree.  (Using fresh tomatoes, I still throw them into the blender and puree.) 
I use half 'n half or cream.  I, personally, would not go below half 'n half since it would make the bisque too watery.  Like others, I would also recommend adding more sugar, basil, salt & pepper to taste. It can be a bit too bland otherwise. 
Adding a splash of tabasco sauce to the bowl adds a nice kick.
We use a dollop of sour cream on top or sprinkled parmesan cheese.

Excellent recipe! I have made this several times. I highly recommend using fresh basil (2T) instead of dried. Using 2 - 28oz. crushed tomatoes instead of fresh tastes just as good. I used 1/4 tsp. garlic powder for just a hint of garlic taste. Also, for a true bisque like taste, wisk in 5oz of cream cheese in your milk mixture.

This was so easy to make.  I took my heirloom tomatoes out of the freezer and blanched them so the skin peels off easily.  I added some fresh garlic to the tomato mixture.  We like the soup a bit creamy so I added some extra flour to the butter milk mixture.  Turned out fabulous.  Hubby and I just enjoyed this wonderful dish. Thank you for sharing.

This bisque turned out absolutely amazing!  I omitted the bay leaf and used chopped fresh basil towards the end of cooking, and substituted non-fat half and half for the milk.  Wow, this was just so yummy!  My boyfriend (not the biggest fan of tomatoes) thought it was delicious as well.  :)

Outstanding!  This is a no-fail tomato bisque soup.  I used fresh tomatoes - because I had them and have this thing about canned food when fresh is available - and substituted organic white whole wheat flour.  This was very hearty with chunky tomato bits for some attitude and a cream base.  I stuck to the recipe, but could see maybe adding a little garnish for guests, just to dress it up a little.  Other than that, this is a wonderful soup, elegant.  Also, I learned how to properly seed and peel tomatoes!  Time consuming but a worthwhile culinary skill, right?

Excellent. I used two cans of crushed tomatoes instead of cooking from scratch since I had limited time and it came out great. We did add an extra can of tomato sauce to give a stronger tomato flavor.

This is the first dish I've made on Allrecipes! 

Well, I want to give 3 stars, but that wouldnt be fair for several reasons. 

For one, our tomatos havent come in yet, so i used tinned ones, somthing the reviewers warned against. For another, I thought the tomato taste was WAY to strong, but that's my fault for following a reviewers advise and letting it simmer for four hours. Also, where i wanted to have a few sips and throw the rest in the sink, my friend had two bowls. So while it wasnt good enough for me personally to give it another go, it more then likey somthing due more to my own tastes then the recipes integrity.
I used:
10 bay leaves,
2 cans of Tomatos
one large can (850) ml of Tomato juice
1 cup of heavy cream
1/2 a cup of butter
+ four hours of simmering the tomatos and juice

WOW!  This soup is fantastic.  I had a bunch of fresh tomatoes from my garden and what a great way to use them.  I didn't find it too salty at all...just right.  However, I added some onion to it and it was perfect.  A definite keeper.

wow - awesome recipe!  I used 4 1/2 jumbo tomatoes from garden. Also don't have a foodmill but just peeled & seeded the tomatoes & then pureed them in food processor. Really easy & super fast recipe! Instead of 1 qt of milk I did 1/2 quart of half & half and 1/2 quart of milk. Also added some celery seed which I love to use in soups. Thank you Judy!

I used 2 28-oz. cans plus 1 14.5-oz can, undrained diced tomatoes. I also used 1/2 cup flour instead of 1/3, and skim milk, and the thickness was fine. Agree with all the other reviewers that all the seasonings should be increased. My result was thick and delicious! Fast & easy - this is a keeper.

Feb 2016 edit: I have made this multiple times and can never remember what size cans of tomato to use, so tonight I paid attention.  I used 14 oz diced tomato, 14.5 oz tomato sauce & 28 oz crushed tomato.  I wouldn't have minded more of a tomato flavor, so next time I might increase the diced tomato to a larger can.  Tonight I was also cooking vegetarian, so I used vegetable bouillon.  And I had some heavy cream to use up, so I used 1 1/3 c cream and 2 2/3 c skim milk.  It all worked out just fine, but like I said, I think I'll use just a smidge more tomato next time.  There will certainly be a next time.    
  
Original 2012 review:  Very good.  I halved the recipe for just two of us, and it was even better than I expected.  I didn't have fresh home-grown tomatoes on hand (it is Feb), so I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 small can of tomato sauce.  Also, regardless of what others recommended, I was perfectly happy using skim milk.  It may not have been completely bisque-like the way I made it, but it was very tasty anyway.  I will make this again.

Delicious! I used about 5 fresh tomatoes and a can of diced, pureed it all in my Ninja. This recipe is delicious, we did need to add a bit more salt and pepper but other than that was perfect. Served with a toasted sandwich on a cold day, perfect combination!

This was a perfect fall meal. I live in an area where I cannot get canned tomatoes, so this recipe was a big help! I actually diced the tomatoes and put everything in the pot (seeds, skin and all) and then blended it up with my hand blender after the tomatoes were cooked. I used less butter and I didn't have a bayleaf. I used skim milk and added a teaspoon of dried basil. Because of all the changes I made to the recipe, I give it 4 stars. Excellent!

Followed the recipe with the exception of the tomatoes - used diced tomatoes  out of a can - as I did not have fresh tomatoes on hand.  Very good.  Husband and young children enjoyed too.  Will definately make again.  I also like the recipe because of the ingredients - it's all stuff that I have around the house on a regular basis.

I added minced garlic, diced onion, and  diced red pepper to the butter, and used 1 cup of heavy cream that I had on hand. I also used less milk because of the cream.  This was what I was looking for, except that next time I will not add the sugar, or use a lot less (I don't like my tomato soup as sweet).  So, this made an excellant base for my version of bisque...

Ok yes I did veer from the directions.  I kind of combined this recipe and the III one as well.  

I sautéed 1 large red onion and 4 cloves of garlic in butter and olive oil (next time I will try it with the carrots and celery but I didn't have this time). Then, I added 2-28oz cans of peeled tomatoes, sugar, salt, basil, oregano and 2 beef bouillon cubes.  I let that cook for a few and then used my handheld food processor to puree it all.  It came out to a thick consistency so no flour was needed.  Finally, I added 1 cup of half&half.  

This came out absolutely delicious.  This is a definite repeat. 

P.S. took the picture after the fact so it's not as pretty as it could be but I tell you it's delicious regardless!

I have made this several times, first as written is very good. My twist that is loved by friends and family is: Only use Roma Tomatoes sliced into quarters into the pot with spices after 30 minutes of simmering use hand blender to liquefy, I use a 1/2 cup of flour as I like my soup a little thicker, and I use half & half instead of milk.

I've made tomato bisque before with fresh tomatoes and it was REALLY good but decided to try the canned which wasn't quite as tasty. I recalled having cooked onion with the tomato and put that through a strainer so I decided to put a small onion & garlic through the processor and added the mash along with the other seasonings. Very happy with the results. The roux & milk mixture went together well but one must be patient and keep it on medium for quite a long time. I made a double batch so that may be the reason for taking so long to thicken up. When I got this all together I put some the soup in quart canning jars and now have two quarts to share or have during the week. My husband gives it a thumbs up!

I had high hopes for this bisque, but it was disappointing for me.  I don’t have a food mill, so I peeled, seeded and chopped 2 lbs of fresh tomatoes and pulsed them in my food processor, leaving them a little chunky for some texture.  I covered this while simmering over very low heat because I didn’t want it to cook away.  Since I was using fresh basil, I added it at the end so it’s flavor wouldn’t diminish over the long cooking time.  The biggest problem I had with this recipe was the amount of milk – way too much in my opinion, for the amount of tomatoes.  I doubt that I’ll make this recipe again, but if I do I will increase the amount of tomatoes significantly and probably use some heavy cream, just to give it some creamy richness.

If I could, I would give this 10 stars. I made it for my husband and myself last night, and he gave it rave reviews. The main thing that I changed was that I did not skin and seed the tomatoes at all. I just pureed them in my trusty blender before cooking and everything went really quickly. Also, I used whole milk which made it super creamy without being *soooo* heavy like cream. It was fantastic. I think what sets this soup apart from run-of-the-mill tomato soup is the fact that it's not super acidic. Instead it's silky smooth and rich - the beef stock also helps with this. My husband already asked when I can make this again! :) Thanks Judy for the great recipe! :)

Absolutely restaurant quality! Actually this is better than I've had at a restaurant. Made it for 50 people last weekend. Everyone wants the recipe. I even did this substituting spray margarine (liquid) for the butter and it still tasted awesome!

I used crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes as below in another review. This was easy and good. I used a little cream added to milk. I can see why this would be a good thing to put up and keep in storage but its easy to make.

I have always been afraid to make tomato soup before, but I had the ingredients for this one (or so I thought) so I tried it.  I used canned tomatoes and a bit of tomato sauce like some of the other posters and that worked great. I just made sure to mix them up really good in my Magic Bullet.  I came to find out I had NO bay leaves or bay of anything, but I did have some Mrs. Dash sodium free and dumped all my little sample packs of that in the soup (it has bay in it and prett much all the other ingredients).  I put a bit of red pepper in it (I like a bit of bite to my soup), salt, pepper, and some garlic salt. 

I will say that is says is makes 4 servings, but this made about 6 servings.  Maybe because I added the tomato sauce to it, but I used the exact measurements when it came to the milk.  I had no cream and the 1% milk I used did fine.

Thanks for the recipe.  My son belched all though dinner (compliment to the cook) and ate 2 bowls of it.  He is only 6. 

THANKS!!

Yum!  So easy!  I was craving a tomato bisque to go with the poppyseed ciabatta rolls I got from the bakery this morning.  I happened to have just enough tomatoes from the garden to make one serving of the soup, and added a little bit of tomato juice I had in the fridge.  Perfect lunch for this cool fall day!  Served with a glass of cherry mint iced tea. :)

This recipe as is is lacking a lot of flavour.  I used 3 lbs. of garden fresh tomatoes, all varieties, and it still had no tomato flavour.  I ended up having to add a large can of crushed tomatoes, garlic, onion powder, tons of basil and italian spice, and even allspice just to give it some oomph!  Sadly, I hate to rate it low, as I LOVE tomato bisque, but at least I have a base for my own version!!  Thanks!

I had always wanted to try making homemade tomato soup/bisque...this is very tasty, thick, and rich.  I made a few changes, based on another recipe I'd read--I simmered chopped celery and onion with the tomatoes (I used canned tomatoes)and the herbs.  Then I pureed all with an immersion blender. Also, I used brown sugar instead of white.  This recipe makes quite a lot of soup--I had scaled it to 10 in order to serve 15, and I had about twice as much as I needed. But it's great the next day.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe, except I used two one-pound cans of crushed tomatoes versus milling my own tomatoes. (I'm lazy.)

I will def. make this again.  Read other reviews and added more sugar and basil and 1 tsp of oregano, 3 cloves of garlic for a double batch.  This would be easy to can and heat for lunch on a cold WNY winter day. One of the best tomato bisque I have made.

I needed an easy recipe from pantry items on a night when I really just wanted soup.  This was IT!  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for a tiny bit of kick, but otherwise I made it as-is.  Oh, and I only had skim milk but it still tasted great.  Next time I'll try fat free half&half.

I've tried to make low-cal tomato bisque to no avail, so this time I decided to just dive in and stop disappointing my taste-buds.  Switched up a few things because of what I had on hand...vegetable bullion instead, 1T fresh chopped basil, 1T butter, 1T flour and 1cup heavy whipping cream. Perfect tomato flavor and outstanding rich-ness.  I don't own a food mill but I wanted the texture so instead of blending the tomatoes I threw them into the stock pot and used a fine potato masher to break up the tomatoes into fine bits before adding the seasoning. I simmered 20 min covered and 10 min uncovered. Only came out to 3 cups of soup (my own fault with the changes) but outstanding!  I'll definitely use this as my base if I ever try a "low-cal" version again.  Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes to the rue to add a spicy kick.

I used tomatoes from the garden and noticed that several reviewers found fresh tomato preparation time consuming. Don't worry about peeling fresh tomatoes!  First blanch them whole in boiling water for about 30seconds to 1 minute fresh from the garden, then carefully lift each tomato out with big spoon and place the hot tomato in a bowl of ice water.  The skin will blister off easily and after it cools, you can quickly peel the skin and remove the stem and core if needed. A stick type blender makes short order of the tomatoes and shortens the prep time for this recipe considerably.   Heirloom tomatoes are particularly delicious.

This recipe makes quite a bit more soup than I expected. I would say it makes closer to 6-7 cups sized servings of soup than 4 servings. I am accustomed to using the soup mode on my blender, so I just mixed all the ingredients in it until it was hot. I didn't add the bay leaf because it is normally an ingredient that gets taken out of the soup before blended. I also couldn't fit the last cup of milk in my blender. After tasting the soup, I thought it was too thin and rather bland. I adjusted the seasonings adding some garlic powder, onion powder, and a pinch or so more basil. I used 1% milk and butter with olive oil. That may have been part of it being thinner, don't know, because I left out a full cup of milk. I decided to tweak it to give it more flavor. I turned my bowl into a blt soup, by garnishing it with real bacon bits and a shredded cheddar blend. That greatly improved the overall taste.

My dad is on a no salt diet, he loves soup and you can not find very many low salt or no salt foods out there in the stores. Mom and I have learned to can, this is one of our favorite soup recipes. We dont have a food mill so I skin the tomatoes and run them threw the blender. This recipe is quick, easy, healthy and delicious!!!!

I tried the recipe twice and I love it!! Very easy. I uses the Hunts Canned Whole Peeled tomatoes.  I attempted to remove some of the seeds, but didn't mind it so much.  However, I didn't like the consistency of the soup or the look of it after the I poured in the milk mixutre. So I used the blender to puree it (in batches) and it came out creamier, and it looks better.

I love this recipe for the winter!  I really didn't change much at all.  I only made half (cooking for just one) the recipe.  I used 1 28oz box of crushed (low sodium, organic) tomatos, and every thing else was proportional.  It was great and super easy.  I had it for dinner with a slice of quiche....can't beat that for a cold night!

I've tried the original recipe and thought it was okay. When I decided to make it again I did tweak it a bit by doubling the bouillon cubes. I also used half the amount of butter and about 1/3 cup of half and half instead of milk and added some crushed red peppers. It was FANTASTIC!!!

Very tasty!!!  I did not used fresh tomatoes.  Used 2 - 28oz cans of crushed tomatoes.  Also, I sauteed some minced garlic with the butter when I made the roux.  No other changes needed.  Definitely try some parmesan and croutons on the top.

Great soup, just finished eating it for lunch.  I subbed the tomatoes for 1 28 oz. can of crushed, and two 14.5 cans of petite diced, and it turned out delicious.

I have no idea how this would be 4 servings, I'll be surprised if I get less than 6 generous servings out of it.  It'll make for great lunches this week, though!

I opted to use cream instead of milk, as one reviewer had recommended, but this was a mistake. I can tell that the bisque has a great flavor, but it's overwhelmed by the cream. It's a little to thick, and I had to add dye to make it look a little more appealing. I'm going to try it with milk the next time, and I'm willing to bet it will be way better.

Fantastic Recipe!

This recipe is my first attempt at making Soup, and I have to say, this is super easy, and incredibly delicious.

A few suggestions:
a) Use canned tomatoes (Peeling them is waaay too time consuming... I learned that the hard way)
b) Make 2 batches in 1, to get all your soup making for the week out of the way
c) Substitute in a fraction of fat-free creamer instead of milk to thicken a little
d) Use light butter instead of real regular butter (I use Country Crock Light)
e) Add chopped garlic
f) Instead of reducing over the stove, blend the tomatoes in a blender!  Saves a lot of time.

Happy Soup Making :)

I grow my own tomatoes and this recipe gave me just what I needed, a canning option and a great taste.  As with other reviews, whole milk or 1/2 and 1/2 gives the creaminess needed.

Very delicious and easy to make! I made it with 1% milk and chickenbroth and it was still very creamy and yummy. I have a good food mill and milling the fresh tomatoes was no problem. Will definitely safe this recipe and make often

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Fast and easy too! I took others suggestions and used two cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of dealing with the fresh tomatoes. Also added fresh basil and crushed garlic. I substituted half 1/2 & 1/2 and half fat free dairy creamer for the milk to lighten it up a little and it tasted great! Definitely a keeper!

It was the best soup we have had in a LONG time.  It was sooo yummy. We were fighting over the last bowl.

I thought this one was ok...  I did follow what others said about using cream or whole milk and I did like that.  I alos like having tiny bits of tomoatoes in my soup so did not prcess them down all the way.  I know I said I liked the cream in the soup, but felt there was too much butter.  Next time I will for sure cut back on that.  I also found that I needed more tomoatoes than what the recipe called for, so be ready with extras.

I had to go back and redo my rating based on my changes. I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of tomato soup.  I also used 1 pint half and half instead of milk and half the amount of flour.  I added a lot more sugar as well.  I kept adding it until I got the taste I was looking for.  I probably used a little less than 1/4 cup.  It was plenty for 4 of us.  Thank you Judy for the recipe!  I have been looking for a recipe that was similar to Panera's.  Your recipe was a great starting point!

This bisque was fantastic!  It turned out very similar to the restaurant one that made me look for the recipe.  I used chicken bouilion cubes instead of beef, used 2% milk, and light butter.  I also used canned diced tomatos.  One can of Italian flavored, and two cans of regular.  I ran one can of the regular through the food processor.  This is definitely a keeper!

This soup is excellent.  I used half and half and it was very rich. I think I'd just go with whole milk next time. I also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones.

I cut the milk down to 2.5 cups and used skim milk.  I think I'll add more next time and see how that works.  Excellent soup!

Followed the instructions to the Letter.  My family wasn't a huge fan of this.  I thought it was a little on the bland side.  Will not make again.

Good. Scaled down to 2 servings and was still a bit much for app.Used half and half and crushed tomatoes in a can. Will use paste next time for smoother finish.

This was wonderful.  The only things I did different was to roast the tomaotes before hand.  And then used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk just to make it creamier.  Then at the end I add a few drops of liquid smoke.  I don't like tomato soup but this I could eat every day.  Thanks so much for the recipe

It was a good base for a tomato bisque, but I had to add a few more things to make it not taste like pure tomatoes.  I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the final mixture, plus extra basil  Quite a bit actually because I like to taste the basil.  I also added about 3 Tbls of butter, and 1/2 cup of milk.  It made it more rich and not so tomatoe-y.  Good starter recipe though!

Don't add as much butter or milk as is called for.  This will keep it tomato-ey instead of too creamy.

Used 2 16 oz cans petite diced (no salt added) tomatoes and 1 16 oz tomato sauce, also no salt added. Did not purée. Used 1 1/2 C heavy cream plus 2 C low-fat milk. Made the roux first, then added rest of the ingredients. We loved the soup. I did notice the next day the pieces of tomato had toughened so would strain or purée next time.

Used fresh tomatoes & a can of diced tomatoes.   I sautéd some fresh onion & garlic in oil and cut down the sugar a little, then added a can of chicken stock & left out the beef bouillon,  then I only used 2 cups of milk in the roux.  I puréed the tomatoes before adding the roux. Added in a dollop of sour cream after the roux.

I blanched and peeled the tomatoes first to make it easier to put them through the food mill, and I halved the amount of milk because I like mine with more tomatoes. This soup is sooooooo good!

Loved this recipe.  Instead of one quart of milk I used 1/2 quart of milk and 1/2 quart of heavy whipping cream.  Yummy.  However, next time I will add twice the milled tomato amount.

I love this recipe and my twin 4 year olds ask for it all of the time. Delicious with homemade bread. Because of lactose issues we use almond milk and reduce the butter, but it still turns out great!

I love this soup, even though I make it with canned tomatoes.  I use San Marzano tomatoes, and it's so good, but I don't add the flour or milk.  I don't like tomato soup with milk in it.  I do add the butter to the soup, though.  It's so good, like BJ's restaurant soup.  Thank you for this recipe, I have made it twice now in the last couple weeks.  I am going to grow the San Marzano tomatoes next year just for this soup.

I've had an abundance of tomatoes in my greenhouse this year so as they were ripening, I froze them whole in a zipper bag just for this soup.

I use the exact ingredients but cook a little different to make it less time consuming and much less wasteful. Rough chop the tomatoes and cook them down about ten minutes. When soft, mash them a little with a potato masher. Then put them in the mill to strain off the stems, seeds, and skins. Much quicker this way and you don't waste as much fruit.

I made a dairy free, gluten free version that came out super delicious.  Substitutions:  instead of fresh tomatoes, I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce.  Instead of flour, I used all purpose GF flour.  Instead of milk, I used soy milk.  So easy to make and so yummy!

This would be 5-star if the tomatoes were doubled. I used 2 cups 2% milk and 2 cups half and half as recommended by others and it was just way too much white sauce for the amount of tomatoes. In a pinch, I added a 24 oz can of pasta sauce and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce to get back to a tomato flavor. (I was out of more tomatoes, fresh or canned.) Everyone's right in that it's a flexible recipe that can altered easily if needed. I'll try it again with double the tomatoes, maybe more basil and pepper, and I think it'll be perfect!

Very easy to make, and very tasty. I used 2% milk and my boyfriend and I still thought it came out great. In fact, he said it's one of the best soups I have ever made.

A good start but bland to me. I doubled the herbs, a dash or of red pepper, added onion, carrot, and garlic, and a can of cream of corn. Delicious! Will be making again!

I just made this soup and I will make again. I left out the sugar and most of the salt. I added 2 cloves of pressed garlic, a pinch of dried dill weed and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I  have to say it turned out great.

The recipe is great.  I did not have fresh tomatoes on hand but, I did have two cans of tomatoes. 1 diced plain and 1 diced fire roasted tomatoes. substituted the milk with a non-dairy almond milk.  I also added additional salt....1/2teaspoon more.  I also substituted the sugar with 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  The bisque was thick and flavorful.  I will save this and do it again

fantastic tomato bisque recipe.  it is easy to make and extremely flavorful.  like other reviewers, I substituted fresh tomatoes for 2 cans of 28 oz crushed tomatoes.  I makes a ton of soup so next time I will cut the recipe in half, but otherwise I would totally change a thing.  my husband who won't eat tomato soup loved this recipe and ate the whole bowl.

I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a can of sauce. This soup was really good. I put a little chopped chives on top before serving and made some parmesan crisps instead of using croutons. Even the leftovers were eaten right up.

I didn't have beef bouillon, so I used chicken instead.  It was still very good.  I also added some more basil, and onion and garlic powder. Like everyone says, this is a great base recipe and you can play around with it! Have fun making it your own!

I love this soup. I didn't have a food mill so I peeled the tomatoes with the hot bath method and then used my emulsion blender and didn't take out the seeds. I also had 1 cup of cream I wanted to use up but other than that made as directed. I think thats the beauty of this recipe. If you want to make it richer it's your choice to add cream or if you want it leaner use milk. Thank you so much for sharing quite possible the tastiest homemade tomato soup ever.

This recipe turned out SO darn good! I used what I had on hand. I had no cream so I used 2%milk, and I omitted the beef bouillon; even with these changes the soup was so satisfying and delicious. I used a mix of garden and store tomatoes and fresh basil. Next time I will use cream and I'm sure it will be even better.

I made this soup today and it came out great.  The flavors are delicious.  I used fresh tomatoes pealed and unseeded them  and I only had skim milk and read the unfavorable reviews about is so I used whatever else I had on hand and it was  2 cups of cream and 1 1/4 cup half and half and rounded the quart off with 3/4 cup skim milk and it came out  thick and creamy, just the right consistency.  I also added an additional table spoon of sugar and left everything else in the recipe as is. My husband  loved the soup too and complimented me on the taste the rest of the evening and told me I was a great cook.  That meant a lot to me cuz  I am actually more of a baker then cook haha. thanks to Allrecipe and the other sites on the internet  I am turning into a decent chef.  My mom never taught me how to cook and always threw me out of the kitchen when I was young so I just use other peoples recipe and wanna thank all those great cooks who post them here and all over the net.. Thank you so much.

One of our favorite soups. We never eat canned soup and recipes like this one is why. I did give it 5 stars because once you get it right, it is delicious. As written it is probably a 3 or 4 star recipe. Here are the problems: too much liquid for the amount of tomatoes. I do not use any more than 3 1/2 cups of half and half. At 4 cups it is too watery and loses flavor. Also,  I add some crushed garlic and about a 1/4 c of chopped onion. I feel it is lacking without. I do not use canned tomatoes but instead fresh, organic and organic half and half instead of milk. This soup is absolutely the best tomato soup we've ever had.

loved it! I used fresh tomatoes and used my ninja blender. The second time I made this, I tried blending in a red bell pepper to sweeten it and using less sugar and it turned out great! This recipe is good and healthy. I've made it about 5 times so far!

Yum! I doubled the recipe to feed 12 and it was perfect! I like my soup a little more creamy so I used half whipping cream and half milk. It was so good, my sister in law tried to skip the soup. She said "no thanks" because she doesn't like tomato soups, well I made her try it and she ate 3 bowls!  This recipe is a keeper!

I used two 28 oz cans of diced tomatoes and got terrific results.  Next time I'll add less salt and salt gradually to taste.  Using half milk, and half whipping cream gave a marvelously creamy texture.  I served it to dinner guests with a small dollop of sour cream.   My soup-averse daughter loved it.

Pretty good. Used heavy cream instead of milk, chicken instead of beef bouillon. Crushed tomatoes instead of fresh. For a first try, pretty good. Will continue to tweak, but a great place to start....

I bought 2lbs of tomatoes and did exactly as written. It did not have enough tomato taste and I ended up adding a quart of homemade canned tomatoes. Once blended together, it tasted a lot better.

I absolutely love this soup! I would love to can like Judy had mentioned in the recipe. I just don't know if I need to add anything to it before I process in quarts and how long and what pressure in my pressure cooker. I am at 750 ft above sea level. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks

The flavor of this soup is really yummy! Be careful not to make it too thick -- I like to keep some chunks of tomatoes in the soup as referenced in Blue4MyEyes' review. 
Just a word of caution: the base of this soup is NOT safe for canning because of the ingredients in bouillon -- and even if that is left out until the soup is made, one may find the herbs to be overpowering once canned with the tomatoes/sauce (this happens with many herbs).
If you are looking to can a LOT of fresh tomatoes and have found this recipe while in search of "different ways to can tomatoes," I would strongly suggest just canning them plain and then opening them up and using them when it is time to make this soup recipe. Check out NCHFP (a US government website), freshpreserving.com (this site belongs to the parent company of Ball/Kerr canning jars)/ recently published Ball Canning Books (some recipes in older publishings have been re-tested and are no longer considered safe), or bernardin.ca (this site is the Canadian 'sister site' to Ball/Kerr in the US). These are the only three canning recipe providers that scientifically test recipes for the safety of home-canned goods. :)

This was a fantastic recipe!  I used some tomatoes I had canned over the summer and did add more sugar and salt.  At the end, I also added 1 cup of Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chilies)just for some added texture and a little bite.  Tasted even better the next day!  This is a keeper!

This is an amazing recipe!  After reading a few reviews I created this to my liking and here's how I did it. I didn't want that large of a pot of soup so I used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes,  approximately 1/2 chicken broth, 1/2 or a little more butter and a drizzle evoo, large sprinkle basil, onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper. I let that cook down then added a very large pinch of sugar and a little over 1/2 of a large carton of half and half and then thickened with corn starch dissolved in water. It was so delicious!  Thank you so much for this basic recipe to go by! This is a keeper!!!!!

I have made this several times and it is really, REALLY good. I have played around with it using half-and-half sometimes and cream others. I prefer using cream, because I like it creamy. I would definitely recommend using at least whole milk, and not going below that. Otherwise, it would be too watery, and not at all like a true Bisque. Also, I use canned tomatoes. Two 28 cans work perfectly. Last night I used crushed tomatoes, because it was what I had, and the boyfriend loved the bits of tomato, but I have also used tomato sauce, and I think I prefer the smoothness of it. Either way, it is a fantastic recipe, and fun to play with. It seems to come out great however you manipulate the ingredients!

I just made this recipe for the umpteenth time and shared it with neighbors. I make it for the teacher appreciation luncheon each year and it always gets rave reviews! I use fresh tomatoes and run them whole (or sliced in half) with skin and seeds through my Vitamix on high for 30-45 seconds until its completely smooth and puréed. So easy!!! And I use half and half instead of milk... so yummy!!!

This creates a delicious and comforting bisque. I was feeling a bit more creative the last time I made it, and added 1 can of chick peas, about 1/2 tsp. cumin, and a dash of cinnamon.  Oh my! It had a rich, Middle Eastern flavor. Pair it with some pita or crusty bread, and it's a meal in itself.

It's a great low sodium recipe if you use fresh tomatoes or sodium free canned of some type--about all you can find is diced or whole--but will work if processed correctly.  They make beef bullion cubes or powder without sodium as well.

I use a large can of natural tomato purée and I use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.  I top a bowl of this soup off with some nice shredded Mexican cheese and curtons.  It is awesome!

This recipe turned out extremely poorly - I followed it exactly. The soup ended up being a very pale peach colour. It was as if there was too much milk/not enough tomatoes. I reweighed my tomatoes twice and definitely used 2 lbs. The flavour wasn't terrible, but certainly wasn't great.

I would give it a 5 star rating. Very nice to serve as a lunch with mozzarella pesto toasted sandwiches!
Only takes 1/2 hour if you use canned tomatoes as other reviewers have suggested.

I tried this recipe and it is delicious with only one change - I added fresh basil rather than dried. I suppose using canned tomatoes would be okay, but using fresh tomatoes is preferred, hands down! I would like to know how it is canned - with a pressure canner (at what pressure and how long for pints) or water bath canner.

This is a great recipe! I'm not a soup lover myself but a hangover had me crying for something soothing. LOL This was it. I didn't have fresh tomatoes either and opted for cans of tomato sauce. I also threw in a can of diced tomatoes for a chunkier texture. It was awesome!! Thanks for a winner Judy!!

This mildly flavored soup benefits greatly with the addtional of an generous splash of cream or dry sherry! Pour up a bowl and add the sherry to the bowl (off heat). This soup is quicker to make than the time quoted. A very nice bisque with the additional flavor of the sherry.

So good! I usually tweak recipes, but w/ the exception of using canned crushed & diced tomatoes, made this according to the recipe. This will go into my recipe box - very easy and the taste is right on. Easy recipe to incorporate your own additions.

I added just a bit more sugar, but I think the amount needed depends on the acidity of your tomatoes.  I used Carnation evaporated whole milk & it worked very well.  This recipe is a keeper - much better than canned.

This soup is fantastic!  I bought some tomatoes out of season that were more orange than red along with some medium sized cherry type tomatoes and it still turned out super tasty.  I was so impressed, I sent it to a couple of friends to try which I've never done before

I was a bit discouraged with the results from this recipe.  Guess I was expecting something with a little more tomato flavor. Being short on whole tomatoes, I had to use 3 roma tomatoes (about 2/3 lb.) and add two cans of organic diced tomatoes. After trying the food mill for a while, I gave up and grabbed the blender, blending for a few seconds, leaving lumps in the tomatoes for a bit of texture.  Completed the rest of the recipe and, after adding the roux and milk blend to the tomato/spice blend, seeing and tasting that I had much more milk than tomatoes, I grabbed a 15oz can of tomato sauce and added it.  It turned out okay although if I used the recipe again, I would add at least 3, if not maybe 4 beef bouillon cubes. And, I would expect that the bisque could have been a little thicker in so much as I had to add the can of tomato sauce.  My wife has ask that I go back to an old family recipe that I use on occasion for tomato bisque.

I love this soup.  I have made it now 5 times since August.  However, I cannot figure out how not to get the tiny little white specks which I believe to be the flour.  I follow the directions exactly.  Any comments?    I have not changed a thing

I am in LOVE with this recipe!  I have been looking for  a recipe like this for a while now and I have made it several times.  I have altered the directions slightly - I buy fresh tomatoes, cut them in half and roast them.  Then I let them cool and pull the skins right off, put the good parts in the blender, blend and then cook that with all the other ingredients.  I also use a little less butter and a mixture of cream and milk to give it a richer flavor without just using straight cream.  It is amazing!  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, the kids loved it, but definitely needed something else, I'll try some herbs or something spicy next time.  Also, too much milk/butter, I might go much heavier on the tomato portion (like double) to that amount of milk.

This was soooo tasty! Like many others I used canned stewed tomatoes and I didn't have any beef bouillon so I used some steak marinade instead to give it that robust flavor. It worked! Tasted great.

modified based on what i had on hand.

started with a pint of half and half, then added milk till i had a quart.

doubled the sugar.

i had no bay leaves, so i used 1/4 teaspoon of oregano.

oh and 2 - 15oz cans of tomato sauce. 

all in all, not too shabby since it was made with what i had on hand. i'll prolly make it the same way again. great with some grilled cheese.

I wanted a homemade tomato. The canned versions are too sweet. This was perfect. I took others advice and used canned tomatoes, diced and stewed. Didn't have beef bouillon, so I used chicken stock I had on had. I didn't use the flour and only used a cup of FF half & half. I also cooked this in a crockpot on low for 4 hours. I added the half & half in the serving bowl. It was absolutely delish. Will definitely use again.

Made this recipe using 1 large can of crushed tomatoes and a 14.5 oz can of diced fire roasted tomatoes (which I diced to even smaller pieces). I also used a quart of half and half, next time I will try whole milk though, as the soup was good but rich. This goes great with grilled cheese sandwiches.

I love this soup!  I've kept everything the same except that I use about two cups of diced tomatoes and two cups of tomato sauce.  I have yet to make it with fresh tomatoes, but it's tasty this way as well.  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious! I have never made bisque, but this was very good.  i used canned tomatos, but stuck to the recipe other than that (minus the bullion...forgot that one at the store).  I made 3 servings and my husband and I had half of it left (it made a lot).  Great recipe, will do again.

Very good recipe!  Great way to use all those tomatoes.  After trying it the first time I made it again and froze the tomato mixture.  The tomatoes keep coming so I'll probably make more and freeze.  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't say that I followed the recipe to a "T" because I didn't have it infront of me when making the soup... but it was a great basis for my soup. I made the roux and added about a cup of beef broth (didn't have bouillon). Then I added 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can diced fire roasted tomatoes and 1 can pureed fire roasted tomatoes. I used half and half instead of milk and added worchestershire, red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper to the original recipe. Excellent easy supper with grilled ham and cheese sandwiches. My bf wants me to add italian sausage next time, so we'll see. Thank you very much!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! I made it without modifications, except for using canned tomatoes. This was delicious, creamy, and lovely.

I don't have a food mill, and I didn't feel like going through the labor of peeling/seeding the tomatoes (especially since I was making this to use up two pints of grape tomatoes that were starting to wrinkle somewhat), so I decided to make this "rustic," skins and all.  I halved the recipe, but I still used two bouillon cubes.  I also used less butter and skim milk to make it healthier (and I was a big fan of being able to keep the salt low).  Perhaps I'm not picky, but I really liked the way it turned out!  This actually tasted like food...not some sort of scary salt with watery tomatoes concoction that you get in a can.

OMG!!!! This soup is so good I don't have a food mill so I listened to what another reviewer said and put in three small cans of diced tomatoes.  My son even liked it and he is picky.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe. I used three cans of diced tomatoes one contained garlic and basil. I pureed all three cans.  Also added more garlic, basil, oregano and low fat 1/2 and 1/2.  I also used chicken boullion cubes instead of beef.  Great soup.  Just the right texture.  Can't wait to share this recipe with friends.

My wife loved this soup after I added a pinch of cayenne and added two cups of tomato sauce.  It did not have enough of a tomato taste without the additional sauce and the cayenne gave it a really great after taste.

An excellent recipe.  I used one quart of the bisque base that I had canned during tomato season.  To make the soup I added one cup of low sodium V-8 juice and used 3 cups of milk instead of a quart to get a more tomatoey flavor. The whole family loved it.

This was such a delicious recipe! I did as the other ladies did and used three 16 oz. cans of tomato paste. Other than that, I didn't alter the recipe. It came out incredible!

YUM-O-RAMA! I added a little paprika, marjoram, and curry and used 1% milk to lighten it up a little. Perfect with grilled cheese (duh)! Thank you!

The first time the only thing I changed was to use fresh basil. I only had 2% milk and it was GREAT. Then I tried using canned tomatoes and it was almost exactly the same! Made it with grilled cheese using cheddar & baguettes and it was the best grilled cheese and tomato soup ever!

We used fresh basil in the soup base and fresh parmesean on top of individual bowls of soup. Also used 50/50 skim milk and half-and-half.  The tomatoes were not pureed. It was a very tasty and rich soup. What are the proportions for the roux if you can the base ahead of time?

My husband and I thought this was just okay.  Probably won't make again, but it's a good base to go by.  Thanks for sharing.
