Way too sweet and thick.  Needs less yogurt and some milk . I would do 2 cups milk and 1 cup vanilla yogurt and unsweetened apple butter and add maple syrup or honey if you want it sweeter. Remember it is apple butter not apple sauce.

This recipe is sooo yummy!  I used cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice and added a splash of almond milk. I love the crunchiness of this overnight oatmeal.  I am definitely making it again....tonight!!
