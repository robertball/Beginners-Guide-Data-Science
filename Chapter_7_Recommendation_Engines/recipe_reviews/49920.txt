I loved it. I am not a big pork chop fan at all. This is absolutely delicious. My fiancee & can't believe how good a little tomato sauce and maple syrup make the pork chops. Highly recommended!

Unbelieveable what pancake syrup and tomato sauce can do for pork chops.  My family loved it.

Excellent!!  My husband and I thought it was very flavorful.   I added extra pepper.  The one thing that I did change was the rice.  I used brown rice already made up and just added it to the sauce and heated it together.  The pork was tender.  I used boneless pork chops.  We will make it again.

Pressed for time, no time to shop, so searched for a recipe by ingredients I had on hand.  This fit that category, however I was a skeptic.  Wow!  Husband raved and I loved it to. Next time I will top browned Pork chops with onion slices before simmering in sauce.  Otherwise 5 stars.

Tasty (not mind-blowing) and easy! I added some garlic powder to the pork chops when browning them, which was a good addition.

Not impressed but is will do in a pinch.  The rice did not cook well enough in the time allowed and everything was a little dry. If there was an instant pot version of this it may work better.
