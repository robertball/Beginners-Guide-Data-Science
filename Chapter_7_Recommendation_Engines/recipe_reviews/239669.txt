Pretty good. I added a diced sweet onion, green pepper and minced garlic to the sausage, along with some parsley flakes and dried basil to the wet ingredients later. I also sprinkled some shredded mozzarella cheese after I turned off the stove, covered the skillet and let it set for about 5 minutes to melt. All in all, I liked it.

The great thing about this recipe is how easy it is and how little mess is generates. Brown your meat, toss in the other ingredients, and simmer for 10-15 minutes (mine was done a bit early). Done! It's not my favorite, but it'll probably make its way into my rotation just because it's so simple to make when I'm tired and don't feel like cooking. I used Prego spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and it worked great.

This was a quick and easy dish. A bit starchy for me.
Will make again and cook the pasta separately.

Super, Super easy and ready in no time.  I used half hot and half sweet sausage and added just a bit more Italian seasoning to our taste and some wine when it started to stick to the skillet.   Was only cooking for 2 so we enjoyed the leftovers for lunch - gets better as it sits. Served with a salad and garlic bread - and wine!

This recipe is super easy and is very good. I followed it exactly and we all loved it. I did not have any trouble with the noodles cooking properly, and they were not starchy. This recipe is better than a hamburger helper.

Really easy. Didn't have flavored tomatoes. Used 1 can 28 ounce tomatoes (only used 1cup of water to compensate), added Italian seasonings, half a red onion, 2 cloves of garlic. Used 3 sausages and probably 8-10 oz pasta.

Such an easy and delicious meal. All in one pot. The only ingredient I changed was the pork sausage. I added hot Italian sausage and it added so much flavour. Will be making this again.

I have made this several times. A great easy alternative to spaghetti and meatballs. Also done in a short amount of time, perfect for busy nights. I usually use a full pound of sausage, and double the pasta, water and tomatoes. I have used cavatappi pasta and also have also added sliced mushrooms.

This s great!  Super simple but very good. My 3 teenaged boys cleaned it up. We added some more cheese but it is good!  Definitely a new favorite.
