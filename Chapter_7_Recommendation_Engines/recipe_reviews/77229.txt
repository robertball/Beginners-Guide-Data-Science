Delicious pudding.  This worked very well in a traditional pudding form.  I noticed some of the reviewers had problems with the sauce.  I assume that is due to the wording "1 cup sweetened whipped cream".  I believe this should read "1 cup whipping cream" which is then to be added to the slightly browned butter-sugar mixture and THEN boiled.  Evaporated milk may be substituted for the cream, which lends a very delicious flavor....and this coming from a cream-lover!  Without a liquid, the butter-sugar mass will simply scorch.

I had to steam this well beyond the 2 hours, unfortunately, but I don't think that was due to any fault on the recipe's part.  I will make this again but, the next time, I will definitely add more fruit and omit the nutmeg in favour of either more cinnamon or perhaps some mixed spice as I'm not a big fan of nutmeg and I found it a bit dominant in this recipe.  In addition, the cranberries, although I had floured them, all migrated to the top of the basin whilst cooking which resulted in a rather uneven distribution of fruit throughout the pudd.  As for the sauce, I incorporated a 1/2 cup of double cream right into the sugar mixture before carefully reducing it to the consistency of a hard sauce.  The thick, exceedingly rich butterscotch of the sauce complimented the pudding perfectly.

Absolutely the best dessert I have ever had. I pick fresh cranberries every year and can't believe how delicious this was. I took this to work and everyone asked for the recipe. I'll make it again, and again.

This was unbelievable.  I wowed my entire extended family at Christmas dinner with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly -well, I coarsely chopped the crans first  to spread out the tartness a bit- and it came out perfectly.  The caramel sauce was amazing, it will be my new standard for sure (mine crystalized, but I just stirred in more cream to smooth it out.)  Pretty much everyone who has tried this has asked me for the recipe.

Really nice - used an antique pudding mold and did not have time for the sauce (used storebought - ugh), but the pudding is delightful.  Coarsely chopping the cranberries helps distribute the flavor.  Perfect ending to Christmas dinner!

I chose this recipe over the other cranberry puddings because of the ingredients - especially the cinnamon and nutmeg.  We love nutmeg, but 1 tsp. is WAY too much - will reduce to 1/4 tsp. next time.  Also experienced same problem as previous reviewer - my cranberries were clustered in the center.  Using a pudding mold instead of a casserole will probably solve this problem.  Will place a rack in bottom of stock pot next time.

This is very easy to make, only used 1/4 teaspoon numeg and added 1 teaspoon vanilla. Only boiled for 1 1/2 hours and was enough time. Turned out perfect.

Very good!  Next time I make it I'll only steam it for 1 hr. and 45 minutes.  I went the full 2 hours and it seemed alittle over cooked to me.  But, it was great.  Thanks you for a great recipe.

The cranberry pudding was great.  The sauce didn't turn out.  I will try it again next year.

Wow--SO EASY! This was the simplest batter to make; I melted the butter in the milk, and gave a few of the cranberries a rough chop just to distribute them better. Oh, and I added orange zest and cut back on the spices out of personal preference. I steamed this in a pressure cooker without sealing the lid for 15 minutes, then sealed it and steamed on high pressure for another 20 minutes.  I let the pressure come down naturally. I served it with the hard sauce, whipped cream, and candied orange slices.
