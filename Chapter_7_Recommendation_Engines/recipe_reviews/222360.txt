Don't be confused by the other review, or the directions. Use 3 chipotle peppers, not 3 cans of chipotle peppers. I also recommend making this in a crock pot or dutch oven at lower temp. Low and slow helps to moisten and keep it tender!!

After reading the other reviews.. I adjusted this recipe by doing the following. I blended 4 peppers ( from 1 can) 1/4 cup of the chipotle juice, 4 table spoons honey, doubled up on the worcestershire sauce and made a paste.. then  I mixed this with a dark beer ( the only one i had was a dark beer). 

I marinated the pork in 1/4  the sauce.. just enough to coat the 2 loins for 1 hour. Pan seared all sides.. on a really hot pan and then placed onions, carrots, small red potatoes in the pan with loins on top.. i poured over the remaining juice over the loins on the bed of veggies and covered with tin foil.. 350 for 35 min.. then uncovered for 10 and broiled for 5.. let rest for 15 min and it was delicious!!

This sounded amazing, and I wish it had been.  It was a very good flavor for marinade, but for some reason, it was still tough and even a bit dry.  I will watch more closely next time as we may have overcooked.  The leftovers with tacos sound awesome!

I can't believe all these people confused the recipe to read 3 cans of peppers - it plainly says 3 canned, which means they come in a can instead of a jar.  The writer of the recipe could have said - take 3 peppers out of 1 can of peppers, but I am sure that would probably have been confusing also.  BTW - I am a chef - maybe that makes a difference.

I tried this recipe and was disappointed. 3 cans of chipotles peppers were extremely hot( too hot to eat hot)! Unless you were to remove all seeds and that would have been an arduous task due to the sauce.  I also questioned to myself the temp and time.  375 degrees for 90 minutes??? My pork tenderloins came out tough as tough can be .  I was extremely disappointed. I would lower oven temp and time and change to 1 can of chipotle and 2 cans of mild chili's. Next time!!!

The directions are unclear.  Do I cook the pork in the marinade or toss the liquid and roast in a roasing pan?  I wish I had read this all the way through before.

Flavor was awesome. However, time needs to be adjusted. I cooked mine at 350 for an hour and a half and it was overlooked. I turned it over at 45 minutes and continuously basted it in the juices. It didn't come out dry, but could probably be cooked for an hour and 10 minutes tops.

I prepared the marinade per the recipe, and after tasting decided to add a couple eyeballed tablespoons each of honey mustard (to help emulsify the oil) and fresh cilantro.  After marinating for about an hour, we grilled the tenderloins (indirect heat) rather than roasting.  Heat from the chipotle was just right, but the flavor was only ok.  I think the beer watered the marinade down too much. Will likely use this recipe again as a starting point for tweaking and experimenting.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe calls for; I did allow it to marinate for an extra hour.  Unfortunately, the marinade neither penetrated nor coated the tenderloin.  There really was no flavor on the cooked meat.  I give it the second star because the meat itself came out fine, about medium and still tender.  Too bad, since chipotle and lime are such great flavorings.

After looking at the recipe and reading the reviews I decided to try this but I grilled it and adjusted the cooking time. I only did one tenderloin but used the recommended marinade in the recipe and it worked well. I did not use 3 cans though as some did ha ha.
I grilled it indirect at 350 degrees for about 30-35 minutes to a temperature of 140 degrees internal and let it rest for about 8 minutes. It was slightly pink inside but still tender. I would have preferred it to be a little more rare but overall pretty good.

All marinade with just the amount of spice to it.  Would be hot for people who do not like or can't tolerate hot foods.  Wendy

I added 2-3 tablespoons of honey and threw it in the slow cooker instead of the oven. It was awesomeee! Was not dry at all like some of the reveiws warned. 

I was trying to cheat by slow cooking it while it marinated to speed up the cooking process. It ended up cooking to temperature before I could oven it. Accidents make the best success sometimes!

Flavorless and the meat is too dry. 90 minutes is too long. I should have grilled it.

I followed the recipe but found the meat dry and flavor just so so.  Next time I'll decrease the beer to 10 oz., marinade in a plastic bag and decrease the cooking time to 30-35 minutes.  The recipe has potential; just have to find the right combination.

Disappointed. Seemed like a lot of work went into the marinade for such lackluster results. I'll go back to rubbing my pork tenderloins with pepper and garlic powder before grilling. And now I need to find a use for the leftover chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, which is something I don't usually keep on hand.

I had high hopes for this but have to say I was underwhelmed with the result. I didn't find that the pork had much flavour from the marinade. I cut up mini potatoes and mushrooms and cooked them in the pan with the pork with some of the marinade poured over it and the potatoes and mushrooms were more flavourful than the pork. I think there's potential in this recipe but am not sure what changes it needs.

Really great marinade. I did a few things different; added honey and extra lime. I used loin chops instead of a whole loin and grilled them. Came out awesome.

Bland Tasting.  Cooked it in foil on the Grill and it stayed moist but should have taken out of foil to brown it some at the end.  one hour @ 375 was fine.

Very good flavor from the marinade which I followed exactly.  Do watch how long you cook as 90 minutes is way too long.  I grilled it and it was done in about 20 minutes  and 10 minutes to rest

What kind of beer should I use with this?  And what would be a good substitute for beer?
