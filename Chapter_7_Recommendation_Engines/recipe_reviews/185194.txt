I tried this one, but find my old recipe easier and works better.  My changes - no oil necessary, use 10 candy canes instead and do not allow the first layer of chocolate to set before adding the white layer - this is what causes them to separate! I use about 12 oz of each chocolate and melt in the mirco in glass dishes.  First, melt the dark or milk chocolate, add extract if desired and pour into a foil lined pan, sprinkle with 1/3 of the crushed candy canes.  Refrigerate about 5 minutes while you melt the white chocolate, also in the micro but only half power for about 3 minutes. Pour the white choc over the top and then add the rest of the candy canes.  Be careful when spreading the white choc or you will end up swirling the 2 chocs together a bit and not have the pretty all-white top.Refrigerate for 2+ hours.  Turn upside down onto a towel and peel off the foil and break into pieces.  By breaking it from the back, you will not break as many of the candy canes on top.  Also, don't crush the candy canes too much or you will end up with powder instead of nice pieces.  Store in fridge.

This was so easy and fun to make! It tastes great and looks pretty.   I did do a few easy cheats. I used a bag of whilte chocolate chips and a bag of chocolate chips. I microwaved the chocolate. I put the oil and the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and cooked them for 1 minute on 50% power. Took it out and stirred it and put it in again for another 30 second or so on 50% power again. It came out really nice and smooth.

very easy to make, very yummy and a very good gift to give... I did do this as directed the first time but found a few changes couldn't hurt. I found that using candy canes gave it a much better look. it crushes more to the red side verses the round are more to the white. I also added in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract to give it a kick to the white chocolate mix after I had melted the chocolate. I also freeze it until I am ready to eat or give out as gifts and it tastes great! This is very simple, very easy to make. the price to make this is so much better then buying it to give out as gifts. When coming from your kitchen how can anyone not like it? Thank you for sharing this is a kepper that I will not use every holiday season.

YUMMY!!! I didn't have any mint extract, so when I crushed the candies, I sifted them and took all the crumbs that fell through and melted them with the white chocolate. Then I sprinkled the rest on top and it was delicious!

Delish! The only word of advice I would offer is that if you put peppermint pieces in between the layers, don't put many. I put a good amount in between the layers and when I went to break up the pieces the white chocolate layer came off from the semisweet layer. They still taste fabulous, but aren't all together liked planned. I can't wait to try it with milk chocolate as well!

I made this with 1/4 tsp peppermint extract only in the chocolate layer, and I thought that much extract alone is entirely too much. I tried a similar recipe with no extract, and it was perfect. If you don't really like peppermint (or the flavor of peppermint extract, for that matter), I STRONGLY recommend omitting the extract altogether. I do like the flavor of the semi-sweet chocolate with the white chocolate. I would give this five stars, but the peppermint extract flavor nearly ruined it for me. Definately five without the extract but three is being generous for the recipe as written. Another helpful hint, it doesn't specify but you need to either use the peppermint on the first layer sparingly or really press it into the semi-sweet chocolate layer. When I cut these, the two layers separated on several, which was pretty aggravating.

Yummy and easy to make!! It's also much cheaper than the kind made my Williams S*****!!!!   Tip: Spread the melted chocolate into a diposable aluminum pan. There will be no need to grease the pan and the bark will be easy to remove by slightly bending the pan. Also, use a pizza cutter to cut when the bark is not completely cooled solid.  Thank you for the great recipe idea!!

Great recipe! I used candy canes instead. I also halved the peppermint extract based on other reviews and I wish I hadn't. Next time I will use all of the peppermint extract and put it in the white chocolate layer only. Also, I only put the semisweet layer in the freezer while I melted the white chocolate and I didn't have any problems with them separating when I broke it apart. I will make this again!

I altered this recipe slightly as it was the basic recipe that I use to make homemade fudge every year during the holidays. I melted the first batch of semi-sweet chocolate added a can of sweetened condensed milk and some peppermint extract. I allowed it to see for about a half an hour to fourty minutes and worked on the second layer made of white chocolate. I prepared it the same way I did with the semi sweet and gently covered the first layer. The last or top layer was made with milk chocolate prepared the same way and spread gently over the white chocolate. I then chopped up a small box of candy canes and sprinkled them over the top. My husband loved it! By far this was the best fudge recipe I have ever made though it is extremely rich. I will definatly be making this again!

Its OK.  I am a huge peppermint bark fan and my favorite is the Williams-Sanoma brand, but its very expensive.  Don't use the oil or it won't set very well.  I prefer to use semi and white chocolate melts so they melt easy. The better quality chocolate you use the better, like the recipe states.  Use Peppermint OIL not extract if you want it PERFECT. Extract has alcohol and will cause it to become a little grainy.   Use 3-4 candy canes smashed in a plastic ziplock.  I also use a Mini crockpot to melt the chocolate, its so easy.

This was the easiest and yummiest recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and left the oil out.  After the chocolate layer was poured, I added the crushed candies and really pushed them in good, then popped in the freezer while I made the white chocolate.  After the white chocolate was melted, I added the remaining candies directly to the chocolate and poured slowly on top of the bottom layer.  I spread the white layer very slowly so as not to get the muddy effect some others have mentioned.  It turned out great!  No muddying, no separating and it is DELICIOUS!

Followed the instructions to a tee and it tastes wonderful! The white and milk chocolate still seem to separate when cutting but I don't mind. When I make again I'll try using a warm knife to cut into the bark. I'll be using this recipe for holiday gifts to my work clients. Thank you!

I have made this recipe for the past few years, and this years results were by far the best, following other comments I did not use the oil, I did not completely cool the first layer, it was only allowed to cool the time it took to melt the white chocolate.  I added the crushed candies to the top of the chocolate layer and also into the white chocolate and then sprinkled on top of the white chocolate layer as well.  I used a spatula to carefully spread the white chocolate layer and didn't have too much of a problem with the chocolate mixing in, best of all, I did 2 cookie sheets and both stayed together, in the past there was some separation of the 2 layers I think not completely cooling the first layer and the peppermint chips sprinkled on the bottom layer helped to keep the layers together.

I think this is a pretty good recipe.  I agree with another poster (wombat) that microwaving the chocolates worked best, therefore eliminating the use for the oil.  I only used the peppermint extract in the semi-sweet chocolate part, and left the white chocolate alone.  I also did not put crushed candy canes between the layers...only on top of the white chocolate layer. In order to keep the layers from separating, you need to only let the darker chocolate set for about 5-10 minutes in the freezer, and then pour the white chocolate on top.  Do not smooth it with a spoon or spatula.  Instead, gently shake the pan to cause the white chocolate to settle evenly.  One of my favorite ways to prepare this is by using the silicone mini-cupcake pans.  They will pop right out of the pan when completely done, and they make the perfect bite-sized "peppermint patty", which not only looks gorgeous displayed, but also for giving as a gift.  =)

Be sure to press the second layer down or you will have 2 separate barks that fall apart when you try to break it into pieces. Really, how good this recipe turns out is purely based on the quality of your ingredients.

Fantastic! I made this twice and it was a huge hit both times. I made a few changes: I replaced the canola oil with butter, and I doubled the amount of peppermint extract in the white chocolate (as someone else suggested). I used very high quality dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet, which my peppermint bark connoisseur friends said made it especially good. I also melted the white chocolate in the microwave, as sometimes white chocolate can be problematic on the stove top. I didn't have any problem at all with my layers separating, perhaps because I made sure to add the peppermint candy between them. I also think replacing the oil with butter might have helped. Thank you Andrea!

Like Hera, I forgot to add the crushed peppermint in between the layers but the end product is fanbulous and makes a very festive, sophisticated gift for the holidays. I had candy canes on hand so I crushed up enough to make 1/2 cup that got sprinkled on top once I poured the white chocolate on top of the dark chcocolate...mmmmm!

I made this for a Valentines treat to give to close friends.  I used a disposable pizza pan (sprayed with non stick cooking spray) and did not chill the first layer for very long, maybe less than 10 minutes, just as long as it took to do the white chocolate layer,  so the two layers would bond well, and they did.   I used the extract in only the semi-sweet layer.     Followed the suggestion to break from behind and it turned out ideally.  Rave reviews from those who received it.   Will be a holiday staple from here on.  Will definitely try it with cinnamon candy hearts next Valentines (without peppermint extract clearly), and with candy canes at Christmas

UPDATE: MY COLLEAGUE LOVED THIS! HE SAID IT WAS THE BEST HOMEMADE GIFT HE'S EVER RECEIVED. :) Yum! This tops Williams-Sonoma's bark (and is much cheaper to boot!). Every year, my ambitious plans to make homemade gifts falls by the wayside. I have been wanting to send my colleague an edible Christmas gift, but haven't had time to make one... until I thought of this recipe. This was super easy to prepare, and other than the time needed to harden, it was ready to package up in no time flat. To speed prep even further, I transferred my bark to the freezer. I spread both chocolate layers on half of a cookie sheet (to compensate for a 9x9 inch pan). Because I had no wax paper on hand, I covered my cookie sheet with lightly greased aluminum foil. Finally, instead of using my microwave, I melted my chocolates in a double boiler (I've never had luck with the micro method). My only other change was to not allow my first layer to completely set before spreading on the top layer. I wasn't particularly concerned about my chocolates mixing and actually thought they looked pretty when swirled together. Oh, and I made sure to use the smaller pieces of crushed peppermint for the middle layer so that my bark wouldn't separate. Red and green sugar crystals added a nice finishing touch. Thanks for sharing your idea, Andrea! :-)

Yummy.  I used peppermint essential oil (maybe about 10 drops in each type of chocolate) and crushed candy canes (12).  Easy.  Addictive.

Oil is not needed for this.  I use really high quality chocolate.  Do yourself a favor and use the microwave, there is much less room for error when melting the chocolate.

Love these!  I, too, left out the oil and they turned out wonderful.  I melted them in the microwave and it took literally minutes.  That being said, after the dark chocolate layer, keep in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes or you'll get the muddying everyone talks about.  I just put the white chocolate layer on carefully and moved it around like frosting on a cake since it didn't "pour".  I added red sprinkles to the peppermint on top and it was gorgeous for my Christmas cookie party!

I LOVE peppermint bark and this was a great hit with everyone around the holidays! It's so pretty but so easy to make. I liked one of the other reviewer's tips to sift out the smaller pieces of peppermint candy and use this for the layer in between and reserve the larger pieces for the top. I think I will be making this every year for the holidays! And maybe in between the holidays too. :)

This is so easy, yet delicious and very pretty on the dessert table! I followed the recipe as written except I did not let the the first layer chill for an hour. I put it in the freezer only as long as it took to melt the white chocolate. There were no problems with the layers separating even after the pieces had been sitting at room temp. for over an hour.

These are fabulous.  I tried a couple variations based on other reviewers and it's just going to depend on your own taste buds.  I didn't have any trouble with the choc layers separating, I put them together while the choc was still warm.

I love this recipe. I've been making peppermint bark for 20+ years now and have never tried making a layered bark like this one. It was a bit more time consuming, but the flavor and the raves from everyone convinced me that this is now the go-to recipe for peppermint bark. All recipients thought it was something I bought somewhere. A lot of people said they liked it far better than that from Williams-Sonoma. I think that's a pretty good reason to keep on making it. Thanks so much for submitting it Andrea.

**UPDATE: Made this again this year with some changes....only put 1/4 tsp of peppermint extract in the dark chocolate. Did not let the dark chocolate fully harden before pouring the white over (very carefully). Instead of candy canes (which are hard to bite into) I found the cutest sprinkles shaped like candy canes that were peppermint, so I sprinkled those on the white chocolate right after I poured it. Then I scored the bark while still cool/semi-warm with an ulu knife. There was NO separation of the layers this time!! :)** Original Review --> I made this recipe and it was great, but the semi-sweet and white chocolate layers separated when cut. I'd love a suggestion to make this not happen next time. I used candy canes instead of the round mints and I'd highly recommend that. Also, I find that the best way to crush the candy is to use the best tool in the house--my husband with a mallet! :)

Separation anxiety solved. I did a LOT of research on the separation issue and red a TON of reviews. Mine didn't have any issues (lie... I had a couple minor bits that separated). 

1) Control your TEMPER. When you melt it, the molecules get all crazy and you need to re-align them to make a bar. Tempering makes the chocolate harder and looks better. It's not hard, but you do need to use a candy thermometer to monitor it. This keeps the cocoa butter in the chocolate from "blooming" which means it moves to the surface creating a oily'ish layer that the white chocolate won't stick to. I probably butchered all that but here is an excellent article on it: http://www.craftybaking.com/howto/chocolate-temper-or-tempering-techniques

2) Build a mint bridge. After reading the reviews about too-hard candy, I used Bob's Sweet Stripes. They are more like a butter mint (not rock hard). I took the time to sift out the small parts and dust so that there wouldn't be a "dust" layer between the chocolates. Also, it looks better IMHO. when you press the candy into the chocolate, it bonds to it and the exposed parts are ready to latch onto the white layer. Guys... it's like rebar!

3) No oil. I'm sure it helps to smooth it but I thought it might not let it harden enough.

4) No refrigeration. Set it aside while you work on the white. When complete, just let it harden. Theory: the cold contracts the layer, let them cure at the same rate=better bond.

5) Score the back before breaking.

Made a couple of adjustments. Did not use peppermint oil and used candy canes instead. The white chocolate was difficult to spread on top of the chocolate without melting. When it came time to break the bark, it separated :( Still delicious!

I used a 12-ounce bag of semi sweet chocolate chips melted with 2 tsp. of shortening.  Poured it into a prepared  11 x 7 pyrex dish, popped into the refrigerator to allow it to set. While that was setting I melted 14 ounces of Bakers Premium White Chocolate (1 oz per square), I did not use shortening in the white chocolate.  I crushed 12 candy canes and set them aside. Removed semi sweet chocolate from the refrigerator and poured the white chocolate on top, spread it out and sprinkle the crushed candy canes on top. Very lightly patted the candy into the white chocolate layer. Returned it to the refrigerator to set up. I didn’t use peppermint extract, just allowed it to get its flavor from the candy. The layers will separate if handled to much so take that into consideration if you plan on giving it as a gift and take extra care with packaging. Looks very pretty and festive! Taste good too!

I had leftover candy canes from Christmas, so I used about 6 candy canes that I crushed up into a powder because my father can't chew through candy canes much anymore(though they are a bit harder to crush so make sure you have a clean counter top in case the bag gets holes). Be careful about breaking the bark because the chocolate is super cold, and you might accidentally get your fingers caught in the force and hurt yourself. Simple other than that. Also, make sure if you are using oil in this to let the layers set otherwise the white will start to melt the bottom layer and you won't get a nice white top. Keep the chocolates refrigerated when not being eaten.

Perfect amount of peppermint and chocolate. I use Giradelli for the  best bark! Next time I am going to use a larger pan, for thinner bark, since mine came out pretty thick. It was still delicious though!

Yum! This recpie has been in my family for years. The only thing is that we don't use oil. It's not necessary. We just simply melt semi-sweet chocolate, pour it into pan. Then melt white chocolate, and mix in some crushed candy canes. (Mainly the powder that comes from crushing them.) Pour the white on the semi... and sprinkle some larger chunks of candy cane on top. Voi-la!

I have made this a bunch of times for the holidays and it tastes great.  The only thing I change is I use the 12 oz bags of white and semi sweet chocolate and keep everything else the same.  So why am I giving this 3 stars?  Because it is a nightmare to cut. It is really frustrating when I spend a lot of time making something look nice only to cut it and have it fall apart. I have tried everything to prevent this, but have not found anything that works.

Really good recipe. I am not so much a fan of white chocolate, but others are and always appreciate this for the holidays. I didn't put candy cane in between the layers either-- I forgot!! And I also microwaved the chocolate-- much quicker and easier. I'd love to taste this with dark chocolate--mmmm!

This is really good and really easy. It is, of course, dependent on the quality of chocolate you use. I took some reviewers' advice and microwaved my chocolate. I very much enjoyed smashing the peppermints - it was therapeutic :-).

I make this every Christmas and the people I give it to always comment on how they like it.  I didn't like how the layers separated so I don't wait for the brown chocolate to harden.  I let it stiffen on the counter while I melt the white chocolate and then swirl them slightly before putting the peppermint candies on top.  I like how it looks slightly swirled and it also keeps the layers together.  It's better than Williams Sonoma's bark and a TON cheaper!

What's not to like.  This is easy to make and, unfortunately, so easy to eat.  I was using leftover amounts of both chocolate and white chocolate, so I just made a small amount and used crushed candy canes for the candies.  This stuff is addicting, so I am kind of glad I only have a little bit.  This would make a great Christmas gift put in a holiday bag.

I followed some of the other reviewer suggested which made this recipe quick and easy.  I took 12 oz bags of semi-sweet and white chocolate morsels heating them in the microwave separately and only cooling the bottom chocolate layer in the frig for 10 minutes before spreading the white layer.  I omitted the oil but kept everything else the same.  The final product tastes great!

Oh yeah, this rocks! I doubled, and placed in a 9x13 pan. I used candy canes, and had a tough time crushing them. I finally used a metal meat mallet to crush them! As others suggested, I sifted the peppermint pieces and placed the tiny ones between chocolate layers (not too many or the white chocolate won't stay in place). I then mixed the remaining tiny pieces into the white chocolate. Save yourself some waiting time and freeze the layers of chocolate. Make sure you wipe the outside of the double pan before pouring, or you may end up with drips of water on/in your chocolate.

i liked this recipe very much!  i made a test batch for Christmas gifts, and the only thing i didn't do that i should have was add candy pieces in between the layers - i think it will help the layers to stick together when cutting.

Made this for a dessert party and it turned out perfectly.  I love the two layers of crushed peppermint candies.  This turned out to be the best peppermint bark I've ever made.

Made this recently and everyone loved it!  Very easy.  No modifications needed.  I left mine in the fridge overnight and chopped it up the next morning.  It cracked perfectly with no separation between the layers.  Also, I used the microwave to melt the chocolate with no problems.  This will be one of my go-to holiday candy recipes from now on.

This is so easy and delightfully minty.  Also very festive looking and great for gift giving.  I experienced the dark and white chocolate layers separating on my last batch and have since learned that the first layer should not cool completely before pouring the 2nd layer.  I used the microwave to melt the chocolate.  1 minute the first round and then in 30 second intervals, stirring after each.  Will make this each year during the holidays now.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Okay, so let me tell you what NOT to do... Leave it to me to mess up such a simple recipe!  First of all, I decided from the get-go to double the recipe since I'm making this for several neighbors. This was mistake #1. When working with something like chocolate (and especially white chocolate) that hardens quickly after it's melted, it's best to work quickly and in small batches to decrease room for error. I did use the microwave to melt both chocolates and that ended up being fine. However, when I started pouring and spreading the chocolate is when the problems began. Do NOT use the Reynold's foil sheets side by side to line the baking sheet. As soon as I started spreading the first layer the foil sheets were sliding all over the place. Next time I will probably lightly oil the baking sheet (a much smaller one for a batch half the size, mind you. Next, do NOT try to get all sophisticated & buy the Andes peppermint baking chips. They are not the same as regular peppermints! They look like imitation bacon bits (rather than bakin' bits - ha!). To make matters worse, they are expensive! Stick with the cheap, festive candy canes or peppermints (which can be found in the bottom of Granny's purse, next to the butterscotch rounds). Lastly, of course I didn't wait long enough and got the muddy not-so-pretty marbled effect. At this point I gave up and dumped the rest of the peppermint baking chips on top because clearly, the only person stuck with this bark will be Santa on Xmas Eve!

Awesome recipe!  The tip of turning it upside down on a dish towel to break it up works very well.  Be sure to let the bottom layer set up before adding the white chocolate so it doesn't blend together and look ugly.  I used the powder from the crushed candy canes between the layers.  I had no problem with the layers separating.

I love this recipe. It is delicious. I have made it twice and each time with different toppings. The first time I did it with Nestle's white chips and the second with Ghirardeli's white chocolate. The first time with Nestle's the two layers connected beautifully. The second time I did have some trouble with the layer ends connecting but it seems that the bark broke better from the center.

This recipe did not work at all for me.  Putting a layer of peppermint in the middle is where it went wrong because I couldn't get the top layer of white chocolate to stick.  Too bad!  I was really looking forward to it.

Awesome recipe. my first time making peppermint bark and everyone loved it. No problems with the layers separating and I refrigerated for hours in between layers. I used candy canes to get more red coloring on top. I did struggle a little with the white chocolate in the double boiler, so I will use the microwave next time. I used the oil as the recipe stated and I think it helped the texture of the chocolate so it wasn't too hard to bite through both layers.

First of all, I didn't use 25 candy canes. I think I used 6 or 8 total! It was perfectly fine. I used sugar free dark chocolate for the first layer and I didn't add oil but I did add the peppermint extract (microwave 1 min, stir, microwave 30 seconds.)  Only chill dark for 10 mins @ most before adding white layer or the 2 layers will separate. Once finished to break up into pieces I put the whole bark in a gallon zip-lock back and dropped it on kitchen floor. There may be an easier way to break it up but that worked for me!

I as well used candy canes rather than peppermint rounds and it turned out even better. Also I stirred about a quarter of the smashed candy canes in with the white chocolate.But, as said in other reviews the peppermint bark does fall apart after it hardens, even if you pour the white chocolate on before it is completely set. Don't panick. All you have to do is place your hardened pepermint bark on wax paper, put this on a baking pan, set on stove top, and turn to low heat. After about a minute press gently on white chocolate until you see melted semisweet chocolate gush out from underneath. place this in the freezer for 1/2 an hour and then cut off the excess chocolate. Happy baking!!!

This was so delicious my husband has eaten almost the entire batch! We love the mix of semi-sweet chocolate and the minted white chocolate. I did not use any oil but instead used a can of sweetened condensed milk. I melted the chips with the sweetened milk together in the microwave. I also poured the second/white chocolate right on top of the chocolate layer without refridgerating it first. The layers never separated. I have taken the idea of combining two different fudge flavors and made a dark chocolate/cherry batch and a chocolate/peanut butter batch. Very easy recipe.

While this recipe does taste good, I am definitely sticking with my old peppermint bark standby from now on because taste and appearance is about all this one has going for it.  First, DON'T USE THE OIL!  I ruined an entire bag of chips by adding the oil.  After starting over after that fiasco, I found the white chocolate layer melted and smeared the bottom chocolate layer when you spread it on, giving the bark a "muddy" appearance.  Additionally, by not stirring the candy canes into the white chocolate, they fell off the top when I broke it up.  And lastly, it was so thick, my thumbs still hurt (two days later) from breaking these super thick chunks into too-large-to-eat pieces.  It almost required a hammer and chisel, not to mention eating it is somewhat difficult because it is so thick.  I advise the 1-layer standby.  Smash 1 candy-cane for every 2-oz of melted almond bark.  Melt almond bark until smooth over a double boiler.  When smooth, stir in candy and 1/2 tsp peppermint extract for every 12-oz almond bark.  Pour onto a buttered/greased foil-lined cookie sheet and let harden before breaking into nice, easy to nibble, sized pieces.    Forget the mess of this recipe.....the appearance isn't worth it

Very good!  Didn't let the semi-sweet harden completely before adding the white, so they wouldn't seperate later.  Didn't add extract or oil, used 7 candy canes, crushed instead of the candies.  My son loves this!

I love this recipe, and the only thing I would let people know is DO NOT use Ghirardelli white chocolate.  I have made this twice.  The first time I used Nestle chocolate and I had no trouble and ended up with picture-perfect bark.  However, the second time, I used Ghirardelli and the white chocolate began to harden before I was even finished spreading, and then began to melt the layer of dark chocolate.  As I spread the white, the dark began to swirl with it, making it look dirty.  It still tastes fine, but the elegance is gone.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but my layers split (despite carefully pressing the white chocolate on top). Also I have no idea whether I used the right amount of peppermint, because it calls for 25 peppermint candies without saying which kind of candies. Terrible. And it tastes bad too.

This is a great recipe! I used more white chocolate than dark chocolate and next time I will not use so many candy canes.

My Dad ADORED the peppermint bark - I thought it tasted excellent but did break up between layers.

Sorry to say, but we didn`t like this recipe at all. It was a waste of good ingredients for me. I like mint chocolate, I used only 20 peppermint candies, but the mint flavor was overpowering. The bark, especially white chocolate layer was too thick, it didn`t look beautiful.

Awesome!  I have made this recipe for 3 years now.  The first year that I made it, I took it in as gifts for my coworkers.  Now they ask me if I'm going to make them some peppermint bark again.  One of the newcomers came to me and told me that he had heard that I was an awesome candy maker.  This is the only candy that I had ever made for them...lol.  I received many compliments on it, including that it was much better than the Ghirardelli Peppermint bark and it reminded others of Ande's mints, only better.  Sam's club has Ghirardelli chocolate blocks, so I used that.  I didn't use the canola oil and I used crushed candy canes.  It's become a must have holiday recipe for me!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this.  I'm the "Christmas baker" for my huband's clients, his company, about 15 neighbors, and Christmas plus New Year's eve parties.  YES, I bake a ton around the holidays.  SO, when I find an easy yet really great recipe, I hold on to it.  This one is one of those.  The only change I make is leaving out the middle peppermint layer.  It is "too" much.  It is really really really good.  Just remember though--this is not one of those "if a little is good a LOT must be better" situations.  Not, I said.  It is great just as it is, maybe, 86 the middle layer of peppermint.  Keep it on the top for sho...Enjoy and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

I used 12 oz bags of Nestle Morsels, so I increased the oil and extract proportionally.  I nuked the chips on 50% power, first for 1 min, and then in 30 sec intervals, until I could mix them with a fork.  I had no problems with the bark seoarating, and I cut the pieces with a sharp knife warmed in hot water.  A big success and very easy...

This was spectacular! My husband couldn't stop munching on these yesterday. He's usually picky for ratings but he actually gave this one 5 stars, which actually says something! I used chocolate chips from our cupboard (so no cutting), and like 6 candy canes from our Christmas tree. One major substitution I made was due to improvisation since we could not find peppermint extract at the stores. I used corn syrup and put it in the saucepan on medium heat with the smallest crushed pieces and when it bubbled I took it off the heat and added it to the chocolate. It turned the syrup pink, but it did not change the color of the either chocolate whatsoever. I also just melted the chocolates on medium low heat, stirring constantly and watching carefully. If you do end up like me and have no extract, do the substitution beforehand because during the wait the chocolate was harder to manage. Overall though, spectacular recipe. This is probably going to become one of our Christmas staples from now on!

This was my first time making Peppermint Bark. This recipe was fast and easy. I think the hardest part was constantly stirring the chocolate to make sure it didn't burn. I didn't have pepp. extract, so tried what others recommended and used the dust of the crushed candy, instead. It turned out amazing and I've already made another batch!

This turned out pretty well for me! I got the white chocolate a little too hot, and I didn't spread it quickly enough, so it melted a bit too far down into the semi-sweet bottom layer. Because of that mistake, I ended up with a chocolaty swirl on the top in a few places. So, I'd recommend spreading the white chocolate on quickly to avoid this mess; don't let a big glob of it sit in one spot for more than a second!  I actually make this recipe with 12 ounces of both chocolates. Honestly, I find that the 1/4 Teaspoon of extract in each chocolate is a bit much, even though I used more chocolate than this recipe calls for. I'll be toning that down on my next batch.    But overall, I'm happy with how this turned out.

I used candy canes instead of peppermint rounds. I also used semi-sweet and white chocolate chips instead of high-quality candy bars simply for shopping convenience. Instead of using the 9x9 pan, I poured the melted chocolate on a wax paper covered cookie sheet. While this results in imperfect edges, my family is hardly the type to complain about chocolate!

The store was out of peppermint extract, so I just crushed the candies in the blender and mixed them directly into the chocolates.  Also, I missed the part about refrigerating the semi-sweet layer while preparing the white chocolate layer, so the final product ended up a bit... muddy.  But still delicious!

This is a good candy recipe.  I made the mistake of pulling the bottom layer out of the freezer and adding the top layer onto that...the layers didn't stick together.  I think next time I'll add the top layer while the bottom layer is still warm so that they will stick together better.

I used a 9 x 13 because I wanted my pieces to be a little thinner.  It turned out well. My chocolates didn't separate, I tried to not to get the chocolate to become completely hardened. I was a little soft, but not soft enough to run into the white chocolate when I poured it on.    I used candy canes.  Crush them small enough to chew.  I also sifted out the dust.    A little extra extract wouldn't hurt.  The recipe has a subtle minty taste.    Don't forget the grease and wax paper!  I did and it was a mess.  I read the recipe and then made the bark from "memory," or lack of memory!  I

Illegally delicious! I made this recipe to use up a bunch of old candy canes left over from Christmas.  A couple of changes that I made that I think are VERY USEFUL:

Just melt the chocolate in the microwave. There's absolutely no reason to use a double boiler, it's just extra work.

You don't need the peppermint extract, unless you really want the chocolate itself to taste like peppermint. The minty flavor with just the crushed candy, IMO, is enough.

Use milk chocolate. I used Hershey milk chocolate chips. 

I also discovered that you don't need to refrigerate each layer of chocolate for an hour. 15 minutes for me was just fine. The whole recipe took me an hour in total from start to finish.

Overall, this recipe is one of the most easy and delicious recipes I've ever made. Make it, you won't be able to stop eating!

This recipe turned out great! I DID NOT use any oil. I melted the chocolate on the stovetop and added the peppermint extract as written. After putting the first chocolate layer down, I refrigerated it for 5 minutes. Then I added a very thin layer of crushed candy cane. I mixed the rest of the crushed candy canes in with the melted white chocolate then added it on top of the milk chocolate layer. If you're careful, you can avoid blending the chocolate layers together. I froze the peppermint bark. To break apart, I turned the bark upsidedown and covered with wax paper then used a hammer. It worked great! Loved this recipe!

I made this exactly as written. It was during the holiday season, and naturally I gave it to neighbors and friends. Everyone RAVED about it. They had assumed I'd bought it, but when they found out I made it they were floored. It's not that hard. :) It's really fun and impresses friends and family!

I changed things a little bit based on other reviews. I added the peppermint oil only to the white chocolate. Instead of a 9x9 pan, I used a cookie sheet that I had lined with foil. Because it's Christmas time, I used candy canes (8 total) and stirred about 3/4 of the crushed pieces into the melted white chocolate. After spreading over the dark chocolate layer, a sprinkled the remaining candy to the top, and gentle pressed in. It came out just beautifully, and looks very festive. It also tastes wonderful. Cool mint and creamy chocolate. Perfect pairing. I plan on doing this again next year and giving as a gift.

Simple but delicious!
I microwaved both chocolates (but burnt them somehow) but it was still so good!! I added a teaspoon of peppermint extract to the white chocolate. Mmm. I didn't have trouble with the chocolates  separating & it all came out of the pan so easily.. Broke into pieces with no problems either. This will make a nice christmas gift :)

This is my favorite PEPPERMINT BARK.  Last time I made it, though, I should have crushed the peppermint for effectively.  My family asked that I pulverize the peppermint, and this is what I plan to do.  Everyone has his/her own expectations for peppermint bark, though.  It is difficult to fail IF you use the finest of ingredients.  Peppermint bark is only as good as the chocolate you use.

This is a excellent recipe and my first time making bark.  I did use candy canes instead of rounds since I had extras in the house.  At my husbands request I added about 1/3 tsp peppermint extract to each layer the second time I made it.  Yum.  Thank you for the great and flexible recipe.

I thought this recipe was great, and people loved it! I followed it the first time to a 'T', and it came out wonderfully! No separated layers or overpowering peppermint flavor. I agree the key is to use the higher-quality chocolates, such as Ghirardelli, which I used for both the semisweet and white. Also be sure to stir often when melting, making sure not to overheat the chocolate, and take it right off the heat as soon as it's melted.  I used candy canes, too.  My only complaint would be that after using the white chocolate as the top layer, It was virtually impossible to spread it evenly, and I ended up with dark and white swirls. It still looked pretty and it tasted fantastic. I'm trying something a little different with a second batch now, whereas I sprinkled crushed candy canes on the parchment paper first, poured the white chocolate over them for the bottom layer, and then drizzled the melted semisweet chocolate on top, finishing with more crushed candy canes. I think either way it will be delicious.

I've made this three years in a row and it's always a huge hit. I've made a few tweeks that seem to make it easier. Instead of melting the chocolate on the stove, I do so in the microwave stopping every 20-30 seconds to stir it. I've also found that a super quick way of crushing the candies is tossing them in a food processor. I've only been able to find pre-crushed candies once, so the food processor speeds things up a bit. Instead of using wax paper I use the paper cupcake cups so the pieces are even and in "personal" sizes. It works great for packaging them up and mailing them too! Overall, a good recipe that I plan on using for years to come!

Using wombat's suggestions, this turned out great! I used a shallow and small cookie sheet, lined it with tin foil, and froze it in between chocolate layers. I added peppermint extract to both the milk and white chocolate, and layered 11 crushed candy canes on each layer. I also used 24 oz of milk chocolate and 12 ounces of white. Looks great and tastes great!

So great for the holidays! I didn't find use for the oil as well, and instead of putting chunks of candycane ontop of the milk chocolate, I used the 'dust'/extremely fine pieces from breaking them up to mix in while the white chocolate melted. Larger pieces were put on top to finish.

Excellent and very easy!  I doubled the recipe and used a cookie sheet which was the perfect size.  I also used the microwave at 50% power to melt the chocolate.  I put the first layer of chocolate in the freezer for 10-15mins before adding the second.  I used what I had on hand... 12oz pkg semi-sweet morsels and three 1.5oz Hershey milk chocolate bars.  Second layer, I used 16oz of vanilla candy melts/morsels and 12 candy canes.  I sifted and stirred the small crumbs of crushed candy canes into the white layer before spreading and then topped with the remaining candy.  I plan to make this again and experiment with other flavors and candies.  Thanks for sharing!!

I took another users advice and did this in the microwave- about 3 mins on 50% power worked perfect.  I didn't add the peppermint extract cause I didn't want an overpowering flavor.  Will make again!

Delicious! I used 1 cup each of semi-sweet and white chocolate chips. I spread the chocolate on a wax paper lined cookie sheet and didn't sprinkle any candy canes between the layers. I mixed in a 1/4 cup of crushed candy canes into the white chocolate then spread that over the dark chocolate. You can make this really quick if you put the bark in the freezer to harden instead of the fridge. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used the microwave to melt my chocolate and accidentally put all of the peppermint extract in the white chocolate.  I also used candy canes instead of peppermint candies so it would be more colorful.  It turned out FABULOUS!

We love magic bars! They're so easy to make. We typically make ours without nuts and put the coconut on top so it gets toasted. We make them as a easy addition to whatever other Christmas cookies we make.

Used a cinnamon candy cane and replaced peppermint with cinnamon oil.  Layers 2 and 3 did not adhere, which made the cut pieces homely, as they cracked and some fell off.  Oh, well, folks at bridge, and spouse, helped me finish it off!

I LOVE peppermint bark. I cannot resist it. So I was really pleased to find this simple recipe. It was easy, and it turned out very well.   My only gripe is that it seemed to get very soft at room temperature. All the peppermint bark I've ever bought from a store didn't do that. I prefer it harder.

very easy to make and it came out delicious! I didn't use the oil or the peppermint extract but it still came out delicious! I used aluminum foil because I didn't have wax paper and it was easy to peel off. Only thing I'm going to change for next time is use more candy canes. I used 4 this time so maybe 1 or 2 more cause I like it kinda crunchy.

This was so easy and looks good too. I'm on my second batch this week.  Both times I doubled the recipe and used a cookie sheet with half inch sides. I used semi sweet chocolate and white chocolate chips. The oil is a must with the chips. Mini candy canes worked great for crushing.

This was easy to make. It didn't look right when I was putting the white chocolate over the dark but it turned out just fine.

This was fabulous!  The first batch I made exactly as instructed.  The second I used milk chocolate for the bottom layer and it was not as good as the semi-sweet chocolate.   I also just melted the chocolate in the microwave for the sake of ease and it worked just wonderfully!

I was a little worried trying this recipe as a beginner to cooking, but it came out perfect! My daughter loves peppermint bark and was beyond thrilled to make it with me :) I didn't have any problem with it seperating

Easy to make.  The chocolate separated from the white, but that's okay.  I ran my candy canes (8 large) through the food processor.

This was my first attempt at making "bark" and it turned out great.  I used some chocolate rabbits in my freezer that I melted down.  I used a bag of white chocolate chips and added some butter to make it more spreadable.  Smashed candy canes gave it more texture.

I made this and it was delicious. But could someone tell me how you break it apart? It was difficult to break by hand so I tried a big knife but then the layers came apart. I mixed the peppermints in with the white chocolate so I don't think that caused them to seperate. But it still tasted good, even though it came apart.

I just purchased bags of chocolate and warmed them up in the microwave and it turned out just as good. I also used candy canes cause that's what I had. Some of the pieces the two chocolates separated from eachother but most stayed together. This was very easy to make and didn't take a lot of time.

The peppermint didn't really stick to the top layer, well I lost half.  But the taste is good.  I think 24 candy canes are a little too much.

I microwaved the chocolates with the oil until melted and it came out great.  Took it to a party and got requests to make it as gifts.  The kids loved it too.

I remember my grandmother making this ...so I gave it a try, it tasted wonderful! I only sprinkled the candies on top of white layer and didn't sprinkle the crushed mints in the middle of the layers after reading other reviews on the bark separating, however it did still separate. Had it not done that, this would be gift quality tasting and appearance so next time (and I will try this again because it could be quite beautiful and it really does tastes very very good) I may pipe the white carefully onto the dark with a pastry bag before the dark chocolate is set completely. I'd like to hear how others accomplished making this candy without the layers separating. Thanks for sharing!

I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao chips for the chocolate, and they were wonderful. I tried both Ghiradelli and Nestle white chips. Both seemed to cook a bit, rather than just melting to a smooth consistency, but once poured, this "problem" disappeared. However, the white chips were thick and had to be spread, even with the addition of the oil. What this meant for me was the the hot white chips melted the top of the chocolate a bit, and my final product was dark brown with a very light brown top. Like others, I do not recommend putting peppermint pieces between the layers. I found that the white and dark layers sheered apart when I broke them if I did. Save the peppermint chunks for the top, and if your white layer turns a bit brown like mine, the peppermint pieces will help disguise it.

tastes wonderful, however my whiteanddark chocolate pieces kept separating. I thought that perhaps i let it set TOO much in between the two layers (not letting them melt together a tiny bit) or perhaps it wasn't as hard as I assumed.. But I saw another person noted that too many candy pieces between will make them separate and that may have been it. If I try this again I will only put the candy on top. But still great tasting!

I've never had this before so I can't compare it to anything, but it was delicious! I made it exactly as instructed using semisweet chocolate and only 6 oz of white chocolate (since I didn't have enough!) It came out pretty and perfect.

Loved this easy recipe!  I didn't have any trouble with the layers separating as some did.  Used candy canes as well which were festive and yummy.  Also, managed to get some nice Bernard Callebaut chocolate from the bulk section of our grocery store.  Definitely a new tradition in our house that will reappear in coming years.

Like another reviewer I didn't add the canola oil.  I didn't have peppermint extract but did have mint chips which I added to the white  chocolate.
They turned out great.

I thought I was being smart by doubling the recipe, thinking there might be a chance for some of the bark to survive til the next day.  WRONG!  It was there one minute, and gone the next.  Thank goodness it's any easy recipe to throw together, so no fear!  Melting the chocolates in the microwave speeds things along and makes clean-up a breeze.  My family's in the Peppermint Oil camp.  One last thing - smash those peppermints to small bits.

I do not put crushed peppermints between the chocolate layers because the layers separate too easily. I use half of the canola oil for the white chocolate or its too runny. Drizzle brown chocolate over the top for a pretty twist.

We love this recipe! I found it last year when I wanted to make peppermint bark. I decided to make it and give as part of a gift at Christmas for friends and family. Everyone loved it too! We prefer dark chocolate so I used dark in stead of the semi-sweet.

Overall, this recipe tasted pretty good. The only reason that I didn't add one star is because of the problem I had with baking it. First of all, when I tried to melt the chocolate it got this really weird consistency, kind of like a brownie. I watched the video and I don't think that was supposed to happen, then when I put it down on the waxed paper, it stuck to it and was hard to move without tearing the paper. I also used candy canes instead of the candies. When I put them on top of the chocolate and refrigerated them they didn't sink in, it might have been that I was supposed to pat them down I think they were just supposed to. The same thing that happened with dark chocolate happened with the white chocolate and this time I added some butter and I think that helped a little bit.  After that, I didn't have any problems. It tastes really good, it's not extremely sweet it's not very very dark chocolate. It's really good.

Followed directions - and only briefly refrigerated the chocolate layer before adding the white layer - but it still separated into two layers. Perhaps swirling the two layers together would prevent the separation next time. Tastes great though!

Great recipe. I followed some of the reviews and melted the chocolate in the microwave. I didn’t add any oil. I also put them in backing cups and after the white chocolate layer and peppermint hardened, removed from the wrapper.  Gave it a nice shape and it all stayed together.  So good.  Enjoy.

Made this exactly as stated - with dark chocolate and it was awesome.  However, one of my granddaughters does not like peppermint.  So I decided to try using cherry flavoured candy canes, and almond extract.  Turned out totally amazing!!  Unfortunately it disappears VERY quickly.  SOOOO yummy!!  I give it 10 stars!!

Super easy and very good. I left out the oil and mine was just fine. My only problem was that I didn't press the candy pieces into the white chocolate hard enough, because when I broke the bark up into pieces, the candy flew off! So learn from my mistake on that one...

I liked this Peppermint Bark.  Don't make the mistake I did.  I used the waxed paper, but didn't grease the pan or paper at all.  I had a hard time getting it out, even though I made the waxed paper larger than the pan...hoping to just pull up on the excess and pull the bark out easily.  Not so!  I had to put the pan on the stove burner to warm it up. Somewhat melting the bark a bit to get it out of the pan.  Of course then it had to go back into the refrigerator to harden up again. 
From now on, I'll pay more attention to the directions!  Otherwise, I used crushed candy canes and added a bit more peppermint extract to the semi-sweet (1/2 t.), and white (1/4 t.) chocolate layers.  It wasn't too much, it was just right. My white chocolate needed more canola oil to get the consistency just right. It looked just like the picture.  I would make this again.

I loved the flavor of this. Only hard part was getting the peppermint candies broken in small enough pieces that they were still pieces and not dust. Lots of compliments on it.

incredibly easy and delicious taste.  Is very minty  so for those who like less mint perhaps leave out the extract altogether or cut down on the amount used.

I read the reviews and chose not to chill bottom layer before adding top layer and they still separated when I was cutting them up. I used red and green peppermint on top, no peppermint extract. I just put the powder from crushing the candy into the semi sweet chocolate before microwaving. I put wax paper in a pan and sprayed it with Pam came off paper no problem. Tasty

While peppermint extract is affordable, I've found that substituting peppermint oil makes it much more flavorful. I also omit the canola oil. For each pound of chocolate, use 1 tablespoon (or more, to taste) of the peppermint oil. I've gotten rave reviews and many requests for this recipe, too!

We had fun making this and gave as gifts. It was delicious. We made a few modifications. We crushed candy canes in food processor until fine, but not dust. We didn't want to have to bite into huge chucks of candy cane. Did not use oil, and did not refrigerate for 1 hour. Only as long as it took to melt the white chocolate, until the dark chocolate was solid. We used a double boiler to melt the chocolate. We also did not use peppermint extract, and we had plenty of peppermint flavor from the candy canes.

I would not change a thing in this recipe. I added the extract for both the chocolate and white layers. It was the perfect amount of flavoring. I do recommend to take it out of the refrigerator to sit on the counter for 10 minutes or so before cutting. This helps to prevent the layers from splitting apart.

I Loved this recipe. My only issue with it was the fact that the ingredients are so expensive and the recipe makes so little. 
But as far as making it again, I will!

One of my favorite recipes at Christmas. Looks pretty and adds something different to a collection of cookies.

I used Lindt dark chocolate and white chocolate.  I only put peppermint extract  and the peppermint pieces (mini candy canes broken) in/on the white chocolate.  I melted in the microwave w/o oil.  Followed the suggestions of others and put dark chocolate layer in the freezer while melting the white and it firmed enough to add the white w/o muddling and no separation upon breaking.  My suggestions: use bigger pan (9x13) for thinner bark and use a little more white because it didn't reach the edges of the dark.   Amazing bark!!

We have made this every year (10 yrs now) for our Christmas baking. Now my 10 yr old daughter makes it on her own. She loves smashing the candy canes up for this one.  It is easy and so yummy. We melt down the chocolate in the microwave instead of using the stove.

Perfect.  I followed the recommendations:  candy canes instead of peppermint candy, let it set up in the frig for 15 minutes while working on the other layer, and peppermint in both layers.  Dark chocolate on the first layer is the bomb!!!!   Really must use dark chocolate first.

Took others advice & reduced the peppermint extract so it wouldn't be overpowering. Used candy canes instead of peppermint candies since I had them on hand.  Also did 12 oz semisweet choc & 4 oz white chocolate because I'm not a big fan of white chocolate.  I do the same with my Bailey's fudge - use more chocolate than white chocolate.

Use the tiny peppermint canes so you don't over whelm your on-the-fence-peppermint lovers. And use GOOD chocolates.

Simple to make, and gets rave reviews! I used 85% dark chocolate and used 12 ounces instead of 8, kept the white at 8 ounces. Used candy canes rather than the round candies. I cut into pieces rather than to break it up as I was afraid breaking it would dislodge the crushed candy cane.

I love anything chocolate & peppermint! I did add an extra layer of white chocolate over the first one due to me accidentally swirling the white chocolate & the dark chocolate on that second layer... Oops! But MORE chocolate is never a bad thing!

This is an excellent, simple, and beautiful treat to make for your friends and family at Christmas.  I have never made peppermint bark before, but this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I make lots of candy, cookies, and bread to give away at Christmas and this will be a standard from now on.  I like to make treats that are simple, delicious, inexpensive, yet special and this recipe fits all those criteria.  I knew from experience with mint extract that it is always better to use less than recommended in the recipe and I'm glad that I did.  I only used an 1/8 of a tsp. in the chocolate layer and none in the white chocolate layer.  This proved to be perfect for my family.  Personally I liked the batch that I made omitting the extract all together, as I think the candies add enough mint flavor, but my son preferred the first batch with the extract, as he is a major mint lover.  I allowed the first layer to cool in the refrigerator for over an hour before adding the second layer and it turned out perfect.  One tip I can share is when you are ready to break this into pieces let the tray set out on the counter for about 10-15 minutes.  It will soften just enough to make breaking much easier.  I think in the future I will try to double this recipe since it makes a very small batch and update my post with the results.

I made this last year and it was a great hit.  I didn't put candy between the layers for fear it wouldn't break apart right. I did freeze the chocolate layer while I melted the white chocolate for about 5 minutes.  I wouldn't recommend that, I'll put it in the fridge next time.  It actually was too cold and when I put the melted white chocolate on top, we had to move fast to press the candy canes into the bark.  I used about 6 crushed up candy canes for the top.   We doubled the peppermint extract (1/2 tsp. in each layer).  I used Crisco shortening instead of oil.  It melted the chocolate perfectly so it was easy to spread.  My daughter already wants to make this again for us to keep!

It turned out good, but make sure you don't wait for the dark chocolate to harden. Also, don't add any mint extract. I am eleven years old and was capable of making this treat just fine. :-)

This was easy and excellent.  I left out the oil altogether and used 12 oz bags each of semi-sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips.  I melted in the microwave in a big glass measuring cup/bowl per the directions on the packages.  The only thing I would do differently is to let the 1st layer of chocolate harden longer in the fridge.  I took the recommendations of other reviewers to take it out sooner and that didn't work too well.  The chocolate mixed with the white chocolate when I spread the white chocolate.  Sooooo, to fix it, I let the white chocolate harden completely, and I melted another 12 oz package of white chocolate and spread that over the other layer of white chocolate so it would look pretty and then pressed the crushed candy canes into that.  I thought the end result would be too thick, but it turned out PERFECTLY.  I took the peppermint bark to a party that night and people raved about how good it was.  In fact, people asked if they could take some home to their families.  I did use the peppermint extract and about 12 crushed candy canes.  Everything was just great and was very delicious.  Thank you.

I made this with my 9, 8 and 5 yo daughters. It was super simple the first time. The second time they mostly did it on their own. We made a white and milk chocolate swirl layer with spearmint candy on top.

One of the best things I've made! I used milk chocolate, and I may try semi sweet next time. And I don't have a double boiler, so I just used low heat to melt the chocolate.

I made this using  12 oz bags of semi-sweet and white chocolate chips and crushed candy canes from a bag to desire. I should have let the first layer set a little longer before adding the white chocolate layer. I used a double boiler to melt the chocolates and adding the oil and peppermint extract as per directions.

I did not use the oil or the peppermint extract and it turned out great!
Poured the melted semi-sweet chocolate and a sprinkling of candy cane in the pan and put it in the fridge while melting the white chocolate (about 10 minutes). Then immediately (ie did not wait an hour) poured the white chocolate on top with more candy cane. It set nicely together. Yum!

This was fantastic! My new Christmas treat! Made in a 9" round cake pan. Lined first with foil (over the sides), then a circle of waxed paper. I followed other's suggestions and did not use the oil. Used two 4 oz bars each of Ghirardelli semi-sweet and white chocolate. Melted in the microwave in 30 second increments on 50% power, stirring after each. My store did not have peppermint extract (!); took others ideas and stirred in some of the "dust" from the crushed candy canes--more in the white chocolate than the semi-sweet. Didn't use much candy between the layers--just a scattering. Only refrigerated the bottom layer for the time it took to melt the white chocolate. Followed other's suggestion and turned out upside down on a towel to break apart using my cooking mallet. Next time I will put a layer on top of the towel. A fair amount of candy cane stuck to the towel which made clean up a little more difficult. I chopped 10 candy canes; will cut it back to 9 to 9 1/2 the next time--and there will be a next time! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!
12/15/16: Made it this year with 2  3.5 oz Ghirardelli Intense Dark 72% cacao bars (what my shopper brought home). Added more candy cane "dust" to sweeten that a bit. Not a noticeable difference, but I think I prefer the semi-sweet. Next year, will try letting it warm to room temperature before breaking it apart (used the cooking mallet again, but still took a lot to break it apart.) Used 9 crushed candy canes.

This came out yummy! I prefer to not bite into huge chunks of hard candy so I literally crushed the candy into fine pieces and mixed that in for extra peppermint flavor. It's smooth when you bite into it and really easy to make. My only complaint is that it starts to melt around your fingers if you hold it for longer than a couple seconds.

Fabulous! I see other recipes for this online where people have trouble with the two layers sticking together. Have made this many times, following the directions exactly, (and watching the video) and have never had any trouble. If you buy Williams Sonoma's Peppermint Bark--you'll pay many times more than it costs to make it. I get the peppermint mints to crush at the Dollar Tree.

This was wonderful.  However, next time I will try using a bit less of each type of chocolate.  I thought it was a bit thick, and I prefer thinner bark.

I tried it with both Ghirardelli, using white and semi-sweet, and Guittard, using white and dark, plus both with and without food coloring attempting to make swirls.   It comes out much prettier without the food coloring.   I found that the Guittard chocolate hardened firmer than the Ghiradelli, may be the ingredients.   I liked the firmer version better, but that would be a matter of taste.  both were huge hits

Delicious, and so easy to make! Instead of putting broken up hard peppermint candies on top, I used some baking peppermint chips. They are softer and set better in the mixture for me. I don't like crunching on hard candy so the baking peppermint chips were a little softer on the teeth! Very delicious!

I halved the amount of the peppermint extract due to other reviews I read. I also didn't let the first chocolate layer to harden before adding the white chocolate. My bark didn't break off in layers by doing that. Really liked this!

We made this tonight, and it was so good! This recipe is easy to do, (my first time trying PB) and the only changes that I made was that I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate, and white chocolate chips versus the bars and they melted oerfect on the stove. Turned out great! We will make again!

This was delicious! I used an 8x8 pan and it came out perfect! I can't wait to make more and more batches. I did, though, use mint extract and it tasted great, except if you do use it, use a little less than the recipe calls for. Murry Christmas!

I have made this recipe 4 times this winter for our family and for teacher's gifts, tweaking it a bit each time.  The base recipe is great, but I would suggest some changes based upon my tinkering.  For ease, chocolates (semi-sweet and white) can be melted in the microwave per directions.  Also, I suggest using 1 tsp. oil for the white chocolate ONLY.  After preparing the dark chocolate, place in refrigerator for 10 minutes while preparing the white chocolate.  Letting it set too long is what causes the bark to separate when being broken apart.  The only other suggestion I have is to use 6 candy canes instead of peppermint candies.  Using too many candy cane pieces causes the bark to be abrasive when being eaten.

This recipe is great and I've already made it several times this Christmas season. It's so easy to do the first step, let it cool and then come back and do the second step. It makes for a very festive, yummy gift!

Per several reviews I made a few changes to make it worth the effort of two Hours.first,I made this with crushed candy canes not the peppermint candies.  And I used both white chocolate and dark chocolate chips 12oz.  instead of bar chocolate - in the microwave on the "melt" chocolate setting because I am simply not that patient while making 4 doz of the Sandy's  supreme sugar cookies, which also  turned out to be awesome.. Anyway, back to my point I chilled the first layer on wax paper with Pam sprayed on it to prevent sticking.
On a whim, I broke the candy canes into smaller pieces and popped in the manual food chopper. It created fairly uniform pices with some sugar dust.  Used a sifter to separate and put the small pieces on the first layer to avoid the challenge caused by too large pieces on the bottom layer. Used the larger pieces on the second layer to add pizazz and color. I highly recommend the use of a second layer of wax paper over the top of the finished product  to break the pieces and keep the candy bits from flying about the room.  We learned this the hard way, lol. 
The Big Guy immediately declared it as His! And put it in a container not to be shared as Xmas gifts...I think it was a huge success.. Total cost for 2 12 oz bags of chocolate and candy canes...5.60. Happiness of my hubby of 29 years? Priceless!

Used 8 oz. semi sweet for first layer, and 12 oz. white choc for second layer.  Used candy canes instead of peppermints.    Perfect!

Chocolate does not stick to waxed paper so there is no reason to grease the pan or the paper.  After sprinkling the crushed peppermint, I lightly pat it into the chocolate to ensure that it sticks.  I also took another reviewers advice and added the white chocolate about 10 minutes after the dark chocolate was in the refrigerator to keep the layers from separating.  Instead of worrying about wax paper crinkles using a 9x9 pan, I just spread the chocolate on a cookie sheet and break off irregular chunks.

We made this to put in our goodies gift bags for friends for Xmas. We did use foil pans for easy clean up, but realized that the foil doesn't let the choco get cold enough to really harden. So after it set up we took it out and chilled it in a plastic container with a lid. Worked great!

AMAZING peppermint bark recipe! :) Instead of crushed candy canes or mints I used Andes Peppermint Crunch Baking Chips which worked just as well, but gave the bark an overall softer texture since they're not hard candy. I also only put a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla in the semi-sweet layer, and none in the white chocolate layer. I added the chips in between the two layers, and made sure to gently pat them down into the chocolate. I put the bark in the freezer between layers and I had no problem with the layers separating. They taste so good! :)

I was distracted while making this, and messed the whole thing up, and it came out perfectly!  I failed to grease my glass dish and didn't line it with wax paper, I put the white chocolate layer on the bottom and forgot the mint extract, so I put 1/2 t. in the top dark chocolate layer.  It came out of the pan just fine after chilling in the fridge for an hour.  I used a 12 oz. bag of both white chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips, so I used an 8.5x11 inch pan. I also had a box of candy canes from last year, which I wanted to use up and that's why I chose this recipe.  About 10 canes crushed covered the top nicely. This is really yummy, and very simple to make.  This is definitely a repeat for Christmases to come.

Loved this! Used a 12 oz bag of dark chocolate for bottom, left out oil and peppermint, then used a 12 oz bag of white chips for the top (no oil again), didnt let the bottom layer cool too much before adding the second.  Next time i will a double batch it went very quick!!!!!

My 6 year old granddaughter discovered Peppermint Bark this year. She and I used this recipe to make our own. After reading many of the reviews and suggestions I decided to leave out the peppermint extract, as my granddaughter doesn't like things too minty. I also left out the oil. We used a combination of peppermint candy and candy canes. We shifted the powdered bits out of the crushed peppermints and mixed most of it in with the semi-sweet chocolate. We made a double batch and spread it thin in two pans. We added a little bit of the crushed peppermint on top of the semi-sweet chocolate and patted it in a bit. We let it sit at room temperature, about an hour later we melted the white chocolate, added the rest of the peppermint powder and a little bit of the crushed peppermints and spread it on top of the chocolate layer. I think if I had been doing this myself I might have been able to keep it from getting muddy, but with a 6 year old spreading the first pan wound up white with a light cocoa color swirled through it, the second pan was surprisingly less so but still muddy. We put the rest of the crushed peppermint on top, patted it down a bit, and put one in the freezer and one in the fridge. The next morning we took them out, turned them upside down on a dish towel and broke them into pieces. We had only a tiny bit of the white separate from the chocolate. The extra thin layers helped with both the breaking and eating. Turned out delicious! Will definitely be making again.

one thing that this recipe does not mention is that you can not just melt down white chocolate, you have to double boil whit chocolate very slowly and make sure no moister gets into the mix. Other wise this is a great recipe.

*Wonderful* holiday recipe! The main difference I did was double the peppermint extract just in the white chocolate, which I think helped give a better chocolate-peppermint balance (maybe that's just me). Also be sure to make the peppermint chunks fairly equal sizes; I've found too big of chunks can be a bit much. Definitely saving this one for next year! Thanks for sharing!

Recipe worked perfectly as is.  No breaking between the layers.  I would use candy canes instead of peppermint candies next time -- for smaller chunks.  I used higher end blocks of chocolate.

I followed the suggestions of others and just did this with Ghiradelli chocolate and white chips.  Adding half the extract to the white chocolate made it seem to clump and lose it's smoothness, so I would just put it in with the milk chocolate next time.  I didn't have any trouble  with the two layers coming apart and I left the milk chocolate in the fridge for a couple of days.  My hard earned advice is DON'T add milk to the white chocolate!  I ended with a clumped, nasty mess and had to start that layer over.

I wait all year for peppermint bark.  It is my favorite candy.  This recipe turned out fantastic.  I lined and 8x8 pan with glad press and seal wrap, and it was really easy to remove the candy.  I turned the pan over and pealed away the wrap.  I thought the 8x8 made the candy a little too thick so I will probably use a larger pan next time.  I also had to use mint extract not peppermint because that is what I had.  I just added a little extra to the white chocolate and it was perfect.  I used 12 candy canes instead of the peppermint candies. I also turned the candy over and broke it up from underneath.  This worked great.  Loved this recipe!!

The taste was very good.  But there needs to be a changed because if you make it as stated, the bottom chocolate layer and top white chocolate layer when you try to break it into pieces.  The only thing I can think of is to not refrigerate the first layer before putting the second layer on.  I will try another small batch to see if this helps.  Also, I found that I needed to make more white chocolate than indicated to fully cover the dark chocolate.

Not too impressed. The white chocolate is not too good if you don't like white chocolate. Be better to add 1 tsp peppermint extract to take away the pasty flavor of the white chocolate.

This turned out delicious! For the chocolate, I did half Baker's semi-sweet and half Baker's German's sweet chocolate. I didn't put the candy pieces between the layers, only because I forgot to. I used the mini candy canes and crushed them up in my food processor. I took the fine candy pieces/powder and melted that in my chocolates. This will now be my go to recipe for Peppermint Bark. Thank you for sharing, Andrea.

Delicious! Perfect for gifting and people are always impressed. I only put the candy on top instead of in the middle to make sure it wouldn't separate the layers. This is as good as Wm. Sonoma's!

I used dark chocolate on the bottom, didn't use the oil and melted the chocolates in the microwave. It came out great! I slid the trays in our garage freezer because that is where I had room and they were fine there (even staying in overnight). I also stirred in the candy before spreading the white chocolate and that worked fine. I made a bunch of trays and found that the thinner the bark the more likely the two chocolates were to slide apart, but it still tasted great! I know there is a way to prevent this with tempering and types of chocolate, but I didn't find it necessary to go to that much effort. I made this for a neighborhood cookie swap and it was a hit.

Love this recipe! it turned our perfect, I doubled recipe and used a 9x13 cookie sheet and the thickness was perfect!!! I put in fridge after the first layer whileI melted the white chocolate. After adding the 2nd layer and peppermint crumbles, I put in the freezer for another 1 1\2 hours, then i twisted the pan to get the sheet of chocolate loose. I then used my hands to break into uneven pieces to look like "bark". I have saved this recipe and will use again next year for sure!

I was so excited that this recipe was so simple! I used Ghiradelli baking bars broken into chunks, and heated in the microwave at 50% power, stirring every 20-30 seconds until melted, and only added peppermint extract to the semisweet. I also had a lot of power from letting the kids crush the candy canes, so I sprinkled it between the layers, which I think caused the layers to split more when I broke the pieces. 

I also used foil to line the pan, which was perfect as I was able to lift the entire thing out very easily. Love this recipe and will definitely make again!

This was outstanding!  I increased the yield slightly by using 12oz packages of chocolate and made it in a 9x13 pan.  I read the recipe wrong and put it in the freezer in between, which actually turned out great b/c I was able to add the second layer 15 mins instead of an hour later.  Do thaw it a bit before you attempt to cut it to make it easier.  Thanks for the great recipe!
