Made this this weekend and it was FABULOUS! Used a Sweet Red, made it in a ziploc gallon size bag (easily will hold double batch) and filled the empty lemonade can with water, no need to measure. Poured it all in the ziploc bag , mushed it together and let it freeze. I would recommend a double batch! It goes fast!

WHYYYY didn't I make a double batch of this right away??? This stuff is so much better than I expected. I don't really love sweet wines, so I used a dry Cabernet Sauvignon, and it was perfect.
