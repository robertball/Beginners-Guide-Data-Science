This rating is for the video not the fries.  One of my favorite Chef John videos.  The man is human.

I didn't make this but had to give it a star just to send in this review!  Listening to the "how-to" video was worth the time!  Thanks for making me laugh and for the honest review.

Watch Chef John's video, his running commentary is pretty darn funny!
