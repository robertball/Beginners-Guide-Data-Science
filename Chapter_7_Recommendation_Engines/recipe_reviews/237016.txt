Way to many plums 15 are enough and for the crumbles use only 1/3 of the ingredients. Otherwise it's good. I did add some cinnamon into the crumble mix.

I altered the recipe slightly by using cake flours, less butter and sugar. Excellent!

It was so Yummy! The bottom crust was more like a cookie. Using 1/3 of crumble mixture worked better. I also used half whole-wheat flour. I would make it again. Forgot to take a photo before they were devoured.

I liked it but it was dry. Ice cream helped.

This didn't turn out for me - measurements seem off - the crumble in particular. I think it should be 1 cup flour. The cake layer was odd - sort of a cookie but not cakey at all, which I was going for. Hour and a half cooking time is way too much - my bottom crust was starting to burn after 45 minutes.

I'm confused about the portions and the bake time on this one.  I wanted to make 2 so I doubled the recipe, but when I put it into the pans I realized I only had enough to really fill ONE jelly roll pan?  I semi-quartered 11 plums which was the perfect amount for my pan.  The crumb topping was not at all like I remember my German mother's crumb topping.The other thing that REALLY seems off is that my cake started to BURN on the bottom in just under an hour.  How could anyone  bake this for an hour and a half?!!  My oven never has any issues with other recipe bake times, so I don't think it has anything to do with that.  Honestly, I was confused as soon as I read the instructions to bake it that long.  I should have followed my instincts.  Instead, I had to wait to smell burning cake in my house to actually go take it out.  Then I had to cut the bottom burnt part off the entire cake.  Those who tried this seemed to enjoy it, but I know I should be able to make something much better.  And without so much of a hassle.
