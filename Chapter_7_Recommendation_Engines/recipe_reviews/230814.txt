Gravy is just right. Not too thick or thin. I added some sauted mushrooms and onions. Over the Pillsbury Grand Biscuits and my southern raised husband gave it a 2 thumbs up.

FANTASTIC even good for a new cook. I had sausage, biscuits and gravy a long time ago while I was on the road. I always tried to find a place that made it like that again but never could. I have never tried making brown gravy before and was skeptical about trying. This recipe was PERFECT and I even forgot to add the tsp of butter. My family went nuts over it. Thank you for the great recipe addition!

WOW!! This was really good stuff.  Make sure you get MAPLE sausage for a terrific flavor.  Good thing I wasn't alone or I would have eaten it all myself!  Amazing!!!  UPDATE: If you don't have maple sausage you could add a little syrup to the sausage to give it the maple flavor.

This was so amazing! I made it for my family yesterday and they all loved it. My little brother kept saying that he wasn't going to eat it because he HATES gravy (he's only eaten the canned gravy which isn't the best). I made him try just a little bit and he ate so much because he thought it was delicious. I will definitely be using this recipe again. THANKS SO MUCH! :)

This recipe was great! My mom always made biscuits and gravy on Sunday when I was younger so it really reminds me of home. I’ve tried different biscuits and gravy recipes over the years and they’ve never really been too flavorful or they would be too runny. This was really perfect. I was worried it was too runny at first but once you crank that heat up and keep stirring, it thickens nicely. The only thing I changed was adding more pepper. We really like that hot, peppery flavor so I add it while cooking the pork and add it while gravy was thickening. Really good! My search for a good gravy recipe ends here!

This is excellent. I tried it tonight for the first time & my husbands eyes rolled to heaven. I used what I had which was bisquick biscuits, oh so tender & delicious, A breakfast sausage that was savory, I did not add the maple syrup as was suggested because I do not like maple syrup, not even on pancakes, & 1/2 cup of half & half & 2 cups of milk. It was the perfect consistency & the tsp of butter added more richness to it. We loved it & my honey said it was a keeper...Ladynightmare

Found that this calls for too much milk after the can of evaporated - too late to save it, so had to add quite a bit of flour to make it thicken, which changed the flavor.  Tried it again on another weekend, adding only 1/2 cup milk after the evaporated milk, which was just right.  Also, added the butter before adding the flour.  As written, however, we found it too thin and milky, tasting more like that from a restaurant trying to cut corners and stretch the sausage for more servings.

I don't change a thing and I have made this MANY times.  It is perfect!  The evaporated milk and BUTTER make this a creamy, rich gravy  as it should be.  So simple.....I've used all types of sausage....prefer Bob Evan's tube sausage but in a pinch I have used precooked sausage patties and chopped them up finely.  I have even made triple batches and put them in a plastic container for my husband to take to deer camp......they all RAVED about it.  For those that feel this is too thin....be sure to let in simmer down to the consistency they like.  No need to add additional flour.  Thank you for the AWESOME recipe.  It is the only recipe I will use.....why change perfection!

We did not like this.  It must be the evaporated milk and maple sausage.  Traditional is the way to go and I'm back to my old favorite.  Pork sausage, butter, flour, milk, salt and pepper is all you need.

I noticed a complaint about taste. If you end up with gravy that tastes like flour, you haven't cooked the meat/ flour  long enough for the flavor to meld. It's just like making a roux. the extra minute or two can completely change the taste, giving it a bit nuttier flavor. It's just me, but I also add a pinch of cayenne pepper to add a slight bite, without being too strong.

I made this recipes for a bunch of hungry construction  guys working on my garage.  They said it was the best biscuts and gravy they ever had.  Better than their moms. Did not change a thing everything was perfect.  Take the time to make the gravy thick.  Thank you for a great breakfast

Love love this dish! I have made this for breakfast and when we are in the mood for breakfast for dinner.  I agree that maple is the best choice but I have used sage and once I did spicy.  I like using jimmy dean 1lb chubs but I will use what is in my freezer.  It is this recipe I follow for my family! Thank you for sharing it!

I made this for dinner tonight. It came out EXCELLENT! So delicious! I did make a few alterations to this. The 3 tablespoons of flour wasn't enough to thicken. So had to add extra. But i bought extra milk and evaporated milk to accommodate the extra flour. Balances out well and it's mouth watering goodness. I also doubled the ingredients to make quite a bit. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe. I will be using it again and this is so simple to make! Will be passing it on to my kids when they get older.

I was raised in Chattanooga Tennessee. I currently live in Pennsylvania. I was hankering so bad for a good ole southern breakfast (eggs, bacon, buttermilk biscuits, grits, and sausage gravy)! I couldn't remember the recipe! Thank you for this one! It tasted just as I remembered from down south! Brought me back to my roots and warmed my soul!!!!

I figure I will add this comment instead of making any changes to my recipe (as its posted) on this site....  not sure why the recipe suggests southern style FLAKY biscuits.  (That was not my intent).   I would encourage you to use Pillsbury's Southern Style - but NOT the flaky layer biscuits.  But if you can get your hands on some legitimate Buttermilk Biscuits... well the you can pass those Pillsbury biscuits right by.   Also, you can use any sausage you like.  And just to be clear - EVAPORATED milk.  I saw one individual made the unfortunate mistake of using Sweetened CONDENSED milk.  I can't even imagine what that first bite tasted like. In any event, I'm glad that you've discovered this recipe and that it has been enjoyed by so many. :)

This was amazing.  For years, I have used my tried and true gravy recipe and it was always good but this is every bit as good and so super easy.  It was literally 15 minutes from raw sausage to finished gravy.  This is my new biscuit and gravy recipe for sure.

I've never had something like this, and I enjoyed it. I did reduce the serving to two, using a 6-oz pkg of maple sausages. I cooked them from frozen per the package, adding 2 tblsp of water, and they were ready in 5 min. I used a wooden spoon to break them up a bit. Since the serving was small, I didn't want to open a can of evaporated milk, so I just used 2% milk, and it worked fine. I had ready-made biscuits on hand, so I went with that. This is something I would make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious, I do use the regular or even spicy sausage instead of maple and a little extra milk to thin it out. The evaporated milk gives it a beautiful creamy texture that my family loves.

I live in NC and my husband introduced me to a place that served authentic biscuits and gravy and I have made it my mission to master it every since. This recipe is the bomb as is. I like to use Neese country sausage to make it!

I have never made this before but really simple to do and great.   I stuck to the recipe but added extra black pepper in the gravy.  It went over big with my family.   I did cheat and bought pillsbury biscuits.

This was just what I was looking for.  I used regular sausage and added diced onions to the sausage  when i was frying it up.  I also added Badia complete seasoning and some hot sauce to mix.  Put the gravy over toast and it was delicious.  I've made this a couple of times now

I thought it was going to be too  soupy so added a little more flour,  ended up too dry but had delicious flavor.  Will make again.

A delicious recipe! The Pillsbury Grand biscuits are the way to go. I tried it with both the Grand biscuits and the chain-store brand and the texture was quite different.  The Pillsbury biscuits were WAY better in this scenario.

This was so delicious!!! I will definitely make it again. I cooked it a little too long though, so it was thicker and it took a while to get it to thicken up. I didn't realize it but I used 4 tablespoons of flour instead of 3 as well.  I also used turkey sausage and cooked it in maple syrup to get the maple flavor, it was scrumptious!

Very versatile recipe, you can add more milk for thinner gravy or simmer longer for thicker gravy.  Use different sausage to fit your taste.  
Family LOVED this, I've made three times since I found it on this site.  Freezes well, IF you have any leftover :)

This is a keeper for us!  I used 24 oz. of breakfast sausage, (with about 1/4 t. sage), because we like lots of sausage in our gravy.  Otherwise, it's perfect.

This was delicious!!! Next time I will not add any salt at all as the sausage already has enough salt!!! I made a half batch as I was the only one eating it!! I used regular  sausage so I added a little bit of pancake syrup to the mix while cooking and it worked nicely!! I'll be making this a lot now!!! Thanks!!

Loved this!  Had to substitute corn starch for flour since I forgot I was out, but it turned out great anyway.  Just had to add the corn starch at the end (half the amount of the flour), and mixed it with a bit of the cold milk before adding to the rest.  But it turned out really great.

I’ve been fix’n sausage gravy for years. I leave out the evaporated milk and butter. I prefer whole milk but 2% works. Before I add the flour I season the sausage with a teaspoon of Lowery’s seasoned salt. This gives it a unique taste. And, I stay away from flaky biscuits. I go with Pillsbury Southern style biscuits. I slice a biscuit in half, top with two scrambled eggs and smother in sausage gravy. It is without doubt delicious. That is my Country Scramble.

Looks good. I use half and half instead of milk in my recipe along with regular breakfast sausage. Occasionally I'll toss in a little ham flavored soup base if the sausage does not  produce enough flavor.

Make biscuits with Carb quick complete  baking mix ( 99% fewer car's than other leading brand)use coconut milk for carnations milk  and  almond flour for regular flour.  And get a breakfest sausage that's made by Morning Star.  Make a KETO biscuit gravy.  Lot less sugar but just as yimmy

Perfect sausage gravy. Made exactly as written. Let simmer for at least 5 minutes after adding liquids. Added additional pepper. Used Jimmy Deans Maple sausage. Will try this with original or sage next time as I'm not a sweet maple sausage kind of girl. Had enough to freeze for another breakfast.

To be honest, I never ate sausage gray and biscuits before. I thought it was way too sweet - probably because of the maple sausage that was recommended. My husband does order sausage gravy and biscuits sometimes when we go out for brunch. He said it was OK and he would eat it again but he certainly did not rave about it. IF I ever make this again, I think I will try subbing half an half for the evaporated milk and milk and maybe try it with a sage sausage.

The gravy came out tasting fantastic on top of the flaky buttermilk biscuits and the maple sausage created a more savoring flavor compared to regular sausage. I love this recipe and will absolutely make this again!

I had pork sausage on hand so used that.  I didn't have evaporated milk so I used sour cream instead. It was really rich and yummy!!

I really wanted to like this but found the gravy too thin and did not enjoy the sweetness of maple In the sausage.  However I made this again but used sage sausage, reduced the amount of milk and loved it.

Really exceptional -  others say it's too runny, I didn't think so at all.  Gravy was perfect consistency, great flavor. Perfect for a special breakfast!

My new go-to recipe for sausage gravy. The evaporated milk is key.  Granted I used hot sausage not maple but with gravy the consistency and texture is key. Use whatever breakfast sausage you like but this is silky and perfect in its “bite” - velvety and not pasty.  Definitely a company recipe but five stars plus!

This recipe is spot on. We are from the south and it is always a favorite when I fix it for breakfast. I have tried with the maple sausage but prefer hot sausage from a local butcher. Either way it is amazing, thanks for sharing your recipe!

Both my son and I have dietary issues which cause us to make a lot of substitutions in recipes.  This was very easy to make and the evaporated milk made this a must try for me.  I substituted Bob's Red Mill rice & wheat free flour for regular flour and used cashew milk instead of regular milk.  These 2 items change the flavor profile the slightest of any other type flour/milk substitute I have tried.  Also added extra pepper & added small amount of red pepper flakes to go with spicy sausage as we LOVE spicy food.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

For whatever reason I didn't think the flour was enough so I added a little extra. I ended up with some pretty thick gravy but the flavor was great. Will follow recipe exactly next time.

Absolutely loved it made this gluten free using a gluten free blend Namaste from Costco.  Made 1/2 of recipe for just husband and I also used the biscuit recipe from the flour blend for homemade biscuits.  Next time will add a little sauteed onion with sausage just a taste preference.

I made breakfast one morning. We were having my daughter and son in law over, and I wanted to do something different. So I made this recipe with homemade hash browns. Was a complete success. They went home with the rest. And the next day, my daughter asked me for my recipe. #girldaf.

My family loves this, especially with the Maple Breakfast Sausage recipe from this site. I make this as written, except I usually use the Pillsbury Southern Homestyle buttermilk biscuits. This reheats well; just add more milk to thin it out. Thanks very much for the recipe!

Messed up and submitted my other review before I finished writing it!    I used regular bkfst sausage (not maple).  Didn’t add salt (Didn’t think it needed it).  Added a small of amount of white pepper (no black).   I cooked the sausage until it was really brown and crumbly and turned the burner on high to get some of it to stick so I could scrape it off and create some flavor for the gravy.   I cooked the flour in the meat for about five minutes before adding the milk.   It was really good.  But my kids still wouldn’t eat it!!

Turned out great with perfect texture, however I would like to try again without maple sausage as I feel it tasted a tad too sweet.

Family liked it, I let it get too thick though.  I should have used all milk and maybe less flour.

Just about the same as the way that I make Sausage Gravy.  We always use HOT sausage, grated onion, flour, canned milk.  Make the rou, add more milk, butter as needed.  Plenty of black pepper, salt to taste.  Such an easy recipe, just flour, sausage, grease, milk, pretty much.  Use the biscuits that you like, doesn't have to be what is recommended.

It was very good, my only change is the biscuit, I recommend to use the original biscuit. The one in the recipe is to sweet.

This is ALMOST the gravy I've made for 40 years.  ALMOST because I agree with others that said the maple sausage is too sweet.  The one thing I do differently than these directions suggest is that I allow the sausage to fry in the pan until some of it is almost too done.  The darker 'bits' give the gravy a little more color and at least IMO, the sausage flavor becomes even more pronounced.  Good recipe, but I'll stick to non maple sausage and cooking it to WELL DONE.

One of my favorites.  Shouldn't the title be "biscuits and sausage gravy" not sausage biscuits . . .?

I make this exactly how it is written.  Only substitution is I use the original southern style biscuits from Pillsbury.  I don't care for the flaky style.  Everything goes with this recipe!

This would be much better with homemade "scratch" biscuits.

Made this for my boyfriend for our anniversary breakfast. He likes his gravy on the thicker side so I simply added more flour. He loved it and so did I!

Way to sweet. It was actually sickly sweet. The condensed milk mixed with the maple flavored sausage is to much.

I'm not a huge biscuit and gravy fan, but made still really liked this. Good consistency. Made for someone who LOVES biscuits and gravy and he only seemed lukewarm on this.
