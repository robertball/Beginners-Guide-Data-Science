Although I had to substitute kidney beans for the chickpeas, this came out great. One very important step in working with eggplant is to sprinkle the cut sides lightly with salt, cover with a clean tea towel and weight it with a large bowl or pot in a colander over a dish, for about 30 minutes. This will "weep" out any bitterness in the eggplant. No need to add salt, of course, if you "weep" it this way. My DH, who had never had eggplant before -- being rural Saskatchewan, produce not grown in local gardens is just starting to come into the stores -- loved it, asked for seconds, and has already requested that I place a special order with our produce manager, if that's what it takes to make sure we get in eggplant as often as it is available.

This was delicious! I added in some peas and black beans because they were jsut lying around the fridge. There were no garbanzo beans in the cubboard, so I used kidney beans. I love the rosemary in this stew! I added in about a cup of water just to thin the consistancy a tiny bit. Personally, I thought it was delicious  even after I had eaten all the ggplant chunks in my bowl and only the rest remained. Thanks for a keeper!

Easy and tastes great. We had green peppers and egg plants coming out of our ears this year and this recipe was perfect. The fresh herbs and veggies from the organic garden made it. I also canned it in hopes of enjoying it later this year. Additional note: This cooks really fast so I would suggest chopping everything before cooking so as not to over cook anything. 
Enjoy.

Really easy and flavorful.  Used dried rosemary and parsley, omitted the pepper and added celery.  Served over couscous.  I bet it would be great with fresh herbs.  Would make again.

WOW...this was really good. I am usually so lost when it comes to EGGPLANT...figured i would give it a shot. I substituted a few items because i didn't have them in the house when i was preparing. Instead of mushrooms, i used Zuchinni and for the can of crushed tomatoes....i used Diced tomatoes with the roasted onion and garlic already included. When all was said and done the calories of this recipe was almost exact with my substitutions. (115 calories/ 5 proteins per 7.2oz serving) YUMMY!!!

Very tasty and very easy to make. It made a filling but healthy vegetarian meal - I served it in bowls with warm, crusty bread and garlic olive dipping oil on the side.

Great flavor but not a stew in my view.  Tastes very much like Italian Caponata, but not stew.

loved this recipe. I did not have red onion (hate it), chickpeas, fresh rosemary or fresh parsley: I subbed in yellow onion, red kidney beans, dried parsley, then tossed in a yellow squash that was looking mutinous in the crisper - the squash added great color. I went light on the olives (1/4 cup) only b/c I got tried of pitting them (bought the wrong bottle). yummy!! love this.

Made this last night for my mother and fiance. It was my first time cooking eggplant and their first time eating it. I did not have rosemary or parsley which made the meal kind of bland (no one's fault but my own). I did weep the eggplant for about 45 minutes prior to cooking. Overall it is a great base recipe that I will be using again in the future.

This was delicious! I left out the stewed tomatoes because I don't like them. I also left out the olives because i didn't have them, but I will add them in next time. I also added a couple of shakes of cumin to the vegetables and I roasted the vegetables on a cookie sheet at 450 for about 45 minutes instead of the stove top. It came out delicious!

I really liked this recipe. I used medium sized eggplants, 1 pound of mushrooms and 3 Italian frying peppers (cubanelles). Also I used 4 chopped fresh tomatoes rather than canned. Otherwise, I followed the recipe for the rest of the ingredients. I believe the extra ingredients increased the yield for this recipe to 8 servings. This was easy to make and is a great recipe for late summer when all of the ingredients are in season. I will definitely make this again.

Awesome "stew"!  Very healthy and great over couscous.  I bet it would even be good over Quinoa for an extra healthy meal.  Very easy and the husband loved it!  I changed to diced tomatoes - didn't have any stewed, and threw in a tiny bit of leftover zuchinni.  Nice recipe because you could probably add in just about any small amount of vegetables your needing to use before they go bad.  This goes in my "Tried and True" recipe box - Delicious!

I made this recipe just as it is written and it was great. I was careful not to overcook the eggplant, and I think I cooked it only 8-10 minutes before adding the tomatoes etc. I didn't use feta, which I might next time because I thought this needed a bit of salt.

This was easy to out together, though I think it needs a little something extra, something smokey. Going to make it again, though, and experiment a little.

Really really good. I added some zucchini because it was sitting around looking at me. Also, I doubled the herbs because herbs are good. Even my husband who claims to hate eggplant, mushrooms, and zucchini ate two huge bowls.

We liked this recipe.  It's good on top of rice (I used brown rice), and we brainstormed a few other ideas--using it as stuffing for stuffed peppers, having it in tortillas (like tacos), adding salsa after it's finished cooking.

I really enjoy this recipe. It's simple and a one pot meal, which is something I love. Serve it with some whole grain bread or brown rice to make it extra hearty. I recommend using two or three Asian eggplants in place of one American or Italian eggplant as the Asian varieties are not bitter and thus don't require salting. I also like to use one green pepper and one red pepper to add some extra flavor. Make sure to add salt to taste if you don't use the olives. If you don't like rosemary be sure to add another flavorful herb, otherwise it will be too bland.This dish freezes and reheats well.

This is a delicious stew, especially for the winter months. I replaced the olives with artichokes and it was a good switch (I don't like olives). Other than that the recipe was very easy to make and quite filling.

Very tasty and easy. I would recommend also to 'weep' the eggplant with salt before adding. I rinsed the eggplant off before adding to the rest, because I don't like too much salt. I didn't have mushrooms, but followed the rest. Very very tasty. (Served over pasta because my quinoa wasn't soaked long enough)

Oh, wow!  I forgot to add the mushrooms - DUH - but it was still delicious!  I had 2 ichiban eggplants in my garden, just waiting to go into something yummy. Since they were young and just-picked, there was no bitterness at all.  Next time.... there will be mushrooms in it... I'll bet their earthy flavor will only improve this already marvelous, easy to make stew.

I loved it.  I left out the mushrooms as I am allergic, but I added zucchini.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. The person who said it didn't taste better than canned soup must not have followed the recipe.  I bet this would be great with or over rice.

After reading all the rave reviews, and even the one not so enthusiastic one complained more about the consistency, I was disappointed.  Didnt taste much better than a canned vegetable soup to me.  I'll finish what I cooked but I wont be in a rush to make this again
