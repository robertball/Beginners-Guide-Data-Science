I thought this recipe was fantastic!! Upon seeing what ingrediants were called for, I decided that a vegetable was needed to add color (and I like some sort a veggie in all my pastas).  approx 2 min before the pasta was finished, I added half a bag of frozen chopped broccoli.  Also, when the chicken and garlic was almost done, I sauted a half cup of red bell peppers and half cup of fresh sliced muchrooms.  Finally, to thicken the sauce, I added 1/2 cup of parmesen cheese rather than the required 1/4 cup. I was worried that I might of altered the original recipe too much but rather when all was said and done...it was WONDERFUL!! My family won't eat it any other way. My 5 yr old always has 2 servings and even my picky brother in law (age 15)scarfed 2 helpings down...muchrooms and all. This is a great and easy recipe that anyone can do and if you want to add your fav veggie like I did, I think there is plenty of room for experimentation.  I have made this many times since and my taste buds never tire of it.  It is worth a try and then..try to see what you can do with it to make it better suit your tastes.

Super simple and quick. I've made it 3 times and made the following revisions: Definitely use fresh basil (2tsp dried should be 2tbs fresh), add a chopped shallot to perk up the flavor, and double the sauce.  There's enough fat in this dish already so saute in olive oil instead of butter.  To make the presentation more attractive, use tricolor rotini and throw in a couple generous handfuls of frozen petite peas during the last 3 minutes of boiling the pasta.

I took the suggestions of making more sauce (added more garlic, *fresh* basil, cheese, cream) and last time added a bit (a really teeny bit) of sugar .  I definitely recommend trying that.  It takes the bitterness of the parm out of the dish.  I think you can make it with just about any hearty pasta shape.  I've made it with fusilli and farfelle and today am going to try it with pappardelle.  Fantastic recipe.  My thanks to Stacey and the other reviewers.

I believe that this is actually a 4.5 star recipe, but still excellent!  I made a few changes to suit health and ingredients I had on hand.  Used spaghetti, which was nice, but next time I would try a rotini or similar.  I had cooked the cubed chicken ahead of time, in onions and garlic- added flavor.  I substituted a mix of Greek yogurt and milk for cream.  I also doubled the amount of 'cream' I added- and it still wasn't enough!  Next time, I'll triple it (the better to dip bread in)!  This recipe made enough for 3 or 4 people.  The taste of the sauce was excellent, and it was quick to make.  Will make again!

2nd making comments:  Perfect for a dinner party.  Use rotini or similar because it’s perfect for the sauce.  My earlier comments about needing more sauce are spot on – make much more sauce than you think you’ll need.  Also, when making for guests, make sure that you do use a majority of cream or the sauce might curdle (example: I used 2 c cream and 1 c yogurt/milk mix and this was perfect, but a remake the next day with only yogurt/milk curdled.  Tastes ok (not as good as w cream) but looked funny).  Elegant tasting and easy.  Be sure to use good Parmesan.  Also, this would support a variety of veggies added to it – experiment!

This was very good. I agree that the sauce should be doubled. I also increased the parmesan cheese to 1/3 cup (we really like it). Fresh mushrooms would be a great addition. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I really like this dish.  I have made it several times, making slight changes each time.  Last time was our favorite.  I added yellow bell pepper, extra cheese, 2 cups heavy cream, and cajun seasoning.  Yum!

This was excellent!  Definitely a keeper. I doubled the sauce and used fresh basil and fresh parmesan. I also added a diced red bell pepper and diced tomatoes at the last minute. Very quick and easy to make. Can't wait to have again. Goes great with a glass of white wine.

The flavor of this is to die for!!!!

I love how speedy this is to make.  Great in a pinch and tasted like I cooked all day.

I made this as a main dish.  So for my family I used the 12 oz. of pasta but doubled the rest of the recipe.  I may cut back just a tad on the cream next time.

Thanks so much.  Just wonderful!

Like always, I read a few dozen reviews and look for commonality for what works and doens't work.  In this case it was "more sauce".  Here are all the mods and it went over great:

-A lil cajun to the dice chicken prior to pan fry
-Olive oil/not butter
-Microw/steam brocolli stems
-Button mushrooms cut into small bits
-Sauce consisted of part heavy cream, part sour cream, white wine and the heavy parm cheese.  Also doubled the sauce like several people suggested.
-More basil then the recipe called for (like others suggested).
-A little valdalia onion and lots of garlic early on before chicken hits the skillet
-Top it off with 3 pieces of bacon crumbled on top right before presenting
-Serve w White Wine

This one is a very tasty dish,and my whole family loved it. I added a little sugar to balance out the parmesan cheese and a 1/4 teasp of salt,I also used 2 cups of cream and chicken thighs. This is a rich and filling dish I didn't even have any leftovers.

OMG!  AMAZING!  This was so easy, and always have ingredients on hand.  Today, however, no heavy cream so thought I'd try sour cream and milk, which I know I always have.  I also had fresh basil on hand.  So much flavor!  Oh, I also used angel hair pasta (our fav!)  Thank you for sharing this...10 stars!

Great Recipe. If you are watching the fat though, then omit the cream and add a couple tbps of light sourcream and a bit of chicken broth to make  the sauce the consistency you want.

Simple and filling, yet bland. I added chopped cooked "crisp-tender" broccoli and sauted red peppers on the advice of the most helpful reviewer, and these were welcome additions. Increasing the parmesan to 1/2 cup as another reviewer suggested would also have helped, though I opted not to because of kid-friendliness.

Really good and smelled wonderful! I substituted  2/3 c of milk and ~ 2 T butter for the heavy cream. It came out  a bit watery but I fixed that by adding a bit of flour to thicken. Towards the end of the cooking, I added frozen broccoli on top and covered to cook. Served over a brown/wild rice mix. Burnt the heck out of my tongue because it smelled so wonderul, I couldn't wait to eat it.

very good! I added "italian mix" cheese (about 1/2 a cup). I'll probably go lighter on the cheese next time.

A lovely recipe. I did have to substitute a few ingredients. I used 3/4 cup of milk, 1/3 cup butter (melted) and 1 tablespoon flour in place of heavy cream and I used medium cheddar cheese also. It turned out really well and everyone loved it!

Learnt this while I was in a food nutriton class in high school. A couple years later found the recipe again, and have enjoyed making it. 
For my family of 4 I make a double batch as it doesn't seem to go far enough for us. 
I also add, button mushrooms, tomatos, red pepers, and green peppers.

This recipe was just great, it was easy to make and was so delicious. I made it last night and my husband just loved it, before he was done he was already asking when we are going to have that for dinner again. I had left overs and i added a bit of milk and a bit of butter to reheat just like someone had suggested in the reviews, it did look and taste as good as before. Thank you for the recipe Stacey

My family and I loved this recipe! All 5 kids cleaned their plates! I added garlic salt and paprika to the recipe and sauteed mushrooms and red bell pepper in with the chicken. I didn't have cream so I just used milk and thickened with a tsp of cornstarch. Turned out great

Follow the recipe exactly and it needs to have the sauce doubled, salt to taste and we still thought it need a little extra something -- probably onion.  Suppose this is OK for a base, but pretty boring overall.

I added broccoli to the pasta (as someone else suggested), additionally I added 1/4 cup of extra dry vermouth to the cream and let it simmer longer.  This made an amazingly delicious meal.

very quick and easy!  I used fresh basil, and half & half rather than heavy cream.  I'm glad someone said it doesn't reheat well, I made enough for just one meal, but it's so quick that I'll make it again tonight.  Yum!

My husband wasn't crazy about Amy's Garlic Egg Chicken (from this site) leftovers so I made this recipe with them one night when he was out at a company dinner and this turned out sooo good!  I will definitely be making this again.  Just the kind of dish he likes - chicken with a rich sauce.  I used evaporated milk as I didn't have any heavy cream.  I hope it tastes as good even if it weren't leftovers from Amy's Garlic Chicken recipe.  I may put more garlic and spices in to compensate if cooking chicken from scratch.

Very good! This made easily 6 servings. I added sauteed mushrooms and frozen broccoli to the pasta water. Easy to make this your own with endless options.

I followed other reviewers and doubled the sauce and added broccoli. Delicious but definitely would not have been enough sauce if I hadn't doubled it.

I was wondering what to do with a rotisserie chicken I had on hand when this recipe came through the Daily Dish e-mail.  Perfect timing. This recipe is definitly a keeper. I followed some of the options other reviewers noted and loved the outcome.  Added a shallot, sliced mushrooms and about 1/4 cup diced red pepper to the chicken and garlic. For the sauce, I did double as suggested, but I used the 3/4 c milk, 1/3 c butter and 1 T flour instead of heavy cream.  I couldn't find fresh basil so used the dried. It was wonderful! I could hardly wait for the pasta to cook after sampling the chicken mixture.  I did add peas to the pasta, and that didn't add much for us, but didn't detract.  Will be making this again!

I made it exactly like the recipe adding mushrooms like someone suggested.   We really enjoyed it but next time I would like the sauce to be a little thicker so I will add a little cornstarch.

I was very disappointed in the flavor of this.  There's so many better cream/basil & chicken recipes out there.  Won't be making it again.

This was really good. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it came out as a 4 star. I did double the sauce after reading a lot of reviews, but wished I hadn't because it ended up being way too much. The second time I made this was for my mom's retirement party and I did make some changes including seasoning the chicken prior to cooking and adding white wine to the sauce. The modified version was definitely a 5 star and everyone was raving about it....asking me who the caterer was!!! To everyone's surprise I was proud to say it was me.

This recipe turned out really good after a few changes: in order to get more flavor I marinated the chicken with garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil in the morning and kept in the refrigerator all day. I didn't use any butter, only olive oil, half and half instead of heavy cream and finally a lot of "fresh basil".

Ahh...decadence indeed! Lovely creamy taste coupled with the zing of basil. I didnt have heavy cream so I used 1 1/2 cups of creamy milk instead. Added a little corn starch(1tbsp) to thicken it up. Followed other's advice and used fresh basil and roasted red peppers. The latter really added a lovely flavor to the dish. The chicken pieces were so tender and delicious. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This pasta is really convenient if you dont want to spend too much time in preparation.  I made some minor alterations: doubled the sauce, omitted the chicken, used angel hair pasta, lite cream, fresh basil and cajun seasoning to taste.  Will make again.  On the blander side...goes good if there is another dish with meat.

Yum.  I, too, doubled the sauce which made it a nice, creamy pasta dish.  It was just a tiny bit bland -- should I have doubled the spices, too?  Maybe that was the problem.  Still, a yummy dish.

I thought this was good but I would have doubled the sauce, as it was not enough for my family's liking. I served it with a side of brocolli topped with parm cheese. We ate it all, so the sauce is delicious, just needed more of it.

I like the idea/foundation of this recipe, but I found it extremely bland.  I tried this one out because other reviews mentioned quick and easy and I was on a crazy tight schedule this night.  So not having time to get creative on the spot, I will use this recipe again, but try some creative alterations.

This was a great go-to recipe for a quick and easy meal! I used about one cup of Mexican style cheese and a little more heavy cream. It was super cheesy and with just my husband and I, we still have leftovers that I can't wait to eat tomorrow. Thank you for a great recipe!

Loved this!!  Very "restaurant-styled" IMO  :)  Husband says its a keeper.  I did double the sauce.  Didn't have basil on hand, so added some frozen broccoli to pan a little after sautéing the chicken & onions.  AMAZING!  Used whole-wheat fusilli, too..YUM!  Thanks, Stacey, for sharing!!  :)

I disagree with the reviewer below me. Definitely is not bland! You have to use dried basil or it's not quite the same. It was delicious, I love that it wasn't too "saucy" it just nicely coated the chicken and pasta. I did a 4 serving recipe, which all recipes is nice enough to configure for you. I will definitley make this again...I served with tuscan garlic bread and had an awesome meal in 15 minutes.

This is the best recipe that I have ever tried on this website!  I used tri-color pasta to make the dish look more appealing, added mushrooms because they were going bad and I sliced the garlic rather than mincing it because I thought that larger chunks would work well with this recipe.  This dish was so good that I ate all of the leftovers.  It's true that this dish doesn't hold well but if you heat it up in a pan with a cover and add more cream and butter (or chicken broth for the health conscious), the dish is just as good as the day it was cooked.  This was so quick to make.  Next time I will try to substitute the chicken with shrimp.

This was great! Super fast to prep. On the table in 20 minutes! I used fresh basil instead of dry and added sun dried tomatoes and peas. I added the sun dried tomatoes when I added the garlic and added the peas at the very end. I also used half the amount of pasta. Also no chicken - just didn't have any. Oh, and I put the pasta in the sauce and let it simmer for about 5 minutes to absorb the flavors. My husband, who's a light eater, had 3 helpings... I had half a helping because I knew what was in it. Again, love this.

great easy recipe!! i adjusted some of the portions for my bf and i, because i don't really measure: approx 10oz penne, 2 chicken breasts, 1 1/4C of cream, 1/4 cup fresh julienned basil, 1/2C parmesan plenty garlic and fresh ground pepper. i also precooked 2slices of bacon, drained on paper towel and removed almost all the bacon fat before adding 1tbsp butter to cook the chicken and garlic.  after i added the cooked pasta to the pot, before i mixed it into the sauce i threw in the other tbsp butter and the crushed bacon. SO GOOD. this rich dish is definitely a keeper...

This was an awesome dish! I also doubled the sauce and increased the chicken. The taste was just what I was looking for. A good comfort food!

This dish was delicious! I used whole wheat noodles. To the sauce i  added a sliced roasted red pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. The two brought great colors to the dish. It was amazing! i recommend not using as much cayenne if you are not used to it.

I thought this was a great recipe! I did add some of my own flare. I added a cup of chopped mushrooms and about half a cup of chopped onions to the sautee. I doubled the parm and add just a little extra cream. Yum!

I used penne noodles and I doubled the sauce. I still felt like there needed to be more sauce though. The taste was wonderful and my family really enjoyed it. I also added mushrooms and a tad bit of salt.

Wonderful quick and easy dish! I cut this down to 2 servings (half the chicken and half the pasta) left everything else as is, and used shredded parmesan/asiago/romano cheese blend. My only change was that I tossed in a handful of broccoli florets to the pasta when I was cooking it. This could have used a bit more sauce. I wasn't even sure my husband would like this, but after he took the first bite he commented on how good it was. So Thanks for such a great recipe!

I thought this was a good recipe.  I did as other suggested and doubled the sauce.  I also added a few shrimp to this mixture.  Next time I prepare this I will probably add some kind of green vegetable to give the dish a little color.

My family liked this recipe, but I'm not sure it's good enough to warrant the amount of fat and calories it contains.  As other reviewers mentioned, I had to double the sauce to make enough to cover the pasta.  I did use fresh basil, which I think added a lot to the flavor.  I can't imagine that dried basil would give the same amount of flavor.  I added sauteed mushrooms and sliced red pepper to this, which we enjoyed and thought made the dish more complete.  Overall, definitely something everyone in my family ate and said they liked, but too heavy for a regular weeknight meal.  I may try to lighten it up a little bit and see how that goes.

This recipe is great. It is one of our favorites. My only suggestion is use a lot more heavy cream and use a lot more cheese. The recipe is wonderful though. It heats up ok but not the best. I have learned the best way to heat it up is on the stove. If you throw it in the microwave it doesn't turn out too great.

This is a new family favorite! This is so easy I wish I would have found this recipe earlier! I made it with rigatoni. We loved the sauce and my husband said I could even leave out the chicken, as the sauce is so rich it doesn't need anything else. I might add some spinach for color next time. Thanks for sharing!

Very delicious, thought the sauteed schicken had a great flavor. I doubled (or more) the cream and cheese and thought it turned out great.  Will make again, very easy.

This was fabulous! My very picky husband couldn't eat enough of it. I did double the sauce as recommended by others. I also used fresh basil (prob, 10 or so leaves chopped fine) insted of dry. We grow our own basil so I had lots to work with. Next time I'll make even more sauce!

My husband loved this recipe and I made the following adjustments.  I too doubled the garlic and black pepper and added some crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I cut my chicken in strips and tenderized them before cutting them up.  I also added probably 1/4 cup of parm cheese to it at the end too.  Will make again!

Delicious!  If I can make it, anybody can.  I added a little more garlic, a chopped red bell pepper for visual appeal, and mixed veggies for a little variety.  It came out great and the leftovers heated well.

This recipe was delicious.  I'm not much of a pasta fan but with the creamy sauce, I was sold. Also, it was extremely easy to make.  My girlfriend and I finished the whole pot in one sitting.  Thanks Stacey.

My boyfriend, who likes about 4 things, loved this.  It's super easy to make, but it doesn't taste like it.  Unfortunately, I used garlic salt instead of garlic, and it came out too salty.  But i didn't get any complaints.

This was very good, good flavor. The sauce was not what I thought, I had to add a lot more cheese to get it to thicken and I wasn't sure if I was to cook it with all the fixin's or separate from the fixin's. So I cooked it with half the fixin's and then poured over the remainder. Either way it was good, but as one reviewer stated it doesn't reheat well so eat it all the first day. I will make it again.

I made many of the changes recommended (mushrooms, red pepper, broccoli, fresh basil) and it still was missing something.  I think more parm cheese would help.

You're cooking this because you want to clear things in the fridge when you are about to move right? Or it's the simplest but tasty thing you can make with the fewest ingredients. It works really well and you can always add things to the recipe, I added sun-dried tomatoes to it and it taste great. It is basic but you can do anything to it and still taste good.

Great tasting recipe. I changed a few things. The ingredients are the same but I used 1-teaspoon pepper, 4-teaspoons dried basil, 2 cups half and half and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. I also added chopped broccoli. My husband who is very picky, loves this meal. I serve it with garlic bread.

This was sooooo delicious! I doubled the liquid in it and substituted heavy cream with 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt. It was a nice change from pasta with red sauce. In fact, I'm not sure if regular spaghetti will be eaten again in my house for quite a while. My fiance loved it and it smelled DELICIOUS while cooking!  :)

This recipe was good and a great starter but I did make some adjustments so I don't want to give it more than three stars.  I baked the chicken in pepper, garlic and onion powder, some oregano and a little cheese blend.  To the sauce I added shallots.  I was concerned the amount of basil would be a lot because it looked that way in the sauce pan but it turned out fine. Yum!

Great little recipe.  It was quick to make with ingredients on hand.  It had tons of flavour and was really creamy which everyone loved.  It even tasted good cold straight out of the fridge.  I will be making this again for a weeknight meal.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was just so-so. Both my hubs and I agree that this was not to our liking at all (sorry!). Of all the pasta dishes I've made, this one just doesn't add up. Don't get me wrong.... This is good, it's just not GREAT. My criticisms are two-fold. Not only was this terribly dry (the pasta REALLY soaks up the little bit of sauce there is), it was also quite bland. Even after garnishing our bowls of pasta with fresh grated Parm and chopped basil, we still weren't hooked. Maybe this will suit your tastes, but it just didn't ours. Thanks anyways, Stacey. :)

It is good with added ingredients of red pepper, chopped onion, and mushrooms.  Top with some shredded fresh Parmesan and parsley.  Half pasta to sauce amount.  Other comments are on the recipe card in the file box.

Really yummy! I'm a big fan of creamy sauces and garlic. They're right though, it doesn't reheat well at all (sauce just falls apart) but I think it still tasted OK. More cheese solves so many problems though!

This dish was very good and my extremly picky 6 year old ate it up (quite an accomplishment when all he wants is hotdogs and mac n' cheese).  I added a bunch of italian seasoning (the grinder kind, which has more flavor) along with the basil called for.  only thing I recommend is eating it up all the night you make it because the leftovers turned to a brick the next day.  It was very easy to make and I will make again!

Great base recipe!  Added 1/2 bag frozen broccoli to pasta water & sauteed 1/2 red bell pepper and 1/2 mushrooms and increase parmesan to 1/2 cup per other reviewer suggestions.  Awesome! Will definitely make again with revisions.

This was good, but I wouldn't give it near 5 stars like some, save the five star ratings for the 'blow your mind' recipes!! Anyway, the family ate it, said it was pretty good....do double the sauce, at the very least! I think fresh basil would help this dish tremendously.

I'm sorry but I was disappointed.  Too peppery and sauce was so-so.  I think the chicken might have been better thinly sliced or shredded instead of little cubes.  And it needed more cheese (which I added -- shredded italian cheese).

Boring - bland - disappointed. This recipe needed tweaking. I added chicken stock to boost flavor, resisted adding salt - used much more basil, an additional half cup of cheese and a few more cloves of garlic and this made it work but still not stellar. It got three stars only because it is a decent base.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very quick too.  I did double the heavy cream and added season salt to the chicken.  My family likes extra cheese so I added and extra 1/4 cup of parmesan.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and will for sure make this again!!!!

This recipe is spectacular!!  I halved the recipe for 2 servings.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs for a bit more flavor and moisture.  I used half and half to save a bit on calories on fat and never missed the heavy cream.  Even though I halved the recipe, I used heaping measurements of the butter, basil and parm cheese.  I used bow tie pasta as that is a particular favorite of mine.  
Any restaurant would be proud to have this on their menu and you will be proud to serve this to your family or guests.  
This recipe is easy enough to make for company without even trying it out first.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

made this recipe as is and it is great, very little time in making it but agree with all the other comments that the basil sauce needs to be doubled, to much pasta for so little sauce. Do not agree that any other items should be added.

It was pretty good but I did have to add a bit of garlic salt because the chicken was a bit bland. I used olive oil instead of butter and whole grain pasta instead but for the most part just followed the directions. I will definitely make this again I will just season the chicken a bit before I mix in the rest of the ingredients.

Just looking at the ingredients, it's just another version of an Alfredo Sauce. It was OK, but as others did, I made many alterations. And really isn't fair to rate when so many changes are made. I'm rating 3 stars, because I am rating the recipe "as is".

Very delicious! I didn't have garlic cloves so I used chopped onion instead. I also added some paprika, season all, garlic powder, and didn't add as much the pepper or basil. I did add some flour to thicken it up a bit. I also added some broccli, califlower, carrots and squash (pre-boiled and added towards the end). I also used any noodles I had on hand. It came out very good and I will be making this again.

This was wonderful! I just made this tonight, and even though I'm full, my mouth is still watering.  Just a few changes, though, but only because of personal preference. I at least doubled the Parmesan, and used fresh; used fresh basil; 5 cloves of garlic, and added some extra cream, because it seemed like it needed the extra moisture. We love everything that is in this recipe! Served with a side of sauteed zucchini, since it was fresh out of the garden. Will definitely be making again!

Tried this recipe last night with the girlfriend and a guest.  It was very good, and they both loved it.  We might have cooked the sauce down a bit far, but it definetly needed extra.  Served with rosemary garlic bread, salad, and Luna di Luna pink merlot.

This was very easy to make. I had exactly everything so was excited to prepare it for my boyfriend for dinner. I used fresh basil which should make a difference in the taste. It is imperitive that you double to sauce. I had to add more immediatley when making it as described. It took doubling it to make it restaurant quality. Otherwise you will have a dry pasta. I tossed it with some farfalle and he loved it.

I made this last night and it was delicioius and very simple.  I noticed my fiance was extremely quiet so I looked over at him and he was inhaling it, didn't hear a peep out of him until he'd devoured a huge bowl. I also used fresh basil after reading the other reviews and I added bella mushrooms when I cooked the chicken then after I added the cream I put sun dried tomatoes in too.  Delicious!  Definitely a keeper.

Great flavor, but it was way too dry. I even doubled the cream (I used half-and-half instead). I added freshly steamed broccoli florets, which rounded it out nicely. Next time I would either triple the sauce or cut the pasta down. Served with garlic bread.

This recipe is awesome!  I've made it as is, which is very good, and I've also made it with a little cajun seasoning and a little lemon pepper, which I thought was even better!  Also, I rarely have heavy cream on hand, so I use 3/4 cup of milk and 1/3 cup butter/margarine instead, and I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce.  Thanks for a great and super easy meal!

Great easy dish!  In a pinch for time, it was a hearty weeknight meal.  Kids had multiple servings...  Will make again for sure.

This pasta dish is excellent and is good when you cant have red sauce! The only problem I have is that I use the shredded parmasean in a bag and that sometimes tends to stick to the bottom of my sauce pan and doesnt melt thoroughly. Also the recipe is not so great the next day as the wonderful sauce becomes oily. Definetly eat this up the day you make it!

As it's written, this is a little bland.  Her are some things I added or changed:

I added 1 cup of fresh broccoli.  Frozen would work too, but I had some on hand.

I added 1 small can of mushrooms.

I didn't have heavy whipping cream, so I used milk, doubling the sauce recipe, and I added 8 oz. of lt. Kraft cream cheese to thicken the sauce.

I used lemon pepper in place of black pepper, and I double the amount of basil.  I also add 1 tsp of granulated garlic to the sauce.

My  kids really loved this, and it made it more of a complete meal.

Very good, but not much innovation here. It's essentially chicken alfredo with basil.

It was good, with alterations! I eliminated the butter (use olive oil if needed), tried to cut down on the cream, and added fresh chopped basil to brighten the flavor. As always, I used rotisserie chicken to save on time (they are so easy to use, delicious, and cheap!)

This is very good, but I have to admit that we like the Chicken in Basil Cream recipe better.  There wasn't anything wrong with this...and we followed the recipe exactly.  Just liked the other one better. Thanks for the post.

I really enjoyed this recipe with a few modifications.  I doubled the sauce as others recommended.  I also doubled the garlic.  To lighten things up I substituted 2% milk for the cream.  I added frozen peas for a little color and used both fresh and dried basil. I a little over doubled the parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce.  Next time I will add some red pepper flake for a little kick.  Overall a great basic recipe that is quick and easy to prepare.

I loved this dish!  The sauce was creamy with rich flavorings.  After reading some of the comments I used fresh basil, added Italian seasonings, and garnished with more fresh basil and chopped tomato.
I will make this again, but not too often, as it is so fattening.  I plan on using a lighter cream next time.

My husband loved this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add some swiss cheese I had in the fridge. He asked me to make it every week.  I had to tell him no though because I feared for his life (and mine) if he ate cream, butter, and cheese every week.  Maybe next time I'll try half and half instead of heavy cream.

I only rated this 4 because I didn't follow the recipe. I always tried to follow the recipe exact the first time, but didn't have heavy cream and used evaporated milk. I added a little extra cheese to make up for this. I thought it was really good and did my wife, but unless I follow it exactly, I never know what it "was" supposed to taste like. I will add this to my recipe box.

Fabulous!  I used fresh basil, a dallop of pesto and fresh tomatoes in the cream sauce.  I don't think the pesto was necessary, but since I really like the flavor of basil, I added it to mine.  Tomatoes were an excellent addition as well.  Both me and my husband LOVED this dish!

This was a good dish with a nice flavor to it.  It didn't reheat well at all, so that was a big downfall.  Also, it seemed a bit greasy for me.. maybe next time i will cut down on the butter.

My husband, Mr. Picky Eater, loved this, as did I.  My chicken turned out a little dry but the sauce was awesome and made up for where the chicken lacked.  I think the sauce could be used with seafood or other noodles as well.  I added more garlic and lots more cheese but stuck pretty much to the recipe.  Will definatly make this again!

This is a simple recipe.  You no longer have to buy Noodleroni Parmesana if you just add a bit of oregano, rosemary, parsley and more parmesan.  If time is a constraint, buy an already cooked chicken and make the sauce. Add the chicken into the sauce and bring on the dinner plates!

This was very tasy!!  After reading the reviews I did double the sauce with a little more of the seasoning and it was most excellent.  I also took the suggestion to add 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms, red pepper, and a tablesoon green pepper.  My 3 year old even liked it!!   Reheating was fine when I added a touch of the whipping cream and covered with wet paper towel in the microwave.  Thanks!!

Yummmm!!! My husband and I loved this recipe. He actually said this dish compared to dishes at the Olive Garden. I do admit it did look a bit dry to reheat but there wasn't much left after we were done with it anyway. Maybe next time I will use milk and a little bit of flour to the mixture instead of the whipping cream to see if I can cut the fat intake. But other than that, this dish was GREAT!! I will have to make this again!

Update: If you want to reheat this, and you don't want it too dried out, add a little bit of butter and a splash of milk. Just like new!

For those who prefer a tinge of sweetness... try adding brown sugar to the sauce -- I cooked up this recipe and got praises for it!

Love this recipe, I have made it many times, but giving it a 3 because the basil is so strong, I halved the amount in later recipes and they turned out great!

I used spaghetti noodles instead, and it turned out really well.  It was a HUGE hit with my 7 and 10 year old girls.  Definitely a dish one can add veggies to in order to bulk it up and add more flavors.  Mushrooms, broccoli , cut green bean etc.

I'm sorry but this recipe is a mess and needs a lot of work to ever get made again by me.  Let's start out with the fact that the recipe is completely bland.  Salt anyone?  Next up the sauce simply isn't adequate for the amount of pasta so either double the sauce or half the pasta.  And finally even though I doubled the amount of Parmesan it called for it was still lacking in taste.  With all the other recipes similar to this one that actually aren't embarrassing to serve to guests I'd say steer clear of this one.

I use garden Rotini instead of regular to add color.  I also added bell  peppers, red, green and yellow saute with little salt and pepper. Also added fresh broccoli.    I added a hand toss salad as a side to complement  it. If i would try it again? Yes,  I would and will but with less pepper.

Sometimes I make substitutions ... sometimes I don’t.  Chicken thighs vs. breats, fresh basil vs. dry, added veggies vs. not. This recipe continues to be a go-to in our family.

My family loved it!  I made some adjustments after reading a few of the other comments.  I doubled the sauce and sautéed onions, mushrooms and garlic in the butter, along with the rest of the recipe.  I also added 1 TBSP of lemon juice, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Was delish!  Thanks everyone for the great ideas!

This was delicious and easy to make!!!!  I give this 5 stars, but I added red peppers, onion, broccoli, and doubled the amount of cheese.  Also, I used Italian seasoning instead of basil.

My family loved it!  It was very simple to make and I like that it was all in one skillet (except the pasta of, course).  I added a little more garlic and used half n half instead of whipping cream and angel hair pasta because that is what I had on hand.  I think I will try adding broccoli next time.  Or simply pair it with a green salad and french bread.  I will definitely be making this again.

Really quick and easy. We used to buy box meal kits for a similar recipe, and I think about how the price we spent for those is comparable to the price of buying the fresh ingredients and making it yourself. 

We do like to add broccoli florets to ours. We also have served veggies on the side.

I used linguini noodles because it is what I had on hand.  I used the basic measurements, but increased the sauce because we like sauce.  My youngest, who is my pickiest eater, loved it.   I served it with a tomato and mozzarella salad.  I did make my dish with fresh basil because the taste is so much fresher.  I would make this again, and will add diced red peppers and a little bit of broccoli next time.  This was filling and really quick to make.

Good recipe and easy but definitely needs spicing up.   I add black olives, more garlic and sundried tomatoes.   Now this, to us, gives it enough kick and certainly hot pepper flakes could be used.   Definitely use fresh basil if possible and then it is in the gourmet category.   Thanks for the basic recipe and a delight to work on.

It's definitely a good base, and it was convenient because I already had all the ingredients, but it was sort of bland and definitely needed something else.

Quite tasty, but a bit bland. Needed a bit more salt. I used whole milk with some flour to make the sauce since I didn't have cream (boiled to thicken) and made twice the amount as suggested by others. I also added frozen broccoli for nutrition & color. Will make again, but may cut the recipe down so there aren't as many leftovers for a smaller family.

Fantastic recipe that has become a staple in our home. I can't even count the number of times I've made it. One critique is that it needs salt! The original recipe doesn't add any salt and it definitely needs some; it's completely bland without it. Add to taste and voila! Delicious!

I was looking for a recipe to use up leftover cornish hens and came across this recipe. I cooked the chicken the same way as called for in the recipe but since I am lactose intolerant, used a mixture of no salt chicken broth thickened with cornstarch and cooking wine.  This recipe was easy, quick and delicious. I will definitely make again

I made this recipe tonight...started at 9:15 and by 9:50 I was sitting down and eating...love how quick this recipe is! I made my own adjustments to it, mainly that I used shredded gruyere cheese instead of parmesan cheese and seasoned with salt and pepper to my liking....very good recipe!

I'm giving this a four star because it's a good basic recipe but required a lot of modification. I think the author left room for variation on purpose, though. This is what I did:
1. Doubled sauce ingredients (cream, Parmesan, pepper and basil), and added 1 tsp salt
2. I used 1 lb boneless chicken thigh because I like dark meat better
3. Added 1 pkg sliced mushrooms, 1/2 yellow onion, 1/2 red pepper; sauteed each in butter (onion and pepper together) and set them aside, then added them back just before I added the sauce ingredients to the browned chicken
Next time I'd actually triple the cheese (also, if you want a thicker sauce and have a heart attack, add 1/2 cup of cream cheese!)
The red pepper worked very well with this!

Great easy recipe. Followed it as written except substituted sour cream for heavy cream because that's what was on hand. Also added fresh chopped red pepper and green onions at end(not cooked). Will make again!

This is delicious!  I made it for my husband and myself last night and it was so good.  I did add sliced fresh mushrooms, spring onions, and broccoli (to have the green veggie).  We loved it!   I did not double anything this first time, but we still had enough leftovers for another meal and it was good tonight heated up in the microwave.  It was better last night made fresh, but we still enjoyed it this evening.   This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you!

Its appears to be a variation of the standard sauce 
for chicken Alfredo and I fail to see how so many people gave it a four or five when most made changes to the recipe  that she actually posted.Nice of her to share it  .

This recipe is delicious! Definitely a favorite. My sister makes this, and it is always fantastic.  She doesn't change or add anything to the recipe, except she usually uses egg noodles instead of rotini. My whole family likes this dish, and so does everyone that tries it.  She serves it with warm herbed bread sticks. Yum!

This recipe was wonderful but I jazzed it up a little to match my tastes. I followed the advice of some of the other users and added some red, green, and yellow peppers for color and some sliced mushrooms so I would feel less guilty about the heavy cream :-). I also used a combination of regular and spinach penne noodles, added a little more garlic and pepper then squeezed in a little fresh lemon. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

This recipe was just ok.  It ended up being almost pasty.  This may be because I used skim milk instead of cream to save calories.  I also used an off brand wheat pasta which was really starchy.  I may make again when I am willing to up the calories with real cream and use fresh basil.

I loved this! I tried it with fusilli but made a few changes: I used 2T olive oil instead of butter to make it a bit healthier and only 1 clove garlic because I'm not really a fan. I used twice the amount of parmesan stated in the recipe. Finally, I was disappointed to see that I didn't have any basil so I had to omit that. It was still awesome, though I'm sure it tastes even better with basil. I'm going to try that ASAP. PS: It's not nearly as good when you reheat it so try to eat it all when you first make it! Trust me, it won't be hard. ;)

This was delicious!!!!  Of course though there wasn't enough sauce which seems to happen to me a lot when making sauce dishes.  Maybe we just like more sauce than most...i don't know!  Anyway...I did as another reviewer did and added some lemom pepper.  I also used fresh basil instead of dry.  So for all you sauce lovers out there...double it ;)

Made this last night, not too bad but I would definetely make some changes next time around.  I added about an extra 1/2c cream and it was still too dry so I would definetely double the sauce (would have listened to the suggestions but ran out of cream).  Also next time I think I would use fresh basil and add some mushrooms or something to add a little flavor.  Broccoli sounded like a good suggestion.  Otherwise great base recipe.

They need to have a 1/2 star on here, because this wasn't perfect, but it was really close.  I followed the directions except for the addition of sun-dried tomatoes, which added some flavor, but also quite a bit of oil.  Next time I'll use dried or water packed tomatoes, or drain the jar beforehand.  The end result got four thumbs up from my somewhat picky family.

WOW! Don't need to change a single thing. my husband and I both agreed it was better than any pasta we've had at a restaurant. Of course, most anything would be good with that much heavy cream in it. ;-)
I'd give it 15 stars if I could!

I thought this was a quick, easy-to-prepare, and tasty recipe.  I didn't have any heavy cream in house so I used some Land-O-Lakes Fat Free Half & Half.  So while the sauce at the end wasn't as thick as the recipe called for, it was lower in fat. 
I took the recommendation to add frozen broccoli to the boiling pasta water... great idea!
And my partner likes a little heat, so I added some chopped canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

Thanks to Stacey Adkins for sharing her recipe for a nice hearty weeknight meal.

This one gets a "so-so". I was a bit disappointed in the sauce. It was more of a paste. I think it has a lot of potential if it were doctered up a bit.

This recipe was good, however I would definitely double the sauce next time. I also doubled the parmesan cheese, and added  about 1Tbs of flour to thicken it. There was more flavor than I was expecting with so many reviews saying it was bland. It went well with a green salad. Next time I will put broccoli or some other green veggie in with the noodles.

I'm not quite sure why this is rated so highly.  I thought that flavor was lacking in this recipe, and it wasn't worth the calories that it contains.  It was okay, but not great.  Doubtful that I will be making this again.

This recipe was very good.  My friends enjoyed it.  I cooked some diced ham and onions in a skillet and added it to the sauce.  I also added more cream for more sauce.  This worked out great.

We all LOVED this. Three boys 5,8,9 and my husband loved this. Used ziti instead for the noodles, put in more garlic and had to use evaporated milk. Turned out awesome! Would make again and for friends! Thanks.

Excellent Dinner!  Only thing I did different was to add about a cup of p.cheese to make the sauce thicker.  My husband added crushed red pepper flakes for a little spice...not for me though.  all 3 of my children cleaned there bowls and 2 of them had 2nd.

Great recipe.  I found this recipe about 2 years ago and still make it on a regular basis.  I add mushrooms to the garlic and chicken (or sometimes saute beforehand).  My husband and I like more sauce, so I double the cream and parmasean or just make less pasta.

This sauce was yummy. I did the following alterations: doubled the sauce (garlic, basil, cheese & cream) and added 1/4 shredded white cheddar. I also added one red bell pepper when the chicken was almost done, it gives it a very nice flavor.

Easy to make, and so fast!  (Almost too fast, I was rushing to prepare broccoli for a side and getting the table set, etc. Lol)  I only had about 2/3 cup cream, so I used 1% milk for the remainder and thickened the sauce with flour.  My sauce got almost too thick, but I was in too much of a hurry to thin it out again.  I added a chopped orange bell pepper for color/flavor.  Nice mild flavor, and you can taste the garlic, which I appreciate.  I used fresh basil instead of dried.  I used Trader Joe's whole wheat rotini, and served steamed broccoli on the side.

I really like this pasta dish.  My husband says it's just ok.  While I agree it's not full of flavor, there's just something about it that I like.  Maybe because it's so easy to make.  :o)

After other reviews I expected this to be a little more flavourful but it turned out to be a bit bland. Good for a basic recipe but needs to be spiced up a bit.

This is my first time really cooking anything. I'm not a big cream or cheese eater so I just threw all the ingredients together and hoped for the best. My mom absolutely raved about it. I'm so happy this was my first real cooked meal! Thanks!!

I will definitely make again!!

ps. I used the entire heavy cream carton (2 cups?) and doubled the parmesan. I also sprinkled mozzerella over the pasta before adding the sauce. Gave it a nice cheesy look.

I made this last night and did make a few changes based on the other reviews.  I did double the sauce, added more garlic, mushrooms, cayenne pepper, and a few drops of hot sauce.  I also grilled my chicken on the grill for extra color.  Very good.  This one is a keeper.

What a tasty yet SIMPLE recipe! The garlic and basil are excellent to spice up chicken.  I recommend serving over a skinny pasta, like angel hair, or even rice. I also added 2 tablespoons of flour at the end to thicken up the cream sauce.  Foolproof and guaranteed to deliver a wonderfully delicious and filling meal!

Excellent recipe. I added sun dried tomatoes and fresh basil instead of dried.It was fabulous. I think next time I will add more cream since I didn't have enough sauce (I like mine with alot of sauce). Not a bite leftover! Perfect for a dinner party with nice wine.

It's a keeper.

This was really good, I used fresh basil which I think would've made it tastier than dried.

This recipe was really quick and compatible with ingrediatns I already had in my pantry. I did use a Parmesan/Romano cheese mix instead and I think it complimented nicely. I also doubled the garlic.

I didn't really like the sauce in this dish.  I think it's personal becasue my fiance really liked it. It was very bland. The sauce was really runny after boiling it and letting it simmer for 4 min, so I had to cook it a little longer to make it thicker.

What a recipe!  I took the advice of most of the other reviewers and doubled the heavy cream.  I also added chopped roasted red peppers to the sauce to give it a kick . . .YUM!!

My guests really liked this dish, but I actually found it to be a little bland. Not sure what I did wrong/differently. I won't be making this again unless my husband specifically requests it.

This was good and easy to make. Added some crushed red peppers to add some heat. Also didn't have heavy cream on hand so I used a jar of Alfredo sauce- worked just fine. Will make again!

Good and quick recipe.  I would recomend a stronger cheese like Asiago, Romano, or Gorgonzola for this recipe.  The Parmesian wasn't enough flavor for me.

Absolutely wonderful!  I added 1/4 cup of peas and some sun dried tomato flakes to add some color and it looked great.

This is a very good recipe, and doesn't take any longer to cook than pasta by itself.
Buttered garlic bread is a great side for this dish.
The recipe says it doesn't reheat well, but it did fine for me in the microwave in a covered bowl with a little water added.

"Out of the box" Easy, flavorful and quick to make.  Of course I'm going to toy with some seasoning for my own, personal flavor, but delicious as is.

I thought it was terrific.  I am on a diet where I can have fat but not with carbos, and this was excellent served over greenbeans instead of pasta.  It also goes well substituting veggies for the chicken and using dill instead of basil.  Two thumbs up!

Super easy to make, and tastes really good, but the sauce is a little thin.  Overall, excellent--especially the taste.

I had a similar dish at Macaroni Grill that I'd been craving and this recipe came very close. I used bowtie pasta and added fresh mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes and substituted the cream with evaporated milk.

If you like garlic, basil, and parmesan, this recipe was very nice.
The next time I make it, for a change of pace I may add a little white
wine and sauteed fresh mushrooms.

Excellent taste, agree that should be eaten at first sitting. Extremely easy to prepare. Even the kids like it.
