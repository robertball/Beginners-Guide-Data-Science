Good start for a fry dip. I added a few things to make it more personal. The longer this sits, the better it gets. REALLY REALLY good with homemade jo-jo's.

Sounds weird but is so strangly good! My grandma use to make this every Christmas eve and I've never known anyone outside our family who'd had this! Tastes even better before you know whats in it, so don't tell them what it is before they taste it!

We always use sour cream, cream cheese and cottage cheese. Approximately equal amounts and grated the onion.

We grew up having this, but like cyncia, used cream cheese. Rae mentioned it needs a kick or something. We grate the onion instead of mince it and add the juice that comes from the grating also. I really think this gives it a different flavor than just mincing. If you find it's overpowering, just add a lil more ketchup.

eh...I whooped this together after realizing our store bought dip had gone bad. It was very simple and quick, but my husband described it as "bland". It did the job for dipping chips, but needs something to give it a kick...?

i eat too much mayonnaise & ketchup with everything, so i'm not sure my opinion counts:   i found that this was even better with mayonnaise instead of sour cream.  tried (and loved it) 
with fried chicken, chips, and hot dogs.  the minced onion was a great idea, too.

This was ok. But I think it needed more spices or maybe even just some horseradish for a bit of kick.

I made this right before we sat down to eat.  It was too tangy; but after 15 minutes, it tasted sooo much better!  You need to let the flavors sit and combine for at least a half hour. I only added a tablespoon of basil. Super good!

We thought this was okay. Needs a little bit of a kick or something. All I really tasted was onion. I would add some hot sauce to it next time.
