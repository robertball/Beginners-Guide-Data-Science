This was insanely sweet.  Was easy to cut by adding more bourbon (yippee) and soda to the glass.  My guests thought it was tasty.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a two gallon plastic baggie.  Kept it in the freezer for a few days before serving.  When it came time for serving i put some ice cubes in an ice bucket, placed the bag in and closed the top.  It stayed slushy for a good 5 hours.  Will I make it again?  Only if someone requests it.  Too sweet for me.  _ those of you afraid of the bourbon- don't be; it adds a nice warmness to the end of the sip.

It's kind of a bourbon margarita for the holidays - my major complaint is that it's VERY sweet, and you can't really adjust the proportions to address that.  I would recommend to most people to try a party punch instead.
