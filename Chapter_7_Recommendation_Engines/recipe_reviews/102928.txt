This soup is my new favorite black bean recipe.  I used 4 cloves  of garlic and 3 cans of beans.  I pureed the fruit with a little water in the blender instead of cooking to soften,(banana was very ripe).  I had to make myself add that fruit but it absolutely made the soup.  I also didn't puree the entire soup, just used the stick blender and gave it a quick buzz.

I thought that this tasted like a sweet bean dip. I don't reccommond blending the soup if you actually want it to be soup. If you want bean dip, blend away.

This is an awesome blend of flavors - don't be afraid of the combination.  It's very satisfying and even my kids loved it.  I didn't find I needed to puree the soup; it was cooked down pretty well on its own and we liked the small chunks of beans that were left.  Thanks, will make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I forgot the hot sauce.  Even so, I was expecting a much stronger sweet/fruity taste.  Also, mine was much lighter in color than the one in the picture.  I think next time I'll add another can of black beans to thicken it, and maybe try a different brand of coconut milk.  The soup was still really good; it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  I kinda felt like chopping the banana and mango was a waste of time because I could barely taste it.  I also think I would consider only blending part of it.

Excellent soup.  Partially hand blended and served with cilantro as suggested by a previous review.  Thought of the Carrebean, Rum drinks, and dreadlocks.  Thanks

Husband thought this was better than average, I thought it was GREAT. I used 3 cans of black beans and 4 cloves of garlic, and only 3/4 banana.  I also used chicken broth instead of veggie broth because I was out.  Turned out perfect.  Next time I might throw some cilantro on there.

My husband loved this, no one else (two kids and a brother-in-law) commented or got seconds. I served it over rice to make a meal. A little too sweet for my taste, but I'll probably make it again for my husband.

Amazingly Wonderful!! Made just as stated except added a whole jalepeno with the onions...just wonderful Spicy with a hint of sweet! Do not be afraid of the odd sounding mix of ingredients you will not be sorry.
Thank You So Much Doug for sharing this!

Turned out exactly as I imagined it would.  Very tasty! I didn't alter the recipe, but next time I'll add more hot sauce.

Perfect!  We made some modifications to make this one quick and easy for us by using our slowcooker: dumped 2 cans of beans with liquid.  measured out one mango worth of frozen pineapple, mango, and peaches, slow cooked on high for 1 1/2 hrs.  After 1 1/2 hrs. added in bannana.  Then, cooked for another 1 hr. Also, used 1 tsp. ginger, 1 TBS.  coconut oil instead of olive oil. We didn't have any coconut milk on hand.   Added an extra 1/2 cup of water.  Placed little food processor next to slowcooker and strained out the fruit and some of the veggies and chopped them in it.  We used a vegetable broth that contained oregano, but it didn't hurt the flavor at all. Garnish with one TBS. cilantro and diced yellow pepper.  Thanks.

My husband and I both really like this soup. I suggest going light on the banana and heavy on the hot sauce! It could also use an extra can of beans to be thicker, but is great as-is too.

Wow! The sweetness of the mango really comes through and balances the spicy just perfectly. I didn't have hot sauce, so I subbed 1/2 tsp of cayenne powder, which added some nice heat. I also used 3 cloves garlic and 3 cups cooked black beans, instead of 2 cans of beans. I think I'd bump up the amount of ground ginger next time, too, since that flavor was a little buried.

I blended in the pot with a stick blender and left it just a little chunky. The consistency was great -- thick enough that it wasn't soupy, but not so thick as to constitute a bean dip (as one reviewer experienced).

All in all, a fabulous and creative flavor combination that I'd definitely make again.

Nice and healthy and unique soup.  The sour cream was a must to top it off.  Rich black bean flavor with a big sweet note from the fruit.

Just like the other reviewers, I also urge people to try this recipe even though it has seemingly odd ingredients.  The mango is definitely key, so don't substitute that for anything else!

I added a diced jalepeno to the onion, pepper, and garlic.  Also increased the garlic to ~3 cloves.  Used three cans of black beans.  Halved the Tabasco and added a dash of paprika and cayenne pepper.  Only blended 1/2 of the soup and left the other part chunky.  Added a handful of chopped cilantro at the end.  Topped with fat free plain greek yogurt instead of whipped cream.  GREAT! Picky fiance and not-so-picky me both thought it was great.  Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic! I used the Thai Sri racha sauce and it was spicier than I anticipated, but it was perfect! The cumin adds an almost curry flavor.  I will be making this again!

Good! Surprising! I added a little lime juice, and hand blended the whole thing right in the pot. I used frozen mango, and topped it all with sour cream and cilantro. Lots of compliments at a dinner party. Neat idea!

Used canned re fried black beans instead of whole and added a jalapeno with the onions. Very different. Very Caribbean.

I had to make 2 small changes, I had only Sriracha, which I thought was perfect with the other flavors and I had to sub 1/2&1/2 for the coconut milk.  This was the perfect soup for a frigid, cold day.  The flavors all come through, but none are overpowering.  Thanks, Doug, we really enjoyed this.

This is a lot like plátanos fritas y frijoles con crema, not surprising since it is basically the same ingredients. My extended family liked it a lot; my husband did not, because he does not like any kind of sweet food for dinner, although this is not terribly sweet. I separated some out for him before I put in the mangoes, bananas, coconut milk and ginger.

O.k. so I like to try soup recipes out on my family -- we have found a few really good favorites that way.  However, I would not recommend trying this recipe out on your kids -- maybe an adventurous spouse or friend.  The banana/mango/coconut milk combination was just really weird and overly sweet.  I gave it a 2 because it was at least interesting.  Maybe the banana was too ripe, I don't know.  I cooked up some peppers and onions to add at the end to try and save it and that did help some.  The color was really strange pureed.

Well, I was so excited to try this but in the end it just has way too many flavors going on in here. The bananas are a mistake for sure. I was hoping to love it. I will not ever make this again!!

Hubby says "Add this to our Greatest Hits list!" Like others, I also used 3 cans of beans, 4 garlic cloves, defrosted frozen mango chunks, used an immersion blender leaving some chunks, and garnished with cilantro instead of red pepper. Unusual flavor combo, but very tasty!
