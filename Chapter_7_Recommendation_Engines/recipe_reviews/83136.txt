This recipe is just what it appears to be, a very good basis for several dishes.  It isn't meant to be eaten straight, use it as a basis for tacos, burritos,enchiladas or (my favorite) quesadillas.  It works very well, and is almost identical to my family's basic recipe for carnitas.  Well done, and thanks so much for putting it back in writing for me.

The canned green chillis didn't work for me. The flavor lacked that fresh character and the color wasn't too appetizing. Switching to fresh chillis and adding some late in the game may help. Expiriment from here and I think there is a good recipe hiding.

did in crockpot for nine hours on low.  Instead of adding green chilies, I added a can of petite diced tomatoes with green chilies & doubled the garlic - DELISH!!!  thanks for sharing :)

Delicious recipe! Other reviewers nailed it when they said move it to a skillet add more chili powder, cumin, and oregano. Yum!

very good!  I followed the recipe fairly closely, added extra garlic , and medium heat Pace green taco salsa instead of broth, because i didn't have any broth.

Pretty good.  Bf and I both liked it; bf ate seconds.  I used already shredded and cooked pork in this recipe bc that's what I had.  Very easy and although it's not quick, it's a nice meal.  I've never had carnitas before (at least I don't think I have) and I was pleased.  Thanks for the recipe.
