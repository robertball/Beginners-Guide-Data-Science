Yikes - this time it was different - I have made this recipe many times over with fabulous results - this last time I used generic oreo cookies and it significantly didn't taste as good. I didn't tell my family and they noticed something wasn't quite the same right off the bat (they said it was OK but not as good). Advice: use only Oreos or Hydrox/Sunshine cookies.

Delightful! As Hubs put it a real collage of flavors and textures what with the moist cake crunchy Oreos creamy chocolate chips and sweet gooey glaze. I used a pound cake mix as I believe it tastes more homemade and has less of that artificial flavor yellow cake mixes have (a French Vanilla cake mix would have been a fine choice too). I reserved some of the Oreos for the top leaving them in bigger chunks. It's a pretty cake striking with it's layering and sharp black and white colors interesting and really very good.

This is WONDERFUL!! A new favorite at our house!! I used a Butter Recipe Chocolate Cake (the ONLY butter recipe cake mix I could find) and rather than making their glaze I just served it with vanilla ice-cream with chocolate syrup on BOTH! WOW!! YUUUUMMMMMYYYYY!! (I used it for my son's 4th birthday party with a construction theme and it was GREAT because it looks like dirt on top and we used construction truck candles on top! PERFECT!) I'm not a chocaholic but I sure like this one!

Oreos are one of my favorite foods and this cake is another one of the amazing things that you can do with them! I used a chocolate butter cake mix and extra semi-sweet chocolate chips. The cake was extremely moist and so very rich. I made the cake for a party and it was complemented all night. Everyone begs me for this recipe.

Great! It disappeared fast. The only change I made was I put ALL of the cookie crumbs into the middle and then frosted the cake with chocolate frosting. Try it also with chocolate cake mix.

At the advice of some other reviewers I used chocolate butter recipe cake mix (Betty Crocker) and "slipped" and put in an extra hand-full of chocolate chips. I used a majority of the cookie crumb mixture in the middle of the cake and the rest functioned as more of a garnishment on the top. I also made a splash of extra glaze. The cake came out awesome but not to excessive fanfare due to it being rather rich after a big meal. It tastes JUST LIKE the Krispy Kreme devil's food doughnuts and therefore I would suggest this to go well with coffee. When I make it again I will definitely make more glaze though. (Hint: Poke holes with the handle of a fork in the cake before pouring the glaze... awesome!) Great easy recipe.

This recipe is fabulous as cupcakes also. Just cut the oreo crumble mixture in half and only put in the middle layer not on the top. I used vanilla cake mix (DH not available in all stores but I found it at Safeway) added an extra tsp of vanilla and it was perfect! I also used mini chocolate chips and I thought it worked well.

This cake had no flavor. I was expecting oreo cookie heaven and I ended up with flavorless cake. Since the cake is oreo cookie on top I couldn't frost it so it was just dry and boring. It received so many great reviews and I bake all the time. I have no idea what went wrong.

I made a butter cake from scratch instead of the mix for this recipe and I have to say-- I'm not a fan of this cake. The chocolate chips overpowered the Oreo flavor and I will definitely leave the chocolate chips out next time (if there is one). The consistency of the cake batter made it hard to spread the other 1/2 of the batter on top of the first layer of Oreos. Overall the flavor was mediocre however the texture was nice-- but that is thanks to Mary Oppenhiemer's Butter Cake recipe not this one! Bae

I made this cake yesterday and it was good not spectacular. After reading the reviews I was expecting it to blow me away but it didn't. It was just a good chocolate cake. I did frost it with a pre-made chocolate buttercream frosting but other than that I made it exactly by the directions. Again good chocolate cake recipe but nothing special.

I used a chocolate cake mix instead of the butter cake mix. I put cake mix in two 8-9 inch round pans. Then I sprinkled the cookie mixture over the top of both and pressed it onto the top of the cake mix. After it cooled I used the filling from the Chocolate Covered Oreo Cookie Cake recipe in Allrecipes as the filler in between the two layers and for the topping. All the guests at my daughter s birthday party loved it! I will definitely make it again.

I made a mistake when I made this cake but admit that it was still a hit. I used yellow cake mix (or butter?) not chocolate. Not sure what I was thinking. Anyhow - the first day that we ate this (the day it was made) I wasn't impressed. But it got better as it sat and everyone loved it more. I also made double the glaze recipe. It looked better with more glaze (and of course tasted better...) A big hit!

I mixed the chips/oreos mixture right into the cake batter instead of layering it. I baked it in (2) 8" rounds-they were very full but baked up very nicely without spillage. I was planning to make a 4 layer cake w/a filling in between but it's so good we keep munching on it plain:) I'll definately hang on to this recipe to use in the future!

This recipe was good but not great. I did not really like the butter cake with this recipe...maybe a vanilla cake or even chocolate. I also made a chocolate glaze instead and thought that there could be more frosting in the recipe.

FANTASTIC cake. I followed the recipe exactly and I loved it. I probably will add a few more chocolate chips next time. I also LOVED the idea for a little boys birthday cake. My oldest son will be 3 and he loves dump trucks and bulldozers so the cake will be perfect for his party. This cake is a WINNER!!

This cake was very easy to make and turned out yummy. I used a butter recipe chocolate cake mix but I think the white cake mix would be good too. I think I put too much of the oreo mixture on the top and after baking it looked like the glaze would all just run off the cake so I didn't use it. Next time I will put less of the oreo mixture on the top poke holes in the cake and pour on the glaze.

This was nice jazzed-up box cake recipe. I don't care for glaze so I frosted it with cool whip and added more crushed oreos on top. The oreos didn't stay layered; they sunk to the bottom. I don't know if that was something I did wrong. It still tasted good though!

Excellent flavor! I did mine in a tube pan next time I'll use a bunt pan though. Obviously had to bake longer (maybe 20 mins). Added an extra cookie and extra choco chips! therwise I followed the directions butter golden cake - Duncan Hines. Would be great with a glass of milk!!

Made this cake tonite and used a white cake mix. I sprinkled with extra chocolate chips on each layer. I then made a chocolate buttercream frosting and piped it all over the cake. It was delicious. I baked it for 40 minutes but I may bake it for a few minutes less next time bc it seemed a little over baked but it still tasted great!!!

Good flavor and well received but with crumb topping inside and on top overall the cake was quite heavy (without much "rise") and a bit too sweet. I used mint Oreos skipped the glaze and topped w/ ice cream. Probably worth making again but next time I'll make half or quarter the amount of crumb mixture and just put it on top.

I like the recipe but thought it needed a bit more of the cookie mixture. I also thought the glaze was a little too thin so I added an extra 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar to thicken.

Great tasting cake. I read that someone suggested a French Vanilla Cake so that is what I used. I wanted to use a Chocolate Butter cake mix but I couldn't find one anywhere for some reason! It still tasted delicious though but it may need some more oreos!!

I loved the idea of this cake but after reading some of the other reviews I was not pleased with the idea of a dry cake especially with Oreo's the chocolate cookie is dry enough. I HAD to make sure this cake was moist so I made some alterations. First instead of a butter recipe cake mix I used Duncan Hines Signature French Vanilla cake mix. Second I added about half of a small can of sweetened condensed milk to the batter. I added the rest of the sweetened condensed milk to the cookie mix. When the cake was done I let it cool for about 10 minutes in the freezer so it wasn't too hot. Still warm I poked a few holes into the top with a fork and poured about 2-3 times as much glaze and drenched it so that it would soak into the cake. I then melted some left over chocolate chips with a little butter and spread it on the top center (when cooled it hardens into a fudge like consistency) and then added some birthday cake flavored Oreo's around the melted chocolate for decoration. After all this it went in the fridge to cool completely until ready to serve. The end product was A-MAZING! Will definitely use this again and again!

Tasty! I bought a pkg of Oreos for my husband and he never ate them. So I found this recipe and it looked tasty. I like how it makes the oreo crumbs soft. I also topped with homemade whipped cream that I lightly sweetened.

Tried this receipe and my family members loved it!!!! It was super moist and fluffy and you could really taste the cookie flavor in the cake. Only semi issue I had the cake semi dropped in the center of my round cake pan.

I am baking this right now with a few changes... my fiance loves Lemon Oreos. So I bought a package of thise and used lemon cake mix. I also added a package of lemon pudding to the cake mix to make it super moist. I made a little extra glaze and added a teaspoon of lemon extract to that too. I'm not too worried about it being overly lemon as the cookies are lemon creme filled and they are just golden cookies. wish me luck!!! smells good and looks amazing so far!

This was a really good cake. It is simple to make and the family all enjoyed it. The cookies and the glaze on the top was the best part of the cake and so I might add more to that part next time I make it. I did not give it 5 stars only because I would not say it was one of my favorites ever but I would definitely make it again since it is so easy to make.

I used choc chunks instead of chips and didn't crush the Oreos really fine;left them a but chunky. And I did the glaze but also made a caramel glaze (dark brown sugar stick of butter and milk) to drizzle over the top. YUM
