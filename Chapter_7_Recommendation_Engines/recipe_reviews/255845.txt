A co-worker made this and it was great!  The flavor was lovely, and the sauce it created gave it a decadent texture. Definitely serve warm!

This was a good treat with interesting textures. It was very easy to make and was well-received. If I made it again, I would increase the amount of chocolate in the cake before I felt it needed more flavor.
