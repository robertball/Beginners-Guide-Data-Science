Great recipe! I used half chipotle mayo, doubled the bacon and mixed the bacon strait into the egg yolks. Everyone loved it :)

Delicious! I think next time I will keep a bit of the seeds/membranes in the peppers to give them a little spice, but other than that, these were great...a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yummy!  But then what's not to love?  I used a red jalapeno and Dijon mustard and followed the recipe.  No salt or pepper needed in these!  I want to try these with all different kinds of mustard!  Thank you so much, Russell!

Very good.  Next time I will leave out the mustard, or use much less, or sub a bit of vinegar.  Just too many flavors competing, for me. I wanted to taste more of the cheese and bacon but felt that the mustard competed and didn't really add to the overall flavors.

Both my son and I thought these were the best deviled eggs we've ever had (so far). So many recipes, so little time.

I used the following modifications (based on what I had at home).  1/2 the egg yolks, 1/2 of regular mayo, 1/2 of the spicy mustard, 1/2 the cheese, 1 tsp of hot sauce, and the full amount of jalapenos and bacon.  All of those ingredients were pureed and then added mayo, spicy mustard and more hot sauce to taste.  I used my large cupcake decorating kit to put into the egg halves and topped with crumbled bacon (adding cheese and jalapenos would look nice as well).   I'm not a huge deviled egg fan, but between the guests and myself, this was our favorite recipe ahead of the buffalo blue cheese deviled eggs.   This will be my go to party food.

Excellent and easy - crowd favorite.  Spice intolerant friends so used mild whole Chili peppers and they worked wonderfully.  Wasn't sure what to do with the sliced peppers called for so draped them over the top of the filling and then put the bacon and paprika on.

Made these for 4th of July party.  They were delicious. Some friends were afraid to try them because I labeled them jalapeno, but since I took out the seeds & membrane, they had some kick, but were not HOT.  I did half the mustard. The recipe said 3 jalapenos, and to cut 2 into fine stripes, but did not say what to do with them.  One picture had them "sticking out" of the egg, but the picture with the recipe didn't.  That is what I did.  It also helped "labeled them" as the jalapeno eggs as opposed to the other regular deviled eggs I made.  You should explain what to do with those 2 peppers .

I substituted with sriracha mayo and mixed some of the bacon in, as well as using it as a garnish. Everyone loved them. An 8 year old told me they were better than cake!

I never even liked deviled eggs before this recipe. I’m obsessed but I also love fresh jalapeños, & bacon of course! I use a little bit of the bacon grease in the mix too. Highly recommended!!

Delicious! My family raved about these, none left after Thanksgiving dinner, unfortunately for me. I did add black pepper, dill, and smoked paprika for a little more flavor.

I've made this twice so far - they are better than regular deviled eggs.  I have farm fresh eggs and am always looking for a way to use them.  I did 18 of them with 3 large jalapenos, increasing the other ingredients by 50%  I used lite mayo and regular yellow mustard & paprika, skipping the onion.  Took them to a potluck and they were gone in a flash.

Took these for Easter dinner.  I am not usually a fan of deviled eggs but I really liked these. I come from a family of cooks and everyone loved them.  I used light Hellmans and they were great!

Made this once. Now I'm required to make them for every function. Of course I put my own little spin on them with applewood smoked bacon and more cheese. I also add more smoked paprika to give them a more smoky flavor.

Added the left over jalapeno slices to the top.  Used pre-packaged bacon crumbles in place of the crumbled bacon as I managed to burn an entire package of bacon and it turned out really well!  Also added a touch of prepared horseradish for a little extra "kick".

These taste wonderful, and didn’t last more than an hour at Superbowl! I followed the recipe exactly, but next time, I’ll add a little more jalapeño to the mix for more heat. One side note I’d like to make- You can make these the night before, but don’t fry and add the bacon until you’re ready to serve. I made this mistake, and the bacon was soggy and flaccid by morning. I will definitely be making these babies again!

For an extra kick, use Smoked half sharp Hungarian Paprika for the dusting... It is SO much better than the standard Spanish Sweet

It's okay, not as spicy a I thought it would be,   I am going to add one or two more jalapenos  to give it a little kick.  With one jalapeno, I can't even taste the pepper, no kick.  Otherwise,  a very nice variation on a traditional favorite.

Only change was we used one larger jalapeño instead of three small,  and miracle whip instead of mayo. It was awesome!

Peppers I used had no heat to them at all so for my taste I could have added some cayenne; my wife, however, loved them. and we made a second batch for a get together with her friends.

Everyone loved them!  Not at all spicy.  I am going to try leaving the seeds in the minced  jalapeno that is added to the egg yolk mixture.

Used serrano peppers instead of jalapenos. I also used Grey Poupon mustard instead of brown mustard. Turned out amazing. I also added minced garlic.

Delicious!!! We loved these. To satisfy all tastes I substituted red onion with yellow and lessened the amount so as not to overpower. We put the jalapeño on top instead of mixing it in, which was great for those who didn't want too much heat.

The flavors of all the ingredients did not mesh together well.  The cheese being the main one.  This is just ok.  I will not make again.

Very yummy.  Even my picky kids loved them.  I do mix the bacon into the mixture before filling the eggs.

Awesome.  Add a little more mayo for a creamier filling.

These are a fav around my house.  They  are usually gone within 30 minutes.  Great for any get together, including football parties.   It's rare to see regular deviled eggs anymore here!

Between the bacon and the cheddar cheese they were just too salty. Unfortunately, the jalapeno I bought had very little heat.  Overall, not what I expected.
