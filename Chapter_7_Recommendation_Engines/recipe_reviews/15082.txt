The apple pie was delicious and no-one guessed that it was sugar-free! I added a dash of ginger and used a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg and this worked out really well. Try it!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving Day for the simple fact that I'm a borderline diabetic and I hate it when others get to eat pie and I can't. After the meal was over and all had their desserts...I looked around and the apple pie was gone and several were asking where I got the pie at and I told them that I made it and they said, "No Way!" So I would like to say Thank You for submitting this recipe and I truly recommend it to everyone.

I made this pie with 1 cup of Splenda for baking & added probably 1/2 stick of butter into the mixture for a more "authentic" apple pie taste. I used 5 big Granny Smith apples, and it wasn't too tart. I've never made an apple pie using cornstarch, but this worked out great because it made the sweetened spice/butter mixture stick to every single piece of the cut up apples. It was the perfect combination of sweet & tart. It was so delicious no one could believe it was sugar free! I will definitely make this again!

This recipe turned out really good. I have an insulin dependent diabetic family member and he was the only one informed that it was sugar free so he could have a piece of the pie.He didn't feel left out at dessert. Everyone raved about how good it was.

A safe low glycemic index sweetner is agave nectar. A 1/4 cup of agave nectar can be used instead of 1 cup of sugar, and it would not spike your blood sugar, and it taste great!!! Use the agave nectar. It is better than honey and maple syrup because it is is lowest of the GI chart!!

I stumbled across this recipe on my way to finding another apple pie recipe.  I ended up trying this one instead and so glad I did!  This pie is wonderful-and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to cut back on their sugar intake.  Thanks for posting this one!

I've made this in the apple version twice now... once on Thanksgiving and once on Christmas eve!  My father is diabetic so I like to make things he can eat, but the pie was a hit with everyone... especially my husband who doesn't have to eat sugar free!

Everyone loves this pie, diabetic or not. I add more butter (3tbs) and upped the cinnamon. Try grating fresh nutmeg into the pie, it will make it even better!

Wow..I made 2 of these babies for our Thanksgiving Dinner. I used refrigerated crusts instead of frozen. I used Granny Smith apples. I had NO pie leftover. Not one person guessed they were sugar free either. I made one with a lattice top and it turned out beautiful. The other had heart shapes cut out. Excellent recipe..Thank you!

My husband is diabetic and he loved this (he didn't know it was sugar free!)  It turned out perfect!  Juicy but not runny and perfectly sweet (I only used 12 sweetner packets because my apples were really sweet!) Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous!  I made this for a party and we had three guests who need to watch their sugars.  I used Splenda as a sugar replacement and it really tasted great.  But this would also be good using regular sugar as a non dietetic pie.

I made this for a co-worker that always misses out on the office treats because he cannot have sugar.  Instead of apples,I used blackberries (omitted nutmeg and cinnamon).  My co-worker RAVED about it and said he and his whole family loved it.  Can't wait to make it again, this time with the apples and I will use the nutmeg and cinnamon.

Shirley, you're a genious!  I made apple pie using your ingredients & it was a huge hit with the family, including my Type I diabetic son!  I made two pies, one with the double crust & the 2nd with a streusel top...both were amazing.  Only two things I will do differently next time...I will precook the apples for a few minutes, perhaps simmer them in the sauce...they weren't cooked enough to my liking. 2nd, I'll follow a tip I read & bake it on my baking stone.  I was wondering how it would be if I used Splendid brown sugar?  I'll have to try that.  So thanks for posting this!!

This pie is a regular request from my father whom is diabetic, but everyone else that is not requests the pie as well.  My daughter is learning how to cook and this has become one of her signature desserts for our gatherings.  We appreciate you sharing this with our family.

I am getting ready to try this recipe based on the good reviews.  Would it be OK to substitute Splenda for Aspartame.   Would the amount of sweetner remain the same?  Beth

I made this for my aunt and she loved it. She is diabetic so we still have to make sure she takes it easy as there is natural sugar in the fruit. My cousin who is an apple pie fiend managed to wrestle a slice away from my aunt and she also said it was delicoius.  This will now be our standard apple pie recipe as we are always looking to cut calories, and one apple pie made per holiday is more than enough (along with the pecan and pumpkin of course).

I used the sweetest Georgia peaches for this pie.  I followed the recipe to a "T," and it was runny, runny, runny.  I had made other sugarfree pies that didn't completely set up so after reading the reviews on this one I thought, well maybe the steps taken in this recipe will make for a better pie as far as it setting up.   Boy was I wrong, this one didn't set up at all.  It was a flop and not only that it tasted bad.  I will go back to my old way of making sugar free pies.  I'm glad however, everyone else had luck with it, but for me it was a bomb.

remember to those cooking for diabetics that it may be 'sugar free' , fruit itself is a sugar as are the carbohydrates used. ( flour , pie shell)  just a helpful fyi - in other words ? you can't eat half the pie !! just because it's white sugar free !!!  great pie recipe however !!

It's hard finding sugar free deserts and this one was a pleasant surprise. Everyone loved it. I made it with Grandma's Secret Pie Crust.  It was a hit. This is a keeper.

Thank you for this recipe. My relative is diabetic and needs to have sugarless desserts. Pieos his favorite. I have read warnings that recipes for sugarless pies often add juice causing hidden/additional sources of sugar. THIS ONE DOES NOT. He enjoyed this one so much stating he liked it better than any other bakery/store bought sugarless he has tried. He asked to take the rest home after the holiday party too.  Thank you. It will be used again he is a fan.

My 13 yr old daughter wanted to make it for my father who is Diebetic.  She decided to make 2 since they my kids are limited to their sugar intake and it was a hit with everyone else.  So everyone else had one pie and the other one was left for my dad.  Even the older teens liked it.  Thank you for supplying a recipe that will remain in my family from now on.  Everyone gave her "Kuddos" for making it, and it made her feel so proud of herself. Thank you again and many blessings.

Good pie!  I used golden delicious apples and 10 packets of sweetener and it was the perfect sweetness.

I just made the pie and mine does seem a little runny too but its still very hot so I'll wait and see.  My son and I both tried it and its okay not bad and I always use sweet n low sweetener but I could definitely tell a difference but we'll see after it sets I just hope my husband who is the diabetic likes it.

I have been making this pie for the last several years for my Father who is diabetic...no one can ever tell that it doesn't have any real sugar in it.  I use Splenda and it is actually very good!!!
