I decided not to pay attention to the reviews and go ahead and make this cake.  Big mistake this was absoultely terrible.  I had a lot of lemons and I wanted to get rid of them this was not the way I should have done it the taste was an absolute waste of my lemons.

I found this cake to be a pain in the tooth. Very sweet and not easy to transport to another place. But still something you should try if you like old fashion recipes.

The efforts put into making this cake are not worth the results.
