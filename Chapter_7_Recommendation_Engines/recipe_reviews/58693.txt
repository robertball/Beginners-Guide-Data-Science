My husband and I did enjoy this quiche.  We made a few changes to make it a little healthier.  We used Egg Beaters, reduced fat swiss cheese (Jarlsberg Lite), and fat free condensed milk.  I highly suggest that you use a deep dish pie crust.  We also had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes.  It came out very tasty and we will make this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at making a quiche and my husband and I both loved it!  I substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream for a lighter recipe and used old white cheddar and parmesan instead of swiss and romano cheese for a sharper taste.  I found the regular pie crust to be a little small; next time I'll use a deep pie crust.

This had great flavor even without added spices. I lightened it up by not using cream. I used one more egg, a good dash of milk and an extra tablespoon of flour mixed with the eggs. The texture was good and cooking time was cut by 5 min. Will make this again!

I had great hopes for this recipe; unfortunately, I found that it presented many problems.  First of all, only half of the leeks and cheese mixture fit into my deep-dish pie crust.  Secondly, the recipe recommends seasoning with salt and pepper as the last step--this was a mistake, since the tomatoes soaked up all of the salt and made for a very unpleasant taste.  And lastly, my quiche took twice as long to bake--and even then it was more like a soup.  We threw the whole thing away and ate leftovers.

This was a first-rate quiche! I only had one cup of milk, so I just used that and added an extra egg, as I prefer an eggier quiche. It turned out perfect--and very pretty to boot!

I would give it 4 1/2 stars. It was lovely and easy to make. I did make some changes though. I added garlic while I saut√©ed the leeks and I used Parmesan and Monterey Jack cheese as replacements for the other cheeses. These changes seemed to give it a little extra kick. I used the heavy cream...YUM!

This is so good! The only additions I made were some parsley and chives. Such an easy and elegant looking quiche. I think I might try adding a few asparagus spears next time.

I made this last night and it was super delicious!  I added some garlic and used 1 cup of each cheese and doubled the flour as I used milk instead of cream.  It not only tasted great but looked beautiful!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  I used sharp cheddar cheese and a 4 cheese parmesan type.  Definitely get the deep dish crust.

This is a nice, light tasting quiche.  I did not use the romano cheese, only swiss and added some fresh rosemary for taste.  It has a good flavor and was relatively simple to do.  I would recommend deep dish 9" pie crusts so as to not overflow.

This was incredibly easy to make and scrumptious!...while my son wasn't fond of the "green stuff" (the leeks) my husband on on the other hand couldn't get enough of it!...definately a do over as he was raving about it well into the following day!

My fiance made this for his first attempt at quiche. It was excellent!! He did make a few changes. He added bacan and saute'd the leeks in the bacon fat with some shallots as well. He also put a little hot sauce in the egg mixture and used a deep dish crust as others suggested. Yummy, he's actually making it again right now and I can't wait, smells delicious already!!

I left out the romano and cheated on the heavy cream.  I only used about a 3/4 cup since that's all I had and added alittle milk and alittle flour for the rest.  I used 1 less egg and less cheese so it wouldn't spill over.  I suggest adding the salt to the egg/cream mixture and not the top.  Very good.  Thanks!

Very good.  Simple, appetising.  Not super spectacular...  but definitly worth trying.  I will make this again.

only thought is to maybe use more flavor-ful, sharp cheeses...  I didnt get enough of that flavor.

Excellent flavor!!!  I followed recipe except used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream and it overflowed my deep dish crust so I would cut back  to 1 1/4 of the liquid.  Also used parmesan cheese instead of romano, but will definitely make again and again!

Simply delicious and easy to make! Definitely recommend using a deep dish pie crust, but I couldn't find one. So if you can't find a deep dish crust, I suggest omitting 1 egg and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Hubby didn't like the texture (his personal preference), but 4 other adults loved it! Will absolutely make this again!

Excellent quiche.  Fine, fresh ingredients make all the difference.  I skipped the tomatoes and everyone in my family loved it.

This quiche looked and smelled delicious. The problem I found was that it took an extra 25 minutes to cook - this made the pie crust much darker and less appealing. I would cover the crust with tin foil until the end. I wish I had read other's reviews before making the dish because there was too much milk/egg mixture for the pie crust - the suggestion about using a deep dish is a good one. I would also suggest mixing the salt/pepper in the egg mixture as well.

Really Really liked this one.  I only used 3 eggs since I didn't have deep dish.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 rather than cream.  Changed the cheese to mozzerella and cream cheese with chives (that's what I had).  I know I fiddled with the recipie, but it suited my taste perfectly.  Looked very nice as well.

Decrease the amount of ingredients a little and you'll be fine as long as you use a deep dish pie crust.  I have been making this recipe for a while now and enjoy changing it up from time to time; spinach, ham, bacon, mushrooms, black olives, etc.  As well as different cheeses.  You will have to cook it a bit longer than the recipe states.  I give this 4 stars because I use the egg & whipping cream mixture for whatever kind of quiche I am in the mood for.  I have never received a complaint from anyone.  Don't give up on this one, it has potential.

Excellent quiche recipe that can be modified for any ingredient you'd like to include. The only things I did differently were to add a little nutmeg to the cream/egg mixture,didn't put the tomatoes on top because I don't like baked tomatoes, and I used a homemade pie crust that wasn't frozen. This led to the edges being burned during the 15-min. first heating, so I will either freeze the crust in a pan next time, or play around with the temps. Thank you so much!

I used almond milk in place of part of the cream and it worked great. I sauteed 2 leeks with some fresh tarragon in olive oil and just a little butter for flavor. The recipe made enough for 2 9-inch pies. I pre-cooked the pie shell and put 1/2 of the cheese in first so it wouldn't get soggy. Then the rest of the cheese went on top of the tomatoes. Some aluminum went around the pie shell half-way through cooking (it could have been done a little earlier as the shell did get a little bit browner than I would have liked). It looked beautiful when done! A wonderful Mother's Day brunch!

This was awesome.  I loved it, and my husband declared it to be 'the best quiche he'd ever eaten'.  Thanks for a really nice recipe!  Oh- and that touch of tomato arranged on the top- delicious!

I have made this a few times now, and I think it is my absolute favorite food! It is so rich, creamy, and flavorful. I actually would rather eat this quiche than any dessert I can think of! Highly recommended.

I ended up with a lot more egg mixture than would fit into my pie pan and it overflowed a bit, too, but eating it was delightful. It was very tasty.

After reading the review by ZOZOMEL, I made a few changes.  I used only 2 eggs and 1 cup of cream.  I added the salt & pepper And 1 clove of garlic to the leeks while they cooked. I also used a roma tomato.

I made this exactly as written and used a tart pan and it came out perfectly! I had a little extra batter and just didn't pour it in. It was actually done ten minutes early. I served it at a party and it was gone in a flash and got rave reviews! It also looks lovely. I will definitely make this again!

Really delicious. Used half 1% milk/half sour cream in place of cream.

This recipe is amazing and I made it exactly as written the first time. Now instead of seasoning at the end I added salt and pepper to my leeks as I sauteed them. I also use evaporated milk instead of heavy cream because I like my quiche more dense and the cream makes it fluffy. Oh yes I also add bacon or ham when making this. My family l loves this quiche!

The family made this tonight.  We don't care for bacon and were glad to find this simple and luscious quiche recipe.  The leeks that I had came to more than 2 cups and used all of it anyway. There were a lot of reviews saying it was too much for a 9-inch pie.  I made a  crust to fit my 10-inch quiche pan and it was just right.  Wonderful texture, taste.  Served with steamed broccoli and white wine!  Definitely will save this recipe and make it again.

This recipe is mine and many other's favorite all time quiche! The only thing you have to do to make it perfect is use 2 pie crusts, this let's you use a whole 500ml carton of cream because really, what are you going to do with a drop of it anyway? (I use Whipping cream for best results.) And as well,you don't need to use any salt, just lightly dust the top off with white pepper before setting in the oven.. it's perfect. Follow these slight changes and you shall not fail!

Very delicious! But I ended up with a lot of leftover cream-egg mixture. I made mini quiches last night with a dough I already had and with the cheeses I had in hand (provolone and Parmegiano Regiano) and I was still delicious! I also add a little bit of green onions and white onions for taste.

I had some leeks on hand and went looking for a recipe to use them and found this.  It's delicious and I've made it twice now.  It fits perfectly in a standard 10" quiche dish (still with the 9" pie crust).  I had reduced the eggs based on comments the first time I made it and had to add more.  The 2nd time I made the recipe as given and it was just the right amount and cook time was correct also in the 10" dish. I also added some chopped kale into the egg mixture. Very easy and now a favorite.

This was a miss and a mess. After putting the leeks and cheese in the pie crust, there was little room left, so I had to throw out most of the organic eggs and cream mixture. What a waste of the eggs and expensive cheese. It took longer to cook, it was runny and nobody liked it. Please skip this one.

Delicious and easier than I expected! I made it in a cake pan instead of a pie pan to make it "deep dish", and the size was exactly right. I don't keep cream around so I used half 1% milk and half sour cream - it turned out great and definitely rich enough!

On my second time and adjusting for using a 10 inch quiche pan I made the following changes: 3 leeks, 1/2 TBSP minced garlic, 1/2 TBSP of Dijon mustard smeared on the cooked leeks and garlic, 1/3 cup of crumbled bacon, 1 1/4 cup of Swiss Longhorn  cheese, 1/3 cup of Romano Pecorino, 5 eggs and 1 pint of heavy cream and a generous TBSP of flour. I salted and peppered the leeks as they were cooking, and added the specified  amount of S & P  to the liquid.  I  spread the thinly sliced Roma tomatoes on top of the liquid  and sprinkled some Romano over them.  It was delicious and even though I normally don't care much for cooked  tomatoes  they were perfect with this recipe.  Thanks for submitting!

I doubled the recipe and used a tray.  I also substituted canned croissant dough instead of the frozen pie crust.  It did take longer to bake so check as you go

Very Good.  I added fresh mushroom, ham and used the cheese I had on hand, romano, parmesan, monterey jack and provel.  I also topped with shredded cheddar.  My advice, the tomatoes on top definitely add to the dish.  If you have good fresh tomatoes, make sure to top the quiche with them.  So good. I will make it again for sure.

I omitted the tomatoes and sauteed Swiss chard and bacon with the leeks instead. I also didn‚Äôt have any heavy cream (18%) so I used whipping cream (35%). I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and this made 2 x 9‚Äù quiches. It turned out amazing! Baking the quiche at the high temp for 15 min initially made all of the difference. I ended up baking it for an additional 45 minutes, rather than the recommended 30 minutes, at the lower temperature, and this resulted in a perfectly cooked, dark golden brown crust, even in the centre of the quiche. I also am in an area considered ‚Äúhigh altitude‚Äù for baking; this could also be the reason I had to increase the cooking time an extra 15 minutes. I will definitely make this recipie again!

This was my first attempt at quiche. It was wonderful! I made it exactly as instructed, only adding garlic when I saut√©ed the leeks and the salt and pepper to the egg mixture. I used a deep dish crust and it did overflow a tiny bit. It baked about 4-5 minutes longer than stated. I will be making this again!

Delicious every time. I seem to have to cook it longer, about 60 minutes at 165. But then I think I might add a bit too much cheese and leeks to begin with.

I started making this recipe when we lived in France a couple years ago. I've made it about once a month for the last 5 years. Sometimes with different kinds of cheese, sometimes with other substitutions. Today was with no leeks but the addition of chopped ham because that's what my granddaughter requested. Everything else was the same. It was perfect as always and was immediately devoured (2 slices each to said 9 year old granddaughter and her 9 year old cousin who had "never had quiche before")! I will note that over the years I've used varying combinations of milks, half and half, and cream in place of the heavy cream the recipe calls for. Lately, I ALWAYS go with the heavy cream. It results in the best, lightest texture.  A wonderful recipe and so easy, so fast! Consistent compliments every time!

I have actually made this 3 times. The first time, the family really liked it. The second time, it became a necessary addition to our special occasion menu...that's where it stayed. I didn't change a thing. using the best ingredients makes all the difference.

I have made this many times and love the recipe. I have had to make a few adjustments however, since as several people have mentioned, I couldn't get everything to fit into one pie crust. So, I usually make two. I use the full amount of leeks and the cheese mixture for each quiche, but I round up the cream to two cups, add an extra egg, and then split the milk and egg mixture between the two. I sometimes save half of the milk and egg mixture in the fridge to make the second quiche a few days later and haven't had any problems with that. I have also yet to try this with the tomatoes, because I seldom have them on hand, but I doubt it would change the quantities. I don't add salt or pepper. The cheese is flavorful enough on its own. My roommate and other friends have complimented this quiche more than any other one I have made, so I keep returning to this recipe.

I felt that this needed to be cooked just a bit longer.  It was still somewhat loose on the inside after following the cooking time recommended.  But other than that this this was delicious!

Seriously delicious and easy.  I followed the directions except I used a four cheese blend instead of the Romano because that is what I had.  The recipe cooked in the exact amount of time and it looked and tasted amazing.

Great recipe!!  Came out perfect.  I would also recommend the deep dish as it was way too much cream/egg combo.  I also added the garlic to the leek!

Great quiche!! I replaced leek with broccoli and it was excellet. I didn't use as much swiss as it calls for but still came out very tasty!!
