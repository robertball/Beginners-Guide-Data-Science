I never prepared salmon before but have had it dry , tasteless, overdone. This recipe is fantastic and foolproof. Impossible to get wrong. I would agree with the person who doubled up on the dill. As well I increased the amount of chicken stock since I found the original amount to make the sauce too thick. I've also sliced a salmon fillet into steaks, placed in a dish , poured the sauce over and baked in the oven at 350 for 20 min. Either way it is the most fabulous way I've ever had salmon, the sauce is divine and the salmon tender and succulent!!!!!!!!!!

This was really great, restaurant quality even. I loved the simplicity of the dish, and the fact that the sauce didn't overwhelm the fish. I did add fresh lemon to the finished product, bringing all the flavors together, in my opinion. Served with dill mashed potatos which my husband suggested. I wouldn't have thought of it, but it actually went very well.
I highly recommend this!

AWESOME!!!  I love this recipe and so does my husband (who is not a fish eater, but he's asked me to cook this several times for him).  This recipe is now in my cook book and I make it at least once a month!

the sauce was great but i changed the cooking of it (a 2lb slab of salmon in a greased glass casserole dish smothered with the sauce baked at 350 for 35 min) It was awesome the best fish ive ever had

I loved this.  Smelled great cooking too.  Nice dill flavor (although I doubled it) w/o overpowering the fish at all.  Will make again.

Yummy.  I couldn't find any salmon steaks, so I chanced using fillets instead.  Still great results!  The sauce is nice and went well with some jasmine rice.

My husband definitely gave this recipe a 5 star. (I don't like salmon)  Used regular onions as I didn't have green onions.  No fresh dill so I used 1 tablespoon of the dry dill.  Had plenty of sauce so served salmon and sauce over rice.  He loved it.  He brought leftovers for lunch and everyone in break room was asking him what he was eating as it smelled wonderful.  He loved it!!!

I cut back on the dill....I'm a "taste while I cook" person, anyway. I also threw in some scallops and perch because I was low on salmon. Milk works just as well, also. We really liked this recipe and it's good with angel hair pasta. If you think there's too much dill, just do what I do...."taste and test" as you go along. I like any kind of recipe which you can play around with...and this was one. Good with other kinds of fish, like I said. Thanks for sharing! ps...I added a little more wine....of course, I was definitely "tasting" as I cooked, LOL :)

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe. To me the sauce was overpowered by the dill and didn't enhance the flavor of the fish very well. I found the taste improved with sauteed garlic, fresh ground pepper and rosemary. Although I found that out by accident as I made garlic rosemary potatoes and when I mixed the two while eating I found I enjoyed it much more.

I tasted too much of the soup and chicken broth that it truly took away from the Salmon. I don't think I would make this again. Maybe make the sauce on Chicken.

My dad made this recipe for me several years ago, and I've always remembered it as one of the best dishes he's ever made.  Tonight was the first time I made it, and it's just as good as I remembered it.  Another plus is that my husband loved it too!  And he has previously proclaimed he wasn't a fan of dill!  Ha!  This dish is EASY peasy and IMPRESSIVE.  Both delicious and beautiful.
