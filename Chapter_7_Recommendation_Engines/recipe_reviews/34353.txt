Quick & easy.  Easy to vary (must try herbed cream cheese, sliced turkey, red pepper strips & baby greens).  For lunch at home we also like these with sliced or shredded hard cheeses, nuked to melt the cheese.  If served cold, tortilla is optional b/c you can spread the cream cheese on the sliced meat (pat dry with paper towel first) & roll up.  Both ways are good sliced into pinwheels for party food.

Great when wanting something differant from the traditional sandwich.  My 2 & 5 year old really enjoy these too.

Nothing I feel that I have to make again.  I wish I'd added more flavor (garlic salt or seasoned salt or some kind of salt!) when preparing because this wrap didn't have much flavor.
