We made this punch for a babyshower (they were having a girl, so it was perfect) We couldn't find cranberry gingerale so we used half raspberry ginger ale and half regular gingerale and a big thing of raspberry sherbet.  It was good and people drank alot of it (we ended up making a double batch and it served about 25...but it was warm and humid outside)  For a bit of flair we froze baby teethers and floated them in the punch.  It was a hit!

This was so funny!  The store had no raspberry only sherbert, so I bought an orange/raspberry/blackberry sherbert mix.  And crazy enough, they had no flavored ginger ale, so I bought cherry 7-up and cranberry sparkling wine.  I mixed them all together and while really, this would be a whole new recipe, it was a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party!  It was gone before people even started to dish up their plates!

This punch is yummy.  I served it for my daughter's first birthday party, and it was a pretty pink for her princess party.  This punch is sweet, but I like it that way.  And very easy to make.

Delicous, easy punch. I couldn't find cranberry gingerale so I used a lg bottle of lite cranberry juice and 2 liters of regular gingerale with the rasberry sherbert. It was sweet but refreshing at a friends baby shower.

This punch was great!  I couldn't find cranberry ginger ale, so I used pomegranate 7-up and raspberry sherbert.  I also made an ice ring from the 7-up.

Just what I was looking for!  I couldn't find any flavored gingerale (and I looked 3 places!) so I used 1/2 gingerale and 1/2 reduced calorie cranberry/raspberry juice.  Really tasty and pretty!

Was a big hit at my SIL baby shower, exactly what I was looking for!  Couldn't find any cranberry ginger ale, but 1/3 cranberry juice, 2/3 ginger ale worked great.

Like just about everyone else, I substituted cranberry juice (1/3 part) and ginger ale (2/3 part).

MY MAIN ADVICE: Make this about an hour before people will start drinking it. It takes awhile for the flavors to blend and taste really yummy.

I used this recipe, except my store didn't have cranberry ginger ale, so I used Diet Cranberry Sierra Mist and it tasted GREAT. I made this for my sister's baby shower(they're having a girl), and put a rubber duckie and a couple teethers in for added "umph." Everybody loved it! I just put the raspberry sherbet in first, and then poured the soda over it, so it wouldn't splash any.

I made this for my sister in law's baby shower.  I used Raspberry Ginger Ale and Edy's Rainbow Sherbet (berries and orange).  Everyone loved it.  Thankfully I had bought extra because it was gone really quickly and I had to make an extra batch.

Awesome!  Big hit at the shower I threw.  I could not find Cranberry sherbert, so had to use Raspberry, but it was still so good...

I couldn't find cranberry ginger ale either. I used 1/2 ginger ale and 1/2 ocean spray's Pomogranite/Cranberry juice. It was WONDERFUL! Perfect pink for a baby shower!

I love this punch. I've made it for 3 baby showers for girls. I use raspberry ginger ale, and add a bag of frozen raspberries on top. Very pink and pretty!

The only time I can find cranberry ginger ale is around the TG-Christmas holiday season.  Canada Dry makes a wonderful cranberry ginger ale.  So, if you want to make this punch with that, you have to get it this time of year, and save it until later!!

Great Punch.  I served it at my sons Dr. Seuss b-day party.  It made great Pink Ink Drink.  Like several other reviewers I could not find cranberry ginger ale.  I used Cranberry juice and regular ginger ale and it still tasted great.

I made this for a baby shower this past weekend and I got a lot of compliments.  My husband didn't care for it, but I think it was more because of the pink color.  Very easy and tasty!  Thank you.

My mom used to make a variation of this using Lime sherbet and regular ginger ale. It always went really fast and we looked forward to it on our birthdays.

I used a 2 liter of Schweppes regular ginger ale (sweeter than Canada Dry), approximately a pint of  raspberry sherbet and about 2 cups pineapple juice. It had a mauve color liquid with pink froth. I added a couple drops of red food color to the first batch to pink it up more, but it was fine either way. Everyone was getting seconds and thirds. I am so glad I decided on this recipe for the baby shower.
