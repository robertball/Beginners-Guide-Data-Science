Lovely flavors, the icing is especially good. I am not a fan of candied fruit so I used orange zest that had been microwaved with a tiny bit of confectioners sugar and orange juice (2 tsp zest, 1/2 tsp sugar 1 tsp juice). Many rave reviews from those served.

Unexpected company!  Dessert emergency!  Used frozen poundcake.  Had leftover candied fruit from Xmas.  No orange liqueur so used bourbon.  Was delightful, anyhow.  Wows all around and this one is a keeper.  Next time, I will do it with homemade poundcake, the right way....it can only get better!

After the time and cost, I was disappointed in this recipe.  The ricotta cheese was not smooth as I had hoped.  Too grainy for me.  The frosting did not set up to frost the cake after sitting in the refrigerator, and I had to add more powdered sugar to get the consistency right.  Won't make again.

I made this recipe for the second time tonight. The first time I couldn't find candied fruit (wrong time of year) so I used dried fruit that I had soaked in Triple Sec. YUM. Even people who didn't like coffee, liked the cake! This time I used the same dried fruit but soaked it in vanilla and water. For this second time I had to use imitation orange flavoring instead of Triple Sec since I was making it for a group of people who couldn't have alcohol in the cake mix. Rave reviews!
