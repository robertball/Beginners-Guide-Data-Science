This is a recipe my mother made back in the 70's.  A true classic.  You can either make it into one large ball and serve with crackers, or you can make them into smaller individual bite-size appetizers.  No crackers needed with the smaller ones!  I always use more horseradish than the recipe calls for but that is just what my family prefers!

This recipe is so quick and easy.  I usually use garlic powder instead of horseradish and add some chopped green onion.  Delicious!

So easy and so good!  We love the horseradish so I add a little more.  Best to make a few hours early or let sit overnight.

Simple and delicious. Great mix of flavors. I've used leftover corned beef and the canned.

This is pretty good.  I added some garlic powder and green onions after a taste test.

This one is great.  I also add a tsp of sweet red chili dipping sauce to spice it up.

My whole family loves this cheese ball. I got the recipe from my mom and she makes it with 1 8oz pkg of softened cream cheese, 4 oz cooked corned beef chopped up, 1 T prepared horseradish and 1 t garlic powder.  YUM!

This was good but it needed more horseradish. I added parsley but green onions would have been a nice addition.
