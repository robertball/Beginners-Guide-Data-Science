These were ok, but not my favorite. They sort of have a tough, spongy texture that I did not care much for. The kids enjoyed them w/ frosting on top. I actually got 3 out of this recipe, which was nice so all the kids could have one. Maybe if I wanted something quick and easy in a small batch for them , I would make these again. Thanks for sharing. :)

It was awesome but if you happen not to have any cupcake liners around then spray the tin with cooking spray and before you pour your batter put olive oil and spread it all over each mold

This is a great recipe.  When I make cupcakes for the family, I often use this recipe to make the "same" cupcakes for our gluten-free friend by just substituting a gluten free flour.  It makes it very east for her to be included without making her consume an entire 2 dozen cupcakes.

Flavor was fine, but recipe needs some sort of acid, vinegar, lemon juice, buttermilk, etc. to activate the baking powder. They didn't rise and were tough and chewy, not like cupcakes at all. Good thing it only makes 2, had a bite of one and threw both away. Change the recipe to include an acid to activate the baking powder and make them rise, that will help.

It was very spongy and wouldn't bake all the way through because there was too much butter. I was not very impressed, and, the makers should clarify that there is only two cupcakes being made instead of a whole batch.

It's either too egg-y or somethings wrong with the balance of baking powder and flour etc. These were basically rubber. I swear I could bounce my cupcake on the kitchen floor. They didn't taste terrible... but the texture :(

It was really buttery tasting, and had a odd texture.
