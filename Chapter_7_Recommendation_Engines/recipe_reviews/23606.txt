This casserole was quite easy to make and reminds me of an easier version of lasagna.  Next time I will leave out the cinnamon, as it seemed to distract from the flavor instead of adding to it.

Very good and easy!  I had planned to use ricotta cheese, but found I didn’t have ricotta or cottage cheese.  Since I did have a tub of soft cream cheese I used that - very good & rich.  I added a 8 oz box of sliced mushrooms. I had a 14+ oz can of tomato sauce with mushrooms, but added the whole can instead of saving half, so in the final step I added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes after draining off some of the liquid.  My husband took a bite and said that it was Very Good – even before I had a chance to ask if he liked it! !  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very little flavor. My husband was not impressed. We threw out the leftovers.

Not one of the best recipes that I have tried. It was good I thought but my family really did not appreciate it as well as other recipes that I have tried.

Really good!  It was just like lasagna without all of the fuss.  Uses ingredients we usually have on hand.  Will definately make again.

This was very good, although I deleted the mushrooms and would add another can of tomato sauce to the beef mixture next time.  I'll be making this again--my daughter, who doesn't like beef, gobbled it up!

I really botched up the directions; adding all the tomato sauce at once and stirring in the cottage cheese instead of putting on top. Guess what? It was still edible! Just some hardened noodles on top. I added cilantro and red pepper to this recipe.

I must say I was unsure of this recipe when I read it but Hey Mikey I really like it.  I probably used a bit more cinnamon than was called for & it gives it a very interesting flavor.  This is comfort food at its best.  Thank you for sharing.

Great dish...easy and kids love it! I used plain old tomato sauce and added my own mushrooms. I also added about 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce and extra cheese. Then sprinkled parmesan on top when done cooking. Such a versatile meal. Spice up any way you'd like. We served w/a salad and rolls. Yum!

This WAS tasty... a good one to for weeknight to have on hand. I added garlic to meat while cooking & will add more seasonings next time (prob a generalized salt seasoning or a Garlic Pepper rub). Added "Herbed Corn" (a MUST TRY RECIPIE on here) & green beans to the side. This casserole is perfect to make ahead & have in fridge for making dinner time easier later.

I didn't care for the cinnamon in this recipe. My gut told me to take it out and add garlic powder and Italian Seasoning, and I will next time. I also ended up using double the tomato sauce. I baked it covered with foil to keep it from drying out too much. This is actually a poor man's lasagna recipe, and one I will make again with my changes.

Very disappointing; found casserole very bland and tasteless, barely edible. If I do make again, I would use a flavored pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce to improve the taste.

This was a yummy alternative to mac'n'cheese.  It's amazing how much you can taste that little bit of cinnamon!  We left off the mushrooms (since we're allergic) and doubled the cheese.  It definately makes more than 5 servings (more like 8-10), but it's good as leftovers.  Not fancy enough for company, but great for a family with kids.

This was an excellent recipe. I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and used fresh chopped mushrooms. My family loved it.

Great option to change up pasta night. Very good.   Used spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes to add a nice sweetness.
