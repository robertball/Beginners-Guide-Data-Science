I tried this over the weekend. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and added a couple of drops of tabasco sause, otherwise made as directed. Very tasty. Next time, I'm going to double the onion. Bf thought it was very good. I didn't try to roll into a ball as it appeared to be a difficult task. Just put into a container and chilled before eating.

Love it.  So easy to make and super delicious.  I did not care for the flavor or the lemon juice in this,  so I don't add that anymore.  I like a lot of onion, so I grate about 1/2 medium onion into the mix with my zester.  YUM!  Delicous over crunchy garlic toasts...

This is the best, and so easy to make.  I ended up having to make two batches because my family ate it all before the guests arrived. It was a big hit at the party.  I'll be making this over and over again. Thanks for sharing. PS didn't change a thing, although, I might add a bit more onion the next batch.

Didn't deviate from the recipe, and we thoroughly enjoyed this.  Do allow it to sit in the fridge for a while for the flavors to meld.  Very nice!

I added less cream cheese ( 4oz.)  to 8oz. liver sausage.   Also some garlic powder (1/2 tsp.)  The rest was the same.

DHs mom makes a similar recipe that he always loved, he prefers this one! Says it's better than his moms! I followed the recipe exactly as written (I try to do that before tweaking most of the time) and it needs no changes for us!

yes This is how my mom made this and I have made it for years.  I use the spring onion, dice even the green stems in and add 1 T of dill pickle relish.  My kids love it  I also use a blender to mix it all together, refrigerate it and oh so good

This is really good. I think its the perfect amount of cream cheese to braunschweiger. Some of the brunschweiger spreads I've had are just a little too potent for me to enjoy but not this one! Everyone that tried it (that likes brunschweiger) really liked it too. Its a keeper!

Very easy and tasty.  I served them in little mini philo cups and sprinkled minced chives on them.  The only change up I did was to sub the lemon juice for hot sauce.  Thank you for this recipe.

Didnâ€™t use lemon juice and added roasted garlic powder. I also used 10 oz of braunschweiger. Everyone liked it even my husband who is a fussy eater.

Only had 4 oz of sausage but I kept the recipe the same amount for the other stuff. I used liquid aminos instead of Worcestershire. It was good.

Yummy!!! Obviously, you have to like Braunschweiger, but if you do, this recipe is for you. I made it as written except for adding more onion. Very good on crackers!

Okay. Too much cream cheese which somewhat overpowers the liver sausage. Will likely switch to another non-cream cheese liver pate recipe, or cut the cream cheese in half.
