DELICIOUS DUMPLINGS! I ADDED SOME PARSELY FOR COLOR.  I DON'T OWN A POTATO RICER SO I USED A FINE GRATER AND IT WORKED WELL.  TIP-DIP HANDS IN BOWL OF COLD WATER WHILE SHAPING THE DUMPLINGS AND THE DOUGH WON'T STICK TO HANDS. I WILL MAKE
AGAIN FOR SURE.

This recipe (as written) is DELICIOUS. Except I have to admit, I am a DUMPLING ADDICT. Therefore, I am continuously "on the hunt" for a perfect dumpling. To this end, I'd suggest adding more spice and herb to the basic recipe (my choices: dried garlic, parsley, basil, oregano and cayenne pepper). I've also been known to add shredded carrots, bell peppers (choose your color) and/or zucchini (green or yellow) to the "mix". My advice: cook (stew or boil) your chicken first (along with all of the requisite vegetables). Set it aside and THEN (given the broth it's generated), drop your dumplings. Serve topped with cheese (my preferences: parmesan, velveeta and/or swiss) and you've got a wonderfully "comfortable" mid-afternoon snack, sidedish or (dare I suggest?!) dinnertime main meal.

I learned this recipe from my Dad, who called it "glasen" and served it as a side dish with saurbraten and red cabbage.  Those who thought this was bland should recognize it's value as a side dish served with other german dishes to provide a wonderful combination of flavors.  And, yes it's also a quick next day breakfast dish sliced thin and fried in butter with onions, bacon bits, and mushrooms then covered in shredded cheese.

These are great tasting. I have been eating this exact recipe since I can remember.I add a piece of salt pork,and a piece of onion in the center of each dumpling before I cook them.. This will add good flavor.  The very best thing about eating these however. THE NEXT DAY. Sliced and fried with butter on top. Yum

We have this recipe in our family as well, only without the croutons.  We use ham drippings mixed with melted butter for the gravy.  The salty-ness with the mild flavor of the dumplings is wonderful.

This recipe brings back many memories!  My grandmother used to make these and in the water which she boiled them in, she used a salty and spicy hungarian sausage from a local meat market along with some diced onion.  Oh and the next day, it was first come first serve for the left overs!  She used to role them in corn flake crumbs and fry them.  Delicious!!!  thanks for posting this...I hadn't made them in years and have lost the recipe.  LOVE THIS WEBSITE!!!

I watched my grandmother and mother make kluski and drop dumplings for as long as I could cook and they were alive.  They never followed a recipe.  They 'felt' what was right and used what was at hand.  This recipe is as close as I've had as good as Babcja's!  She didn't use the croutons. The leftovers were scrambled with eggs and sprinkled with butter-browned breadcrumbs and crispy bacon bits for breakfast. Yum-yum for round two, too!

Boy! our grandmas must have known each other...we only got these when we had a pork AND veal roast(cooked together w/ onions & s&p-because that made the best ever gravy) and that gravy over dumplings was beyond wonderful.  Actually tho, I couldn't wait for the fried leftovers...pretty close to pierogis!!!

I cut back the flour to one cup, used 5 eggs and instead of croutons, used a half-cup of panko breadcrumbs. I also added a couple of tablespoons of fresh, chopped parsley. Reducing the flour made these more potato-ey and eliminated any heaviness.

Disappointed! Had leftover potatoes to use and stumbled upon this recipe my husbands granny used to make. The only change I made was to insert a crouton in the middle. Its very easy to make but found this stuff too eggy and not the right texture.

This is nice change of pace for serving potatoes! I used this recipe as a side dish with sauerbraten. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and 1 teaspoon of thyme to the recipe, along with the gravy from the sauerbraten.

I thought these were OK, but my husband who rarely says "don't make again," just didn't like them.  I think part of the problem was that he was comparing them to a family favorite made for years as a side to our sauerbraten meal.   We just call that recipe potato balls, and this really is a dumpling.  That being said, they were enjoyed more as leftovers browned in a skillet with some butter.

Thanks so much for this recipe. My Grandmother from Poland made this for us for years. She served them with stewed beef. I can't wait to make this as I have been looking for this recipe for 3 years. The best was to slice the leftovers and fry in butter. serve with fried egg, we loved this as kid.  will try the recipe and get back to you.

I haven't made them yet, but will in the future. They are close to what I have made for years when I make my potato dumplings simmered in kraut with chunks of smoked sausages. Only thing I do is add some small diced onion which I sautee in butter before adding. Never thought of slicing and frying!

I halved the recipe and used a fork to combine the ingredients and keep the mixture light.  The addition of a teaspoon of baking powder also helped.  These are wonderful in my oxtail soup!
