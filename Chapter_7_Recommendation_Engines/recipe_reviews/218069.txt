I've noticed that the reviewers who only give this a 4-star rating each left off one ingredient.  This is one of the few recipes i would never change - the salt is essential for flavor, and the sugar is essential for both flavor and crisping the edges.  Still, reviews aren't bad! Thanks, and also thanks for the pic - i don't have a camera.

Any time my husband ooohs and aaahs over my dinner, I HAVE to give the recipe a 5!  So there you are!  We really did enjoy this.  I did cut the recipe in half because there were just the two of us.  I made the rub exactly as stated in the recipe and put them and the olive oil on my bone-in pork chops about 8 hours before grilling them, and they were really good!  Thanks for the recipe, Stormy!

My husband and I both liked this pork and the spice combination.  I left out the salt and sugar but it was delicious without them.  I marinated them for about 3 hours.  Since our grill died, I sauteed the boneless pork loin chops for a couple of minutes on each side to brown and then put them in a baking dish with a little chicken broth and baked them at 350 for about 30 minutes.   I would make this again.  Thank you Stormy3600 for sharing the recipe.

These were the best pork chops I have EVER had!!! I followed it exactly as written and there are NO changes needed. I usually don't buy pork chops because I've never found a way to cook them that I love. I will start buying them now and often!!

I forgot to add the sugar to this but it turned out ok. It grilled pretty tender, and tasted good with the spices and olive oil.

What an awesome recipe.  Made this and the family was dissapointed that there was no extras. Made exactly as the recipe and it turned out great, in this case i believe sticking to the recipe is key.

I used boneless sirloin chops since I didn't have bone in chops. I followed the recipe as is but added several cloves of minced garlic to the herb mixture and a teaspoon of Sage and brushed the chops with balsamic vinegar as I grilled them. Very tasty and tender. My husband gave it a thumbs up!!!

Delicious as is (I used sea salt) and paired with couscous and grilled mushrooms, grape tomatoes, zucchini, orange bell pepper it made a colorful and well balanced summer meal!

I didnâ€™t have fennel and used fresh rosemary and a bit less olive oil and it was fantastic from the grill. My husband complemented me several times and told me at least four times that I can make it again.

Solo good. Rib chops are good any way buy this beats any other in a way I did not expect. Served it so someone who swore they hated fennel and they couldn't get enough. I used brown sugar, that is the only thing I veered from the recipe with.

New family favorite! I don't marinate, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. They come out absolutely perfect every time!!! At first I thought about adding garlic or onion powder,  but this recipe is so full of flavor,  it really does not need anything but a side dish to pair with! We've paired with garlic green beans, mashed potatoes, or fried zucchini.

"OMG" was the first words from my husbands mouth. These were fantastic. Came home at noon and got them ready. It was just long enough to get the flavor really into the chops. Can't wait to make these again.

5/29/18 - Made this again. Got the exact same response from my husband. Remains a winner in our house.

I used 4 tbsp of brown sugar instead of the white sugar, & added 1/2 tsp instant coffee grinds for a little more twang. We had fresh rosemary instead of  dried, & that made a huge difference too. The whole family was wowed & my wife wants me to make this next time we have back yard dinner party.

This is an excellent recipe. The only thing that keeps me from giving it the full 5 stars is that I don't like the crumbled bay leaf. It never ends up completely edible.

Both my husband and I have enjoyed this easy, delicious way to grill pork chops.  We made it many times exactly as written,  except left out the fennel because my husband doesn't care for it.  The flavors blended nicely (even without the fennel).  I'm going to try it tonight with pork tenderloin for the first time.  Hopefully, it will be just as tasty on the leaner pork. Thanks for the recipe!

bf and i agree that this does taste good.. but it really reminds us of breakfast sausage.. i'm a huge sausage fan (insert child-like jokes here) but i was hoping for something more.. a little heavy on the fennel for our tastes but i did adhere to the exact amounts of the poster in order to give a true review.. 5 star seasoning if this was for a sausage.. but this was closer to a 3.5 (bf said 4) for a pork chop.. this would have been better suited for a morning meal with a couple of eggs and some toast.. ty either way for something different

This was fantastic - some of the best chops I've ever grilled. Recipe is easy and pretty forgiving. I used boneless chops and it was fine. I also added a few more spices (some garlic powder, dried basil, dried oregano, parsley flakes) and only marinated for a couple of hours - again, results were delicious! I might back off just a tad on the salt next time, but this will now be my go-to chop recipe.

Absolutely fabulous! All of the spices blended beautifully and as the submitter pointed out, the salt content is just right. You're not getting very much per chop and it enhances the other seasonings. We have one fairly big boneless loin chop left and my guy mentioned that he thought it would be very good sliced, and served on a pita with tzatziki sauce. I agree with him! Thanks for an outstanding recipe. :o)

With all the great reviews, I thought I was in for a treat. Nope. I couldn't even finish my pork chop. It was mostly flavorless and the spices I could taste weren't enjoyable. I will say I left out the sage and the fennel seed, simply because I didn't have these ingredients on hand. Perhaps they would have changed the flavor for the better, but I won't be making this one again.

Very tasty! I did not have time to marinate it for the time specified in the recipe so the rub/olive oil was basically added and then it went into the oven. Still it came out very yummy.  My husband even thought it did not have sufficient salt/taste and that I could have increased the salt/spices (opposite of what I said in other reviews were people said it was too salty). I did not have the fennel seed or the dried sage unfortunately, but still it tasted great, as if I ordered from a restaurant!

I paired it with another recipe for Mediterranean Roasted Potatoes which was a great combo. Link to the Potato recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mediterranean-roast-vegetables/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=mediterranean%20potatoe&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page

My husband and I both LOVED this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I only marinaded for 3 hours due to time constraints. I broiled for 4-5 minutes on each side. I'm thinking about making it in mass quantities and giving it out as Christmas presents in jars.
