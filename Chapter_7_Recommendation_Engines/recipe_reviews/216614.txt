This turned out great - As good or better than something I might buy at the take-out counter at the mercado.  I'm calling it Venado Guisado (Deer Stew).  Served with green rice (made w/poblanos and cilantro), Mexican-seasoned beans and warm corn tortillas.  I used venison steaks and they couldn't have come out more tender or more flavorful.  Will be making this again.

Not a big deer fan but my husband is and we have a freezer full from this past season. I made this just like it said, it was to die for!! We did like a Mexican spread to go with it. Can't wait to make it again!

AMAZING more people need to try it it's definitely something I make to go with corn tortillas, something to make venison taste amazing, share with the family, it goes well with cilantro lime rice on the side. It's amazing and leftovers actually get eaten, more people need to try this recipe!

Just made this tonight and I learned a couple of things. Do not use thin strips of tenderized blackstrap in the pressure cooker, and having a stainless steel pot in my electric pressure cooker prevented me from having drippings after browning the meat. The flavor on this recipe was fantastic! I will have to try it again and either use non tenderized meat in larger chunks in the pressure cooker or make it on the stove top if using the tenderized strips. Also, my end product was too "liquidy" so I will add some thickener like flour or cornstarch at the end if too thin.

This didn't turn out exactly as I had envisioned but it was good. As a matter of fact, my deer hunting husband said this was excellent and one he'd like to use the deer meat for again. I read the reviews and thought I was going a more taco type meat but it was way too wet for this. It would be much better served over a bed of white rice. Husband agreed this would be perfect.

Newbie at cooking venison and was looking for recipes. Did this in a slow cooker. Appreciated the "warmer seasonings". We used peppers and onions from the garden and served over potatoes from same. I can imagine adding other ingredients next time. Awesome. I will use this again.

Very good. My husband and I aren't really fans of venison, but this was easy to make using the pressure cooker and very good! I served it over plain rice.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic! Followed recipe exactly and will be making a few adjustments to suit our tastes.  I used a bit over 2 lbs of steaks, probably closer to 3 lbs, so not blaming the recipe for the lack of seasoning when I made this. Next time, I'll be trying 2 tsp of Papa's seasoning to a 1/2 cup of flour to coat the meat. We felt there just wasn't enough flavor to the meat, although overall the dish had a unique flavor profile. The red chilis I used were not hot, so plan to add a pinch of red pepper flakes into the pot before sealing the lid next time. Aside from those 2 changes, will continue to make this as-is over & over!  We used the meat made tacos with a garlic cilantro lime rice and avocado/tomato/corn salad on the side. Really delicious!

I made this using the recipe for Papa's seasoning. My edits were to use beef broth rather than bouillon with water, and added some garlic powder. 

Next time I will probably up the level of seasonings. 

Hubby said best venison steak he's ever had. it really was tender and delicious.
