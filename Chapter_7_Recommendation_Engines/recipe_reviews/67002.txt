The "sweet" in the name intrigued me, never would have thought of sweet shrimp but these are really, really good.  Hint to other posters, when "sweet" in in the title name, expect sweet! Thanks for sharing.

This shrimp has become legendary around our neighborhood - I've made it for several parties, and my husband turned his work buddies onto it as well. It's absolutely excellent - only change was to cut down the amount of molasses.

DH gives this one 5 stars, I would give it 4 stars. It was good, very sweet. I think the flavor was good but it overpowered the shrimp flavor and I love the flavor of shrimp.

Oh, this is a wonderful recipe for shrimp!!!!  My kids just adored this stuff.  I followed the recipe with one exception as I did not have any ranch dressing (imagine a house with eight kids with NO ranch dressing-unheard of!!!) but the shrimp grilled in this sweet and spicy sauce were excellent anyway.

Make sure to use uncooked shrimp.  I used cooked because it was what I had, and they were very tough.  The recipe is very very very sweet...a little too sweet for my liking

When my hubby first picked out this recipe, I thought the flavor combinations were really strange and there was way too much sugar in it, but it was really good. Not too sweet! Definitely will make again!!

SO delicious!!  If the idea of sweet shrimp doesn't appeal to you, then don't make it.  I did cut back on the brown sugar and molasses by 1/4 cup each, and I found that the shrimp turned out with just the right sweetness for us.  Some of the sugars cooked into a blackened goodness on the outside of the shrimp, and I loved that.  My husband, who isn't a fan of sweet things like desserts, also really enjoyed this recipe.  I served the shrimp with orange-cashew rice and grilled asparagus and tomatoes.

My take on the reviews was that this was a recipe worth trying but probably too sweet so I made some big cuts on the sweetness and a couple of other minor tweaks. No brown sugar, 1/2 the honey. about 1/4 cup molasses. I used avocado oil as a healthier oil choice and Newman's Creamy Caesar dressing as it's what I had on hand. Huge hit with a picky foodie family! I grilled pineapple slices with balsamic vinegar drizzle to accompany it, steamed bok choy with Bragg's amino acids & garlic, fresh garden tomato salad and cauliflower rice. Will definitely make this again. Very glad I changed the marinade although honestly it's the ratios rather than volumes plus ingredient flavors in combo that matter. I kept more of the molasses for the unique flavor. I could see adding more chili powder or even a dash of sriracha and I am not a heat freak.

The taste is outstanding.  My daughter made these at a family get together and they were a big hit.

The sauce itself smelled amazing and I was very excited for the result. Unfortunately, I think 2 hours in a glaze containing lemon (which cooks the shrimp) was too long, by the time I pulled them out to begin skewering them, they already felt a bit rubbery and firm. After the grill, they were too hard to actually enjoy. I would try the recipe again, maybe leaving out the lemon juice until the very end, squeezing it directly onto the skewered shrimp after they are on the grill to see if that makes a difference.
