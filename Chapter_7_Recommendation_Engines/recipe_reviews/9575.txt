After reading the reviews I decided to make a few changes I melted the butter used 3 squares of semi-sweet choc. and completely omitted the milk making it more cookie-like & less cake-like. I also added some macadamia nuts. I will definitely do again following these alterations.

this is a cakey cookie (not a good or bad thing just depends on ur taste) and not awefully chocolatey so instead of adding the last quarter of a cup of flour i replaced it with unsweetened cocoa powder. being a chocolate freak i just had to add one last touch i drizzled half of the cookies in chocolate (not hard just melt the chocolate take a spoon and swing it slowly over the cookies) and i dipped the other half of my batch and with these final touches they turned out great!!

I read all the reviews before I made these and decided to make some changes. I removed a 1/4 of a cup of the flour and substitued it with cocoa. I also removed the milk and added an extra square of chocolate. They were very rich and chocolatey but more like a cakey brownie bite than a cookie. I also mixed M&M's into the batter to give them some color. They are good but not what I look for in a cookie.

My family and friends all thought these were amazing! I made them twice and both times I went easy on the milk used only 1 and 1/2 cups flour and added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to make them extra chocolately. I also put Christmas colored M&Ms in them to make them festive...:)

If you don't add the egg and roll them into small balls. They turn into no-bake brownies

Very cake-like and not nearly chocolaty enough. I used 2 ounces melted dark chocolate plus some cocoa powder and that's not enough. I'd play with the recipe to make it better. I like crunchy chocolaty cookies!

I did not care for this recipe. WAY too cakey. Not nearly enough chocolate. We put on some blackberries and strawberries on the second batch and I would give that 3 stars. I made them a TON better.

My Grandmother used to make cookies very like these - us kids called them chocolate rocks.:-D They were a big hit with my grandkids too. I did substitute one quarter cup cocoa for one quarter cup flour and I used brown sugar instead of white. thanks for this great recipe.

We used slightly more chocolate than the recipe called for but didn't make any other changes. The result was a great chocolate cookie that I've made several times now. Adding a little more melted chocolate seems to thin them out more and take away the "cake" feel some of the other reviewers mentioned. (Disclaimer: we also do not make the frosting- just enjoy the cookie by itself).

The cookies with the icing and nuts ( I used almonds) - 4 stars. The cookies by themselves... 3 stars... cakey and not all that exciting

I made these cookies in Haiti (where ingredients aren't easy to get) and they came out just fine. Thanks!
