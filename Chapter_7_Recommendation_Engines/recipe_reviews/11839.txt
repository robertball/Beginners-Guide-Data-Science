This is a really awesome sauce... and for those of you who don't know, Arrabbiata Sauce is SUPPOSED to be spicy... so make basic spaghetti sauce if you don't like spicy foods to spare this recipe the bad reviews. Anyway, this recipe was great with some extras thrown in like chopped spinach and kalamata olives... I'll definitely make this again!

Too chunky- I was looking for a smoother arrabbiata sauce. So after ingredients were combined, I put them in the blender to puree them into a smooth consistency. I then added a splash of milk to make it a bit more creamy,and simmered as directed. Without these modifications I would give this recipe 3-4 stars, but after making the creamy version, I definitely give it 5 stars! Spicy, creamy. and even better the next day! Thanks!

This is the first homemade sauce I've ever made - and man, did it turn out great!!! I made it for the first time a coupla weeks ago, and we have it at least once a week... We've tried plenty of vatiations, italian sausage, chunks of chicken, ham, etc. We've also spiced it up as well, with more red pepper flakes... A+ awesome recipe! thanks for sharing!!!

Sugar??  The way I learned how to make Arrabbiata down in southern Italy was sautee a 1/2 lb chopped bacon, 1/4 C olive oil, 1 small onion-chopped, 4 cloves of garlic minced [or more :-) ]; then add 4 T chopped black olives, 1 tsp capers, tsp each basil and Italian seasoning; 16 oz can tomatoe sauce, 1 large can of whole tomatoes chopped, and a few (to your taste) red chili peppers halved (the long, thin, dried kind).  Simmer for about an hour.

We have been looking for a good Italian restaurant since we moved, but none of them make Arrabiata like they do back home.

Now we know how to make it ourselves!

I added Proscuitti (a gourmet Italian meat), and salami when frying the onion and garlic.

It was gooooooood!

Easy and very spicy. I added a little heavy cream to tone it down a bit.

This sauce was amazing.  My boyfriend and I made this last night, and I still cannot get over how great it turned out. It was very quick, and very easy to make. I served it over whole grain penne and mushrooms, and I was very very pleased. Since we like things hot, I added a dash of cayenne pepper to the sauce and that made it super super spicy!  Next time I wont add the fresh parsley though! ^-^ Great for my first homemade sauce!

I thought this recipe was great.  I did a few things different.  Instead of using oil, i just used cooking spray.  I also added chopped red and green bell peppers to it.  Delicious!!

Wonderful recipe!  I was worried because some reviews said it was too hot, so I was careful with the spices, and it was great.  The wine you use can make a difference.

A great sauce with a spicy kick.  I loved it on penne pasta and the next day as a pizza sauce.

Very good sauce, also very spicy.  If you don't like your sauce hot, cut the red pepper flakes in half.

I have made this many times now and tweak it to our taste.  Instead of red pepper flakes, I use ground chili garlic paste (Tuong Ot Toi) found in the Asian food aisle.  I find it adds the lovely spice and a mellow heat rather than the sharp heat of the pepper flakes.  I've added all kinds of left over meats, olives, even finely diced veggies.  This sauce is exceptionally adaptable.  It's served at least twice a month at our house and more often if we are entertaining a crowd.  Tip - try it with Asiago cheese on top...to die for - trust me.  ;)

This dish is very, very yummy!  It had the right amount of spiciness (I don't like SUPER spicy dishes).  The fresh basil and parsley makes a HUGE difference (you MUST use fresh).  I subbed crushed tomatoes (in my opinion it just tastes better with crushed - or a mixture of crushed / petite diced).  Top servings of pasta with crumbled feta or goat cheese (yum!).  If you want, omit the red pepper flakes alltogether for a more basic marinara sauce.  The sauce pairs well with penne and warm bread (I like Pepperidge Farm's rosemary olive oil bread served with a little olive oil for dipping). Yummy!!!

It has potential to me but as others have said it was VERY spicy. My boyfriend couldn't eat it. Also I accidentally put in cinnamon instead of Italian Season. I would not suggest that.

amazing sauce with a definite bite to it!   i made this for my parents with garlic cheese bread and a salad for dinner one night and they loved it.  i gave my mom the recipe and she made it using a different wine and it didn't turn out nearly as well.  Make sure you use a nice italian wine for it.  I always use Chianti Ruffino, which is also great to have a glass of while cooking!

Spicy & delicious!  I love spicy foods, especially a good red sauce and this fit the bill.  Simple to make and it freezes very well.  I always use one 28 oz. can of chunky crushed tomatoes, because that's the consistency I like.  Some kosher salt and fresh parsley added, too.  A favorite of mine!

I made this sauce with tiny tube pasta, and it was a hit with my boyfriend who loves spicy foods. My family found it too spicy for their taste, but i think the sauce was delicious. we ate at an Italian restaurant last night, and the sauce we got with out bread tasted just like this sauce according to my bf. Will def use this recipe again, thank you

My wife and I are very impressed. We both like Arrabbiata sauce. This version seems to linger on your taste buds with a scrumptious sweet heat that totally delights the senses. In my next attempt at this recipe, I will add a bit more wine and tomato paste, and include a dash of salt. I believe this will improve it somewhat.

I probably did something wrong, because this didn't turn out at all like I expected.  It was really sweet, and even after cooking it for a while I could taste the wine.  I think next time I'll use chicken stock instead of the wine, and less sugar.

I like a couple of things about this sauce, it is healthy and tasty.  The red pepper makes a basic marinara sauce pop a bit and it is tasty over pasta and/or a broiled chicken breast.  For those of us who watch calorie/carb/protien and fat ratios this sauce is a great addition to our food arsenal.

I loved this sauce -- tastes like it was cooked all day long. Turns out fairly chunky. I did add a little salt and some more sugar (maybe 1 TB. more).  Delicious! I served it with stuffed cheese shells and it was a hit. Next time I might cut back on the red pepper if this were for guests, but for my husband and myself, it was perfect!

I love this recipe.  I too only use 1/2 the amount of crushed red pepper.  But I used cream instead of wine and I added chicken and green peppers to it and sauteed them with the onions and garlic.  The wife and kids just love it!  And so does my family and friends who have also had it.

This was a little spicier than I normally go for but it is easily fixed by reducing the amount of red pepper flakes.  Overall this is very easy to make and was a huge success

I found this recipe on this site a number of years ago and it is my favourite quick sauce recipe.  I also make it in big batches and can it.  It is awesome! I've added shrimp on occasion which makes a nice change.  I also use this sauce on my homemade pizza.

this sauce was delicious. i added more red pepper flakes for extra hot. i also added fresh parmesan in while the sauce was simmering instead of sprinkling it on later, just to thicken the sauce a bit. i also let it simmer for longer to really let the flavours mix. lovely! it is especially delicious over spaghetti squash.

This recipe is GREAT!  Everyone loved it and asked me to cook it again.  I added a can of sliced olives for more flavor.

Great flavor!  I add a pint of heavy cream to thicken up the sauce, softens the spice too.  Flaked Tuna filets works well in this for added protein.

I really loved this recipe !!  The only change I made was to add some freshly ground sea salt to it, I found it a bit flat without it. I found the red pepper proportion perfect, but I can imagine some might not want that much heat. I had it over some fini linguine...delicioso !!

This is a great sauce, and I think it is perfect as described.  Sometimes I like to add some slices of italian sausage links that I grill to the sauce for flavor and to give it some meatiness.

This was an awesome sauce!!!!! I added extra crushed red pepper and onions (because I love those two ingredients and I love heat) and added about a teaspoon and a half of salt. I had this in Italy and was searching for the right copy. This recipe was spot on!!!!

Really great sauce recipe--as written, it made enough sauce to cover a whole 16 oz. box of rigatoni. I used 1 teaspoon dried basil instead of fresh and crushed tomatoes instead of diced. Also, the first time I ever had arrabbiata, it was made with pancetta, which was phenomenal. I made a somewhat bastardized version using bacon--I cooked six pieces of bacon until crispy and then sautéed the garlic and onion in the bacon grease. After about 10 minutes of simmering the sauce, I crumbled the bacon back in. This added a great salty note to the dish.

We like spicy foods and this recipe is definitely SPICY!  If you cannot handle spice then do not make this!  This dish is so simple to make and offers up a lot of flavor.  No need to make any changes, it is great as is!

AMAZING sauce! I added an additional Tbsp of tomato paste and let it simmer for 25 minutes so it had time to thicken up, then served it w/penne and parm cheese. My guests raved. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  This recipe is so easy and the ingredient amounts are perfect.  The only thing I add more of is the wine (eyeball it)  because it really gives the sauce a different flavour.  I sometimes add spinach (frozen will do) and/or diced black olives near the end to vary the sauce.  Thanks for such a great and low fat recipe Ellen!

This is a great sauce as is, I didn't have lemon juice or parsley so I just made do with what I did have. It is inexpensive and really tasty. It is pretty spicy so if you are not that into the heat, maybe cut it down to 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I used this as the sauce for my seafood spaghetti and it was fantastic. I will be making this one again.

Very good sauce.  I did add some chopped sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms to add texture.  I also didn't have tomato paste but it was good on vermicelli pasta.

:-) It is great! I decided to double the amount of red pepper because we LOVE spicy food. haha That was a bit too spicy for me. My hubby thought it was great that way. Next time I will do 1 1/2 teaspoons. I think it will be a nice in between. OH I also put it in a food processor when it was done cooking to make it smooth. We prefer smooth sauces. It worked out wonderfully! I definitely recommend this recipe. I cannot wait to make it again. It is going to be a common dinner night in our house!

We loved this Arrabbiata Sauce, just the right amount of  kick, and very hearty. My boyfriend loves mushrooms, so of course I had to put some fresh chopped mushrooms in... They fit in well with the other ingredients, but I am sure that the sauce is just as good without mushrooms!

Think it needed less sugar, and more red pepper.  Too much sugar in my opinion.  Don't think I'd try to make it again even with adjustments.

I'm always on the lookout for lowfat recipes.  Bonus if it's spicy because I know my husband will eat it.  It was too spicy for me, but he liked it.  Next time there will be a compromise and I'm going to cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half.

I thought this sauce was fantastic.  I added a pound of seasoned, browned lean ground beef to make it a meat sauce as well as a diced green pepper.  I enjoy a nice, chunky sauce, so this fit the bill.  I served over whole wheat spaghetti with a cucumber-tomato salad and some red wine.  Super and healthy Italian meal. Thanks so much for the recipe

This was good.  I think it would be better with crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  I didn't have any fresh herbs, but it still tasted fine (just not quite as fresh/flavorful).  I used whole wheat penne and added black olives, green and red bell peppers, and mild italian sausage.  My husband loved this, and said it was similar to one of his favorites at a local restaurant.

This was okay.  My daughter thought it was too spicy, but she is young.  Did not knock my socks off. I think better use for this would be to scale to 1 cup-- Then, First butter some sourdough rolls an  broil until brown, top with this recipe, top with mozeralla cheese and broil again until cheese is melted.  Sorry know this is a whole new take, but asa a pasta topper it just is not worth the time. No one was impressed.

I worked at a Italian restaurant & this was one of my favorites. I was real shcoked on how perfect it tasted. I do not really like (chunky) red sauce, I like smooth red sauce, so I used crushed tomato sauce instead!!!Perfecto!!!!!!!

This recipe was good however we found it a bit on the spicy side, next time just a pinch of red pepper flakes, also I would do a slow cook in the crock pot to let all the flavors soak in. It was still a tasty recipe.

This is a great sauce -- I use just 1 can of diced tomatoes rather than 2. I also use the petit diced tomatoes rather than the regular kind, which is too chunky. I would also recommend blending some of the sauce in a blender so it's a bit thicker. It definitely packs a spicy kick.

this sauce is awesome!  i make it probably once a month for dinner and eat the left overs for a week for lunch.  The only change i make is i dont use wine (although id love to make it with the wine sometime)i just add a little more olive oil to make up for it.  I like it best over "short pasta" like penne, elbow, bowtie...and also over the wheat penne as well.  I think i will try what one reviewer said, and use left overs as a pizza sauce, that sounds REALLY good.

We have just finished eating this and I must say that it was a bit of a disappointment. With these ingredients I was expecting something at the same time fresh and spicy and a little out of the ordinary but it tasted just like a standard pasta sauce although this was a little more sour. It's good/okay but it's not brilliant in any way and I don't think that I will be making this again. It was fun to try though.

Delicious!  I diced the tomatoes smaller and used less onion, but added a "few" more shakes of red pepper.  Great for spicy food lovers!!

This is a simple and tasty sauce that benefits from the addition of the red wine.  I found it to be particularly good over whole wheat pasta - the slightly nutty flavour of the pasta complements the spiciness of the sauce quite nicely!

This was really good! I made mine really spicy by increasing the amount of red pepper.I tossed the sauce with mini penne pasta and it was a great meal. Easy too. A keeper!

I tried cream instead of wine and it was very good.  I also halved the amount of red pepper and it was still QUITE tangy.

Fabulous recipe!  This sauce is light and delicious.  I ended up doubling the sugar simply because I like a sweeter sauce.  I also added a a TBSP of olive oil.  My family enjoyed this recipe and I will make it often in the future.

This sauce is delicious.  I found it to be way too spicy though.  Next time I will cut the red pepper by half.  Otherwise, it was very easy to prepare and I recommend it.

Wonderful recipe. It's got a great kick.  So much better than just using a canned spagetti sauce. I used it along with the Braciola recipe submitted by Michele O.  Excellent!!!!!!

Delicious and easy to make.  I love hot spicy food and I know Arrabbiata is supposed to be hot, but my sauce was borderline volcanic, so the chillis I used must have been super hot? Next time I'll cut it to 1/2 tsp.  I took previous advice and used a good quality wine (a lovely Montepulciano). I also used Italian olive oil from Puglia and while I am loathe to add sugar to anything,  I did add it as the olive oil is strong and fragrant, but a tad on the bitter side.  I simmered it on super low for about an hour. All in all an excellent recipe.

I bought a bottle of Arrabbiata sauce from Whole Foods, and wanted to kick it up a notch.  I used the herbs and spices in this recipe and it turned out really well.  I used onion, garlic, basil, red pepper flakes, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, black pepper and fresh parsley. Based on the positive reviews, I will definitely be making my own Arrabbiata from now on.

Quick, easy and delicious! I'm not a fan of cooked tomato pieces, so used my stick blender to blend it smooth right in the saucepan. Then I added homemade meatballs and let the whole thing simmer for a while. Delicious! I've had spicier arrabiatta sauce before, but I think the meatballs mellowed it a bit. Very good, and so quick and easy. A keeper!

We really enjoyed this one.  It was just enough for the three of us.  And the nice thing about this recipe is, if you choose, you can add other ingredients and it doesn't take away from the original recipe.

We loved this.  I used beef broth instead of the red wine and used one can red pepper tomatoes and once can of spicy red pepper tomatoes.  I also added some green and red pepper and instead of tomato paste added some canned spaghetti meat flavored sauce.  I browned garlic and veggies in oil and then cooked in the crockpot.  Great!

1 can tomato paste, 3/4 cup red wine (pinot noir preferred)
Browned sausage in the pan with garlic and onion; I would use more heat but my husband is iffy with spice.  All in all a great Arrabbiata sauce!

Hubby enjoyed this more than me.  I added a little extra red pepper flakes because we like spicy foods but I think that was a mistake - it was overpowering to me.  Served over cheese tortellini.

This wasn't a very spice arrabiata - I added two diced jalapenos to increase the spice level. It was rather chunky as well, so I ended up putting the sauce in the food processer after finishing, which ruined the parsley addition, but maintained the flavor. The sauce also needs salt - I added about a teaspoon and a half or so. Easy to double and freeze extra for nights when a quick dinner is in order.

Very easy to make.  I am Italian and love Italian cooking however I would reduce the sugar just a bit.  Maybe 1 tsp. and then add more to taste.  Excellent recipe when you want home cooking but are short on time.

My first introduction to Arrabbiata sauce was Wegmans handing out free samples of a sauce made for them and sold in their refrigerator section.  It was surprisingly good for a supermarket sauce.  I started ordering it at Italian restaurants but those in my area leave something to be desired.  So I started looking to make my own.  I came across this recipe and it knocked my socks off.  Even better with spinach over cheese filled pastas.  I tone it down a bit for guests who don't care for spicy but they still love it.  Can't wait till I get back to Little Italy in NYC to see how their Arrabbiata stacks up.  This is so good it will be hard to beat except maybe if they start with fresh tomatoes from their own gardens. We've got some great farm stands out here in the country so I'll be giving them a try.  Can't get any fresher than that!  If the worst any of the other reviewers can say is that it's too spicy then don't bother reviewing it.  This is the way this sauce is supposed to be.  In fact, don't make this sauce in the first place if you don't like it hot.

Excellent sauce.  I made it as written and it was fantastic.  The next day I stirred in a little sour cream and discovered that it also works very well as a lightly-creamy sauce.  Make sure that you use penne or a similar noodle.  I was short on penne so I used what I had left and threw in some linguine to make up the difference.  Due to the chunkiness of the sauce, it doesn't cling very well therefore it is unsuitable for a long, thin noodle. I will probably use fusilli the next time I make this.

A simple, spicy, clean sauce. Penne is a good choice, with fresh parmesan cheese. I know this will be requested again.

Excellent. I love it! It's not too spicy and the fresh herbs really make the difference. I have tried several recipes for arrabiata sauce and the others all left something lacking. This one is perfect because you can still taste everything else! I loved it and so did my husband. One small tip: to prevent heartburn add extra sugar!

Wonderful over fresh pasta! I often use 1 can rotel tomatoes in place of one of the cans of diced tomatoes, and cut down on the amount of red pepper flakes. I also add sliced mushrooms and cooked lean ground beef/turkey to make a heartier sauce for my hungry husband.

I made a double batch for a group of firefighters who are watching their weight and they loved it!  I did add four chicken breasts, cut into small chunks.  I simply plopped them into the sauce and let them cook in the sauce.  (I added extra water and let it simmer for an hour.)

This turned out really well.  I did add extra spice and a hot pepper because we like our food hot.  I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

Very good, quick and easy.  One of the first sauces I have made that didn't come out too watery.  The only things I would change are to add less red pepper flakes (I like spicy but I thought it masked the other good flavors in the sauce), and I would use maybe half the sugar.  It was a little too sweet.  But otherwise, a great sauce.

I loved this sauce!  I added red bell pepper, extra garlic, extra italian seasoning, and extra basil.  It turned out fantastic! I also used whole wheat penne pasta.  Yum will make again for my sister who is a vegetarian.  Thanks so much!

My husband will give this 5 stars he loves it so much.  I serve it over pasta and or even green beans sometime.  It is a little spicy for me which is why only the 4 stars but still it is very good.

Quick and easy and very very tasty. I chopped a handful of baby carrots and added them with the onions and garlic, I can't drink wine (allergic), so I used beef stock instead, and I left out the lemon juice (couldn't see why it was needed). I also used dried herbs instead of fresh. I just can't believe how great it tastes.

The right amount of kick for me. I like spicy food, and this was spicy. Just a warning to those who dont like spicy foods. Use less of the red pepper, or add it later to calm it down if you need to. Great sauce, this is a keeper.

I absolutely LoVeD this sauce with penne pasta!  Personally, I give it a 5, but my husband only rated it a 3 (something about heartburn, I think).  So my rating is an average of his opinion and mine.  Followed the directions to a T and it came out very well.  Was fairly simple and quick, too.  Great for a weeknight vegetarian meal.

excellent quick sauce the way it is, but for a
quick change that takes 5 min., add some heavy
cream and fontenelli cheese or parmesian.  Our
first helping was the original recipe and I quickly added the cream and cheese - 5 min. later we had our second helping with the change. Thank You.

I mostly followed the recipe as written, although as usual I didn't measure exact amounts, but rather went by "feel". Here are the major deviations:
1. I sautéed some sliced mushrooms along with the onions and garlic and included them in the sauce.
2. I didn't add any sugar.
3. I cut down a little on the pepper flakes because my wife prefers food a little less spicy.
Overall it was excellent! We used fresh basil and parsley from our garden, and served it over whole-wheat spaghetti with some sautéed chicken thighs.
I'll definitely make it again, but next time I'll use a better quality of diced tomato (my fault, not the recipe's).

One of my favorite sauces I have found. This has become my new "go to" sauce. It is spicy, as an Arrabbiata Sauce should be, so if this is a new venture for you I would half or even quarter the red pepper flakes.

This was really good and really spicy.  I took others' suggestions and added a bit of cream (half and half) at the end and a pound of sweet Italian sausage, browned and cut into coins. Served it over penne pasta.  We had plenty for dinner for the two of us and will be enjoying left-overs in our lunches this week.  I used basil, garlic, tomatoes onions and parsley from the garden. Thanks for a great recipe!

This sauce was good... However I feel like I must have missed something because the sauce was raved about in reviews and I found it to be just alright. It's a great base but it needs more. It was too thick so I added some pasta water and used my Emerson blender to make it less chunky. I've had arrabiata sauce all over Italy and so I was hoping this would be similar and it wasn't like any arrabiata sauce I had. Not to bash it because it was good just not amazing

I love this recipe! The substitutions I made were crushed tomatoes for diced tomatoes and I tripled the basil! I also am a fan of thin sauces, not chunky sauces, hence the substitution of crushed tomatoes. I also added diced pancetta and cooked this with the garlic and onions. Amazing!

Very good and simple.  I separated it into two pans before putting the red pepper flake in one for kids and one for adults.  Fresh red peppers would be wonderful.

I recently attended a training session at a Arizona resort where they had Tagliatelle Arrabiata on the menu. After having this delicious dish, I knew I needed to try and recreate it when I got home.

This recipe was a perfect base to start with.  Followed exactly; using a wonderful Pinot Noir as the wine.  To adapt it more closely to what I enjoyed in Arizona, I added capers, eliminated the fresh parsley but just prior to serving added fresh arugula and topped the dish with Grana.

The amount of heat was perfect, the whole family could enjoy the dish (but we typically enjoy a robust sauce).  We also used a wide flat egg noodle that wrapped up the sauce and arugula nicely.

I also recommend doubling the recipe.  This sauce is so good, you can use it the following day anywhere you would normally use a tomato sauce.  It only got better the second day!

As written, this was a very spicy sauce.  I added some water to cut the spice a bit and we thought it was perfect.  Delicious- thanks for sharing!

This is a great arriabiata recipe. The only things I would change are:
1/2 cup of finely chopped red onions (1 cup was too much. Put the onion in a food processor to get it finely chopped),
1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper (I was surprised but 1 teaspoon was too much, it was very spicy. I don't want hot, I prefer a medium amount of spiciness),
Add salt to taste. Forget the parsley...

I didn't much like this recipe.  It didn't have a strong fresh tomato flavor, I think lots of the ingredients masked the tomato for me.  I am sure for my liking it could be changed but then it wouldn't be this recipe.  I gave it 2 stars because it was ok.  I just wouldn't make it again.

I followed this exactly as written using merlot for the wine. I also added sliced cooked italian sausage at the end and let the sauce simmer for 30 min on low.I served it over penne pasta. Half of my family loved it and half did not. We did not think it was too spicy at all. I might make it again.

I've had really good arrabiata sauce before and this isn't really it. This definitely does not need all the sugar the recipe calls for. I think I would omit the sugar and replace it with a finely diced carrot. Add in a few ounces of prosciutto as well!

This sauce is absolutely delectable. The flavors meld wonderfully together, creating a rich, fresh sauce that you'll want to make every day! I came across this 5-star recipe when my cousin and I were searching for pasta sauces that were, quick, easy, and made with common ingredients. We found this one and decided to try it. I rate this sauce 5 stars for good reason. Do you not care for Italian foods? Don't be skeptical about this sauce- this masterpiece will make you a believer! If you still hesitate... My cousin and I have made it a TRADITION to make this sauce. Now I make it almost every week! Please try this amazing recipe. It's fast, easy, low-maintenance, made with ingredients you can find in the pantry, and completely delicious. I'd suggest even making a double batch- you'll want to have seconds! Thank you Ellen for giving my cousin and I a tasty new regular meal! We

I wanted to try this recipe after reading the positive reviews.  I was a little bit concerned that it would be too spicy for my family but seeing that others were able to modify the recipe and still have great results gave me hope!  I dd not have fresh basil or parsley so I used dry and guessed at how much I should use (1/2 tsp basil & I never used the parsley).  I used 1/2 the recommended measurements of black pepper & the red pepper flakes.  I also used crushed tomatoes because my kids don't like chunky sauce.  All I can say is that I will never buy pasta sauce in a jar again.  This sauce was so good and so simple to make.  Thank you!!!

This is a great sauce.   Yes, it is spicy, but that's how I like it.   I added some capers and olives and that made it more like a puttanesca - but, in my opinion, that is good thing.   It was like a puttanesca with more kick than is typical of that sauce.

We had an absolutely amazing meal yesterday. My partner thought the dish was definitely restaurant quality! I sauteed 1/4 lb diced pancetta with the onions and garlic, simmered the sauce for about 45 minutes before adding in 1 1/2 lbs of jumbo shrimp and let that simmer for an additional 25 minutes. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I cut the sugar down to 1 teaspoon and the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon. 1 teaspoon of sugar was more than enough for my taste and I may cut it down just a hair. I love spicy food but can't imagine how hot the dish would have been with 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes! Ouch! The dish was served over spaghetti and was just divine. We have at least 2 nights' worth of food so perhaps we'll have it with penne tonight. Can't wait!!

This is the sauce I have been looking for!  Delicious, spicy, and so simple to prepare.  Family prefers this to all the other sauces I have tried over the years.  The only substitution I make is using a tsp. of dried basil instead of fresh.

Good sauce! I followed the recipe more or less exactly. I'm not really a pasta man and just wanted to experiment with some leftover penne. I'll probably be making this in batches for pizza and other things!  I doubled the red pepper flakes near the end and I didn't find it even a little spicy.

There is truly something arresting about this sauce. I fell in love with it at first bite. It has a nice texture, spicy heat and great complexity of flavor. All the better that it's inexpensive and - best of all - ridiculously easy to make. I personally prefer to make Arrabbiata sauce by using fresh tomatoes, but this sauce, even made with canned tomatoes, still tastes divine.

Great recipe! Quick and easy to make! I added sausage to it for some meat, and mixed the penne noodles into the sauce. Then I placed it into a baking dish and topped it off with a mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 mins and it was absolutely fantastic! Obviously not the healthiest choice but very similar to a three cheese penne that you would get at Boston Pizza!

Yummy! I love a good Arrabbiata Sauce, and this one is perfect. I added even more red pepper, since this sauce is supposed to be really spicy. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I used a pretty good amount, so it was both sweet and spicy. Mm.

really good, just a little chunky for me. i think putting it in a food processor after it's done is a good idea and milk is also a good idea and next time i will definitely add proscuitto in while im sauteeing the onions and garlic. great though(:

This sauce is delicious ... .very spicy but that's the way we like it.  I added chopped poblano & bell peppers when cooking the onion.  I added the minced garlic for just a minute with the peppers & onions to avoid burning the garlic.  I drained the tomatoes before adding but saved the juice in case the sauce was too thick,  It wasn't.  Arrabbiata means "angry" in Italian.  This is a hot-tempered sauce but so tasty!

Not one of my favorite pasta sauces but did it for girlfriend - one of her favorites. Didn't change recipe and sauce/penne were great. Lowered dose of pepper flakes as neither of us are hot for spicy.

Without a doubt my all time favorite sauce. I make it regularly...exactly as written. I use wheat pasta with it and some kind of protein whether its chicken, sun dried tomato sausages or beef. A true fast food for the health conscious!!!

This sauce was a little too thick for me...but had a good spicy flavor.  I will probably look for a different recipe next time.

I found that the more wine I added the richer it asted.  I also added (for my dad) some hot italian sausage to the mix.  It made it heartier for him.  I find that you can add more sugar as well when you are adding more wine.  I had a few friends say the way I made it, that it was better than candy!

We ran it through the blender and added cream, now we make it once a week.  My fiance that doesn't like pasta sauce in general or if he does use pasta sauce he puts a little bit on - with this he pours it on thick and mixes the whole bowl through to get as much sauce exposure as possib.e.  It can get really spicy fast, so watch the red pepper.  This is a household favorite now.

I made this sauce on New Year's eve and reheated it on New Year's Day to serve to our relatives.  I tripled the recipe because we like a lot of sauce on our penne pasta.  It was just enough to serve 10.  I did not have the Italian Seasonings so I used an olive oil infused with garlic and basil to saute the onions and garlic.  Overall, a hit...but too spicy for my father-in-law.  But he thinks that ketchup is spicy!  A great quick homemade sauce.

This was pretty good. Not great, just good. I think it'd really benefit from some chopped olives, maybe a bit more basil.

This recipe was very sweet with the red wine and sugar. I used half the red pepper flakes and it was perfectly mild for my taste. I didn't care for this sauce but my folks raved about it.

This is my favorite sauce!  I think it tastes great on just about anything, especially thick cut penne pasta!  It might not be the “traditional” Arrabbiata sauce you might be looking for, but please give this one a chance, it is bold and flavorful!! It is a spicy sauce, that’s what I love about it, hits the spot when I get that spicy craving!! Fantastic! I do like the thought of adding cream, for a nice cream sauce, will have to try that next time!

Fantastic spicy sauce!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  I used additional tomato paste than what is specified, and no lemon juice.  Next time I may follow the exact recipe.

Wonderful, spicy sauce!  Will make again and again.  I added whipping cream and it became a delicious tomato cream sauce, but it is wonderful without the cream as well.

This was okay.  I did add marinated chicken, marinated artichokes & mushrooms--maybe it would've been better w/out those things?  I probably won't try this one again.

This is a great recipe, especially on those nights I don't know what to cook or don't have a lot of time.  I always make sure my pantry has the ingredients to make this.  The only minor change I make is that I used canned crushed tomatoes.

Very nice for the effort and time required.  Might try frying some sliced Italian sausage with the onions, if you want some meat/bulk in there.  Instead of Italian seasoning, I used some rosemary, oregano and extra basil.  I think this would only serve 3 or 4 people, not 6.

It was a little acidic.  I don't understand adding sugar AND lemon juice to it.  Next time I make it, I'll leave out the lemon juice.

With all that said, it was a VERY good sauce.  Very easy, too.

One of my favorite dishes!  I'm not sure its my fav because its so tasty or because its simply easy to make.  As a matter of fact I'm going to reprint my first copy because it is a mess from all the times I've refered to it.  Now that I look, I've had this recipe since 2001!  Talk about your keeper :)

This sauce turned out great.  I didn't have any pepper flakes, but it was still good.  I really like spicy food though, so next time I'll definitely add some.  I added fresh mozarella at the end so it would just start to melt, and it was gooood.  Thanks!

I LOVE this sauce! This was the first time for me to make pasta sauce, so I followed the directions really carefully.  The proportion of all the ingredients was perfect (I am always unsure about the quantity of garlic and onion to add) and the wine gave it such a nice blend! I added a little more crushed red pepper than the recipe called for (about 1.5 tablespoons) because my boyfriend and I like spicy sauce, and it worked out really really well! Excellent recipe!

This was a very delicious sauce and so easy to make. Just the right amount of heat too.  Will definitely make this again.  Very similiar to Olive Gardens.

Amazing.  That says it all.  I loved this recipe which with the Red wine, and the basil cannot be topped.  I used dark basil (which is purple) to add even more rich colour.  Not only does this recipe taste amazing, and is easily altered for spiceyness, but as well it looks great.  Good for any Arrabbiata lover, like me!!

This was a really good, quick sauce.  The only thing I changed was the amount of olive oil (I used a tablespoon), and I think next time I'll add a little more basil.

My husband and I loved this recipe--I highly recommend it for those who like a sauce with some kick to it! We'll definitely have it many times--but probably during the colder months rather than during the summer (it's too spicy for a summer meal).

I used fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of the canned and it turned out wonderfully.  A bit too spicy though, will cut back on the amount of red pepper flakes next time.

Great recipe.....have made it about half a dozen times.
I have modified it slightly over time.
The combination of the Crushed Red Pepper Flakes and Black Pepper a little too overwhelming so I go with just the Flakes.
Second if using lemon concentrate the 1 tablespoon of lemon juice is too strong...I reduced that to 1/4 teaspoon.
Lastly I like mine a little more smooth so a 50/50 mixture of Diced and Crushed peppers does the trick.

Very good. Very spicy. I'd probably half the red pepper flakes next time. I simmered for about an hour and that may have been too long. But hubby was late, so......

6.17.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11839/arrabbiata-sauce/... I made three sauces tonight - this, Christine L's Amatriciana, Chef John's Spicy Sausage Ragu.  All were good.  This was the most spicy comparatively, mildly hot.  E, 22, rated this second place, but thought it was too spicy.  I liked it, but it wasn't amazing.  I omitted the lemon juice & subbed sauce for the tomatoes.

Great recipe! My adjustments were minor. I substituted crushed tomatoes for the diced (preferred texture) and decided to add some browned sweet Italian sauage. I also felt the sauce needed to simmer for much longer to fully develop and meld flavors together.

Wonderful and flavorful! Can easily change it up by adding red pepper for heat or sumac and cumin for depth! Makes a great quantity as well. Use the extra sauce on fried potatoes or over meatballs for a sub!

It’s a nice and spicy sauce. It’s not “angry” (hot) enough for my taste though so I threw in a chilli padi (with holes poked on its body) into the sauce to make it more fiery. It worked!
However, I think this recipe can do away with lemon juice and sugar as both cancel out each other so I don’t find a point adding them in. 

PS For those whi want to try the chilli padi, please remember not to break the chilli while cooking and remover it once you done cooking. Breaking it and leaving it in will make to sauce too hot to eat.

I didn't have red wine so I substituted red wine vinegar.  I added a whole can of tomato paste which thickened it a bit more.  Otherwise it's quite runny.  Could add a second can of tomato paste even.  I started with half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and that was very spicy, could start with 1/4 tsp.   Also, for those of us in Canada on the metric system -- 3/8 cup (red wine) = 88 mL.

I made a few changes: doubled the garlic (always double the garlic!), added spinach, 1 x Classico spaghetti sauce instead of the other 14 oz tomatoes, added sun-dried tomatoes too.

Very good.  I pureed the tomatoes in the blender.  Added cooked shrimp at the last minute to heat up.  It was better than any restaurant meal I've ever had!!  Update:  next time I used Italian tomatoes pureed.

It turned out to be excellent. I made it extra spicy. Also, my tomatoes and other veggies stayed chunky (thanks to my cutting skills), hence I put it all in a blender to ran it for 30 seconds. Voila! The result was super. Must try it.

This was just ok.  It wasn't as rich as I like and was quite watery.   Overall flavor was ok.  I might try it again sometime with a few modifications.

Amazing sauce! Very close to the Arrabbiata sauce you get at Cosettas in downtown St Paul, which is what inspired me to look for this recipe. 

Followed directions mostly except  used 6 cloves garlic, Italian flat leaf parsley, and maybe about a cup and a half of wine. Let it simmer about 20 minutes then ran the immersion blender through it to make it "saucier"....Added my home made meatballs, let them simmer and get happy together for about 30 min and served it over bucatini pasta. Simply amazing!

I made this last night. I put everything in my crockpot and cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours then removed the lid and let it simmer another 2 hours. I doubled the recipe, used canned fire roasted tomatoes, and doubled the red pepper flakes. We like spice! All 4 of my teenagers inhaled it. This will be made often!!! Thank you for the recipe!

My new go-to red sauce. Instead of a tablespoon of sugar, I used a teaspoon. A pinch of salt helps as well! I've already recommended this recipe to many of my friends, it's that good.

Excellent recipe! I cooked this for my parents (non-vegans) and both enjoyed it very much. For my own I added a bit of cayenne pepper, but it was just right amount if you only wanted a little bit of the spicy flavor! I added some Kalamata olives I had on hand as well. I think it would also be good with some mushrooms. Will definitely be making again

I made this, it was nice enough. I wouldn't put in the sugar next time as it tasted too sweet - however, I didn't have any wine so that might be why the flavour didn't balance out. I ended up having to add some salt and extra lemon juice to balance out the flavour. Quite a good sauce!

Made this tonight and it exceeded my expectations! So simple yet full of flavor!
I added lean ground turkey, used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and a small can of  black olives and salt to taste. 
I love the flavour of fresh basil so instead I sprinkled over the sauce  in my bowl. Traditionally served with penne however I prefer Rigatoni..
Im definitely making this again next time with angel hair...Thank you for sharing

This was a hit with my family, who likes things on the spicy side. I'm not a very good cook, but this made me look good :) I didn't have red wine, so I used white with no problem (I actually think the sweetness of the wine was a nice touch). I've made it several times now and each time I used different tomatoes... petite diced, crushed, and one of each type. Just use what you like... diced if you like it chunky, crushed if you like it smooth, or mix them for fun.

The diced tomatoes didn't present well on the pasta, too chunky. Next itme I'll puree the tomatoes first.  Otherwise, tasted great!

This recipe is exactly like the one I learned to make in Italy, accept that I learned to make it with tomato juice, like hot and spicy V8 juice.  It is not as heavy as a traditional tomato sauce and lends well to adding prosciutto, shrimp or chicken to make it a bit more of a meal instead of a course.   If you want a nice change to traditional pasta sauces, try this one.  You can make it as spicy or bland as you want to suit your families tastes.   We like it better than the traditional sauces.  I prefer to make fresh pasta, but the "fresh" pasta works about as well.

First time I'd made my own sauce but always loved ordering penne arrabbiata at restaurants and now I've made my own. 
Have to say doesn't taste any different from when I've ordered out, very impressed with the recipe - thanks for adding to my Friday night :)

I just made this the other night and plan on making it several more times in the future. This particular sauce is supposed to be spicy. I lived in Italy for 3 years and tried this at several different restaurants. It actually translates to "angry pasta".

Great, easy and fast recipe.  I doubled the crushed pepper flakes and smashed the tomatoes.  I will repeat a previous reviewer's comment: THIS SAUCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SPICY!  If you like mild, this isn't for you--there are lots of other sauce recipes available.  I've had authentic Arrabbiata in Italy, and this comes darn close.  Will make it with fresh tomatoes later on in the summer.

This has become a family favourite and my sister says it's the best arrabbiata sauce she's ever had! We add chorizo or pancetta at the end to give it some more weight.  Absolutely delicious! Many thanks Ellen for your splendid recipe.

Beautiful simple sauce. Followed the recipe and served over whole wheat penne pasta with some shrimp lightly sauteed in garlic and olive oil.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I would make it again as written, but the wife says it's a little too hot, so next time I'll cut the crushed red pepper in half while cooking and shake a little on my plate when serving up the pasta.  We'll definitely be having this again!  Thanks, Ellen!

This recipe is absolutely delicious and my toddler loved it too!  I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced to make it more smooth.  YUM I am going to make this all the time!

I love spicy sauce...but I changed this recipe a lot!  I used white wine instead of red b/c thats what I had open...I omitted the sugar, increased the red pepper flakes, and instead of canned tomatoes I used about 20 fresh diced plum tomatoes.  The sauce came out very fresh...I tossed it with angel hair, sauteed shrimp, and shelled edamame beans...Everyone loved it!!!

I was looking for a recipe to use up the last of my red wine and boy am I glad that I found this recipe.  It was DELICIOUS.  I followed everything almost exactly as it's listed with a few exceptions:  1)  I didn't have any Italian seasoning on hand so I ended up throwing in a pinch each of dried oregano, thyme, and parsley, 2)  I cut up a couple of Italian sausages and cooked it along with the onion and garlic, 3) I ended up simmering the sauce for about 45 minutes instead of 15.  I think the longer a sauce sits, the better it tastes and it also thickened it up.  After 15 minutes, it was still just too thin for my liking.  I served it over some cmapanelle pasta and topped it off with fresh parmesan.  I can't wait to eat leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!

Very flavorful!  We added extra veggies too, because we like chunky sauce.  It's a little watery, we found, so definitely stick with Penne.  Good and spicy.  Added extra red pepper flakes.

This was a decent sauce but it didn't blow me away. It tasted like store bought spicy tomato sauce... or any regular tomato sauce with a lot of red pepper flakes added in.

Different.  Like a pasta sauce with a bit of an odd kick.  I have to say that I agree with a review that said anyone who thinks it's too spicy is a whimp. :-)  Just basically meaning that unless you really just hate any spiciness, don't be put off by that.  I originally made this cause I was looking for something quick and easy to dump on some meat torillini that I had, and this actually matched it well.  I used the rest the next night with plain pasta and did not like it as well.  Perhaps I just prefer it with meat?  I did google this and discover it's a sort of marinara with a kick, and I don't like marinara on plain pasta, so that probably explains it.  I could see using this with chicken or a dipping sauce or something.

This was an excellent and easy sauce to put together! The spice was a little hot for our taste, but diluting with about a half cup of crushed tomatoes (and a little extra red wine...) did the trick. Thanks for a great sauce recipe!

Spicy!  Great flavor overall - definitely goes well with a huge piece of toasted cheese bread.  Definitely is a thin sauce, but the big chunks of tomato balance it out perfectly.

I LOVED this sauce; my husband feels like it is good, but not great.  I made it as is the first time, and the second time, I started by frying about 10 pieces of bacon, removed bacon from pan and then used about 1 TBSP of the bacon grease to saute the onions and garlic.  Add bacon to the top of pasta at end.  DELICIOUS!  (also tried the goat cheese on top as recommended by someone else and I think that really finishes it nicely- adds some coolness to the spice)

What a terrific pasta sauce!  We added browned ground turkey for a little more substance, but it would have just as wonderful without.  Agree with the others, crushed tomatoes and fresh herbs are the way to go.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

This has become one of my old stand-bys.  I made this meal for my boyfriend and he was very impressed.  I think the wine adds a sophisticated flavor.  I was very pleased because the overall affect was a chunky sauce with a cohesive flavor- not just chunks of tomato with bits of other stuff mixed in.  Very yummy.

I am making this again for the 4th time tonight!  My family loves it!  The only thing I do is omit the hot pepper flakes--my 3 year old son is not a fan of spicy food.  But, I add them back onto my plate, and all is well!

Good, but tasted like it was missing something. Of course, the fact that I was trying to buy these ingredients in a country where I don't speak the language very well may have had some effect on that. Still a good sauce though, and I feel that if I had been able to be more sure of my purchase of the ingredients, it would have been even better.

Amazing. I have never really cooked before, and what a great place to start. This meal was done really quickly and tasted far better than i had imagined and as good as the best high street sauce. I cant reccomend this sauce enough.
I used 1 can of tomatoes rather than 2, the chili was enough in my opinion and I would use 1/2 a Tablespoon of sugar next time as it was too sweet for my liking (the way i made it).

This sauce did have a good spicy taste which is what I was looking for!  I have made it a few times and I like it better using crushed tomatoes instead of the diced tomatoes.  Also the longer it cooks the better it tastes!

Excellent sauce.  I make it every other week.  It is so easy and fun to tinker with the spices adding sugar or red pepper to sweeten or spice it up.

I liked it- my son didn't. Used 1/2 c. red wine, 1/4 t. pepper flakes, & 2 t. dried parsley. This is very healthy- try it!

This lit me on fire and I enjoyed every minute of it! WOW! Great recipe, beautiful ingrediants! The crushed red pepper spices it up and the amount of garlic is for those garlic lovers. I hope you're ready for this!

This is my new favourite sauce. It is sooo good. I puree my tomatoes for a smoother sauce and substituted cayenne pepper for red pepper flakes. Very tasty over penne and fresh veggies.

I loved it.  Simple to make and tasted great.  
It was a little too spicy for my guests but just right for me.  I will definitely make this again.

It was very good but, next time I would cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half. It was a little too hot for me. But overall it was excellent.

Like what everyone else said, definitely tone it down on the hot pepper, it is really a bit too spicy- everyone that had it thought so too.  Other than that, this sauce is pretty good... although next time I'll try fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones, just for healthiness sake.

This is delicious! The crushed red pepper flakes add a definate kick...you may want to tone it down a little if you're serving kids. This dish was a big hit at a recent party.
Can't wait to make it again...

By some of the past reviews, I thought this might be really spicy.  It wasn't.  It had the right amount of kick to it.  Those other people must be wimps.  We didn't care for the fresh parsley.

I do enjoy spicy foods, however the rest of my family did not care too much for the hotness of this sauce. I may make this again with less spice.

I've been looking for an Arrabiata recipe and this was a good one. Although personally, I would cut back on the red pepper flakes(almost by half).

This is a great spicy red sauce - although I added a bit more red pepper than the recipe called for... It was wonderful with grilled chicken and some steamed spinach.

Great sauce!! Although it's pretty much the same thing as another recipe I've made titled Best Marinara Sauce Yet.  There's only a couple indredients that are in this recipe that aren't in the Best Marinara Sauce Yet's one, and they both taste the same anyhow.  I don't mind though, I like the taste and flavor so I'm not complaining.  I did add a half cup of wine however and about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the sauce itself, and it's great!
