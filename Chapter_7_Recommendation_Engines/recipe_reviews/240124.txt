I had a couple slices of bacon that needed to be used up, so I cut them into small pieces, browned in a skillet, and added to the beans.  Unless you don't eat meat, consider adding the bacon, as it added another layer of flavor.  I knew for our tastes, 1 cup of brown sugar would make this way too sweet (personal taste preference), so I used 1/2 cup which was spot on.  I also used Spanish tomato sauce (has a kick to it) which not only elevated the flavor, but was a good counterbalance to the sweet brown sugar.  The recipe instructs you to drain only the kidney and lima beans, so that's what I did.  After an hour baking, the beans were still WAY too soupy.  I removed the foil, put the dish back into the oven, and cooked for another 20-25 minutes to reduce the liquid.  Iâ€™d suggest you drain all four cans of beans, reserving some of the liquid, add a reasonable amount back to the bean mixture, and then they should be good-to-go in an hour.  I served this as a side dish, not a one dish meal. We love beans, and really enjoyed this combination of beans; nice change from traditional baked beans.  Wmahailet, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this last month for a family gathering. It was too soupy so when I make it again tomorrow I will drain all the beans. Baking uncovered.

These were pretty good, just not a favorite.  I did enjoy all the different beans in this recipe and it is an easy recipe to put together.
