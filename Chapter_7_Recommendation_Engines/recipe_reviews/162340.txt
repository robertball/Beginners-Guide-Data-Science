A good granola which can be cut and cooled into bars.  I left out the butter and used just over 1 T. oil per cup of oats (1/2 when cooking oats, half when melting sugar and honey) to keep it healthier and less like a cookie.  I don't keep molasses on hand so I replaced it with extra honey - lighter flavor, put still good.  CAUTION: do NOT stop stirring oats!  The oats seemed a little soft after cooking 3-4 minutes, so T suggest cooking them an extra minute if you like a real crunchy granola versus a soft granola.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this granola and the cooking method.  You don't have to heat up the house to make granola in the summer.  I added 1/2 cup each oatbran, wheat bran, ground flax, chopped walnuts, chopped pecans, and sliced almonds with the oats when they were toasting to add more fiber and nutrition. I used half the butter and added a little water to thin the syrup before adding the oats.  I like how it makes clusters when removed from the pan after cooling.  One time I used maple syrup in place of the honey and both options tasted great.

This was my first attempt at making granola.  Very easy.  Very quick to make.  The only changes I made was to add a little vanilla at the end.  I used regular oats (not instant as I wasn't sure if that would work). I used some coconut and some chopped walnuts also. I wasn't very thrilled about how chewy this granola was.  I was expecting something crunchier.  It actually hurt my jaw to have it for breakfast.  However, the taste was terrific and if eaten as a snack was great.  I'm going to try my hand at some other granola recipes on this site but I will most likely make this one again as, like I said, the taste was terrific.

Great as is! I did change it up a little on the second batch (and there will be more batches!) Added 1/2 cup of coconut, 1 & 1/2 cup whole almonds and 1 cup of dried cranberries to the mix. Also added 1 tsp of almond flavoring to the sugar, molasses, honey and butter. YUMMY!!!

My family loved this! The flavor was great! I added a dried mixed berry and almonds, cashews, and peanuts. It didn't stick together great, so next time I think I'm going to lessen it to 3 cups of oats and keep the same amount of the syrup. Also I'm going to try cooking the syrup a little bit longer...I'll keep you posted. 6.17.09, 3 cups of oats and cooked the syrup longer....delicious! It is definitely sticking together better! Probably could do 4 cups and it still stick together.

This is delicious!  The versatility of this dish is as endless as the fruits or nuts you like!  I thought initially that it felt a little grainy to chew, but it only got better with age.  It takes away hunger issues quickly and in such a tasty way!  Thanks for posting this recipe, roweena.

My dad makes this ALL the time. it is his staple, and I agree, it is very good. We sometimes add maple syrup to it especially when we are low on brown sugar, and the flavor is amazing, very new england-y

wonderful and easy. fun for kids to help. so many different variations that you can use. for those that said to chewy .. you needed to toast it longer. every stove is different. I did mine slowly stirring constantly for almost ten minutes. you want a beautiful golden color like the picture. Make the perfect amount for several meals. Easy, fast, tastes great and good for you. My guys like it with milk and warm fresh from my pan lol once it cools and whatever is left I put in a tupperware canister and put it in the frig. I dont know how long it will last cause its go real fast in my house. I love mine with fresh peaches and some cream. or yogurt and dried fruit in the winter.

Good recipe - my boyfriend prefers it crunchier, so it's not his favorite recipe. Next time, I'd cook longer and possibly bake. It basically tastes like a chewy granola bar right now... sort of the wrong consistency if you were planning to eat with milk for breakfast... but good as a munchy/snack.

This recipe is super fast and yummy.  I decreased the oats to 3 1/2 c - then added 1 c dried cherries and 1 c walnuts (which I toasted with the oats and cinnamon) finished off with a splash of vanilla - placed in cute canning jars for hostess gifts - except I cant stay out of them!

Yummy.  Whole family loved it...even my husband who normally doesn't like "healthy" stuff.  I used raisins instead of almonds and cherries because that's what I had on hand.  We liked it the best when we ate it as a cereal with milk.

Tasted good, but it turned out like cereal. Didn't stick together. I even put half a batch into my dehydrator to see what would happen, and it crumbled into little flavored oats and fruit.

Mmmmmm this just finished cooling and my man is already enjoying a bowl with milk! This was my first attempt at granola and this recipe is a KEEPER! The only very small changes I made was to decrease the oats to 4.5 cups, and instead of dried fruit I doubled WHOLE almonds to 1 cup. Also, when I cooked the oats in the first step with the oil, I actually cooked them for 10 minutes because I wanted a really crunchy granola. So if anyone had an issue with it being too tender, just increase your time, because 10 minutes was perfect, and be sure to stir constantly while they cook. (this would be fantastic crunchy OR chewy!) After I put everything on the baking sheet to cool, I put in in my fridge for about 20 minutes, and it was perfectly cool and good to go! WOW! I'm happy I found this recipe, thanks roweena! I can't wait to try new additions to this very versatile recipe!

The first time I made this, I changed a LOT about it.  This time I stuck to the recipe except that I added an extra cup of oats, and I added in about 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to the butter/sugar mixture.  I omitted the olive oil in the beginning because I didn't have any and the oats toasted up just fine without it.  This granola is almost perfect. The only thing I wish is that it was a little crunchier but it's good just as is.

Great tasting granola!  I used peanut butter instead of brown sugar, so it wasn't too sweet, and had a peanut flavor!  Because of that, I left out the almonds.  This time, I used raisins instead of the cherries.  I love the idea of making it quickly on the stove rather than in the oven!  I will be making this and variations of it often!

This granola had a very good flavour, but was not quite crunchy enough for me. I ended up putting it in the oven to make it crispier.

This is the most delectable granola I have ever tasted!  I added cherry flavored cranberries, pecans, dried bananas, coconut and a tropical blend with mango, papaya and pineapple and omitted the almonds and raisins.  It's full of delicious goodness & I can hardly wait for breakfast tomorrow.  Thanks so much for such an awesome recipe!

I substituted coconut oil for the olive oil and 1/3cup of the butter. Love it!! And I doubled the dried cherries and almonds as we like a hearty granola. Very easy to make.

Delicious.  My college age son asks for a batch to take with him every time he goes back to school.  I prefer this method vs using the oven...especially in the summer.

Very good! I was out of cold breakfast cereal,so thought I'd check allrecipes & see if I could find something like granola cereal to skip running to the store.  I'm going to eat this with yogurt in the morning.  I used raisins, since that's what I had on hand.  Thanks for this recipe!

Oh man, this is good!  I haven't let it cool enough yet to see if it will be clumpy or sticky, but it is delicious!

This is really yummy! In fact, I can't seem to stop eating it. I love the honey in it. I used the orange blossom variety, and it's delicious. I also added walnuts and a few pine nuts. I've had it plain and with milk, which is great because I don't like regular oatmeal.

Thank you for this amazing recipe! It really is versatile as the description says! I made quite a few changes: 
I omitted the sugar & molasses, instead used 3/4c honey. 
I used 3T coconut oil (I also used coconut oil to toast oats, it gives it such a wonderful flavor!) and 3T butter instead of using all butter. 
I  used raisins & walnuts instead of cherries and almonds

I wasn’t sure how this would turn out, because it’s not oven baked, but this recipe is AWESOME!!!!!! Once it cools, you can’t even tell that it’s not baked! It is super easy and quick, and it is easily adaptable. I didn’t have any almonds, so I used walnuts instead and I also put chocolate drops on it while it was hot and they melted into it and made a very nice taste! It is also easy to double, as I often cook for 11 people, and have a hard time finding recipes that are easy to double. Overall awesome and easy recipe!!!!
Update: I make this often and serve it warm, and it’s really good! I also made a mistake and did 1 1/2 batch of the oat cinnamon mix, and only did 1 batch of the sugar, but it turned out good.

I had never made granola before.   I liked it and it's easy to make on the stove. I added toasted coconut that I toasted and pecans and golden raisins.

Now I am making another batch with the coconut, pecans, dried blueberries and dried cranberries.

I'm giving it away as Christmas gifts.

I love the stove top version the best! Great recipe that adapts well to many substitutions. We use coconut and sunflower seeds. I also sub some of the butter and all the oil with coconut oil! All the NOMS! Dried cranberries are the favorite addition along with pumpkin seeds and dates!

This was my first crack at making granola and it came out real good. I  added 1 tsp Nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon, which gave it a bit more flavor. I also substituted the butter with the same amount of coconut oil. This made it a lot lighter and healthier but it didn't stick together as well as with butter. Nonetheless these are my modifications and it sure is good and I will make it again. Thanks!

This recipe is so easy and tasty and versatile! I add about a half teaspoon of vanilla extract to the butter/honey/molasses mixture to soften the molasses flavor.  Any combination of dried fruit and nuts is delicious with this as the base, and I've also added seeds and chocolate chips.  The possibilities are endless!

This was my first time making granola and boy was I impressed with the results, very very yummy.  I used sliced almonds and I used dried cranberrys because that was what I had.  i'll never buy store bought again, my dad eats yogurt every morning w/ granola.  I can't wait until he tries it. It was very crunchy and chewy and clumped together wonderfully, just all over great!   I think I will try it with orange extract!  Thanks for the great recipe! Roweena  I am giving it away as gifts this Christmas along with some other homemade goodies.  Maybe I should add that I substituted coconut oil for the olive oil, and I didn't have molasses but used dark pancake syrup from Karo instead.  I also have been using Cinnamon Plus from Pampered Chef, a wonderful blend of spices for cookies, etc.   It all worked!

Super easy and great. I was a little nervous at first, but the recipe wasn't difficult. The only think I didn't like is that there weren't very many big pieces.

I got this recipe from a friend. I love it because it's easy, full of flavor, and I can change up what I add to it for variety (fruits, nuts, chocolate, etc). We love to have it for snacks or to substitute for cereal. I'll be making this for years to come.
