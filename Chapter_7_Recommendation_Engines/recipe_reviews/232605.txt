I had this recipe bookmarked for months and finally got around to making it tonight. Wow!  It was great!! I added sliced up chicken breast along with the shrimp. My husband and son inhaled it. It was so easy to throw together using the frozen stir fry veggies and canned pineapple. It's spicy and we like it that way. Served it with brown rice. This one will be on the menu on a regular basis.  Thanks for a yummy time saver.

Tastes delicious and is super easy to make!  I am a beginner cook so I was worried about making something so "fancy."  It took a little longer than 10 mins but I think that was only because I kept checking the recipe after every step.  I liked it and so did the people I take care of!!  :)

Excellent!  I doubled the sauce portion and instead of frozen veggies, I chopped up one green and one red pepper, mushrooms, an onion and threw in some water chestnuts.  Love the sauce; will make this again and again.

Even reducing the red pepper flakes to 1/4 of recipe amount it was too hot for my husband to eat.  The flavors were good.  I would try again omitting the red pepper flakes and offering them on the table.  Be careful!

Delicious! Quick, easy, and tasty.  We added a little sriracha to finish it off and make the 'dragon' breathe fire! This would also be good with scallops.

Yummy!  I made this with fresh red peppers and broccoli and minced ginger from a jar instead of fresh and it was delicious!  Has a good spice to it, too.  I had to cook the veggies and shrimp longer than the directions stated, but that was easy.

I made it just as listed and it turned out great!!! The guys at work loved it as well (I made it for a work potluck), next time I make it I’ll use more red pepper because I like spicy food but other than that no substitution is required.

I did not use pineapple juice. I substituted white wine. I did not use ginger (and my wife missed it. Next time I will use a little les crushed red pepper and will add the ginger.  Very good recipe. Thank you.

The sauce is pretty bland but the pineapple and shrimp combo is really good. Pretty easy to make!

Wonderful.  I made it without the  oil, cut the pineapple in half and the shrimp for a lower calorie dish.  It turned out wonderfully.

Excellent. My 9th month old was screaming at us to give him more. I put the red pepper flakes in at the end so his wasn't so hot.

Fantastic!  I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen...red bell pepper, celery, onion,broccoli and sliced water chestnuts.  I subbed chili paste for the red pepper flakes and powdered ginger instead of grated fresh ginger.  I served it with spaghetti ( lo mein) instead of rice.  This was better than any Chinese restaurant!

Delicious recipe. I only had a half pound of shrimp, so I put some steak strips in as well. In the future I think I would stick with shrimp or chicken to best compliment the pineapple and sauce, but I do plan on trying it again! I also used fresh vegetables since I had them, so it took a touch longer to make. I'm happy I found this yummy recipe to add to my repertoire.

I thought this was delicious! I used more red pepper flakes and more siracha as I like things very spicy!
