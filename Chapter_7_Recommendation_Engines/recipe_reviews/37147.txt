Taste a little bland, but extra garlic and added cheddar hints it up.  Great idea though.  Thanks

Cute Idea, but very dry... and most do not eat an entire baked potato skin worth or potato salad... but they are cute!

The potato salad filling is very tasty. But it was more work then it was worth to fill it in the shells -- a unique presentation, but they look like nice hot baked potatoes and it is an adjustment to realize it's served cold. After we ate the filling out of the shells, the shells are left over unless you try hard to scoop out the remainder as you eat the filling (I made the shell walls too thick, I guess). Don't forget to boil the eggs ahead of time.

It made more filling then would fit back in the potato shells. Don't use large potatoes or each serving is too big.   I used pressed garlic (garlic salt would have made it too salty).

I liked this, but my picky eaters did not. I will make it for me, and just give them a plain old potato..
