What, no garlic, no herbs, no spices, you say?  Yep, none of the above, and delicious all on its own, with just a little salt and pepper (and a mix of olive oil and bacon grease, not measured, just what I needed).  Tender skinned tiny new potatoes made this particulary pretty and tasty.

Great recipe! Reminded me of restaurant potatoes!  I used about half the oil since my pan was nonstick and it wasn't greasy at all. I don't like my potatoes quite so blackened so I cooked the potatoes in the microwave for about 6-7 minutes while I fried the onions and peppers.

This was a quick and easy recipe. It was very tasty, but I found it to be fairly oily, not that olive oil isn't good for one anyway. I might quibble with the sliced potatoes; they seemed too big; maybe half-moons or even cubed potatoes would be better.

I gave this recipe 5 stars and I'm not really sure what the problem was with the other reviews.  I have struggled to make a good diner style potato and pepper dish and this is it.  I used a well seasoned cast iron skillet and the potatoes came out perfectly.  The peppers are tender and the onions are golden.  It's fabulous.  Flavor is great and it reminds me of my father-in-law's potatoes. He worked as a cook and makes the BEST breakfasts. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was a really great dish! I added some turkey kielbasa to the mix to make it more of a main dish and the added flavor was wonderful. 

I cut down on the oil & did a mixture of rosemary, garlic, and hot pepper infused oils which I sauted the potatoes, onions & some fresh thyme in for about 10 mins. I then added a 1/2 c. of chicken stock & put the lid on to allow them to soften up.  In a grill pan I roasted the sliced peppers to give them a nice grilled flavor then added them to the potatoes & onions. I seasoned the dish with adobo, garlic salt, and white pepper to taste. On the grill pan I sauted turkey kielbasa and added it to the veggie mix once it was done. I let all of the ingredients cook for about 5-10 mins more to combine the flavors and it came out awesome! We will be having this again for sure.

One of my favorite mixtures, everyone seems to like it. Also put in green pepper in addition to red for color and roast in oven at 400 for about 35-40 min or till potatoes done and turning  the mixture once or twice. We like garlic so usually also add some fresh or powdered. This is also good with half white and half sweet potato.

The red peppers do add a full, juicy taste to the recipe, but achieving an attractive and delectable goldness in the potatoes requires a magnificent skillet.  We had it with a garden salad and French bread to some acclaim.

This is a good recipe.   Instread of frying I put the whole thing in the oven.   Next time I will remove the lid so it will brown up.

Growing up, this was a staple in our house, and still is today! Sometimes we add some crushed pepper flakes or mix in some hot banana peppers in w/ the red/green peppers for a bit of a kick. Simple and tasty~YUM! :)

Very good, though I used considerably less oil than was recommended; just enough to get the pan oiled up instead of a full third cup.  VERY tasty!

Fantastic basic fried potato recipe which reminds me of my childhood. I reduced the olive oil due to other people's reviews to 2 tablespoons.

Lots of fresh flavor.  Very easy.  I did use less oil and added one diced clove of garlic.  Then I baked it in the oven because I prefer potatoes baked.

Love this as a side dish with steak or beef tips. Substituting garlic infused oil for plain olive oil really boosts the flavor. I also prefer to substitute some of the sweet onion with shallots for a little complexity.

I made this for my family tonight with only one major change: one green pepper + one orange pepper.  I also used chopped red potatoes, and less olive oil than called for in the recipe.  This was easy, quick, flavorful, and got rave reviews from two of my daughters and my husband.  He couldn't stop complimenting the dish.  It was like having two sides in one paired with chunked chicken breasts with Italian style seasonings (a la a recipe idea my 8 year old had).  

They have already requested that this dish go into our regular rotation.

The recipe shown is very simple to make and quick, so it is good.
I do a few things differently.  I use frozen Oreida Potatoes that won't get mushy if you add them just before the onions and peppers are cooked so that they will be tender but firm. This works great and taste very good.
I use regular cooking oil to caramelized the onions with the peppers cooking them about 15 mins on a lower heat and not stirring them until translucent. 
Since I use this recipe to make Italian hotdogs, I add a tsp. of Intalian seasoning, salt and pepper to taste.
You don't have to use oilive oil to pan cook the vegetables, but you can finish the dish off with a little of the oil poured over it.

I cooked a pound of polish sausage in the pan first, removed the sausage, then cooked the potatoes, peppers and onion in the drippings.  Great dish and very easy!

Delicious. My mom used to cook sliced potatoes on the stovetop for us, and I wanted a similar recipe with less oil, more nutrition. The directions worked perfectly. Thanks so much for sharing, this will be a definite repeat recipe :)

In my house, we call this a peperonata. I used purple fingerling potatoes and multi-colored bell peppers. What a delicious, colorful, and healthy dish. I also added a healthy dose of cayenne peppers. Thank you for the recipe.

I have been making this for breakfast for over 20 years.  In the last few years I have learned some short cuts.  I saute a bag of frozen onion, green red & yellow peppers.  Then add a can of diced potatoes & a generous amount of black pepper.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes until potatoes start to brown.  Sometimes I add a bit of grated cheddar cheese or some sausages & serve with eggs for a very quick breakfast

Very simple dish and most definitely DOES NOT lack flavour. Highly recommended. A fantastic side dish.

Used 5 gold potatoes and 1 sweet potato and it was amazing! Used big cast iron skillet, put all the oil in, then added a little bit more every few minutes and story it in. Cooked over medium heat for a little longer (~20 minutes) and seasoned with salt, cracked black pepper, and a little bit of thyme. Next time want to try adding in some garlic. Quick and easy dish and it's real good

I love this! I make it all the time, and refer to it as potato and pepper g'mish. Of course sweet onion goes into everything, like a clump of chopped garlic, and I like this one spiced with sea salt and basil.

This is a super easy, family pleasing potato recipe. The first time I made it, my husband asked me to make too much next time so he could have leftovers for breakfast! These potatoes have gone well with ribs, chicken, and the next morning in breakfast burritos.

I made this as recipe suggested and like others wondered about only salt and pepper as spices. Yum yum yum!!! Doesn't need it. Dish sings as is with all flavours present and not masked by garlic etc. thank you for this awesome side dish.

I par boiled the potatoes. You can get away with using a ton less oil or fat. 1/3 cup of oil is excessive. Par boiling the potatoes also makes it easy to finish this dish on the fly.

Super easy, tasty too, doesn't need all the fluff of the other spices and herbs, just fine with salt and pepper.

This was very good.  My husband and I ate it all and could have eaten more.  This is a new take on an old recipe I've used for years.  I usually make this just with regular onions and pats of butter, but I enjoyed the  addition of red peppers, and I added green onions.  Since i had a non stick skillet, I used much less olive oil and no butter..

This is astonishingly delicious for so few ingredients, so little in the way of seasonings. I followed the recipe exactly. My hubby and two sons ate the entire pan and were disappointed that I hadn't made more. Thanks! :)

Perfect for me.  I work in E Europe, cook for myself.  This is simple, uses only ingredients I can get here, no exotic only in America spices, sauces or condiments, and a minimum of translation from English to metric measurements.  1/3 cup of oil = some oil. One onion = one onion.  And, it is tasty.  I added sausage to make it a main dish, sauteed the sausage and added it five minutes after I added the peppers and onion.

Awesome! Brought it to Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I made it a day ahead, put it in a casserole dish and heated it in the oven before serving. The only change I made was that I added rosemary.

This was not bad but also not memorable.  I added fresh rosemary from my garden to give it a little more flavor.
