YUM! I did use a bit more butter and a little bacon grease. These are really flavorful! I cooked them a little longer b/c we like them on the softer side. I actually forgot to use the parm. on top, but we really didn't miss it (I will use it next time though). This is a keeper...Thanks for sharing. :)

When I tasted this dish I quickly exclaimed, "slap my momma!" This was an easy, quick and very delicious dish. I will definitely be doing it again! I listened to the previous reviewers and decided not to drain the bacon grease at all (I used a very meaty bacon). What more can be said but thanks for sharing!

5 stars for flavor but 1 1/2 tsp of butter was def not enough. I ended up throwing in 2 Tbl more & my shallots & asparagus still wanted to stick & burn. I think I'll add a bit of Evoo next time. Thanks, Kathi!!

This was super yummy! I made a double batch because asparagus doesn't last long in our house and I'm glad that I did.  I also used an extra shallot and a few extra slices of bacon. I tried it as it was cooking and decided to add some season salt because the salt and pepper just didn't seem to be quite enough.  Overall, fantastic dish that I will be recreating in the near future.

I skipped the parmesan cheese, but added more butter.  Because, butter.

Delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. Only adjustment I made was use 5 Slices of Bacon, 1.5 Table Spoons of Margarine, drizzled just a tad of EVOO, and used Shaved Parmesan. Definitely doing this again soon!

Delicious!  As per some other reviews, I did add more bacon grease.  Also a can of mushrooms, a little more salt and pepper and some garlic powder.   Instead of a shallot (which I didn't have) I used a red onion. Very easy to make and I will do this again and again!

It's very quick and easy to make. This is my first recipe I cooked from this site. Asparagus was crunchy, bacon was soft, shallots were cooked just right. I had to cook asparagus for about 9 or 10 minutes instead of 5. I didn't have Parmesan cheese so I put a lot more pepper in. This is great to have as an appetizer or if you're starving and need to prepare something quick. I'm glad I have this in my 'back pocket' now.

Fabulous! I admit I made it without the butter, since I didn't have any on hand. So I fried up a little extra bacon instead. I'll definitely try this again with the butter, even though it was superb without.

I think I'd prefer sauteeing the asparagus over higher heat rather than steaming it with a lid on, but otherwise great flavour. I'll try sauteeing next time!

This was so good!  I too used the bacon grease instead of butter.  To cook the asparagus more even, I cut them in half and cooked the lower halves about 5 mins and then added the top halves.  I didn't have a shallot so I chopped up some green onions.  They worked well.  Made sure you use real shredded parm cheese, not the bottle kind.  It makes it even better.

My asparagus was on the thicker side, and by the time it was tender, the bacon was way overcooked. If I make it again, I will put the veggies in well before the bacon is crispy. I used regular onion, kept some of the bacon grease, and still had to add more butter than what the recipe called for because it was beginning to stick in my non-stick pan. And I used garlic salt instead of plain salt.

This is a pretty good recipe as it is. I heated some whole mustard seed in the bacon fat until it broke open then added a mix of roasted curry powder and crushed red pepper. Excellent!

Great recipe! Even my picky eaters liked it. Cooked the bacon crisp, then took out the cooked bacon and left the grease for flavor. Added asparagus and mushrooms and cooked as directed. Added bacon to the meat eaters portion. Definitely a keeper!

Really great, made as a side dish with steak tips and sweet potato casserole. Didn't have a shallot so used a small amount of yellow onion. Cooked bacon very crispy about an hour before preparing rest of dish, was great. Will add a little lemon juice next time
