Insanely delicious, made these for a party and they were a huge hit! I microwaved the bacon, chopped it and added it to the filling along with the sharp cheddar, same taste and saved a lot of work, especially considering that preparing all those jalapenos was pretty time consuming and tedious.The best part is that you can freeze them and you can already have them whenever you need them.

Oh, these are DELICIOUS! I've never heard of Baconnaise, so I did some research and decided to make my own after I found a easy recipe for it on the internet. (Not sure how it compares to the 'real thing', but it was super yummy). These were soooo easy to make and the flavors are wonderful (you can never go wrong w/ bacon and more bacon, lol)! The guys went crazy for them and are already asking when I'm gonna make more. A definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great recipe. I've never used the bacon mayo before and it definitely added to it. I added some more ingredients which is why I gave it 4 stars. I chopped up cilantro, tomatoes and I added shredded parmesan cheese. Gave it even more flavor and looks more festive too! I will make this again. 

NOTE: I've noticed on other jalape√±o recipes they never mention wearing gloves when seeding. I learned the hard way so I always wear gloves!

Quick, easy and not near as messy as I thought they would be.
