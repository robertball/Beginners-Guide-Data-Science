This was a great recipe and extremely easy.  I made it exactly per the recipe, other than using Tilapia filets, as that's what I had on hand. But that was the only change I made.  I only gave this four stars because it was a little too much parsley for me, and it seemed the other herbs didn't quite mix with the parsley.  I put the herbs in a covered container and shook it to get everything to mix, but the herbs stayed in the bottom of the container, and the parsley stayed on top. But the fish still had a great taste and was verty moist, and I would definitely make again, but try to figure out how to get the herbs blended better before putting on the fish.

I was looking for a quick, easy, low-carb recipe and this seemed to fit the bill.  Flavor was decent, but I think I would have enjoyed this better with fresh rather than dried herbs.  I may try this in future.

The only catfish available here is farm raised, which I don't care for, so I used sea perch.  I followed the rest of the recipe.  We enjoyed this and I imagine it would be even better with wild caught catfish.  Thanks, Jordan!

As a 20 year vegequarian, I miss my the juicy fat of roasted meat.  I had no idea baked catfish could fill that void! 

The herbs were awesome, and I used some fresh from the garden.

I made something similar. I used basil, garlic powder, a couple drops of lemon juice, salt, pepper, and coconut oil... It was amazing! haha I was apprehensive of the coconut oil but surprisingly it added a gentle sweetness to it.

The fish came out with a mild flavor. It's not bad. Nothing spectacular,  added a teaspoon of salt to the recipe and also mixed all the herbs into the butter mixture.

I really liked this dish. I used The Spice Hunter- Seafood Seasoning instead of the ingredients listed. I did use the butter with just a 1/4 teaspoon of lemon juice. The fillets  were perfect after 20 minutes.I ate this with corn grits with yellow bell pepper for my side. I will definitely try this dish again.

This was quite nice - surprisingly, I found the leftovers even better (I ate the 4 servings over three nights). I made it almost exactly as written, except for a little more catfish. My regular store was out of catfish, so I went to another store that had huge fillets about 14 ounces each. So I used two of those, cut in half. Also, my pantry had both dried thyme leaves and ground thyme - I figured the former was more appropriate for this recipe. It did take me quite a bit longer to cook the fish, though - maybe 30 minutes. A fairly simple dish, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

I ground the herbs together to mingle the flavors and instead of the dried basil, I had some left over basil pesto so rubbed that on the fish before adding the other herbs. A keeper recipe, thanks.

I used fresh spices from my garden and fresh garlic.  I mixed all spices together and microwaved to melt butter and soften the garlic.  I sliced fresh lemons and some sliced fresh jalapenos to place on the bottom of the olive oil greased pan and placed the catfish on top.  Wonderful flavor.

Yum yum! Fresh caught from a fishing trip. I added a little salt but I use unsalted butter so that may be why I felt the need to. I baked for  about 15 min Or a little less. It was PERFECT

I only had 2 average size fillets so instead of heating up the oven, I brushed the fish with the herb/butter mixture then sautéed them in in olive oil. They were delicious! I’ll definitely be making this again!

Yes I made it. I eliminated the oregano as I don't care for it.  I also reduced the amount of the parsley. Next time I will reduce the cook time as it was a little too dry.  I will make it again.

I definitely will make this again. The only change I made was to use garlic salt instead of garlic powder and I drizzled the fish VERY lightly with olive oil before baking because the herb mix seemed kind of dry. It had a great flavor and I'd love to try it with Tilapia!

Turns out that I don't like catfish. The herb mixture was ok though so I may try again with a different fish.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used a small amount of additional butter, half the lemon juice, added a dash of lemon pepper, and used fresh basil.  I mixed all together in melted butter, as suggested by earlier comments, spread it on the filets, then baked as directed.  Fish came out light, flaky and very tasty.  This is such an easy recipe.  I am certain I will be making it regularly!

I was trying to break this down for 1 fillet,  I added a little salt, because I used unsalted butter.  It was good.  I will make it again.

I tried this recipe because I'm looking for no-salt recipes. I substituted fresh parsley for the dried, but otherwise followed the original directions. I just didn't think it had much flavor.

Delicious!  I didn't even miss the salt.  Definitely a keeper.
