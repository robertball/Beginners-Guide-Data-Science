Yum!! My husband and I loved it.  We added a chopped red pepper to it to add color.  Some Old Bay seasoning added to it and it was perfect.

This did not turn out well at all.  I was hoping for an authentic New Orleans taste.  I think my problem was that I cooked the roux too long-3 mintues would have been better.  I may try this again.
