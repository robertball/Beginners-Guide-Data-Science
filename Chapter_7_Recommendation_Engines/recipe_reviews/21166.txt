I never rate or review anything so this must be a great recipe.  I've been canning pickles for over 30 years and wanted a new recipe, I tried this one and if you are a beginner or a pro and you want a great recipe then you should try this one!  I made 30 pints in July 2009 and gave them as gifts, as well as ate them, they were a hit.  They were too salty after much rinsing so I cut back the salt to about half after the first batch.  I started making double the recipe.  I mixed them in a large cooler to have enough room to blend everything real well.  I added 2 red and 2 orange peppers to the recipe to give it color and just chopped it instead of diced because the peppers are just as good to eat.  I put ice on the top while the mix stands so the cukes and peppers get crisp.  The cooler helps keep the ice from melting too fast.  I packed the pint jars with the cukes then ladled in the brine, this works fine.  I put them in a 10 minute 'bath' since I made so many and wanted them to last.  I opened the last jar a few weeks ago and it is just as fresh as when I made them last year.  I just finished making 45 pints today.  They're ready to eat right away.  Fantastic pickles!  Thank you, David.  Another pickle tidbit: when storing pickles, turn them upside down, so that the top pickles are soaking in the brine, since the pickles will rise.  Then as you eat them the bottom soaks.

The salt draws water from the veggies, thus they need to be drained.  By removing some of the liquid from them, they turn out crisper as pickles.  I do, however, like to mix a quart of cracked ice into the mixture, to keep it cold.  It melts, and everything is well drained at the end of 3 hours.  My family loves these!

The combination of spices make a great tasting pickle but when it says use a large bowl they should have said a tub...I used three large bowls and then poured it all into a tub to mix the cukes with the salt.  I also covered the salted cukes with ice and a loose cover (I think the ice gives the pickles a little more crispness)

Very good pickles. I would definitely rinse the cucumbers well after sitting in the salt, as they were awfully salty. I also processed them for 10 minutes in a hot water canner so I could keep them in the pantry.

My family loves these!  They are less sweet than grocery store b&b and crunchier.  My husband who is not usually a fan of b&b likes these almost as much as dills now.  :)  I made mine in lengthwise slices so that they could be used along with the onions and bell peppers as sandwich dressings.  Some things that I wanted to touch on that will clear up some of the confusion about the recipe, you MUST save the juices that come out of the cucumbers when soaking in salt and you cannot reduce the amount of salt because what you are doing is creating a balanced brine.  If the brine is not the correct volume of salt/sugar/vinegar and water they will not cure or be safe for canning.  The reason that some are finding the recipe too salty is that it is CRITICAL to use canning salt.  Canning salt has a different volume per measure than table salt or any other.  So you if you use the recommended measure in table salt instead, you are adding WAY more than you need.  I did hot water bath can my pickles, you can find the instructions for how long on pick your own.com  How long you do it for depends on your size jar and altitude.  Hope that helps someone!

Best ever even better than mine. Nice addition with the garlic and cloves. I think the recipe should read 25 pickling cukes. Some folks who never made pickles before used regular cukes which were to big and made them come out soggy. Thanks David for a great recipe!!!

I love these pickles!  I soaked my cukes for 7 hours in ice water before cutting them and mixing them with the salt, garlic, and bell pepper.  I didn't let them sit as long as suggested.  I only let them sit for 45 minutes, drained the liquid and mixed into the brine.  They still came out very well.  Very crisp, delicious pickles.  The best I've tasted.  Thanks for sharing!

These are pretty good.  One thing I would change is after draining the brine, rinse the vegetable mix and drain again.  It was a bit too salty. If I make them again I will definitely do this.

These were a great success! Loved them. I steralized my mason pint jars in a hot dishwasher first and they all sealed so they do not need to store in the fridge. Made 9 pints. I think I'll make another batch!!

I made these today for my mother-in-law. I don't really care for bread and butter pickles but after trying these I can say I would actually eat these ones. They stayed crisp even after boiling and processing. I had soaked them in ice water over night. I also didn't have any celery seed or enough mustard seed and they still turned out well. I had my neighbor try them since I wasn't sure what they should taste like and she said they were very good. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will definately make lots more of these.

This was my first time making pickles and they turned out pretty good. However, as a professional chef I did make some assumptions about the recipe here that a home cook may not have done. I used pickling cucumbers and sliced a bit thick as I prefer them this way. I also used pickling salt as table salt would just be much too much. I used the correct amount of tumeric but will half that next time as I found it to be too much, creating a muddled sort of appearance and taste. I also took a few liberties with the recipe and will take a few more next time around. I omitted the bell pepper altogether and added half of an anise star (I took it out before canning). I also added a 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper (I halved the recipe listed) to add a little zip and balance the sugar a bit. I let the cucumbers sit in the fridge with the salt for only an hour as I prefer a crunchier pickle. I drained them but it is not necessary to rinse if you use pickling salt. I made half the recipe listed, using pickling cucumbers and it made 4 pints with plenty of pickling liquid-I poured about a half down the drain as it wouldn't fit into my jars. Can't wait for my next batch of cucumbers to grow and give it another go!

This is a good pickle recipe. Pretty easy to make and in a few hours you are crunching warm pickles. It makes a ton though.

These have been loved by everyone who has tried them.  Bf loves them, and I gave a jar to a coworker for christmas.  She said that her son ate more than half the jar bc he enjoyed them so much.  Even bf and I, who aren't huge fans of onions, enjoyed the onions in here.  They are pretty easy--just several steps, so allow yourself time for those steps.  Follow the instructions exactly and you'll be fine.  Also, the final product makes great relish--just grab what you want from the jar, put it in the food processor until you get the consistency you want, and voila!  relish.  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

These were the best bread and butter pickles I've ever had. I actually added 2 red bell peppers for color. They are beautiful in the jars and taste even better!

Very tasty and easy. I added ice to top of the sliced  mixture. Added red and yellow pepper for color. I opted to finish with a ten minute hot water bath to completely seal. My whole family loves these!

I was spending almost 5 bucks a jar for the gormet brand at my local market. Not any more thank you this recipe. I ate them up so fast I had to buy more cucumbers.

Outstanding pickle recipe, crisp B&B plus added many cloves of garlic crushed as well a sliced jalepenos and red bell peppers.  Even my husband who likes all those extras, was not sure of them until we cracked the first jar and we eat half a pint.   He eats them on every sandwich he makes for his lunch.  Try them for sure if you like bread & butter.

This recipe is just unbelievable!  I shared this recipe with my coworker, and he is constantly making them with the pickles from his garden.  We both agree, this is the best B&B pickle recipe we have found.

Excellent B & B pickles.  Best recipe I've ever made and I've tried quite a few.  Normally, I would have let the pickles sit for a week or so before opening them, but my husband wanted to try them the next day and they were excellent!  Great flavor (very much like the store bought) and crunchy!  Just the recipe I've been looking for.  I cut the recipe in half (but used the full brine recipe) and packed them in quart jars.  I got three quarts out of halving the recipe. Also, I used sea salt and then rinsed them in a large colander.  Could not find celery seed, but the pickles still tasted wonderful.

Delicious! Make sure you rinse and drain the cucumbers. Just draining them does not remove enough salt. I think "25 cucumbers" is a little ambiguous since the size can vary so much, so I weighed mine and used about 7 lbs of cucumbers. I also used 4 cups of apple cider vinegar to change the vinegar to sugar ratio to more closely match other recipes I was looking at. They are plenty sweet with 4cups vinegar to 5 cups sugar. I skipped the bell peppers, but I think red ones would be nice. My 3 year old grandson thinks you are supposed to eat these by the bowlful.

I get RAVE reviews every time I make these pickles! One note...you are to combine the "juice" from the cuc mixture to the vinegar mixture...that wasn't clearly stated above....still yet a GREAT recipe! I make these every year about this time!  I also add about 3 or 4 jap peppers to give it a little zing!

WOW!!!  I've made this recipe now with both cucumbers and with squash/zucchini!  Took a jar to a retirement home where I teach a class and they disappeared in record time!  To make this recipe safe to store in the cupboard, I waterbathed for 10 minutes.  Have to make more this weekend because everyone wants a jar of their own!  Thanks, David!!!  6/30/08...have now made five batches of this with squash/zucchini...EVERYONE adores it...and I have lots of stocking stuffers in the pantry for Christmas!!!

These bread and butter pickles are outstanding!!
I halved the recipe and used only 2 cups of sugar instead of 2.5. Used ground cloves instead of whole and I also omitted the peppers. I'll definitely be making these again.

My first time making pickles and I tell you I was very happy with the results.  I did change up the recipe.  I added red bell pepper and only 3 cups of sugar.  Next time I will add banana peppers for color.  Use pickling cukes.  I put the brine mixture in 2 13x9 cake pans and added crushed ice to the top of the mixture.  Refrig.  After 4 hours drain mixture in colander to remove salt and juice.  Add cukes, peppers and onions to hot mixture.

Add me to the list of people who give this recipe 5 stars!  It came out wonderful, even though it was my first time making pickles.  I did use the suggestions of others to use ice to keep the cucumbers crisp and making more of the syrup to have plenty for all of the jars.  I tripled the recipe for the syrup, which was too much, but that's ok.  I refrigerated it and will use it today when I make my second batch.

Wonderful! Even had friends that "hate" bread and butter pickles sit down and eat a whole jar (she is preg). Everyone loved them. I followed the recipe as written, except I soaked the cucs in ice water for a few hours before the whole process.   I am making 3 more batches now!

I made these pickles and my husband can't get enough of them. I did follow other reviewers and cut the sugar to 3 cups, next time I will use 1 1/2 cups because this was a little to sweet for me.I'll also use a cheese cloth bag for the cloves, so they can be removed instead of keeping them in the jar. If you bite into them it will stop you in your tracks.Make sure they are rinsed very well or they will be salty. A great way to use up surplus cubes. Thanks for the recipe.

Made these again this year (2010) with the minor changes.Will make these all the time. Definitely 5 stars

I'm not sure what happened...apparently everyone else loves these, but I did not. I feel like the amount of tumeric is a misprint, because my pickle brine is orange.  Also, the pickles taste solely of cloves. I'm super sad that I wasted a bunch of home grown cucumber for this recipe.  I will never use it again. I wish I could find the recipe I used last summer...it was wonderful!

Phenominal!  Did almost a dozen quarts.  They were gone within a couple weeks!  I did the "old way" when it came to sealing my jars.  Did NOT do the hot water bath.

We LOVED these pickles. I used red bell pepper instead of green; I prefer the sweeter flavor, and it looks beautiful. I also left out the turmeric since I didn't have any on hand. I added sliced jalapeno to one batch, and they were a hit also.  I canned some and just left the others in the frig. Both were delicious. The first batch I sliced very thin with the food processor, but preferred the subsequent batches which I hand cut into thicker slices.  These are so easy to make, and so much more flavorful than store bought pickles. This was my first attempt at making pickles, and I will definitely do it again next year.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These came out really nice! I added the red peppers for color like suggested. I packed the jars with the veg first then added the liquid but I had to make more since there wasn't enough of the vinegar mix. I also did the water bath canning method (15 mins) just to be safe. I think I'll leave out the turmeric next time since it leaves a sediment at the bottom of the jars..not too pretty. I halved the recipe but made the full recipe of liquid and had to make more. After all of the adjustments I'll be sure to make these again.

These pickles have turned out to be a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that they are the best bread and butter pickle I have ever tasted, by far. The curse being that we made several batches and gave them as Christmas gifts. Everyone loves them! Now everyone wants more. Just joking about the curse but tickled that they were so well received. Used the recipe and made several batches with just pickles alone. Did'nt have a bowl big enough so used the cooler idea, cut down on the salt and let the batches soak overnight. After several batches I found that placing 4-5 trays of ice cubes on top of the soaking pickles and covering the trays with a old bath towel kept the ice solid and did'nt dilute the recipe. Make sure they are well rinsed, take the time it makes a difference. Also make sure you use a quality cooler. We will no longer add the tumeric as it leaves a odd settlement in the bottom of the jars and adds a funky color. Just a little advise after the water bath. When the jars have cooled to the point where they can be handled safely, unscrew the band and give everything a good rinse as the sugary mixture tends to glue the bands on once everything dries. Thanks for sharing David!

I have never canned anything in my life...and truth be known, I'm not very good in the kitchen, period, haha...but I wanted to surprise my wife.  I found this recipe for pickles and it sounded like something I might be able to tackle.  I gotta tell ya....it was EASY and the pickles are the best I've ever tasted!!  Since my first attempt I've made 4 more batches, gave some away as gifts and everyone who tries 'em loves 'em!  I just wanted to write this review to tell folks out there that if I can make these then...seriously, ANYONE can!  Give 'em a try!  It don't get any better than these!!

This was well worth all the canning!  I am giving some away this Memorial Day at our annual family picnic.
After soaking the cucumber mixture with salt for 3 hours, there will be a "water" that the cucumbers give off- that is what needs to be drained.

These are really good but I wish I rinsed the cucumbers of the salt like others suggested. It had a too salty after taste. Very good, but I will either cuz the amount of salt or I will make sure to rinse it next time!

Delicious and wonderfu!  I love that they are ready to eat immediately!  I didn't use green pepper, just the cucumbers and onions.  My parents came over and saw the jars on the counter (I processed them for canning) and my dad had to try them.  He couldn't stop eating them and scooped them into a bowl since he loved them so much!  Great recipe!

My Dad used to make awesome bread and butter pickles, using a recipe from an early 1960's "Better Homes and Gardens" cookbook.  I have looked online in vain for that recipe, but this one is very, very close.  I made 1/2 a batch, and I still wound up with 3 quarts and 6 pints of incredibly delicious pickles.  (They were big cucumbers)  There was one snag;  because I made 1/2 a batch, I used 1/2 the amounts called for in the pickling brine.  When I dumped my huge bowl of veggies into the pickling liquid, it was obvious I needed more liquid.  So, quick like a bunny, I removed the veggies and (inadequate) liquid from the burner, and whipped up a 1/4 recipe of more pickle liquid and added it to the already huge pot of veggies and liquid and continued with the recipe. Perfect amount.   I did process my pickles in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes, so I could enjoy them longer. They are The Bomb. So worth the time.

All I can say is everyone is right, these are awesome pickles. My husband said they are better than store bought. I did make a small change. The recipe called for 6 onions, I used four because 6 seemed like alot once I started to cut everything. Next time I make them I will use only 3 onions. I just want more pickels than onions even though it's all good. The recipe made 10 pints and I will be making more very soon, since we are going through them so fast!

This is what I used to make but lost the recipes.  I followed Vanessa's suggestions from July, 2010.
I used 3 cups sugar, I used ice, and I did not have celery seed,.  I used exactly 5 lbs. kriby cukes.
I put them in a boiling weater bath since I am the only one eatiing except for an gift or two.
I tried them warm also and they are perfect.  Just the taste I was looking. I have some juice left over I think I will re soak the ones I made last week.
These are really wonderful.
Thank you Dave

Lole, love, love these pickles. Id never made pickles before and these taste like ive been making them for years. As others, i did the syrup with 4 cups sugar instead of 5 and i added 1 tsp. Ginger. I put ice on the cukes while brining and only brined for about2 hrs. Rinsed cukes really, really good. And i also did the hot water bath for canning. These are fabulous!!!

I have made these pickles twice and they are absolutely delicious.  I follow the recipe as written.  It is a good idea to rinse the salt off the cucumbers before adding to the brine. I get 4 pint sized jars using around 9 cucumbers.  I cut the recipe in half for 9 cukes.  I also use pickling spice (just a few sprinkles to the brine).

This recipe is awesome!  Such a true old fashioned taste!  My friends went wild.  So did I!!  :)  I made a second batch with Zucchini and plain white vinegar, only cause that's all I had.. They turned out every bit as awesome as the first batch with cukes.

Wonderful!   Used the "sauce" for mixture of hot peppers I had and a few onions.  Best I've had!  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made these yesterday and I have a few comments. I noticed reading the reviews that everyone loves the pickles, me too. I see that some of you halfed the recipe and did just fine. The one thing that fooled me was the wide disparity in the amount of the yeild. David got 8 quarts. Other people had more or less. I used 8 cucumbers and got 6 pints. However I had to add another cup of viniger and one of water to the 2 cups I down sized from the 3 cups in the recipe.
Obviously, the size of the cukes makes a big difference. Mine were about 7-8 inches long and an average center slice 1 3/4" across. I have no idea how David got 8 quarts using only 3 cups of vinegar. From now on, I will be sure to have enough vinegar mixture boiling to cover everything. One last thing. I purchased a slicing mandoline from Walmart that made quick work of the slicing especially when I set the thing over the cooler and ice as other people suggested. Next I am going to try slicing the cukes lengthwise and make sandwich pickles. 
I am a just begining Chef, not a cook like my wife.
It seems that Chefs don't have to clean up. Big differene huh?

This is a great recipe.  It's easy and the pickles are delicious - - just the recipe I've been looking for.  I used half of the cukes, onion, and salt (but my cukes and onions were rather large) to a full batch of brine.  Instead of green pepper, I used four jalapenos that I sliced very thinly on a mandoline (seeds and all).  They added a nice zip.  Also, I used a whole head of garlic and sliced it, too, on the mandoline instead of chopping.  I did not put the jalapenos and garlic in the salt mixture.  Instead, I added them to the boiling brine when I added the cukes and onions.  This yielded 7 quart jars.  Will definitely make again!

These pickles are wonderful!  I don't have a bowl big enough for 25 cucumbers and the other veggies, so I put the slices in a cooler, salted them down and covered everything with crushed ice.  After the 3 hours, I rinsed everything very well.  I also did process the jars in a water bath for 10 minutes. The result was almost too pretty to eat, but the jars flew out of my kitchen and I'm booked for next year to make them again! Thank you, David!

1st time canner here.  Worked with my daughter and her cousin.  Had a great time.  Easy to follow directions.  We rinsed cucumbers after salt bath very well and doubled the brine.  OMG, even the ones I cut too thin were crispy!  We will definately be doing this again and using this recipe.

This recipe is delicious!! I put hot pickles into hot jars and put the lids on. Everything sealed but I'm still storing them in the fridge. Does any on know if this kind of processing will last long term if not refrigerated?

Fantastic!  I followed the suggestion to thoroughly rinse the salt off the veggies.  For flimsy pickles (the way I like them), go really thin... for crisp ones, go thick.
Made this with one MONSTER zucchini and one regular sized zucchini.  Lowered time to 2 hrs sitting since zukes aren't as dense as cukes.

Excellent recipe.  You may think there is not enough vinegar/sugar mixture for all those cuc's; but it is.  We hot bathed the sealed jars for 10 minutes so we could store in the pantry rather than storing them in the frig.  Taste is final criteria, and these taste great.

This is a #1 excellent pickle recipe. Would be good to use the same brine for beans, I think. Will be remaking every year. I only water bathed til the skins  turned a different green( no more than 5 min), otherwise, they turn too soft.

This recipe was so easy.  The reviews prior to starting were very helpful, especially in regard to rinsing the cukes and adding ice.  We tried the first pickles tonight and they were amazing!  They were crunchy, and extremely yum!  I highly recommend this recipe, even to the novice "pickler".

I must admit I thought I would go searching for another bread n butter recipe if this wasn't what I was looking for -- but you know what? THIS IS EXACTLY THE RECIPE I WAS LOOKING FOR! The cukes are still crisp, and oh my gosh, do they have a wonderful taste when chilled? I must recommend this. I used the raw/cold pack method once I brined my slices, and then simply put the boiling sauce over the pickles, and water-bathed them. These are sooooooo good! It is a def a recommend! :D

I was looking for a sandwich pickle, and this was it. I like a little more zing, so I minced in 3 serrano chiles.

Very very good! I marinated the cukes over night with the ice (like many others suggested) and rinsed salt off before adding them to the brine. I also added whole shallots and they turned out delicious! I will be enjoying these for months to come!

I made these pickles the other day and got 13 pints out of it. I plan on making more because after my family tasted them they completely wiped me out of all that I had canned. This time I am hiding them....LOL. Thanks, fantastic taste!

These were the best pickles I ever had. I made 24 jars and now am on my last jar because I keep giving them to friends requesting them, and it is still winter! I can't wait till it is warm enough again to grow more cucumbers, just so I can make these!!! I will make many more jars this time. There were just 2 differences from the recipe that I had to adjust. I only had regular cucumbers, but these worked alright. (I have already ordered seeds for pickling cucumbers next year!) I'm sure that pickling cucumbers would have been better, I will remedy that next year. The other difference was that I did a hot water bath because I wanted to make sure they were sealed and no bacteria would grow. They still tasted very good. Love this recipe, thanks a million for sharing!

Excellent!  I took the advice to quick rinse the brine off.  Also, it was easier for me to pack the cucumber mixture into jars, then add the hot vinegar mixture to the jars rather than adding the cucumbers to the vinegar.  I sealed and processed 10 min in a hot water bath (I hope that's long enough with the acidity).  To some jars, I added a couple jalepeno's for the hot-n-sweet take.  One batch of vinegar made about 4 quarts for me.

The perfect bread and butter pickle! If your family likes a little "kick", you may add a small amount of sliced, seeded, jalapeno pepper along with the green pepper.  I made a few jars that way for the "macho" men in my family but most of us like them just exactly as written.

There is a difference in pickles and cucumbers.  Pickles are now what we see in the produce department described as salad pickles.  These are what are used in commercial pickling.  They have a smaller seed and a light green tender skin. Over 3 to 4 inches would not be used.  Cucumbers are the ones we see in the grocery produce department and have a dark green smooth skin about 7 to 9 inches long.  Cucumbers have a larger seed and used for slicing such as in cucumbers and sour cream salad or cucumber sandwiches.I would not use cucumbers for pickling unless they were very immature and not over 5 inches long. Not found in grocery stores. This is confusing I know but take it from a old pickle picker the two can't be confused if seen side by side.  The two are as different as a watermelon and a squash.

This recipe is the best bread and butter pickles recipe i have made. As a food tech student i made this recipe for my testing and trailing for a project on preserves and these bread and butter pickles were by far the best preserve, so i choose to make it for my final preserve. I recommend that if you are deciding to make this recipe or not that you make it because you will be amazed!!!  I recommend that you use course salt instead of fine salt though.

Super easy and delicious! I took the advise of adding ice cubes to the vegetable salt mixture and they turned out great. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.

These pickles have the potential to be good, but they are too salty as the recipe is written.  I followed the other reviewers' advice and rinsed mine, but not enough.  Make sure you thoroughly rinse them after the salt stage and they should be good.

Did a batch last night. After heating to just below boiling I put the pickle and sugar brine into a pint jar and the microwaved it on high for one minute. Then the lid went on and the jar was placed upside down on a towel so the rubber compound got good and hot and sealed to perfection. Used 50/50 white brown vinigar, 1 tsp turmeric, and pickling spices already mixed from a store. Only celery seed was added. Everything was cut using food processor. The end product seems perfect. Avoided water bath, this time, as my mother always has, and they came out crisp like hers.

Try using half the cider vinegar in the recipe and replace it with regular white vinegar, if you like a slightly tarter pickle.  This is an awesome recipe and very easy to do.  Definitely a keeper.

These pickles were really good and had a good flavor. This was the first time I made pickles.  I cut this recipe down to 10 servings.  My pickles were not as crisp as I would like them, but I used the big cucumbers.  Next time, I think I'll use smaller cucumbers.  I will be using this recipe again.

I made some minor changes and put my jars in a "bain-marie" or covered water bath for 10 minutes in very hot water to process for non refrigeration.  The changes in the recipe were only 3 onions, not 6, no green peppers and 1/4 cup salt.  Wonderful and crisp!

I had never made pickles before so wasn't sure how these would turn out.  I was really surprised!  They didn't taste exactly like the ones that I am used to from the store, but they were close!  I added a little extra vinegar because I wasn't sure if the cukes were supposed to be covered with the liquid in the jar.  I guess as they cooled they sunk down a little...but still a little un sure about how they're supposed to be as far as that.  all in all a great recipe, and I will definitely be using it again!  Thank you!!

I read thru the reviews before I started and altered the recipe just a bit. This was my first attempt at making pickles and I must say " This recipe is SO EASY and DELICIOUS" I did rinse the veggies after sitting in the salt, and I did cut the sugar in half. The only other thing I did differently (only because I was out of whole cloves)is that I used allspice in place of the cloves. I have had rave reviews for these pickles, even from friends who claimed not to like pickles! Looking forward to growing twice as many cukes next year, just so I can make these.

This was my first time making these, and I couldn't have asked for better results.  I don't usually go for onion, but it works in this recipe.  I think the next batch I will skip the onion, make the peppers into slices, and either skip or cut down on the clove.  I also put the pickle/veg mixture into the jars before pouring the liquid over them.

I had never eaten bread and Butter Pickles before making these out of nessesity, as I had an over abundance of cucumbers I had grown.  I absolutely love them, and my stepdad and Son-in-Law are also putting in their orders for more, after very quickly consumied the last lot I'd given them. I am currently onto my third lot...love it highly recommended.

These pickles turned out well. My family wasn't too fond of the garlic in the pickle. I'll probably try this again without the garlic.

These turned out very good.  However, my batch was 7 pints and tripled the brine...too much - a double batch would have been just right.  Also, I rinsed VERY thoroughly and the cukes still tasted really salty, but don't worry, they won't when they are done.  Very time consuming to make, but worth it.

These are awesome pickles!  I made a bunch to give away to friends and everyone has asked for the recipe.  I cut the sugar to 4 cups and was still plenty sweet.  And do be sure to rinse them salt and drain.  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at pickles, and I am thrilled.  I used regular sized cukes from the local farmers market, so it made 25 pint jars!  I used red peppers because I prefer them.  I had to triple the brine to cover all the veggies.  I assume pickling cucumbers would yeild less, but I am happy with results.  Next time I think I'll add some banana peppers in the mix.  I also reduced the sugar by about a cup and the sweetness was perfect!

This was my first attempt at making B & B pickles and they turned out great!  I sliced up a hot pepper and added to each jar.  As suggested, I covered the cucumbers with ice.  I wanted to make enought pickles to last us quite a while, so I processed the jars in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.  Thanks, David, for the great recipe!

A great recipe! Reminded me of my late grandmother's pickles she canned every year. The only issue I had was a lot of liquid was left after canning, perhaps I could have used a few more cucumbers, I didn't really count but estimated.

Wonderful!!  I made these for my family and I halved the recipe, and it was perfect.  The green peppers are the best part!  The only thing I did differently was use zucchini instead of cucumber since I had a garden full of it.

Very good bread and butter pickles. Had to increase the vinegar, sugar, and spices by 50 percent to get enough liquid for safe canning.   My pickling cukes were larger than normal this year.

These are absolutely delish!  I am in the process of making my third batch in a week and have countless jars of these delicious pickles for Christmas gifts.  Highly recommend reading other comments that are so helpful-- I, too, doubled the vinegar solution, cut the sugar in half, added sliced red peppers and jalapenos.  Easy, beautiful, so tasty.  Enjoy!

Very easy and came out delicious.  The only change I made to the recipe was that I used red peppers instead of green for a more colorful look.  
On the technical side, I put the jars in a hot water bath for 12 minutes to seal the them so they would keep in the pantry. Overall they were a hit!

These pickles are AMAZING however on initial taste these pickles are too salty, but if you give them a hot water bath so that they are canned and can sit at least three weeks, (I KNOW it is hard to wait) they are WONDERFUL this is my first time to can pickles and my husband loves them.

These are really good and I can't keep my hands off of them!  I made half a batch (smaller volume much easier to handle), left out the garlic, and poured the boiling brine over the cucumber mixture (instead of visa versa).  Yummy!

I would love to try this recipe.  It looks great, but the ingredient list is too general on vegetable size for me to feel confident that I am using the right amounts.  The cucumbers I bring in from my garden seem to range from a couple of ounces to a couple of pounds, and onion size varies a lot, too.  It would be really helpful to give the total weights of veggies desired to help out.

These are very easy to make.  Do not skip the salt process, it helps keep the cucumbers crispy after adding the vinegar brine.

I have a picture, but this site is pickier than my current comp allows.  I will times-and-a-half the juice recipe next time, as I prefer more juice.  At any rate, this recipe is closer to the pickles I made with my grandmother as a child than any I've ever found!  My kitchen smells like home.  Can't wait to make again!  :)

Love bread & butter pickles - but what I had was an abundance of green tomatoes - mostly small, about 2-3 inch diameter & I wanted to make some bread & butter green tomato pickles. I followed this recipe, except for ...I sliced up 5 pints of tomatoes, 1 red pepper, 2 thick slices sweet onion, cut the salt to 1/8 cup, used a tray of large ices cubes while they sat for 3 hours; after heating back to a boil I used a slotted spoon to fill 7  - 1/2 pint (jelly size) jars, filled with brine, sealed and gave them a a 10 minute boil.  I think they are GREAT! and my first gifted jar got a good review, too!

I made these today and followed some of the hints that others posted. I put the cucumbers on ice over night. Also I only soaked them in the salt for 1.5 hours. I would wash the salt off the next time as they are a little salty but VERY crisp. I did the hot water bath for 12 minutes. But they are delicious otherwise.

Oh my.  I made these pickles last year and honestly sort of forgot about them as they got pushed to the back of the pantry.  I found them this summer when I was organizing my canning jars but I wasn't in a hurry to open them since I figured they'd be mushy after waiting a year.   I'm starting to run out of canning jars as we go through the summer gardening season, so I thought I'd try them and if they were soft I'd just dump them and free up the jars.  Nope... they were fabulous.  Still very crispy and the flavor is excellent.   This is a great recipe, and I followed it almost to the letter.  I'm not a big clove fan, so I just added one clover per pint jar that I made and it added a nice subtle hint of clove, which was plenty for me.  I love the cider vinegar and turmeric flavors together.  Definitely a keeper, and as berserk as my cucumbers are growing this year, I'm sure I'll be making more of them and NOT waiting a year to eat them.

I have found my recipe for Bread and Butter Pickles.  We made 25 jars of these last year and are down to 3.  We even had to buy cucumbers because our crop failed last year.  My whole family and everyone that has tasted this recipe thinks it is great.  My wife suggested leaving out the cloves for some of the jars.  We all thought the jars with tasted better.  We also used this same recipe to make bread and butter sweet peppers and they were great also.

I had an abundance of cucumbers from the garden this year, and I tried several different recipes for pickles. This is the best!  It is pretty easy, and the pickles are yummy.  I used large cucumbers, which are generally not recommended, and they were still great.  

The only change I made was I left out the green peppers. They seemed unnecessary, and my plants didn't do well this year, so I would have had to buy them.

I halved the recipe because I only had 6 cucumbers (about 6-8" long and 2" diameter).  I only used cucumbers and onions not the bell peppers and garlic.  I did not have celery seed so left it out.  I let them stand in the salt mixture with ice on top for about 3 hours, then drained and rinsed.  I had just enough for 4 pints which are currently in the water bath to be processed for 15 minutes.  I look forward to tasting these in the cold winter months!  UPDATE:  About 10 weeks later, we opened a jar.  These are really good but maybe a tad sweet.  The most exciting part is that the cucumbers and onions are still crisp.  I will make these again.

So good they are just ridiculous. I did add extra red pepper and some jars I added a homegrown pepper. I also followed the advise of others on the sugar and cut back. Can not wait to make more.

These were very tasty sweet pickles. The recipe produced about five to six pints. I added about two teaspoons of pickling spice and about a quarter cup of horseradish for my version of sweet horseradish pickles (tastes pretty similar to Nathan's brand).

These pickles are excellent.  Everyone that has tried them has loved them!  They are sweet, but this type of pickle is more on the sweet side.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very very good pickles! Nice and crunchy. The directions should be a bit clearer as to how many it makes. I'm a newbie pickler and I wasn't sure about quantities, but I got a good 4 quarts of pickles the first batch and the second we did in pints and I got about 9 pints. TONS of pickles. Will be good this winter with tuna! Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!!! I didn't have any bell peppers so I used a few hot banana peppers from my garden and it was just enough spice to balance the sweet. So good. My husband and I just ate a whole small jar in 15 minutes. Thank you!!

Being a first time 'pickler'I cut the recipe in half. Ended up with 7 pints of the best pickles I've ever made (or have ever eaten)!! These were really great, crispy and full of flavor. I placed one hot pepper in each jar just to ensure a good spiciness. Will definitely be keeping this one. Thanks for sharing.

You should read the reviews first. Hubby gave up after step 1 because he had more questions than answers.  Examples:  it's called sweating the cucumbers, doesn't specify canning salt but that's what's recommended, and use pickling cucumbers, the regular kind are too big.  We made 1/5 of the recipe and the amount of liquid isn't enough to cover the veggies.  I'm new to pickling and this recipe was nothing but frustration, thank goodness I read ahead so I had a clue!  The result is just meh.

I made these and they taste great, however I am giving only 4 stars as I have no Idea how many cucumbers  to use. The recipe should give the amount in oz and not just 25 cucumbers. This is misleading and vague as no cucumber have the same size. Anyway, hope someone can clear this out!!

This is my first ever attempt at making pickles.  My mother hated pickles, so, though she taught me volumes about cooking, I was on my own on this one.  I did follow the recipe pretty closely, but took a few tips from other reviewers as well.  My only changes were to add a half teaspoon of whole allspice, I used red bell peppers for the color, and I covered the salted cucumbers in a layer of ice while they were brining.  I ended up with 7 pints of beautiful, crunchy, delicious pickles!  I did water bath process them for 10 minutes so that I could store them in the pantry.  I think even my pickle-hating mother would be proud!

I had made this recipe last year and it was great but the Turmeric was too pronounced,  there was a bit more sugariness than I liked, and the garlic, for my taste, was both unnecessary and distracting.  So, I cut back to one tsp Turmeric, 4 cups of sugar and zero garlic. Brilliant!!! As modified, I would give it 5 stars.

First time I ever made my own pickles of any kind, and they turned out great!  After reading a lot of the reviews, I followed some of the suggestions listed below :
1.  I started with 2-6 quart baskets of cucumbers which contained exactly 26 - 5 to 6 inch cucumbers in each basket...so enough for 2 batches of this recipe
2.  Sliced them on a mandolin so I could get nice even slices about 1/3 of an inch thick
3.  I put each batch in a cooler, and topped it with ice cubes as someone suggested.  This gave me a lot of room to mix in the red peppers, onions and garlic, and kept them cool during the brining process.
4.  I used Pickling salt to brine the cucumbers, as per the recipe, and did NOT find them salty at all.  However I did give them a quick rinse after I drained them as someone suggested.
5.  Another suggestion I used was to reduce the sugar and increase the cider vinegar.  So I went with 4 cups Sugar and 4 cups vinegar.
6.  I boiled the brine mixture, but I did NOT put the pickles into the brine.  I simply packed the mixture into the jars very tightly, and then slowly poured the brine over top of the veggies in the jar, making sure there were no air pockets.  This way I had enough brine for all of my jars.
7.  I then did give my jars a 15 minute hot water bath to seal my jars.  I got 14 pint jars out of each batch of cucumbers for a total of 28 jars.  
Pickles turned out very crispy and taste awesome!  Will definitely do this again!

This recipe is the same as my mothers from 70 years ago and it is wonderful.  I use white cooking onions and ground cloves but otherwise it is the same.  You can leave the pickles on ice longer if you need to so don't worry about exactly 3 hours.  Also you could cut back a tad on the sugar if you  wanted to.  We made 26 quarts.  Hope that will be enough!  Enjoy!

A great recipe  and the adding of cloves is a nice tweak to the flavour.  The ice water brine  made the cucs really crisp. I took the advice of another reviewer and reduced the salt to 1/4 cup and rinsed before adding veggies to the syrup.  I thought 6 onions was to many so I reduced it to 4.  The only other comment I'll make is the ingredient list was not specific enough. Type and size of cucumber used(pickling, small, medium, large) and size of onion used(small, medium, large)I'm an experienced canner but for someone new to canning wouldn't know.  Definitely will make again.  Thanks

The first time I make a recipe, I normally do not vary at all from the original.  After reading others' reviews I did put ice on the cukes and onions while resting, and used 1/2 the turmeric called for.  This recipe is AWESOME!  My husband is VeRy picky, and he loves them!  I'm making my second batch as I type this.  I'm another person that normally doesn't review, but this recipe definitely called for a "Thumbs Up", and a big Thank You!!

My annual go-to recipe!  I make the following modifications (but it is very hard to gauge the size of the cuke yield due to size variations):  4 cups sugar (vs 5), double the garlic minced, red bell or mildly hot peppers (vs green bell) and 1-1/2 LARGE thickly-sliced Spanish or Vidalia onion per batch (vs 4-5 small yellow).  Yum!

I decided to change this recipe up in a few places:  I added about 2 cups of cracked ice as vegetables were sweating.  I put in only half of the turmeric, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to give it a little zip.   I also used a combo of red, yellow, and green bell pepper to give it more color and flavor.  I water bathed the pickles as I do not have the space in my refrigerator to store this many jars.  I doubt they last long though because they are really good.

I made these with the Armenian cucumber, Cucumis melo var. flexuosus, is a type of long, slender fruit which tastes like a cucumber and looks somewhat like a cucumber inside. It is actually a variety of muskmelon (C. melo), a species closely related to the cucumber (C. sativus). It is also known as the yard-long cucumber, snake cucumber, snake melon, and uri in Japan. It should not be confused with the snake gourds (Trichosanthes spp.). The skin is very thin, light green, and bumpless. It has no bitterness and the fruit is almost always used without peeling. The  cucumber was 24 inches long and about 2 inches in diameter. The ridges on the american give me a very beautiful pickle slice. These are really large pickle disks but they turned out delicious.  I cut the receipt in half except for the salt. Not have any canning or pickling salt I used course kosher salt. Knowing this was the wrong salt and too much for the amount of cucumber, I rinsed them before mixing with the liquid mix.  My yield was just short of 4 pints. 
I will make these again with less salt because even though I rinsed them they still came out a little salty. Knowing the salt was needed for a good pickle I might not have rinsed them enough. Should have tasted a couple.

This recipe is the best i've ever tried. The brine is soooo good that I even make pickled jalapenos with it. Slice up your jalapenos. Raw pack them in jars. Pour the brine over them with 1/2 in head space and process them as the Ball canning book tells you for the size jars and elevation you live in. For Christmas presents, this is what all my friends and family want. (Jar of peppers, B&B pickles & Blackberry Jalapeno Jam) If I could give it 10 stars I would. Just be sure to use pickling salt, not table salt.

Making these pickles! 'Ive got the pickling cukes, red onions, red bell pepper and garlic, salted, on ice, in a strainer, so any melted ice and liquid drawn out of the vegetables goes right down the drain. In a pot, I've got; vinegar, sugar, celery seed, mustard seed, turmeric, whole cloves, peppercorns and red pepper flakes simmering. I'll probably only end up with 2 quarts but that's perfect for me I don't need 2 dozen jars of pickles!  So while I used the recipe below as a guide, I went my own way on proportions and threw in a bay leaf and some red pepper flake for good measure. 1 cup of pickling solution was perfect for a quart of pickles.

I have never made bread and butter pickles before.  These were delicious!  I had to cook the cucumber mix in two batches which turned out fine.  I did follow another reviewer's suggestion to half the salt and glad I did.  For a little heat I added two sliced jalapeños to the mix.

I made this yesterday, and they are fantastic.. It does not look like enough brine in the beginning, but there is plenty to fill the jars.  I let mine sit on the counter in the salt for about 6 hours because I was also canning ginger pears and I think it made them even better.  I would add a little more turmeric.. maybe 1 more tbsp. But they are easy and delicious.

My 5 star review is based on my end result, because we all think they ended up being the best bread and butter pickles we've ever had. However, I made the recipe as stated, (except I omitted the green peppers due to preference) using pickling cucumbers and pickling salt and they were almost inedibly salty. I thought maybe the sugar in the pickling liquid would even it out, so I canned them and let them sit a while. Still way too salty, so I drained and rinsed them well and made a new batch of pickling liquid. This time around, they are delicious. I'm not sure if I should cut the salt the next time around, or just make sure I triple-rinse them...

delicious with the "warm" taste of garlic and turmeric.  I  use pickles instead of cukes, less salt in the soak and  pack these tightly in hot jars, halfway, then add brine, get out all the bubbles and finish with packing in more pickles and veg with 1/2" head space  to keep shrinkage to a minimum.  can these in water bath for 10 min.

These turned out really good! Easy to prepare. I didn't add the green peppers (neither of us really like them). Per several reviews I used CANNING salt instead of regular salt and also topped the cuke/onion/garlic/salt mixture with ice to make them crispy (and it seemed to work!!) I let that mixture cure for about 5 hours, drained and slightly rinsed, then added to the hot vinegar mixture. I got 6 1/2 pints. All of the jars sealed perfectly too! Definitely going to make this recipe again.

This was my first EVER canning of "Anything" & I must say it was VERY EASY !  However, I read a review prior to attempting this & wish I would  have listened....they are way too salty for my taste buds. Next time I will either CUT BACK ON THE SALT & RINSE OR BOTH! I will make these again with this recipe and think they will be perfect minus some Salt. Thanks for the easy & helpful recipe especially for a first timer.

Great pickles - full of flavor.  I made some minor changes - I lowered the amount of sugar so it equaled the amount of vinegar and they are still plenty sweet.  In doing that I ended up with a little less liquid than needed form my 10 pint jars.  So I'd suggest 4C vinegar and 4C sugar.  I also spiced it up with a little bit of hot peppers and some ground ginger.  I also finished them in a hot water bath for 10-15 minutes.  Overall, beautiful pickles with a fantastic flavor.  I'll be making these again.

These are the best bread and butter pickles I've ever eaten. I didn't see anything about ice in the recipe, but I let the sliced cukes, and other veggies and salt soak in ice water for 3 hours.  I think this made them crisper. Just delicious.

This has become my go-to sweet pickle recipe. A word of advice: I had to rinse my cucumbers after salting them. Otherwise, they were waaaaay to salty, and the rinse didn't seem to negatively affect the outcome.

Yes it is delicious. It is easy to make and worth 
making them. This is my second time this month I
am canning them.  I keep the spices in a
tea bay holder so there isn't too many of them in the batch.

made this for the first time...the family loved it.  these are the crispiest homemade pickles I've had...I let mine sit overnight though instead of 3 hours...I had to substitute the pickling spice you buy on the canning aisle instead of the mustard seed, celery seed,whole cloves,ground turmeric the store was all out when I went to purchase...must be canning season..also I used Vidalia onions and multi colored bell peppers just to make mine prettier.

I think you don't need to use ice unless you are going to let the cucumbers sit out for more than 2 hours. Some people let them sit overnight, so they put them in the fridge or keep them cool with ice. After the sitting time, all the salt should be washed off them before canning.

A 10 min boiling water bath will preserve them for at least a year if the jars seal properly.

I think is the best ever! I wanted something like a yum yum pickle & this delivers.  I  drained & rinsed well after 2 1/2 hrs, because of comments about the pickles being too salty, and processed 8 pts and 1 qt in a 250 oven for10 mins.  All sealed and are lovely and crunchy - reviewers are right, you can eat right away.  I didn't find them too salty with major rinsing.  Thanks Dave for sharing this recipe.

These are great pickles. I just went a little light on the sugar.  They are perfect and really easy to make. 

And the onions and peppers in the mix are great also.

I just made this today so haven't tried them yet.  I used one vidalia onion and one regular onion (I made half a recipe) and a red bell pepper.  I rinsed the vegetables after the salting period.  I was afraid I wouldn't have enough liquid but it worked out fine.  I got 7 pint jars.

I made this recipe, and added sliced hot peppers to some of the jars.  I had to hide what wasn't devoured by my kids and there friends in the first month.  I have had several compliments on these, and now need to plan on lots of cucumbers for next years garden. 
CAN'T WAIT!!

My neighbor gives me bags and bags of cucumber recipes every year, even though I grow my own. So, needless to say, I have tons of cucumbers to deal with. This year I tried a dozen different recipes and then sent some of them to work with my husband. I have requests for more of these pickles from both his co-workers and our family. I don't care much for pickles, but these I like. They stored great, but they didn't last long!

This was my first attempt at pickling/canning anything and they turned out great. I did cut the salt in half and found they were very sweet to begin with but got better with age as mentioned in other reviews. Thanks for the great experience.

This was my first attempt at pickles.  It was an easy recipe and the reviews were great.  Warning to others though about the turmeric though.  It is a counter stainer.  Make sure to pour over another container and don't set the jars on counters after filling or you might get yellow ring stains. A little cleaner and all was well again.  Thanks for a fun recipe.

These are okay.  They don't really taste like bread & butter pickles ... maybe needs more cloves & sugar?  Maybe a cinnamon stick?  I'm not sure.  But I've never made pickles before, and at least they're edible.

LOVED THEM! I've made bread and butter pickles before, but this was my first batch with green peppers and it was a great addition. The only thing I did differently than your recipe is I rinsed off the cucumber mixture after soaking in salt. It turned out just right after I was done. Thanks!

These pickles are delicious!  My husband made them and the only change was he used 10 large cucumbers and the recipe worked out perfectly.  This made 10 pints.

I made as listed the first time and canned the pickles. They were great! The next time, I used sweet pickling spice instead of the listed spices, but kept the vinegar and sugar the same and used the brine for beets. The next go round with cukes and beets I cut the salt to 2 T canning salt. Makes delicious beets that last forever after canned.

I have never made a pickle in my life, but tried this one based on reviews from others.  They are fantastic.  Using pickle cucumbers and pickling salt, I was able to produce 6 pints and 2 quarts of delicious pickles.  Will definitely try this one again probably adjusting from cooking onions to sweet onions.  Considering I got 35 cucumbers for $7 at the market, these are a bargain to make!  Thanks so much.

Very close to Mom's recipe (that I lost), but a little too salty.  I do remember my Mom soaking her sliced pickles in the ice/cold brine overnight, prior to adding to the hot vinegar mixture.  A very tasty pickle though.  I enjoy as a quick snack, in potato salad,  mixed greens salad, egg salad, or on a hamburger.  Love your recipe varieties.  A fabulous site.  Thank you.

I’ve made these twice now. Very good. Did not use cloves or green peppers, personal preference only. Otherwise followed closely. Did two large bowls of pickling cukes, sliced with a mandoline, 3 large onions per bowl, plus garlic. Added 1/2 cup pickling salt to each bowl. Mixed well, added a bunch of ice, let sit for 3-4 hours before draining and rinsing. After cooking the cukes in the brine, I filled the sterilized jars and processed in hot water canner. 18 pints. Beautiful! Thank you for the recipe!

Love love love these, reminds me of my grandma's pickles.  I did lightly rinse the salt off after the soak.  They can very well and I have made these (minus the cloves because I hate cloves) 5 times.

These turned out fine. I used pickling salt but still had to rinse the cucumbers after letting them stand for three hours. They would have been terribly salty.

If I could give these pickles 6 stars, I would. I added ice while the cucumbers, peppers and onions were sitting for 3 hours to make sure the were crispy. My husband wanted me to make dill pickles, but once he tasted these he asked me to use all of this years cucumbers for these bread and butter pickles. He said we'll do dill next year (ha). I'm on my 3rd batch so far. Yum!

Last summer our garden produced an abundance of yellow squash, so I made twenty jars of these pickles with just that one substitution.  My family are asking how long it will be until this summer's crop is ready..  "More pickles!"  They are the best!!!

I was shocked at how terribly these turned out. Onion to Cucumber ratio is off plus the Cucumber to Liquid ratio was way off. I even doubled the liquids and it was still not enough. As another reviewer mentions, having a weight of cucumber would make it easier to get things right as the only way that I can see 25 cucumbers as being right to the amount of liquid this recipe calls for is if they are mini gherkins. Maybe this is a recipe that a seasoned pickled can make work, definitely not for a beginner like me. Had to toss the whole batch out as it was inedible and certainly not sweet as I would expect a Bread and Butter pickle to be.

Im in the camp of making these less sweet than they are- That being said, the only thing I changed was reducing the amount of sugar to 3.5 cups, and switched out one red bell pepper for a green one- everything else remained the same. My family loves this recipe, and this is the second year I'm canning them

I followed the recipe exactly with the following exceptions: 
I didn't have 25 cucumbers, but I did have 10 extra huge cucumbers from my garden that were each as long as my forearm.  I opted to use Pickling Salt rather than table salt.  I cut back the Turmeric from 1 tablespoon to 1/2 a teaspoon.  I omitted the red peppers and onion slices, and chose to add pearl onions instead.

This yielded exactly 4 quart sized mason jars of pickles.

Great simple recipe.   I make twice as much of the liquid to put into the canning jars since I hot water bath these for 15 minutes and store the over the winter.  My family loves these pickles.

These are the best  Pickles I’ve ever made! I used 1 cup less of sugar and 1 extra cup of vinegar. I loosely measured the spices,  and put 2 cloves of garlic in each jar instead of in the veggies. This made 4 quart jars of pickles. I sliced some lengthwise for sandwiches. I am going to try other garden veggies with this juice!

When I first made this recipe, I did not think it tasted good.  A few weeks later my husband opened up a jar.  They were great.  I absolutely love these pickles.  I made 7 quarts and after only  2 weeks we had 1 jar left.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  It is amazing!!!!

Very good recipe will make it again. I did not have pickling salt so i used kosher salt. I also rinsed the cucumbers well before adding them to the brine. It was delicious.

I did halve the recipe as I only had about 10 to 12 of the little pickling cucumbers. It still turned out great. The flavor is good and the pickles were crisp. Not overly sweet like the store bought kind I loved the flavor.

These are Excellent!  My husband and I have tried canning Bread and Butter Pickles before and they turn out too soggy.  After Reading the reviews of slicing and making within 24 hours of picking has really helped.  Also sitting them in Salt and a bag of ice really does the trick of keeping the cucumbers crunchy.  I will definitely make them again.  I have given a jar to several of my neighbors and said they could not stop eating them, they are so good.

I used small pearl onions this time, and it looks gorgeous lined up in the pantry.  When I made this last year, I found it terribly salty, even though I rinsed the cucumber slices.  This year I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed again, and the pickles are much more edible that way.

I also heat processed them after packing them in the brine.  They last beautifully, and I've just opened the last jar from last week.

Theses bread and butter pickles are wonderful. I did as another suggested and rinsed the veggies before cooking them and I had a mix of hot and sweet peppers to put in it. They are perfect!

This  is what I did because I grew lemon cucumbers, and I did not find many recipes for them. I ended up with 13 pounds of sliced cucumbers so I increased the quantities of the components by 33% except for the salt. Additionally, I only used 1/2 cup of kosher salt. I also used a cooler for the salt bath and put some ice on the top to keep cool (I used an igloo cooler and the ice did not melt, it was 78 degrees in the house). I tasted the cucumbers after the salt bath and they we not overly salty (I do not like a lot of salt in my food). I also used what was in the house: red and white onions, and red frying bell peppers. I ended up with 14 pints of processed pickles with very little left over. The pickles are crunchy. This is my third attempt at making pickles with lemon cucumbers, but it is my favorite so far.

I followed the recipe exactly and I knew they were great when I couldn't stop eating the leftover syrup, it was so good

We let them sit 4 weeks at room temperature before eating, my wife and I nearly ate a pint jar when we opened! 

Just be sure to do the hot water bath to preserve but I suspect the next batch will be gone weeks after opening !

These are excellent pickles.  They taste so good, I sometimes have a few by themselves at night, just to satisfy my sweet tooth!  I made them for the second time today. The first time, I had used red onions, sliced in rings. The pickles are delightfully crunchy, and the red onion added nice color   The second time  I made this recipe   I expanded on the  color variation by using miniature yellow peppers, in addition to thinly sliced green peppers.. The color of the finished product is very nice.  In terms of specific suggestions, the quantities in the recipe are not exact.  For bread and butter pickles, I generally use larger cucumbers and slice them very thinly. The total quantity of cucumbers plus pepper plus onion should be about 1 gallon, for the amount of liquid generated by this recipe.

Really happy with how this turned out.  Next batch I am going to dial it back on the onion and the mustard seed.  I'm not saying that the measurements on these were wrong, it's just a personal preference.  Would definitely recommend trying this recipe out.

Excellent recipe! For those of you that are hot and spicy fanatics, like many in my family, I divided the batch into regular, and hot and spicy.  For the hot and spicy, I added a few habanero peppers (5 to be exact) after I made up the regular jars. Throw in a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and ta-da...hot and spicy sweet pickles.

The flavor was very good on this but the ratios all wrong. I didn't use pickling cucumbers so could be why. Too many veggies for not enough brine. Will try again.

I have used this recipe for the past 40 years- it's that good! Several years ago I tasted a similar pickle but it was hot- I loved it and decided I would modify this recipe to try to duplicate it.  I added 1/2 tablespoon of red hot chili pepper flakes to the brine and 1/2 of a jalapeño pepper with seeds to each jar. WOW- this modification is a gourmet delight for anyone who likes that extra dimension of peppery heat.

I followed the recipe to a T and must say these are by far the nastiest pickle I have ever eaten. Waste of time and money as I emptied all the jars in the trash. I mean kerosine cucumbers bad. Maybe I did something wrong but this eliminates the chance of me ever making homemade pickles again. I will just go to the store from now on.

Very good recipe. Plan to make it again and add cauliflower and some fresh pimento peppers. A friend used to give me quarts when he made his this way and it was fantastic.

The recipe only calls for green bell peppers. Why didn't you add the red peppers in the recipe like the photo, if they are in fact sweet red peppers?

These were initially a bit salty and I wasn't sure if I liked the flavor.  However, after they sat in the fridge for 3 weeks they were delicious!  I made quart jars.  The two slight recipe adjustments I made were:  I added 2 tsp of ground red pepper to the canning liquid and also put two sprigs of dill in each quart jar.  So glad I made quart jars rather than pint.  They go pretty fast.   Processing:  as another reviewer noted, I added the pickles to the jars, then added the hot liquid, and then processed the sealed jars in a hot water bath.  When many jars are made at a time, it isn't practical to store them in the fridge.  Thank you!

Okay only change was I used whole garlic cloves, used a whole bulbs worth. The only other thing I would do is cut the cucumbers to 1/4 inch thick. Now that being said life happened and I did have them sitting in the brine  for two days! OOPS!
Anyway these are the best bread and butter pickles I have ever made. Easily tweak able, I maybe added a lot of sweet peppers, not green peppers but red, yellow and orange. DO USE CANNING SALT, otherwise I think it would be to salty. You gotta try these!!!

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  I have made it with salad-type cucumbers and pickling cucumbers and everyone raves no matter what cucumber I use.  This time I made it with pickling cucumbers and got exactly 7 pints, using all but about 1/4 cup of the brine.  Try a slice on a cracker with sharp cheddar cheese!  For my family, these are a must-add in tuna, chicken or egg salad, and potato or macaroni salad.  A little of the leftover brine is great added to poultry marinade or brushed on broiled or grilled seafood.

I place a few ice packs over a piece of plastic wrap to keep the cut up cukes crisp. Love to add the peppers from my garden & stock up enough jars till next year. These are my favorite pickles so easy to make & I grow my own pickling cukes so I make them in stages throughout the summer as I pick them. I'll never buy a pickle again!!!

I Don't normally like bread & butter pickles but these are really good. Husband loves them. Like other reviewers I put ice over the cucumbers while soaking to keep them crispy. (I also mixed them periodically during the 3hr soak) I Used red bell pepper (only had red/yellow on hand) but chose red because of the color. Husband wanted a little heat so I sliced a jalapeño to add to It. I couldn't find celery seed at the store so I used celery leaves instead. I pulled the cucumbers out of the brine & rinsed really well. I wasn't 100% wether or not to put the brine in with the vinegar mixture or discard but one reviewer noted to keep it so I did. I added the brine with the vinegar & brought that to a boil while I rinsed the cucumber mixture in another bowl.

Loved it! love the added cracked ice to the 3hr waiting period, keep all crisp and cold. Easier drainage, I also do the boiling in the microwave and it makes a quick job of it before jarring.

This is the first recipe i have ever tried for B&B pickles and we are hooked! Thanks to all the tips in the reviews my pickles turn out fabulous! We are still making them to store away but it is well worth the labor. Great recipe!

I love this recipe. Very good. I did put the vegetables in a salt and ice bath for 2 hours and rinsed before moving to the next step.

I just finished making these, and all I can say is Yummm!  I made half the recipe, forgot to put in 
the bell peppers, but they are delicious anyway.  The cloves add a special flavor.  Also, I rinsed the
pickles a long time to get rid of as much salt as possible.  Thanks, Dorothy

I made a batch last night and they turned out nearly perfect.  I processed them for about 7 minutes in order to preserve some for later in the year.  Will definitely make more, trying to perfect an extra crispy pickle and add some zing maybe with habanero or other chili pepper.  Very good recipe.

This recipe is great!  It was my first attempt at pickles because I had an abundance of cucumbers.  Everyone who has tasted them raves about them.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

I am new to pickling cucumbers and this recipe was very easy and the results were excellent.
