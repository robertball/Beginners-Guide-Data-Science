I made this tonight and my whole family really enjoyed it.  The next time I make it I will definitely add mushrooms.  It was simple and quick and great to have a meal that only requires 1 pot and 1 skillet to make.

This was pretty good. I thought it had too much flavor though from the McCormick package. I think next time I will use half of it and add some bigger tomato pieces and mushrooms.

This was a quick dish to make!  I was surprised at how great it tasted.  Something you might find at an Italian restaurant. I added some mushrooms and spinach for extra veggies. I will be making this again!

This is one of my favorite McCormick Gourmet spice mixes! I love creamy pasta dishes...especially with chicken! I used light cream instead of heavy cream and it was still delicious! These spice mixes really make the dish taste gourmet!

I've tried most of the new McCormick Gourmet Recipe Mixes and this one is at the top of my list. Everyone loved it. Leftovers reheated really well. So quick and easy to prepare!

This was fantastic!  We couldn't find the McCormack seasoning for sun-dried tomatoes.  Instead we used the Sweet Basil and Oregano Bruschetta seasoning and it was delicious.  Also, some of us added some red pepper flakes for a little kick.  Definitely a keeper.

Great flavors! I made as written & it was very tastey.. I made it a 2nd time and added pancetta and  peas...absolutely delicious. (If you don't like pancetta- throw in some precooked bacon! Gotta try it!!! You will love it!!! =)

This was fantastic!   It was really easy to prepare, so, it would be perfect for a weeknight meal. The flavor from the spice pack was so good!   I will try what another reviewer did and try light cream next time.  It was really yummy, but, it would be nice to cut some of the calories from the cream and still keep the flavor.  Definitely a winner!

Excellent recipe. Looking for low calorie dishes that actually have flavor? - this is one of them! I make this a couple of times a month and it is becoming a family favorite.

Easy and quick recipe,phenomenal flavours. Little rich on calories, Oh well!!
i have a weakness for garlic and you cannot have an italian dish without garlic, so I stir fried the chicken in a dollop of minced garlic.  Yummmmmmm

This was really yummy and is a definite add to our meal rotation. I used half-n-half because our store didnt have any light cream, but I figured 1 cup of it wouldnt hurt. When I put in the diced tomatos without straining them I was worried it would be too runny but with the noodles it was perfect. I also wilted in some fresh spinach before adding the noodles and that was a great addition. I wouldnt change a thing and am excited to eat my leftovers for lunch!

This was tasty!  I couldn't find the right packet to like another reviewer I used a different one.  Now that I have the right packet on hand, next time I'm sure it will be much better.  A do-over for sure.

Interesting that this recipe does not include ALL the ingredients (as shown on McCormick's website).  I made this and my sauce was not thick - thought I should have added cornstarch but talked myself out of it - figured the recipe should work.  Nope. :(  Missing from the recipe as written:
- 2 cloves of chopped garlic 
- 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (ahh ... there it is)
- 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes ... and
- 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese - not 1/2 cup.
Also found that they have listed substitution spices for the packet that cannot be bought anymore (1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp sea salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper).
I added fresh mushrooms and Pancetta and will be trying it again as my family liked it even with the watery sauce.

I used 2lbs of chicken (salted and peppered) and added an onion. I also used some olive oil in addition to butter. Otherwise I made as written and it was wonderful. Seasoning was perfect. Hubby kept raving over how good it was! Will definitely make again.

Knowing 1 lb of chicken strips or tenders would not feed my family, I doubled the recipe. I used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes w/garlic & onion and the juice from both cans. I grated my own parmesan cheese and used the whole 5 oz wedge which was a little more than the doubled amount of 1 cup. I also used fat-free half & half to cut down on the calories from the parmesan. Ironically, I only used 1 pkg. of the McCormick mix - I seasoned the chicken breast strips while browning them with garlic salt, season-all and onion powder. This turned out delicious! You couldn't tell anything fat-free had been used in this. In fact my daughter said it tasted like an entree from Carraba's or Olive Garden :)  So quick & easy too! Thanks McCormick!

I used half & half along with whipped cream cheese, I couldn’t find the McCormack’s pack so I used Knorr Parma Rosa sauce mix, and instead of grated cheese I used  parmesan finely shredded cheese. The dish came out delicious!!

this was amazing. I couldn't find the McCormick package either. I used Italian Seasoning & Clasico Roasted Sun-dried Tomato Alfredo Sause. I also added another cup of pasta because there's plenty of thick, creamy sause.

delicious!  The only thing I did different was us the petite diced tomatoes with green chiles and it gave it the right amount of kick!  Not sure how it would feed "8" though.

So good! Even my hubby who does not do cream sauces loved it! I used light cream and used only half the pack of seasoning. It's a keeper!!

This was a little bland as is for my liking.  Next time I will add tomato with chili, onions, garlic, and bacon.  When re-heating the left overs I added some bacon and that really enhanced the favors.

I absolutely loved this recipe! However, I only gave it 4 stars as I tweeked it a bit. After cutting the chicken into strips, I coated them in a mixture of flour (about 3 tbsp.) and the seasoning mix (about 2 tbsp.) to incorporate the spice flavor into the chicken. Also, after cooking them in the butter, I set them aside and added them when the pasta is added. I also added mushrooms and cut up some bacon for additional depth and flavor. With these additions, it's a five star recipe!

We made this for dinner last night and it was easy and very tastey. This McCormick mix was tough to find, but I'm going to stock up for future.  I recommend this dish for flavorful and fast to make!!

lacked a bit of taste. Next time i make it I plan on tweaking the recipe a bit. The chicken could have used more flavor, maybe a light  marinade of your choice,just an hour or so before cooking.  i plan on fresh garlic and maybe some pre-mixed italian herbs (short-cut, I know) other than that, i added extra cheese and while my family did not rave about it, it was still a pleasant meal that didn't take me FOREVER to prepare:)

Really good and quick!  I used 2% milk and it worked fine.  I didn't use the whole box of pasta...didn't seem like it would be creamy enough if I did.  I added fresh spinach and will add fresh sliced mushrooms the next time.  I also only used about 1/4 of the diced tomatoes because of my kids....but did use all of the juice from the can.  My 6 year old was eating it out of the pan because he couldn't wait for it to be served.  He said it was better than his favorite dish when we go out to a chain "noodle" restaurant.  It was a definite hit with everyone including the 2, 5, and 6 year old :)

Made this last night and the outcome was really good. My daughter loved it to say the least and you know kids can be your best or worst critic. I couldn't find the Mccormick Gourmet seasoning so I used the Mccormick chicken parm instead. Hopefully it wasn't too off, still had a nice flavor. I had to add a little more salt for taste but other than that I enjoyed it. I can't wait to have it for lunch.

Amazing! This recipe was simple to make and very scrumptious. I cut chicken breast tenderloins in bite size bites. then, i meted the butter, added a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic from a jar. Then sprinkled the mixture with a tuscany seasoning I had in the cabinet. Followed the recipe from there. Last change was that I added a package of sliced mushrooms the last 5 minutes of simmering.  One last note, the recipe was enough for my husband and I plus enough for a lunch. Definitely a five star.

Simple, easy recipe!  Was tasty for being ready so fast.  Used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, and it didn't seem to affect the flavor or outcome.  The 2 tablespoons of butter to brown the chicken wasn't all necessary if you're looking to cut a couple calories.  Could use olive oil or a little less butter, and it would still be great.  Adding spinach or mushrooms would also be good.

Quite good.

I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and oregano before cooking and I added sliced carrots and mushrooms. I'll definitely make it again, especially when crunched with time.

Ok made this last night and it was delicious, however, I did make some changes. I doubled the 1/2 and 1/2 as well as used 2 seasoning packets. I doubled them cause I added 1 large portabella mushroom diced and spinach so I wanted to make sure the sauce would cover everything. I also added more pasta, not much more but a little. I will make this again for sure but think I will try and add artichoke hearts and onions next time. Maybe even try it will shrimp instead of chicken. Hope this all helps others... :-)

Made this dish this evening. Quite easy and good. I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought it wasn't great. I used oil instead of butter to lessen the calories and went for the 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the heavy whipping cream. I definitely would make again since it was so easy and tasty. I think I'll increase the parmesan cheese for more flavor.

This was awesome and easy!  I added some Italian Cheese Blend at the end to make it a little creamier. Yummy!

8 servings?  More like 2 because I couldn't stop eating this dish, it was so good!  and so easy to make.  I'm definitely adding this to my dinner rotation.
