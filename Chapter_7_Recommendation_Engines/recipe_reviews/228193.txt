I used ground turkey that I spiced up to fake italian sausage. I used everything in this recipe including the olives and RED pepper. I did saute the vegetables in a little EVOO before adding them to the crockpot. I served this with thick slices of garlic bread. Good recipe but all of us commented on how it was missing one important thing--CHEESE! It also was tricky to scoop up all the chunks with bread, it's an interesting recipe because who thinks to make spaghetti sauce fondue? I might make this again. I don't know. It'd make a great sauce for a pasta dish, that's for sure.
