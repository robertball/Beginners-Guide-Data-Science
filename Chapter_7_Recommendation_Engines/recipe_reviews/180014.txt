Of all the slow cookers, in all the towns, in all the world, this recipe was made in mine.  I'm not sure how Moroccan this recipe really is (at least enough to rip off a Casablanca quote, apparently), but it's hardly worth researching once you taste it.  I did fail to have on hand lemon juice, having used the last of it in some hummus a few days ago, so that part is missing. I'm guessing it would have helped to further balance the sweetness, which should have been easily predicted seeing the ingredient list. That being said, I personally like a little spice in these sorts of dishes, so I may just add some form of chile pepper, whether it be fresh or dried in my next preparation of this dish, which I believe will be much sooner than much later.  Regardless of it's very few shortcomings, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship (couldn't help it).

This tastes great and is healthy with all the fruits and vegetables.  I added a first layer of chopped sweet potatoes. Can't wait to make it again!

This is the first time I had a "tagine" dish and I looked at a lot of other similar recipes on other sites before I settled on this one -- mostly because of the convenience of a slow cooker. It was delicious. I substituted golden raisins instead of cranberries, since a lot of other recipes use that instead. I will be adding this to my recipe book.

This recipe was really good - far different from our normal dinner.  We used all chicken breast and put them whole, frozen in the bottom of the crockpot.  We cubed and browned the eggplant, but didn't add it to the crockpot until there was about 2 hours left in the crockpot.  Other minor changes included adding 1/2 can of black beans (the cumin seemed to be calling for them), about 1 tsp paprika and a few shakes of hot sauce, as some of the other reviews said it needed to be spicier.    It was very easy to make and it made enough for my husband and I to eat all week!!  I knew it was a good dinner when my husband told me it was a great find on the website.    I think we will make this for company next time.

This is delicious.  The smells while cooking were incredible, and the flavor was just amazing!  I could only give it four stars for two reasons.  First, the chicked cooked down so much it practically disintegrated.  It was hard to find the chicken amongst all the vegetables.  Second, the onion, which we usually love in anything had a strange chewy texture.  Hubby and I both pushed it aside.  It might be better sauted first to carmelize and give it flavor and tenderness.  Of course the risk would be disintegrating after cooking so long, but that might enhance the flavor.  The flavors were mouth watering, so I'll try to adjust either bigger pieces of chicken, whole thighs or something that keeps the chicken from disappearing.

This was a wonderful dish that will become a regular. The mixture of spices was perfect and I like things full of flavor! The only change I made to the spices was to add freshly grated ginger. Maybe that made the difference, maybe not but I would definitely do it the same again. I did put three frozen chicken breasts directly on the bottom of the crockpot, ommitting the beginning step, which made this even faster and easier. The chicken shredded perfectly after about four hours on high. Also, the added eggplant didn't seem to either be necessary or detract from this recipe. I'll add it again next time only if I have it on hand or it's on sale. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. It kind of got lost in the dish and wasn't needed. Everything else was perfect!

Very good...Nicely innovative for those of us with out the pricey Tagine pot.  We hate eggplant at my house and since everyohne said it cooked down to nothing, I just didnt see a reason to add the slimey gook to the recipe.  I used a large butternut squash instead--peeled, seeded and cut in one-inch cubes. It was probalby about 3-4 cups total.  Everything else I kept the same.  5 Hours on high was way too long, as pretty much everything turned to mush, but the flavor was out of this world. The seasonings  were spot on.  Next time  I  will use real garlic, not garlic-salt, and will add less broth/liquid.  It was on the wet side.  I think I'll also try cooking this in my dutch oven in the oven as I think that it would benefit from some caramalization.  Thank's for a tasty suggestion.

WHOA!  This was really a delicious recipe!  I added a tsp more of flour, a tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley just because I had it and a tsp of dried lemongrass.  I had NEVER cooked with eggplant (they scare me) but was glad I did.  I also cup up a couple white sweet potatoes and will do so next time.  Go for it.  Don't OVERCOOK it though.  I served mine over brown basmati rice.

I thought this turned out great - much more interesting than the the typical slow cooker recipes.  I used frozen chicken breasts and shredded it into big chunks at the end.  The chicken was delicious, super moist.  I left out the fruit and adjusted the sauce a little to my taste (more cumin, fresh ginger, etc.). It's a great base, I think it would be hard to mess up. (And trust me I know how to mess up a recipe.)  I served with brown rice and thought the leftovers were even tastier since the flavors seemed to blend even more.

This one was a true hit!  I was looking for a way to clear out some items in the fridge, freezer and pantry and came across this recipe.  The only thing I had to buy was the eggplant.  I made the recipe as written - except that I used whole, bone-in chicken thighs (skin removed) - and it was delicious.  My only comment is that the recipe says it serves 8.  This is either optimistic or based on very light eaters.  I served 5 adults and had less than a serving left over.  I also made extra couscous for soaking up that incredible sauce.   yum, Yum, YUM!

This recipe was fabulous.  I cooked it in a large pan instead of the slow cooker, used chicken breasts instead of thighs (trying to save calories), and substituted dried peaches for the apricots.  Because I was not using the slow cooker, I sprinkled all of the dry spices on the chicken and eggplant before browning them in the pan.  I added the flour into the pan to cook out the raw-ness before adding the liquid and it thickened beautifully.  Definitely a keeper, and the lemon juice is a must!

Switched the carrots with sweet potatoes after I realized my carrots went bad.  I also used fresh minced ginger.  This turned out very tasty. A nice quick and easy meal for the middle of the week.  Thanks!

The flavors in this are really nice.  Kind of mellow, but great.  I made changes out of necessity, but am reviewing it anyway to share my experience.  I made this on the stovetop instead of the crockpot because I had the luxury of being home (and didn't feel like washing two pots).  After browning the chicken, I just threw in the onion to brown in the same pot, and then threw in the spices to toast a bit.  After that, I dumped all the rest of the ingredients in.  I left out the eggplant because we didn't have any and made up for it by adding more carrots, but I didn't change any of the spices.  The smell in the house was just divine!  I let it simmer until dinner (a few hours), but I was salivating the whole time.  It tasted as great as it smelled.  I served it with white jasmine rice, but I think basmati or couscous would have been a better choice.  The hubby loved it -he commented on how great it smelled as soon as he walked in the door.  and it was a hit with my 20 month old!  She kept asking for more....  Great dish.  Thanks!

This one floored my husband. The flavor is just knock-em-dead fantastic. Don't be distraught by the apparent long list of ingredients - you probably have most in your pantry. I used regular white potatoes, chicken breasts instead of thighs, and a garlic-pine nut couscous. Do not skip the layering process - its important to how the food cooks and the layers blend. Spray the bottom of your crock pot with a little non-stick cooking spray to keep your potatoes from sticking.

Made as the recipe calls for except I used chicken breast. It turned out great! I'm not sure the carrots added anything to the dish so I may leave those out next time. The eggplant was cooked so long it melted in your mouth! Yum! Will make again!

I really enjoyed this recipe - and boy did it smell incredible while cooking! Based on what I had onhand in the kitchen, I omitted the eggplant, substituted raisins for the cranberries and apricots, and added some potatoes.  I also used one onion instead of two because after cutting up one, I thought the slow cooker looked 'oniony' enough.  My only comment is that the dish tasted a bit salty for my liking, but that might have been because I didn't have enough lemon juice?  On the other hand, my salt-loving husband thought it was just right and has urged me to try it with lamb next time!  So there will be a next time!!  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe!  My husband and I licked our plates clean!  I used all ingredients as listed in recipe with a couple of "adjustments".  Had 3 small Thai eggplants which i cubed in 1/2" pieces.  Also added 1/4 tsp curry powder and couple of dashes of cayenne since we like it spicy. Like another reviewer, I seasoned the chicken with some of the spice mixture and browned well.  Set browned chicken aside and added the carrots and onion to the pan with more spice mixture and cooked until some of the onion/carrot mixture caramelized.  Put the chicken thighs in with all other the ingredients, covered and simmered for approximately 1 hour 20 minutes. Cooked my couscous and added it to the pot.  Perfect!  Thanks for a wonderful, exotic addition to my recipe file.

This was a great blending of ingredients.  The proportions were very nice.  I used almost the exact incredients but cooked it completely differently, how I observed similar dishes being cooked while in Morocco.  I seasoned the chicken thighs and browned them, added the veggies and browned, then added broth, lemon juice, and tomato paste and fruit and simmered for about 2 1/2 hours.  It smelled insanely good and was quickly devoured by all.  Thank you for sharing this!

I am always looking for slow cooker recipes that do not rely on canned soups, and if they have good flavor, even better!.  This was quite good - we don't care for eggplant, so I substituted chunked sweet potatoes (actually, yams); I also cut the chicken into slightly larger pieces than the recipe called for.  It needed more spice, for our tastes, so will increase those by about half next time I make it, and probably yield to my husband's wishes and add a smidge of powdered hot pepper to heat things up a bit!.  Thanks for a very nice addition to the recipe box.

Loved this - did some things differently, though. I only had bone-in thighs, so that's how I cooked them (just browned on each side). Also, left out the onions, cranberries and eggplant. Instead I added chickpeas, and a wedge of lemon at the bottom of the pot (alongside the chicken). Served over couscous - delicious!

Super winter comfort dish.  As others have said, do not overcook this (4-5 hours max on high). I used breast meat b/c I didn't have thighs.  I made it with golden raisins and carmelized the onions first, as another reviewer suggested.  We do not like couscous, so I served it over brown rice. I like the idea of adding yams; next time, I'll give that a try. Yum!

Interesting.  My friends loved it...me not so much.  But it was a concensus amongst us all that it needed more heat.  Something to spice it up a bit.  Probably won't make it again.

This came out beautifully!  I browned the chicken in a dutch oven, then tossed in everything else (minus the tomato paste, which I didn't have, and the eggplant, which I detest with a fiery passion) and cooked over low-medium for a few hours.  Chicken was flavorful and moist!  We had this over M'hamsa couscous and loved it.  The leftovers were equally tasty.

Made this on the stove top instead of slow cooker and used raisins instead of cranberries and apricots (didn't have them). Still tastes great and definitely something I would make again.

Excellent chicken! I put whole semi-frozen boneless thighs in the crockpot as they were going to be in for at least 6 hours. Served over rice as I had no couscous. Next time I would enjoy more apricots, but the seasonings were spot on.

Fabulous! I cut the spices a wee bit, since I was serving to a little one. Also added about a quarter cup of water and used dried mango in place of the apricots, since I didn't have any on hand. Delicious, and even the 20 month old asked for more! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was brilliant.  Did a few things different.   First, I used low-sodium chicken stock instead of broth.   Next, I used five garlic cloves and one tsp of salt instead of garlic salt, and about two inches of fresh ginger, chopped up really good, instead of the ground ginger.  Finally, I used peeled baby carrots out of the package instead of the large, thinly sliced carrots.  Prep took about an hour. Cooked it for eight hours on low.   The dish is involved, but is the best, most flavorful recipe used from AllRecipes.com so far. Brilliant!

Excellent flavour !  Added a little Cayenne and some Morrocan spice and everyone loved it. They even liked the couscous which I hadn't made before but it went very well with this dish. Cooked it on high for 4 hours and that was definitely long enough.  Next time I'll add the egg plant near the end as it of course turned to mush after 4 hours.

This was excellent.  I made it exactly as written.  The only thing I would do next time is increase the amount of couscous to 2 cups or substitute it for brown rice.  Loved loved the flavors.  Nice healthy one pot meal.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This is an easy recipe and was well-received by my gang.  CHANGES (1) Used 12 chicken "tenders" instead of the thighs. (2) Peel eggplant.  Bet sweet potatoes would work well in this dish.  (3) Altho I used apricots, peaches would work well.  (4) Raisins are a fine substitute for cranberries.  (5) no salt + 3 large cloves garlic, minced, for garlic salt. (4) 1 T chili powder and 1 T cayenne for cumin and ground black pepper. (5) I'll use 1 T ginger next time.  1 t cinnamon was ok.  (6) Didn't layer but did give it all a stir before putting lid on.  (6) Used 2 onions (not a change but some have commented it's "too onion-y."  Since everything cooks down and softens a lot, 2 onions are no too many. (7)  I needed some cornstarch mixed with water to thicken (about 1/4 cup); flour not enough. Added right to crockpot; no need to empty into saucepan and heat on stove to make cornstarch thicken sauce. (8) Son preferred his over rice. Will definitely be making this one again. mb

My boyfriend and I liked this. I actually grabbed pork chops by accident, so I made it with pork instead of chicken (and I think it was a good substitution). I think if I were to make it again, I'd add a little less lemon juice and maybe replace the 1 cup of water with apple juice.

This was delicious! I decided to add 1 sweet potato, a tsp of Turmeric, 1/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper, & 3 cloves of garlic. I sauteed the onions, garlic, chicken, and eggplant before placing in the bottom of the slow cooker. Then I topped with sweet potato and followed the rest of the recipe. I ate it with dirty brown rice, naan, and some plain yogurt. Very filling and satisfying!

I loved this.  The rest of my family was "eh."  However, they're not very adventurous eaters, and since I'm the cook, I'm giving it 4 stars.  I liked it enough to make again knowing I'm going to get complaints from everyone.

I loved this recipe. I only rate it 4 stars because my husband didn't love it (he thought it was "pretty good" -- thats not enough enthusiasm for me!). But I really customized this to what we had in our pantry, so perhaps I'll try this again when I have all the ingredients on hand. We omitted the eggplant, and we used apricot preserves (about 3TBL). Served with rosemary couscous. I also made this on the stove top. Once the ingredients were combined (sans couscous) I covered the pan and let it simmer for about an hourish. Turned out great. It's going into my recipe book!

After reading others comments, I left the chicken thighs whole, browned them in a deep electric frying pan; removed them and sauteed the eggplant and onion.  I added a pinch of cloves, and a pinch of cayenne pepper, and  I cooked the whole thing in this electric fryer at about 275 degrees (Simmer temperature).  In just under 3 hours, the meat was tender, vegetables were cooked and it wasn't soupy - it was delicious.

This was delicious and filled the house with an amazing aroma!  Like many others, I substituted golden raisins for the cranberries.  I also didn't add the eggplant until 2 hours left on cooking time.  I threw the chicken breasts in whole and then used a fork to shred them at the end.  Thumbs up!

Me and my family really enjoyed this recipe! I substatuted ing. With what I had on hand. I used onion powder,[had no fresh]and prunes[had no apricots],and a small can of tomatoe sauce instead of paste. My 3 year old said,"mmm good mom“aft  er the first few bites,and my 3,4,and 5 year old boys cleaned their plates. Oh, and I also added the eggplant the last hour of cooking to keep it in tact. My husband liked the cinnamon! :)

This is totally amazing, so much flavor from my crockpot! I added a sweet potato, still kept the eggplant, and because of so many veggies I added a little water.  It came out like a delicious stew served over couscous.  I also salted to taste, it needed a bit more to offset the sweetness.

This recipe was great. I did, however, add a bunch of ingredients to make it more like tagines I've loved. I added: a can of artichoke hearts, the rinds of the lemon (left whole, removed before serving), 1 1/2 cups of pitted olives, and I doubled the lemon juice. I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. Oh and I used pork chops because that's what I had. Next time I'll also add a can of chickpeas.

I made this exactly as stated aside from adding the eggplant 1 hour before the end, and served with plain couscous.  It was very hearty and satisfying.  I could see the case for making it spicier but we enjoyed it just as it was.  I will make this again, for sure, it's a winner.  The cranberries and apricots really lend well to it, I would recommend not skipping out on them.  I cooked on high, which for my slow-cooker is a 4 hour cycle, so the vegetables still had some crunch to them. Good stuff!!

I can only give four because I changed to suit what I had on hand - DELICIOUS!!!!!!  I didn't have apricots so I used dried tart cherries - they were slightly sweet, about as sweet as apricots. I did add a little crushed pepper.  Also, I felt it needed a little something, probably since I didn't have the apricots, so I added two tablespoons of jarred peanut satay sauce.  It was outstanding!  I did use chicken breast and cut each in half again.

Just tried this recipe tonight. We loved it.  I made it exactly as directed and served it with Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley instead of couscous. My husband says "it's a keeper!"

My husband and I LOVE this recipe.  I make it with chicken breasts as we don't like dark meat, but otherwise exactly as written.  If you like that slightly sweet, fruity main dish with the Mediterranean spiciness unusual to the Western palate, you will love it!  So easy too-put it in the crockpot before work and when you get home you can make the couscous in 5 minutes.  This and a glass of milk is all you need for a healthy filling supper.  Keeps great in refrigerator or freezer for leftovers. For some other perspectives, my college daughter said it was "OK" and my 8 year old granddaughter said "good"  (and ate her whole bowlful).

Loved this and so does friends and family I have served it to.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and did not use eggplant, I have used butternut squash or yam instead with great results.

I have never had anything like this, but had produce from the garden I had to use up. I followed the recipe exactly, except subbed raisins for cranberries. It rocked. This is a keeper. Easy, warming, comfort food.

I adapted the basic recipe to meet with what I had in my pantry/refrigerator. Also as I wanted a quickly made meal I made it as a casserole which I cooked at 375 for 35 minutes. I used leeks instead of the onion, and didn't have the eggplant. As my sister had said the cranberries were too sweet when she made the recipe I substituted currants, and also left out the carrots. I used fresh garlic which I sauteed with the leeks. Very delicious result. I'll try the slow cooker next time to compare results.

I was excited to see a slow cooker recipe which I hoped would be somewhat like the country captain chicken (Racheal Ray's recipe) I make on the stove top.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was awful! Smelled great, but It was watery, bitter aftertaste, fruit and vegetables were mushy.

Loved the taste. I used frozen chicken legs and thighs (unbrowned) but I browned fresh garlic and the onions. I used fresh ginger and fresh apricots instead of dried. I also found the recipe cooked in about five hours on low in my slow cooker. I expect cooking times vary depending on the type of cooker used. I will increase the spices next time I make this, and there will be a next time.

Was in the mood for something different, so decided to try this.  Wonderful!  Used chicken breast, as that was all I had on hand.  My husband was doubtful - but one bite, and he was lovin' it.

This is the first time I have ever tried tagine and the first time I have used a slow cooker. Apart from adding a little paprika, slightly less cumin (as I sometimes find cumin a bit overpowering) and dropping the egg plant as recommended by others I followed the recipe to the letter. This was delicious, there is a just a slight sweetness from the fruit and the touch of tomato paste, along with the lemon juice and ginger gives a great balance of flavour, this has been added to my recipe book and will definitely be made again.

This is a very tasty dish. I don't usually like any sweetness in my main meal, but this was fine. My wife also liked it but the kids weren't as keen. The only changes made were: breast instead of thigh; tomato passata instead of paste. We needed about double the couscous.

I fixed exactly as the recipe called, and it was a big hit with my entire family.  This says alot since my husband is a french chef.  I love it when I can find a tasty dish that also presents well.  My husband is so much into the presentation of the meal.

I made this as written with the addition of chili paste and fresh ginger.  I still found it to be bland and in need of salt.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't stand out to me.

I made this for company and got great results. The flavors of this were wonderfully complex and satisfying. I did make some substitutions though. I didn't have chicken on hand, so used boneless pork chops. And I also didn't have any cranberries. Next time I make this I'll be sure to add the cranberries. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is I tried the leftovers with a little sour cream and it really smoothed out the flavor combination. It was excellent.

This was by far the most disappointing well-rated recipe I have used from All Recipes.  My husband (who LOVES everything) said to me "Honey, I love you....but this is not good."  I followed the recipe exactly.  Not much to say - it jsut was not good.

the potential was there...this smelled AMAZING for the first hour. but after only 4.5 hrs on low in the slow cooker this was bland and mushy, even though the chicken was dry. Also, all of the flavors had been mashed to death together, and everything tasted the same - there were no layers to the flavors.  I will try this recipe again, in a casserole dish in the oven for about 45-60min.

Very nice dish.  As eggplant cooks down to nothing  I left it out, as well as the carrots.  Knowing the thighs would cook down to smaller pieces, I doubled the number and it turned out well.  5 hours on high is too long, ours was ready at 4 hours.  My wife and I totally enjoyed this dish and will make it again, and again!

Absolutely delicious! I always add spice to every dish I make, so I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper (nothing crazy) but this dish is so flavourful I would enjoy it without. Will be making this again!

Bombastic! So flavourful and aromatic! 

I did not have a slow cooker, but pre prepared all ingredients before putting them in the big pot. Fried the onions, fresh garlic and fresh ginger). Fried thin slices of carrot separately. 

I highly recommend adding cashew nuts! They blend in amazingly!

Although spicy, this wasn't too bad. Instead of thighs, I've did cubed chicken breast. It came out pretty good over couscous.  I loved the dried cranberries and the apricots to the mixture.  I would make it again.

Very tasty recipe,  I added cubed yams on bottom of slow cooker and included diced apples and cayenne pepper into recipe. Make sure to not cut the chicken up into small pieces as it will ‘become lost’ in the bottom, I used chicken breasts cut into large chunks.

Flavorful and easy to make. I used boneless chicken breast but would probably use thighs next time the meat got a little dry.

Personally, I found this too sweet.  If I make it again I'd make it with less apricots, some hot spices and a crunch of peanut or cashew.

I made this for a party we were hosting for a guest from Tanzania. I had never make it before, so was crossing my fingers, and trusting the reviews! It came out great; everyone liked it. I made a double recipe and cooked for about 5 hours on high, then switched to low for another hour or so before serving. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that I thought it was a little too sweet. For that reason, I would leave out the craisins. I used half sweet potatoes and half carrots. I left peel on the Eggplant, and put it on the top, rather than with the chicken on the bottom. I did pre-saute the chicken, because thighs can be fatty even without the skin, and I wanted to cook a little of that off. Also sauteed the onions briefly before adding. I added a little cayenne for a bit of heat. It did take quite a bit of time to chop everything, precook the chicken, and also to put together the broth--well over an hour. So plan on that--this isn't a quick, throw everything in recipe.   Friends asked for the recipe, and I'll pass it on!

My family of 7 really loved it!!! (My husband & our five kids: Ages 16- 2 years.) Made as is...its excellent! I did throw other things in it, to accommodate what we had on hand :) From reading the other reviews, I kept the onion the same, (2 TBS minced garlic) doubled the seasonings, (adding 1 TBs of HOT mexican chili powder) and added drained and rinsed can of yams, chick peas, and 1 lb of canned chicken, as well as 2 lbs boneless chicken tenders.  I served with whole wheat couscous; pan fried in garlic, olive oil, and one onion...(followed the rest of package directions) and garlic French bread. (Didnt have naan or flat bread) This is a GREAT recipe as is, or depending on tastes, and preferences! (Through the hundreds of recipes I tried on here, this is my first one rating!) Thank you!!!

Awesome!  I served 10 people and had leftovers by using chicken breasts (5lbs) instead of thighs. I also made it work for Passover by subbing matzoh cake meal for flour and quinoa for the couscous. Guests are asking for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it was fairly good, but lacked a special punch.  Not sure just what is missing,  more spices?  Certainly not more cinnamon.  Not sure if I'll make it again  unless I figure out what is missing.
Update:  I put some coriander in and it helped.  Now I notice I made the wrong recipe:(:.  I had eliminated this because it didn't look like it had enough spices.  Guess I was right.

This recipe is delicious however I think 2 tsp of garlic salt is too much.  I added one tsp and it didn't need more salt.  Otherwise the spice combination is on point.  I used golden raisins b/c I didn't have dried apricots and another reviewer used sweet potatoes, so I did the same.   This turned out to be a wonderful addition to the meal.   I also added zucchini and mushrooms.

Very tasty dish full of flavor.  I used whole chicken things (browned in pan) and also made sure I browned the chopped onions as well just to give them more caramelization.  I used fresh chopped garlic and salt instead of garlic salt.  Its very important not to over cook this dish! You want to still have all the ingredients keep their texture. I set mine on high for about 2.5 hours. You shouldn't need any more than that. 

Tastes amazing the next few days as well.

This was good and easy. Very heavy on the cinnamon flavor though. However, as it is such a fruity and spice-filled main, I could tell my husband didn't care for it, and I can think of dozens of recipes I'd repeat before this. This is definitely not a dish everyone will like, but I can see it appealing to those that like these types of spices in their meals.

My husband and I both loved it! Instead of cubing the chicken thighs, I just browned them whole and put them on the bottom of the slow cooker. I added a couple dashes of hot Hungarian paprika and a splash of my favorite hot sauce (El Yucateco) to the sauce since other reviews said it needed some heat. My husband said it was restaurant quality and wants it added to the weekly rotation! Great recipe!

I've made some tagines before, but never one in a slow cooker. This was terrific. I used turkey breasts since that's what I had; they were a bit dry, but still delicious. The eggplant was a great addition - even my eggplant haters enjoyed it (at least until I told them what it was). This is a keeper.

I made it exactly by the recipe and it is beyond delicious. There was a fairly large amount of it so I served it with couscous infused with tomato paste one night and with sticky rice the next night.

It would have been 10 stars if I had been able to add the eggplant, but I had to leave it out due to food allergies.  Even without it, this was a supremely tasty dinner. I didn't have any ground cinnamon, so I tossed in two 3" sticks, and the flavor came through fine. It might have even been better that way, since ground cinnamon can make the liquid parts of a dish a bit ropey if it's allowed to boil.  I can't speak for the authenticity of this, but the chicken and spices and dried fruit were simply to die for.  Everyone in my family loved it, even my picky husband. I served it over couscous to soak up the juices, with a simply dressed cucumber, tomato, and parsley salad on the side. I had planned to make an orange salad too, but I forgot and nobody missed it. They all went back for more of the tagine.

Best crock-pot dish EVER!!!  This has been a staple for our family for the past 5 years.  When my son was a baby, I used to even puree it for him so he could enjoy all the flavor too :)

Delicious! My wife doesn't like couscous, so I served it with Jasmine rice, which worked fine. The next time, I won't include eggplant; I don't think it went well with this.

It was delicious. I made it in my pressure cooker and it took about 30 minutes of cook time. I omitted the chicken broth and used an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce, no tomato paste, cornstarch instead of flour and prunes, I didn't have the apricots. I made half of the recipe.

It was delicious even without a little kick to it though. I left out the eggplant and cooked on high for about 2 hours and then turned down to low for another 3.5 hours. Also, there's no need for carrots to cook that long so I didn't add them in until a couple of hours after the chicken had been cooking. They turned out perfect and the chicken was very tender. I served the dish with mashed potatoes instead of rice.

This was excellent.  The carrots came out perfectly.  I was most surprised that it didn't have an odd taste considering the use of apricots and cranberries.  It was on the border of being too sweet so next time I may adjust and perhaps even add something to make it a bit spicy.  I served it over curry rice so not so traditional Morocco but my style.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent!  Couple of changes I made:  instead of cranberries, I added leftover dried pomegranate seeds (seemed more appropriate) and left about 1/2 of the water out.  Also reduced carrots to 2. And added some chili powder to the slurry.  YUMMMMM!

My daughter spent a little time in Mooraco, and had been bugging me for this. This recipe came out great, I had the advantage of using a real Tajine pot to cook it in. However, the slow cooker will work fine. Serve with pleanty of flat bread.

I did sub squash for eggplant but otherwise followed exactly. I don't know what went wrong..the ginger was overpowering.

I loved this.  Added a little hot sauce and used golden raisins instead of cranberries because that is what I had.

Haven't tried this PARTICULAR recipe, but cut out a similar one from Family Circle magazine and trying to eliminate these random papers and find recipes on this site.  This dish is delish, even husband liked though I didn't add the dried fruit to the entire recipe, just my own plate.  Served over couscous.

If you're looking for something different, this is definitely worth a try!  I followed the recipe as directed except I did not brown the chicken and eggplant first, just tossed it in raw and it turned out fine.  Like other reviewers, I found the eggplant didn't hold up well in the slowcooker.  Will be making again, just substituting the eggplant with squash or cauliflower maybe.  The sauce seems a bit thin, but resist the urge to thicken it, the couscous absorbs it nicely.

I give this a 5 star.  For being the 1st time trying a morrocan meal, this was great.  At the last minutes a friend came over and she couldn't believe how good this was.  I recommend it.  And ladies if your husbands like trying different meals, they will be impressed.

No eggplant - 1/2 bag peas instead. Needs more kick, cayanne? Try turmeric. Made with chicken breast - too dry. 9.5 hrs on low.

Sorry but my family barely did anything with it.  Personally, I thought it was OK but was very disappointed.  I hope others will try it and possibly do a custom version.  As you know, if my family won't eat it, I won't be making it again.

This sounds better than it actually is, in my opinion. Truthfully, I found it to be on the bland side, even after adding a dash or two of cayenne to give it some zing. Something's missing that would make the dish score a hit with my palate, and I'm not interested enough to experiment with this dish to try and find out what the missing element could be.

This was very tasty.  I didn't have apricots, so used prunes instead.  I didn't do anything with the chicken breasts or eggplant beforehand -- just put them in the crockpot uncooked like everything else.

Oh my goodness, this was incredible.  I've made it two weeks in a row, which is unheard of in our house! I cut down on the chicken a bit, and added extra carrots.  I bet you could even cut the chicken out completely and it would still be really good.

It turned out very well.  I skipped the ST step and placed frozen chicken breasts, and cubed eggplant directly into the slow cooker.  This is the ST time I have ever eaten eggplant.  Not sure if it adds a whole lot to the dish because it seemed somewhat flavorless.  I also used frozen sliced carrots instead of fresh carrots.   I would like to give this dish a 4.5/5 because it is pretty flawless, but not a mind blowing 5/5. Will make again.

I made this dish without any ingredient modifications. This was delicious. My husband however thought it was just "ok". Three hours tops on high in our crockpot was long enough cooking time. Any longer and the carrots would have been mushy.

Too strong in the spice department for my family.  I'll try 1/2ing the spices next time because it did have a unique flavor we all enjoyed.  I didn't like the fruits, and I added the eggplant at the end like someone else suggested.

Very tasty. I modified as shelteredrose suggested and used butternut squash instead of eggplant. I only cooked it for 3 hrs on high, and that was plenty of time. My only complaint is that it was a tad too sweet for my taste as is (not sure if that might be the butternut squash?). I've had Moroccan cuisine before - nothing was ever this sweet. But it could just be that I've never had this dish. I ended up adding more lemon juice and salt near the end to cut back on the sweetness.  Next time I may try with eggplant and see if that makes a difference, or a bit less fruit and/or cinnamon. Overall though, it was very good and I'll make it again!

This was a good recipe if you are wanting to try something different!  Beware of the eggplant getting a little mushy.  I used baby carrots instead of large carrots and it seemed to be just fine, if that is what you have in your fridge.  :)  This is perfect with couscous on the side too!

I have been an allrecipe user for many years and this is the first time that I have had to give a negative review of a recipe. Outside of changing cranberries to golden raisins,  I followed the recipe as written. The taste was so bad that I will not be saving the leftovers. I don't know if it was the combination of spices or what, but it was not tasty.

Tasty.  Not my usual style but I needed a recipe without tomatoes so I made this and just omitted the tomato paste.  Made it later with the tomato paste and couldn't tell the difference.  I might play a bit more with the spices if I make it again but overall it's good!

We really liked this recipe, with some changes. My husband dislikes eggplant, so we cut it out and didn't miss it. We try to eat mostly vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth and exchanged a big garnet yam for the chicken. Delicious!! The yam made it for sure - coming across a nice soft bite of yam was like finding a treasure! I also forgot to get apricots and used golden raisins instead, which plumped up really nice. I would recommend increasing the volume of broth until the layers are covered, or the top dries out. Also, 1 cup of couscous is barely enough for two people, so double it.

i am a beginner, so i followed the recipe almost exactly.  (crock pot 6 hours low, fridge a couple hours, crock pot low 2 hours - maybe not a good idea.)    it was ok.  where was the exotic?  i didnt taste it.  consider breast meat as the sweetness of the dish maybe gets a bit much w dark meat?    i think a little pepper flake for spice would have been a great move.  dont skip the couscous.

LOVED this!  The smells were incredible when I got home from work.  I did not precook the chicken.  I didn't have apricots on hand but used cranberries and raisins.  Also didn't have eggplant but put in mushrooms.  Thickened up the sauce a little at the end with a roux.  Awesome!!

Different flavors but good.  The apricots and cranberries add a lot.  I used frozen chicken breasts and shredded them in the last 30 minutes.  I used sweet potatoes instead of eggplant.  Served over Couscous this is a different and good dinner.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did add some hot pepper flakes to add a bit of spice.  I don't think I had enough onions or carrots, but the recipe turned out great.  This is a definite repeat for us.

This was a nice dish, though the flavor can be a bit overwhelming--the dried fruit became very syrupy and mushy and the dish was more gooey than I expected, but the flavoring is exotic and goes really well with the couscous.

I made this over the weekend and used 1/2 thighs and 1/2 breasts to cut down on the fat.  I don't care for couscous so I added yams to the recipe to make it a bit heartier and it worked out great. I would make this again for sure!

We loved it.  We used brown basmatti rice because we did not have couscous.  Garlic powder because we did not have garlic salt.
