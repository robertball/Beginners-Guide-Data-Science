I used homemade roasted garlic and I doubled the dill weed because I used dried instead of fresh. This is INCREDIBLE. I cannot stop eating it. NOTE: For homemade roasted garlic, what I do is peel the outer layers of the garlic bulb leaving the bulb intact, place the bulb in a smallish oven-safe bowl (or a 6-cup muffin tin if you do it in bulk, like I do) drizzle with EVOO and cover with aluminum foil. Then, just bake for a half hour or so until the cloves are softened. Wa-la, roasted garlic. Also, if you do not have cheesecloth, you can drain your yogurt in layers of coffee filters in a colander.

This recipe is GREAT I did the entire thing in the food processor started with the cucumber so I could remove and drain them and followed previous reviews reducing the garlic down to one clove.  Good olive oil and fresh squeezed lemon juice are a must.  A quick update, Greek style yogurt can be substituted for the drained yogurt it saves a LOT of time and is now available in most major supermarkets!

This was awesome. It is a bit time consuming but only because you have to let the yougurt drain for a few hours. After that is ready, it's easy and very tasty. The recipe asked for lemon juice but the directions said vinegar. I just used the lemon juice. I dipped pita bread into it as a snack or appetizer, it's great. My Middle Eastern friend's family eats this frequently and he said mine turned out great.

This is the first time I've tried making tzatziki, so I can't compare this to other similiar recipes.  However, while I liked the dip, we were overwhelmed by the garlic even though I used much less than called for in the recipe.  Let's just say that I had to avoid breathing on anyone for about 24 hours!  Next time I'll use a single clove of garlic and see if that works.

I didn't have cucumber on hand, so threw in a spoonful of sweet relish. The other ingredients masked most of the flavor of that, but all in all turned out to be a very good homemade tzatziki. I didnt drain the yogurt, too time consuming, and diced a little onion (very fine) into it as well. Turned out very good!

This was pretty good, although I think vinegar was left out of the ingredients. It seems like there is a flavor missing.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I made 1/2 of a recipe to go with gyros I was making and we had plenty.  I started out with Greek yogurt which I think is slightly thicker than regular yogurt.  I only had time to drain it about 45 minutes.  I shredded the cuc's and let them drain about 30 minutes.  The recipe doesn't call for this step but I think it gave me a better result and I was concurrently  waiting for the yogurt to drain. When I put it all together I was very happy with the consistency.  It was the perfect thickness and tasted just like what is served in Greek restaurants.

Making a half recipe, I drained  the 16 oz. of yogurt over night using a clean nylon stocking, and got nearly a cup of liquid out. Dry dill weed works well also. This is what I was hoping and looking for.

I entertain frequently and this recipe was a big hit during our Olympic parties.  Although time consuming, draining the yogurt really makes a difference.

This was my first time making this, but I chose this recipe from the others because I thought it would be a better consistency and I'm not a fan of mint.  It came out great.  Just like my favorite greek restaurant.  I'm making it again tonight.  I think draining the yogurt is essential for the correct texture. By the way...I made it with low-fat yogurt and nobody could tell

I made half a recipe and just used 2 cloves of garlic - way to strong.  I'm wondering if the original recipe meant to say 1 clove instead of 1 head.  I love garlic, but it was overpowering and bitey in this recipe, which is usually on the cool side.  Otherwise, the recipe was great.  BTW, its essential to drain the yogurt (I used low-fat) and to press the cucumbers.

So good! I did blend it through a blender because I thought shreds of cucumber in this would be weird...but the flavour is so good and so garlicky. Love it!!! First time I ever made tzatziki and now I know how easy and good it is.Thanks!

Delicious and refreshing! I made a couple changes so I wouldn't have to make another trip to the grocery store: I made 1/4 of the recipe using sour cream instead of yogurt, garlic granules instead of fresh garlic, and dried dill instead of fresh. It was creamy and tasty. I will NEVER buy pre-made tzatziki again!!!

This tastes like the Tzatziki you'd have at a Greek restaurant.  I did modify it slightly by adding minced onion (but only because I like onions not because the recipe was lacking.)  Good stuff.

Greek yogurt which is now available in most grocery stores,  eliminates the need for straining the yogurt.  I used a high fat Cabot's brand.  I added some chopped fresh dill as well.  I used a cheese grater for shredding and a grapefruit spoon for the seeding.   This was by far the best Tzatziki that I have ever eaten.  It was very thick and creamy.

This tzatziki was fantastic.  We actually like ours a little runny, so after I drained the initial batch of yogurt, I added some undrained yogurt back in.  Substituted some garlic salt for part of the garlic.  One thing is essential, though:  THE FLAVORS MUST BLEND.  This was not that great initially, just after everything was mixed.  A couple of days in the fridge, delicious.

Maybe this is just personal preference, but I found this recipe came out runny and even after adding some extra garlic it didn't have as much flavour as typical tzatziki has.

I didn't have fresh garlic so I had to use garlic powder (about two teaspoons) and I had dried dill, I used almost a tablespoon. I used fresh ground pepper and a dash of salt. I drained the yoghurt for over twenty four hours (in a seive lined with coffee filters), and really squeezed out the cucumbers - first in my bare hands, then again in coffee filters just to get every little bit of moisture. It turned out amazing, very tangy. It's not quite as thick as I'd like, but I'll see how it is after sitting in the fridge overnight. I'm just glad to know I can make my own tzatziki now!

This was good, but there was something missing.  I'm not sure what it was, but it's not my favorite tzatziki recipe.  We used it with Greek Turkey burgers and it was good with those.

Went perfect with the gyros that I made.  My first time making it and it turned out just like I've had in restaurants.  I used dried dill because it was all I had on hand, but still tasted wonderful.

This is my favorite recipe for tzatziti. I have made it like this about 10 times. I will say I only use a clove of garlic. I dont know if he meant a head or clove but a clove is plenty for me. I only add a few tablespoons of olive oil depending on how long I have drained yogurt.

4 stars because of two things. I don't think most folks will appreciate a whole head of garlic in this or so much lemon. I mixed this with a 16 oz container thick "Greek" yogurt, 3 cloves crushed garlic sauteed in 1 tblsp Olive oil. 1 tsp fresh lemon juice, a sprinkle of dried oregano and 1/2 tsp of dry dill. I did twist my (seeded) grated cucumber in a tea towel (to get rid of excess moisture) before incorporating. Also a tsp of honey will tone down excessive tart flavor (matter of pref). A little ground sea salt & fresh pepper is all that's needed as well. Very good w/out so much garlic/oil/lemon juice. For me anyway :) Tastes better after storing overnight in fridge. I utilize my own homemade baked pita chips (use quality pita bread) to dip in this...yum!

This tzatziki recipe comes closest to the best tzatziki we tasted while visiting Greece. Please note that it should call for one CLOVE of garlic, not an entire head of garlic! Also, we like to put a LOT more fresh dill in.

This was great on gyros! Made a much smaller portion with a standard small plain yogurt and one cucumber. Skipped the dill. Added McCormick Greek Seasoning. Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours beforehand. Used with chicken seasoned with the same Greek Seasoning in pitas w/feta, lett, tom, etc. Yum! This is my new staple recipe. Thanks!

This recipe is great.  I used greek yogurt so I didn't strain it.  I did drain the cukes.  But then I just mixed together all the ingredients - I didn't whisk.  I popped it in the fridge for an hour or 2 before dinner and it was delicious!

I'm sorry, but I just didn't like this recipe. I've had tzatziki in restaurants several times and loved it, but this was not even close. I think the lemon and garlic measurements are way off. I tried adding sugar to take off the bite, but the batch I made was not even salvageable.

This was wonderful!  I took the advice of another reviewer and strained the yogurt in two coffee filters overnight in a strainer.  Worked perfectly.  I used a little less garlic and a little mroe dill.  Highly adaptable to suit everyone's tastes.   Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe but watch out for the amounts of spices.  An entire head of garlic?  Seems like an obvious error, but those who suggest a single clove are using too little.  I prefer a bolder taste.  I used four cloves of garlic, also added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, and a tablespoon or so of fresh chopped dill.  This provides a much bolder flavor; the base recipe is quite mild by my standard.  I have found that the "name brand" plain yogurt tends to be less runny than the generic store brand and is more cost effective than greek yogurt.

Halved the yogurt, but it still made plenty (didn't have enough time to drain, so it was a bit runny, but still scrumptious!) Added 2 shredded Persian cucumbers (fewer seeds, more flavor), about 6 cloves garlic and the juice from one lemon. Delicious!

AMAZING!!!

This was soo tasty. Better than store bought. We didn't have cheese cloth so we just drained it as best we could with paper towels. Next, we put the cucumber in a blender and pureed it. We also used vegetable for a lack of olive oil and to make it more budget friendly. We only give this a 4 because we think blending the cucumber made such a difference!

Oh this is so good!  Straining the yogurt created a beautiful texture and I just used a clean pantyhose foot for it.  Tasted better the next day when the garlic taste really came out.

This was a hit on New Year's Eve.  My friends and I did a Greek-theme dinner and I was responsible for appetizers.  This was everybody's favorite.  I used english cukes and only one clove of garlic.  Make sure you strain the cukes in addition to the yogurt.  Yummy with flatbread and veggies.

Everyone else eating this liked it way better than I did. Just didn't have the same taste I am used to from my favorite Greek restaurant. I did add some extra dill and garlic and that improved the taste but it was just missing something for me.

It was good, but it did NOT taste like the kind I had when I visited Greece & Turkey.

I made this last night for a get together and everyone loved it. I was nervous the kids wouldn't like it, but they definetely did. I didn't put in as much garlic and put in more dill. Delish:)

Delicious!  Just like the sauce at a Greek restaurant.  This was perfect paired with the Gyros Burgers recipe.  Thanks!
