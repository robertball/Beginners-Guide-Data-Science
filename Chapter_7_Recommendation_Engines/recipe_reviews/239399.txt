made this for a cook out. for some reason it tasted way better warm before we put it in the fridge for a few hours. My wife kept picking at it, I had to tell her to stop! She isn't even a big fan of potato salad. Also next time I make it I will add more chipotle hot sauce, we could only find Cholula brand. The flavor was great but I would have liked more of the flavor and spiciness from the hot sauce. Overall an awesome potato salad.

This potato salad is incredible! I doubled the batch to make enough for 8-10 people.
