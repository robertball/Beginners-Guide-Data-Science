If I could have given this 3.5 stars, I would have.  It isn't the best recipe I've made from allrecipes.com, but it's also not the worst.  I halved the recipe, since there's only the two of us and our 20 month old to feed.  I added a little bit of fresh minced garlic in with the onions, and used Adobo in place of the salt and pepper.  Because one of the reviewers wrote that the chicken they made had a bitter taste to it, I added the zest from the half the orange I juiced instead of adding the lime peel (which I'm guessing was what caused the bitterness).  I might make this again - it did come out moist, and the flavor is fine, but the onions just get cooked translucent - they don't brown at all in the bottom of the dish while it's cooking.  Maybe next time I'll try browning them separately and adding them to the dish once the chicken is cooked.

I did not like this recipe.  Maybe it was just my lime, but the chicken came out REALLY bitter tasting.  The cumin and bitterness completely overpower all the rest of the flavors.  I gave it a 2 because thankfully, the bitterness stayed mostly in the liquid, so I can still eat it the chicken, perhaps made into a chicken salad of some type or on top of salad greens with a sweeter dressing.

The chicken tasted fine, but I didn't get the citrus flavor.

I made exactly according to the recipe.  We loved this!  I did zest the orange and the lime on top of the chicken before baking.  The seasonings were wonderful, and both the skin and meat had excellent flavor. I would recommend brushing a little bit of olive oil on the chicken before seasoning, so it crisps up and browns a bit more in the oven. The onions were transluscent, we did not end up eating them, but they added great flavor to the chicken while baking. We will be having this again.

Had the chicken with rice but it came out very bitter tasting. Not good to eat by itself. I used the chicken for a salad the next day.
