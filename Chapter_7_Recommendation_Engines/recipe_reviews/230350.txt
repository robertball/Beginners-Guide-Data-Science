Tasty. Very easy to make. I cut the recipe down for just me and hubby. And instead of sugar I used chocolate syrup. Also used more coffee than called for. I wanted a stronger coffee flavor.

I am trying it for the first time but think I will be adding more coffee to it.  I also used a 1/3 less sugar and its still SWEET.  Add it little by little for your taste.  Over all it's good and ill make it again.

I scaled this recipe to 2 servings and it was the perfect amount for 1 serving. I substituted International Delight Sugar Free Vanilla Coffee Creamer for the heavy whipping cream. I also left out the sugar. I loved it! And the perfect coffee drink to cool you off. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I cut this recipe down to 2 servings (which turned out to be only 1). I am trying to decide as I write this how many stars to give it. I was expecting the coffee flavor to be much too diluted with the half and half, but it's not. I also expected it to be way too sweet, which it is. But the more I drink, the more I love this!  It's certainly not a morning coffee substitute for me, but it does make a very nice dessert type treat, or as the submitter suggested, a punch for a shower or tea.
