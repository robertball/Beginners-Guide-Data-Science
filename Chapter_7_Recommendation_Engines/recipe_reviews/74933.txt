Wow! Simple and quick to put together--I used fresh veggies from my garden, and added a little Hungarian hot smoked paprika! Spicy, flavorful, and delicious!!!  A keeper!!!

We thought this was just okay.  I think it would have been significantly better with Italian sausage instead of ground pork.  Sorry, but not a keeper for me.

Tasty, quick and easy. I used a dash of red pepper flakes instead of fresh pepper, and it came out great, with just the right amount of spice. Oh, and I served it with garlic bread hot from the oven! Definitely a keeper!

This was a very good recipe, I made two different batches and substituted mushrooms in place of the peppers and both turned out exellent.  I added some crushed tomato's, and a dash of chili powder, and it turned out wonderful.

This has become a go to dish in our family. Easy fun and great tasting. We have made it on the grill and and gatherings it is one of the first to go.
