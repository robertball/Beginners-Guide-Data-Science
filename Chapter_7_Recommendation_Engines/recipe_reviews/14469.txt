When I saw this recipe's ingredients, I wondered what the fuss was about. Today, as I eat yesterday's wilted leftovers from a Tupperware container at 9am in the morning, I thought I'd write a review! I make this salad all the time now. I use spinach and other greens. I use toasted (10 minutes in 350 oven - no butter) pine nuts now insead of the almonds and will never go back - they are perfect for this salad. I add one container of blue cheese (a must for us - perfect blend of flavors). I use one 6 oz package Craisins. I've never used the poppy seeds - but the toasted sesame seeds (also at 350 for 10 minutes) are a must. I may or may not use dried minced onion.  Toss all dressing ingredients in a container with a lid - and shake! This salad has been a hit with everyone I've served it to - dinner party, Easter lunch, dinner at home. It is so easy and easy to transport, too - just add the dressing once you get to where you're going. Try it - I bet you'll love it!!

WOW! AWESOME! TIME saver tips: use Paul Newman's balsamic vinagrette instead of making your own dressing. MONEY saving tip: use "Craisins" dried cranberry fruit instead of regular dried cranberries.  Use can of mandarin oranges instead of poppy seeds. THIS WAS A HIT!

Wow, fantastic! I used Craisins and only 1/4 cup sugar. I also used light olive oil instead of vegetable and toasted the sesame seeds and almonds in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes to cut out the butter. Added gorganzola cheese and it was gobbled up at a potluck - they pratically licked the bowl! Thanks for the great recipe.

Great recipe - very festive and quite tasty.  Even non-salad eaters liked this one.  I stuck to the recipe and was very happy with it.  

(I never understand when someone rates a recipe that they make significant changes to - please rate the recipe as is!  If your changes are fabulous, submit the recipe on its own and then let us try it and review.  Okay, I'm off my soapbox now.)

I'm sure this salad was delicious, but I couldn't bring myself to make it as published, instead dressing it with something far less sweet.  Since the sugar content isn't part of the nutritional info, you might find it enlightening to know that it contains a whopping 174 g (that's a full cup's worth) of sugar, or 2T per serving, assuming you used sweetened dried cranberries. If you managed to find unsweetened cranberries, you can reduce that figure to a "mere" 96 grams. Having as much or more sugar than your average cupcake qualifies it as more of a dessert. Because salads are typically thought of as healthy, you should know what your'e getting into with this one! Rating is for recipe as published, not with adjustments.

I have made this about 4 times.  Each and every time, someone asks for the recipe.  This is a delicious and especially pretty at Christmas time with the green leafy spinach and red dried cranberries. Dried cranberries are very expensive when purchased in the grocery store.  Buying a large quantity at Costco, Sams Club, etc saves money on this item; and the cranberries keep for so long on the shelf. Easy to make!  Toasting the almonds is crucial for flavor  - don't miss that step.

This salad really is as great as everyone says, although I used a different dressing...  Try pureeing a cup of raspberries (frozen ones are fine!) with a tablespoon of sugar, 1/2 cup of peanut oil, a teaspoon of poppy seeds, and 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar for a light, fruity dressing.  I also substituted walnuts for the almonds and added a good bit of feta cheese.  (I never can stick to a recipe-- I can't help but personalize!)  Overall, this is a GOOD salad!

Absolutely delicious! I cut the sugar down to one tablespoon, and it was fine! I found the almonds to be too greasy, so the second time I made it I toasted them in a dry pan, and they tasted much better.

HELPFUL TIP REGARDING DRESSING: I love this salad & salad dressing.  The longer it marinates, the better it tastes.  Problem is, the dressing doesn't last long, & we never use even half of it since it's only a family of 4.  So, I make this salad using a dressing I found from another spinach cranberry recipe on here that has a 5* rating.  I keep it in a lock n lock, & it's good for weeks (esp if you're like me & use milk that doesn't expire until a month later)!  Mix 1/2C mayo, 2T white WINE vinegar, 1/4C milk, and before you serve your salad ...add sesame seeds and/or poppy seeds.  It's delicious & no one can taste the mayo, & they SWEAR it's better than any ranch! Very gourmet AND don't be afraid of the mayo ...it calls for that much b/c it makes almost a bottle size amount (that again stays good forever).  To the salad, I like adding fresh sliced strawberries, dried blueberries OR mandarin oranges with the cranberries. Also adding a sprinkle of sunflower seeds gives it a nice crunch!  I sprinkle some almond accents on as well (seasoned almonds found next to salad bags).  Perfect with any meal and always a hit!

I have a recipe similar to this one but with fresh sliced strawberries instead of dried cranberries and also goat cheese (chevre).  So good!  Also, I save time and excess fat by just toasting the nuts in the microwave.  Put on a paper plate for 30 sec.  Move around and cook for another 20 sec.  So good!

O.K one more person to rave about this salad.  Next time I will use one half the oil and sub olive oil for the vegetable oil.  I used roasted, salted pecans, toasted the sesame seeds and used bagged spinach (cut down on time).  You could cut down on the sugar also as the cranberries add the sweetness.  Be sure to use a pound of spinach or you will have plenty of dressing left over.  Diabetics could use sevin or splenda in the place of sugar.  Beautiful, attractive salad used a cobalt blue bowl for a bold presentation.

This is the recipe that got me hooked on allrecipes. I have made it for years now, and have tried an infinite variety of versions. 

I settled on adding chicken, sesame oil, mandarin oranges, and skipping the poppy seeds. Don't worry, I'm rating the original recipe, not my modifications. It is all good, both the original and just about any substitutions that you care to make, including lettuce for spinach (if you have to).

The dressing is key, just keep the 1:1:1 ratio of sugar, oil, and vinegar and you can't go wrong.

Very addictive recipe.  Everyone requests this when they come over for dinner.  For an over the top salad, I add thinly sliced chilled pears and goat or feta cheese before serving.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Jamie!

good recipie.  I cut this recipe in 1/2 because I would be the only one eating it.  I didn't toss everything together.   I toasted the seeds and almonds - a must.  I added fresh green onion instead of jar.  I cut the sugar in 1/2 and tried some stevia (natural sugar-no carbs).  I didn't use the poppy seeds, but some manderin oranges.  I think I would have liked to add some more green onion and some crunchy chinese noodles next time

Absolutely delicious!  I skip the butter and poppy seeds, and add glazed walnuts, hard boiled eggs and bacon.  I also usually use purple onion instead of white or brown.  I always get a ton of compliments and have memorized the recipie since I'm always asked to pass it on!  Thanks!

Fabulous salad. It is sweet so I gave it a little balance with crumbled bacon.  It is good with or without the addition of bacon...just be mindful that you don't have too much sweetness in the rest of your meal. The salad will really shine if you avoid total sugar overload. This is a KEEPER!!!!

I just finished my 3rd bowl of this salad! I am supposed to take this to a baby shower tomorrow, I hope I have enough!!It is so good, just as everyone else has said! I followed the recipe pretty closely, except for reducing the amount of white sugar as others have recommended, the dressing is delicious! I also added dried raspberries (I had them in the cupboard) and sliced red onion. Instead of using butter, I dry toasted the almonds in the oven. I did use the sesame seeds & poppy seeds (you may not be able to taste the poppy seeds, but I love the look of them in the dressing!) I bagged the almonds, craisens, and red onion in ziplocs, put the spinich in a huge bowl, the dressing in a jar & I plan on assembling this salad at the shower so it does not wilt. This is one of the best salads I've had in a long time, I can't wait to have people over to make it again!

I have gotten more compliments on this salad then anything I've ever made! The flavors are just wonderful, and the buttered almonds with dried cranberries definately makes the salad. I leave out the onions in the dressing, and use red wine vinegar instead of white.  I also don't put the sesame seeds and poppy seeds in the dressing because they always stick to the dressing container and I lose half of them. I just sprinkle them on the salad now.  I will be making this many, many, many more times!!! :)

I have been making something similar for about 20 years, but I use fresh strawberries instead of craisins and I do not put poppy seeds in the dressing!  DO NOT cheat yourself out of experiencing the fabulous dressing...it's what makes the salad and is far superior to anything store bought!  I make mine in the food processor and add the toasted seasame seeds to the spinach, strawberries & almonds in the bowl, not to the dressing.  Pulse the vinegar, sugar, onion, and paprika a few times to combine. Flip the switch to "on" and drizzle the oil through the hopper on top of the food processor. This emulsifies the dressing and gives it a bit of a "creamy" look.  I use canola oil instead of veg. oil and also like to add a little bit of white pepper.  This salad is an all time favorite and great for special occasions. Everyone loves it and you will get MANY recipie requests!  Enjoy!  :-)

Another great salad.  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil with 1/4 c sugar.  It was fine with only poppy seeds,  since I didn't have the sesame seeds. I also used red wine and cider vinegar, but next time I'll try to have white vinegar on hand.

Very nice salad.  We liked it with our Thanksgiving dinner bcuse it was light and tasty.  I doubled it for 15 people but didn't even use a quarter of the spinach.  Fortunely, I didn't put the dressing on it.  Due to all the food alergies in my family,  I just served the dressing on the side.  p.s.: this recipe will make more than 8 servings if served with a big meal.

It is the dressing that makes this good, but I don't think it is amazing.  Still it gets 5 stars because both my husband and MIL commented on it and asked for seconds.  Next time I make it though I'll use 1/2 as much almonds.  Also, I did make it with dried Cherries and not Cranberries since my hubby doesn't like them.  It was a good substitution.

This is an amazing salad.  My girlfriends and I have a "girls" night every other month.  They all loved this salad!  My husband couldn't get enough of the leftovers!  It's now one of his favorites!

I just have to say that those who did not make the dressing are completely missing the point.  Without this amazing dressing, it's just a regular salad.  Spinach, cranberries, almonds, boring!  Don't waste your time making this if you aren't going to make it as written, cause it's really the best salad I've ever had.

This salad is absolutely yummy, although I did make a few changes.  I found the dressing a little on the sweet side, so I decreased the sugar by 1/4 c.  I also decreased the vinegar a little and only used white wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  I used white onion, but I think red would give it a bit more color and taste great too.  Now for the goodies... I added about 1 1/2 c sliced fresh organic strawberries (this was the best thing ever), and also some cooked crumbled bacon and cubed avocado.  Instead of cooking the almonds in butter, I just spread them on a baking sheet and baked them dry at 400 degrees for 5-8 min, watching to make sure they didn't burn.  This helps reduce some of the fat, and they still tasted great.  I cooled the almonds a little before adding them so that they wouldn't make the spinach wilt.  Next time I'll also add some crumbled ramen noodles, because I love all the crunchies.  All in all, this was a terrific recipe!  If you were to add anything, I would highly recommend the strawberries - they were awesome.  Thanks, Jamie!

This is very good but a tad on the sweet side.  This recipe makes A LOT, probably feeds closer to 12 people so I would recommend making for a larger crowd since it doesn't keep very well.

I brought this to a Labor Day Weekend BBQ and everybody (about 12 people) raved about the salad.  Not one leaf of spinach was left in the bowl!  

I did make some adjustments to the recipe:  Added about a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce for an added kick and toasted the sesame seeds before adding them to the dressing for a nuttier flavor. Didn't have poppy seeds on hand, so I left them out.  Finally, I used fresh sliced strawberries instead of the cranberries (mostly because they were in season and very inexpensive).  The dressing was delicious, but I was careful to add it  to taste.  Even though we served this salad to 12 people, we had quite a bit of leftover dressing which I plan on using again tonight.

I will definitely make this recipe again and will try it with the dried cranberries when strawberries aren't in season.  Very tasty and a great change from a standard green or spinach salad.  Yum!

Loved it!  Took it to our Thanksgiving dinner this year and my father wanted the recipe as soon as possible. That told me how great it was.  I made it exactly as directed except for toasting the sesame seeds in the oven (350 degrees/10 minutes) and also toasted the sliced almonds in the oven the same temp/time. I mentioned that he could add mandarin oranges, or feta cheese, or pine nuts, etc.  This is one recipe you can truly be creative with and not go wrong. One thing I won't do next time is toss the baby spinach, toasted nuts, and dried cranberries the evening before (I had to travel and made everything the night before).  The next day, the spinach was not as fresh as it could have been if I would have just left it in it's original container.  I would recommend not doing a "fix ahead" in this manner.  I did make up the dressing the evening before and it fit nicely in a pint canning jar.  So, if you are traveling with this salad, keep each item in it's original packaging until you arrive at your destination and then toss it all together.  Hope this helps others!

Great salad! I took it to a BBQ and the bowl was empty with many requests for the recipe. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar and used olive oil. I cut down sugar to a little more than 1/3 cup to taste. I omitted the poppy seeds (didn't miss them). I toasted the almonds in the oven without the butter. I also added a package of goat cheese crumbles from the supermarket. Delicious! I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

I loved this salad!  I did add blue cheese crumbles in it the second time I made it and now I don't think it's complete without it, it was a perfect compliment to the flavors. The dressing was super yummy, and it got great reviews at both parties I brought it to.  Definitely make the dressing well beforehand so the flavors have time to meld together, and I toasted the almonds and the sesame seeds in the oven per other's recommendations. 350 for 10 min.  I reduced the sugar the first time I made it, and then did the full amount the second time.  I prefer it with the full amount, I didn't think it was too sweet, it was perfect.  Great recipe, thank you!  I will definitely make this again!  Oh, it is HUGE though, I am sure next time I will half the recipe.

Can I give it SIX stars please?? I have to agree with everyone on this... I have made this so many times now, I can do it with my eyes closed. EVERYONE wants the recipe, and I have NEVER heard a single complaint. I don't change a thing, other than I toast my almonds in a toaster oven with a little butter and salt... I do the same with the sesame seeds. And once in awhile, I use orange-flavored cranberries (Craisins) -- but really, it's the dressing that makes this salad. And I make it exactly as it says to, and it comes out perfect every time. It's a regular thing in our household now! :)

EXCELLENT!!! Substituted spinach with mixture of romaine & mesclun mix. Everyone loved it.  Think it would be just as nice with fresh strawberries instead of dried cranberries.

Very yummy!  I excluded the poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and paprika because I did not have on hand.  Still turned out great.  I did not use all of the dressing (it makes alot)!  Used only about half of it, and stored the rest for another salad.  Topped it with Feta cheese which complements the sweet cranberries.  Very tasty and light!

This salad was so good, and everyone raved over it.  People complimented the dressing.  The one improvement I have made to it in the past is adding feta cheese, which gives that extra powerful flavor.  This is a great dish to serve to guests.  I highly recommend it.  UPDATE:  Pecans make it SO much more flavorful than almonds.  Also, I think the dressing tastes better when you make it a day or two in advance.

Updated: After many (many) times making this, I'm convinced it doesn't matter what add-ins you use as long as you stick with the dressing as listed (oil, both vinegars, sugar, minced onion, and paprika) and the craisins. Personal preference: mixed baby greens, craisins, sunflower kernals, cheese (bleu if I plan enough in advance, cheddar or colby jack if I'm just using what I have in the fridge), and diced grilled chicken (pounded flat and marinated in Yoshida's sweet and savory glaze). I've been eating this for lunch almost every day for the last month and I still can't get enough. I just keep a batch of dressing pre-made in the fridge at all times and can throw together an individual bowl when I want.

Great recipe - everyone loved it. I too cut the sugar in the dressing down to a 1/4 cup and it was perfect. I also toasted the almonds in the oven with the sesame seeds instead of toasting on the stove in butter to cut down on some of the fat grams.

Add me to the long list of fans for this recipe.  I used craisins and like many others cut the sugar in half.  I also added gorgonzola cheese crumbles and blueberries to make it more festive for the 4th of July party that I brought it to.  I was a huge hit.  Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent Salad! Everyone at a recent dinner party loved it and asked for the recipe. I used baby spinach leaves, which are a little more tender, and eliminates having to tear the spinach into pieces. I also added some crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, which compliments the flavor of the salad dressing. Save a little of the cranberries, almonds and cheese, if using, to sprinkle on the top of the salad after tossing for a nice presentation.

I've made this recipe several times and have tried a lot of different ingredients with the same dressing - it turns out awesome every time.  Try fresh strawberries, toasted pine nuts and crumbled gorgonzola cheese.  I've also added candied walnuts and pecans, pears, blue cheese - you name it.  I don't use too much of the dressing, either - just enough for a light coating to bring out the flavor of the other ingredients.

I have been making this salad for about 2 years. I took it to work for a potluck and ever since then, when the potluck list gets passed around, this salad with my name is permanently written on the list. I do change up the greens. I always use spinach, but sometimes its in combination the Spring Mix. FANTASTIC!!!

This salad is amazing! I made it this Thanksgiving and all of my family loved it and asked for the recipe! I did follow one of the reviews and used pine nuts (toasted) in place of almonds. Everyone really enjoyed it. I used spinach that you can buy in a bag that is already washed and cut and made the dressing and toasted the pine nuts the night before. I placed the cranberries and nuts in separate ziploc bags, had the dressing in a plasic drizzle bottle (not sure what the exact name of those are, I bought them at Michaels by the candy making products), and had my bag of spinach. I brought it all to the dinner and threw it together in about 1 minute. Talk about easy. I did find that the recipe for the dressing can be used for two bags of pre-washed, pre-cut spinach.

I've made this salad several times and have emailed the link to the recipe several dozen times.  It is perfect the way it is written, however, I also make it with romaine hearts instead of spinach and it is just as good.  I never thought I would type these words: My kids actually get excited when I make this salad.  By the way, don't pay attention to the reviewers who say to use a bottled dressing instead of making your own.  The dressing IS this salad.  If you put Newman's Own on it, then it's Newman's salad, not Jamie's.  Huge difference.

I made this for a dinner gathering and it all went quickly!  This recipe is a keeper for sure.
I used butter lettuce which was good, but too bulky.  Next time I will use a blend with spinach. 
Also... it is very important to add the dressing just before serving.  I jumped the gun and tossed it in 30 minutes prior to serving and it condensed to 1/2 the size.
Half of the sugar was MORE than plenty.  I also used sweetened dried cranberries.  I wouldn't be able to eat it if it were any sweeter - and I love sweet.
Almonds were toasted dry and I used extra virgin olive oil instead of veg oil.  Glad I did!
Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this salad is DELICIOUS!! I didn't have the cider vinegar or the white wine vinegar... so had to sub with red wine... it worked out ok too. One thing I did to put a spin on it was to toast the almonds in a brown sugar and cinnamon mix. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!

I have been making this salad for a few years.  It's the bomb!  I reduce the sugar and oil a bit and use Almond Accents to save time.  I make it so much I know the recipe by heart.  Love it!
UPDATE:  I have been bringing this salad to family gatherings for a couple of years now.  Out of the goodness of my heart I have shared this recipe with my sister and my sister-in-law and now they both bring the salad to all holidays and gatherings.  So, beware...if you share this recipe with friends and family be prepared for them to do the same to you.

wow, this salad was fantastic.  My boyfriend is a salad guru, makes them as a starter for almost every meal, and he was impressed. I seasoned and grilled chicken breast strips in a skillet and added on top after tossing all of the ingredients together.  I also used less sugar, left off the poppyseeds, added some sun dried tomato feta cheese, and a little bit of olive oil (slightly less vegetable oil).  Will make again and again.  Thanks.

This is got to be the best salad ever!  We eat this salad almost every night.  My children ask for it!  I use a light olive oil instead of the vegetable, and add cucumbers and tomatoes.  For the almond part, I use "Sunkist Almond Accents" in the Honey roasted flavor.  The dressing lasts for over a week in the frig, and it goes a long way.  ABSOULUTLY SPECTACULAR!!

This salad was pretty good, I got positive comments from those that ate it.  I just thought it was very tart.  I think if i make it again I will use a creamy dressing with it and still use the almonds and dried cranberries.

This is a unique way to add cranberries to a holiday meal.  It's so good I made it for a church potluck and several women (and 1 handyman) asked ME (a 25-year-old newlywed) for the recipe!

Hi everyone, this is Jamie.  I just made this again after not making it for about a year.  :)  It's still a hit!  I did half the sugar like most reviewers suggested here and I agree, it makes it better. 
Thanks for making this recipe such a hit on Allrecipes!!!

Oh my goodness!!!  My husband and I have been eating so much spinach--I actually crave this salad:)  I don't use butter, but I use Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and I used toasted, crushed almonds and sometimes I use pine nuts-- both are tasty.

My go-to salad whenever I have a crowd to wow. I find the dressing to be a LOT. The dressing makes the spinach pretty soggy, so pour on very little at a time, mix in well and stop when it looks okay coated, you can always offer your guests extra dressing. I skip the poppy seeds, toast either sliced almonds or pine nuts (whatever I have on hand), and if I can I like to do some nice goat's cheese and canned mandarin oranges... yum! 
Make sure to toss the dressing in very slowly first, then throw all the goodies on top or else they all fall to the bottom~ enjoy!

Made this last night. Husband RAVED about this, more than any other recipe I got from this or any other recipe site. I added a little cinnamon and sugar to the almonds near the end of sauteing, went with the 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup, and it was wonderful! Thanks!

I really enjoyed this salad...I think it was a bit too many cranberry's so next time I would reduce it to 3/4 cup...I also used red onion instead of white and I added a little bit of feta cheese and Tangerine pieces...the dressing was great!!

I've had this recipe in my "recipes to try" folder forever but never had all the ingredients for it until now. I wish I would have tried it sooner. I miss read the recipe and put in 2 tablespoons of onion by mistake but it was still awesome. I made a jar of the dressing so all I need to do is pour it on the salad as needed. So far I've made 2 bowls for lunch and I will probably eat the rest for dinner. Oh, by the way, I don't really like salad in general.

My family loves this recipe. I use strawberries instead of cranberries. I also toast the almonds on a plate in the microwave to save the calories from butter (60 secs in my microwave). I also use Splenda in the dressing instead of sugar.

I eat salad every day, and I have so many great recipes, so it takes a lot to impress me--and this one did. What an excellent combination of flavors! The dressing didn't taste all that special on its own, but once it was tossed with the salad...delicious! I made several minor modifications, all based on personal preference: I don't like raw onion, so I used shallot because it's milder; I used 1/4 cup agave nectar, which is the equivalent of 1/3 cup sugar; I toasted only half of the nuts and seeds (in a dry skillet) because I like the flavor of them raw as well; I used pumpkin seeds instead of poppy seeds because that's what I had on hand (although now that I know I'll make this salad often, I'll buy poppy seeds); and I used olive oil instead of veg. Plus, I used home-dried cranberries, which were more tart. The texture of the spinach was just perfect for this salad--I wouldn't make it with any other green. Thanks for a great new salad recipe to add to my ever-expanding collection!

I loved this salad - great combination of flavours. A couple of suggestions though: definitely 1/3 cup sugar is enough. Also, you don't need butter to toast the almond - do it in the oven or a dry pan on the stove - they're much less greasy. Finally, although I really liked this dressing, I can see how some might find it too vinegary - I might try it with a little less vinegar and more oil next time. But truly, the taste is excellent and worth making!

Delicious!! I used balsamic vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. We all enjoyed the nutty flavor the toasted seasame seeds added..do not skip that step, it's vital! Also I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup as other reviewers did, it was plenty sweet enough. The almonds were pefect in flavor and texture. I think 1 cup of cranberries is too much, so next time I will reduce it to 3/4 cup. Everyone loved this salad and the dressing was wonderful.

Soooooo good! But I did also tweak a few things after I made it a couple times. I used balsamic instead of cider vinegar, and I cut out the sugar since balsamic is sweet. I also omitted the poppy seeds and I added fresh strawberries and some walnuts. I could eat the whole salad alone if I'm not careful! Thanks Jamie!

We absolutely love this salad.  I have added a few things to  it though, and I think it makes it all the better.  I fry up a few bacon slices and crumble them into the salad, I add bleu cheese crumbles, and sometimes avocado.  Sometimes I'll use candied walnuts instead of the almonds.  I love sweet so I never have halved the sugar in the dressing, always the full amount.  It's soooo good!***UPDATE***Adding some craisins turns out great too!  Still making this salad and loving it!

Absolutely fabulous for the holidays!  I toasted both sesame and poppy seeds just a little in a heavy skillet.  Poppy seed flavor comes out nicely when you toast.  I did reduce the sugar just a bit and I used fine granulated sugar for baking instead - it blends much better.  Also, try using a cheese grater to grate your onion into a wire strainer.  You'll get lots of juice, but the onion takes on a wonderful flavor and not strong and too crunchy for those who are not overly crazy for onion.  I love them, but grating the onion makes for a milder flavor and serves to enhance the taste overall.

Unusual, and it tastes fantastic! My new favourite salad. I did not include the poppy seeds and it still tasted good. I did use more sesame seeds than suggested. Oh, and I cut the sugar to half or even less as the cranberries are very sweet in themselves. Put the greens in individual salad bowls, top with toasted nuts and cranberries, then pour the dressing on top for your guests to toss themselves. That makes for a pretty presentation and avoids the problem of the "bits" falling to the bottom of the bowl and getting lost.

TERRIFIC salad. I toasted the almonds and sesame seeds together with good results. Would definitely recommend adding the dressing a bit at a time, tossing in between, until all spinach (I used a bag of spring mix instead of just spinach and it tasted great) is just lightly coated. Loved this recipe.

I brought this salad to a potluck. It was gone in a flash. Pleasant to look at, delicious to eat.  Hint: accidentally, my husband left out the sugar when he wisked the dressing together for me.  It was wonderful without the sugar.  Cranberries made it sweet. This recipe is great for those who have to watch their sugar intake.

Different without being too different.  I only used about half of the dressing.  Plenty left for another round!  I used half spinach/half romaine and it was a big hit!

This was a great alternative to the typical garden salad or ceaser salad.  We served it along side of foccacia bread with cambozola.  This was a very tasty combination, enough for a meal or as an appetizer.  A very quick and easy addition to any meal.

This was great, fast and easy!  Toasting the almonds and sesame seeds is definitely crucial.  Added mandarins for extra substance like a review suggested, I thought the recipe might need more flavor but it was great as is.  Plan on making this again!

Jamie, you're a genius! This salad is so delicious, I could probably eat the whole thing by myself! The only changes I made was to make less dressing. I used about 2oz each white wine vinegar, cider vinegar, and olive oil and probably only 3 TBS of sugar. I only changed the portions so it would contain less calories and I could eat more! Thanks for sharing this one, Jamie!

FAbULOUS.  This salad is so delicious and tasty.  The only think I did wrong was put the dressing on an hour before serving and got a little soggy.  I'd recommend having the dressing on the side and pour on right when you are about to eat it.

Took this to work for food day and everyone loved it, especially the dressing.  I made it according to the recipe, using organic baby spinach (didn't chop it up) and substituting extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil.  It was easy to make the dressing the night before, toast the almonds and put in a baggy after they cooled, then combine the spinach, almonds and dried cranberries right before lunch, shake up the dressing and toss everything together!

So simple and tastes great. While putting this together for a dinner party I was thinking what is the big deal? It's salad with almonds and cranberries. Once you add the dressing, WOW! Once you try this with the dressing you will be surprised at how delicious it is. Everyone loved it. I mixed field greens with the spinach and used a little less sugar in the dressing, everything else was exactly as the recipe calls for. I will definitely make this again.

This salad recipe is great! After making it exactly as written several times I changed it a little bit. I only had walnuts so I put them in a small skillet, cooked for about a minute. I then added 3 Tbsp. of sugar and 2 Tbsp. water. Once the walnuts were
well coated I removed them from the heat and allowed to cool completely.

LOVE this! I've tried various substitions (pine nuts vs almonds, using different dressings for a short cut) but the original recipe is my favorite. The dressing is one of the best I've ever made - the sesame seeds and poppy seeds add so much flavor. Definitely toast the almonds in the butter, it adds a very special touch. The only variation is I always use a nice extra virgin olive oil (NOT vegetable oil as the recipe says). Last night I also added goat cheese for the first time and I loved it and will include that moving forward. Every party/dinner I serve it at every last drop is gone (and everyone asks for the recipe).

This is a wonderful, wonderful salad! I tried it with blueberries instead of cranberries, and it was delicious. I'll definitely be adding it to my 'favorites' list.

Very good, but phaylock was right, it is better with fresh strawberries. A friend made it that way for me last week.

Dressing is 5 stars!  But spinach salad must be made with fresh strawberries, or mandarin oranges if fresh strawberries are way out of season, never with dried fruit.  Blech.

One of my faves on this site. Add small can mandarin oranges, drained, and 8 oz crumbled bleu cheese or feta and you will receive marriage proposals ;)

Ok, after going over a mental list of ingredients and assuring myself I didn't mess anything up, I can cofindently say this salad was not good. I can't imagine why anyone would rate it 5 stars. The spinach, almonds and cranberries are a good start, but I did not care for the dressing. All I tasted was oil & sugar with a hint of vinegar. My boyfriend agreed, which makes me even more curious as to the ratings for this, because he's the salad eater, not me. I'm sorry, but this salade was not good.

I decided to try this recipe because of the thousands of great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. I split it into two bowls, one I added almonds and the other I put in pine nuts as recommended by other reviewers. It turned out too sweet that I had to get rid of the excess dressing and diluted the remaining with water and kept draining it. I added black pepper, some lemon tuna slices, all in one packet spices and salt. And even after all this, my family and I think its one of the worst salads we ever tried.
If you still want to go ahead and try it, I suggest NOT putting a half cup of sugar, other reviewers added 1 table spoon and were happy with the salad, so don't put too much, taste it and then decided if you want to put more.

I made this for thanksgiving. I'm southeast asian so I was very very hesitant to try this recipe since it's definitely not the norm but it was a HUGE hit. Everyone loved it! Can't wait to make it again!

BEST SALAD EVER!!!
I usually don't like salads that are potentially sweet, so I was hesitant when making this. I was SO happy with the results. It wasnt too sweet; as a matter of fact, it was sweet and salty. This is a recipe that I will make again and again! I am making it for dinner tonight and I am going to add some chopped apple and a bit of shredded cheese.
YUM!!!

This is incredible, mostly because of the dressing. It is nutty and rich from the toasted sesame seeds, sweet with the sugar, and just the right amount of balanced tang with the vinegars. I made in a small tupperware container, so I could keep shaking throughout the night for my dinner party of 4. I didn't have cranberries (oops), so I used chopped up dried apricots, which worked quite nicely. Thanks for this awesome and relatively cheap alternative to store bought dressings!

I made this for a lunch yesterday. I didn't want to add the poppy seeds since so many reviewers said it wasn't necessary. However, I did toast the almonds AND the sesame seeds. The salad dressing smelled too vinegar-y it was a turn-off at first and I was worried no one would like it. But I mixed it in with the salad anyway and it wasn't so bad. The ladies at the lunch complimented on the salad - they really liked it! :) The host emptied my salad bowl and kept the rest (which wasn't much anyway). Overall, this was great.

we all loved it. used whole raw almonds and chopped up- the extra big crunch was yummy.  added blue cheese and used a 10 ounce bag of baby spinach.  I don't think you need all that dressing and definitely not all that oil (next time I will use half of the oil and try using half of the sugar).  yummy, thanks.

This is a delicious salad, and reasonably easy to make. The dried cranberries and toasted almond slivers were excellent together, and the dressing was very tasty. The only thing we did differently was serve the salad and dressing separately so everyone could dress their salad to their desired taste. Definitely a recipe we'll use again and again.

Truly delicious! I added lightly sauteed mushrooms with a bit of fresh garlic. The dressing was fantastic...has a little kick but the cranberries balance it out! This will become a salad mainstay in our house.

This salad is incredible!  I could eat it daily and my whole family loves it.  I didn't add the sesame or poppy seeds b/c they were a tad expensive for the small amount I was going to use.  I sliced some red onion into the salad instead of adding it to the dressing and I also added bleu cheese as suggested.  I love mixed greens and the dressing + blend of flavors was amazing!  The only downside is that the salad wilts quickly so leftovers are a little sad looking.  We usually just keep the ingredients on hand and add the dressing individually instead of tossing the whole salad - problem solved!  SO GOOD!

I made this salad for our Christmas dinner and it was delicious! I took other user's suggestions and used Craisins, mandarin oranges,  and Paul Newman's Balsamic Vinaigrette. Excellent suggestions! Easy to make and yummy to your tummy!

Update: I made this again for Christmas dinner 2011 and it was still a big hit! The only change I made this year was that I used a spring mix salad instead of the spinach. Most of my family members are not big spinach eaters.

This is delicious!  I too toasted the sesame seeds and almonds at 350 for 10 min. w/ no butter, used 1/2 cup light olive oil instead of veg. oil, and kept sugar the same as called for, 1/2 cup, otherwise it was too vinegary.  I added feta cheese to the dressing mixture too.

Wonderful salad.  I made it as written and as everyone else said, I was asked for the recipe over and over again.  I did not dress the salad, preferring to keep the dressing to the side.  Now I am looking forward to making some for myself to eat this week at work.

Everyone loved this salad so much at Christmas time!  Even picky eaters loved this and asked for the recipe.  I used pecans instead of almonds the second time I made it and I use Craisins for an awesome taste.  i have to put leftovers in the fridge or I keep eating!  I have been looking for a spinach salad dressing and this is the one.  The dressing tastes especially yummy if you make up a batch and keep it in the fridge for a couple of days before you use it.

I've used Jamie's recipe for a few years now and just wanted to thank you for all the compliments I receive on this dish.  It is extremely elegant and easy.  I use whatever vinegars I have on hand...balsamic, malt, red wine, raspberry balsamic...it always turns out delicious.

I need to eat foods which are low-fat and have very little acid (such as vinegar).  I used 1/3 of the vegetable oil and 1/3 of the vinegar (used all red (raspberry!) wine vinegar)...and this was STILL the best spinach salad I have ever eaten and a salad I could easily serve company.

this recipe is great with rasberry dressing.  I've used Marie's fat free and it's wonderful!

Also, every once in a while I'll add rinsed off mandarine oranges.  Nice in the warmer months.

This is by far the best salad I have ever had.  I brought it to my book group dinner and everyone had seconds and thirds.  Everyone asked for the recipe and their families and friends have raved about it when they made it, too.  A REAL winner!

Very "classy" salad and so delicious. Relatives loved it during Thanksgiving dinner. Someone commented they "could eat the whole bowl by themself!" This one is going in my recipe box.

Wowsers!!  This is definitely a family favorite.  My husband always gets nervous when I try new salad recipes and he absolutely loved this.  I have told all my friends about it.  This should definitely be on the top ten list!  Thanks so much Jamie!

This is my favorite salad.  I love the almonds and cranberries.  Make sure to rinse the spinach 3 times to get rid of all the grit.

Fantastic! Everyone I make this for loves it. I did a few changes, I switched the almonds for pine nuts and toasted them and I omitted the poppy seeds and sesame seeds. I also used splenda instead of plain sugar. If you don't like your salad swimming in dressing, I would recommend halving the recipe.

When I first made this, I wasn't quite sure about it; but in retrospect, i believe the flavors are simply so stunning you have to be careful what you eat it with.  In otherwords, as a side dish at a BBQ, not so impressive;  As a main course by itself or with a very mild flavored meat such as chicken or fish, this works well.  Made as directed with only change being the addition of about a 1/4 cup of dried cherries as I ran out of dried cranberries and having to use smoked almonds (which I think really enhanced the flavors and balanced out the sweetness of the dressing).  Will make again :)

AMAZING!!!! I found this recipe about 2 weeks ago,and I think I've already had this salad 8 times. I followed the recipe exactly, but also added blue cheese. For convenience ( since i have it practically every day), I make the dressing for the serving 8, put in the fridge, toast  about 2 cups of almonds and keep in a container so when i need to make the salad all i do is assemble and eat at any time. Brought some for coworkers to try today  and had to print 6 copies of the recipe!!

This spinach salad is even better than the SEVEN SPINACH SALAD, also offered here - and the difference is the toasted almond slivers.  Toasting the almonds makes all the difference, as it brings out the flavor soooo much more than just serving them raw.  Be careful not to burn these - it's easy to do.  These salads are just wonderful.  The combination of flavors is what makes them so outstanding.  In this recipe, it's the complementary flavors of cranberries, toasted almonds and spinach.  I threw in a little mixed salad greens - about a cup - with baby spinach leaves.  The dressing pulls it all together.  This salad is killer.  I feel healthier already!

Incredible dressing! Don't buy dressing, make this it is so  easy and soooooo delicious.  Like the other reviews say don't use butter, just toast the almonds and sesame seeds and sub the craisins for the cranberries. This salad is GGGGGRRRREAAT!!

Made exactly as written, only I added crumbled gorgonzola - DELICIOUS! Have even made this a couple of times and added grilled chicken and even frozen popcorn chicken (heat in oven first, of course) - great for quick meals.

This dressing is a hit every time I make it.  No need for modifications except I haven't yet determined what the need is for the poppy seeds as you can't taste them, LOL!  I think i might experiment with a little sesame seed oil next time for added sesame flavor.

Jamie's recipe is wonderful!  I've been making a similar recipe for years.  Some fun alternations we have done are using cashews instead of almonds, using black sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds/sesame seeds.  Just use what you like!  We have used fresh strawberries/blackberries/raspberries when in season.  The only thing different is we do not use onion in the dressing.    Have fun with this recipe and thank you for sharing this, Jamie!

Excellent!  I added a can of mandarin oranges (drained) and sprinkled on some feta cheese just for color and variety.  Dressing was divine- certainly a keeper.

Just finished the last bite and had to review!! I am just starting to learn how to cook and this salad made me seem like a pro! I toasted almonds (for the first time) and it was so easy but a great addition! I also added some chopped, lightly sauteed portabello mushrooms and a few mandarin oranges. I added gorgonzola cheese and the flavors blended perfect! Just like a salad I've had at a fancy restaurant!! Thanks so much for this recipe! :D

WOW WOW WOW. I made it for a potluck and it was a big hit. Since then, we have made it pretty much every week. I use mixed green instead (coz we don't like spinach). I cut the sugar down by half. I added blue cheese, mandarin oranges OR strawberries and grilled chicken to it. Once you add chicken, it becomes a meal. Thanks Jamie!

This recipe is fantastic. I agree with cutting down on the sugar by at least half (I used 1/4 cup and it was more than fine) and I also used dried cherries. This is a very simple and tasty dressing. I will definitely be making this again several times this summer!

Although I didn't have a few items (paprika, sesame and poppy seeds) this still turned out excellent. My husband loved the sweetness of it. I did add feta cheese and red onions and it turned out great.

Kids loved the dressing.  I thought it was WAY too sweet (hence why the kids liked it).  The salad itself was nothing special.

Made this salad for my daughter and son-in-law to take to his side of the family for Christmas Supper.  Being newly married, my daughter was nervious.  She returned beaming.....the family raved about the dish!

This was absolutely delicious! I took another reviewer's advice and dry-roasted the almonds. Also reduced the sugar a bit.

4.5 Stars:  I followed other reviews and decreased sugar to a little less than 1/3 cup and it was still quite sweet.  I used onion powder instead of onion and think that was a good move.  I hate poppyseeds, so those were deleted.  I added gorgonzola, which was fabulous.  I did not premix, but let everyone mix their own. No one else at my house would try it, but I thought it was delicious.

I made this for dinner last night, making only one change (cutting the sugar in half) and it was amazing! I had more than my fair share and honestly I think I will make it again tonight because I can't stop thinking about it. All of these flavors work perfectly together. Be sure to toast the almonds as directed, they add a delicious taste and texture. Great recipe, thank you!

Now my go-to salad.  We love it!  I find that we only need about 1/8 of the dressing per salad we make, which is great because I can save it in the fridge and just whip the salad up in no time.  Thank you!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I have eaten one very similar that had apples, cheese chunks and cashews.  The dressing was also similiar except instead of the paprika it had dried mustard powder.   

I followed the recipe for the dressing except that I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil. The dressing was a little strong in the vinegar flavor and sweetness.  I think next time I'll reduce the sugar and increase the olive oil.

I liked it so much that I wanted to finish off my bag of spinach so I used some extra dried cranberries(from the bag I bought) and added sunflower seeds because I ran out of the almonds.

I have found myself thinking about this recipe several times since I made it and I'm eager to make it again.

Excellent as written. However,  I am not a big fan of vinegar, so I decrease it to just 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar.

This salad is so, so good. The only thing I did different was to use toasted pine nuts instead of almonds because that's what I had. The dressing is delicious. I will be making this frequently. Thanks for helping me be healthy!

Always a favorite!  If you are making this for a get together, bring the recipe because people will ask you for it.  I make it just as it's written, but next time will add feta and/or apples.  Delicious!

Could use more sugar than the recipe calls for. Let the dressing get to room temperature so it can blend.

Excellent salad!  I used bite-size romaine lettuce hearts instead of spinach; omitted the poppy and sesame seeds and added one apple, cubed.  The toasted almonds are so good and the dressing complements all the other ingredients...my family and friends love it!!!!

As good as everyone says. I made it as written.  It went over well for Thanksgiving and totally seemed to work as a fall salad.  I made it again but added a chicken breast, a bit of gorgonzoloa cheese, and a few pine nuts and had it for lunch.  Great!

Love this. I did not like almonds so I used toasted pecans and added some crumbled goat cheese. So good. Hint... The prepared dressing is more than plenty. You will have some left over. I just add it to other salads. I good change from the normal Ranch dressing.

I can't help but laugh at the reviews of this incredible recipe. People change it all around their way and even use bottled dressing. The author goes to all trouble to put her recipe up here and no one follows it.  THIS RECIPE ROCKS! Every time I make it to the letter everyone wants the recipe!

I make this recipe every time I have friends for dinner.  There is never any left over.  For my husband and me I cut the recipe in half and serve it with all kinds of main dishes. Once I had to substitute pines nuts for almonds - just as good. It's absolutely delicious.

Wow!  This was sooooooo good.  I followed the suggestion of others and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup sugar.  It would have been way too sweet if I would have used 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also used a minced shallot instead of the 2 teaspoons minced onion for a milder flavor and added feta cheese.  My fiance LOVED this salad and he has always refused to ever eat any salad unless it has Ranch dressing on it.  I made more of the dressing yesterday so I can use it on other salads too.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

Absolutely LOVED this salad.  I used mixed greens instead of just the spinach - which I highly recommend.  I also added crumbled gorgonzola, which gave a nice balance of salt to the sweetness of the dresssing & dried cranberries.  The dressing is wonderful.  I left out the poppyseeds, because I didn't have any on hand - but didn't miss them at all.  I will definatley be making this one again and again.

The best ever!!!  The only thing that I can possibly add is that make sure you use baby spinich as the other spinich has somewhat of a bitter taste (mine did anyway).

I always get so much praise when I make this salad - the secret is in the dressing and the toasted almonds. You can also substitute strawberries for cranberries, and use Feta cheese to kick it up a notch.. excellent recipe!!

have made this several times for dinner guests and is always a hit.  i never mix in the dressing, but instead let guests drizzle it themselves.  i find the dressing is better after it has refrigerated for at least an hour.

Instead of buying all the nuts, seeds, and berries, I just used two bags of 'berry almond  trail mix' by Planters from Safeway. So much easier, cheaper, and this salad still tasted amazing!

Easy to make.  Great. Made it for a cocktail party.  Everyone loved it.  I toasted the almonds in the oven w/o butter.  They don't need it.  Followed the suggestion of the gorgonzola and thin red onion slices instead of minced onion.  For the dressing, I used 1/3 c oil, and used half sugar , half Splenda.

Y*U*M. The dressing is perfect. I used instant minced onion instead of fresh (speedier). I like adding a bit of sugar, salt, and generous pepper to the ALMONDS as I toast them, and they come out crunchy, savory, and caramelized. Sadly, I served this to a bunch of wimps ;) who either didn't ~prefer~ spinach or wanted "ranch" dressing instead so...more for me! Yummy. And so lovely too.

You just can't go wrong with this recipe, anyone with good taste loves it. But like others commented, the amount of sugar the recipe calls for is too much -- I use 1/4 cup or less and it's perfect. I also use different types of lettuce: spinach, romaine, iceberg...whatever you have, just mix it up and it makes it better than spinach alone. The last time I made this I added apple and pear chunks and everyone loved it. I also put some crumbled gorgonzola on the side for those that wanted to add it, which I think was a nice touch.

Wow, this is truly wonderful!! I buy fresh spinach in a 10 oz. pkg. and so I just make 1/2 batch of dressing and everything else. Make sure you use the white wine vinegar. The first time I made this I did not have it on hand and used all apple cider vinegar and it was too strong. Be sure to add Feta Cheese! It is out of this world..

This recipe truly is fantastic. I adapted it a little based on other reviews and my personal preferences. I used brown sugar instead of white, and a little less sugar than the recipe called for. I was short of white vinegar, so I added a little lime juice. I used pine nuts instead of almonds and left out the poppy seeds. I also used Craisins. People LOVED it. I'm going to take this to my next potluck this Sunday. The dressing does make much more than you need, so I have enough left over for this Sunday that I don't have to make any more. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have been making this salad for years and people literally lick their plates. Throw ingredients in order into a mini food processor (pulsing as you go along) to whip up the dressing.  By using only apple cider vinegar and leaving out the white wine vinegar, you can reduce the sugar to between 1/4 and 1/3 cup.  I add sliced fresh strawberries instead of cranberries, as well as cubed avocado and mango, and a can of drained, mandarin orange pieces.  I also often substitute 2 bags of assorted greens for the spinach. If toasting almonds, not necessary to add butter to pan, just brown in non-stick pan and the natural oil in the nuts will do the job.  One word comes to mind when thinking of this recipe - divine!

This went over so well at a recent dinner party that my husband insists I make it frequently for dinner.  I used the Balsamic dressing like another reviewer had mentioned, but added granny smith apples and feta cheese.  Definitely compliments the salad nicely.

This is my "go to" salad recipe for company or potlucks.  I usually toast the nuts and sesame seeds in the oven, which is neater and less greasy.  I have  been asked for this recipe many times, which shows that it's a winner!  I have tried it without nuts and using Splenda in place of the sugar when making it for people with allergies and diabetes, but I personally find the recipe perfect as written.  Try it out, and enjoy!

Even my kids, who think they hate spinach, love this salad/dressing. In a crunch, I've skipped toasting the sesame seeds. It makes a difference. Don't skip. Dressing makes more than some may want, so add to salad sparingly, toss, add more. That way you don't drown the bottom of the bowl. Everyone swoons over this. A guaranteed hit.

This is a really easy, tasty salad to make exactly as the recipe states or use as a starting point to make your own substitutions. I know I will keep coming back to this recipe substituting different lettuces, fruits, and nuts. I've made it twice now...once using half baby spinach, half spring mix. The second time I used all spring mix. Others enjoyed this as well, except for those who don't really like sweetness in their salad.

I have never attempted to make a full-blown homemade salad, so I was a little hesitant about making the dressing myself. I was amazed that I did it and it tasted delicious!! I left out paprika only because I forgot to put it in but it turned out great nonetheless.  I added julienned carrots just for a little more color.

This is a go-to potluck recipe for me! I reduce the sugar by half, toast the almonds  on a baking sheet instead of sauteeing them in a skillet, and substitute 1/4 c. olive oil for the 1/2 c. vegetable oil.

My favourite "fancy" salad!  ;-)

It is delicious and I crave it often.  Very suitable for a holiday dinner or even a summer dinner.  We just loved it!  

We also cut the sugar in half, mind you.

a truly wonderful salad... the only changes I made were to add some feta cheese.With the dressing I used olive oil and only about half the recommended amount, splenda for the sugar, dry toasted the almonds ( less fat), fresh finely chopped red onion and for the paprika, I used a mixture of sweet and hot paprika... makes a great salad just that little bit healthier.

This dressing was so wonderful, that I have made it twice.  The second time was for a smoked salmon and spinach salad (with bacon, toasted almonds, and blue cheese crumbles).  I substituted raspberry vinegarette for the regular vinegar.  I took it to an office potluck, and was deluged with requests for the recipe. The almonds, fresh spinach, sesame and poppy seeds give this a wonderful fresh crunch.  Jamie, thanks ... so much... for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is excellent, especially during fall/holiday/winterseason!!!  Dried cranberries make it sweet and nuts give it crunch. Dressing is great and can be made ahead, only I cut the sugar just a little. I also do my almonds ahead. I usually use romaine and spring mix (mesclun) instead of all spinach, and add more greens as we LOVE salad, as this dressing makes alot. I have shared this w/ alot of my friends, and they just love it! I'm making it for Tgiving, for something "green" and different!  Try it, you will LOVE IT! Thanks for a keeper, Jamie!!!!

Wonderfully easy for a weeknight salad and pretty enough for company. We followed other reviews and topped each individual salad with the cranberries (so they don't fall to the bottom) as well as with some crumbled blue cheese.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

I had this recipe bookmarked for the longest time because it seemed I never had all the ingredients. Now that I've tried it, my husband and I can't get enough of it!!!. I had a friend over for lunch today who asked for the recipe. Thank you, a big time definite keeper. I used a smidge less sugar than called for. Can't get this salad out of my mind. It really is great! I make enough for the two of us and save the extra dressing in a container in the fridge so it's always ready. Update 2/08 - I've made this salad dozens of times since '02 and it still is my favorite. The only thing that I do different is to toast the almonds in the oven till lightly browned(I toast a bunch of them and keep them on hand for other salads, etc.) The best recipe on this site!

Yummy!  We omitted poppy seeds ($$$) and halved the oil-- I might even decrease the oil next time.  This makes enough dressing for twice as much salad as is listed-- we ended up mixing in a romaine blend to try to use it all.  We served the almonds and cranberries on the side to keep them from sinking to the bottom of the bowl.  We also added bleu cheese crumbles-- wouldn't be nearly as good without them.  All that said, I ate it four meals in a row (yes, breakfast included)-- and I usually hate leftovers!  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe as is but slightly modified using some of the other reviewer’s suggestions makes it even better!  I kept the dressing in a separate bowl from the spinach/cranberries to be added just before eating (IF there are any leftover’s they won’t be soggy the next day).  I also offered a bowl of crumbled blue cheese.  It was wonderful and I received many complements and requests for the recipe!  I’ve also used the dressing as a marinade for chicken breasts.  Delicious!

This salad is great.  I cut back on the sugar and used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seed. My boyfriend says the dressing was great, but I prefer my salads dry.

As everyone says, this salad is amazing. I'm allergic to nuts, so I substituted sunflower seeds for almonds. They take a while to roast, but it was delicious!

I served this salad at a dinner party & it was an instant hit. It is very pretty with the red cranberrys against the spinach.  I have been using a spinach/apple salad recipe that is excellent - it is nice to have something equally as good to add to my salad specialties.

Well, nobody "raved" about this.  In fact, out of 10 dinner guests, no one even commented on it, but it was well eaten.  I thought it was good but I have had better salads, so this fell short of a 5 star.  I would not make this again simply because there are better ones out there.  If you plan to try this, one suggestion I would strongly make is not to toast the slivered almonds in butter.  Once they cooled and were on the cold salad, they were greasy because the butter had solidified.  If I were going to make this salad again, I would definitely toast the almonds the dry method way.

Excellent and so easy! I used mixed baby greens and added a little crumbled feta because that's what I had in the fridge (but goat cheese or gorgonzola would also be great), and I loved the extra flavor, texture, and visual appeal brought by the cheese. Note to those who thought this was too sweet: Don't just dump on ALL of the dressing at once-toss the salad as you gradually add dressing, just enough to lightly coat the greens.  This recipe is a wonderful blend of flavors and textures, and I love that this salad looks impressive while being so easy!

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it was WONDERFUL. The fact that I was eating healthy spinach even made it more appealing. It will be hard to go back to lettuce salads. 
I'm going to have to agree with Jteam here as well. Rate the recipe on its own merit, that way we get a true rating. Love all the other suggestions, but yes, post it as a separate recipe,  that we can also try it and rate your version of it.
NEXT DAY: 
I had to come back and add this to my review. After dinner, I had just about 1 1/2 servings left. I was interested in seeing how the salad would hold up for left overs. Especially since the salad was already dressed. So I got rid of the dressing that was at the bottom of the serving bowl and put the salad in the fridge. The next day I had it and the spinach had taken on a different texture and so had the flavor. The salad had more depth to it. With the changed texture and deeper flavor, it was like a whole different salad.  The first time around it was bright, the second time around it was still good. I shall be absolutely making this salad again as is and definitely saving the leftovers.

To me, this salad was ok, as per many reviews, I cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was sweet enough for me, but too vinegary for my taste. I'm a big salad eater and I don't think I'll be making this one again unless I make changes to it. After trying the original way, I can imagine it would be better with mandarines and by cutting the vinegars by half, I would also add green onions and maybe some cheese... Guess I'll just have to try it again!

Rating this a 5 because of the dressing (though I did cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup). AMAZING. I add all the dressing ingredients to a mason jar, shake, and viola! It's ready to go and ready to travel. I use it on a salad of spinach, dried cranberries, Brie, and pine nuts. DELICIOUS! You can also add chicken. The dressing is so much better than any bottled dressing and super easy to make. This is now my "go to" dressing. Thanks!

I don't get it. I really didn't like the dressing. I did doctor it up significantly and then it really tasted good, but it took a lot of changes. Oh well, different bites for different likes.

This recipe is as delicious as it is easy.  The dressing really makes it special.  I added a few things to the salad for a bit more substance and found it comlimented everything very well.  I used diced red onion in the salad instead of the minced onion in the dressing.  I also added some bits of peppered bacon and some gorgonzola crumbles.  I thought my guests would lick the salad bowl!  Not a morsel left.

It's bad. I don't know why everyone is freaking out about this recipe.  It's all just a matter of my opinion though.  I'd recommend adding the dressing a little at a time.  I've made it a few times...tinkering around with the dressing and the amount each time, and each time, we never finish what I make.

Delicious!
The only thing I varied was simply toasting the almonds in a pan without using any butter.
It was very good - I made it as an appetizer when I had company and my friend said it was restaurant quality!

You could play around with this, but it's perfect as is. I did reduce the sugar just a bit (for a double recipe, I used 3/4 cup). I also eliminated the butter and just cooked the almonds in a nonstick skillet without it, and I used sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil. All very minor tweaks. Took it to a potluck and had several requests for the recipe. I would highly recommend it!

Not sure if I liked the sesame seed flavor, but then not sure if that was what made me keep eating it. Sounds weird but this salad is somehow addictive. Don't mix the dressing and your next three days worth of leftovers won't be wilted.

I just made this tonight. I have 5 picky eaters at home and this salad was a big hit. Everyone loved it and not a bit was left over! I did add a bit of Feta cheese and used a bit less sugar in the dressing. I also used pecans that I toasted in a skillet with 1 Tbs of butter and 1 Tbs of sugar. However I believe this recipe would be wonderful just as written!

I love to make this salad but here's my super easy way to make bascially the same thing. Spinach, almonds (or walnuts) crasins, and feta. Instead of  making the dressing i use half poppyseed dressing and half balsamic vinegrette. SO GOOD!! easy and fast

Delicious! The first time I made this I left out sesame seeds and poppy seeds because I didn't have them on hand. The second time I made it I added them to the dressing and it was even better. I made this for Christmas and it was a big hit with my family.

Awesome salad!  A couple of comments: Make sure you separate the dried cranberries from each other, as they often are clumped together out of the package.  This will help to prevent them from all falling to the bottom of the dish.  I hate almonds, so I added my own honey toasted cashews.  Also, I added some sliced red onions as well, to give it some more flavor.

This salad is SO good! I made it for thanksgiving and Christmas! I've already given the recipe out to lots of people because it's so yummy!! I didn't change a thing! I hate when people right a review and change the whole recipe lol so I always try the actual recipe first! And adding craisins is cheaper and doesn't make a difference. Make this and enjoy :)

I substituted raspberry wine vinegar for the cider vinegar, because that was what I had in the house.  I also cut down on the sugar in the dressing.  It was delicious.

Awesome salad!  I made it like 4 times over the past 2 weeks.  It is one of my favorites for a side salad with dinner.  My husband loved it too!

I simplified a bit, I didn't use sesame seeds or poppy seeds, sugar, onion, or paprika and used olive oil and balsamic vinegar and added tangerines which really enhances the flavor.

This salad is outrageously good.  I used regular mixed greens instead of spinach, because that's what we had on hand, and it was great.  I sprinkled candied nuts over top and that really set it off!  (See Bea's recipe for "Pecan Snack").  Be aware that the vinaigrette for this recipe is very sweet.  I happen to love it, but somebody who doesn't love sweet dressings may be put off.

I toast the sesame seeds in a dry, non-stick skillet until they are golden, grate the onion, use dry-roasted almonds, and skip the sugar/vinegar combo and just use balsamic vinegar. Usually I make a half batch, but even then, reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar to 1/3 cup. Also, I prefer olive oil to vegetable oil. I've used Romaine for this, also. Almost as yummy, but not quite. I also have substituted raisins for the cranberries, it's OK, but not as good, and nice for a change if you basically start eating this salad every single night like I have.  

So good I really have trouble eating salad any other way.

This salad is a great starter recipe and can be adapted for your own taste.  Generally I add a little less sugar, substitute dried cherries and pinenuts for the cranberries and almonds, then add goat cheese.  It's the greatest thing that ever happened to a salad.

I'm often skeptical when trying new recipes.  This recipe deserves the 5 stars.  I used romaine instead of spinach, still stellar.  The perfect salad for Thanksgiving dinner!

I have made this salad twice and both times it was delicious with a very unique flavour for a spinach salad. I aboslutely loved it!
I made a couple of changes: I halved the sugar and oil, and used raspberry vinegar instead of cider vinegar. I think the sesame and poppy seeds are key so do not leave those out. I'll be making this many many more times! Thanks Jamie!

Made it for the first time and served it to company.  Everyone raved about it....even the men!!  However will definitely cut down on the oil next time.  Served the dressing in a separate bowl for all to help themselves which worked out for the best.  Will definitely make again.

This salad was very good.  But I made the mistake of listening to one of the other viewers & used "Newman's Balsamic vinegar".  All tho I love balsamic vinegar, this DID NOT go good with this salad.  Next time I will make the original dressing.  Always try the recipe as is, if it's not to your liking, then try something else.  I did not have wine vinegar, so thought balsamic dressing would do.  I will make this again, and know it will be a lot better with the dressing that is written down.  Learned a lesson

We thought this recipe was good, not great.  I followed the recipe exactly except for I didn't use the butter to toast the almonds.  We kind of felt like it was missing a little something but it was still wonderful.  I will for sure make it again and add a few things, very good base recipe

Very good salad, but I prefer to use pecans instead of almonds.  I saute them in butter, then add brown sugar and let them cook a couple of minutes, cool, then break apart the sugar/pecan candy.  I also like dried cherries rather than cranberries.  Always loved at dinner parties.

This salad is absolutely delicious! I made the dressing exactly as written, but used a spinach and mesclun mix for the greens.  The mesclun lent the salad a bite of bitter spiciness, which went incredibly well with the dressing. I topped it with walnuts, cranberries, and blue cheese. This is my favorite salad to date! Thanks Jamie!

This salad is really good...I used craisins and toasted the almonds in sugar for a honey roasted flavor. Also used Kraft Balsamic dressing, just cause I was in a hurry. But I am really looking forward to making it next time with the dressing from the recipe.

This salad was awesome.  I have made this for three different occasions and each time have been asked for the recipe.  I did leave out the poppy seed as I am not a fan, but did not make any other changes.  Thanks for a great salad!

Very yummy! I subbed out the veggie oil and used olive oil, and cut down the sugar by 1 T (for serving size of 2). Really good flavor combinations! Will definitely make again.

Very good salad. I toast the almonds without the butter, use 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup and use extra virgin olive oil. Brought it to a couple of times to a potluck and was asked for the recipe. Super easy and delicious!

Delicious! At first I was skeptical to try this recipe  as my husband is somewhat picky about salads, preferring  the basic typical house salad with ranch dressing. I made the salad, and ended up serving it the next day (wasn't planned that way) never the less it was absolutely amazing. Such a nice change, and everyone who has tasted this when I make it loves it. My husband commented this was the best salad he has ever had. I now make the dressing a day or two before hand, not sure if it matters but it tasted amazing and I don't want to change a thing.

Wow, I made this for company.  I usually don't try something new for company but did this time based on all the positive reviews.  It was awesome.  I have already made it again for dinner the very next  night.  Excellent combination.  I added mixed berries instead of just cranberries.  It was still delicious.  I have a  new dish to  pass this summer!!!

Pretty good. We added Jalapeno Lime shrimp from the grocery store Seafood Dept for some protein. It was still missing just a little something though, and I can't quite put my finger on it. A good place to start, and I want to keep looking around for one  more ingredient to tie it all together. I'll have to look in the custom versions.

This is my favorite salad recipe. I make it for my family several times a month. It's magnificent as-is but I make the following changes to suit our preferences...I add bacon bits, blue or gorgonzola cheese, roasted pine nuts instead of almonds (I don't measure any amounts of any of these, I just throw it in and stir it up until it looks like a good ratio of goodies to spinach) I reduce the oil by 1/3 and use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Thanx Jamie!  I will never look for another spinach salad recipe!

This was the best salad ever!  The sweet/ tart goes perfect with smoked meat like ham.  Add diced chicken for a complete meal.  Don't skip the almonds... they make the salad! Even my 4 year old love this.

Took this to a party and everyone raved about it - even one person who doesn't usually like salads. I followed the recipe exactly, but added mandarin oranges and feta cheese. Fabulous!

We were looking to spice up our salad life when I came across this recipe. It is worth every ingredient. We make this so often now we hardly need a reminder of the ingredients or the amounts. Yummo!

This is an excellent salad that can be used year around with whatever fruit/nut you have available.  I recently tried fresh orange segments and toasted pecans - absolutely delicious! Other variations that have won my family over are: banana & pistachios/banana & almond/fresh peaches & almonds/apples & walnuts/pineapple & walnuts with toasted coconut.  I always add a few extra nuts!  I also use stevia in place of the sugar in the dressing.  This salad fits most any diet. The dressing makes the salad.

This was so delicious, quick and easy.  I didn't have poppy seeds, so I left them out and didn't miss them.  My kids didn't like the dressing, but I anticipated that and left some of the salad out when it was time to toss with the dressing.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

One of the very best salads I've ever eaten.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Absolutely delicious.  I only changed the almonds to toasted pine nuts and I would recommend you do the same.

This was very good!  We like balsamic dressings, but this is a nice variety too.  I added feta cheese and used toasted pecans for the nuts (love pine nuts but couldn't find them).

Best salad ever!!!!! I added some pears but didn't need them at all.  I will be serving this salad for years to come.  You must toast your almonds and sesame seeds to get the full effect of the salad.   Loved it!!!!!!!!

YUM. I understand why this is one of the top-rated salads. Don't alter it! I made the dressing as stated and thought it was delicious. Toasting the almonds adds such great flavor, do not skip that step! It makes a lot of dressing, more than you need. This will be my go-to salad from now on.

This salad was great, the dressing was definitely the best part! The only changes I would make for next time is to us much less butter for the almonds, they were covered in it and way too much liquid on them. I will definitely make this again, thanks!

I made this for lunch and added cubes of cooked chicken breast and feta cheese.   I didn't have almonds, so I used sunflower seeds.  It was excellent!

This will be making its second thanksgiving appearance in a row at our multi-family dinner. Fantastic. Absolutely declicious. I left out the poppy seeds, because I didn't have any last year, but maybe I'll try them this year. ALthough it was so good anyway, maybe I'll just stick with it as is....

UPDATE: So as promised, i tossed in some chicken to this salad (along with feta) AND IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! :) I'm eating the shrivled bits of spinach from last nights dinner. Thanks again!
ORIGINAL: I was impressed! There! I said it! I certainly had my doubts about this salad but after putting the final touches on the salad. HOLY MOLY! It was great! Do not skimp on the ingrediants! Several people told me that the almonds were what made this top notch. I did add feta cheese. gunna try again with some grilled chicken for a meal. seriously good!

I made this recipe for the first time for a dinner party last Saturday night.  It was a hit with even the men!  The only changes I made were some of the tips that I found helpful.  I added crumbled feta cheese, real bacon bits, and instead of suger, I used a bit less than 1/2 cup of Splenda to cut down on the carbs.  Making this again tonight for a friends birthday party!

This salad was excellent! The first time, I made it exactly as written. Then, for my second helping, I added a chopped Granny Smith apple; this addition made it even better. My husband added feta and he said that was great as well. Highly recommended.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  Every ingredient is perfect.  I mix spinach with spring mix salad & put the dressing on that.  I have bowls set around the salad that include toasted almond slivers, crasins, blue cheese crumbs, and madarin orange slices & chow mein noodles.  That way, people can put on the toppings they want.   This is a fabulous recipe & I have had nothing but compliments & requests for more!  :o)

I made this for the first time last week...and my husband has asked me for it every day since. Great way to get him to eat the spinach! I made the following changes: left out the poppy seeds and onions, substituted "regular" white vinegar for white wine vinegar, added extra cranberries and I threw the salad dressing ingredients into a glass jar with a lid and shook it rather than whisking it. Found it easier and probably just as tasty.

Delicious! But yes, you don't need that much sugar (half is enough) and also not that much oil, and serving the dressing on the side is a good idea since it makes rather a lot!  I also added dried strawberries, and substituted the onions with shallots.

So incredibly good. You don't need butter or oil or anything to toast nuts/seeds in a skillet, btw. Just vigilance :) This salad is also good with your favorite dressing (for picky eaters, or if you want convenience). I add croutons and often feta or blue cheese when I make this. And I make it several times a week! Thanks, Jamie!

MMmMM so good! I have been searching for a perfect spinach dressing for so long and couldn't find one at the store so thought I would try this recipe since it had a great rating and so many reviews!  I loved it! YUm! i have definitely found my official spinach salad recipe :)- Thanks Jamie!  I added reduced fat feta cheese, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I don't usually like poppy seeds so I left these out, but i left the toasted sesame seeds in and so good :) . I would probably add a little less sugar next time, 1cup of sugar left it too sweet for my personal taste.

I figured all those reviews couldn't be wrong...and I was right!!!  I used bagged spinach (2 9oz bags) and it was devoured at a party I took it too.  I also added drained mandarin oranges.

Have made this three times. It is a great salad, both refreshing and filling at the same time.  Twice now I have used a "shortcut" where I toast the almonds and the sesame seeds at the same time in the same pan with the tablespoon of butter (watch carefully, it goes fast and could burn easily). Then I pour a half cup of Cranberry Walnut or Raspberry Walnut ready made (Like Paul Newman's brand) salad dressing in a bowl, dump in the almond/sesame seed mixture and stir and then pour on the spinach and top with the cranberries. Very fast and easy.

dressing is quite tasty, but it does make a ton.  be sure to scale down if you are only feeding a few people.  i did not use poppy seeds but did use toasted sesame seeds.  goes will on any lettuce mix, not just spinach.

Outstanding!!! The most wonderful mix of flavors and texture. Those poppy seeds were the best thing about it. It did make a bit too much dressing but not a problem, I just added a little more spinach. my guests raved over this salad. Thankyou. It's a keeper.

I made this for a family get together.  I added feta cheese and that's the only alteration I did. Except toasting the almonds and sesame seeds in the oven.  I personally didn't like the taste of the salad, i thought it was too oily, but I'm rating this off of my family's opinion and they loved it.

This salad was delicious!!  I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it and several people asked me for the recipe.  I used half the sugar, used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil and added Gorgonzola Cheese.  It was AWESOME!  Going in my recipe box!

Pretty good dressing, especially for it being so simple with so few ingredients. I have to say though: the dressing for "Strawberry Spinach Salad I" (on this site) is better (I think its the Worteshire sauce that gives it the zing!)

This truly is a great recipe...I know it off by heart I've made it so many times.  TIPS:  I agree with the other users that toasting the almonds is a MUST.  I'm indifferent with toasting the sesame seeds -- sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  Also, I never add the sugar...instead I always dice up an apple (choose a sweet variety like GALA or FUJI).  I've also added a pear instead of an apple and still was a great salad!  Thanks for this recipe -- always a hit at my dinner parties..

Made it exactly as stated, except added blue cheese as suggested - it goes perfectly with this salad.  Do NOT omit toasting sesame seeds, it gives it a little Asian flair and it changes the whole taste without it.  The dressing keeps well in refrigerator. If you keep the salad items on hand, it's easy to pull out and make a quick salad.  I ate it five days in a row for lunch and still am not tired of it!  Thanks for my new favorite salad recipe!

A HUGE hit at our work potluck!! Prepped dressing night before...assembled just before serving. Impressed everyone!
Modifications: red wine vinegar (had on hand), purchased Oven Roasted Sliced Almonds, added a large can of Mandarin Oranges...and some bleu cheese for a little more depth. Wonderfully delicious!!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. This is my go-to recipe for salads- everyone always requests it!! I do alter it a bit: add blue cheese crumbles, mandarin oranges, craisins. I also toast the sesame seeds and almonds together in the oven until browned. I add onion powder in place of the minced onion (I actually prefer it taste and texture-wise better) And I use a mixture of red leaf lettuce, green leaf lettuce, and spinach. SOOOO yummy!!!!!!

This recipe provided the base for the best salad ever.  I substituted pine nuts (toasted with the sesame seeds at 350* for 10, no butter) for the almonds, used Craisins instead of cranberries, omitted the poppy seeds, halved the sugar and then added bleu cheese and mandarin oranges.  Everyone raved!

I've made this twice.  The second time was even better.  I omitted the poppy seeds and added mandarin oranges.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar - which gave the dressing a really nice flavor.  I also added pine nuts.  Very very good salad.

Made this earlier this week.  I don't eat a lot of meat and my daughter is a vegetarian.  The problem we have in our house is I have two big meat eaters, my wife and my son.  Trying to make meals that satisfy everyone can be difficult.  This is one of the few that did.  I added Turkey Bacon for them and also Blue Cheese crumbles.  As a main course I think at the least you should add Blue Cheese and maybe even red onions.  I also did substitute Pine Nuts for the almonds and it was excellent.  The only reason I did not rate higher was it would have been a bit bland without these additions.  I also put some cold mandarine oranges at the table for those that wanted them.  Honestly, you could even add some of some of those crunchy chinese noodles for texture if you are omitting any meat.

At the risk of sounding redundant this salad is outstanding!!  Took it to a potluck and have had to send the recipe out via e-mail to 4 different people today.  The bowl it was served in was picked clean!!  The greatest flavor and I didn't change a thing! Thanks for the recipe...

WOW!  I loved this and so did everyone who had it at a big group dinner I just had.  I followed the recipe as written except I chose to use a mixture of spinach and mixed greens and added in some crumbled gorgonzola cheese and it was a really nice compliment to the other flavors.  I toasted the almonds in the oven for a nice crunchy texture.  The dressing is fantastic.  I used more than 1 lb. of greens and this was plenty of dressing for it.  I made the dressing ahead of the party and kept in in the fridge in a small tupperware bowl.  When I was ready to serve I shook it up and tossed it with the salad.  Can't wait to make this one again.

Everyone loves this salad!  Whenever I make it there are no leftovers.  I  use craisins (regular, not the flavored ones) and I use Splenda instead of sugar. In addition to spinach, I  use  spring mix salad greens, which makes it really pretty.  I highly recommend this salad!

This salad was okay - but not worth the trouble (in my opinion.)  I'm going to try it again but with pre-packaged spinach salad and bottled salad dressing.  I did use craisins and they were great with the almonds.  I just wasn't fond of the dressing.

This was GREAT. I followed others suggestions of cutting the sugar and oil to 1/4 cup each, used "Craisins", added manderin oranges and toasted the almonds in the oven for 10 minutes at 350. Thank you fellow reviewers for the suggestions and thank you Jamie for the recipe!!!

This is absolutely deee-licious!!!The only thing I did different was to buy slivered almonds and toasted them myself in the toaster oven, thus omitting the butter and saute time. We have already had this several times and company just raves over it.  Simple, yet so good.

yeah- as you can see by the hundreds of other reviews- this is an awesome salad. I took it to a dinner party tonight, and had to come home and email every woman at the party the recipe! Just bring recipe cards if you plan on taking this salad anywhere-you will be asked for the recipe!!  Tried this as a meal-Sliced strawberries in place of cranberries, and added cooked chicken breast cut up into bite size pieces- everything else stayed the same.....YUMMY!!

I loved everything about this recipe.  I made it as is except I used pecan halves instead of almonds.  My husbands stepmom loved it too.  She said she gets tired of salads and said it was nice to have something new and refreshing.  She wants the recipe for the dressing.

OMG!  My husband ate salad!!  This got rave reviews from my whole family and for the first time ever my husband ate a salad and went for seconds.  To make it a meal by itself I grilled some chicken, sliced it and laid it on the top.  Ever so good!  I can't wait to make it again!

Made this last weekend and everyone loved it.  I added crumbled gorgonzola cheese and used organic romaine lettuce but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I may try to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested by others.

This salad is great.  We were so full from the meal, but couldn't stop eating the salad. I'll be making this frequently. I used Sunkist Almond Accents after someone mentioned them. They are roasted and sliced.  Tastes great and makes preparing this salad so easy.

This has quickly become a favorite at my house! I leave out the poppy seeds because I never have any and reduce the sugar to 1/3 c.  Last time I made this with 1/3 c. Splenda and red wine vinegar instead of white, and that also turned out great.

One more fabulous rating.  I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit for people who didn't want to gorge out on all the high-fat Thanksgiving norms.  I didn't have poppy seeds, only used 1/4 cup of sugar, and substituted apple cider vinegar for the white wine vinegar (b/c I didn't have any!).  Like I said before it turned out great.  I think I might try it with a little less vinegar next time or with the white wine vinegar.  I WILL be making this again!  Thanks Jamie.

This salad is a five stars to my husband and others I have made it for but it is way too sweet for me.  It just doesn't compliment a nice piece of steak because of the sweetness but everyone else seems to think it's great so I keep making it for them.

Spectacular! My husband & I agreed this is the best salad we've ever had. I recommend starting with 1/4 cup sugar as previous posters suggested, then adding more to taste. I wound up using 3/8 cup. Other than that, I didn't (and wouldn't) change a thing!

YUM!  YUM!  YUM!  This salad is fantastic.  I used olive oil in the recipe, and cut it down to about 3/4 what the recipe called for.  I also cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, as per other reviewers suggestions.  I had people that I normally have to FORCE salad on coming for seconds.  FANTASTIC!  We will make it again and again!

Very 'forgiving' - I overcooked the almonds, made a couple of substitutions (balsamic and red wine vinegars), and it still came out great.

Yum, Yum, Yum.  I made this for Easter and several times since.  It never lasts.  The first time I made it I didn't have enough cranberries so I did 1/2 cranberries and 1/2 dried cherries and it was great.  The last time I made it I substituted honey for the sugar and that was awesome too.  My husband actually went back for thirds!!!

I omitted the paprika, substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil, substituted the sugar for splenda and also cut the sugar amount in half.  Rather than frying the almonds, I sprayed them with a little olive oil and broiled them for a few moments in the olive.  Then I added grilled chicken on top.  My husband and I both very much enjoyed this healthy meal!  We’ll certainly be doing this again!!

This recipe was everything that reviewers said it was - absolutely delicious. I brought it to the in laws without trying it first (living life on the edge ;). Lucky for me it was a big hit - numerous requests for the recipe and emails later from the same people requesting it again - they werent just being kind.

Excellent recipe. Changes I made: substituted poppy seeds with toasted sunflower seeds, decreased sugar to 1/4 cup, used 1/3 cup red wine vinegar (whatever I found) instead of the 2 kinds mentined, and raisins instead of dried cranberries. Thanks Jamie for sharing this recipe.

This was an extremely delicious salad! I rinsed and drained store bagged baby spinach for quick salad making, dumped in dried cranberries, sprinkled feta cheese, used 1/4 cup olive oil instead of veggie oil, forgot the onion (but will use thin slices of raw red onion next time, and omitted the poppy seeds (didn't have any).  The dressing was very quick to make but found the sesame seeds did not survive being in the vinegrette for more than 3 days - so keep them separate until just before serving if you have left over dressing to store in your fridge! The toasted almonds were delicious, and a wonderful flavor to the salad.  I used "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter to toast the almonds, as that was all I had, and didn't notice the difference. I also lightly dry  toasted the sesame seeds in a pan - it made the flavor pop! will definately make it again, and will add different things such as mandarin oranges or sliced strawberries, or use thinnly sliced parmesan or asiago cheese instead of feta next time!

Excellent recipe!  A bit on the sweet side for us, so I would suggest cutting the sugar down to at least 1/3 cup.  To keep the salad for leftovers, reserve some of dressing for later and do not use it all on first batch.  Delicious.

This salad is SO popular!  Everyone I made it for absolutely loved it.  I did a couple of things differently from the recipe.  Instead of dried cranberries I used fresh strawberries that I quartered.  I also roasted the almonds in the oven without the extra butter at 350 degrees for 8 minutes stirring them after 4 minutes.  I toasted the sesame seeds in a 350 degree oven for 8 minutes, stirring them after 4 minutes.  It's easy to make the dressing in advance and just toss right before serving.  I don't even like spinach salad, but I liked this.  It's great for a crowd.  When I had to take a salad to a Passover seder last year this is what I made.  Everyone LOVED it.  In fact, it was specifically requested again this year.  It's really easy to multiply too.

Amazing salad. Only used 1/2 the sugar and it turned out perfect. You can save time by buying the prewashed, prepackaged spinach - instead of playing in the mud while you wash spinach bought in bundles. Also, you can save time by not toasting the almonds or seeds...still tastes great!

Oh my gosh, this is WONDERFUL! And so very easy. I used Splenda in the dressing, instead of sugar, and I also browned my almonds in fat-free butter and sprinkled them with Splenda to give them a sweet flavor without adding fat, calories or carbs. Delicious!

Excellent salad!  I used the new "Almond Accents" they sell in the grocery store to omit the toasting part & make it even easier to make.  I also used olive oil b/c it's better for you & used slightly less.  I've received SO many compliments & enjoy this salad time & time again!

I made this recipe for my family and everyone absolutely loved it! Due to a time constraint, I took a reviewer's advice and used Paul Newman's Balsamic Vinagrette and it turned out wonderfully.
The cranberries added a very nice flavor to the salad. I look forward to trying a variety of other fruits in this salad.
      Thanks, Jamie!

the sauce is great!! but I reduce the oil to 1/2 of the required amount.  Since I do not like spinach, I used romaine or iceburg lettuce.  It was a hit at our fellowship potluck.  thanks for the recipe

This salad was absolutely delicious.  I mixed one part spinach and one part field green lettuce and it still tasted great.  Next time I think I'll substitute the cranberries with a different kind of fruit.  Maybe pears?  Everyone at our dinner wanted this recipe! Update:  I've used this recipe for years now; usually mixing in different kinds of fruit.  It's amazingly simple and everyone always loves it!

This is great! I added some crumbled blue cheese and substituted Dawn's Candied Walnuts that I made (on this site) for the almonds and it was perfect!  I also served it in a 9x13 glass dish so that the nuts and cranberries didn't fall to the bottom.  I'm making it again for Christmas!!

Great recipe!  Made this the first time for a family cookout.  Have been asked to make it several times since then.  Everyone loved it!!  The only changes I made were I used spring mix instead of spinach and added feta cheese.

This was surprisingly GOOD!!! Everyone loved it and asked about it at TG dinner. It has a sweet and sour type thing going on and tasted nothing like I thought it would. Really Good!!! I just started what I hope will become a tradition of having TG at my house and this one is a keeper for my menu!!  Thanks :)

This recipe is awesome! It almost didn't make it to the table because we were eating it in the kitchen while waiting for the rest of the meal to cook. 
I took the advice of others and halved the sugar but I think next time I will decrease it a bit more as I found it still to be a little sweet if you use Craisins. I used dry toasted pinenuts instead of almonds and also added gorganzola cheese. This combination of flavours was fabulous! 
I didn't think however that the sesame seeds and poppy seeds added too much to the flavour of the dressing so I think I might try it without them next time.

Maybe there is something wrong with me, or maybe I did something wrong when making this dressing, but the dressing had way too much vinegar for my tastes.  I would not make this recipe again. Sorry.

Good reason this is in the top ten it is EXCELLENT  we are not big on sweet dressings so I took other reviews and cut down on the sugar,BUT I kept tasting the dressing and it seemed to oily, so I ended up putting the full amount of sugar in and it was FABULOUS would not change a thing!!

I wanted to like this recipe, I really did.  The first taste of it I thought "Wow!" because the poppy seeds and sesame seeds gave it a real kick of flavor.  But after a few bites the dressing was hurting my tongue because it was a bit too sweet and a bit too tart all at the same time.
The next day the spinach was soaked and even more unpleasantly too sweet and tart.

I made another batch a day later to bring to a party and followed the recipe amounts carefully. I figured maybe other will like it even if I don't.  Same thing for me.  Too sweet and too tart.  Hurt the roof of my mouth.  There was alot of good food at the party so the salad had tough competition.  It was only half eaten and I threw the rest out.

Not likely to make this dressing again.  A sprinkling of olive oil, sesame oil and sweetented rice wine vinegar does the same for me.

I have served this to company twice and to my family many times and every time it's been a huge success.  My 10-year old loves it, too.  It is a very attractive, colorful salad and easy to make ahead -- just wait until right before serving to add the dressing.

I was on salad duty for a NYE party and knew that for the crowd I'd be serving, romaine with a few tomatoes and some ranch dressing wouldn't fly. So I found this recipe and gave it a shot. After reading the majority of reviews, I decided that I'd reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup. I omitted the poppy seeds as I don't like them and toasted the sesame seeds and then the almonds in a dry pan. Dry toasting gives nuts & seeds incredible flavor, but be careful not to burn them or they'll turn bitter. I used just over a cup of Craisins and pre-packaged salad in a variety of types - mixed greens and lettuces. I pre-made the dressing sans oil, packed everything separately and just put it together at the party and dressed the salad there. I was really nervous as this was a blind recipe I'd never tried before. Personally, I found it much too sweet for my taste, but everyone LOVED it! It was almost entirely gone.
Be sure to state to everyone you're serving that there are almonds in the salad. I had two guests that were allergic to walnuts but almonds turned out to be fine. It was something I just hadn't considered, so definitely be aware. Anyone can throw a salad together with a bottled dressing. But people obviously really like this salad WITH the dressing recipe given, so I'd recommend people try making the dressing.
Oh, and dress the salad initially using 3/4 of the dressing. Using the whole amount seemed like way too much and it wilts fast.

I made this for the rest of my family - as I really do not enjoy nuts.  But let me tell you - even I gobble it up every time I make it!  Super easy to make.  Definitely my "go-to" salad when I have people over.

OK, I know your not supposed to put 5 stars if you change the recipe, but I just had to do it for this one.  I followed the advice of some reviewers and used toasted pine nuts instead of the almonds, Craisins instead of the cranberries, just 1/4 cup sugar, and added blue cheese crumbles.  I served this at our family's Easter brunch.  Outstanding!  Highly recommend.

Husband and I loved it but it was way too sweet. Next time I make this I will use less cranberries and a tablespoon of sugar. Even this amount of sugar may be too much.

Outstanding!! Followed recipe exactly. Wouldn't change a thing.

04/2016 Update: I've made this dozens of times, according to recipe, but tonight (after having not made this for a couple of years) I found the oil was overpowering. Will try again with another user's advice:
Fantastic! The only changes I made is I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, and the oil to 1/4 cup as well. I will be making this alot!

I made this tonight for the first time and followed the advice of others by toasting pine nuts along with the sesame seeds in a little bit of butter. Threw in some feta crumbles for a little tang. My guests RAVED. Incredible how easy this was. My new go-to!!!

The dressing for this salad is very good.  I use 1/4 cup of sugar and the rest as written.  This is my go-to recipe when I need to bring something for a pot-luck.

I made this for Christmas because I wanted a simple salad for those that wanted some greenery. Well, this turned out so tasty that even people who normally don't bother with salads thought it was great and it was the first thing to run out. I did not use all the dressing, so just dress to your tastes. I also did not use poppyseeds but it still came out great. The toasted sesame seeds and almond slivers make the dish.

We absolutely loved this salad. We had it last week with grilled Teriyaki chicken breast on the side. I bought a bag of the cranberry and slivered almonds that they sell at the grocery store in the fresh vegetable department. It worked out perfect and was a time saver. Having the entire meal again this week!

This salad is sooooo good!!  Easy and most of all delicious!! It's good with or without added cheese. The dressing is wonderfully flavorful and I love the toasted almonds. I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit! My boyfriend absolutely loves it and asked me to make some of the dressing to keep on hand for other salads we have. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I would like to try making this with Splenda sometime as a healthier alternative.

Thanks to jteam for her review.  Ditto to what she said about making changes -- you are not reviewing the recipe as presented!  I, for one, was extremely happy with the recipe as presented.  It was outstanding -- even my young grandchildren asked for seconds.

I have had this dressing before in a restaurant and the chef gave me the recipe but it made a gallon so was so happy to find the right measurements! I toast my almonds in the oven to reduce the oil and use strawberries and manderin oranges from a can, adding the juice to the dressing in order to add a little citris flavor. Excellent!!

Excellent!  To cut down  calories, I toasted almonds in the oven without the butter.  Used 2 Tbsp honey (warmed) instead of the sugar and used 1/4 cup olive oi.  It was still very delicious and cut the calories in half!

Great Salad! I made this salad for a party and it was finished off quickly. The one thing I didn't like was the almonds and cran-raisins and almonds sink to the bottom. So I carried It to the party upside down so when I flipped it right side up all of the stuff was nicely at the top.

Too many ingredients for my budget/skill level, but the spinach/cranberry/almond combination is gold. I made the salad with four ingredients - blanched slivered almonds (I toasted them with butter in a saucepan as directed), dried cranberries, spinach leaves, and Newman's Own balsamic vinaigrette. It was delicious!

I made this for a Canada Day party and everyone liked it.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I reduced the butter and toasted the almonds in a fry pan. The almonds and dressing were made earlier in the day! This is a great salad and feeds 8-10 people!

Now this is a great salad.  Outstanding taste and simple to fix.  Follow directions as they are and you'll be the hit of whatever you fix this for.  Only consideration as an extra would be to add glazed pecans in addition to the original recipe.  Hands down one of the best spinach salads ever....trust me

We love this salad. I make the dressing as suggested here, it's delicious, and I add feta cheese, half a can of mandarin oranges, and instead of toasted almonds I use Sugar Coated Pecans (recipe from this site). I make a big batch of pecans and keep them in a Ziploc bag in the freezer, then I can just pull a few out and add them to this salad about 10 minutes before we eat it - it comes together in a hurry. Great recipe.

We added mandarin oranges and feta cheese and replaced the almonds with toasted pine nuts.  We also used a bottle of premade balsamic vinaigrette instead of making dressing and the salad got RAVE reviews.

This is fairly average. Could use some other flavors other than sugar and some minor almond crunch.

Salad was good, I roasted almonds in oven and also added feta to the salad. We didn't really like the dressing tho, I used less sugar than called for and it was still too sweet for our tastes. My friend however did like the dressing, so it def is about personal taste:)  Glad I made the dressing separate, ended up using ranch instead and thought it was way better:)

This was pretty good.  I didn't like the sesame and poppy seeds in it.  Made the dressing texture kind of weird without adding any flavor.

Absolutely delish! I cut the recipe in half for 2 of us and we ate it all! Next time I will add a little less sugar as I found it just a tad too sweet. My husband, a non-vegie, loved it! Looking forward to making it again.

This dressing has a crazy amount of sugar in it, so I might try it with less next time, but I will say I followed the directions and it was realllllly good. We had a dinner party and everyone ranted and raved over the salad. It was so simple! Thanks for sharing!

YUM, this salad is very delicious! I was in a rush so skipped toasting the seeds and nuts. I also replaced sugar with organic agave, artery clogging vegetable oil with olive oil  and didn't have white so used red wine vinegar instead. I've added various veggie topping too, despite the salad is always equally amazing. I can see this one becoming a staple!

I thought from the reviews that I'd be wowed by this salad, but it was more "meh" for me.  It's a fairly standard salad, and the dressing was fine but not amazing.

Good salad. Used fresh raspberries that I had on hand instead of cranberries. Omitted the poppy seeds since I didn't have any. My family loved this salad.

I understand why this recipe has over 2,100+ reviews and over 94,000+ saves.  It is delicious!  I made this salad to go with lasagna and it was well received by everyone at my dinner table.  I had leftovers and they were good the next day also.  It made more dressing than what I needed, but it kept well and I used it later in the week on additional salads.  This is a great dressing and I have since made a double batch just to have on hand.  It is delicious on all types of greens.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  A friend gave us a huge container of spinach as well as a handful of clementines.  Using what I had in the house: used 3 cuties, and added feta, chix and One Ton chips to my salad.  We didn't have cranberries or almonds.  We all loved it!  Thank you!

I usually don't review recipes, but this one was fabulous!!!  Didn't have time to toast the almonds, but I'm sure that would make this salad that much better.  Normally I'm a minimalist when it comes to dressing/sauces, but I was practically licking the bowl on this one--it's that good!!  I did cut down a little on the sugar and oil, per other reviewers, but left everything else the same.  Don't leave anything out--each ingredient adds another depth of flavor and contrast.  You won't be disappointed!

Everybody loved this, and it's a "pretty salad" that I serve in my big wooden salad bowl.  I make the dressing earlier in the day, and use two 5-oz packages of the prepackaged spinach salad to save time.  I toasted the almonds earlier in the day as well.

Understand why so many like it, but definitely not my favorite salad. Love the cranberries in it. I'm not used to putting the sweetness into my salads. But ya... I didn't think was a 5 star salad... But it is worth a try!

Just made this for as a Christmas dinner side and it was a big hit!  Definitely will make again, though I may reduce the sugar a bit. Seems like I could easily get away with it w/o diminishing the flavor.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now and for a salad on the sweet side, it's perfection. If you're looking for just the right balance of sweet, salty, sour, crunchy, chewy, tender and smooth, look no further. I like to make the dressing a day ahead just to give the flavors time to meld.

I found this recipe too fussy. I didn't like the dressing or the cranberries in the salad. I didn't think it was terrible, but probably won't use this recipe again.

So colorful and delicious for Christmas dinner. I had some leftover. So, the next day  . . . heated it in the microwave, drained it, and served it as a hot vegetable. Also delightful. Thanks for this great recipe.

This salad is fabulous. I have made it twice this year, Thanksgiving and Christmas to two different crowds. It gets rave reviews. Its so simple and I usually have all the ingredients. How often do you get compliments on a green salad? You will with this recipe.

I served this to a meeting this week and a dozen people devoured a doubled recipe. I had to use pine nuts as one person has a nut allergy. I will be making this again but I'll be cutting back on the sugar and/or using a different sweetener as it was way too sweet for my taste.

Wow! Amazing! I did not add the almonds or sesame seeds (not a fan). Also used spring mix in place of just spinach. De-lic-ous!!! I'm bringing this to Christmas Eve dinner and I'm sure it will be a hit. Cranberries add a nice touch! Probably add some mandarin oranges to it as well. Oh also used fresh onions instead of dried minced. You will NOT be disappointed!

I find that I don't need to use the entire serving of the salad dressing and can save it for future salads.  I love this salad and often find myself looking forward to the next time I have it.

Another positive response to the salad.  I (of course) made a few small adjustments.  With baby spinach, there was no need to rip or tear pieces, which I liked. Also, Instead of sesame seeds, I substituted pine nuts.  In addition to the dried cranberries I added Mandarin oranges and feta cheese.  I took it to a potluck and everyone commented on how GOOD THE SALAD smelled.  It's important NOT TO CHANGE OR SUBSTITUTE THE BUTTER ROASTED ALMONDS.

After reading the reviews I was excited about contributing this salad to a pot luck dinner. I bought all of the ingredients and enthusiastically prepared this dish down to a t. The dressing tasted like watery ground onion... never grate onion! I didn't think the ingredients complimented each other at all. I'm not sure what I could have changed to make it any better. I love every ingredient involved but it just didn't come together.  To suggest a better alternative would be a different salad all together. This recipe has taught me to never trial a new recipe before trying it myself beforehand.

This salad is amazing. The only change I made was to add the mandarine oranges.  This salad is worthly of more than 5 stars!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was such a hit, I made it again for our "leftover dinner" the next day.  Wonderful salad!  I took the advice of the "most helpful" review and added the container of bleu cheese.  I will make this again and again - might try adding some grilled chicken strips to make it a main course.  Thanks, Jamie!

Made for thanksgiving and was great.  I took other's advice and cut back to 1/4 c. sugar. I used white vinegar and cider vinegar with the oil but only used about half of the dressing on the salad, cuz it didn't seem to need any more than that.  I will be making again, Thanks for the recipe

This was the highlight of our Thanksgiving dinner!  Unfortunately it set the bar very high for the rest of the food which was okay!  I will definately make this a part of my dinner party offerings.

Prepared this salad for Thanksgiving dinner at my church today.  It received rave reviews and several ladies asked for the recipe.
It was so easy to make and a joy to eat!  :-)
Will definitely make this one again.

Great salad.  Used this for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was a nice alternative to the normal salad.  I toasted the sesame seeds and almonds separately in a dry pan on top of stove so didn't have to use the butter. Cut sugar down to 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet. Also, added some crumbled feta which was a definite plus.  Also, used red onion instead of white just because. Served in parmesan bowls I made. Yum!

This recipe is great! It's really simple and sophisticated. I found it too sweet though, so next time I will halve the amount of sugar. To make it vegan, instead of using butter to toast the almonds I used Burgundy cooking wine. It have a nice depth to the almonds. I used white vinegar, but I'm not sure if its white wine vinegar. I used a red onion for the onion, since it is more tangy and less bitter when uncooked. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make it healthier, and while the olive oil flavor doesn't always work I found it did very well here! I will definitely make this recipe again! Thank you.

I took this to a get-together where it got great reviews - and NO leftovers!  I tossed the cranberries and almonds prior to adding the dressing but they all sunk to the bottom, so I redid it and layered the spinach, almonds & cranberies in a 9x12 glass pan and sprinkled with some gargonzola for color.  I substituted Splenda/sugar blend for the sugar.  Poured the dressing on just before serving.  I will definately make this again!

This is a great EASY salad to make.  I got rave reviews from the church group I shared it with.  I did add toasted pumpkin seed, because I had them and thought they would compliment the flavors. I  will probably include them from now on in the salad. This will definately make a return visit to our group, and my family table.  GREAT!!!!

This is a 5 star recipe for a reason.  Everyone wanted the recipe- and I was the LAST to arrive at the potluck I took it to.  I made all the dressing it called for but didn't use it all so the salad didn't get too soggy.  This is a must-have for the recipe box!

This salad is excellent for a formal or informal meal. I sauteed the almonds and sesame seeds in butter on top of the stove. The only suggestion I can make is that if you can find time, do not sautee the almonds and sesame seeds until the last minute. My guests loved the aroma!!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for a while and finally took the plunge. Being a single girl who is afraid to operate her stove this recipe was perfect! :) I added some feta cheese crumbles to give it an extra kick and it worked out perfectly. I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow for lunch!  :) I give this recipe a definite 5 stars!

This is delicious! I wanted to make it into a very healthy, full meal. To that end I used agave nectar instead of sugar and only used 1/4 c. I also added 2 c. cooked quinoa and 12 oz. cooked chicken breast. I dry roasted the almonds and sesame seeds. Used 1/2 t. onion powder instead of minced onion. Finally, I had no white wine vinegar so I used white balsamic instead.  FANTASTIC!! This was a very filling meal (when I ate 2 portions!).

This recipe is great. I made it for dinner tonight and followed all the directions as written. Next time, I will add some gorgonzola crumbles. Not because the salad is lacking anything, I just really like gorgonzola with salads that have some sweetness to them.

This is awesome!  I made a couple changes based on other reviews, mainly to save on time.  Toasted sliced almonds (purchased in the bulk section of the grocery store) in the toaster oven, bag of baby spinach, 6oz Craisins, forgot the sesame seeds, and used Newman's Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Very yummy!!!

I didn't have all the ingredients for this so I improvised (no almonds) (used balsamic/red wine/distilled vinegars) but this was REALLY delicious! I can't wait to make it again with all the correct ingredients!

Very good salad, but makes a lot of dressing.  I would cut down the suggested amount of sugar as it was quite sweet, especially with the cranberries.

I had some toasted sesame seeds and almonds so I used them.  I always toast nuts in a non-stick pan and never use any oils or butter.

Wonderful flavor overall, and I will make this again as it was pretty good!

This salad is not only healthy but has the wonderful blended tangy and sweet flavors of roasted almonds, cranberries and sesame seeds. Everybody that tried the salad wanted the recipe.

this is so tasty, I have made it many times. goes great with pork, but any meat really... 

I usually use some feta or some blue cheese, have used crumbled goat's milk cheese, ect. .. I just sprinkle it ontop of the salad ...

I use pine nuts, they have more of a nutty flavor, but that's just preference.

you can't go wrong with this one if you want a nice, presentable salad for your table  :)

I have made this many times & always get asked for the recipe. Quite often use the dressing on simple mixed greens with cranberries, mangoes, or fresh berries & sugared almonds or pecans. Everyone loves it.

I served this salad twice over Thanksgiving weekend and everyone loved it!  I used unsalted oven roasted almond slices from a package instead of roasting them (saved time and no butter) and the second time used half Splenda and half sugar.

Made this for a potluck today at work and it was a huge hit.  Everyone that tried it LOVED IT!  To be fair to the recipe, I made it exactly as posted and it was fantastic.  It took only minutes to prepare.  I put the spinach, cranberries and toasted almonds in a large covered bowl and then the dressing in seperate container to transport to work. I just tossed it all together moments before the potluck started.  So easy and so good.  thankyou for making me look like a star :)

I brought this salad to work with me one day for lunch and my coworkers ended up eating it! It's delicious! The only thing I did different was add 1/4 a cup of sugar 1/4 cup oil. I used craisins as well. If I could give it more stars I would!

Loved this salad!! The only thing I did different was I did not use butter when toasting the almonds & put a whole cup, (love almonds!), & instead of 1/2 cup sugar I used 1/2 tsp of NOW Liquid Stevia.  Otherwise, followed exactly & everyone loved it!!

Excellent salad and dressing. The salad itself was very simple; nothing terribly unique about it. But the dressing! Oh my, the dressing! Really, really good! For the salad, I used Spring Mix rather than just spinach. And for the dried cranberries, I substituted a mix of dried cherries, cranberries, and raisins instead. That's all I had. And instead of the almonds, I used pumpkin seeds that were dried and then sauteed in seasoned butter. Used olive oil in the dressing instead of just canola or vegetable oil. The dressing was so flavorful, not too sweet, and really just perfect. This one's a keeper.

Awesome..dry roasted sesame seeds and almonds separately using med. low heat in a fry pan (stirring constantly).  No butter required.  Used light tasting Olive Oil instead of vegetable.  Added cooked shrimp as well.  Would be great with grilled chicken I'm sure.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it was excellent.

I thought this was good, but could be better.   Like other people suggested, the almonds can be toasted in the oven.   I made this salad for my family of 3 and my son didn't want any, my husband only a bit. I had dumped all the dressing onto the salad and mixed it up. All the leftovers were pretty mushy and way over dressed.  Next time I will make the dressing and put it in a jar to add individually. I think this can use a lot less dressing, and less calories!

Best salad dressing EVER.  I cut the sugar to slightly less than half and WOW - so good.  Don't skip toasting the almonds and seeds - makes a huge difference. Thank you for this - I am currently learning to eat better and this recipe is the bomb!

This salad has become a staple in our house!  Once I fixed it for my parents, it became a staple for them too.  I add crumbled feta cheese on top before serving and it is wonderful!!  This salad is great with any meal.

Dressing is sweet, but we like it that way.  Be sure to toast your sesame seeds (I do them together with the almonds).  Very very nice salad.  The surest way to get the meat-eater in my house to eat his veggies, this is his favorite.

I really love this website because I can trust if a lot of people have rated a recipe highly that the recipe will come out and I can serve it to company without needing to test it first.  This was the first recipe from here that I was embarrassed to serve company, I thought it tasted really sweet, not like a salad should, and I couldn't even eat it myself.

I JUST made this and OMG, it was fantastic.  My changes were as follows: I didn't use almonds or toast any, I used pecan pieces.  Cut down the sugar to 1tbsp (there's enuf sugar in the cranberries), and also cut the vegetable oil to 1/8 cup.   I also used dried onion (2tsp) instead of fresh.    At the end, I added crumbled Goat cheese, as I have to have cheese in EVERYTHING.  It turned out amazing. This is definitely a keeper of a recipe, and I promise you won't be able to put the bowl down to write the review.  I wasn't even out of the kitchen yet and I finished the salad.   THANK YOU!

The dressing makes this salad. Putting a bottled dressing on it or drastically changing the recipe would make a completely different salad. One would then be rating another recipe, right? Other than cutting calories by omitting butter or oil or reducing sugar, don't change a thing. The flavors in this salad are meant to be this way.

A very delicious salad! My whole family loved it. I reduced the sugar in the dressing because it was a little too sweet the first time I made it. 1/4 cup does the trick. I also broiled the almonds in a pan with some butter and sprinked with sugar to give them an extra candy crunch. Then i  chopped up some bacon as an extra edition which was DELICIOUS. The salt in it balanced the sugar and made a world of differance. A perfect start to a meal..or as a light meal itself!

Simple, easy and delicious.  You can use walnuts or pecans instead of almonds.  I also add blue or gorgonzola cheese.    I find the dressing ratio to be a bit off for my taste.  I only use 1/4 cup of cider vinegar and leave out the white wine vinegar, but as others have said, any vinaigrette will work here.  As a main dish, you can add some grilled chicken chunks.

I  love salads, but did not care for this one. Followed the recipe exactly except I did not have the poppy seeds. Harsh vinegar flavors, did not like the vegetable oil and too sweet. Will not be making it again.

Yum! This is my go-to spinach salad recipe. I have yet to make it with sesame seeds because I haven't had any on hand. I also brown the almonds in a skillet over medium-high heat w/out butter.

Mahvelous, simply mahvelous!!! I made this for an informal family dinner for 16 people. Everyone loved it! I used raw turbinado sugar because I was out of white and used EVOO instead of vegetable oil. Threw in some mandaring oranges, too. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. Several guests said they don't usually eat spinach salad but this was delicious!! I put some of the leftover dressing on cold salmon the next day and it was incredible. I think the dressing could be used for many different dishes, not just on salads.

I agree with some of the other posters - use balsamic vinegar. I also used cherries instead of cranberries and it was delicious. A restaurant near me make this salad and adds blue cheese and uses walnuts instead of pine nuts - also very yummy and a bit sweeter.

Reviewer - WOW! AWESOME! TIME saver tips: use Paul Newman's balsamic vinagrette instead of making your own dressing. MONEY saving tip: use "Craisins" dried cranberry fruit instead of regular dried cranberries. Use can of mandarin oranges instead of poppy seeds. THIS WAS A HIT!

Yum, yum, yum!  In reading the ingredients, I thought this would be a bit too sweet, and  I did cut back on the sugar just a bit.  It was perfect.  Everyone loved it!  I will cut back on the amount of cranberries next time and will look to add some sort of cheese.  Maybe a nice creamy neutral goat cheese that can take on that yummy dressing. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night and had it for dinner and found it to be okay. I'm having it now for lunch the next day and the dressing tastes a lot better! Followed the recipe exactly but added some feta cheese to the main salad.

I made this for a potluck dinner party that I decided to go to last minute....It was the center of attention. Who would have thought that such a simple salad would be such a charmer? It was just perfect. TIP: don't over-do the dressing. I made a batch for my fiance and I a couple weeks later, and really ruined it with too much dressing.

Oh my word. This is so good. I know it doesn't need a five star review, but I just had to write one anyway. It's very versatile - instead of almonds, I've used sunflower seeds, cashew pieces,and pecans (not all at once!). I've used raisins instead of cranberries. I've added mandarin oranges. But it's the dressing that really carries this one over the top. I use 1/2 c red wine vinegar and no cider vinegar, and Splenda instead of sugar. It's absolutely perfect. I mix up a whole recipe, but don't use the dressing until I'm ready to serve it. It holds up very well in the fridge for about 3 days this way, and I've been known to eat it for breakfast. 5 stars, at least.

I sort of made-do with what I had to make this for dh's work lunch. I dry roasted pine nuts (all I had) and only used poppy seeds as I ran out of sesame. I also added some full fat Danish feta (yum!) and chopped, poached chicken breast. I used a packet mix of baby spinach and rocket and because this is a very green salad, I asked him later what he thought of it. He said it was really great and the dressing worked well. 4 1/2 - 5 *. So, I'll give it a 5. This salad is going to be easy peasy to give him as dried cranberries don't really go bad, nor seeds, nor nuts and just add a bit of cheese and meat and I'm good to go.

We didn't have any White Wine Vinegar, so I substituted half white whine + half rice vinegar to make up for this missing ingredient.  It worked out beautifully... I was actually surprised it all got eaten up when I brought it for our family christmas get-together and my entire family (even the picky ones who don't like spinach) loved it and asked for the recipe!!

This is another one of those dishes that is sooooo good. My family likes to try new dishes on the holidays and a couple of years ago I made this. My sister immediately asked for the recipe and makes it for herself although she lives alone. I've made it several times and it is tangy and delicious; best served immediately as it's not quite as tasty after it sits.

This truly is the BEST salad!!  I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving for around 34 people - everyone raved about it and i got numerous requests for the recipe.  I followed the recipe to a tee with the exception of adding blue cheese.  I now eat this salad at least two times a week - it is SO SO SO good!!

It was very good! Blanching and slivering the almonds is quite a chore though. Also, I think next time I'll use 1/2 the amount of suggested dressing. It was totally drenched.

This was a complete and total hit and the only thing to be completely devoured by the dat after Thanksgiving.  Even the kids liked it!  The only thing I did differently was use rice wine instead of wine vinegar and used a little extra apple cider vinegar for kick.  Luscious and beautiful!

Very, very good.  I added crumbled bacon to the salad.  Next time I will cut the dressing ingredients in half if I am not planning on making another salad in a few days.  The dressing and the dried cranberries are what makes this salad awesome!

Just toasted almonds in dry skillet, but was delicious!!! So easy and delicious! Definitely something you could add more veggies to also like some raw broccoli or something.

This salad is delicious.  It has just the perfect amount of sweetness, yet its so tangy.  The only thing I change is tossing all the dressing with the salad.  I keep it on the side because once the dressing is on the spinach, the leaves start to wilt instantly.  So when you keep it separate, you can save the dressing for leftovers.  Very yummy!!

Tremendous as written.  I've also tried a number of the suggestions read in these reviews and loved every one of them.  I like to add a sliced grilled chicken breast (or tuna, salmon, or tilapia steak) on top for a full light meal.  This is a staple meal in my home!!!

Holy ...this salad was THE BOMB!  I added cucumber slices, red onion rings, two tomatoes, a whole bag of Craisins, a bag of honey almond slices, and some feta cheese (but didn't put the poppy seeds).  I also put a clove of garlic in the dressing and used Splenda equal to about 1/4 cup instead of sugar.  I was told this salad was "slap your mama good" :)

Delicious!! I make a lot of salads as a vegetarian and am always combining ingredients in different ways, and this salad is amazing! I added crumbled blue cheese, used half arugula and half baby spinach, used walnuts instead of almonds, and added chopped green apples. The dressing is the perfect flavor compliment to the salad. This one is going in the recipe box for sure! I think I may serve it for Thanksgiving as well. Thank you, Jamie!

I will make this over and over.  The key is the dressing which I followed exactly.  I did add to the salad, seasoned feta cheese, chicken breast and mand. oranges.  I will modify contents of salad to turn into a meal, but not the dressing - excellent.

Wow.  I was totally skeptical--how does a salad get all those great reviews?  All I have to say is don't knock it till you try it.  Why in the world is this so FANTASTIC?  I don't know--but it is. (I used 1/2 Splenda instead of all that sugar and no-trans-fat margarine, but the rest is exactly the same.)

Incredible!  I served this at a BBQ and people wouldn't stop talking about how delicious it was!  I did take other reviewers' advice and added the sesame seeds & almonds at the very end.
Thanks for sharing!

YUM-O!  I love salad at restaurants but never have made one that I enjoy at home.  But this salad is delicious!  I added crumbled blue cheese, strawberries, and cashews.  Everyone loved it!  I can't wait to make it again!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!!  *****5 STARS*****

i made this last week for my bf and he loved it... after reading the reviews i also cut back on the sugar... i served the dressing on the side - i mixed it all in my salad dressing shaker and just shook it up really well... i also topped the salad with goat cheese which was a great addition to an already yummy salad... :)  i'll definitely make this again.

I've made this twice--once for my family and once for co-workers. It went over extremely well both times. This is a GREAT salad! I read through previous reviews to see what other people added or changed, and based on the reviews I made some changes myself. I omitted the poppyseeds (only because I didn't have them), added mandarin oranges, and added some feta cheese. I used Craisins for the cranberries. I didn't use the butter on the almonds--I just toasted them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes. I added some garlic powder to dressing, and I grated the onion instead of mincing it. It's also important to let the salad sit for 20 minutes or so with the dressing on it before serving. This salad looks pretty on the plate with all of the colors, and it is SO good. I can't get enough of it! I didn't realize how much I could like spinach!

This recipe is the BOMB!!!! Super easy to make. I made it for the 1st time for a get together with my girlfriends, they were licking their forks clean. I would add the sugar half at a time. You actually dont need all that sugar. Its just a matter of preference. Also the dressing  part makes alot, I added 2 more bags of baby spinach.. Also I had feta cheese on the side and all my guests added a spinkle on thier plates.. Yum Yum !! enjoy :)

Great recipe!
I marinaded chicken in the dressing (and added some additional onions to the marinade), cooked the chicken in a frying pan, and tossed it with the salad. Then served inside a wrap. Went over great!

A very versatile salad mix and worthy of the ratings. I did use the Paul Newmans Light Balsamic Dressing as I was rushing but will try the dressing as written for the next round.

Excellent Recipe!  The only thing I changed was I substituted the almonds 
for cashews and also sugar coated 
almonds. I didn't have sesame seeds and
used celery seed. Rave reviews from everyone!
Thank you for the recipe.

A party hit! I used oven toasted pine nuts instead of almonds and craisins, and I added blue cheese. I also found the dressing a bit too sweet for my taste and ended up adding more vinegar and oil to "water it down". Next time, I will add less sugar, probably only half of what the recipe calls for.  We all LOVED the end result.

Reduce sugar to 1/4 cup, I do spinach with cranberries, feta cheese and just regular slivered almonds.  Delish!

simply amazing recipe. made it for the first time over the summer for a dinner party and it was the biggest hit there. since then everyone begs me to whip this up when ever there's a get together. the only thing i've come to change is to add a bit for almonds and cut back on the sugar. thanks so much!

It was amazing!!! I bought oven roasted almonds and added crumbled blue cheese as suggested.  It was delicious!  I didn't cut back the sugar and it was perfect.  I started adding half the sugar of what the recipe asked for and tasted it and kept on adding more sugar until I realized I should just follow the recipe exactly as it says.  Simply delicious and very easy!!!

Try adding a thinly sliced slightly tart apple for added crunch.  Also, for a slightly different take, I'll substitute pomegranate seeds instead of cranberries.   Have found that filling a mixing bowl about halfway with water and separating the pomegranate seeds from the skin in that helps to keep the bright red juice from splattering!  Enjoy!

My husband and I LOVED this!!  I have to admit I sometimes overlook the recipes that have tons and tons of reviews.  I finally tried this one because I had some spinach to use up and I had all the ingredients.  I was sorry I hadn't tried this recipe sooner!  I tried it a week ago and have made it three times this week.  And I usually don't repeat recipes.  I didn't toast the sesame seeds, but did toast the almonds.  I also used red wine vinegar instead of cider.  Then I ran out of red wine so the next time I used balsamic, and that was great too.  I also use a red onion for the onion, which added great bits of color.  The salad is great as-is, but I added crumbled gorgonzola to my plate and shredded parm to my husband's.  That just took it over the top!  I find myself wanting this salad often.  Now I always have the ingredients on hand to whip it up.  Oh, I cut the sugar in half.  I think it would be way too much otherwise.  I also use a good-quality olive oil.

Wow!  This was a fantastic salad.  Everyone loved it.  Using suggestions from other reviewers, we served individual salads and let each person pour their own dressing.  The recipe makes a lot of dressing!!  Thanks.

It was good, but didn't live up to my expectations. After reading all these reviews I was expecting an incredible masterpiece!
My husband wasn't a very big fan of it.....

I added blue cheese crumbles and I think that was the salad's saving grace-I'd highly recommend adding them.
I also added the mandarin oranges, but my husband hated that part.

He said it tasted like it wasn't suppposed to be in it.

I might make it again (but not for my husband!) but I'm going to keep looking for better salads....

I'd recommend the Roquefort Pear Salad before this, for sure.

Fabulous! I took some other members' suggestions and cut down the sugar to 1/4 c, used Craisins, and topped it with blue cheese. It was wonderful. I took it to a party and everyone raved about it! Wonderful! Next time I am going to use Splenda instead of sugar.

Yum!  Made pretty much like recipe, except added field greens with the spinach.  Also served with gorgonzola on the side for those who wanted it.  It was delicious with the cheese in it.  It would also be good with bacon in it.  Everyone in the group said that the recipe was a keeper!  I used the leftover dressing as a marinade for grilled chicken a couple of days later, and it was really good!

This salad was a hit at our sports banquet.  I served it with feta cheese on the side, for folks who may not care for it. Also, I used spring mix instead of spinach; I think it would be great either way.  I will make the dressing and keep it on hand for frequent use.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really loved this recipe.  I made it for my husband and he said he'd eat it whenever I wanted to make it.  I did change a few things simply due to convenience.  I omitted the paprika, used a spring mix instead of just spinach, used olive oil instead of veg oil and I had plain sliced almonds from the store.  I make it this same way everytime and it's just awesome!

An AMAZING salad! I was so pleased it came out perfect. I pan roasted almonds AND walnuts and then salted them. Let them cool then added to salad. Also I know some people don't want to make the dressing but it was really great and better than any you could buy. It took no time at all. I added green onions to the salad because I did not have onion seasoning. Also I only used 1/3 cup of sugar as the salad with cranberries was sweet enough. I suggest less sugar and MAKE the dressing yourself! PERFECT!

A great spinach salad. My family loves all the 'goodies' in salads, so this went over very well with them. I think I'll try baking the almonds next time instead of toasting them with butter in a skillet.

Wow, this is great!!!  I tried to follow the recipe to a "T" but realized I only had red wine vinegar and white vinegar.  I used those instead and it was still awesome.  I know this is a healthy recipe but it is definately not low fat.  That's ok, I splurged and we loved it!!

Excellent Recipe. I followed the advice of many reviewers and cut the sugar down by 1/3. It makes a fantastic dressing. I added some crushed  sugared pecans and bits of cranberry cinnamon goat cheese to the salad, it was a fantastic addition. This was a hit at my big family Christmas. Thanks so much Jamie!

followed the dressing recipe to a T.  This dressing cannot be beat.  You would not think it was anything special based on such basic ingredients but it is absolutely delicious!  used field greens instead of spinach.  The toasted almonds and cranberries are just yummy together.

I made this for a church dinner exactly as written & it got good reviews & the dish came home empty.
6/2010 Update: I've made this several times for family company and have even experimented with blueberries and walnuts instead of the cranberries and seeds. My husband was quite surprised with how good this turned out. Thanks for sharing Jamie!

I made this 2 nights in a row for different functions.  The first night I used toasted almonds, the second night I used walnuts.  It was delicious and a big hit both times.  I had intended to add feta to it as well, but forgot to take it with me.  I will try it with feta next time.  Thanks!!

This is great!  2 request for the recipe already.  I did use pecan pieces instead of almonds once but both times it was easy and awesome! Pecans are really great and you don't need to cook first.  Next time I'll try w/pinons.

I made this for a luncheon at work today and everyone RAVED about it and I've shared the recipe with several coworkers. It's great. I did reduce the sugar in the dressing and substituted balsamic vinegar because it's what I had on hand. Everything was wonderful! Another great rave!

I love this salad!  I make it often and always get rave reviews.  I usually use Splenda instead of sugar as I have several family members that have to watch their sugar intake and it tastes great.  I also offer feta cheese on the side for those that want it - I like it with or without.  I have also made this with baby spring salad mix when spinach wasn't available.  You just can't go wrong with this recipe!

This is excellent!!  Every time I make this everyone loves it.  Changes I made:
Only use 1/3 cup sugar - it's plenty.
I use baby arugula instead of spinach because I like the taste better.  And I use olive oil instead - a little healthier and is still delicious.

This dressing is so delicious!!  I've made it twice this week!! The only change to the dressing I made was to use olive oil the second time I made it instead of vegetable oil and it tasted the same.  I used canned mandarin oranges one time and cut up strawberries the next and it was out of this world both times!

The sesame seeds did not add much to this one, but DO NOT skip toasting the almonds in butter.  It really makes this salad.

This salad was amazing! It tasted just like the salad from Devon(one of my fave restaurants). Although I made a few slight changes. Instead of butter and vegetable oil, I used olive oil. Also, I added chicken and used pinot grigio for white wine vinegar. Overall, it was delicious!

This was really good.  The only change I made was to only put in (a little less than) 1/4 cup of sugar- it's just a personal preference.  make sure to toast the sesame seeds and the almonds- it makes a lot of difference in taste.  My husband suggested omitting the cranberries, adding apples, bacon and dates- I don't know.  I liked the cranberries.  We LOVED the dressing.

Made this for a barbecue I went to over the weekend.  Every bite was eaten!  Decided to use sugar-coated pecans (recipe on this site) instead of almonds.  I also added a 4 oz. container of crumbled blue cheese.  Excellent!

I have made this several times now.   I substitute splenda in the dressing and it works fine.  This makes alot, it doesn't hold well, so often I will put about 1/2 the dressing on 1/2 the salad, if I don't need the rest, still fresh for the next day.  A winner!

This salad is awesome!  I l-o-v-e-d, loved it!  My family did not care much for it, but I knew in advance that they probably woudn't.  It was just one of several side dishes at our Christmas get-together, so nobody went hungry.  Their lack of interest left much more for me!  The flavors work so well together, and it's so beautiful as part of a nice dinner.

A good, easy salad made with ingredients that I usually have on hand.  1/2 cup sugar makes it a little too sweet - I had to add more white wine vinegar to give it a little more depth.  I would use maybe a 1/4 cup or 1/3 cup the next time.

Really nice recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. Would be a wonderful light meal with grilled chicken or salmon.

very good. Toss 1/2 salad to 1/4 dressing.  Strawberry instead of crans.
Olive oil instead of Veggie.  Decrease oil to 1/3 cup.  Use 1/2C less sugar.  Add chunk chicken for dinner. Toast seeds and nuts at 350 for 8 mins, toss at 4 mins.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  In the summer, I substitute a 15oz. can of garbanzo beans and a pint of grape, or cherry, tomatoes for the cranberries.  The dressing needs to be modified to make up for the absence of the fruit sugar within the berries.  
   I found that changing it to 3/4 cup sugar and adding 1/3 cup ketchup keeps the flavor similar.  I have also used fructose sugar instead of white cane sugar; when doing this cut the amount in half.  In this recipe I only needed to use 1/3 cup plus a TBSP of fructose sugar to equal the 3/4 cup of cane sugar.  The sweet taste is the same with fewer carbohydrates and calories.

Very enjoyable salad. Sweet and tangy. I used half the sugar, 2-3 tablespoons olive oil, pomegranate seeds, and candied walnuts. I served this for Thanksgiving dinner and people are still raving about it days later. Thanks!

YUMMY!  The dressing is wonderful.  I even tried this with Splenda instead of sugar and it was great.  Had to eliminate the cranberries for my low-carb friend once too.  Added a couple sliced fresh strawberries instead. WOW, great recipe.

This recipe was delicious.  I served it during a football game dinner. My husband and my friend who do not like spinach, loved it.  Made it again within the week to serve to my mother-in-law and she loved it too!  Thanks for a wonderful new recipe.

Really really good.  The kids love it too, but they don't care for the cranberries so we serve them in a separate bowl. Good for any season since there isn't any fresh fruit in it.

Superb!  I made this recipe for the first time this weekend.  When our guests arrived, they were disappointed that I hadn't made the mandarin orange spinach salad (which they love); however, after tasting this salad, it has now become their favorite!  It was a huge hit, and I look forward to sharing it with others soon.

Brought this to an office birthday lunch to serve 20.  Doubled the recipe and everyone raves.  Thought it was a nice light dressing.  Entree was chili and it went great with it.  Emailed many the recipe.

This is a different and delicious salad.  I made it three times during the holidays and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe each time.  Toasting the almonds and sesame seeds is key.  It is absolutely delicious!  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Jamie!

Excellent, the entire family loved it at Thanksgiving; I used Balsamic vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar. The only thing I will do different next time is serve the salad with the dressing in a cruet on the side, if it doesn’t all get eaten quickly it becomes mushy and it’s too good to throw out J

Yummy and easy.  I have made this salad at least 5 times in the past month and everyone loves it and requests it... even those who dislike spinach! I used red wine vinegar instead of white b/c it was all I had and it was great.  I used 1/3 cup oil - seemed a little greasy with 1/2 cup.  This is defintely on the top of my list!

This is an excellent salad.  The first time I made it I found it far too sweet and now use about half the amount of sugar.

WOW!  Yum yum yum yum!  This was the best salad I ever made AND ever tasted!  I loved it so much that I hope to make it often enough to never need to look at the recipe each time!  The dressing is so good, too.  I cut back the amount of sugar a little and it was still very sweet, but I have a sweet tooth, so that was good for me.  This is going to become a signature salad for our family, I'm sure!!!

Excellent.  Gave half the salad to my next door neighbor and they raved about it.  I've made it with all different types of toasted nuts.  Do not add the dressing too soon or the spinach will get soggy.  Did halve the sugar (will try with Splenda) next time, and it was still delicious.

I followed this receipe very closely.  Both my husband and me thought the vinegar overwhelmed the taste of everything else and made the salad to sweet overall. Next time I make this I will find a ligter oil to add more of and reduce the vinegar by about 75%.  Otherwise, this actually was a tasty salad and I hardly even realised I was eating spinach-a plus in my book!  If you plan to keep this over one day, keep the spinach and cranberry mix separated from the dressing.  I think this could be a great way to get kids to eat their spinach (kids like me)!  There is anothr salad recipe on this website called strawberry and spinach that I plan to try and post a review of soon.

I made this for the 4th of July - it flew off the table!  I put the spinach, cranberries, and nuts together early, then added the dressing just before serving.  This didn't work very well because the spinach wilted.  I suggest keeping everything separate until serving.

I made this salad over the 4th of July weekend.  Non-salad eaters were eating it!!  I didn't change a thing. It's perfect the way it is.  A nice change from traditional garden salads.

Truly wonderful. Toasting the almonds is a must I think. I usually have a problem with dressings that are too tart and tangy, but this dressing was mellow and sweet (but not too sweet). It looks grand. I made it exactly as stated and found it perfect.  Yes, only dress the salad at the last minute, and only add just enough to lightly coat the leaves. Thank you so much for the recipe Jamie.

This recipe was OK, but not the best.  I thought there was too much vinegar in the dressing and not a lot of other flavors.  I have tried other salads similar to this and have been much more pleased with the results.

Delicious, especially if you like POPPY SEED type (sweet) dressings.  Just watch out not to pour too much on it as it could become a bit overpowering.  VERY VERY good salad!

I used mixed lettuce instead of spinach and added orange sections along with the dried cranberries.  I also did not use poppy seeds in the dressing.  Even with all the modifications, it was a delicious salad.  The dressing is great!

This is a gem of a recipe.. The contrast in flavors and the colors are fantastic..I used it at Thanksgiving was looking for a recipe with a new twist and found it. Young and Old, alike loved it. I think I will serve it with just a tad amount of dressing on it so it will glisten the leaves,and then let everyone put on more themselves. Thank you for sharing this recipe...

Fantastic flavor combinations.  Nice salad to accompany a large variety of main dishes.  Very attractive for a buffet or potluck table.  I'll be making this to serve at our Thanksgiving dinner!

This salad recipe always has people asking "May I have a copy of your salad recipe?"  It's an amazingly good, easy recipe which complements a wide variety of main dishes.  Also works any time of year.

I made this for a holidat potluck.  It was the one dish that everyone went back for!  A big hit with the men!  I used the sweetened Craisins and cut back on the sugar.  The green and red was very festive looking.  I'm not a big spinach fan, but this was delicious!  For ease, use the prepackaged baby spinach.

My sister, Marcia, just made this for her 2001 Christmas brunch & it was simply heavenly!  Light, refreshing, not overlaid with spinach, but rather like a dark green lettuce salad.  Would taste equally well in the winter, used for an Easter dinner or for a salad in the heat of July.

Great dressing.  I used raisins rather than cranberries (couldn't find dried cranberries) and it worked out well.  Thanks for sharing!

We had guests over for dinner the first time I made this salad, and I wound up sending my copy of this recipe home with them.  Everyone loved it-and my husband proclaimed this his new favorite salad.  It was very easy to make because I just used a pre-washed and dried bag of baby spinach.  The kids were hesitant to try this, so we didn't force it-the adults just finished it!

Was invited to a last-minute barbeque and needed to bring a salad.  Since I've been using this one at home, I figured, why not?  Well, let's just say it was a hit with everyone, kids, too.  The only thing I changed is that I substituted Splenda for the sugar.

I made this for our Mother's Day cookout and it was a hit!!  Next time I may add extra cranberries and almonds -- I like a lot of "goodies" in my salads.  I used a bag of Craisins, as they were much less costly than the dried cranberries.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I have to admit that the only reason I made this salad was because I needed something to bring to work for a luncheon and I had most of these ingredients at home.  When I went to make the salad I realized that I didn't have dried cranberries, but I did have dried cherries.  I didn't even care if it was going to be a hit or not, I just needed something quick to bring. Well! I luckily doubled the recipe and it was a major hit.  My coworkers loved it and my husband was so disappointed that I didn't bring any leftovers home.  I will make this again and again.   Thanks!

I think this was a little too different for my "meat and potatoes" guy, but I really liked this salad! I did substitute strawberries for the cranberries and pecans for the almonds. Next time I'll try it with cranberries.

Count me in with the multitudes of rave reviews.  Very refreshing salad.  I make similar salads that are usually paired with blue veined cheeses, and they are always popular.  This salad was a lighter version, that seemed to go better for a rich, glazed pork loin I had made for the entree.  Visually the salad was also a winner.  Deep green spinach with the bright red cranberries--hello gorgeous!

I must admit that I really do enjoy this salad, however I found it much better with other greens besides spinach. I added a variety of lettuces for more cruch and body. The dressing is outstanding and I wouldn't change anything there.

Check your poppy and sesame seeds before you make this!  Mine were rancid (I didn't know they would do that) and it affected the flavor of this salad.  This is truly a winning recipe, everyone seems to love it.

Made this for a "potluck" dinner for some of the women in my neighborhood -- it's a 'tough crowd' and the salad was a BIG hit!!  It was the only salad bowl that was empty at the end of our meal and I have been receiving requests for the recipe for over a week.  I did not add all of the dressing to the salad and I added more cranberries than the recipe calls for to add more color and Christmas 'flavor'.

7.6.17  This is a very nice salad,, although I did cut back a bit on the sugar (personal taste).  The dressing has just enough tang to give this salad some interest, and the combo of the poppy and the sesame seeds plus the sweetness of the cranberries really works.  So glad I made extra dressing because it will be gone probably by tomorrow.

I have made this recipe for years.  I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  My family loves it!  It is a wonderful side at Christmas dinner.

For a girl who doesn't care for spinach, this was good!  I ate every last bite! Hubby loved it too, not so much the kids, but that's typical.  I made it exactly as written.  The dressing was perhaps a little on the sweet side...it was still yummy, but when I make it again, I'll try cutting down on the sugar to see what happens.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was GREAT very very quick and simple. Personally I would not put as much Sesame in next time, I just felt they had TOO much of them but will certainly make again.

This salad is amazing! My only sugestiona was less sugar I use a quarter of a cup and it's enough. I also add some feta but that's a personal taste... Other than that I highly recommend it, ever where I bring it, it disappears. Also I have made it with romaine instead of spinach, delicious!

This is an amazing salad if you don't skip the important steps of making the dressing yourself and roasting the almonds.  What I mean by that is don't shortcut it and buy dressing from the store.  What I did was make 2-3 servings of the dressing and keep it in the fridge for whenever I make this salad.  Also, when adding onion I only use purple onion and I also add blue cheese which adds so much to the salad. Great recipe!!

I skip the poppy seeds, sesame seeds, paprika, and onion, not because of preference just convenience. I always add fresh sliced strawberries. I never blanch the almonds, I just toss them in there. Other than that I follow the recipe. Ppl always ask for the recipe.

Made this tonight and I was very disappointed. It's WAY too sweet. Thankfully I had grilled chicken and bread sticks to counter that sweetness. I would recommend reducing the sugar to 1-2 tablespoons.

Really good, and easily modified to your tastes.  I made the dressing almost as listed (just use virgin olive oil, halfed the sugar and added a little artificial to it).  I thought it needed a little more of something, so added about 2 teaspoons of Raspberry Vinagrette dressing that I had on hand.  I chose to omit the cranberries (lots of calories there) and used a can of mandarin oranges and added 3 boiled chopped eggs.  I thought my picky husband would turn it down, but he loved it.  It was a meal for me and I think you could add almost any mix of veggies you like.  I only dinged it one star because the dressing needed a little more flavor.

Made this for my family and it was a big hit. I followed another reviewer's advice by adding blue cheese. So yummy and easy to make. Definitely will make again. Only suggestion is too much dressing so cut dressing ingredients so not too soggy.

We love this salad! I used baby spinach, so no need to tear into pieces, and a baby lettuce mixture. Also to simplify used already toasted almonds. Had to sub rice vinegar for white wine/vin, used walnut oil, and added sliced red onion(left out the minced), and blue cheese crumbles. Oh, and reduced the sugar by half so as not too sweet for us! So good, I could eat this all day long!!

I served this at dinner parties two nights in a row and got rave reviews both nights.  I think it's the most recipe requests I have gotten!  I made as is, with a little less sugar.  It is very refreshing and so good.

Always a hit at dinners.  Use pine nuts instead of sesame seeds. and Paul Newman's balsamic vinagrette for dressing.

Delicious. Got rave reviews and requests for recipe. I dry toasted the almonds and sesame seeds (did not use butter). I did not use poppy seeds. Since I used Craisins I cut the sugar to 1/3rd of the recipe amount and dressing was perfect.  Be careful not to overdress.

This is maybe the best salad I've ever had, no joke. Once the dressing is in with the spinich, it's just delicious; on its own, it's surprisingly a bit bland. We axed the poppy seeds and added goat cheese instead. So good, will make again.

I have made this so many times it has become my "PLEASE MAKE YOUR SALAD"..for all events. A couple of suggestions:
Make dressing in advance, I add in the almonds and cranberries in the salad dressing ................. additionally Spinach wilts very quickly, so if you are having a buffet type of meal you may consider putting out the spinach and the salad dressing in a cruet separate. Important also I double the recipe and keep it for weeks. I also cut the sugar in half.........

I am so glad to see this recipe online.  I first had it at a church social.  Essentially it was the same recipe, instead of almonds they used pecans, and instead of spinach they used spring salad mix,  and it had some feta cheese sprinkled on top.  It is so good and such a nice change of pace from regular tossed salad, not to mention very pretty.  The nuts, cranberries, and dressing hit the spot.   

This is definitely a recipe I use when I have foodies over.  It has been a hit every time.  Next time I will try spinach and almonds.

This was an easy and satisfying salad, although I changed it quite it bit by substituting fresh berries for the craisins.  Forgot sesame seeds at the store so did without, but next time I will add them.  I also bought slivered honey roasted almonds at Trader Joe's and used those instead of toasting my own.  The best part about this salad is it can be changed a lot and it still turns out yummy because of the dressing.

Well this is probably the strangest review I have ever written.  I'm giving this 5 stars but I never actually tasted the salad.  How is this possible?  I served it at a gathering of 10 women (including myself).  I had doubled the recipe.  However, when I finally served myself, there was none left.  I can only assume it really awesome!  I did taste the dressing and thought it was good but I guess I'll wait to the next time.  Geez - must be delicious!

This is devoured by my family.  It makes way too much dressing so cut the dressing ingredients in half.
Also, cut out the oil. It won't be missed.

Excellent recipe!!!!!The only thing that I did different was I toasted the almonds in the oven at the same time that I toasted the sesame seeds without any butter or anything. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I was told this is the best salad I have ever made & I have made a lot!

I always make the dressing as written in the recipe. It has a strong vinegar taste , quite tart, but I like that. I toast the almonds in the oven without any butter. I also throw in either blue or feta cheese. This ha became one of my favorite salads! Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making this salad for years and it is always well-received!  I make it exactly as it reads and it turns out perfect every time.  I usually save this for special occasions as it is more effort to make than just opening a bottle of salad dressing like I usually do. :)  Thanks, Jamie for a family favorite!

Excellent as written, a wonderful spinach salad.  I used baby spinach, it is easy to work with and tastes great.  You can buy sesame seeds already toasted.  I used shelled almonds rather than slivered for a heartier crunch and toasted them the same way.  I did toast more than I needed the first time and I found I could freeze the leftovers.  It made it so much easier the next time I wanted to make a simple side dish with dinner or light lunch.  I didn't have to take all that extra time to toast the almonds again.  When making the dressing I minced fresh onions not dried.  With a spinach salad dressing poppy seeds are a must, I would not eliminate them if at all possible.  I have refrigerated this dressing and used it all week without effecting it's flavor.

The dressing is the key.  Can also soak the cranberries in Juice (cranberry) to soften for few hours before tossing

this salad was amazing. the dressing mixed with the cranberries is what makes it so good. I also added bacon and bleu cheese crumbles as salad toppings, which also worked well together.

Ive made this recipe a couple of times now.  The first time I made as the recipe (other than replacing teh vegetabe oil for EVOL).  The second time I thought it needed a few changes ~ I added a little Feta cheese and a finely chopped onion.  I also thought there was way too much dressing the first time, so the second time around I halved the dressing and found it was so much better.  Great salad ~ thank you for sharing.

This recipe is excellent!! I only have a couple of things that i want to add.  First is that the finished product doesn't look to appetizing, probably because the yellowish color of the oil is too prominent.  Adding some diced up cranberries and letting stand for a couple of hours will add some nice coloring to the mixture.  Using red onions in place of the plain will have the same effect.  Secondly, instead of toasting the almond with butter, toasting them in the toaster oven for 5 minutes will give it that toasty flavor minus the grease.  I used left over pecans from the pecan pie and it blended well with the dressing.  The amount of sugar can be adjusted, too, to the level of sweetness desired.  This recipe is a hit every time!!!

I didn't use the almonds because I don't like them so I used cashews instead. I also added some apple slices just to jazz it up a bit.. The dressing was wonderful! I will definitely make the dressing again for other salada and maybe even as a marinade for some foods. It wasn't too sweet but the blend with the dressing and the cranberries made it perfect!

Oh my gosh. This is in the top 5, salad-wise. I used 2.5 tablespoons of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe calls for, toasted the almonds in olive oil instead of butter, and used canola oil instead of vegetable. WOW. The toasted almonds made it fragrant and delish.

I liked this. I used the calculate button and changed it to 2 servings and still got 3 descent sized servings for lunch to try this. I followed the recipe ingredients, exactly, except I cut the amount of cranberries by half. It was a good amount. I also just chopped up some whole almonds well, and toasted those as directed. This is probably not something I would make for a week night dinner, but I am going to keep it in mind for a holiday. If making for a buffet or holiday, make sure to add the dressing only right before serving. The dressing some what quickly breaks down the spinach. It is best with the spinach still crispy. I think, for a party, it would be well received though.

This was five stars as written...but went to 5 million stars when I added some sesame seed oil and juice of a naval orange into the dressing.  The dressing is very good on rice pilaf....that I served with chicken cordon bleu.

Fantastic salad! My husband and I loved it. Only deviations was that I toasted the almonds and sesame seeds in the oven for 10 min on 350 and I added crumbled bleu cheese. Thanks for my new salad favorite!!!

My kids even liked this salad but I made it a little different.  I like really quick recipes so I made adjustments to make it as easy as possible.  I used Spinach, Craisins, Oven Roasted chopped Almonds, Pine nuts, tri-colored Tortilla strips (in the salad isle by the croutons) and bought Kraft Balsamic Vinagrette dressing (16 oz) and added some Splenda packets (to make it a little sweeter) in the bottle and shook .  I let everyone make their own salad in a bowl and put the toppings listed on for themselves.  My son doesn't like Craisins so he just used the nuts and tortilla strips.  Just pour the salad dressing on top the salad instead of mixing all together because if you don't eat all the salad that night it will be mush by the next day.  I also bought a Roasted Chicken at the Grocery store when I got these ingredients so supper was ready in about 5 minutes.

For the past 9 years I have returned to allrecipes.com specifically for THIS recipe.  I’ve made it for nearly every fall/winter holiday meal I’m involved in and it is consistently a reliable way to “WOW” folks.  Especially when a salad seems like it may be a dull addition to a table, this recipe has a freshness that dances with savory and works perfectly with any other traditional holiday dish.  
I make it exactly as the recipe describes every time.  It is more dressing ingredients than I usually go for, but it comes out so perfectly that I’m never tempted to change it.

My whole family kids and all love love love this salad with just minimal changes.  First I use pecans instead of almonds (DELICIOUS) 2nd I add bleu Cheese crumbles (ADDS A DEPTH OF FLAVOR) and I use dried craisins and 3rd and final I do not use poppy seeds or sesame seeds, I use fresh grated onion instead of minced onion and I use All Cider Vinegar and honey instead of sugar.  Perfect salad for any occasion

This was really good. When I was mixing the dressing, it tasted too vinegary and I was a little worried but once mixed with the spinach, the flavor is wonderful. I used a bag of dried cranberries and cherries. The only thing I left out were the poppy seeds cause I couldn't find any in the grocery. I served the dressing on the side and we drizzled as much as we wanted. My picky health conscious husband loved it and asked if I could add walnuts next time.

Don't drown the salad in dressing, as the taste of vinegar could be overwhelming... Just add enough to coat the spinach. Thanks for this great recipe.. Ill be making it regularly.

Love this salad! I made it as is the first time and it was fantastic. The spinach, cranberries and toasted almonds are now my goto salad. Lately I have sauteed some portobello mushrooms and bell peppers over onion and minced garlic and added the hot mixture over the salad. Add some goat cheese and simply balsamic and olive oil and get ready for something delicious! Love it.

this salad was amazing, I used balsamic instead of cider viniger, olive oil instead of vegetable and used only walnuts and almonds because I didn't have the sesame or poppy seeds....it was amazing!!

VERY good! The only thing I did different was used spring mix instead of spinach and added concord grapes. I took it to a church potluck and just a bit of the large bowl was left and I had someone ask to take the leftovers home!

Made this the first time exactly like the recipe.  The
salad dressing was too bland for me so I added one 
and a half Tablespoons of Balsamic Vinegar along with salt & pepper.  Used half of the spinach and added romaine lettuce which gave a lot of crunch.
The roasted almonds are a must & the blue cheese
brings this salad to another level.  Thanks so much for sharing Jamie.  I'll be serving this on Turkey Day.

Nice,easy and good.  I served the dressing on the side, but I won't do that again.  It really needs to get in there and coat that stuff!  Thanks!

The salad itself was great, but the dressing was just too sweet. I'm trying to figure out what went wrong, since the other reviews are pretty great?

I am making this for a potluck today. I dipped a piece of spinach into the dressing and grabbed an almond and cranberry to sample it (since I don't want to put the dressing on til I get there) and WOW! I am lovin it! almost hoping no one else does in a very selfish i-want-to-eat-it-all-myself sort of way. 5 stars. i made it exactly like the recipe except I didn't have seasme seeds, i used flax seeds. I'll try seasme next time I have some on hand. Love this salad. Spinach never tasted so good :)

Lovely, simple salad.  I cut the sugar in half and used olive oil rather than vegetable oil.  Also left out the onion.  Everyone loved it!

Absolute Keeper! I did not use butter to toast almonds, just a well seasoned cast iron skillet. Did the same for the sesame seeds.  I only used 1/4 c sugar and it was wonderful.  Only toss together what you think will be eaten. I fed 6 adults with half of the spinach.

Very good but makes lots of dressing.  Leftovers get mushy if sits overnight.  Save the dressing for the side.

This recipe is great I have been making it for years now. I've used regular white vinegar instead of rice vinegar when I'm out and that taste really good too. It is on the sweeter side but I think that is what makes it special. I omit the onion. I do not use butter to brown my almonds, I just do it stove top on a pan and do the same for the sesame seeds. My kids and hubby love this salad and I try to make it once a week. I find that when I halve the recipe it taste less sweet, not sure why but still delish.

Great!!  Because I am not a fan of sweet dressings, I used 1/4 c splenda instead of a 1/2 c .  I added a little crumbled blue cheese and used pine nuts because I didn't have almonds on hand.  We loved it.   Definitely a keeper!!

I also didn't use butter and just toasted the almonds in a dry pan - they turned out great! For the dressing, I use 1 tbsp of light brown sugar and 1/4 olive oil.

Delicious. Made this for a party and it was the only thing that was completely gone by the end of the night. I did not use poppy seeds, substituted toasted pine nuts for almonds, and only added 1/4 cup of sugar. About to go make some more.

This is a delicious salad...it also makes a nice presentation. The colors make it a perfect holiday salad. It is on the sweet side, so those enjoying a more savory salad may not like it as well as I did. I utilized crasins and bought honey crusted sliced almonds in the salad section of the supermarket to save time. It turned out great.

This is very good.  Three out of my four kids liked this and really to have 75% of my kids WANT to eat spinach is miraculous.  I also brought this to a pot luck and had rave reviews.

I made this to carry to a friend for dinner and she called the next day and wanted the recipe! The dressing is especially delicious. I omitted the poppy seed and used a little extra toasted sesame seed.....really good!

I couldn't believe all the rave reviews this recipe got, because tihere are hardly any ingredients in it.  But boy was everyone right!!!  THis salad is absolutely delicious.  I made it for the first time Christmas day, and my family LOVED it.  I used toasted walnuts instead of almonds because it is what I had on hand.  I also attempted to half the sugar, but everyone agreed it needed the full amount to balance the vinegars.  The salad doesn't require a lot of dressing, so don't worry about the sugar!   My husband, who isn't so crazy about salad, has asked me to make this several times now.  Try it!!!  You won't be sorry!!!!  :)

This was a very good salad. I toasted the almonds prior to adding to the salad and that added a nice crunch.

The dressing is what makes this salad.  It's tangy and delicious, can be added to any salad variation.  Adding blue cheese goes very well with the spinach. A keeper.

The five stars is an understatement for the ranking of this recipe since my husband took the salad to his office Thanksgiving party this past wed. and it was a hit! nothing left and lots of requests for the recipe. The next day I made the same salad for my office party on Thursday with the same results! People were asking me for the recipe and since I had some dressing left, that was also taken by some of my colleagues for their salad the next day!  Thank you so much for this recipe and for all those AR friends who recommended it to me in the Recipe Exchange!! 5 stars from my husbands office and 5 from mine =total 10 stars!!!

This is just like the spinach salad at our favorite lunch spot! I added crumbled blue cheese, chopped hard-boiled egg, real bacon bits, slivered red onion (and not in dressing) and candied walnuts (instead of almonds). And just 1/4 cup sugar in dressing.  Everyone at lunch had seconds and really loved it!

I have made this recipe at least 4 times now, bringing it to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners for the past few years.  It is becoming a staple at the holiday table that people ask for. Even the non-salad eaters enjoy it. People also fight over the left overs.  If you go easy on the dressing the salad will easily keep for a lovely lunch the next day.

Yummy, I have made this several times now with a different flair each time.  The first time I followed exactly and it was awesome! Many compliments.  My favorite twist (and a hit with all ages)is to use romaine instead of spinach and add some feta cheese.  The last time I made this I was asked by several people for the recipe.  (I also use a little less sugar than the recipe calls for).  This is my new favorite.  I want some right now!

I don't know whether I love you for this recipe, or hate you. Thanks to this INCREDIBLE (not to mention easy) salad, I'm disappointed when eating any other salads. This is definitely going to be at my Thanksgiving dinner. I better plan on making a lot!! I know it will go fast!

Whenever I'm invited to a potluck I'm asked to bring this salad, no matter what the season or occasion it's a huge hit and goes well with anything. Last night was my uncles 50th and I brought this salad I added sliced strawberries, it was all gone within 10 minutes of putting it out! If your making this for a crowd I would only double everything but the spinach because it makes a lot and you don't want to end up with a greasy salad.

Because this recipe had so many reviews...I just had to try it! I read as many of the 5-star reviews and suggestions as I could, and then quite a few of the ones where people said they didn't like it. It seemed to me that the main reason people didn't like it was because the dressing was too overpowering. I took a lot of the suggestions of other reviewers and altered the recipe only slightly, and it was -- as so many others have already said -- fantastic! I used a 1/4 c Spenda, dry roasted the almonds, used mixed greens in addition to spinach, did not use poppy seeds, used Craisins and a small can of Mandarin oranges, only used 1/4 c olive oil and sprinkled reduced-fat feta on top afterward. (I also added cucumbers cut into quarters because my boyfriend loves them.) I did not add the dressing directly to the salad but drizzled it on prior to eating just in case it was too much. It was extremely tasty and my boyfriend raved about it and said this should be something we make all of the time. This one is a keeper!

this was really really good.  I served it for the first time last thanksgiving and have made it a few times since.  I took another op's suggestion and put blue cheese crumbles in it with pine nuts instead of almonds.....awesome!  Be sure to mix it often if serving to a crowd because the cranberries all fall to the bottom. Thanks so much, this is a for sure keeper.

I loved this with added Mandarin Oranges and Blue Cheese.  I won't make the recipes without them as they add an extra "punch".

I have used this recipe so many times I know it by heart! I have shared it with everyone I know and it is now a staple at our family gatherings! I have substituted the almonds with my own recipe for candied pecans and it is really awesome! Thanks for sharing!

This was a hit! It's perfect for eating dinner outside on warm nights. I made the dressing as directed (love it!) but adapted the salad slightly. Like a few others, I toasted the almonds in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350. I didn't use the poppy seeds or sesame seeds. I bought Craisins because they cost less, and I also added mandarin oranges. Crumbly cheese like feta, gorgonzola or goat cheese work wonderfully for added flavor!

Amazing!  I too was surprised at the yumminess of this salad with such basic and minimal Ingrediants!  I used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  Extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Walnuts instead of almonds.  Rainsin instead of cranberries.  Also put some sliced strawberries in as well and salt and pepper to taste. Also followed advice of others and baked seeds.  Will definitely make again!!!!!

I know this already has a lot of reviews but it was so good I just had to add my two cents worth.  The only thing I did different was toast the almonds in the oven with the sesame seeds instead of on the stove with butter.  The dressing is what makes the salad!!

Didn't have poppy seeds so skipped it.  The dressing was wonderful with any roast nuts it seems (used cashews one time and peanuts another).  Dried cranberries gave it the right balance with the vinegar

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I make the dressing and keep it in the fridge, then I just serve it over the spinach and a sprinkling of cranberries (we skip the nut - we have a nut-allergic member of the family)  I eat this about 3-4 nights a week with dinner.

Wow! What a wonderful salad! I love the sweetness and tanginess of this salad. I mixed all of the salad dressing ingredients together and let it sit for a few hours prior to serving the salad, to give time for the flavours of all of the ingredients a chance to mix. I also added the onion and cranberries to the mixture. This will be a regular staple in our household from now on!

This is absolutely an amazing salad that complements just about any meal.  I prefer to use baby spinach and I like to use red onions instead.  I also top it off with a freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!

Love this salad! I used half the sugar and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also browned the almonds in the oven as other users suggested and omitted the poppy seeds. Everyone who tried it has asked me for the recipe.

Great recipe, my husband and I loved it.  I did take other's recommendations and cut the sugar. I may try using fresh raspberries or strawberries next time. This does make a big large serving and is not very good the next day.

I don't like almonds or dried cranberries and I'm not fond of sesame seeds....yet this salad is incredible.  I can't eat enough of it.  The ingredients are all just perfect together.  I make it for dinner parties and everyone goes back for seconds.

I've made this for holiday dinner parties for the past two years and got rave reviews each time. I made it with a regular salad mix this year instead of the spinach and it was just as good. I tripled the recipe -- everything was fine but I had way too much dressing. More for me later!

This was fantastic! Unlike many other vinegarettes that I have tried, this one seemed to have the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. I add crumbled pieceds of brie to my salad for a special touch that guests loved.

Wonderful!  I forgot the onion (oops), toasted my almonds dry, and cut the sugar to about 1/3 cup--still sweet (1/4 cup was not enough sugar to cut the tang).  Hubby said it was the best homemade dressing he ever had. To make it better, use some good whole dried cranberries (like Mariani, e.g.) instead of Craisins.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, both for a potluck at work and for my family. It was a hit both places! The only suggestions that I would make are to cut down on the sugar a bit, (it was a little on the sweet side) and to not use all of the dressing on the salad. Save some for another time, as it would have been too oily for me if I had used it all.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  I used the suggestions and browned the nuts without sugar in the oven and I also used craisens as suggested.  I added some Romaine lettuce as well.  It was delicious, EVERYONE loved it.  It made me look good :-).  The dressing added such a perfect taste with the salad.  it's a keeper!!!!!

Really good! Everyone loved the toasted almonds with the cranberries. But the star really was the dressing. The only thing I added to this were a couple dashes of sesame oil, I like the Asian flavor.

Very good! Cut oil down to 1/3 C. Added blue cheese. Dressing was a bit sweet but still delish. I will definitely make this again.

Amazing!   I love this salad and will make it over and over again.  I used 1/3 c oil and 1/3c sugar instead of the 1/2c the recipe called for.  I also added a can of mandarin oranges as another poster suggested.  Yum!

I found it so funny that this recipe was featured on the home page of the site today.  I stumbled upon it last week looking for new recipes to livin up my Thanksgiving table.  I gave this one a test run with a dinner I made for friends.  It was a rave success.  And though I am like others, and like to try a recipe exactly how it is before adding any of my own twists, I couldn't resist the suggestion of adding some crumbled feta cheese(a favorite in our house). Amazing salad!!!
Because the recipe didn't specify I used red onion in the dressing....sooooo good.
Thanks for this awesome brightly flavored salad, I can hardly wait to put it on the table this Thanksgiving

I really cannot even tell you how many people consistantly commented to each other and myself how much they enjoyed this salad. I brought it to a gathering of about 10 women and I added the dressing when I arrived. Made the dressing exactly as the recipe called, except I bought a bottle of balsamic rasberry vinegar. I really loved this and it looks great for the Holidays. Love it.

FAB-U-LOUS!  I used a little less sugar, craisins, and added blue cheese crumbles and sliced honeycrisp apples.  I made enough for leftovers...but we ate it all in one sitting!

This salad is quite good and simple, BUT I have had better salads on this site.  Not the best salad ever but still really good.  Personally, its a bit too sweet, but that's probably because I'm more into a vinegary/lemon salad dressing as opposed to a sweet one.  I also think it needs some goat or blue cheese to balance the sweetness.

The salad was good however I did make a few changes.  The amount of oil seemed like a bit much so I halved that but wished I took out a little more later on.  I used evoo instead of vegetable oil.  I also added freshed cracked pepper, shallots, and kosher salt.  I believe the amount stated makes WAY TOO much dressing, the amount of dressing that this recipe makes could probably be used for 3 lbs of spinach.

This was tasty, but I think for me the salad needed more "stuff" in it. I think for me this would best suited as a main dish salad with the addition of chicken as well as some other veggies to it next time. The dressing was a tad too sweet for my liking, not horrid but next time I think I'd scale back the sweetener a bit.

Overall it was good once the oil and sugar were reduced and I added some feta cheese to give the salad some additional depth. What I didn't like (and maybe this is my fault) was that the spinach completely soaked up the dressing and was very soggy within 30 minutes. Maybe I didn't use enough spinach (I used two spinach bunches). I will try this salad a few more times -- I wouldn't call it 'the Best' -- but overall it was tasty with the modifications.

Fantastic recipe. I made this for a birthday party -- 45 guests -- and there wasn't a leaf left. I had another batch for just our family and everyone has been munching it down all week. I can't seem to make enough for both my husband and my three-year-old daughter -- neither of whom are typically big on "greens." A definite keeper and a great way to get everyone to eat more spinach. Next time I may cut back on the sugar a wee bit.

I made this salad for a potluck, and with the exception of using craisins and getting already toasted almonds from Trader Joe's, I followed it exactly.  It was awesome. Some of the people at the potluck assured me that they do NOT like salad, but couldn't get enough of this one.  I've made it a couple of times since then for my family, and love it every time.  I've tried the toasted pine nuts variation, but actually prefer the recipe as written with the almonds.  Thanks!

This is fantastic. Really, really great and so incredibly easy.

Someone suggested simply using Paul Newman's vinegarette?? That's insane. The combination of the vinegar and oil in this recipe is wonderful.

I made the recipe as noted except for the almonds as I have allergies. I agree that the sesame and poppy seeds give it a good texture. I also used "Craisins" as they were fast and easy to find at the grocery store. I simply put all the ingredients in a big bowl, whisked it with a fork and poured an appropriate amount over the quantity of spinach I already had. Wonderful!! Even my six year old ate it!! Thanks.

With so many 5 star reviews, I just had to try this salad. It was a big hit with the men and kids alike. Even a girlfriend that said she didn't particularly like spinach, loved it. I will serve this salad again and again. Hats off to you Jamie!!

A keeper!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar & used slightly less (I think it's sweeter than sugar, I don't care what the advertisement says!) and I substituted raspberry vinegar for the white vinegar.  I also toasted the almonds and sesames seeds together in a 350 degree oven & sprinkled on top.  Next time, I'll coat the spinach with the dressing and sprinkle everything else on top so that it doesn't fall to the bottom of the bowl.

Awesome recipe! Followed exactly how the recipe read, made the dressing in advance while I had time and then tossed it all together right before dinner. Very light and sweet, great!

I was skeptical that these ingredients were going to add up to the rave reviews, but it was really delicious.  It was a little too sweet so next time I will cut the sugar down to maybe 1/4 cup as others have suggested.  I baked the almonds and sesame seeds in the oven as some others suggested.

AMAZING!  I followed the recipe exactly and can't think of a single thing I'd change.  We loved the cranberries and toasted almonds, and the dressing was fantastic.

I have made this salad twice in the past week for different groups. It was very well received both times.  I followed the recipe as written and I'm not inclined to change it. The sauteed almonds brought postive comments on both occasions. Toasting the sesame seeds in a dry skillet really enhances their flavor. I'm sure I will made it often since it is so easy to put together but tastes like it took much more effort.  I do agree with previous reviews, toss with the dressing about 30 minutes before serving.  This really improves the flavor.

I thought this was wonderful! I would recommend tossing the dressing with the salad well before serving - the dressing really has a chance to marinate with the spinach leaves and it's even tastier! :-)

YUM!  The only change I made was to use sunflower seeds instead of almonds because I did not have any...all else the same.  Even my husband liked it and he had been so sick of salads.

This is the best salad I have EVER had!!  I added grilled chicken that I marinated in Newman's Own Light Sesame Ginger salad dressing.  I also used a combination of toasted almonds and pine nuts.  It was amazing!

Used what I had on hand. Pecans,mixed greens with the spinach, splenda for the sugar,and dry toasted the nuts and sesame seeds. Put some red onion bits through my garlic press. Used olive oil which I halved and replaced with water. As others had said they put on some snappy cheese of some sort which I did not have on hand but I did have some left over cheese bread which I cubed and toasted as well. When all was done it made for one of the best salads I have had in a long time. Really hated to see it come to an end....just wanted to eat & eat &........ :o)

I made this for Christmas last year and since then I have been have asked to make it for every get together. There are never any leftovers. I add romaine lettuce, oranges and gorganzola cheese to my salad. Yummy! I am making it today for Easter dinner.

The toasted almonds adds a good texture to the salad but it was very sweet and I had to add more of the vinegar to lessen the sweetness of it.  Next time I will add alot less sugar.

This recipe is excellent!  I was a little hesitant to make this salad because I figured it was a 3-ingredient salad: spinach, almonds and cranberries.  But those ingredients, combined with the delicious dressing, is amazing!  The toasted almonds really add a lot of flavor.  To add some extra interest to this salad, I used half baby spinach and half of a spring mix.  There were no left-overs! *~*~*~*~* I have been making this salad for a while now -- mostly because it's ALWAYS REQUESTED.  Several people have asked me for the recipe.  This one's definitely a keeper!!

YUMMY!  I had to try since this recipe had so many reviews.  So simple and yet so tasty...only thing I did different from the recipe was to take others advice and halved the suger.  I made it for a luncheon and everyone wanted the recipe.

One of the best salads I've ever had. I ommited the butter and toasted almonds and sesame seeds in the toaster oven. That's the only change I made. I'll be having it over and over. I already know that.

This was a mega hit at my son's 3rd birthday party.  After reading a few reviews, I decided to leave out the poppy seeds too.  I was tempted to add a few things like gorgonzola cheese, pears or mandarin oranges but decided to keep it simple.  Some of my alterations included: one bag of baby spinach, one bag of mixed spring greens, canola oil, 1/2 bag of sliced almonds already toasted from Trader Joe's, craisins and pan toasted sesame seeds.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper.  However, the real secret to this recipe is the amount of sugar.  I also make an insanely popular asian chicken salad that uses a similar amount of sugar in the dressing.   Personally, it's a little too sweet for me but it's so ridiculously requested, I can't stop making it!

Ifyou love greens (especially baby spinach), you must try this recipe.  It was delicious and the dressing was enough for next time as well!  Added some raisins because I didn't have enough dried cranberries. Our guests gobbled it up!

This is really good.  The kind of food you just can't stay out of.  I have another spinach recipe that has bacon and bean sprouts, as part of the ingredients.  I'll just bet you that would be good in this, too.

This was great , I used hazlenut oil and omitted the poppy seeds due to personal preference. It was a hit.
*Update- I tried putting everything for the dressing in the processor because I hate chopping onion, it really altered the taste and made the dressing watery.ext time I will mince by hand and wisk together as specified!

Absolutely one of the best salads I have ever had.  I followed the instructions exactly, just halved all the ingredients.  I will toast the almonds next time in the oven at 375F for about 5 minutes.

An easy to prepare recipe - and I made it as directed, except I toasted the almonds in a 375 degree oven for 4 minutes (so didn't need the butter) and I used baby spinach. It is very good - but I've made others on this site that are even better (Cranberry Pecan Salad is awesome).

This was FANTASTIC!!! Oh my GOD! I don't like salad, but this I CAN EAT.  I followed some of the members comments about adding crasings and not using poppy seeds.  This came out delicious.  Everyone LOVED my salad.  THANK YOU for sharing it.

People raved over this!  I did not use the butter to roast the almonds, I didn't feel I needed to add the extra fat.  I had to pass the recipe out to many people!

Pretty good - next time I would use less than half of the sugar it calls for.

I was hesitant, as my boyfriend chose this recipe for his first salad ever, but WOW! Definitely one of the best dressings I've had.  I have made it two times now, and it's also good with little changes like reducing the sugar.

YUM YUM YUM!!!!
I happen to be browsing around on, and thought I'd check out the 'top 20' recipes overall, and this salad was in there.  With all the 5 star reviews, how could I not try it?!  I have to admit, I figured it would be good, but I thought the reviews were going a little overboard.....until my husband, myself, and our guests were all scraping as much as we possibly could out of the salad bowl!!!!!  Delicious!  I served it with some homemade beef stew and crusty bread, and I have to say that they went very well together.
I toasted the sesame seeds in a dry, non-stick skillet, and they went REALLY fast so you have to keep an eye on them.
I do think that next time I make this I will substitute Splenda for the sugar, since it is quite a bit of sugar.

Definitely worth a try everyone!!!

This is a fabulous recipe---I get requests to make it all the time.  I use Spring Mix salad greens (in a bag)because they look really pretty. I also use Splenda instead of sugar and Craisins (the regular kind, not the flavored ones).  Thanks for a great recipe, Jamie!

I love all of the main ingredients in this salad recipe, so I was sure it would be awesome, and I wasn't disappointed.  I did not have any poppyseeds, the only ingredient I had to leave out.  The dressing is superb and would be an excellent choice for many different salads.  My wife has a very discriminating palate and she loved it.  

Excellent!

This was wonderful, full of flavors just bursting in your mouth.  We used a blend of romaine lettuce and spinch.  Thanks for a new favorite salad.  Yummy.

The first time I tried this I mixed all the dressing in with the salad, and felt it was too much (too soggy and was overwhelmed by the sweetness in the dressing). The second time I let each person mix the amount desired with the salad on his/her plate, and then discovered that the refrigerated leftover dressing is DELICIOUS served cold with cold pasta! (I used tricolor spiral pasta.) Next time I think I'll make extra dressing, just to have the leftovers to use in another pasta salad afterward...

I can see why this is a 5-star recipe, it was incredible!  I did a few things differently:  I used splenda instead of sugar (couldn't tell the difference), I used a shallot instead of a onion because that's all I had, and I didn't toast the almonds (I felt lazy!).  The dressing is sweet but not too sweet, the cranberries add a nice bit of tartness to it, and with the spinach, it's an excellent source of fiber!  My only wish is that it would be lower in fat/calories.  I will definitely make this again, maybe I will try adding feta or blue cheese.

Super yummy!  I eliminated the poppy seeds and added mandarin oranges as someone had suggested.  I used pinenuts instead of almonds.  I roasted the in the oven, but didn't use butter.  I added pan grilled chicked, which I marinated in the mandarin orange juice, a little salt, and a clove of fresh pressed garlic to make it a complete meal.  It was great.  Even one of my 4-year olds ate it!

This was awesome!  I also added about 4 oz of crumbled feta and some mandarin oranges.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe.  IT WAS SO GOOD!  My teenagers, my 8 year old and my man loved it and had seconds.  A nice refreshing salad.  I paired it with the "Luscious Chicken Pot Pie" and the "Best Brownies" from this site.  What a hit!  Thanks!

Loved it!  I followed the advice of others and toasted the almonds and sesame seeds in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  Also cut down on the sugar to 1/4 cup, and used the Craisins (which are sweetened, so that balances out the sugar need).  Next time, I might throw in some bleu cheese.  This is a keeper!

This is the BEST salad. Everytime we have a family gathering, my family requests this salad. Even my husband, who does not eat spinach, loves it! I usually make the salad, make the dressing and take them in separate bowls. Right before we eat, I add the dressing to the salad. It does get soggy, so it's not something that works for leftovers (but there are usually not any so it doesn't matter!).

This salad was delicious!!!  A good change from your normal green salad.  I also cut back on the sugar- used about 2 tbsp.  I also didnt use all of the dressing- it makes a little too much.  Toast the almonds and sesame seeds in a toaster oven and you can cut back on the butter.  This is a great salad to bring to a party or to pass- you will get alot of compliments.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  Made this for New Year's (served with prime rib) and for Easter (served with glazed ham).  Both times my mother-in-law stole the leftover dressing!  Made per the recipe, but will definitely try less sugar (or Splenda) and will try 1/2 the oil and sub olive in place of vegetable as others have suggested.  Definitely toast the almonds and sesame seeds in the oven (without butter).  Lends a nice woodsy flavor that compliments AND contrasts the other ingredients.

My co-workers and I love this salad.  It's very easy to prepare.  I also slice fresh strawberries and add it to the salad.  The strawberries go very well with the dressing.

WOW! WOW! WOW! My husband made this for me for Valentine's Day (the ONLY day of the year that he cooks!) It was so easy and very good!  We were fighting over who got to take the leftovers to work the next day! I think that next time I will try it with half cranberries and half raisins.

Simply AMAZING!!! This salad was SUPERB!!! I didn't have cranberries so I soaked raisins in hot milk and employed those instead. The dressing is fabulous! I will definitely make this salad again, perhaps   I will try tossed greens next time.

Made the recipe as stated and turned out wonderful! I love all the flavors (and colors) mixed together. Will try to add gorgonzola the next time to add a little something extra.

I made this for my parents last night and they loved it soooooo much.  It was probably the easiest dressing to make and it tasted better than any store bought dressing out there.  You Rock Jamie!!!!

I made this over Christmas for family - it travels well if you wait to combine the dressing and spinach.  I used roasted walnuts instead of almonds, and a touch of honey instead of sugar.  As expected, the people who had it liked it and found the cranberries novel.  My father preferred to use iceburg lettuce, but it was still good.

This was really good, but seemed to be missing something (I like a lot of "stuff" in my salads).  Next time I think I will add some crumbled gorgonzola & sliced apples as another reviewer mentioned.

I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was still waaay too sweet.  Otherwise, it is a great salad.  I wouldn't make it main course, though.  It is not filling enough to stand alone.

I made this salad for a church function and literally 14 people emailed me for the recipe...It is fantastic! I used "Splenda" sugar, just to make it healthier, but still fantastic.

I left out the almonds (nut allergy), and the salad was still tasty and looked great.  I took it to a shower and was asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

Loved the dressing!  This was certainly a hit at the family dinner table.  I chose to toast the almonds in oven instead of in butter and it still had excellent flavor.

This was fantastic! Unlike many other vinegarettes that I have tried, this one seemed to have the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. I add crumbled pieceds of brie to my salad for a special touch that guests loved.

Very tasty salad.  I found the dressing a little on the sour side and added a bit more sugar.  Tasted great with dried cherries as well.

Hands down one of the best salads I've had..EVER! I served this at Thanksgiving and my guests requested seconds and thirds! I also used less oil, sugar, cider vingar, etc. You should def. toast the almonds in butter as it really brings out the flavor. Toasted seasme seeds were also a must for the dressing. Do not toss the salad with the dressing until the last minute in order to keep the spinach fresh. Thanks Jaime!

I took someone's advice and halfed the sugar and also halfed the oil.  I've made this salad about 3 times now and my one word to describe it is AMAAAAAAAAAAZING!! I can't wait for my boyfriend's family to try it at their BBQ later today! =)

This was so good!  I added strawberries and for the dressing started with 1/4 cup of sugar and added more to taste as per previous suggestions.  My husband doesn't like salad dressing, prefers his greens dry, so I set aside a bowl of undressed salad.  Even without the dressing he said this was the best salad he ever had.

Great taste, but too much sugar in the dressing (for my taste).  I used 3 tablespoons and it was still too sweet.

Every time I've made this salad I have gotten compliments.  I figured it was about time I pass them on to Jamie.  Excellent salad recipe - it takes a little bit of time to make, but it's worth it.

Excellent..My family loved it.  I used the 90Z spinach package which worked out fine for the dressing.  Thanks..great recipe.

I thought this salad was just ok.  I did change a few things though; I didn't toast the almonds in butter, in fact, I didn't toast them at all (toasting turns good fat into bad fat where nuts are concerned), instead of onion in the dressing, I used shallot and I omitted the poppy seeds because I didn't have any on hand.  Lastly, I used mixed greens instead of spinach.  In the end, we found the dressing to be a bit tangy for our liking, but our dinner guests did enjoy it.

Wonderful! I was short on almonds so added some pieced pecans to make up the measure. Was probably 1/2 cup of each. Did them altogether in the pan. Not thinking,I accidentally added more butter to the pan to toast the sesame seeds, would have been better toasted dry, but did not ruin them. It just added a little more buttery flavour which was OK by me. Next time I might even toast the poppy seeds to bring out some more of that flavour.  But everyone was dipping into the salad before it reached the table!  Thank you Jamie!

This is definitely a 'keeper'.  Everyone loved it and even asked for the recipe...now everyone has it as their 'special' salad for guests. I usually don't like a recipe with so many ingredients, but this one is well worth the time and effort.

This was really delicious. I did cut back on the sugar by half, and added some mushrooms, sprouts & carrots. And used half sesame oil & half vegetable oil. I also toasted the almonds. The cranberries added a nice sweetness.

This salad truly was incredible.  I served it at Christmas dinner to a bunch of military guys (not your typical salad crowd!) and they all had seconds!  I didn't have white wine vinegar so used white distilled vinegar instead.  Was concerned how it would turn out, but it was delicious!  Dying to make it again!

I used this recipe based off of all the positive reviews it had recieved already. I made it (so easy!) for a baby shower at work, during the holiday season. The cranberries made it festive...all the ingredients combined made it very tasty...and it was a huge hit. Several co-workers asked for the recipe. Always a good sign! Highly recommended.

A winner I will definitely make again!! I halved the spinach, but kept the almonds and cranberries in the same amount, because i like all the "stuff." I made this for thanksgiving, and it was really appreciated by those "healthy" eaters in the bunch. Very yummy, different, and makes for a nice colorful presentation.UPDATE - Just made this again for Easter and it was DEVOURED. Added feta this time, definitely enhances the salad!!

I ate this at a church Thanksgiving potluck and didn't want to eat anything else.  The dressing in combination with the spinach is excellent!  I have added this to my Thanksgiving menu for at home.

I'm not a big vinegar fan but I didn't mind this.  My boyfriend loved it!  I didn't like the fact of 1/2 cup of oil in it so I had him taste it with out the oil and he told me not to change it!  So if you don't like the thought of that much oil try it out first before you add it.

Was a hit at a Halloween party last night! Definitely toast the almonds and sesame seeds (can be done in advance)...it makes a big taste difference. Other than leaving the onion out, I followed the recipe as written. Definitely will make this a part of my regular recipe collection. Thanks, Jamie!

Simply fantastic.  HUGE hit!  I added red onions and a little goat cheese.  It wasn't the most harmonious union (the cheese w/dressing) i thought.  But everyone loved it!!  And i did too!!  Jamie's original recipe was outstanding...so many ways to get creative from her "base" recipe too!  Sauteing the almonds in the butter was a truly great touch.  By baking instead of the sauteing it is a way to cut corners on fat, but you will lose something if you do...5 stars ALL THE WAY.  Nice goin' Jaime...

Had this superb dish at a friends place and found the need to take the recipe home that night. I love to cook but never really dreamed of Dried Cranberries as part of a salad, the overall combination worked really well. Look forward to finding more of you recipes Jamie!

Very Good!!  I used 1/3C. of Splenda to replace the 1/2C. of sugar.  It was still very sweet.  Next time maybe 1/4.  Otherwise super and easy to make!!

Great salad.  I prepared for a group of eight for the first time, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used only 1/3 cup sugar, and substituted red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar.  I also added chopped red onion and used only 1 teaspoon of minced onion, and sprinkled feta cheese on top.  Outstanding!

This salad is SOOOO GOOD!!!  I have made this recipe so many times and it's a favourite everywhere I go - everyone always wants me to make it again and asks for the recipe!  I did modify the dressing to suit my taste, only because I wanted to cut down on the oil/sugar (we like less oil, more vinegar).  I use closer to 1/4 c. sugar and 1/4 c. oil, everything else as is!  It's FANTASTIC!

I made this recipe for Easter last year and still and now it's a 'requirement' at every family gathering.  I added some crumbled feta, used the prepared salad almonds and craisins.  It's so simple!  I've also made it with chunky chicken added for my daughter's volleyball team.  They loved it too!

This was really, really good but I would prefer it with less oil next time.  I think 3/4 or even 1/2 cup would be sufficient.  Also, I didn't have poppy seeds and it tasted great without them.

This is one of my favorite recipes, and I'm always asked to share the recipe whenever I serve it.  I like to use the dried cranberries version at Thanksgiving and Christmas time, but for in the spring and summer I usually substitute sliced strawberries for the cranberries.  Luckily it is usually all eaten right away, because this salad does not last well as a left-over.

This is sooooooo good! Perfect for a light summer lunch...  We grilled some chicken breasts and put the dressing on those too.  It was a huge hit w/ all of my co-workers.  I forgot to pick up onion, but it was great w/ out it.  It does make a ton though, so unless you have a big crew, I suggest just putting the dressing and almonds, etc... on half, so that you can make the rest the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This recipe was fantastic! We will definitely make it again. The dressing was really easy to make. I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used 1/8 cup of white cooking wine and 1/8 cup white vinegar. It tasted really good. The best part is the sesame seeds and poppy seeds coat all the spinach and add flavor in every bite. I also added chicken and served it as a dinner salad. I used dried cranberries, but I could also see using dried cherries.

Absolutely a delight! My husband loves spinach salad and requested that I make this again as a main course (sometime this week!). I had to use red wine vinegar b/c I had no white wine vinegar and it turned out just fine.  The cranberries did not overpower the way a raisin might. I liked the idea one reviewer had of adding some feta cheese. Will try that next time, and perhaps add some chicken breast chunks if it becomes the main course! Thanks!

This salad is excellent.  I usually want to keep eating it and skip the main dish!  Sometimes I use rice wine vinegar, but no matter what i use it is always excellent.

I love different salads and this was a great one.  I too reduced the sugar, replaced the white wine vinegar with red wine vinegar and replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil.  Also, toasted the almonds and seasame seeds in the oven.  So good I ate it two days in a row!

I cut back the sugar to 1/3 cup and will scale back to 1/4 c next time.  It just doesn't need all that refined sugar.  I also substituted pecans and baked them in a 350 oven for 15 min. instead of frying them in butter. What can I say, wonderful.  My kids didn't care for the almonds and cranberrys, but what do they know about great cuisine.  Thanks.

This was truly a wonderful salad.  My study group thoroughly enjoyed it.  I did at crumbled feta cheese for another layer of flavor.  I also reserved a small amount of the dressing to be used the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This salad was great.  Every time I make it, it disappears.  But, I don't add all of the dressing or it is too strong.  I keep about a 1/4 of it in the fridge and use it later in the week on a side salad.  Also, the lettuce gets really soggy if you let it sit.  So, I always toss the dressing in immediately before serving.

Made this for our Labor Day Barbeque without changing a thing and it was a big hit. Be sure to toast the sesame seeds, it makes a huge differnce.

Delicious!  Definitely needs the almonds and seeds for the great texture.  Add the dressing gradually because you might find you don't need it all. I really loved this recipe.

This salad is EXCELLENT.  Everyone likes it, even those who "don't like spinach".  (I find that toasting the almonds in the butter is unnecessary.  Toast them, yes, but you won't miss the butter.)  A great company salad, as well as for anyday.

I took this salad to a dinner party, and it was a big hit. I added the mandarin oranges and the orange cranberries like someone suggested. It made a very classy salad that went well with seafood.

This is an awesome spinach salad recipe.  Last night I subbed Splenda for the sugar.  Also cut the oil to 1/4 c adding 1/4 c of water in place.  These changes didn't affect the salad at all.  I roasted a few macadamia nuts and chopped them up and added those versus the almonds very good.

I thought this salad would be great for Christmas dinner because of the colors.  I was pleasantly surprised at how special this salad truly was.  We served it again this year at the request of my sisters.

This was a nice surprise, I chose to use less sugar and it was plenty sweet.In addition, I used less sesame seeds. 
It was very bold of me to try this recipe for the first time on Christmas Eve and for my new in-laws! The recipe was a hit!

By far, THE best spinich salad I have ever made. My husband and 4 year old absolutely love it every time I make it. Relatively easy to prepare as well. I did find not to saturate the salad with the dressing. A little does go a long way. Use just enough to coat the spinich and the flavor is wonderful!

Awesome salad! I added some grilled chicken to this salad to make it a complete meal. I covered my chicken breasts in Italian salad dressing then grilled them. You could could cook them in a pan as well. Serve the salad with some garlic bread and you've got it made!

This was pretty good, though I expected nirvana from the other reviews!  To keep the cranberries from all slipping to the bottom, I only tossed half of them with the salad, dressed it and then sprinkled the other half on top.  The ones on top only sink to the middle, it seemed.  I thought it was only alright but the six people to whom I served it absolutely loved it, hence the four stars.

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and everyone seemed to really enjoy it.  The almonds and the cranberries were great for a little texture change.  However, next time I will definitely cut the amount of sugar back.  I found it extremely sweet.  Also did not have white wine vinegar so I used a little bit of balsamic and blended to taste.  Gave out recipe to guests and will have to make this one again.

Very Good.  I made a double batch- didn't use all the sauce though- it made a lot.  Loved the dried Cranberries.  Didn't use Spinach though- used Romane lettuce instead.  It was wonderful- something different!!  A plus!

This is great salad - and very beautiful to serve.  I too reduced the sugar and found it still quite sweet.  I didn't need all the dressing.  But it keeps in the fridge and it great on any salad.

I have made this for several dinner functions from large holiday meals (xmas) to BBQ's and even on camping trips and everyone loves this salad.  I am always asked for the recipe or if I will be bringing it to the next party. A really big hit with adults but children don't care for it as much.

I made this recipe for supper club and everyone loved it.  I decreased the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup, left out the poppy seeds and used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. Blue Cheese made a great addition. I will make this over and over again.

This was a great salad!  I took other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar in half (and even then it was very sweet), I substituted pine nuts for the almonds (fantastic!), and did not add poppy seeds to the dressing.  It was sooo good!  I made for a dinner party and everyone raved and had seconds.  I really enjoyed the left-overs too, but be sure to add the dressing JUST before serving as is stated, otherwise, the spinach will be soggy (but still tasty).

Kudos Jamie!  I brought this to Easter dinner at my mom's, where our large family (about 38 people)loved it!  I doubled the recipe and added gorgonzola cheese, as some of the reviews suggested.  I did have about half left over, due to the fact that the kids wouldn't try it, and there were plenty of other delicious dishes, but the kids are not big salad eaters.  My husband took some to lunch and his comment to me was "this salad is KICK-***!"  My family is used to gourmet food, as my mother is a wonderful cook, so we will definitely have this salad again at our family gatherings, and I will make it again for dinner parties for friends.

FABULOUS salad. I made this for the first time for a dinner party and my guests coudn't say enough about how great this salad is. I used 1/2 pound spinach and 1/2 pound romaine. Also, I added crumbled blue cheese, it was the perfect combination and offset the sweetness of the salad nicely.

Great salad!  I actually made this for the first time over a year ago when I first got the recipe from Jamie who is a friend of mine.  I enjoyed it as much as the rest of you. Very tasty and visually appealing. Keep sharing Jamie!

Wow!  This was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I toasted the sesame seeds and almonds in the oven the day before, so it was a snap to serve on the big day!  It was also great with leftover Turkey added too!

Add one more satisfied person to this list.  What a delightful salad.  I used Ocean Spray Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries).  I highly recommend this recipe.  This is very easy to make and is really wonderful.  (You can save even more time by using diced onion from a jar...it is in the spice section).  Is also a very pretty dish.

Thank-you!!! I love this salad.  I doubled it for a potluck and it was all gone except enough to fill a cool whip container-I saved it for the next day hoping it would be ok and it was great.  I will be making this over and over. YUMMY!!!!

I made this with strawberries, and it was fantastic.  I browned the sesame seeds with the almonds to give them a more toasty flavor.  The dressing was a very good complement.

I tried it because of the rave reviews.  It's so yummy.  I don't like sweet dressing so I left out sugar.  Strawberry season is coming, will definitely try again.

I made this salad for my girlfriend along with "Best of Cream of Broccoli Soup" and it was fantastic!!  It tastes sweet because of the sugar in the dressing and the cranberries, and the oil from the sesame seeds adds a good flavor.  Very delicious!

I made this for a potluck for people at work.  It was an enormous success.  I came home with an empty container.  Several people requested the recipe.  A "must try".

Awesome salad.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I'll either use more spinach and Romaine lettuce or half the dressing depending on the number of people.  Thanks Jamie!

Everyone loved it! I found what really saved time was buying pre-bagged baby spinach instead of having to clean and cut the spinach too. It was a really quick and impressive addition to my meal.

I make this over and over again.  In season, I do substitute strawberries for the cranberries, toasted pecans for the almonds.  If I have it on hand, I use raspberry vinegar for the wine vinegar.

We have a church supperclub and we each bring a dish.  My turn for salad and I brought this yummy addition.  It was a hit and there were few remains on the plate.  No extra cranberries needed.  Dressing sweet but noone thought overly so.  Almonds a must!  Might try gorgonzola next time.

We had this on Thanksgiving. When I said that I was bringing a spinach and cranberry salad nobody looked very thrilled but when the salad came out to the table and everybody tried it they all wanted the recipe. The dressing totally cuts the bitterness of the spinach. Definitely stick with the fresh spinach. It's a little more work but it holds onto the dressing much better. Great recipe Jamie !!!!

Tossed this salad minus 1/4 cup of the dressing, put it in a spinach wrap (made 10) with sliced chicken breast (slowly roasted in olive oil, garlic, salt, white pepper & onions) and sold it on my food cart. Everyone that tried it said it’s a “must stay” on the menu. Thank you!

I made this dressing tonight for a 100 person dinner and it received many compliments. The only differences in the dressing were I didn’t use poppy seeds and i cut the sugar in half. It was still plenty sweet. When I trialled it last week with the planning committee, everyone said the dressing was just right for sweetness, and it was also suggested to leave out the poppy seeds. It is true, they don’t really add anything to this salad. The salad itself was mixed greens, cranberries, toasted almonds, sunflower seeds, and a few slices of apple (tossed in lemon first).

Love this recipe. Only negative is that once the dressing is on it the leaves start getting soggy. When I make this for my family I will pour dressing on each serving just before eating so that leftovers won't be soggy.

My sister turned me on to this recipe and OMG it’s delicious!!! I’m vegan so I used Earth’s Balance butter instead. I couldn’t find vegetable oil so I used extra Virgin olive oil. I also couldn’t find toasted sesame seeds so after browning the almonds I put the seeds on the pan for a couple minutes. Voila! Delicious!! Mmmm

Six stars! Toasted the almonds (skipped the butter). Did not have  sesame or poppy seeds and it was still awesome. Added some chopped pecans to compensate. Also added a can of mandarin oranges like others suggested. Only used 1/4 cup sugar. Next time I will add less than 1/2 cup oil. I think it would be great with cheese, too. (maybe feta?)

I've made this recipe a few times for summer picnics.  This time for Thanksgiving.  Goes great with a turkey dinner! Everybody loved it.
I made this dairy free by using a non-dairy margarine instead of the butter called for in the recipe.
Thanks for the great recipe.

We have made this at least ten times already for many different gatherings, and everyone always loves it! They always ask "What's that recipe called?"
After making it the first time we downed the sugar content, since it was a bit to sweet for us. The toasted almonds are amazing in it!
The third time we made it for a summer picnic, instead of adding cranberries we added sliced strawberries and blueberries. Everyone raved over it, it was so fresh and good!
One of the best salad recipes we've found!

Due to a busy schedule, I needed something I could bring to a pot luck dinner.  I thought it needed something  to make it look more attractive; therefore, I added mandarin oranges. It was the the hit of the party.

Every time I make this recipe - it's a hit!  I even make it without some of the ingredients, if I am short some (sesame seeds, onion) and it still gets rave reviews.  Although, I think the sesame seeds & onion make it even that much better.  Some changes - I never saute the almonds- always lightly toast them in the toaster oven. I also use a mix of salad greens, instead of all spinach & I use Craisins as other reviewers have done as well.  If doubling the recipe - you do not need to double the dressing, as it makes plenty.  I've also thrown in some mandarin oranges for a splash of color or if I don't have Craisins on hand.  And if taking it to a party - I bring the dressing along & add it once we are ready to eat so it doesn't get soggy.  This is a great go to recipe- love it.

This was great!  I think I could have cut the dressing in half to cut on sugar intake and calories!

I was really disappointed that this recipe uses a whopping 1/2 cup of white sugar!   I did make this but used about 1/8 cup of honey instead of sugar.  The honey was sweet enough. I will make this again but as modified.

Delicious. I also add bacon. It makes it amazing and really adds to the contrast of the sweet cranberries and acidic dressing. As for my walnuts, I just grind them up in the food processor.

The salad ingredients are good, but I had thoughts about mixing so much vinegar, nonetheless 1/2 cup of vinegar and I was right. I tried doctoring with garlic and other stuff.

Super good recipe! I could only find a 10oz. box of baby spinach, so the dressing amount was too much; I just added about 1/3 to 1/2 of what it made. Huge success! I'll defintely keep this one handy.

We brought this to an office dinner party and it was a huge hit. To make it vegan, can substitute the butter for vegan margarine (e.g. vegan Becel). Thank you for this great recipe!

I've given this recipe out more than I can count. It is that good. I keep the extra dressing and all the toppings ready because it's my go-to salad. It's a nice change from the classic poppy seed dressing type salad. The only change I make is to add a little red wine vinegar. I've liked adding pomegranate seeds, feta, chopped pistachios, and crisp pears also.

This salad was so tasty, my kids loved it! The only thing I changed was the onion, I used half of what was asked of. Next time I make this I will also reduce the sugar a little bit- a lil too sweet for my taste. Otherwise Fabulous!!!

I made this for New Years Eve dinner for seven people, and everyone absolutely loved it. Our daughter wanted the recipe, so she now has it . I am a diabetic, so there is too much sugar in it for me, but maybe I will make it for us using Stevia. Great salad!

I made recipe exactly as is and it was a hit.  I especially liked the crunch of the toasted sesame seeds.  Someone said " I don't normally eat salad because I don't like it.  This is the best salad I've had in my life and I must have the recipe." Now that's a recommendation!!  Second time I added crumbled Gorgonzola cheese which I really enjoyed as well.  I will always add cheese going forward. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I really loved this salad, although I bet I would like it better if I could find dried cranberries without sugar.  I always make a recipe the first time exactly as stated, but I just couldn't use 1/2 c. sugar in the dressing; yikes that a lot of sugar.  I used almost 1/4 cup and I thought it was delicious.  Those sesame seeds, yum!  And the toasted almonds, yum again.  I didn't use poppy seeds this time because I made it for company and people can be weird about having black seeds in their teeth, so I will add those in the leftover dressing.  I am sure it is the paprika and mixture of vinegars, but this dressing has a delicious, but unusual flavor that I loved.

I served this for 8 people and only used 7 oz. of spinach, but added all the same amounts of the rest.  I will have this again tonight!

Excellent salad, love the dressing. I have used it now on a number of salads and keep a fresh batch in the fridge.

It was a fine salad, but the dressing was about twice as much as needed.

ABSOLUTELY love this recipe, I also add Blue Cheese crumbles & sunflower seeds. I mix the dressing by the bottle & keep it stove-side. I also substitute the sugar with artificial sweetener or honey for the diabetic in the family.

Excellent dressing!  If you don't want to mess with chopping onion, substituting dried onion powder works.  Have used the dressing on a variety of salads.  Really good w/chevre.

Wow this was a great salad! I cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup I think next time I will cut it down more.   Its a very tasty salad and very easy to make.   You could really get creative with this salad.  Thank you for sharing it.

Great recipe. I will try to reduce the sugar as someone else suggested.  I don't think it will have any adverse impact on the flavor and make me feel better about how much sugar is in the dressing!

This salad is really delicious!   I dislike when people rate their own version of a recipie, instead of the published recipie.  So I give this 4 stars as is, but only because I bet it will be equally as delicious with 1/4 cup of sugar!  It was almost like eating candy for dinner!  But the flavors were so yummy, that I just know I'll make it again, just with less sugar.

I thought the recipe was great.  Used Craisins instead of cranberries.  I didn't use any sugar at all; it was definitely sweet enough with the Craisins.  Also cut the oil to half and used less of the vinegars.  Definitely toast the almonds, but be careful not to burn - only takes a minutes or so.

I roasted almonds and pecans on a sprayed cookie sheet- no butter.  Olive oil instead of veg oil and cut sugar by half.  This salad is outstanding!  I kept the dressing separate so the salad wouldn't get soggy.  Since making this for guests I now just make the dressing to keep in the fridge- I cut the sugar down to about a quarter of the original.  I make individual salads and just throw on some almonds/pecans or whatever nuts I have in the house and use whatever dried fruit- raisins, cranberries, plums.  I also add chopped red onion.  Easy and so good.

I made this as written to take to a pot luck and got raves.  This one is a keeper.  I'm interested in trying some of the alterations others have suggested, especially decreasing the sugar and oil.  We'll see if I still get the wow's!

Excellent recipe - found it too sweet, & only used half the sugar. The dressing makes a lot and can be used for another salad. Enjoyed it immensely though. (Also added some feta cheese to make sweet & salty taste - was wonderful!)

Everytime I have made this recipe, people love it.  My dad requests it everytime we offer to make dinner for my parents.  We don't mix the dressing with the salad, we add it to each serving.  This way when we refrigerate the leftovers, it doesn't get soggy and still tastes good for days and days.  Great recipe - and that's coming from a girl that used to hate spinach!

Took it to a potluck supper and everyone raved about it. IAs others said it was very sweet I added the sugar a little at a time. And only needed 1/4 cup. I also added feta cheese and mushrooms but  adding other vegetables didnt change the great taste. Nor make it taste better. Just adds more substance.  I recommend making it as written maybe do the sugar like I did till you find the sweetness you prefer. And I don't recommend you use any other dressing.

This recipe is amazing!  I followed everything exactly, but just added crumbled feta cheese and it was delicious.  The key to this recipe is the dressing - it's just sooo good.  I would follow it exactly as listed.  I brought this to a potluck and it was gone so quickly.

Didn't like it so much. The dressing when I made it was too sweet and little too much strong. I would recommend to make the ingredients for the sauce lesser of what's asking and put less of cranberries too. Unless someone likes too sweet and strong on vinegar and other liquid sauces that comes in it.

I served this recipe for my Book Club's luncheon, and everyone raved about it.  I followed the ingredients as written.  It makes a lot of dressing, so I saved it for another time.

So good! This is a keeper. I followed a couple of tips from the other reviewers and cut waaay back on sugar, toasted almonds and seeds in the oven without butter, and served the salad with blue cheese. Served this salad at a Christmas party. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I'll be making this again and again.

This is my favorite and no other vinaigrette will compare to this. I don't toast the almonds I just throw them in the way they are, also pecans taste amazing in this too.

Made this salad for the first time in 2012 for Christmas, everyone was raving about it, that made me extremely happy especially since I didn't even get to try. Ever since then whenever we have a gathering that's one of the things everyone wants me to make. It is devine!!!! and eveyone should make it!! The only change I do is add less sugar because I like it less sweet.

This was a delicious salad.  The only substitution I made was replacing the 1/4 c. white wine vinegar with 1/4 c. cranberry-pear balsamic vinegar I happened to have in my pantry.  Everyone loved it!

Just made this for a potluck and doubled it for my family - it is a REALLY good salad, but the next time I make it, I will cut the sugar way back, as the dressing seems overly sweet. I'll also add some walnuts next time as well.

The dressing called for cider vinegar, which made me skeptical in the first place, but after trying this recipe, I can guarantee that I will not be making it again. The salad itself was too plain and the dressing was horrible.

I love spinach salad and I did not like this recipes dressing, maybe it was the vegetable oil. Plus, if I had used all the dressing, the salad would be swimming. Nothing to brag about this except the spinach and cranberries.

This is one delicious salad!  I will be making again--frequently.  To those worried about the amount of sugar, I used Truvia (of course keeping in mind the Truvia to sugar conversion ratio), making no other changes to the recipe, and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe Jamie.  This one's a keeper.

This has become a regular staple at my dinner table when I have company. Its very easy and a crowd pleaser every time. Sometimes I leave out the butter and just toast the almonds in a frying pan and its still very nice.

I make the dressing the day before I need it. I frig it overnight that gives the ingred. a chance to marinate together. The sugar is way too much. You don't need to use all of the dressing you put it on the salad according to how much salad you have. When I have a large group I have them put their own dressing on that gives them the opportunity to use the amount that they want. I always have this dressing on hand just to use at my time on other types of salads. This salad does not save well if leftovers because of using the dressing on it.

This was so amazing.  One of my family members doesn't eat meat or dairy.  This recipe is perfect.  In fact, my husband thought there was bleu cheese in it.  There's no cheese at all.  I personally can't fathom a salad without cheese....LOL..this is such a keeper.  I will make this again and again.

MMM, MMM    This is a very good recipe,  The dressing gives the spinach the perfect taste, the toasted nuts & seeds really top it off!  I did toast mine in a dry non-stick pan and it worked great.  After looking through a lot of the reviews, I think I will add some of the typical spinach salad ingredients next time, such as crumbled bacon & sliced eggs, the blue cheese looks interesting, but as it is, it's wonderful.  Everyone at our supper loved it!  It makes a large salad though & doesn't really keep well, the spinach totally wilts, so change the serving size to suit you.  I will be making this again & again, thank you for sharing this!!

This is a summertime favorite and so versatile. My healthier version is to toast the almonds and sesame seeds together on the stovetop with no butter and to use grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil and decrease the sugar to 2 tablespoons..or if I choose to make this SINFULLY delish... I still make the subs noted above however,  I add boiled eggs, bacon, blue cheese and sunflower seeds.  Did I mention versatile?

This is the only salad dressing we use anymore!  I add chopped yellow peppers, carrots, radishes, croutons and shredded cheese for a really awesome and beautiful salad.

This recipe is fantastic!. I made a couple of times for my husband and I and we both love it.  It is a little sweet and tangy. I lessen the sugar amount to less than a cup. The buttery almond adds great taste to it. I also toasted the poppy seeds and sesame seeds from the same pan I roasted the almonds in to bring out the flavor

I love this salad!  Over the years this recipe, and the recipe for Strawberry Spinach Salad have become my go-to salad recipes.  They never fail to impress and are delicious!  I keep this dressing, and the dressing for the Strawberry Spinach Salad mixed up at all times in mason jars in my fridge, I make them that much!

My Mom made this recipe tonight.  I was not too excited, since I don't love salad.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good Caesar or the odd vinaigrette salad, but I don't love salads as a rule.  However, one taste of THIS & I was SOLD!  YUM!!!

I made this salad for my family Christmas dinner and I received rave reviews from my family.  I've made it several times since Christmas and it is always great.  One time I added gorgonzola cheese and mandarin oranges and it was even better.

This salad and salad dressing it very good, but not original.  I've been making it for many years from my cookbook, "Creative Cooking The Costco Way".  The recipe is called, "Cranberry Almond Spinach Salad".  I suggest you make this as you will undoubtedly love it, however, "Jamie" didn't create it.  I'm as happy as the next person to share a recipe, but won't try to pass it off as my own creation.

Just made this for Christmas dinner.  SO good that many people came back for seconds!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I doubled it because we had 20 people for dinner) It was delish!  Didn't use all of the dressing, but am looking forward to using up the rest for NYE!

This recipe is fantastic. I wasn't quite sure how to toast the seseme seeds though..in butter? Eh, either way it turned out well. I made it twice in one week. I added manderine oranges, pecans toasted in butter and brown sugar, and toasted minced garlic.  Great seasoning! A great starter spinach recipe that you can play with in so many ways. I made it with the vegetable oil the first time then extra virgin olive oil the second time. The vegetable oil seemed better, but I'll try other oils in the future.

I was skeptical...this kind of salad isn't my thing. BUT, I loved it and apparently so did the rest of the families at the Ronald McDonald House where we served dinner.  The bowl went empty when all the other kinds of salads didn't!!  I will definitely be making again.  The only change I made to the recipe was to toast the nuts/seeds at 350 for 10min instead of using butter like other posters suggested.

I made this salad/dressing as is and gave it 4 stars. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt the dressing called for too much sugar. So, I would recommend either half the sugar called for, or maybe a little over half, depending on your taste. I would also make the following slight adjustments:  Use shallots instead of minced white onion, blend the dressing ingredients together in a blender (except for sesame and poppy seeds), then add the sesame and poppy seeds to the salad, itself. With those adjustments, I would definitely make this dressing again!

Yum! This was REALLY good!!! Since I was serving a hearty main dish (baked mostaccioli) and only three people, I halved this. To my surprise, not a DROP was left! I had to fight my mom for the last bit of salad lol! When my hubs is out of town, I like to make things I've always wanted to try but know he wouldn't care for (he's SOOOOO picky haha!!!). He is away on business this week, so I'm trying out a few new recipes! Having my parents around to keep me company is just an added bonus. :) As if this isn't PERFECT as is, I made a couple of (minor) changes. I added ~ 1/2 c. of crumbled blue cheese to my salad and subbed sliced almonds for slivers (all I had). Although delicious with the cheese (what's a salad without cheese??!!??!!?), I'm sure this would have been EXCELLENT without it. As a matter of fact, I'll probably leave it out next time. NOTE: DO toast your almonds in butter as directed! It makes a HUGE (and tasty!) difference!!! If you're concerned that your almonds will be greasy, set them on a paper towel-lined plate to soak up any excess butter. Toasting on high heat will also help (to absorb the butter), but you'll need to watch VERY carefully to avoid burning / scorching. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Jamie. My dad requested that I serve this AGAIN (next weekend) for his Bday dinner! :-)

Will make again. I did not add the dressing to the salad all at once. I don't like salad wilted and I did want some for work the next day. Just made the dressing and put in a salad dressing bottle and added as needed. Great taste. I like that it is homemade not bottled.

This is a fantastic salad!! I have made it numerous times and I always get compliments. I tried to cut down on the sugar because I started to think it was too sweet but after I began to mess with the recipe it was not as good, so I decided to just not worry and enjoy it. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I love the dressing! I usually make a spinach, goat cheese, toasted almond, and strawberry or roasted beet salad using this dressing. It's fantastic! My husband loves it, and we don't really even use store-bought anymore. Thanks!

This was fantastic!  I only used 1/3 cup sugar, sliver sliced almonds,  and no minced onion because I didn't have any:) I took it to a get together with friends and everyone loved it.

This salad was a complete hit.  I also threw in homemade croutons as I tossed it and the bowl it was served in was literally wiped clean.  For the croutons I bought I loaf of french bread ($1.00), cut it in cubes (I only used half the loaf) and tossed the cubes with 3 tbsp melted butter and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  When dinner was almost ready I threw them in the oven with the potatoes I was cooking on a separate cookie sheet for just a few minutes.  They were crunchy and soft and just about everyone had seconds (those who were quick enough!).  Easy and delish.

This was really good, but probably didn't need nearly the amount of dressing that it called for. I think I might just halve the dressing next time.

This salad is really yummy, but add feta to it and it becomes even better!!!!  I have also added praline pecans b/c that was the only nut I had in my house and that was also quite a nice addition :)

This is an excellent salad.  I have used sugar substitute in the dressing, and it tastes just as good.  I have also added chicken to this in the past to make it a main dish, and will try it with fresh strawberries in the summer instead of the dried fruit.  This is definitely a staple in our house.

We had a birthday potluck, it was the first empty bowl!!  So simple, so tasty!  I had feta cheese and pomegrante pips for toppings, but most people ate the salad as is.  Score one for easy.

I have been making this salad for many years now.  It has been a hit, even with those who do not like nuts in their food.  The only change I made was to substitute the sugar with Splenda.  This is wonderful with Thanksgiving dinner, but also great with a grilled Talapia.

Spectacular! I would give this 10 stars if I could. Fabulous tasting dressing. The only changes I made was to use balsamic vinegar in place of both cider and white and used olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil. I didn't have poppy seeds or sesame seeds, but did have sesame oil and threw some of that in. Even with the changes it still turned out delicious. I would love to try it with the poppy & sesame seeds as I'm sure it would make it that much better!

"Best salad I've ever had" was a comment one of my dinner guests made! I used three 6 oz bags of baby spinach, 2 cups of almonds with 3 tablespoons of butter and 2 cups of dried cranberries. I did not use onions bc some of my guests do not like them and they were not missed at all! I will make sure I always have these ingredients and will never make a different salad.

This is absolutely delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I have brought this to both mine & my husband's family holiday celebrations since the first Thanksgiving I tried it out 4 years ago.  Everyone loves it & our entire family has the recipe! I also like to use crumbled gorgonzola & bacon sometimes.

I think the dressing made this salad!  It looks so pretty in a glass dressing bottle because the oils and seeds all separate.  I brought this salad to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  Next time, I might add more to bulk the salad up though, like red onion and cucumber?

OK so I'm not a huge salad fan in general, as a matter of fact I usually avoid at all costs.  However, since I had a dinner party and really needed the salad since so many others actually enjoy a salad with their dinner.   This was one of the best I've ever had. I had mistakenly bought poppy seed pie filing though and it was to late so I tried it , made it a little sweet but it actually GREAT.   Of course since it's a little sweet I could not use as much of the dressing as this makes but the sweetness of the cranberry and crunch of the almonds was right on!

Very tasty.  I made 1/2 recipe using 1 bag of prepackaged spinach and mixed lettuce for 6 people which was plenty and used only a small portion of the dressing (the dressing recipe is WAY too much for even a full recipe of salad).  Do not use butter when toasting the almonds!  I followed the recipe and did use butter which only made the almonds greasy and added calories.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the greasy almonds and tons of leftover dressing!  My guests liked it.

I scaled this down to two servings - my husband's only complaint was I didn't make enough! I followed the recipe to a T and it was great! I would try adding feta next time for variety. 

Follow up: I make this all the time now but make the following adjustments for personal preferences: substitute olive oil for the vegetable, substitute Pam rather than butter to toast the almonds, cut the sugar in half.

Very tasty salad.  I have modified the amount of sugar in the dressing, even cutting it to 1/2 the amount, and it is delicious.  I've taken it to a couple of dinners with friends, and it has been a big hit.

I had to make a couple of changes since I am allergic to almonds so we cut those out and did not toast the sesame seeds.  We also did not have any minced onion and the salad was still delicious!  I would love to try it next time with some cheese on it.

Loved the dressing. I did not have poppyseeds, but I used white and black toasted sesame seeds and whole almonds...might chop them a bit next time. Will not use butter next time either. Would rather toast in dry heat and not have the extra calories.

It's no wonder this is one of the most popular salads on the A/R site.  My company loved it!  I did substitute splenda for the sugar to cut some calories out.  Over than that, followed recipe.  Will definitely make this again and again.

When my sis-in-law came to visit, she introduced us to this amazing salad.  We ended up grilling lightly seasoned chicken and cutting it up and tossing it into the salad with everything else.  Awesome and the perfect summer dinner!

This is a delicious salad that I make  fairly often. The only change I make is to reduce the sugar to 1/3 of a cup and I toast the almonds dry instead of in the butter.

Wonderful!!!  I made this for my husband's family and they all raved about it.  There was barely enough left to take to work for lunch the next day!  I cut the sugar down to 1 tablespoon and omitted the butter.  It was wonderful.  I am making it again and using dried cherries instead of cranberries.  Can't wait to taste it.

Delish!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I didn't do the butter and almond things, I just toasted it slowly in the oven.  I also didn't have white wine vinegar so I used balsamaic vinegar.  I did have to add some salt to the dressing though it was too bland for my taste and I cut down on oil and sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as written, except for the fact that I was out of slivered almonds...so I used sliced ones instead. I was also out of white wine vinegar, so I used all cider vinegar instead. The combination of flavors was delicious, but I felt that either there was too much dressing, or the dressing was too sweet. Or maybe it was a combination of both. If I make this again, I'll definitely reduce the amount of sugar, and probably the amount of dressing as well. Thanks for sharing...this is a great, simple, and tasty salad!

Very good!  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but I came close, and it was wonderful.  I used Raspberry Balsamic and Apple Cider Vinegar in the dressing.  I can't wait to have the leftovers in my lunch tomorrow.

This salad is delicious and really colorful and beautiful.  I made it for a luncheon, and 3 people immediately asked me for the recipe.  I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used balsamic vinegar and cider vinegar.  Delicious.  I will absolutely make it again.

This salad was easy and very tasty, but it wasn't transcendental or anything.  I toasted the almonds on a cookie sheet at 350 for about 12 minutes, with a few shakes every couple of minutes, and they tasted so much better than raw almonds would have.  And as per others' suggestions I used only 1/4 cup of sugar.  I will definitely make this again if I have spinach lying around.

This is a great salad and the dressing is phenomenal.  I make the recipe as written usually but one time I only had red wine vinegar so i used that and it was still amazing.  i use crumble blue cheese and pine nuts since I am allergic to almonds.  I love how versitile this dish is.  Sometimes I add chicken and serve this as a main course.  I also think this is a great salad to bring to the beach.  I personally like putting the dressing on before leaving my house so the salad soaks up the dressing.  tastes amazing!

Amazing salad! Like other suggestions, I toasted the almonds in the oven. Also, though I followed the recipe to a T, I will probably use significantly less oil next time to cut the calories because I'm sure it won't affect the taste. Again, this is the most awesome salad! Loved it!

I love it and make it many times throughout the year. The dressing is what makes it stand out.  I do usually reduce the amount of sugar. When in the mood I add strawberries and some feta cheese.

This is the best salad ever.  Everytime I serve it - it get's rave reviews.  I have taken some suggestions from others that have tried this.I mix romaine wiwth the spinach.  I also us Pomagranet vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  I also sometimes substitute the cranberrys with dried cherrrys or cranraisens.  Also, to cut down on the calories I use Splenda sugar blend.  One last thing - you have add Gorgonzola cheese.

This is a great salad and is easy to make. I used garlic instead of onions and omitted the poppy seeds and sesame seeds. I can't believe how easy it is to make good salad dressing from scratch, and it's much cheaper than buying bottled stuff in the grocery store This dressing also doesn't have all the preservatives and other potential unhealthy ingredients in bottled dressings. This is now my favorite salad recipe!

A wonderful salad! However, I use red wine vinegar (instead of white), apple cider vinegar & extra virgin olive oil (instead of veggie oil) I've made this several times. It's so delicious! The dressing is excellent and my husband also loves it. It works well with spring mix greens and walnuts too if you don't have spinach and/or almonds.

AWESOME!  A crowd pleaser.  Everyone wants the recipe.  I used prepackaged toasted almonds from my grocery store's produce section.  I also add 2 diced pears and some thinly sliced red onion.  Delicious and pretty.

This produced a decent dressing.  I cut the oil (used evoo instead) and the sugar in half and that turned out fine.  Nothing extraordinary though.

Wow, I was looking for an easy good salad, so that I would WANT to eat something healthy and this is the bomb!  I did add arugula which  made it even better! I used romaine salad mix with the spinach also like others have.  Really, this dressing could be used on about any green salad.  I think it's the sesame and almonds that make it so good--please try the ARUGULA though, so good I can't stop eating it!

Served it for Christmas Dinner and I think everyone loved it!  I did make a few changes, diabeties is rampant in my family so I substitued the sugar with 1/4 cup Splenda.  I also used 1/4 cup peanut oil and 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  Will certainly make this again and often!

This dressing is great.  I made a delicious Thanksgiving dinner & served this salad with it.  I got more compliments on the salad than I could count!  I had to make several copies of the recipe for family members to take home.  I'm making it again tomorrow for Christmas dinner with friends.

This recipe was so delicious, but there are a couple of things that I would like to mention.  I used the toasted and flavored almonds that are found in the salad aisle instead of toasting them myself.  I have 3 kids.  I don't toast nuts.  I also reduced the sugar as suggested in some reviews.  I only used 1/4 c.  Also, this made WAY more than 8 servings.  More like 20.  I would make this again in a heartbeat.  In fact, I served it at a ladies dinner, and have had several calls requesting the recipe.

This is an amazing salad!! I have never, until having served this dish, seen people go back for seconds on salad. I halved the recipe my second time making it, not wanting any leftovers, and ended up running around in the kitchen because people were begging for more. I do think this serves more like 12 people. I served this for Thanksgiving and at a Christmas party, following the recipe exactly the first time and the second time leaving out the sesame seeds because I didn't have an- they were not missed. This is a very hard dish to mess up. It is super simple! You can really play with this. I added a large can of mandarin oranges. Highly recommended!! I'll make this again and again!

I would give this more stars if I could. Made for Thanksgiving and later a dinner party. Rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Only change I made was to add crumbled goat cheese. Fantastic!

A friend asked us to bring a salad for dinner. We were out of lettuce and tomatoes, but we had some spinach and cranberries. I have to say, this was the best salad I have had in recent memory. I had to improvise a bit based on what we had on hand (substituted sunflower seeds in place of the almonds) and chose to do so in other ways (used less than half the recommended sugar), but overall I stayed relatively true to the recipe and was rewarded for doing so.

One of the best salads I've had in a while, definitely was perfect for thanksgiving as a healthy side! I added all the sugar, but it was a little sweet, I think next time I'll decrease the sugar. I also subbed in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and walnuts, only because that's what I had available - yum!

I made it for a dinner we made for friends. We left out poppyseeds, added in feta, it was perfect! Will definitely make again. I roasted the almonds and then used paper towels to blot out the extra butter afterwards.

I've made this recipe mulitple times and the only change I make is swapping out the spinach for a mixed baby field greens (from Sams club). No other changes. Whatever greens you use, it's phenomenal!  Made a double batch last night to take to a banquet and both bowls were gone in minutes way before the conventional salads! Perfect for pot lucks, easy to assemble at site. Highly recommend, try it, you will NOT be sorry!

I kept the dressing as healthy as possible, so I did not use butter.  I used a pack of trail mix instead of the individual seeds.  I also used balsamic vinegar to substitute both of the vinegar.  Added olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  The salad dressing is a hit everytime and people always ask for the recipe.

My girlfriend (not an AR member) brought this over last night for a potluck and I told her I would rate it.  It is definitely a 5!  Wow, what a flavorful, delicious salad.  She used a beautiful mix of greens with the spinach, and everyone raved about it.  She said she had to spoon the seeds over the salad as she didn't use all of the dressing, but otherwise no changes made.  I've added it to my recipe box, and will make this myself!

This was my first time ever eating spinach, and I was a little worried, until I tasted it!! This was so good that even my super picky mother LOVED it. I think I will add crumbled bacon the next time and maybe 1/4 cup more toasted almonds, only because I loved the almonds. Way to go on a GREAT easy recipe!!

This is by far the best salad I have ever made.  Ignore those who didn't like it, maybe they didn't follow the instructions?  I omitted the poppy seeds and almonds (as others suggested) and used toasted pine nuts and sesame seeds instead (without butter), added blue cheese and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Well lets just say that my husband and I basically ate this for dinner and left the chicken for the next nights leftovers.  I even ate the small leftover salad portion for breakfast the next day!  Will definitely make again, and again and again......

Great recipe, except I used between 1/8 to 1/4 Cup olive oil, original was too oily...the rest as is.  Make this and I guarantee someone will be begging for the recipe.  Make sure not to pour dressing on until right before serving because it will wilt fairly quickly. However, it is such a good recipe that it even tastes good wilty...strange but true....

Excellent. I added thin-sliced red onion. Didn't have cider vinegar, but it still tasted great. I did cut the amount of sugar and oil, and toasted the almonds with just a hint of sun-dried-tomato oil, instead of butter. I crumbled some feta on top and it was NOM NOM.

Fabulous salad!  I did improvise using Balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar & added some thin sliced red onion.  It was a hit...I was accused of not making enough.  I will definitely make this one again.

Good salad. I would cut on the vinegar, or choose a good variety of white balsamic, as it is ways too tangy like this.

We love this salad and make it often.  I gave it four stars because:  1. You don't need the butter for the almonds, makes them greasy.  Dry toast them in a pan.  2.  Cut back on the sugar by half.  3.  Makes a lot of dressing, do not put the entire amount on.  Add gradually.

perfect exactly as is written- although i would say that it makes WAY more than 8 portions. Every time i make it, someone asks for the recipe.

Very good, but I agree with others about the dressing. I would only use it as needed, also, instead of pouring the whole mixture into the salad. Also, obviously...this salad is best when eaten right away. We had some left over after dinner, and just two hours later after being in the fridge, the spinach was wilted and it just didn't taste the same. My husband enjoyed this salad more than I did, so I will make it again.

I take this salad everytime I have a potluck or family gathering.  I'm always asked by several people for the recipe and I always take home an empty bowl.  It is delicious!!!!

I've already made this recipe 4 times in the past two weeks! The dressing perfectly pulls this salad together. I either toast sliced almonds or pine nuts to put in and I've added crumbled gorgonzola cheese as well. The tiny amount (if any) that's been leftover gets soggy and wilted, but I shamelessly ate it up anyway- still delish! This was great because I made the dressing up the day before and let the flavors join overnight. The rest is super quick to throw together last minute.

I've been making this salad for years -- it was the first recipe I ever tried from this site.  I often take it to potlucks and small group meetings, and people always go crazy for it!  I make it according to the recipe; I think toasting the almonds in a bit of butter really ups the flavor.  I do use Craisins, as other reviewers have suggested, and also sometimes throw in some blue or gorgonzola cheese, but otherwise, I stick to the recipe, and it always turns out great!

Made for dinner and it was a great hit. I didn't have white wine vinegar and used red; it was just fine.  Will make this again and again!

I love, love, love this recipe and have used it for years.  I recommend cutting the sugar in half.  I use it pretty much as is in the fall and winter.  In the spring and summer I switch out the cranberries for fresh berries and mandarin oranges (I have also used fresh pineapple),switch out the almonds for pecans, and romaine and spring mix for the spinach (don't forget to keep the sesame seeds).  It is fantastic!  You can make the dressing and toast the nuts and seeds the day before.

If you would like to make this a 5 star recipe, then add 2-4 sliced green onions. It's a bit sweet without them. Overall, I really enjoyed this salad. I agree that it would be a great salad to bring to a potluck or for get-togethers. And very simple for "no hassle" dinners.

I followed another reviewer's recommendations and added blue cheese and did the toasted pine nuts and sesame seeds rather than the butter/almond combo. I LOVED it - had enough dressing for the next two nights. I would try the almonds next time. Another nice addition is thinly sliced red onion.

This is, by far, my favorite salad and dressing. I have made this for years, but I guess I forgot to review. The dressing, although sweet, is not *too* sweet (like some spinach salad dressings).  And has a nice tang from the vinegar. Wonderful salad Jamie!

I was really curious about this recipe because it had 600 reviews when  i first used it and now is 1000 plus reviews! and yes it does deserve it! I have used all the same ingredients except poppy seed .. I put almond instead. The dried cranberries is a must! Other times i also use toasted pinenuts! to make it extra tasty . I put my favorite frsh shaved Parmesan cheese to get the extra taste!

I made this recipe for four of my lady friends yesterday, and everyone was impressed and wanted the recipe.  I took some other reviewers suggestions and used craisins, added one cup of gorgonzola cheese, and also added a tablespoon of sugar when I was toasting the almonds with butter.  Delicious salad that I will make time and again.  Thank you!

This was the BEST salad and so easy to make.  I followed one of the reviewers recommendations for using roasted pine nuts instead of the almonds and I also added gorgonzola cheese because I like cheese in my salads.  The dressing was so tasty.  Other than that, no changes.  This is definitely going to become a staple for our meals!  Thanks for sharing!

My sister-in-law is always asked to make the salad for family gatherings, because she makes it "the best."  Well, I had the in-laws over for dinner the other night and served this salad (replacing the almonds with pine nuts and leaving out the seeds), and my mother-in-law raved about it and said it was even better than her daughters!!  That would cause some family disputes if it got around!  :)

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  I have made this SEVERAl times at the requests of my friends.  It is definiely awesome!  I add about 3 ounces of blue cheese crumbles as well, and it is much better.  I also use half spinach and half butter leaf.  Try this recipe...you will love it!  It is so easy to prepart the dressing ahead of time as well and refrigerate it until needed.

This salad tasted SO good!  I give it a four star rating because of the high sugar content in the dressing.  I made it with far less and it still tastes great!

I continually make this salad after finding the recipe a few months ago. It is absolutely fabulous. I have never used poppy seeds, I don't really think they're necessary. Tonight, I didn't want to cut up an onion for 1 TBSP (I halve the recipe - it's more than enough for four people) so I just added about 1/4 tsp of onion powder to the dressing instead. Definitely the best salad recipe I've ever tried!

This has to be a case of everyone following the masses.  Why has this recipe been on the top 20 for so long? I couldn't wait to try it as all the ingredients sounded good. I love vinegar, but did not care for the salad dressing.  So much vinegar and just too overpowering.  Since I like vinegar, I gave it two stars.  But I serioiusly felt sick after eating it. The only thing I liked were the salty almonds with the sweet cranberries.  Just need to cut back on the vinegar or use a different dressing altogether.

I made this salad for a church potluck.  It was a hit.  Very different than the normal "jello salads" that normally grace the food table.  I now keep the dressing made up and in my refrigerator for everyday spinach salads.   The cranberries and almonds add nice texture to the salad.

pretty dang good.  i added a little sliced red onion, omitted poppy seeds, and added feta cheese.  i also reduced the oil by half and substituted splenda for sugar.  ummy-yummy!  For me and my husband, i made the salad and dressing separate, and put half the salad and dressing in separate containers for tomorrow, and then mixed the other half for tonight.  we both ate alot of salad tonight and are looking forward to more tomorrow night, when i will mix the 2nd half.

This salad was absolutely dee-lish!!! I added crumbled feta on top, just because I am a cheese-lover and wow, what a treat! I will continue to make this salad. Though not a fan of salad at all, my honey loved it-especially the toasted almonds!

Great salad; cut in half for two. My husband doesn't usually like sweet, but this is more of a tangy/sweet taste. My minor changes were: no sesame or poppy seeds, dried cherries instead of cranberries, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and minced onion as per earlier poster. We really enjoyed it, along with 1,393 others reviews!

it's good, but the sauce and toppings are a little too much for the amount of spinach.  I definitely had a lot of wasted stuff in the bottom of the bowl.  Next time I'll cut back on the dressing and toppings.

This is the best salad I have ever made, it reminds me very much of the *warm tomato and spinach salad* that we love at Bucca di Beppo's (our favorite Italian Restaurant) I made this according to the recipe with no changes. It is worth every star and then some.

YUM!  Everybody always loves this salad!  Do not add the dressing until just ready to serve because it tends to wilt the spinach.  Also, this recipe makes a huge batch.  I cut everything in half and toss it with a 9 oz bag of baby spinach.  I also replace half the veg oil with olive oil.  I omit the poppy seeds and add sesame sticks and crumbled blue cheese.  Oh, and I use 1/8 teaspoon onion powder instead of the minced fresh onion. :)

Made for Thanksgiving Dinner.  Rave reviews even from the non-salad eaters!  Added cubed pears and combined spinach with romaine for the green phobic.  Was asked for the recipe and the dressing could be used with any salad.  Delicious!

I think this salad was excellent just as is.  You could, for another variation, add bits of chopped chicken, but it's not essential.  Very good salad loved by everyone.

Mt family loves this recipe.  I took others advice and cut down on the sugar and slow browning sesame seeds and almonda is a must.  Another suggected adding gorgonzola cheese and this is a must also.  I am serving this with my Thanksgiving Dinner today!

I made this exactly as directed and it was awesome...oh, I did add some gorgonzola to top it off and it was amazing. I don't think I would toast the sesame seeds next time since I didn't think it was necessary. Enjoy!

My family hates spinach! Not now, I used baby spinach and omitted the sesame seeds as I did not have any on hand. My family now requests this salad. I have been making this for several years and it is always on the Thanksgiving buffet.I also have used toasted pecans in place of the almonds. The dressing is what really makes this salad pop.

Fantastic!! I had to bring a salad to a holiday potluck and was a bit worried about finding a good, but festive, recipe. True to other reviews, this salad was delicious. It was a huge hit! Only change I made was adding blue cheese crumbles. Will definitely make again!

Wow this salad is awesome.  I too cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and I think next time I will use a little bit less than a 1/4 cup.
I think I will make this for our next get together.

This is so very good!! I didn't have sesame or poppy seeds but I will get some to add the next (3rd!) time I make this. I used craisins as most other reviewers did. My only change was add feta cheese.  The dressing is to die for!!

This is one of the top-rated recipes on this site, and once you taste it, you'll know why. It's quick and simple but soooo good. The only things I alter are limiting the amount of oil in the dressing (to reduce fat) and leaving out the minced onion. I also use whatever nuts I have on hand - almonds, walnuts, etc. Mmmmm!

Wonderful - I followed some tips from other reviewers and it was a huge hit!  Used half the oil, half the suger, added gorgonzola to the salad.  I also added some diced red onion to the salad.  A keeper!

GREAT salad!  I served this with Sensational Sirloin Kabobs and Gourmet Mushroom Risotto all from this site.  I did use 1/4 c. sugar but would cut it down to 1 or 2 T. when I make again.  Used peanut oil as well.  I didn't add the cheese to it but it would be good with a chevre, blue or any other kind of crumbled cheese you may like.  The toasted almonds really add a lot and I did them on a sheet pan in the oven with no butter.  Next time, I'm going to use field greens or baby lettuce.  This is a keeper!

Very good! I love the sweet tangy-ness of the dressing, and the craisins. I added a pinch of salt to the dressing, and that made it perfect. I only had shaved almonds on hand, and they just didn't taste right. I would recommend only using slivered almonds, as the recipe calls for.

Great recipe!  I wanted to make it a dinner so I added jumbo shrimp.  Since the shrimp had been pre-cooked, I just made the dressing, marinaded the shrimp for a few minutes in the dressing and then pan fried them for about 2 minutes.  Other than this addition, and the omission of poppy seeds in the dressing, I followed the recipe and it was delicious!

Very nice recipe.  However, cut the oil in half and the sugar in half and it would be perfect.  I added some apple bits and golden raisins for variety.

I wavered between 3 and 4 stars. I gave it a four because I finally ate a whole plate of spinach! It was a bit too sweet and vingery for my taste. After listening to most reviews about cutting the sugar and oil in half, i did, and it still was too sweet. I think the blue cheese would have really balanced the salad, however, i'm a vegan :-(     I'll make it again though :-)

The dressing on the salad was just way to sweet for mine and my families tastes.  I tried the pine nuts and decided I'm just not a fan of them so didn't like that either. Overall, I won't make this again.

This recipe gets 5 stars only with the addition of bleu cheese. That makes it perfect. The bleu cheese balances the sweetness of everything else in the salad. This is such a crowd pleaser as I've brought it to several dinners. It's a sure guarantee! Do add the bleu cheese, though. It completes it.

Wow.  Wow.  Best salad I have ever had.  Non-salad people beg for more.  Thought we had way too much for Easter, but the bowl was empty at the end of the meal!!

This was a fabulous recipe. Based on other suggestions, I used less sugar and did not use all of the dressing when tossing. I also used toasted pine nuts and added some fresh pear slices and feta cheese. Great blend of flavors!

Tasty salad!  Easy prep...I bought packaged spinach, slivered almonds, and craisins, so all that was left to do was make the dressing.  I subbed balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar, garlic powder for the minced onion, and brown sugar for the white.  My fiance still thought it was a bit on the tart side, so I'm going to tweak the dressing to his liking, but overall great mix of flavors.  I can't wait to try it with some protein (grilled chicken breast or even some tuna)!

This is the best.  It's pretty flexible too...add fresh strawberries or blueberries.  Good with or without poppy seeds or seseame seeds.  Like it with or without almonds or other nuts.  Also good with some added feta cheese.

I have been looking for a recipe that is like a salad I have for lunch occasionally and I finally found it!  This is fantastic.  I did not use the poppy seed because I did not have them but it was still excellent!

It was not bad. I thought it (the dressing) would wow me more for the amount of rave reviews this recipe got. My Mom thought it was too sweet, we'll add some balsamic vinegar to the rest of our dressing to give it more sourness. Put roasted pine nuts instead of almonds and omitted sesame & poppy seeds, onions & used lettuce instead of spinach (didn't like spinach). Used 1/4 olive oil and 1/4 veg oil instead.

This salad is amazing.  I have made it dozens of times and everyones wants the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  There is one thing I have changed just for the sake of time, I use the prepackaged almonds and I eliminate the sesame seeds and poppy seeds.  It still taste great.

Good, but a bit too sweet for our tastes.  I omitted the sesame seeds and had to use white vinegar for the white wine vinegar bc didn't have it.  It was still delicious.   When I make it again, I will halve the sugar in the dressing.

This salad was a hit with everyone, including my husband (who did not like salads before until this one!), and kids as young as 6 years old.  Everyone had seconds.  I followed the recipe, but used light olive oil instead.
thanks for such a great recipe!!!

This was an easy delicious recipe! I followed the many other suggestions and added blue cheese crumbles, toasted pinenuts, other mixed greens and mandarine oranges in addition to the dried cranberries. The only other small change I made was adding a half teaspoon of dijon mustard to the dressing. Excellent recipe with a gourmet taste!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe, I had bought two bags of spinach that came with the almonds and cranberrys in a separate pouch included and I made the dressing from this recipe and it was really great.

Yum! I have made this at least 3 times and everyone (even the guys) love it. I like to add feta cheese.

I made this for the family dinner all enjoyed it immensely,even the 3year old,who is very fussy with her food.Although a littele too much oil,next time I will use less,There certainly WILL be a next time,I plan to make it for Christmas. I also added semi dried tomatos,which went with it well.

This is great I forgot the cider vinegar and everyone loved it.  This is great for company or just yourself.  I added chicken and made it a meal.  I did as suggested by someone else and put mandrine oranges in and a 3 cheese mix in and it was great.  I highly recomend to impress the guests

This salad has become our family favorite whenever we get together, even my daughter in-law who doesn't cook, makes this and gets rave reviews.  I just don't understand why someone gives a recipe 4 or 5 stars, and then goes on to tell all the changes they made to it.  This doesn't need to be changed a bit, it is wonderful just the way it is!

EVERY ONE of my picky-eaters family loved it AND asked for the recipe! I made this as a nice, healthy (ish) side to our Thanksgiving meal and they were astonished with the different flavours and overall presentation of the salad. The bowl was empty down to the last almond--I am very confident in making this now for my very picky-eater boyfriend! Haha, thank you!

I have been making this salad for years and cannot believe I have not reviewed it before.  It is one of my favorite salads. I use baby salad spinach, toast the almonds in the oven with no butter, and cut the sugar in the dressing down to 1/4 cup. This is always a hit, even with non-lovers of spinach!

My husband who never eats spinach couldn't get enough of this.  I do think that it makes WAY more dressing than is needed.  I recommend using only 1/2, or even 1/3 of the amount.

Love this recipe. To make things easier I sometimes used bagged baby spinach.
Mandarin oranges or strawberries definitely give it a punch.
I also recommend making extra dressing and refrigerating it for daily use.

This is an absolutely delicious salad. However, for 'healthier' eating tips i wouldn't suggest frying the almonds in butter, instead  i placed almonds in the salad without frying and it is just as delicious. The sugar recommendation in the recipe also was a little much, i found that 1/4 cup or no sugar at all is just as good. Otherwise, its fast and so tastey!

This was good, but not great. Sauteing the almonds made them somewhat greasy. I think just toasting them would be better. The dressing was good, but again, not great.

As the 1000th reviewer I am glad to say this is a great salad! I love cranberries because they are tart and the dressing went perfectly with it.  I also add either goat cheese or feta cheese for a red, white & green salad.

I got this recipe about a week ago, and I think I've eaten this salad every single day since.  It's really easy to throw together, and it's a taste that you'll keep craving.  I wish I would have brought some with me for lunch today, but I guess I'll have to wait 'til supper.

After reading many reviews about this salad i made it last night. I tweaked a few things. I didnt use poppy seeds, i cut the oil and sugar in half, and i added mandarin oranges to it. Oh and instead of using all spinach i used spinach and mixed greens. It was delicious!!!! I think the mandarin oranges are a must, they go so well with the dressing. This was a wonderful salad. The flavors go so well together. I will most definitely make this again. I have a BBQ to attend in a few weeks and i know it will be a hit. Of course to avoid the lettuce getting soggy but dressing on right before serving.

Not that this salad needs any more praise... but it is the best!  My boyfriend said it was the best salad he's ever had!  I kept everything the same, except added some sliced strawberries.  Yummy!!!

This salad is great!  I did make some changes.  I only used about 2tablespoons of sugar, olive oil instead of veg oil, and added some Feta cheese.  Really great salad!

What a great recipe!  I served it to two family members who swore they hated spinach and both went back for seconds.  My dinner guests are already asking when I will make it again.

This salad is so good!  I've made it several times now, and today, I made it with fresh cherries instead of cranberries and toasted almonds. It's great anyway to do it!

This was fantastic! It was loaded with almonds and dried cranberries so you could easily cut back on these items by half. In the future I would toast the almonds in the microwave to help eliminate some of the fat.  I also would have thrown in some blue cheese crumbles if I had any - not that it needed it.

A great salad.  My store was completely out of Craisins so I substituted strawberries.  I also added crumbled gorgonzola.  It was a big hit.

This was great.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I made it for my husband and I so I only used a little of the dressing but have it stored for future salads.  The second time, I used fresh, sliced strawberries instead of cranberries and we thought it was even better.  Can't wait to bring to a party and share it with others.  I highly recommend trying it with strawberries.  Yummy!!!

This is scrumptious!  The only change I made was to plump up my cranberries by adding a little water and putting them in microwave oven for a fewe seconds.  My company thought it was a winner, too.
Thank you Jamie!

This was a great recipe, I will make it again! I only added a few teaspoons of sugar though and it still tasted great. Next time I will use olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil and see how that tastes. This would also be a great marinade over cold pasta salads too!

I made this salad for a potluck and it looked very impressive and went over well too.  The only downside to this recipe is that is calls for a lot of ingredients. The flipside to that is that I have it on hand for next time-and there will be a next time. To save time and effort I made little packets of the dry ingredients (sugar and spcies) and they'll be fewer steps next time!

Absolutely FANTASTIC!

Followed the recipe, however I used Splenda instead of the White Sugar.  Tasted amazing.  I also used Baby Greens with Red Lettuce as well as roasted the nuts in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.  10 minutes may have been a little too long on the nuts, but other then that...the salad was a BIG hit.

This was expensive to make and didnt really win me over. Not sure what it was. I dont know if I make again. It may have been the dressing that threw it off.

Wow. This is my current favorite salad.  I substitute toasted pine nuts for the other nuts, red onion for the onion, and olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Everyone loves it.

this turned out really sweet.  Next time I would reduce the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup and then add more if necessary to taste.  Also, I am not a big fan of sesame seeds, so I would reduce that to 1 tblsp. This is a good base dressing though - you could experiment with different vinegars and spices.

I brought it to a company luncheon and it was all gone before I got to try it!  According to others, it was spectacular and many requested the recipe!

Delightful Salad, in taste and looks.
I'm going to try making it with splenda next time for sugar concerns.

I contributed this toward the family Christmas dinner expecting it to go untouched amidst all the starch and gravy and gooeys.  Instead it was devoured and my sister-in-law asked for the recipe.

I thought this was okay.. the dressing wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, so next time I'll go with what someone said and just use balsamic vinagrette instead.

I made this to accompany pizza at a soccer party. Everyone loved it and before I knew it the bowl was empty. Since there was dressing left at the bottom, I threw in another half a bag of spinach and that was quickly gone too.

Very good. Big hit at Christmas.  I don't think I burnt the sesame seeds, but their taste was a little pungent in the dressing.  Next time I will probably cut the amount in 1/2.  I used the suggested amount of sugar and didn't think it was too sweet like some did.  I also added feta cheese.  No leftovers and so easy to make!

I was expecting more, with all the five-star ratings this received.  I followed the recipe exactly except for a few sprinkles of bleu cheese on top.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  I still prefer my favorite walnut, cranberry and gorgonzola salad with raspberry vinaigrette.

This was wonderful.  For the butter I sprayed Can't Believe it's Not Butter into the pan to brown the almonds.  Instead of sugar, I used Splenda.  This has a great taste.

Fantastic salad.  I used spinach from my garden.  My husband hates salads so I made this for a party.  It was a hit.  I didn't have balsalmic so I used a mixture of white and red wine vinegar.  And I used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds.  The almonds were fabu.  I'm going to try substituting the spinach for broccoli next time.

Superb, superb, superb. I did everything as it was supposed to be done and I LOVED it. The mix of the dressing was different and I was quite pleased with how good it was. I may use pecans next time just for the sake of me liking pecans, however the almonds were great. Good job!

This salad is fabulous.  I made it as is except I halved the oil and the sugar as suggested by others.  I also decided to "toast" my sesame seeds by throwing them in with the almonds as I browned them in butter.  If this seems like a good idea, it's not!  They popped all over the stove like popcorn.  Otherwise, the salad was easy to make and the results excellent.

Loved the combination of spinach, cranberries, and almonds.  Didn't care for the dressing--too much oil, and the seeds just didn't add any flavor.  I'll try a different dressing next time.

This was a great salad!  I also lowered the amount of sugar in the dressing, but I sugared the almonds slightly instead of just toasting them.

This was a nice, colorful salad that tasted good.  I'm a bit of a salad snob, so I'm only rating this as 'good' but I'm sure others would find it a refreshing change from your usual iceberg-type salad.

Hands down, the best green salad I've ever tasted.  Made it for a party over the weekend and people were having 2 and 3 servings.  Added crumbled gorgonzola and used half the sugar, as many have suggested.  Unbelievably good!  I'm making more for my own dinner right now!

This salad is sooo good. I make a few changes that I really like.  I add candied walnuts instead of the almonds and I top it with some Gorgonzola cheese.  I just made this for a family gathering and everyone raved about it.  
I also buy the baby spinach in the bag and it makes it all the easier.

Fabulous! I grated the onion to avoid chunks that were too big.  I halfed the sugar AND the oil and used one of those "Good Seasons" itatlian dressing shakers, and it didn't compromise the taste AT ALL!  I hogged the leftovers the next day and added grilled chicken chunks and diced apples to make it a meal.  I ate it standing up in the kitchen, it never even made it to the table! Oh, and I used Spring Mix instead of just plain spinach. Edited to add: This is our Thanksgiving salad every year now.

My oh my!  What a fabulous recipe.  Just the perfect amount of crunch and sweetness.  The dressing is very light and flavorful.  I put too much on but still was wonderful.  Thanks for a great salad recipe!

Delicious salad to have with any meal. Also added walnuts and crumbled gorgonzola cheese to it. That really gave it the perfect flavor for me.

Served this New Year's Eve...everyone RAVED!  I added some chopped fresh Italian mozzarella (Bocconcini or any fresh type in water).  It added a nice texture and flavor...plus the green, red and white made it very festive.  The dressing is awesome.  This will be served many times!

this was ok.. I was expecting it to be spectaculer due to all the great reviews.  It was ok.  A little too much vineger taste for me.  I probably wouldn't make it again.  My husband & I did like it but the other guests didn't seem thrilled. sorry:(

This salad was divine!  I cut back on the sugar a little bit, as was suggested, and toasted the almonds and the sesame seeds on the stovetop.  Just simply amazing!  My mouth waters just thinking about it!

I made this recipe for a Christmas potluck party for 8 girlfriends.  They loved it!!  Many had seconds and asked for the recipe.  It is higher in calories than a plain salad, but the color and taste was great.

This is one of the best salad recipes I've ever tried.  I cut back on the sugar slightly and used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. Next time I will toast the almonds without the butter..didn't find it necessary. FABULOUS....my three year old daughter had two servings. That says it all!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  Cheated a little and bought baby spinach leaves in a bag.  I plated the salads in advance, adding only the almonds and cranberries.  Just before serving, I dressed them.  It makes for a great presentation . . . so colorful.  Just a caution, don't cook the almonds too long or they'll taste bitter.  I used the slivered almonds and had to make a second batch.  Glad I did.  Thanks for sharing, Jamie!  This was a great way to add green amongst all of the starches.

This is a wonderfully delicious salad. My wife and I made this for some friends, and the salad went quickly. The dressing was out of this world. I've made this dressing for other salads, as a marinade, mix in with noodles, etc. It's one of my favorites. The sweet of the sugar and the sour of the vinegar add a pleasant change to any salad. One thing, don't let the salad dressing sit for too long, as the vinegar will overpower the sugar and ytou lose that balance. All in all, my family loved this salad and dressing, and I will definitely make it again. For a added flavor, add bluecheese crumbles.

This has great flavor.  Slightly more vinegar than I like, and I will just decrease it by a tad next time, but that is just changing to suit personal taste.  Definately a keeper.

Very tasty and fresh.  Have made it twice now.  I really did not like the almonds toasted in butter with the salad.  Prefer to add divided cashews and crumbled bacon.  Lovely with strawberries in it!

We loved this salad.  Add my raves to all the others.  I made a few changes and substitutions, mainly to reduce the calories--cut the oil in half and used canola, cut the sugar in half and used Splenda(tm) granular, reduced the almonds to 1/2 cup and toasted them without butter.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing, Jamie.

Excellent!  I toasted my almonds in the oven rather than with butter.  The dressing is superb.

One of the absolute best salads I have ever eaten! Used a bit more cranberries and almonds than called for because they tasted so good in the salad.  Also used I can't beleive it's not butter to toast the almonds and extra virgin olive oil to make it a bit healthier.

This salad is awesome!! I added extra almonds and cranberries and it still turned out wonderful! I took it to a close friends family cookout and everyone raved about this salad...I would make this recipe again. It was very light and refreshing and I didn't have to worry about keeping it hot or cold before I got to the cookout.

I've made this salad three times since finding it.  It is really simple to put together and so, so good.  I put the spinach on individual plates, then sprinkle the almonds and cranberries over the top, and then pass the dressing for everyone to put however much they want on.  There is never a morsel of anything left on anyone's plate!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

First time making this salad, made it for Mother's Day.  Easy to make and very tasty! The salad got rave reviews, the bowl was completely empty and every woman asked for the recipe.   Used baby spinach which was perfect.  Other than that, wanted to try it per the recipe the first time and was very pleased with the result.  May try cutting the vinegar back just a bit next time but overall, could not get much better!

Whenever I make this it is gobbled up and someone asks for the recipe. I did reduce the sugar to about 1/3 cup and also left out the poppy seed. Very great taste. You will never miss the poppy seeds or the sugar. YUM

This is a must try! All my friends loved it and want the recipe.  I made up all of the dressing using 1/2 of the sugar it said to and I did pour it all on. Next time I will only make 1/2. I used a 9 oz bag of spinach leaves. As another reviewer said, toast the seasame seeds as they add a really good flavor. And of course the almonds are wonderful!

This salad turns out great, with very little effort.  I have made it a few times and everyone loves it.  Although, I think a all salads need cheese.  I usually sprinkle some goat cheese in, along with adding chopped red onions.

This is a fantastic recipe.  It is so easy to make and extremely tasty.  Everyone I make it for loves it!  I make the dressing the day ahead and put it in the fridge, I prefer to serve it cold.  I also used red wine vinegar and rice vinegar, and it was just as good.  Thank you!

This salad is fantastic.  If your dried cranberries are too chewy, consider soaking them in boiling water for 5 minutes and then draining them before use.

Great combination of ingredients.  I used less salad dressing.  1 cup of dressing seemed WAY too much for the recipe.  Used the dressing again for a second and third salad.

I could eat the entire bowl.  I made it with the following changes: omitted butter and dry toasted almonds in pan; substitued Splenda for sugar; used dried minced onion instead of fresh; white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar (couldn't find in the store) and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Good for low-carb diets, if they pick out the berries!

My family LOVES this salad. In fact, I make a double recipe of the dressing and keep it in the fridge. It tastes GREAT with the prepacked broccoli slaw. My 11 and 14 year old eat that all the time. I have given this recipe out sooo many times.

This recipe was great.  Tart and sweet at the same time.  I actually left out the oil by accident but it turned out wonderfully anyway.  Would recommend this for Thanksgiving dinner.

I made this recipe for our annual office Halloween Potluck and everyone raved about it!  I used Craisins and pecans because that's what I had on hand, and used Canola oil to lighten it a bit.  I tossed it at work just before the dinner bell rang...and it was gone before I could get back for seconds!  Definitely a keeper!

Make for Thanksgiving Dinner.  It was very good.  I did cut back on the sugar.  I also added cherry tomatoes and feta cheese, and I used Craisins. Everyone wanted the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I prepared the dressing, toasted the almonds, washed the spinich, and bagged the cranberries the night before and kept in separate containers in the refrigerator.
The next day before the picnic, I just added everything together just before serving. Easy and DELICIOUS! These two words don't always go  together but in the case of this recipe they definately do.  Everyone loved this salad!

Uh muh gawd! I made this salad for an ill-fated Christmas dinner (My FIRST Christmas dinner..and, yeah, I tried to get too fancy-shmancy using recipes unfamiliar to me [the main course was cooked in a PUMPKIN! Need I say more?]) And this lovely salad was the saving grace!  Everyone raved about it...as a matter of fact, it was the ONLY thing they raved about...Thank you, Jaime, for saving my butt!

This is good over and over again!  I use it for large groups and usually substitute Splenda for sugar and leave out the sesame seeds (due to allergies) so ALL can eat it.  It's always a hit :-)

If you want a winner, this is it.  I have made it twice.  Decreased the oil and used Splenda to taste (much less).  Tonight I added an orange.  Yummy!  You will not be disappointed.

This was a beautiful and delicious salad.  The flavor was excellent and the almonds gave it a nice crunch.  Many people asked me where I got the recipe when I served it at my sister's baby shower.

Excellent salad!! I found that the recipe made to much dressing so I stored it in my fridge and used it on other salads and there was also enough dressing to make the salad again.

This salad is a hit....I made it for the first time one Thanksgiving and from that point on friends call for the recipe all the time.  The only changes I made where instead of buying almonds and toasting them I buy the sunkist salad almonds which saves time and adds extra flavour, I use craisins for the cranberries and add feta, onions and tomatoes.

Thanks for such a great salad recipe Jamie. It's a keeper.

YUM! This was amazing. I did take some of the reviewers suggestions and not only cut the sugar in half, but used Splenda instead to cut calories. I think the sugar could be cut down even a bit more, but it was FABULOUS! We didn't have a lot of cranberries on hand, so we substituted with raisins and currents and it was amazing. THANK YOU!

I was skeptical at first, but made this to take to a ladies potluck luncheon. I took the salad ingredients made up in a large bowl and added the dressing when I got to the party.  Wow,it was gone in a flash, and everyone asked for the recipe.  This is awesome.  One of the best salads I have ever had.

i made this salad for a staff lunch, and EVERYONE wanted the recipe afterwards!  i used the advice from other reviewers to use only half the sugar--worked out great.  also, you can substitute 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of onion powder if you don't feel like mincing onions.

This salad was great, but a little too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar in the dressing, or maybe use Splenda instead.

This was so wonderful-I can't wait to make it again.  I used half the spinach and just saved half of the dressing.  I thought it wouldn't keep but it was even better the next day-just added it to another package of 10oz of spinach. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

This was a huge hit with the whole family, even my husband loved it and he isn't a big spinach fan.  I followed the suggestion of sauting the almonds and sesame seeds.  I'm going to keep some dressing in the fridge because it was really good too.

This recipe was so good.  I toasted the almonds and made the dressing before hand.  When dinner was ready, I tossed it all together.

This salad was the hit of our Easter buffet.  It has a unique combination of sweet, sour and crunch.  I did not use all of the dressing.  This salad will be part of future special gatherings.

Like many others, we had this with our Easter ham yesterday and it was just great. My husband kept dipping his ham into the leftover dressing on his plate! The toasted sesame seeds really give the dressing's flavor a punch. Toasting both the sesame seeds and the almonds are definitely a must. Suggestion if you have leftovers...don't dress the salad. Have people dress their own portions, then you won't have a problem with soggy leftover salad the next day. Thanks, Jamie!

Truly awesome salad!  Have made it four times in the last month, and I just can't get enough of it!  Served it to 18 people yesterday (Easter), and had to give out the recipe to several!  Great with Feta cheese, too.

This was absolutely fabulous!!  I've been wanting to try a good fancy salad and this just did the trick.  I did cut the oil in 1/2 and it still tasted great!  Toasting the almonds is a step you don't want to skip either.  Beware this does make a lot and would make a great party salad.  Others said it didn't hold up well overnight but I had for lunch the next day and it was still great!

This was the BEST salad that I have ever eaten! I made it as a side dish for my mother's birthday, and we gobbled it up!  This salad is great for picky people too because you can scale it to their tastes.  My father is too picky, so we omitted the cranberries from his salad, and I added chesse to his, and gave him his favorite dressing.  Everyone was happy!

Loved this!  It was a bit too sweet but I only had about half of the spinach called for and I used all of the dressing so that was probably my fault.  The toasted sesame seeds and almonds make this recipe.

The salad was good, but I didn't think it was spectacular.  I think if I make this again I will try the raspberry dressing suggested by another reviewer.  The recipe's dressing was not to my taste.  Followed the recipe, except adding blue cheese.

I used raw sliced almonds, unsweetened cranberries, and olive oil.  The dressing seemed a little oily to me, but my friends ate all of it in a matter of seconds!  Next time I'll use a little less oil, or maybe use a little sesame oil for variety.

Outstanding! I've made this several times to rave reviews. For a fast and delicious variation, use blue cheese dressing instead. It's fabulous.

One of the best salads I've ever had!!  Be sure to toast almonds, sesame seeds, and poppy seeds - adds a lot of flavor.  I added bleu cheese crumbles...mmm deliciuos combination of ingredients!  Everyone had seconds, the salad was the highlight of the meal!

I took this salad to a tea last week, and all of the women asked for the recipe.  This recipe is definitely a keeper! I also decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  To help save time, I used the Dole Spring Mix Salad in a bag.  It was a very pretty salad.

This was the best salad! I was tired of serving the same old green salad, so I decided to serve this at my sister's birthday dinner. Wow, what rave reviews it received.  Even my Dad, who doesn't think "fruit" should be included in a salad had seconds!!  This is a keeper. (I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and omitted the poppy seeds).

Even my picky in-laws devoured this salad!  To make it low-fat, I decreased the amount of sugar and oil (I used olive oil instead)and it came out fantastik! The changes did nothing to the taste.

This salad tastes great is looks elegant. Great for serving to guests. I found it a bit too sweet since the cranberries are already sweetened, so I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and it still tastes good. The amount of dressing is also too much for the salad, so next time I would use (1.5 pounds of spinach, 1 cup of cranberries and 1 cup of almonds) for the salad.

Awesome!  Always a hit!  I serve the dressing on the side and add extra cranberries.  Definitely best with baby spinach (when serving it to kids, try clipping off the stems - it's easier for them to chew).

I will try this again adding the blue cheese as one reviewer suggested. My first try I found it too sweet. Maybe less sugar next time as well. The cranberries and nuts, being heavy, tend to fall to the bottom of the bowl and so don't get even distribution in the salad. I will say though that the guests I had over the night I tried it were fans ... I just wasn't as convinced!

This was great!! I have gotten great compliments on this recipe. I have made it twice and the second time I didn't have enough white sugar so I subsituted for light brown sugar and it still turned out great. I will make this again.

I have made this salad several times, and every time men who aren't fond of salad scrape the bowl clean and ask for the recipe.  For Easter, I substituted 1 quart sliced strawberries instead of the cranberries.  I also cut the sugar and oil in half.  Excellent recipe!

This is such a great change of pace!  So simple and delicious. I did take the advice of a few others and cut the sugar in half, I also added a little goat cheese.  Yummy!  Will definitely make again and again!  Thanks!

I'm a southern cook known for her cooking so I'm always looking for a new recipe.  This salad is great. I used pecans instead of almonds and loved it. Thanks for a fresh new recipe!

I made this salad last night and got many Rave reviews.  We were enjoying so much we forgot the rack of lamb on our plates. I used romaine and mixed the dressing with the romaine in a big bowl.  Then I placed romaine on individual plates, sprinkled almonds and craisins in the middle.  Then I added 4 very thin slices of apple cut in half and placed across from eachother.  Great recipe - thanks so much!

Updating my review - we added some battered and fried chicken breast chunks. We poured some of the dressing directly on the chicken and put it in the salad. OH MY GOSH!!! It was so awesome. We just kept saying, man we're good!

I made this for my husband and he now thinks I'm a great cook. It's just like our favorite salad at our favorite restaurant. Then I made it for my mom's birthday party, and I am still getting compliments. I used distilled white vinegar and apple cider vinegar the first time. The second time, I halfed the white and added some balsamic - much sweeter. I think I liked it better. It's now in my repertoire as well as my mom's and her best friend.

This recipe sounded so good that I ran out and got all the ingredients.
I love salads that combine fruit with spinach, and this one goes to the top
of the list. What an absolutely delicious salad! We're having guests for dinner
next weekend, and I won't hesitate to serve this along with the meal.
I might cut back on the sugar a wee bit next time...but YUM.

This is the BEST salad.I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  The dressing is so yummy.  I added apples and left out the vegatable oil and used corn oil instead for the dressing.

This was the first thing I ever made that EVERYONE asked for the recipe!! I double it and it still wasn't enough! I couldn't find white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. I also used crushed ramen noodles as a topper Yummmm. I toasted the noodles (with it's chicken seasoning)almonds and sesame seeds in the oven with spray butter . It was great and alittle less fattening.

My husband and I loved this wonderful salad!  my children on the other hand did not (and that is saying something because they usually dig into salads - maybe that all their taste is in their mouth).  I will absolutely make this again - probably for two though.

This was good but a little too sweet. I've had similar dressings but I did like this one better. I also think it had way too many sesame seeds and poppy seeds. I would eliminate the sesame seeds altogether and halve the poppy seeds (just for looks anyway!) Oh, and I added diced apple too for color and crunch. Mmmmmm. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  This was my first recipe I made from this web site and it sure was terrific.  The dressing is what makes this salad so very good.  I also enjoyed the cranberries with the toasted almond slivers.  I will be serving this to friends and family.  I can't wait to share!

I did cut back on the sugar - we like a tart dressing.  The kids gobbled it  up - a good sign !

This is the most delicious salad I have ever had - period. It was also so easy to do - mix up the dressing beforehand and just add to the salad right before serving. I considered adding less sugar but didn't after reading the other reviews - they were right, too - don't change a thing! I used the washed baby spinach so I didn't even have to tear the leaves! Oh, I couldn't find white wine vinegar so used regular white and it was just delicious! You would be crazy to not at least try this recipe!!! YUM!!

This truly was a great salad.  Next time I will use bagged spinach...too long removing stems and tearing leaves.  Measuring the rest of the ingredients was time consuming also.  However, it was worth the end result.  The dressing was awesome. An attractive dish that we all enjoyed.

This is a wonderful spinach salad.  I liked the favor of the almonds with the cranberries.  The sugar gave it a very sweet and delicious taste.

I tried this recipe again, this time halving everything (small family) but the oil and not adding water. I could have made the full recipe after all!  It was MUCH better and I won't hesitate to make it for anyone or any occassion, anytime.  For us, it makes lots of extra dressing.  Thanks Jamie!  I'll be looking up your other recipes!

Served this at a family gathering two months ago.  Everyone loved it & requested the recipe.  I know for fact that those who requested the recipe have since served it to their own guests, again with sensational reviews!

From an individual you will rarely see in the kitchen, this recipe is great and I even had fun making it. The entire family loved it and we finished it off in one sitting. Great for special events, but so delicious you will want it more often than that! Thanks Jaime! We loved it!

I found this recipe the week before Thanksgiving and took the salad to a potluck. It was such a hit that many people asked for the recipe so they could make it for their Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for sharing this winner, Jamie!

This salad is awsome!  My husband loves it so much that I have made it with dinner three nights in a row.  It's so nice to have a change from a traditional garden salad every once in a while.  This is for sure a keeper! Thanks.

I was really skeptical about this salad because I'm not a huge cranberry fan, but it was wonderful!  I have sent the recipe on to all of my nearest and dearest and will be making it every chance I get.  Really, really good!

I made this 4 dif. times over the holidays and it was a hit every time - what a yummy recipe!  I didn't have poppy seeds, but I don't think they were missed, and I also added mandarin oranges once and it was even prettier.  Thanks!!

Made this for New Year's eve and everyone loved it.  I didn't "saute" the almonds but simply toasted them in a toaster oven to save a few calories and minutes.

i've made this salad three times in the last week for different holiday parties and can't believe what a hit it is. everyone loved it, even people who don't like spinach. i had to make three copies to give to people who tried it last night. it makes me feel like such a good cook even though i'm not.

Very nice flavorful salad. It was the perfect compliment to the Chicken Marsala I had it with. If you're serving wine with dinner however, the dressing may prove too sweet. Nonetheless a great easy recipe that my family will enjoy for years to come.

A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!  Need I say more?  This was a fabulous salad and dressing combination.  It was a hit for two Christmas parties and I definitely will share this in the future.  Loved the almonds and cranberries together.  BTW, I substituted the cider vinegar for RASPBERRY vinegar.  Scrumptious!

I served this for Christmas dinner. Everyone really liked it. I thought it was just O.K. but since it seemed to be such a hit I'll make it again. My mom asked for the recipe for one of her ladies lunches. I also added a can of drained mandrin oranges. It is a very pretty salad.

I found that the dressing was better if marinated overnight.  Fresh, not bagged, spinach pushes it over the top!

We didn't have white wine vinegar but we added a little white cooking wine and some plain vinegar. It still turned out great-maybe a little too sweet for some palates, but not for others.  The seeds and nuts work wonders for flavor.

I made this salad to bring to my husband's family xmas gathering.  It was a huge hit, the bowl was empty. The recipe is easy.  Just be sure not to add the dressing mix until just before serving. This is a keeper for sure!

Before I made this, my husband turned his nose up at the thought of having a spinach salad but once I made it, he went back for more.  He absolutely loved it, I liked it.  My husband thought it was sweet enough but I thought it was too sweet.  I added a little more vinegar to my serving to cut the sweet.  I'm serving it to guests this weekend and thought I might add manderine oranges and strawberries to it as well.  I would make again but probably only for special occassions.

This was d e l i c i o u s!  I didn't have any leftovers.  Even my picky husband had seconds.  Everyone loved the almonds.  I used the prewashed spinach which made this really easy and I used half the amount of sugar called for and it was perfect.  I impressed the in-laws with this recipe.  I am glad I finally tried this recipe and will definately make this again.  Next time will try strawberries instead of cranberries as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks!

WOW! This did not even taste like spinach.  Substituted  raisins for cranberries.
So delicious and healthy.  Apply dressing only when salad is ready to be devoured (or it will get soggy).

My wonderful frined Laura gave me your great cookbook.  I tried the salad last night for our family and neighbors.  We all just loved it.  Add the dressing just before serving.  I only made a small amount of salad and added a small amount of dressing and cranberries and nuts.  I have enough to have it again tonight.  I think red onions would be a great addition & maybe a little goat cheese.  Love this web site.  Marilyn Keare

I have made this recipe so many times and it is always a huge hit!  I do add 5 or 6 shakes of tobasco and a blop of Worchester sauce to give the dressing a little more zip.  I also toast the sesame seeds, poppy seeds and almonds in the oven without the butter and it works just great.

This is a really easy and delicious salad that is very addictive!  Instead of toasting the almonds in butter on the stove, I toasted them in the oven dry at the same time I toasted the sesame seeds.  I put each on a piece of foil and placed both on a large cookie sheet and baked at 350 degrees for aprox. 10-15 min.

I get raves about this whenever I serve it!  I substituted pecans for the almonds and omitted the sesame seeds.  Also, I sprinkled the pecans with just a bit of salt when I was done toasting them.

Decent salad recipe.  The spinach was a nice touch.  Toasting the almonds changes them dramatically for the better, but I don't think they needed to be toasted in butter.  I used the sweetened "craisins" and cut back the sugar in the dressing by 1/4.  My husband suprised me by commenting how good the salad was.  This would be great for a holiday dinner--easy and attractive.

Everyone loves this salad! The recipe is requested over and over. One tip: be sure to follow the advice to add the dressing just before serving. I didn't once and the whole salad went very soggy.

I was searching for a different recipe and decided on this one because so many people gave it a high rating.  Who said you can't please all of the people all of the time.  What a nice and different salad.  Great to take for pot luck as it's so much more interesting than the usual salads.  Mmmm, good!

Good but way to much dressing. Next time we'll only make half the amount for the salad size we're doing.  It is very similar to another recipe on the website.

Loved the basic recipe!  I added a diced Cosmic Crisp apple and used .  Would definitely recommend  this spinach salad recipe finely chopped shallot in the dressing instead of onion.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious!  As others have mentioned, it makes a lot of dressing so I just used part of it on the salad and saved the rest to use on other salads. I made the dressing the day before then mixed the salad right before serving and added the dressing. Make sure to whisk the dressing again before adding to the salad. I’m going to try it next time using goat cheese as others have mentioned. Definitely a keeper!

This was the perfect salad for our Christmas dinner with the extended family. It was easy to transport the individual ingredients, then toss it all together just before serving. Everyone absolutely loved it! I followed the recipe fairly closely, making only 2 changes which other reviews had suggested. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and added some crumbled unripened goat cheese. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this recipe as it is and I had left over of dressing, the apple cider vinager added a strong scent and I though is was overall too sweet. I cut in half the vinager and sugar and tosted in the oven the almonds, I reduced the oil in half and replace it with olive oil. The overall result was very tasty. I will prepare it again

This salad was awesome.   I only used 1/4 cup sugar and candied cranberry walnut mix with chopped roasted almonds;   I added a little finely chopped red onion on top, bacon and avocado.   It was pretty and very tasty - everyone loved it!

Wonderful recipe!    I didn't have vegetable oil so I used sesame oil, and based on other reviewers I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and replaced poppy seeds with mandarin oranges.   But I believe it would have been equally as delicious as written.  So quick and easy - thank you!

Love this salad, but especially the dressing. I use Splenda in place of sugar, and often use red wine vinegar or pomegranate vinegar in place of the white, but love it every time. As spinach wilts so easily, we avoid this by applying the dressing to individual portions only. (And feta or crumbled goat cheese makes a great additional as well!)

Made this for a family reunion and they literally licked the bowl clean!  I made this recipe as written, expect I didn't add sesame seeds or poppy seeds (didn't have either on hand) and I dry toasted the almond slices in the oven at 350 for 8 minutes.  It was delicious!! Will definitely make this again.

  Dressing was great, I used more apple cider vinegar than what was called for, but I love vinegar!  Had some extra and used on a lettuce salad and it was great.  Entire fily said this was a keeper recipe

Served this for the first time at a family get-together and everybody raved about. A few insisted on getting the recipe before they left.

I didn't have poppy seeds but otherwise followed the original recipe.

I can't wait to make this again!

One of my husband's favorite salads (and since he is a carnivore at heart, that is saying something!) I use this recipe for the dressing and then altered some of the ingredients. I use salted pecans, bacon pieces and feta cheese in ours. Tweak it any way you want.

I like dressings in the background. Let the salad ingredients shine. I squeezed half of a lemon into salad bowl. Added thinly sliced onion to the juice (the acid sweetens it). Pour in a little olive oil, small amount of sugar, paprika. Stir to dissolve sugar. That’s it. 

Toasted almonds in butter, toasted sesame seeds, softened cranberries, avocado, mango, anything goes.

Only change was paprika...I didn't have any so I used chili powder. It was such a small amount anyway I figured it wouldn't matter. Turned out a bit spicier than the original but was a hit at dinner!

I loved the blend of ingredients, but the dressing was too sweet.  Next time I make this, I will cut the sugar by 1/2.  The only changes I made was that I added sliced mushrooms to the salad and browned the almonds in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds until browned.

I reduced sugar and oil a bit after reading reviews and added salt. Good recipe, will make again. Next time I will toast nuts without butter to be more healthy.

LOVE this dressing- I use a lot less sugar and use olive oil rather than vegetable oil. It hardens when refrigerated, but you can microwave it for a few seconds and its still delish!

I am addicted to this spinach salad!  It's very healthy and tasty.  I don't change a thing in the recipe other than cutting the sugar by half.  You can buy the dried cranberries with 50% less sugar than regular, because they do contain alot of sugar.  I like to keep the toasted almonds in a small container and use them at the time I eat the salad rather than mixing them into the spinach, because they can get a little soggy otherwise.  The dressing is so delicious.  I make it about every other week and sometimes two batches per week.  Soooo good!

This salad has the potential of being really good; however, I should have added the dressing more sparingly because it is much too wet with the full receipe amounts.  Also, I hesitated about adding so much sugar but did anyway..  Hope it would still taste good without 1/2  cup of sugar and it would be healthier.  Makes a pretty salad.

This is a very good salad.  I cut back on the sugar by a couple tablespoons and the oil by a couple as well. The flavor was perfect.  I found that this salad needed a punch of flavor and added a little feta.  With the Feta it became perfect.  That combo of sweet salty and the softness of the cheese with the sweetness of the craisins.

I made this without the nuts because of allergies and without the poppyseeds because they always get stuck in everyone’s teeth and it was delicious!! Thanks for sharing this recipe! It’s a great alternative to your everyday boring salad.

I have made this salad a number of times and everyone always loves it.  Makes a nice salad for Xmas or Thanksgiving or for that matter anytime of year because it is so good. Only suggestion is you don’t need that much dressing.

Very delicious; great flavor combinations. Of course, I varied the recipe somewhat. Used half a bag of spinach to one bunch of romaine for more crunch. Toasted the sesame seeds and wound up skimming as many off the top as I could (didn't care for that flavor - wouldn't use them again).  Added a little Equal to the dressing for more sweetness but kept everything else the same.

Made this salad this past weekend and it was so delicious.  The dressing makes this salad.  The only thing I changed was eliminating the onion in the dressing. Excellent winter salad.

This was amazing and because a reviewer pointed out it was a ton of sugar, I decided to use organic coconut sugar which is similar to brown sugar but has a much lower glycemic level than white sugar so it's much better for you. I cut back a tad on the amount of sugar. This will be an awesome meal for me

The dressing is awful. Too oily and the paprika doesn't go with the sweetness of the salad at all.

Wow! So vinegary! I didn’t catch this as I made it , but usually the ratio in vinaigrettes is 1/3 vinegar to 2/3 oil. This is half and half. I think I will try again and reduce the vinegar. Really wanted to like this.

Very good! I added a large Apple cut in chunks. Without that I’m sure it would not have been as good. Everyone loved it. I had more than half the dressing left over. The greens would have been drowning in it if I’d used it all but nice to have the extra for tomorrow.

This salad is a winner!  I have  made it twice in one week.  Version one used spinach, as called  for, but I substituted roasted pine nuts for the toasted almonds.  Delicious. 

As the dressing was  a hit and there was quite a bit left  over, I  mixed up a bowl of mixed  greens, added craisins  and toasted pine nuts and  served.  Again, a hit and oh so simple. 

I will keep a jar of the dressing in the fridge.

Oh my goodness, this is an excellent salad and so easy to do.  My husband has requested it for his birthday party for 20 people.  No problem, as it is so easy to prep the dressing and add it to the spinach at serving time.

I've made this a couple times now. I like it better with a little less oil and a little less sugar in the dressing..  Mandarin oranges are a delightful addition.

Mehh, it was just okay. Made the recipe exactly as written. I only added a bit of mandarin oranges.  There's just a little summpin summpin missing in this vinaigrette, can't put my finger on it.  I would look to another spinach salad with a better vinaigrette. Surprised at all the compliments for this salad, actually.

The recipe is too sweet as written. I will cut back the sugar by 2 TB when I make it again. Also, I added goat cheese to the salad and served it with grilled chicken. Very yummy.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe. The first time I made it was for a family gathering. Everyone loved it. I made it a second time for a work potluck. Again, it was a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe. The following Monday a co-worker told me she made it for her family over the weekend and her family ate it up! I followed the advice of another reviewer who used Ocean Spray Craisins instead of dried cranberries, because they aren’t as pricey. This is definitely a keeper.

It was good! It was a little sweet though for my family. We also were out of vegetable oil, so we used olive oil, which worked pretty well. Definitely would make again.

dynamite!! this salad was so good but once I started eating it I could not stop. I followed the instructions to the T but layered are salads with some Mandarin oranges. I think the salad would have been perfect without them but I like adding color. the dressing is on point! I tossed only a small little bit at a time so I would not Wilt my spinach. And was able to transport the containers of extras to work to share with my team.

Tastes great skipping the butter and toasting the almonds step, with red wine vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar. Pine nuts are a nice add too.

So good. Left out poppy seeds and added blue cheese crumbles. Made 1/2 the dressing and it was plenty. This would be great with chicken, mandarin oranges, etc. Delish!

It is such a simple recipe but it is awesome. I made it for Christmas dinner following the recipe but did add sliced strawberries also for the Christmas color contrast. I got plenty of compliments on the salad. Definitely a keeper. Thanks so much for a great recipe! :)

The unique combination of sweet and sour in this vinaigrette make this a winner. The people I served this to generally aren't to enthused about salads but someone said it was the best salad he'd ever had. That's really saying something!

This is a really simple, tasty salad!  You can toast almonds without butter if you want, and the dressing definitely doesn't need all the sugar--it can be cut in half easily.

I made it exactly as per instructions and it was amazingly delicious. Roasting the almonds does the trick. Just doubled up on everything because I was serving a large group. Will be making this again.

Very good!  I adjusted the servings to 2 and while I added some additional ingredients to finish up some items from the fridge, I still made the basic salad--just with some extras.  My salad greens were a mixture of spinach and baby greens.  I used a handful of whole, natural almonds, subbed dried cherries for cranberries, a handful of sunflower seeds for the sesame and poppy seeds, and in the dressing , subbed a bit of onion powder for the onion.  To the salad, I added a  chopped nectarine, a thinly sliced radish, some red onion,  1 chopped celery stick,  a few leftover black olives, a small piece of cheese cut up, and a leftover baked chicken thigh cut up with the skin removed.  I sprinkled some seasoning salt on the piece of chicken skin and microwaved it on a paper-lined plate for about 1-1/2 minutes to make chicken cracklins, and then crumbled it into the salad.  It made a great tasting, big salad for lunch.  May reduce the sugar a bit next time.

I've been making this recipe for years. I don't know why I haven't rated it before now. This is a crowd pleaser and is often requested for holidays and group events. The only change I make is to halve the amount of sugar in the dressing.

This was delicious!!! Hubby had 3 servings that night and finished the left overs.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I kept the dressing separate until serving.

I would not change a thing. Have added bacon to it. I love it just the way it is. Serve with shrimp on the side.

I followed the recipe as written, but used less of the sugar, vinegar and oil and still had dressing left over.  This is an easy and delicious salad.

Great recipe. It felt like a lot of work for a salad but in he end, it was well worth it. My salad is as tangy, earthy and had great texture. I added bacon to get a little protein in the salad but otherwise stuck to the directions. I'll do this often for sure.

I have made this salad many of times now and I will admit its one of the best salads out there.   The only thing I do differently is add large black olives and the dressing I poor on top of the salad and mix with my hands then put in the fridge for about 1-2 hours before serving ..   This salad is also great with steamed or grilled salmon on top .     Sometimes I make extra dressing and leave it in the refrigerator for the next time .

This was such a simple recipe to get together, but, was really flavorful!  Make sure you follow the steps to toast the almonds!  They gave the salad a great crunch and flavor.

This salad is very good; however, the dressing is way too sweet for my family. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, but will use even less next time. I roasted the almonds instead of sauteing them in butter, as another reviewer suggested and they were very tasty. I'll definitely put this in the rotation as it's easy and delicious.

I didn't make any  changes to this; I just did not add the almonds as I didn't have any. The dressing was not too sweet and really balanced well with the cranberries. Will certainly make this again!

I made this salad to go along with lasagna for our Father's Day celebration.  It was very well received.  I ended up using red wine vinegar because I didn't have any white wine.  I'm looking forward to trying it with the white.  It wasn't bad, just strong.  Once it mellowed overnight it was wonderful.  For lunch the next day I topped it with salmon.  Sooooo good!

Took a chance on this one, because I happened to have all the ingredients. Well, it was a huge success!  Everyone really liked the unusual flavor of the dressing, and paired with the salad, it was perfect. People even asked to take some of the leftover home with them.  That doesn't usually happen with green salad.  Be sure to make the dressing in enough time for the flavors to develop well.  I noticed when I first made it, it tasted quite vinegary. But after a couple hours, the flavors developed into a great tasting dressing!  I'll make it again, since it is quite easy and delicious.

Turned out very good with few modifications: roasted nuts and sesame seeds in oven as recommended (350 @ 10 min) and added strawberries rather than dried berries.  Also added roasted chicken slices, feta cheese to make it a full meal.  Excellent dressing with 1/2 of sugar

My "go to" recipe when I'm asked to bring a salad! Everybody always raves and asks me for the recipe...super easy to make ahead too! Mix the spinach, dried cranberries and cooled toasted almonds together and place in container. Then mix the dressing ingredients and place in Tupperware and refrigerate until ready to serve!  Easy peasy and didn't change a  thing!

This was a really good salad! I also went with the Craisins and found it as a really good substitute. I limited the oil and vinegar which made me concerned but if you toss the salad enough, it costs everything really well. Oh... I also toasted the almond slivers in the oven, worked out great.

This salad is always a hit! I use just a little less sugar than the recipe calls for (like a very full teaspoon less) not because it tastes bad, but because it's not really noticeable, so why consume more sugar unnecessarily.

I've made this many times and it always gets raves and requests for recipes.  It won't need as much of the dressing as the recipe calls for - just go by your eye - you don't want to soak the spinach.

Great recipe!  Used only half the sugar in the dressing, and added bacon, hard-boiled egg and feta cheese only because it was going to be the main meal of the day.  I actually increased the recipe so that I could make 9 quart-sized salad-in-a-jars.  It was just as good on Friday as it was on Monday.  Thank you Jamie!

Once a month my church has a potluck to I thought I would bring this salad.  Everyone loved it!  The only thing I would suggest is when you make it make sure you have a very large bowl to mix everything.  My bowl was too small so I didn't have enough room for all the spinach, and because of that there was too much dressing.  And don't be afraid to be generous with the cranberries and almonds.  The more the better.

Usually make this for parties and people love it.  If you follow this recipe you will end up with far too much dressing, you can easily cut it in half an have enough. Or keep the extra and just use it for the future.

This was a delicious salad.  My husband raved and raved about it.  Served it with beef tenderloin and baked potato. I did cut the recipe for the dressing in half, and even at that I thought it was a bit too much dressing.  Next time I will cut it by two thirds.

I cut down  sugar to 1/3 cup, but could have cut it down a bit more.  My cranberries were a bit dry so I soaked them in the dressing and liked them better.  There is a lot of dressing so could easily add more spinach.  My family loved it.

I made this salad for Christmas, the green and red colours were very nice.  I made very minor changes.  I replaced some of the white with rice vinegar, sunflower/olive oil instead of canola, reduced the sugar and toasted the almonds in the oven.  I also (on the side) offered blue cheese for those who enjoy it.  Definitely 5 stars!

This was well received for Christmas dinner.  I made two small adjustments:  I added an orange and reduced the amount of sugar in the dressing by 1/4.

This was very good! Will definitely make it again.  I made the dressing a day or two before serving  so the flavors could meld.  I also used canned honey vanilla bourbon pecans instead of the almonds.

This was a hit with all ages groups. I made it twice and the only change I made the second time was decreasing the sugar by half. It was just as big of a hit both ways.

This is one of the most-requested salads i make for family gatherings. I do usually substitute honey for the sugar, and use extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I have swapped out the butter for olive oil, when making it for family that is lactose-intolerant. This is a very pretty salad, too.

Made it exactly as written.  Got rave reviews from a crowd I was nervous about serving it to, since it was for Christmas dinner last year and their tradition was to have an antipasto salad with their meal.  They asked me to make it again this year!

I've been making this salad for several years. It's always a hit at dinner parties. Delicious exactly as written, but you can easily cut the sugar by half without sacrificing the flavour. I dry roast the almonds instead and toast the sesame seeds for added flavour.

Made this for Thanksgiving, the only substitution that I made was the apple cider vinegar.  I used 1/2 apple cider and 1/2 red wine vinegar infused with pomegranate juice, for the apple cider vinegar.  Everyone raved over this recipe and with gluten free/dairy intolerant/other allergies it was a perfect recipe.  Definitely at the top of my list!!!

Super easy and very tasty. The dressing is delicious. Great way to get everyone to eat spinach.

Took to a pot luck an everyone loved it. I will reduce the olive oil next time. There was so much oil left at the bottom of the dish maybe just keep the dressing separate.

I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner we were invited to.  Everyone loved it and a few guests asked for the recipe.  I made it just like it said but I did find I didn't use all the dressing.

This salad dressing was AMAZING. I used half the amount of cider vinegar( I used apple cider with the mother) and half the amount of sugar. It was the perfect amount of vinegar and sweetness for me, anymore sugar and I think it'd be too sweet personally. I didn't do anything to my almonds, just used sliced ones. Seriously the best dressing I've ever had in my life. I even made this for my dad who is NOT a greens or salad eater, and he went back for seconds and said "this now has to be a staple food in our house". Love it!

I made it as is, was  good.
Next time I make it I would add half the sugar, and toast almonds in oven.  
I might put in strawberries instead of cranberries if I have them.
I think sprinkling feta cheece on top would be good also..
I gave it a 4 stars for the recipe as is.

I have made this several times now, each time it seems better than the last! I do not change a thing other than omit the nuts, due to a nut allergy in the family.  Even without the nuts this is  great recipe that everyone enjoys!

I doubled the recipe and took this to a family gathering. Everyone liked this salad and several wanted the recipe. The only negative I would have would be that this salad ended up being costly since I did not have most of the ingredients on hand.

Everyone loved this and asked for the recipe.  The two things that I would do differently next time:  1) There is too much dressing made.  I would probably 1/2 the amount of dressing so it was a little lighter.  2) I would probably add it to each salad separately because the next day it wilts the spinach.  However, it also could have been a result of #1.

Loved it!!!  I will make this again!!!

This was a great salad! Everyone raved over this salad. I added goat cheese, and  instead of almonds as a previous review suggested I used toasted pine-nuts, and added fresh blueberries, tossed it together with a 1/2 spring mix & 1/2 spinach. Delish!:)

I made this exactly as directed.  The dressing was very sweet, and there was a lot of dressing left in the bottom of the bowl when finished.    Next time, I will try using less sugar as well as reduce the overall amount of dressing used with the spinach.

Next time I will make a meal out of it by adding goat cheese.

I cut this down by 1/4 just to see how we liked it. It's delicious!!  I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and cider vinegar. I also omitted the paprika but otherwise made it like the recipe. DELICIOUS!

This is an excellent recipe.  I need to limit sugar intake so I used a product called Swerve in place of the sugar.   I  also sliced and added a couple of  boiled eggs.  I will definitely make this again.

Instead of spinach, I used romaine and celery. Celery gave it a nice crunch. The dressing is a wonderful change. I keep extra dressing in the fridge for fast and easy prep.

If I could give is more stars I would! The flavour is delicious and the dressing keeps in the fridge for future salads. I tend to add chicken pieces and make it a meal. Everyone always raves at potlucks when I bring this salad.

I made this for a pot luck supper  and it was a raving success.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was not to use all of the dressing as I don't like my salads too heavily coated.  I did use up the remainder of the dressing on other salads and it worked great

This was delicious!  You want to end up with 16 oz of cut spinach.  And be sure to watch your almonds.  They burn really easily.

I didn't change much - other than decrease the amount of sugar and grounded the almonds.  Too sweet - is all I have to say.  Not loving this recipe AT ALL!

Huge hit 1st time.  2nd time I made it, used fresh strawberries instead of cranberries & added bacon & red onions- still delicious.

Delicious!! I bake the almonds, cut the sugar in half and don't add the onion (bc people don't always like onion and I'm too lazy to cut up the onion haha!). I also omit the poppy seeds and sesame seeds sometimes and it's still amazing. Way way waaaay too much sugar in the original recipe!

I have to say this is one of the best salad I have ever had, it's fresh, it's full of flavor but not overwhelming. The dressing is good but I would suggest to cut down on the sugar if you don't mind the sourness. But it's a very good salad to serve on its own or as a side to steak, thanks!

This is a very tasty salad!  I gave it 4 stars because of the amount of sugar and fat, but it tastes amazing!  I did make a few tweaks to decrease the sugar and fat.  I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar and you could get away with 1/3 cup oil, maybe a little less.  I added 1 tsp sea salt to the dressing and fresh strawberries to the salad.  I would add some garlic next time.  Enjoy!

This was an outstanding recipe. I made the dressing just as directed. Once it was all assembled it looked a little dull and needed some color. So I added goat cheese crumbles and it was outstanding! You can't go wrong if you make this and take it to a dinner or potluck.

I would have rated this a 5 star if the dressing was not so tangy (too much vinegar).  I made the initial version and found it too vinegary.  I cut back on the vinegar and increased the oil, so my ratio was 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar.  Since the total liquid amount was 1 cup, I used 3/4 c olive oil and 1/8 cup of each of the vinegars listed.  I also cut back on the sugar.  I loved all the other ingredients used, especially the seeds.  Thanks!

I gave it 3 stars because of the dressing. It was too sweet and overwhelming. The cranberries are sweet enough for me. I would make the salad but use a better dressing.

Turned out PERFECT! This was my first attempt at making homemade dressing after reading an article on how unhealthy the store bought ones are. I didn't use poppy seeds, I did use pine nuts and sesame seeds toasted. I put the sesame seeds directly in the dressing. My fiancée absolutely loved it! I will be making again, as per a review I read I did use less sugar and I added minced fresh shallots to the dressing as well. Thanks!

I loved this salad. I did a few things different only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand or I would have made it just like the recipe calls...either way it was awesome. I had extra dressing...it is now my new favorite and I use it on my salad everyday!

At first I was leary about the butter and nuts but did it anyway. RIGHT ON! I used organic spinach and apple cidar vinegar. Cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. It turned out terrific...in fact I'm making it right now ...a second time. Thanks Jamie!

Nice presentation and great texture.  I didn't have toasted sesame seed, so I toasted the raw seed with the almond slivers and omitted from the dressing... I don't think it made a difference.

Oh WOW is this good! I cut the recipe in half (which originally is 8 servings) and my hubby and I devoured every bite (which would have been 2 servings each). This was a hit and craving it still. If you're making a special dinner for friends/family this would be a great compliment to your meal :)

My family always has potluck holiday dinners, and ever since I first made this recipe, they have designated me to be the person who is in charge of bringing the salad, LOL! It's SO GOOD! If you're concerned about it being too sweet, try it with half the sugar at first and then increase as desired.

I make this for potlucks all the time.  I tend to burn the almonds so put them on without heating... no one seems to mind.  I also leave off the sesame seeds and poppy seeds since they're not readily available.  Everyone always has something good to say about the salad!

Instead of the dried minced onion I used 2 Tablespoons of fresh onion minced. This was incredibly delicious, just the dressing by itself. I did other variations on this as well including leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco as well as some Crumbled Bleu Cheese.

Made and took this salad to share with my boyfriend's family.  They loved it.  I didn't have poppy seeds or sesame seeds, so I used a super seed mix from Trader Joe's that I mixed with the almonds.  This was a big hit!

I love this salad and so does my husband! The only things I do differently is that I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I don't add as much sugar (about 75% of the what recipe calls for). So good and so healthy!

Delicious salad!  I did find that these measurements yielded too much dressing.  Could probably cut down by half.  Also, try adding crumbled gorgonzola.  Amazing!!

Awesome recipe!!  Have made this LOTS. The only change I've made was to cut the oil and the sugar to 1/4 cup each.  To the salad I will julienne a red or yellow pepper, add some sunflower seeds, and sometimes I'll section a mandarin orange just to add some colour.  I will also double the recipe and keep remainder of dressing in a mason jar in the fridge.  Will keep for about 3 weeks.  Thank you for sharing!!

I have to admit, I needed a salad to impress.  I believe I found it for our dinner party tomorrow night! I read reviews and did the following: Dressing - 1/4 c. sugar, toasted the sesame seeds; Salad - included blue cheese, toasted pine nuts (instead of almonds) and the Crasins.
Yep, this will impress...

Made this for a graduation party.  Followed the recipe as written but didn't have much flavor - not much was eaten.  May have been better with gorgonzola.

I didn't like the dressing at all, especially the ridiculous amount of sugar. The salad ingredients are good, though, so I'd just keep everything but the dressing. Make a balsamic dressing to put over it instead using 1/4 cup each balsamic vinegar and olive oil, a pinch of salt, and a teaspoon of sugar. The almonds and the sesame seeds are a nice touch.

It's fabulous as written, but I swap out the salad oil for grapeseed oil because it doesn't clot up when chilled.

One of the best recipes for spinach salad. I've used strawberries, raspberries. Think orange slices might be a good addition.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't mix the dressing in with the entire salad, that way we were able to eat the leftovers the next day and everyone could use their own amount of dressing...makes a lot!  Really good, thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! The first time I made this the almonds were the most difficult part...burnt them quickly.  I used peeled sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds, too.   Very easy dressing loved by all ages!

Great salad dressing. I made the dressing the night before so the salad was ready to go Christmas Day, it was a huge success. I would only use a fraction of the sugar next time.

I loved it. Have made variations many times as well with ingredients at hand.  Always add fresh fruit, nuts and some crunch. Pita chips rock because tey stand up to the dressing. I am diabetic so I use 1/3 cup sugar vs 1/2 and same for the oil.  Tastes great.

This salad was delicious. Like other reviewers I reduced the sugar in half. I thought this was more dressing than I needed. Next time I will just toast the almonds in the oven and skip the butter.

Delicious and very easy to put together.  Loved the sesame seeds, they add a great touch.  I also tried it with different variations of infused olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  My favorite so far is orange blossom olive oil with Cara Cara vanilla white vinegar.  Yum

Loved it! I changed up the recipe a bit, by using extra virgin olive oil in replace of vegetable oil, light Agave nectar in replace of sugar, and also an extra 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar which gave the dressing an extra kick.

Awesome salad!  Made it for the first time for Christmas dinner - risky, I know.  But this recipe lived up to the great reviews!  Reviewer "Laurakress" made recommended changes and I followed them to the letter.  All 14 adults devoured this salad, showered me with compliments and asked me repeatedly for the recipe.

I'm all for a spinach salad but this was NOT a hit. The dressing was so sweet! No one finished their portion. I made it exactly as instructed and it was not good. The other ingredients, especially the almonds and cranberries, were great. I'll make it another time without this dressing.

This really was easy and so delicious! Tastes like the fancy salads you order at a restaurant but yet can somehow never achieve the same level of taste at home. Well not anymore! I followed exactly except instead of the minced onion, I just added red onion to the salad itself and I also added good blue cheese crumbles. Will be making this often!

As the recipe is written, I rate this salad 4 stars.  It is a delicious salad, although a bit sweet for my family's tastes, as well as a little heavy on the oil.

The second time I made it, I reduced the sugar by half but still felt it was too sweet.  I also cut the oil in half.  Next time, I will cut the sugar back to 3 Tbsp, as well as further reduce the oil.  With these changes, it should get a 5-star rating in my book.

Jamie, thanks for the recipe!  It's not a combination of ingredients I would have ever thought to use together.

This was a super salad for my luncheon that I had with a few girlfriends.  Everyone loved it, it was fresh and light.  I served it with some warm garlic bread sticks and everyone enjoyed it.  All 4 of my girlfriends wanted the recipe, which I graciously shared with them.  I always have craisins in my house, along with almonds, but never thought to put the two together.  I might try adding some bacon to the salad for a protein, as I think it would be a great fit.  My girlfriend also suggested using the bacon grease in place of the oil for added flavor.  I will definitely try her suggestions, but I do plan to make this salad for Thanksgiving.  I think it will be a great salad that is light and fresh and wont take focus away from the Turkey, stuffing and all the other wonderful dishes.  Great recipe.  It is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty! I made this salad for my brother-in-law's anniversary dinner and they were impressed. They loved everything in it and couldn't get enough of it. I will definitely, keep making this salad. The only thing I would probably reduce, would be the sugar.

I didn't have fresh spinach (although I wished I had) so I used chopped romaine hearts.  It was delicious and the toasted almonds make a big difference.  Thanks Jamie!

Healthy, vegetarian, and delicious... not to mention quick to make.  Half of the dressing ingredients is all that is necessary.

It has many good ingredients within it. I found that the dressing was WAY too tart for my taste.  If I try it again I would make a ginger orange dressing with it.

I took this salad to a pool party and it was gone in minutes. I cut down the sugar and the oil, and upped the seeds. Wonderful and healthy.

I love this recipe! I usually make it when attending parties and potlucks. I really enjoy making my own dressing and feel it compliments the salad well. I do cut back on the sugar a bit as it comes off a bit too sweet for my taste buds and I like adding strawberries and feta cheese to top off.

I substituted honey for sugar, which may be why this earns a 3 star for us.  My husband loved it.  My 2 kids hated it.  I thought it was just ok.

We LOVED this salad!! However ... I only used half of the dressing after I reduced it for only 4 servings. I was able to make another salad for 4 the next day with the other half. It was WAY too much dressing for us. I also added crumbled goat cheese. My husband actually ate it ALL!!!

I've made this salad multiple times since I discovered it a few months ago.  It's a great side salad for potluck dinners or parties because EVERYONE LOVES IT!!  Sesame seeds are expensive though, so I don't always include them- but the other flavors are great and no one ever seems to miss the sesame seeds.  Some comments mention this recipe being time consuming, but it's really not... toasting the almonds takes a few minutes, but other than that it's pretty quick.  And worth it!

This was a fabulous salad.  I made the dressing ahead and took it and the spinach and almonds to the party and assembled it there. Judging by the above reviews I guessed it was going to be a hit so I brought extra.  And yep, I  had to keep refilling the salad bowl because everyone loved it so much.  Light, refreshing and TASTY!  And sooooooo simple!
I, too, cut the sugar down to a couple of tablespoons and pan toasted the nuts with no butter.  But there is a lot of flexibility room here, so you can play with the ingredients.  Nobody's looking. Make it your own.  But just so you know.........its fantastic as is.
Thanks for submitting........its going to the 4th of July party in duplicate!

INCREDIBLE salad, and I didn't even need all that sugar. Sure it's delicious with it, but its also five-star worthy without it. I enjoyed every bite of this for lunch on monday, and proceeded to have it for lunch every day for the rest of the week (and I rarely feel that way about a salad). Thanks for sharing, this was awesome!

Great Recipe.  I make ths for family get togethers and it s always popular.  I substitute bagged honey almonds (found in the produce area of my grocery store) in place of the blanched almonds.   Sometimes add dried blueberries too. I use about half of the salad dressing when serving.

This was pretty good, and the dressing was quite tasty, but based on the reviews, I guess I was expecting something really different from any other spinach salad I'd tried.  It was flavorful, but not the best I've had and not incredibly different.

I brought this to Easter dinner and everyone loved it! The only change I made was, I used about 2 Tbls of Splenda instead of the sugar as we have a diabetic in the family. The salad didn't have time to wilt, it was all gone before anyone even asked for seconds on anything else. Thanks for this one!

This salad was great! Just took a few of the suggestions others posted including cutting the sugar (I used splenda) and oil in half. Also, added crumbled feta cheese. Delicious! This is a keeper.

I've been making this recipe for YEARS and everyone LOVES it. I (like many others) cut the sugar to 1/4 c. and use extra virgin olive oil instead of veg. oil. I also use brown sugar, instead of white - just seems to be a bit more flavorful. My former inlaws would argue over who got any leftover after family dinners. Thank you, Jamie - this one's a winner!

I made this Sunday with a meatloaf and mashed potato meal. Very good! I read a lot of the reviews...mostly too sweet and too tangy. I used half the sugar, rice wine vinegar because it's more mild than apple cidar vinegar, and unsweetened cranberries. I also used olive oil. I minced a half of a small  sweet vidalia onion (Flat, round disk-like onions are the sweetest) MAKE SURE that your olive oil is not rancid or spoiled. This can ruin your recipe. Taste it BEFORE you put it on the salad. I layered the spinach, toasted nuts, cranberries then sprinkled the dressing layering as I went. I found it to be a great way to assemble this beautiful salad. Fresh ingredients assure the best results. Bon Apetite!

This is my go-to salad. However, the sugar in the dressing bothered me, so I replace it with about 1/4 honey (or to taste). I also use organic apple cider vinegar, so it's 100% totally healthy - and delicious!

This was so good   My husband loved it. I had to make  substitution for white wine vinegar as I had none in the house so I used 2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar and 2 Tbsp white vinegar plus1 Tbsp of reduced sodium soya sauce. I cut back on the sugar, only 1/3 c and it was still a bit too sweet for my liking so I would cut back to 1/4 c next time or try some Mirin as it is readily mixable with the other wet ingredients. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Tasty but ridiculously soggy in minutes. Wasn't very popular with my guests. Probably won't make this again unless I alter the recipe dramatically.

I could eat this dressing on anything.  I like to leave the Cranberries in with the dressing overnight to let some of their sweetness seep into the dressing, and then I ease up on the sugar a bit. Delicious.

I made this for a luncheon with co-workers and they loved it.  Instead of toasting the almonds, I just used sliced almonds.  Also, I did not add the sesame or poppy seeds and replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil.  In addition to this, I also replaced the cranberries with sliced strawberries and mandarin oranges; however, the salad would be just as good with cranberries.

Love this salad and dressing.  I got lots of compliments at the party I took this to.  The only change I made was adding feta cheese.

I will surely make this again but keep the changes I made.  I toasted almond slivers and pine nuts.  Added strawberries and a can of mandarin oranges.  To the dressing, I added salt and pepper and substituted honey for sugar and EVOO for veg oil.  We enjoyed this itself for supper and were quite satisfied.

I have never been a big salad eater, but after reading the reviews I figured I would give it a try. I ended up tossing most of it.  I am not sure if having white wine vinegar makes a different, but I did not have it on hand and used regular vinegar instead.  However, the little I did not toss was used to make a sandwich with a little bit of leftover chicken salad and it sort of reminded of I think similar sandwich that Wendy's or Arby's have. In the future I would probably make a small amount of dressing and a small amount of salad for a sandwich, the chicken and bread seemed to get rid of the vinegary taste and made it okay.

I used roasted pumpkins seeds when I saw that I did not have any almonds.  I also used red wine vinegar but this was delicious.  It's a keeper.

Thank you, Jamie!  I prepared this recipe exactly as written, which is my custom for trying a new recipe.  It was divine!  We ate every morsel of this lovely, light salad.  It can stand alone as a luncheon salad served with grilled chicken or beef tenderloin strips.  The dressing is absolutely to die for!

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner where I got stuck bringing the salad. I read all the reviews and decided to make this one. IT WAS A HIT!!!!!! So simple and yet so tasty. I took the advice of cutting the sugar  in half, and I did the almonds in butter but let them sit on a paper towel to soak up the extra. I was told by everyone that it was the best salad they ever had!

This salad was great!!!  I made yesterday for New Year's Day and everyone loved it. I did cut the sugar a bit to 1/3 cup and used red wine vinegar only because that is what i had on hand. The rest as i left as recipe called. If love spinach, you will love this. This is a keeper.

A friend served this at Xmas dinner. It is absolutely fantastic. I had second and third helpings of it. She told me "it's the top rated salad on allrecipes.com" so I knew it would be easy to find. I can't believe I forgot to buy spinach at the store! Will have to pick some up ASAP. So very good. Definitely try this salad!

I thought, how can people rave over a salad recipe? Then I made it and people asked me for the recipe... I am not a big salad eater but have to admit, it was pretty darn good. I couldn't find any poppy seeds so used sunflower seeds instead. Thanks,

Way too sweet for my taste. Definitely cut down the sugar like the other reviews say. I also think just roasting the almonds with Pam would make them less greasy and save on calories.

This is a great recipe! The dressing is very complimentary - don't mess with it too much. I tried getting lazy and purchasing a bottled dressing but it really wasn't the same. I've added sandwich turkey to this before and it's okay but breaded chicken strips are an even better addition if you're a meat lover!

I have made this a couple of times for special occasions and absolutely loved it.  I agree with other reviews that suggest cutting back on the amount of sugar.  I like to use fresh pomegranate seeds sometimes instead of dried cranberries.

Very tasty! I followed the recipe with only one minor modification, I toasted the almonds in the oven. This recipe makes too much for our small family, so I put the dressing in a shaker bottle and individual portioned it out. I ate it again for lunch the next day and made it a meal by adding some fresh blueberries, blackberries and clementine oranges. So yummy!

This is a great recipe.  I use the dressing with romaine and other lettuces as well.  I generally increase the vinegar a little bit to give the dressing more bite and add blue cheese to add another flavor, but this recipe is good as is.  Yum.  Thank you for sharing.

This salad was pretty good. I was expecting to be in awe struck by it from the ratings of it, being the number one salad on allrecipes and I really wasn't. However, I think it was pretty decent and I will make it again.

I did this as directed the first time, which was great.  Next time, I made it for a large amount of people for a charity event.  In this case, Costco was a huge help.  (To avoid spending a lot of time and $200 to make a salad.)  They had washed spinach, real crumbled bacon and a mixed fruit, seed and nut product without any additives.  Huge savings in time and money.  Big hit.

I enjoyed this but like others I thought the dressing was too sweet and there was too much of it. Next time I would cut the dressing in half and use only half the sugar. Still, it was enjoyed by my Thanksgiving crowd and the red and green colors were festive for the holidays. I added some pomegranate seeds and red onion and they really made the colors pop. I also added sugar coated pecans instead of the almonds, and tossed in some feta, which was a nice salty balance to the sweet dressing.

Even after cutting the sugar in half, this was WAY too sweet.  I didn't like it, but I'm giving it four stars due to the number of compliments I received on it.  Once I got home with the leftovers, I put feta cheese in it, which cut the sweetness and added a bit of sour/tart taste to it.  Much better with it!  I would have liked to put in goat cheese like others suggested, but didn't have any.  So, if you are concerned about the sweet, add in some feta or goat cheese!  It makes a huge difference!

I made this last night for our Canadian Thangsgiving dinner and it was a huge hit! I even sent some family members home with some of the leftover dressing @ their request. The only thing I did different was I switched the almonds for walnuts but still followed the carmelizing effect. I think next time I would use less of the sugar as I found with the cranberries it was already sweet. We had all ages from 7 to 91 and everyone said how great it was!

Good - your basic bistro spinach salad. I used dried cherries instead of cranberries (had one, not the other) and skipped the onion because I'm lazy. I also used half the sugar in the dressing and half the oil; the dressing is nice, tangy with a tiny little bite at the end from the paprika. Can't imagine it with the full amount of sugar, though. I also only used 6 ounces of spinach (so slightly less than half called for) and used far less than half the dressing. So four stars because I can't imagine all that sugar in the dressing, and I also can't imagine using all that dressing - plus some, with the extra oil and sugar! - on a salad.

Tried this with pecans toasted with butter and a little brown sugar. Unbelievable! 

Very tasty! Used salted/roasted almonds instead. Keep an eye on the spinach to dressing ratios. Made way too much dressing for the amount of spinach I had.

The best dressing ever!  I have had so many people as me for this recipe.  It is easy to make, sometime I don't roast the almonds when I'm in a rush to work.  I make the dressing for 8 and keep it for the week.

This got rave reviews at the family event I brought it to. And i come from a family that usually only likes one kind of salad dressing. I left out the poppy seeds and replaced the almonds with pecans. We'll make this again and probably use the dressing for lots of other salads as well.

AMAZING. I cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup but might use even less next time. I didn't use sesame seeds and I didn't toast the almonds...still amazing.

I have made this but as a mix between another salad recipe which calls for candied nuts. I enjoyed the dressing here with the paprika, extra kick! However I wouldn't put poppy seeds or minced onion due to personal taste. The cranberries add colour and sweetness. Next time I will try it with the blanched almonds instead of candied nuts.

loved this.  The dressing was great.  I mixed every thing together too early and the spinach was a little limp.  Next time I will put the salad together right before I serve it.  It all disappeared.

Loved this salad, and so did my guests and husband! Only changes: I toasted the almonds and sesame seeds on a baking pan in the oven and skipped using butter. I also added mandarin oranges.

Quite simply, one of the most delicious and easiest salads!  The only thing I do differently is substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Sometimes I substitute strawberries for the cranberries depending on my guest(s)... either one is absolutely scrumptious!

Excellent recipe.  The dressing is very flavourful and the salad itself doesn't only taste amazing but looks pretty as well.  I've been making it for the last 6 months on a very regular basis and have had so many people ask for the recipe.  I usually make quite a bit of dressing - it keeps well in the fridge for a long time.  My favorite!!

This salad is SO easy to make and SO good. It's one of those salads that impresses everyone and makes them wonder how you made it and what you put in it. I make it all the time now with either spinach or mixed greens. Fabulous!!

Loved it!! A little to much sauce though, so would suggest adding little by little.

As some of the other reviewers sugested, I used 1/4 sugar and toasted the almonds, sesame and poppy seeds in the oven on 350 for about 10 minutes, then mixed them into the dressing.   Very tasty!  Paired this with the onion soup for a nice winter meal!  Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I was able to make it with my 9 year old neice who loves any chance to get in the kitchen with me and "cook". I do think, however, it was a little too sweet. Almost like a dessert. Everything else was delicious but I think next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar a bit.

really great salad. As previous posters stated you don't really need butter (  almonds and sesame seeds can be toasted without it) also I found that you can cut on sugar as well. I had to improvise somewhat since i didn't have  all the right ingredients but it was still delish!!!  I also added some tomatoes, i think you can add cucumbers and bell pepper as well.

I've now made this recipe several times - always leaving out the sugar.  I have also made it with and without the poppy seed and/or sesame seed and it makes little difference.  It is a great recipe that I will make again and again.

This salad is awesome.  Only thing I did different was add feta cheese.  Toasted the almonds in the oven instead as well (becareful not to burn them, it smells awful!).

This is my first time ever reviewing a recipe and I have been using this site for years but this salad was so delicious I had to rate it.  I added the Gorgonzola cheese as I had seen mentioned in an earlier comment but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was THE most delicious salad I have EVER eaten - thank you Jamie.  Oh, and everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner said it was the best too.  I felt like it really added a special touch to our special meal.

This is a wonderful refreshing salad. I followed the other suggestions: substituted Craisins for the cranberries and I toasted the seasame seeds and almonds for about 10 minutes at 350. I omittted the poppy seeds altogether, not sure if it would add any extra taste or not. The seasame seeds did add a good touch so I suggest not to omit them.

Delicious salad! I usually don't like fruit/nuts in my salad, but made this for a party, and decided to try it because everyone was raving about it... wow, yum! There was a tiny bit left over, which I ended up eating the next day, wilted leaves and all. It was that good!

I have been on this site for years and have seen this recipe but have never made it.  Tonight I made an altered version of it, and it was very good.  My husband and I cannot eat seeds of any kind, so I eliminated the poppy and sesame seeds.  I also did not have minced onion - dried or fresh. I basically used the vinegars, sugar and oil in the proportion suggested, and it was light and enjoyable.  Thanks!

Very good salad.  I love the combination of the toasted sesame seeds and the toasted almonds.  I also added some gargonzola cheese. It really bumps up the flavor.  Dressing is a great combination of sweet and sour.

This is a great salad!  I made two changes - I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I cut the amount of sugar in half.  1/4 cup of sugar is plenty.  Be sure to toast the almonds and sesame seeds - it's wonderful!

Toooooooo sugary!! I toasted the almonds in the oven for a few minutes, that worked great. The amount of sugar needs to be cut down big time in my opinion. Otherwise, really good and refreshing salad.

This was a good recipe, though I feel like I've eaten it before. The poppy seeds added a strange crunch, and the balsamic did not taste good with the spinach. It tasted sort of bitter. Instead, I used olive and regular vinegar. Another thing I didn't love about this was using only spinach. Instead, I used mixed baby greens, with spinach added. It gives a nice balance. Generally, though, this is really tasty. I also tried replaces the almonds with walnuts, and it worked great.

Wonderful salad!  The dressing is amazing.  Try toasting the almonds in the oven instead of using all that butter.

Loved this recipe and I have added it to my recipe box already!  I have made a few changes, but only because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I substituted red wine vinegar instead of the white and reduced the amount of sugar.  Thanks for an 'all-season' salad!

Good salad but too oily for my taste. It's bad especially if you want to save them for the next day because the spinach becomes very soggy/wilted. I will also cut the sugar a bit and add in Gorgonzola cheese and try toasting the almonds instead.

This was a good salad, I didn't have cranberries so I put fresh strawberries and it was very tasty. I also agree with many users, that the dressing is a bit on the sweet side. I ended up using only 1/4 cup of sugar it it was sweet enough for us. The toasted almonds were a really good touch. Will definetly make again.

I like the idea of the salad. However, the dressing was too sweet, or too something. the dressing simply overpowered this salad. If you do make this salad, lightly drizzle on the dressing. You can always add more.

Now I'm going to sound just like my mother..."This is a salad recipe that men will eat!"  Seriously, I've never served this to anyone who didn't love it.  I've served it for years!  I don't add the seeds or toast the almonds anymore...too lazy.  But it's still delicious.

I made this  to take to a dinner party. I halved the oil and it was still a sopping mess in the over a pound of spinach I tossed it in. I had to take paper towels and try to leach off some of the oil, and then put it in a strainer to attempt to further reduce the oil. I could not take it to the party.

This is a must try! I did do a couple of things differenty. When mixing up the dressing ahead of time I grated the onion for a smoother texture, and cut the oil in half. I then added the cranberries and let marinate for about an hour wisking a few times. Lastly, when tossing the salad; I added crumbled reduced fat feta. I loved this salad so much I might have it again tonight!

One of the best recipes on the site, imho. I served this for 2 different Thanksgiving dinners, and everyone loved it. Even people who didn't like spinach couldn't stop complimenting and asked for the recipe.

Love the recipe, found it in the Costco cookbook only difference is that they call for 4oz. Feta Cheese crumbled...I've made it hundreds of times; it's calories but no one seemes to mind.

This salad was the hit of our office luncheon.  There was none left and everbody wanted the recipe.  Can't wait to make it again.  Only change I made was to add some gorgonzola cheese which was perfect with the sweetness of the dressing.  Terrific, thanks for such a wonderful (and simple) recipe!

Very quick and easy.  Burned my almonds trying to sautee them (should have toasted them like other reviewers advised) and used Paul Newmans Rasberry Vingaigrette and was great!!!

Yum - such an easy delicious salad.  I made this for an Inaguration party and it was definitely a hit.  My adjustments - I used Craisins and toasted Macadamia nuts (my nod to Hawaii) in addition to the sliced almonds and sesame seeds.  To travel to the party, I kept the craisins/nuts in one container, and the dressing in another, and then dumped them all together with the baby spinach moments before serving.  I would recommend eating this within a day - otherwise the dressing settles and the lettuce becomes a bit drowned.  However - this was such a yummy dish that you may not need to worry about leftovers!

Very good. We cut the sugar and veg oil in half and used olive oil instead. Also threw in some avocado. Next time may try to cut the vinegar as it is a strong taste for my wife.

I just brought this salad to Thanksgiving and everyone really liked it - even the people who don't like spinach.  The only changes I made were to toast the dry sliced almonds at 350 degrees in the oven for 10 minutes and I added a 1/2 cup of gorgonzola cheese.  Several reviewers said that the dressing was too sweet, but my family thought it was perfect.  Guess it just depends on what youre looking for.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good and very easy.  Don't skip toasting the almonds!  I prepared the spinach in a large covered bowl, mixed the almonds and cranberries in another container and had the dressing a in jar with lid to shake up so I could take it to a pot luck.  Worked out beautifully and had many requests for the recipe.

Delicious! Love the red and green colors, however, it was a little sweet, and almonds felt greasy. Will roast nuts next time in oven and skip butter, and also cut sugar to half.

This was really good.  I was looking for a recipe to use up a pomegranate.  I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand.  I used shallots in place of onions in the viniagrette.  I cooked pecans in sugar and let them cool, chopped them and used in place of almonds.  I used granny smith apples for crunch and half of a pomegranate...squeezing the juice over the salad and picking out the fruit.  Instead of spinach, I used romaine.  I had some gorgonzola cheese crumbles to throw in, but they had spoiled, so I omitted cheese altogether.  My husband swears by ranch and he really like this salad.

This is good.  I have made this recipe just like it's written. GOOD! I have also done it to my taste ~ dressing ~ which is no poppy seeds. I have changed it up and added berries instead of craisins.  I LOVE it with raspberries. Then add gorgonzola cheese crumbles.

What a good salad!  Made just like the recipe except I tasted dressing as I went and did stop the sugar at 1/4 c.  Finished up the leftover for next day lunch sticking in cold cooked broccoli and that was quite tasty.  Thanks

This was tasty although I feel like most people like it because it's so sweet! a salad should not be THAT sweet! half the sugar in the dressing and it is just right.

I also added crumbled bleu cheese, sliced red onion, and cherry tomatoes. The homemade dressing and salad was a hit with my dinner party friends. They asked for seconds AND the recipe.

An amazing salad. I followed the recipe exactly except that I did 1/2 spinach and 1/2 romaine because we like a little extra texture and the different shades of green made it appealing to the eye. Will be making this again and again.

This is my favorite salad recipe from this site so far!!  I substitute 1/4 C. of splenda for the sugar and it comes out delicious!  I actually double the recipe for the dressing sometimes and keep it on hand for all my lettuce salads!  Adding grilled chicken makes this a great meal in itself!

Add me to the list of lovers of this recipe!!

 I followed the recipe pretty close. I used pecans instead of almonds and glazed them with
butter and maple syrup instead of just butter. I also used a quarter cup of sugar instead of the recommned 1/2 cup. Still a tad sweet for us so the next night I added 1 tablespoon less sugar and added some strawberries. Wow, we love it! A new favorite in our family. 
I should also add that when my husband saw the spinach salad he curled his nose up at it, but everyone was raving so he decided to try. We have a new spinach convert, THANK - YOU!!

This goes without saying, but this was AWESOME.  My 13 yr old and 3 yr old ate it.  I will make again and again.  Followed the recipe exactly.  You can throw in whatever your family likes really.  Next time I'll take others advice and add mandarin oranges and gorganzola.  YOU CAN'T MISS WITH THIS ONE!

Just wanted to agree!  Did as many suggested and toasted almond slivers, and also halved sugar suggested.  It was truly amazing for such a seemingly simple salad.  I'll have it again for certain!!

Absolutely Great!  The only thing I did a little different was to sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of sugar over the almond slivers to caramelize them a little while toasting.  The salad is fabulous.

WOW!  My friend sent this to me months ago, and I'm kicking myself that I just made it.  I tried it this weekend, and made it again today for a girlfriend's lunch at my house.  I added grilled chicken pieces and crumbled goat cheese. Though in the past I have had problems with spinach salads wilting, this one is better after sitting with dressing mixed in for at least 30 minutes - 1 hour.  I served it with "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" on this website that I made into mini loaves.  It was the perfect, easy lunch with dessert included!

Really good.  I didn't use poppy seeds in this particular recipe, I don't think it would be a good fit. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was enjoyed by all.  Very nice addition to Easter dinner.  Thank you, will make this again.

This was a delicious and light spinach salad.  It did make more than enough dressing  but that just leaves some left over for later.  I also thought it could use a little less sugar.

One of the best salads of this type that I've had. I served it the first time at Thanksgiving 2007 and loved it so much we've had it three more times since then! I recently paired this salad with the Poppy Seed Poultry Casserole from this website along with rolls on the side. Two days later, one of my guests called me begging for the recipe. She hadn't been able to stop thinking about it!

This salad was elegant and delicious. But I think next time i will reduce the sugar to 1/4cup. The dressing tastes better when left a little, or the next day.

We thought this was quite good (although I didn't LOVE it). There was a bit too much sugar in the dressing, but the seeds and nuts toned that down nicely. I used a mix of pine nuts and almonds (that is what I had on hand) and they were really yummy. Thanks!

I made this tonigh for a family get together.  We thought it was delicious.  I used mandarin oranges and left off the sesame seeds and still found it to be a very tasty and easy salad to prepare.  I served it as a side for turkey pot pie.

I didn't actually eat this, because it's not my type of salad, but it got rave reviews from the family.  The only modification I made was to cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, as recommended by some of the reviewers.

I used half the sugar, and added mushrooms!  Terrific recipe, so glad I tried it.  Next time, I will toast the almonds without the butter, it wasn't necessary at all.
Thank you again Jamie!

Count me among the fans.  Used cranberries and mandarin oranges, half the sugar and I used rice-wine vinegar (because that is what I had on hand).  Very easy and looks lovely.

At first everyone turned up their noses at the thought of a spinach salad, but after their first tastes, they were asking for seconds!  Great salad, I added blue cheese and craisens.  I might leave out the seaseme seeds next time, but for sure, I will make this again!

I started with a "Baked Slow Cooker Chicken" done the day before.  I added the cooked shredded chicken and a crumbled wedge of blue cheese to this spinach salad.  I also substituted toasted pecans for the almonds sauteed in butter.  It made a great main dish salad for a holiday luncheon!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds (toasted at 350 for 10 minutes) and I also had blue cheese crumbles and goat cheese on the side.  Delicious!  There was about double the dressing needed, but I left it on the side for those who like the dressing a little heavier on their salads.  Everyone loved it!!!  Will make this over and over again.

This was an awesome salad.  I was really surprised how good the dressing was, an excellent combination of flavours.  Try throwing in some cubed cold chicken or turkey breast, yummy.

The dressing kind of had a bitter taste to it. and There was wayyy to much oil added. would lesson it to a third of a cup of oil next time.

FREAKIN AWESOME!  I actually was craving this salad a few days later.  It's really easy to make and even easier to keep items on hand to whip it up.  We keep the dressing in the fridge for all salads.  I did cut way back on the sugar and I toasted the sesame seeds in a frying pan as suggested.  Also, I used dried sweetened cranberries from the store - I think I'm going to start making those on my own just so I can have this more often.

This is good, no doubt, but its not outrageous. I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and butter. Ive also made it a few times, each time adding and omitting certain ingredients. Once I used golden raisins instead of cranberries, very good. I also added mandarin oranges too. All in all, a good refreshing salad and easy to make.

used oven toasted almonds (no butter), baby spinach....otherwise followed the recipe.  what else can anyone say when a recipe is perfect?  Does seem too sweet at the outset but once the flavors meld it really doesn't seem to be.

This salad rules!  I make it every year for Thanksgiving dinner and my guests always rave more about the salad than the turkey!
The only thing I do differently is cut the sugar to 1 tablespoon.

This recipe was very good.  The only changes I made was to toast the almonds and sesame seeds in the oven at 400 degrees.  They toast fast, so watch them closely.  I also topped it with crumbled blue cheese.  I will definitely make again, my husband and I both liked it.

I have friends that are amazing at making salads but never have been able to match up. This recipie has certainly matched up to the complexity of a great salad. This has always been a favorite. Great for lunch and dinner. Highly recommended.

I would give this 4 and 1/2 if I could. 80% of my guests just loved this at Thanksgiving dinner. The other 20% might just be lacking taste buds! Very light and freshing salad... Thanks!

This is absolutely MUST try salad. It's so yummylicious that I get my picky bf to eat it. He doesn't like the vinegar and raw spinach but after trying, he practically snatch the bowl of salad from me. 
Only one thing, I would omit the sugar next time. This is quite a volatile recipe. You can add/omit some ingredients.

I make this salad often for potlucks, holidays, etc.  Everyone loves it, and many have asked for the recipe.  I generally follow the recipe except I toast the sesame seeds w/o butter.  I use craisins. Sometimes I'll cut back on the onions or use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  The leftovers are tasty too!

This is honestly the best salad I've ever had. Makes a LOT of dressing. You really only need half that. Doesn't work well for leftovers but you might want to set some aside WITHOUT the dressing and add it later. That should work perfectly. Love it!

My family has asked for this salad over and over! They just can't seem to get enough of it! It's a really inexpensive salad to make...I just used sesame seeds instead of sesame and poppy seeds to cut down the cost. This salad is a winner!

This one is great!  To cut down on fat and sugar, I dry toast the almonds in the oven and use 1/4 cup of Splenda instead of sugar.  I also prefer dried cherries instead of cranberries.  The recipe makes more dressing than I use, so I use the extra throughout the week on my lunch salads.  With sliced grilled chicken breast on top, this is a super meal!

Out of this world. Totally wonderful. The recipe made enough dressing I used it the next night on regular salad greens and it was equally wonderful.I did however toast the almonds and sesame seeds at 350 for 10 minutes and eliminated the poppy seeds. Thanks, Jamie

Excellent salad. I have made this other very similiar salad for a few years using straberries instead of cranberries. Good either way. Never have much left. Toasting the almonds is very good. Don't leave that part out. I also toasted the sesame seeds (it calls for it but doesn't tell you to do it). Great salad, if you are looking for a "magazine" type salad to impress, use this one.

This salad is awesome! 5 stars for sure! I went with someone's suggestion of just using Paul Newman's balsamic vinagrette for the dressing to save time and craisins and it was absolutely delicious. My husband and sister-in-law loved it as well. I will make this all the time now. I really liked the sesame seeds. I didn't use the poppy seeds and next time I will add mandarin orange slices.

This salad was wonderful!  I made it for Easter dinner for 15 people and everyone enjoyed it even the picky eaters!  I made the dressing ahead and then put it together at the last minute.

Wow. I must say that I didn't expect to like this all that much, but it is really fabulous! I did just use a bag of baby spinach leaves to make things easier, and doubled the recipe, as I used it at a dinner series I'm catering, but other than that followed the recipe as written. I don't know why I'm not more adventurous on my own. I would never make a salad with nuts or berries in it at home because it doesn't sound great to me, but I did make this thinking others would enjoy it and I fell in love with it too! The dressing was pretty sweet, and I mentioned cutting down on the sugar next time to one of the guests, but he thought it was great. So I'll probably just leave it as is. I'm so glad I tried this!!!

This salad is the BEST! It is my go-to recipe for pot-lucks and as a side dish for special dinners. Or really anytime! I make it exactly as called for, but usually halve the recipe. Thanks Jamie!

This recipe was great!  It is simple to make and doesn't call for a lot of expensive ingredients, but tastes divine.  I made it for a dinner party and it was perfect.

Everyone, even my Dad, who really never, ever likes salad, ate this with glee!  I used normal spinach (not baby) and used about two 10 oz bags and it was enough for 10 people at Thanksgiving this year.  (I also altered the dressing recipe for 10 instead of 8.)  You can toast the sesame seeds and almonds in advance to make this a quick recipe!

I made this recipe for about 35 guests at my son's baptism, and nearly everyone raved about it.  I had many requests for the recipe.  It was so easy to make, and we had NO leftovers even though I made 4 pounds of spinach! My family asked me to make this salad again this weekend!

I left out the onion - personal preference.  Cut back on the vinegar just a touch.  Loved it with pecans instead of almonds.  Great recipe - definitely a keeper.

This was good and so easy. I usually like a little more in my salad though so I add more fruit and veggies. My husband thought the dressing was too onion-y. But he doesn't like onions. I'd probably leave them out next time.

This salad is out of this world! I wasn't able to find the poppy seeds and sesame seeds, so I used toasted sunflower seeds.  I also topped off the salad with a little goat cheese, which I really liked.  My husband, on the other hand, almost gagged on the goat cheese, but he did like the rest of the salad after he picked it off.  It's just personal preference.  I'm already looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers!

This salad..ESPECIALLY the dressing turned out better than I anticipated! Aside from the toasted almonds and dried cranberries..I also sprinkled crumbled gorgonzola chesse on top which really added alot of flavor. Boyfriend and roomate were highly impressed comparing the salad to something resaurant quality. Can't wait to make it again!!!!

I made this today for a potluck and got rave reviews! Quite a few have asked for the recipe. I made minor changes, but not many! I used (2) 9 oz. bags of ready to go baby spinach, red wine vinegar, and 1/4c light olive oil, and 1/4c vegetable oil, & about 1/8th t. salt to taste. I made the dressing ahead of time for the flavors to blend. YUMMY! Thanks Jamie!

This was a great tasting and very pretty salad.  I don't usually care for spinach salads but I thought this was very good.  I took it to a party and was asked for the recipe repeatedly.  This would be a great Christmas salad!

Awesome recipe!!  It's become a staple at my family holidays ... even my husband's family loves it.  I love that it only takes a few minutes to put together.  I always add blue cheese or gorgonzola for a bit more texture.  I also like to make the dressing with white vinegar and red wine vinegar.  It gives it a pink color that really adds to the presentation of the dish.

Excellent!  The dressing was incredible.  Just like the restaurant version I had been trying to mimic, but better!  My husband, who isn't a big fan of spinach, ate the whole bowl and asked for seconds.

I made this for a family dinner. Everybody liked it, but no big raves.   It was a nice blend of flavors.  We topped it with feta cheese which added a complementary flavor.

This is the best recipe.  My whole (extended) family loves it and expects it every Christmas (red and green).  Thank you Jamie for this recipe, I use toasted pinenuts instead of almonds but thats just a personal choice, either works wonderful.  Other than that, I do not change it in any way.  Perfect salad!  Yum!

My husband didnt like this salad. Im starting to think he just doesnt like oil/vinegar dressing - plus he doesnt like nuts so I wasnt able to use those so the salad had no texture. But I gave it 4 stars cuz I liked it and Im sure with the other ingredients I wasnt able to use, Im sure it wouldve been wonderful. Thanks!

My guests (there were 9 of them) all told me this was one of the best salads they had ever eaten.  It was simple and absolutely crisp and delicious.  The only slight change I made was to add a tsp of sugar to the toasting phase for the almonds - the nuts were then salty sweet and it really brought out the flavor.  It also looks beautiful when done. Fantastic!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I could not find white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar, and it came out great.  The toasted the sesame seeds made the dressing delicious.  Used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Will definitely make this again!

I was hesitant about this recipe because I do not like cranberries, however they taste great in this salad! I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I used 2 six ounce bags of baby spinach leaves and used 1/3 cup of olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I may use just a little less sugar  next time.

This is the only salad that I CRAVE. It is so good!  Follow the suggestions and use half the sugar (add some Splenda if you like) and half the oil. THe poppy seeds aren't necessary, they don't really add anything to it. But be sure to toast your sesame seeds to really bring out their flavor. I made it for a party tonight and everyone asked for the recipe.

Delicious!  I cut the sugar in half, and increased the minced fresh onion to 3 tsp.  I made this for a dinner party.  It was very good, and I received rave reviews -- especially from the women! It's a very attractive salad.

I thought this was okay, didn't see what all the rave was about.  I served this at our new years party and everyone thought it was average, although I did have one guest who loved it.  Pretty salad though.  I only omitted the poppy seeds since I had none, doubt that would've made a difference.

Absolutely delicious salad! I've made it a couple times for parties and everyone wants the recipe. I agree with the previous reviewers that said it makes a lot of dressing. The last time I used 1 1/2 pounds of the spinach and still had more than enough dressing. Perfect color combination for the holidays!

I made this for a potluck dinner.  It was super easy, and turned out perfect.  As other reviewers have suggested, I halved the sugar and oil, and substituted olive oil for vegetable oil.  Don't forget at least a few pinches of salt and pepper!

I would emulsify the oil when making the dressing so it doesn't separate.  Also added Feta Cheese.  VERY GOOD!

This was outstanding. The only thing I might change next time I make it is to add less sugar. The dressing was a bit too sweet. Otherwise, this is a terrific recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I have made this salad so many times now and each time I make it, it is the topic of conversation for half of dinner. Superb! Make sure you dont dress it until just before you're ready to eat it--it wilts very quickly and must be eaten the same day it is prepared (don't worry you won't have any left over!)

I have made this recipe quite often.  People now ask me if I can bring the salad to parties because they like it so much.  My best friend said she doesn't like spinach and she even raved about the salad.

I love this salad!  Great mixture of healthy ingredients.  Plus, it's so easy to throw together.  I always keep toasted almonds and dried cranberries on hand now.  You can toss up a quick lunch-for-one or a large dinner salad in a snap!

Mix with some spring mix or romaine and it helps increase the crunch.  I have received more requests for the recipe for this salad than anything I make.
Wonderful salad.

We do a potluck luncheon once a month at my work and I have never received so much postive feedback on a recipe as I did when I brought in this salad last week! I tripled the recipe and the whole thing was gone in 30 minutes. This recipe is awesome! The dressing is sweet and delicious.

I loved this recipie! The only thing I did was to keep the dressing and salad seperate and chilled. On the other hand my sister prefers to have the salad cold and dressing hot, so both are good options. I also added feta cheese crumbles. This made the recipie heavanly and added the nessicary flavor balance. Great Recipie!! Try it you will love it!

Not as good as the strawberry spinach salad on this site.  Dressing was a little too vinegary.  I used Craisins and that was very good.

The toasted almonds were the key!  So good!  The salad was sweet, although not overpowering.  The dressing makes quite a bit so it can be used numerous times.

This salad was very good. I left out the almonds, my husband is allergic.  I mixed the dressing in the individual salad bowls because I had leftovers and didn't want the spinach soggy for the next day.  I will use the recipe again.  Excellent!

This salad was sooooo good!  I brought it to a pool party last night, and it was gone in no time! Many people asked about the recipe.  It is my new favourite salad!  I'll be making it again today since I only had a small serving last night.  I followed the recipe exactly and I think I will cut back on the sugar today since it is very sweet, but still very, very yummy!!   Thanks Jamie!

This salad gets raves everytime I serve it. To save time, I mix the dressing ingred. the night before a party, toast the nuts in the microwave and reserve for the next day.    I half the sugar as suggested (too sweet otherwise) and add halfed cherry tomatoes and feta cheese.  I use raspberry vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  I toss everything together at the last minute.  Presto, instant addition to any party! This salad is a soggy mess the next day, so leftovers are not recommended.  Mix only as much as you will eat in any given dinner.  It looks and tastes fancy smancy but no one needs to know just how simple it is!  All Recipes Rocks!

This salad was great!  My seven-year-old who doesn't like salad raved about it.  I used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds and toasted them with the almonds.  That's what I had on hand and it just added to the nice crunch.

Wonderful!!  Even if you don't like spinach, I guarantee you will love this.  Made it for a large group of people (triple batch) and they all raved about it.  I didn't change a thing.  Be careful not to make up too far ahead of time and the spinach will wilt.

My friend brought this to a cook-out, and everyone wanted to know who made it. It was so tasty and a great mix of color and texture!

I am owner of a Diner in Moline, Kansas.  I tried this recipe on Valentines Day, along with Prime Rib.  So many of our customers raved about it and requested that we serve it more often, which we now are doing.  It is wonderful!

I made this recipe for my husband and parents and did not change a thing. It is one of my favorite salads and is so light tasting it will be perfect for hot summer days. I try to keep all ingredients on hand at all times for the surprise dinner guests.

I made this salad the first time a few years ago for our street golf party. It received raves and has been a favorite ever since. I always serve it at mothers day brunch because it goes really well with egg dishes. I often omit the almonds when my neice is there since she is alergic to nuts but it is still fantastic!

My mom made this for our Christmas Eve dinner and it was delicious. Quite pretty, too. Make sure you mix it well just before serving so the cranberries and almonds don't get left in the bottom of the bowl.

Great and refreshing.  Similiar to a strawberry spinach salad that I make.  I used distilled vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and used chopped walnuts instead of almonds.

This was an excellent salad.  Next time I am going saute the almonds in sugar instead of the butter for extra crunch and taste.  I will definately make again.  Thank you for the recipe.

It really is as good as every one says.  I could eat the whole batch and I don't even like salad.  I didn't have the sesame seeds and it was still delicious.

A truly wonderful spinach salad!
I have made this several times and the only changes I have made was omitting the sesame seeds and adding some goat cheese. This is a big hit with all my guests!
