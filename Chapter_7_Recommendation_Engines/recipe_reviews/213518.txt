This recipe is a great recipe, I make  this stuffing every thanksgiving.  I tripple the recipe because I have a large family, I did make a few changes.  Instead of white onion I used green onion and I also added dried cranberries. Happy Thanksgiving!!

I followed the recipe with a few changes. I used two boxes of Stove Top and instead of 3 cups of water, i used chicken broth and turkey drippings. I followed the recipe with the onions, celery, apple, raisins, and cinnamon. I tried this for the 1st time today (on Thanksgiving) and it was a Hit!
