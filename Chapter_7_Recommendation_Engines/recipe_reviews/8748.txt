I love this recipe.  It was really easy and very unique.  One of my kids was not sure he liked it but the other two loved it!  I served it with mashed potatoes and corn.  I had leftover chicken and potatoes, so I cut up the chicken and put it in a casserole dish with a can of mushroom soup, layered green beans (drained, canned) over the chicken and topped it with mashed potatoes then froze it for a future meal.  The casserole w/ the leftover chicken was wonderful too!

First, if you are going to do this, use a decent beer. A macrobrew (Miller, Bud, etc) isn't the best choice for, well, much of anything. :)

I also skipped the broiling of the chicken.

I added some pearl onions and a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes. Some carrots or potatoes may have been a good idea, too.

I cooked a pair of frozen boneless chicken breasts and a pair of frozen bone-in thighs for about 6 hours on low. We added some corn starch to thicken it up and served it over mashed potatoes.

After this slow cook the breasts and thighs fell apart nicely. It was very tender.

When I do a dish like this again, I will probably just use chicken broth as a base, and perhaps add a little white wine. I will add some noodles and turn it into a stew.

I have to say that this was pretty good!  The beer really worked, it didn't even really taste like beer!

I used 4 frozen (I didn't thaw, either) chicken breasts on the bone with skin, and I didn't broil them - although next time I will use garlic salt, pepper, and flour, and brown them in a pan.

As always, I added chicken broth (1/2 can this time) to cover the meat so it wouldn't dry up.

I used about 10 cloves of garlic crushed and chopped.  I also sliced an onion and threw that on top of the chicken.

Also, I used 1 bottle of Pyramid Hefeweizen.  Next time I will squeeze a couple of oranges into the crock to enhance the flavor.

Cooked on LOW for 10+ hours so the meat was a tad on the dry side.  The soup/juice really helped though!  Just pour it on!

It definitely didn't have enough salt, but the herbs made it really tasty!  I served it with chicken and garlic rice-a-roni and sourdough bread.  Next time I will have white rice and some veggies on the side.  I will post an update after I've applied the modifications!

The beer in this recipe gave my chicken such great flavor.  Like the reviews said before, don't brown the chicken just throw it in frozen!  I cooked mine on low for 6 hours.  Perfectly moist.  Add two bottles of beer and a can of chicken broth.  I also added small creamer potatoes chopped up and onion.  For seasonings I used one package of Good Seasons Italian plus the garlic it said.  So the basic idea of this chicken is great so I guess you just add what you like!

Imade this recipe for my family and also made a few changes after reading the reviews. I cut the sage to 1/2 tsp. Added 2 T. minced dried onion, 1 C. chicken broth, and a second 12 oz. beer. I did not brown the chicken first. I let the chicken cook for 8 hours starting from frozen, and I thnk I should have cut it back to 6. It was still a bit dry for my tastes. Adding the broth and second beer helped to keep it from drying out further. You definetely need to make sure the chicken is completely covered. As for the taste, if you like a unique flavor, try it. My daughter would not touch it after the first bite. You can definately taste the beer, so if you don't like it stay away. Overall it was alright, but I don't know how likely I will be to make it again.

I read the reviews before making the recipe, and saw that both people that do, and people that don't like beer liked the chicken.  I don't like beer, but my husband dose.  I thought this would work for the both of us. We both thought this was just gross.  I'm not a picky eater and still had to throw it away.

This was an incredibly tasty and easy treat for us. Both my fiance and I love beer, and we thought the taste was great! Made lots of broth so it was easy to spoon onto leftovers later on. The chicken was soft and delicious and the spices gave it a great tang.

This was ok.  The chicken did turn out very moist and tender, but we really didn't like the flavor of it. The beer was very strong and almost too strong for our liking.  I think we will try again and reduce the amount of beer.  Thanks for posting all the same.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I liked the basic idea of it.  However I had to "spruce" it up some which really changed it alot.  Note, when this is cooking, it really does smell like beer.  And if you don't like beer, then you may not like this item.  I used a Heinekin, and a little bit of chicken broth.  I used chicken "breast cutlets". I added some balsamic vinegar, 1 can artichoke hearts, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, chili powder, salt, pepper, oregano, garlic, steak seasoning and the recommended amount of crushed garlic.
I absolutely loved it.  I boiled some penne pasta and served the sauce, which is thin with the chicken over the pasta.  This is a sauce, not a gravy.  The real kicker with this recipe is that the next day, it was even better.  Note:  I am not big on artichokes, so I only ate a few nibbles of the artichoke hearts, however they added great flavor.  I cooked everything in the crockpot for about 2-3 hours.  The chicken was moist, but not falling apart; balsamic vinegar added a great flavor and color.

I also thought the beer gave the chicken a strange taste...not tangy, just wierd. The rest of the spices were just ordinary. I will use the leftovers for chicken salad or any casserole that calls for cooked chicken, but will not make it again.

Not the best flavor. Needs some sort of sauce/gravy to serve on it.

This recipe is a really good idea. It was also my first attemp at using a crock pot!! I really liked the idea of cooking it in beer, but i don't like rosemary. I ended up using two bottles of beer and some soy sauce, i squeezed in a whole lime, tons of garlic, and instead of thyme and rosemary i used chili powder and cumin. it was great! i let it cook for about five hours or so. Fantastic!!

I followed the cooking instructions, even cooked a little less, and the chicken was so dry!!  There isn't any sauce to "moisten" it up with. We also thought the Rosemary was too strong.

I thought this would be a good recipe, my husband and I both like beer, there was way too much sage in it.  None of us could eat it.  you don;t need to precook the chicken and i did use frozen breasts, and that worked out well,  it was just too much sage.  It did smell great as it was cooking.
good luck!

I had a large pack of chicken breasts.  I am not a big fan of white meat so I wanted it juicy!  I used this recipe and it was perfect.  If you don't like beer I don't think you would like this.  We also only included the beer and garlic (actually used Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic).  It was awesome.  I did not pre cook the chicken.  I just threw it all in the slow cooker.  YUM.  If you like beer and garlic you MUST try this!!

This recipe is very tasty. Perfect amount of rosemary.  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs, broiled them 10 minutes on each side and it only took 2 and 1/2 hours in the slow cooker. I used 2 cups chicken broth but I forget to add the minute tapioca to make a thicker sauce. The chicken was very tender, falling apart by the touch. My boys didn't like the rosemary to much so they scraped it off and ate it anyway. I served the chicken with garlic mashed potatoes. Yummy and easy meal!

When mixing the herbs together, I thought the sage was too strong. So I only added the rosemary and thyme to the dish. It seemed blah so I added a bag of frozen pearl onions and a can of sliced mushrooms, drained. I thought the dish was tasty but my husband said it was not--thus, the 3 stars. I doubt I'll make it again.

This was just okay. It smelled great while cooking, but the flavor was a bit bland for me. My husband thought the beer taste was too strong, I didn't think it was strong enough. The chicken was very tender, and I added carrots, onions, and potatoes and a can of chicken broth. I might make it again, but would probably only use 6 oz. of beer and add some more seasonings to jazz it up a bit.

Took the advice of the others and altered the recipe a little bit. Omitted the rosemary and substituted italian herb mix, added one chicken boullion cube, 2 cans beer, tablespoon white wine and a cup of water. Also added some red potatos, carrots and chopped onions and cooked on low at 6 hours. The vegetables came out great, the chicken was very tender and juicy but still kind of bland. Not sure if I would make again, but thanks for the recipe!

I used 3 tsp of garlic salt instead of 6 garlic cloves.

I believe this will be a great recipe that I use more often. I am like others who have tried this one...don't broil the chicken...it dries it out too much.  The flavor is like none other that I've tried...my husband loves beer and I hate it, but I loved the taste of the chicken.  VERY EASY TO PREPARE.

This recipe is so easy. Not only did my family LOVE it, but boy did my house smell tasty all day. We can hardly wait till it's done.. I have at times added less garlic.

I made this recipe today in my crock pot and mmm, it was delicious!  The chicken turned out juicy, tender, and flavorful.  FYI, I didn't broil the chicken first though, so don't feel like you have to take that additional step.

My husband and I both like beer, but didn't like this chicken. It came out dry and the flavor was not great.

My family did not care for this recipe
at all.  They have requested that I do 
not make it again. The herbs are just too
strong tasting. Even my cats wouldn't eat
it.

Have to say that I thought the beer would make the chicken tender and juicy.  I was wrong.  The chicken lacked flavor and was dry.  Definitely will not be repeating this one.

I made this recipe because I wanted to use what I had on hand and this seemed like it would be good. It wasn’t impressive at all and I will not be making it again. You couldn’t really taste the beer but the chicken was strangely dry although I made sure that the liquid covered the chicken. I think maybe cooking it under the broiler first took out some of the natural juices. I ended up making a quick gravy from the liquid in the crockpot just to cover up the dryness. The only thing I changed was that i added some chopped onions to it. So if you just need something and these are the only ingredients you have on hand then making this wouldn’t be bad but if you have other options then don’t bother with this because there are so many better crockpot recipes out there.

Beer flavor and garlic was great.  Chicken was nice and moist and tender.  However, did not care for the mix of herbs as much as I thought I would.  Would try more garlic and different herbs next time.  But super easy to make!  I had seared the chicken breasts versus broiling them, but would skip that step next time as well.

Definitly add 2 cans of chicken broth.  1 beer was sufficient for us, and my husband enjoys beer.  I don't.  Overall, flavorful and different.

The flavor of this is unpleasant. I absolutely love beer, so I thought it was worth a shot, but the herbs didn't contribute much flavor at all and the beer gave it a really weird sour taste. I will have to salvage the chicken meat with a chicken salad or something, this recipe doesn't work for me.

I'm so glad I read someone else's review to add more water so the chicken was covered, I added a few cups of water and chicken and vegetable boullion cubes. The chicken was OK, healthy though I guess since it isn't cooked in a creamy sauce. But just OK.

Sorry, this was VERY dry and not very much flavor.  Definitely disappointed as it was very easy to make.  I broiled the chicken, but found this step to be unnecessary.

It's OK. The sauce was runny but flavorful. I did added some onions and a cup of chicken broth like the other reviewers suggested and made sure to covered the chicken with liquid. It definitely came out tender but bland. Not what I expected based on the reviews. I think the chickens needs to be marinated first for more flavor.

This recipe was really not good.  The smell in the house was the beginning.  But my husband who will eat anything and I both went forward with it and tried it anyway.  It really did not have a good flavor.  Just not something for us!
