Made recipe with ingredients listed except that I used dark corn syrup because that's what I had..it was excellent! We ate it with pumpkin pancakes and bacon. I stored leftovers in a glass syrup dispenser in fridge and the following weekend sat jar in bowl of hot water while I made gingerbread pancakes and sausage..was very tasty warm and kept nicely.

Very good on french toast this morning.  A little on the thin side (I thickened a bit),  but the spices are spot on.   Bairnmaeve , thanks for sharing your recipe.

Wonderful! I made this the morning of Halloween for our pumpkin pancakes, and it was so good I wanted to drink it!   I did add more pumpkin, about three fourths cup, just because I love pumpkin.

I just made this, and I had to start with a homemade simple syrup, cause I don't keep corn syrup in the house. I did so, and added a little less water than called for because so many reviews said it came out thin. I otherwise made it as written except I tried to thicken it down by simmering it for a while, which didn't really work. I even let it cool to room temp before I served it, and it was still on the thin side, but very tasty on French toast. I'll definitely make it again, but I might try adding a little pectin, like a 1/4 tsp, to try and get it to thicken a little. I might even add some to the leftover syrup and see what happens.

I love pumpkin and couldnt belive I hadnt thought of this. Wil be making to send out for gifts. For people with consistancy issues... cook longer. The longer you cook a syrup the thinker it will become.

I just made this yesterday, and my family devoured it! The only change I made was I omitted the allspice. We aren't fans of allspice, and it turned out great. I didn't have trouble with the consistency like another reviewer. It was thick, but not too thick. I will definitely make it again.
