This was excellent! The title is deceiving but  I'm thinking this would work great with wings too. If you are sensitive to heat I recommend leaving out the hot pepper altogether. I liked the flavor it added but it did pack a punch.  This was super simple and one I will definitely make again. 5 stars all the way!
