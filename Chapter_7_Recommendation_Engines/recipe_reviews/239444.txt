Smooth rich flavor after a few modifications. I decreased the yolks down to 3 which still provided a good amount of binder. I added a 1/4 cup more of heavy cream mixed with canned pumpkin to compensate for using less egg yolks. Just before churning my mixture, I tasted it and added an extra 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, knowing it would lose some depth in flavor. I also simplified the recipe by combining half-and-half, yolks, sugar, vanilla and pumpkin spice together and whisking the mixture on medium-low heat for 15 minutes until heated through. Overall, good ice cream
