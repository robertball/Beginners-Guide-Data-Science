Very moist and tasty muffins.  I've made them a few times and now I add more dates (about 1 cup) and I added the zest of half an orange and I put concentrated orange juice to really bring out the orange flavor.  Hmmm, the flavors are more present with these changes.

I omitted the nuts, and used vegetable oil instead of the butter.  These took 10-15 minutes to bake in the mini muffin pans.  The orange is a nice touch with the dates! We will be making these again!

Good.  I made them without dates or nuts, and I think I needed to at least add the nuts for some more flavor and texture.  Followed the recipe as written, otherwise, except for a splash of orange extract.  Made 12 minis plus 10 regular size muffins.  I made a blackberry/confectioner sugar glaze for the top.

I omitted the dates and added chocolate chips instead. It was delicious! Higly recommended.

These r just great. Very light and healthy.  I subsituted the butter with 1/4 cup  corn oil and ommited the nuts and added a cup of dates. I feel next time i'll add more orange zest and a bit more of dates. Definetly a keeper!

I made this recipe, with some small changes: added a small can of cherries with syrup and baked it in a bunt pan, the results were amazing. Note: it took 80 minutes to bake all the way; but it was so moist inside and nice n crispy outside-fabulous!
