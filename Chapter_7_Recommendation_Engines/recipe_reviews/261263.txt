This turned out quite tasty and is pretty easy to throw together with pantry/freezer staples. I'm keto so instead of using flour I whisked about 1/4 tsp of konjac powder into the heavy cream to thicken it. I ended up using a bit more cream than called for otherwise there didn't seem to be enough liquid for all the spinach. I would suggest seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper in the beginning (or adding it to the parmesan cheese) as the chicken itself was a little on the bland side. I also recommend using more Italian seasoning as I couldn't taste it. In my opinion cook no more than 30 mins. I set mine for 30 mins and the chicken was slightly overcooked - the chicken breasts were about 6oz each. Next time I will try 25 mins. I sprinkled with a bit of crushed red pepper for color. A great weekday recipe!

Very tasty dish. I couldn't get the sauce to look like that though it ended up just being a crumbly paste almost. Still very good!
