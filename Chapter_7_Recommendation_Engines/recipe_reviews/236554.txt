Made this last night and it was a HUGE hit!  The only change I made was to add additional peanut butter and heed my daughter's request to put some additional chocolate/butterscotch on the outside of the log.  Will definitely be making again!

I made it in a 13 X  9 inch pan.  Pressed it in as u do for making rice crispie treats.  I added mini peanut butter chips into the mixture after I took it off the heat.  Melted only chocolate and spread it on the top.  Tasted fantastic. Will make it again.   I was just too lazy to roll it as a log.

This was good - but VERY rich and chocolatey. I was hoping to taste the peanut buttery rice krispie layer more, but all I really tasted was a lot of chocolate! It is good if you have glass of milk to drink with it.

The Rice Krispie mixture was a little too moist and “blew out” the side as I was rolling it. Next time, and there will be a next time, will split mixture into two smaller rolls.
