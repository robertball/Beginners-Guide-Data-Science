I love these and they're so easy to make. My tip: don't chill the dough. I find it's so much easier to stretch it around the olive if I warm the dough in my hands slightly. Otherwise it's just too crumbly and appears to need more binder (like butter). With it warm it all comes together. I use small olives so they're just a bite or two each.

These are always a hit. My family loves them. I do need to add a bit more butter to the dough. Warm, crusty, and salty. Who doesn't love that!!

The trick is using a small ball and really pulling the dough around the ball.

I found them best cooked from frozen with an extended bake time, I used old cheddar, paprika, hot sauce and worstershire. Used only enough dough to cover olives, sometimes I can make 48 with this recipe - I get rave reviews!

I made this recipe for my husbands retirement party. I took the advice of some and made them the day before with a liberal dash of cayenne. They were very well received and was asked repeatedly for the recipe. Personally, I liked them better hot but know one else seemed to mind them at room temp.

Excellent!
I did grease the cookie sheet with Olive oil.
That was the only variation.

My mother always made these as Christmas when I was a kid.  I started making them a few years ago...always get RAVE reviews.  One person even said they were "the best thing he has ever put in his mouth."  And his mother is an awesome cook.  I do add a dash of cayenne.  Even enjoyed by non-olive lovers.

Yum, yum, yummy!  Cheesy, slighty-crispy breading outside and the soft, hot, salty olive inside.  Any appetizer I can freeze for later use is a godsend.

These are great, made them for a Christmas party.  Also, replaced olives with jalopenas...they were a big hit as well.

These were very easy to make and really good. I only had sliced olives so I just mixed them in with the dough and it turned out great.

When you first read this recipe you think "Hmmm, this doesn't sound good".  Well, you're right!  A bowl of olives would be just as popular, if not more so.

Love this recipe, though I prefer to use black olives, and I generally add more butter (til the dough seems right).  I usually triple or quadruple the batch, and place the dough-wrapped olives onto large baking sheets and into the freezer for a couple of hours.  Then you can put them into freezer bags so you can pull out however many you want, and they're not stuck together.

I LOVE these.  I can see where others might hesitate ("Cheddar baked WHAT?") but they are the perfect warm cheesey and salty. Sometimes I add a little kick with some cayenne, onion powder, garlic powder and/or mustard powder.

I had high hopes for this one.  I absolutely love olives!  But it was not good.  It was really bready and the olives were warm and gross.  My friends made fun of them and me for making them.  It's still a joke that I made the bread olives.

I make these for most parties. I also only get 24 and need to experiment with moistening the dough to put it on thinner.

I found the first batch bland. I took the advise of one of the reviews and used a little cayenne pepper and I also used garlic and jalapeno pepper stuffed olives for variety.

I served these warm and they were not very good. Had sort of a soft doughy- gummy texture. The leftovers were better cold the next day, crisp, crunchy and tasty.  If I make these again I would serve them cold. Recipe only made 24 olives

Average.  I am an olive lover and thought these would be GREAT!  I just wasn't thrilled with the results, although they were very easy to make.

I had very large olives, so I didn’t cover them completely.  Also the dough was too dry, as directed in the recipe, so I added a little water to make the dough stick together.   For additional flavour, I added 1/2  teaspoon of onion salt and a pinch of cayenne to the batter. They taste delicious!  Due to the extra liquid I added, the baking time had to be increased by about 5 minutes.

I've made a recipe similar to this one with the addition of 2 ounces (or more if you choose) of chili powder or paprika mixed with the dough. Any heat level you prefer works well, but it adds a bit of smoky richness to the olive balls. I have made thousands of these over the years and they always disappear wherever I bring them, especially popular with wine drinkers ;)  I've also subbed other cheese in, like blue cheese, and wowza!!!  Always a good choice to bring anywhere :D

These were good but tasted a little dry and flavorless. Next time I will add a little cayenne pepper and a little less flour. Also, I only had enough dough to make 24 olives so plan accordingly.
