My 11 year old son thought these were fabulous.  I did not.  They actually look rather unappetizing when baked because the banana mixture turns a brownish color.  I agree with the earlier comment - it makes twice the amount of filling that you actually need.  I think the filling would actually make a great spread for banana bread, ginger snaps or fruit.

Great recipe.  I'm a bariatric patient and don't get many sweets.  This one was a winner even with my non-diabetic and non-bariatric friends.  I did find, however , that there was twice as much filling as I needed.  I just saved it in the fridge and made another batch a couple of days later.
