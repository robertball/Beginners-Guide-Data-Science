Doubled the recipe for a party and added more than just 12 mushrooms.  Went really well with rice and a white riesling. Would make this again.

Do not make this with rice. I recommend using pasta to have some use for that marinara sauce. Definitely lacked seasoning though so maybe throw some Italian herbs into the mix.
