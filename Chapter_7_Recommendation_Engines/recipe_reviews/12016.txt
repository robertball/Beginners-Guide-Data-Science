This recipe is awesome!  I've been making it for a while now... I made it again tonight and decided to write a review this time because it's repeated deeeelicious!  I started topping it with parmesan cheese and Italian bread crumbs before putting it in the oven, it gives it a great touch.  Thanks for sharing!

Why do people write their changes and rate the recipe?   Shouldn't they first make it exactly like it is written and then rate it and then maybe suggest changes?  Even though I didn't make it yet, I think it sounds delicious.

I add a tsp. of dry mustard and some onion powder to the liquid. I also top my casserole with a good amount of shredded cheddar and top that with seasoned bread crumbs and then dot with butter. Great comfort food!

First off, I doubled the recipe. After melting the butter, I added 1 chopped yellow onion and two cloves of garlic, minced. After browning the flour and adding the milk, I added 2 tsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. both worstershire sauce and Frank's Red Hot sauce and 1 14.5 c. diced tomatoes including the liquid.  The sauce became a little too thick so I probably added a about 3/4 c. more of milk and then gradually added sharp cheddar and then the processed cheese.  I made sure to cook the pasta just BARELY al dente as it always cooks a bit more in the oven and I didn't want the end result to be mushy.  After I sprayed the casserole dish with Pam, I added the mac & cheese and then topped it off with about 1/2 c. each of bread crumbs and shredded cheddar.  The flavor was wonderful, but the sauce was a little thick.  I think that next time I will reduce the flour by half.  Thanks Kristin for your yummy mac & cheese recipe!

I used cheddar, and mozzarella and no processed cheese.  It turned out fantastic!  Even my fussy kids ate it!  I will make this again and again...

this is a very good basic recipe. like other reviewers, I  added some spices (salt, onion powder, ground mustard, worcestershire sauce) and topped with bread crumbs. also, instead of elbows, we use bowtie pasta. sometimes I'll add some good cubed ham to the mixture before putting it in the casserole dish, too.

This recipe is good, not great. Like other reviewers have said, it is a good basic recipe to build on. I don't like that the recipe uses so much processed cheese, though. I wonder if there's a way to get the creamy texture without all the Velveeta?

I prefer a more southern-style mac'n'cheese, but my family loved it to death.

If you like the crunchy, rich mac'n'cheese of the south, find another recipe.

This basic recipe is creamy, cheesy and rich. However it needs seasoning. I found it to be much better when I added dry mustard, a dash of Tabasco sauce, onion powder, and salt and pepper. Also, I topped it with buttered bread crumbs. I used shredded Velveeta for a creamy texture.

I didn't bake it in the oven, and it was still great! You NEED to add salt and pepper, because it is very bland. Italian seasoning in the cheese sauce and hot sauce in your bowl is very tasty. Don't use that 'processed' cheese, you don't need it. I just used one whole brick of cheddar cheese and it was great. If you like more cheese, add another brick. All in all, a great basic recipe that you can add your own twists to!

I love macaroni and cheese but I am very particular.  I made this dish without varying from the recipe.  This mac and cheese tasted like what you would get served to you in a family restaurant/diner.  Very good, but not great.  I think it would be a good mac and cheese to give neighbors, bring for a picnic or serve as a side dish for a family dinner.  I believe it would yield consistent results.  The processed cheese made it somewhat creamy and the cheddar did give some depth to the taste.  However, I am searching for the ultimate recipe and I don't think this is it, for me.  Also, it does look very "soupy" before you bake it, but don't be concerned, it becomes more solid in the oven.

If I'm going to have to thicken a cheese sauce with something, I'd sooner do that with cheese than flour.  In other words, the flour called for in this recipe was double what I was comfortable using while at the same time the cheese sauce looked like it could certainly use more cheese! I did cut the flour in half and doubled the Cheddar cheese and we were completely happy with the result. Not sure I would have liked the thicker, more "floury," less cheesy sauce this would have produced had I not made those adjustments. As I generally do when I make macaroni and cheese (which admittedly isn't often) I topped it with crushed crostini before baking. (Buttered bread crumbs would be great too) Don't forget to add salt and pepper to taste!

Not many recipes go into my recipe book unchanged, but this one does. It's your basic creamy mac & cheese recipe, but the way I see it, why mess with perfection? I'm not a huge fan of adding crackers or breadcrumbs, so if you're the same way you'll love this. I prepared the noodles and cheese sauce ahead of time so that it was only 30 minutes until it was on the table. I served it with brown sugar ham and broccoli - delicious, and definitely a hit with children.

This is a rich and creamy and easy recipe.  I made this on Easter for the kids who are picky eaters and it was cobbled up by the adults too.  I added a pinch of dried mustard, garlic powder and salt.  We will definately make again.

this is a good recipe. i used cheddar and mozzarella in mine. and of course i added black pepper and cayenne. i didnt need any salt cause the cheeses were salty enough. i used a little less flour so it was more creamy than thick. end result was FABULOUS. i topped it with more cheese for the final 10 - 12 mins; came out golden and cheesy and bubblt. LOVED IT!!!

Excellent and easy recipe. I did make a couple of modifications. I doubled the recipe for a fuller 9x13 pan. I added salt, pepper, and a little bit of Cajun seasoning. Then I topped it off with crumbled, fully cooked bacon and a little shredded cheddar.  Fantastic!

Fairly easy recipe.  I will be sure to cut the velveeta into small squares before I need them so they will melt faster.  I added one beaten egg just for a fluffier texture.  Will be making this again.  Thanks.

Excellent recipe.  I decided after first trying the recipe to add more cheddar cheese to the recipe to make it a bit thicker and give it a little bite.  The recipe was alot easier than I expected.

I rated this too soon last time and will never make that mistake again! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! I will never again try this in fact my husband has banned me from using this recipe. My family is full of GREAT cooks. So i expect a certain level of quality, after speaking to my mother she laughed at me and said Shari thats flawed first act like your making gravy then instead of making it thick like a white country gravy make it thin and add a good amount of cheese for a thin sauce  it will thicken as it cools.
In the end this recipe was not worth posting

This was just ok.  I've had better.  The cheese was a thick consistency after baked.  I think this could've used maybe a little salt too.

As mentioned before, this recipe is a great base!  I added about a teaspoon of both garlic powder and onion powder and some Worcestershire sauce to the cheese sauce.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and it came out bubbly and delicious!  My picky 5 year old loved this!  I will definitely make this again!

The base is creamy, but bland. I added seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. I used whole wheat pasta and whole wheat flour instead of the empty carb versions. I also omitted the icky processed cheese and put in about 1/2 a large brick of marble cheese and added frozen veggies to make it even healthier.

This was really really good. Made this for a Cancer Patient,who was on a food rotation by many other people in the community. The family asked for the recipe, and could they keep the dish too.  With the many prepared meals brought to them, they said this was only the second or third time they asked for a recipe. Add additional  items to this recipe that your family likes. I added crushed potato chips as a topping to this one.

Not the tastiest Mac 'n Cheese I've ever made.  Although the sauce was nice and creamy it just didn't taste all that great to me. I probably won't make again...it tasted kinda "blah".

Wonderful recipe! Doubled it, added 1 pound of thick sliced cooked ham from the deli, cubed. The kids, even the picky one, LOVED this recipe. Very creamy, not too rich! Just great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! I used a 4 cheese Italian blend in place of the cheddar, tiny shell macaroni and topped it w/ seasoned panko crumbs before baking. This came out perfectly creamy and yummy! I will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

SOOOO yummy!  I made this as a side dish for a family dinner last week, but it turned into the main dish - everybody left their chicken to the side and DEVOURED this mac and cheese.  Then, on New Years, when I asked what "fun food" everybody wanted me to make - this was the winner, so I made it again!

The only issue was that I found it a little runny.  I like a little drier mac n cheese.  The second time around, I doubled the amount of macaroni, doubled the cheddar cheese and left everything else exactly the same.  It's four stars as written, but five stars after I changed it!

After I made this, my husband declared me the "Mac N Cheese Goddess." "nuff said! No but really, we couldn't find the big elbow macaroni and so we used the spiral kind and that worked fantastic. We used 1 percent milk with no problems.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for my kids because I was too lazy to leave my house to buy kraft's and this blew away any other mac  I've tasted. I will definitely make this again and again.

I was looking for a Mac 'n Cheese recipe that was just like how my Mom made it with the white sauce before baking it in the oven.  This is almost exactly like it and is delish!

This is really good!  I added a dash of onion powder to the flour, and I think it added a little depth to the flavor.  Also, I wanted a really creamy macaroni, so I didn't bake it at all!  After mixing the cheeses with the pasta, I just let it rest for about 10 minutes, and it was the perfect, ultra-creamy consistency.

I have been making this for awhile and with a few changes this is a keeper.  I add mustard powder and onion powder in with the flour. Then I mix in 1/2 cup of sour cream to the cheese mixture right before putting it in the baking dish. I add bread crumbs to the top for some crunch.  I also usually add chopped chicken to the mac and cheese for a complete meal.

I had high expectations of this recipe and while I followed it exactly, it was extremely bland and tasteless. After adding some seasoned bread crumbs, a LOT of extra cheese, quite a few seasonings, salt, it was a lot better.  
I will say though that it was really creamy!

I change a couple of things. Instead of the 8oz. of processed cheese I used 8oz. of cream of chicken. I also used a small onion minced and add teaspoon of black pepper and garlic powder you can do it to your taste. I also used shells pasta, my sons request. You can use 10.5oz can of cream of chicken   
to make it more creamy. This was a great starter recipe. I am going to make it again. My family loved it. You could add a pinch of cayenne pepper if you want a little zing.

This is the best mac & cheese recipe I have tried.  The flour, butter and milk mixture is the key to making this creamy, cheesy dish.  I did not have any velveeta and opted for just 12 ounces of shredded cheddar and it turned out really good.  Will be using this recipe again.

Really tasty!  I think next time I'll use less cheese and add a little more milk because the texture ended up really thick and alomst sticky.  But I gave it 4 stars based on the flavors.  I did add some seasonings, red pepper flakes and garlic salt, and also some Italian breadcrumbs to the top.  Besides that I followed it exactly.  Really good, but next time I know I can make it better.  Thanks!

The overall flavor of the mac and cheese was good, however I found it to be quite dry upon baking. I would have enjoyed it better prior to baking. I added some extra seasonings such as onion powder, black pepper, and salt. I also used Mexican cheese and Kraft and velveeta singles to make the sauce since I did not have the velveeta block.

I like mac and cheese. This recipe is classic. I swap out the processed cheese for Monteray when making the sauce then I smoothed it out with 1/2 cup of sour cream. Started with a layer of precooked elbows in the baking dish, then Shredded Buffalo Chicken, more elbows on top and pour over the cheese sauce. Sprinkled Panko mixed with Bleu Cheese Crumbles and melted butter over the top before baking. Yum

It was good on flavor, but a little rubbery on texture. Next time I'll use only real cheese and omit the processed cheese, as that was the culprit. If you're going to use the processed cheese, don't count on eating leftovers, because it becomes VERY stiff. This was a good starter recipe for having never made this dish from scratch, but I'll be tweaking it for my own taste and doctoring it until I get it the way I like.

The BEST  mac and cheese I think I have ever had. I'm sitting here now eating the leftovers!! Can't stress this recipe enough!!  I used another recipe that called for breadcrumbs (Homemade Mac and Cheese) for the topping- and it was AMAZING! I choose to follow this recipe for the actual mac n cheese part to get the best result for cheesiness. It came out stellar and I will definitely be making this again for thanksgiving. I'm excited to 'WOW!' my relatives with this awesome recipe!

Doubled this for a 9 x 13. Creamy but way too bland. I even added mustard, onion and garlic powders and it was still bland. I also used sharp cheddar. I topped with crumbled ritz crackers which is not nearly as good as bread crumbs.

My 10 year old is a mac and cheese expert and he gave your recipe a hardy "good job" and two thumbs up!  We always have teased him that he will be ordering mac and cheese on his first date...now he can make his own :)  This one is staying in the family recipe box.  Easy cheesy!

I love this recipe, I don't even make the boxed mac and cheese anymore lol!! I added a pinch of nutmeg to the cheese sauce, subbed the processed cheese for mozzarella and sprinkled buttery cornflake crumbles on the top for a nice crunch. Otherwise its the same! Thanks for sharing!!! :)

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for when searching mac and cheese recipes.  Just your basic mac and cheese without any spices or seasonings.  Very easy to make.  I've made this many times over.  Perfect!

My first attempt at mac 'n' cheese & success! No more Kraft! I had a lot of cheese in the fridge but it was a random mixture; I used White American cheese slices, 1 garlic/herb cheese wedge & 1 c mixed shredded sharp cheddar & mozzarella. Per review suggestions, I added chopped onions, a splash of worcestershire, Frank's Red Hot sauce, garlic powder & black pepper. Fiance adored it - I liked it well enough but definitely will try it with *good* cheese next time. Oh, and I baked it for almost 20 minutes which dried it out too much for my liking. Pre-oven, it was super creamy but I guess it depends on how you like your mac 'n' cheese. Thanks! Now I know I can! :)

This was really easy and good.  I may reduce the flour as the cheese sauce was a little too thick for me.  Otherwise, really nice flavor.

Based on the reviews I read, this is a good base recipe, but needs more flavor.  I'm not fond of velveeta, so I reduced it to 6oz.  I also used 1/4c. chddar, 1/4c. colby, 1/4c. montery jack cheeses.  I also added nutmeg to cheese sauce.  After I moved everything to mixing bowl, i used 1/4 c. milk, i beaten egg, paprika, cayenne, salt, pepper, and a dash of hot sauce, whisked it all together and mixed with everything else.  topped it with shredded cheddar, parm, bread crumbs, then dotted it with butter; which gave it a wonderful 'top crust' if u will.  delicious.

WHEN I MAKE MACARONI AND CHEESE BAKED...I USUALLY ADD AN EGG AND MILK MIXTURE..WHICH I BEAT UNTIL ITS COMBINED VERY WELL..OF COURSE LETTING THE MACARONI COOL BEFORE ADDING SO THAT THE EGG DOESNT COOK....I ALSO ADD SEASONED SALT, BLACK PEPPER, GARLIC AND ONION SEASONING (NOT ALOT) AND SOME SAZON...I LIKE SEASONING...SO THAT WHEN THE MILK AND EGG MIXTURE IS ADDED, THE MACARONI ITSLEF DOESNT LOSE ANY TASTE...MIX ALL OF THAT REALLY WELL ALONG WITH SHARP, MILD AND CHEDDAR CHEESE, SOME MOZZARELLA TOO.

I thought this recipe was great.  I followed the recipe except instead of putting the shredded cheddar in with the velveeta, I put it on top and then baked it.  Very cheesy and delicious.

I really hate to be critical but this recipe is quite bland as indicated by other reviewers.  I even seasoned the sauce and added minced onion.  I had to use up processed cheese left over from Super Bowl so I chose to make this recipe.  To be fair, processed cheese has a funky, yucky taste by nature so I think that made the dish taste that way.  I guess I'm definitely not a fan of those big bricks of fake cheese.  However, I will say that I agree that this is a great basic recipe that can be modified with  better tasting cheese and much seasoning.  My husband said that the dish does need more cheese than the two cups in the recipe and I think I agree.

This was ok, pretty plain, the taste wasn't much different then just melted velvetta and milk poured over noodles, just wasn't as sticky.  Needed alot of seasonings, was kinda dissapointed but it was still decent. I quadrupled the recipe. I was cooking for a crowd of 30 and I have a ton left over.  Will probably try a different recipe next time to compare.

This was pretty good, easy to make too! It was a little grainy (I think from the flour not getting totally mixed smooth) which may have been my fault. I'll definately make it again :)

I have never even attempted to make baked mac and cheese until I saw how easy this recipe was.  
I made it with great success!  Everyone loved it!  My husband and five children.
I also made it for a family picnic and was "ordered" to bring it to everything from now on!  ;0).

So, over all it was wonderful!

Good basic recipe.  I use a block of velveeta, a pkg of Kraft sliced American Deli Cheese (not the kind individually packaged) and 1/2 bag monteray jack shredded chz.  Also added 1/2 tsp dry mustard and home made bread crumbs on top - outstanding!

This was pretty good but I thought that it was a little too thick. I forgot to get the elbow pasta so I used egg noodles instead. It went pretty good with the kids. Thanks.

This was super easy and really good!  I would use more noodles next time, it seemed like there was just a little bit too much sauce for the amount of pasta.

I added 1 1/2 Tbsp of powdered ranch dressing mix it and it added a great depth of flavor without overpowering it.  Definitely saving this recipe to make again.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I added seasonings so that the dish wouldn't be bland. I added chopped onion, minced garlic, salt, a dash of black pepper, onion powder and a dash of garlic powder. I used cheddar and Velveta, in the same amounts listed in the recipe. This dish came out wonderful. It was creamy and had great flavor (due to the seasonings added). I don't like cheese, and normally don't eat it, but this is a dish I would eat over and over. My guests loved it as well.

Family favorite! WE have made this a few times now (also tried some other recipes)! This one is hands down the best ever! I also dice up some bacon and fry it up while the noodles are cooking. I mix half right into the big bowl with the cheese and noodles. Then the other half I put over the top in the last 10 minutes of baking! YUMMY!

Very good. I added a a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce, a couple of dashes of hot sauce, a squirt of dijon mustard, and a sprinkle of onion powder and salt for more flavor. Thanks for posting the recipe.

BA BAM!  This stuff is freaking amazing.  I remember hearing that when Opera gained all her weight she was eating like 4 pds of mac n cheese a day and I had never had home made mac n cheese -- so I was like GROSS..... but seriously.  I had to pry myself away from it just so I could put it in the oven and finish cooking it!!  SOOO GOOD!

I am revising this because after consulting with my Facebook friends. .... my mother in law informed me that this recipe would be better with cream cheese.  I added a bit to my batch today -- SHE IS RIGHT.  Do not skip adding some cream cheese.  SOOOO GOOD!

I have used this white sauce recipe for years and years, but with a full pound of pre-cooked pasta.  When the white sauce is hot and bubbly I add a large block of cheddar cheese (grated or cut up into chunks), 16 oz block of Velvetta (cut into chunks), 2 lbs of cooked, drained and cut-up bacon, then pour over the pre-cooked pasta when cheeses are melted, topping with Italian bread crumbs before popping into the oven.

Very Good!  This is exactly what I was looking for.  I've always just made my mac and cheese from scratch, with no recipe, I just winged it.  So, this time I decided to look for something very similar to what I typically make.  This recipe calls for no spices, so I added some salt, pepper, and onion powder.  Thanks!!

Nice recipe.  If I'd had it my way I would've fried some onions in with the butter to give it more flavor but the hubby turned his nose up at that idea!  I suppose adding other goodies would have been nice but sometimes less is better with an old standby such as this.  All in all it is as about as close as one can get to Grandma's homemade stuff!

Made as part of Christmas dinner.  The best mac & cheese recipe I've found so far.  It was really creamy.  Might try and add some extra cheese on top next time.

This is a good base recipe. I forgot to put in the velveeta, and it would have been better if I did. I didn't deduct stars for this though. It did need extra spices, I thought. I used a litle garlic powder, worcestire, tobasco and red pepper flakes. Pretty Good!

I thought this was great - exactly what I was looking for.  I accidentally doubled the cheddar - oops 8^)  and then I topped it with pieces of American.  Very cheesy next time I will put in the recommended amount of cheddar.  I also added salt and pepper - of course.  Thanks, I will add this to the usual mix.

My husband and I loved this dish but the kids didn't care for it at all.  They expected a creamy and smooth cheesy type sauce, kind of like the Stouffer's frozen type, but this was more of a clumpy kind of consistency.  Perfect side dish for when the kids are away.

It looked like an okay recipe but I added things to fix it! Velveeta instead of cheese food. I added cooked bacon bits and chicken. A little garlic salt And also Panko bread crumbs and a little butter to the top and it made it a total 5/5! Big hit!

I've made this twice now and it will be my go-to homemade Mac n cheese from now on. I've tried some other, more complicated (=more ingredients, more time consuming) recipes and this one tastes the best!  My kids -all 4 of them-  devour it and they were die hard Kraft Mac fans prior to this. This is simple enough I can whip it up with little extra time, and I can also make ahead then pop in the oven when ready. I sprinkled bread crumbs and a light sprinkle of cheddar on the top before baking. I made it with shells and wagon wheel pasta. Delish either way!  Yum!!

Great foundation! I just add some salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and hot sauce to taste.

Absolutely tastes like school Mac n cheese. Must use grated Parmesan on top bc it's missing something. Used Italian bread crumbs but didn't like how they made the topping chewy. Neither did my daughter. Honestly for the cost of ingredients I bought this same flavor of macaroni and cheese--- frozen

I make this recipe once a week since i found it.  Its awesome, and so easy to make.  It was very close to my mothers mac and cheese, so I went ahead, and added small cubes of muenster cheese, and a can of drained whole tomato squashed up, and topped it off with cubed swiss and bread crumbs.  tastes like childhood!!!

It was ok. I normally don't make a cheese sauce so my mac and cheese turns out thick and I was trying to make a creamier dish. This wasn't any creamier and the cheese flavor was weaker. I don't usually bake it, either, and still don't see any reason to. Not inedible but not worth the extra effort.

Excellent! Very yummy. Unfortunately, it did not keep very well for us past the one day mark - but we feel that this may be the nature of the pasta, so my only suggestion would be to just make what you're going to eat that night. : )

This was a huge hit! The only thing I added was a tsp of onion powder, worcestershire sauce, and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. If you did not add these spices, it would still turn out great the way it's stated...I just wanted a little kick!

This was my first attempt at homemade mac-n-cheese. Given that,it turned out really really good! Seemed a bit thick and gooy, so I may increase the milk next time, how ever with just myself and my wife there is enough left for 2 or 3 more meals. As others suggested I may try a bit of dry mustard to ad a little zing. I served this with extra large boiled shrimp and fresh lima beans, made a great combination.

This was a simple and delicious way to make Mac & Cheese, without just opening a box from the supermarket! A few easy steps and you've got a great dinner for the kids. I actually created my own version of a Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese, starting with this recipe. I then layered 1/2 the Mac & cheese in a 2 quart casserole dish, then added buffalo chicken (In skillet, melt 1 1/2 Tbl butter, and 1/4 Cup Frank's Hot Sauce. Mix in 1 1/2 Cups cooked, cubed chicken breast). Then top layer is the remainder of the Mac & Cheese. Cover & Bake as directed in this above recipe. ~ This received rave reviews by all at the dinner table. Will make this again!

I've been looking for a while for a good mac n' cheese recipe and I think this is the base for it.  I changed it by adding a few extra ingredients, but this recipe gives the perfect combination of base ingredients for a not-too-dry mac n' cheese.  I added finely diced jalapeno peppers, finely chopped dried tomatoes (in oil), substituted goat cheese for the processed cheese, and substituted some of the milk with heavy cream.  Finally, I added about 1/4 tsp. of dry mustard.  Oh, I almost forgot--I combined 1/2 cup fine bread crumbs with 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan for the topping.  It was the best mac n' cheese I've ever made.

This was a fairly easy recipe to make. I like that there are few ingredients and adds ins are endless. But you really have to like the taste of American cheese to enjoy this recipe, and I'm not that big a fan. Also, it does not reheat well for leftovers. Good for when you're in a pinch. Just make enough for what you need, and throw in some add ins. I don't plan on making this again any time soon.

Love it.  It's my new go-to mac and cheese.  4 stars are given for the recipe as is.  If you change nothing, it's a great basic mac and cheese.  

5 star version changes the cheddar for something else (monterrey jack) and a dash of dry mustard.

Now to be fair, my family didn't like this recipe.  But following some suggestions below we added bread crumbs, onion powder, and dry mustard.  Also being lactose intolerant we used Silk milk and milk free cheese.  Grandmother took one bite and pushed the plate away.  My wife took two then did the same.  I ate the whole thing, but then again, I'll eat almost anything.

Like some of the other reviewers, I thought this recipe needed seasoning... I added dry mustard, onion powder, pepper, and put crumbs on top, but still thought it was missing something... The rest of the fam fell in love with it. It was very easy and I will make it again.

This recipe is just like a recipe I had in a cook book I had lost. It turned out great. I put all the cheese sauce ingredients in a blender and heated up the 2 cups of milk in the microwave and then added that to the blender, I also added some hatch Chile   pepper powder to kick it up a little. And then poured it all over the macaroni and baked.

This was fabulous with a head of cauliflower florets! I boiled it al dente, and added some chopped, cooked, bacon. The cauliflower didn’t absorb the liquid at all. So creamy! I made a batch with macaroni too, but the cauliflower was better. I used 4 T. butter, 1/2 cup flour, 2 cups milk, and 16 oz. processed cheese (no shredded).

Sooo good, and creamy! The only thing I added was a little Parmesan cheese to some bread crumbs right on  top of the macaroni and cheese before baking.
Served at a family get together and it all went. I have already shared this recipe!

This one was a winner for me and my friends. I did what a few others did here and added 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a bit of salt and pepper. Also used some high quality gouda and cheddar (I live in Wisconsin). I made for a friendsgiving and this was the one thing that folks raved about. This will be my go to recipe for mac and cheese.

This was such an easy recipe to follow and great for a basic starting point. I did "Dr" it up a bit to suit our taste but it's fine as is if that's what you like. I kept the butter and flour the same, used half and half in place of the milk. added 8oz of cubed Velveeta and an 8 oz pkg of sharp cheddar, which is actually 2 cups in place of the one cup. I added some onion powder and little salt to that just to give it more flavor. topped it with Italian bread crumbs before baking. FABULOUS !!!

This was good except it did need seasoning . The sauce was very thick and had to much cheese. I added more milk and when I make it again I will add less cheese to the sauce.

The recipe was super easy to make. I added a cracker topping. I think I need to do a more flavorful cheese. It was a bit bland.

I made this today for Christmas dinner with my family.  it came out so good that I had to stop myself from eating too much of it before I even put it in the oven.  I didn't make any alterations to the recipe,  just doubled all ingredients.  it's a must to add shredded cheese to the top.  my family cleaned the dish.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe to build off.  I added bacon bits, black pepper, pepper jack cheese, and topped it with Italian style breadcrumbs.  It was delicious!

A great Mac and Cheese base for anything you want to add to it. Salt and pepper are a must as it  is a little bland. Next time I make it I'll add some pepperoni and see how that goes!!!

This is a really good base recipe. I made it just as the directions specified the first few times, but then got adventurous. While its good as is, my family preferred it when I made it with equal parts mozzarella and parmasean cheese instead of the processed cheese. Its also good with havarti, colby, or monteray jack cheese instead of the processed cheese. I haven't tried subbing out the cheddar yet, just because we like the sharpness of it, but the recipe gives a lot of wiggle room for experimentation. 

Another addition people like was havarti with sauteed mushrooms and crushed garlic (fresh not jarred). It was a more "grown up" taste. Just make sure after sauteing the mushrooms you put them on a paper towel to drain and pat excess moisture off, otherwise it can add to much grease/moisture to the dish.

I LOVE this recipe as is!  For future man & cheese, I also added a 1/2 tsp salt & pepper & ground mustard to the butter flour mix.  Also used a blend of different cheeses to switch it up a bit.  Thank you for sharing!!

I just made this tonight for dinner for my kids and I with croissant dogs.  THEY LOVED it.  They said it tastes like Macaroni Grill mac and cheese which they also love.  Thanks for the recipe!  I accidentally put two cups of shredded cheddar instead of one but it is still amazing!

This is mac and cheese is great!
Add 1/2 cup gouda for extra cheesy goodness.
Occasionally I add one or more of the following, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, onions,  jalapenos, and/or bacon  into the butter and flour for a little something extra.

It's so easy!  It tastes great too .  I think that I left it in the oven about 5 minutes longer than necessary.  I took it out and poured some milk on top of it to add back a little moisture.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Thank you for sharing.

I added seasoning to this (some dried onions, garlic, salt and pepper) and there still wasn't any flavor.  It was dry and now creamy whatsoever.  I will never make this again.

This was delicious! I've made it as a 'healthier' mac and cheese as well. For that, I add the following:  1 cup fresh broccoli florets, 1/4 cup low-fat cottage cheese, whole wheat or veggie pasta, substitute 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese for the processed stuff, 1/4 tsp sicilian seasoning, 3 tsp freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1 cup skim milk. Sometimes i add a couple tbls of black olives or diced roma tomatoes. Obviously suit seasonings to your specific tastes. This can be transformed into a delicious AND healthy mac and cheese!

this is the easiest and best macaroni and cheese recipe I've ever made. I modified the recipe slightly by adding a little more butter to the reaux, andI sauteed approximately 1/4 a cup of finely chopped onion in the butter. In addition added about half a cup of breadcrumbs and have a cup of parmesan cheese at the end spreading it across the top dotting the top with about 2 tablespoons of butter. Came out delicious!

This stuff was great. I made 100 servings for a wedding and everyone raved. Sooo creamy. I added crushed club crackers and extra cheddar to the top before baking and I put some pepper and powdered mustard in the roux, just because I always have before but those aren't the key because this is the best recipe I have ever used. :)

I made this recipe step-by-step for a family gathering.  It was a big hit!  It is thick and creamy.  The second time I did it I added toasted breadcrumbs (I am new to cooking) and that was even better.  By the third time I made it, I got adventurous.  I'm from the South and my grandma sometimes used heavy whipping cream as a substitute for milk.  I made 16 servings (32 oz. elbows) with 6 cups of whole milk and 2 cups of heavy whipping cream.  The consistency was much thicker, almost like a casserole, but it was even more popular with my family.  We had plenty of leftovers.......which were excellent battered up and FRIED!!!!

This is a really good recipe. I use half and half instead of milk, and shredded mild cheddar and white sharp cheddar for the "cups" portion of the recipe. For the processed cheese, I use 1lb 1/2 American cheese and 1/2 lb muenster cheese sliced from the deli.  I add a pinch of mustard powder, and season to taste with garlic powder, onion powder, fresh ground pepper a little Kosher salt and a little of Lowry's Seasoning ( don't use a lot of salt because cheese is a bit salty anyway). The key is to taste the cheese mixture to make sure it tastes good.

Great basic recipe!  If you are a blander eater it is fine as is.  If you want to kick it up...go for it.  We like it kicked up....I seldom make mac n cheese due to mac n cheese not being a healthy meal no matter the recipe.  When I do make it I do it the same as this recipe however add things I have on hand. Tonight I did a mirepoix of celery, red pepper, jalapeno pepper and the white parts (base) of a few green onions.  Then did the roux.  I added garlic powder, dry mustard, pepper (no added salt), and a splash of Worcestershire....plus a little Parmesan.  I topped with the only thing I had on hand...which was Cheese-its.  Enjoy, it is a comfy food recipe that you can eat as is...or build it to you desire...don't be afraid.  BTW, served with leftover smoked root beer can chicken and peas YUM!

Oh my goodness, sometimes the simplest is the best! I rated this as is before I added anything to it. It's a really good basic mac and cheese recipe, but the flavors were a little weak and sort of nondescript for my taste, so I added to it some Dijon mustard (for an entire package of macaroni I made this sauce and added about a tablespoon, maybe 1 1/2 tablespoons) and some kosher salt to make the flavors "pop". I loved the additions and thought they added so much to an already great recipe.
