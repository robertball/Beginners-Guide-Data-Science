My vegetarian family really liked this recipe. I did change it a tiny bit: I used 1/2 a yellow onion instead of that canned fried stuff, sautéing it in the olive oil until translucent and then added the chopped asparagus right into the pan. I replaced the milk with soy milk and the half-n-half with a margarine and soy milk combo. Baked it crust-less in a ceramic pie pan, came out perfect in the specified time and temp..

An outstanding quiche recipe.  Used a frozen deep dish crust and had too much mixture for the pan, so recipe could be reduced 1/4, if desired.  Added salt and pepper.

Recipe Group Selection:  04, April 2015 ~ Wow, sometimes you just REALLY, REALLY like a recipe - and that was the case for me and this quiche!  It was very easy to put together and the taste was fantastic.  I used the equivalent of 4 egg white and 2 whole eggs and didn't measure the cheeses, but I'm sure I didn't use 11 oz. and used 3/4 pound of asparagus. It produced a very full deep dish pie pan.  Because my DH thinks there needs to to be meat with a meal, I added diced ham to half of the quiche.  I enjoyed a piece from the side without the ham.  This baked up and set up so nicely, that the next time, I'm going to make it without the crust.  Nice recipe selection this week.  I served this with fresh strawberries.

Low carb version- omitted crust. Did not miss it at all. Did amply grease the baking dish.

Loved the recipe. Easy to make and a wonderful blend of flavors.   I didn’t add the French onion rings  but it was delicious without them.

Very  very good!  Followed the recipe to the letter except I had to use cheddar cheese instead of Swiss because I didn't have it at the time I decided to make it yesterday.  This dish goes great with fresh fruit to accompany it, especially strawberries!  Good job!

I changed it a bit - used only 5 eggs, reduced milk to 1/2 cup and half-n-half to about a 1/3 cup.  Then I added some crumbled bacon and used a 15 oz can of asparagus spears (drained); putting it in a ready made frozen 10 inch crust.  Yum!!

I sauteed "real" onions instead of the canned ones.  Other than that followed recipe exactly.  Loved it!!!  A new favorite quiche!

Very good quiche! I used yellow onion in place of the canned and sauteed that with the asparagus in olive oil and butter. I halved the recipe and should have taken it out of the oven earlier, at about 40 min (a little too brown at 45 min with my oven). I also made this crustless, which I see others did as well. I really don't miss the crust or the extra carbs at all. Some garlic or onion powder would give a flavor boost.

I did not have any green onion and used a sweet onion instead. This altered the original taste, I'm sure.  My husband had a second helping, unusual for him. I froze remains portions and took to work for lunch. Will make again and again but next time with green onion.

Sauteed mushrooms with the asparagus. Then added bacon, previously cooked, and frozen. We really enjoyed this, and will make again.

Very good quiche! Filling but not heavy-tasting. I had some heavy cream to use up, so I used that instead of milk/half and half. Also used the whole 8 oz bag of swiss cheese and 3 oz of colby jack instead of cheddar. My 'bunch' of asparagus seemed rather large, so I used as much as would make a thick layer in my 10-inch skillet. This left enough to make a side for tomorrow's dinner :) Served with fruit and made for a very satisfying dinner, thanks so much for the recipe Graceeh!

It was truly delicious and my hubby gobbled it up!  I’m diabetic so made it in a well greased 8” glass baking dish (no crust) and baked as suggested.  I used 1 cup of half and half and  omitted milk and green onions. I also added 2cloves garlic and a little siraccia. Served with a salad and baguette. Will not hesitate to make it again.

Made without crust and cooked as noted — it came out beautifully. I added about 1/2t salt to mix and a few grinds of pepper. Next time I’ll use 1t salt and more onion.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe stated, with the exception of adding a few shakes of garlic powder.  My family isn’t particularly fond of asparagus, but this quiche was well received.

The whole family loved it and there wasn't even a crumble left :)
I added ham and had it actually for dinner and not for breakfast. Either way..... my family can eat breakfast and time of the day, so a great recipe for us.

I followed the recipe except used cheddar and Colby cheese as I didn’t have any Swiss and sautéed the asparagus and onions separately, adding a pinch of salt and pepper.  It is a beautiful, delicious quiche.  Thanks!!

It was a hit !  I made it for Mother's day brunch along with overnight blueberry French toast casserole.  They were the best things I have ever made.  I will definitely make both recipes whenever I get the chance.

Big hit. Did as others advised and used caramelized onions instead of fried canned ones.  Used heavy cream instead of half and half. We all loved it.

Sauteed onion and 2 cloves garlic with asparagus. Added chopped ham the first time I made it. Used cheddar fried onions because I had them on hand. It was very tasty. I am making it again one week later everyone loved it so much. I will add some bacon this time.
I made this in a deep dish pie pan and it took a little longer to bake for the middle to set up.

There was waaaay too much liquid (milk/cream/egg)in this recipe.  I had to skim off just about a cup of of the mixture prior to putting it in the oven.  If not, I would have ended up with a tremendous overflowing mess.  I used sauteed fresh onions, as I did not have the french fried ones.  The taste was very good - simple and straight forward.  Next time I think I'll add some fresh herbs just to give it more umph.
