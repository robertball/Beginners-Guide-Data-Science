Very yummy!  Much better than the tortilla chips you buy at the store.  I even tried flour tortillas with this recipe

These are so easy and fun to do!  You can use any type of tortilla.  I used flour tortillas that I cut with a pizza cutter to make them uniform.  I didn't have a mister so I just sprayed them with butter flavored Pam, squeezed fresh lime juice over top then sprinkled the spices and salt over them.  I watched them closely during baking so they browned not burned and they went great with fresh salsa and guacamole.

This is an easy recipe to make and very good with some salsa.  I used olive oil instead, but that was the only change I made.  Very good and better for you than store bought chips.

SPEED/EFFICIENCY TIPS... Brush the whole uncut tortillas with oil/juice(I used only 2 Tb. lime juice to avoid sogginess. Then stack the whole brushed pile and cut into 6ths or 4ths. Spread on pan and sprinkle with seasoning. I loved the seasoning as stated, and it was also great with Cholula dry lime seasoning. BAKE on bottom rack and flip chips over after top is crisp. Surprisingly, these were better cooled; I thought they tasted similar to Doritoes!

This recipe was good.  I used flour tortillas and pita wedges instead of corn and I didn't add the lime juice.  Basically, I brushed the wedges with olive oil and sprinkled the cumin, chili powder, and salt seasoning on top.  I baked them for about 10-15 minutes and they came out crunchy and delicious.  We like them with home made tomatillo salsa!

I didn't have limes, so I just sprayed on olive oil.  I also added some seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  Delicious!

tasty healthy snack!  I LOVE chips and I love that this is a healthy alternative.  I too used olive oil and basted the chips with a pastry brush.  I seasoned with sea salt and paid close attention to the chips as so many reviews had problembs with burning.

YUM!!!  These were a nice change from store bought tortilla chips, and so much healthier!  I used whole wheat flour tortillas, so some of the thick parts took a while longer to get crispy.  I left out the cumin, and they still tasted great.  I dipped them into guacamole, but next time I think hummus would be a good compliment!

Great flavour, everyone loved these. It took a few batches for me to get it perfected. I didn't have a mister so i just brushed the oil mixture on with a basting brush. They don't get as crispy as your store bought chips, but are a nice alternative.

YUM YUM.  I stored mine in a ziplock, and they were actually better the next day!  They were less chewy, and more crisp!  These are SO easy!  Lots of fun.  I'll make them again, I'm sure.

Used Olive Oil, took a few batches to get cooking time just right but time is pretty correct for 6 inch corn tortillas.  If you mix spices in oil mixture spreads more evenly instead of "sprinkling" on.  Tried with flour tortillas, need to cut cook time in half!

Being generous with the olive oil is the key.  When I wasn't, they were dry and not very good.  When I was generous, they were very good.  It helps to season each side, then cut with pizza cutter.  Also good with just olive oil and lemon pepper.

Where has this recipe been? I loathe the store bought tortilla chips - waaaay too salty for my taste (I prefer sweets than salty snacks).  I used W/W flour tortillas, Olive oil (better for you) in place of Vegetabel Oil and used a home-made Taco Seasoning Mix in place of just the cumin/chili powder - baked for about 6 minutes a side (brushed the oil/lime juice on with a pastry brush as I do not have a mister) and they turned out wonderful! I only made a small batch (using 3 six inch torillas) and that with a small batch of home-made guacamole was hoovered up in no time (all for ME!) I was not sharing... :) Thanks for making this recipe possible Michele - it's a great alternative for the high sodium store bought ones!

I make chips all the time with pita bread usually. But the easiest way is to lay the tortilla out and brush with oil (I use olive) and sprinkle with coarse salt and whatever seasonings you like BEFORE cutting into wedges (I do both sides). It is much easier than doing  each individual chip. For those who have trouble with them burning, your oven may run a little too hot, so just lower the temperature. I have even done them at 250 degrees, just leave them in longer to evaporate the moisture in the chips. I always test one or two to make sure they are as crispy as I like.

These are GREAT!!  Better than any bagged chips.  I cut the tortillas with scissors, then mixed the oil and chili powder (I don't like cumin) and salt in a bowl.  Added the cut tortillas to the bowl a few at a time to cover in oil, then baked in a 350 convection for about 15 minutes.  Delish!  Thanks

Update: I use this recipe often, but I pour olive oil in a bowl and then mixed in the spices. I brush the olive oil mixture on each whole tortilla, stack them, and then cut them into triangles. In my original review, my chips were a little too brown so I reduced the time, but I honestly believe this really depends on your oven because now a couple years later, it's not enough time for the chips to be crispy and I've gone back to the time the recipe says. So the time varies depending on your oven.

I have been making home made tortilla chips in the oven for over 25 years, they taste great and are more healthy than cooking in all that oil.
I spray mine with pam, then sprinkle with salt, garlic powder and a little paprika then bake.

Nice alternative to the salty store bought brands but I just use plain vegetable or olive oil only. For fun, add some fresh ground pepper. Yum!

These are delicious and easy.  I used whole wheat tortillas. Made a stack of tortillas and cut in triangles.  Put in a plastic bag and added olive oil and lime juice.   Shake around and then lay in single layer on cookie sheet.  Sprinkle with chili powder and seasoned salt. Make sure to brown enough to be crunchy without burning. These even stay crunchy when stored in a plastic bag.

The concept is uber versatile!  Doesn't have to be savory!  Can use vegetable oil, a squeeze of liquid splenda, & cinnamon to make a sweet chip. The one thing I've found that might be useful is to spray & season BEFORE you cut the tortillas into wedges. Then stack them up 4 or 5 deep, then cut them up.  You get your chips seasoned more evenly & end up with less stray spray or seasoning wasted.  Doing it this way saved me loads of time. A pizza cutter is perfect for slicing tortillas into wedges quickly too!

So cheap and easy. I use flour tortillas, spray them with cooking spray (less calories), sprinkle with salt and bake....Great with tacos!

Well, how nice!  I was not expecting much from this recipe, just needed to use up some of my old flour tortillas.  But what a pleasant surprise!  I only made one batch, and they were a little over-browned, but still edible, yummy and crunchy too!  Perhaps it's because my tortillas were old and slightly dried out, but at any rate, these were great!  
I also don't have a mister, so I just mixed the oil and juice together and put my 4-year-old to work and had her brush it on each chip (*grin*)
Thanks for the simple recipe!

Taste just like the ones at El Toritos!  But I deepfried instead of baked which is probably not as healthy. I love them and everyone who comes over requests them now along with my homemade salsa that I also got from All Recipes.

These are fabulous. I had 18 corn tortillas and I cut them into strips. I used a spray olive oil as I had no mister and sprinkled with a little bit of salt. I am going to use them with the Vegetarian Tortilla Soup from this site. Can't wait to try it.

I really loved these chips! They seasonings give them a nice kick that is complimented by the hint of lime. Since I do not have a mister, I simply mixed together the oil, lime juice, and seasonings and brushed this mixture onto the tortilla pieces. Yum! I will certainly be making these again; thanks for sharing the recipe!

I didn't have a mister, so I put the oil mixture on a plate and sort of bathed the tortillas before quartering them with scissors and laying them on the baking sheet.  I think they were better(though fattier) this way, because the ones toward the end of the batch were not nearly as good as the ones from the beginning, because they got much less oil on them.  Also, the spice mix was very good, but next time, I may try plain salt on them.  Thanks for the recipe--I have a freezer full of corn tortillas that are going to get "the treatment!"

I eliminated the spices and just used the salt to top these and they were delicious. Much better than any store bought chips and fantastic with homemade salsa.

FYI.  Combine everything in a bowl and stir to mix.  Brush on the tortillas, then cut with a pizza cutter and bake.  Easy peasy.

I changed these up a little by brushing both sides of the tortillas with olive oil rather than vegetable oil, and seasoning them with dried herbs and sea salt rather than the chili powder and cumin. Versatile recipe with lots of options - Parmesan cheese  or cinnamon sugar might be next!

I checked on these when they had a min and a half left and felt they needed to go the full amount of time. I came back to the oven when the buzzer when off and they were badly over crisped. Keep a sharp eye on these the last few minutes so you aren't as disappointed as I was.

Wasn't too impressed with this recipe...mainly because the chips never really got crispy. Even after doubling the time in the oven. The seasoning was good though.

These were not so great--I'd prefer store-bought chips to them.  The flavor was all right, but they didn't have the right crispness.  Definitely serve them warm!

I love this recipe!  I skipped the cumin and chili powder because I was making it for my kids, but I would have much preferred the extra kick.  I baked mine for about 11 minutes because I was scared of overdoing it, but they were a little chewy in the center still.  Kids loved them, Husband and I loved them so I'm thrilled!  They are so easy and we always have an abundance of corn tortillas around.

I have made this recipe twice so far and I really like it! The first time I made it using the ingredients listed, but they came out a little burnt. The second time I just used a sprinkle of salt, and baked the same way-- these were great! I made sure to watch them closely the last few minutes to make sure they didn't get to brown. Will definitely make again!!

These were pretty good. I bet they would have been delicious with salsa, although we were out of it. I've made a similar recipe before, sprinkling parmesan on the tortillas instead to good effect. I just didn't find this particular recipe to be incredibly flavourful, but they were still pretty tasty.

These are great!  I used less oil and used a pastry brush to apply to torillas.  Omitted cumin and only used chili powder.  I've made quite a few batches of these and they go fast! Do make sure that you watch them so they don't burn. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these exactly as written. They were tasty, but some turned out a little harder than others. Maybe I need to use thinner tortillas. Other than that though, they were fine.

Great Chips! I will definitely make again! I baked them for 7 minutes on each side and only put the oil and spices on one side. Very great alternative to regular chips!

I made these last Christmas Eve and will make again this year!  Mix all spices in a small bowl (I used extra) , add lime juice and oil ( I used 3 T olive oil).  I brushed on both sides and stacked tortillas.  I cut through whole stack at once into 8 wedges.  Single layer and just watch really close.  One minute they are not done and the next they are done!!  Half way through take cookie sheet out and shake chips around. ( Chips closer to outside of tray get done faster)  I used 6'' flour tortillas (my favorite).  These were crisp, flavorful and lasted a few days in a ziplock.

Im not quiet sure what I did wrong. I followed all the directions, and brushed on the ingredients. I cooked them the suggest amount of time, without burning them. They turned out VERY hard, and burnt tasting. I had to throw these out. I just wish I knew what I did wrong! Sorry,

Quite tasty! Watch the cooking time, though - I slightly overcooked them. While still good, they were a little "too" crunchy. The lime and oil is a great idea that I'm going to try on chicken!

I didn't season the chips before baking them. I sprayed both sides of the chips with non-stick cooking spray and I cut the second cooking time to 3 minutes. If I left them in any longer, they would've burned. Also, I just seasoned them with salt while they were hot since I was going to eat them with salsa. They turned out great!!!

My family thought these were awesome....I thought they were okay texture wise. I loved the flavor, truely loved the flavor. But what I don't care for was the fact that they were rather hard and chewy. But my family asked me to make them again. Which I will for them.

My 14 year old son declared these better than store bought.  He LOVES them.   I sprayed the tortillas with olive oil cooking spray and lightly salted them before cutting a whole stack at once into fourths with a large knife.  Very quick and easy.  Much healthier than store bought.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These turned out great.  I found they cooked best for 10 minutes total.  I turned the pan - not the chips at 5 mins through.
I used tomato tortillas, and brushed them with olive oil - and then sprinkled them with a mixture of Clubhouse Garlic Plus, Paprika, and Parm Cheese.
Excellent!

I used the large flour tortillas (dinner plate size) and cut into eighths, then cut each eighth into fourths. Each large tortilla will make 32 chips. The chips are smaller and easier for little hands to pick up. I then placed chips on a baking stone (to prevent burning), sprayed each chip with some plain cooking spray (you could use butter or garlic flavor also), and sprinkled each with a little sea salt. I baked them at 7 minutes then rotated the stone 1/2 turn (or turn stone a full 180 degrees for even baking) and cooked them for another 6 minutes. I then removed the stone carefully from the oven with oven mitts or pads (it will be extremely hot to the touch) and then removed them from the stone with an upside down metal spatula (I do this to help prevent sticking to the stone) and placed them on a large cool metal baking tray to cool.  They turned out fantastic. They can be eaten alone (kids love them), with dips or made into nacho chips.

They were ok but not what I expected after reading the recipe and some of the reviews. Only the ones that were quite brown turned out crunchy.. the others were pretty chewy. I also don't think they had enough flavor. I packed them with fresh guacamole and it worked well enough but definitely not all great

Great! I only had flour tortillas on hand and my first batch initially burned- the different tortillas must need different times and temps. For flour tortillas I baked them for about 6 minutes at about 300F and they turned out much better. I will try with corn tortillas next time, thank you!

These have a great flavor. I had a hard time getting them cooked just right, I kept pulling them out and thinking they were done, but they were still chewy.  I had to cook a bit longer than 15 minutes total.

These were great!  I used flour tortillas instead of corn and I used a pizza roller to cut out the wedges.  I also used olive oil instead of veg oil and applied it with a pastry brush.  I didn't have lime juice to use and it still came out great.  I followed the ingredients for spices/proportions exact, as well as the baking instructions.

From reading the reviews, it seemed that the chips took varying times to complete so I tested two chips for a few rounds and found that about 6.5 minutes was enough for the tortillas that I had. I decided to just put olive oil on them rather than misting as I didn't have a mister. Also, I didn't wait until they looked brown because by the time I got them out of the oven and off the pan, they would be too cooked and taste a little burnt.

I enjoyed the way they came out.  The one problem I had was all the flavor was on the top of the chip.  What I did to help alleviate that minor problem for me was as I brushed the oil/juice mixture on each tortilla (I gotta get a mister), I stacked them on top of the last.  I also use a cleaver to cut the entire stack of tortillas.  It helped solve that problem for me.  Another thing I'm going to do is put my seasoning mix in a resealable bowl, and after I spray the tortilla wedges, put them in the bowl with the spices and shake (after covering of course), to season them.  My kids love these, my mom loves them, and its pretty simple to make. Awesome!

This gets a five for the idea. I found very thin corn tortillas, Perez is the brand available in my store. I cut up batches of 5 tortillas at a time into 6 triangles per tortilla. I laid them out on a baking sheet covered with foil. Then I sprayed them all with cooking spray, flipped and sprayed again. I sprinkled salt on and cooked them for 4 minutes at 400 degrees (my oven runs a bit hot). They came out wonderfully light and crisp. I've tried many times with the thicker white corn tortillas and they go from raw to burnt in no time. I'm sticking with the very thin ones for sure! Thanks for the base recipe.

I thought these were okay, they didn't have the 'yum' factor I was hoping for based on the reviews. However, my boyfriend gobbled them up, so I'll give it 4 stars.  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and only cooked for about 3 minutes, then rotated the baking sheets, cooking for 2 more minutes or so. Maybe my gas oven cooks a lot faster, the given cooking times were WAY too long. I made one batch using a star cookie cutter, thinking it would be cute... fyi, tortillas do not cut out easily! A pizza cutter does make quick work of cutting them otherwise. :)

for those who like to watch their oil/fat intake, these are great...with your first batch, check often towards the end of the recommended baking time so that you get them to the crispness that suits you and your oven...kept in an airtight bag, these were still good the next day...

This recipe turned out great-- very crispy.  I have tried similar recipes in the past with a much higher baking temp and the insides of the chips were tough and chewy.  I, like many others, used a basting brush to add olive oil instead of a mister.  After 8 minutes I flipped the chips with tongs and cooked another 7.  Perfect!

Made these for a party and they were good.  Didn't have the lime juice, but really look forward to adding that next time. Used olive oil.  We don't use a lot of salt in our family, but I did feel the spice mix could have use a little more salt.  I was doing a lot of tortillas and ran out of the spice, so the last couple batches had season salt, which was nice too if you are in a hurry or find yourself missing spices.  Would be fun to mix it up if you wanted to make them to go with an artichoke dip - try Italian seasonings and some Parmesan cheese!  Maybe some middle eastern spices for Hummus!

A baking spray (such as Pam with canola oil) works just as well as basting with the oil/lime juice mixture.  I baked for 7 minutes, rotated the cookie sheet, and baked for 5 minutes more.  The chips were crisp, golden brown, and delicious!  My husband loves these and they are always a hit at any party.

We like them, I did not use oil. I sprayed them with non-stick cooking spray and then sprinkled the rest of the dry spices on, rubbed the spices around to evenly coat and then squirted them with lime juice.

Easy and yummy! Fun to make your own chips. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of veg oil and they were perfect.

Wow - I was terribly impressed!  I used corn shells, only ended up with half the lime juice, used a brush to coat each shell, then cut ... and I was pretty skimpy on the spices - but pleasantly surprised.  I wanted something *thicker* that would hold up to Spanish Rice and this was perfect.  Thank you!

Warning: these are addictive! Make sure you keep a close eye on them in the oven so they don't get too crispy. I did these with flour tortillas and brushed them with olive oil. Paired with hummus, you can't go wrong!

i tried this, but ive also made a more simple version using just extra virgin olive oil and kosher salt which much easier and cheaper, and also taste just as good.

I thought these were great. For a fat and salt free option (as I'm on a very restrictive diet) I laid the chips in a single layer on the cookie sheet and then sprayed with fat free cooking spray, dripped with lime (the more the better for me!) and sprinkled on salt substitute and chili powder. I omitted the cumin. I baked them at 350 watching them CLOSELY. For me they only took about 10 minutes tops. I rotated after 5 minutes. They are wonderful. I can't stop eating them!

I really enjoy this technique of making chips.  Much healthier than fried chips.  I didn't use those spices though, just the salt.  Had em with salsa, was great, thanks a lot.

I'm only giving this three stars because it was just too spicy for our tastes. However, the concept is wonderful. I made a second batch and left out the spices and lime. We all loved them plain. But we also prefer our store bought chips plain, too. So, my suggestion is if you don't care for seasoned chips, just leave out the seasonings and lime and you won't be disappointed.

These were so good!  Instead of the veggie oil, I used canola oil based cooking spray and I also upped the amounts of cumin and chili powder.  Loved the tang the lime juice brought.  Cooked mine for 20 minutes at 375 and they were crispy yet chewy - perfectly perfect (and for those who complained about them being too chewy, let them sit for a bit - eating them the day after allows them to become totally crunchy and delicious).  This will be my new snack - thank you very much for that!

These were ok. The taste was pretty good - I wish I'd added some garlic powder though - but they didn't get particularly cripsy. I think I'll combine this recipe with Garlic Pita Bread Bites; I think that would be a winner.

Incredibly easy recipe for savory chips. I have also made tortilla chips, using melted butter and then sugar-cinnamon for a sweet treat. Here is a TIP:  Handling all those wedges is so time-consuming. Try brushing the wet mixture over the tortillas with a pastry brush BEFORE cutting into wedges --- so much easier!!

Love these! I make them all the time for a healthy answer to a crunch attack, although I use avocado oil. Usually I just bake flour or whole wheat tortillas with nothing on them except a bit of avocado oil and a hint of sea salt.

This was a very good and fast recipe. I used an additional tablespoon of lime juice and also used olive oil. I basted the chips with a pastry brush because I didn't have mister in the house.  I also cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  I am thinking that the person who burnt their chips did not use enough oil and lime juice.  I served with some fresh guacamole, it was excellent!  It does indeed satisfy the salty, crunchy cravings.

These were awesome!! So much cheaper and healthier to make these too. Not to mention you can make so many different kinds of flavors :o) I had to leave them in the oven longer...just until the chips started to get crisp through-out. I made these for a superbowl party with artichoke dip. It was a big hit. My mother loves them and is wanting to make a brown sugar cinnamon flavor...that should be quite tasty!

Just tried these. I read all the comments first and here is what I did. I brushed olive oil only (had no lime juice) on each flour tortilla and stacked them. I cut them into quarters and put them in a plastic bag. I used sea salt only as a seasoning to see what they tasted like plain, and shook them up. I arranged them on a baking sheet, sprayed with non stick spray, in a single layer not touching each other (made 2 batches). I baked them for 7 minutes at 350 and turned over when they just began to brown. I watched carefully and baked until the other side began to just turn brown (about 5 minutes more in my hot oven). Let cool.I used them with my homemade bean salsa and I really liked them. Stored in a plastic bag. I am going to try some with the seasonings suggested too!

These were great.  I misted with olive oil, then salted.  Using kitchen shears I cut each tortilla into 6 wedges before baking.  Served with enchalata soup.

Excellent! We tried dipping in oil when we didn't have a sprayer, not so good. Spraying is definitely necessary! We prefer these chips to the ones from the store, by far, and they're cheaper.

I used flour tortillas, but I would imagine corn tortillas would be better since when you buy tortilla chips they're made from corn :) Using the flour kind they come out a little dry, so plan on using them for nachos or something similar.

I used flour tortillas instead of corn because that's what  I had on hand.  These were a great way to use up leftover tortillas, and I like the recipe because I'm able to make only as much as I need for one person - no more buying a whole bag of chips and letting half of them get stale.  I found the cooking time on the recipe was way too long though; mine were done in 5-6 minutes, and I can't imagine that corn tortillas would take any longer than that either.  I also found it's easier to put the oil and seasonings on the tortillas before you cut them up, not after.

Very delicious, may need to add a bit more salt once cooled off, and finished cooking.  Make sure NOT to over cook! :)  Great for a quick easy snack.

I make these all the time but I like using white corn and yellow corn tortillas. I do not add the lime juice or spices just the oil and salt. I serve with Bobby Flay's Charred Corn Guacamole on the Food Network website. Always a hit when we have Tex Mex/Margarita night out by the pool with friends.

These are a good solution to the issue of not having tortilla chips in the house and needing some chips.  The problem I have is not with the recipe but with the nature of the corn tortillas...you wait and wait for them to cook and they can burn so quickly.  So keep a watch on them!

This is my 2nd time making these. The first time I used thinly sliced day-old bagels and got a terribly burned result, so I didn't rate it, figuring it was my fault. This time I used tortillas. I rotated at 6 minutes, and checked them again at 6 minutes. One pan looks more or less ok, a bit dark, but the other pan is definitely burnt. The cooking time is far enough off on these that the recipe NEEDS you to read the negative reviews in order to make it successfully. In my book that's not a good recipe. 2 stars, because one pan is more or less edible. (The pan that's edible is the bag of torts I was keeping in the fridge. The ones that burned were the ones being stored at room temperature.)

Very nice! You don't have to use a mister, a marinating brush worked well (although it would be faster than the brush). Here's a cracker tip: the chips will crisp up if you let them sit in a heat-proof container above the oven vent, uncovered. Don't eat them hot right out of the oven...store bought tortillas are not thin enough for that.

I used flour tortillas and the chips were delicate and delicious.  I wasn't sure how much of the spice the chips could take, so I went a little too light.  Next time, I'll be more generous with my sprinkling.

These were FANTASTIC!!!!!  Really easy to make.  Sprayed the cookie sheet and then the tortillas with olive oil.  Used my basting brush to put the lime juice on the tortillas.  Then sprinkled kosher salt and some chili pepper over the tortillas.  Baked at 325 (since some people were saying they had burnt chips) for 15 minutes.  A few of the chips came out chewy but the majority had a nice crunch to them.  Will definitely be making these  again.

I didn't like these. Followed the recipe exactly and somehow they came out chewy and hard at the same time. The spices were good though.

This chips had a good taste but were a little too hard. I think next time I will try without the oil to see if that helps. I omitted the chili powder and ground cumin but added everything else.

Very nice technique.  I didn't have lime juice, so I added "True Lime" to the dry seasonings (a powdered lime in tiny packets).

I used this recipe as I guide.  I only had flour tortilla's, so that is what I used.  We did two batches of these.  One with cinnamon and sugar and the next only with salt as seasoning.  They turned out great. My DH prefered these to the store bought.

It was a terrible situation: Fresh from the farmer's market avocadoes and limes in a creamy guac. But, no chips!
This recipe to the rescue! Brushed oil on with a pastry brush, sprinkled w/ coarse salt and cumin. Kept an eye on them in the oven.  These are thick and hearty, like the chips I've had in Mexico. Better than the store.

These came out really well. I followed the recipe exactly, except for mixing the oil and lime juice in a bowl and applying it with a pastry brush. Also used Kosher salt. I'll make these again, because it's a nice way to use up tortillas.

These were great. I love that they are healthier than store bought chips. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and lemon juice for the lime juice. No other spices as the salsa we have is spicy enough. Will definitely make again

The times in the recipe didn't work for me. My first batch burned because I trusted the timer. All other batches were wonderful though--I think I baked them for a total of around 10-12 minutes per batch, but I'm not positive. I also used lemon juice rather than lime (time crunch and I had a bottle of lemon juice, much easier than juicing the lime). They were absolutely delicious! Next time though, instead of trying to serve them fresh, I'll make them ahead of time and put them in the oven for a few minutes to warm them up.

Maybe my review is a bit skewed but I thought these were extremely salty.  I did change a few things based on what I had on hand.  I used flour tortillas and cumin seed instead of cumin powder.  Perhaps that's what made it saltier?  I did like the crispiness but can't eat them because of the amount of salt.  Will try again with less salt and ground cumin.  The flour tortillas worked out, however...took about 11 minutes in the oven.

I hate reviewers who bastardize recipes then rate it. That said, that is why I don't usually rate recipes as I am an experienced cook but I feel compelled to rate this one as it gave me very helpful guidelines. I I found myself at home with pouring rain outside and reluctant to go to the store. I decided to raid my freezer and make "Carne en su Jugo" which is a Mexican beef-bacon-bean soup/stew-ish preparation but needs "toppings". Decidedly it needs a crunch factor - had radishes on hand - but eh, not quite good enough, then realized I had some aging  carb balance flour tortillas on hand so the reasonable thing is to make tortilla strips which I have never had the pleasure of making. Well, every other other recipe calls for CORN tortillas and the few that do mention flour don't specifically say low-carb can substitute. So off I went to experiment and so glad I did and here's what I did:
8 " Mission Carb Balance flour tortillas cut into half with pizza cutter then into 1/2" strips
Tossed with canola oil then lightly tossed with seasoning
(I used home prepared Emeril's Southwest Seasoning)
Single layer on non-stick cookie sheet - do not crowd
375 degree oven
5-7 minutes until light golden brown - did not turn, stir, shake or toss
Removed from cookie sheet with spatula to cool on paper towels

They are fragile but ohhhhh so good.

Although I liked the recipe, I found the technique to be unnecessarily labor intensive.  I added all the ingredients (except the tortillas) to a bowl and whisked well.  I then brushed them on whole tortillas (I used the smaller ones) lightly with a silicone basting brush on both sides stacking each one as I went.  I then cut the whole pile in quarters and baked.  SO much easier and the spices are more evenly distributed on the chip.   Be sure to remix with the basting brush each time you brush to avoid separation of ingredients.  Three stars for poor technique.

These turned out perfectly crisp (I baked them for a minute less on each side, btw) and my family couldn't get enough- I will definitely make these again. I made 6 batches and put the chips into a large container. We would have paid quadruple for the same amount of less healthy, store-bought chips.

Wonderful recipe.  I don't have a mister so I just combine the oil and lime in a bowl and brush onto the whole tortillas. I cut them and place them on a cookie sheet in a single layer then sprinkle with kosher salt.  The whole family enjoys them.

While the flavor of these was good, the texture wasn't right - too chewy.  I wonder if maybe I put too much juice on them, because I just squeezed it on rather than putting it in a "mister," which I don't have.  Would not probably try these again.

I don't know why I waited so long to try this recipe.  In this house, we prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas, so that's what I used.  Watch your time baking, mine were done (some a little too brown)  at 11 minutes.  There's a short window between getting them crisp (not soggy), but not burnt.  I always have flour tortillas in the house, so I'll probably just keep a small spray bottle of the oil-lime juice mixture on hand, as I think I'll be making these chips often.  These tortilla chips are just so much better than what you buy at the supermarket in a bag.

I just made these in my Toaster Oven.. I didn't want to turn on my Oven.. its way to hot.. and the first batch.. turned out kinda chewy.. but then I actually forgot to turn them over and forgot to leave them in 6 more minutes.. The second batch turned out great.. and the third was even better.. I will be using this recipe from now on...

These were tasty. I over cooked just a teensy bit and didn't have lime. Would have been awesome if I followed the directions. So rating as such.

Love, love, loved them! I am on a gluten free diet so I used brown rice tortillas instead of corn tortillas and they came out awesome. I would recommend cooking them for a shorter time though; 5 minutes on each side.

I am literally in the process of making my second batch of these! These are so perfect. My husband loves them. I followed a suggestion I read within the reviews and sprayed Pam instead of oil. I also had to cook mine a little longer than the suggested time in order for them to be crispy. We will be having this again! Thanks.

LOVE that this is such an easy way to make chips!  We enjoy salsa and other dips, like hummus, at our house and this is the perfect chip for those!  It's great that we can enjoy these with so little prep time and effort.

Delicious. Even though I burnt my chips to an almost crisp (my guinea pig was calling me from the living room), They were great. The seasoning is awesome. I used olive oil instead.

I LOVED these! I used some flour and some corn tortillas instead, the flour tortillas were crunchier. I also cut them into strips instead. I made guacamole to go along with it as well. I loved these and will be making them again.

These are fantastic, especially since chips are getting so expensive. To prevent burnt spots, I reduced the temperature to 325F, and watched them. I also used garlic powder, and onion powder with salt instead of the chili and cumin. Using a mister, I was able to get more tortillas sprayed than the recipe called for.

I found that these needed WAY longer than 8 minutes per side in order to get crispy. Even after and extra 10 minutes some of them were slightly chewy. Next time I'll bump the oven temp up to try to cut down on the baking time.

We used tortillas from another homemade tortilla recipe (whole wheat flour tortillas) and didn't have cumin on hand.  Instead, we used olive oil (dipped it into it, spray-on would probably be better), cayenne pepper and salt.    DEFINITELY need to watch the time on this one, because you don't need to put it in for 15 minutes like one poster said.  I would say 7 minutes, perhaps 3 on one side and 4 on another.    DELICIOUS.

So good! I followed the recipe for the most part; I left out the salt because my dad is on a low-salt diet.  I don't even think these need salt at all, they are flavorful and they do crisp up nicely (for a chip that's baked, anyway).  I think next time I'll try using PAM, but believe me I'll be making this a lot.  Thank so much for this recipe!

Good basic recipe. Used flour tortillas because it was all I had on hand, also omitted oil and sprayed tortillas with Pam before adding spices and lime juice.

LOVE this!  I have searched and searched for an actual crispy yet tasty corn tortilla chip recipe that is baked.  This is perfect.  I omitted the chili powder and just used the cumin and salt and I added a pinch of adobo seasoning.  I also did not have lime juice so I used lemon, but it was still yummy!!  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a really good idea! I had some tortillas that I needed to use up and I just sprayed them with olive oil flavoured cooking spray and sprinkled on lime juice, cumin, chili powder and salt. They were really good and much healthier than normal tortilla chips! Thanks for the recipe :)

These are so versatile and so very easy.  Like some other reviewers the 1st time around I brushed on the oil/lime, but I have now bought a mister, and what a change it made.  Invest in one, it makes the prep so much easier and faster.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really delicious, although I chose the lazy man's version of this recipe...cut flour tortillas into chip shapes, sprayed a cookie sheet with olive oil cooking spray, laid the chips out, sprayed the chips lightly with the cooking spray, and then dusted them with chili powder and salt (didn't have any cumin!).  Mine averaged 7-10 minutes at 375 but had to keep a close eye on them.  Much much better than store brand chips!

The only drawback was not having enough baking sheets to make a big batch all at once.  They went fast.

These are wonderful.  So easy to make and even impressed by 14 year old who will not normally eat chips!  I used flour tortillas, cut them with a pizza wheel, sprayed with Pam and squeezed a little lime juice all over before adding the spices.  Thank you for sharing, will certainly be making these again.

I took this recipe and kind of made it easier by doing as follows: First I only had flour tortillas, I used a pizza cutter to make 8 slices. I then placed these on a cookie sheet, sprayed with Pam and then salted. Baked for 7 mins, turned over sprayed reversed side with Pam and salted. Let bake 3 more mins and these were done. I had guacamole that I wanted to take with lunch with me and was looking for something healthier than what I had, and this was it. Thanks for sharing!

Guess it's "different strokes for different folks" concerning these chips.  I made then once and my DH said:  "Doritos don't have to worry about you encroaching on their territory"!  I would have to agree.  They may well be more healthful but there's no comparison with REAL tortilla chips.

Great! I did it exactly the way the recipe said and they turned out perfectly. The only difference - I used smaller tortillas and olive oil instead of veggie oil. I can't wait to experiment with different seasonings and oils!

Not really sure what happened to my first batch, but they got a little dark. I only baked them for 7-8 minutes one time (didn't rotate and bake again) and they turned out great. Very delicious!!!

A nice, easy break from bagged chips.  I tried it with both flour and corn tortillas and corn is MUCH better.

I tried these and thought they came out a little too crispy. I used Safflower oil instead and also brished the chips with it and the lime juice. My first batch were extra extra crispy, I think I may have put too much of the oil/lime mixture on them. I tried using less on the second bacth and only used sea salt for taste and a smidge of the cumin/chili poweder mixture and liked the taste better. Next time I will try to leave them in for only 8 or 9 minutes.

I love these.  I'm a chip & Salsa lover and these are a great alternative to store bought chips that have so many calories & fat.  To make them healthier, I didn't use any oil.  I just sprayed them with lime juice.  I also sprayed some with PAM Olive Oil spray.

I was skeptical...I've done this with flour torts but tried it with corn...Can you say crispy?!  They were super good - I just sprayed with hot pepper olive oil spray (clearance shelf at wally world) and sea salt.  I would never have tried this with corn torts and I thank you!!

These were delicious. Our grocery store was out of corn tortillas, so I used wheat, and they were still great. Can't wait to try with corn. I didn't need to bake them as long as the recipe stated, but maybe that's because I didn't use corn tortillas. Anyway, keep an eye on them so they don't burn. Thanks for the recipe.

These are super easy and yummy.  I love that you can add whatever seasoning you want and you know exactly what's in them.  Great for those of us watching our figures!  I use low-carb tortillas and they work great!

Loved these! I like mine a bit chewy so I cooked them 6 min turned them over & another 6 minutes. Couldn't get my mister to work so I kind of flicked it on. Ancho chili powder is my new fav! No salt, so so good! Much more economical that buying bags of tostitos! Update - I made them again just spraying with Pam & sprinkling my homemade hot salt. Even better!

These were amazing.  R said that these were the best tortillas he had ever eaten.  I used Ancient Grain Tortillas (basically a multigrain that had seeds in it).  I sprayed them with  pam, and then sprinkled salt on them.  WATCH them carefully in those last minutes as they will burn VERY quickly!

I loved these baked chips paired with Pico De Gallo.  I'm currently doing weight watchers and these two make a very tasty, very low point snack!

I've tried these with corn (which I prefer to use in all mexican dishes), but must confess the flour tortillas baked up the best and had the right crispness you would expect in a "chip".  I cut them into triangles and spray with canola cooking spray.  I then sprinkle kosher salt, chili powder and little bit of pepper on them and bake at 350 for about 8-10 mins. They crisp up they've a cooled a min or two, if you can wait that long!  My family loves these better than store bought chips and they're healthier too!!

I tired this recipe with cut up corn tortilla squares.  The individual squares sometimes clump together while baking, but they're small to begin with so it didn't matter.  Instaed of a mister, which I don't own, I put the oil in a palstic container, then added the tortillas and shook the container all round to coat.  Then I dredged the chips in a paper bag with the spices and then baked them on a cookie sheet.  Turned out just fine.  I'm going to try the next batch with olive oil, as used in another review.

OK...to start with, I didn't have corn tortillas, I had flour but I tried the recipe anyway.  Just couldn't bring myself to throw out a package that had been in the fridge for a few weeks.  At first, I didn't like the way they came out, but after a couple of days they got better!  A little dry, but great with guacamole or nacho dip!  Nice and sturdy.  My husband bought me corn tortilla's...think he is giving me a hint to try it the right way next time?  I will use corn tortilla's next time and I'm sure they will be better, though these weren't bad.  I'll re-review when I use the corn tortilla's.  hint...If you are going to use flour tortilla's, be sure to coat them really well with the oil as they soak it up pretty fast.

We usually get the bagged kind, but these worked in a pinch!  My boyfriend liked them a lot.  Used them for a crab dip at first.  Had to bake longer than indicated at 350 degrees.  My oven produced them well the second time around at 375 degrees at btw. 9-10 mins.  Nice and crispy.

Taste pretty good but the time needs to be adjusted on the recipe. I cooked them for half the time and they came out a little more crispy than I prefer.

I tried these this weekend.  They were great.  I made those for myself since I try to watch what I eat and bought chips for my husband and daughter. They liked mine better.  I made mine with the low carb whole wheat tortillas and was very pleased.

Wow-I had no idea how easy these are to make at home. They came out crisp and fortunately I didn't have any trouble with burning them like other reviewers mentioned. I ended up making several batches using garlic salt as well. We ate them with guacamole and salsa and also in a tortilla soup the next day.

These were okay. I did not have cumin, and so did not use it. That may have made a huge difference in taste, I'm not sure (I'm not really familiar with cumin). The baking times varied with each batch, but that was probably due to my oven more than anything else. I do not prefer these to store-bought chips, but they were okay.

Followed directions exactly for baking.  I mixed all ingredients together and used a brush on tortillas then cut them - flour tortillas worked best for nice and crispy!

Thought these very good. I baked at 375 for approximately 13 minutes. I didn’t turn.  I seasoned them with salt and taco seasonings which has the cumin and chili powder in it. I then sprayed them with cooking spray.  They turned out crispy, not burned.  Good flavor. Might try this for tostadas as I don’t like frying.

Didn’t have tortilla chips for taco night. Had some flour tortillas on hand. These were so yummy. Didn’t have a spritzer so used olive oil Pam spray as another reviewer had recommended. Yum yum!

I made it with only spritzing olive oil, and I used gluten free tortillas.

The hubby and I loved these! I was in the middle of making asada tacos and realized we did not have chips. Looked this up and did it! Pretty quick, few ingredients and can easily be altered to your liking.  We didnt do the full time baking because the notes even say dont let it get to brown. Every person's oven is different so if it's your first time making them check the last 4 mins to see how they are doing.  

Also I used a basting brush to moist the chips not what the author stated to use.

These were so delicious! I used Pam olive oil cooking spray to very lightly coat them with oil, and I only seasoned them with sea salt a pepper because the dip I was using them for was very flavorful, and a bit spicy. Next time I will try them with all of the recommended spices. The chips are sooo good! They held up so well in the dip, and it was a bit of a heavier dip to pick up. I got constant compliments on how delicious they were. They were so easy to make too! Bye bye bagged tortilla chips!

Really flaky and flavorful. Will make again! I actually prefer these over standard tortilla chips. Didn't have a spare mister, so I tried my best to splatter it with a fork.

Made these chips to accompany some home made hummus. With some spicing up they were Awesome! I used flour tortillas & after lightly spraying with cooking spray, I added minced garlic, chili powder, cumin & cajun seasonings on both sides. My (picky) husband now wonders why we ever bought store bought chips! Thanks for posting this recipe! It's wonderful.

After accidentally purchasing white corn tortillas instead of flour, I found this recipe. It is SO easy and I have made it several times. I ONLY use the lime juice and canola oil mister. I did not add the other seasonings, other than salt. They are SO good!!! I almost prefer them to store-bought tostadas! Easy peasy!

These were fabulous! I cut them into wedges and dipped them in olive oil, as another reviewer suggested, sprinkled them with onion powder and chili powder and baked them for 12 minutes (turning the pan halfway through). Delicious! However, if you have to watch your sodium, like I do, the 6 inch Mission tortillas that I used have 260mg of sodium each (which makes 8 chips) but the Late July Chia and Quinoa chips I buy have only 65mg in 10 chips. Bug difference. Just an FYI. But still a great recipe.

I spray the entire torrilla first then stack them to cut into wedges. Much easier that way. 
I go to 375° on convection bake for shorter time.  Suggest you check frequently because it can go from baked to burnt in a hurry.

Yes, I made a change.
  I didn't put anything on it. I just cut them up in tortilla pieces and put them on aluminum foil. Put them in the oven,  at 350 degrees and cook them for 7  minutes on one side and 8 minutes on the other side and they came out perfect. 
Thank you very much, perfect.  ;)

I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used leftover flour tortillas. I also didn’t bake mine quite as long since our oven tends to be a little hotter than most. It was fast and easy to make.

These turned out very good.  Crispy and great flavor.  We used a Breville Toaster Convection Oven, 300 Degrees 8 minutes a side. The only problem was getting the family to not eat them all up as soon as they came out of the oven.

I don't have a mister, so I just used pan spray on the tortilla chips and squeezed a few lime wedges freely over the tortillas in the pan.  Everything else I followed to direction.  They came out crispy and resilient when eaten with a heavy chicken dip.

I will never throw away extra corn tortillas again!  Very easy, very good.  I put each tortilla (whole) on a plate and used my silicone basting brush to brush each side, then sprinkled one side with seasoning.  I then cut them into wedges and put on the pan.  With that method, I had MUCH too much lime juice/oil, and needed only 1/4 - 1/2 as much.  The measurements are easy to adjust, however, including the seasoning.   I flipped the chips after 7 minutes before final bake. The chips are more dense and a little harder than store-bought, and remind me more of our local Mexican  restaurant chips.

Good! I used someone else's suggestion and brushed on oil, then cut the tortillas. I also added the seasonings to the oil as I thought that would be applied more evenly.  I used part of a leftover package of Chili seasoning...very much the same. Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut my tortillas in to six pieces and ended up baking a little longer.  At 15 minutes total, mine were not quite crispy enough.  Overall, very good.

Watch the video! The recipe just says to turn tray after 8 minutes or so, but video says to flip chips and season other side and then finish baking .

I made these using flour tortillas. I also sprinkled in Cayenne pepper.
I mixed vegetable oil and the spices together. I tried dipping it into the mixture, turned out well. I tried to spread the mixture with a spoon, that worked well. I tried spreading oil on them with a spoon and then putting on the spice mixture, they had a slightly weird taste to them.

Dipping them in the mixture took the least amount of time. I'm going to experiment more next time with different spices. I liked the flavor, I really did. But I didn't love it.

Such an easy, great recipe. A little too salty for my taste..next time I’ll reduce the salt and increase cumin (which I love!)
I don’t eat much salt so adjust to your taste YUM!

Followed the recipe exactly and these turned out great! I cut the corn tortillas int wedges using a pizza cutter. Then placed on Granite Ware cookie sheets, which browned them slightly on both sides without the need to turn them over. Mixed the olive oil and lime juice in a mister and sprayed the wedges lightly. Mixed the spices in an Oxo Good Grips Baker’s Wand (the amount just fit) and used that to get a nice even sprinkling over the tops. Baking times as stated in the recipe worked perfectly in my electric oven (middle rack). Served with queso dip (okay, it was Velveeta and Rotel heated together). Husband and kids kept coming back for more!

We used flour tortillas, and we didn’t have a mister, so we just drizzled vegetable oil over them and rubbed it in with a spoon :) Also only used salt, as we found that comino (cumin) & chili pepper just didn’t sprinkle on and cook very well :/ The best way we’ve found to cook them is to put them in for 8 minutes, then turn and cook for another 2. Makes them perfectly every time!

I didn't have lime juice so substituted it for water. I baked for 7 minutes, rotated pan then 5 more minutes. Nice and crunchy!

I followed this recipe, except they were only in the oven at 350 for 7 minutes and they came out disgusting and burnt. This recipe calls for it to be in there for 15 minutes. I would not recommend it to anyone.

Super tasty and easy to make! I mixed the oil and lime juice in a bowl, then brushed the corn tortillas with a pastry brush dipped in the oil mixture. I made these "Halloween" themed by cutting them into bats and moons and serving them with salsa in a skeleton hand bowl! So cute!

I was surprised how well they turned out, crispy and delicious, but I will definitely cut back on the spices next time, maybe just salt and cumin.  Economical and healthier than store bought and fun to make!

These might be okay if made with flour tortillas, but the corn ones ended up too hard.  We didn't care for the taste of the spices either.

I tried this recipe as is but cooking them for 7 minutes per side burned them. I tried the next batch 6 minutes per side but after 5 minutes per side, they were starting to burn again so took them out of the oven. They were not too burned but were not crispy enough, kind of chewy. How do I get them crispy without burning them?

Yes, finally something worthwhile to do with leftover tortillas.
The first time I made these I did not follow the ingredients, I used lemon juice and taco seasoning. 
The second time I followed the ingredients, but cut into strips to go with salad. Both times, DELISH!
Time saver, mix all ingredients together, brush on both sides of the tortilla, then cut and bake.

Great recipe ! Crunchy and chewy; nice corn flavor. Just brush on canola and sprinkle with a bit of sea salt.  Cut into wedges , bake 6 minutes, turn pan around and baked another 4-5 mins. Watch so they don't burn.  Occasionally I will flip the wedges over, if I'm not lazy! They seem a bit crunchier when I do that!

I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and reduced the lime juice to 2 tbsp.  Bushed it on with a pastry brush then sprinkled the spices on with my fingers.  In my oven, it took 15 minutes to bake until crispy.  They turned out really good!

I had to cook it for about nine minutes for one tray in the oven at a time. The chips were absolutely amazing! My family loved that it wasn't spicy but still had great flavor to it.

yes, i'll do this again.  first, i used organic corn tortilla chips, they may've made a small difference but they taste great & i know i'm not eating gmo's or pesticides so that's always a nice addition to a treat.  next time i mightn't use oil but dry saute them as they were slightly oily.  i love the suggestion of staking & cutting them.  i did this after brushing them with oil.  i added a few more herbs b/c i like things a little hot.  most of all i loved having a treat without a pile of unpronounceable chemicals & a zillion other toxins.  they tasted great, we had them with little ramekins of sour cream, cilantro, salsa & guacamole.  dh says it's a repeat.  thank you.

I would add pepper in addition to these flavors. 

On top of the chips i made being super healthy  they were yummy AF. I  added a shredded chicken ranch bacon topping to the  chip and my whole family enjoyed.

This was great!  I used the exact ingredients listed.  My mister kept clogging up, probably from itty bitty pieces of pulp from the lime juice, so I basted both sides of the tortillas (whole) generously on both sides with the oil and lime mixture.  I baked at 350 for 15 minutes - they didn't need to be turned.  Will make again.

These are surprisingly good. I just used a little chipotle chili powder and salt. I didn't have a spray bottle so I just brushed on the olive oil, sprinkled on the chili powder and salt and baked. Easily better than store bought.

These are awesome - so much better than store bought I'll never buy tortilla chips again!  First time I made just as recipe says - after that I decided to leave out the lemon juice and use slightly less chili powder.  Last time I tried to divide them into  2 sheet pans,and for the first time ever they were soggy, even after extra time in the oven, so I probably won't try that again.  They last at least overnight in a plastic bag (we never had any leftovers longer than that).  Excellent - company worthy and easy to make ahead too!

Love love love these!  After reading reviews changed only slightly for convenience. Mixed olive oil, lime juice and all seasoning plus salt together and then brushed mixture on entire corn tortillas , stacked them and sliced. Saved so much time! Lined a pan with foil and cooked for 7 minutes and then turned pan as direct and cooked another 7 until browned. They were delicious and healthy!!! Will make again.

These are the best! I added a 1/4tsp garlic powder. The thinner "spinach & herbs"  and 1/2 wheat 1/2 corn tortillas were thinner and worked better. Really liked the mist step and seasonings added! Just get them crisp!

Nice, easy snack.  I've made these many times, and it works well with any type of tortilla - just adjust the time for the type of tortilla, watch carefully and rotate the sheet so you don't burn them.  I don't usually do the lime juice, just use whatever I have on hand, and i use olive oil.

These are delish and SO easy! My modifications: I used the Pam coconut oil cooking spray and just sprayed the tortillas lightly. Then, I put a heavy amount of salt and a little cumin. For one batch, I added chili powder and they were great, but my salsa is pretty hot so I left it off after that. I skipped the lime/lemon. Super crispy and awesome.

I am addicted to tortilla chips and this way of making them at home is so much healthier and tastier!  I followed the recipe but baked them a little longer (could be my oven) and they were perfect!

disappointed in "taste" spices. Rather bland and "in a mister" sure, where do I get one?  It's a special order item that doesn't take into account the average household. 

I had to order one on line, waste of money.  It kept clogging and was VERY difficult to clean.  I ended up dipping fingers and sprinkling.

I used flour tortillas instead of corn and lemon juice instead of lime because I was anxious to try these and didn't have all ingredients.  Will make again but this time just like the recipe.  I baked them as stated for 7 minutes then turned them over and sprayed and sprinkled again.  This time I only had to bake for 3 minutes; they were nice and brown.  They were a bit dry but I expected that since they were baked, not fried.  The guacamole or salsa takes care of that though.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!

We bought a very large package of corn tortillas and decided to try these baked chips.  Good choice!  I used kitchen scissors to cut them in half, and then quarters, and placed them in a single layer on TWO cookie sheets.  I decided to make it REALLY simple and just sprayed the quartered tortillas with cooking spray.   I then placed one sheet on the top oven shelf and the second on a lower shelf.  I started cooking for 5 minutes, then checked them every 3 minutes.  However, I NEVER turned the chips.  (I also must have a "cool" 350 oven, because the total time for the top shelf was 17 minutes.)  When those top shelf chips were done, I took that cookie sheet out and moved the other cookie sheet up to replace it, then added an additional 5 minutes.  Wonderful corn chip flavor!
I will definitely make these again.

I just made plain chips. I sprayed my pan and the chips with baking spray and sprinkled with salt after cutting with a pizza cutter. One thing that is off is the baking time. I found that 9.5 to 10 minutes total bake time makes a crunchy lightly brown chip. And the smaller you cut the chips,the faster they brown.

Used whole wheat flour tortillas.  Brushed both sides with oil/lime/spice mixture and then cut.  Baked about 15 min, flipping in between.  Some tasted burnt, some never crisped and the flavor wasn't really apparent.  May try again with corn tortillas.

Simple to make and tastes great. I always think the store chips are way to salty so I like these a lot better because I get to control the amount of salt I use.

Super cheap and easy recipe. Don't be afraid to add a little more of the spice if eating on their own, but it's fine as is if meant for eating with hummus. Brushing them all can take some time. As for whether to cut into 1/4 or 1/8 of a tortilla, both work well. 1/4 might look better, for making for others, but I personally would do 1/8 for myself.

The recipe worked well. We weren't crazy about the flavor but that's our taste. I used flour tortillas and the cooking time was about 6 minutes per side. I.mixed  the olive oil and the spices together and brushed on as suggested by another reviewer. Turned out crispy and great for guacamole. When I make again I will use same procedure but use olive oil, salt and garlic, maybe Parmesan. Thanks for the process!

This is very good. I tried it with flour tortillas and they came out great. Better than bagged for two reasons: 1) They don't break like traditional corn tortilla chips. And 2) When you use them when making nachos,you don't need as many.They're thicker  and.... THEY DONT BREAK!!

I had to make a change or two because of my pantry, and while they are good, they crisp up too fast. If you don't watch them carefully, they come out burned. I have 2 dogs to wrangle and other dishes to make, so I can't spend the time watching them bake. But they are good.

Wow!  Thank you for this recipe!  The best part about this is that it's very customizable.  If you have a Misto sprayer, now is the time to use it.  I loaded up our Misto with canola oil, lightly spraying each chip, and sprinkled with salt.  We also tried these with Lawry's seasoned salt, and it was equally delicious.  Be very careful not to overcook these--they'll become bitter if too browned.

This was an awesome recipe! The only change I made was I also put garlic powder  and changed the temperature to 300 degrees. That allowed me to be able to control the browning more easily. My first batch burned faster than you can say' holy homemade Tortilla chips!!!

However I feel I will be buying more tortillas just to make them!!!

just made this recipe with a few changes. using 3 flour tortillas I did a little experimenting. with one I put olive oil and salt. another I did pam cooking spray with salt. the third I used olive oil with cinnamon sugar. baked for 7 minutes but didn't flip over. overall, my sister and I liked the cooking spray chips better but the cinnamon ones were delicious. perfectly crunchy but not dry, this was a great starter recipe that's simple to build upon.

I used olive oil cooking spray and sprinkled with a small amount of salt then cut into wedges. I baked for 7 minutes then flipped them and baked for another 5-7 minutes waiting for the edges to start browning.

Super easy and tasty! I only used salt on my chips to keep the flavor neutral as the guacamole I served them with had all the other spices included.

Low carb dieters can celebrate!  These are excellent.  Use low card flour tortillas and enjoy.  I made a batch with olive oil for a more healthy version.
EDIT:  I have continued to make these for my low-carb diet and still love them.  
NOTE:  for those who said they were soggy or dried out or did not taste good I recommend you use a different tortilla.  I tried a different low-carb tortilla than my regular brand and they were awful!  So, it is not the recipe, but the choice of tortilla...
Also, I did not have a mister so I sprayed with olive oil cooking spray and drizzled lime juice on them.  I only add salt for spices.  Perfect!

Perfect for getting rid of expiring tortillas.  Sprinkled cinnamon sugar mix on instead of salt/cumin/chilli for a dessert type snack.

Overall a good recipe.  I overbaked mine and it got a bit too crunchy too eat.  I definitely liked the spices though.  Gave it more flavor.

I made these using Pam spray with the spices, including a dusting of fresh ground pepper. They are simple and delicious. The texture and bite appeal is far better than most any bagged chip.

These are just what I've been looking for. I really cannot tolerate salt at all so these are great because I now have salt free tortilla chips and without all the frying. Thanks so much for such a healthy recipe that everyone can enjoy.

I used this (sans anything but the oil and salt) to crisp up tortillas for tortilla soup and I tasted one (because I did want to see what these would be like as corn chips and oh my..I am never buying chips again. My tortillas are all natural and now my chips can be too.

Very yummy! 1st time making my own n they are so much better than store bought. I was able to make the flavors stronger just the way i love. But what i did different i used olive oil, whisked all ingredients together then i dipped one side of the tortilla then stacked them then i cut them into chips baked them in approx 12 minutes and they came out perfect! No more store bought for me. Since they're very easy to make, n will always be fresh ??

I had just made homemade flour tortillas and had leftovers, so I thought I'd give these chips a chance. I substituted olive oil as others suggested, and skipped the lime juice (I made a citrus-y salsa, and didn't want overkill). I love the flavor, but mine came out more like crackers (probably because of the tortillas I used?). Overall, I think this is an excellent recipe, and I'll definitely be using it again!

These are definitely a healthier alternative to the traditional tortilla chip.  They are very dry and you need to put more seasoning to get the flavor.  And they can burn pretty quickly if you don't watch them.  My husband said they are okay....which means don't make these again

This was a pleasant surprise.  So easy and so good!  Didn't use the lime juice; just brushed with olive oil and followed the rest of the recipe as written. Served with homemade guacamole and lentil tacos (another fantastic AR recipe).  Thank you!

Wow!  Made this with homemade organic tortillas.  Had to bake a little longer because the tortillas were thicker than store bought.  Brushed olive oil and sprinkled salt.  Served with homemade hummus, huge hit!  These will go into our regular rotation.  So much cheaper than store bought chips, and I know what's in them :)  Thanks for this simple recipe of a family favorite.

These were really good.  I just dipped each chip in the lime/oil mixture instead and it worked fine.  They get really crispy and flavorful.  I think I'm gonna start making them like this all the time instead of frying them like I had been.

I haven't made this yet, but I am going to try it with low carb tortillas.  It should bring the carb count down to 6 net carbs for one whole tortilla.  Can't wait!!   - I will be able to give a more accurate rating at that time.

Very nice recipe! I don't have a mister, so I just sprayed the tortillas with baking spray. Some of the chips were a tiny bit chewy, but most of them came out just perfect, nice and crunchy. Thanks so much for hsaring!

Next time I need to make sure these are thinner and not stacked, but in a single layer because it took much longer to cook than I expected.  The thinner ones were perfect, thicker ones not so much.

I just made a batch of these using whole grain tortillas and seasoned with plain sea salt. Once cooled, they are crisp and wonderful - just in time for my super bowl get together. I will be using this recipe from now on with both corn and flour tortillas.

I really loved this recipe--you can do so much with this to satisfy a sweet (cinnamon/sugar) or salty craving.  We used whole wheat tortillas and they are great.  I recommend watching closely until you have your recipe perfected.  Ours were done in about 10 minutes.

very good and healthy. i just sprayed each side w/ pam. i didnt have any lime juice so i skipped the salt and used lime salt. i flipped them over after 8 mins and cooked another 6. i think 6 mins each side would be perfect for my oven since they were a little overcooked for me. i only had salsa. next time guac!

Being someone who never bought corn tortillas, this was a really good recipe!  I had to substitute the lime with lemon but it came out nice and crispy...I ended up throwing some in broccoli/cheese soup since I didnt have any salsa/dip either and my b/f loved it and is now bugging me to make more :)

I think these are great. I had 6" tortillas and cut them in 1/6 it seemed like a better size, I had cut them in 1/4, and those turned out chewy in the center, but the 1/6th turned out perfect. I think the only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because they are a little too thick. BUT, I always seem to have corn tortillas left, and this is great to use them, and they're pretty addicting to snack on.

I think these taste ok, but I had a problem with some of the chips staying chewy, while others were brown.  I sprinkled a taco seasoning mixture(Taco Seasoning I), on some and it was very good.  I would make these if I needed some tortilla chips for a dip and didn't have any, but not to snack on plain.

Really yummy!  I skipped the cumin and chili powder for my kids and they were still delish!  Try it with the Salsa II recipe and you won't be sorry!  Bon Appetite!

These were delicious!  I used whole wheat tortillas and they worked perfect.  I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and decided to mix the oil and seasonings together and brush it on, but I will not do this again.  The seasonings were a bit overwhelming for me when done this way.  I think a light sprinkling of the seasonings onto oiled tortillas will probably be perfect.  So I will follow the recipe's directions next time.

I joined this site just so I could review these.  I, like many others, brushed the oil mixture on to the corn tortillas.  They were nice and crispy, and tasted great with salsa!  Making more tomorrow!

We didn't have corn tortillas, so we just used our flour ones, and it still turned out pretty good. We definately overcooked them though, so be sure to be carefull about that next time. They were also really salty - I wanted to make sure they had flavor, but ended up making them too salty. We also just lightly brushed the chips with oil and lime juice and that worked out great. I'd like to try more lime juice nextime, and see if we can make them taste like "hint of lime" chips.

this recipe is simple and very flavorful...used wheat tortillas instead of corn...cook time/temp will definately vary by the oven...keep a close eye so they don't brown too much

I hate to be one of the few dissenters.  I WANTED to like this recipe.  It sounded good and a perfect snack for dh whose cholesterol is eleveated.  I tried the original version and several variations of the spice combinations, corn and flour tortillas.  I (and he) would rather eat two regular chips than a plateful of these.  The sugar and cinnamon recipe was alright, but really only the children will go out of their way to eat them.

I used cooking spray, lemon pepper and some salt free seasoning. They were served with guacamole, salsa, and cheese dip. I liked them.

I used the 6" corn tortillas, cut them into quarters and baked them about 25 minutes for them to turn out crunchy. I also but meat and cheese on them and baked them for about 5 minutes more so that the cheese would melt. I served them with homemade guacamole and salsa too. They are great because the don't break like the store bought chips do. Some were browned but, they were all delicious! Oh my god we are so full!

I had to use whole wheat tortilla's because that's all I had. I brushed on olive oil (didn't have a mister) and sprinkled with sea salt. They were baked at 350F for seven mins, turned over and baked for another 6 minutes. They turned out pretty good!

These did not crisp up enough.  We used corn tortillas and baked them a little longer than the recipe recommended. We were hoping to enjoy them hot out of the oven with our homemade salsa and guacamole, but they were too chewy.  Some reviewers said they are crispier after a day or two (I would call that stale).  I would love to try this again if anyone can suggest how to make them crispier without burning them, because I love the concept, but the results were disappointing.  Btw, we used spray canola oil.

Use lots of cumin and lime juice to make these taste outstanding. Don't be afraid to bake longer than you think - they stay tough until you cook them long enough.

These are very good!  I used flour tortillas because the store was out of corn...and I like flour better anyway.  I sprayed them with cooking spray (only have butter-flavored)and sprinkled on some salt. Very "sturdy" and good with salsa. I read the other reviews so watched closely.  Probably took a total of about 10 minutes.  They were a little chewy when I first took them out of the oven, but crisped up after a few minutes.  Would like to try with corn too, or some whole-wheat for more nutrition.

These were pretty good. I made three batches (one that was just salt but got overbaked, one that was baked correctly with just salt, and another with the suggested spices) The two that were baked correctly were pretty good. I think they will turn out better when I get something that will actually 'mist' the lime and oil mixture. Make sure you don't overbake even the slightest will change the whole taste.

These were done in about 7 minutes total. I used fresh lime the first time I made them and fresh lemon juice the second time..couldn't tell the difference. Also used olive oil and 'cajun' spice instead of chili..tasted great..so one can be flexable on this recipe.

I had to make flour tortillas to try this recipe:) but certainly worth it. Used a ziploc to mix all the ingredients and the cut tortilla wedges. Loved it. Thanks. Sure, would taste even better with corn tortillas.

I thought they were great.  We will be making these again.  Like others said, watch your cooking time.  It only took mine about five minutes to cook.

I loved it. It's more chewy than a chip, but it tasted great and it's way more healthy than the real thing.
