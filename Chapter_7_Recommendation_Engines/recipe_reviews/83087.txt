I give this 5 stars for the dressing alone. I have been trying to figure out how to duplicate the dressing which I've had on a similar salad and this hit the spot. That said, you should know that I "modified" it a bit. I used approx 3 Tbsp of lime juice, no zest, 1 Tbsp of white sugar and no garlic (husband hates it). The pepper flakes were a nice touch and you could also use Chinese chili (red) oil for some heat. To make it a dinner salad, I took precooked chicken, tossed it in some soy sauce and about 1/2 tsp of grated fresh ginger and added that, along with a couple of finely chopped green onions. I served it on a bed of chopped romaine lettuce. YUMMY! Thanks so much for the dressing - you made my day.

Yum!  What a great recipe.  I followed it almost exactly except I added sesame seeds instead of the peanuts, honey instead of brown sugar, Asian chili sauce instead of peppers, and some grated ginger.  I also threw in some edamame along with shredded carrots.  Just as good, if not better then the restaurants. UPDATE: two days later and its AMAZING!!! Definitely let it sit as long as you can.  I wish it would last longer then two days but sadly its all gone:(

I used 1 lb. angel hair pasta because I didn't have the soba noodles, and they worked very well. I omitted the cilantro. Found the recipe to be tasty, but the vinegar taste was strong. If I made it again, I would reduce the amount of wine vinegar. A fresh tasting recipe.

The dressing for this salad is delicious. I add about a tablespoon of Mirin to the dressing which cuts down on the dryness as well. I like more vegetables in this salad. My favorite it to add julienned daikon radish and whole sugar snap peas. I have also added small pieces of aspragus, although they are not so oriental. If you add too many more veggies, you need to make a little more dressing, though. I have made this recipe with salmon, doubled the dressing recipe and used it to marinate the salmon to have the flavors pull through in another dish. It was wonderful!

Wow!!
This is a great summer dish
This has all the yin/yang qualities: sweet and sour, crisp and smooth, green and orange.
My wife HATES cilantro: and yet, with the lime, she loved it.  
I used panchit noodles, but that was the only variation.

This is easy to prpeare, and can be made ahead of time

Tahnks, Christiana , for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I couldn't find soba noodles so I settled for angel hair, and it worked great.  I love lime and garlic so I increased it to 3 cloves, and made sure to include all the juice and zest of 1 lime despite other reviews.  I also added a little more cilantro than called for.  It does make a lot, but for a party I would probably double it.  I only put in 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, and that gave it just enough kick for me.
Update- I made this again, with soba noodles found at my local grocery.  They were ones made from buckwheat flour!  I added a little more rice vinegar and soy sauce because I remembered it needed more moisture last time, but the soba noodles don't absorb as much as the angel hair, so there was too much liquid.  It is still delicious though!  I added some green onion this time too, and omitted the nuts.

This recipe was great!  Definately serve after letting the salad sit in the 'fridge overnight--more flavor! I added mandarin oranges, crushed pineapple, and baby corn to the salad, too.

This salad was great. It had a fantastic flavor. I didn't use lime zest. So, it wasn't overpowering.

THis was a hit with 6 children and adults alike!  I left out the lime zest (didn't seem to be missing).  Used the juice of a whole small lime.  The peanuts were great for crunch.  Also left out pepper flakes and added a touch of homegrown red pepper (cayenne). Used ramen (5 packs) instead of soba (not overcooking these is the key).  Did splash with some soy and rice vinegar again before serving to not serve so dry.  Makes a LOT!  Still really good the next day! Thanks for a great recipe.  We will use this again!

Delicious base recipe!  I cooked 1/2 pound angel hair noodles and tossed with 1/2 the dressing with 1tsp minced ginger added. Later in the week I added 1T peanut butter to the remainder of the dressing for another, different meal.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I will definitely make this all year.  I did cut back on the red pepper flakes as that I don't like things too spicy and 1/2 tsp. was perfect for me.  The only thing that I would have to be critical of and that is:  what is this about cooking the noodles and then cutting them in 3" lengths??  Just break the suckers in half and cook them.  Seemed like a totally waste of time step to do it that way.  Anyway, Christiana thank you for sharing, great recipe!!!!

The combination of ingredients sounded good.  The initial taste was okay, but I found the recipe to be a little too tart.    Since my husband does not care for soba noodles, I tried substituting the soba with ramen.  Unfortunately, the noodles became mushy and tasteless.  Sorry not a keeper.

the balance of flavors is off.  There is too much lime and vinegar--it's actually quite sour. Next time I will reduce the amount of these two ingredients and I think it will be fantastic.  Maybe add more soy sauce and sugar.

I likes the mix, but think next time I'll add some ginger and either omit the sugar or cut it in half. Mixed in some edamame red pepper sliced thin, carrots sliced thin and a little onion to make the salad more of a complete dish. Made the dressing in advance so the flavors could mix before putting them on the noodles, really liked the results.

This recipe is perfect. I just love it!!   I usually substitute whole wheat spaghetti, broken into thirds *before* cooking, for the soba noodles - only because those are the noodles I usually have at home.   More often than not, I eat this dish warm because I cannot wait for it it cool. It's scrumptious!

Fantastic!!! I needed to make a cold soba salad for 25 people and this was perfect. I have made several different cold noodle dishes and this one is by far the best! I used buckwheat noodles which I thought made it better. I also added scallions. Not sure why there are peas in the picture since they are not on the ingredient list! I think it is better not to have them anyway. Quick , easy & very tasty. Several people have asked for the recipe so I will be making this again.

Converts super easily to gluten-free: just substitute rice or bean noodles for soba and use a GF soy sauce. I also threw in a bag of shredded broccoli/carrot/cabbage slaw for more color and texture. Lots of compliments, both gluten-free and the regular version.

2-26-2016  ~One of Hubs' favorite dishes to order here in Naples is a tuna tataki which is served with a cold noodle salad much like this, which he even remarked upon.  It's no wonder, then, that this got a "This is excellent" out of him.  You can taste each of the ingredients, yet they're all subtle and do end up blended and balanced in flavor.  For a little green, I added chopped green onion and julienned cucumber, both nice additions.  I also gave it a  dribble of oil, which after I tasted it was more to my liking.

Great! I used spaghetti . I also made twice the amount of sauce, ending at the lime juice.
  I added yellow peps(we love peepers) and I also added green onion and snap eas(our peas were ready to eat). 
 It was a very god salad. My husband des not like the flavor of peanut butter iin salads and this wasn't too nutty.
 Will make again.

OMG - this was really good. My soba noodle instructions were to boil for 5min and then rinse with cold water. I made sure to use a good brand of Japanese rice vinegar (I have used store brand rice vinegar and have been disappointed in the past). This was a great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I needed a recipe for a potluck, but I was leaving the house a few hours beforehand and the facility had nowhere to heat a dish, so this fit the bill.  I used buckwheat soba and got many, many compliments on the dish.  Two people asked for the recipe.  One thing I was wondering, though...  Would it make any difference to break up the soba noodles before cooking?  It was awfully sloppy to try to chop them into smaller lengths after they cooked, as the instructions called for.

OK THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD, JUST NEED TO CUT THE LIME BACK TO HALF AND CUT OR OMIT THE CILANTRO ALL TOGETHER. I ALSO ADDED SOME DICED RED PEPPER AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED TO DO

Delicious! Improvised with thin spaghetti instead of soba noodles and we like to use crunchy peanut butter instead of just peanuts. Great flavor, terrific side dish.

This is an excellent salad!!! We love it.  I used sesame seeds instead of peanuts.  Keep the carrots and cilantro.  They add color and crunch. I only had 13 oz soba instead of the 15, but it was perfect.  A nice zingy salad for summer.

Love this recipe! So easy to put together and it only gets better with time! I added some fresh grated ginger and sugar snap peas and left out the peanuts. Great way to add these healthy buckwheat noodles to your diet!

8.29.16   I added some red bell pepper slices, frozen petite peas, and some sliced green onions to give this a bit more eye appeal.  I didn’t have soba noodles on hand, so I substituted thick spaghetti.  Love recipes like this where you can knock out side dishes early in the day to make evening meal preparation easier.  This will be served tonight  with grilled smoked chops and grilled fresh pineapple slices for an easy, hot summer day dinner.

This is SO good!  My boyfriend says it is one of the best things I make, and he wants it at least once every 10 days.   My additions were simply some fresh grated ginger and some minced scallions.      But, here's my secret:  if you really want to change the recipe, focus on the quality of the soba.     Unfortunately, most dry soba has only a teeny amount of buckwheat.   Although soba recipes call for a buckwheat: wheat ratio of 4:1, a lot of commercial soba is the reverse 1:4.  So,   try to find soba with more buckwheat than wheat.    Or, make your own, and then you can get the ratio just right.  It is so incredibly easy to make soba, you won't believe it.   There are plenty of instructions online.  I like the instructions from the LA Times, bc it includes photos.

I used wheat angel hair pasta and followed the rest of the recipe - love it!  I did add more cilantro, just because I love it, but the salad was excellent before that.  Will make again as soon as I get more cilantro!

Yummy!  I added chopped fresh broccoli, a lot more carrots than called for, and used a less of the noodles (just what was on hand).  This was a crunchy, tangy, delicious salad.  I would definitely make it again.  Big hit with both the meat eaters and vegetarians of the house.

Great noodles! I used thin whole wheat spaghetti instead of the soba, and added some broccoli coleslaw (without dressing) and thinly sliced red peppers. Sesame seeds would be a great addition. I spiced it up even more with some Hunan chili sauce.

What a great Asian noodle recipe! I'm Korean and I crave cold noodles in the summer time. This was perfect for my boyfriend who can't eat something too spicy. This was just right amount of spicy for my American friends too! I added a bit of Vietnamese dipping sauce to make it more exotic...turned out so refreshing!

I can't believe how delicious this was! We made it for an easy dinner last night and ate the entire bowl. . .whoops.  Serve with cold sake.  If you would sprinkle this with toasted sesame seeds that would make a nice touch.  I didn't have peanuts so I used chopped raw cashews from trader joe's and threw in a little sea salt to make up for the salted peanuts.  The dressing was delicious and I agree with the reviewers who said this deserves 5 stars on the dressing alone, which I will be trying in other foods.  Let's see, I substituted olive oil for sesame oil but I know sesame oil would be delicious.  One minor change is I used a bit more oil, more like 2 tbsp., because I have very sticky soba noodles and they need more to unstick them.

This salad was very flavorful but I was not fond of the flavor combination. No one would eat these, but I think my family prefers more of the brown sugar/soy sauce/garlic flavor combinations in Asian cooking instead of the cilantro/lime/sesame oil.

I LOVE cold sesame noodles. I was not impressed by this recipe. I agree with other raters, the flavor wasn't balanced and there was too much vinegar/lime juice.  I added a bunch more sesame oil and some tahini to try to mitigate the sourness. That helped, but....  Still on the search for a great recipe.

Used lo mein rather than soba noodles (store didn't carry.)  Other than that, kept the recipe as indicated.  My family LOVED this dish, which I served alongside asian lettuce wraps.

Great find - don't use the cilantro as it takes absolute ownership of the dish.  Without the cilantro this dish is "5 star" and I will make it again.  The dressing alone is worth the price of admission.

Great flavors!  I added some cucumber and it tasted so light and fresh.  I love this recipe for the summer.  I think any type of shredded veggies would be great too.  I would just add the sauce when you are ready to eat.  It tasted really heavy when it was marinaded longer.

I made it precisely as directed and it was so salty I had to throw it out. I think I'll make it again, but I will cut the soy sauce in half and use lite tamari. The basic idea and combination of ingredients is good. The soba is really yummy. I can see using almost any shredded veggies - carrots, slivered shiitakes, peppers, summer squash, pea pods, broccoli slaw, cabbage...

yummy yummy yummy.  I also was out of soba, so I used whole wheat angel hair instead.  Still good.  I used extra lime and cilantro.  I also added tofu cubes and reconstituted dried mushrooms.  The tofu gives a lovely creaminess.  I might add extra peanuts, as they sort of disappeared in the salad.

This sounded so good but turned out awful - others said it was ok but no one had seconds.  Out of 6 of us not one person said they would make it.  Too much bulk and not enough liquid in the dressing.  Nice heat level but all I could taste was cilantro.....

I made this last week to take to a friend's house, as she was making Asian grilled tuna steak salad. I ended up having to use the thin rice noodles because I couldn't find soba, but it was still really good. They absorbed all the liquid and needed more, so I ended up doubling the sauce ingredients. This is sooo tasty -- it's good cold or warm.

OMG! If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!! Can't tell you how much I enjoyed this.. And the fact that I didn't have all the ingredients and it STILL turned out amazing is proof : ) I had to use lemon juice instead of the lime, red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar, and fresh parsley instead of cilantro. I also added an extra tablespoon of soy sauce and vinegar, and some toasted sesame seeds too.. I tossed in a bit of canned tuna and it turned out really well. This is definitely gonna be something I'll make to impress! Thank you soooooo much!

I love this recipe.  I took some suggestions from the others and added green onions, reduced the rice vinegar, omitted the peanuts and doubled the noodles.  Wasn't  saucy but wasn't too dry either. Just right. Some reviews had mushy noodles.  I suggest using the dry packaged Soba noodles in the Oriental section of your supermarket.  The soggy noodles may be caused by using the refrigerated soba noodles.  I will be making this one again.

Nice, easy recipe but I think it would be a lot simpler to break the noodles into 3" pieces than cut them after they are cooked!  I'd try this recipe again with maybe some green onions for color. UPDATE: I made this again with cold whole wheat spaghetti and it worked great.  Also added some peas and grilled chicken to make it a whole meal.  Yum!

This was fantastic.  I did it the Japanese way, so I left out the peanuts and cilantro and added seseme seeds.  I accidentally forgot the pepper flakes, but will definatly add them next time.  Perfect with a rare steak.  Great summertime dish, and I can see myself making the sauce for salads and wraps in the future.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was sour (vinegary) and I had to add a lot of things to make it edible like more sugar and lots of peanut butter.

I made this with regular sesame oil since it was all I had. I also added red pepper and green onion, which I recommend. For me this recipe was decent but nothing special. I took it to a potluck and people liked it fine but it did not garner any special compliments. Maybe dark sesame oil makes a big difference but I won't be making this again.

Wow. This recipe is amazing and makes for the most satisfying bag lunch. Actually took this with me on an airplane and it was by far the best airplane food I've ever had. I used ramen noodles instead of soba and honey instead of brown sugar. I went for the japanese version and added chicken for more dimension. Best recipe I've tried in the last year. Oh wait! One more thing! I also added edamame to this which really sent it over the top.

This was very good.  I followed exactly, except I had to use gluten free noodles.  I don't know if it is because of the type of noodles used, but it seemed too strong with too much sauce, so I added 1.5 lbs of cubed cooked seasoned chicken and that seemed to absorb more of the sauce and flavors.  All of my boys loved it and scored it a 4. I think green onions and maybe even some chopped cucumber would be good additions too.  Excellent summer meal.  Quick and easy to make, just need to plan a head so it has time to sit in the fridge.  Thanks.

I prepared this dish last night and will serve to guests today.  I hope they like it; I omitted the peanuts, added sesame seeds and shrimp.  First blush this dish is DELICIOUS, one modification in the future is that I will use half the sugar since the rice vinegar had sugar added.

UPDATE*** This dish was AWESOME however, i will reduce the sugar the next time I prepare this salad.  I did increase the heat; this is a GREAT spring/summer dish.

Thought it was good.  The peanuts kind of got "lost" in there, though.  I think I'd chop them bigger than I did AND put them on top at the very last moment so they keep their crunch.

just made this salad, I omitted cilantro and peanuts as I didn't have them on hand. Next time will add less vinegar and splash more sesame oil. also added finely sliced red and green peppers for colour and sliced cucumber. this makes a lot of dressing too but otherwise nice salad!

This dish is simple and great. I had all of the ingredients on hand, which is a plus. I also added a few items. I added sauteed chicken and shrimp. I also tossed in a handful of snap peas, sliced cucumbers, and topped it off with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds for added crunch. Yummy!

I accidentally used ground red pepper instead of red pepper flakes and it turned out awesome! It was spicy, but not too spicy. We also used peanuts and edamame...no carrots.

I make a lot of recipes from this site but unfortunately I was disappointed with this one.  I made it as a main dish with shrimp.  I think its the vinegar that makes it way too tangy.  My husband and I did not really enjoy it and threw out the leftovers.

I could not find the soba noodles, so I used thin spaghetti instead. Maybe it was the noodles that I used, but I found the salad to be very dry. The flavor from the sauce was amazing, but I think next time I will make a serving and a half of the sauce to accompany one serving of the noodles.

Delicious. I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, which still called for the juice of 1 lime. It was a bit too much- cut back next time. Some finely shredded cabbage and fresh edamame made a nice addition. Served with Korean cucumber salad (YUM) from Bittman's Vegetarian book.

Delicious, exactly what I was looking. I wanted a salad, that did not have a creamy peanut butter base. Here are the changes I made, I used 1lb of cappelini, no lime zest, and 1/2 of lime juice, no cilantro. I also added diced red pepper to the pasta as well as toasted sesame seeds, chopped peanuts and grated carrots. Lastly I use about a teaspoon of "Sambal Oelek", an Asian chili paste, that gives it spice.  My whole family loves this dish

Made this as per the recipe except I used lime juice instead of juice and zest and I used red chili paste instead of flakes cause I have a great gourmet one on hand.  Was very good.  Made the sauce first and let it refrigerate while I went out and got noodles.  Let it all sit together for about 20 mins before serving.  Was great the next two days.  Added chicken the first night I did in Soy and Sweet Thai Chili sauce.  Like other reviewers I added green onions and extra veggies.  Could add anything to this - very nice.  And I had lots of sauce night of and for leftovers although I think my store sold Soba noodles in 12oz packs, not 15oz.  Only four stars because while it tasted great, I don't have the urge to make this weekly, even during this hot summer weather.

I halved the recipe (feeding 2 people) and there was plenty leftover (used 2 packages of ramen noodles). My BF and I loved this recipe and it has been requested to be in our rotation. I added green onions, red bell pepper, and cucumbers. I omitted the peanuts, but added toasted sesame seeds when serving. Very tasty! I've been looking for a cold noodle salad for these hot summer days and it hit the spot. I served with leftover teriyaki pork tenderloin.

This was okay.  I think it'll be a nice base for what I'm looking for.  I agree with another reviewer that the vinegar is too much.  I will make this again and cut the vinegar down.  I did get some very nice comments about it at the cookout I took it to.

Very good. It had a great kick to it. I just used leftover spagatti noodles. I think it would be better with soba or some asian noodle. I added sesame seeds cause they're pretty and they add calcium. Skipped the peanuts and used a whole lot more cilantro.

It was good. I followed the recipe exactly. The dressing was flavourful, but the salad itself was kind of boring. Next time I make it I'll add broccoli florets and....things. Peppers? Frozen peas? Not sure what. But I want the noodle to veg ration to be more interesting. Then maybe it gets more stars!

WOW WOW WOW!!  Loved this!  I have been looking for the right sauce for a coulple of months now and I have finally found it!  I kicked it up a notch by adding a whole lot of extras ie: chicken, zuccinni, baby corn, sugar peas etc..  Kinda just used up what I had in the fridge.  It was great cold and warm ( hubby couldn't wait for it to cool)  Thank you my search has ended!

We really liked this recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I used ramen noodles instead of soba and omitted the cilantro because we don't like it.  I didn't have any limes, so I omitted the lime zest and substituted 2 tablespoons of bottled lime juice instead.  And I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon, which was definitely spicy enough for us.  It certainly would have had more flavor with the ingredients I omitted, so this is a good dish for a person who likes spicy food.

This recipe is easy and delicious. The dressing is perfect.  Instead of shredded carrots, I just added a bag of pre-packaged broccoli slaw to add a little more substance and nutrition.

I made this with Pad Thai noodles and that did NOT work out so well.  There was just way too much noodle and not enough of anything else.  I will try this again with other noodles because I loved the flavor of the dressing.

delicious and simple!  lends itself to many variations--add meat or tofu, more veggies, etc.  holds well for a day or two.

Ok only small modifications based on what was in the pantry...too yukky to go outside.  I used linguine for the noodles, Emeril's Asian Essence (a wee bit- as I didn't have cilantro), no lime zest as I didn't have a fresh lime, cashews as I didn't have peanuts. Added sliced green onions.

I poured all of the sauce/veggie ingredients over the hot linguine.....oooo as a warm pasta dish it's awesome, can't wait to try cold and with all the exact ingredients.  It reminds me of the asian noodle salad they have at The Fresh Market!

Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe!  I brought it to a Halloween Party and it was a big hit....  I do agreed with a few other postings that there is a bit too much rice wine vinegar in the recipe so I added more soy sauce to tone down the vinegar which worked well.  Also, I substitued green beans for the carrots since I'm not a big fan of carrots.  I added sesame seeds for fun.

This was pretty good. I added a few more veggies to it according to what I had on hand - green onions, a bit of cabbage. Didn't put in as much red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp) because I knew the old ladies at church wouldn't appreciate it too hot! It keeps really well - I've been noshing on it for almost a week. I didn't change the amounts of anything - didn't have too much or too little sauce. I also didn't have any soba noodles (not in my small town grocery!) so I substituted spaghetti noodles. Perhaps I'll make it again someday.

I doubled this recipe and it tasted great! Pretty spicy some said. I added more peanuts for flavor (may be good with a thai-peanut sauce)and more carrots. A friend said she would buy it at the store, so I think I will be making this again.

I made this salad with Vietnamese rice noodles. Also, served over a large piece of green leaf lettuce; added color and a little crunch! VERY GOOD, this recipe is a keeper.

My family loved this salad. Followed recipe exactly with 1 change that would not change the recipes rating. I used rice ramen noodles since we have a celiac daughter so we had to make it gluten free. Raved about the dressing whole time they ate it. This recipe is a keeper

This is a phenomenal recipe - the sauce is just great with all the right elements to make it interesting and delicious.  I didn't have a lime on hand so I just used 2 tbsp of lime juice, and I squeezed a few squirts of sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes.  I omitted peanuts because they aren't school-friendly, used spaghetti instead of soba and added sliced green onions, cooked edamame and some fried eggs for protein.

Turned out good.  I think the vinegar was a little to strong, so next time I'll use less.  I had to add more brown sugar to calm the vinegar down.   I also didn't have carrots so I julienned some red peppers and it was good.  Everything else remained the same.  I think that the longer you leave it in the fridge the better.  Even overnight.  It will soak up the flavours more.

Super ! I had another recipe where there was 1/2 cup oil and it was very oily! This one is so much more flavorful and not oily . I didn’t find Soba noodles and used Udon noodles instead. The pkg was 10oz  so I didn’t use all the sauce . I added chopped red peppers and snap peas and green onions. Loved it !

Ok this tasted like straight cilantro and vinegar!! No, no and NO...!! To save this recipe I melted 2 TBS of peanut butter and mixed it inwith additional 2 TBS  of sesame oil.Now that subdued the over powering taste of vinegar and cilantro and was perfect !! I used Pad Thai noodles, chopped red pepper and 2/3 cup grated carrots which was plenty. I also used 1/4 cup chopped fine cilantro and imo cilantro does not belong in this salad and if you must is 1 TBS. I highly recommend this recipe with these changes ?? I plan to serve this as a side to flank steak and homemade crab Rangoon tmrw

I made this exactly as written and it's the best Asian noodle salad I've made.  Of course, a salad is only as good as its dressing, and this one is  excellent!The dressing would work well as a dipping sauce for egg rolls, spring rolls, or pot stickers also.

Great dressing - I did add a bit of honey along with the brown sugar and substituted Chinese Chili sauce for the pepper flakes. I also added thinly sliced baby peppers and de-seeded cucumbers. Everyone loved it.

It was delicious. I made double and so we ate it 2 nights in a row. Surprisingly, The noodles were not mushy the 2nd day.  The dressing is delicious. I made lots of dressing and used it as a marinate for salmon!  Yummy!

A good recipe. I added some more vegetables to this. I julienned cucumber, green onion, carrot, red bell pepper, and thinly sliced onion and bean sprouts and added it to the salad. The vegetables made it less of just a bunch of noodles with sauce and more of an actual salad.

Oh my god, this was so good! I made it exactly as said and let it sit in the fridge for a whole day before I even ate it so it would soak up all that flavor, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait because it was sooo freaking delicious!

The recipe lacks any mention of quantity of soba noodles. In the method section, it says to add the sesame oil, but it is not listed in the ingredients. Finally, the ingredients list soy sauce, but the method doesn’t mention it. All in all, I have learned in my own life that if a person has ADD, s/he has to check everything three times.

I cut the lime juice in half as I thought a whole lime plus zest would be too much.  Half is too much unless you love lime.  It was all I could taste.  Next time I will cut it down to a quarter of what the recipe calls for.  Otherwise this is a decent salad.

Great salad! I added black sesame seeds and will reduce the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp next time I make this. Served the peanuts on the side as I didn't want them to get soggy.

Pretty darn good and so easy too! I added green onion, edamame, bell peppers and some teriyaki chicken and it turned out great! I only omitted the lime juice and zest because I felt like it was tart enough without it.

We loved this salad.  I'd first attempted a different recipe from this site but didn't care for it at all.  I'm so glad I found this one and took another chance because this is fantastic! 
The only changes I made was to leave out the cilantro and added some chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds.   I served this as a side dish to the Hoi sin beef skewers  (also from this site) and it  was a great summer meal.
Thanks for sharing!

We liked this, however we found there wasn't enough of the dressing with additional veggies.  My soba noodle pack was only 11 oz, but I made the full amount of dressing.  I did use the juice of one lime and the zest, but my lime wasn't very juicy which is why one lime may be too much for some.  I thought noodle salad was a bit dry, so I added a large splash of low sodium soy sauce before serving, then added lime wedges on the side.  Most of my family wanted more peanuts, so I had those on the side too.  This is a sweet salad, next time I'll cut the sugar some and add either fresh fresno pepper slices  or make sure I have fresh red pepper flakes.

I used Chinese noodles because I didn't have  soba noodles
 I also didnt have frozen veggies so I used fresh broccoli.  It was pretty tasty

 The sauce was a little dry. My husband had to add water to the sauce. Overall it was a good dish and I will make it again.

I followed the recipe for the dressing exactly and loved it. I've always been a fan of these types of salads. I did add cucumber for some extra crunch and nutrition but otherwise made it as per the recipe. Very good.

I would definitely add appx 1T fresh grated ginger and break noodles in half or thirds prior to cooking.. 1\2 t. . red pepper flakes are plenty for me. I advise making the dressing about 30 minutes to 1hr prio to mixing. Then taste and adjust to your liking.. I also like lots more veggies....Napa cabbage ,  maybe a little red cabbage,  bell pepper slices,bean sprouts. I like the noodle veg ratio to be about even.  However that can be ALOT more chopping & needs more dressing.. But it just gets better as it sits in fridge and keeps well  A day or 3 more veggies in my diet and less cooking works for me. I also find that when I eat much more veggies, I snack MUCHl less. and lose a little weight.
Try making this dressing as a marinate for chicken., Then stir fry the chicken and add to the salad.

I like this recipe a lot but I did tweak it. I used a little more brown sugar and much less cayenne pepper as the recipe calls for. I suggest adding the cayenne a little bit at a time and testing the dressing to get it to your taste.i also omitted the cilantro and peanuts and added sesame seeds as suggested.

I used whole wheat pasta as I didn't  have Soba noodles.  I added some grated ginger and used twice the amount of rice vinegar for a more tangy flavor.  I added about 3 cups of massaged kale,  to increase the fiber content; 1/2c chopped green onions and some teriyaki chicken that I had.  DEE-LISH-US!!  Next time I will add some shrimp- as I am already planning for my Wed. nite salad dinner ;-)

Didn't change anything in the recipe, very light and refreshing, love it that there's no oil in it (except for the very small amount of sesame oil). Next time I'll trying using green onion instead of cilantro, I think that might make it even better.

So good! This will definitely be something I start making regularly. I omitted the lime zest based on others' comments and did the Japanese version with toasted sesame seeds and no red pepper, cilantro, or peanuts. I used ramen noodles because I wasn't able to find Soba noodles. I made it and served it immediately as a side dish to store-bought rotisserie chicken.

Made it per recipe except 1 tsp red pepper flakes as it went to picnic.  Everyone loved it. Lime and cilantro obvious flavors.
Next time will increase the liquids and peanuts.  Maybe add sesame seeds and bean sprouts.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is.  I don't think the zest or the lime juice needed to be adjusted and I had a rather large lime. Whole foods has 100% whole buckwheat Soba noodles in 8 oz. bags and I used two of those.  Since I like very robust flavors and after reading many reviewer comments, here is what I added:  small chopped pieces of 1/2 of a large red bell pepper, 3/4 cup edamame, 3 green scallions, 8 sliced snow peas, 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds, 2 additional cloves of garlic, 1 tsp. crushed ginger, 1 whole fresh jalapeno pepper diced very small seeds and all.  When it came to the sesame oil, I used 1 Tbsp. sesame and 1/2 Tbsp. hot chili oil.  I forgot my nuts, but honestly after eating it, I didn't see how it was going to enhance my particular concoction.  I had every intention and purchased cashews for the purpose.  Oh well.  This is a great salad as is or with your adds.  I think the dressing amount is spot on as my Soba noodles and all the ingredients get completely coated.  (I'm eating it as I write this.) Oh, I forgot, I did sub honey for the brown sugar as I was out.  The bonus of this salad is that it's super healthy as well, especially if you are using the 100% buckwheat Soba noodles. Thanks Christiana Heins for posting it!

I've made this dish SO many times. The dressing is so perfect!! The only minor changes I make is less red pepper flakes, add yellow or orange bell peppers and use rotini pasta. I feel like the rotini pasta catches the dressing and mixes better with everything :)

This was pretty good. Had to use angel hair pasta instead of soba noodles. The dressing pretty much all got absorbed into the pasta so was slightly dry. Good flavor although I backed off the vinegar a bit to make it less tart.

FANTASTIC!!!! I doubled this recipe and there are NO leftovers.  I used a big handful of matchstick carrots instead of grated carrots, I used 1 1/4 cups of  salted dry roasted peanuts-not chopped (I'm a peanut fan). I didn't measure the cilantro but I know I used more than the  recipe called for. I made the dressing in advance and refrigerated it. I rinsed the soba noodles in cold water and then added the dressing. It was too yummy looking to wait for an hour to refrigerate. My family LOVED it!!!! We WILL enjoy this again soon!

I followed the original recipe but I added a teaspoon of finely chopped fresh ginger, which I think is a key ingredient to make this dish truly oriental. It also tastes great!

Spicy and delicious! I love spicy food but for the average person, I would probably half it. I made it a meal by adding ground turkey. I used brown rice pasta, added edamame, and used 1tablesoon of honey in place of the sugar. So good!!

I made the Japanese version of this, "For a Japanese flavor, omit the pepper flakes, peanuts, and cilantro. Add 1/4 c. of toasted sesame seeds."
I used rice noodles and also added edamame and served the dressing warm since I'm not a fan of cold noodles.
I enjoyed it, as did my 18 month old, but my husband thought it had a bit too much vinegar.

First time trying soba noodles. Unlike wheat pasta, the consistency is great. Good dish.  I guess I expected more of a peanut flavor than it had.  Cilantro haters:  substitute 1/2 cup frozen peas.

We've made this a few times now, and being we still can't find the Sobe noodles it calls for, we're just using angle hair pasta and everyone has always loved it, never one complaint!  Can't wait for the snow to melt and to enjoy this on a nice summer eve.

Wow, this is so good.  The dressing is fantastic.  I cut the lime juice in half because I am not a big citrus fan and it was perfect.  I went the Japanese route and added the toasted sesame seed and left out the peanuts and cilantro.  The sesame seeds, in my mind, really made the salad.

I skipped the cilantro and used green onion instead.  I used regular olive oil instead of sesame oil. I used 8 oz macaroni instead of soba noodles, but kept the same amounts for the other ingredients.  I also used cashews instead of pine nuts.  Very different and very good.  It was also very easy and quick to make.

Grate, don't shred, the carrots.  The shredded carrots clumped together and soaked up the seasoning for an uneven flavor.  I also used whole grain, angel hair pasta noodles and regular sesame oil.  Everyone raved about this dish and wanted to know where I'd bought it.  The could not believe I'd made it and that it was an easy recipie.

This was ok. I wouldn't recommend making it with ramen noodles. It just tastes like overpriced top ramen. Maybe with other noodles it would be better.

Yummy! The dressing is awesome. I used only 9 ounces of soba noodles as it's just for me, but kept the dressing amount the same. Only other change was to add in some freshly grated ginger. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Delish! I like the combination of flavors.  The only small change I made was to add a bit less vinegar (I was just shy of 1/3 cup).  I did like the peanuts toasted sesame seeds would work well, too.

Yummy salad with lots of zing! I used broken fettucini noodles, and added pea pods.  I served it as a side dish to the Thai Fish Cakes found on this website.  I will be making this again!

Awesome, and came together in less than 10 miuntes! I actually halved the recipe and used 2 packs of ramen nooodles that I had on hand.  I subbed the peanuts for toasted sesame and used about 3 tbs of lime juice.  Instead of red pepper flakes, I added about 2 tbs of sweet Thai chili sauce, only because my hubbys not too big of a spicy eater like me.   A hint to those in a hurry and using ramen- place the block of noodles in a microwave safe bowl, cover with water, and microwave on high for 4 minutes- they come out perfect everytime.

this was good, but not excellent. it felt like there was too much noodle and not enough of other things, so i added some bean sprouts and sesame seed. i think some water chestnuts, napa cabbage, or bell peppers would've made for a more varied texture and more appealing appearance.

Substituted green onions for the cilantro and sesame seeds for the peanuts but other than followed the recipe. I must say, i like the traditional Japanese soba soup base (store bought) than i did this one. I will probably not make this again. It wasnt bad though...just not what im use to.

I've made this a few times now.  It's a keeper!  I toasted sesame seeds for it in a pinch substituting the peanuts.  Even better!  I usually sautee my onions and garlic, fresh ginger and throw in my green beans and julienned carrots before tossing with the noodles and sauce, herbs.  Wonderful! 

((I'm surprised to see not many others added ginger; it's a must imho!))

I've been looking for a recipe like this to duplicate a salad we buy in our local deli. This recipe is even better and so much less expensive to make myself.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and after that I used pasta instead of soba noodles.  It's so easy and delicious.  Thank you!!!

Better than what I buy in our local deli! I have been trying to find a recipe like this for several years and this is the one. I omitted the peanuts and carrots and added a little more brown sugar.  Also, I just used whole wheat angel hair pasta.

I loved this super easy dish.  I ended up adding a little more garlic, sesame oil and we used tamari sauce instead of soy.  I let it sit in the fridge for several hours and kept adding the sesame and tamari to taste.  As is, it tasted a bit too much like lime.  Thanks for the great salad.  I will be making it very often!!!

I fixed this for a potluck at the beach over Mem Day weekend and it was a hit.  I left out the peanuts because of a peanut allergy, used buckwheat soba noodles and brown rice vinegar because that's what I had. I don't know how that might've made this different but everyone liked it as it came out.  Even my two year old chowed it though she did guzzle a lot of juice when she hit a pepper flake.  Definitely need to "meld" in the fridge for awhile first.  An hour was good... can't wait to see how it turns out if I leave it in longer.  I did break the noodles (actually into 4" as mine were 8" long) before putting in the pot and it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good recipe.  I made it with spaghetti noodles instead, since I didn't have soba noodles.  I added some sauteed chicken breast to it as well.

Yummm! I did add a bit extra soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil and it turned out perfect. Also used 3 tsp of red pepper flakes and everybody thought it was the perfect amount of spice. Definately one of my favorite recipes now.

MADE THIS FOR A DINNER PARTY AND IT WAS A BIG HIT.  USED THIN RICE VERMICELLI NOODLES INSTEAD OF SOBA, SO FAST AND EASY.  RED BELL PEPPER GAVE A NICE COLORFUL CRUNCH.  DON'T SKIMP ON THE PEANUTS OR CILANTRO, IT MAKES IT SO GOOD.

Hmmm. I must have either had an extra-large and juicy lime or not enough noodles (probably both), because the lime was too strong in this dish. I made the Japanese variation with nori, and the flavor was very good, but next time I'll start with half a lime. I also think the lime probably goes better with the original version, so I'll try that, too.
