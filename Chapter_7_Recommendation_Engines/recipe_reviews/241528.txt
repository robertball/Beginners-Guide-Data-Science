I was out of a lot of the ingredients but made this cake anyways with some substitutions. I didn’t have coconut flour so used white flour instead, and I was out of cocoa so I omitted it and compensated with a dash more Nutella. Also, I used milk instead of almond milk, and took the advice of another reviewer by adding a bit more milk to avoid dryness (1/2 Tbs). Even with all the substitutions this turned out fudgey, moist and delicious. My only suggestion is to make sure you mix everything very well, as I failed to do so and there was a bit at the bottom that didn’t cook properly.

I'm going to give this 5 stars because it is the BEST microwave cake I have ever tried. With that said it was a tad dry, but note bad. Next time I will try adding a Tablespoon or two of milk to remedy it. I suggest topping it with chocolate icing or ice cream.

For such a quick dessert and few ingredients,  it was pretty good!  I added some whipped cream and a few mini chocolate chips for the finish.  Tasty.

A quick and easy tv snack! I prefer ooey gooey, so I only microwaved for the minute. Did not have almond flour, so used all all purpose flour. Put a spoonful of cool whip on top after microwaving and let it melt up a bit. Yummy!

Pretty tasty when you need a quick, chocolatey fix!  I used white flour and milk, as I didn't have the others on hand.  Yum!
I used 4 tbsp of milk.

Satisfying and extremely easy, but I found it too heavy, dense, and gooey for my taste.  I increased the milk slightly, per other reviewers. I actually like the Microwave Chocolate Mug Cake better (3/4 recipe, with reduced sugar and oil and slightly increased cocoa), because the texture is lighter. But this satisfied my chocolate urge and I liked that it was not overly sweet. I may try switching up some of the flour in my other recipe for coconut flour and using almond milk.

I used peanut butter instead of Nutella and used a total of about 5 tablespoons. I wasn’t exact, though. Delicious and so fun to watch it poor up in the microwave! Even better with some chocolate icing on top!

I didn't have enough Nutella to make the recipe, so I substituted chocolate pudding that I had on the shelf.  I put the little bit of Nutella I had in the jar on top of the cake like frosting and topped it with a scoop of ice cream.  My daughter loved it.  It wasn't overly sweet but very chocolatey, which is what she was craving.  I will definitely make this again with Nutella for the whole recipe.  Loved the use of coconut flour in this, and almond milk.  So quick and easy!  A new family fave!!!
