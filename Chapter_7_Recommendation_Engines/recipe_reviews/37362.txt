This chili is the best I have ever made.  It was worth the hour and 15 minutes it took me to prepare it.  I love spice and flavor so I added more garlic and almost twice the amount of chili powder, cumin, oregano, and salt.  My family couldn't get done raving about the awesome flavor and the crunchy bits of bacon are an unexpected pleasant surprise.  I will make it again and again!

This chili is WONDERFUL!!!  I too was overwhelmed by the long list of ingredients, so I made it the day before.  It takes a while to make, but it is well worth it!  It is definetly better than the average chili!!  Will make again for sure!

I have to preface this by saying that I don't like venison.  Since we have a freezer full of it, I've tried and tried to use it up for my the sake of my husband's ego.  :)  That being said, I was able to take more than a few bites of this.  It does tame down the venison flavor, but in my opinion, doesn't eliminate it entirely.  My husband thought it was "good."  Not outstanding, but just good.  I thought it was more trouble than it was worth for just a "good" reaction from him.  Thanks.

Husband liked this more than I did. I wasn't crazy about the taste, plus I now know I prefer kidney beans to pinto beans in chili. I needed to add a lot more chili powder and also hot sauce until it had the kind of heat and spice Husband likes. This was ok for a change, but I have other chili recipes that I like MUCH more. Thanks though.

This chili was awesome!  I had 1 lb venison smoked sausage and used it in place the italian sausage and used 1lb ground sirloin.  I also used a can of tomato sauce instead of paste.  It was excellent.  The whole family loved it!!  There were no leftovers.  I will definitely make this again.

I can't stand venison and this was perfect for me.  I had no idea there was venison in this.  It was excellant.  The long list of ingredients can be scary, but it's really not that hard and well worth it.  I will make this again.

Husband loved it. I liked it. Omitted one pepper, added one jalapeno, added one tsp cajun seasoning and one tsp Mrs. Dash spicy blend. Next time will add some chopped baby carrots. I felt like it was missing something in terms of veggies.

My family and I did not care for this chili.  It was a little too sweet (presumably from the beer) and did not have enough tomato flavor.

Really tasty, don't drain the beans and it will thicken it some with good flavor. Even non game eaters will like it.

This is the best venison chili I have ever had. I took it  to my in-laws and they loved it too.  Our family does like a little more "fire" in our chili, but that isn't a hard thing to add. This is how I will make my venison chili from now on.

This is without a doubt THE BEST CHILI I HAVE EVER MADE!  The three different type of meats (venison, sausage and bacon) gave it an incredible depth of flavor.  I would not hesitate to substitute lean ground beef for the venison.
I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, kicked it up a notch with some cayenne pepper, added some Chipotle Tabasco sauce for a wonderful smokey touch and squeezed in the juice of a lime as well.  Yum, yum, yum.

Be sure to use a huge pot, you will need it.

So Yummy! This is a very thick chili, which I like. I added crushed red pepper beacause I forgot to get the dried chiles. I also used some cayenne because my husband likes it spicy. This recipe is well worth the time. I made it in the morning and let it cook on low for 6 hrs. There is no clue that it is venison.

I had never eaten or cooked venison before, but with this chili I couldn't even tell that it wasn't beef.  The chili had a great kick to it and wasn't difficult to make.  If my husband ever brings home venison again I'll be making this. The whole pot was gone in 48 hours.  A definate keeper!

I usually make my own, but wanting to try something different I made this for my deer hunting crew. Most really seemed to like it, thus the 4 stars, but my son and I just thought is was OK.

Great starting point. Put some chipotles in instead of jalapenos. My Mother-in-law even liked it. She's not a venison eater. Entered it in a chili cook-off at a local bar and tied for first.

Fantastic! I (and everyone else) loved this chili! I did change one thing - if you like a little spice, like me, you may want to try Hot Italian sausage. I'm sure it is good either way, but I liked the added heat.

This is the best chili recipe hands down.  I've made it twice with venison and it was a hit both times.  I did not change a thing. I will use this recipe with ground beef once I run out of venison.  Five+ stars!  Thank you!

I grew up eating venison, and this is one of the best recipes I have ever had using venison.  For those of you who thing venison is a little gamey, this recipe doesn't taste gamey at all with all the flavors involved.  What a great recipe!
