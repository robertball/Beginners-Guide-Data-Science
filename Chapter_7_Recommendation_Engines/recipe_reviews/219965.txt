Hmmm, looks interesting. I wonder if it would work to use fat free half and half? Or just regular half and half? I've used fat free in clam chowder in past and was a real hit... I may have to try!

This recipe is a pretty good version of alfredo, but should not be called light just because a little heavy cream is replaced by chicken broth.

This was a tasty dish.  However, I can't reconcile the calories and fat with my current dietary requirements of a low fat diet, so I will not make it again.

Once more, I'm totally impressed with Chef John's recipe.  Reducing the stock by half took longer than expected, but that is normal for me.  I can pretty much expect that I need to add 30 minuets to the "ready in" time to any recipe.  This time it was reducing the stock, took me longer than expected.  Everyone loved this, including me.  Very flavorful and I'll most certainly make it again.

This is just *insanely* good, especially over home-made pasta.  The only tweak I made was that I used 2 cups water + 2 tsp. Better Than Boullion chicken base instead of 2 cups chicken stock.  I saved 1 cup of that liquid after cooking the chicken breasts, and added an extra tsp. of the chicken base - used that instead of reducing the chicken stock to 1 cup.  Shaved off some time, and still tasted wonderful!

With a little bit of good luck being blessed with a good genes, a high metabolism and the will to workout 3-4 days a week, I can eat my favorite dish "Fettuccine Alfredo" at least 3 times a month.  However, I thought I'd try this lower fat/calorie version and boy was I impressed!  This was delicious and I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

If this is LIGHT I wanna be on Chef John's weight loss program.-laughing- I made this for a lunch party and it was a hit for 2 reasons. First ITS GLUTEN (not glutton) FREE! One of my guest LOVED that. Second, the flavor was wonderful. Because I am a garlic nut I did add more. I also added broccoli. Very good! OH! I used No Yolk noodles too. I felt it was lighter(ha!) than regular fettuccine.

I made a few weeks ago and it was ultimately delicious! My mother is a hard person to please when it comes to flavour in food she likes and I love to cook with flavour. I made some for dinner and she was in love! She said it tasted like restaurant quality! Great recipe Chef John, keeping posting those amazing recipes!!!

I have tried my share of "lighter" alfredos and this one definitely takes the cake!  I had my reservations about chicken broth, no butter, and egg yolks (?!) but gave it a try anyway.  I'm so glad I did.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream because it's what I had on hand (and it makes me feel slightly less guilty in the fat content dept.)  My only complaint is that it is thin, although half and half probably contributed to this.  Even still it was absolutely delicious and will make again and again!

I used only half cup heavy cream.  Added one small carton plain Greek yogurt and half cup whole milk.  Lighter and outstanding.

My husband loves Alfredo, I don't as much but he asked me to make it. I have made several Chef John recipes and they've always turned out well. This recipe is definitely a keeper. (Hubby thinks it was better than any restaurant Alfredo.) I didn't have any heavy cream, so I made some with milk and butter. I also added steamed broccoli and bell peppers. It turned out really well.
Word of advice- I must have not let the chicken broth reduce enough because our sauce was a little too runny.  Next time, I'll make sure reduce it further.
This recipe certainly isn't light, but I can see why it is 'lighter' than most Alfredo sauces.

I WILL make this again!  I didn't have time for the chicken, so I sauteed shelled shrimp in butter, drained and added it when I added the frozen, defrosted chopped spinach to the finished cheese sauce, warmed it through before serving it over fettuccine.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit with the family, even those who can be a little picky. It was very simple to make, very flavorful and the ingredients were inexpensive. I could not find parmigiana-reggiano in the store so I used Romano, other than that I followed the recipe. I also like that it was a lighter version but taste just like the regular one. I Will definitely make this again!

For some reason, the sauce came out very runny when I made this (I'm sure it was just MY problem and had nothing to do with the recipe!!!) but the leftovers are just DELICIOUS!!! Thank you for a great recipe - Loved it!

I used to make mine with butter but had problems with leftovers because the cream and butter would separate. This is just as good and healthier for you. It was Very tasty.

I actually used condensed cream of mushroom soup for the heavy cream added pasta water fresh mushrooms and 
substituted Shrimp instead of chicken and used only 1 1/2 cups of the parmi cheese  
It satisfied my craving for Alfredo  and was much fewer calories
I only used a tblsp of butter with the garlic and shrimp

We all loved it! I agree with others, if you would like to add different flavors, etc. doesn't mean it isn't  5 stars.  This is great and feeds a lot! If you are looking to cut some calories, this will do it.  It is by no means healthy, but have you found anything with Alfredo in the title that is? The only change I would make is to cut down on the last bit of cheese....do that to taste. Well, and then maybe work out more the next day.

I didn't make any changes. It was fabulous! Pretty simple. I usually get overwhelmed with all the prepping for a recipe, but this was super easy. 
I didn't go looking for a "light" alfredo recipe, so the fact that this is a smidge lighter than a normal recipe is a nice plus.

This was so good. I sautéed a finely chopped red bell pepper, extra garlic and finely chopped red onion in a 1/4 cup of butter until soft (I did not care about extra calories). Chef John is amazing and his recipes keep becoming staples in my house!

This was very good and a nice change of pace from our usual pasta sauce.   I recommend cooking the pasta according to the directions on the box, as 7 minutes was not nearly enough time.  With that adjustment, the recipe is a keeper.

This is a GREAT recipe.  Although it still has a pretty high caloric count, it IS reduced by the fact that there is no butter.  I think it's superior in flavor to many alfredo sauces, in that its flavor is derived in part from the chicken broth. My only comment would be that the next time I make it, I intend to use only half the amount of cheese.  I tasted the mixture before the second cup of cheese and it was wonderful.  I should have stopped at that. The second cup of cheese made MY particular batch TOO rich. Other than that, I LOVED this recipe. It will be my new go to recipe for Chicken Fettucine Alfredo.

Loved this so much! I made my own noodles using Chef John's recipe, (available on allrecipes) and absolutely loved it. It was creamy and delicious. Its only faults were mine, where I made my noodles slightly too thick, and overcooked the chicken by a smidgen. Highly recommend!

I'm all for lightening a recipe but this wasn't "alfredo" at ALL in my opinion.  It was a good flavor with the garlic but not alfredo-ish.  I couldn't get it to thicken up, and it kind of curdled even though I tempered the eggs per the directions.  It's kind of hard to judge when the broth is "reduced to 1 cup" so it's possible that I didn't reduce it enough, but other than that I followed this recipe as written and didn't care for it.

Just made this tonight.  Followed the revised instructions, reducing the chicken stock to 1 cup.  I made 1 change; I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup half and half. It was fantastic, my husband had 3 servings; I expect him to be asleep on the couch within the hour.  Excellent dish, balanced and flavorful.  I wouldn't eat this every week, but now and then, it's really REALLY good.

Oh. My. Goodness.  Soooo delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I omitted the parsley simply because I didn't have any and I only used 1 Cup of fresh Parmesan because I don't love cheese.  I tasted it just before I was supposed to add the second cup of cheese and thought it was perfect. 
 Even my little one who is the pickiest kid on the planet raved! 
 She even asked to take some to school for lunch.  That in and of itself is a victory!!  This is absolutely one of my fav's from Chef John.  Well done Sir, you did it again!!

I have to laugh when someone changes four ingredients in a recipe and doesn’t give it 5 stars. This Chicken Alfredo is delicious made as is, and the omission of butter means the leftovers heat up without the oil separating out. It is time intensive, so I save it for my day off when I’m not worn out from work. My family loves this as much or more than original Alfredo sauce!

Perfect. Didn’t use the parsley, added rotisserie chicken and bacon. Very tasty. Try next time with real Parmesan, not the green can stuff.

This was absolutely delicious. I was skeptical at first about cooking the chicken breast in broth, since I would normally pan fry to seal in the juices. However, it turned out great. Hubby forgot to pick up heavy cream, so we used some half and half we had on hand along with some nonfat milk. It still turned out incredibly thick and rich, probably thanks to the egg yolks. Instead of parsley, I added chopped fresh basil along with some fresh spinach for color. This is a really great recipe - better than any restaurant alfredo I have ever had.

Made as specified, this serves four but there only two of us, so had leftovers. The second round was actually better than the first!!!

I ended up leaving out the chicken from the final product  (boiled it in the broth and saved it for another use).  
And due to time constraints,  I poured the whisked eggs right into the warm cream broth mixture, and melted all of the the cheese into the mixture as well, stirring with a whisk then poured sauce over the cooked fettucini. Excellent flavor!  Extra sauce reheated well (whisked) in a saucepan.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I'll tell you what, making the Alfredo sauce made the recipe taste a whole lot fresher

I made this for friends. We always experiment  on each other with new dishes and we all love Fettuccine Alfredo. I did not use the egg yolks and it was still wonderful and creamy. I would defiantly make it again. Cheers to Chef John, one of my favorites chefs.

Definitely a lighter version, not so alfredo-ish. I would cook the fettuccini to package directions of 12 minutes or maybe 10-11. the 7 minutes suggested wasn't long enough. The chicken took a few minutes longer as well to be done. It was a good "clean" dish...better/healthier than using any packaged/jarred Alfredo.

Instead of using heavy cream I used coconut milk  so 90 calories for the 2 cups instead of 1642 calories for the heavy cream 
Coconut milk thickens up really nicely as it it is heated. YUM

Super yummy!!! Made it exactly as written, except I added a head of broccoli. I was a bit labor intensive for a weeknight meal, but it makes plenty for two people. After making it Sunday evening we will have enough leftovers for a few days.

This was a good solid dish that the whole family enjoyed. However I do have a couple of complaints which is why it only gets the 4 stars. The main issue I had was that there was nowhere near enough chicken. Needs to be doubled, if not tripled. The other issue was that my sauce never really thickened, so I added some light sour cream (my usual trick to thickening a cream based sauce) which thickened it slightly, but due to the added liquid I then had way too much sauce. Think I will have a bit of a play around with this one to get it to what I want, but in any case the whole family gobbled it up so it will be made again.

Very simple recipe to follow for this delicious comfort food dish. I would guess that the lack of any butter, oil, or excessive amount of cheese would garner a "lightér" distinction. I will absolutely make this again. I've made several other recipes from Chef Jon, and I have enjoyed the majority of them. Thanks!

Light?  With 2 cups of heavy cream and two egg yolks?  I'll go back to butter/ olive oil and milk  or half and half.  Milk does work.

I really like the flavor but followed the recipe exactly and still ended up with a runny sauce. I will definitely make it again though. I really enjoyed the lightness of the dish compared to tradition heavy alfredo recipes.
