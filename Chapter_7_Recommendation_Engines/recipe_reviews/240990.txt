This recipe is very similar to the one I currently use (South Beach Diet).  Instead of water I use the liquid from the can of chick peas.

LOVED this! I did add a bit of salt, but other than that, this was perfect for us! Instead of using water to get the right consistency, I used the reserved liquid from the chickpeas b/c that's how I always do it. Really, REALLY great flavor! I will absolutely be using this recipe often~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Turned out delicious! No changes needed, but this is a great recipe to add different spices or swap ingredients like basil, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes etc. This is my new go to hummus recipe :)

This is the best hummus I've made yet. I added some lime zest and salt, otherwise made no recipe changes.

The name says it all.  Very well balanced simple hummus with a kick.  Like many others I prefer to use the reserved chickpea liquid instead of water for attaining the desired consistancy

This was great hummus! We loved the kick the cayenne added. Like others, I used the liquid from the chickpeas in place of water.

Husband really liked this one. I did add salt. I really liked how red it gets from the paprika and cayenne. I would add that oil (best) and the juice from the can (2nd best) are both a lot better than water at emulsifying this into a wonderful consistency, like storebought, but you may want to avoid one or the other or both for dietary needs etc. A nice strong olive oil, and lots of it, is preferred by the DH for hummus! Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have tahini, so I used a glop of peanut butter instead. Two cloves of garlic were added along with lemon instead of lime juice. Totally nummers and easy-peasy!

This recipe is very, very good as is! This was my first time making my own hummus and really loved it. I will make this again definitely. I will follow the suggestions of the cook related to test the recipe with different canned chickpeas and different amounts of tahini to see the outcomes. I really recommend it!

Made as posted, except for using only half of the cayenne because of the children. After tasting it, I found it needed some salt. Even after adding that, it still was lacking the hummus flavor you get at the middle  Eastern restaurants ! It was good but needed either more tahini, garlic or more lemon juice ?

Made mine with cannellini beans, cut the cayenne to 1/2tsp but added dash of chipotle, used somewhat less than 1/4 C lemon juice,  added dash of kosher salt, no water needed.  Important thing was 'Mama' liked it!

Yum!  I did add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and substituted lemon juice for lime juice because that's what I had on hand.  I also reduced the cayenne pepper by half.  I didn't need to add water.

I thought this was great!  It did need a pinch of salt.  Nice amount of spice.  I did thin it with water and it was fine.  I will make it again for sure.  Might be nice on a sandwich???

This was delicious. I will definitely use the liquid from the can of chickpeas instead of water next time. I felt like there was something missing, but not sure what. Maybe it was salt as another reviewer mentioned. It all got eaten, so I will make it again. My son mentioned that it tastes much better at room temperature or slightly warm.
