Outstanding!! This is a wonderful recipe for chocolate granola. I used Blue Agave syrup in place of the honey and was hoping it wouldn't ruin the recipe and it didn't, it worked well. I couldn't help myself and added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds. I didn't have flax meal and added nothing more because of it. I patted in down on the sheet and baked and cooled as instructed for a chunky texture. Perfect hint of chocolate that doesn't overtake the oatey wholesome goodness so it still tastes like granola and not a candybar. This is a keeper! Thanks CC for sharing.

The first time I tried this recipe, I had no wheat or oat bran so I doubled the flaxmeal and added a 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. Heavy dose of fiber for the kids and they all love it, so I have kept these modifications each time I make it. We eat it in chunks and I'll sometimes mix it while baking for a finer texture and mix it in plain yogurt. My daughter even puts it in a splash of milk to eat it like cereal. Big hit here, and finding something that all three kids will love is no small feat, almost impossible.

This is a wholesome chocolatey treat that we absolutely love at our house.  I first made this when it was a personal recipe before it became kitchen approved.  My daughter loves it as a snack on its own…I add it to my yogurt and cereal for a delicious crunch and we all top our frozen yogurt with it when there is any left.  I usually stick to the recipe except for the odd extra handful of chocolate chips.  Also I watch the baking time fairly closely as I like it crispy but not overdone.  Thank you CC loves to bake… we love your granola.

I love this stuff! Since I didn't have wheat or oat bran, I increased flaxseed meal to 1/2 cup, added 1 T cocoa, and 1 cup crisped rice (toasted) for a bit of extra crunch.  It would have tasted just as good without the extras though.  I will definitely be making it again.   Excellent!

Made this recipe several times now and love it! Just enough chocolate taste without overpowering the oats. It's a good simple chocolate/oat base recipe if you feel like playing around with add ins like nuts or dried fruit.
