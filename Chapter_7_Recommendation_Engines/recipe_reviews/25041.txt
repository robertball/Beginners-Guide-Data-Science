These were well-received by my husband and the rest of his police crew. I used half brown sugar and half white, plus half butter and half Crisco. I would cut the flour down a little since they were a touch dry. Definitely a cakey-cookie, like the consistency of a pumpkin cookie. Also, grated the zucchini instead of chopped. Thanks for the recipe.

These are delicious!  I doubled the amount of chocolate and used chocolate chunks instead of the mini chips. My husband could not stop eating, and he avoids everything with zucchini :)

Different but good.  Light, cakey but definitly needed more chocolate to add flavor, I used 1.5-2 cups of Milk Chocolate Chips.  (Chocolate makes almost anything good :) ) I added 1 cup of chopped Walnuts.  My husband thought they were ok but suggested I try raisins next time instead of Chocolate. (He's not a big chocolate fan)  Not a bad idea!  I will try this again!

Eaten before they made it to the cookie jar.  Soft, moist, deliciously different type of zucchini cookie.  Make these instead of zucchini bread every time!  

Doubled recipe and used a whole bag of chocolate chips, result was a delightful balance of chocolate and zucchini - although the diced zucchini tastes more like chopped dates than zucchini (which is a good thing).
 
Double recipe made 13 dozen cookies using medium cookie scoop.

This recipes was a good idea but needs some tweaking. For one, it is overly sweet. I think next time I would cut the sugar and use some brown sugar instead of white. The cookies have a nice flavor otherwise  and a cakey consistency but they are very filling. I used slightly more chips than called for and that was good if not too chocolatey.

Made these to take to a picnic and had to bake a second batch.  Husband, daughter and grandkids ate the whole first batch and said "nana, this is a keeper"

Wonderful! Our garden did well this year, so I've gone a little overboard with putting carrots and squash into everything I make... so I didn't put 1 and a half cups of zucchini, because my husband wanted me to bake something "normal"...ha ha. With closer to a half cup of zuks, no one else in the family could tell they weren't regular chocolate chippers. They did turn out puffy, not flat, and have a cute little shape. I used one cup of regular sized semi-sweet chips. Awesome!

I followed this recipe exactly and got fantastic results!  I have made these 4 times this summer and my friends and family are asking for more.  I have passed this recipe on and it will be my permanent chocolate chip cookie recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

This is a great way to use up zucchini!!  These cookies are sooo moist and stay soft for days!  I put my zucchini in the food processor so it was baby food consistency...delicious cookies...my husband hates zucchini and is begging me to make these all the time!

WOW...These are to die for.  I wasn't sure if they would flatten since the batter is a little thinner than regular cookies, but they turned out perfect.  Followed the directions exactly.  Like little cookie cakes...I'm going to double the batch and freeze some.  Wow!

I used the recipe as listed except i used 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  HUGE success.  I have already had 2 recipe requests from co-workers and hubby (the chololate chip Guru) asked me to get them out of the house so he wouldn;t eat them all!  great recipe thanks!

My kids (who hate zucchini) loved these cookies. I used raspberry chocolate chips as I did not have any mini ones. I will make these again. A great way to use some extra zucchini, especially for vegetable hating kids.

I make these every year and they are always well received. My oldest often asks when I will be making them again. I don't make any changes to the recipe and love the cakey texture and hint of cinnamon.

These are delicious!  I used a food processor to finely grate the zucchini and it was barely noticeable in the cookie.  I also used a whole package of milk chocolate chips.  This recipe made 5 dozen cookies using a medium scoop.

I really liked these! The flavor is terrific, and it's always a winner in my book when you can add in a serving of veggies to a treat. I squeezed out some of the excess moisture from my zucchini before mixing in, and think it's probably best to do so - so your batter isn't too wet. You may want to chill the dough between batches too - my last batch started to spread. The zucchini gives these cookies a bit of a "cake like" texture - so my son called them "cakies". :) They're very tasty! I didn't change any of the ingredients up, made as written. Bake time for me was closer to 18 minutes per batch at 350.

I liked it, but DH and 5 year old did not..too much like a "healthy cookie"..zucchini was tooi recognizeable.  Maybe more choc chips and finer chopping of Z?  But otherwise like and cakey...not sweet at all.

Very good alternative to zucchini bread!  I used a little extra egg, and it make a soft cakey-type cookie.  A tasty snack or dessert.

OMG!  My whole family loved them.  The only thing different I did was I used real butter not margarine and I used 2 cups of zucchini but instead of chopped finely, I shredded it.  I will definitely make them again.  I also doubled my batch so my hubby who is a nurse could take them to work and share with his fellow nurses and they loved them.  Several asked for the recipe.
