This tart did not set up.  It was runny and not edible.

Such a poor little recipe!  I have honey that's beginning to crystallize so I thought I would give this one a chance and try it.  Very very easy--I had to find a crust recipe (used the no roll pie crust I on here) which was the hardest part.  I used almonds instead of walnuts since bf doesn't like walnuts, and went from there.    The edges weren't brown and it wasn't set at 25 min, so I baked it 20 more minutes.  If I had left it, I have a suspicion it wouldve been fine.  In the last 10 or so min I baked it (during the extra time), the honey did start to boil over but if you watch it you can avert a cleaning disaster in your oven.  It never set in the oven but sets as it cools, so I may not have needed to bake it longer anyway.  This is extremely nutty, and reminds me of a really nutty baklava.  I think I'd cut down the nuts next time and maybe just make it on a sheet pan and layer it like a baklava.  For all of that, though, this recipe didn't deserve 1 measly star and no reviews for 7 years!  If you like baklava, you will probably like this, and it is definitely less work!  thanks for the recipe!

I haven't cut it yet.  Looks beautiful....BUT, even though I had pie on baking sheet, honey bubbled up and spilled over baking sheet and all over oven...mess to clean up.  BUT IF IT TASTES GOOD, I will put sheet of alumninum foil in bottom of oven next time to catch honey!

I used a ready-to-bake crust and this turned out very well... it does taste like a baklava.  After reading the other posts, I cooked at 350 for 25 min. then watched it for an additional 10 minutes and took it out of the oven when the entire pie was bubbling.  It set up nicely as it cooled.  And because I kept an eye on it the last 10 minutes, the filling didn't spill. Very, very easy recipe.
