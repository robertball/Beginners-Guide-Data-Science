I am not a big fan of eggplant, but I grew up eating this dish.  I absolutely love it...just as my mom made it.  You can make it as mild or spicy as you like it.  This was always a dish we brought to potluck dinners.

I love eggplant casserole!  It is a staple for any true cajun family.  My grandmother has made this for years; however, I do not think she ever added the fennel bulb.  Other than that...it is delicious!  PS If you do not care for eggplant, put it in a food processor, so there will not be any large chunks to bite into.

Made this with all lean ground beef, town rice and fennel powder instead of bulb -- was very good and different.
Thanks Casseopeia!

I did not use oil, butter, bread crumbs or fennel bulb(didn't have). I cut recipe in half and used 1/2 lb. very lean grd. meat and cooked it with the onion, grn pepper, celery & garlic powder. I steamed cut up eggplant with a little water in micro for 5 min. Added rice and drained eggplant to cooked meat/veg mix. I seasoned with Tony's creole seasoning. It seemed dry so I added an 8oz can of tomato sauce before baking for 30 min. We added cheddar cheese and it was very good.

Lots of steps if you follow the recipe sequentially... next time I will multi-task. And cook eggplant in microwave, much easier! I didn't bake it with bread-crumbs and butter but the flavor was great, will definitely make it again!

I thought this recipe was great, but I followed all of the directions to a T on the eggplant and it ended up mushy! I felt like it was very overcooked based on all of the different steps. Next time I will probably just dice it and use it in the casserole.

Like most things I cook, the recipe is more a guide than a rule. That being said, this was an amazing dish!! I cheated & cooked the onion, garlic, meat, celery, peppers, and eggplant together. I totally skipped the extra steps with the eggplant. I did slice it, cover with salt, pepper, & garlic, and let sit while cooking the rice and meat mixture. Then I cubed the eggplant & mixed in with meat, and cooked rice. Then baked at 350Â°for 30 min. It was awesome!! Thanks.

Very good recipe!  Thanks so much for submitting this.  I have a friend bringing me eggplants all the time now!   I added more rice.   I used ground meat but I do plan on using sausage next time!  You could even use sliced or cubed sausage in place of ground.   
I probably added too much salt to the eggplant when sweating it, so I did rinse, and then didn't add anymore salt at all, to the meat or the rice.  
I skipped the butter, as I didn't have unsalted, but that certainly provides more flavor and moistness.  I skipped the breadcrumbs, and added Parmesan cheese flakes to the top.

This was soooo good!  The only change I made was using less eggplant. I only used one. Just delicious.

I coated the Eggplant with onion salt, and put more celery and onion in than was requested... I also used the stalk of the fennel as well as the bulb...I didn't have French bread, so I used regular bread on half and for my husband who is trying to avoid bread, I used rice cakes for the top. After tasting it we also added a little mayo to make it a little more creamy.

This recipe is the bomb! I make this dish quite often. I make it spicy and also weaker for the family members with the weaker stomachs. I made a few changes just like everyone does. I use brown rice instead of white, I added mushrooms , A bunch more garlic cloves, Also use a can of diced tomato ( like someone else mentioned) to keep it moist. Comes out great every time! so glad I found this recipe. I am asked to make it for every pot luck dinner . thanks, Dan
