This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!  I have made it three/four times since I found it with different variations, though I am rating for the recipe itself.  Definitely 5 stars!!!  After reading through the reviews, please take into account the cooking time of each vegetable and adjust the size you cut them accordingly.  Suggestions to change it up would be:  1.)  Instead of plain olive oil, try the garlic olive oil - gives it a great taste.  2.)  Instead of olive oil, use Wishbone Italian dressing.  3.)  Add onions, whole garlic cloves and quartered mushrooms (must be quartered as whole mushrooms give off to much moisture).  4.)  Add Parmesan or Asiago cheese to the bread crumbs.  5.)  Change up the bread crumbs to the Italian variety - goes great with the Italian dressing.  6.)  Try panko crumbs or the Italian panko crumbs - which are fabulous in place of the bread crumbs.   Thanks Jana for submitting such a great and easy recipe!!!

Made this without the pepper, and it was still excellent.  The bread crumbs keep the zucchini from feeling too soft or "slimy" (as my kids say), so even the non-zucchini eaters thought this was delicious.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except added onions and cut the potatoes in slices, not chunks.  It cooked in exactly one hour, and the flavor of the red peppers after roasting is amazing!  I did not stir the vegetables at all during cooking, and I loved the way one side of the potato was extra cripsy and brown, while the other side was a bit softer, but not mushy at all.  This dish is excellent and I would definitely make it again.

Ive made this a few times now, each with a slight variation.  Follow the exact recipe and i give it 4 stars.  A couple changes and its a 5 star dish!  My 5 star rendition...used seasoned breadcrumbs and bump it up to 2/3 cup...add a tablespoon or two more of olive oil to compensate for the additional breadcrumbs.  If you dont mind a few extra calories, throw in about 1/3 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese with the breadcrumbs.  Use red skinned potatoes...they have a more more desirable texture and a sweeter flavor that complements the zucchini much better.  Step up the Bell Pepper just a little too...either one large one or two smaller ones.  I like to add one green and one red for some extra variety.  After the potatoes are tender, i put the entire dish in the broiler for a minute or two to give everything a nice, even browning which gives it a VERY delicious crispy outside....just watch it closely...it will burn REALLY fast if you let it!  You just want a nice, even golden browning across the entire dish.  Toss and serve.

This dish is amazing! With a hint of spice and juicy veggies. One hour of bake time was perfect for the potatos. My parents, brother and boyfriend loved it. I reccommend this dish for a family get-together. I would just decrease the amount of bread crumbs. Other then that, it was fabulous.

My fiance and I have been looking for recipes to provide to our friend who is catering our wedding.  I made this dish last night with dinner, modifying things just a bit.  I added 1 medium onion, parmesan cheese (as recommended in other reviews), and used seasoned salt instead of paprika.  The result was exceptional!  It was a hit with everyone, including the caterer!  This is one recipe that will definitely be made again and again around our house!

This recipe is so simple and soooo good!  Hard to believe you can get such a lovely flavor from so few ingredients.  I've made this several times now and really enjoy it - the kids, too!  I cut the veggies a bit smaller and spread them out to roast in a jelly roll pan, stirring occasionally - you can reduce the cooking time to 30-40 minutes with smaller pieces.  I've served this dish with fish, meat, chicken, whatever - it can't miss!

I've made this twice. The first time I baked it at 350 and it didn't get crispy enough.  The second time, I used less olive oil and bread crumbs and substituted garlic powder.  I'll definitely make this again.  It tastes great reheated, too.

This was an excellent recipe for zucchini, I just put it under the broiled for a few minutes to brown it more. Definitely will make many more times.

A wonderful recipe, came out perfect! I made a few changes..I used Italian Breadcrumbs and added 1/4 cup of parmesan per others' suggestions (also omitted the paprika). I left the skin on the potatoes. I added an extra clove of garlic to the veggies. I also added a medium onion, large dice. Tossed all the veggies first in oil in a large ziplock, then in a separate ziplock, tossed the veggies in the breadcrumb mixture (tossed in two batches to ensure veggies were evenly coated). I am looking forward to making this again this weekend as a side dish for a BBQ!!

This was very, very good. The biggest surprise was that my boyfriend went crazy for it. I wasn't sure he would even eat zucchini, but he had seconds of this! Followed recipe exactly, except I used a green bell pepper since that is what I had on hand. I did also add about a 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese to the mixture. I will be making this often, thank you!

What a surprise this was!  Another great way to use up extra zucchinis.  Was really tasty.  I also added the parmesan as other reviews suggested & wouldn't make it without that.  Plus as I had bacon on hand I added some chopped bacon.  We ate it as a main dish just as is but will make it again as a side dish for others.  Makes a great meal either way.  Plus it was easy!  Chop up & mix & chuck it in the oven.  Did take a little longer to cook that suggested but could have been my variety of potato.  Yummo!

I used panko bread crumbs as another reviewer suggested. For some added flavor I added about 1/2 cup chopped red onion. Turned this into a one- dish meal when I cooked and added sliced turkey kielbasa after it was baked. Will use this again. Was a hit with my family. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Used some yellow squash in place of one potato and it was delish! Cut potato pieces smaller than the rest so that it cooks evenly. Didn't stir, which left the top crispy.

This is an excellent recipe. Its our favorite vegetable recipe for the summer. I always add eggplans, 2 or 3 depending on the size, 1 or 2 tomatoes diced, 1 medium onion,  2 bay leaves, or parcley and 2 or 3 cloves of garlic. If you add some feta cheece ten minutes before you take out of the oven, its a complete meal. You just need some fresh bread for an excellent healthy meal!

The easiest and most rewarding meal I have ever made. It also works as a side dish with pretty much everything. I added some carrots and yellow squash for a more colorful presentation and oregano which improved the aroma.

We really enjoyed this.  I didn't have any red pepper on hand, so I subbed red onion.  I also had some mushrooms that needed to be used up, so I added them as well.  The only suggestion that I would have is to start the potatoes about 20 minutes before the rest of the vegetables if you like your veggies crisp-tender.  This way the potatoes can be cooked through without overcooking the rest of the veggies.  Hubby liked it a lot too!  Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't really impressed.  The only flavor was the italian breadcrumbs.  I cubed the potatoes and left the zucchini in bigger chunks, so I didn't have a problem with the cooking time.  My kids picked the potatoes out and left the pepper and zucchini, hubby said it was just okay.  Won't make again as is- maybe if it had tomatoes, or other veggies, and I added cheese it would be tastier.

Very good flavor.  The potatoes were perfect tenderness, but the zucchini was just mush.  I prefer my zucchini a with a little crispness, so next time I think I'll add mine halfway through baking.  I'm sure I will make this again though.  Super easy! Oh, and next time I'll spray the bottom of the dish with Pam, because even with the oil in the recipe, everything was sticking.

This one is a keeper after my wife said, no less than three times, "mmm...this is really tasty" during dinner. I used panko crumbs,instead of bread crumbs, and they worked really well.

This is fantabulous!! I never had any peppers so I replaced them with some sweet onion and mushrooms. This was such an easy but delicious side dish. I would advise though to kepp this covered as my zucchini was done and the potatoes were not. Thanx for sharing. Will make again.

This was SOOOO good!! I added half of a chopped onion and I used almost a full pack of ritz crackers for my bread crumbs. SOOOO good! It taste like fried potatoes and zucchini without frying!  Make sure you bake a full hour for the crispness!

I personally thought it needed a lot more spices, so I added chilly flakes, Marjoram, oregano. Besides that, it was easy to make and awesome for a quick dinner!

OOOOhhhh sooo goooood. I used cornmeal instead of bread crumbs but this was still amazing. I also added little chunks of tofu for protein since I'm vegetarian. LOVED it!

Good and easy side dish. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. Onions would be a nice addition next time

VERY TASTY! Although the zucchini was kinda mushy. I added mushrooms instead of bell peppers but it ended up tasting really good!

Delicious!  Used some minced garlic, and added Parmesan cheese as suggested in other reviews.  Zucchini was slightly mushy, but still awesome!

when i make something from this site, i follow the recipe as written then rate it on the outcome - second time add or subtract according to my taste.  that being said - this was loved by all and the next time i make this i may add onions (we love onions).
Great side dish.

Outstanding.  My husband and I alone ate most of this, which was supposed to be enough for 6.  I omitted the bread crumbs and sprinkled on rosemary instead of paprika, omitted pepper.

Absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again. Just make sure you cut the potato smaller so you don't overcook the zucchini. My zucchinis were a little too mushy for my taste. I added some Parmesan cheese right before serving and it really added great flavor!

Wow, this is one the best side dishes I've made!  I love this recipe.  There are no changes needed, it's perfect as is.  However, that didn't stop me from adding my own touches.  I added yellow squash (love the buttery taste) and about 1/4 cup parm. cheese.  Sooo good!

i have NEVER had a problem with eating too many vegetables (desserts, yes, but never vegetables) and i couldnt stop eating this dish.  YUM YUM YUM!  the zucchini was excellent.  i used red potatoes and didnt peel them.  i added chunks of onion and  used minced garlic.  would be good with carrots and yellow  squash.  great recipe!  thanks for sharing!

I did change this a bit, based on what I had and what I like.  I upped the garlic by a clove, and reduced the oil by half.  I added parmesan and a red onion.  Left out the red pepper because I didn't have one(but I can't wait to try it with that!).  My only complaint is the zucchini was a little mushy after an hour in the oven.  I will make this again though!

This was quick, easy and really good. It was a tiny bit bland, but I think that may be because I used the dehydrated minced onion. Next time I'll either use the wet kind or fresh garlic. I added a generous sprinkle of garlic powder and a bit of cayenne pepper for kick and this was really good, especially on the potatoes.

This didn't work that well for me. The zucchini was well-done, but even after an hour and a quarter of cooking, the potatoes were still hard. I also found this a bit dry.

I followed the advice of others and added Parmesan to the recipe.  I didn't have a red bell pepper,  so instead I added about 1/4 cup of chopped green pepper.  I noticed after 30 minutes that it seemed a bit dry and was worried it would burn, so I turned the oven down to 325 for the last 30 minutes.  It turned out wonderful!

Can I give this 6 stars?? Loved it! After reading reviews I did add garlic and onion powder. I used red potatoes cut same size as zucchinni. Everything had this great crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.

I love this recipe. Like another reviewer said be sure to adjust the size of your veggies so that they cook. If the potatoes are too large they zucchini will be mushy by the time they cook. I will definitely put this on my rotation and next time I will add some Parmesan cheese. I think that will taste excellent. Thanks so much for this easy delicious recipe. UPDATE I  made this last night but mixed 42g (.7 oz)  dry Italian dressing to the olive oil. Wow that kicked it up a notch flavour wise. I cooked this covered this time and I preferred that method.

This recipe was a hit in our house!  I added chopped onion, a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, one chopped yellow squash, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, and 1 cup cheddar jack.  It popped with flavor and the dish was empty after dinner.  Four teenage boys gobbled it down!  I love healthy meals! :)

Yummy-- I don't want to stop eating it!  Made just as stated except cut the potatoes into smallish chunks (~ 1 centimeter).  Mixed every 15 minutes while baking.  After 1 hour of baking, it wasn't brown, but everything was soft, so I went ahead and took it out and am quite happy with it.

Loved it. Changes I made were just because I was limited to what I had in the house. I ended up using more zucchini, less potato. Adding green pepper and thick chopped carrots. Then I added the oil, coating everything. And used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs to coat it all. Would definitely make it again!

This was really good. I peeled the zucchini but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I think the next time I make it I will add a little more red pepper. A great way to combine veggies and starches into one dish.

Great side dish! So easy to throw together. To cut down the cooking time, dice the potatoes a little smaller. My hubs said the leftovers would be a great idea to make omelets.

Delicious! Although I'd call it a Potato and Zucchini Bake, because it's much heavier on the potatoes. I added thyme, oregano, and Spike herb seasoning, increased the garlic, and topped each serving with Parmesan. It went very well with Wisconsin Native's Beer Cheese Soup, also from this site--if you dip a little into the soup, it tastes like a loaded baked potato!

Used 4 small zucchini, 6 potatoes, 1/2 large onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup olive oil. Added Parmesan cheese. Bland. Needs something. Pan fry instead of baking.

This was good, but nothing amazing. I might have picked out potatoes that were too large, or zucchini that was too small, but the ratio of potatoes to zuchhini was overwhelming. I didn't think the dish was too mushy or soggy as some other reviews. I believe my boyfriend mixed the veggies around a little when he made this dish. Next time we will use 3 potatoes and 2 zucchini and 1 summer squash and an onion. And maybe some carrots or eggplant. This isn't a dish I'd make to impress anyone, but it's definitely a nice hearty homecooked side to have around and I'll probably be making it (with adjustments) again.

I made this for dinner tonight. I saw the picture today and had all the ingredients. I thought it was quite good. I did cut the potatoes smaller after reading some of the reviews, but other than that made it exactly. The bread crumbs made a nice little coating on the veggies. I thought the seasoning was fine, didn't find it bland like other reviewers.  I put everything in a well sprayed 9" X 13" Pyrex baking dish after spraying and dumping everything in an 8"square and realizing it was WAY too small, so that might be something to include in the recipe. The only thing I would do differently next time is to add onions, as I like them in vegetable medleys and perhaps a yellow summer squash for color. Oh...and there's no way that's 6 servings, 3 or 4 tops unless theyr'e all children who don't like their veggies.

I omitted the red bell pepper because I am not a big fan of them and the recipe was still very good and a nice way to get some veggies in. It didn't save that well though, so next time I will probably half the recipe to avoid wasting leftovers.

Oh-my-goodness!! What a tasty recipe! I cut the bread crumbs down to 1/3 cup and used a green pepper (it's what I had on hand). I also added chopped onion and a bit more garlic. I fried up some marinated, chopped chicken and turned this recipe into a main dish. I also added romano cheese as suggested from other reviewers. This could also double as a breakfast dish with some eggs from the leftovers, although there were no leftovers. My hubby and 2 year old daughter loved it to much!

I loved this!  I am doing Weight Watchers so I am always looking for good Veggie recipes.  I did however use Whole Wheat Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs!  It was awesome!  I am making it AGAIN tonight!

YUM!!!  I had to sub a green bell pepper, because that's what I had on hand, and crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  Both of my kids went back for seconds!!  Definitely going to keep this in our regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

It was good, but it would've been five stars without the pepper.  It just didn't mesh well for my tastes.  The only other change I made was swapping the olive oil for veggie since I didn't have olive on hand.  Will make again sans pepper.  Thanks Jana.  :)  To the reviewer who said her zucchini was soggy by the time the potatoes were done:  you must cut your ingredients approximately the same size (the potatoes slightly smaller).  Bear in mind the potatoes are more dense than the zucchini, therefore they take longer to cook.  Next time try cutting your veggies and potatoes to suit.

FANTASTIC! i sautéed some bite size chicken breast and mushrooms and threw that in to make a complete meal out of it! i wish i would have cut up the potatoes more because some of them were a little hard. i did slash some lemon juice on top but i don't think it changed the taste. all in all it was fantastic and i might even double the zucchini and skip the potatoes next time.

I've made this at least a dozen times since July.  Everyone loves it sometimes I'll add the parmesan, sometimes not. I also sometimes add more of one ingredient one time and next time something else, depending on the mood we're in

Even with the spices it was a little bland tasting, every one liked it though and we will have it again but will add different spices next time, also I will use yellow squash instead of the zucchini and I will lower the temp. to about 325 degrees instead of the 400 temp. because it started to burn, over all a really good recipe.

I never knew how much I could love zucchini! I was out of garlic cloves so I used garlic powder which seemed to even up the flavor. We loved this dish! Next time I want to add Parmesan cheese for another flavor to the dish. Love this recipe!! Kid approved!

Delicious! This is a fun flavorful way to serve up potatoes and veggies at the same time. It's great the way it is, but I've tweaked it a few different times to suit the people at my table. The best (and easiest!) I've tried is to replace the seasonings with a tbsp of onion soup mix. My husband called it restaurant quality! Not sure about that! But it's been added to our menu at least once a week. Serve it with marinated  pork or chicken grilled up on a George Foreman grill for an easy meal any time!

Followed exactly, added onion and extra garlic. Lacked flavor to us. Maybe because in Texas we use a lot of seasoning. Did italian breadcrumbs too. Lots of paprika. Scanned recipe twice, not sure what I missed?

This was an interesting change, and a good way to use up some sliced veggies left over from a BBQ. My biggest complaint is that everything else cooks faster than the potatoes, so at 1 hr I had perfectly cooked potatoes but burned peppers and onions. Next time I'll either slice the potatoes instead of quartering them so they'll cook faster, or pre-cook the potatoes in the microwave or boiling water so everything will be done in 30 mins.

This was great.  I've had this saved in my recipe box forever and I'm sorry I waited so long to make it.  I did as reviewer Crystal S. suggested and used fat free italian dressing in place of the olive oil to save on fat/calories.  I also used garlic powder instead of sliced garlic, as I was afraid it would burn.  I mixed the garlic powder and the other seasonings with the bread crumbs.  One hour was the perfect amount of time.

This was a nice side dish with some teriyaki chicken we made on the grill.  I didn't have peppers in the house so I just doubled the zucchini and used panko breadcrumbs.  I always salt my potatoes before roasting for better flavor.

Mr. LTH loved this!  It wasn't my very favorite, but it was good and pretty easy to make.  I think my main issue was the zucchini texture and I believe that was my error in cutting it into too small of pieces; I'll leave them larger next time.  I followed the recipe, though I did reduce the olive oil to 2T to lighten it up a bit and added some shaker parm per previous reviewers, as well as some mushrooms (which were a wonderful addition).  Thanks for the recipe, Jana!

Very good side dish. My only issue was that I didn't cut the zucchini in large enough chuncks so they were a little to soft. Next time I will make them larger. Also added some parm. cheese. So good!

So simple and so basic... this recipe is truely easy to make with simple ingredients... great combination of vegetables.. there are so many options with this recipe... next time i might use italian dressing or butter, add onions or different spices... the first time i used italian bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand it tasted good

One of my favorite ways to prepare veggies is roasting them, but I had never thought or heard of mixing bread crumbs in. Gives a really nice texture. Made a smaller batch and roasted in the toaster oven. I used granulated garlic instead of fresh because I thought fresh slices would burn. I also used lemon-pepper seasoning instead of paprika to better compliment the main dish, Parmesan Sage Pork Chops also on this site. Make sure the zucchini is in quite large pieces compared to the potatoes since zucchini cook much faster. Mine came out a little too mushy by the time the potatoes were golden (my fault, not the recipe's). I also added a carrot chunks since I had one to use up. Nice addition. I'll be doing this often!

Pretty good. I loved the crispy crunch of the bread crumbs. I broiled it all for 4 minutes after baking and used carrots instead of red pepper, since I didn't have any on hand. It was a little bland, but I used powder garlic. Next time I'll use real garlic and add real onions too maybe.

I ended up needing quite a bit more seasoning to suite our tastes, but other than that I thought it was pretty good. Next time I will cut the zucchini and peppers a little bigger, since they cooked a lot quicker than the potatoes, and we like our veggies a little more crisp.

I love this recipe! I make it ALL the time as a side dish to just about anything. It's also wonderful as leftovers. Just add eggs for breakfast or chicken and rice for lunch. Perfect as is but I sometimes add a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the top =)

This was really good :). I think next time I may add a bit more garlic and seasoning, and it definitely needs a little ketchup. I am thinking next time to mix it up with some eggs as a dinner dish. Thank you for a nice recipe :).

This was a great pairing with tonight's steak.  I used one zucchini and one yellow squash because that's what I had.  Combined with the red pepper and potatoes, this was very flavorful as well as colorful.  Will definitely make again - Thanks!

Very good recipe.  I only adjusted the bread crumbs (1/4 cup), 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1, added savory herbs and omitted the paprika.  I also roasted on a silpat on a cookie sheet, tossing 3 times during the hour baking process.  This will go in my permanent files.  Since we are vegans, in our household this would only yield 3 servings.

My family loved this, and can make a great main dish as well as a side.  I added lots more chopped garlic and onion, and followed another reviewers advice to cook the potatoes for a bit before adding the other veggies. Everything was the perfect consistency!  Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and added Parmesan like other reviewers suggested.  My non-veggie-eating 3 & 1 year-olds ate all of their veggies, and my brother said it was the best vegetable dish he has ever had.  I will be making this again!

This was ok, not great. Edible, but not something I'm planning on making again. I could see making this if you had kids and were trying to convince them to eat veggies? As an adult who love veggies, I would just prefer roasted veggies with balsamic vinegar. The breadcrumbs didn't add much to the dish.

I really wanted to like this - but I just couldn't. The bread crumbs were soggy (which is pretty gross) and that ruined the taste of the zucchini and potatoes. However, I cut potatoes small and zucchini chunkier and did not have a problem with the cooking time.  I am going to try making this again without the bread crumbs and see how it turns out. That should make cleaning the cooking dish a lot easier, too... I had to soak it for two days before I could clean it properly!

This will become a staple in my dinner rotation.  I had friends over and they raved about it.  I added a diced yellow onion, parmesan and I also tossed everything in Wegmans Basting Oil.  Turned out great!

This was pretty good. I used half an onion in place of the red pepper. I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand, so I used powdered, and while it was still tasty, I think fresh would have given a better flavor. I also didn't have any bread crumbs and didn't feel like making any, so I left them out, and added about a 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese. I used seasoned salt instead of paprika, and added some onion powder. I was a little worried about the temperature because my oven tends to cook hotter than others. So, I put it in at 350. Next time I will be sure and cook it on 400 because the potatoes weren't quite as cooked as we would have liked. The zucchini and onion were delicious, though. I think this would be superb with some asparagus and some lemon pepper. Bacon bits would be good in this too.

Delicious. I cut the pieces into smaller chunks to cut the baking time by half. I added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese into the mix, also put more than double the garlic. Used italian seasoned bread crumbs. Johnny's seasoning (we didn't have paprika) and some pepper to taste. Used red potatoes since I like the firmer texture. It turned out great!

This was ok. We may try it again, but it was a little too bland for our tastes, so I would jazz it up a little.

This came out much more flavorful than I was expecting.  I didn't have any garlic cloves, so I thinly sliced some onion and tossed the veggies with garlic powder.  I also topped the dish with some grated parmesan and a bit more bread crumbs and olive oil before baking.  Very easy and tasty!

Awesome!  Made it.  My husband love it. Gave out the recipie to my boat buddies - two of them made it.  Thought it was GREAT!  For leftovers, I put it in a frying pan, heated potatoes and put in eggs scrambled with asiago cheese.  Was a great omlette!  So, then I gave the recipie out to folks where I work. Thank you.

This was nice - a little too mushy for me. I might try again, cutting the zucchini into smaller pieces. Also, I recommend broiling for the last five minutes of cooking.

I subbed carrots for my bell pepper as we aren't huge fans of cooked bells. Added a few sprinkles of parmesan cheese towards the end, very colorful, delicious, versatile and healthy side dish, thanks for sharing!

I added a sweet onion to the mix.  This came out moist and tasty.  I like the way the breadcrumbs thickened the juice.  My husband needs his food to be moist to aide in swallowing...this dish was perfect for him.

Excellent and easy.  I cut the potatoes into thin slices instead of chunks so they would cook in the amount of time allotted.  Came out perfect!  Very nice flavor and so simple--I'll do this again.  I didn't have peppers so I just left them out, and I added a bit of dried basil.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent !!!  Added an onion and sautéed everything but the bread crumbs before finishing it off in the oven.  Everybody loved it, had to remind them that it was a side dish not a main dish !!! Will do again for sure.

I really enjoyed this dish. I added chicken and more garlic and cut the red pepper into strips instead of chopping. I sprinkled paremsan cheese on top after baking. It was wonderful and a perfect main dish.

We love to make this as a side dish when we grill steaks.  Sometimes we top it with grated parmesan and put it under the broiler for a few minutes.  Yum!

As suggested, I added some fresh parmesean cheese.  This came out great.  Out of personal preference I omitted the pepper.  But this is a great way to add zucchini (or even other veggies) into our diet.  Thanks so much!

We liked this recipe but the next time I make it I will increase the ratio of the other vegetables to the potatoes.  It came out a little dry because the potatoes and bread crumbs soaked up the olive oil.  I will decrease the bread crumbs by half.  I added a sliced red onion to recipe and used used a black pepper-garlic powder blend in place of the fresh garlic.  I find garlic tends to burn when roasting vegetables.  I will definitely make it again with a couple of tweaks.

Delicious, lots of compliments, I think this will be my contribution at Christmas dinner this year!   For a more complete meal, I would add chicken next time.
The only changes I made was added red, orange, and yellow peppers for more color and some Mrs. Dash, I used panko / parmesan blend in place of breadcrumbs.

Smelled great in the oven.  My family really liked this dish.  That's a surprise because my oldest doesn't often like potatoes.  I do wish I stirred it an extra few times (I only stirred it once after 30 min.) to avoid some slightly mushy zucchini pieces.  If I'd done that, that would've been great.  I did cover it the first 30 min to keep it moist and that worked well.  I dumped a ton of paprika on it & extra minced garlic because we like those flavors.  The bread crumbs added a nice touch and texture.  Super easy to make.  Would definitely make again.

Great recipe...not sure how somehow can say there was no flavour- unless one is cooking a  frozen veggies as vegetable on their own have a great summer flavour without even adding anything! This is a great recipe and easy to adjust  to your family's veggie preference ... 
I was making this a day ahead and was in a rush to make it all ready ....so I boiled the potatoes, and on a fry pan sauteed mushrooms on olive oil-added garlic, small carrots cut in round small pieces....once done added cut chunks of potatoes to turn gold-ish...added paprika as per recipe...but also some balsamic dressing...then added the zucchini I had yellow and green.I did not have any red peppers on hand. Once all done I transferred it all to a casserole dish , topped all with more bread crumbs and some feta and marble cheese...so its all ready to put in the oven the next day.. This is a great versatile recipe-it give a great base and ideas for your dish to adjust to your liking.

The family loved it!!!  I did make a couple of minor changes:
1.  Added onion and omit olive oil.
2. Parboiled potatoes while sauteing onion, garlic, zucchini, and bell pepper in approx 1/4 c butter.
3.  Used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and mixed in Parmesan cheese and butter for topping.

One of my new favorites! I've found that the more seasoning, the better, because it's easy to become a bit bland. I always end up adding more and more paprika even as I'm eating it. Don't be afraid to have a heavy hand with seasoning!

Loved this recipe- I have made a lot of roasted vegetables, never with breadcrumbs (after reading the reviews added some parmesan and red onions). The zucchini was perfectly cooked. Baked 45 minutes in a convection oven. Cut the potatoes smaller than the zucchini.

What a great side dish! Served it with cod dinner and everyone had seconds. Had some leftover green beans and threw them in as well. One hour is perfect timing.

Easy and delicious! I guess I cut the veggies smaller because it was done in 30 minutes. I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed crackers and tossed them in. I took someone else's suggestion and added a little Parmesan cheese. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is awesome! The only changes I made was adding salt & pepper to each layer, zucchini, potatoes,and shallots. I did not have red pepper, so shallots were used instead. Also, I used panko breadcrumbs, but seasoned with (dried herbs) One tsp. of black pepper, basil, thyme, oregano, parsley and Two tsps. Hungarian paprika. Then combined all ingredients and breadcrumbs. I will reduce the roasting time in the future.

I love this recipe!  It's easy to change to your family's tastes.  I added red onions to this as well and it's delish!  It doesn't take an hour in  my oven-it runs hot.  Sometimes I don't add bread crumbs.  I've included eggplant to this as well.  Great recipe - Thanks Jana!

This was very good! I served it as a vegetarian main dish and added a little yellow squash and some onion in with the zucchini and potatoes. It also needed a little more salt but over all it was delicious!

Okay,  I'm only giving 4 stars because my  potatoes turned out mushy.  I followed recipe exactly.  Since so many others raved about this I figure  I did something wrong.  Only thing I did...  didn't have pan big enough so used big stainless skillet.  Cooked about 30 extra minutes because potatoes were not cooked.  Then mushy!  Anyone know what I did wrong?

I used two large sweet potatoes and one large zucchini and a green bell pepper as that was what we had.  I followed all the other ingredients. I also sprinkled on what was left of our Parmesan cheese. I think it's pretty tasty. We served with a side of white rice. 

I cut the sweet potatoes and zucchini to similar sizes and it wasn't too mushy. I covered with foil for 45 minutes and removed the foil for last 15 minutes.

This was really good! We loved it the second time I tried it. The first time however wasn't as great... here's why. The recipe really only carries flavour in the breadcrumbs. if you put more breadcrumbs than the recipe calls for then its too mushy. What I did the second time was add grated parmesan cheease. I sprinkled it in before mixing and then a layer ontop while it cooled on the counter. The cheese melted ontop and the cheese incorporated into the dish was perfect!!

This is a wonderful make-ahead recipe. I had 10 people for dinner and doubled the recipe. I used Kershaw squash instead of zucchini, and added white potatoes (with skin), and sweet potatoes, as well as red peppers. I made it a day ahead and used a disposable aluminum pan. When the time came, I moved it from the frig directly to the oven. I cooked it a little longer because it was cold at the start. Delicious!

Definitely a hit. Make sure you cut the potatoes small enough so they are finished cooking at the same time as the veggies.

This was AWESOME! You can cut cook time but cutting the veggies (really, just the potatoes) a little smaller. Sometimes I throw in a handful of Parmesan cheese just to switch it up. This is a new favorite.

Note to self: Next time, if you cover with aluminum foil, take it off half way baked or it will be too moist. Yummy.

I love this recipe.  You just have to try it and then adjust it if you want.  It is so easy and tastes good.  Just give it a try.  Thanks for the recipe.  BTW- my first review and I have been using this website for over a year.  Thanks to everyone for reviews.  They really help.  Stefini.

Surprisingly very tasty but instead of plain bread crumbs,  I used Italian. I also only  stirred once halfway through cooking time

Love this recipe! It was a winner with the whole family and I'll definitely make it again.  I think next time I'll use more zucchini and bell pepper (or other veggies) and less potato to make it even healthier.

Yummy! Don't be afraid to season liberally. It can use more than what the recipe calls for.

I made it for my vegetarian daughter but all of us like this dish. I didn't realize that I was out of bread crumbs. Yikes!!! I was in the middle of the recipe with no time to stop and run to the store. I took some seasoned croutons, placed them in a zip lock bag, took my rolling pin, and rolled them into crumbs. I used them in the recipe, what a life saver, they turned out great. The only step I would do differently is add the zucchini after the dish has cooked for 30 minutes. I checked the dish half way through, and the zucchini looked awesome, but it still had a half hour to cook because of the potatoes, the zucchini was over cooked. Also, I tasted it half way through and it is bland so I added 1/4c of grated Parmesan cheese as many suggested by others. I will be making this again it is easy and good. My daughter the vegetarian gave a thumbs up.

I go to this recipe almost every time I make a side for pork chops..I read a review about this being bland and I realized that I have been adding Italian seasoning along with the paprika every time I've made this ...and its not part of the recipe..so try it with that added...my family loves this. Thanks Jana

I made this as a main dish & everyone in my family loved it. I feel like there are many things you can do with this recipe but the bread crumbs are key.

This recipe is good as is. I recommend spraying the bottom of your baking dish with non-stick cooking spray to make clean up easier. I also recommend using seasoned salt instead of regular salt for added flavor.

Good dish for winter. Potatoes require more cooking than the zucchini so I gave them a few minutes in the microwave to jump start them. I also lightened the dish in calories & gluten by eliminating the bread crumbs. BUT I bet that would have been yummy.

I was at a complete loss of what to make for dinner and happened upon this recipe, which was perfect because i only had exactly 2 zucchinis and 5 patatoes! This recipe is so easy to make and took me less than an hour. Made this for my boyfriend tonight and he absolutely loved it! Which is saying a lot since 95% of the time he just refuses to eat any veggie other than patatoes.  I added onion slices, carrots and celery, seeing as I had no bell peppers, and also added plenty of parmesan cheese! I also used Italian style breadcrumbs. Absolutely no left overs!

These were fabulous!  One of my friends had a kiddo in the hospital so this was one of the sides I took to her house.  They loved it; in fact before I took it over my husband begged me to leave a little in a bowl for him.  Tasty, easy, versatile.  I cut everything a little smaller than recommended.

This was really good.  The flavors were excellent together, but I would pre-cook potato and bell pepper and not cook as long to preserve a little texture in the zucchini.  I did add some onions and fresh grated Parmesan cheese to the mix as well.  Leftovers also went well with some tomato sauce as microwave ratatouille minus the eggplant.  Hmm, makes me think that some eggplant could work into this recipe as well.

Simply Wonderful! My only tip is to cut the zucchini a bit bigger than the potato chunks. My whole family LOVED it, including my sister who does not eat any vegetables besides corn. Thank you, I will be making this again and again!

I liked this, but no one else did.  I had to add a lot of spices and parm cheese because it was bland. I only used half the breadcrumbs, it seemed like way too much.  I cooked the potatoes alone for 30min, then added the veggies.  The potatoes were not crisp.  30min was enough time for the veggies.

Phenomenal dish!!!  I took the other reviewers advice and used Wishbone Italian dressing instead of olive oil and substituted Italian bread crumbs for the dry.  I also added parm cheese to the bread crumbs.  I had a Sunday dinner party so I doubled the recipe.  If you plan to double the recipe and want to be healthier, I would recommend using less potatoes and more veggies.

So good! Served it as a main dish and my meat loving husband said he didn't even miss not having meat in it. I use gluten free bread crumbs. When I'm in a rush I use a bag of pre cut, frozen peppers and onions. Easy peasy.

My husband is very sceptical of any dish containing zucchini, and he absolutely loved this. The only change I made was to cut all the veggies into bite-size pieces (I sliced the potatoes, not very thin) and I was able to cook it to perfection in 45 minutes. The red pepper was a wonderful addition!

Liked some things about the dish, other things not so much. I thought using the olive oil was a flavorful component. I added Parmesan to bread crumbs (as some suggested) which was very good.  Next time I will cut the potatoes a little smaller. I didn't think my potatoes were getting done enough so I covered with foil for about 15 minutes at the 30 minute mark. They didn't take the entire hour to cook. Probably because I covered them.  When I make again, I will cut the Zucchini with less of the center on to prevent mushiness. Going to change the pepper to jalapeno without the seeds and white membranes. Also, I'm going to add croutons in place of bread crumbs and of course I will add a stronger flavored cheese of some sort again. (Feta, Asiago or Parmesan.)

This is a good recipe.  I followed the recipe except I used panko breadcrumbs which crisp up nicely and used less oil.  Easy!!!

We loved this recipe! It was absolutely delicious, super easy.I used all ingredients right out of the garden. I wasn't sure about the combination of ingredients, but it was yummy. When it came out of the oven I tossed with a little butter.Perfect!

Just delicious!  I did the same as many others previously stated and added parm. cheese.  I used minced garlic when I mixed the chopped ingredients with oil and it was perfect.  This is easy, yummy, and used up tons of garden zucchini that was waiting for a good recipe.

I did not change a thing. I made it just as it said to. It was wonderful. My son even ate. I think the bacon and cheese prompted him to try it, and he loved it.

Very easy and yummy. I don't change anything except that I usually add summer squash to it for more color and to have another veggie in the dish. Even my squash hating fiance loves this. I've made it for barbecues before and people always ask for the recipe

I think this is more like 3.5 stars as is.  A very simple yet tasty recipe.  On the second attempt I used seasoned breadcrumbs and added 1/2 cup parmesean cheese, this helps quite a bit.

This is a very good way to use up all those wonderful zucchini's.  Made it as written, but sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top before baking.  This I will keep and use often in the summer.  Great recipe!

I knew before I ever started this recipe that the baking time of one hour was excessive for both my potatoes (I used smallish red skins) and the other veggies.  In fact the zucchini and bell pepper would have been total mush had they been baked for an hour.  However, I was still intrigued with this recipe, so I forged ahead, knowing I would have to make some major adjustments.  I scaled this way back for just the two of us, and used 1 T. panko, 1 T. Parmesan (as suggested by others), and the other seasonings.  I started with the potatoes, halving them and coating them with a little EVOO and some of my crumb mixture and baked on a baking sheet, flesh side down for about 30 minutes.  Coated the veggies with the remaining oil and crumbs and added them to the baking sheet with the potatoes.  At this point I turned my potatoes flesh side up.  Baked another 10-15 minutes for crisp-tender veggies.   While I loved the potatoes with the crumb mixture, I wasn’t wild about the veggies with the crumbs.  The crumbs on the potatoes were crisp, but soggy on the veggies.  Guess you could say I have a love/hate relationship with this recipe.  I’ll make the potatoes again, but won’t be adding the veggies.

Made as written... I'm going to cut way back on the breadcrumbs next time!  Also, an hour to cook was way too long in my oven, after 40 minutes I had to take it out.  Will make again, next time I will add some fresh herbs as well.  thanks for sharing!!

This was GREAT.  So quick and easy.  My husband and I had to stop ourselves from eating the entire pan!  The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese as others suggested.  So good!

My husband would have given it a 5, however, I would only give it a 2.  I found the breadcrumbs to be overwhelming--too "crumby" in some parts, too gooey in others.  I may try it again and just severely limit the breadcrumbs.  Thank you for taking the time to post it!!

As written, this recipe gets 4 stars.  All of the ingredients taste great together but the amount of breadcrumbs is simply too much.  To get it to five stars, I cut down on the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup and added 3 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs before mixing it with the veggies.  This is a great way to use up zucchini and I will be making it often.  Thanks Jana :)

My baby brain kicked in with this one and when the recipe called for "bread crumbs", I assumed it meant coarse bread crumbs (like croutons). So I didn't get the desire effect of the zucchini staying crisp. Regardless of my blunder, the flavour was good.

This is delicious - I didn't have breadcrumbs (or bread with which to make them) so I just added some parmesan. It was a little mushier than I would have liked, but still sooo good! I'll definitely be making it again (this time with breadcrumbs, haha).

Very Good, while baking I drizzled more olive oil, made it more crusty and browned. Served with almond crusted tilapia and added a carrot side, great color. it made a nice presentation. Everyone loved it! I will serve again.

MMMMMMmmmm!!! The best part about this recipe is that it is so quick, easy, and versatile. You can do some many variations. I followed the recipes exactly, but added in some onions (I LOVE onions), and a dash of Parmesan cheese.   But here's the trick to make it great...I cooked it on a wire rack, placed on a large cookie sheet, so that heat would get underneath. The result is crispy veggies all over!! It also helped cut down on the cook time by about 15 minutes. Next time I will use less breadcrumbs as this method of cooking brings out the crunch naturally (also, some of the breadcrumbs fell through the rack anyway).  This recipe is going to be a regular for me.

Great recipe!  I would bake on cookie sheet covered in tin foil for easy cleanup.  Keep the vegetable mixture in a thin layer for even crisping.  I would use crushed or minced garlic as opposed to sliced garlic for more even distribution.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and think it would be great with some parmesan cheese as well.

I made a few changes: I sliced the potatoes a little smaller for faster cooking, added some chopped asparagus (just because I had some leftover), and cooked it at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes.  My family raved about it!

The flavor (AND SMELL!) was outstanding! I also added two small sweet onions and garlic. I do wish I had sprayed my cooking dish to prevent sticking, and next time I won't stir. I will make this tons during fall/winter/spring.

I wanted to like this recipe because I love all the ingredients, but it just didn't work for me. I didn't use the pepper as one family member has issues with them.  Even still the zucchini came out way to soft.  The second time I tried adding the zucchini after the potatoes had cooked some thinking that would help but it didn't.  Sorry but I won't be making this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe, though I never follow it to the letter.  I usually do not add the bread crumbs.  I throw in some onion powder and Italian seasoning to make this dish more interesting.  I also mix all of the seasoning with the oil in a large zip lock bag then add the veggies and shake them up so that they are all thoroughly coated for cooking.

This was fantastic.  I did make a couple of slight changes. No paprika simply because I didn't have any.  and I added freshly grated cheddar cheese on the top immediately after removing the dish from the oven.  We will definitely be making this again!

I liked this recipe and will probably make again, but will try it a little differently next time.  I think the baking time was too long for the zucchini, mine got a little too mushy.  The potatoes were right on.  I left out the pepper because I didn't have any, but will definitely add it next time.  The seasoning was right on and I liked the addition of the bread crumbs.  Overall it was pretty good.  Thanks!

This was a pretty good dish but didn't come out excellent for me. I'm thinking maybe if I cut the potatoes into smaller chunks and tossed before putting into the medium baking dish (was crowded) that it may have turned out better for me. I'll try it again in the future. Thanks for the recipe! :)

It had good crunch to it with the bread crumbs. I didn't have any peppers so i used cauliflower instead and it was alright, but the peppers would have added some nice color. I would recommend it as a side.

Made this with dinner tonight and it was a hit! One thing I will do differently next time is cut my zucchini into larger pieces (at least as large as the potato pieces) so they don't over cook. This is a MUST in everyone's recipe box!

This is a great starter recipe - you can do so much with it! We enjoyed this recipe very much! I added a little crushed red pepper and Spicy Pappy's. I also added sliced onion. I am going to add mushrooms next time. I cut the potato a little smaller than the zucchini so they were more evenly cooked.

Easy and delicious.  I used red potatoes and they turned out a little dry.  I either overcooked (I left it in the oven for 70 minutes) or did not add enough olive oil (I did not measure).  Will make again and actually follow the directions.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC! Only I made slight changes, used 3 zucchini's and was told I still needed more, used a orange bell pepper, was all I had, my son chopped the potatoes up small & large and I stirred  up  every 15 minutes in the oven. I was also told this was one of my better dishes. Served it with bar-b-que sausages I did in the slow cooker. GREAT supper!

This tastes much better than it seems just by looking at the recipe. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we ate this. I made it exact to the recipe minus a potato (3 looked like enough) and it tasted delicious.

The first time I made this, I'd never made a recipe with breadcrumbs. So I made toast and crumbled it. Yeah. Not the same. But, actually, it was still really enjoyable. ^_^  The second time I made it, I wised up and bought actual breadcrumbs, added some parmesan cheese on top of the zucchini and potatoes and used a smidge less olive oil than it called for. I liked the texture of the breadcrumbs and the overall flavor. Will definitely keep making this recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  I also had trouble getting the squash and potatoes done at the same time.  Next time I'm going to try sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes - much healthier.

I cut my zucchini in big chunks because I was afraid it would get to mushy waiting for the potatoes to cook, they were cooked perfectly. I didn't like the breadcrumbs so next time I make this I will leave them out. Oh and I didn't have any red bell peppers so I left that out, but I think this would be even better with them! Thanks...

I don't know what I did wrong, but this recipe was awful. By the time the potatoes were cooked all the way, the zucchini was soggy and tasteless. I followed the recipe as written, but I definitely did not get the promised results!

It also only took me 40 minutes. Did not add bell peppers and they weren't missed.

Perfect when you are multi-tasking around the house. Just toss all the ingredients together and throw it in the oven! I didn't need to bake it for a full hour. Mine was done in 40 minutes. I also sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese on top before serving.

Overall, this recipe was a hit. The cooking time was about right but I recommend to cut your potatos into a bit smaller sized pieces than your zuchini (this helps to combat the too squishy zuchini texture). Also, I added some dill, oregano, onion powder and a lot more garlic than stated. About half way through, I tossed some parmesan cheese in (as recommended by another reviewer) and this dish was pretty awesome.

just finished eating this dish, it was awesome.i rated it 4 star only because i had to change some of the ingredients, cause i am not able to eat white potato, peppers, so instead i used sweet potato & carrots ..it turned out delicious.i most generaly try a new recipe with out changing anything,then tweak it later if necessary.if i could i would give this 10 stars.leave it to allrecipes folks to come up with dishes i can have with my restrictions.thanksfor your submission Jana.

Very easy to make. I enjoyed the roasted flavor more than my husband. A bit more seasoning would appeal to us better. Overall, I will make this again. Definitely cut the zucchini long and the potatoes small. This will but your ookin time in half!

We loved this dish! It was so simple to make and easy to clean up after, yet so healthy. We decided we would like to add more bread crumbs next time and that squash would be a nice addition to this veggie dish!

This is so simple and so good, easily modified to add different veg based on what you have on hand, or for me, what you want to use up! The only reason I docked it a star is because I don't think zucchini should go the whole hour... 40 mins MAX, 30 would be better. I did chopped potato, golden beets, carrots, onion tossed in oil & seasoning for 20 minutes, then added the zucchini and an orange pepper, stirred and baked the remaining 40 mins. Next time I'll add after 30 mins, cause it was still a little soft for my taste. Planned to add romano cheese as several reviewers suggested, but I was out, which I didn't realize til right after I returned from the store (of course!) so left that part out, but would have been so much better with it! Leftovers were yummy for lunch today too. A most delicious way to clean out the veg drawer :)

Tasty!  A good recipe for excellently cooked veggies.  I added an onion as well, and a few extra breadcrumbs.  I would definitely make this again; however, I would add more seasoning.  While the veggies are cooked very well, my family prefers a little more seasoning.

Hi Jana This is a traditional Greek dish which doesn't include red peppers (I'll try this variation)and does include plenty of parsley. For me there's no such thing as too much garlic! Dolores

I doubled the bread crumbs and used panko (which are airy-er). I also doubled the garlic. Excellent with some ketchup on the side!

This is how I want my veggies! I used a sweet potato since they are healthier. I accidently used the olive oil/spice mix from the Roasted Vegetable recipe on this site. So, it was like combining the two recipes. Turned out yummy.

This was great! Very simple and very delicious. I added a largely chopped sweet onion, and used chili powder because I didn't have paprika. I usually don't enjoy vegetables, but found myself returning to the pan and snacking on chunks all night. It was even good as cold leftovers the next day.

I added red onion and green pepper in place of the red pepper.  Because of the bland reviews, I didn't add the oil and seasonings.  I instead used a roasted red pepper and tomato salad dressing.. really yummy!  I think adding mushrooms would be good too.

I've made this twice, second time I added the parmesian cheese and broiled it for a minute at the end.  Quite delicious.  It also works if you don't have any potatoes and just double up on the zucchini.

Very tasty!  I didn't have any red pepper, but used half an onion (I halved the recipe because my casserole dish was on the small side).  Added the flavouring spices to the breadcrumbs before tossing everything.  I found that the veggies on the top of the dish were very crispy, but the ones on the bottom didn't get crispy at all, even after stirring halfway.  Next time I may use a more shallow dish to get the zucchini and potatoes to be crispier.

You can substitute any kind of starch or non starch vegetable in this recipe. You just have to maybe prep the slower cooking veggies separately from the fast ones so you can start the slow ones first and add the others later.

This was amazing!  I only used two potatoes and that was definitely enough and the one hour cook time was perfect.

Added parmesan cheese at the end and switched the paprika and used Italian seasonings instead.

This was really easy to put together. I followed the recipe mostly except I used red potatoes and didn't peel them, used both red and green bell peppers and topped it with shredded parmesan the last 5 minutes of baking.  It turned out delicious and goes a long way.

Per other reviewers, I used Panko bread crumbs and sprinkled parmesan flakes after removing dish from the oven.

The potatoes were problematic; I sliced them very thin but they were not cooked through after 1 hour in the oven.  I also cut the squash and peppers in huge chunks, so they were not mushy.  I did not open/stir the dish during baking -- which was fine because the top half of the veggies had a lovely grilled texture.

Next time I will cook the potatoes in the microwave first.

This dish was delicious the next day, reheated.

On special diet so I changed a few of the ingredients.  1 tsp of garlic powder, replaced fresh garlic.  Used gluten-free panko for dried bread crumbs (is what I had in cupboard) and gluten free.  Last 10 minutes added 1/2 cup of mozarella cheese and 8  ounces  of left over rotisserie  chicken to make it a casserole.

This was delicious!  I used red potatoes and seasoned breadcrumbs.  The breadcrumbs gave it all a crunch, which I loved.  Next time I will leave the zucchini in very large chunks because they did get very small after cooking.  I will definitely make this again.

After reading the instructions, I knew it would take longer for the potatoes to cook than the zucchini.  I followed the recipe exactly but changed one thing.  It was more work but I removed all the zucchini pieces before placing the dish in the oven because I knew the zucchinis would become mush after an hour of cooking.  I should have kept the red peppers out also until about 30 minutes left and added the zucchinis about 20 minutes left in the cooking.

After cooking for 30 minutes, I decided to add the zucchini.  In the end, it tasted ok and the texture was still ok (not mushy for zucchinis) but the pepper was overcooked, too but not as mushy as it could have been.

Next time, I will boil the potatoes halfway through, cut them up to approximately same sizes as the zucchinis and the red peppers.  Bake them all at the same time for no more than 20-25 minutes.

I would make it again but with more garlic and other seasonings because it was a bit bland.

I usually make a recipe as written the first time.  But based on some of the comments, I didn't do that this time.  1.  I increased zucchini and decreased potato.  2.  I cut the zucchini in large chunks but cut the potatos in not-too-thin slices to equalize cooking time.  3.  I added parmesan.  4.  I sauteed some diced onion with 2 cloves of garlic.  5.  Because of the liquid and oil from sauteing the onion and garlic, I reduced the oil to 1/8 C.  6.  Due to the above changes, cooking time was just 30 min.  All that said, it was FABULOUS.  Will definitely make again and again.  Only gave 4 stars because it seemed to need some adjustments; otherwise it would have been 5 stars.

I omitted the oil.  Browned some sweat Italian sausage and tossed it in there with some corn, onion, and red pepper flakes.  I also added some fresh grated parmesan to the bread crumbs.

This is really delicious! I added some boneless skinless chicken thighs (drizzled with olive oil, seasoned with paprika, salt and pepper, and sprinkled with bread crumbs) about 20 minutes in, making this an easy one-dish meal. I will definitely make this again.

This is really tasty!!!  I am a novice cook but I wonder if there is a better way to get the bread crumbs to stick to the veggies. Also next time I think I’m gonna try cooking this on the stove to try and get some color.

Excellent! Used Panko Breadcrumbs. I used 6 potatoes, 1 red sweet pepper, and 4 medium zucchini. I also added a bit of fresh and garlic powder. It did not overpower the roasted vegetables. We will definitely make this again!

I added sweet potatoes and cauliflower to this recipe. 
Tastes good.
Also try to add a little grated Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs - adds  crispiness.

Loved this recipe! Made a few changes based on what I had on hand & suggestions. Added mushrooms and candy onion. Didn’t have peppers. Added some Parmesan cheese in bread crumbs and changed salt to garlic salt.

My picky father actually ate it without complaint! Next time I know I need to add more seasoning and reduce the cook time by about 10 minutes, since my zucchini burned a bit around the edges. This one's a keeper!

This is a great recipe! I essentially used it as inspiration and then worked with what I had. The commissary had no zucchini (what!?!) so, I picked up spaghetti squash. Used one smaller spaghetti squash, the four potatoes, about half a red onion, a red bell pepper and a very generous amount of garlic. Because I’d roasted the spaghetti squash ahead of time, I boiled the potatoes for just 10 minutes. Followed the rest of the recipe as directed, but only baked it for 20 minutes or so, as most everything had been cooked. I also fried some Italian sausage, sliced it and threw it on top before putting in the oven. Thus this was a complete meal. My entire family, including the 2 and 3.5 year old, devoured it. Healthy, delicious - we’ll be making it again!

Quick easy dish that never leaves leftovers.  I use Italian bread crumbs, added an onion, and go heavy on the garlic.

I love it! Very easy to make and delicious.
I tried it with both fresh and frozen veggies. For the frozen, i stir-fried them for a few minutes (with the oil and seasoning)  then mixed with the rest of ingredients and baked for less time

I gave it 4/5 stars because it wouldn't of been flavourful enough without the addition of onions & mushrooms. I also added parmesan at the end & mixed it in. It was delicious!

For the most part I followed the recipe. I never follow recipes excatly. What I did add to it was: I used red potato's , orange and yellow bell peppers, and I had some fancy snow peas and a vadalia, onion. I took the recommendation from another review of using seasoned bread crumbs  instead of plain,  I also  used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan. Is it still the same recipe? Its my version any way. Pink salt , a pinch of garlic powder and parsley flake . Came out Greeat very simply took only 10min to prepare.

I made this twice and the first time I used sweet potatoes and it worked out great! The second time I substituted cauliflower pieces for potatoes and it also worked out great! These are good substitutions without requiring a change in the recipe.

Delicious!!!  I even forgot to add the paprika, but it was still good!!!  Now, I'm not sure how big a difference this makes, but I'm not a fan of breadcrumbs (I couldn't find any whole wheat crumbs).  So instead of just making my own, I lazily substituted parmesan cheese.

Wonderful dish, family loved it. I didn’t have any bell pepper so I just used zucchini, potatoes and onion. I used potato medley, which are a variety of different types of potatoes which add a lot of flavor. I also used panko instead of bread crumbs and topped with mozzarella cheese. It was delicious the family wanted more.

This dish was very good as a side. I about doubled the recipe (with rough measurements). I baked it for over an hour, and the zucchini and breadcrumbs were mushy, but the potato and peppers where done well. It didn't look overly appetizing, however it tasted very good! I would make it again and try to bake it for a little less time, maybe parboil the potatoes first, and add a little more seasoning.

Had a  large amount of zucchini and didn't know what to do with it. When I found this I was delighted, something a little different.  This recipe is great! My family loved it and had me make another batch, which my daughter took to work.  I was getting phone calls all afternoon from her co-workers to tell me how much they liked it.   I did season to taste and cut the zucchini about two inches thick,  wasn't mushy or overbaked .  Thanks for making me a star!

This is such a great side dish for chicken or pretty much anything. I definitely think you could pop the zucchini in about halfway through the cooking to make them firmer, but I don't mind it a little soft. I leave the zucchini in bigger chunks and it's fine w/ me!

I used what I had on hand: potatoes, zucchini and carrots. For years I’ve made oven veggies this way, just without the bread crumbs. It’s nice adding the crumbs...it mixes it up for my family. :)

Substituted orange for red peppers, yellow squash for half of the zucchini squash, and parmesan cheese for the bread crumbs (to make gluten free).  This makes a large batch, suitable as a delicious side dish for at least 6 people.

Good side dish.  I added Panko Italian Bread crumbs, green and orange peppers, more garlic and parm.   Lined the pan with foil but forgot to spray it with Pam.  Would also work with yellow squash, tomatoes and mushrooms.  It's a Keeper.

I did like how the seasoning (especially adding 1/4 c. Parmesan as another member suggested) tasted on the potatoes.  I cut both the zucchini and potatoes the same size and the zucchini was mushy.  I suggest using very similar type veggies next time so they both are the same texture.

This is a great dish to make for just about anything - barbecues, meal prep, weeknight dinner, etc. I was a little disappointed in the bread crumbs; they ended up soggy and lost all their crunch - was I wrong in assuming they would maintain it? That won't stop me from making this again as it was delicious, anyway.

This was absolutely fabulous. My 14 year old steers clear of any vegetables normally and kept coming back for more. Never pictured him eating zucchini or peppers. I was hoping there would be leftovers but no such luck. I will be making this much more often. I split the potatoes between regular potatoes and sweet potatoes. 5 STARS

This was delicious and tasted very complex. I omitted peppers, added onion and 1/2 cup each of panko and parmesan. Husband and both kids asked to keep it in the rotation.

OMG! Was this ever delicious! This was a hit in my household, and we hate veggies! I did add in some chopped onion, garlic powder, creole spice and topped it with cheese, but the veggies came out perfectly cooked in the hour. This one is a keeper. Will definitely make again!

It's easy, it's inexpensive, and it's not bad.  It's certainly not my favorite method of preparing potatoes, zucchini, or bell pepper, but I'll probably do it again when I need an easy side dish.
I've made this several more times and I've found that adding red onion to the vegetables, using seasoned salt instead of regular, using half as much oil, and replacing half the bread crumbs with flax seed improves the heck out of it.  Now I like it a lot.

I made this during a week of vegan eating. Following recommendations from the reviews, I added mushrooms and onion. Subbed yellow squash for zucchini, as the grocery store didn't have any. Overall, good flavors and I paired it with a side of broccoli, but still kind of bland. I might try adding some spice next time.

I made recipe as written, pretty good but not spectacular.  My husband said he liked it but would prefer just regular potatoes and zucchini potato roasted in evoo and salt/pepper.  But still, it was pretty good.

Such an easy preparation.  I needed to make a complete meal without any fuss.  I used half the ingredients because that's what I had on hand.  I added boneless chicken thighs and cut them in pieces about 2" wide.  I baked it uncovered for about 50 minutes and it was delicious.

An easy and tasty variation on roasted potatoes. The crumbs do a good job of soaking up some oil and add some crisp to the dish. I expected the zucchini to get really mushy but it didn't.

I made this for Friday after Thanksgiving brunch.  It was accompanied by scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and fruit salad. But this was definitely the star.  I started to par-roast the potatoes before adding everything else, but that was mostly because I cut the zucchini and pepper too small.

I've been roasting veggies for a while now, but have never used bread crumbs.  I used whole wheat bread crumbs and I have to say this additions adds a whole new level of texture and flavor to already delicious roasted vegetables.  If you're a fan of roasted veggies, you must try this recipe.

After reading the reviews  I decided to change the seasoning a bit.  I kept everything else the same and it turned out great!  I used Lawry's seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper.  This was a hit!  I served it prime cut steaks from the grill, yum!

Yum! I made this pretty much as written, except with seasoned breadcrumbs and I also added onions. I sliced the potatoes pretty thin, too, so that they would be sure to be cooked through. Really easy recipe that is a perfect side dish to just about any main course.

It tasted great but I wasn't a fan of the texture. Perhaps they needed more bread crumbs. I probably won't try again.

Liked the combination of flavors.  Might add some onion next time for additional flavor and Parmesan cheese.  I need to play with the time, bread crumb amount, or type of pan used b/c I wanted it to be a little crispier than it was.  I find zucchini hard to keep from getting mushy but the breadcrumbs did help with that.

As is, this is a good recipe. But with a little tweaking this will be a great side dish! I followed some other reviewers' advice and added grated Parmesan to the mix. I wish I had also added chopped onion.. DH agreed. I used Italian breadcrumbs, but I think more herbs are needed. Great way to use all those garden veggies! Will be making this again!

I have made it twice and we enjoyed it, first time I made it on the stove top and was a little dry, but it was still very good.  The second time I made as directed by the recipe but  I left out the bread crumbs and added Kielbasa, which gave more flavor and spiced up the dish a little. I would make again

I made this a couple times now.  My family ate this very well.  I followed a few suggestions.  I added extra bread crumbs (I used plain bread crumbs), 1/2 of an onions, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp dried granulated garlic, and 1 tsp dried granulated onion.  Once all stirred together I drizzled 2 T margarine over it before baking.  I didn't stir it at all during the baking time and I left it uncovered (it doesn't specify in the recipe).  When it was done I sprinkled some cheddar cheese over it.   It was really good.  
The first time I made this: once it was all baked, I added some hamburger which I cooked with more onions, salt, pepper, onion powder, and minced garlic.  After I mixed in the hamburger, I sprinkled cheddar cheese over it and cooked it under the broiler for a couple minutes.  And that was good, too.

Yum! My only recommendation would be to stir it halfway through. The potatoes on the bottom were nicely done, but the ones on top we're not quite.

Excellent recipe! I added 3 med. squash, used a mix of baby yukon gold and baby reds (cut in quarters) in place of the suggested potatoes, added 1/2 c. chopped red onion,  1/4 cup parmigiano reggiano, a few shakes of red pepper flakes, dried basil and dried oregano. Mixed well. Baked for 45 mins at the stated temperature, stirring occasionally. DELICIOUS! A hit at the family cookout. There was nothing left.

Very easy and the zucchini wasn't soggy.  Added onion and the Parmesan cheese as some suggested.  Usd red skin potatoes cut into small chunks. Nice and easy.  Would be good to make for a large group.

I made this recipe, but it really wasn't anything I haven't made before. My mother is from Greece and we grew up on all sorts of variations on this dish. Generally,  you make it with whatever vegetables you have on hand...zucchini, potatoes, peppers, eggplant, beans, etc. 

I made the recipe pretty much as indicated here, except instead of cutting everything up into chunks, I used my spiralizer. Mainly, just because I wanted to use it.  I liked it because it really stretched the veggies farther and let them crisp up more in the oven. The only addition I made was that I also added oregano for more flavor.  I also used whole wheat breadcrumbs, because that is what I happened to have on hand after my last trip to Whole Foods.

This was great.  I used one zucchini and one yellow summer squash.   I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used crushed ritz crackers and cut back a bit on the oil.  I also added an onion.  So good!

I made this for my wife, who loves Zucchini, even though I don't  ( Brownie points)
Made 2 small additions
 1/2 med red onion sliced and quartered
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
I ended up loving it (didn't eat the zucchini) great mix of flavors with no spices added.

This dish came out great! I followed the instructions pretty much exactly, except that I cut the pieces of potato and zucchini a little smaller than what I'd call "large" chunks. The only thing I'd change next time is that it could have used a little more bread crumbs AND maybe a little more seasoning. Some might find it a bit bland as-is (depending on personal seasoning preferences).

Next time I would use far less oil than the recipe calls for. Otherwise this was very good.

I love this recipe.  I like to make it in a crockpot on high for 4 hours.  Double the garlic, remove the bread crumbs, and add about a tablespoon of dry gravy mix to add some more flavor.

All I can say is YUMMY!  Both my husband and I loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  It was so easy.  When my husband says, "Make it again" I know it was good.

Family enjoyed this although, I think cooking time was a little long as it did come out a little mushy.  Will definitely make again but will not add zucchini until 20 minutes before done.  Thank you for sharing!

Not sure how to rate it because I did not follow the exact recipe but took into consideration the suggestions from other reviewers. It was pretty good after I added onions, Italian seasoning, garlic salt, chopped the potatoes into small size and baked at 400 F for 45 min. One thing I regret not doing is that I did not spray the baking sheet with cooking oil. Some of the potatoes and onion stuck to the sheet. I liked the crunchy garlic slices. Will add more of them next time.

This was delicious and simple. For my own tastes, I will double the amount of zucchini next time, but it certainly isn't necessary.

Very tasty. The first time I made this I added too much paprika. I am a person who appreciates exact measurements, so for my second time cooking it, I added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper and 1/2 teaspoon hot paprika. I also switched the russet potatoes for yams and found that to be much more interesting. The first time I made it, my husband used the leftovers in eggs the next morning which was very good as well!

It would have been better without the olives (or at least with less olives) the olives added too much of an over-powering flavor

Omg...these veggies are so good. Hot out of the oven. I put them along with some grilled chicken breasts. They came out a little crunchy on top so maybe a loose sheet of foil on top would help. Otherwise the flavor and crunch from the bread crumbs is awesome.

My family loved it. I read other reviews and made a few simple changes but it may have been great as written. I do not like zucchini when it is too soft so I cut potatoes (skin included) into chunks, barely coated with olive oil and cooked about 20 minutes before adding rest of ingredients. Stirred everything together and cooked another 30 minutes or so until everything was cooked but not mushy. I also  used seasoned  Panko instead of bread crumbs since I had some on hand. Will be making this again soon.

Pretty good.  I needed to put more spices in it. I don't like guessing. Next time I will cut the potatoes smaller and use seasoning salt.  I added an onion.

I made as written except I did not have garlic on hand so I used garlic powder and did not peel my potatoes. It turned out very good. I think the addition of onions would be one I would really like, but since I have a son who hates onions, I can't always do that. It was very good as written. I maybe would cook it a little longer or at a higher temperature to get it to brown a little more, but very good as is!

Not super flavourful, but pretty tasty and very easy to prepare. I used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs. I added a carrot and an onion. I also added a tin of chickpeas because I'm more of a all-the-food-in-one-dish kinda gal, rather than figuring out an accompanying main. I'll definitely make it again, and will follow other reviewers' suggestions on additions of herbs and spices. Oh, and I had to cook it for almost 90 minutes for the potatoes to be soft enough. Next time I'll chop a little smaller.

Delicious!  
Here's my version of it... 
Substitutions: Panko bread crumbs, Wegman's Basting Oil (sunflower oil, garlic, herbs), smoked paprika.   
Add: extra garlic & parmesan cheese.  On the side or in the dish add cooked ground turkey sausage.
Note: I like to use coarse salt & fresh cracked black pepper.

DELICIOUS!! My daughter never eats potatoes, but she was asking for more.  My baby has a dairy, egg, and nut allergy so this was a great discovery as I continuously try to find diversity in her meal plan.  I added onions and rosemary to this recipe and substituted the bread crumbs for her dairy/egg free bread crumbs. Thank you!

This was really good.  The only changes I made was in the way I put it together, and I substituted garlic powder  for the sliced garlic. (I added it in with the other seasonings. ) Instead of combining everything on the pan, I tossed all of the veggie together first in a big bowl with the olive oil.   I mixed the seasonings in with the bread crumbs (panko) in a separate small bowl.  Next, I combined the seasoned bread crumbs with the veggies.  Then I spread it all out on the pan.  Yummy.

Soooo good! I used garlic powder instead of actual garlic & added Italan seasoning. Going to make this again soon!

So delicious! Recipe is so easy to make. I've made it several times now. I would not change a thing. I have been asked by many of my friends for the recipe. Great for potlucks.

This is fabulous! My expectations were not too high for some reason. But this blew me away! I left out the peppers because we don't care for them. I used one zucchini and one yellow squash. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I would serve this as a side to company. For me, it made a wonderful vegetarian entry.

I made a few revisions, added onion and subtracted the bread crumbs. I used multi colored fingerling potatoes and the recipe turned out great. My guests really enjoyed it too.

This is delicious. I added big chunks of onion, Italian seasoned crumbs and a grating of Parmesan. I was surprised that the zucchini, potatoes  and onions were all cooked perfectly. I thought the squash would be mushy, but not at all. This could certainly work with a number of other vegetables. Very nice and I will make this again.

My mistake was not stirring it while baking. Some potatoes were still crunchy after an hour. Should've followed the recipe more closely (or less - and cut the potatoes into smaller chunks). I think next time I'll add a little more breadcrumbs. I definitely liked it, but I don't think this recipe deserves five stars because it doesn't say how much spices to add (and I'm terrible at "eyeing" that).

I found this recipe to be a great base for something richer. I added chicken, shredded Mexican cheese, and used Italian-style panko breadcrumbs. I also added some onion because I felt like it needed that layer of flavor as well. Bake time was spot on for everything and everyone loved it. Thank you very much for the amazing recipe!

Thank you for the recipe!

Followed exactly except for the bread crumbs. To make gluten free, I put sriracha corn/rice chips in a food processor until I had 1/2 cup. I really liked it a lot. Will definitely make again.

Love it!  Sometimes I substitute squash for the zucchini if that's all we have and sometimes I use both of those vegetables in addition to the others. I also usually add onion because I like onion so much. This is great with the Maple Roasted Brussel Sprouts. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228875/maple-roasted-brussels-sprouts-with-bacon/

Love this recipe. My hubby isn't a veggie fan but he asked for more! I didn't have potato on hand so I used sweet potato instead. And I cut down the baking time by cooking all the ingredients on stove first. I saute the garlic first to give out the fragrance , then put in mushrooms, red bell pepper, and the rest. Will definitely try this recipe again!

I added onions (as recommended by other reviewers), used corn flake crumbs instead of breadcrumbs to make it gluten-free, added a little oregano and parmesan cheese to the mix, and baked it in a single layer on a large baking sheet.  It browned nicely and was pleasantly crispy-crunchy and delicious!

Really good, but made some modifications. I used Panko instead of plain breadcrumbs. I used red potatoes, leaving the skin on. I added eggplant, a couple handfuls of cherry tomatoes & 1/2 red onion, city into chunks. I used 1 red bell pepper & 1 yellow bell pepper & added 1/2 c grated parmesan cheese. I increased the garlic to 4 cloves (we like a lot of garlic) & increased spices, breadcrumbs & oil to compensate for the added ingredients. To make it a complete meal, I added Great White Northern Beans. It also made a good side dish to some grilled Swai. When I served it with the fish, I changed the paprika to Old Bay seasoning. It was delicious

I made the recipe as instructed and found it to be bland. I think it's a good base recipe, but it needs extra ingredients to be tasty. I will make it again, but will play with it. I'm thinking onion powder and garlic powder are a good place to start.

The first time I made it, I stayed with the recipe.  I have made it many times now, and have varied the vegetables a lot.   Still delish - a great way to break people into a different way of eating vegetables.

I used red potatoes, skins on. I also used minced garlic instead of slices. It's what I had on hand.
I really liked the flavor. Next time, I'll make the pieces smaller so that I can get a bit of each of the flavors on the fork at one time. Maybe a sprinkle of cheese to get my boys to each it better.
Very good recipe.

Potatoes cut into big chunks- NO! I cut mine into roughly 1-1/2x1-1/2" pieces and they were undercooked compared to the other ingredients. Next time I will probably cut them about half that size. The taste otherwise was delicious! I will be making this again for sure just I cannot give it a higher rating because "as written" its a fail.

I didn't add the breadcrumbs because my sister is on a gluten-free diet, but the recipe was still great! I might have to make more next time, though, because it didn't yield as much as I though it would.

Great tasting! Added some parsley, additional Italian seasoning, and some sliced carrots to great effect.  Put some sliced parmesan on top for the last few minutes to finish it off.  Fiancée and I ended up eating waaaaay too much!

I added onion and season salt. Next time u will omit the potatoes and use califlower since I always feel guilty eating potatoes. My 4-year-old son loved this! We had couscous and baked swai fish with it.

Just made this!!  Fantastic!  I used whole wheat panko for the crumbs and paired it while pork chops. The entire family loved it! That's 3 picky kids who hate veggies! Can't wait to try again with some of the suggestions!

Wonderful! I love ease and greatness. This recipe fits the bill. Sprinkled  Parmesan cheese on before baking after reading the suggestion next time I will mix up the veggies to try variations.  This recipe was quick to prep  and delicious! Saved to my recipe box for sure!!

This is delicious! It was easier for me to toss all the ingredients together in a bowl first, lightly spray my pan with cooking spray, and then bake.
Only suggestion is that I should've cut the zucchini much bigger than I thought, since it does shrink down some when baking. I plan on trying it with some different veggies next time. Thanks for sharing, Jana!

just popped into the oven...didn't have bell peppers but used tomatoe for color and also used onion and baby purple,yellow and red potatoes!!  had seasoned croutons that worked perfectly and a little bit of ranch dressing seasoning.  might add bacon bits at the end.  but this recipe is so versatile that anything goes!!!cut the zucchini bigger than the potatoes so it will cook evenly...added seasalt and pepper along with garlic powder and a little bit of the mince type.

I love this meal! Tonight is the second time I have made it so far and it is amazing! I did what some of the reviewers said n used garlic & herb bread crumbs, added shredded parmesan cheese into the bread crumbs, and before I drizzled the olive oil over all of it I added spices to the olive oil to add more flavor- garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, paprika, and a little bit of cayenne powder. Me and my husband just love it! Awesome way to use up the zuchini and potatoes from the garden.

This turned out awesome!! Love it. The only thing I did different was use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, helped give it some more flavor. I made it for fAmily this past weekend and my husband loved it so much he wanted me to make it again, so it's for dinner tonight as well!

Very tasty and nice blend of flavours and texture.  I cut the potatoes  a little smaller than the zucchini  so that zucchini would not be too soft .  My family loved it.

This was a great recipe, but it DEFINITELY needed more zucchini. Two medium ones were just not enough, especially considering how much they shrink. The little that was left just got lost in the potato/bread crumb flavor. I would suggest adding equal amounts of zucchini and potato next time, and it'd be perfect!

I am a novice cook, and I found this fairly easy to follow with pleasant results. I used about 1 tbsp more olive oil because it seemed difficult to coat everything, but that may have been unnecessary. 

My only complaint was that the images show significant amounts of bread crumbs on everything, whereas mine was very sparse. This could be because I made my own bread crumbs from dethawed Ezekiel 4:9 bread that I pulverized in my blender, or it could be that I needed to use more bread crumbs.  My idea of "medium" potatoes and zuchinni may be different than what the author means, because this batch would not fit in a "medium" pyrex dish. I had to use the large 9x13 Pyrex - and even then it seemed quite full. Next time I will split it between two Pyrex dishes. 

Finally, I don't think I added enough Paprika because I did not get any peppery taste as other reviewers mention. As a novice, I was very uncertain of how much to add. I will try measuring in the future and recording results. 

All of this aside, I loved how this tasted and devoured it. It's one of the first things I've made that has not come out bland or with any major screw-ups. lol.   Edit: I should note that I used zuchinni and potatoes straight from the farmer's market, so they were very fresh and flavorful!

This was soooooo good.  I have to be careful because sometime I dry it out a bit, probably b/c I am cutting the potatoes too small.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs and I don't plan on ever changing that.  D-licious!!!

Fantastic! Only thing I added was a couple of Anaheim peppers. Will try again using eggplant instead of potatoes. I served with Salsa Chicken by Faye. Great meal.

This is really good. I added 1/3 cup parmesan and an onion, and put everything on a cookie sheet. It baked great. If you want your zucchini less done you might want to add it half way through the bake time.

5 stars bc i modified the recipe. first, i used 1 cucumber and 1 zucchini! ( instead of 2 zucchini ) then 4 RED shinned potatoes. mixed with EXTRA virgin olive oil. then, added salt, pepper, paprika, italian seasoning, garlic salt, and celery salt. i DIDNT add the bread crumbs, and it gave a roast type texture instead which we loved. super super easy. preped in under 10mins. then baked at 415 for 45min:)

This was wonderful.  I wound up using Matzo Meal instead of breadcrumbs, and I added a little more olive oil half-way through the baking time. I will definitely make it again!

This was wonderful.  My only change was that I added a bit more salt and garlic.  Family loved it - it's a keeper.  Simple and easy to prepare.  Very versatile - can other veggies too.  Probably will add onions next time.

Have tried this recipe twice. It's great, Just like the reviews state. The first time I stuck to the recipe, the second time I added an Italian herb mix. Still good.  It's one of those recipes you can easily experiment with. The second variation also included a mix of white and sweet potatoes. Enjoy.

Used one zucchini and one yellow squash and added 1/2cup Parmesan cheese. Cooked this to go with grilled steak and it was awesome.  We will definitely have this again.

I have made this twice now and plan to make it again this week.  My family does not consider zucchini to be their favorite veggie but in this mixture, the entire platter is consumed!!-(-I have a husband and 2 sons at the table).  The mixture provides interest in flavors, textures, taste, and color.  So if someone in your family does not go for zucchini, they might eat it prepared this way instead of it sitting out there all by itself!

Was very good.  Instead of using paprika, salt and pepper, I sprinkled with old bay seasoning.  I cooked the potatoes for 15 min then mixed in the rest of the veggies (2 summer squash, 1 zucchini, 1 red pepper and garlic).  Sprinkled the top with breadcrumbs and Romano cheese and baked for another 40 min.  Broiled for 5 min and was nice and crispy.  My mom who doesn't care for zucchini and squash enjoyed it and my husband who dislikes almost all veggies said to definitely make it again and took seconds....that's a score!

This recipe was awesome! I just used all the vegetables I had in my garden and refrigerator, here is my variation of this recipe. 3 zucchinis, 3 small and skinny peeled eggplants, 1 tomato (not peeled). Tossed this together, with 3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, about 1T and 2t of garlic from a jar (I didn't have fresh garlic), and 1/3 cup olive oil. I put it into a 9x13 pan, and sprinkled a lot of pecorino romano cheese on top. Baked this for 55min, which was slightly too much (next time I will bake it for 45-50min.). It made a dinner that was perfect for five people, I also added some ravioli to my dinner. 
The cheese adds a very good taste, and I would recommend to anyone who is reading this to use it. :)

This was an easily prepared recipe with outstanding results.Take away the white potato add a sweet potato and the results were suberb.After that I followed the recipe with the exception of using panko bread crumbs.
My husband said it needed carrots but I disagreed,save them for another recipe.
Invite a vegetarian and it's so nice to have a good tasting recipe you can share with them!

This is a very, very good dish - a GREAT way to use up the abundance of garden fresh zucchini, if you're fortunate enough to have that problem :) I made very close to original recipe, but used panko in place of regular breadcrumbs, probably quadrupled the amount of garlic, and had to up the amount of salt, pepper and paprika about half way thru when a taste test wasn't satisfactory. It's a simple but satisfying side that would be great paired with a grilled meat. Also relatively inexpensive ingredients - a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  Very good as is, although I needed more cooking time for the potatoes and had to up the temperature to 375°.  Might be because of our high elevation.  I liked the suggestion of starting the potatoes and then adding the rest of the ingredients.  The second time around I added 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, sliced mushrooms and Italian sausage that I had cut up into small pieces and browned.  Cut the amount of bread crumbs 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup Parmesan.  So it became the main course!

Made this dish last week. Used red potatoes instead, added chopped sausage and lightly greased my glass pan as suggested by others. Cooked the potatoes in the oven first for about 15 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients and cooking to ensure that the potatoes were cooked but my zucchini would not be mushy. It came out pretty good. Not a big fan of the breadcrumbs. Ate leftovers with an over easy egg the next day and that was awesome!

This was a nice alternative to boring old French fries, or steamed vegetables. I would add some quartered mushrooms and onions. Only reason I gave four stars is because at 400 degrees, this doesn't take an hour at all. I set the timer for 45 minutes and it was done in about 35. Great side dish

Everyone in my family ate this- and that's a miracle!  I was concerned about cooking time and seasoning after reading other reviews, but the recipe worked well.  I used 2 garlic cloves (we love garlic), 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp paprika, and 1/8 tsp pepper.  We would have liked it as well with 3/4 tsp salt, but it was definitely not bland.  Our zucchini were all small (the last of the season, right before a freeze), so there weren't many seeds- all of the chunks were fairly firm; because they were small, I used 4 or 5 instead of 2 medium.  When we make this next year with larger zucchini, I'll do as another reviewer suggested and cut the seeds out of the center before chunk-ing.  I cut the potatoes fairly small, the zucchini about twice that size.  Other than adding an extra clove of garlic, I followed the recipe exactly.  The bread crumbs gave this dish a great texture- not exactly crunchy, but not soggy, either- just nice and toothsome :)  This is also a beautiful dish.  I enjoyed making it, eating it, and reheating it the next day.  We'll definitely be making this again next summer.

Husband rated it "Yums"!   That means he wants me to make it again!
I cut the vegs into smaller bite-size chunks and it took 35-40 minutes of baking time.  Used panko breadcrumbs, and added a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash to the toss mixture and I topped with cubed pepper jack cheese during the last 3 minutes of baking.

This was fantastic!  I took other readers advise and put the red potatoes in 30 minutes early.  I left the potatoes to cook separately and put the veggies on a cookie sheet.  Mixed everything together at the end.  I also added Parmesan cheese, mushrooms, onions and yellow squash.  I made enough for 8 but 3 ate almost the entire dish.  Great for small groups or crowds.  Will definitely make this again!  My friends devoured it.

Yum!  Used panko bread crumbs and like others, added some parmesan cheese.  Also threw in a couple of sweet potatoes.  Needs a bit more herbs for our taste - otherwise a keeper!

I've made this recipe twice now, and it's excellent. The only changes I made were to use green Bell peppers (I didn't have any reds) and used about 5 cloves of garlic (we love garlic). It's great if you want a recipe using Zucchini that is not done in 5 minutes, like grilling them, because you have other dishes to manage at the same time. A+

Absolutely delicious! I could not believe how tasty this simple recipe was. Please don't stir during cooking, let the vegetables get charred edges...heaven. I did cut the oil down to 2 T and that was plenty.

I cut the potatoes smaller than suggested, but should have cut the zucchini almost the same size as the potatoes.
I don't know what exactly, but it needs more spices and less olive oil. I will try again with some tweeking.

this was good. but in my opinion needed a bit less potato and more zucchini. it could have used more spices too and mushrooms would have been really good in it.  i added onion as well, and grated parmesan cheese over top.

Very tasty dish - we had it as our main meal and my hubby said he'd increase the volume of everything, which is a good sign!  I'll add mushrooms the next time and also consider it for a more substantial breakfast when company is over.

I had rather low expectations since it called for roasting something rather watery with something starchy and then adding bread crumbs, but I needed to find another way to use my zucchini - This is excellent!  My husband asked me to make it again today. I used quite a bit of paprika - might try smoked paprika next time. Otherwise, I made it as written and  think it is perfect. Since I wrote this, I have made this recipe at least 5 or 6 times and love it every time!

I made this in our largest Corelleware casserole dish with a glass lid.  I baked it covered and stirred it 3x.  I cut the zuchinni into round slices and cubed the potatoes. They were equally cooked.  The seasoning is subtle, but good.

Huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. I added mushrooms, onions, and topped it with grated cheese. Could almost have made a main course out of it. We didn't have enough.

I didn't have any potatoes, so I just used zucchini and one red bell pepper for this dish. It turned out amazing! Since I omitted the potatoes, I only baked the vegetables for about 35 minutes. I used Italian breadcrumbs, which gave everything a really nice flavor. Can't wait to try this with the potatoes too!

Great recipe.  I used smoked paprika for an extra flavor kick.  Somehow the zucchini becomes almost cheeselike in this dish.

I made these veggies last night to go with a meatloaf (EZ Meatloaf, also from this site), in an effort to use up some extra zucchinis that I had.  I used 2 smallish zucchinis, 6 medium potatoes, and an onion (no red pepper because I didn't have any on hand, and no garlic cloves because sadly, I'm allergic to garlic and can only eat minimal amounts).  I tossed the veggies with the ingredients as directed, using a garlic olive oil to still get some of the garlic flavor, and adding some chili powder. I used panko breadcrumbs, which worked just fine.  This dish turned out well and went great with my meatloaf for a nice homey, fall meal!

I followed some advice from other reviewers:  cut the zucchini and potatoes into smaller chunks and used Italian Panko in place of regular bread crumbs.  This took about 35 minutes to bake.  It was a great side dish with grilled pork chops.  Thanks for sharing, Jana

This is in the oven right now and I have 5 minutes to go and the potatoes are about done..only change I made was to double the garlic  and used panko bread crumbs- will be great with our fish!  I am rating this 5 stars but for some reason my computer isn't showing the stars...   :)

Great. My family loved it. This recipe is a keeper and will get used alot. I added parm. cheese and thick slices of portabello mushrooms and used a banana pepper instead of the red sweet pepper because thats what I had on hand. I didnt cut the potatoes in large chunks after reading the other reviews I was afraid that the potatoes would not be tender when the zucchini was done. I cut the potatoes into large dice sized pieces.  I also put in under the broiler for a few minutes to get nice browning. This can be made in sooo many variations, Im looking forward to making and customizing it again.  YUM

I absolutely love this easy recipe.  It is so simple to change it up with different vegetables.  I added rutabaga, carrots, yellow squash, sweet potato.  All of it is amazing.  I find it easiest to either bake the potatoes (rutabaga, sweet potatoes etc.) for a while first or throw them in the microwave for about 10 minutes prior to baking them with the rest of the vegetables.  YUM!

OK. I would add green chili to it. Reused leftovers at breakfast: reheated in bacon grease and added green chili to it for breakfast potatoes.

I thought this was a nice way to serve veggies. I even served leftovers the next day. They got a bit mushy, but were still tasty. My hubby didn't love these though.

Excellent! I use Panko instead of breadcrumbs. I also add onion and about a quarter cup grated Parmesan cheese. I have made this with regular white potatoes and sweet potatoes. Delicious either way. :)

LOVED this dish! It was so simple and yet SO good. I added parmesan as many reviewers suggested and used garlic powder instead of fresh, mainly because I forgot to add the garlic until after I'd already put it in the oven. I cooked for an hour at 400 and felt that the potatoes needed a little more time (mind you, I have a VERY old oven) and so I put the dish back in with another dish at 350 for an additional 20 minutes. The pan wasn't too much fun to clean afterwards, but I'd clean it ten times over because the dish was so good!

I found the flavor of this dish very good....I did however, make some adjustments from reading other reviews.  I added parm. cheese to the breadcrumbs and I also added diced tomatoes...which I feel made the dish.  I will make again, but I think I will add more oil, dish tended to be a bit dry.

Very easy and very good.  My 17 yr. old son is not a fan of zucchini or potatoes and loved it.  Asked if I will make it again.  I added extra garlic because my family loves it, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe! Very simple yet completely satisfying. I only made small changes: I used 4 cloves of garlic & added garlic powder & onion salt as well. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. I will make this recipe again in the future.

This was pretty dang tasty and the cook time and temp. was spot on for the potatoes....but my zucchini wound up a crispy crispy hot mess. I can honestly say I am def going to make this again but leave the zucchini completely out and call it baked home fries. BTW adding powdered parmesan to the bread crumb coating really makes this brilliant.

I onlyused 2 potatoes and no bell pepper because I didn't have it but this was really good and could be changed up to suite what you have on hand easily. I also just used garlic powder and italian stlye bread crumbs.

While we really liked the taste of this, my zucchini was mushy while the potatoes were almost just right. I would have liked to cook a little more to make the potatoes even more crunchy but because of the zucchini I had to take it out. I will make this again but in the future I will probably use EITHER potatoes or veggies but not combine them. Having said all that, I added parm cheese as well and we did enjoy the taste of the dish. Thanks

Very tasty! I suggest using italian-seasoned breadcrumbs and we like more garlic and less potatoes, but it's a great and easy recipe as is.

I had a huuuuuge issue with the potatoes! It took them almost 2 hours to fully bake and I had cut them in smaller pieces to prevent having to cook them forever. All said and done - it was delicious BUT zucchini had turned to mush :(

Very easy and good. I used green pepper instead of red pepper but i did chop up my veggies and potatoes small and that did make it cook quicker. used a good amount of parsley, seasoning salt, garlic powder and garlic salt with some oregano and bread crumbs. this one is a keeper and I used it as a main meal with some left over for lunch.

Mmm! Had to use crushed crackers, as I had no bread crumbs on hand, but it was still delicious. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is that it is slightly bland. Next time I will add some Parmesan to do the trick.

Really tasty! Based on earlier reviews I did not want the 'mushy zucchini' issue so I pre-cooked the potatoes in the micro for about 6min. This also cut down on the overall oven time to 35-45min. SO GOOD!

Very good! Doubled recipe to make this a main course for our family of 4. We still didn't have any left overs since everyone loved it so much. Would be great served with a side of rice for those who want more.

When my husband says "this is a keeper" I sit up and take notice. Easy, healthful, simple ingredients. I wasn't sure about the breadcrumbs, but they were a great addition. I used fine dry whole wheat. I also used parmesan. I used 3 cloves garlic, pungent but good. I used a green bell pepper, as it's what I had, and it was excellent. I'll try red and even orange on other occasions, because I'll be making this again and again. My 9-yr-old had seconds. Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this looked rather basic and it was - I don't understand all the rave reviews. My kids still thought the zucchini tasted like zucchini - which they don't like.  I love my veggies but overall thought the dish was just ok, and really the zucchini was too overcooked to taste very good. Maybe if it was inseason....or I had some super special paprika or specially seasoned bread crumbs?? I even added some parmesan.

Had this for dinner tonight with pork chops and it was such a nice way to use up veggies that I had just lying around.  I did add half of an onion and used a little less of the zucchini, which I am now regretting. I used red potatoes with the skins on and subbed carrots for the red pepper.  I could see this working with about any combination of vegetables.  I will now be using this to empty out the vegetable bin more often!

Good veggie dish, thanks! I halved the recipe for the two of us, and added 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes per other reviewer suggestions. Also added 1/4 sliced red onion. Will probably add more zucchini next time, and maybe garlic powder. Thanks!

These were delicious and so addicting!  I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on mine like many other reviewers.  I never stirred during the baking and would guess mine were done in about 45 minutes so make sure you check even if you don't stir when you check.  Next time I might try with whole wheat bread crumbs for a heartier healthier flavor, yum!

Other than the time it takes to prep the veggies this is a quick and easy side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except I sprinkled a little parmesan on top.  Next time I might cut the potatoes a little smaller to speed up the cook time.  Very tasty.

What a delicious and hearty recipe! As a college student, this was a wonderful recipe to bake and have ready for myself for the rest of the week! My only suggestion for it is that if you want a less calorie ridden meal then use less potatoes. Next time I make it I'm definitely going to add more zucchini because when zucchini bakes for an hour it tends to get reaaally tiny. So, I'd recommend four zucchinis instead of two. Also, its really hearty, but if you want more of a flavorful POW or tang to your recipe add lime/lemon juice to the veggies or some spice to it!

Excellent! I followed the recipe, but added the 1/2 cup parmesan and some chopped red onion. I also substituted crumbled crackers since we didn't have any bread crumbs. My hubby who doesn't even like zucchini or pepper ate it up! Will definitely make again.

Great! I followed the suggestion and added Parmesan cheese and broiled for a few minutes for extra crunch. Excellent. Will definitely make again!

The potatoes and peppers are good, but the zucchini was mushy and gross. I also tripled the garlic(as per my tastes) and added 1/4/c parm cheese to the mix.

This is surprisingly delicious and oh, so simple. I had some leftover chopped chicken which I threw in. I also added a few teaspoons of leftover Italian salad dressing. I put some Parmesan on top and popped into the oven. I cut my potatoes very thick and left the zucchini in big pieces. I think you could use any variation you like. I also put a couple of garlic cloves.  I loved it.

This was tasty.  Too spicy for my kids and they wished I had made some without the paprika.  But my husband and I liked it as a side for the baked Garlic ginger chops also from allrecipes.

This couldn't be easier and is so tasty!!
I love roasted veggies and as another review said you could do many varitions on this. I did add the onion and I added more garlic. It's August and I would never want to cook this during the summer because who wants a hot oven on but today was overcast and rainy and so I took advantage of the rain. I didn't have any parm cheese so I grated about 1/4 cup cheddar and added it for the last 15 minutes. I've already wiped out about half of it just out of the oven. I couldn't stop eating it, it was so good.

I added an extra clove of garlic and still found it to be a little bland the first day.  I added some garlic powder to it the next day, it was very good leftovers.  I leave the skin on the potatoes.

What a great flavor!  I should have cut the zucchini larger because mine got pretty soggy before the potatoes were tender.  Live and learn...we will definitely make this again.  My 11 month old son LOVED this!

I took others suggestions and added parmesan cheese.  It was really good, but I don't think it was so good it deserves 5 stars.  Definitely would make it again though.  Goes great with london broil!

We made this dish yesterday for dinner.  It was very easy to make and tastes great!  The veges could be cut up and placed in the dish and refrigerated for baking the next day for dinner (just to make things even easier).  Adding parmesian cheese (as suggested by others) was a great idea...added extra flavor.  We're going to try adding mushrooms next time.  A fresh salad as a side dish would go great with this dish for dinner.  Thanks for sharing this receipe!  We'll definitely make this a regular item for our family menu!

Added a little garlic, butter and salt, just make sure the zucchini and the potatoes touch, that way the potatoes get soft too.

Used a little cajun seasoning in place of the paprika.  I eat this as a main dish (vegetarian) and also serve it as a side dish with my husband's steak.  Great right out of the oven...a little mushy as a leftover.  Still tasty though!!

This was so good! I wanted some sort of side dish for steaks that we were grilling.   I had just picked some small yellow zucchini from the garden and had some red potatoes in the pantry. I cut the potatos small and sliced the zucchini in 1/4 inch slices, added onion. I didn't have any red pepper. I tossed everything with olive oil then added the rest of the ingredients. I also found some broccoli that I had cut from the garden so I added that. It was delicious and everyone loved it! I will make again!!

This was pretty good. I think I would have liked a more zucchini to potato ratio. It needed more seasoning and what one person liked as not "slimy" I felt was dry. Also, during the summer I don't believe it would be good to keep opening a 400 degree oven.

This was fairly tasty. The zucchini doesn't get too soft. I found it requires more seasoning, especially salt. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and this worked better. Has anyone tried this with sweet potato?

My husband and I really like this recipe.  I am going to make a big pan of it for thanksgiving.  I only have one question...should the bread crumbs be toasted before I add them in?  I used two slices of whole wheat bread, untoasted, and they turned out mushy.  But overall it was really good.

Not as fabulous as the reviews indicated, but a nice accompaniment to a plain grilled meat.  I did add the parmesan as so many recommended but really couldn't taste it. I also used Italian style bread crumbs - this would have really been bland without.

I loved this recipe.  I followed other reviewers advice and added parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs.  It's excellent!  A great summer side dish.
