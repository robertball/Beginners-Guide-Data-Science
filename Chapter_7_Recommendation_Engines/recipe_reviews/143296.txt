I submitted this recipe, so keep in mind the rating is biased...unfortunately the editors took out my notes from the original submission, but I think there are a couple of things that will help prepare this.  1) Curry paste is a mixture of curry powder, ghee, lemongrass and other spices.  It can be found commercially at places like Amazon or high end grocery stores like Bristol-Farms in San Francisco.  Any color/flavor of curry will do, as per your preference.  They even have variety packs you can get.  2) One can substitute lite coconut milk and it is 60% less calories and fat and tastes the same (also available at places like Amazon).  3) Add 1 tablespoon or more curry paste, depending on your spice level desired.  1 T is about low-medium spice.  If you over-spice, add more brown sugar (this only works to a limiting degree).  4) Prepare and stir in rice or cellophane noodles for added texture.  Also can be served over rice or with naan.  5) Mix up the vegetables.  Add cubed potatoes, beans, mushrooms or whatever.  Frozen vegetables can easily be added.

Great recipe! Tastes like restaurant curry.  It is important to TRIPLE the curry paste and curry powder.  I first made it with the recipe proportions and it was bland.  To fix the batch, I repeated the first step of cooking the paste and powder in a saucepan and just added that to the first batch and the taste was perfect! I used the Thai Kitchen red curry paste.

I LOVE this recipe! I have added straw mushrooms before or substituted chicken for tofu and chickenbroth for vegetable broth. It is still delicious! (when substituting tofu: drain tofu, put between paper towels and put weights on top. I usually use canned goods inside of a pan. After an hour, cut the tofu into triangles and sprinkle yellow thai curry on both sides. Fry in 2tbls of olive oil and add to the dish when it is in the last 5 minutes of cooking.)

I LOVED LOVED LOVED this - tasted just like when we were in Thailand (or the closest I've come since then, anyway).  Thank you for sharing! The only change I made was to substitute chicken breasts for the thighs - and I followed the advice above and added an extra tsp of curry paste.   AWESOME. I will definitely be making this again!

I'm not sure what kinds of Thai curry some of these 5 star reviewers have had, but based on what my mother's Thai friends have made for me, this doesn't even come close - lol.  That said, it's not a bad recipe.  Just not the kind of thai curry that I'm used to.  It was way too bland for my liking and I don't think I will be making it again.

This was my first attempt with this type of food, and I followed the recipe. I will use a bit more paste next time because I prefer med/spicy, but this was easy and VERY good!

Very good curry chicken!!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Used chicken breasts because that is what I had on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly & it was perfect. Served over brown rice.  Next time I may leave the pineapple out just because I think it would be just as good without it. Also made Fresh Spring Rolls with Thai Dipping Sauce & Sukhothai Pad Thai from this website. They were good together although it was alot to prepare at once.  TRY THIS RECIPE!!!  AWESOME!

My husband is a "don't do anything to the meat, just leave it alone" kind of guy so whenever I get a thumbs up on a creative recipe, it's a keeper!  This was great!  Didn't have peas, subbed fresh mushrooms and topped with cilentro upon serving. Thanks for the great recipe!

Nice mix of spice and sweet...even after I added more...and more green curry paste and powdered curry late in the game. I used bean sprouts, brocolli, shitake mushrooms, green pepper, carrot, green onion and sweet onion and cabbage I had on hand. I added a little of the juice from the canned pineapple mixed with cornstarch as well as having added the cornstarch per directions.  I cooked Orzo to use in lieu of rice.  Probably could have added the Orzo when simmering as far as that goes. It was too much work de-fatting the thighs...I'll use boneless skinless thighs next time...or tenders...or breasts. Season to taste is the best idea of course.

This was very good.  The only thing I didn't like was the fish sauce, I will definitely leave that out next time or sub soy sauce.  We like our curry hot, so I tripled the amount of curry paste, and it still wasn't very hot, so next time I would add even more and perhaps sub the bell pepper for a hotter type.  Thanks for the great recipe

I did not care for this.  It was way to bland.  Unless you got a pineapple in your bite it was completely flavorless.  I even added some thai basil and that didn't even help the flavor much.  I did as someone else said and used a little less fish sauce and maybe that is some of the problem...but I can't imagine adding that back would do to much.  Sorry, I will NEVER make this again!

So good.  I added mushrooms and bean sprouts too.  I think that next time I will cut the fish sauce in half though.  And I'm going to add bamboo shoots and basil.  It was almost as good as what I get at the Thai restaurant.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Delish!  I made a lot of substitutions because I did not have everything on hand.  Used soy sauce instead of fish sauce, chicken breast instead of thighs, 1 Tbsp red curry powder because I didn't have curry paste, and canned crushed pineapple instead of fresh...and it was still fabulous!

This recipe was fantastic! I only had hot red pepper paste (traditionally used for Asian recipes) but it still turned out very nicely. I substituted shrimp for the chicken. I omitted the peas, bell peppers, and used bamboo shoots and some fresh onion. The hot madras curry powder gave it a great spice. I will make this again and again!

I found this extremely bland, and I altered it a bit.  I added almost 5 tsp of the Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (and it was still very mild), ground ginger, black pepper, oregano, salt, pepper and granulated garlic, as well as half a commercially prepared seasoning mix for Thai chicken.
I also added bamboo shoots, fresh bean sprouts, snap peas, green and red pepper, celery and onion.
I am researching the traditional Thai spices to see what would bring out better flavour.
That said, my husband and 5 year old son REALLY liked it, so that was a bonus, and I will make it again and tweak it more somehow.

I am giving this a 4 because I can't do a 3 1/2.  This recipe really does have some good "bones" but does lack some depth of flavor.  The fish sauce is disgusting in this and I had to doctor it up to cover up that horrid taste!  And I only used 1 tsp....That being said, I added garlic, onions, pineapple juice and basil to make it just OK.  It really does depend on the curry you use, too.  I think this is a great starting point for what could be an awesome curry!!   Thanks for the post!

This was a terrific and easy recipe.  I doubled the amount of green curry paste, and mixed in basmati rice.  Leftovers were great too- next time I will double the recipe and eat it during the week.

Not bad, but pretty bland. Had to add a LOT more curry to give it some flavor. Would recommend cooking it longer too to let the flavors soak into the meat.

We loved it. But I made some modifications so 5 stars with the changes. I used a bit more Green curry paste and added some onion, Serrano chili, garlic, Cilantro & Thai basil. We like it hot and I love the fresh herbs which I have in my garden, so I just had to use them. Great base recipe and will be using this one again. Tasted just like I used to get at my favorite Thai Restaurant in Los Angeles area. Yum!

If you are used to typical Indian curry, then this recipe is not for you, it is more of an USA version of a curry. I still found it tasty and will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe closely, and found the curry to be very sweet. I would try it with perhaps 1/2 cup of Brown sugar next time around. Will let you know.

Definitely increase the curry paste/powder. I would advise leaving out the frozen peas and sub them with fresh snow peas or bamboo shoots. The peas dont seem right for an authentic thai dish.

This was a nice easy, mild curry.  I followed the recipe closely except for the pineapple (was out!).   I had a bunch of shredded dark chicken meat so I just tossed that in during the last 20 minutes of cooking.   Served over basmati rice, it made for an easy tasty dinner.

This was simply delicious curry.  The only changes I made were to saute 1 small onion and 3 cloves of garlic for a few minutes before adding the curry powder and paste.  I also used b/s chicken breasts and I upped the curry paste to about 1 tbsp.  It also needed some salt; about 1 tsp did the trick.  I will make this often - thank you Kristy!

I've been using this site for 6 years and this is my first review. Because this recipe was so GREAT! This is as good as restaurant quality Chicken Curry. I will use it again and again. I make it w/ lo mein noodles instead of rice. Rice is god but tends to soak up all the delicious sauce. Thank you for perfecting this recipe for me!!

I completely forgot to add the pineapple, but the rest of this recipe was fantastic!  I had cooked and diced chicken thigh meat so after simmering for 10 minutes I added the precooked chicken and simmered for another 5 minutes or so.  I served it over rice noodles.

Love this dish! I added the entire red curry paste container plus 1 heaping tsp cayenne pepper. This kicked up the heat perfectly. Oh and a finely chopped jalapeño. Substituted pineapple with 3 very ripe mangos. Delicious!

I really liked this. Used red curry powder and tripled based on reviews here. WAY too much spice. Maybe a mild curry powder tripled would have been ok. Tried to temper it with broke

This recipe came out great.  I took the advice of some of the other reviews and doubled the chili paste.  I also added lemon grass, onions, carrots, green beans, mushrooms, and ground Thai chilis.  The chilis added a little kick but not too much to overwhelm the flavor profile.  I added six dried peppers for a double batch.  Recipe is easy to make and goes great over jasmine rice.

Doesn't get any better than this!  I added green beans as well and leeks (because they were on sale)... soooo good!  As some of you have said...tastes exactly like the Thai restaurant we attend.

This is the recipe I have been searching for!!  The sauce was fantastic.  Yes - it makes a big difference which curry paste you use.  I chose to combine a very spicy green curry paste with a less spicy red one to suit my family's taste, and sauteed them with the curry powder in a little safflower oil before adding the other ingredients.  I substituted chicken breast and also added some chopped scallions with the pineapple at the end.  This is an extremely easy and versatile recipe that I intend to use again and again - thanks so much for submitting!

Tastes just like my favorite Thai restaurant's red coconut curry. I made it for my Dad and he loved. It's not overall spicy so my toddler eats it up no problem. I serve it over jasmine rice that I cook up in the rice cooker while I am making the curry. I have made this recipe a dozen times now. It is very easy recipe with very little mess so clean up is easy. I never would imagined it would be so easy to make curry. Sometimes I add an extra tablespoon of curry paste to spice it up a bit more. The only change that I make per another reviewer is I add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of cooking oil to the curry paste and curry powder and cook up the mixture until it is fragrant.

I really liked this recipe!  It does taste like restaurant thai curry chicken.  Even my two picky toddlers ate it!  I modified it slightly, 1/2 cup of chx stock only, ommited peas, and had only crushed pineapple that I drained/squeezed the juice from (about 1/2 cup).  The best time to tweak the taste to your liking is after you add the chicken stock to the saucepan.  I had to put a few more dashes of curry to my liking.

This is fabulous!!!  This is better (and cheaper) than the Indian restaurants here in England!  I added an onion and added a little extra brown sugar.  Next time I will definitely add more curry paste or maybe some hot peppers sliced very thin (like I've seen in the Indian or Thai restaurants).  If you're unsure about making our own curry dish - make this one!!! It's very easy and tasty!!!

I thought this was very good, although it did need salt. For my husband, it could probably have been hotter, but I liked it just mild.  Didn't have any fish sauce, so added oyster sauce (isn't that a little fishy?), and used chicken breasts instead of thighs. My carrots were still a little crunchy so I'll probably blanche them next time. For those that thought the sauce was too watery, just add a little more corn starch.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Kristy.

Like other reviews, I would give this a 3.5 star rating.  It’s ok, just not great.  I would make it again, but would have to alter some things a bit.  This was an okay recipe for me.  I lost my favorite recipe, and decided to try this.  I followed all of the directions except for I didn’t have peas, and I added bamboo, water chestnuts, carrots, and canned pineapple instead of fresh.  I also added a little extra chili paste.  The fish sauce was heavy for me.  I don’t really like it in the first place, but can tolerate it in small amounts in recipes...it was a little too fishy smelling for my taste, but the curry tasted ok.  I served it over some coconut rice, which added to it a little.  I think this recipe is missing something, just not sure what.

Made a couple changes at the start,  but it turned out fantastic.  First I took the advice from a reviewer on a different recipe and cooked the curry powder and paste in a bit of oil for 5 minutes, then added the chicken and cooked it, then the onion until soft, then a clove of garlic.  After that i followed the recipe as is and it turned out incredible.  Had it with rice, and baked sweet potato cubes and naan bread. Will definitely make it again.

This was very tasty. My 8-year-old son enjoyed it as well. I did two tablespoons of curry paste and it wasn't too spicy for him but we, at the suggestion of my foodie friend, added Siracha to ours to bring up the heat. So, if you have guests who don't like spicy foods, this is an option that doesn't distract from the wonderful depth of the curry. The sauce was thin and I prefer it thicker but will definitely make it again. Thanks Kristy for the recipe.

I made this for a Thai themed church luncheon and it was a big hit. I did increase the curry powder and paste as recommended by some posters. I made basmati rice and added it to the dish before serving.

We really like this,  but made several changes. We like ours really spicy so added another full tsp of red curry paste and a couple of tsp of  curry. :) We also used chicken breast instead of thighs and canned pineapple. It was delish. Thank you!

I don't like coconut milk (and thus frequently don't care for Thai curries) but I used almond milk and loved this.

we loved this.. tripled the curries as KellyStar suggested.. used red bell pepper in place of green.. added half a cup of canned baby corn and 5 good sized  white mushrooms.. for the chicken stock i added 1/2 t of chicken bouillon to the water amounts.. reduced it a lot longer than 25 minutes probably about 45 minutes on very low heat.. so good.. wouldn't mind adding broccoli in another variation.. added in 2 cups cooked white rice.. ty so much for this recipe

Oh my goodness!!! My husband says this is better than our Thai restaurant's curry chicken and the best dish I've ever made. Will be making this again and again. I didn't add the pineapple as I don't like warm fruit, but followed the recipe exactly and even doubled it. So glad I did because it was even better the next day. I will definitely be making this for company. It was time intensive for the prep, so it will be great to make the day before and then heat up and make fresh rice the next day for guests.

Didn't have coconut milk so used double the amount in coconut water instead.  Doubled the amount of curry and curry paste.  Added a can of rinsed chick peas.  Served with whole wheat Naan bread, with sides of plain yogurt and mango chutney just for fun.  Delicious!

Great Recipe.  I read the reviews and did a little tweaking also.  I fried onions and garlic, added a little extra coconut milk and doubled the curry paste and powder.  I also used Pork as I did not have chicken.  Served with coconut rice (with lemongrass/cinnamon).

I followed the recipe exactly because i was afraid it would be too spicy. I was way wrong. I should have doubled the curry paste. I haven't made Thai food before so this was my first try. If i were to make this again, I'd use 2 tsp curry paste and another tablespoon brown sugar. Thanks!

I made this recipe today, and it was a huge success. I doubled the amount of curry powder and curry paste, I think if you used the suggested amounts it would be quite bland. Next time I'll triple it. :-) Also I used frozen pea and carrot mix, with a fresh bell pepper.

This was good, but WAT too bland. Add more curry, i would get 50% more. When you add the coconut milk, let it simmer longer, so that it reduces, that will help intensify the coconut flavor. Other than the above it was good.  I added bamboo shoots because I love them.  I also had some basil on hand, I chopped that up and added it at the end, along with the pineapple.

I made this recipe last night and my family loved it! I used frozen mixed veggies and added some potatoes. The next time I make this I will eliminate the pineapples, I personally don't think they added any flavor and add a little more curry. Overall great recipe!!

Delicious!  Definitely almost as good as what you would get in a restaurant.  I used shredded meat from a rotisserie chicken and added some sliced scallions, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I've tried making Thai food before with little satisfactory result, but this recipe ended differently luckily.  This is a very good basic Thai recipe.  I made this without chicken and pineapple and instead substituted a bunch of vegetables (potatoes, baby corn, mushrooms, carrots), some cashews, and some fried tofu and was pleasantly impressed with the results.   If there was a 4.5, I'd give it to this recipe.

This is a great make-at-home Thai recipe for those of us without authentic ingredients around. I didn't even have fish sauce tonight, and sub'd soy sauce. Assembled a different way, too. Browned cubed chicken breast first, then added everything else. The Thai Kitchen green curry paste is great -- a rounded tablespoon gives a nice kick.

LOVE THIS!! This is one of my favorite recipes of all time!! I really dont change much besides adding all the vegetables that are in the house in addition to a lil extra spice. also I make it with whole grain wheat rice for a little healthier option. the pinneaple is the finishing touch with a little sweet taste.

We think this is a great basic Indian recipe to have on hand.  Due to food allergies, we had to leave out the fish sauce, peas, green pepper and pineapple  (a lot - I know!) - so we just substituted more carrots and served it over cooked jasmine rice.  Thank you for this recipe - it's hard to find things that everyone in our family can eat!
