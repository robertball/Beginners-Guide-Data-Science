This is the best pie ever. I use fresh or frozen cherries and replace tapioca with corn starch. It works great. I received so many compliments from friends and family, and I bake this pie at least once a month.
Thank you for this great recipe!

A wonderful, traditional cherry pie recipe.  A classic.  The almond extract makes all the difference.

When fresh cherries are in season I buy in bulk while they are on sale.  I have a deep freeze so I buy and pit (with cherry pitter I bought at Crate n Barrel for $15.) them all in one sitting.  I typically pit about 6 pounds, enough for 6 pies throughout the year. I thaw them out for each pie for baking.  NOTHING CAN BEAT FRESH CHERRIES even if you freeze them for later use.

Loved this pie!  Made it for Thanksgiving dessert.  I'd had problems in the past with my pie being too runny, which sent me looking for a new recipe.  Because of that problem, I used more tapioca than called for, which kept it good and firm.  Also, I used 3 cans of cherries, so probably needed to compensate with thickener anyway.  I used a slightly larger 2 crust pie crust recipe, which calls for 2 cups of flour.  If you want that, you could probably find it on this site, and definitely in any basic cookbook.  All in all, wonderful!

This recipe is so easy!!! I looked at many recipes and they seemed difficult to make the inside filling from scratch. I'm not the best at cooking but this recipe rocks. Even if your horrible at Lattice work (like me) you can take cookie cutters and make stars all over the top or hearts or any shape for any occasion. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

A very nice traditional cherry pie. I used fresh pie cherries instead of canned and the filling was very nice - not too sweet. I used my own oatmeal pastry recipe per my families request but I will use this filling recipe again.

I really loved this pie and so did everyone else.  I used my own crust recipe and fresh tart cherries, but the rest was the basically the same.  The almond extract is really what makes this special.

This was pretty good!  It was also my first successful pie, yay me!  My husband is an avid lover of cherries, but alas, unless they are cooked, he's very alergic to them.  So, when I found this recipe, he insisted that I make it.  I just gave him a skeptical look given my unfortunate lack of success in making any kind of dessert, no matter how easy it is. (when I say lack of success, I mean unedible)  Still, I wanted to give it a shot all the same.  I was VERY surprised (and utterly delighted) when it turned out, not only tasty, but presentable as well.  Talk about a boost to cooking self-esteam.  Thanks for the great recipe!! :D

This recipe is easy and not too sweet.  Instead of the traditional pie crust try a crumble topping.

I thought it was just average, to be honest. But my friend loved it! He said this pie was flavorful, and really liked the addition of tapioca. We actually did a taste test for cherry pies and this recipe was his favorite.

Very good, I like tart cherries but I must admit it could us a little more sugar next time, perhaps.  And a smige more thickner.  Otherwise, very good!

Very good pie, I used 2 cans of sour cherries plus 2 cups of fresh cherries.  Vanilla extract in place of almond and 3 Tablespoons was perfect or the amount of cherries I used.  I will make again!

Loved the almond flavoring in this pie!  My only complaint was that the filling was super-thick and gelatinous. so I will have to double-check the amount of tapioca I'm adding next time.  Since I used two 10" pie plates, I tripled the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it was the best cherry pie I ever tasted.  The cherries I used were very red, so I didn't need the food coloring, but that wouldn't make any difference in the taste anyway :)

Great and simple recipe! This was my first cherry pie, I used my own pastry recipe though. Don''t be afraid of the mix being too liquid, it will dry well especially if you are making a lattice pie.

This pie was really good and I am not a cherry pie fan.  I used fresh cherries and added a little more sugar.  Wasn't runny at all.

I've made this several times and it is always a hit (and super easy too).  I make this with a gluten-free crust (store bought) and it is still delicious.  You do need to use tart cherries just as the recipe says.  Always gone the same night I make it.

This was pretty easy and good, but not enough cherries. I'd definitely add an extra can next time. Also. I've never used canned cherries before, but apparently they're a weird grayish-burgundy/mauve color. I might add that food coloring next time, since your eyes eat first!
