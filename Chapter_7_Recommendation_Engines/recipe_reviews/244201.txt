First review on Allrecipes, and I'm very excited to be reviewing Chef John! The toasting of the butter does add a little something - rustic country flavor perhaps, but nutty. I enjoyed making this recipe with both my family and was even simple enough for an after school program that I teach at. I would have liked more color on the biscuit, but any longer in the oven would have burned the bottoms. Overall it was a treat, and I'm happy that everyone loved them. - Tiffani

It was soooo good! Brown your butter! It doesn't take that long. I did sprinkle turbinado sugar on top instead of regular sugar. I like the crunch of turbinado sugar on baked goods. Anyway, this was a fantastic dessert. I will make it again. Especially, during strawberry season. I will mash up 1/4 or so of the strawberries next time.

So good. I never would have thought the browned butter could make such a difference.  I actually followed the recipe exactly which is a rarity for me.  thanks much.

I'll be honest, I didn't brown the butter.  I was doing a couple other things while making these and didn't want to spend the time babysitting the melting butter.  That said, these still came out amazing.  I've always had the traditional sponge cake style shortcake and the biscuit style of this recipe is a kazillion times better!  I love how it holds the sweet syrup from the strawberries (to which I added a tbsp of balsamic vinegar, as suggest by chef John, amazing!), and the added texture was divine.  I will always make my strawberry shortcake this way from now on.

It took a couple of attempts, but I got the biscuits right the 2nd time. First time I followed instructions to the letter and burnt the bottoms beyond salvage. Time 2 I made plenty of adjustments for my oven (which clearly runs too hot) and the biscuits came out perfectly. Yay!
Specifically, I raised the rack to the highest position, used parchement paper over an air bake pan (and allowed the biscuits to cool on the pan) and only baked for the minimum time (15min.). They probably would have handled 16 minutes, but after last time, I wasn't taking any chances. Woohooo!

Loved the biscuit-y shortcake.   Only change I made was because I like a little more juice in my strawberries, so that it really soaks into the shortcake.  So I used a potato masher to roughly mash  about a fourth of the strawberries.  Tastes the same - just juicier.  Great recipe!

Really great!  My mom loves it.  I made it for her after she went to a restaurant looking forward to getting strawberry shortcake only to discover that they had run out for the day.   This was just as good if not better!  I accidental cut the dough into 8 pieces instead of six but that seems like a good serving size.  Personally, I enjoyed snacking on a plain piece shortcake.  Thanks Chef John!

I normally use the Bisquick box recipe for my strawberry shortcake,  but was out of it and made this one by scratch. Maybe my self rising flour was too old, but these didnt rise enough for my liking. Shortbread is a drier biscuit normally, but when this didn't rise it became extra dense. Sucked all the moisture from the ice cream I layer between the bread and the strawberry juice. Truthfully, I prefer the taste and consistency of the  Bisquick shortbread.

Easy to follow recipe,  instead of self rising flour I used regular flour and added 1 tsp baking powder + 1 tsp salt. Came together really quickly, not too sweet. Could start with cutting strawberries first to save time and get those yummy juices flowing. I will make it again.

EDIT: I see he has a modification above for self rising flour v. regular flour; I didn't see that until now. He uses 1 T baking powder + 1 tsp salt.

This is almost as good as my mom's and that's a huge compliment. I'm glad I found this recipe, it has only a few ingredients and is so easy to put together.  This will be my go to recipe for shortcake.

Delicious.  Made exactly as written/shown.  Was by far the most popular version of strawberry shortcake I’ve ever made (and yes, I make it often).

Will definitely make again!  Followed the recipe precisely and it was as tasty as I expected.  Super easy to make with one caveat, toasting the butter requires your total attention. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed! Chef John - whenever I'm looking for a new recipe I look for a you!

Easy and quick.  Followed the alternative method using regular flour, salt, and baking powder ant they came out perfect.  Guess now I will run out of strawberries before running out of shortcake.  Guess I need more strawberries.  Not a bad problem to have.

nice and tender shortcake/biscuit recipe, even with substitutions (so, it's forgiving, too). i didn't have cream, so i substituted it for more milk and added a little vinegar to make "buttermilk." i also didn't have self-rising flour, so i used a combo of regular and whole wheat AP flours plus three teaspoons baking powder. butter smelled wonderful browned, but i suspect the flavor was overtaken by the whole wheat in the flour. lesson learned for next time.
