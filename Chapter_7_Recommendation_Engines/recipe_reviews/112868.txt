Loved this recipe! I changed a couple of things, used fresh basil instead of dried, added chopped onion and garlic, spooned in tomato paste to kick up the color and add a little thickener, bought canned roasted red peppers (way easier), and added a splash of sherry in the bowl before spooning in the soup. Superb!

I LOVE this soup! I like a little more texture, so I added sauteed onion and celery and left about 2 1/2 peppers unblended. I skipped the 1/2 & 1/2 and topped this with whipped cream and chopped flat-leaf. Soooo good. I can't wait for crab to be in season so I can use big chunks of Dungeness, instead of the flake white crab meat (which was lovely, but not the same...). Thanks for the recipe - a definite keeper!

I made this recipe for a mid-winter dinner party.  It was exceptional!  I prepared the soup (everything except the crab) the day before. Peeling the red peppers was easy enough, but it was still quite tedious and took about 40 minutes to do.   I found that the places where the skin was blackened peeled very easily; the places where the pepper pieces didn't lie flat did not blacken and so did not peel as easily. I used only 1/2 tsp salt, deciding to let the guests add more if they wished. I used the full 1/4 tsp of cayenne knowing that our friends don't mind spicyness.  When I tasted it, it was quite spicy, but not overly.  I refrigerated the soup overnight. I added the crab when starting to reheat the soup about 30 minutes prior to serving.  The cayenne had mellowed overnight. The soup's flavour was absolutely lovely.  It was worth all the effort.  Thanks.

This is an okay, average tasting soup that on its face might be worthy of three stars.  However, when you consider the effort involved (I not only roasted the peppers but made my own chicken broth as well) and the expense (crab meat is not cheap, particularly the jumbo lump crab I used) hubs and I both agree this is a mediocre soup, boring, bland and uninspired.  Sherry might have been a nice addition, as well as maybe starting this off by sauteeing the "holy trinity" of carrots, onions and celery. Fish stock or clam juice could be used as well, and would have complemented the crab. It definitely needs more depth and rounded out flavors.  As is, it basically tasted no more than what it was - pureed roasted peppers and half and half with some crab meat thrown in at the end.

This is a good substitute for the lobster bisque I crave from my favorite restaurant. I used imitation lobster since I didn't have any real crab or other seafood in my house and I was looking for a good dish to warm up for dinner after class tomorrow. I also used evaported skim milk instead of the cream and it was just as good (much less fat). Very tasty!

Very good soup.  This method of roasting the red peppers is so much easier/quicker than doing them whole.  I will use this method from now on.  I used 3 cans of evaporated milk in lieu of the half-n-half.  It's a very rich soup, and with the cost of crab, a very expensive soup, so I won't be making it often, but it's a great recipe to file under "dinner party".

I used fresh garlic and basil but otherwise followed the recipe...It's even better the next day!  Just the right amount of heat.  I think I'll try it without the crab for a soup and sandwich night...

This was wonderful!  My husband was skeptical when I first told him I was going to make it, but he loved it so much that he told me he would never doubt my judegment again.  I think next time I'm going to try it with bacon instead of crab, since I'm not too crazy about crab.  The presentation is beautiful, especially with a little parsley on top, and I can't wait to make it for my next dinner party.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this soup for a ladies luncheon today and I am now a hero.  With crab at $29.00/lb. I'd better be something. Other than peeling of the peppers, it goes together pretty fast and easy.  I almost made it as written but the calorie fairy was screaming in my ear so I used non fat half n half, fresh garlic and added a couple tbls. of tomato paste ( have you all discovered the tomato paste in the tube...love the stuff and no waste when you just want to add a small amount ).  Used the 'ole immersion blender, which I love, because you don't have to dirty the blender.  Even the lower fat version was sinful.  I made 5 copies of the recipe cuz I had 5 ladies and they all wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this impressive recipe.

Is a wonderful soup.. One hint about the red peppers you can roast them on the grill or in the oven as mentioned but then immedietly add them to a bowl of ice cold water and let them cool and they will be easy to peel.

Made this today for a simple b-day dinner for my husband.  I don't usually review as I often tweak a recipe based on our preferences or dietary needs. I think this recipe can take a lot of changes based on preference/need and still be fantastic.  I used fresh garlic and, since it was in the fridge, half a small onion.  Upped the cayenne, added Old Bay (I live in MD - I think it is a crime here to not use Old Bay when working crab), and used fresh basil. Last, I used soy milk in lieu of half and half for diet needs.  I made it this afternoon and put it in the fridge. Tonight when we came home, I pulled it out, added a dollop of sherry (and I can't say that was necessary just a b-day frill) and the crabs.  Ahhh!  Delish!  For those who are having trouble peeling the peppers, try a gentle squish.  The flesh of the pepper seems to just slide away from the skin. It took me about 12 minutes to peel the peppers and I went through the peels a second time to make sure I got every bit of pepper I could.

Great soup.  It is a must to use fresh peppers. Some of the other reviews suggested using can, i feel this would be a grave mistake.  I followed some advice of others and prepared it the night before. Some of my guests that don't even like soup loved this.

On a post surgery puree diet and needed something different. made this with 4 bell peppers and 1 quart of skim plus milk and it was delish. I didn't have it with the crab, but ccan only imagine how much better it would be with it in it! Great recipe. I'll definitely be making it again!

We used a fish and vegetable stock, it made it a stronger seafood flavour. The bell pepper was really delicious. The soup was thinner than I expected, but still flavourful. However next time I will use less cream. We also used real garlic. It was very tasty, and I'm not even a seafood fan.

Very nice delicate flavor and just the right amount of spiciness from the cayenne.  I used a pint of milk and a pint of half & half to cut done on fat and also added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay and 2 tbsp of cooking sherry.  Great addition to our Valentine's Day dinner!

I made this for our first course soup on Christmas dinner.  I microwaved the potato to skip the 45 minutes to boil them.  I also boiled crab legs in the chicken broth until opaque then removed. Then I added the potato, roasted peppers, seasonings and half and half - then followed this recipe.  It ended up being the favorite part of dinner --- everyone asked for the recipe.  Some even had 2 or 3 bowls!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was positively divine!! I used imitation crab meat and added about a tbsp of sugar and thought I had died and gone to heaven. Even my bird, who doesn't care for anything other than corn and seeds, couldn't get enough of the stuff and I eventually had to stop feeding him mine and get him his own bowl!

This had a wonderful flavor and didn't overpower the crab.  I made a few little revisions (used Chicken Stock instead of Broth, Reduced Fat Half & Half and Fresh Basil.  I also used Creole pepper seasoning instead of the Cayenne).  Was perfect and everyone is asking for the Recipe.  It was a little pricy to make but well worth it.  Will definately make again and again.  Thanks

This soup is delicious!! The extra freezes well for another day!  I omitted the cayenne and sour cream garnish because we do not care for so much spice and the soup was tasty before adding the sour cream.

This was a really great recipe! 
Like everyone else I changed a few things. I added some cumin, rosemary, & thyme for spices. We had tons of roma tomatoes from the garden so i peeled and added 5 of those as well. Overall this was a great soup. 
I'll be making a large batch of this soup and freezing it so I can have it on hand throughout the year.

This recipe was really great!!  When i make it again i think I will not add the milk till the potatoes are done so it doesnt get that curdled lool but after i used the immersible it looked fine. I also added some extra heat but it really was fantastic!!

this was really good! i did change it a bit.  started off by sauteeing onions, garlic, and celery in olive oil. when they were soft, added 6 medium red potatoes (one would not have been NEARLY enough.) and vegetable broth. added seasonings, a little extra cayenne per our tastes, and also some parsley. let this heat up while the peppers roasted, peeled them and added them in. brought it to a boil and added the half and half. after the potatoes were soft, used my hand soup blender to puree all. got a lovely color and flavor. wish i had fresh crab, but had to go with 6 cans of lump crab and also threw in one can of baby shrimp. towards the end, added a few torn leaves of spinach for color and let them wilt in the heat. got lots of compliments!

Instead of roasting the red peppers myself I use 1 1/2 jars of it.  For us, the red pepper flavor took over the soup.  I would cut that in half next time and try again.

First time making soup and peeling the peppers took some time and effort (made the mistake of cutting some of them smaller than they should be)I was a little worried as it was simmering but after I put them in the blender the color looked great and tasted great too!!

This soup is lovely and easy to make.  I toyed with the idea of buying jarred roasted peppers, but in the end I decided to do the recipe exactly as written.  Very nice bisque type of flavor and the cayenne gives it a kick.  The crab is the icing on the cake.  This would make a lovely Friday night lent meal with bread and a salad. It makes a large amount. Great soup.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe for my friends and they all thought it was delicious.  I wanted it to be cost effective so I bought canned fancy crab instead of searching the seafood counter for fresh crab and it worked out wonderfully.  I also experimented with the spices and added a little more garlic powder to spice it up some more.  It was a very rich, hearty soup that we all definitely enjoyed.

Very good soup.  I wasn't so sure while it was boiling--perhaps bc I used regular milk it looked all watery.  But after processing, it mixed together well and was good.  I didn't like the crab in it so much, though, so if I make it again I'll omit that.  Check out Sunny B's pic!  It's beautiful!

I didn't have enough chicken broth so I threw in a little water with it...didn't really measure how much potato or red pepper I put in there, since I was just making it for two people.  Also, I used cut up red pepper from the jar so I didn't peel the skins or anything.  Because I didn't follow exactly I didn't know how everything would turn out (did put the exact amount of spices recommended though). Boyfriend wasn't a huge fan, even though he likes both red peppers and crab; I, however, thought it was pretty good.  Something different, and it was pretty filling.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my god, this soup is wonderful. Tastes like it came from an upscale restaurant. Expensive and time consuming (preparing peppers) but worth it. Tastes even better the next day.

Good effort on a soup that has become quite popular in Virginia.  Somewhat bland - I kicked it up with a pinch of Old Bay.

Added a can of sweet corn and a scoop of sour cream instead of half and half, topped with smoked paprika and freshly cracked pepper, was super delish!

I really can't figure out why any recipe would call for roasting peppers skin side up 'til they blacken and then discard the skin. I kept the skin on and it added great flavor. I also made a double batch of soup but only used 4 red peppers. That was enough to fill a baking tray and it was an appropriate amount in the soup. Six would be way too many. This recipe is good but can be better.

This recipe turned out to be quite forgiving.  I purchased fat free half-and-half by mistake, used imitation crab instead of real crab, and stuck it in the refrigerator for 3 hours after the simmering step, and the flavor and consistency still turned out excellent.  Most of the preparation was very simple, except that it probably took me 25 minutes to get the skins off the roasted pepper quarters (even after steaming them per the directions).  I will definitely be making this again the next time red peppers are on sale.

Delicious. Some tips: the blacker the red pepper, the easier to peel. The steaming step is a good trick.  I used good quality canned crab for budgeting purposes and it is still delicious. I also didn't have enough half and half so I used two cups half and half and two cups skim milk. It still tastes decadent.

This is certainly a keeper for us.  My BF has already told me to plan on making it again next time red peppers go on sale!  I did roast them fresh which is a little time consuming, but really easy and offers so much better flavor.  I used 3 cups fat free half & half (all I had left) and played up the smokey flavor by adding a 1/2 tsp each lemon pepper, mesquite seasoning, and smoked paprika.

I thought this was delicious. I am allergic to  shellfish so I just used the imitation and turned out great.  I also made sure to blend the soup on high for about a minute to increase the thickness and really helped with the flavor.  I also added a few extra dashes of salt at the end after I tasted the final product.

Very good. I added some garlic and celery. Only blended 1/2 of it and added back to pan. Might cut back a little on the amount of crab next time

This soup was good, but needed something more. I used fresh basil and three garlic cloves instead of the dry seasonings. Doubled the cayenne and added a tsp. of Old Bay. I did use imitation crab, and I think that was what left me slightly disappointed. I will make this again with real crab.
