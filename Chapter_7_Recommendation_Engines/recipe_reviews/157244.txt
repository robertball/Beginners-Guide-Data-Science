I thought this drink tasted VERY strong of alcohol. Needed to pour half a glass of sangria and dilute with white soda. Even then it did not taste that great. Would not make again

This was good, but not sweet enough. We topped off the glasses with more ginger ale rather than club soda, and that was perfect.

Saveur served this at the Buckeye Gathering and I enjoyed it very much. I served this to a few guests and subbed Grand Marnier for the brandy. It was enjoyed by all! Thank you! / UPDATE: I have made this several times and I never use the ginger ale. I just add some club soda when served.

A tasty, light, refreshing sangria!  I made this for the AR Buckeye luncheon 6/11/11 and it received a "5" rating from those asked.  I left out the club soda, but otherwise made as published.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, very good.

Used Southern Comfort in place of brandy and Ginger Beer rather than ginger ale. Turned out great, super refreshing and easy drinking.

This  was an excellent Sangria. I made it with one bottle, added 1 extra tablespoon of Brandy, a full orange instead of half, and used diet gingerale, so there was minimal sugar and more kick from the alcohol !!!! And served it with Antipasto...verdict. AMAZING !!!!!!

Strong alcohol flavor, but where was the orange?  Did I miss an ingredient?  With 6 3/4 cups of alcohol, I thought it needed some type of OJ or concentrate.  Some Grand Marnier may have helped, but not enough to call this Orange Sangria.
