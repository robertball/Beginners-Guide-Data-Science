I've had real Coq Au Vin made by a French woman and this was definitely not the same.  However, it was still really good!  It makes a rich gravy and the chicken was so tender.  I used chicken thighs and didn't even cut the fat off of them.  Wonderful with mashed potatoes.  I will be making this again!

I waited until the last minute to look for something for dinner. I thought this could be easily adaptable to the skillet as I just didn't have time to throw everything in the crockpot. I used fresh sliced onion instead of frozen, pork chops (as that was what I had on hand (and it's white meat, so it's pretty interchangable when it comes to Campbell's Recipes), dried rosemary and I used half beef broth/half wine, so it wouldn't be too boozy for my kids. I dusted the chops with black pepper and rosemary and browned the chops in a little olive oil. Once they browned, I added a little more oil, then the mushrooms and onions and sauteed them before adding in the broth/wine and deglazing the pan. I then added the soup. After simmering for five minutes, I didn't need the cornstarch. It was plenty thick on it's own. I just covered the skillet and simmered for 15 minutes or so on low heat or until the chops were cooked through. I served it with rice. We all liked this, but I think it would have been better with some fresh minced garlic. I really appreciated this meal because it was easy for me to prepare on a "Mom's tired" kind of day and it used pantry ingredients which meant I could throw it together without having to make a trip to the store. And I'll tell you, my boys ate every bit of this. NO LEFTOVERS. Even the small one had seconds. That's enough of a winner for me.

This recipe is good, but not great. I did make some changes to try to give it some more flavor. I used sliced portabello mushrooms, onion, rosemary, and I also added some cooked bacon that I had leftover. The wine and soup made a decent sauce, but I did have to also add some garlic and a little bit of salt and pepper. I used a decent merlot that I had about 1/2 a bottle left over. I also waited until about the last 30 minutes before adding the cornstarch to make it thicker, just be sure you mix the cornstarch into cold water before adding to the hot liquid. I think I will make this again, but only after making a few more changes. I do not think I would use the golden mushroom soup. I will have to see what else I can come up with.

Kids and hubby didn't like it at all. Can't say it was the recipe because they have never had real Coq a Vin before so they have nothing to compare it to...

Cooking time was way off.  Next time I would bake it in the oven.  Funny color with red wine + mushroom soup.  (It became brown with a tad of Kitchen Bouquet.)  I took one reviewer's suggestion and thickened the sauce "later".  I served it over rice.  Nice gravy.  Oh yes, I added sliced fresh garlic, about 2 cloves.  :)

Mediocre at best.  This was very easy, but it wasn't all that great.  I did use all organic ingredients, so the soup I used wasn't exactly right.  Rather than Campbell's Condensed Golden Mushroom I used Amy's Organic Semi-Condensed Cream of Mushroom.  Maybe that would have changed things enough, but I'm doubtful and I'll never know because I always cook with organics only.

I tried this and it had no flavor, really. Then I tried jazzing it up with Worcestershire sauce, which didn't help all that much. Maybe this would be nice in a butter lined bread bowl, or for an elderly person who likes food without much flavor, but otherwise, I won't be repeating the experience.

Definitely tasted nothing like real Coq Au Vin.  It ended up tasting like chicken in a brown sauce.
