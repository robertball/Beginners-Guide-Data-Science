I love this recipe.  What I used to punch up the flavor was fajita chicken breast meat.  I live in Texas where we have the HEB stores and they have a variety of fajita chicken meat in a variety of marinades.  I used the Southwest flavor, because it is the same flavor I used for my chicken enchiladas.  Thanks for the share on the recipe; it's a hit with us!

Pump up the flavor by 1st gently cook onion and fresh garlic in a little olive oil. Rosemary is a fabulous herb to add to this combination. Finish off the bowl of soup with a nice healthy serving of parmesan cheese and a pinch of crushed red pepper.

I did not read the reviews before I made it or I would have seen that another review commented on the pepper. When I made it I was skeptical of the 2 tablespoons of pepper so I only added 1 Tablespoon. It still was too much. I would only add maybe 1/2-1 teaspoon. You can always add more later. Other than that, it was pretty good. We are always looking for gook kale recipes as we frequently get it in our produce co-op and it is very healthy.

Great soup!  A bit bland with just the original recipe but we seasoned to our taste and it was great!  Reheats great for leftovers.

This sounds like a great recipe.  But, I followed the directions and put the 2 tablespoons of black pepper in it. The end product was too apicy and inedible.  I question the use of that much pepper; otherwise it may be great.

The taste was a little too bland for my family.  Maybe I'll try it again with the flavored chicken as recommended by previous rater.

Very nice and easy.  I'm guessing the 2 tablespoons of pepper is a typo -- wayyyyyy too much.  I used approx. 1 teaspoon of pepper.

This soup was great, although i made a few additions:  a flour/water mixture to thicken the broth a little, 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast, and 1/8 cup of romano cheese.  My boyfriend and i are adding this to our make-again list!

Excellent and very flavorful variation of chicken soup. Refreshing combination of ingredients.

I would have given it 5 stars, but we added carrots, which made it much more colorful and nutritious looking. (i.e. I think it is 5 stars with the carrots).

This was amazing but 2 tablespoons of pepper is a little much!! Even one was too much I double ingredients and added carrots and 1 tablespoon was still too much!

This soup is, as my son would say, "the bomb!" Easy to make, great flavor! I read the review about the black pepper, so I reduced the amount. Fantastic on a cold night, or any night. This has become a staple in my house! Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.

I was looking for ways to try kale and I loved this one.  I like a thicker soup, so I pureed one of the cans of beans into the broth before adding the other ingredients.  I also took the suggestion from another post and added rosemary to my chicken when I was baking it.  Will probably also add it to the soup next time.
