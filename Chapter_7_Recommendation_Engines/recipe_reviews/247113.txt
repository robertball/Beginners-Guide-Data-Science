This is a great easy recipe...i looked or this everywhere and the only other one...the picture was terrible...or should i say the meal looked scary not something i wanted to bite into...i love this because basically it is a can of chili and cornbread on top...very filling for kids who love chili and adults who love their cornbread...finally someone posted...
