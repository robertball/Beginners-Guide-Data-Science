***Revision***

Not at all satisfied with this recipe.  With understanding black tea was omitted, you cannot possibly call this Chai without the tea.  The blend of spices was poorly balanced.  The taste of licorice root & fennel was much too much.  It was missing cardamom pods and ginger.  As well, the brewing time was much too long for spices alone.

This is by far the best tea I've ever had. I could not find licorice root. I used a few cinnamon sticks too. I also used a lot more honey.

The word Chai is Sanscrit for tea and the highly spiced sweet tea originated in India.  The addition of a cinnamon stick is almost required!  Through the years (I got the recipe from an Indian living in my area)I have decided to brew with water rather than the milk as done in India, and I use mostly green tea with just a few black tea leaves for the rich flavor.  I sweeten with honey and do use soy milk.  A sneaky way of adding protein to my favorite daytime drink.

I liked this even though I don't like fennel and liquorice flavors. After allowing it to steep the flavors mellow and really create a smooth drink. This was very nice to sip in the evening. Definitely a drink to serve after a meal. Thank you for the recipe.
