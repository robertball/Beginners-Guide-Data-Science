If you're ever up in the middle of the night and can't sleep, make this cake.  It takes HOURS to make and to roll out the little balls, but it's completely beautiful and tastes great.  I highly recommend it if you have the time!

I would have given this a five for it's taste, appealing crunchiness and looks, but there has to be something wrong with the recipe instructions.  How can you knead dough that's the consistency of cake batter?  Since it obviosly wouldn't have worked, I didn't knead before the first rising, but I added flour and kneaded before the second rising.

This cake was somewhat difficult to make, however it has crunch and its fluffy.  Very delicious flavor!  I loved it.

This great cake is hard to beat for a good looking and great tasting coffee crowd pleaser. There is more than enough "stuff" to fill that Bundt pan, take some and place a single layer in a 8 or 9 inch single layer cake pan too. One or two things that I'd change are: the note to preheat at the beginning. Wait intil that last 'punch' and into the 45 minute rise after that. Also, add about a third again to the butter and sugar-cinnamon for dipping and rolling, any left overs can be drizzled and dusted over the top of the pile in the pan. A winner with my crowd.

I love this recipe! I love the crunch, the taste, how fluffy, and how crumbly it is! It just a great recipe. I would have given it 5 stars but I think the recipe is a touch off somewhere. I added at least another 2 cups of flour, if not more, along the way to get it to a recipe I could at least touch and not be totally covered or it being like a batter.  I,also, ended up using more sugar and cinnamon but we have a bit of a sweet tooth in the house. What was left over, I just mixed with the butter and poured over the top. Extra, crunchy goodness! LOL!  I don't think this recipe is for the beginner baker though. It requires lots of time and patience, and sometimes, trial and error.   This is a fantastic recipe! I wouldn't attempt it if you didn't have a lot of time to spare. It took me around 4 hours from start to finish. I knew going into it that it was going to take a while so I was prepared.   It is well worth all the time you put into it! I will upload some pics.

Made it last night on a whim. It took a total of four hours (without letting the individual walnut-sized balls double in size [was running out of time]). I had some cinnamon sugar and butter left after rolling the dough in it, so I combined them and poured it over the entire mixture. It turned out excellent, everyone loved them. Taste was wonderful, just wish there was a bit more "Crunch" to it. There is nothing as good as the smell of it when its cooking! My coffee cake got done thirteen minutes early, so you may want to watch it closely, so you don't burn it.

The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars was because it is more like sticky buns than a coffee cake. I did increase the flour, adding an extra cup and instead of the warm water I used warm black coffee. Family likes the flavour and crunch. I will definitely make this again.

We have edited the steps in this recipe so that preheating the oven isn't the first step! We've also included the prep and baking times, as this is a yeast-raised dough. Our apologies for any confusion this has caused.

Excellent!  I wasn't sure how dipping and rolling the balls in butter and cinnamon/sugar was going to work out, but it was great.  It eliminated the dry, tasteless bottom half, which is a common problem with other coffee cakes. My cake turned out more like a cinnamon bread that was moist and flavorful all the way through, with a crunchy top. Because I like to use different flours, I substituted 1 c almond flour and 1/2 c whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 c all-purpose flour. Like other reviewers, I found that I needed to add more all-purpose flour to make the dough stiff enough to knead.  I think using the Bundt pan is important -- I used a regular 9" pan, and the middle of my cake fell a bit.

What a MESS. Taught me a few lessons though. Always read through a recipe before you start: I preheated my oven when it said to..not sure why considering it takes four hours to make. Which I also didn't realize. Guess we'll be having coffee cake for lunch, not breakfast. Also, I gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt, and went ahead and rolled (spooned) it out to try to knead before letting it rise. Spooned it right back in the bowl and let it rise for an hour and a half, then added a layer of flour on the top and a bunch of my dough mat. It was still pretty sticky, but doable. It's rising for the second time now..I hope it's worth all the time and mess.

I am a very skilled baker and after I made this recipe and I agree with the others, something isn't right with the amount of flour. The consistency was more gooey and I was unable to knead it. I added an additional cup of flour like many suggested but after it was baked it was hard and more like a bread. Considering how long it takes to make this, I was hoping to have a life changing experience but unfortunately I was very dissapointed.

It said coffee cake on the caption so I didn't think that it would take as long, but it was well worth it. I still needed to add in about 1 extra cup of flour while I was kneading the dough. I also Added two diced apples into the dough before I finished kneading it and it came out so freaken good!!

A lot of time and effort for a mediocre cake! Flour measurement was off and after baking, realized I should have added extra butter and cinnamon because it wasn't as gooey or flavorful as I would expect. My husband liked it, but he didn't spend all day in the kitchen or clean up the mess :)
Next time I will save my effort on the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe that uses the same ingredients (but adds a cream cheese frosting) and takes less time.  That recipe is 5 stars every time!

I would have to say that the only thing to change about this recipe is the amount of flour... I played it by ear and kept playing with the dough. Added flour until it was "dough". Although I have never worked with yeast on my own; my first attempt at this recipe was a fail but that has to do with the fact that I was trying to go the healthy route and used rice flour instead. I did use coconut sugar that is low in the glycemic index, which in fact made it taste sweeter. All in all, I do plan on using this recipe for coffee time post thanksgiving dinner. :)

Delicious. Instructions are a bit confusing, but it turned out wonderfully. Soft and moist with a crunchy exterior. I took the cake out 14 minutes early and it was perfect; keep an eye on it!

Looked and tasted divine, especially with applesauce, but WAY too time consuming. I enjoyed it, and so did my family, and after the 4 1/2 hours I spent, they better have enjoyed it!

Not enough flour, very sticky to deal with, and took too long to make (hours), not the kind of coffee cake I'm used to dealing with but thought I'd try it.  This is like a cinnamon bread, rather than cake.  Also too much cinnamon for our taste.  Overall, just felt like I'd wasted part of my day, maybe good for some, not for us.

This was a little time consuming, but according to everyone, it was well worth it!  I should have started it a little earlier, but other than that, I have no complaints!  It has made quite a bit, so we have plenty to share...my husband like to warm it up in the microwave and put butter on it.

Made this, exactly as its stated, but the “dough” was more like cake batter. Had to add quite a bit more flour to get it to be anywhere near dough. Then while kneading the dough, I had to again, add more flour. Not sure why it turned out this way, seeing as I followed the directions as they are written. Finally, the dough was ready to place in the lightly greased bowl. In the end, it turned out just ok. Had it not been for the sugar and cinnamon, it would be less than appetizing.

Anyone trying this recipe who has never kneaded wet dough before should read up on it before attempting it.  I Googled, and there were a lot of good instructional sites.  I am going to have to make it again, since I didn't know what I was doing the first time.  It was pretty good in spite of me!

My family and friends loved it, and my daughter enjoyed making it with me.  She called it "snickerdoodle cake" because of the similar process of rolling it in sugar.  It was thinner than cookie dough,as other reviewers have stated, so I basically used a spoon and dropped it into the butter and sugar mix, similar as one might drop dumplings in soup.  That worked pretty well.
