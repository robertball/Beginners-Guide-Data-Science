I tweaked the ingredients to fit my family's preferences, which worked fine.  However, following reviewers' suggestions to leave the sauce chunky did not work for me.  I ended up with chunks of vegetables floating in a little bit of liquid.  If I make this again, I will definitely follow the original recipe and blend it to get the right consistency.

I also left out the blender and served the sauce chunky.  Simple, yummy, and light.

This pasta dish was good but I would use about 1/2 the required amount of olives.  They ended up over-powering the dish.  I substituted chicken for the beggie crumbles and it was a nice combo.

This was simply wonderful!! Only difference when I made it...I left the sauce chunky, and it still tasted wonderful!
