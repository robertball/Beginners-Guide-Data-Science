If you're looking for an alternative to the traditional garbanzo bean hummus look no further. I could eat this with a spoon. The wine is the perfect complement for this hummus. The only problem I had with this was that it resulted in somewhat of a thinner consistency that I'm use to, nevertheless it did not detract from the flavor. Next time I will reserve the bean liquids and add a little at a time to arrive at the right consistency. The only change I made was toasting the sesame seeds for an additional depth of flavor. Thank you sueb for this keeper.

I felt the onion was too overpowering and the hummus was missing a little tang... maybe some lemon juice was needed.  Keep an eye on the pinto beans while cooking and give them a stir every once in a while.  The water evaporated out of mine and they burned to the bottom.  I had to cook a second time and turned the burner down to low instead of medium low.
