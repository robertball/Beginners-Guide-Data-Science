This was excellent! I did make two changes. I smoked a turkey breast this weekend on the smoker and so I used that instead of raw turkey. Because mine was already cooked, I didn't add it until the slow cooker step. My other change was the okra. I have okra in my garden this year so why not use fresh if you can you know? I did get a little heavy handed on the hot sauce and jalapeno making it a tad too spicy but that was my own fault. This is an excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way. Okra and wild rice go together like well...peas and carrots.
