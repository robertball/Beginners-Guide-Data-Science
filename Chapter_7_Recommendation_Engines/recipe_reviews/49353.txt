Am Middle Eastern and we make this dish all the time except that we add cumin to the lentils while they are cooking and a chicken bullion cube ..that really makes the great taste of this dish and diffentely differenciate it from being bland like some have commented.

This is a family staple. Best thing about being Arabic is the food... my god! Juddrah is one of my childhood favs!
One type, caramelize the onions as dark as you can without burning. The deeper you caramelize them the more delicious the end taste is.
Sour cream is a no.
Yoghurt is a yes. We eat everything with plain yoghurt and this is one of those dishes that is out of this world with yoghurt, salt, and a side of a cucumber salad.

Keep in mind, your whole house will reek when you cook this, so make sure you have good ventilation!!!

I rated this a 4 as a compromise. I would have rated it a 5, but my husband said he would have given it a 3 (He isn't very familiar with lentils - not that there was a problem with the taste. Because it tasted great!). I made a few slight alterations: I made it with 3 onions instead of 1, and I sliced them into half-rings before getting them good and browned, and I added 1 TBS cumin and 1&1/2 tsp garam masala to the lentils. Everything else I left the same. The house smelled wonderful while cooking and the leftovers were great the next day - even my toddler enjoyed it. Don't skip the yogurt, since the yogurt's tang definitely pulls the flavors together. I'll definitely make this again.

The original seasoning for Mujadarah includes not only salt and pepper, but cinnamon too. You will be surprised how well the cinnamon flatters the taste and aroma of the fried onion. Just be gentle with it, just a touch is all it takes.

This recipe is a definite "keeper".  Makes enough for quite a few meals if using it as a side dish.  I used 3 med. sized Vadalia onions which was good but I think next time an additional one to two onions would be worth a try.   I used brown rice and cooked with the lentils with no problems.  Cooking time was approx. 45 mins.  The amount of liquid I used was approx. 3-1/2 c.   I used chicken stock for a bit more flavor.   I added 1/2 tsp cumin to the lentil/rice mixture during cooking also added the pinch of cinnamon to the onions as suggested in another review---very good.

I have cooked this twice.  The first time I did exactly as the recipe said, but my rice was undercooked.  I ended up adding more water, and the consistency was that of risotto.  

The second time around, I used 3 cups of water + 2 chicken bouillons to cook the lentils, then I added the rice and added 2 more cups of water.  It turned out perfect and consistency was great.  

Also, to caramelize onions, it takes MORE than 10 minutes to ensure you are not just cooking them, but caramelizing them.  I cut the onions in rings and start cooking them as soon as I boil the lentils.  You have to make sure the fire is very very very low.  Your onions will caramelize beautifully and will have that perfect sweet taste.  It takes about 30 minutes.

I am a die-hard foodie, Middle Eastern specialist, and in the Arabic restaurant business for 40 years. I did not try to follow the recipe, which sounds on spot, but was interested in the reviews and only wanted to point out that this is a traditional vegetarian dish that is used in much of the Arab world but is a particular staple during fasting periods among Arab Christians when no animal products are consumed (like the chicken broth that some people added). Even Muslims and Jews of the region eat this only as a vegan dish. The yoghurt (laban) on the side is a regional preference (mine too) and is often substituted by some sort of lemony salad or picked vegetables,like turnips. This is an ancient and revered dishl for its simplicity and humbleness, and I just wanted to add some authenticity to the pot. I am delighted that so many people tried it and responded favorably!

Mujadarah is my favorit food. Try using Basmati rice which is also long grain but has that wonderfull taste. For the leftovers, you can store Mujadarah in the frig for a long time but it will get dry. So, add couple table spoons of water to the dry rice, toss well, microwave on 80% power until it is steaming again. Mujadarah also best eaten with big Greek Olives and a head of raw onions on the side. You breath will smell for a while but the taste is heaven.

The recipe didn't state how many cups of water you need to cook the rice and lentil together.  For some who are not so used to cooking or eating with rice, the recipe should indicate it clearly.  Yes, I agree with other viewers, you need to add cumin and cinnamon which in the original Egyptian mujadarrah dish calls for, the amount depending on your taste and liking, because some doesn't like the smell of the cumin.  Adding these spices would make a big difference.  And of course, yogurt and greek salad really goes well with this dish.  My husband is an Arab and he always make this dish and it's a family favorite.

This is one of my favorite recipes and I regulary do it. Being Lebanese and having grown up wit this food, we add some cumin to the lentils water just before we add the rice. It gives it a very nice taste and is no more bland. Try it. :)

This was difficult to screw up and tastes great! I added 1 tablespoon garlic puree, 2 tablespoons garam masala and fresh ginger.  I also threw in a beef bouilloun cube with the rice.  This is delicious, very filling and really economical too!  Will definitely make again.  Yum!

My Arabic teacher once made mujadarrah for his class and ever since then I tried to make it at home, but I never got it quite right until I tried this recipe.  The flavour, while simple, is very authentic.  It's also probably the easiest dish I've ever made.  Don't be afraid of burning the onions - they taste best when properly browned.

Nothing about this recipe is plain. The submitter of this recipe neglects to state how important it is to let the onions cook until brown... REALLY brown without adding salt... but don't let it burn! Difficult, I know. That step is SO important to the taste of this recipe that I can't emphasize it enough. I love it. Onions need to be cooked low and slow for a dark, rich color to form. But, don't add salt to the onions while they are cooking!  I know, it's not how we're used to cooking in the US. The onions actually get nice and brown with this cooking method. Try it, you may like it.

A great restaurant we have in Detroit is Steve's Back Room.  Their Mujadrah is fabulous and I've played w/ a recipe for a long time to try to recreate it.  First, start your thinly sliced onions in a wide, heavy fry pan.  Slice way more than you think you will need.  If you want to be very decadent, use a stick of butter. Sautee on very gentle heat for close to an hour.  I would cut back on the rice and let the lentils be the star.  Depending on whether you want the lentils to be 'mushy' or not will be the deciding factor in how much liquid and how long you cook it.  I like mine to be tender but not mushy. I usually add chicken broth in a 2:1 ratio w/ the lentils and rice, and throw in a pinch of cumin and gently simmer for about 20 minutes.  Definitely top each serving w/ the yogurt (plain) and the onions and pour a spoonful of leftover butter on as well.  A cucumber salad makes a great accompaniment w/ some mint and yogurt too.

I liked this!  Because onions are so central to the flavor of the dish, I'd definitely recommend using two or three onions instead of the one suggested.  Also, brown rice is in some ways more convenient than white, since it can begin boiling at the same time as the lentils.  This recipe makes a lot of food, so if you're like me, you'll have tons left over.  A tip:  try adding an egg and some breadcrumbs to the leftovers, forming the mixture into patties, and pan-frying 'em.  Call them croquettes, call them veggie burgers -- whatever you call them, they're delicious.

I have no idea how to pronounce the name of this dish, but I do know it is delicious! Next time wil use 1 1/2 to 2 onions or reduce the olive oil by a tablespoon or two. I barely had enough to serve on top of the yogurt. For those who like specific measurements, I used 2 cups of water with 1 tsp salt with the lentils. when I added the rice, I also added 2 more cups of hot water, 1/2 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. It turned out great. the rice was cooked and the lentils weren't mush. The yogurt and onions on top added just the right touch.

I just realized that I have been making this for quite some time now and have not reviewed it yet.  My Sicilian grandmother cooked lentils quite often, but this dish, especially with the seasonings suggested by so many reviewers is quite different and wonderfully tasty.  I like to add a chicken boullion cube, some cumin and a little curry to the lentils.  Instead of white rice, I like to use a smaller amount of brown rice.  I also add a pinch of cinnamon to the onions.  My personal tip is this: after carmelizing the onions, continue to cook them a little longer until they're a bit crispy.  In my opinion, this gives them a big burst of flavor and adds another texture to the dish.  And definitely double or triple the amount of onions used - one is not enough.  Thank you for submitting this amazing recipe!

Great dish!!  Very simple to make and looks impressive :)  I used red lentils because that's what I happened to have in the house.  I also added cumin (a dash here and there) and 1/2 teaspoon of beef boullion.  The dish ends up being very simple and may fit better as a side dish, but I'll definitely make it again because it was so tastey!  One more suggestion: to spice up the yogurt a bit, I add lots of dill weed, salt, fresh garlic, and even chopped onion if you like it spicey.  This gave a kick to an already great dish!

HUGE hit, my dad loved it (he's arabic, brought home memories for him which is a great compliment).  I added a touch of cinamon and it was "spot on."  But be careful, the cinamon can overpower, you really want to be delicate with it.

I also crisped it which is another arabic/persion thing.  After it's pretty much cooked, you transfer it to another pot in which you've melted a generous amount of butter (or olive oil).  A nonstick pot is best, then simmer at low heat for 15-20 minutes.  You get a crispy bottom layer.  

Serving this type of rice, you take a big serving dish to cover the pot, then turn the whole thing over so the crispy part is on top, looks like a huge rice cake (if you can imagine it)

My family really enjoys this recipe. It is certainly delicious as written but after reading the reviews I have made it with the following changes: Cook the lentils in chicken stock, add 1 t. cumin and a couple pinches of cinnamon when you add the rice, and for us, because we love the onions, triple the amount of onions you cook and over low heat let them brown a good long time... I cook mine down for about 45 min. Serve with plain yogurt... so delicious!!

This dish is widely prepared throughout the Middle East.  Its origins can be found in ancient Egypt, where dried lentils, rice and onions were discovered in the royals tombs. This dish is also attributed to be the "plate of savory" that Esau in the Old Testament traded his inheritance for.  Wonderful dish with a wonderful history!  I beef up the nutrition on this dish by substituting brown rice.  You'll need to add the brown rice about 15 minutes after the lentils come to a boil. Then gently simmer to finish the cooking.

I am very conflicted on this recipe.  I thought about giving it a 2 for some reasons and a 4 for others.  Settled with the 3.  The primary problem was the cooking time.  The lentils were mushy before I even added the rice.  By the time the rice was supposed to be done, the lentils were barely recognizable.  I still had to cook it longer to get the rice past the positively crunchy stage.  So I wound up with what looked like lentil puree with bits of half cooked rice in it.  Very frustrating.  HOWEVER, I loved the flavors and the healthiness of this recipe.  I did add a bit of cumin and cinnamon and I made a Persian cucumber dressing for it as some others suggested.  With those perfectly caramelized onions, the flavor was spectacular.  I think next time I will start the rice first and add the lentils later.  The lentil cooking times I've seen usually suggest less time for those and rice times suggest more.  Perhaps the recipe is backwards?  Or maybe it's because I used red lentils and long grain brown rice?  UPDATE: Tried this again by starting the rice first and adding the lentils 2nd.  Cooked them together longer than suggested by about 20 minutes with added water.  Came out absolutely perfect.  A staple in my house now with the Persian cucumber yogurt salad.  With the change to the cooking times, it's a 5!

This was really excellent -- and cheap, and easy to prepare. But I thought one onion wasn't enough ; I'd add two for that amount of lentils/rice.

I'm Lebanese and this is a STAPLE in my diet.  It is low fat and high in fibre and iron.  It is an amazing vegetarian dish, often used during Lent.  I have never made it using chicken broth, although in non-Lenten times it might taste quite good.  I would skip over the yogurt.  Don't worry about over-cooking the lentils, as long as you don't use too much water (the vitamins will be dumped out when you drain it, otherwise).  Some people run it through a food processor to create a porridge-like consistency, then let it cool in the fridge.  It will thicken if it's a little runny.  Personally, I chop my onions really tiny and spend the time carmelizing them to a deep golden brown colour.  It adds more flavour than just sweating them.  If you're still worried about it being bland, try serving it with pickle spears.  The sour flavour is a great complement to the onion.  It is so nice to see people posting foods like Mom used to make!

Excellent recipe! Highly recommend sifting through the reviews, esp. the newer ones as there's not only some slight flavoring suggestions to add but lots of personal accounts and historical info from native Middle Easterners that really add excitement and richness to the adventure in trying this traditional meal. I added some cumin, curry powder and a few dashes of cinnamon and then used sour cream because we didn't have the plain yogurt on hand. Tasted great like everyone said it would! We also spooned some on wraps and loved every bite. The key is to get some sour cream and onions along with the lentils and rice---in other words---the entire contents in every bite. Awesome!

I havent tried this recipe yet, but mjaddarah is a classic in Lebanon. And now that I'm in canada, I just love it!! It reminds me of home :)
But you have to try the cucumber and yogourt salad with this dish!! just cut a cucumber in 4 lengthwise, and dice it, add yogourt (that you've whipped), salt and dried mint, (some people make this with a little bit of garlic too, to flavor up the yogourt). If the yogourt is too thick add a little bit of water, but you don't want it to be too liquid.

Lately I have been counting calories and a lazy cook. I got the Trader Joes pre-done lentils in refrigerator section and frozen Jasmine rice, I know i know.. SO, I only used one tablespoon olive oil (garlic flavored) in a non stick pan and carmelized those onions oh 15-20 minutes, and added cinnamin as other people mentioned. I portioned out one cup of lentils, one cup frozen rice, with ohhh a few hefty sprinkles of cumin tossed them in the onions added 1/4 cupish chicken broth, simmered a few minutes, salt and peppered and BOOYA those things are OFF THE HOOK GOOD...i wonder how they would be done the long way *shrug* eh oh well, still awesome!! And cut the calories MAJORLY that was 693 calories and will feed me for at least 2 meals (i used TJ organic fat free plain greek yogurt single serving). I topped with chopped fresh cilantro and drizzeled with scirachi hot sauce. Beautiful and tasty!

double the onions (trust me). SLOWLY caramelize the onions in unsalted butter and brandy - about an hour should do it. to the dish itself, add a small amount of cumin for smokiness, and lemon juice for complimenting zest. now, this dish is AMAZING.

Sorry, but this is truly lacking in flavor and is nowhere close to the true recipe and I don't understand the high ratings!  Mujadarrah needs cinnamon, cumin and just a touch of garlic in order to give it flavor.  Salt and pepper are important too, but without the cinnamon, cumin and garlic, it is flavorless.  Further, depends on where the recipe comes from, but it really is better with bulgur wheat instead of rice.  Rice makes it mushy.  The lentils and bulgur give it a more firm texture.  Last, to truly brown those onions, they need to be cooked longer than ten minutes.  I cook mujadarrah about five or six times a year and order just about every other week at one of the hundreds Middle Eastern restaurants around our home - this recipe is nowhere close to the real thing.  It's like using just salt and pepper  to season tacos.

I enjoy near-Eastern dishes and flavors. I  have a mixed review ..  Hot, I find this dish be 3 star without anything exceptional about it, but at room temperature it's great (4+ star) with a good aroma and a complex mix of flavors and hearty "umami" lentil taste.
I served it with my own home made plain yogurt and pita bread. 
As someone else pointed out,  starting the onions cooking at the same time as the lentils, etc is advised. Since I used brown rice instead of more traditional forms I started it in the lentils at the same time as it takes considerably longer to cook than "standard" white rice.
 From the reviews this seems "comfort food" that comes from growing up with it.

I did use 1 Tbs cummin and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon with it. 

To my taste I would only serve this dish at room temp, and BEST make it at least a few hours ahead so the flavors can meld.. then it's beautiful.

Very simple yet good.  If you like beans and rice you will like these.  My husband made them into burritos for himself with sour cream and grated chedder cheese....he loved them.

I just had a bowl with a dolup of sour cream and some cheese on top.

We will cook this again but add more onions and more spices.

I loved this recipe - I am just getting 'into' lentils.  I followed the advice of the first reviewer and added garlic, ginger and spices.  I also cooked the lentils in a vegetable stock. Very tasty, economical and filling.

For low fat version, I dry fried the onions, adding a little vegetable stock to them to make them moist

This recipe DID seem too bland for me, so I added two minced garlic cloves and 1 tsp of minced ginger as well as 1 Tablespoon of Curry powder to the fried onions.  I also put one chicken bouillon cube in the water with the lentils and rice.  Was VERY good like this...and we topped it with sour cream....nummy!

My mothers side of the family is Lebanese and this is almost exactly like we made it.  I love the ideas of the carmelized onions and I will definetly use them.  We use allspice as the spice and also add a about a tablespoon of lemon juice.  The yogurt is a MUST.  What I do is strain it in a larger strainer or colander lined with cheesecloth with a weight on it overnight - or you can use Greek yogurt.  
The straining seperates the liquid so that you have a thicker consistency of yogurt.  Yes, serve with greek olives & pita bread!! Definetly one of my favorite "comfort foods"  Thank you for the new twist on a family favorite!

***********
Made this last week & ate it almost everyday!  I LOVE IT.  I used Cumin & a spice from the Lebanese store - sorry - dont' have a name to it - but I went heavier on the cumin then called for.  The onions were a perfect touch.  I am putting this on my "feel good" food list

I've been an allrecipes.com member for years now and have never felt compelled to review a recipe before this one.....awesome and VERY easy way to cook lentils. I make this recipe all the time now. I take the advice of other reviewers and add a TBSP of cumin and have added my own 1/2 tsp of white pepper.

The flavour is great! A dash of cinnamon in the onions makes a difference. I found cooking the rice and lentils separately ensures the texture of both are perfect.

Fabulous!!  I used way more onions (5 medium) and cooked them in the olive oil over medium heat for about 45 minutes to an hour, along with 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t cumin, and a touch of cinnamon.  I used brown rice and added about 1/2 t cumin and 2 T vegan chicken broth powder with the salt and pepper.  For those wanting to know how much water to use, I used around 4 cups.  I cooked this longer because of the brown rice (about 45 minutes or so).  I topped each serving of lentils and rice with fried onions and sunflower seed sour cream (vegan recipe from vegweb, also wonderful!).  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!  You must try this!!!

I altered the liquids and cooking time in this to use brown rice.  I took a previous reviewers advice and used chicken stock for cooking liquid.  I've tasted a similar dish that I like a little better than this one but this is good.  Healthy, hearty and simple, comfort food.

UPDATE: A dollup of sour cream transformed these humble lentils into ambrosia! The recipe has earned its fifth star...  I thought this was very good, but not outstanding, thus the four stars.  I added 1 teaspoon of cumin to make it more authentic (mujadarah is almost always prepared with cumin).  Having no yogurt or sour cream on hand, the flavor was rather dark.  I can see why the bright taste of yogurt or sour cream is necessary as a counterbalance for the rich flavor.  I think it would make a terrific filling for sandwhiches, and that's how I'll consume the balance of the recipe: rolled up in tortillas with sour cream and maybe tomatoes.  It is inexpensive and high in protein without artery clogging cholesterol.

I used brown rice and 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken stock. Cooked for 40 minutes together and added more stock half way through.

I had only eaten lentils once before and didn' like them.  So, I tried this recipe to use up some lentils I had purchased for the other recipe that I ended up not liking and this was great!  Even my picky 18 month old ate this dish.  Another plus is that it is very simple to make.

I couldn't *believe* how delicous this dish was. I took the advice of prior reviewers and cooked the lentils in canned chicken broth and added 1 tsp homemade garam masala and 3 tsp of cumin. Toward the end of cooking I added a bit of sea salt and pepper. With a dollop of sour cream and the fried onions I can't imagine a better meal! Thanks :)

Although a good attempt at using lentil in a quick recipe, I found this to be too bland and dry. No real flavour unless you work on it like others have I guess. Not worth my trouble though.

I've made this several times, and it's always excellent. Taking other folks' advice, I cook the lentils in 2 cups chicken broth and add another 1.5 cups broth with the rice. Adding 1 tsp cumin, 1.5 tsp garam marsala and 1-2 pinches (no more than that!) of cinnamon with the salt & pepper is a must -- makes the house smell wonderful too!

This recipe needed a lot of help.  Firstly I had to figure out how much water to use TWICE, as "an inch above the lentils" (or rice) changes depending on the size of the pot. The lentils needed longer cooking before adding the rice in order to be tender w/o making the rice mushy.  It needed more seasoning than s & p.  I used cumin at the beginning and added thyme toward the end of cooking.  It would have been improved w/ a little garlic, too.  It made more sense to prepare the onions while the lentils were cooking rather than waste time doing it beforehand, and I agree w/ the reviewers who suggested caramelizing the onions more slowly over lower heat--they cook more evenly that way--and using double the amount.

I prefer eating this w/ a lemony harissa instead of yogurt.

Because I misestimated the amount of water, I ended up w/ some stuck on lentils and rice at the bottom of the pot, but I did manage to season it up so it had enough flavor.

Will look for a different recipe for this dish next time I want it.

Wow! This recipe is very deceiving. It seems so simple that it can't even taste good but it is to die for! I didn't even have yogurt or sour cream and it's still phenomenal!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I also added 3 cloves of garlic and it was absolutely DELICIOUS. No other word for it. I only used maybe 2 or 3 tbs of oil also. so it's extremely healthy and talk about inexpensive to make!!! Wow. This just became a staple.

Fantastic!  I was skepitical of this with the limited number of ingredients I thought it would be bland, not so!  I did add a couple dashes of cinnamon to the onions and a few dashes of cumin to the lentils and rice before cooking.  I think this could be my new, healthier comfort food for the long winter coming.

Delicious Recipe! I used whole wheat couscous iso long grain rice and just mixed it with the lentils and onions at the end. I also recommend soaking the lentils overnight in water and a half tsp baking soda for quicker cooking. Just minor complaints though...this recipe is the bomb! Thank you.

I wasn't that crazy about this recipe. It really cried out for spices - so taking the advice of other cooks, I did add some cumin and a little cinnamon in addition to salt and pepper.  What this recipe needed was some chopped fresh tomatoes and chopped cucumber mixed in just prior to serving.  Next time I try this I will add those.   It is hard for me to find lentil recipes that I enjoy, but I want to use lentils more in cooking for their health benefits.

This would be boring if cooked exactly as described, with with some basic changes to seasoning, it is a fantastic basic recipe!  Here's what I did:

- Veggie stock instead of water
- toasted cumin with onions instead of adding it to the lentils
- caramelized 3 large onions instead of one
- added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, and 3 cloves to the lentil water
- lots of sale and pepper

I am lebanese and I use bulgar instead of rice. I use 5and 1/2 cups of water to cook the lentils for 15 min. Then add 3/4 cup of bulgar and carmalized onions, plus 1 tsp salt and cook on medium until most of water is absorbed. Have done it this way for many years. We all love it with salad and pita bread.

I make this all the time when I want something quick. I use brown rice and for serving size purposes, I cook the rice and the lentils separate so I can mix 1 cup of lentils with 1/2 cup rice. (I always keep some extra rice and cooked lentils in the fridge)  Like others, I add spice to mine (cayenne and curry).  After the onions caramelize in 1 tsp of olive oil, I throw in a couple of handfuls of spinach until they wilt; this way I can eat my greens at the same time.  I never added yogurt until I came across this recipe and I actually like it better!  It cools down the spiciness.  It's a tasty vegetarian dish.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it is quite plain, but nonetheless, it's healthy and palatable.

This is now one of my favorite meals to make! I made some additions based on the other reviews: I use 4 onions, and add 1 tsp of both garam masala and cumin as well as a chicken bullion cube to the lentils. The caramelized onions really are what make this recipe, and it takes way longer than 10 minutes properly caramelize onions. I usually start cooking the onions before everything else and 50 to 60 minutes later when the lentils and rice are done, usually so are the onions. The one time I made this and they onions weren't totally caramelized came out completely bland, so this is definitely the more important part. Also, don't leave out the yogurt. I think a nice, thick greek-style yogurt works best. The tang of the yogurt is a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the onions.

i only gave 4 starts because it lacked some ingredients to make it true mujadarrah.  i am from the u.s., but my husband is jordanian and we live in jordan.  i have had mujadarrah so many times...... but had never made it:).  this recipe was almost spot on except that(as other reviewers mentioned) it is missing crucial spices.  i added a good sprinkling of cinnamon to the onions while they were cooking and i also added a good teaspoon of cumin to the lentils and rice as they cooked.  you can't leave these out!  i only used half of the olive oil and i used 3 onions...... the more extra brown/burnt onions, the better:).  and sour cream is a definite no no.  yogurt is a yes.

I've never heard of this dish before, but I wanted to make it because of the great reviews and the simplicity of it.  Words can't describe how good this is!!!!  I followed it almost exactly, but looked at with other reviewers said.  I added a heaping teaspoon of cumin and a cube of veggie bullion (to make it toally vegetarian).  I caramalized one giant onion for about a hour and a half.  I agree with the other reviewer to use more onions, because they are so good and get used up fast!  (I hate to make more afterwards to go with the leftovers).  AWESOME recipe!

Yum, so delicious! This is an instant classic in our house. Talk about comfort food - I'm ready for a nap. And there are plenty of leftovers too. As others suggested, I used 2 onions instead of 1, added a pinch of salt and sugar to them as they cooked, and caramelized them really well. Probably the only thing I'll do different next time is add 1 more onion.

Very good, but for a more authentic Lebanese taste, add more onions, skip the sour cream, and serve with a salad- leaf lettuce, onion, tomato at a minimum- and a vinegrette w/ olive oil, fresh lemon juice and garlic mashed into a paste with salt in a mortar and pestle.  Eat a bite of the lentils with a bit eof the tangy salad- divine!- courtesy of my xbf's mother in Beirut.

COMFORT FOOD!!!!  I love this dish; its yummy, healthy and economical.  To make it a true Lebanese experience, cook lentils in chicken broth, increase amount of fried onion (mix into lentils and reserve some for garnish), and add a touch of cumin and cinnamin.  This is the perfect companion to Fatoush.  OMG GOOD!

I added 2 tsp of cumin to the onions, as I learned to make this with cumin in it.

As for how much liquid to use, I use 3 cups of chicken stock for a full recipe and 2 cups for half a recipe.  Rice needs less liquid the more you use, proportionately.

LOVE IT.  I use chicken broth instead of water and add Pensey's Balti powder instead of basic curry. Lowfat Greek yogurt (Fage) and extra onion. Cannot be beat for a warm, filling meal. I'm pregnant, and I actually eat this for breakfast. One full recipe lasts all week for one person (my husband doesn't like onion or lentils).

WOWSERS!  Such a simple recipe - I was skeptical before making it but I have been wanting to add lentils to our diet since they are such a good source of protein and fiber plus the reviews were encouraging.  So glad I made it!  The flavors mingle BEAUTIFULLY in this dish -the hearty rice/lentil mix, the tangy sour cream and sweet onions (I carmalized them by cooking them in the oil for 30 minutes like a previous reviewer suggested).  I also had some chicken broth to use up so I used 2 cans in place of the water for the rice/lentils.  I still had to add over a cup of water though.  My 3-year old even scarfed this up!  This is a big winner.  Thanks Melissa!!!

I loved this recipes, as did my husband. I am in Tunisia and was looking for some wonderful Ramadan recipes and this is perfect (and easy). I made some changes from the suggestions and my personal preference. I would soak the lentils for 1-2 hours before cooking. They will be much more tender. I also used about 3 large white onions and cut back on the olive oil. I added cinnamon as the others suggested. I am going to try adding lamb to this. I think it will be amazing. Shukran for this recipe!

Yum! I love lentils, and this is a great, easy recipe.  I used some cinnamon and cumin, and cooked the lentils with a chicken boullion cube like suggested, but would fry 3 onions instead of 1--one wasn't nearly enough for the whole dish.  Will make it again!!

This was so good! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used 3 medium onions, and it took me the entire time of cooking the lentils/rice for the onions to really brown, but it was worth it. I used basmati rice, and added 1 tbsp cumin and a pinch of cinnamon. Topped with some plain yogurt! Very simple, but really tasty. I recommend this!

This was pretty good, but I think some tweaking would make it better. Definitely needs at least a Tbsp of cumin, a pinch of cinnamon and lots more onion. I used two really big ones, and next time I think I'll use four, some for mixing in with the lentils and rice, and some for topping. I used about 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth for the liquid, but I could have used a little more and cooked the lentils a bit longer.  I used the long grain white rice, but next time will try Basmati and see where that takes it. Definitely plain Greek yogurt for the topping. All in all, a nutritious and tasty dish.

I am hosting a Middle Eastern dinner in October and this will definately be on the menu. Loved the taste and texture, and the sweetness of the onions.  I did add a bit of cinnamon to the lentils as they cooked and also cooked them in vegetable broth which added a bit more depth to the taste. I garnished it with a bit of cilantro and a dollip of yogurt.  Served it with a cucumber salad and humus with pita.  An excellent, authentic meal and delightfully vegetarian!

This recipe is so much better than the ingredients might lead you to think it might be.  Deffinitely more than the sum of its parts.   I don't change a thing ... and that's saying something!

I give this recipe 4 stars as is, and 5 with some seasonings and additions. I love to make this as the main dish on a weeknight. I don't use quite as much olive oil, and end up needing a lot more water than the recipe calls for. I add cayenne, cumin, curry, and garlic and onion powders. We like ours topped with sour cream. mmmm.... thanks for a great base recipe that we have adapted.

My boyfriend and I are so pleased with how this turned out! I read the reviews first, then altered the recipe a bit to go in the crock pot. I put 1 1/2 cups lentils, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 2 teaspoons cumin (would have used more but I ran out), 3 teaspoons coriander, 4 chicken bouillon cubes, and all in all 6 1/2 cups of water in my crock pot. Cooked it on high for 3 1/2 hours, then stirred in 1 1/2 cups long grain rice. Then I let it cook on high for another hour. The rice really did suck up all that water, too! I had to keep adding more and kept track. I turned the crock pot to warm while I fried the onions, using about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 good sized onions. We ate it with fat free sour cream. All in all, a very tasty meal that I will make many more times. I think it would be pretty bland without the spices though. My crock pot method made a large amount too, enough for about 8 servings, and since it's just the two of us I plan to use the lentils and rice as taco filling a couple nights to change things up.

this is a family favorite!  being an arab-american i make this at least once a week.  my kids love it!!  you can also replace the rice with bulgur wheat too. i use 1 and 1/2c parboiled rice. 1 c of lentils.  when the lentils are slightly cooked add rice.  bring to a boil then lower heat and cover.  for each cup of lentils add 1 c of water and for each cup of rice add 2c of water.(add a 1/2c more water when using parboiled) add extra onions!!  i start to fry mine after i add the rice.  so the olive oil will be nice and hot when added to rice.

The extraordinary flavor that comes out of these humble ingredients is amazing! And I think the whole meal is probably less than $1 to make.
Alterations - The onions need longer than the 10 minutes to caramelize. I used two onions and started them and let them keep cooking on medium low the whole time the lentils and rice were cooking to get really rich brown. I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the onions and a pinch of cumin to the lentils and rice according to some of the reviews. I replaced half the water with bone broth for flavor and nutrients.
This was the perfect simple meal to eat the week of Christmas, before all the rich sweets start coming! Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe!  Haven't been into lentils until now, but this is just over the top.  Used the reviewers' advice re: cumin and cinnamon with great results.  Also used four onions... this dish just doesn't deserve less.  Anyone, however, who can caramelize (not brown) onions in ten minutes is far out of my league.  Figure on 30 minutes, or more, to do it well.

I make this on the regular. Super easy, super good and super good for you. I always add a bullion cube and a tbsp of cumin to the lentils, and I add a little cinnamon to the onions. White onions are better than yellow if you can find them.

This is such an interesting selection of flavors!  It's one of those dishes where I had a hard time getting into it the first time, because it was so far from anything I was accustomed to, but then I found myself craving it a few weeks later.  Easy, cheap, and delicious!

Oh, and I make mine in a rice cooker.  I cook the lentils as suggested for ~15 minutes, then dump them (water included) and the rice into my rice cooker.  I then use the lentil pan for the onions, and can cut down on the dishes a little.

I always cook mujaddarah and this is a good basic recipe for it. a few changes would make it even tastier. 1- use chicken or vegetable stock instead of water, it adds more flavor. 2- add a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cumin. eat it with plain yougurt and a fresh cucumber and tomato salad... yum yum :)

This is so good!  The only issue I had was browning the onions; they took a lot longer to caramelize than 10 minutes.  More like 30.  We used the leftovers as the middle for a breakfast tacos and couldn't tell it wasn't sausage.

To be honest, I was pretty shocked when my husband actually liked this. Usually, he hears lentils and goes running. But we both really liked this one. I did add spices, because we tend to like things with lots of flavor. Sometimes I've used cumin or curry and other times used a garam masala mix. I also usually do some extra onion. This makes a whole lot, so it's great for lunches throughout the week too. Thanks for sharing!

This is great!  Used about 1/2 of a large onion per person.  I used vegetable broth for the rice/lentils with some cumin.  Added the Cucumber Slices with Dill recipe on the site as a compliment - perfect combo.  Check out the "how to" for the caramelized onion prep. Added a little cinnamon here. Pretty easy to make.  Took a little longer for me since I used brown rice - about 50 mins.

Suggested variation: cook the onions with a tablespoon of plain (sugarless) peanut butter. Mmm!

So amazingly good!  So simple and easy to make! Making this again for the second night in a row!  This time with even more onions.  I used a pinch of cinnamon and cumin as others suggested.  This is going to be a regular dish in our home now!

I found out about this recipe because it came to my email address. I have been meaning to try it for a while now and I finally got around to cooking it. All I can say is WOW! This is definitely a dish I will make often. My daughter is a very picky eater and she loves it. As I was cooking she said, "It smells so good!" :-)

Anyway, I did not have Yogurt but I plan to have it the next time I cook this dish so I can see what it taste like. It is really good without it so I cannot complain. I read other reviews and I added Cumin and a pinch of Cinnamon. The flavor is Awesome!

Thanks so much for posting this great vegetarian recipe.

**UPDATE** I made this dish again but this time I tried it with sour cream and it was AWESOME. I used 2 cups of vegetable broth and a cup and a half of water. I did not have the long grain rice so I used my Riceland medium grade brown rice and it was sooooooo good. In order for the rice to have a fair chance at cooking, I added it after the Lentils started boiling. I am going to continue making it this way. Thanks again for this wonderful veggie recipe. :-)

I only gave this three stars because it was very bland. I followed other recipes and reviews suggestions and add cinnamon and cumin. Both those combined with the salt and pepper gave it the extra needed kick. With the additions I would rate it 5 stars.

I love this dish! Be sure to add the extra seasonings of cumin and cinnamon. As others have stated the onions in this dish are the stars! Double or triple what is called for and cook them low and slow for a deep color and sweet flavor. They will not be done properly in 10 minutes. 30 to 60 minutes will do it. Look for authentic Labna yogurt and the very freshest pita possible. Try your local middle eastern market, the bread is usually delivered daily and they will have the labna. it will cost less there too.

Delicious and easy!  I will use more onions next time. Also, more water was required. I used brown rice, which takes longer to cook, so my lentils were overcooked and still, it came out very tasty.  I'll make it again with some adjustments, but this is a keeper.

Wonderful  tasty, economical dish! Great for any time of the year. However, the fat content puzzles me. I am surprised at 22 grams per serving for lentils rice and a moderate amount of oil to fry the onions in. Anybody else have a comment on this aspect, I 'd appreciate hearing from you. Thanks for the input.

I loved this! I did add cumin and vegetable bouillon to the lentil and rice water and a pinch of cinnamon on the fried onions. Used 2 large onions, I used 1 on top and 1 mixed in. Thank you for sharing this recipe and to other reviewers whose tips and suggestions just made it the best.

I too was amazed at how good this was with so few ingredients. The onion really does make this dish. I fried up 4, and l might as well have done up the whole bag. I increased the amount of lental and rice so that I could finish a partial bag. I used brown rice, started cooking the rice 1st then added the lentals in the last 30 min. I also added chopped garlic to the onion. The onion was devoured right away, so we used hot salsa for the remainder, and that was mighty fine also. Next time, and there will be one, I will add curry powder and red pepper flakes. Great tasting, cheap, easy to make. Thanks for posting.

Use some ras al hanout as seasoning and chicken broth, and this rises above good to great.

I grew up on this healthy dish. My mom always prepared  it  on meatless  Fridays during Lent and served it with salad over the mujadarrah. So, that's how I've passed it down to my husband and kids. The cold salad with olive oil and lemon (or vinegar) is wonderful with the lentils.

Thanks for sharing the recipe! I went with other posters and added some spices: cumin, garam masala, chicken bullion cubes, cinnamon, and lemon juice (not sure if it's even mujadura anymore, ha).  Next time I will definitely use several onions instead of one.  I cooked the basmati rice separately, served topped with greek yogurt and cilantro, and had sliced cucumbers in sushi vinegar on the side.  I will definitely be making this healthy, satisfying meal again.

Disclaimer - I modified the recipe quite a bit.  I didn't mean to, but I realized I didn't have lentils after I started cooking.  So I added chickpeas (a legume in place of the lentils) and green peas (for color and nutrients) to the rice.  I also added garam masala to the rice as others have suggested.  I used plain greek yogurt.   YUM!  The fried onions and yogurt are what make this dish.  What a great, basic, easily modifiable recipe.  I'm sure I'll try it as written some day, but as it is, I will always want my rice with yogurt and fried onions now.

I make this using a couple of TBS of cumin powder and chicken broth instead of water with the lentils and chicken broth with the rice and a little garlic powder, onion powder and about 1/2 tsp curry powder. I use 4 large onions... I think next time I will use 6 onions.  The onions really make this dish. We had it with sour cream and I've made it using brown rice and white rice. Both have been very good. Thank you for this recipe :)

So simple and cheap and this is the kind of meals we are looking for right now. This made a ton of food that we will eat off for days. I strayed a little by adding 1 can of vegetable broth and 2 pounds of sausage. I didn't have any yogurt or sour cream but plan on using the yogurt next time I made it. This will definitely become a regular meal when we need to save some cash. Thanks for sharing it.

This is wonderful!  It's become a regular dish in our household.  My edits: use about 5 onions, because the caramelized onions really are the star of this dish.  Don't be afraid to let them get reallllly dark brown.  When I add the rice, I mix in 2 tsp cumin, 3 cloves garlic, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  This is nice with sour cream on the side but it's better with Greek yogurt.  The dish has a completely different flavor with and without the Greek yogurt!  For extra flavor, cook the lentils and rice in reduced sodium chicken stock instead of water.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Following other reviewers' suggestions, I used chicken broth instead of water and added cumin and a pinch of cinnamon.  I used 4 cups of liquid, but should have used a little more because the beans were still a bit tough.  I didn't have any plain yogurt, so we topped it with sour cream.  It was very good and filling.  I'll definitely make this again.

From what I understand, this is the "mac-n-cheese" of the middle east. This was a good simple recipe. I followed the advice of previous reviewer "M.A.H." and used brown rice, cooked it right together with the lentils (I used French green) with 3 1/2 - 4 cups of liquid per recipe. I was most delighted to find it cooked perfectly in my RICE COOKER!!! The onion should be at least doubled...because when browned as dark as possible (20-30 min), is truly the star of the dish. And I did find that chicken broth or base is good, as are several dashes of pepper, and a couple dashes of cumin. Five stars for ease, nutrition, and hearty sustenance :) Oh yes~ yogurt, NOT sour cream!!!

Had to give this 4 stars because I had to add 1 t. cayenne, 1 t. garam marsala, and 1 T. cumin.  Then it became a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for a great base and another keeper.

Yum! Yum! Yum! And I LOVE that it is so easy to make and has only a few ingredients. Since going vegetarian in January, was hard to find simple, delish dishes. I even can eat cold. Ate all of the leftovers. This is the best. Gonna go make it again now.

It makes a great side provided that you make a few alterations. Added 3 onions, garlic, cumin. I cooked the lentils on the stove using half vegatable stock and half water. Onions and garlic were also browned on the stove. To save time, I use my rice cooker to cook the rice - instead of water, I used stock, added the lentils , onions and garlic and ended up with a fantastic side dish!

Loved this recipe!  Made it with cumin and cinnamon - and the whole house smelled WONDERFUL!  
My 2 yr old daughter ate it for lunch and kept saying, "This is good, Mama!"
Then for dinner we made it into veggie burritos - w/salsa and sour cream!
GREAT!

I made this recipe tonight, adding the cumin and a sprinkling of cinnamon and added some beef bouillon.  I also added some garlic.  I think the recipe is basiclaly good, but the amount of water should be more specific and also the amount of salt and pepper.  My husband liked it, so I will make it again but will add about 1 tsp of beef bouillon and about 1 tsp of salt.  I could have done without the cinnamon, but the cumin was good.

SOOOO Good! The biggest change I made was TRIPLING IT! And I added cumin and bullion cubes. Delicious and I make it all the time. The yogurt is what really brings out the flavor, so don't be afraid to try it.

This was delicious.  I used sweet Vidalia onions, and the taste was perfect.  I agree with other reviewers though; next time, I'm adding more onions! I also cooked the lentils with a chicken bouillion cube. Thanks for an awesome recipe.  This will definitely go into rotation, especially since I'm a big fan of lentils.

It was good but I love onions to death so anything with onions is fine with me.  It was a bit bland though so for next time I will increase the onions, cumin  and maybe add garlic and tomatoes for some coolness and flavor.

Very good, but I did cook the lentils in chicken broth rather than water, and had to add much more water during cooking than the recipe calls for. I also added cumin, cinnamon (just a dash), garam masala, kosher salt, pepper, and red chili paste to the rice and lentils to give them some flavor. Also used 3 yellow onions. Very, very good, even without the yogurt (or sour cream, which I'd planned on using).

I loved this dish, and my husband, who is not a big fan of lentils, thoroughly enjoyed it. I followed others' suggestions, using chicken broth to cook the lentils and rice, and added a bit more salt. In addition, I added 4 sliced garlic cloves to the cooking lentils and rice, along with a teaspoon of cumin. Very tasty!

Wholesome and hearty, but a little bland for my taste.  I added some bouillon to the cooking water, and added some cumin and turmeric to the onions while they fried.  Pepped it up a little, but I probably wouldn't make this too frequently.

Very tasty. Made this for a week of work lunches since I already had all the ingredients. Very cheap and easy to make meal - but it doesn't looks so appetizing after a few days...just a warning. If you are planning on using it for leftovers, make sure to chop the onions a bit because they get very stringy after sitting in the fridge for a night.

Different types of rice and lentils take different amounts of water and cooking time. You have to make adjustments according to what you're using, as well as spicing it up to taste. 
This is how I make this with brown rice and green lentils: Heat 1/3 cup olive oil in soup pot (appr.5 quart) add 1 teasp cumin seeds, 4 pods cardomon seeds, cracked black pepper, teasp tumeric and 3 or 4 sliced onions-1/4 thick. Cook on medium heat uncovered, stirring a couple times for about 15-20 minutes. I stir in 3/4 brown rice, and minced garlic, and toast for about a minute and then add about 4 1/2 cups boiling water and 1 cup lentils and simmer covered on low for about 40 minutes, checking after 30 minutes. Add salt after cooking.
I love this recipe enough to make this simple. If you change rice or lentil types the water and time will need to be adjusted. I still check after 30 minutes to be sure there is just enough water and keep covered after turning off the heat. I add frozen peas when almost done.

Really tasty, healthy dish.  I added a spoon-fil of "Better Than Bullion" while the lentils cooked.  I grated fresh ginger on top of the rice, lentil mix before serving, topped it with sour cream, yum.

I added cumin, parsley, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper, and a bit of cinnamon and tumeric to the mix of onions/brown rice and lentils. (all the good anti-cancer spices!) It was delicious...my husband liked his with yogurt and we ate ours with the sour cream in a burrito wrap. Yummy and totally something for Lent!

Very good.  I cooked my rice and lentils separately (I prefer to use my rice cooker).  I took the suggestions of others and added bouillon cubes and cumin to the lentils while cooking.  I also used two onions and added cinnamon (you will need far more than 10 minutes to properly caramelize them). That truly makes the flavor. I only used to tablespoons of oil - I can't imagine six are really needed. Served with plain Greek yogurt.

Tried this yesterday for the first time and so glad I did!  Used other reviewers suggestions and used chicken broth (organic, low sodium) to cook the lentils and rice.  Also added about 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to lentils as they cooked.  Used 3 large white onions and added a sprinkle of cinnamon while cooking those (for 45 mins).  There was still a bit of liquid in lentils and rice (brown basmati, which took longer to cook than the green lentils) when they were done to my desired consistency, so I added all to skillet with caramelized onions to finalize and cook off excess liquid.  Reserved some onion for topping and used plain Greek yogurt as well.  Definitely NOT bland with the added spices and will definitely cook again!  Just had leftovers for lunch, and it was even better!  Used a dollop of sour cream today instead of yogurt and liked that more, but delicious either way and need one or the other to bring it all together!

Read the helpful reviews....I learned a lot.  I used 1 cup lentils with 2 cups water.  Then added 3/4 cup rice with 1 1/2 cups water.  Was perfect for us.  I tried adding cumin and we didn't like it.  We are used to it very simple.  I did add 1 1/2 teaspoons salt which seemed like a good amount.

Totally LOVE this dish! The first time I made it I followed the exact recipe and used only one onion. If you truly carmelize the onion it basically shrinks to almost nothing. The second time I didn't have any rice, so I subbed red quinoa with delicious results. I cooked the lentils and quinoa separate and combined once cooked. I also cooked the lentils in chicken stock and added some cumin and garam masala. I carmelized 2 med/large onions and next time will use 3! I strained plain yogurt (put a paper towel in a fine mesh colander set over a bowl) to make it thick like greek yogurt to add on top. Served it with Mediterranean Chickpea Salad from this site. So good!

This is a staple in our house, I make it at least once a week having grown up with it. We use allspice which gives it a really nice flavor.

This was really lovely! I used brown rice (the only white I had on hand was arborio and that wouldn't do) and since I made this change I cooked it in the pot with the lentils at the same time. Both were perfectly done at the same time. I added about half a veggie boullion cube to the cooking water, as mentioned in some reviews. I didn't realize I was low on dried lentils, so I used only 2/3 cup of lentils and 1 + 1/3 cup of rice, to make up the difference. I agree with other reviews that the onions are the best part, so using more couldn't hurt. ;) I grew up with lots of traditional Ukrainian food and anyone from similar backgrounds knows the unstoppable flavour team of fried onion + sour cream, but I also found this delicious without any yogurt/sour cream. Leftovers were very versatile and I will definitely make this from now on! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Vegetarian guy here. I love this recipe because it is super delicious and healthy for vegetarians.

I like adding cumin (as suggested here) plus half a cube of veggie stock and salt & pepper to the lentils before adding rice. Then I like to add a rounded teaspoon of butter to stir into the whole pot after everything is done cooking. Finally, one large onion is not enough! I suggest two or even three.

It's okay. The last lentil and rice recipe I made were more flavorful.  It had garlic, cumin, cinnamon, etc. I chose to try this recipe because it uses white rice and the directions are different. The submitter should've listed how much water to use. I used 1 cup lentils (2 cup water) and 1 cup rice (1 1/2 cup water).

Three onions are a must!  The reviews really helped me...added cumin and use yoghurt.  Will make it again as it is so easy and simple.  I was surprised that the receipe looked so bland but it is really tasty!  It reminds me of the Israeli restaurant in Toronto.

This recipe was tasty! I always cook jasmine rice and my husband loves lentils (ehich i made for the first time with this recipe)...I was pleasantly surprised to try out cinnamon in a non-desert type dish....
This recipe was easy! I servd it with sour cream since I didn't have yogurt; also served red onion with vinegar and hot pepper on the side....

This is a delicious and nutritious dish.  My reason for giving it four stars instead of five is that I think it needs a lot more onion and that the onion should be cooked longer.  I prefer about four medium onions, cooked until they're caramelized.  I sometimes add other spices, like chicken bouillon, cumin, and cinnamon, but those aren't really necessary.  The yogurt is necessary, though!  Don't skip it just because the recipe says it's optional.

I love this...it's so simple and easy!  Who would have thought that such simple ingredients would make such a fab dish.
I served mine wiht Greek yogurt the first time, because that's all we had.  I just can't tell you how nice it was.
I did check out the star rating before deciding to cook this dish, and only read the reviews after so did no amendments.
If I could give this ten stars I would.  Delish!

This was awesome.  I used the suggestion of the chicken bouillion cube and cumin.  Great, fast, and easy.  You can also add cooked pasta and a garlicy vinegar tomato sauce for the Egyptian dish koshary.

I tried this dish in a restaurant once and loved it, so I wanted to try making it on my own.  Getting those onions nice and caramelized for this dish is so, so important.  Also, I did read that this dish traditionally has cumin and cinnamon in it (as other reviewers have noted) so I added 1 tbsp. of cumin and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I think that really helped this dish because it would have been too bland for me otherwise.  I definitely recommend eating this with yogurt, that tang makes it oh so, so good.  *Note*:  if you want to eat this with brown rice, I'd recommend make your brown rice separate from the lentils and then mix it all up in your plate.  I'm so happy I finally found a recipe for Mujadarrah.  Thanks for sharing!

It's amazing how good something so simple is!  I use yogurt (although my husband prefers it without yogurt or sour cream) and extra onions.  The onions are the best part.

First attempt at cooking lentils. I liked it, but the way the rice cooked with the lentils was kinda funky for me.. I think I may have miscooked them lol Was a good hearty meal regardless. Husband approves.

This will be my first review I have made on this website ever. Its that good. ^.^ My husband and I absolutely loved this dish! I made Eye Of Round Roast, steamed lemon green beans, and this rice. It was an instant fave. I honestly added nothing additional to it. After we had tasted it, we realized it was perfect the way it was (my hubby LOVED the onions in it). I didn't have the yogurt so we used the sour cream, it was wonderful! I will be passing this recipe along!

As other reviewers have said, as written it's a little bland.  I add a little cumin and a pinch of cinnamon, and it's perfect.

Oh my gawd was this yummy!!!!! Admittedly I do not have a standard to compare this to so I cannot speak to authenticity etc, but we just loved it! We took the suggestions for adding Cinnamon and Cumin and used non-fat yogurt. Be careful not to eat it too fast though, the rice and lentils seem to expand in the belly for a very full feeling :-) This will absolutely be made again and again in our house!

Very good, but I agree that it could use just a touch more seasoning - next time will add a pinch of allspice.  Super ridiculously easy, though.

Quite tasty and very simple to make! Required a bit more water than it called for though, so you have to watch and make sure you've got enough in there at all times.  I mixed all the onions in with the lentils instead of leaving some for the top, and just topped with yogurt.  Yummy!

This is OH MY GOODNESS wonderful!  I made a couple of changes--used 2 onions (do it, you won't be sorry) and I added 1 TBSP cumin and 1 1/2 tsp garam masala to the lentils when they were cooking--which was a recommendation of another reviewer.   also used brown instead of white rice.  I served this with wheat pita bread triangles and cucumber salad (recipe from this site).  My husband RAVED all night about the whole dinner!

What a great dish! I've already made it twice this week. Basmati rice works perfectly. I tried it once with sour cream and once with greek yogurt and I prefer the yogurt by far (I used Fage greek). I'm so glad I found this recipe!

This was wonderful and very healthy meal.I did put a pinch of cinnamon in the onion,like some people suggested and it tasted great.Also used 2 onions instead of 1(because my daughter loves it).In the reviews sombody mentioned that the water for the rice is not specified.I always put 3 cups of water for 1 cup of rice and it never fails.My guess is that I am gonna be making this very often.

My husband is Lebanese and we love this dish. I add yogurt on top of any stew now. My taste buds love the tangyness. Agree that cumin or cinnamon should be added (we prefer cumin). We used brown short grained rice until I discovered quinoa which takes less time than rice and more nutricious, so add it at the end of cooking the stew, after soaking in boiling water - same method as cooking bulgur.

Having never attempted a middle eastern dish, I thought this sounded good, but chose to use chicken broth, and add garlic, cumin and cinnamon after reading reviews. The result was quite delicious! I had NO idea how much water was supposed to be used and kept adding, because my lentils were too firm. By the time it was finished it was pretty wet. I am guessing it should have been a bit more dry and fluffy? I gave 4 stars because there should be some guidelines for the liquid amount in my opinion.

Having grown up Lebonese/Catholic, this was more often than not our meatless Friday meal.  Still is today, during Lent.    Someone here suggested adding cinnamon, which made me chuckle.  Apparently there must be some village in Lebanon that uses cinnamon in almost everything.  I'm guessing my ancestors grew up in a different village.  We do NOT add the cinnamon (to me, that's all you taste).  Maybe try a little Allspice instead.   Oh, and I definitely agree with YOGURT, not sour cream. Now all that's missing is some fresh homemade pita bread and a cucumber salad.  Yum!!!

My Syrian grandmother made this all the time.  We pronounced it (jeddarah.  She usually used salt and pepper with either all spice or cumin, depending on what she had on hand.  I make this too and like to use long grain basmati rice or parboiled if in a hurry.  Also, I like to brown vermicelli in olive oil in a skillet first to add to the rice.  Serve with plain yogurt (leban)...yum!!! :)

Delicious!! Being that over the years I've made similar recipes I took the liberty of adding a teaspoon of cumin and1/8th teaspoon of cinnamon with spectacular results, also made 3 X the amount of onions.... Though the yogurt (or sour cream) is a good addition there really isn't the need for it.

Nice simple dish and tasty. Like others, I added some things straying from the traditional.  Chopped mushrooms, celery, fresh parsley, fresh spinach, little lemon juice, turmeric, cumin, curry powder, brown rice.  Cooked up the onions separate. Sauteed all the other stuff, besides the rice and lentil, before adding them all together.  Nice with the tangy yogurt/ sour cream.

I wanted to use brown rice, but knew it would take longer than white rice so I put it in the pot right away with the lentils. I kept needing to add water so it wouldn't burn before the rice was done cooking. Maybe next time I might start the rice first then add the lentils? I'm not really sure how much water is needed... trial and error so far. Based on some other reviews, I added cumin and garam masala. The onions were fantastic. Honestly, I made more onions  more several times tonight before dinner because they were so good!

Love this, but I think you must add cumin. And I love garlic and add a bit while cooking the onion. Yogurt is preferable to sour cream.

I double the onions, and instead of the yogurt/sour cream option, I prefer to add butter to each serving individually. Make sure you really brown the onions well, to get all their character and flavor! This is great comfort food for cold weather.

Although I saved this recipe a long time ago, I finally made it last night.  I put cumin in the lentils, and cinnamon in the onions. I topped it with plain yogurt.  It was delicious!  A great winter warmer upper! :)  Will make this again and again!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!! I made as written, but while the lentils were cooking I seasoned them with a little turmeric & crushed red chilies. I also added a small amount of soya sauce when I added the rice. Served with plain yoghurt. It was delicous and smelt good while simmering. I had the leftovers today warmed up in a soft tortilla wrap.

I've made this several times now and thought I had already reviewed. Very bland recipe as is, but with the addition of some spices made it a 5 star recipe. I added gram marsala and doubled the onions. I also use brown rice. Inexpensive, quick and good for a weeknight meal (the leftovers are even better for lunch the next day)

Delicious! Following other reviewers, I put a chicken bullion cube in with the lentils & rice and added a teaspoon of cumin and a bit of cinnamon.  I will use more of both spices next time.  Also, the onions are the best part, so the more you use, the better!  I used two, and I'll use three next time.

I've had something similar at a restaurant except it was served with bulgar rather than rice and it was great.  I thought this would be too, but after cooking, it was a giant pile of mush!  Maybe it would help if there were measurements for the liquid.  I also put a splash of cinnamon in it as many suggested but even that was over powering...a little bit goes a long way!

Great recipe!  I used my rice cooker to begin the lentils and then added in the rice.  Cooked up perfectly and deliciously with the yogurt and caramelized onions for toppings.  I had a group of picky eater kids over and they licked clean their plates.  It's a fun dish to play with the toppings.  A Mujadarrah bar!

I got a box of green lentils, and didn't know what to do with it- so I tried this recipe.  I followed it to the T, and it came out great!  As with other reviewers, I recommend frying up at least 3 onions- they are sooo good!

Awesome! Took other suggestions regarding using 3 onions vs. 1.  Used organic vegetable stock instead of water.  Used salt and pepper only.  Very flavorful without cumin, cinnamon and other spices suggested.  My suggestion is to increase onions, use vegetable (chicken or beef) stock, and go from there. You can gzuszh it from there your second time around.  Don't let the flavor of the letils, rice and onions get lost in spice!!!

What a surprise this one was.  Had great flavour and texture.  Took note of other reviews and added chicken stock, cumin, dash of cinnamon, garlic and used 3 onions.  Use yoghurt rather than sour cream as it combines more easily. A definite 'do again' Thanks for sharing it

This was a good starting point to grow from.  I used other reviewers suggestions and increased the spices.  I also used more onions.  I oooked my lentils seperate.  All in all a good idea for a comfort food for me.

This is now my #1 comfort food - sorry fried mac & cheese.  Cooked lentils and brown rice together in 3+ cups water and 1 cup V-8 with pinch cumin and coriander and squeeze lemon jc.  Added 1 tsp brown sugar and lots of pepper to onions and they took 1 hour to get nice and dark.  The lentil mix took 50 min. so start onions first next time.  Yummy with yogurt so have extra. I'm so looking forward to leftovers for dinner tomorrow - maybe lunch too.  Thank you for this recipe!

Tasted very good, but smelled up the entire house for 2 days! Served with sour cream. Liked it enough, but the smell made me unlikely want to make it too often. Inexpensive meal.

This made a great meal. I enjoyed cooking it partly for the fewer ingredients involved and the taste was just right. (I did add about a 1/4 teaspoon of cumin toward the end of the cooking time.)  Plus my rice was already cooked so I just put the hot lentils on top the rice.   Thanks for the recipe.

I am so thrilled to have found this recipe! I used to get mujadarrah from a great little Indian deli/market, Kalustyan's, when I was working in NYC, and it was my absolute favorite. I didn't think I'd ever taste it again, but this is IT. I made two changes to make it like Kalustyans': I used bulgur instead of rice, which gives the dish a creamy texture and binds everything together; and I caramelized the onions on low for a good hour. I simmered the lentil/bulgur mixture until all water was absorbed, about 45 min., and I let it sit for 15 min. after adding the onions to let the flavors blend. I used half coconut oil and half olive oil, and I poured most of it into the lentils to add richness and texture. Absolutely perfect!

I liked this, but will do as suggested and add more cumin (I used about 1/3 of what others did). The husband, on the other hand, didn't find it to be remarkable. Next time, I'll cook some chicken with the onions to add on top for him.

We did not realize how much this would make so I used it as a side dish and I have lots leftover.  It was good but I think next time I will add onion powder to lentils and rice for more flavor.

The seasoning of the lentils is key for this recipe - make sure you add enough salt and pepper. Also, I followed other reviewers' suggestions to cook the rice and lentils separately, so I didn't end up with mushy lentils and undercooked rice.  Unfortunately, I then UNDERcooked the lentils! Oh well, better next time.  Overall, a pretty quick and tasty meal. :)

I found this served WAY more than 4. Also, I only needed 2 tablespoons of oil to cook the onion to carmelization; and fat free sour cream was the perfect topper. It was the perfect side dish to seared chicken breasts simmered in a can of diced tomatoes sprinkled with garlic salt, tumeric, and cumin.

Excellent -- just like at Mediterranean restaurants.  Do make sure you add enough salt, because otherwise it's tasteless; I salted the cooking water and still had to add a good bit more salt to the finished product to give it flavor.  I also diced the onion instead of serving it in rings, which helped flavor the finished product and also made it more like what I'm used to in restaurants.

This was missing something. The more onions you add the better.  I liked it a lot, but I need to experiment with the right spices to add.

Very simple yet tasty.  As others suggested I added some curry to the lentils.  I'd cut this one in half next time as I had too many leftovers for one person.

I am allergic to garlic, so very grateful for a lentil recipe without it. This is easy, tasty, no fancy ingredients and healthy.  IMO, you don't need to add a lot of extra stuff, but the cumin is a nice addition and be sure to cook the onions long enough.  Thank you for posting this!  More garlic-free recipes, please!

I've made this many times, and it is one of our family's favorites.  Comfort food at its best!  The recipe as written is terrific, but now I make these changes to suit our tastes:  Use 3 sweet onions -- they are so delicious with the other ingredients; add a pinch of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of sugar when frying the onions.  The sugar helps to caramelize them nicely.  Add 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/4 tsp of cayenne to the lentils for a nice zip.  And finally, if you want to use brown rice, just cook the rice from the beginning with the lentils with about 3 1/2 cups of water (chicken broth is even better).  Give this recipe a try -- You'll love it too!

This is really good. I like that the recipe makes a lot of food and that it was relatively easy and required few ingredients. I would agree that the longer you caramelize the onions, the tastier the whole dish will be. Next time, I'll probably use two onions because to me, the onion makes the dish. I put in a dash of cumin while the rice was cooking, but next time I'll add more plus some cinnamon too.

The recipe as written is good (4 stars). But adding the cumin and vegetable bullion with the rice and cinnamon to the onions takes it to great (5 stars). Make sure you really brown the onions well--its worth it to spend the 45 mins on the onions as they make the dish. Yogurt is also way better than sour cream.

Easy, healthy filling! I used basmati rice and it gave it an extra nice touch. Will be making again :)

I loved this recipe! It was more than I expected from it. I took the advice of one reviewer and added a chicken bouillon cube and a few dashes of cumin. I think what made it for me, though,  was the sour cream and onions in it. Frankly,  you need more than 1 large onion for all the oil it calls for. So, I recommend cutting out a tblsp or two of oil, or use more onion (I'm opting for the latter). Other than that,  it's a great,  easy recipe I'll use over and over again in the future.

Was looking for something reasonably healthy for dinner tonight and I'm glad I found this! I did as others have suggested and added cinnamon to the onions about midway through the 35-40 minutes I cooked them. I also added cumin to the lentils and (brown) rice and this dish turned out to be wonderful.

Wow...I couldn't stop eating this with the crispy onions, which I fried in coconut oil.  I added garam masala and vegetable bouillon with the lentils while they cooked. The only other change was that I cooked the rice separately so that I could spoon the lentils over it. The only complaint I have is that I ate too much and now I'm stuffed!

This was surprisingly tasty! Would make a good vegetarian meal or as a side for "carnivores". I followed other reviews and cooked mine in stock. Definitely make extra onions they're the best part!!  Its also worth mentioning that the sour cream or yogurt is necessary for full enjoyment :) Next time I might add some curry powder for extra flavor but good as is too.

This was delicious.  I used to live in Egypt and I know what the onions are supposed to be like, as this is how they serve onions with Koushari.  I cooked mine carefully for an hour, and I still didn't get it right.  Close, but not quite.  I will keep trying!  For my taste, I added cumin and garlic, and a little garam masala to the rice/lentils.  I loved this!

I am definitely adding this one to my recipe box. I like  a lot of onions, so I sliced four medium size ones, as they do cook down a lot. Do take your time caramelizing them. Also, I added cumin and vegetable broth to lentil-rice mix. So flavorful!

This was a really tasty dish! I followed some of the suggestions from the others and used 5 med sized onions and added a 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. I also changed the spice a bit too suit us, I used 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger and a 1/2 tsp. of allspice in with my lentils and rice. I used 3 cups chicken stock with the lentils and added another 2 cups with the rice. It turned out perfect, the mix of onions with the cinnamon and the spiced lentil mix topped with the yogurt was yummy! Sort of like creamy pasticcio. Will be making this often! Thanks for the great recipe!

I had some leftover cooked basmati rice and split yellow lentils from another recipe so I decided to give this a go. I read the reviews ahead of time and decided to add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and garlic powder to give it some extra flavor. I also had some chopped cilantro on hand so I sprinkled that on top. It turned out great and was easy to make with a simple yet delicious flavor.

First of all, most of lentils smushed when I went to stir it when it was finished. But I digress...As is, I thought it was rather bland. SPICE IT UP! I followed another reviewer who mentioned that traditional Mujadarrah has cinnamon in it. Added that, and thought it tasted like pancakes. Then I added cumin as well and BOOM! Delicious. Even better the next day. I would make it again with the changes I made.

This was so good! As per some of the reviews I changed some things.  I used chicken broth instead of water for the lentils and rice.  I didn't have any cumin so I added some curry instead....YUM!!  Also added the cinnamon to the frying onions. Those few tips really took it to a wonderful level. Topped with some greek yogurt.  My whole family loved this!!  Thanks!

This dish was great! It only didnt get five stars because I did add a half teaspoon of cinnamon when I was cooking the lentils and only a half teaspoon of salt. When I added the rice then I added a full teaspoon of salt, didnt come out too salty or anything. I also cooked the lentils with 2 1/2 cups water, if not they would have dried out. I served this with sour cream because I didnt have yogurt and it was great the onions tasted delicious, I took the recommendation of other reviewers and added sugar while cooking them. My extremely picky 17month old ate his entire serving(sans onions) so this will 100% be a staple in my kitchen!!

I really LOVE this recipe. It is incredibly easy to make and suits all of my family's dietary needs. I cook my rice and lentils separate, I steam my rice, and then cook a bunch more onions because I love the taste. I do believe some of the other reviewers recommended adding spice to the lentils, so that's what I did too and it gave the lentils a little bit more flavor.

We really liked this, but agree with some others that it was pretty plain.  We added a little bit of lowries seasoning at the end, which really helped.  Don't skimp on the onions...they are the best part!

I made this tonight and I am so glad I have some left for tomorrow. I did use brown rice and cooked the lentils and rice together. I added 1 beef bullion, 1 onion bullion and 1 garlic bullion cube into the rice/lentils while cooking. I also added cumin into the rice and cinnamon into the onions as they cooked.

Easy and tasty--a great start.  4 stars because although it needs improvement, it's easy, forgiving, and edible as written.  Followed other suggestions to add boullion and cumin.  Adding just enough water to cover meant that I got some sticking on the bottom, so I kept adding stock to cover by a couple inches to minimize sticking/burning.  Enjoyed it for dinner last night and lunch today with hot sauce.  Travels well--just keep the yogurt on the side until it's reheated--so it's great for making in quantity and taking for lunch.  Great vegetarian dish as written, or vegan without the yogurt.

Yum. I love this stuff. I make it with plain Greek yoghurt. I'd add more onions, but i'm an onion freak so that's a personal preference thing.

Great recipe. The modifications i made;
1) slow cooked the onions for 25 mnts or so
2) added cumin
3) used veg stock instead of water
point to note; it took me a lot longer than 20 mnts after the rice was added, more like 40 mnts. My kids loved it !

We absolutely love this recipe. We do substitute the water with chicken broth.  We add a pinch of cinnamon and a tablespoon of cumin.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Delicious, easy and inexpensive dish. I made it as a main dish on day one, sent leftovers in lunch boxes on day two and used it as a side dish with a roast chicken on day three. Even my picky child liked it! I did add some cumin as suggested. Will try a touch of cinnamon next time, as other posters suggest, and there will be a next time!

Doubled onions and made a cucumber dressing as suggested by another reviewer.  We like spice, so added cinnamon, cumin, and curry.  Ate it with glazed chicken and applesauce.  Absolutely delicious!

delicious, but could have used some cumin i think. I also cooked the rice separately (in a rice cooker) then added it to the cooked lentils and simmered for a little while.  loaded on the sriracha chili sauce after serving.
the yogurt was an awesome compliment to cool down the dish.

I have made this several times since finding it. This was my first experience with lentils! I did tweak the recipe a little like some of the others suggested. I used a vegetable broth/or cube instead of chicken (husband is vegeterian). I also added cinnamon and cummin as the lentils were cooking. Jasmine rice is really good with this also. You will want to caramelize several more onions than the recipe calls for and use a dollop of plain yogurt!

This was great and so easy. I used chicken broth as the liquid when adding rice. I also added a clove of garlic and a few chili flakes at the very end of browning the onions for more flavor. When I was serving it, I squeezed a generous amount of fresh lemon juice over top, then added the yogurt, then garnished with cilantro. It was divine!

I'm rating this 3 for the idea, but as most others I did ramp it up using broth (veg) to cook the lentils and adding cumin and garam marsala...I can't imagine how bland it would be without those additions. I find you have to use more liquid than to "just cover" the lentils, but easy enough to add more.  Don't overcook the lentils as they will turn to mush.

I have been making this dish a loooong time! It is a good meal when you're looking for a simple, quick, healthy meal to serve or going for a meatless dinner sometimes. I also like to mimic the Egyptian way and cook some elbow macaroni in a separate pot, drain and rinse and drizzle on a tablespoon of the oil from the onions and sprinkle salt on it. Put a big spoon of this along with the lentils and rice. You can make a spicey tomato sauce to add that also kicks it up another level:
1 tablespoon oil, 1 large garlic clove, cook the minced garlic over med-high heat until slightly brown add 1 cup water, 2 or 3 tablespoons tomato paste (enuff to make a thin tomato sauce), 1 tablespoon vinegar, a 1/2 teaspoon sugar, maybe 1/4 teaspoon salt (to taste) and 3 or 4 tablespoons hot sauce, bring this to a boil,then turn off the heat, no need to cook longer. Serve along side rice/lentils. Lastly, I usually make way more onions than stated, we like a lot and I add some of the oil that the onions was cooked in to the lentil/rice pot.

Growing up Lebanese, we had this on meatless Fridays.  It is one of my favorites.  I think the cinnamon I add at the end of the cooking time is essential.  Thanks for posting this.

I was hesitant to make this because it sounded bland, but I was surpised how nice it turned out to be. It was a nice simple dish, easy to make, and quick so I give it 5 stars for that, and I would make this again. I did add a little cumin and cinnamon like some had suggested and used millet in place of rice.

Not the greatest, but it has potential. Lentils needed to cook a little longer. I did as some others suggested and added cumin and cinnamon, which I'm glad I did, as it would have been rather bland without it. Needed more salt. I think next time I will do as suggested by one of the reviewers and add a bullion cube.

I cooked basmati rice separately, and added the fried onions to the lentils for the last 5 minutes of simmering. To the simmering lentils I added turmeric and cayenne and before I added the onions to the skillet I melted ghee and sauteed 2 cloves and 1 1/2 tsp. of cumin seeds. Delicious! I've turned vegetarian and this will become a staple. Next time I'll cook the lentils in vegetable broth for even more flavour.

This dish is simple, delicious, and cheap; as I result, I cook this up about twice a month and eat leftovers for days!  Although the basics are there, this recipe really needed some flavor -- but with my some spices added in, I would give it 5 stars. Personally, I use chicken broth instead of water, and I add a dash of cinnamon and curry powder to the broth, as well as 2 tsps of cumin. I also like extra onions, so I usually cook up two or three with this meal. I also think greek yogurt is the best compliment to the dish -- it's tangy and refreshing.  I always cook with brown rice, and I make this dish with brown basmati rice.  The rice takes 35-40min to cook, just like the lentils, so I can drop both in the broth and once and leave it for 40 minutes.  Consider it -- saves time, and it healthy!

So easy and yummy! I've never made lentils before, but I loved this recipe. Even my toddler loved it (shocking!).  After seeing some other reviews, I decided to season the water. I didn't have cumin on hand, so I used a splash of taco seasoning (I know, doesn't exactly go with middle eastern food, but it worked). I also cooked in homemade chicken stock instead of water for flavor (and added health benefits). Topped with a dallop of plain yogurt and served it up for lunch w/ a side of steamed veggies.  Will definitely made this one again (it makes a ton, so I had lots of leftovers. I will have to fry more onions, though, this definitely wasn't enough for us).

Great recipe.  At home we traditionally use lemon juice instead of yogurt.  But I will try yogurt next time. I also add a tsp of cumin for more taste.

I loved it.  some complaints about the yogurt.  I used 3 med onions, 1 1/2 c brown lentils, 1 c brown rice.  Added some cumin, a beef bouillon cube, and garam masala to the lentil cooking stew.

I just finished eating this delicious dish for supper.  I will absolutely be making it again!  I should disclose that I made it for the first time about two years ago, and had an un-tasty result.  Still, I've been in a Middle-Eastern food mood and had a lot of lentils, so I decided to try it again.  Huge difference!  This time, I cooked the onions much longer than 10 minutes - I let them begin to caramelize before adding them to the lentils.  They lent a nice sweetness to the dish.  The onion flavour also melded really nicely with the yogurt and reminded me a bit of stroganoff.  I did alter the recipe slightly by cooking it in my rice cooker instead of in a pot.  It came out beautifully, and was really easy to do.

This recipe is great. I am of middle eastern descent & my mom used to always make this for us, but instead of using rice she would use bulgur. A much healthier altenative! Also u can eat this without the yogurt, & eat with pita bread as my husband does.

This was good, but with the addition of some of the items suggested by others.  I added cinnamon to the onions while frying, and I also added (just a bit of) cumin to the lentils.  I only fried one onion, but it definitely was not enough.  I'll fry three the next time I make this.

Hmmm... I thought this was a bit bland, but tasty enough for a healthy dish - and healthy enough to try again.  I used 3 whole onions and felt they weren't enough.  Next time, I will use at least 5 onions(cuz that's my favorite part!), and add spices to the lentils while cooking... and maybe shredded carrots too!  I didn't have the time to make this all at once, so I cooked the lentils til soft, then cooked the rice in my rice cooker while I was gone.  When I got home, I just stirred the rice into the lentils & proceeded w/ recipe.

This is a great lentil recipe with very basic ingredients. I used reduced fat sour cream for the topping and brown rice to make it a little healthier.

As written, this will be fairly bland. But as so many have suggested, the addition of cumin, chicken bouillon, and a dash of cinnamon will bring this dish to life. It does call for more oil than is needed for 1 onion, and 1 onion is not nearly enough for this dish. I wonder if 1 onion was a typo and the 6 TBSP olive oil was intended for 6 onions? I'll use AT LEAST 4 onions next time, and I'll brown/blacken them again, because that is the key. I'll probably also add garlic and crushed red pepper next time because those are flavors that we love. I omitted the sour cream as I don't care for it "on" things and my store didn't carry plain yogurt this week. Thanks for the recipe, we'll definitely make it again.

I thought this was just ok.  I added the spices as recommended, but it still seemed to be lacking.  Good but not great. Don't think I'll go out of my way to make it again.  But people are right--the onions are key I'd use 3-4 next time.

Excellent!  Very simple.  I made the recipe as written substituting brown rice for the white rice.  As for the water, I generously covered the lentils added the rice right away, added more water to within an inch of the top of the saucepan.  I used extra onions and did not use as much oil.  I will definately add this to the dinner rotation.  Most of the children ate it too!

This was really amazing, so simple, and so nutritious.  I used chicken broth instead of water, used 2 large onions rather than 1, and used Basmati rice.  I sprinkled the onions with 1/2 tsp of cinnamon while they were cooking, as reviewers suggested, and added 1/2 tsp each of cumin and garam masala to the lentil/rice mixture when adding the rice in.  So good.

This is such a simple dish yet so delicious.  Every component makes such a great flavor when put together like this.  Next time, I will make more onions; since it seems like you can't get enough of those.  Other than that, this is such a great recipe that I will be making for years to come!  Thanks so much.

The more you caramelize the onions, the better. I followed the suggestions of some of the Middle Eastern reviewers and added cinnamon, cumin, and chicken bouillon to the rice.  It was very fragrant.

I added some extra spices including cinnamon, as reviewers suggested. I needed to add extra water a couple of times during the cooking. I would say it was pretty good, but not really amazing. The consistance it ended up being was pretty nice. Maybe extra onions would make it better; I only had one large onion. Definitely something I can doctor up though.

This was such a simple recipe that turned out great with lots of room for customization. As my husband and I are "non-tasters" I added cumin and garlic. I will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing a great and simple recipe!

Awesome recipe. The only thing I did different was used a sweet onion because that is what I had on hand. I will use 2 or more onions next time instead of just one.

I like to roast vegetables and add them with this meal for more color.  I love how easy it is to make.  Not to mention it's really quick too.  So delicious!  I am experimenting with it tonight and adding herbs de provence.  I have a feeling it will be even more delicious!

This is delicious!  I had low expectations judging by the ingredients, but the balance of the sweet onions and salty lentils was great.  I added a little bit of cinnamon as other reviewers suggested, and liked it.  This recipes is so simple and cheap ... I'll definitely have it again!

Tried this recipe with the suggestion of others to add cumin and chicken broth and still it did not taste like anything much.  In my family the recipe was placed in the discard pile.  sorry.

Good.  One onion is NOT enough -- next time will use 3. Used chicken broth to cook lentils. Still needed additional salt for flavor.  Otherwise followed directions exactly.  Will make again!

Very good; based on other reviews, I added some cumin and garlic powder. Definitely use plain yogurt for some tang.  Easy and cheap, I'll make it again!

This is a very tasty recipe.   It is good as a side dish but hearty enough to stand on it's own.   I made the mistake of soaking the lentils prior to cooking.  They did not need to soak and that made them overcooked and mushy.   I used chicken broth instead of water once I mixed the rice and lentils.  I used a touch of cinnamon, some cummin and some curry.  I also substituted brown rice for white and cut the oil in half to make it healthier.  The flavor was very nice.

Kind of bland. I think the next time I make this I'll add some garlic powder and instead of fried onions use Durkee onions.

This was really good.  I did add the boullion, garlic and cumin.  Would have liked to have more onion.  The sauteed onions are what really makes the dish.

This recipe get 4 star because it was the base of my recipe or adjustments.   I did like people said and used 3 onions (wish I used 4 or 5). 2 TSP of Cumin and 3 TSP of Garam Masala along with a stick of cinnamon in the onions. 1 stick of butter (maybe next time 1/2 butter & 1/2 Olive Oil) I also used about 3-3/4 to 4 Cups of Chicken Stock with the lentils and Basmati Rice. I like lentils and carrots so I added 1 shredded carrot stick to the onions toward the end.  No leftovers for me

I'm not a lentil fan but wish I was so I decided to try this recipe.  Not bad.  Makes a decent side dish.  Not something I would eat on a regular basis but occassionally.  Next time I make it I am going to fry up bacon then add the onions to that to carmelize.  I won't use the olive oil and just rely on the bacon grease....then it will be amazing!

Thank you! Was looking for something easy, and healthy to make for my clients (group home setting).  Normally picky eaters, they loved this recipe! Its perfect, low in fat, high fiber & protein. And best of all, easy on the wallet.  I wouldn't have known how to even begin cooking lentils.  I added various seasonings to fit it into the rest of the meal.  Very flexible :-)

This dish in general is delicious!  I have Egyptian friends and I believe in Egypt they call this dish Koshariya?  I may be wrong on that.  Their family tops this dish with a spicy tomato sauce (or spaghetti sauce would work as well).

This is a great recipe and one that I will definitely use again. I did as other reviewers suggested and added cumin and a boullion cube to the lentils and rice. Also, I added a dash of cinnamon to the onions, but did not note the difference in taste. But, nonetheless, this recipe is great and one that I suggest to those that love yummy confort foods!

I found this dish just "ok." From the rave reviews I expected a bit more taste. I made it with coriander, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and some vegetable stock in the rice and lentils. I like lentils and love middle eastern food, but was not that impressed with this recipe.  I also think that the ratio of water and lentils should be given in the original recipe; mine came out a little bit too mushy because of the excess water.

I am thrilled that I have found another dish to add to my rotation of dinners! And it is a vegetarian dish!-my family could use to eat less meat.  Thank you to all the hints that others have previously submitted, ex. the addtion of spices, soaking of lentils, rinsing of rice, etc. Definitely, needs yogurt! And cucumber salad was a wonderful suggestion.

A very good base idea, but needs spices (cumin, curry, cinammon) and much more onions. Great with cucumbure salad and very filling.

This recipe is delicious - I was searching for something else to do with lentils besides soup, tried this and now I eat this for breakfast or lunch - my doctor recommended eating more beans, particularly replacing traditional breakfast foods, and I've been using this recipe, as is, for about a year (I don't top with the yogurt or sour cream - I like it plain). And I've lost a LOT of weight, in big part due to replacing my breakfast or lunch with Mujadarrah.

Much easier than the one I had. But was far too bland. A little garlic salt fixed it right up. Also needed twice the onions and olive oil. Next time, I am adding a can of stewed tomatoes. Still rating it with 4 stars just because it was so easy.

I used 2 large onions, 8 tbsp of oil, 1/2 cup golden raisins, 1 cup rice, 3 2/3 cups water, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tbsp sugar, no yogurt or sour cream (didn't have any)...  I cooked the onions, cumin, sugar and raisins on low for 45 min till very browned.  Kids and I liked it.

My husband and I really loved this recipe!  It really was not too bland.  The onions and yogurt are what make the flavor fantastic- I made extra onions for this reason.  Also I used Greek Yogurt b/c it just tastes better in my opinon than regular plain yogurt, and the sour cream was not very tasty!

Like another reviewer said, don't worry about overcooking those onions...the browner, the better!  

Besides tasting wonderful, I think this dish cost us less then $6 to make!

The recipe was not very tasty at all, the onions didn't help. I added some additional seasoning to wake up the taste. I also noticed that the refrigerated leftovers were very thick,  I suggest you eat it all when you make it. The posted recipe makes quite a large batch.

I have no idea how this recipe has such great reviews.  I had high expectations, but there was no flavor--other than the extra spices I added, and even those didn't help tremendously.  I've never eaten a middle eastern dish that didn't at least include garlic or lemon juice--and I love that cuisine.  By the time I added spices, it ended up tasting like a bad creole dish.  This recipe is going right in the trash.

Made this last night! AWESOME! Glad I read some of the reviews as I took the advice and added spices (cumin, masala, extra salt). I did cook garlic with the onions in olive oil for a long time, almost blackened them, but an absolute to achieve the nice flavor as most mentioned. As for water, I followed the directions on my lentils about 6 cups to cover the lentils. When I added the Basmati rice, added a more water to cover. I MADE A LOT! I used yogurt as well...delicious. Hubby loved it, 5yr old not so much, 3yr-NOT, and 13 month old loved it! This dish was a side to my grilled karahi masala spice blend for chicken, also, sauteed spinach in same pan as the onions and garlic with a few spices, and a cucumber tomato feta greek salad. Yes, a mixture of cultures but I love Indian, Arabic, and greek foods...all together! This dish will become a staple in our home as well. Thank goodness for the reviews! Helped a lot!

I think this is a nice base recipe, but I needed to add a few more spices for my taste. I sauteed garlic in olive oil, then added cumin, coriander, and garam masala, then added the lentils and then adding brown rice and water. I would like to know the amount of water you're supposed to use, but I guessed and added a bit too much, so my mixture is soupy (I'm letting it cook longer as I write, hoping to cook off some of the moisture). As for the onions, I took the suggestion of other reviewers and let them cook much longer, until a deep brown. This probably took half an hour. (Tip: Add salt to draw moisture out of the onion and just a pinch of sugar to aid in the caramelization process. Yellow onions will caramelize fastest because of their higher sugar content.) I splurged on full-fat yogurt for the topping - just as bad for you as sour cream, but so lovely! Thanks for a healthy recipe, which I'm sure I'll return to.

This recipe is best JUST the way the recipe is. I too agree that there is something very good and authentic about the delicate flavors blending together (and I am usually one for heavy spices).  My bean-picky hubby loved this too.

Delicious!  This is Lebanese comfort food so remember not to add any spices or anything extra for the true authentic flavor.  And DO carmelize the onions properly - almost black - otherwise their sweetness won't come out and the dish will be flavorless. Also, I used cold leftover basmati rice and added it at the end.  Was  really really good. Again, remember it's comfort food so don't look for "snazzy" and "spicy"!

I hate not to give things 5 stars, but even with adding the extra spices some of the other reviewers recommended (garam marsala, cinnamon, etc), I still thought this was just ok.  I love Indian food, but have never had this in a restaraunt so I have nothing else to compare it to.

These were so delicous!!!  My only change was that I added 1 tsp of beef base with the rice.  I also had to add quite a bit of water.  The key, like other reviewers said, was to really carmelize (almost burn) the onions.  It gave it the most delicious flavor!  Thank you for a new super healthy side for my family.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I added coriander and cumin to the onions while cooking them! It was so good, I wanted to go on and on about it, but I had company and didn't want to look like I was bragging.  I really loved it!  Delicious!

This was tasty, albeit a bit bland.  I've since made this dish again and added two chicken bouillon cubes and fried an extra onion and it was much more flavorful.

Yum!  This is so good and so simple!  Be sure to let the onions carmelize...getting really brown and toasty.  That's what makes this dish so yummy.  I cut the oil down to 3 Tablespoons, which was plenty, and I used white Basmati rice.  I served it with hummus and pita and a mixed green salad topped with sunflower seeds and balsamic vinegarette....all the flavors went so well together.  My husband, who was skeptical when he came to the table, declared it a "keeper" by the end of the meal.

This was delish!  

I used 3 cups of canned broth. Exactly the amount of liquid needed. Took 20 mins to cook it through. I added 1 tbsp of cumin but left out the cinnamon from other viewers comments.
The fried onions definitely added to the flavor of the dish.  I did cut back on the olive oil though.  It makes a lot for 2 people.  I used sour cream on the side cuz I love it and it really complimented the flavors.  With or without the sour cream was still very tasty!  Not a yoghurt fan.

I made it for all of my housemates- there are 10 of us!- and everyone loved it. I even had a housemate eat the stuff I burned at the bottom of the pot.

On a related note- be aware that these are small serving sizes. For ten people, I'd make enough for 13 or 14 servings according to this recipe.

This is a delicious recipe.  I went with some of the suggestions, and some improvements of my own. I added: cumin, ground coriander seed, cinnamon, lemon zest, garlic, salt and black pepper.  I will definitely make it again!

This was good,not great. I thought it was a little bland.  I did use extra onion and broth and added cumin as suggested, and I think without them it would be boring.  I was uncertain about using cinnamon, so I added just a sprinkle.  Next time I'll leave the cinnamon out.

I've made lentils and rice together like this, but never with the addition of the fried onions, cinnamon, and yogurt. I was apprehensive about the cinnamon, but it was super tasty. Also, really cheap, which is always good! Thanks for the recipe

My husband was skeptical but enjoyed it in the end though the yogurt really brought out the flavour.  I added more onion but 6 tbsps of oil is far too much even for extra onions.  Brown rice (cooked separately, then mixed) with additons of cumin, cinnamon, garlic, garam masala and stock.  Careful though, you may not want company afterwards as this may give you a noisy bottom!

I have no idea what this dish "should" taste like, but it was quite tasty and filling. As others suggested, I added cumin & cinnamon. Next time I will AT LEAST double the onions. Also, because I didn't know how much water to add I put a teakettle on the stove and kept some water simmering there. When the lentils got low on water I was able to add hot water as needed, without slowing down the cooking by adding cold water.
This is a dish I will keep for times of year when we need meatless dishes.

This recipe was fantastic! It is easy to make, healthful and economical. As I am a semi-vegetarian,I am always looking for ideas and this is a keeper. I also added cumin and used the homemade vegetable stock I had on hand. Dont forget to use the yogurt as it really adds to the final dish. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was easy to prepare, healthy, very inexpensive and tasted great.  Even my picky family liked it.  We will definitely keep this on on the list for those low budget weeks when the grocery $$ is gone.  The sour cream garnish is a nice touch and makes the dish.

Very yummy, even the kids liked it.  Next time, will cook 2 to 3 onions-1 not enough and they are so good with the lentils.  Added cumin, garlic powder and salt to lentils otherwise not enough flavor. Cooked rice and lentils separately as recommended to give more control over lentil firmness.  Used non-fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I will make this again!

I tried my best to follow the recipe, but I think mine came out wrong. The lentils turned into a kind of mush with the rice and onions. I followed the other sugestions of adding more onions etc but thought it was still lacking something.

This is the authentic rice and lentils from Aleppo. Very tasty! I eat it with either fried onions, or with a yogurt sauce with cucumber, garlic, mint, and a dash of salt.

I adore this recipe!  I used red lentils and when I fried the onions, I used three Vidalia onions with the 2 tsp. cumin as suggested.  I also used vegetable broth when cooking the onions to round out this vegetarian dish.  We had sour cream available, but if you skip it, it makes for a completely tasty vegan dish.  Yum!  My son had two platefuls and asked for the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  You absolutely cannot go wrong with this dish. Thank you Melissa for sharing it with us.

This recipe is really good.  I like lentils and I'm always looking for a new way to prepare them.  I wasn't too sure about the sour cream, but to my surprise it makes the dish.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This recipe is quick simple and taster great.  It has to be served with sour cream to get the full affet.  It is a great comfort food.

I think that I used the wrong type of rice, and my lentils did not cook through, but I will try again, it was still yummy! The onions were delicious too.

I double the onions and cook them long and slow in nice olive oil so that there are lots of crispy bits for the top and through the rice and lentils.  I added a tsp of cumin and garlic to the rice and lentils.  Yummy!!

I find this very tasty and satisfying. I do use 3-4 onions and top with plain Greek yogurt. This is one of those great "I forgot to thaw something what do I cook?" recipes and the leftovers are just as good the next day

It's a delicious and super simple meal!  But, it's true that the directions are a bit lacking.  Definitely add cumin and bouillon to lentils.  And, frying/caramelizing onion prob takes more than 10 mins, but once they start to brown, the onions can burn in an instant, so be very attentive and STIR them around.  Definitely worth doing this step--I love the flavor of the onion with the lentils!!  Oh, and I just cooked the rice and lentils separately.

I have eaten and made this for years!!!!!!!! Today I just wanted to see how much water to add because mine is either too runny and mushy or not enough water. So I am going to add the water just as it says, enough to cover the lentils then enough to cover when the rice is added... Wish me luck!!  (gve it 5 stars cause I love this!!)

Like the others, I added cumin and garam masala and used three onions. I would probably even use more onions next time. You can never have enough carmelized onions!

I'm giving a 3 because more information on how much water would have been helpful. Also it's a little bland tasting so other spice/flavoring suggestions would be useful.

I rated this 4 stars because as written I thought it was good, but rather bland. I prefer a bit more flavor, so the second time I made it, I made the following changes:

-didn't salt lentil water (they won't soften if salted)
-omitted the oil (you really don't need it with a lid on).
-used 3 onions and added salt and a dash of cinnamon to them as they cooked. 
-used vegetable broth instead of water.
-added a Tbls cumin & a tsp Garam Masala to the lenils as they cooked.
-made this a one pot dish by using a large deep frying  pan to caramelize the onions, removed them to a dish, then cooked the lentils & rice in the same pan. (No like washing dishes :)

Made this for dinner tonight and wasn't overly impressed. I followed the recipe exactly and found that the cooking times are off. The lentils were still a bit firm and over all, it lacks any flavor. I will look for an authentic recipe for this dish and try again.

I made this dish as per the recipe.  Then, after having a sample before topping with the rest of the onion and  yogurt, I decided to add some cumin and curry powder.  This is a great base recipe and allows you to add whatever flavors you feel would suit it. I much prefer having the rice added, to just a straight lentil recipe. For myself, I will also be adding more onion for next time.

I can't really say that I made this recipe. What I made was a greatest hits version of this recipe and all of the reviews. I increased the amount of onions by a lot (like 6 medium onions, I think?), and cooked them over very low heat the entire time the rest of the dish was cooking so that they developed a deep, rich flavor. I added chicken bullion powder to the lentil water (3 cups), and 1/2 t. of cumin and 1/4 t. of cinnamon to the rice water (2 more cups), plus a fair amount of s&p. The end result was delicious. I give the original recipe 3 stars for being a good place to start, but with these changes, it's a fantastic dish.

I have had this recipe saved for  years and finally made it tonight. I followed the recipe as is except I used chicken stock instead of water and brown rice. It was bland even using the stock so I could only imagine using water. It's a good basic recipe that I will tweak and I have no doubt it will be tasty.

Very good, simple and tasty. As always was looking to use what I had which was cooked rice so I cooked the lentils separately until done then proceeded with the recipe, Used 4 onions but it wasn't enough :) Next time 6! Read many of the reviews and did increase the spice adding cumin and using veggie broth as the liquid. Thanks so much for this recipe it's a keeper :)

This was really good! I only used one large onion but wish I'd used two. I did caramelize the onion for a lot longer than 10 minutes--probably more like 25. I added a bullion cube and some cumin to the lentils as they cooked and a touch of cinnamon to the onions as others suggested and it was delicious (and I'm not usually one who likes cinnamon in savory dishes).

I've made this a few times now because it is: 1. Easy 2. Tasty 3. Cheap 4. Most ingredients are always on hand. The fried onions are sooo good, it's hard not to eat too many before mixing them in! Don't skip the yogurt, it really finished the dish.

I really enjoy this recipe.  I've made it twice now with only slight changes. I do add a good bit of cumin to the lentils when they are done.  I also caramelize TWO onions because they really are what give it flavor.  Also, the recipe makes a TON.  I will half it next time as not to have quite so many leftovers.

This is an okay recipe. I increased the amount of onion to 3 Vidalia onions since we love onions in my household. I sauteed the onions for good 20 mins to give it time to properly caramelized. 

 I cooked my lentils in chicken stock (I added 3 cups) and then put the rice in after the lentils had simmered for 20 mins. I poured in two cups chicken broth to cook the rice and lentils and let that simmer on low heat for another 35 minutes. 20 mins in I added ground coriander (a pinch), garam marsala (1tbs), and cinnamon (1 tsp) at the end to increase the flavors in the lentil and rice mixture.

I added 1 tsp of cumin to my lentils plus a chicken bouillon cube. Cooked my 2 onions for around 30 minutes on low ( with about 2 Tbsp. of olive oil) and added a dash of cinnamon to them at the start (per other reviews). Served with Greek yogurt on top, shish tawook, a Greek salad, and homemade pita. This was delicious!

I added 1 teaspoon of cumin as another reviewer suggested and used brown rice. I halved the recipe and enjoyed it very much. I used sour cream rather than yogurt.  The onions really make this dish and the more the better.

Oh how I love this. I've made this several times. I tweak it little by little until it was perfect. Cooking long grain rice is just an impossible task. It was always under done and the lentils overdone. Here's what I came up with. I cooked 1 1/2 cup lentils for 20 minutes in chicken stock. I added two teaspoons of cumin powder. Now here's the secret........Use boil and bag rice. Just cut two bags open and drop the rice in with the lentils and cook for additional 10 minutes. (I used family size bags) You will need to add more chicken stock.

I also use yellow onions and I tripled it. BTW add 1-2 Tablespoons of butter and the onions will brown quicker.

I made this last night as a side dish using red and green lentils and jasmine rice. I sautéed a sweet yellow onion to stir in and garnish. I used alot of cumin and black pepper. i served with whole milk plain greek yogurt. The only thing I did differently in the recipe  was that I sautéed the onion in chopped bacon, which I know would never be traditional given its origin. The bacon addition was perfect for our western palates. A great recipe, a good comfort food.

Made this for dinner last night and we really enjoyed it. I followed some of the advice written in the reviews and changed about half of the water for chicken broth and added a tbsp of cumin and a pinch of cinnamon to the lentils while they were cooking. I also swapped the rice for long grain, whole grain rice. We love onions, so I doubled the amount of onions and slowly caramelized them in too much butter to admit to :)
Served it with sour cream and a side salad... Delicious :-)

This recipe was great! I did add cumin and cayenne spices though. I also used chicken stock in place of water.

WOW! This was so simple and yet so delicious! I made when we had friends over and they as well as my 2 year old gobbled this up.  It was so clean and delicious. This will be a regular in our dinner rotation from now on! I used bouillon at the suggestion of others but didn't add any spices and TBH I don't think it needs it. I did double the onions because in my house you can never have too many caramelized onions.

I use this as a base recipe with the following modifications for depth::  
1.  Lots of ground cumin in the lentil/rice mixture
2. Sprinkle some cumin seeds into the cooking onions
3. Cook the thinly sliced onions over low and slow heat until the carmelize (at least as long as the lentil/rice mixture cooks. 
4.  Add a spoonful of Sambal Oelek with the yogurt when serving. (Sambal Oelek is a spicy tangy chili paste and can be found next to siracha at the market)
5.  Serve with a lemon wedge.

Just like the simplicity of it. My wife threw in more spices. Cooked the rice separately in a rice cooker.

I've never heard of this dish but tried it based in the ingredients and reviews. The only thing I changed was vegetable stock instead of water to cook the lentils and rice. What a wonderful vegetarian meal this made for me.  I will definitely make this again but will probably do 3 instead of 1 onion.  I used the yogurt as recommended and it was perfect.  I liked it so much in fact that I decided to create an account just to write this review.

Okay, I hate it when people totally change a recipe and then pooh pooh it. This recipe is the basic one, and it's quite good. However, having read the Ottolenghi version, I fused them together. Added some flour to the sliced onions which made it crunchy and chewy after it browned. Then to the rice I added coriander and cumin seeds, cinnamon, allspice, turmeric, sugar. Stunning results.

I was unsure how much water goes first in the lentils, and then after adding the rice.  I attempted to add by simply covering the rice and lentils but I failed miserably.

I loved it and will definitely make it again but I took a few suggestions and made the following adaptations: 

-  added 3 chicken bouillon cubes
-  a couple tablespoons of cumin 
-  a dash of cinnamon 
-  lots of salt and pepper
-  used 1.5 medium onions and carmelized them over low heat for 25 or so minutes
-  didn't have plain yogurt so I used tzatziki as a garnish.  

My wife said it needed more onions and I think she was right.  Next time I will use 3 onions.  She was less impressed than I was but I cannot wait for leftovers for lunch.

This was definitely a pleasant surprise! Had many doubts as I was cooking- didn't smell good. But when everything came together, this was hearty and on point! Will make again for sure! Added more onion (would definitely add 2 or 3 onions next time) and added cumin and coriander powders. So yummy!

I doubled this recipe and used 4 onions, used half veg broth, half water. Also added 1 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp each cinnamon and allspice. I caramelized the onions very well. Fantastic!

I made this because I needed more protein in my diet and it was quick and easy.  I really didn't expect that i would love it but i did!  I add a few shakes of cayenne  pepper,  sea salt and 3 whole cloves of garlic to the lentils and rice while cooking!

This recipe was really good.  I did add cumin as many of the reviews suggested.  The only other thing I would change is to make more onions.  Many, many more onions.  They really made this dish.  I think I would do 2 onions next time instead of just 1.  Also, I don't know if this made much difference, but I used butter instead of olive oil for the onions.  Anyway, it was very tasty and I will definitely be making it again!

Made for a great lunch.  I added cumin and turmeric to the lentils, as others have said. I added a pinch of cinnamon to the rice when it was done steaming (great idea! a little goes a long way and it makes the house smell wonderful).  I served in bowls with plain yogurt on top (an onions as directed) but also some cut up red grapes and some spinach leaves on the side.  The red grapes are what convinced my 3 & 4 year olds to eat it! Whole family approved. Will make again!

I like lentils and this recipe looked interesting. I added extra garlic and cumin to the lentils.  And used some chicken stock, too, in place of water.  Since I had to guess how much water to add, it came out a little mushy.  So the flavor was good (I esp. liked the onions), but it was mushy, which was not to my liking.  I served with plain yogurt, and had some mint and cilantro as well.
UPDATE- I made this again and was better able to gauge the water amounts so it was not mushy.  I actually cooked the lentils for 10-15 mintues before adding the rice.  Then I added the rice and more water and cooked for about 30-40 more minutes.  Also, I added a bit of allspice, which added another dimension of flavor.  I served with a yogurt+lemon juice+dill sauce and it was remarkable.

This is an Arabic dish, so people adding garam masala is quite annoying as that isn't used in Arab food.  This can get slightly bitter if you overlook the lentils, but the rice, yogurt and onions balance that out. The onions add sweetness so caramelize as much as you can. Great recipe, as an Egyptian this is quite authentic. We also add a little bit of cumin and bullion to add depth to the flavor.

I had to make this after seeing that it got such high ratings. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added cumin and more onions. I caramelized the onions for over an hour but still it was so bland. It was better smothered in yogurt. Easy recipe but I will not make it again.

I used red onion and brown lentils because that is what I had. Also used garlic infused olive oil and a little Harissa pepper infused olive oil. It was wonderful! Great comfort food! I also followed other's advice and used a chicken bullion cube and added the cumin and cinnamon.

First time making this recipe and it's really good. In addition to what's here I added cumin, garam masala, garlic and ginger paste, powdered garlic and ground ginger. Came out very good. I also used chicken broth in the lentils and instead of combining them I put the rice in a rice cooker and lentils on the stovetop and combined at the end. I also didn't use as much olive oil because I figured a tablespoon was enough to sauté the onions in. Will make again.

Oh. My. God.  This is truly an amazing dish, both in simplicity and taste. Based on reviewer comments and what I had on hand, here is what i did:

Doubled the onions (I used cooking onions), used less olive oil and browned for 45 minutes, adding a dash of cinnamon toward the end. Meanwhile I started the depuy lentils, 1\2 c brown rice, water and chicken broth. Started out with half tsp each of salt and cumin, and ended up adding as much again cumin, maybe more. It was done after 30-40 minutes. I stirred in the onions, cooled it to room temp, and topped it with a dollop of plain yogurt. 

Think I'm going to explore more Egyptian cuisine!

I really like the taste of this, but my lentils were mush.  I'm assuming it's because I used brown rice, not white, and I needed to extend the cooking time for the rice.  Next time I may cook them separately, or re-examine the timing.  Also, I cooked up some extra onion rings because I kept eating them when the lentils were cooking!  I'll just cut up 2 onions from the get-go next time.

I was hoping this would be really good with how affordable it is to make with cabinet staples. However, it really just did not have any flavor. I also had to stand over the stove watching it, making it time consuming. I like lentils, but guess I just prefer them in soup. My recommendation if making this dish is to cook the rice separately, so as to not over cook the lentils. I added a little garlic salt to season and it helped some.

Very tasty with modifications.  Based on other reviews, I added cumin, curry powder and a little cinnamon.  The rice wasn't ready so I moved to a skillet and finished cooking.  Recommend using more than one onion.

Added 1 tsp of cumin to the lentils and rice. Also used half water and half chicken stock. Added a pinch of cinnamon to the onions. Really need MORE onions (3 or 4). Yogurt is KEY.

I've never had Mujadarrah before, and this dish was really good! The suggestions from reviewers were helpful, especially those for whom this was an ethnic dish. I did arrive at the finished product in a slightly different manner. I sauteed about two large onions for 15 minutes, adding cinammon (brings flavor to another level!) and cumin to the onions. Separately microwaved long-grain rice according to pkg directions, adding two chicken bouillon cubes to the water. Had to use up some TJoes prepared lentils (very good btw), so heated and added those to 1/2 the onions (saving 1/2 for topping), rice, salt and pepper. Also added some sodium-free chicken broth, as needed, to keep it moist while just to heat up. Served topped with the sauteed onions, and ff Greek yogurt (a must!) and some kalamita olives on the side. A great Lenten meal! Thanks for the great recipe, Melissa...it's a keeper!

I've never had mujadara before so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like, but I think it turned out pretty good. I used 2 onions and added cinnamon, cumin, salt and cayenne to them after they were cooked. I let the onions cook for closer to 20 minutes. I also used brown basmati rice instead. I used this recipe in addition to another recipe that had more detailed steps. It said to add the rice to the pan with the onions once they're done cooking and then add the cooked lentils, 3 cups of water and 1 1/2 tsp of salt. I also added a chicken flavored boost pack at this time. Then I covered it and let it simmer for 30 minutes. The yogurt was a must for me. I used nonfat plain greek yogurt. This was easy to make with little prep time and it travels well. I can take this to work for lunch for several days!

Yummy!  I had to sub dried green spilt peas. Because we had to go out for a few hours right before dinner, I transferred the peas to a crock pot when it was time to add the rice. Layered rice, subbed vegetable broth for water  to cover, then added the cooked onions. Cooked on high for a few hours. I was afraid I'd have split pea soup but the consistency of the peas was good. Needed more broth to make the rice a little softer though, I think. The onions weren't too mushy this way, either. They were so good if make more of them next time. Husband loved this and kept going back for more helpings, and he normally doesn't like peas. Hardly any leftovers. I know I subbed the main ingredient (didn't have lentils on hand) but I'm sure this recipe is delicious as written, too!  Will definitely try again!

A little bland as written, but wonderful with salt, a generous amount of sumac, a little cinnamon, a little red pepper and a touch of cumin. Since we nearly always have cooked brown rice in our refrigerator, I sauteed the onions, added cooked lentils, cooked brown rice, a little chicken broth for moisture and seasoned to taste.

This is delicious! I had split red lentils and basmati rice cooked in vegetable broth. Put it together with Greek yogurt, a Thai cucumber salad, and the onions (I used butter and vietnamese cinnamon). I finish where I started: delicious!

I just made this, and like a few others, I altered the recipe as I cooked. I added garam masala and cumin while the lentils and rice were cooking, at the suggestions of other users. In the end I decided there wasn't enough onion so I added about half an onion more. I also threw in some rice vinegar, which gave it a nice kick. Definitely don't skip the yogurt, it lightens the dish, I even threw in a spoonful of garlic hummus to add to the flavor.

A very easy recipe to make for anyone, all ingredients are readily available, and prep/cooking time were all just over an hour to complete.
I also took some advice/variations from fellow members and used less olive oil, more onion, 3/4 of a chicken bouillon cube, a few light shakes of cumin along with a pinch of curry powder and paprika.
Otherwise followed recipe exactly and wound up with a very unique flavor when topped with greek yogurt and onions, moist evenly cooked texture bursting with flavor that was a really nice surprise. This will be served every 7-10 days in my home from now on, makes a great main course with crusty bread and a salad...

A very hearty yet healthy dish. I add more spice to kick up the flavor. Def add cinnamon to the onions and cook way longer than the recipe says, about half an hour.

I made this without the rice, and it was simple & delicious, even without yogurt. I think yogurt would be good if you spiced this up - it's pretty much spice-less, which is a little odd, but still surprisingly tasty. A lot of the positive reviews seem to recommend adding some spices, which is not what this recipe calls for.

Made this for the first time, and added 4T. of cilantro base cooking flavoring.  I will make this again, but will utilize some of the additions  recommended by other reviewers; cinnamon, chicken bouillon and cumin.  I did use brown rather than white rice.  I followed the directions of adding enough water to cover the lentils and then the rice and lentil mixture.

Comfort food is usually not highly spiced or flavored, and as I didnt' grow up eating this, it did seem a bit bland to me.  But I still liked the dish and think it has good potential for me.  I used sweet onion, brown basmati rice, and puy lentils as those are my favorites, and I did add a pinch of cayenne for a little heat.  I would make again but would add more spices for a little more flavor for my tastes.  Still it's simple and good.

This is a great recipe.  I did cut the olive oil down to two tablespoons and used a no stick pan. It cuts down on the fat and calories and it doesn't affect the taste.

Hubby made this the other day when we had guests for dinner, it was good but I think lacking just a little in flavor.  May saute onions in butter next time for some added flavor.

This recipe is delicious and inexpensive!  Consider doubling or tripling the amount of onion and adding garam masala and some cumin for added flavor.

I'm surprised this was so well-reviewed as I was seriously underwehlemed by the dish.  Lacking flavor and seasoning.  Wish I had read the bit about adding cinnamon, that might have enhanced the dish.  I will probably pass on making this again.

Thhis was great. I used red lentils, Uncle Bens tomatoe flavored rice, and also added lots of cumin. I also grilled up some cut up turkey sausage to make this more of an entree. It is definitely great with some plain yogurt mixed in.

I would give this a 5 star had the recipe been how I prepared it(which was with the help of many of the other reviews).  I agree with many of the other reviewers...as written this would be super bland. I did use the cumin, salt and pepper(just a little) and I did not have the chicken boulion so I used chicken flavored adobo seasoning(about a tablespoon I guess)...it seemed to work well and give it a nice flavor.  I am sure when I make it again(and I will) it will be a different flavor with the boulion. I am also going to try the garam masala next time as well..just need to get the spices to make my own. I do recommend this recipe, just read through some of the reviews and get some of your own ideas to up the flavor spectrum a bit.

There are a lot of problems with this recipe.  Like others have said, there is too much oil, not enough onions, and more spices are needed.  I don't know whether I'll try again revamping almost everything or just look for another recipe.

A little bland without the yogurt. We used a garlic yogurt mixture within the Shish Tawook recipe on this site and it was much better! Very hearty dish and we loved the onions!

I was a little nervous to introduce this one to my husband and little boys... but they enjoyed it!  Plain yogurt is not something we really enjoy, but it was SO good with this dish!  I will make this again and again.  Also, I have found this to be a great meal to eat for dinner the night before a big run.

I followed the advice of a number of people and added some spices to it--cinnamon with the onions (heavenly) and some chicken bullion, garlic powder, and cumin to the lentils. You could really add quite a variety of spices to this--it's pretty versatile. It turned out great--I will definitely be making this more often! Thanks for the easy recipe!

I love this dish!  I had never had it before and it's fantastic.  Rated 4/5 since I used some of the suggested additions and didn't make the recipe completely as written.  I added cumin, garlic, red pepper flakes, and chicken stock in with the lentils and rice.  I will be making this a lot in the future!

Wow! Way tastier than I expected for such a simple recipe. Entire family loved it, even my elementary age children who don't like onions. As other reviewers suggested, I  decreased oil, added 2 tsp of cumin, about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and served topped with Greek Yogurt. Fantastic!

What a great dish to make when you're low on funds. The rice and lentils are so cheap and yet so delicious! When I make this, I definitely eat it with plain yogurt and make sure to add a bunch of curry as well! (adding salt really helps the flavor come out as well.)

This was very good.  The only thing I may do differently next time is add more onions.  I wasn't too sure about cooking the rice and lentils in the same pot with an inexact measurement of water, but it worked.  I turned the flame off after the water came back to a boil after adding the rice and water and just let it rest, tightly lidded for 15 minutes.  The rice was perfectly cooked and the lentils had just enough bite.

Very easy! I added some salt, cumin and chicken broth while cooking. Used sour cream because that's what I had on hand, it added a lot to the dish. Will be making again.

OK, this was a very good base recipe.  yes, you need to add more spices, and you need to watch liquid levels, but after adding spices, it tasted great.  I put brown jasmine rice, 2 cloves of diced garlic, and the lentils into a pot, and added 4 cups of liquid (2 cans of chicken broth, and then a bit of water to bring the liquid level to 4 cups).  It was just the right amount of liquid.   As others noted, onions are key---  I used 4 medium sized onions.  Also to the lentils/rice, I added cumin, garam masala, cinnamon, and garlic powder.  We used plain yogurt (not sour cream) as condiment.  The dish was delicious and healthy.  Oh, and i think 6 T of olive oil was more oil than necessary to caramelize the onions, next time, I 'm going to halve the oil.

I probably should give this a 4 since I modified like others suggested (added cumin, garam masala, and crushed garic clove to the lentils while cooking), but it's so good I went with 5 anyways. As far as how much water to add, I've read up on lentils and it really depends on which ones you use and how old they are. Older lentils need more water as they tend to be drier. So you might have to add more water as it cooks if using older lentils. Best to keep track of how much water you've added though, so you can subtract the amount needed for the rice. I will definitely make this again. My 2 year old also loved it!

I thought this was great.  It was my introduction to Middle Easern food.  I used split peas because that's what I had on hand.  I only had one small white onion.  Next time, I will make this with three or four onions.  I love how that carmelized onion flavor mixes all through the mixture.  I just ate it plain--no yogurt or sour cream.  Next time I'll try it with yogurt.  Thank you for the experience.

Five starts for and easy go-to meal. I added 1 T cumin, 1 T chili powder and 2t chicken boulion to lentils. I sauteed the onions for 30 to 40 minutes to get them nice and caramelized. Next time I will be sure to have sour cream or yogurt to top with.

Very tasty dish. I doubled the onions, added some garlic and fresh mint. I also drizzled some olive oil and added some feta cheese before serving.

My family felt it would have been better just lentils and no rice.  Flavor was good, not spicy, but not bland either.

This is so easy and delicious.  I have tried with red & green lentils, I like green better.  Add cinnamon to the onions and brown til crispy, add garam masala to the lentils and use vegetable broth for the lentils/rice (about 4 cups).

I really wanted to like this more. I'm going through a lentils kick right now and wanted to try it another way. It was just okay. I loved the onions though. I made three. Moroccan lentil soup is by far the best lentil recipe here.

Unbelievably simple and delicious.  Browning the onions is key to the flavor - I would recommend increasing the temperature a bit when sauteeing.  I might also increase the amount of onion the next time by about 1/2.

Okay if you need a vegetarian meal.  Not a huge favorite, only dh and I ate this as a fasting option though but could see making again.  Used brown lentils instead of green.

This is so good! I did add an extra onion as well as 4 cloves of garlic and about 2 tbsp. of cumin to the lentils. This is very flavorful if you are liberal with the spices. I also squeezed a little fresh lemon after it was cooked which added a nice zip. Thanks for posting!

This recipe was yummy. A bit bland though. I did add lots of cumin and the cinnamon to the onions as suggested from other reviewers. Next time I will add masala. I highhhly suggest using non fat greek yogurt as it is thick and creamy as sour cream but with out the calories. I also suggest cooking the onions slowly (I cooked them the entire time the lentils were cooking on a lower heat. They are delicious) and to add more. Will make this again, but needs a little improvement.

We had this recipe tonight and really enjoyed it.  I'm sure we'll skip the yogurt next time as only 2 out of 4 liked it with the yogurt.  This recipe made a very large dish, as a side dish we had enough lentils/rice for at least 10 people, but barely enough onions for 4. I followed the recipe exactly, but I'll make these changes next time: I'll halve the amount of lentils and rice and double the amount of onions.  The onions really bring this all together into a very flavorful dish, whether you like the yogurt added or not.

This is an easy dish to put together and healthy too. As a spice fan I thought the original recipe was a bit bland. Sweet onions makes a big difference. I used Vidalia onions which bring out a sweet savory flavor. I tweaked it to my liking by adding cumin, chickpeas, and kasha, garlic and LOTS of onions. Excellent fiber. Thanks for the recipe!

It is a great recipe, but I'm giving it 4 stars because it needs more tweeking in my opinion. I used two onions that I fried really long and will definitely make it with 3 or 4 the next time. I also used more of the spices such as Turmeric powder and more Paprika. For the rice I'll use at least 4 chicken cubes the next time to give it more flavor. Serving this dish with Yoghurt and a side of cucumber salad is perfect! Will definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've been a lurker here for years, but this recipe got me to join!  The reviews are most helpful.  Based on the input, I used two large onions and will use four next time.  I also made it very non-Muslim by browning pork in the skillet (and removing it) before I added butter and cooked the onions.  I did this while the lentils cooked, so by the time the rice/lentil mixtue was done, the onions were very carmelized.  Also used cinnamon with the onions and cumin/curry powder with the lentil/rice mix.  Going to try to find garam masala here just for this recipe.    Here (we're Am. expats living in Thailand) all the yogurt is thin and way too sweet, so I used sour creme.  That definitely made it.  After one bite, DH and I agreed that it needed cilantro, so I added a few leafs to the top.  It gave nice color and wonderful flavor.    This recipe is a real keeper, uses locally available ingredients and works well with my limited kitchen facilities.    Hubby and I ate the entire recipe in one sitting!

Add me in as another one who added cumin and cinnamon, though I went one further and also cooked some chicken with the onions. Delicious.

This recipe was pretty fanatstic but i gave it four stars instead of five because i did all all that was suggested by others, more onions and added cumin cinnamon and garam masala and a chicken stock cube to lentils and rice while cooking. although I did not have any trouble with everything becoming mush. I agree with others that the recipe should be more specific as far as how much water to add (just to cover can be open to many different interpretations and I can see how easily a less experienced cook can end up with a disaster on their hands! otherwise, thanks for posting!

This a great quick and healthy meal. Definitely use chicken stock for the water or add bullion. I added cumin also as another cook suggested. My husband was pleasantly surprised by how good this meatless dish was.

I've been trying to eat better and this sounded easy, inexpensive, and delicious from the reviews I read. I made it as the recipe stated with the additions of 2 extra onions and cumin as suggested by reviewers. I ate it right after it was done and it was ok...very earthy tasting and bland. I even jazzed up the sour cream topping w/a squeeze of lemon juice and some garlic. I had to toss the leftovers.

so yeah, this does sound really boring, but I thought this was freaking delicious! I had never even had this type of food before, and was really surprised that I liked it so much.  I took a few other reviewers suggestions and added some cumin, which I think is really necessary.  I also used some plain non-fat Greek yogurt and it was just amazing, not to mention super cheap to make.  I just finished all my leftovers, and am about to go make some more.  Yum!

I really, really, really wanted to like this. It sounded so good and got pretty good reviews. I used more onion, tried a little more spice. But it's lentils and rice. Quite unappealing in the end, even with all the changes. We went out to eat instead...

This was really good.  My dh and I loved it.  Ifollowed some previous suggestions and used garam masala, cinnamon, garlic and cumin.  It still was pretty mild.  But the onions and yogurt made all the difference. Cheap and yummy. Oh and definitly go for extra onions.

Very nice, easy, and quick meal.  Followed other reviewers' advice and added garam masala and cumin to the lentils, as well as cinnamon to the three onions I used. My husband said it was delicious and requested that it be added to our regular dinner rotation.  Thanks Melissa!

WOW!! I have never had Arabic food before, so I thought I would give this a try out of curiosity. It was absolutely amazing! It was so incredibly simple to make, yet it was filling and so, so declicious. My husband loved it and my eighteen month old daugter gobbled it right up. My only recommendation would be to add another whole onion. I love onions, and wish there were twice as many. Also, definitely add cinnamon to the onions as they're frying as the other reviewers suggested - the flavor and aroma is awesome. There were no leftovers in our house last night! Yummm!

This is so simple and so odd...and so good! The yogurt adds just the right tangy tartness. The whole family liked it, even my picky eater (husband) who doesn't like "weird stuff." I will definitely fix it again. Only thing I did differently was use brown rice for extra fiber.

I give this a 4 but my brother gives it a 5. It tastes a lot like the filling in a Mexican beans and rice burrito. I followed the recipe but also added Cumin and chicken stock to the lentils, as others suggested. I used plain yogurt as well, but do think that sour cream would have worked just as well. The only major change I would suggest is 2 or 3 onions instead of 1!

Budget friendly and DELICIOUS! I honestly didn't realize there was a recipe for this, as we've been making it as a weekly staple in our household for so long! I stumbled onto this digging for more yummy lentil recipes, and couldn't pass up encouraging everyone to try it! This is pretty much how I make Mujadarrah, sometimes I toss in curry powder or coconut milk for added 'oomph'. SUCH an easy dish to make, the height of convenience food without the  ingredients! We'll definitely try a dash of cinnamon next time just for fun, I'm sure it'll fit in perfectly. Thanks for taking the time to share this, I hope everyone gives it a try!

Amazing. My husband gets suspicious when I make dishes that he either can't pronounce or that don't include meat, but he had to admit he loved this one!  I loved it, too.  I added 1 T. cumin and a veg. boillion cube to the water while cooking the lentils and used 4 onions.  I also just used a whole bag of brown lentils and just covered it with water.

Replaced rice with couscous. Added Garam Masala.  Fried onions with 2 chile peppers, nutmeg, and a pinch of cayenne.  Also added fried tempeh and toasted almonds in a soy sauce reduction.  Crossed cultural boundaries, did a little dance, and DELICIOUS!  Great base recipe, experiment with it yourself, see what you can make up!

Mmm! The yogurt & onion flavors are great.  I'm excited to try variations: garlic, cumin, added veggies, etc.  Maybe cooking the lentils & rice with tomatoes, or chicken stock, or...

We tried a version with garam masala that was pretty tasty.  Needed quite a bit of spice but still quite yummy.

I love this dish. Of course, I make it my own, I use chicken stock rather than H2O, added fresh ginger, cinnamon, cumin, and used organic, extra virgin coconut oil.  I even put in a little diced carrots the last time, sweet and tasty!  Thanks!

OK, but if I make it again, I will add lots more onion and some spices to give it some zing.  My husband like it with cornbread.

a strong 4.5, but I think I will raise it to a 5 once I really know what I am doing. I added a bit of cumin to the taste and will next time add a bit of cinnamon. Greek yogurt (Fage) would be great, as would a tomato/cucumber salad. This is heavy, though, good for a cold day when craving something like macaroni and cheese - but a lot healthier!

This turned out to be a realy good comfort food meal. Followed some of the reviewers ideas - doubled the onions, added 2tsp cumin to them and cooked in ghee and browned well. Also added a pinch of cinnamon and chilli powder to the rice and lentil mix and cooked it in a rice cooker. I added app. half a cup more of water than the rice and lentil mix. The result was really good. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night and cooked the onions darker than in the photo. At first it bothered me but my husband loved it (he's not big on curries so no cumin/curry/corriander).  It mellowed overnight and tasted great for lunch.  The recipe I used called for several Tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and plenty of pepper.  The lemon juice was an excellent add.

This was my first attempt at cooking lentils. I cooked the onions about 45 minutes in Sesame Oil and added curry to the lentils, as some previous reviews suggested. I will be making this again!

Definitely a 5 star.  I first tried Mujadarrah years ago at a Turkish restaurant and never tried to make it myself at home.  Now I don't need to go to a restaurant to satisfy my cravings for it.  Don't hold back on the onions.  You want to make sure the lentils and rice are seasoned enough.  I always use vidalia onions in my cooking and they work great with this because you don't get too much onion taste and they are even sweeter.

We felt it was bland and needed something else, I wish we had used some of the cumin as suggested.  The yogurt was better than sour cream we tried both ways.

Based on others' reviews, I didn't want to make this meal taste bland and therefore to review the recipe itself, I rated it with 4 stars. I went ahead and added some spices (put in when I added the rice) including 1 t of McKay's seasoning ("chicken bouillon), 1/2 t cumin and 1/2 t corriander. I also added dried garlic. I slow cooked the onion to brown (much longer than the 10 minutes the recipe calls for). 
I was surprised that my picky-food-eating husband absolutely loved it! That means this is a definite keeper! And guess what?! Because I am where I am, we don't always have yogurt or sour cream on-island, and the dish was tasty even with out it!
Next time, I will try adding a dash of cinnamon. And yes, knowing the amount of water to use would have been helpful.

I made this for the first time and my family loved it.  I used some tips from another recipe.  I rinsed the rice several times and then soaked it for 30 minutes before using it.  I also added one teaspoon of cummin  which I sauteed into the rice and lentils before adding the water. I also used some bullion in the water instead of the salt.  This is a great comfort food!

This was a little bland for my liking.  I completed the dish, tasted it, and decided to caramelize and add another onion and a bit of minced garlic, which helped.  All in all, just okay in my book.

Really good...I did caramelize the onions and add cumin and a little cinnamon.  I added the rice and continued to simmer 20 minutes, but that did not cook the rice.  I had to bring the whole mixture to a boil and then cover and simmer about 10 more minutes.  Even my 16 and 11 year olds liked it!!!

I am quite sure I must have done SOMETHING wrong, because I did not care for this.  I do not try a recipe unless I think the ingredients, etc., are what I would like.  I am sure I must have done something wrong, and part of it may have been the fact that I listened to other reviewers who said to carmelize the onions until very dark.  Yuck.  It added a burnt taste.  I will retry this recipe without caramelzing the onions so dark.  Otherwise, it was good.  I used garam masala because I felt it had the spices of the middle east.  It was good, in spite of the bad onions.  I also used sour cream but even that didn't counter the bad onions!  I guess I screwed up the onions!  I will try this again and adjust accordingly.  UPDATE:  I again made this last night and it was SO much better!  I didn't darken the onions that much.  I may add garlic to it next time.

I can't believe I'm giving a 5 star rating to a lentil dish, but it is THAT good.  I used red lentils instead of green but otherwise followed the recipe.  Used Greek plain yogurt, and although I think yogurt is best if you have it, sour cream would be a fine substitution.  I doubled the onions and fried until they were almost black.  They were sooooo good.

Loved this recipe. I added chopped garlic and it was delicious. Didn't use cinnamon or cumin and it was still  great.

I also thought this recipe was rather bland.  I even added some spices to doctor it up and it still tasted like boiled lentils with white rice.  It made a ton - unfortunately noone wants to eat the leftovers!

This recipe as written doesn't make sense to me.  Admittedly, this is a Middle Eastern dish, yet the only spices are salt and pepper.  When I hear Middle Eastern, I think corriander and cumin and garlic.  So I added 1/2t. of each and it really made such a difference.  Also, really get those onions carmelized.  The onions give the dish great depth of flavor.  This recipe also makes alot.

I agree with other readers and make sure you make a lot of extra onions for this dish! I added 2 large sweet onions and still think I should've used more. Once they're carmalized well, they really shrink down.  I too added cumin which brought this dish alive!  Hubby and I are lactose intolerant, so I skipped the yogurt, although I'm sure it would've been fantastic with it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was okay. It was a little dry for my taste but the onions had really good flavor and I liked the dollop of sour cream.

It was pretty good. I used many of the suggestions on the other reviews. I used more onions and sour cream. I also added additional spices. My lentils were a little underdone, next time I'll cook them longer.

Yum!  I think it could use more onion, though.  Also, I did cook my rice and lentils seperately.  My boyfriend, who is not a vegetarian (I am),  didn't care for this dish nearly as much as I did.

Very good - We cooked the rice separate, so had no problems with mushy lentils, etc.  We also added a curry powder mix, which really made the dish.  The yogurt seemed like a strange addition, but I can't imagine it without.  Also, we used cooking spray to cook the onions.  I can't imagine using that much oil!

Yummy! Nice flavor even though my rice did not cook in 20 minutes so we ended up eating mushy lentils and slightly underdone rice (oops).  Next time I might try cooking them separately and then mixing them.  I will also add more onions since they were so so good.  The yogurt was the perfect completion.  Served it with a simple salad of leaf lettuce, spinach, and carrots with the tangy lemon dressing (thank you Yvetteski)--a delicious and healthy meal!

Delicious!  I added lots of salt, pepper, cumin, and a touch of cinnamon.  I will definitely make again and maybe experiment a little more with the spices.  Next time, I will try using red onions too.

Added a can of diced tomatoes cause I didn't have any yogurt or sour cream on hand.  I would definitely double the onion next time.  I also added cumin, cinnamon, and some baharat seasonings.  I had to cook the rice about 25 minutes longer than it called for.  Maybe because it was brown rice?  Was delish though.

This was very good. I used vegetable oil (only ~2-3 T) yellow onions, and sour cream. This is a delicious and cheap recipe that is definitely going into rotation. Thanks!

Definitely use more onion.  If someone has exact water measurements that might be helpful because when I poured "enough water to cover the lentils," and brought it to a boil, all of it boiled away!  I adapted and it turned out great, it just wound up taking a longer time.  We'll make it again.
