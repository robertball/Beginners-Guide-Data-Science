OMG!!!  This was like dying and going to Heaven!!!  I used the whole package of Oreo Double Stuffs and processed the cookies until they were pretty fine.  To that I added a quarter cup of melted butter, holding back a quarter cup of the crumbs which I sprinkled on top after I drizzled it with caramel and chocolate syrup.  I brought it to work for a retirement party and the crowd went wild!!!

This was very good. My kids loved it. I made a couple of changes. I used the store bought Oreo pie crust. I only used 1/2 cup peanut butter. I didn't want the peanut butter to be too over powering. Then on the top of the pie, after I sprinkled the (Oreo) cookies on top.(I covered the top with Oreo cookie chunks.) I also drizzled it with chocolate syrup. It turned out better than I had thought it would. I will be making this again real soon. Thank you for the recipe.

I tried this recipe for both the ease of preparation and the sweet-sounding ingredients.  I wasn't disappointed on either account. It turned out wonderfully and my husband said he liked it "too much!"  Because there is no butter/baking to hold the Oreo crust together, it kindof crumbled when serving but I just gathered up the crumbs and scattered them on top of the dessert.  Sweet taste is the reason for eating a dessert!  Great recipe.

to answer someones question.  Confectioners sugar is powdered sugar, usually in a box rather than a 5lb bag.  Frozen whipped topping...a container of Cool Whip, thawed.
Made this recipe with my pre-k class, left out the PB b/c of allergies, and it was still wonderful!  My kids loooved it, especially b/c they did all the work!

Excellent dessert.  Everyone loved it.  I too did as others suggested; added 3 T of melted butter to the crust and then froze the crust before working on the peanut butter topping.  I only used 1-1/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar and that was the perfect amount.  Using the full 2 cups would have made it way too sweet.  This would have gotten 5 stars had I not had to make changes.   Everyone loved this!

This is really good but you must love peanut butter.  I cut the powder sugar in half, still very sweet.  The only problem I had was the crust just crumbled and had to be scooped out and sprinkled on top

This recipe is pretty awesome.  I absolutely adore the taste and it was easy to make; a real hit around my house.  The "crust" gave me real trouble though.  I used graham crackers the next time and it was a real improvement.  It's definitely worth a try though.

This recipe was fairly easy and turned out pretty tasty. I don't know if it's my kind of dessert, but if you like the flavor of cool whip, you'll probably like this dessert.

extremely tasty, plus easy to modify. first of all, i don't like baking. secondly, i am counting calories so i made a "lite" version: for the crust i ground in a coffee grinder 1 cup of kellogs bran flakes and 2/3 cups of whole grain cheerios; then added 3 tbsp of reduced calorie margarine and 2 tbsp of splenda-brown sugar blend. the crust spread like a charm :) for the filling, i only used half a cup of peanut butter, half a cup of splenda granulated, 1 tbsp of splenda-brown sugar blend, and non-fat greek yogurt instead of the frozen whipped topping. the mixing and spreading was a breeze! a little indulgence: i ground two girl guides (girl scouts) mint cookies in the coffee grinder and sprinkled on top.  i can see this one being a repeat dessert, whether as a "lite" or "regular" version.

Wow, didn't think it would be that good since it was so easy.  Very tasty!  The peanut butter and the sugar can be adjusted a bit to taste.

I made this for work and everyone wanted this recipe! I did limit the confectionery sugar in half as the others suggested and it was perfect! Thanks allrecipes for being able to convert into metrics. My daughter licked the bowl clean and always asks me to make it again…Thanks

Just finished making this yummy dessert. It's an easy to make, few ingredients kind of recipe! The only thing I had an issue with was with the beating of the cream cheese and sugar. Since I don't own a Red KitchenAid tilt-back electric mixer yet,(hint hint to  my husband) I had to use a spoon and boy did I get a work out! Think I should have nuked the cream cheese to soften it considerably, but over all the finished product looks mouth-watering! I also drizzled some chocolate syrup on top and crushed 2 oreos for decoration. This dessert is going to a family barbeque this evening! Enjoy!!

As if this wasn't sweet enough, I drizzled some chocolate sauce, which I made, over the top of it. Wow, this is so rich and wonderful - everyone in my family loved it, so I will be making it again.

This sounded delicious, but I was missing a lot of the ingredients, so I made the following substitutions: maple creme cookies instead of Oreos; vanilla pudding powder instead of the peanut butter and confectioner's sugar; whipping cream instead of the Cool Whip.  I also added caramel sauce to hold the cookie base together a bit better..... yum! The whole family enjoyed this variation.  I look forward to trying this recipe as written, too.  Play around with this recipe to your taste - I am sure you will enjoy it!

It is very good just the cookie crust falls apart, so add a bit of melted butter to correct this. Great  frozen dessert and delicious.

This is a delicious and easy recipe that you can make your own by using a number of variations of toppings to crust and/or fillings. Using oreo cookies for the crust, I omitted the peanut butter, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used 8 oz of cool whip instead of 12, and added 1 t vanilla to topping. Ideas: add 2 T cocoa to filling, serve with fresh or frozen strawberries, raspberries, or sliced bananas, top filling with any variations of ice cream toppings, pie fillings, candies, sprinkles, and nuts. The combinations are endless! The filling alone is delicious, so if you want to keep it simple, you won't be disappointed.  For a creamier consistency, refrigerate for at least 3 hours instead of freezing or thaw before serving. Great recipe to make and serve on a hot day! I am so happy to be adding this recipe to my collection! Thank you so much for sharing!

This looked good "on paper" but as I was making it I realized this was probably not for us.My thought on the crust ,since it was so crumbly was what if you used the double stuff cookies?maybe it would stick together better.

Maybe it's my ingredients. But my sugar cream cheese peanut butter mixture is powdered. I followed directions to a T.  Fresh ingredients purchased this afternoon. I thought it would be creamy like normal. Anyone know why. Or if it is supposed to be that way. I'm not finishing it. Looks weird.

I made this while trailering and it is a great, easy dessert.  It was quite rich so next time I think I will cut the icing sugar in half and mix some Cool Whip into the peanut butter mixture to make it lighter.

I made this just as the recipe is written. It was easy to make and was a hit at our church pot-luck. Very sweet!

I wanted a frozen no-bake dessert, because it's August and 105 degrees outside, and my family was getting tired of ice cream for dessert! After reading other reveiws, I added 3T melted butter to the oreo crust, I cut back the sugar to 1 2/3 c. I only used an 8oz. tub of Cool Whip because that's all I had, but it turned out great my husband loved it and my kids went back for seconds!! Thanks for the great no bake recipe!

I made this tonight when we had some guests over and it was a hit! After reading some of the reviews I put in just under the recommended amount for the peanut butter and sugar and it was excellent. The saltiness of the peanut butter cuts the sweetness nicely. This is my new go-to dessert recipe!

Really good. Made a couple changes, used only 1 c. of powdered sugar, made a crust out of the oreos (used the food processor..tooks seconds) using butter and few more oreos than called for. Sprinkled some more oreos on top. Great rich desert. Will use this for get togethers this summer.

I believe next time i will add a layer of ice cream to the bottom and put the crushed cookies on top of it.  The cookies do crumble at the bottom.  My husband and friends loved it the way it was written.

I have no words for this dessert.  It was fantastic!  I crumbled the entire package of cookies, poured melted butter over it, made a "crust" at the bottom of the pan.  It stuck together very nicely.

I just made this to bring to a friend's get-together and everyone LOVED it!   I used chunky peanut butter because it's all I had, and everyone really enjoyed it. it added a new texture to the dessert that they didn't expect. It was so easy, and so delicious!

I made this recipe as written and it was very rich.  You will need to keep it in the freezer: as it thaws, it seems to become even richer.  It was very easy to make and I will probably make again in a few months.

Easy and delicious recipe. I used reese's crushed on the bottom instead of cookies. and dressed the top up with some reeses peanut butter cups and swirled chocolate syrup. It looks like you spent forever making it but in reality you throw the ingredients together, and place it in the freezer.

I made this the first time a few weeks ago at my in-laws. It was such a hit, they asked me to make it for the family dinner on Mother’s Day!                                                      I doubled the cream cheese and whipped topping. Used 72 cookies. 60 crushed w/ just over 1/2 C of melted butter to aid in holding crust together. 12 of them separated to make 24 on top as decoration (filling was mixed in with others). 3/4 C peanut butter. 3 C confectioners sugar. Chocolate syrup drizzled on top before cookie half’s.

This is soooooo good!  It's very hot where we live so I was looking for a no bake recipe and found a hit. Followed the recipe except I used melted butter for the crust. Very fast easy and I didn't feel that it was to sweet just right. Everybody loved it.

Perfect 10. Add 3T of butter to Oreo crust to help it stick. Place in freezer 10-15 minutes before adding filling. No other adjustments needed. Will make again and again!

Father in law said it was one of the best desserts he ever had. I read many of the reviews and decided to make a few of the most popluar suggested adjustments. Added 3 tablespoons of butter to the crust and put it in the freezer for 15 minutes. Added a tablespoon of vanilla to the batter and used 1 cup of powdered sugar instead of 2. Added chocolate syrup over the top. Ending up looking just like the picture above. So easy and so good!!

Wow!!  This is SO good!  We needed something quick and easy....and this was it!  The bottom crust was too crumbly for my taste, so I'm going to either add a little bit of butter or cream cheese to the cookie crumbs so it will be more like a crust.  We kept it in the freezer so it was like an ice cream dessert.  I'm making it for the 4th of July get-together, and I don't plan on bringing home any left-overs!

This was so good and so easy! Used real whipped cream though. Also, I used generic brand "chocolate sandwich cookies". Will definitely use the real kind next time - I can taste the difference.

I take this to picnics, parties, etc. whenever I'm asked to bring something. Everyone LOVES it and I know the recipe by heart now because I've written it down for so many people. I prepare it in a 9x13 disposable aluminum pan so I don't have to worry about getting my pan back. I've actually seen people (adults!) using their fingers to get the last little bit out of the pan when it's gone!!

OMG!!! Super delicious!!  I made this for dessert for my ladies night this month and it was a big hit.  I did mix in 3tbsp of melted butter with the cookie crumbs so that the crust would stick together.  I kept it in the freezer overnight and only let it defrost for about 10 mins before eating so it was still a little frozen.  If you have ever had Byrne Dairy's Holy Cow ice cream....this dessert tastes just like that!!  YUM!!

This has quickly become a favorite quick dessert in our household. When I first made it, I missed the part where it needed to freeze for 1-2 hours. I just put it into the refrigerator first. And you know what? It was still perfect! I've made it several times since then and usually skip the freezing part and just let it sit in the fridge.

Made this recipe when I was having a gang over and it was awesome.  I was in a bit of a rush so I purchased 2 premade oreo crumb pie crusts and filled them with the whipped topping mixture.  I also drizzled chocolate sauce over the top of the pie before adding the decrotive crumbs.  Yummy!!

This was a huge crowd pleaser.  I already had everything but the cool whip and it took just a few minutes to make.  I didn't freeze it..just put it in the fridge for several hours and it was a nice consistency.  Will make this one again.

I brought this to our July 4th family gathering. It is very good but extremely rich! After about the 3rd or 4th bite it gets really sweet. I had to keep telling people not to cut too big a piece because it is so rich. Still, if you like peanut butter and chocolate, this is for you!

This was a great easy to make dessert!  I only made one change as suggested by another reviewer.  I poured a little melted butter over the crushed cookie so it would stick together better.  It is a sweet dessert, but very very good.  It was gone in about 5 minutes!

I made this recipe exactly like it is originally written except I used choclate stuffed cookies instead. It was gobbled up by my oh-so-picky family very quickly. It was a hit. Thanks for the recipe.

This was truly easy to make. It is very rich. The peanut butter was over powering for me. It was the dominate taste in the dessert. I would not make this again.

Very tasty. I used only 1 cup of confectionery sugar and it was plenty sweet. Used a springform pan and it worked very well. We took the side piece off and that left a round pie that was super easy to cut and serve. Will definitely make it again.

This dessert was a big hit at my family reunion. My husband insisted I make another one for to keep for ourselves. I will definitely be making it again! I made no changes at all, except that instead of trying to serve it in neat squares, it was easier to just scoop it. Not having to use the oven is a huge bonus too.

Not sure how the cookie crumble base is supposed to hold together. Had to spread the topping carefully  since the cookie crumbs were sticking to it.  I thought it would hold better after being  in the freezer for a few hours.....wrong! When I went to serve it the cookie crumbs had not held together as a base so it was mostly topping with some cookie crumbs on the bottom.  All the cookie crumbs stayed in the pan.The topping tasted great but the cookie crumbs base was a fail.

This dessert was a hit for my co-workers birthday.  I made the crust with mint oreo cookies and added the melted butter to hold it together.  Instead of the peanut butter and icing sugar I used chocolate pudding and a little mint extract.  I crushed up some oreo mint cookies in the pudding , cool whip  and cream cheese layer.   I topped it off with some oreo mint balls and cool whip!!

I have made this a couple times now. Always made it as written. Well maybe a few more cookies on the bottom, but it was a hit from the first time!  I was asked for the recipe immediately after tasting it and asked to bring it again to the next holiday gathering. I topped it with swirls of chocolate and caramel sauce to decorate

Like other reviewers, we cut the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and confectioners sugar to 1-1/2 cup.  Also drizzled chocolate syrup on top.  Very easy, delicious dessert!

Made this last night. Very very rich. And very very sweet.  I used peanut butter stuffed Oreo cookies. I also sprinkled Reese's Peanut butter cup chopped) on top. As well as cookie crumbles. If you like over the top sweet this is for you.

I made it for a cocktail party and it got devoured in minutes.  I decreased the sugar to 1 cup per the reco from other reviewers.  I used less cool whip only because it came in either 8 oz or a much bigger size.  I shredded the Oreos in a food processor, added melted butter and put it in the fridge while mixing other ingredients.  This made the crust stick together very well.  Will make again for sure.  I also gave out the recipe to others per their request.

This was delicious. Made two. One for home and one for a meeting. This dessert is better the next day. All the ingredients meld together. I did add butter to the crust like some of the other comments suggested.

This was a big hit at a dinner party.  Took others suggestions and cut the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and the powdered sugar to 1 1/4 cup.  I like to "lighten up" recipes, so I used neuchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese.  I also added butter to the crushed cookies for the crust, and used Land of Lakes light butter for that--I needed 3 Tablespoons.  I froze the crust before adding filling--someone else's suggestion.  So of course the filling was Lite Cool Whip instead of regular.  I also found that I used more cookies than was called for--- I think 27 instead of 20, but maybe I need to work on my cookie crust-packing skills!

This was... okay.  The people for whom I made it are peanut butter buffs and I thought this would be a hit.  It lacked personality.  We didn't throw it out, in fact, most people had seconds, but I won't be rushing to make it again.  It lacked "wow" factor for me.

I have made this dessert at least 10 times, and have NEVER EVEN GOTTEN A TASTE!  It is gone before I get there in line. And I've had several people ask if they could lick the pan (true sign that it was a hit!).  Can't go wrong with this BEST and EASIEST dessert!

I made it exactly as written. It's yummy but next time I will decrease the powdered sugar a little (way too sweet) and decrease the peanut butter amount. I think after doing that it will be a keeper and worth 5 stars.

This was decent but I thought there were way too many flavors going on to really "work". It's not a cheap recipe to make and I've had better with the focus on either peanut butter or oreos or cheesecake, not all three. Thank you for sharing though, we enjoyed trying it :)

Big hit! I made a change though. Instead of just using crushed cookies for the bottom, I made a typical cookie bottom using ground (using my food processor) cookies and melted butter. I had to use about 30 chocolate cookies (without cream) and then I eye-balled the butter, I would guess I used about 2-4 Tbls. I found that the bottom stood up pretty well to the peanut butter layer, which I noticed was kind of a problem for some of the other reviewers. I only needed about 6 chocolate cookies (with cream) for the topping, but I was also adding a couple chopped peanut butter cups to the top as well. If you're looking for a dessert to whip up in less then an hour, this is it!

I made this exactly as directed, but found that I need twice as many cookies to cover the bottom of the 13x9 pan, and it still ended up to be just coarse crumbs, not a crust.  I'm not sure if I understood the directions, but it was hard to make crumbs out of filled cookies.  The filling was incredible!!  It was so thin, though that I added a chocolate pudding layer and it got inhaled right away.  It seems that the directions are actually for an 8x8 pan instead.

I read the recipe and knew right off the bat it would be too sweet for my taste, but it became a great launching pad for a Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Pie!
Instead of making a crust, I used a ready-made chocolate pie crust.  I also cut the amount of powdered sugar by half and folded bananas into the peanut butter cream cheese base. I drizzled a chocolate glaze on top and wella, chocolate peanut butter banana deliciousness!

Great dessert. I mixed the cookies, cream cheese and sugar all together instead of spreading it over the oreos, I added some strawberry oreos and it made it even better. I didnt use the peanutbutter but i added caremel syrup and chocolate syrup on top of the cool whip. Delicious!!

This is a great recipe and is just what I was looking for on a hot day!  I used oreo cookies and Cool Whip and was happy with the simple ingredients.  I only added 2/3 of a cup of sugar and 1/2 a cup of peanut butter and it was perfect!  Instead of fussing with a crust I just prepared each serving in a small dessert dish, which was simple and made for a great appearance when serving to guests!

The flavor combination of peanut butter and chocolate is fantastic but this is too sweet as is for me.  I will reduce the amount of sugar next time because the cookie crust is sweet enough on its own.  I also added melted butter to the cookie crumbs but the crust still fell apart.  I will make this again because it tastes great and is easy but use less sugar next time.

This was very good although I will be using the suggestion of adding some melted butter to the Oreo crumbs to keep the crust from being so crumbly. I didn't add any peanut butter to my filling I just added about a 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. It was delicious!

Although it went fast at the party, I am giving it four stars because I had to change the recipe.  Unless you don't mind having your teeth fall out from the sugar content, I would recommend you lower the amount of sugar.  You can add it in increments until you find what works for you (since you don't have to bake it, this part is easy).  I changed it to five tablespoons.  To me, that was perfect.  Oh, yeah, and I added chocolate syrup and dulce de leche swirls on top.

I loved this recipe the hardest part was trying to spread mixture out on oreo's, but that turned out ok.  I did add a few more oreos then what it called for, but too many is never enough.

Good, but would be better if it had more of a crust of cookies than simply crumbled up cookies

Awesome dessert, I have requests to make it again and again.  Very light, not heavy even though it sounds like it is.  I added extra cookies on the bottom and top to give it a little more crunch.

I had a bbq that I needed a quick dessert for.  Well I found it!  This was absolutely out of this world!!  I didn't have any whole oreo cookies, so I just used the oreo crumbs and butter to form the crust on the bottom.  I was a little concerned because I only had light cream cheese, and light PB But it didn't matter it held up great. I told everyone it was a 'light' dessert! I should have made 2 because everyone wanted seconds!   I cant wait to make this again.

I have been on a peanut butter kick lately and this sure hit the spot. I tried this recipe because there was no baking of the crust involved. The crust does crumble but it is still very delicious. I have to agree that you don't really taste the cream cheese in this freezer pie, but that's just fine by me since I was wanting a strong peanut butter taste. Very creamy, smooth, delicious and addicting! Thanks for sharing.

It is Very Tasty, and Very Easy. I am not a huge sweet's person so I doubled the cream cheese (I also used 1/2 fat cream cheese because that's what I keep on hand) and left everything else the same. This way I had enough filling for a pie and to freeze for a later date. My Husband and daughter absolutely LOVE it. Good recipe Mrs. Alfred ;-D

It was very good.  Next time I might add a bit more peanut butter though for a stronger flavour.  It was good the way the recipe is wrote, but I think it would be even better with more peanut butter.

Very good flavor but like others, I had trouble getting crust to stay in place when I spread the topping, so I, too, will now add some melted butter to the crust mix.

This was simple (though very messy) and very very good. I had my doubts, but it came out wonderfully (used extra oreos, though) and it's good even after a few days when the oreos are softer.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and loved the ease of preparation. I took it to a party and got many compliments and several asked for the recipe.  I made it again today for a potluck with the same results.

I didnt't have a 9x13 pan so iput it into two serving bowls and used just enough melted butter so the crumbs would stay on the sides of the bowl so i could put the filling in.  It was great.  Mine turned out more like a pie, but it didn't last long!!!  Wonderful combination of ingredients

Alright, This recipe was grrrreat! Very quick to mix and extremly simple! I made it for my family last night and it lasted less than 15 mins =) Perfect for Peanut butter lovers...like me!

I did change the recipe alittle bit. I added about 1/8 (or alittle more) of a cup of cream cheese to the cookie crust  (I was gonna use butter but, found out we didn't have enough) i increased the peanut butter to almost a cup, I only ended up using 1 1/2 cups of sugar (After reading reviews saying it was alittle to sweet)and I only used 8oz of whipped topping instead of 12. 

This recipe is definitly going in my recipe box. I'll be making it again for sure!!!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect.  To make the cream cheese soft, I microwaved it on half power for 1 minute and it was perfect.  Delicious!

Wow- this was good and very rich!  And I even cut back the sugar by half...  I love dessert and a small piece was enough for me, so this actually lasted a few days at our house.

After reading the reviews I strayed a little far from the recipe.  I only used one cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and added 1/2 a package of cream cheese.  I then only folded in 1/2 of the whip cream and used the rest as the top layer.  Turned out very well!

If your family loves peanut butter - as mine does - this is the dessert for you!  Took this to a weekend get together and was asked for the recipe by everyone there!

It was very easy to make so I loved that part. You have to be a peanut butter lover to really fall in love with it. The adults thought it was too sweet but the kids loved it. I thought it was god but I wouldn't rush to make it for every dinner party.
