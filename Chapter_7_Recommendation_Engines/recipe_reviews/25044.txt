These are the best chocolate chip cookies ever!  They are crunchy and delicious.  I use 3 tsp of baking soda and only 1 egg.  Also, you can use regular corn flakes (instead of sweetened) and quick oats.  Nuts are optional.

AWESOME! I have very high standards for Chocolate Chip Cookies (they're my fav, of course). I really like crunchy cookies too, and these are amazing. REALLY.

I will be keeping this recipe everybody in the family liked them. The only thing I changed was I used milk chocolate chips in place of the semi-sweet chocolate chips. =) =) =)

These are delicious!!  Had some golden graham cereal on hand, so crushed it up in place of the corn flakes.  They are beautiful!  DH says they are "much better than the regular CC cookie".  I guess it's a winner!!

I don't know what happened to my batter, but it was runny.  I put it in the refrigerator in hopes that it would set up but all of the cookies still spread out to about 1/8" thick (except for where the chocolate chips were).  So, the end product was very thin.  Texture-wise, they melted in one's mouth, which was good, but probably due to the amount of fat in them.  Flavor-wise, they were pretty good.  I wasn't exactly sold on the crunchy element to them.  It was different and interesting, but not enough to carry the other downsides.  Thank you for letting us try these, though!

Delicious recipe, but I think the amount of vegetable oil is overstated. The mixture prior to cooking was very greasy and hard to work with. Also, I don't recommend quick oats rather than rolled oats as previous reviewer did.

These Are Dangerously Addicting!! Sooooo Good!!! I was craving cookies tonight and wanted to try something a little different then my usual chocolate chip cookie recipe! I did have to tweak this recipe due to what I had on hand but I dont think it would change my rating Im sure they are even better made as written. I added rice crispies instead of oat's about 1.5 cups and added 1 cup crushed oreos! To Die For!!!

I cut back on the oil to 1/3cp and used coconut oil instead of vegetable(only because that's what I always do). Added a tsp of baking soda as well and used unsweetened corn flakes instead of frosted.

These weren't bad, but the frosted flakes gave them an odd texture. Four stars.

Love this recipe.  I made a few adjustments.  Cherry chips instead of chocolate, butter flavored shortening and crushed graham crackers instead of the cereal. Really yummy!

Made these for a family event and everyone loved them! The only modifications were I used Smart Start cereal and 1/4 cup less oil.  They are fabulous if you like a crunchier cookie!

I'm going to keep this recipe, because they are crispy. I did make changes, I used 4 cups of flour, and I'm planning  to reduce the amount of oil next time,  because they were very oily.   I'll keep this recipe

It is so delicious and easy to make!  I didn't have chocolate chips so I melted chocolate on top of the cookies after it cooled down...but it was very nice without the chocolate as well.
