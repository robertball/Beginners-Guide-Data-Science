My family loved this pineapple.  I used canned pineapple slices and substituted 1 teaspoon of Mexican vanilla for the brandy.  It was great with grilled chicken and grilled corn on the cob.  My son and I forked for the last slice.   Will definitely grill again.

There's nothing quite like grilled pineapple and this was no exception! I didn't have cherry brandy on hand, so I subbed some Jack Daniel's Honey Whiskey instead.  Instead of cutting it into rings I cut the pineapple into four sections and let it marinate for a few hours.  I skewered it and topped it with a little turbinado sugar before grilling. This was fabulous with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - a very nice treat and a great way to end a meal!

Very good- I didn't have cherry brandy so I used dark rum and marinated the mix for about 3 hours. I didn't have ice cream either so I mixed some light sour cream, honey, cinnamon, and a little vanilla to make a dipping sauce. Great way to liven up a tateless pineapple!

i made more marinade so it would really soak in the flavor.  And we served it with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

This was amazing. I used Captain Morgan's special stock rum instead of cherry brandy because I didn't have any in the house. Also used Greek honey. The two complimented each other very nicely. This is a wonderful side dish/dessert.

This was pretty good. I did not have any cherry brandy so I merged both recommendations and replaced it with 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 cherry juice. I think next time I will just grill the pineapple next time since it tastes just as good.

7-10-11:  This was OK, but Ann didn't eat much because the pineapple was reacting badly.  Did it in the broiler, not the grill, and used vanilla extract for the brandy.

I've tried grilled pineapple before and really liked it, but this time I'm not sure if I like it as much.  I'm not sure if I had my grill too hot, but the pineapple came out with too much of a smokey flavor that I did not like.

To die for!  Grilling the pineapple slices so they have a bit of char on them gives them a flavor that is just outstanding.

This was really good.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the marinade for a little spice.  Grills best at dessert time when the coals are just starting to cool, otherwise the strips where the pineapple touches the grill will be black and burnt before the rest of the pineapple is tender.
