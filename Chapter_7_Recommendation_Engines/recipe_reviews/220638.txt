I left out the mushrooms, leeks, chilis, and artichokes. I had to reduce the potato, carrot and celery to one each due to the size of my crock pot.

Really easy and good recipe. I did omit the mushrooms and leeks. It is a bit on the spicy side and my kids did not like only for that reason. Next time I will not add the green chilis and chili powder. Would recommend to anyone!

Quite good with some modifications, mostly because of what I had on hand.  Ingredient changes were: 1.5# sliced ham, fresh mushrooms, a slightly larger can of green chilies, 3 carrots, 2T Italian Herb seasoning (in place of fresh rosemary, parsley & thyme), 1t Old Bay w/ Blackened Seasoning (in place of Creole), 1T Morton Nature's Seasons blend (in place of white pepper, black pepper, and salt), port instead of dry red wine & omitted black beans, corn, brown sugar & cayenne.  In Step 1, I sauteed leek and garlic with the ham to develop more flavor.  I'm guessing the 'water to cover' for me was ~2C.  The house smelled great while the slow cooker did its magic.  The end result was a hearty & savory dish that has some zing (from the artichokes and chilies, I guess) so its neither sweet nor too spicy.  Great for winter lunches and suppers!

This was an interesting recipe. I had to leave out the potatoes and mushrooms due to my husband's preference and the rest of the ingredients filled my crock pot to the top! (I have a 6 qt one) so be careful if you prep ahead of time. I also left out the brown sugar because of dietary restrictions and it tasted fine to me, with the natural sweetness of the ingredients. The ham makes it salty so I probably could have cut the salt or left it out altogether. Overall something different for the crock pot and I would probably make this again... maybe using chicken instead of ham. Thanks!

If you follow the recipe, what you get is a sickeningly sweet and excessively spicy mess--and lots of it. I left out the green chilis and it was still overly spicy.

I can't see myself repeating this one.
