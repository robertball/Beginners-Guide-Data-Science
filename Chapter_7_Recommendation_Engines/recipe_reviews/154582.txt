After making this numerous times more, I realized that it holds together a little better if you put the cheese on top of the meat and then top all of that with the cornbread mixture.

The reason I am giving this a 3 is because it had a funny texture.  The bottom meat part was crumbly, nothing held it together.  You need to add probably 3/4 c. ketchup to the meat, or add cheese.  Instead of covering the top of the cornbread part with the shredded cheddar, next time I will probably add the cheese into the meat mixture.  We doused ours in ketchup to eat it.  I will try again, because the flavor was really good (I doubled the onion and salt).

This recipe was awesome!  I only made one change (well, besides following the instructions from the other comments about putting the cheese directly on top of the ground beef), I used green chiles instead of jalapenos - wasn't quite as spicy as it could have been.  We served it with sour cream - I think we'll add a bed of lettuce next time.  I'm also wondering if I reduce the amount of ground beef and substitute some refried beans, if the flavor would change drastically or if it would just help hold the bottom together a little more.  My daughter wasn't crazy about the corn bread part (but she's not a bread eater) but loved the meat.  Oh, and, instead of using a boxed mix of corn bread, I mixed up 1/2 of a batch of "Homesteader Cornbread" (it's another favorite recipe of ours from allrecipes) and poured that on top - absolutely delish!!  Thank you for your wonderful creation!

My family and I loved this.  The bottom of mine was not crumbly, the corn bread mix was thin enough that is went down into the meat.  So it was perfect!  I cooked this for the first time last week and we are having it again tonight.

Easy to make and it tastes good. I added the cheese before the corn mix and forked down a bit once I poured the cornbread mixture on and it all stuck together once baked. I thought the spice was very balanced. Leftovers were good too. Thanks for a great recipe :)

Really good! Mine turned out a little dry but I think that is because I used Veal instead of Beef and there isn't as much fat.

Very dry! Meat was crumbly & didn't hold to the top crust. Good flavor, but not very good texture!!

This has become one of our favorite house hold meals.  I even have co-workers asking me for this recipe when I am eating my leftovers at work, just because it looks and smells so good.  The catchy name helps too, I think!!  A+

Wonderfully satisfying and delicious.  Following the lead of other reviewers basically doubled the seasonings, mixed half the cheese in with the fried meat, used 1 cup of left over buttermilk in the cornbread to make it thinner so it would hold the meat together better.  What this dish lacks in eye appeal (meat still fell apart somewhat) it easily makes up for in deliciousness.  Great Flavor combination!

Made recipe just as stated.  I think it too dry although it had a good flavor.  I wonder if you added a little cream soup to the meat I wonder if that would work.  Might try again with that, but not as written.

It was easy to make and it tased fine but I agree it was crumbly on the bottom. I did put the cheese over the meat like some suggested.  I think the meat was too dry and needed some liquid. Maybe either adding a can of rotel or just mixing the meat and cornbread together might have made a difference. Definitely can be tweaked.

I'm giving this 5 stars for the basic concept though I made some changes: 2 1/2 times the spices, half beef and half pork, 7oz can mild green chilis (liquid included) instead of jalapenos, one cup chopped onion, used about 2 1/2 cups cheese and spread it on top of meat, doubled butter and used one cup milk in corn muffin batter. This is a version of a tamale pie recipe I used to make with corn and chopped tomatoes added. This more basic recipe is tasty but needs to be served with some extras - sour cream, salsa, guacamole or avacado, and of course chopped jalapenos or other chilis if you want the heat. You can also scoop it all up with corn chips or fritos.

This is a really good recipe! I was looking for something new to make from ground beef and decided to try this. I read other reviews and put some cheese on the meat layer before pouring the cornbread mixture over it and it held together a little better. I used Jiffy cornbread mix and added a tbsp of sugar to it since my hubby prefers sweet cornbread. I will make this again and again!

One of the easiest casseroles ever. I added a few more jalapenos and wow was it spicy. But very very good!
