tastes great! the only thing I would change is use only 1 cup breadcrumbs and just be careful when you cut the zucchini make sure the ends stay intact so the egg mixture doesnt flow out.

I made this dish wish smaller zucchinis, so I put the chard in the squash and put the quiche mainly around the zucchinis in the baking dish. I also left out the mozzerella and replace tarragon with thyme, based on what I had on hand. It was delicious, easy, quick, and very creative!

This was delicious, but I made it in a regular crust and added some roasted red pepper.  Yum!
