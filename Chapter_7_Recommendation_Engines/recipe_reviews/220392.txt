This is almost the same thing my mother has used for years.She never used the mustard or onion. I can't wait to try it again with the onion and mustard.
I have used some red pepper flakes for a bit of kick once in a while.

Made this for the first time. The family loved it and I will make it again.  It was easy to do and had a good flavor.  I used boneless skinless thighs and forgot the onion and it still tasted good.  I'll try to follow recipe exactly next time.

Was not our favorite, too sweet.  My kids did not like it.
