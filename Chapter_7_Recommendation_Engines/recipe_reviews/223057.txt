I really liked these. I cooked the pork in a pressure cooker for 50 minutes instead of using the oven. I also didn't have any chicken broth for the spinach, so I used a splash of white wine instead. Oh, and I just sliced the cheese instead of grating it. Really nice flavors.

I like this sandwich with the pork, spinach and the manchego cheese is so different and a nice change of pace. I did reduce the rosemary to just 1 tbsp - I think 3 tbsps is quite a lot - rosemary is very strong. I think if I made this again I would replace the rosemary with thyme. I did not care for the red pepper flakes in the spinach. Next time I would cook the spinach in the olive oil with the garlic. I would leave out the red pepper and the chicken broth. Thanks for a great new sandwich idea.

Delicious! The pork roast was cooked to perfection and the seasonings were spot on. Loved the spinach! I used sharp provolone b/c I couldn't find Manchego. I will be making this again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Oh wow. These were so much better than I thought they would be. I didn't change a thing, and I wouldn't. This was amazing.

Followed the recipe to the T and it wasn't near as good as I was expecting!
