A nice change of pace, and it comes together quickly too!  The flavor is nice, however I wouldn't call this a COCONUT curry soup...where's the coconut? (a tiny bit of coconut oil certainly isn't enough to flavor the soup)  Instead of adding water, I would add coconut milk next time. I used the juice of only 1/2 a lime, because I found that to be tart enough. I also used 1 tbsp lemongrass paste instead of a stalk, since I had some on hand. Consider adding the snow peas, zucchini and scallions in the final minute as to not overcook the veggies (and discolor the snow peas).  I didn't have any leftover chicken to toss in, but next time I will add some, or even some shrimp! Thanks for the tasty recipe!

So good!  I shared the recipe with all my friends! No changes were necessary. I topped my bowl with some scirracha for kick. You could definitely add any kind of meat. I’m thinking shrimp next time.
My husband put a little Soy sauce in his bowl. I didn’t use coconut oil, just olive oil but I wonder if sesame oil would add more Asian flare.
