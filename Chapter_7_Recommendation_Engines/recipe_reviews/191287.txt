This is it!  The perfect jerky recipe I've been searching for!  I've been making jerky for years.  Tried other recipes and tried to make my own. The hot sauce I used was my own that I made from my peppers this summer.  The really nice thing for me was that the ingredients are ones that I usually have on hand.  I gave this out as part of my Christmas packages.  Everyone loved it and I'm now going to make more for New Year's.  Thanks!

This is the first time I have ever made beef jerky.  I think I maybe could have left this in the oven for an hour or so longer.  It is a little heavy on the Worcestershire sauce in my opinion so I think next time I might cut that in half.  Here is a tip.  I had the butcher at the market slice the meat from a roast.  Made it super easy for me to throw it in a bag and marinate it over night.  I did take a couple of the strips of meat and added red pepper flakes to them for a little zip- they were tasty.

Finally a recipe without sugar.  Don't know why anyone would add sugar or honey to beef jerky, but all the recipes we read call for it.  This is just what we were looking for.
