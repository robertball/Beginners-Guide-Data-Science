Very nice - this turned out quite delicious. I think the recipe has mistake, though, since 1/4 cup of baking powder is a LOT!! I used only 1 tsp. I also accidentally used too little of the cream cheese and the dough felt like it needed more stickiness - either more cream cheese or an egg. Also, didn't have the plum butter so I used home made pear-sauce (like apple sauce). It was a lot of work - rolling it up is not easy and in the future, I would use baking paper underneath to help support it. All and all, though, lot of fun and a good recipe. Thanks!

We like to try German recipes and enjoyed this one.  A few thoughts about it: 1) I figured that the typo for 1/4 cup baking powder probably meant 1/4 tsp. 2) Next time I would beat the cream cheese with the sugar and cinnamon before adding the oil and milk to get a smoother mixture.  3)  I was trying to be authentic to this German recipe and searched for plum butter, but could not find it.  I used a 9 oz jar of organic plum fruit spread from Italy--next time I would use a more economical choice like a common jam or even apple jelly.  The plum spread kind of disappeared among all the diced plums anyway.  4)  Since I don't have much experience cooking with plums, I peel them as I would if cooking with pears or apples...I'm not sure if this is necessary.  5)  Usually I don't add extra sweetness or a glaze to recipes, but I felt that a glaze made these rustic rolls much more attractive and added a tiny bit of sweetness just on the outside.  6)  This needed to bake much longer...about 75 minutes total.  7)  The dough was not very tender even though I did not overwork it.  I would not add the full 4 cups of flour right away next time.  Another reviewer thought adding an egg would help make the dough stickier and that may also help tenderize and rise the dough.

Delicious! Didn't have plum butter, so used peach butter (any complementary jam will do). 1/2'ed the recipe and only used 1/4 t baking soda. Baked them in a round cake pan. They are perfect with tea- not too sweet.
