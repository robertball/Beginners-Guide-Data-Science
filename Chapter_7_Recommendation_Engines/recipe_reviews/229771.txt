These made great holiday treat bags.  I made sure I saved enough for us to enjoy too.  I made the recipe exactly as written and thought it was perfect.

Oh, mo, goodness!! These are delicious! I used 1/2 almonds and 1/2 pecans, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I am supposed to take them to a party tonight, I hope there are some left. I can't stay out of them!

these were awesome!  I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 cup brown and 1/4 cup white, and I found them to be plenty sweet.  Even my toddler loved them!  Very easy and tasty

These are yummy!! I have only ever used cashews, not almonds but i am sure you could use any kind of nut. It is a great way to use up leftover eggwhites after making custard :-)They go deliciously crunchy, with just a touch of cinnamon flavour. I usually whisk all ingredients except the nuts together in a large bowl then add the nuts last and mix the coating through. Highly recommended, would make a great gift, i haven't actually given any away yet, coz i'm too selfish, i want to keep them all for myself.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and they turned out amazing!!  I had to bring half of them in to work so I wouldn't eat the whole batch, just most of it!  My son loves getting these at the ball park or mall.  He was a fan, especially when they came out of the oven.  This will be a regular treat for us!

I made a similar recipe a few weeks ago in a crock pot, and the flavor was good but the coating texture was not great.  Loved this recipe! The flavor is perfect and the low and slow baking time with minimal "babysitting" to stir created almonds that easily separated (what didn't happen in the crockpot).  I used a silpat on my baking sheet and was glad because the sugary crumbs that baked on came off easily.  I recommend this or parchment, or if you don't have either, let your baking sheet sit in water for awhile to dissolve the sugar, saving lots of dishwashing work.  My husband loves this recipe - even my "I hate almonds" 9 year old daughter can't keep her hand out of the container!  These are great warm - and seem to be getting better as they cool.  I totally recommend this recipe - simple enough for a novice cook!

I made this exactly to recipe other than that I only had Mexican vanilla in the house. I made three batches total. The first batch was very good but I was lacking enough cinnamon flavoring for my liking so the next two batches I used a generous tablespoon of cinnamon and a tad more salt. I suggest to take a pinch of the sugar mixture before you put it on the almonds and adjust to your personal liking.  It’s hard to leave them alone while roasting them.  I used a flat cast iron griddle, it worked great but I would spray it next time even though I used parchment. I had too many almonds for my pan so I struggled when stirring.  I recommend a full size cookie sheet. I found a 25 ounce bag of raw natural almonds at Walmart for $10 and used one bag per batch. I recommend a full size cookie sheet.  I can’t help but wonder if it would be easier to cover the original cookie sheet with another cookie sheet and flip it upside down rather than stirring. I’m keeping the crumbs for my toast in the morning or oatmeal. Enjoy!

Definitely take the advice and double the coating.  Myself, the next time i make it i will also double (quadruple) the cinnamon. All said and done, they might not be gorgeous, but they're delicious.

I made the glaze exactly as described but put it on pecans (because that’s what I had on hand). It was fantastic. Best candied nut recipe I’ve ever made. That tiny bit of salt really enhances the sweetness!

I just made a batch of these.  I used pecans rather than almonds and cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  They took an hour and 45 minutes to dry out completely and they are delicious!  So easy to make too.  The perfect homemade gift for my co-workers.

good stuff! kitchen smells great! just made a batch and they turned out great! followed the suggestion to cut the white sugar down to 1/4 cup and probably will go up to 1/2 cup for next batch :o) definitely use parchment paper other wise your gonna waste a ton of time to clean up the pan/sheet. thanx for helping make raw/unsalted almonds delicious:o)

I used my hand mixer to really whip the egg whites and vanilla. Then did all the rest of the recipe as directed. I didn't want to heat my kitchen so I cooked them at 200 degrees for the recommended time on my grill!  Wow! These are wonderful and my friends and family love them! Thanks for the great recipe.

Loved this recipe!  I did however cup back on the sugar.  I only used 1/2 cup of the white sugar and the full cup of the brown sugar.  I also used both almonds and pecans.

Next time I'll either use 6 cups of nuts or cut back some on the brown sugar.  

However, with that this recipes rocks!

I am a clutz , but this went together easily. I put it all on one pan, would use 2 next time because I knocked so many out of the pan while trying to stir them. They are VERY GOOD.

Best recipe!! No changes necessary, it’s right on. I do prefer using roasted sea-salted almonds rather than natural because it gives a more complex flavor. I omit the salt in the recipe when I do this. This is a favorite treat at the holidays!!

Made recipe as stated except I only had salted almonds.  So I left the salt out.  Turned out perfect and they taste just like the ones you get at the county fair.

Made recipe as written and it was awesome! Everyone I shared them with said they were delicious. Tasted just like the ones they used to have at the mall at Christmas time.  And my house smelled delicious!

Amazing!  I followed exactly.  And it’s perfect.  I added a hint of allspice just for a holiday aroma and its phenomenal!

I doubled the egg white mixture and only used brown sugar. Omitted the white sugar as we don't like things too sweet. Made two batches and this recipe was completely devoured in a few days.  Also, is great for gifting in small mason jars with ribbon.

Wow! These are delicious, and so easy to make. I added a little more salt, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. You definitely should line your cookie sheet, the largest one you have, with parchment paper, because they do stick. It took the full hour and 15 minutes for the nuts to get dry enough to remove them from the oven and start the cooling process. I will be making these again. Now I need to find a recipe for a spicy, non-sweet version of these.

I made these yesterday, and they are yummy!    If will probably make them again, and when I do, I will add a little more cinnamon and also a little more salt, to suite my taste.

Great recipe!  I used the same recipe for cashews,  and they were amazing.  Everyone asked for more.  Cashews take a bit longer to crisp up, though.  It was more like 90 minutes, and I stirred every 10 minutes.

What an easy recipe to follow and a fabulous outcome. We ended up making enough for us and to give to our neighbors for a homemade holiday gift.
Will definitely make again.

These turned out great!  I had just tried another recipe that was a huge flop and so figured I would give it one more chance for cinnamon almonds and I'm glad I did!  Super easy and everyone loved them
