I really liked this soup but I made some changes. Being from TX I thought the mixed vegetables sounded kind of funny so I added a can of kidney beans and a can of corn kernels instead. I also added quite a bit more chili pepper and and a little cumin.

Great soup! I didn't have any tortillas but I'll be sure to have some around next time I make this! I also added 1/2 tsp ground cumin, use red and green bell peppers and an additional cup of chicken broth.  Besides having tortillas on hand next time, I think I add some noodles in place of the mixed veggies because it was "differnt" to have carrots, beans and chopped broccoli with this mexican flair but overall, we are are please with the result of this soup.  Thanks Corwynn!

Everyone in my family liked this recipe, and that's saying something!  I did have to make a few substitutions and changes.  I added a package of ramen noodles (saw that someone added extra veggies) to take up some of the liquid.  We didn't have corn tortillas, but I used flour.  We broke them into smaller pieces to put into the soup.  They really made a huge difference!  It was like adding crackers and having them stay crunchy.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is an excellent soup.  My whole family loved it.  They especially liked the fried tortillas on top of the soup.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Also instead of 2 cups of frozen vegetables, I used 3.

This was an easy soup, however I ended up adding much more seasoning to it, it was a bit bland for our taste as is. Try adding, cumin, corriander and a bit more chili powder, once we did this and topped it with tortilla chips it was super.

Pretty good soup.  Except for adding more frozen vegetables, I made it exactly as the directions advised.  We did find the flavor to be a bit bland; next time I will add salt & pepper as the soup cooks, and perhaps some cumin as another reviewer had done.  I may add more chicken stock as well, since the roux was pretty scarce.  Loved the corn tortilla strips on top; definitely a must-have.

This was pretty good!  I added a little velveeta towards the end and it added to the flavor.  Very filling.

Fantastic!  But a little thick, I think more broth should be added unless you want more of a "stew".  It's all a matter of personal choice.  I used tortilla chips instead of making them myself for convenience.  I think next time I will kick up the spices to give it more of a kick.

This is so easy and quick to make and delicious.  I too added ramen noodles and 3 cups vegetables with a little extra chicken broth.  Didn't have any tortillas so we use Tostitos tortilla chips either on top or on the side and that tasted great.  Next time I will try the tortillas as the recipe suggested.  Thanks for sharing, will definitely make again.

My family really likes this soup.  I make it in the crock pot, so I use fresh carrots and potatoes for vegetables.  It's easy and so delicious!

I couldn't find my Chicken Tortilla Soup recipe so I used this one but I had to do some changes on it. I fried onions, 2 cloves garlic, 1 stalk celery thinly sliced, bell pepper all at once in olive oil instead. Instead of frozen mixed vegetables I used 1 can of Bush pinto bean drained, 1 cup of frozen corn, and 1 can of Diced tomatoes and Green Chile. I also used 1 Tablespoon NM Red Chile Powder instead of chili powder. I also used 3 1/2 cups of my homemade chicken broth instead of store bought. My family like hot spicy and even tripling the chile  wasn't enough for some them but they add more to their taste in their own bowls. They also thought the soup taste came out great. Our 2 year old grandson keep asking for More Pease! He likes the grated cheese and tortilla strips on top.
