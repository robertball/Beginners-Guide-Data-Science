This was ok, but nothing special.  The flavors did not go together as well as I expected.

I substituted the Chicken broth for a wine/butter garlic broth; and softened the onions beforehand and this turned out very nicely indeed.

This recipes take too much effort for the outcome.  The arugula is too bitter and overcomes the risooto.  It might work with spinach.

Easy to make and fairly yummy.  I think in the future I will saute the onions a little longer (basically until they are limp and almost caramlized, owing to the fact I don't really like the taste of onions).
