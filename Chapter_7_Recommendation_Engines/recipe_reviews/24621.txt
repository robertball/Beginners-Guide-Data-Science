I actually crave this dressing!  I did add one major thing to the recipe.  I made a second batch of the dressing (minus the blue cheese) and used it as a marinade for the meat.  I marinated the steak for a couple hours and it really gave it some extra kick.  Will make again and again.

Hubby out of town tonite--what to do for dinner? Using the ingredient search, I typed in what I had on hand to work with quickly--leftover grilled steak, lettuce, blue cheese,green pepper and tomatoes. This came up and it was perfect--and didn't break the calorie bank!  I made a few minor changes, just to suit my own taste preferences, including adding some crumbled bacon and excluding the green olives, not that they wouldn't have been good. I also had some homemade Italian vinaigrette on hand, so didn't need to bother with this dressing, which was probably just as well since the Worcestershire in it didn't really appeal to me. All and all, no matter what little individual spins you put on this, a great idea, and just a delicious simple dinner, made perfect with the glass of red wine I had to accompany it.

This a great recipe for those nights when you feel like a salad, but don't want to feel hungry minutes after you are done. I made this using my leftover steak from the night before and it worked great.

Fabulous salad - plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled steak! And while the vinaigrette was nice and light, I opted to leave out the Worcestershire sauce and instead added just a bit of dijon mustard. I dressed up the greens with a bit of crumbled bacon and subbed some roasted red pepper for the green pepper. I love the addition of the olives which gave it that nice little salty surprise. Very easy to put together and great with a side of garlic bread!

This salad is fantastic!  It is my husband's favorite meal.  I am not a huge blue cheese fan, but it works for me in this salad.  I would recommend this to anyone.

This is a great salad that is great as a main dish!  We don't like bell peppers or olives, so I left them out and added 1 lb. of blanched asparagus.  I also used a ribeye steak.  I will make this often!!  The dressing is yummy!

I have to agree with other reviewers...the dressing for this steak salad is incredible!  I will be whipping up extra and keeping it on hand for salad, chicken or pork marinade, veggies, etc.

This made a fantastic luncheon entree for my ladies group. In fact, its very similar to a steak salad that we get at our favorite restaurant....only we don't have to drive 30 miles to get one now! To make it taste more like the version used by our fav restaurant, I made the viniagrette with garlic flavored olive oil and added a splash of white balsamic vinegar.Thanks so much for posting this wonderful salad, Linda. We always wondered what was in the dressing.

TASTY! I was in a time-crunch to get dinner on after work, so I got 1# sliced brisket take-out and used this in place of the steak. I also substituted garlic-herb Feta cheese for the blue cheese because it's what I had on hand. Other than those 2 things, I made exactly as stated. We were skeptical of all the ingredients, but they were GREAT together! Wouldn't change a thing ... except my husband prefers black olives! We might change that next time, or use both! Thanks for the post!

Great dressing!  We used some leftover round steak cut really thin (seasoned with liquid smoke and grilled on the bbq), a bag of (field greens) salad, some tomatoes, onion, and cucumbers as well as bleu cheese to taste.  My husband couldn't get enough of the dressing and used the remainder as a bread dip.  Serve this salad with bread and you've got a clean plate!  Also used Vegetable oil since I was out of Olive Oil (sob) and it was great!

The flavors in this salad blend very well.  I omitted the green olives and green pepper.  The dressing is perfect and should be kept in your refrigerator at all times!!  I added some toasted walnuts to the top of the salad.  VERY GOOD!!

OMG!!!  This was sooo good!  I didn't have lemon juice, so I used lemon pepper instead of pepper and I also substituted cucumbers for green peppers.  I kept everything else the same and it was just amazing...thank you so much for this recipe!

I love bleu cheese dressing but I think mixing it with the vinegar was a bad idea.  The rest of the salad was an excellent combo but I really wish I would have followed in my husband's footsteps and ate the salad with the store-bought dressing rather than what the recipe called for.

Really good recipe.  The salad part is very change friendly based on your veggie likes and dislikes.  My husband doesn't like blue cheese so I subsituted crumbled gorgonzola.  It is more subtle than bleu cheese and turned out well.

This was pretty good!  The vinaigrette could use some tweaking tho, balsamic vinegar in with the red wine vin?  Also we omitted the olives.

I have made this salad 3 times in 2 weeks. It is easy and very tasty. Sirlion is the best cut of beef for this and I suggest using the dressing as a marinade, just as other reviewers have recommended. I do cut back on the lemon juice by half, the wife said it was a bit much. This is definitely a keeper for my family.

This meal marries the refreshing crunchiness of a salad, the hearty, chewy fulfillment of a steak, and the rich savory depth of bleu cheese. It's a perfect combination. With some crusty bread (and a glass of wine!) you won't need to serve anything else for dinner. Mmmmmmm!

Quite delicious. Normally, we don't like blue cheese but its tang was just right in this very easy salad. We don't have a grill so I just cooked the steak on the stovetop. Perfect!

Everyone seemed to really enjoy this meal.  I recommed using a little less blue cheese than what is called for.  A summer treat.

Meat was a little dry-so I will try different cut and less cooking next time-but otherwise pretty good. Also used balsamic vinegar since that is all I had.

This was great, a nice change! I marinated the steak in the salad dressing & it gave it a wonderful flavor! I also left out the olives, peppers, & carrots, although the peppers would have given it an even better flavor! The dressing was a bit too tangy for me so I toned it down with a bit of Splenda, and it was wonderful!!!

My husband really liked this, but I wasn't crazy about it. He loves blue cheese and I don't, so that explains it. Otherwise, this is similar to "Black and Blue Salad" that is served at many restaurants.

What an easy recipe...I made it easier by using leftover filet mignon.  My husband and daughter loved the dresing, it is requested for tossed salads and I keep it on hand for them...and myself.  Really good!

This salad is unbelievably good. The combination of veggies sounds a bit odd but works SO well. I don't yet have a grill, so we cook the steak on a dry, salted cast iron griddle over fairly high heat. (If you've never done that, try it; it makes a wonderful steak. The salt is important.)

This is one of our favorite salads.

This truly was quick and easy.  Perect for summer.  Only change I made was grilling the sliced red onion and a red bell pepper (spray both with some olive oil and salt lightly).

I always like to try a recipe as is the first time, but my boo doesn't like blue cheese (say what?) so I substituted it for feta. Couldn't find the pimento stuffed olives, so substituted mixed greek. Otherwise, everything was as is, and got 4 thumbs up (from both of us, that is - he doesn't have 4 hands!).

This salad is amazing!  I left out the blue cheese; not a big fan.  Other than that, it is one of our favourite salads for a lite summer lunch or dinner.

This is a great recipe! My Hubby is a picky guy, and he loved it! I made ony two changes, which in my opinion made this salad super great. First, I marinated the steak overnight (Veggie oil, Soy Sauce, Wochestershire sauce, 5-6 cloves of crushed garlic, and Balsamic vin). I also used Balsamic instead of the red wine vinagar in the dressing. I Constructed my dinner salads, and dressed them, and then topped them off with a pile of "Texas Crispers" Extra Crispy style oven fries. I Will be making this often! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

This was excellent as a main dish.  The only changes I made were using flank steak, added some avocado, and used some shallots instead of red onion.  Really delicious.

This is a really good salad.  I only used 1/2 cup of blue cheese and that was still a little too much for my taste, but it was still an excellent salad dressing.

This salad is AMAZINGGGG!  I couldn't believe it.  I  typically stick to caesar salads and I decided to give this a try with my leftover steak and since I've been on a health kick lately.  I honestly couldn't believe how good it tasted. It is now my staple!  I did without the green/red peppers (because I didn't have any on hand)  just used the re donjon and tomatoes and it was amazing.  Definitely recommend!!! Only thing is IT IS FILLING!  i made a large plate and could only get through half.  (and trust me I tried to finish the entire thing)  sooo filling.

love this salad.  Blue cheese and gorgonzola cheeses are not the cheeses I like so I usually substitute with goat cheese or, most often, feta cheese.  So yummy and a great light dinner!

WOW!!!  Tastes like something from a fancy restaurant!  I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the steak first in the dressing (minus the bue cheese).  Also left out the onions and didn't miss them.

I had really high hopes for this recipe - the only change I was planning to make was omitting the blue cheese since we didn't have any on hand.

But the dressing was simply terrible!  It separated although I kept mixing it (also whisking, VERY vigorously) and it had an overwhelming bitter, sour taste.  I had to check that none of my ingredients had expired, it was that yucky!  The texture was way too oily and the lemon juice, which I expected to give a light, tart flavor, was completely lost in the garlic and oil.  I was very disappointed, as so many reviewers had raved about the dressing.

We ate it with a pre-packaged Caesar dressing instead.

Very good salad. I subbed feta for the blue cheese, what I had on hand. I loved the green olives. Use whatever veggies you happen to have. I used green beans, carrots, and blanched cauliflower. This made a delicious spring dinner with a yellow lentil, black eyed pea and dandelion green soup in the slow cooker. Great marinade

This is delicious!!!!!! And i've never liked a steak salad from anywhere in my whole life! I decided to try this one because I had some steak and some salad fixins that needed to be used. I did not use blue cheese (not a fan), I used feta and made the dressing exactly as directed, and OMG it is better than any dressing ever!!! I left out the green pepper and onion (also not a fan), and instead I added fresh mushrooms, 2 carrots instead of one, a stalk of celery, a sliced cucumber, and 3 chopped hard boiled eggs. Served with a garlic loaf and OMG it was the best meal i've eaten in a looooong time!!!!

I had to make one minor change because I cannot stand blue cheese but hubby is a huge fan. I left it out of the dressing mix and just added it to the top of his salad. We enjoyed this salad very much. I added some yellow bell in addition to the green. This made for a nice healthy yet hearty dinner and I will make again.

5 stars for the dressing alone!!  Fantastic.  I skipped the blue cheese, I'm not a fan, and it was still excellent.  I was dipping croutons in the remaining dressing and eating it up :)

Very tasty dressing. My husband and I loved it :) 

I used John Soules' Beef Fajita (fully seasoned & cooked). It saved me some time to prepare steaks.

I love this salad!  It is easy to prepare and the dressing is fabulous!  I am not a huge blue cheese fan but it really works in this recipe.  I will be making this dressing minus the blue cheese for many other dishes!

Dressing was just so-so, maybe even a little too vinegary.  Meat should definitely be marinated somehow, because I didn't and it was bland (although I did salt and pepper it before cooking).  I wanted to really like it... but I've had better steak salads.

Excellent. When we grill steak we always do extra to have steak salad the next day. I marinate the leftover steak in red wine then build my salad. The dressing is delicious!

We omitted the olives, pepper and tomatoes and substituted canned mandarin  oranges, sliced almonds and dried cranberries, and bacon bits. Topped if off with Greek Mediterrian salad dressing - it was amazing! Endless possibilities!  I have also added goat cheese other times as well. 
*we steamed the carrots as well.

We really enjoyed this main dish salad.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I put Worcestershire on the steak, instead of in the salad dressing.  I first thought the dressing was a little weak without the Worcestershire, but when you get a bite of the briny olive and the steak, or a bite of the blue cheese and the steak, the dressing is just right.  Really loved the combination!

Great recipe! I tweaked the dressing a little by using balsamic instead of red wine. After I made it I had to add more salt, pepper, Worcestershire and added garlic salt. I used mixed greens instead of romaine, red bell instead of green, omitted the carrot and olives. We're having leftovers tonight!

Awesome salad!  I changed a few things though.  I LOVE balsamic vinegar and feel that it should pretty much be in everything, so I put a couple teaspoons of it in the dressing.  I also left out the bell pepper and olives, and I just realized I forgot to put the cheese on it too, and it was just fine!  We're not big fans of blue cheese anyway.  I was inspired by a wonderful salad at the Oyster Bar which has apples and grapes in it, so I added those.  OH, MY GOSH...it TOTALLY takes this salad to the next level.  Especially the grapes.  Purple grapes go sooo well with this dressing.

Delicious!  I didn't have the extra veggies on hand, so I boiled some potatoes and threw them in with the lettuce, cheese, dressing, and steak for a "steak and potato salad".  Making it again tonight!

This was perfect to make once home after camping all weekend. Started looking for a salad recipe to use up the leftover tri-tip that wasn't enough to for meal by itself,  Had some corn that I sliced into 1" slices, radishes, marinated asparagus (left from the bloody mary's!) mushrooms.  The dressing made it all come together!!  the down side was garlic gread from the leftover hot dog buns, but hey! I used just about everything up!!

We love this  salad.  I used left over fillet  steak from a restaurant we went to last night.  I didn't have Blue cheese so used Gorgonzola  and didn't have green olives (unbeknown to me, my husband used them up in his  cocktails) so I used about two tablespoons of capers.  I could have used more of them and will the next time.  A great way to use leftover steak.

I made this salad for dinner tonight and it was pretty good.  The only problem I had was I did not like the dressing at all...so I threw it out and made a balsamic vinegar dressing instead.  Other that that, a great salad.  (I'm not saying it was a bad dressing, just not to my taste)

Oh. My. Yum! This was so incredibly good.  I knew I wanted a steak salad, so I searched here for one and chose this one.  Am I ever glad I did. I only used the tomatoes and red onion for my veggies, though I'm sure it's just as great with the other ones.  I used gorgonzala crumbles in the dressing.  Let me tell you, the dressing is fabulous!  If you exclude the carrots, this is a South Beach Diet-friendly recipe as well.  Yum, yum, yum!  I will be making this again and again!

Great salad. I am not a green olive lover, nor a big fan of worstesher sauce; in this recipe all of the flavors come together in totally surprising and satisfying ways. I would reccomend using a high quality blue cheese. I bought a pre-crumbled cheese and it was pretty flavorless, my husband thought it was feta. I will  definately make this salad again.

This recipe was really tasty.  I added avocado to the recipe and a little more garlic.  I also used goat cheese instead of bleu cheese. Very yummy! Next time I might try it with balsamic vinegar.

Truly a great salad.  I used the recipe for the dressing and added some other items.  I roasted the red pepper and added roasted walnuts.  I also added avocado and cucumbers.  Definitely will make again and for company.  Thank you.

Yowza! This is an outstanding salad! The only thing I did different was use a skirt steak in place of the sirloin. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was a great compliment to the steak. Will definitely be making again real soon.

The dressing is tasty. I ended up adding a bit more red wine vinegar and only used 1/4 c olive oil bc it tasted a bit too oily for me. I used petite sirloin steak and seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder -just a pinch of each.

The dressing rocks!!!  Oh so tasty, would be great on ANY salad I think.  The salad itself is good too, esp liked the olive addition, adds zip.  Almost followed the ingredients, but added fresh mushrooms rather than green pepper, just our preferance.  Many thanks Linda.

Mmmm ... this was yummy!  I had to sub bleu cheese for feta; it's what I had on hand.  I didn't use bell pepper or olives, as I don't care for either.  I used part of a leftover steak that I reheated in the oven and seared over high heat.  Delicious!  Only recommendation I have is DON'T pour all the dressing over the salad.  Use a little bit at at time, or else it will be a greasy, limp salad.

This was very good. Omitted olives, green pepper. Used parmesan cheese not blu cheese. Good stuff. Would make again.  Dressing was just right. Would make more next time.

Excellent salad...everyone loved it and my mom asked for the recipe.  Will definitely make it again!  I did marinate the steak prior to grilling, but no other changes.  Love, love, love the dressing!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe and one of my husbands favorite.  I replace the carrots with fresh green beans cooked for 4 minutes and soaked in ice water,  Don't change the dressing or it isn't this salad.  We love blue cheese and this salad really shows it off.

Loved this recipe!  I only had white wine vinegar in the pantry so used it and used feta cheese instead of blue cheese.  I also marinated the meat in the dressing and made extra for the salad.  A great summer dinner recipe!

Linda, I want to hug you for this recipe! I've reviewed it before but thought I'd re-iterate how great it is. I make this at least once a week and never get tired of it. The flavors of the dressing just go together perfectly with the steak. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Thank you thank you thank you, as this recipe will forever be a staple in my house!!

This is an over the top dinner.  Didn't have blue cheese so cut up some small cubes of sharp Cheddar then topped everything with the handful of strawberries I sliced to add color and just a tad of sweetness.  The dressing is killer and we loved it!  This is a keeper.

I had leftover steak which I sliced and microwaved to heat up, and yellow pepper instead of red or green. I added some slivered almonds for crunch. I had to reduce all the amounts by half since no one else was going to be eating it. I think this would taste better with a better quality blue cheese than I had one hand. I am not a huge fan of red wine vinegar so next time I might use balsmaic. But fast and easy, healthy and not too heavy! Thanks. Fit right into my South Beach Diet.

Tasty way to turn leftover steak into a filling lunch! I happened to have most of the ingredients on hand except the green pepper and carrot so I left that out. I also cut down on the cheese a bit but otherwise I followed the recipe. I would make this again when I have leftover steak on hand.

After all of the wonderful reviews I expected more from this recipe. I followed the recipe but it lacked a unifying flavor. A nice summer meal but this particular recipe is just not one that I will repeat to the T. The one thing I will be using again is the dressing for a side chopped salad. It had a light and fresh flavor that went really well with the vegetables.

I found the dressing pretty bland.  I made one batch minus the cheese the night before and marinated my steak overnight.  The steak alone gets 5 stars.  I should've make the dressing at the same time and had the flavors blend for 24 hrs in the fridge.  Instead, I whipped it together about an hour before dinner and I could only really taste oil :(

I didn't change one thing about this dressing! EXCEPT I did not have blue cheese on hand, I had Feta cheese, and it turned out fantastic. I used the exact measurements and everything (which I normally don't do, because I always change things to suit my individual taste). And I thought that the pimento-stuffed green olives would be kind of weird with this salad... but absolutely not. The whole thing was awesome. I just omitted the carrots and green bell peppers because I don't particularly care for them in my salads. But that's all up to you, because it is definitely all about that dressing! Thanks!

I just finished this for lunch using left over steak.  It was fantastic!!  I loved the dressing, it had a ton of flavor without needing to use much.  I made the dressing first so the flavors could really sit and mix togther.  I omitted the olives (not a fan of them) and added cucumber slices.

Very tasty!  I have to be honest and say I despise bleu cheese even though my husband loves it, so I repaced the bleu cheese with feta.  I loved it but my husband pouted!  Ha ha!  Very filling supper for me although he would have liked a bit more.

I make this salad all the time.  For dressing I use a rasberry vinegarette and while grilling the steak I skewer some cherry tomatoes and grill as well.  Spray them with some cooking spray so they dont stick.  To die for!  I promise.

I changed the ingredients of the salad a little to match our tastes and used left over Angus Tenderloin we'd gotten as a gift.  Loved the dressing, but you have to let it sit, that is key.

Delicious! We make this all the time. Works well with Ribeye as well. Good with leftover steak warmed in the oven.

Delish! This salad is wonderful. I used balsamic vinegar because that is what I had on hand and it went so well with the beef and blue cheese. I also added 1TBS of Apricot Perserves to the dressing and it was AMAZING!

This was perfect!  I made the dressing according to directions, but added 1 packet of sweet & low as my husband likes a sweeter viniagrette.  I used leftover steak from the night before.  I substituted green onion for the onions called for and added cucumber.  I omitted the olives as I didn't have any.  For my salad, I used feta cheese instead of bleu (I'm lactose intolerant) and let everyone sprinkle their desired amout of cheese on the salad then add dressing.  The results were OUTSTANDING.  We are having this again tonight!  Thanks for a kick butt recipe!

Really good! I had some left over Prime Rib from the night before, so I used that. I also added a little mayo, and used fetta and cheddar instead of the blue cheese. (Not a fan of the blue!) Really tasty, and took no time to throw together :)

I followed the directions (minus olives because I was out) the fresh sunny taste was really refreshing I couldn’t believe it I was skeptical at first (just started doing new salads with out ranch) but I loved it! Making it again tonight. I am going to try one of the suggestions in reviews and marinate the meat in the same dressing.

Doggone it - I forgot the blue cheese!!! This was still  just right for the muggy,  sticky hot weather we've been having this week. I'll remember next time  but won't add it to the vinegar, just  crumbled it over each plate. Glad I picked this recipe to try, it's a keeper.

This was a really good salad!  I used black olives and cucumbers instead of green olives and green peppers - just a personal choice!  It would be good with feta cheese, too.

I made this recipe on a cold winters night. It was amazing and a real hit.  This salad dressing is far superior to any store bought product period.  It's a keeper in our house.  We'll have this year round. fantastic.  Thankyou for this terrific recipe

I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I  ate it with vegetarian steak strips and only added half of the blue cheese the recipe called for. Some of my family who don't like blue cheese thought even that amount was too pronounced. Not everyone liked the dressing either (but I did!). The salad, though, is very flexible and goes with a lot of kinds of dressing. Everybody thinks we should make it again, so we will!

Very good.  Made this salad last night for dinner.  Husband and I both thought it was something we would like this summer when too hot to cook.  I did add a smidge of Grey Poupon Dijon mustard to the dressing.

I wanted something light and fresh and this was a perfectly delicious salad for a hot July night when the AC was broken. I  made a couple modifications by using feta instead of blue cheese and chopped kalamata in place of green olives.  It had just the right amount of zing  when drizzled on the lettuce with onions and red peppers that was put on cold plates with sliced steak on top.

I made this salad in combination with Marinated Flank Steak also found on the AR site as well as some of the salad combinations from Classic Tossed Salad to put together a really excellent steak salad last night.  Used feta instead of blue cheese, didn't have any green pepper or carrots but added sliced mushrooms.  Used grape tomatoes instead of regular also used black sliced olives instead of green stuffed. This is a salad you can play with to make your very own and hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed this for dinner. Will be repeating many times through this hot summer.

This was very good.Great dressing! I marinated my sirloin in it for 3 hours and pan seared for a couple of minutes on each side and I let everyone choose their own amount of blue cheese   :)   Although this is great I think I have moved away from marinades, this recipe didn't say to marinate. Next time I will salt and pepper and sear the steak on the grill then finish off in the oven for 2 minutes until med rare. The dressing is still great!

I LOVE this salad.  It's fantastic just as written.  I usually grill the steak a day or two in advance and slice it just before I make the salad.  I add the juices to the vinigarette before serving.

(I must confess, though, that when I'm feeling lazy I sub the homemade dressing with one made from half ranch dressing and half bbq sauce. It's a different salad . . . but it's just as good!)

The salad dressing was awesome and is always in demand by my family. Didn't use blue cheese and olives since none of us like those two items. I also had managed to buy thin steaks and cut them into slices which made the salad easier to eat.

I really liked this recipe. The steak mixed with the vegetables, gives it an all around full meal. I enjoyed the dressing very much and will try to use as a marinade, just as someone else had suggested. I will make again. The only difference I made was: I used a London broil rather than sirloin, still came out Greta. Thank You

This is wonderful. We followed the recipe pretty closely, only omitting the bell pepper and using cherry tomatoes rather than regular ones. We also made extra dressing and used it to marinate the steak for a few hours before cooking it. We'll be making this often, especially in the summer.

This was mediocre at best.  The salad needed something sweet to balance the saltiness of the olives, blue cheese etc.. perhaps apples would work. Nothing special about this and will not be making it again.

Tried this last night.   Loved everything about it except the cut of meat.   I would recommend not using sirloin steak.   It's always tough.   Grill a ribeye or fillet.

New family favorite...This was a hit with my family!!  Even with  my 8yr old! I didn't have crumbled blue cheese, so, I added 2T of creamy blue cheese dressing that I had. The dressing was GREAT. I also added a can of corn. Good color addition. Over all love this recipe. Thanks!!

This is a good salad, however sirloin is not the right cut for this.  Flank would have been much better.

Meh - I like the idea of it but it's not a recipe I'd save. However, I DO think it would be even better if there was avocado added to it.

This salad was REALLY good. I did not add blue cheese to the dressing, I just added it to the salad. Also, the dressing does need to sit in the fridge for awhile to get good. I added some balsamic vinegar, agae nectar, and paprika to the dressing and it was really good. I also added candied pecans to the salad and it was heavenly!

We had some steak, tomatoes, and lettuce and threw it together with the salad dressing from this recipe. Lacking red wine vinegar, we used apple cider ving. and it was wonderful. I liked it so much, I made it the next day for lunch. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious and filling; I thought the dressing complimented the steak excellently.  I used feta cheese as suggested by other reviewers and muffaletta olive sandwich spread - also a tsp of honey in the dressing. I tossed all of the ingredients together prior to plating.

This is a nice combination of greens.  I added chilled steamed green beans.  I eliminated the cheese to reduce the fat and it was still very good.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that the dressing was very bland and needed some zip.  I will definitely make it again but with a different dressing.

This was okay, but the dressing was not as awesome as I was expecting. I used an Italian blend of cheeses instead of blue cheese (the blue cheese probably makes this salad) and added honey to the dressing after tasting it, which made it much better. Also seasoned the beef with seasoned salt, fresh garlic, a little worcester, and olive oil.

Salad was good but the dressing was bitter. Ended up using blue cheese dressing I had on hand, which worked out well. Also added fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach.

We just finished eating a simplified version of this recipe and it was absolutely delish!!!  Marinated the steak for 10 hours in a teriyaki sauce then cooked on grill for about 5 minutes on each side.  Used a good, bottled balsamic vinaigrette dressing and it was ready in no time.  The bleu cheese, red onion, marinated steak, and balsamic dressing are such good matches.  Also used McCormick crunchy "salad toppins" to add some texture.  We had toasted (on the grill) whole wheat pitas on the side.  Can't wait to have this again.

Excellent. Reminds me and my husband of a salad at The Outback restaurant, the steakHouse  salad. I think next time will add some crunch to it  by adding cinnamon pecans or something like it. But definitely will make it again. The bluecheese is not too overpowering.

Great recipe! Minor changes I made were: I used leftover steak, I added about 2t. strawberry jam to the dressing & used an immersion blender which really makes the dressing thicker and there is no oil separation. Used feta cheese & added 1 avocado & craisens. YUMMY! I will make this often.
Update: 1/15/16  Has to be dairy free now, used Goat cheese, no strawberry jam (personal new taste) sweetened & popped the flavor with Agave syrup. Awesome once again!

Excellent! I decided to omit the olives because I'm not a huge fan and it still came out fabulous.  Will make over and over again. Thanks!

I have made this salad several times now and it's become a household favorite.  The dressing is delicious and best when chilled (I made once without chilling the dressing and the flavors didn't have a chance to combine).  Wonderful!

Just ok for us.  I was looking forward to the vinagrette after reading the reviews, but it just didn't wow us.

This was a good salad. Next time I may use another vegetable in place of the bell pepper and I may, too, also use feta cheese instead of the blue. There was something I didn't like in the dressing - either the cheese or the red wine vinegar - but other than that, this salad was delicious! Thanks!
