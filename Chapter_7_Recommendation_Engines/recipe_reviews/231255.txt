There is an error in the number of servings.  This recipe will actually makes a huge pot of soup, about 8-10 servings.  Of course this will change the nutritional information as well and therefore makes it much healthier than originally stated.  Hope you enjoy it!

I felt like having cabbage rolls but did not feel like doing all of the work....this was a great alternative! I used homemade pasta sauce and I browned the onions with the meat and added minced garlic to the meat as well. When it was finished cooking I added a few dashes of hot sauce just to give it some kick. Will def add this into my rotation of recipes! Thanks

Yes, this recipe did need about 3 additional cups of water to make it soup. I also had to add more spices (oregano, basil, worcestershire sauce and minced garlic) in order to give it more flavor. The concept is good but you need to be creative to give it more flavor.

Great! I too tweaked it by adding V-8 juice instead of the pasta sauce because I wanted more of a soup consistency.

This is a good hearty soup! I did tweak it after reading some reviews. I browned the meat with the onions and seasoned it with black pepper, salt and garlic. I only used half of the pasta sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes. I also added some celery salt after I mixed it all together. Simple recipe and my boyfriend loved it!!!

I did cut the rice down to 1 cup and upped the water in the soup to 5 cups from the 2 cups the recipe called for. Tasted very close to cabbage rolls. I would try maybe adding more meat and maybe adding a pork/beef/veal mix like I would when I do Cabbage Rolls. Makes lots of a very thick soup.

I used this recipe as a base and tailored it to my family's taste, like I normally do.  I used 1 lb 99% lean ground turkey seasoned with pepper and about a half tablespoon of granulated garlic (without salt), then added 8 oz of sliced brown mushrooms and the onion.  I used about 3/4th a head of large cabbage which I added slowly to the pot, wilting it a bit before adding the spaghetti sauce.  The majority of flavor comes from the sauce (I used a 16 oz jar, what I had) so use one your family really likes.  Then I added a quart of no sodium beef broth in place of the water and tomato soup mix and a tablespoon of dried Italian seasoning. Near the end of the cooking time, I added about 1.5 cups of cooked brown rice and grains that needed to be used (a great way to cut carbs if regular rice bothers you like it does my family).  We ended up with 8 large servings and with my changes, the calorie count dropped significantly.  We will use this base again because it is a solid base and easy to customize to your family's taste.  Would also be good with bell peppers in place of the cabbage.

I'm a sad momma with this recipe tonight.  For starters, it has not where near enough water to make it a soup.  Secondly, almost no flavor, I had to add TONS of salt, and Herbs de Provance, and a bunch of other spices just to make it edible.  Thirdly, Hubby and I agreed that it was far to acidic.  And finally, it scorched in the "bring to a boil" step.  It would have been nice if someone had mentioned to stir often.  I know I should have just known to do this, but a little reminder would have saved a whole pot of food.

pretty good soup, but very thick.  I added diced tomatoes and used a brown rice/quinoa mixture.  I also added some dried herbs (oregano, basil, garlic) and worcester. I parboiled my cabbage in the microwave while I browned the onions/meat mixture.  I served with sour cream and cheese, but it tastes nice without as well.  Made such a big pot, that I'll be freezing it for several meals.  Kids even ate it!

Loved this recipe!! I substituted the jar of pasta sauce with a 28 oz. can of Tutorusso Crushed Tomatoes with basil and instead of using a head of cabbage, I used a 14 oz. bag of shredded cole slaw mix (only for the sake of time and convenience). I also doubled the beef and added a bit more rice. I also seasoned the beef with a few envelopes of G. Washington beef flavored powdered bullion. Feel free to substitute the water with beef broth, too. This recipe makes a pretty large pot of soup. Delish!!

With a lot of tweaking, I can give this recipe four stars.  I'm glad I read some reviews first! Our family does not use much salt, but the recipe "as is" is flatter than a Dutch pancake. I also added brown sugar and A LOT more water as needed since the rice soaked it up faster than you can say Jack Robinson. Overall, tweaking this recipe was a boatload easier than making traditional cabbage rolls!

I added saurkrut, more beef broth, and seasoning.  I put everything in pot after browning ground pork, and beef and onions.  I used what I would use in my cabbage rolls, but without the rolling.  Everyone liked it.

Like many others, I made a few changes. To make it more weight watchers friendly, I used a little less than a pound of hamburger, and used 3/4 cup instant brown rice rather than white rice. I still used 5 cups water, but just cooked the rice in the soup rather than before. I also added some minced garlic and about 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning. With the changes, we were really happy with it, and I would make it again.

I definitely loved this hearty soup. But like others have said, you definitely need more water.  I added a quart of canned tomatoes and still had to add 3 more cups of water. I need to play more with spices next time. And i like mine with Louisiana Hot Sauce.

I really enjoyed this soup!  It taste just like cabbage rolls and is very hearty and filling.  I agree with the serving suggestions but I would say it is more like 10 to 12 servings because it is so thick and filling.  I found it almost too thick and I would add a little more water next time to give it more of a soup texture.  It is a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again.

The cabbage does not cook in the time shown unless you cut it in teeny pieces and the rice should be cooked prior on it's own and then added to the pot or you risk the "soup" being a starchy gruel.  It's fixable, just not using this recipe.  I do one similar with Peppers and it tastes wonderful.

A new family favorite.  I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup and added a little can of v8.  Beef boullion cubes added extra flavor too. We love cabbage rolls. This is an easier way to get that flavor without all of the work that comes with the cabbage rolls.  Definitely will make this again and again.

I started with the recipe as read. However, after a while, I noticed that it was getting way too thick. I had to keep adding beef broth or water quite a few times. Too much rice. I had also added half a , diced green pepper, some green beans cut in three's, and carrots. Having said that, I put it on high in my crockpot for 6 hrs. This was not sufficient. I transferred it to a stock pot on the stove on med.high for 3/4 hrs. It was finally cooked. After all that, it was delicious!! I will make it again but with much less rice, for soup consistency.

I added at least 1 cup more water, and I parboiled my cabbage for about 1 hour before adding it to soup mixture. It made it softer the way we like it.

I had to add more water & the longer it cooked the rice just absorbed it making it like a porridge.  It was also very flat even after  adding more salt. I would not make this again.

I should have read the other ratings,  It definitly needed more liquid,  It kept sticking to the bottom,  not a lot of flavor.  I should have made cabbage rolls

Would not make it again. As others have mentioned the amounts for ingredients are out of whack. 1 pound of ground beef is not enough, 3 1/2 pounds of cabbage is a lot and certainly does not soften up in anything near a half hour, especially when there is not enough water/stock to keep everything from burning to the bottom of the pan. MUCH adaptation and adjustment needed. :(

I agree with more water/broth  and more spice. I will try it again with those modifications. I also like the idea of microwaving the cabbage in advance because it took way more than 30 minutes to cook.

I used 3 small cans of tomato sauce and added a minced clove of garlic. instead of the pasta sauce.  Turned out great.  made a lot more than the recipe called for.  Delicious!!

This is a good basic stuffed cabbage soup recipe.  I like to make this soup as I'm making a batch of stuffed cabbage as I usually have leftover fixings.  In my version I use the  water from blanching the cabbage and .  I also add saurkraut and smoked polish sausage/kielbasa.  I use rice, a little bit of green pepper.. I use spaghetti sauce or V8.  This soup is incredible! I make it in the crockpot.  It freezes nicely, and can be served with a dollop of sour cream or leftover mashed potatoes!  Great on a cold dreary night !

A little additions were required along the way, like more spices and definitely more soup and water, but it was absolutely a hit! My kids love it and had seconds!

Was great as a base soup makes two whole pots. Way to much. Half every thing.

Yes I should have read the reviews, this soup does need tweaked a little but is a good base to start. Might need to cut down on the rice next time and add more spices just for added flavor but again a great base. Makes a huge pot of soup, too much for just the two of us. Guess I'll just freeze some for later.

It was good, but it tasted nothing like actual cabbage rolls, and turned into less of a soup than what could have been a filling for a roll or peppers or something. I followed the recipe exactly.

My family loved this soup.  I cut back on the amount of tomato sauce.  Taste before adding entire can of tomato sauce.  Recipe does make a large pot of soup.  Thanks for the receipe, it is a keeper!
