After cooking the ground beef, (I used 1 lb) and adding the blended soups and Rotel I thought that it needed 'something'. I went ahead and added salt, pepper, cumin and 1/4 cup salsa. My tortillas were green Hatch Chile Corn Tortillas which added color to the dish. I also used a 16 oz bag of cheese because we're cheese fanatics! Very tasty. Thank you for the recipe.
