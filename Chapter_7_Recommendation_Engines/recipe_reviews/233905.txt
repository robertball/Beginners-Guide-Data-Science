Based on what the other reviewers said, I doubled the sugar and added 1/4 teaspoon salt to bring out the flavor.  They were pretty good, and the texture was great.

I just made these yesterday for an Octoberfest party and they were not very good. No taste at all and considering all the spices I thought it would be rather tasty. They tasted like flour no taste at all.

As written, this cookie is rather bland.  It was lacking in flavor and sweetness.  It holds it's shape nicely from the cookie press, but even topped with decorating sugar, it tasted more like a biscuit than a cookie.
