This was delicious. We are vegetarians, so I used soy turkey slices. I also used mayo and mustard on the top piece of bread. This will be made again. Yummy!!

This was pretty good. I make steak sandwiches tonight with pretty much the same ingredients but decided to also have turkey available because my kids like it better. Flavorful and easy to prepare.

Good stuff, and my kids loved these and that's what matters. No mushrooms and onions for them though. They missed out. I went ahead and put both top and bottoms of bread in the oven. 
It's a keeper.

These were very good.  I did omit the olives (not a fan) and instead used provel cheese (all I had on hand).  You do need everything ready when you start...another reviewer was correct it does cook quickly.  Very good...thanks for the post.

This was a great lunch. Substituted spinach and left out the olives. Spread mustard on the rolls. Will definitely make this again. Might add peppers next time.

This sandwich was excellent! I toasted the top halves of bread. If anything I would have used more onion/mushroom mix. Will definitely make again.

These are better than your average sandwich! So easy and yummy with a little more effort than your standard sandwich. I added salt and pepper to the mushrooms mixture and I salted my tomatoes. Would be great spread with ranch dressing. Please note you do not need 1 pound of provolone cheese. You could probably get away with 1/2 lb.

Just felt this was an OK deli sandwich, nothing really special about it.  Turkey and provolone don't have a ton of flavor, and the mushroom-onion mixture just got lost (needed more of it).  This had no dressing on the bread which I think was a mistake.  Needs something like a cranberry-mustard, cherry-mustard...don't know, just something, otherwise it's bland.

These were good.  We used vegetarian turkey since we are vegetarians.  My kids could not taste the turkey.  Next time we may just do the muchroom/onion mix and cheese.  There were kind of high in calories with the hogie rolls.

I LIKED THE IDEA OF THESE SANDWICHES BUT I DIDNT HAVE HOAGIE BUNS SO I USED WHITE BREAD. INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM IN THE OVEN I DID THEM IN A SKILLET TO GET THE CHEESE MELTED. I FORGOT THE TOMATO AND LETTUCE BUT STILL THOUGHT THEY WERE GOOD. MIGHT BE EVEN BETTER WITH SWISS CHEESE.

My family loves this recipe.  The mushrooms and onions saute quickly so it really is not time consuming.  The sandwich is then ready in FIVE minutes.  So good!  I also toast the top half of the bread.

It's not often that I buy sliced provolone but I went grocery shopping today and bought some just for this recipe. Other than adding some miracle whip for some zip, I followed the recipe to the letter and this was great. Tasted like gourmet hot sandwiches that you can get at deli's.  Thanks Jennifer!

Very good hot sandwich.  Very tasty.  Be careful after putting the cheese on to melt or you will have a mess on your hands.

A very good sandwich - nothing spectacular, but very good and very filling.  I found that you should have all the ingredients ready before you start because it goes really quick and you don't want the sandwich to get cold after melting the cheese on top.  Thanks for sharing!

They were good, but not that much more exciting than a regular turkey sandwich.  I don't think that I'll be making the effort to have these again.

My husband really liked these sandwiches, I made them for dinner and he liked it so much he wanted it again for lunch.  I would recommend that you might want to toast the top part of the sandwich, otherwise great recipe!!

Turkey and provolone embellished with various veggies.  It's good.  With added pepperoncini peppers and cranberry sauce, it's delicious.

Quick, yummy, and easy!! I made mine on sourdough sandwich rolls, which I buttered and baked for 5 minutes by themselves before putting the toppings on. I also recommend putting the tomato slices on before you bake them as they get a wonderful tangy flavor.

This was a great recipe. It's simple and quick, but much tastier than a plain turkey sandwich. I used Swiss cheese, instead of Provolone, and added some spicy brown mustard. Excellent!
