I used a food processor pastry recipe from this site (French Short Pastry) which made these mini pies so easy.  Most importantly, they taste good.  Hard to believe that 1 slice (you may need 2 if it's small) of a peach gives you that much flavor.  Will be making again, trying other fruits in addition to peach/nectarine.

Oh my... this was SO easy and yummy and quick!  My husband and son loved them, too.  I did use only brown sugar as it makes it more 'caramel-y', and I mixed that + cinnamon in with the peach slice itself instead of on top of the crust.
Next time I am going to try using a puff pastry... wonder if that would work as well?!
I would add a photo but the crust formation was hilarious!

Very delicious!  I sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on the peach before rolling it up.  Sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on top before baking.  Turned out great.  So easy!  Will definitely make again and again.

We followed the recipe exactly. I really hope we did something wrong but either way, I will not be making this again. If you do try this recipe be careful applying the cinnamon and sugar. It is not really "sprinkling" because it all bounced right off, had to be a little more diligent getting it to stay on. The peaches tasted fine when we were slicing them (taste testing, wink wink) but once you tasted them in the pie it had no flavor. The recipe is just too plain. Sorry guys, this one was a no go.

Not great. First off, trying to find the ingrediant mentioned in step 1 was difficult, and I'm not quite sure I actually found what was intended.

Lastly, I just didn't think they tasted all that great. I guess what can I expect for ~120 calories, though.
