I love the flavor and texture of the filling. Perfect balance of cheesecake and pumpkin pie. I read the original blog post and adjusted the crust recipe to avoid it turning out gummy or gritty. Here are my adjustments: 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, omit egg, prebake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. The crust cooled while I mixed the filling. I did use homemade puree, so I reduced it on the stove until it was almost as thick as canned. Word to the wise: don't rush, plan ahead and bake/cool as directed in the recipe! With my adjustments, I give this recipe is at least 4 stars. This recipe is a work in progress, but definitely worth the work!

I made this for my family Christmas, and it's absolutely amazing. I'm from Australia so I didn't have access to canned pumpkin, but I just honey roasted some butternuts and pureed them - delicious! Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfect. Will definitely be making it again, and slowly converting Australia to a nation of pumpkin dessert lovers!

Two people worked on this recipe and it turned out fab.  I found the recipe (gotta get some credit) and my daughter put the ingredients together minus the liquor, we didn't have any.  Now, here is the real test for this recipe:  Considering we are horrible at baking, this turned out so well and so delicious that it will be our go-to desert from now on.  Certainly we have to credit the Chef's video with instructions, as it made it super ease to follow with confidence.

I made it exactly as the recipe states.  Takes 5 hours from start to finish, including cooling time, but following the video helps immensely, and it didn't crack.  The taste was the best on day 3, but that was the very last 2 skinny pieces!! I would definitely make it again.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving Day. I ran out of white flour and used my whole wheat flour instead. It still turned out okay and maybe gave a healthier rendition, but it tasted a bit grainy, for anyone who considers using the wheat flour instead. It would have been perfect with the regular flour, I could tell. Again, still good. I also used the recipe to a tee! Thank you again for this great recipe. I will definitely try again in the near future. :)

This is the perfect pumpkin cheesecake, it's the perfect mix between cheesecake and pumpkin pie.

I gave it 4 stars because I followed the directions exactly, but still had to cook it for 25 minutes longer than stated, and even then it never fully set.  It was very close to setting, maybe one inch in the middle was too soft.

I will make this recipe exclusively for pumpkin cheesecake.  It's not even worth it to shop around for a better recipe, this is IT.

Best cheesecake we've made yet! We found the gingersnap crust to be a little overwhelming so we traded it for a chocolate one and it was incredible!

First cheesecake I've ever made. Everyone loved it. Great spice cookie crust. No changes were made. I had to make as is as it was my first one. No changes needed.

Followed instruction and it turned out really well.  One thing I will say is to ensure that the foil wrap around the pan goes up quite high.  It was a big hit.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY because I've never made cheesecake before (not a fan). My wife loved it so much and said the taste and consistency was perfect.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever made- definitely restaurant quality.  I did not add the salt and used generic brand cream cheese.

I filled the directions exactly except I didn't have a mixer, so mixing took much longer. Also, I topped it with a dark chocolate drizzle, dollops and whipped cream, and sprinkled the remaining crust crumbs. Yum!

This was an excellent cheesecake. Taste was definitely 75% pumpkin 25% cheesecake. I followed the instructions exactly EXCEPT (1) Did not use a thermometer but baked for 1 hr 45 mins until I got that "slight jiggle in the middle" :) and (2) Used a plain ol' baking pan for the water bath and it worked out fine. The only thing preventing 5 stars was the crust. Delicious, yes. But a bit sticky and hard to cut. May go traditional graham cracker next time. THanks Chef John!

This cheesecake was absolutely wonderful. All of my friends and family raved about it! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of combining steps 4 and 5: after letting the stand mixer whip up the cream cheese and sugar, I didn't really see the point in dirtying another bowl so I just added the rest of the ingredients into the stand mixer's bowl. This seemed to not really be an issue as the cheesecake still turned out great, firm, and with no cracks. I will definitely make this again!

Outstanding.  I’ve made it twice.  First time I screwed up and bought 28 OZ pumpkin instead of 15 oz pumpkin.  Still - it was outstanding.

This is way better than regular pumpkin pie.  It's lighter and tastier.  It's my new favorite for Thanksgiving.  Everyone who ate it loved it (including people who don't normal like pumpkin pie) and multiple people asked me for the recipe.

I’ve made many cheesecakes in my life and this is the first in a water bath. Flavor good, texture bad. It wasn’t wrapped tightly enough so water got in. Next time, I’ll wrap it myself (husband did it) or skip that step altogether.

1st time making a pumpkin cheesecake or any cheesecake LOL. I will say it definitely has a lot of ingredients and steps but I was successful in making it. I will be trying this again for the holidays with some tweaks. The crust was a little stickier then I liked I am going to put that in the oven to dry out a bit before putting the filling in (which was advised in the remarks below) and since I like to add my own touches I will be making it just a little more flavorful (a little more spices) other then that texture was smooth but dense and very good.

Excellent texture and flavor. Only variation is that I used Kosher salt in crust which, with the ginger snaps, gave the crust a combo pop of spicy/sweet/salty.

Loved this pumpkin cheesecake!  It was light and fluffy.  I used spice wafers instead of gingersnap cookies, but for all intents and purposes they are basically the same thing.

I've made this 2 times now and expect to make it again for another special occasion. It was requested for the latest family dinner.  I followed the recipe as written. I used Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey; hopefully that is close enough to bourbon whiskey. The ginger snaps I used for the crust were from Safeway - 40 of them equaling about 10 ounces.

The crust turned out gooey, the filling wasn't firm enough (like a cheesecake should be). The overall flavor was nice.

It looks very pretty and tastes fine, but it is really 75% (or more) pumpkin pie, NOT CHEESECAKE.
I followed the directions very closely (omitted nutmeg and allspice because I don't like them). I was suspicious of the 2nd can of pumpkin puree, but I love Chef John, so I went with it. This is still far too much like pumpkin pie for my liking.  Disappointed.

It was a bit too rich for me overall; I would not make this again although I like the taste and creaminess.  I would rather make a cream cheese cake or pumpkin pie separately, but I am so glad I tried this recipe.
