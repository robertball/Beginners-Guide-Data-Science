this marinade is excellent. However, the habanero really blew us away. We used the recommended amount of habanero sauce and let the chicken marinade for 36 hours or so. WHen we cooked the chicken, the marinade was delicious, but the chicken became barely edible in the end since our mouths were on fire. 
When we left the habanero out of the marinade recipe, the chicken was nice and tender, flavorful, and FAR less spicy. So this marinade is quite good, but i recommend a limited amount of habanero.

Awesome!!! I used this with a flat iron steak; let it marinate in the fridge for about 24 hours and WOW!!! What fantastic flavor! I wish I could give this one 6 stars! The combination of ingredients sounded odd to me... all that curry with beer and bourbon and hot sauce and red pepper flakes... I thought, "What a strange brew this is gonna be!" But just follow this one to the letter and you cannot go wrong. Thanks for submitting such a GREAT recipe! I'll be trying it with chicken, pork and shrimp in the days to come. I'll bet it's good with anything!

Fantastic! If my husband could give this six stars he would.  We marinated pork ribs overnight and barbequed them - they were delicious and tender!! We included all of the ingredients plus the 2 tablespoons molasses for just a little sweetness as suggested.  Can't wait to try it on other cuts of meat!

Just as advertised! This is a zesty marinade with a kick! I wish I had used the molasses. This has a southwest taste to it. My son said this is a 4.5, hubby says a 4. I made to recipe except for using only 1 tsp of curry powder. If you are looking for a regular sweet tasting sauce/marinade then this one is not for you. This would be great with spanish rice, corn, etc. Thanks for the post Block!

For all the ingredients and time, we thought this was nothing special.  Sorry, but just didn't do it for us.

I followed the recipe exactly.  We also did flat iron steaks and they were terrific.  The only thing I will do differently is halve or quarter the recipe - this makes a huge amount of marinade!

This was really good.  I put the marinade in the crock pot with a beef roast.  My entire family loved it.  I left out the red peppers because of the kids.  I used just red hot sauce instead of habenero again for the kids.  Next time I will half the recipe because it made a ton of marinade.  Definately a keeper.

This was an interesting combination of flavors.  We liked it but didn't love it.  Maybe too much curry for our tastes.  Aside from that it was still good.  Will try again with maybe half the curry.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic! Marinaded a bunch of chicken quarters in this for 48 hours, started them on the grill, then finished them in the oven. My family went after them like wild dogs! Some of the best chicken I've ever eaten, and I had to dial-down the heat! Highly reccommended!

This was really good!  I used it on my tri-tip, although I substituted cumin for curry.  It tasted great the next day reheated on steak rolls, too.

This is a quality recipie.  A little too spicy for the kids though.  But the mixture of the burbon and the sauce leaves a taste that makes you crave another bite.  I highly recommend this recipie if you like a little zest in your sauces.

Yummy!!  I used this on an elk steak I got at my local farmer's market.  I put the steak in the marinade on Saturday morning and grilled it Sunday night.  The steak was wonderfully tender, would have been able to cut it with a butter knife, if I hadn't overcooked it.  I didn't put in the beer, I didn't have any, I used Crown Royal for the whiskey, and put in 2 tbsp of Cajun Spice because I didn't have the red pepper flakes or the habanero sauce.  It was a little spicy for me, so next time I'll only put in 1 tbsp.  I also simmered the sauce until it was thick and smooth for dipping.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

unfortunately this was just a little too funky for me.. bf said there's something missing to tie it all together.. i Did leave out the brown sugar (as i usually do) so maybe that's the missing component? i'm not sure

Great sauce.  I have now tried this on chicken, pork, beef, elk, and shrimp.  It goes great with everything.  If you boil the marinade after marinating the meat, it makes a fantastic basting sauce or even serve it at the table.  It makes out of this world barbeque chicken that way!

Great marinade. I used it to make chicken fajita's. I didn't add the curry powder, beer or brown sugar but it still turned out very flavourful.

Delicious!  Marinated tri-tip strips for about 8 hours and it had just the right amount of zip to it.  (It is on the spicy side ... just the way we like it!)  Thanks!!

Wonderful!  The only change I made was leaving out the curry powder...didn't have any.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  Used it on a flank steak.  My husband loved it too.

This was awesome!!!  We marinated 4-1/2 lbs of deer steak to make kabobs for a party. They were a hit and so tender you could pull the meat apart.
