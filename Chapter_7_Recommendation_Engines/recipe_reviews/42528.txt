I made this last night at a dinner party and it was a hit -- my only recommendations are that there should be more bacon, and more eggs.  I also threw in citrus marinated chicken strips to add some substance to the meal.  Everyone loved it!  I will make it again!

I changed the greens to Romaine and spinach. They hold up to the hot dressing.  I used cider vinegar and dijon mustard. I did not use the almonds . I found this to be quick and easy . I don't think it was a meal on its own for 6 people .  Anna H.

This sounded great, but I was less than impressed.  You have to be ready to eat it the minute it is done because it doesn't hold up.  Needless to say that if you don't eat it all right then it's wasted because it doesn't keep, and having leftovers are the best part.  I ended up throwing a lot of food out.

I think I may have cooked the asparagus too long.  It needs to be crispy - just barely sauteed.

This was awesome!!!  I just made the asparagus, minus the greens, almonds and eggs and used Balsamic vinegar and served it as a side dish.  I have just one word for it...YUMMY!

This is great!  I took previous reviewers advice and used spinach and romaine, added more bacon and chopped eggs, threw in a bunch of garlic.....everyone had seconds.  This definitely stays in the front of the recipe box when asparagus is in season.  I want to try it with broccoli florets soon.

I made this as a side dish for my family last night! We really enjoyed it. The mustard adds a nice bite to the dressing. I used balsamic vinegar, which I won't do next time , as it gave the salad an unattractive dark brown color.However , with a lighter vinegar,next time it will look as good as it tastes!! Thank you!

This recipe is delicious!  I served it with Easter dinner, and everyone raved about it.  It took about 10 or 15 minutes to cook, although preparing the asparagus took a while for - first time dealing with fresh asparagus.  Even the kids liked it, mostly because of the bacon and eggs, I think.  This is a sophisticated, easy salad - would be good for company or a romantic dinner with some fresh French bread, red wine, and your honey!

This is absolutely great!  We served it as a main dish and couldn't get enough of it.  The recipe does not specify type of vinegar, so I used balsamic.  Yummy!

I made this for Mother's Day and everyone loved it.  You must like asparagus to like it though.  I did not crumble the bacon, I left them in half size pieces which looked great.  A very beautiful salad.

My husband loved this salad.  I had mixed feelings.  I didn't think it had enough dressing, so I ended up adding some balsamic vinegar.  And the leftovers certainly didn't store well (not that dressed salads normally do).  But it is certainly worth making again.  I omitted the eggs and used baby spinach for the greens, which worked out really well.

Very disappointing. The asparagus had a kind of funny/tangy flavor that really stood out in the salad. Even my father, who usually likes everything, didn't like this. Not a recipe I'll use again.

Excellent salad!  Perfect proportions of asparagus to salad greens to bacon, with a yummy dressing.  My family loved this, even the kids.  This one's a keeper.

I LOVE this salad.  It has great flavor and everyone in the family liked it.  Takes a little more time than some salads, but it's worth it.
I like it with spinach which seems to hold up better than lettuce.

Made this when my parents came over for dinner.  We all loved it.  You do need to eat it right away, but the flavor is great.  I will definately make this again.

this is absolutely awesome. We've made it lots of times for guests, and there are never leftovers (which is good because I don't think leftovers would keep well). I've added water chestnuts for extra crunch, and sometimes don't use the egg. love it!

This is a great recipe, I would suggest using romaine lettuce, don't cook the vinaigrette with the asparagus add it separate after the asparagus is cooked. I tend to double the vinaigrette ingredients because it doesn't make enough, I also use half white vinegar and half cider vinegar. Our family has this with dinner quite often.

This was really good and would have been even better had I served hot, but I was waiting for hubby to come home from work; I waited with the finished vinagrette to pour over when he came home... Wished I had waited to add the bacon since it did get soft sitting in the sauce but this was on my fault.. The flavors were wonderful and hubby was really impress with our Valentines dinner...  Served with surf n turf dinner.  :)

Lovely early summer salad.  I used romaine and it held up really well to the warm dressing.  I also made this with vegetarian bacon because, well, I'm a vegetarian - and it was awesome!

This was great! But I made it with whole wheat pasta instead of the greens for a more hardy meal. Will definitely make again!

I loved this salad. It wasn't too greasy (just gotta eyeball the drippings and get rid of alot of it), loved the tang/sweet taste to it.  Think next time I'll make more "dressing" and use a little more mustard.  This is a fav of mine, thanks for sharing.  I also added some quartered campari tomatoes at the end and tossed them with everything else.

I tried this for the first time last night and I really liked it.  I will make it again, maybe changing up some of the ingredients. I like it because it looks a little fancier and different from just an everyday salad.

Was a quick and delicious way to eat asparagus. I left out the salad greens and used 2 pounds of asparagus instead. I poached the eggs instead of boiling them and the gooey/runny york made it yummy with fresh baguette. A keeper :)

Totally Yummy!!  This is restaurant quality.  A few changes I made:
1.  I used 5 oz. of real bacon bits
2.  I sauteed the cut asparagus in canola oil along with sliced mushrooms
3.  I didn't have almonds, but used an oriental salad topper that did, BUT I sprinkled it on as I ate it.  It definitely needed a crunchy something.

This would also be yummy with grilled salmon for a healthy meal.  I will make it again soon!
