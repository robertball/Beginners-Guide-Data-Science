If you are wanting to create a true pulled pork experience you should really cook your butt to an internal temperature between 195 and 205.  The higher temps further break down the fat and collagen.  This creates more of the wonderful juice that runs down your chin and fully extracts every bit of natural flavor from the pork.  Check out some sites that talk strictly BBQ and they will agree.

This makes the best shredded pork sandwiches!  I actually found the longer you leave the meat in the smoker, the better tasting and more tender it gets.  I pulled ours out after 8 hours and found it shredded with the slightest movement of a fork.  Just make sure to get a fairly fatty cut; it's the fat melting that makes it tender and delicious!

Very Good Recipe. I used 12.5 pound on a smoker at 200 to 225 degrees and took about 9 hours, but was well worth it. Fed 9 people and still had leftovers.

If you cook it to only 165 you will need to slice it. If you want to make pulled pork, cook to at least 195. Also, for pulled pork, if you don't have a thermometer and are using a bone in butt, the pork is done when you can pull the bone out cleanly with very little resistance.

Pouring a bottle of commercial BBQ sauce over a pork shoulder does not make it BBQ.  A shoulder at 145째 is not even close to done (pork loin...yes). You need to bring it to 190째 or better so the bone will pull cleanly.  And yes, it will take 8 hrs. or better.  FWIW...I have cooked competitively as well as for fund raisers and done BBQ catering for years.  I have cooked many hundreds of pork butts.  You can use a rub if it floats your boat, but the only real requirements are heat, smoke and time

My pork shoulder/butt was only 4 and a half pounds so I adjusted accordingly. This rub on the outside created a really nice bark however once it was done and "pulled" the bbq sauce overpowered the pork. My recommendation is to use half of the sauce while smoking and add the rest after it is done and pulled. Same amount of bbq sauce in the end I know but the smoked caramelized sauce is way more potent than bbq sauce is straight out of the bottle. Just a thought...

Nice pulled pork recipe, except the internal temperature of 145째 wasn't  nearly done enough. It was too tough to pull. I stuck it back in and let it run up to 195째F and it was fantastic. Reminded me of the wonderful pork sandwiches at Andy's in Mathews, VA.
