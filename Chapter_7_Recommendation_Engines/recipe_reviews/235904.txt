I wanted to avoid frying these, so I baked them for 10-12 minutes, on a rack on a baking sheet, in a hot oven (450 degrees F).  Sprayed with cooking spray before baking and turned them after 5-6 minutes.  Delicious.  I can imagine how great they are fried!!!  They did come out crisp in the oven, and had such a great flavor.  My base ravioli was a sausage and spinach filled one.  Great recipe Michele @ Flavor Mosiac!

These were totally worth trying. I've never fried raviolis before and this recipe was way simple. The kids were confused why I was giggling over the stove until they had to just ask LOL. totally watch these closely. And make sure to pay attention on timing. They expand in the frying process and looking like coated Stay-puff marshmallow man from the movie Ghostbusters. While I was entertained in the process of the making the recipe, my kids devoured these completely gone. The RITZ crackers give these such a light wonderful yet crisp texture and it was a rather pleasing recipe. Will make again.

Caution!  Do not make these if you are alone.  I could eat the entire batch, they are SO good!  I do love the crispness and never thought making fried ravioli would be this easy (I don't fry).  My family is going to really like these!  I'll make them again, and again.  Thanks for a tasty and delicious recipe!

I would never have thought to bread and fry ravioli...this recipe was a hit...really loved how creamy the cheese became - such a different taste than traditional ravioli.  And, everyone, especially the teenagers, ate these quickly...without the marinara!!!

I'm giving this a 4 because I'm pretty sure it was my ravioli's that made this not work out for me.  They were small ....in that there were way more than 24 ravs in a 12 ounce package and therefore too small and not enough filling to taste anything but fried dough at the end.  The coating was amazing and I cooked them in my deep fryer set on 325 and they cooked up beautiful but there just was no filling inside and none leaked out.  It was confusing.  I will make these again with bigger/different ravs and re-rate.  Love the concept!

I came up with this recipe for Ritz using refrigerated ravioli.  They were so quick and easy to make and so yummy!  I had to go back and make another batch because they went so fast!

have allways thought i'd do this but with frozen ravioli because they are alot cheaper, wonder what everyone else thinks about how to do this .  frozen or thawed and would the noodle be too soft as opposed to the firmer refrigerated versions. I will def. try this next time the refrigerated is on sale.

I love the light crispy crust this gave the ravioli.  My only mistake was choosing a ravioli that we don't normally eat and I ended up not liking the filling (no fault of this recipe!).  I will make this again using our favorite ravioli!

great recipe! Although I recomend mixing the egg and milk in with the cracker mixture to form a paste. It stick better that way. After you coat, let the raviolis sit for 10 min at room temperature before frying.

These were very good but it wasn't the "wow" recipe I thought it was going to be. It may have been the ravioli's I used. I used artichoke stuffed ravioli's instead of cheese. Next time I will try cheese.

This is the best!  We love toasted ravioli but have always used Italian bread crumbs.  I wanted to test out this recipe, so tonight I made both.  I had a taste test with my husband.  He picked this one, with the ritz crackers.

I made these in the oven instead of frying as a more healthy alternative. They came out beautifully and I was pleased with the results. Both my husband and I really liked them. The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars was because I felt as though they were a tad on the bland side. Not too noticeable but still enough to tell.
