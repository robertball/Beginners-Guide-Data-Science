I did not enjoy this drink what-so-ever. I have been trying to find another tequila drink other than margaritas and this one definitely isn't it.

Yummy coffee!!  We also added a touch of sugar to sweeten it up a little and it tastes great.  Very simple coffee but you must like tequila!

I guess I am not a fan of tequila in my coffee. I liked the cinnamon and cocoa powder on top of the whipped cream and will try that the next time I add Kahlua to my coffee.

I found this to be a fun new drink to have with a dessert. The tequila was a twist I wasn't used to have with coffee.
