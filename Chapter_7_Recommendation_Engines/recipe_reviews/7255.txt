i have made this before but without confectioners' sugar and i mix my milk and pudding before adding the cool whip (otherwise the pudding mix lumps up)...Variations of this are a Halloween dirk cake: use Nilla wafers to make tomb stones and write on them with decorating gel, orange food coloring for cream mix, marshmellow ghosts and so on...Chrismtas dirk cake: use mint flavored oreos, use a glass dish for serving and line the sides with 2 inch candy canes, crush candy canes and sprinkle on top layer, marshmellos make perfect snowmen

This recipe was okay but could use a couple of tweaks, which is why I rated it three stars. I followed the instructions, but I halved the recipe because other reviewers stated it made a lot. There were WAYYYY too many cookie crumbs and it was sickeningly sweet ( and I'm not usually one to complain about sweetness). Anyways, I recommend using half the cookies. Also, try using chocolate pudding, as this is how "real" dirt cake should be made. Forget about the butter all together, you don't need it for taste at all. All it does is give the cream cheese a thinner consistency once its blended in. So to achieve that, just throw in 2 extra tablespoons of milk instead of the butter. You should also omit the powdered sugar unless you want your cake to be extremely sweet . The pudding and whipped topping are sweet enough by themselves. adding the plain cream cheese balances the taste of the pudding mixture and gives it the perfect sweetness. It's a bummer when you try a recipe with great ratings and end up disappointed with the results. I hope this review helps. (no offense to who-ever submitted the recipe, just giving my honest opinion :)

I made these for my daughter's kindergarten class and they turned out great - and tasty!  We made this in individual plastic cups for each child and placed a worm in each one.  My daughter made paper flowers out of construction paper and we taped them on the handles of green plastic spoons.  Then we stuck the spoons down into the dirt, so the flower did double duty as the spoon.  I can't wait for the occasion to make them again.

UPDATE - We made these for her Halloween party and set Marshmallow (Peeps brand) ghosts on top.  The kids loved them!

I made this dirt cake for a friend's birthday & he thought I was bringing him a plant as I had a bunch of silk sunflowers stuck in the top. I also added gummy worms, some hung over the side and others coming out of the dirt(cookie crumbs). I used about 5 gummy worms. This time I am going to put some in the mixture between layers. It was a big hit. My pot measured 7" deep by 9" across, a little narrower on the botton, perfect size.

I have been making this for years! I always get compliments and everyone always asks for the recipe! No one ever knows that you can eat it until i go over and spoon it out! I use 2 tubs of cool whip, no sugar, 3tbs butter/margeine and a larger flower pot! And i only use Oreo's. The other cookies don't give it the best flavor. For pool and beach theme parties i use the opposite. Vanilla cookies and chocolate pudding. To make it look like sand. I use shells on top,(you can buy in any craft store)in a sand bucket with a shovel! But the dirt way is the best way!

Yum!  I left the butter out when I made this- it just didn't seem necessary.  The first time I made it I put it in a galvanized flower pot with artificial flowers and gummy worms on top.  The second time I did it for a Halloween party and put it in a wide-rimmed glass bowl.  I did a whole graveyard scene on top with Milano cookies as gravemarkers, with RIP written in black frosting.

loved it! I used an 8 inch plastic flower pot. Came out perfect. The pot has holes inside, so I lined the inside with aluminum foil. The best way to do so is to turn the pot upside down, place the foil on top, and press it to take the shape of the bottom of the pot. Remove the foil, and turn the pot right side up, and place the pot shaped
foil inside...Also, I made my own whipped cream to not make it too sweet, and still came out really sweet.Next time, I will not add any sugar in the whipped cream. But really delicious, everyone was surprised!

Update,06/16/2008: It's been three yrs now, that I make this cake for father's day. This time, I used chocolate pudding, and added no sugar to the cream that I whipped. My mom did not like the salty taste from the cheese,and did not care for the sandy texture of the oreos inside, so I used mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese, and soaked the oreo cookies for a couple seconds in milk, and added them whole to make the layers. I only crumbled some for the top, for the dirt effect. What an improvement! So creamy and delish! My mom loooved it, yippy!! From now on, I will only use mascarpone for this recipe! And kep the cookies whole(about 2 pkgs of cookies.)

I made this on Saturday and served Sunday, for Father's Day (for husband & father in-law).  My father in-law was shocked and made a face when I brought the flower pot with fake flowers and a few gummy worms sticking out!  It was hilarious!!!  I put a big tag on the flowers reading "Happy Fathers Day Dad & Opa."  It was a very deliscious dessert, and EVERYONE at the table requested for me to make it again some time!  I did the recipe exactly.  A very FUN and easy recipe.  Very light-tasting, yet rich tasting with the Oreo's.  A real keeper!!!

Good recipe, but i made a few changes. I did not add butter or sugar. This is already sweet enough with pudding and whipped topping and the addition of the cookies. I started with a bottom layer of crushed cookies, then pudding/topping/cream cheese mix, cookies again, etc. ending with crushed cookies on top.

It's a fun cake and a great conversation piece, but the taste isn't anything extraordinary.  The only big downfall of this recipe is the butter & cream cheese mixture.  I didn't think the butter was necessary, the cream cheese didn't add much flavorwise either, and it was difficult to spread on top of the yet unset pudding mixture.  I'd make it again for a fun kid's party, but not when I'm going for taste.

Get requests for this dish at every family gathering.  Put it in a new dump truck (lined with plastic wrap for ease of cleaning the truck) one birthday.  I used a cheese grater to "crumble" the cookies since I don't have a food processor and the blender wasn't doing the trick.  Makes a very nice texture for the "dirt."

I have had dirt cake many times and even made it a few times in the past, but I just didn't care for this recipe. The end result was tasty but I wouldn't use this recipe again. I found it impossible to blend the cream cheese mixture smoothly with the pudding mixture. I used my kitchenaid countertop mixer and beat on high for a long time and it still didn't come out quite smooth, but maybe I was just being picky. I also think the majority of the ingredients are unnecessary (powdered sugar, butter, cream cheese and even the cool whip). I honestly think it would have tasted better with just pudding and cookie crumbs. Lastly, two boxes of oreos would be way to much. I only used one. Oh...and don't forget to add gummy worms!!

What's not to like?  I made this with regular sugar, no butter, chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla and 16 oz Cool Whip because you can only get it in 8 oz containers here so I bought 2 but didn't want to have half a container of Cool Whip sitting around.  It turned out pretty much just how I hoped it would :)  My teacher fooled my class with this one day when I was in kindergarten.  I'm going to be a teacher soon and plan to make this for my students in little cups with a gummi worm coming out of each one!

Excellent. Recipe made 24 servings, approx 5 oz each. Used sugar-free chocolate pudding, gummy worms & clear cups. Will prob use smaller cups next time, as children did not eat whole serving.

Two comments: First, this is a good recipe, but I gave this 4 stars because I only needed half the amount of oreo cookies the recipe calls for.  Second comment (none of this affected my rating): I followed the recipe using chocolate, vanilla, and cookies and cream pudding flavors.  Then I made the dirt cake with straight pudding (following the directions on the box) and the oreo crumbs.  I had my husband do a blind taste test, and with all three of the cake "flavors" he liked the simple pudding version better than the elaborate cake version. So, I made dirt cups for my daughter's party with just pudding and oreos and it was a hit! Saved me some money too.  So, while this is a good recipe, you might be able to save some time and money just using regular pudding.  Oh, for the layers (in little plastic cups) I used 1/3 c. of oreo crumbs (splitting it three ways) with 1/3 c. of the pudding inbetween each of the oreo layers.

Made this for company the other night. Since there were only 4 of us eating, I halved the recipe. Am VERY glad I did because as of today, we have dished out 9 servings and there is STILL more. Note: that was doing HALF the recipe!! WAY too many oreos. I will cut some out next time as well. I used cheesecake pudding, and omitted the butter (really no reason to put it in) and it was very good. Just wish I didn't have to scrape off so many oreos. Will definitely do this again. I am planning on doing it for my little boy's birthday party in the back of a tonka dumptruck. :) YUMMY!

This was incredibly easy to make and since I was bringing this dish to a Halloween Party I made a few changes.  I layered the ingredients in a 9x13" pan and then I melted some chocolate chips and put the melted chocolate in a ziploc bag...cut the tip and used it to write RIP on some Pepperidge farm Milano cookies.  Stick them in a scattered fashion throughout the pan to make a graveyard!  The dessert was delicious and quite a conversation piece! (Just make sure you have someone dig into it so everyone else will follow...noone wanted to be the first to dig in because it looked too good to eat! :)

Big hit at our construction-themed birthday party! I would use chocolate pudding next time so that it actually looks like dirt underneath the Oreos though. We served it from a dump truck. I used only 3 tbsp of butter and no sugar as another reviewer had recommended, and not as many Oreos.

The recipe specifically states that you use INSTANT pudding, ergo there's no boiling involved. This is a great recipe that, if you follow the directions and ingredients list, yields a delicious result.

very good and kids love it! I did make some changes to make my waist line feel just a tad better! I do not use the butter, use splenda versus confectioners sugar and low fat cream cheese. Also I use sugar free pudding and lite whipped topping. Did this for a family gathering and no one knew the difference!

I'm definitely a dessert girl, through and through, and growing up in North Carolina most of my life I have become well-acquainted with dirt cake at school bake sales, outdoor barbecues, and family reunions. I, however, had never made dirt cake myself before and was looking for an easy, straight-forward recipe that I could adapt to my own personal tastes... this one is it! I made a couple of substitutions, however. Instead of just using vanilla pudding, I decided to use BOTH vanilla and chocolate! I just mixed the two puddings together with milk and added the whipped topping, like the recipe calls for. If you don't have a food processor, or, like in my case, you don't have a food processor that is very big, filling a Ziploc baggy full of the cookie and crushing them with something heavy - I asked my fiance to do it for me - will work just fine! :) I took this over to my future-in-laws for dinner last night and it was a big hit! Next time, I think I will try using peanut-butter flavored pudding instead of the vanilla or chocolate for something different - a Reese's type dirt cake. Definitely worth a shot, I say. Can't go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate! Mmm!

This recipe does not provide adequate directions. It does not specify when, if at all to boil the milk and pudding mixture. The result is some sort of liquidy, galactic mess that does not even come close to imitating pudding. I'm distraught to have followed the recipe so meticulously, only to have wasted my ingredients.

YUM!!! This is a family and friends favorite.  You can cut down calories by omitting the cream cheese and butter. The taste and texture is still the same but a few less calories.  If you use a clay pot it will absorb most of the moisture and it will not get soggy at all :)

GREAT RECIPE! TASTES LIKE A HUGE OREO COOKIE BUT BETTER. MAKE SURE THAT YOU PREPARE IT AT LEAST A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOU SERVE IT SO THAT THE CREAM HAS TIME TO THICKEN. IT IS SOOO GOOD AND VERY NEAT LOOKING =) THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT RECIPE!

I too tried to save calories by omitting the butter, using fat free cream cheese and whipped cream, and reduced fat oreos, and this still came out delicious. I agree with previous reviewers who said 2 packages of Oreos might be too much. I used about one and a half and it was perfect. This is a delightful recipe!

I make this every year for my daughter's birthday !! So it will look like soil I use chocolate whip topping and pudding instead of vanilla. This year instead of a "dirt" cake she wanted a "sand/beach"cake so we used the Golden Oreos and decorated it like a beach for a hawaiian theme party. Very fun

I used a 9x13 inch pan and it was a little too small (I couldn't fit the lid on top).  Don't forget to put gummy worms in it though!  You can't have dirt cake without the worms.

I whipped this up in 15 minutes from start to finish!  This is one of the most simple desserts I've ever put together, and it was a huge hit with both kids and adults.  I put the desert in a small plastic wagon, and used a small shovel for scooping.  Everyone raved over the presentation!

We threw a BBQ over Memorial weekend, and I told all of my friends to "branch" out and make something new for side dishes!  I decided to make Dirt Cake because I had seen it before at a shower.  After reading other reviews, I decided to substitute the vanilla pudding for the cheesecake one too!  It made the whole dessert irresistable!!  No one believed we could eat because it looked so much like a pot of flowers. I got my share of kudos!

Because all of the frozen whipped topping options I found at the store were loaded with hydrogenated fat- which I try to steer clear of- I used vanilla greek yogurt instead.  I also cut down on the cream cheese, used chocolate pudding, and didn't add the extra sugar.  It still turned out delicious.

Perfect! The only thing I changed was chocolate, rather than vanilla, pudding. I was skeptical of the butter and powdered sugar, but it came out great.

Great recipe for kids and adults, but I did one thing different. I take the cream off the cookies and mixed it with the pudding mixture.  Adds more flavor!!

I used 1/4 c butter and only 2-4 T powdered sugar. I also whipped 1 c heavy whipping cream w/ 2 T powdered sugar in place of the whipped topping. Very good. Next time I'll omit butter altogether.

mmm.. dirt!  The kids love this.. and so do the adults!  I always follow the recipe exactly.. but, definitely use whole milk and good quality butter (I use Land of Lakes). Also, you can alternate this recipe a little bit.. you can make "mud" by using chocolate pudding mix or you can make "sand" by using vanilla oreo cookies rather than chocolate (and the "sand" is heavenly.. oh-my!)

This is a fun recipe!  I made the sand version for my dd's preschool class about 2 weeks ago.  They loved it!  I use chocolate pudding when making the "dirt" cake, and add gummy worms and the "candy" rocks.  It adds a nice crunch.  I used vanilla pudding for the "sand" cake, and added bug gummies.  For decoration, I colored coconut blue (ocean) and added teddy grahams lounging on foot roll up towels with a drink umbrella.  I also put some teddy's in gummy lifesaver "rings" in the water.  SUGGESTION:  Before adding whipping cream, make the pudding until nice and thick.  Then add the whipping cream.  It works much better!  Enjoy!

I made this for Easter and not only did the family get a kick out of it, but it tasted great.  I even substituted for reduced fat oreos, low fat cream cheese, skim milk, fat-free sugar free chocolate pudding, and fat free cool whip.  No one noticed and it still tasted great!

This is wonderful!  I did use chocolate pudding, it made for better mud.  Also, next time I will make it the night before.  It was even better the next day.  I used a flower pot, gummy worms, a plastic flower, and served with a garden trowel.  So unique!

I made this recently for a Christmas party.  It was easy to make (hard to mess up). Plus, I guess half of the fun is fooling people that it is a plant.  I put it in a pot with some fake Pointsetta flowers, and nobody could tell that it was dessert.

I'm in Mexico, and pudding isn't very popular here, so I was able to find regular pudding but not instant.  I just prepared the pudding with the amount of milk noted in the Dirt Cake recipe, and after it was done cooking, I chilled it for about 3-5 minutes.  Then I mixed in the Cool Whip.  Worked out fine.

I also reduced the butter and increased the cream cheese and there was no problem there either. 

I had leftovers because it made a lot of cake, but they were good for days...I never had the problem of the cookies soaking up the pudding.

Thanks!  This is definitely a repeater!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and used clear plastic solo cups for individual servings.
The recipe is delicious and easy to do, the only part that was cumbersome to me was chopping the cookies.  Once that part was done it was all easy and fast.  
I really dont understand the reviews that state they ommited the sugar and butter because of the sweeetness. Leaving out the powdered sugar is not going to do ANYTHING to change the fact that there are an entire package of cookies,2 boxes of pudding mix and a container of cool whip...so Im not sure what ommiting the powdered sugar will accomplish but ruining the recipe. This is a sweeet dessert, most desserts that are tasty are sweet..trust me do not alter the ingredients or leave an item out! You wont be disapointed! If sweet isnt your thing, you should probably try a different recipe all together.  I will be making this again and again!

Way too much "dirt".  I would at least half the oreos: just buy one package of oreos.  The pudding was kind of bland-not sure why.  Have had much better.  Keep looking for a better recipe.

I feel like I should probably make this again before rating it because I sent the hubby to the store for the pudding and didn't think to check the ounces. I'm pretty sure he got the bigger boxes (maybe 5oz instead of 3.5). So, there was a heavier vanilla flavor than I would have liked but nonetheless there were NO leftovers after the family reunion I'd made this for! I'll have to make it again to give it a fair rating but even with the mistake I'd still give it a solid 4 stars. SUPER easy to make and pretty economical, always a crowd pleaser.

DELICIOUS!  I have made this a few times now and it is ALWAYS a hit!  Very rich and sweet though, but still Mmm SO GOOD!  I don't do the flower pot thing but go and buy the disposable deep dish aluminum pans and I fill it up!  I too put gummy worms on top to decorate it!

YUMMY!!  YUMMY!! YUMMY!!  Especially if you are a "chocoholic!!" Dirt Cake is the best Birthday cake for a 5 year old! He loved it, and I will definately make this again for him! I also made a "sand cake" for my older son that doesn't like chocolate.....yeah, a kid that doesn't like chocolate. Both cakes were GREAT!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I just added photo #93 & 94. Perfect birthday present for anyone. Look close at the flowers. I have done this with all money flowers. This one has a few money flowers and a few money stems.  I have been making this for years. Perfect version of the recipe. Thanks!

Perfectly fun treat!! Everyone loves this, it's a classic. I sometimes use vanilla cookies and vanilla pudding to make "sand cake". Throw in a cute drink umbrella and you have a sweet little beach treat.

I had heard of dirt cakes for years but never tryed making one until I saw this recipe. It was really good and a lot of fun to make. The whole family liked it. We actually used a shovel to dip the cake out of the flower pot that I used. I am going to make it in a beach bucket with light colored Oreos for summer and call it SAND CAKE. Thanks for sharing.

Way too many cookie crumbs - the recipe I use for dirt cake has only 20 oz. of Oreo's, which is more than plenty.

This dirt cake is wonderful! I remembered making it when I was in Brownies (Girl Scouts), but this was even better than I remembered! I served it in plastic cups to keep the rustic feeling of it... and you have to keep the worms in or you lose the novelty of the dish!

It was my first time making dirtcake, though i had it many years back when i was a kid, Maybe it was me, but the gummy worms flavored the dirt cake and made it kind of funny tasting, only suggestion, dont use the worms!  Other wise good, and makes A LOT!!!!!

I made this for my sons 4th grade class at school and they loved it!  I put gummy worms in the layers and on top of the cake and it was a total hit.  The recipe is huge...I made for 20 servings but it easily fed 30-35.

I did this for my eldest son's birthday with the flower pot, gummy worms and so on. Some kids really tought it was black earth and didn't eat it even if it is excellent! It was in fact more a success with adults and my husband asked that I do it for his own birthday. Due to the lack of time, I served it in a triffle bowl and it look very nice. I would just advise that 32 ounces of Oreo was a bit too much for our taste, I used about 18 ounces. I also used fresh whipped cream instead of the whipped topping.

This cake was a huge hit.  I only ended up using 1/2 of the oreos which was fine.  I added some gummy worms to my layers and put it in a flower pot and topped it off with big plastic sun flowers, a trowel and a plastic snake.  It looked just like a plant!  It was pretty to see the layers when it got scooped out, too.

I have never seen such a reaction at my 2 year old's party with this recipe.  Young and old devoured it.  However, I did replace the standard vanilla pudding with one package of banana cream and one package of french vanilla.  Added extra flavor to the dirt.  What a hit!!!

Upon careful consideration of the comments , and after struggling to understand why this recipe "needs" butter...I took a chance and omitted the butter completely. Reason being, the cream cheese was already adding fat and smoothness, not to mention the  fat from the milk? I also was concerned that it might be, not just sweet, but too sweet because I' m kind of sensitive to that. But cream cheese by itself is NOT sweet. So I added 1/4 c of powdered sugar rather than the full amount. I used Truwhip (no hydrogenation, natural ingedients) instead of CoolWhip but I believe the sweetness is the same?The end result was a little sweet-without the cookie crumbs, so I knew WITH the cookie crumbs it was going to taste great. And it did! Thanks!

I used a pail and shovel for this dirt cake as I was taking it to a summer beach house party. It fit perfectly in a 9" pail and the kids went crazy over it. I would use chocolate pudding next time as the whipped topping lightened the vanilla pudding to an almost white color. definitely will make this again.

Very good! Rich, so feel free to use light whipped cream, or maybe take the frosting off of the Oreos before crushing them.

This was a breeze to make and the hit of the party. With a baby in the house, I never have time to make a dish from start to finish in one shot. This is a great recipe for those with a tiny time budget.  Day 1, I crushed the oreos. Day 2, I made the butter mixture. Day 3, I made the pudding mixture and added it to the butter. Day 4, I put it all together, decorated it, and ate it!  I must say, though, this is expensive to make compared to a regular old cake. Very few of the ingredients are pantry staples, so I had to go out and buy all these processed foods.   Cream cheese - $3. Cool whip - $4. Oreos - $7. Pudding - $2. Decorations - $5. Holy cow! $21 for DIRT CAKE??? Not so great for those with a tiny money budget.   By the way, I decorated it with gummy worms and fake body parts. I layered it in a glass cake dish and I was disappointed that the cream layer was white, so layered the effect looks more like an oreo than dirt. I added about 5 tablespoons of cocoa powder, plus food coloring, to turn it brown. It was yummy!

I should have reviewed this years ago!!  This is my go to dirt recipe.  I have put it in holiday containers as a gift and people expect me to bring this to every event. I use cheesecake flavored pudding instead of the vanilla and it really takes it up a notch.  Thanks for years of family fun.

Love this recipe, especially for a treat on a hot summer day.  I follow the recipe exactly.  If you do not have a food processor or don't feel like the mess, I just take the cookies, put in a ziplock bag and smash with a hammer-super easy clean up!

This was very good.  I left out the powdered sugar and it was still delicious!  Based on other reviews, I also beat the milk and pudding for a while before adding in the whipped topping.

I've made this recipe many times just as it is listed, and it's great! For my daughter's pool/sand birthday party I changed one ingredient and made "sand cake." I substituted golden oreos for the original oreos. I served it in a sand bucket with a shovel and a few mini trucks playing in the sand.  Every one loved it and it was really cute!

As a kid, I loved eating this dessert, however I am not a pudding lover.  I use either 2 tubs of Cool Whip, or I make my own Dream Whip whipped topping, mix it in with chocolate pudding & make it a mousse. I definitely use chocolate pudding & leave out the butter & cream cheese.  Sometimes I choose to not make a cookie layer in the middle.  I always use gummi worms, even inside the bottom mixture. For an Easter dessert, use a plastic basket container (found at Wal-Mart), gummi worms, chick PEEPS, robin eggs & little plastic flowers. The best thing about this dessert is that you can totally personalize it.

Hands down THE BEST dirt cake EVER!  I made the 'mistake' of taking this to a work potluck last spring-a huge hit that was gone in the hour.  The double batches last longer, but I've never had it last the whole day.  My DH & I used to work together & though I'm now somewhere else, he came home tonight & told me that everyone asked him to have me make this for his potluck on Monday.  LOL!      I mix the milk & pudding in the serving bowl(huge salad or popcorn bowl), then let it chill while mixing the butter part.  Add whipped topping to pudding, then the butter part.  I use 3 things of Oreos for every double batch, about one pkg. I fold in after the butter part, the rest I spread on top.  Don't have a food processer, so I pound them up with a hammer or rolling pin.  I've also done different puddings & different cookies(nilla wafers or golden Oreos for "sand cake") & it's always turned out great!  Bug or bear shaped graham crackers, animal crackers, & gummi candies are also terrific for decoration.  Did a 'graveyard' for halloween with mint chocolate pudding, mint oreos, Andes mints for path & head stones(piped frosting 'RIP's), & gummi spiders & body parts sticking out-so fun!

We had so much fun making this for a friend's birthday! We bought a large flower pot and a real flower in pot, carefully wrapped the flower and pot in foil and embedded in the cake... A girl thougt iht was "only" a flower and put it away from the table just before we wanted to serve it ;-) For more realistic dirt pieces, we rolled round choco-cocos-rum balls in pudding and then in the "dirt". Everyone loved it and was laughing.

Yummy and simple -- I don't know that I'll ever "slaughter" a box cake with icing again!  I used a plastic bag with the corner snipped to fill plastic cups for individual servings, then decorated each cup with a flower stem or gummy worm -- perfect for the girls and the boys.

Made this for my boyfriends birthday.  It was okay, i'm not a big fan of oreos.  but he loved it!  i used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and made my own whipped cream instead of cool-whip(too chemical-ly!)  I also made sugar cookie stands and used teddy grahams as audience members at a monster-truck rally!

i made this recipe for a halloween party my step-daughter was going to.  my mom actually made a similar recipe for me when i was her age and going to a halloween party!  this is a really cool desert that the kids always love.  there are many ways to be creative with it and i did take some of the decorating suggestions from previous reviews and found them very helpful.  we made our dirt cake into a little cemetary!  the only negative thing i can say is that the butter flavor really did stand out and tasted a little odd.  i think when i make it again i will use chocolate pudding to mask the butter flavor a bit.  all in all, a great recipe!

I was kind of disappointed with this dish which was probably my fault. All the stellar reviews got my expectations pretty high. I omitted the butter and reduced the whipped cream slightly. It was definitely a little too sweet for my taste and my boyfriend's and next time I make it I'd omit the sugar as well and add more cream cheese.

I used this for my son's first birthday cake. I took a tonka truck and filled it with the dirt cake then placed in on top of a piece of cardboard that I had wrapped with aluminum foil and made grass with some green icing and sprinkled dirt all over the board. It was the cutest cake ever.

I made this (times 4!!) for my sons birthday party this past weekend.  It fed about 50 people with just a little left over.  I assembled it in a cute metal tub (kinda like an ice tub I guess) lined with foil and it worked great.  We kept it in a cooler with ice around it until it was ready to be served since we had the party at a pool.  It was quick to scoop out and pass around to all the kids.  My mom used to make this when I was younger so I looked on here for the recipe.  The only change I would recommend is to cut the butter maybe by half.  I could notice the butter flavor which was a little strange.  Other than that it's a wonderful recipe.

I followed the recipe and it tastes fine but I could not imagine eating it without chocolate pudding layered in.  As a child I remember dirt cake looking like dirt all the way through.  I added two additonal boxes of chocolate pudding and layered it in with the other ingredients.  5 stars after the alteration.  The girls at work loved it!

Creamy, Dreamy, Delicious! The only thing I did differently was use chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla. Cut the recipe in half and it nicely filled an 8x8 pan with two layers of cookie crumbs and a thick middle layer of cream.

I used 3/4 cup for the cookie layer and about 1 cup for the pudding layer to keep the layers even. Another idea is to top the flower pot with "moss". Put about 1 cup of flaked coconut in a baggie add 1 drop of green food coloring and voila! moss- or grass, whichever you prefer. A fun and easy recipe for kids or adults.

The recipe itself is poorly written and way too much fluff and not enough dirt.  I would cut down on the fluff next time, or add some more oreos.

This was so cute and yummy! We added gummy spiders in our pot. Too CUTE!  My kids got a big kick out of it. We will be making again 

With the butter I do not think the butter needs to be mixed with the cream cheese and sugar. Instead Reserve enough cookies in another bowl enough to be the dirt on top. With the remaining cookies add 1 stick of melted butter to it and stir. This way it is moist and the dirt on top is dry.

Ps. My son just entered this in a cooking contest and won 1st place. Once again too cute and very yummy!

I give this desert 5 stars for the fun factor!  My 2 year old and I had so much fun making it. And then had even more fun seeing the look on my husband's and BIL's face when they saw me serve it.  They really thought it was real dirt.  I have to say it looked quite convincing.  I didn't have any pudding so I improvised with the cream cheese and whipped cream, I added some vanilla.  Iwas afraid I didn't have enough Oreo's so I had a few vanilla cookies that I tossed in. It looked exactly like fertalizer in the soil! The taste was ok.  Not the greatest desert I've eaten.  But the kids love it and I am sure I will make this again just for the fun of it!

My youngest son, Patrick, graduated from high school last month. (June 2001) As we were planning the food for his party, he mentioned that the one item that he most wanted us to serve was "Dirt". As a child he loved it! It had been a while since I made it so I asked my son-in-law to check out All Recipes.com to locate the recipe. He printed all three that came up and we chose Tammy Hooper's to make. We purchased all the ingredients as listed except for the pudding...Patrick preferred chocolate pudding. We also used two large flower pots, trowels, and instead of artificial flowers, we found pinwheels in his school colors, red and white. Everything was perfect and the "Dirt" was truly the hit of his party! Two weeks later I made more "Dirt" for our block party...again, it was a big hit. In fact, my neighbor came over this morning to borrow the recipe and flower pot to use with her grandchildren this weekend! So, Bravo! to "Dirt", and thanks to Tammy for sharing her recipe!

Everyone loves when I make this.  My family and I don't care for the added gummy candies, so we skip those.  Sometimes we'll add marshmallow Peeps to the top for decorations (easter, Peep ghosts and pumpkins for Halloween).

I loved this, but as written it could used some tweaks.  I left the butter out, because it just seemed completely unnecessary.  Why add those extra calories when it tastes great without it?  I used one package of oreos (14 oz.) and that was plenty.  Also, I think the recipe should only call for an 8 oz. tub of cool whip; I used 12 oz. and it made way too much pudding mixture.  I couldn't fit it all in the pot.  A very fun, creative and yummy desert!

The butter was way too much.  I really think it could be made without it.  I didn't follow the directions exactly and my butter wasn't softened enough, so I had chunks of butter throughout.  It was a little gross.  I think if I left the butter out it would have been perfect.  I love the concept and taste.  My 4yo daughter thought it was hilarious.

I make this all the time with french vanilla pudding, cream cheese, and cool whip. Never used butter and confectioners sugar in it that seems to be too rich.

I haven't tried this recipe yet. But i am curious to know if anybody has tried to make this with real heavy whipped cream instead of cool Whip?
Thanks in advance for all answers... :)

I used to make this for my shop when I was in the Navy. It was a huge hit throughout the squadron as a lot of people would say "I loved that stuff when I was a kid." People who have not tried it would wait outside the shop to see if there were any leftovers, and most ended up walking away empty handed unless I made an extra batch for that purpose.

I just finished making this recipe for a BBQ we are attending today.  
Makes a great impression, however, I didn't really see the need for the confectioners' sugar.  Because there was already so much sugar in this recipe (from the cookies), I purchased sugar-free vanilla pudding.  The consistency of the pudding/cream mixture turned out very sticky/gooey.  I was thinking it would be more pudding-like?  I ended up adding a lot more milk than the recipe called for to get it to be more smooth and creamy.  Also, 32 ounces of cookies...is that an actual measurement, or do you go by the ounces on the package?  If you measure out the Oreos, 1 package is 32oz.  If you go by what the weight of the actual Oreo package, then you need 2 packages.  I used 2 and I had enough.  Same with the pudding.  The biggest box I could find was 1.5oz.  So, I had to purchase about 7 boxes to make 3.5oz.  Again, didn't seem like enough milk for all that, considering the recipe on one 1.5oz. box calls for 3.5 cups of milk.  Granted, you are adding cool whip, butter, etc., but without adding additonal milk, my mixture was too lumpy and sticky.  
All in all, I think it turned out okay with my tweaks.  I thought there was a lot of fuss for what should be a simple recipe.  You could just make instant pudding, add some cool whip and be done.  No need to fuss with the cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter...will try it that way the next time.

4 stars because the dessert isn't as visually appealing as, say, a strawberry and cream topped pound cake - folks were a little hesitant to dig in. But those who did all gave it 4 thumbs up and wanted the recipe. I lessened the sugar by just less than half (so I used somewhere between 1/4 and 3/8 C powdered sugar) but otherwise, recipe was great as is. Would have been fine with the full half cup but when you have all the Oreo and cream in there, you just don't need it.

This was very good, but I think the butter and possibly the cream cheese are unnecessary. Also the amount of Oreos it more than needed, next time I think I would omit the butter and use only 1 package of Oreos (16oz) instead of 2 (32oz);. This recipe makes a lot, I made it in 13x9x3 (deep) dish, and it was overflowing. Don't forget to add some gummy worms between the layers!

Rich, high calorie. However super fun for the kids and adults alike! Uncle Allen said that he seriously thought it was dirt when he saw it and wasn't sure why I was shoveling it out into bowls. LOL.

Too many cookies; starting the layer with the crushed cookies only left a lot of mess on the bottom of the pan, hard to scoop up. Might as well just make pudding and dump crushed cookies on top individually.

This was  fantastic.  I made if for my sons birthday for the family party and for school.  The adults loved it as much, if not more, than the kids.  His birthday is around halloween so I placed it into a small cauldron and had candy eyeballs and body parts lying on top.  It was a hit!!

This cake was delicious and so easy to make.  I took to a birthday party and this cake was more popular than the cake made by a famous bakery in town.  I also made this a lowfat version using fat-free sugar-free cheesecake pudding, lowfat cream cheese, skim milk, and lite cool whip.  Plus, I omitted the butter and it was not missed.  Easy and I will be making again very soon.

I followed this recipe to a T and it's awesome. Next time I will tweak it a bit but I think I'm actually going to do the oppposite of some reviewers. I'll either omit the butter or cut it down to 2-3T and add more whipped cream & maybe cream cheese. I had 2 twelve oz packages of oreos and that was the perfect amount. For those who have had trouble getting a good consistency or say it is too "cream cheesey" you really need to beat the heck out of the stuff with a mixer and get it good and smooth. Then I added the milk & pudding and added the whipped cream last. Then I beat it some more until it was really light & smooth.

Everyone asked if it was edible because it was on the dessert table. Putting the oreos in the food processor got rid of the cream but left the cookies moist felling like real soil. Wonderful.

I actually baked a chocolate cake in a ceramic pot I got at home depot once. It took forever to cook (in the pot, mind you) but was pretty moist...it was for my husbands birthday- it was a...ahem*...pot cake. Lol. Reminds me of this. This is waay easier though.

I've been making this for my son's Earth Day birthday (April 22) since he was in 2nd grade - placed in individual clear 6 oz cups with gummy worms for the kids.  Asked him last night what kind of cake he wanted for his 19th birthday - you guessed it - I'm making Dirt Cake!

I prefer Newman's Own organic cookies (instead of Oreos) to avoid consuming high-fructose corn syrup. And instead of frozen whipped topping (aka Cool Whip), I make cream from heavy whipping cream. Works just fine.   If you don't have a blender or food processor, you can crush them in a KitchenAid stand mixer. I love this stuff.

This was easy and delicious!  Like others, I left out the butter and it was still awesome.  Just don't miss that the recipe calls for 32 oz of oreos, not 32 oreos!

This was super yummy and fun to make. I wish I would have used chocolate pudding, though, to make it look more like dirt. I layered it in clear cups so that my boys could see the dirt and worms, and they thought it was really cool! :)

Yummy! Everyone loved it like usual. 
I made a double batch and it was enough to make a full 9 x 13 and a little round cake pan full too.

everyone loves this recipe!  I use a whole cup of powdered sugar but otherwise, no changes.  for a "sand" version I used 1 box of chocolate pudding and 1 of vanilla for a little something extra with golden oreos and it was very delicious.  this is a great recipe for a picnic or bbq!

You can't go wrong with this dessert.  Even if you leave out the butter or the cream cheese this is still delicious.  I've already used just pudding mix and cool whip and it was a hit. I did find this specific recipe to be the best so far so I didn't eliminate any ingredient.  Again, still would've been very good even if I would've.

You just can't go wrong with this dessert. It's easy, taste great and is perfect for the summer. My husband requested this for his b-day; minus the gummy worms. So I just put it in a trifle bowl and it looked so pretty and elegant!

this is such a cute recipe! I make these in individual cups to serve at school. Another idea to please those not into eating worms... Use vanilla pudding, vanilla crushed cookies for sand instead of dirt, and add a mini coctail umbrella and a square cut from fruit by the foot for a beach blanket. It makes a cute beach scene instead of a dirt and worm scene!

This was so much fun and easy to make. I used only one bag of cookies and added a brownie cake. I used real whipping cream, frozen. A 250 mL serving was the appropriate amount. The finished product was put into a teracotta pot plant with added accessories. My husband and his twin sister loved the birthday surprise, as much as our two infant daughters. Super sweet & rich!

After reading a number of reviews I decided to try out this recipe.  I used 2 packages of Oreos (All I had) and that certainly was plenty.  I prepared this for a group of 10 and there was still some left over.  Awesome Recipe - will certainly make again.  Thanks for Sharing :-)

Yummy,yummy and YUMMY!  I made this as a birthday cake for my one year old (perfect because it is soft) and it was the hit of the party!  I added gummy worms in throughout the layers and got lots of eeeewwwws!!! I also made it in a plastic pot with a few fake sunflowers (stems wrapped in aluminum foil) and it was so cute - it tasted great, too!

Really cute and keeps well.  I made in a 8x8 and put a little dump truck on top.  I made it Friday night.  It's Tuesday afternoon and still great, not soggy at all.  I skipped the butter, used real whippping cream, and 1 6oz package vanilla pudding (calls for 3 cups milk).  Next time I will use lower fat ingredients as this is reeeeeaaaaally rich.  This would be adorable as a graveyard cake for halloween or in a 9x13 with lots of little tractors, and also in a trifle bowl with fresh fruit.  That would cut down on the richness too.  You could also use any flavor pudding - chocolate or banana (or both!) would be good.

Very fun! I remember eating this in Kindergarten and kind of had a lifelong craving for it since. When I made this, my hubby opened the fridge and said "Why is there a pot of dirt in my fridge?" I laughed and told him it was dessert. He said he had also eaten something similar in Kindergarten... Anyway we both loved it! I actually added less Oreos as others suggested and thought it needed more. So maybe about 1 and 1/2 the original amount would be good.

This is really good and so much fun to make with the kids.  I layered it in a clear glass trifle bowl and it looked beautiful.  However, I would cut back on the amount of cookie crumbs the next time.  They soak up the pudding mixture and the chocolate becomes overpowering.  32 oz is two packages of oreo cookies.  I would cut back to 1 bag or no more than 1 1/2 bags the next time.  I had to throw half of it away because by day 2 the cookies had absorbed almost all of the pudding mixture...which is a shame because the pudding mixture is so good.    I also used lite whipped topping, I will use low fat cream cheese the next time as suggested by others as this is a very rich dessert.   Will make again.

This was great.Presentation was excellent too.  Everyone was impressed.  Although I bought a fairly large terra cotta flower pot to make it in and I was afraid it would be way too big, but this cake makes so much it was almost full.  I would suggest making this only when you have a large crowd as it is very rich and makes an awful lot.  Also some of the reviews suggested omitting the butter with the cream cheese and I didn't because it was my first time making this cake and I didn't want to mess it up.  But now after making this and knowing the results I think next time I would definitely leave it out as well as using low fat cream cheese and cool whip, etc.

This was so much fun and so good!  I used a decorative pot, covered part of the stems of real cut flowers with plastic wrap and used as a centerpiece.  I was concerned that it wouldn't be chilled enough so I froze it then arranged the flowers when it was soft enough, was plenty chilled when ready to eat.  My guests got a big kick out of it.

Fun for the kids - a real show stopper.  I put mine in a plastic dump truck.  The taste of the cake is not outstanding, but the effect is awesome.

Was GREAT!!  Made it for 2 4th of July parties this weekend, and came home with the empty bucket both times.  Was a HUGE hit!  Could use more cookies though.  The cookie to pudding ratio wasnt equal

Even though it is very rich, I really enjoyed this. It's simple to make and tastes so good. The only thing I may do differently next time is mix the cookies together with the cream, yet still top with some additional crumbs, rather than do the layers. I've had this served both ways and I think it would be easier to just mix them. Also, I think I'll leave the butter out because I personally didn't think it was needed.

Just make sure you blend the butter and cream cheese a lot, or else there's tiny lumps of them in the dirt.

Great Dessert!  I made this for a church supper.  The adults were coming back saking for more.  I made this with white chocolate pudding.  Kinda taste like a melted ice-cream sandwich.

This isn't for two people, its for a party! I made it to have something cold and fun at Thanksgiving. Using the cheesecake pudding gives it a tasty zing. I am glad I am not the only one to put it in a plain glass bowl! Its great.

Great recipe!  I made this recipe for my son's class party (he is 12).  He said that it was gone in 30 seconds!  He was able to try some and proclaimed it to be "gourmet"!  I'm going to make it again so I can try it :-)

Made  this cake for my grandson and placed it in his new truck.  He loved it and the family was amazed.  However, making it on the same day proved to be very messy.  But the next day it was much better to eat and tasted so much better.  Everything melded together and tasted much better  .  Thanks for the great idea.

I used this recipe for my son's first birthday. What better than a dirt cake for your first cake? The kids loved it but the parents RAVED about it. We ended up using a potato masher to crush the cookies with though because we don't have a food processor. It was a great cake!

I made this recipe for my son's 3rd birthday party that had a construction theme.  I made the recipe with chocolate pudding and about 20 ounces of Oreos, then I layered the cookies and pudding mixture in the back of a clean Tonka dump truck lined with Saran wrap.  I topped off the dirt cake with small construction vehicles.  The kids and the adults loved the idea and it tasted so good!

I made this for my sons 2nd birthday. It was a construction theme-so the 'dirt cake' worked well in a pan. I used cheesecake pudding as someone suggested and wouldnt do that again. Wasnt near as tasty as vanilla pudding!

This was one I always wanted to do so I found the recipe here and made it for a BBQ at a friend's house.  My kids loved helping with it and were very impressed by what it looked like when complete.  Everyone loved it!  My only suggestion would be that you could probably use about 1/2 the amount of cookies as the recipe calls for.  In addition, don't try to do this one as a quicky.  Depending on how fussy you are about the presentation, you may need to stop at 2-3 stores before you get what you need (flower pot, garden tools for serving, artificial flowers, gummy worms and other ingredients).

I've made the dirt cake before and it's always been a hit.  Last time, however, I
made it with a twist.  For my son's beach birthday party I used white creme cookies
instead of Oreos and put it in a sand bucket with a shovel for serving.  I adorned
with small plastic crabs found at the dollar store.  Parents and children alike loved it!!

I didn’t add the powder sugar, and I only used about 20 oz of Oreos.  It was a hit at the party.  I didn’t add sugar accidentally, and it was still delicious.  I plan on making it without sugar from now on just to cut down on sugars.

Very good as is but when I made it a second time I followed someone's advice of omitting the stick of butter and adding just a few tablespoons of milk to help mix the cream cheese. This is the way to go! Did not miss the butter one bit! That I think propels it to 5 stars for the obvious decrease in calories.

The batter tastes like pure lard with all that butter and the finished product just tastes like a bowl of sugar. I mixed chocolate and French vanilla for a more "muddy" look that also tastes better than plain vanilla. As for the amount of cookies, I probably could have used more, though this could be due to one or both of the following: 1) the batter was too rich so thicker layers of cookie crumbs would have served to break up the lard consistency of the batter. 2)  I manually crushed the Oreos, so they may not have been as fine as they would be had I used a food professor.

We tweaked it a bit and eliminated the butter. It is always a huge hit. A couple of tips: Add a half teaspoon of mint extract, mint oreos and some green food coloring for a great mint dirt cake. (about 60 drops of green food coloring = the color of the mint oreo filling. Still experimenting and haven't converted that to a measurement yet.) Another tip is don't use anything fat free. I tried it with fat free cream cheese and it did not set up. The silver lining, though, was that in the freezer it froze to about the consistency of a low fat ice cream cake. My wife said, for a summer treat, this might actually be better than a traditional dirt cake! Oh well, back to the lab (kitchen) for more experiments!

Easy and delicious, turned out perfect. I made it according to recipe, but begin layers with the white mixture. I will definitely use this recipe each time I need to make dirt cake. I garnished it by inserting a flower into the bowl, and I attached another flower to the serving spoon. Looks (and tastes) great!

This was a huge hit especially with the kids. The flavor was amazing! I doubled it for a huge family gathering and it was shoveled down in one sitting.

I make this all the time and get rave reviews!  I add gummy worms and serve in a sand pail with a shovel. I read one reviewer saying to cut it by half and not use as many cookies...it depends on the container you are putting it in.  For a standard sand pail I use the whole recipe. I have also had it with chocolate pudding it was too rich for me.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I made individual servings in clear cups. It yielded 15 servings. I probably could have gotten 16-18 if I hadn't been so generous with the first few that I filled.

This recipe is always a big hit. My middle son has asked for it as his birthday cake three times now in the past 4 years. The only thing I change is that I use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.

I made this recipe using gluten-free chocolate sandwich cookies (for my son) and brought to a super bowl party.  This recipe yields a huge amount but, even so, when I went to get a taste, it was all gone!!! Everyone was asking for the recipe.  The only thing I would change is I only put one gummy worm for decoration in the middle of the bowl as my daughter almost choked on a worm during a test run for the recipe.  Love this dessert!!

Fun and delicious cake. 32oz of cookies is basically one normal package of oreo cookies. I used gummy worms in our cake.

I made this recently for a work baby shower for a baby girl, instead of Oreo's I used the Strawberry Sugar Wafers and bought some candy baby feet to sprinkle in.....it was a major hit & the Strawberry Sugar Wafers were great in it!!  Very cute & I was very proud of my baby shower version!

Great recipe!  Brought it to a party and everyone loved it!  Notes: (1)I didn't have a food processor, just a Magic Bullet.  I crushed most of the cookies by hand (put them in a plastic bag and smashed them), but did the top layer with the Magic Bullet- that gave the top layer a much more realistic 'dirt' look.  (2) This fit perfectly into a disposable aluminum chicken roaster pan.

This makes a great pirate map as well.  In a flat pan do one half as sand and the other as dirt.  Instead of worms hide pirate booty/chocolate coins and add some colored coconut for water and grass.  Of course you need to use candies to lead to your "x" marks the spot. Very fun!

Absolutely delicious!  Made it for a baby shower with a "snakes & snails" theme and it was just perfect. Everyone loved it.  It is very sweet and rich, next time I may omit the powdered sugar in the cream mixture as the oreos are plenty sweet on their own and it all ends up mixing together on the plate.

Although the filling was not really to my taste (not really into cream fillings) and I had to really search high and low to find anything close to the ingredients here in Germany, everyone else thought it was fantastic. The kids in my class loved it and so did my fiancé. I would make it again for them.

Really love this recipe for fun for kids you can also add gummy worms half hanging out your top layer. I don't recommend layering them in though because they will melt in the cake from the moisture

I used this recipe as a starting point for a dirt cake that I made for a spring-themed baby shower this weekend.  I doubled the recipe, used half the amount of butter called for, 3 packages of chocolate pudding and 1 package of vanilla pudding, and a little less Cool Whip.  I bought two packs of Oreos- one regular and one with chocolate cream.  I did a little layering, adding a bit of crushed oreos in between the pudding layers.  I also threw in some gummy worms.  Everyone loved it.  It is very rich, though, so be warned!

This dessert looked absolutely adorable! I thought the recipe would just be okay, but was pleasantly surprised because it tasted so yummy too! It made a cute Easter dessert, and received great reviews from my guests. We used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. Also, not having a food processer, we crushed our Oreos in a freezer bag with a rolling pin. Worked great! I will definitely take the advice of other reviewers, and make this again with the reverse-Oreos and a sand pail for our upcoming beach vacation. SO CUTE! I highly recommend this recipe!

I made the dirt cake for halloween. I put it in a large bowl with Candy tombstones from a sweet shop, Candy hands and gummy worms coming out of the dirt. It looked like a mini cemetary. Everyone said it looked so cool they didn't want to eat it, but when they did finally break into everyone enjoyed it.. It was gone very quick..Thank you for sharing

I have made this for years. My family LOVES it. They are always requesting it at family get togethers. I have, however, made a lighter version. Low fat/lite on everything. I made 2 pans of this one time. One was low fat, the other was the regular recipe. Most everyone preferred the low fat version.

Great recipe! I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, and next time I think I'll cut out the confectioners sugar. but over all it turned out beautiful. I also put mine in the freezer to help it set up faster. :)

Fun recipe!  I made some modifications by following the suggestions of some other reviewers: 1) used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, and 2) used only 1/4 c. powdered sugar.  Loved it!

SO GOOD for such simple ingredients.  I layered the ingredients in a terra cotta pot, decorated with gummy worms, and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  I omitted the butter and sugar and it tasted perfect that way.

I only rated this recipe a four and I have made dirt for years. The reason for the four is 3 1/2 cups of milk seems alot, I usually use 1 1/2 cups of milk along with 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. My consistency comes out thick and I think the 3 1/2 cups of milk would make the cream more on the thin side. Maybe it's my personal preference, but I just couldn't pour all that milk.

So delicious! I used only 1 package of oreos and it was plenty (noticed it was less than 32 oz). Next time I will omit the butter, I don't think its necessary.

Just as FABULOUS as what I remember as a kid!  I like to mix the cream mixture in my food processor and then pour in some of the pudding mixture and blend it together.  This make the cream mixture easier to wisk in without lumps.

According to hubby this was EXCELLENT! Almost-5-yr-old daughter LOVED it! Served it as treat for her class, complete with gummy worms.  I omitted the butter (it wasn't necessary) and used my mixer to mix everything together: no lumps!

I give this 4 out of 5. The reason is because I've had it before (in high school in the cafeteria of all places) and it was better. They used more whipped cream and it was lighter and not so rich.

The Novelty of this recipe gets 5 stars; preschoolers at my son's school loved it. The taste, however, gets 3 stars. It's just like eating pudding and oreos. Good, but very normal...nothing spectacular.

I had never made dirt cake before but have eaten it many times.  This recipe is very good, BUT you need to let it sit overnight.  We made it last evening and only let it sit about 2-3 hours.  It was very sweet tasting and the cookie part wasn't right.  Then we ate it today and it was fantastic.  SO, I just suggest making sure you allow time to let it cool for atleast 12 hours so it has time to set and the cookie part gets soft.

If I could I would give this 10 stars.  This cake was so easy to make and so good!  :)  I didn't change a thing.  We made a flower patch out of fruit and put it in the "dirt" for my girlfriend's birthday.  Delicious!

I made this for my Halloween party and it was a hit!  I used red and yellow food coloring to turn the filling orange and did orange and black layers in a clear glass dish.  I used fudge oreos that are an oval shape for tombstones and added some gummy worms for extra creepiness.  This was the first dish gone!!

This cake is always a winner.  I omitted the butter based on another review and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  I made my cake in a 13x9 pan instead of a deeper bowl.  If I make it again in the same pan I will make more of the cream cheese mixture and only use one package of cookies.  I have A LOT of crumbs leftover, but I had to stretch the cream cheese mixture to complete the layering.  I also used reduced fat Oreos, reduced fat cream cheese, Splenda for baking, and fat free Cool Whip.  No one noticed a difference.

I first had this as a child at a block party.  I made this for two different 4th of July BBQ's and it was(as always)a hit.  I, myself, could just eat the pudding part without the cookies!!  I always use chocolate pudding, instead of vanilla.  I didn't realize that 32 oz of cookies was actually two packages, so I used less cookies and it was still great!

AWESOME!

Everyone loved this, first birthday cake. I made it like the TONKA truck one and used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. It was nice because the whipped topping took away that really sweet chocolatey taste.

I did make my own whipped topping (just heavy whipping cream and 1 tsp vanilla). I mixed as directed except I mixed the milk and pudding with the cream cheese mix. THEN, I folded in the whipping cream. The pudding ended up being light and creamy - delish!

You can even use your whist and fluff up the Cool Whip and fold in for the same effect.

This was very good....but make sure not to go too thick on the bottom two layers of cookie crumbs.  I didn't save enough for the top to completely cover it..giving the appeal of dirt. Whoops.

fun dessert to bring to a function that has kids at it.  they all know what 'Dirt Cake' is and they all gather around waiting for their serving of dirt and worms.  easy recipe for my 11 yr old to do (with me looking over his shoulder). taste is great and it's very filling.

I made this recipe and use a med. size flower pot and used the lid of the coolwhip container to place at the bottom to cover the holes in the flower pot. I put in a plastic flower. It looked realistic! Everyone loved it.

This was a fun recipe to make.  Tasted wonderful too.  I put it in a pot and planted an artificial flower in it with a new clean spade.  The kids thought we were crazy when we started dishing up potting soil.

Yum! I made this last night for a Halloween party tonight. I only added 1/4 cup sugar, because 1/2 cup just seemed like a lot. Also, I left out the butter because I didn't see any point in adding all that extra fat. The filling came out really tasty and I made it in a flower pot so it looks like real dirt. Definitelty fold the cool whip in after you mix the pudding and make sure the cream cheese is very soft.We'll see if everyone eats it up tonight!

This was FABULOUS!  I made it for my daughter's garden theme birthday party and it went FAST!  This weekend I'll be making it and putting a "graveyard" on top for my son's Halloween birthday party.  My mouth is already watering.

I used everything but the cream cheese (I don't like cheese of any kind) and it turned out great!!  I used low fat and sugar free ingredients whenever possible.  Fake flowers, a flower pot and worms make this a huge hit, especially with the kids!  Great recipe - Thanks!

Very good. I left out the butter and used low-fat versions of all ingredients and you couldn't tell a difference. I might try it with chocolate pudding next time instead of vanilla.

Fabulous!  Brought it for a work potluck, and most people thought it was a real flower pot.  It was definitely the hit of the party.  I used my store-brand sandwich cookies w/mint cream.  Added a perfect minty taste, but not overwelming.  I didn't use the gummy worms (they turn all gooey).

I made this for my step-sons 10th birthday party. As it is not really a cake I used a brownie mix for the base, so that it was more like a cake and baked as directed in an 15x10 pan, I then followed the recipe exactly but I did not layer the filling and cooking crumbs. I did not use gummy worms, I started to use them, but when I took one out to put it somewhere different and tasted it, it was disgusting with chocolate! There were only 10 people here, but the whole cake is gone!! Will definately make this again, it is perfect for a boy party, wspecially if you use "bugs".

I love this recipe and have been making it for years.  I've used fat free cream cheese, fat free cool whip etc with no problems too.
I never serve it in a flower pot, just a really deep bowl.

I love this recipe.  I have taken it to many pot lucks and I never have leftovers.  The only difference between my recipe and this one is I use 1/2 stick of butter and 1 cup powdered sugar.  Great recipe!

A favorite of my dh but not for those watching their waistlines.  A good treat but no need to add the butter and one package of sandwich cookies works for my dish - don't try to use low fat!  You can use lower fat cream cheese and whipped topping but not fat free.

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  This was super easy to make and absolutely delicious! I made it for a co-worker who is diabetic and substituted Splenda for the confectioner's sugar and it was still great!  I used a 10" terra cotta pot and lined it with tin foil.  It was way too big!  So my only advice is to use a pot smaller than 10" and get a plastic one if you can!  This was a great recipe and I'll definitely be making again!

THIS WAS AWESOME! Exactly the way I remember it as a kid. My boyfriend kept asking me why I had a pot of soil in the refrigerator! I used chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla and added gummy worms just before serving. This recipe is a winner and I will definitely be making it at least once a month! Thank you Tammy!

For the container, you can also use a sand bucket with a shovel. Instead of flowers, I use gummy worms. I also add two cups of already made chocolate pudding to the mixture so it looks like mud!

Love it!  I put it in a triffle bowl, and it even looked pretty.  It was really rich, but as long as you dont eat it all at once, you should be good :).

Updated since last review of 2005....it is now 3 years later and I made this for Easter this time.  I used the Golden Oreo's with green food coloring added to the blend when processing.  I put various candy on the top as you would fill an Easter basket.  It's a great theme cake. I'm taking this to an Easter gathering tomorrow.  I'm sure the kids and moms there will be as impressed as I am.  By the way, many years ago I took this cake to a company picnic in a flower pot with a flower and a spade, etc.  People actually put out their cigarettes in my cake!  It DID win 1st prize at that event! LOL  3/10/05 review: I made this for a co-worker that does not eat sugar.  I used sugar-free cookies, sugar-free pudding and subbed Splenda for the powdered sugar.  Even without using sugar it was very good.  It even passed my kids taste test.

This is perfect for so many occassions.  My husband even takes a triple batch in a huge flower pot to work for special occasions.  Try using the chocolate cookie/chocolate filling cookies, it makes for a richer chocolate taste.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  The use chocolate pudding instead of vanilla though.  Also, the last time I made it I used reduced fat cream cheese and fat free, sugar free pudding and I think it tasted just as good.

This is heavenly!!  I've never made a dirt cake before and I must say this was very easy and turned out WONDERFUL!!  I didn't use 32 oz of cookies though.  Probably 1 package to 1 1/2 is good enough.  EXCELLENT!!!

Made this for friends and they loved it.  I liked it a lot, but think its still missing a little that extra thing that makes it great.  I ended up needing about 10 extra cookies, maybe I made too many layers, but when eating the ratio seemed good.

This went over very well at my family Easter dinner.  Although noone would try it until i ate some to prove it wasnt actual dirt. But after i ate some they finally started eating it.  They all loved the flower and trowel in the flower pot.

We were looking for a new recipe and we didn't have a great deal of time to put anything together. We found this recipe and decided to try it.  Very easy to put together, even though
it was  messy, but it was the hit of the party.  We added some gummy worms and the kids came up with the idea of making flowers out of gum drops and toothpicks.

I made this for a memorial day camping trip and everyone loved it, my only complaint is I CAN'T STOP EATING IT!!!!!  Next time I make it I am going to try it with lite cream cheese, cool-whip etc. to keep the guilt away.

I made this for some friends while living in Germany.  The group consisted of Germans, Iranians, English, Spaniards, and Russians.  None had ever heard of dirt cake.  They all LOVED it!  At first they were confused about a cake that looked like dirt in a flower pot with worms and flowers (there was an international miscommunication) they all "dug in" with gusto!
Thanks so much for the recipe!!

this was an awesome idea. i loved the idea, but didn't use the same filling recipe. instead, i layered vanilla icecream, chocolate fudge syrup and oreo cookie crumbs. it was a hit at a birthday party i threw for my 12 year old sister. they were in awe about it. you can also make your own plastic flower with construction paper and a straw. i thought ice cream might go over better with them than the filling in the original recipe.

This is cute also as a sand box dessert.  Use graham cracker crumbs instead of chocolate cookie.  I've also used this at football parties.  I purchased football cake decorations.  I put graham crackers on the bottom of a 13x9in. pan, poured in the cream mixture and topped it with graham cracker crumbs.  Over the graham crackers, I poured green sugar crystals.  Using white tube frosting, I drew on the yard lines to make it look like a football field and then added the caketop decorations!  Really cute and yummy football party dessert!

The pudding mixture is just sweet enough and it was creamier than when I have made it in the past. Very excited to eat it for our birthday celebration.

I make this twice a year once at Christmas and then at Easter my grand boys love it and always ask for it but it is rich and their mom try's to limit sugar. I tried several others years ago but this one is the best and so easy. The only thing I change is the middle layer I use a layer of cho. pudding. It looks so nice in my glass bowl.

I used golden Oreos to simulate ice since I was making a hockey rink and also they were the thins so less filling to speckle.

I followed the comments and didn’t add the powdered sugar.  It was plenty sweet.  I like the butter included vs removing and adding milk.  It adds a complexity to the flavor.  Others noted that the recipe calls for too many cookies.  I just chopped up what I needed, which was about half of what it called for.  I recommend this dish.  It’s easy and good.

This recipe is my go to potluck dish. I get so many compliments every time I make this one co-worker once called it the “heavenly chocolate dessert”... but no matter what you call it, it is certainly one of my favorite dessert recipes. However I normally just use one normal sized package if Oreos per batch.

I make this for pot lucks using a trifle bowl so you can see the layers.   I omit the butter and powdered sugar, don't think it needs it.   I also put fresh flowers on the top using floraI water 
 tubes (sterilized of course). Always come home with an empty bowl.

The cake was very tasty! If you put gummy worms on the top or inside of the layered cake it would look more realistic.

I made this for a work potluck, and it was a big hit. This is so good and a good conversation piece as well. And really easy to put together.  You can use tin foil to line the pot or in this case I use a  Crockpot Liner. To keep it from sliding I lined the edge up around the pot so it would overhang too much and a  few strips of two sided sticking tape. You can get a beach shovel, a plastic flower, and gummy worms from the dollar store,  I stuck the flower in between the liner and the pot so it could stay in place during the serving of it. Big winner and will make again.

Made according to recipe - delicious! More fluffy, creamy, and interesting flavor than pudding alone! Made a small one with glutino cookies for my gluten free friend.

it is too sweet for me, and I only used 1/3 cup sugar. But I needed a theme kitty litter cake. only difference was top layer was a mixture of Graham crackers and oreos, and I used mini twix instead of worms. I also mixed a few of the oreo crumbs into the pudding.

I used this recipe for may daughters first birthday and it was a HUGE hit. I added "magic mushrooms" (mini marshmellows on a toothpick topped with a strawberry) and it couldn't have been cuter. Everyone asked me where I got the recipe!

This is a terrific recipe, a favorite with our grandson.  He always requests it for his birthday cake.  I don't make any changes to the recipe.   My daughter and I make a fun optional version of this on Halloween.  We put it in a sheet cake pan and add candy skeleton pieces emerging and Milano cookies standing upright with writing on them to look like tombstones - Presto!  A Halloween graveyard cake - great fun for your Halloween party.

Very good! Would try chocolate pudding next time. Didn’t own a food processor, so chopping the ores was a bit tedious. Didn’t have enough Oreo for top layer, so mixed some chocolate Oreo graham cracker crumbs in, which made it look great.

Great recipe.  I took some advice from previous reviews and made just a few changes.  
I let the cream cheese sit out to soften a bit and then mixed the milk in really well with a handheld mixer.  I then added the 2-boxes of instant pudding and mixed again.  I set that aside and worked on the whip cream.  
I’m not a fan of cool whip so I put a tablespoon of powdered sugar into 16-oz heavy whipping cream and mixed that until stiff.  I then folded the pudding/cream cheese/ milk combo into the heavy whipping cream and let that hang out in the fridge until we I had the Oreos ready to go.  
I used regular Oreos vs double stuff so I’d get more of a dirt effect.  I did the food processor method and then layered as suggested and placed gummy worms intermittently.  We have a flower pot we use each time we make this and finish it off with fake flowers saved for this too.

The flavor of the pudding and cheese mix is really good.  I used it in individual cups for a school snack.  I think the kids will love it!!!

Good, but I don't understand why you need to add butter and cream cheese to this. It works fine without, and when I mixed them together, I ended up with gross butter lumps scattered throughout. Elgh.

I have been making this for years but have never added the sugar or butter and it is great without it. I am making it today for my brother. This is a great recipe either way. Also, for the ones complaining about boiling the pudding,..the recipe clearly state to use INSTANT pudding! There is no stove needed for this recipe!! Read and focus people...lol

I used dark chocolate pudding instead of vanilla - made it really rich. This is so much fun to make with kids - we added gummy worms as decorations.

I used this recipe  as a starting point to make a few changes.  I used the butter called for and Instead of a block of cream cheese I bought a whipped cream cheese. Instead of store bought "READY WHIP" I used homemade, hand whipped, heavy whipping cream *I found the recipie at allrecipes.com. I split this whipped cream between both a milk chocolate, and a dark chocolate pudding. I also split the cream cheese and butter mixture between the two pudding flavors. This added a few extra steps but well worth the effort for real whipped cream and the effect of layering the two chocolates. This is all  I changed otherwise I followed the directions indicated in this recipe. 
I Garnished it with sour gummie worms and a pretty purple silk flower.
It was a hit and everyone requested i make it again soon

This was amazing. I didn't use a food processor for the cookies. Just smashed them with a rolling pin. I think I prefer it that way so there are still chunks. I also used a 9x13 pan instead of a flower pot. I thought it was going to be too much, but it fit perfectly! Will definitely make again.

Took it to a Halloween content and won second place, off of looks but received so many compliments about the taste.  I believe it would have won first if we voted after we tasted.

Just a warning, any plastic container that isn´t specifically made for food should be lined before putting food in it.  Chemicals can leak out of all other plastics and can be dangerous when consumed.    The same problem came up years ago with the "cat litter cake".  Remember, if it´s not made for food, line it first. This is especially important if children will be consuming it.

I'm from Kansas, and we used to make this ALL the time - it was a standard at parties.  We called it "Kansas Dirt."  Anyhoo, I have been looking for a recipe similar to what my mom used to make, and this is it!  This makes an extremely rich, decadent desert.  A small portion goes a long way, but everyone loves it!  I use a little less milk and chocolate pudding (instead of vanilla) to make my "mud" thicker.

Very nice recipe.  My 2 year old daughter loved making this "cake" along with me for her daddy's birthday.  She loved putting the dirt and worms on the cake.  Everyone really enjoyed this dessert and it was perfect for a halloween birthday.  We just put in in a large cake pan, layered it as directed, and then spelled out "Happy Birthday Dad" with the gummy worms.  Great easy recipe!

Kids loved it. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the calorie intake. I had to cut the portions in half.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! I made this for my mom's surprise 50th/ Halloween party and it was the only dessert that had no leftovers! I followed the recipe exactly and the cream cheese/ pudding mixture was perfect with the chocolate cookies. I made it in a foil tin and added marshmallow gravestones, ghost peeps, and gummy worms. It was adorable, really wish I had taken a picture!

this was a huge hit at the office family Halloween party today.  We used Milano cookies as grave stones & made the ghosts/guys coming out of the ground out of marshmallows (covered with cocoa powder).  I omitted the butter & confectioners sugar.  Didn't miss those ingredients one bit.  Also used fat free/sugar free pudding & cool whip.  Thank you for the recipe Tammy!

I made the recipe with one vanilla and did a chocolate one too.  The vanilla seemed to be the hit in our house.  I'm keeping this recipe forever in my private cookbook!

I double the cream cheese and only use 1/3 cup of sugar to make it a little thicker and less sweet. But other than that follow this one. Comes out great!

My parents love when I make this recipe! If you omit the cookies, the filling ends up tasting like a delicious mousse... you can exchange the pudding for any flavor and it always has a yummy, creamy texture to it. I like to use chocolate pudding..definitely a keeper!

This is one of the best and easiest. I agree with another reviewer if you have a non heavy duty food processor like I do then you should break them up in a bag and then crumble in the processor.  This reminded my of a day at elementry school and we all brought a treat.  I loved this and this was just like I remeber twenty years ago.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I've never made this but have had it over the years, and it was so easy to make and turned out great.  I put it in a flower pot with a fake flower and little garden trowel and everyone thought I was so "crafty"..HA!  It went over really well.  I will surely make this again.  I even used sugar-free french vanilla pudding and whipped topping, and it tasted just as good as the real thing.  Can't wait to make this for a summer party using the vanilla sandwich cookies so it looks like sand and I can put it in a pail with a shovel and shells :-)

I made this for my son's third birthday party, and it was a huge hit! It was very easy to make - instead of using a flower pot, I doubled the recipe and made the layers in the back of a large dump truck (the theme of the party was construction vehicles) and it worked out perfectly!

This recipe was delicious! I brought it to an adult-only halloween party and it was a huge hit. I decorated it using Milano cookies as gravestones and various gummie worms, spides, and slugs. I'll definitely be making this again!

Great recipe, but I didn't notice you needed to have 2 packages of vanilla pudding mix, so I used 1 of vanilla and one of chocolate, which turned out great! It was a hit at the office... dorky I know. Thanks!

I have been making this for years and am just now getting around to rating it.  What a great recipe.  It is fun and easy. I use a glass vase so you can see the layers better.  In the spring I put in some chocolate in the shape of tulips wrapped in yellow foil (you can get them at most candy shops) or roses. Typically the adults pick out the worms so I don't add that many.

I made this recipe for my son's 2nd birthday party and everyone just loved them. I made half with Oreo cookies to resemble dirt and the other half with Nilla wafers to resemble sand. I didn't use a flower pot just clear plastic cups and put a single gummy worm in each cup. I thought they would be really rich but they were absolutely perfect! The pudding mixture is incredible. I will for sure be making more of this!

This recipe was great!  I had to improvise due to poor planning: I had only 1 large and 1 small box of pudding mix (the small was sugar-free) so I reduced the milk to just 3 cups.  It turned out SOO great - so creamy and yummy!  For some reason, the creamy portion reminded me of tiramisu (in texture) and I couldn't get enough.  My family devoured this dessert!

You can see my pictures and if you want real black dirt I too would use chocolate pudding but this was soooo good I planted a tomato instead of a flower since my theme was gardening.

Great recipe! Fun for the kids! Made in a terra cotta pot with my neices, they loved the idea of a dirt cake with worms too! Simple ingredients.  I had bought a medoim-large flower pot, but still had enough after filling that to make a small side bowl. Next time will make with chocolate pudding! Yum!

The cake was a great addition to a sweet table! At first I was sceptical to the recipe because I dont like those sandwich cookies, but I wanted to make something different and surprise my nephew and others.  I made it for my nephew's 4th birthday. As soon as he saw me walking with the cake he wanted to carry it to the table, so we both put it on the table with other sweets and fruits. Then his mom was like, why would you put that plant there... so she wanted to take it away... so we told her its a cake. When my nephew was picking up a worm out of "dirt" his older brother started warning him not to touch the dirt...  It was so cute, and all the guests were surprised, some daddies were afraid to try it, we had to convince them it was a cake... Will make it again!

I made this for my son's birthday party.  I made individual cups so each kid could have some.  It turned out great.  All the kids (and parents) gobbled it up.  Though to me the cake tasted just like a really good oreo.  So I gave this a 4 because making the cake was hard work just to re-create the oreos I began with.

I made this for 2 occasions now, and at first it sat for a long time because no one realized it was dirt cake! Once they found out, I was standing in line to get some before it was gone! This was very very good. I made just like the recipe called for. It was the first dessert gone at the family gathering!

Oh my goodness! I take this dish occasionally for our church pot lucks and it just disappears the second it is set out. I've made it for the last 3 of my kids' birthdays instead of cake because they like it so much more. EVERYONE loves this dessert. I don't change a single thing and can't count the number of times I've given out this recipe!

A coworker made this for an office party, and I thought it was such a cute idea!! Just the display was impressive- I would not have guessed it was food at first! The dirt pie was delicious though, and was gone by the end of the day. She left the gummy worms out, although I'm sure they'd be great for kids. Also she did a low fat version- I am sure the regular is just as flavorful! I will definitely make this for the next bbq, party, etc. I go to.

This created such a sensation here in Germany! Everyone thought I had just brought a potted plant to the picnic potluck. I was a little nervous about the taste because I had never made it before and I haven't eaten dirt cake for YEARS! But it was perfect...just like I remembered!  Will definitely make again.

Made this for my little girl to take to preschool for birthday snack, I used little cups and I am told that it was a hit with the little ones. My little girl didn’t like the worms in them but the other kids did. I also used a white chocolate chip and M & M’s to make a little flower on top. My only issue was it took me to long to make in little cups so next time I will make in a pail, flower pot, or dump truck. Like others I didn’t use the butter. It was fun and I will make this again.

The kids loved this, and it's something unique...so I'll be making it again.  I did use about 1/4 the amount of sugar the recipe calls for, so I think the full amount would have been way too much. Lining the pot with foil was a little tricky, but I wouldn't have served it to anyone without doing that first (the terra cotta has an odd odor, even after washing it).  I ended up following another reviewer's advice: turn the pot upside down and lay foil across it (may have to do one sheet and then another diagonally across that) to make a mold of the shape of the pot.  Then remove that, turn the pot over, and put the shaped foil into the inside of the pot.  To make this work, I made the foil sheets extra long and then trimmed the excess so that it was just below the top of the pot and wouldn't show.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe!  I only used one stick of butter and it turned out great.  I served it in a cute flower pot with some fake flowers on April Fool's Day and my husband had no idea until I stuck the spoon down in it that it was fake.

I made this for my neighbor for April Fool's Day.  I did not alter the recipe and it was VERY SWEET!  I think that was part of the fun--giving it to my neighbor's kids with tons of sugar.  If I make this again, I would decrease the sugar and butter or perhaps replace it with the remainder of the cool whip that was leftover.  I lined my flower pot with pink saran wrap and cut the flowers into individual stems and attached them to plastic spoons with green floral tape.  It provides a great presentation and not too expensive but it has tons of sugar!  Loved it!

Three Words - MORE GUMMY WORMS!  My friends love the taste of the gummy worms with each bite.  I could only eat one serving, cause I knew that this recipe was 3000 calories with every bite.  I will make this dessert next time I hate someone who is skinny!

Great recipe, made this for my daughter's birthday and now everyone asks me to bring this. I've tried this with other flavors of oreos and it works just as well. The original I believe is still the best.

Due to allergies, I made a dairy free version of this and it was to die for. I used a soy version of the whipped topping and chocolate pudding and my whole family loved it. Thank you so much for this great recipe.

This turned out perfect!  I think next time I will play around with a low cal variation of it.  Maybe low fat cream cheese, sugar free pudding, skim milk, no butter.

great cake and the grandkids loved it - no left overs.  I used a recipe years ago which called for chocolate wafer cookies.  They are not easy to find but worth the hunt so scour the cookie section.  I found them way up on the top shelf in my super market after I had made the cake.  Go figure!!!

Great recipe and a big hit for Halloween parties. The only thing I did different was I used chocolate pudding. After all it's supposed to be dirt, >:-D

This was a very big hit at our Halloween party. I put holes in the plastic pumpkin and let the worms hang out. Delicious.

Made this as alternative to the regular b-day cake for my sons b-day. The kids all loved it, and I would definitely make this again.

I didnt follow this recipe very closely so I cant review it but I would like to pass on some tips. Freezing the cookies first makes grinding them very easy. I think the purpose of the butter and sugar is to cut the cream cheese into a consistency that will mix with the pudding otherwise it would be lumpy. I used a mixer to beat in a heaping spoon of whipped topping at a time. That mixed with the pudding fairly well with few lumps. I just couldn't bring myself to add more fat and sugar to this.

it was ok. it was really nothing more than a cream with cookies. i was hoping for more of a wow, but didn't get it. also hardly nobody ate any at Thanksgiving. there were about 20 people and only 1/10 of it was gone. :( disappointed.

I used choc pudding, very rich, very good.  Don't know how thick other people do their cookie layers, but I had way too many cookies, half would have been plenty, especially if you put it in a child's sand bucket like I did.   Next time I'm going to put it in a 13x9 pan for Thanksgiving desert.

SOOO GREAT! Everyone loved it. Even people who said they didn't like vanilla pudding liked this. I didn't have butter so I didn't use it. Actually turned out better-- less fattening. Great recipe!

I used all chocolate pudding since I'm a huge chocolate lover.  I was so full from dinner, I barely had room to try this and though I wasn't wowed by it - I think it mostly because I was too full to enjoy it because everyone else loved it.  I might try it with vanilla pudding next time, but I'm pretty sure I will leave out the butter, I don't really see what the need for it is.  I think it will be fine without it.

Made this for a cake walk at the kids school, very easy.  I used chocolate instant pudding instead of vanilla.  I decorated it with marshmellow ghosts and pumpkins.  I plan on making individual ones for my daughters party.  Thank you for an awsome idea!

I made this instead of a traditional cake for my two year old son's birthday.  It was definitely a hit and very little boy with the removal of the flower and addition of some gummy worms.

This was great, though I'd suggest eating it soon after you make it.  I made it around 6 pm and by noon the next day, it was pretty soggy.  I layered cookies, all whipped mixture and cookies on top - this is full to the top of a regular 9x13 pan.  I used light whipped topping, sugar free pudding, and skim milk (reg cream cheese, butter, and oreos).  This is plenty rich so next time I'll reduce the butter and try reduced fat oreos.

I'm not a cream cheese fan with desserts, but the cream filling in this dessert is absolutely delicious. I split my recipe in half and hopefully my colleagues will enjoy this dessert tomorrow.

We made this for my daughter's 4th birthday and both my kids (who love anything sweet) found this too be too rich to eat more than a few bites. However, if you are serving a lot of people this makes a lot of servings.

Made this for my daughter's 4th birthday and it was a big hit with both kids and parents!  I put it in individual cups for each child and topped it with an artifical flower and some worms...they had a blast eating it!  I put all the "leftovers" into a bigger bowl and topped with an artificial flower bouquet and served to the parents.  Not only is it a fun idea - it's very delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly and this was the grand finale at a friend & family BBQ last night.  A plastic sand pail and gummy worms added to the overall appeal.  The kids loved it - all of them had Oreo mustaches and goatees.  The adults loved it too.  I have once again secured my title as "favorite" aunt.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was awesome.  I made it for my daughter's birthday party and I was surprised there were a lot of people there who didn't even know what a dirt cake was!  You definitely have to go the 'whole nine yards' and get a pot and a fake flower to sit on top of it.  We got both at the 99 Cent store and it was well worth it for 'effect'!

My husband came home for lunch and said it would be nice to have dirt cake tonight. I guess I will be going to the store. THANKS!!!

This recipe is a favorite for children and adults!  I'm not sure if it's necessary to add the butter/cream cheese/sugar mixture to the pudding mixture, therefore, next time I'll try making it without it.

I made this with my Jr.High Foods class for April Fools Day.  Each student brought in a small pot so they could take them some home. They had lots of fun "fooling" the other students during the day!

This is a great recipe that tastes great and looks fun! I made mine for easter, so I dyed coconut green and hid malted milk ball eggs in the "grass." I also made mine sugar free by substituting sugar free white chocolate pudding, sugar free cool whip, and sugar free oreos. I used Splenda in place of the sugar. The sugar free version tastes even better than the original! It's great for diabetics.

My son requested dirt cake for his 10th birthday and I decided on this one.  He loved it so much he wants it every year on his birthday.  My daughter, whose 7th birthday is soon, also asked for it.

Oh my!  I love this dessert!  It's simple to make and is a big hit with adults and children. I did not alter the recipe.  This is definitely a keeper and will be a great "stand by" recipe when I need something quick.

Made this for a quadruple-family-member birthday-party this weekend (four people, four different cakes). Had one box vanilla, one box chocolate pudding; mixed them together and they were great.  Added contents to a plastic sand bucket, covered the crushed cookie top w/gummy worms & bugs, and it was a HUGE hit!  Very, very yummy - I was ordered to bring dirt cake to all family functions from now on, or don't even bother showing up.  haha  :)

AWESOME!!!! My kids and in-laws loved this pudding. There was not much left after our family get together for the Super Bowl but I have just enough to send with the kids for dessert in their lunches. I sure am glad, otherwise I know I would have been fired as MOM!!! This recipe is so creamy and thick, it is FABULOUS!!!! It will definitely become a quick family favorite for you too.

DIRT REVIEW

I did not make the entire cake...only the dirt portion for a zombie cake that I made for Halloween - the Dirt (I used oreo cookies) looked great - very realistic.  I made mine in a blender (which was not ideal, but worked) it would be much easier with a food processor.  I thought that it might make my cake a little dry, but it was very good.  I frosted by cake and then used a slotted spoon and sprinkled that cake until it was covered with "Dirt"

This was fantastic! I bought two large graham cracker crusts to layer it in, and so it only needed one bag of double stuffed Oreos for the middle and the top. I also topped with cool whip when I served it. It was soooooooo good!

Excellent recipe.  I have made it for kids and adults, and everyone loves it.  One alteration I make is to use white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  It just gives it a little more flavor!

Turned out good, I followed the recipe exactly, next time I think I'd use a little less of the cookies.  I read that some used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, I couldn't imagine, I think that would have been way to much chocolate, and I love chocolate.  I'd definately make this again though, it was good and the kids loved it!!!

Fun & delicious.  Made to take to a dinner get together and it was a hit.  Put it in a plastic flower pot and served with small garden shovel.  Fun centerpiece for a picnic or summer/garden themed party.

I brought this to a mothers day get together(where all the family would be)and as soon as i brought it to the door everyone rushed over to wondering where the desert was.I told them that it was in my hand and they thought it was a flower pot in some dirt. But when i explained it they all tryed it and loved it very much(so did the kids).I would recommend this to any one.*****

Believe it or not, I used fat free whipped topping and cream cheese, sugar free pudding, and low fat sandwich cookies.  I also used just 6 tbsp. of reduced fat margarine.  It was still an incredible dessert.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great, easy dessert that kids and grown-ups love!  It's a staple at southern pot-luck dinners. When serving to young children, I sometimes add gummy worms.  THe kids love it (but it's a bit disgusting to adults because the colors run into the pudding).

I hadn't made this in years and was worried as to which recipie would taste like the original one i made years back. (there were many variations posted)  Glad to say that this is it! I was just making it for the family, so i cut everything in half and it turned out perfect!  It's a classic!!

I made this for an adult dinner party by changing the following: I did layers of "dirt" and creamy filling in a large glass bowl (so the layers can be seen). On top I put chopped fresh fruit -- strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and kiwi. It was a huge hit. I have also made it in individual serving dishes with the fruit on top, which makes for a beautiful presentation.

This is an ABSOLUTE HIT for taking to potlucks or parties.  My 18 yr old son has worked the same part-time job on grounds crew at the local golf course during summers for a few years.  They have a potluck for the guys and it is REQUIRED that I make this for him to take.  The other guys specifically request that he brings this.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I gave this to the kids I babysat and they loved it! Use lots of gummy worms. Better when refrigerated for a few hours. Yum!

This recipe is much fattier than it needs to be. I substituted skim milk, fat free cool whip, 1 regular size package of reduced fat oreos and an extra 8oz package of fat free cream cheese in place of the butter. It turned out to be very very creamy and all-around excellent. Couldn't tell the difference at all. I also used sugar-free pudding instead (1 vanilla, 1 white chocolate) which helps cut calories.

My family and I really love this recipe. I put it in a kids sand bucket and use the shovel as the serving spoon. It's great for summer picnics and get togethers. To make it less sweet, sometimes I add the nutra sweet vanilla instant pudding.
We also put gummy worms on top for decorations!
Kids and adults like it either way!

This was easy and awesome, not to mention great tasting! For easy clean-up, I found it best to use a two small flower pots, small enough so that I could put in a ziplock back, then fold it over the top. Wrap a ribbon around to hide the bag on the outside, and there you go! I *really* fooled my bf's parents with it. ;)

I followed the advice and used the cheesecake pudding-it was excellent!  I only bought 1 package of oreos, not the 1.5 that the recipe requires, but I had enough "dirt" anyway.  I put it in rose garden-designed paper cups and put a gummy worm halfway in/out and then a single silk rose in each, they looked and tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe, Tammy!

This recipie is great!  Very tasty.   I suggest you use 1 cup of powdered sugar.  The amount called for doesn't quite make it sweet enough--for my taste anyway!!

Made one and took it to work before I made it for friends, it was gone before I knew it.  Made another to take to a friends, kids loved it and so did adults.
