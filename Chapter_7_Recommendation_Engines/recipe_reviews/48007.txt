This dish was very good, however, I'm only giving it four stars because as written, I think it would have been a little bland for our personal tastes, so I jazzed up the rice/spinach mixture  with my usual garlic and onion powders, a little cayenne and some parmesan cheese.  I also made a sauce using a can of roasted garlic mushroom soup and evaporated skim milk to thin it out. My gang really liked it and were all happy that mom was actually home cooking instead of Christmas shopping!

Very tasty and easy recipe... But the crescent roll dough didn't work as I expected. It was fluffy, not flaky. I'll use phyllo dough next time.

I added garlic powder and onion powder like a previous reviewer.  I liked the texture of the chicken, but the crescent roll dough got soggy on the bottom while baking.  Next time I'm going to put it on a rack in the pan.  I especially liked this because you can do most before your guests come over--  I pounded the chicken, and diced the pepper and spinach and when they got to my home I only had to make the rice and roll up.  I made steamed broccoli and julienned au gratin potatoes with it and everyone loved it.  Like I said, though, the dough on the bottom got a little soggy and would next time maybe put on an elevated pan.  Great recipe......

Mine wouldn't roll up quite right, so I wound up laying the crescent roll down on the board, laying the chicken on top of that, adding a pile of the rice mixture, and then rolling the whole thing up together, which seemed a little easier. I think as written it would have been kind of bland, but I added some garlic salt and used garlic-butter crescents, and that helped.

This was very easy to make, but I found it slightly bland as well. I would add a little more seasoning next time. It made a great presentation though, and would be wonderful for guests.
