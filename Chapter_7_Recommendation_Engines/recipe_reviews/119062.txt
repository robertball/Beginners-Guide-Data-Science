This is really tasty! I skipped the  onions and accidentally doubled the amount of cheese (oops!). Yum! Thanks! :)

Awesome idea! I used what I had on hand, which was Monterey Jack & yellow onions, and it was still good-- just not as flavorful as it would have been had I used the Cheddar & red onions. I added some dill, garlic, and salt for mine, but probably won't need it when I re-make it according to recipe. This will be a regular in our home. Thanks!!

Very easy, add a whole grain roll and you have a tasty and quick lunch. I did have to change it just little, I did not have cheddar used coby jack and also was out of Ranch and had to used mayo. All in all very good and easy.

This was a perfect way to use up our last chunk of ham from the holidays and some of the homemade ranch dressing I made recently. Creamy & flavorful salad that hit the spot for a quick lunch. No changes needed, the flavors are exactly right. Thanks for the keeper of a recipe! :)

So simple and tasty too! What a great way to use up that extra ham. I didn't have quite enough frozen peas but I think the whole bag may have been too much anyway. Thanks for the recipe, I will definately be making this again.

I made this for my onion phobic husband and used ham, peas and ranch, no cheese, and it was great.

This is so easy to put together and everybody made positive comments about it.  This one will be on the menu around here again, soon.  We did add a bit more dressing.  We have changed it to 1/2 cup in our notes.

My family enjoyed this simple and easy recipe.  It was so quick to throw together and was a nice side dish to accompany any summer time meal instead of the regular side salad.  I also made it another time and took it to a church picnic but it didn't seem to go over so well there.  Some people just aren't open to trying new things I guess.

This was delicious. I made the salad exactly as written, then I made some whole grain rotini pasta & tossed this salad with it. It was great, and I didn't even need to add more dressing. That stretched this to dinner for two, plus 4 packed lunches. Winner! Thanks for the recipe, Laura!

Oh my...This was good! An easy to make salad, the only thing I did different was to buy the already cubed ham at my local supermarket. Thanks for another keeper!

I made this salad without any changes, although I eyeballed the cheese and onion. It was excellent!!! Three of us finished the whole bowl. 

For the ranch dressing I used Hidden Valley made from the packet. It was great for this recipe because it's creamier than the bottled stuff.

Excellent quick salad. I use a sharp cheddar and make it a day ahead of using. I can distinguish all of the individual flavors while enjoying how they each play on the others for an overall wonderful salad. Thank you, Laura!
