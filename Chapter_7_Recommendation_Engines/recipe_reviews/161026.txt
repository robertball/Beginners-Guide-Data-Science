Wow, I was looking for a way to use my chicken and spinach, and found this recipe, and I thought if I marinated my chicken in italian dressing, that would work instead of the steak. But, as I prepared my sauce, I realized I had no mushrooms or bell pepper. I decided to give it a go anyway, and oh my word, just the red onion (and 3 small cloves garlic) in the sauce, and it was incredible! The wine and the sweetness of the red onion when it cooked down worked so well together. I used fresh asiago and a little fresh tomato between the chicken and spinach (which I didn't wilt since the dressing was still simmering when I poured it on the spinach), then topped it with some green onion...It was so easy and looked beautiful, and tasted phenominal! I can't wait to do it right with steak and blue cheese! What a perfect recipe!

Ohhh so delicious....my first time making flat iron steak and it was a success. Even my family really liked this. OK....so I made a little deviation from the recipe....I grilled my peppers, red onion, and portabello mushrooms, and reduced the dressing and wine mixture seperately. I used a little evoo, salt and pepper on the meat and grilled. Plated the salad, added the sliced grilled veggies, topped with the steak, crumbled blue cheese and the dressing....and a few crutons. What a meal! The steak was tender and juicy, and it was just all around a satisfying dinner....will definately make again!

Great. I made this for lunch for my husband and he really enjoyed it. We both felt like it was asking for chopped walnuts, so I added some later. I used my favorite Safeway-brand Tuscan Basil salad dressing, which turned out awesome with the wine (Cab Sauv). The success of this recipe is going to depend a lot on what kind of dressing you use - so make sure it's one you love. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  After removing the peppers, onions and mushrooms from the pan there wasn't really any dressing left even though I used a slotted spoon as directed. So, I mixed the wine and a 1/4 cup dressing in a small sauce pan and simmered 'till syrupy as the recipe calls for.  Next time though I will let the dressing settle first and remove most of the oil as the wine sauce was a little oily (I used Robusto Italian by Kraft).  Also, I will wilt the spinach just barely before topping with everything else. The blue cheese was amazing on here and the cooked veggies were a nice change.  Will make again with those 2 changes!  Thanks for the recipe! Oh, and before plating I thought the wine sauce tasted a little odd but it was delicious once on the salad and mixed with everything else!

We liked this salad a lot.  Made it "as is" on the recipe with the exception of instead of using salt and pepper, we used the Montreal Steak seasoning and did a rub.  I think it would not have had as much flavor without it.  Good salad- especially for those of you looking to watch your weight, good alternative to some of the other "diet" foods.  Leftovers were good too!

My husband and I really enjoyed this one!  I made a few substitutions...I used some roasted red peppers and instead of olive oil I used my Italian dressing and then just added a tiny bit more red wine at the end!  It was light and delicious!

Absolutely awesome!!!  There are so many deep levels of flavor that burst in your mouth with this recipe.  The leftovers were just as good as the first go-round and I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Love this recipe!  I used a "robust-flavored" Italian dressing and tomato/basil feta cheese.  I also added a little more Italian dressing, once the vegetables were removed,  with the wine to make more sauce.  It reduced perfectly and was so yummie.  I had leftover steak and will make this for dinner again tomorrow.

Really good!!  The only thing I changed was I used crumbled goat cheese instead of blue cheese since I also grilled scallops along with the steak since I don't eat steak.  My husband LOVED it!

This was delicious! I couldn't find anything labeled "flat iron" at the grocery store, so I used flank steak. We seasoned the steak with some dry Italian dressing mix before cooking. We grilled on a George Foreman which worked but probably isn't recommended. There was almost no liquid left after taking the onions and peppers out of the skillet, so I just mixed wine with some additional dressing. I made double the recommended amount of dressing and would have still liked a bit more. Despite the generous portion of steak, it wasn't overly filling. Served two, plus biscuits, as a meal.

Excellent!  The husband made this tonight, and it was great!  He did say that the sauce should be doubled.  Can't wait until he does this one again!

Loved this salad! Perfect flavors, never gets sickening. Added a little cornstarch at end to thicken dressing & sprinkled some walnuts over top. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  This salad was excellent!  I had a few friends over for lunch, and prepared this.  Every plate was practically licked clean!  I grilled the steaks ahead of time (night before) and just reheated them in the microwave, however I am sure it would taste even better with freshly grilled steaks.  I used red cooking wine instead of regular wine, a combo of green and red peppers, and reduced my dressing (which I doubled) separately.  I definitely plan on making this again!

This was absolutely a great summer time recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. The steak was wonderful and all of the ingredients just blended superbly.I didn't have Italian dressing, so I used Gazebo Room Greek salad and marinade dressing and crumbled feta, instead of blue cheese. With fresh tomatoes in season, I placed two beautiful slices on each plate for garnish. Tasted great and looked beautiful, too.

I broiled my flat iron steak on night for 8 mins on each side instead of grilling it. If you like medium rare I would suggest broiling it for only 6-7 mins per side depending on how rare you like it. Next time I make this I want to add a sweet butter or romaine mix instead of all spinach bc it was a bit powerful for my liking. I also used sweet onion instead of red. Other than that this dinner was amazing. I also want to try adding grape tomatoes and possibly squash or zucchini.

One of my most favorite salads. When I was a UPS driver and I had time (very rare) I would eat at an Italian restaurant on my route.  This (or very close to) is the salad I always ordered.  So yummy!

I found a flat iron steak on clearance and wasn't sure what to do with it.  Got on Allrecipes and did a search and low and behold my fav salad appeared.  I always add either some goat or feta cheese and even some glazed walnuts to my salads.  I have also mixed Italian dressing with Ranch to make a creamy Italian, or for something different try Raspberry/Walnut vinegarette (My favorite is Paul Newman's Brand).

The presentation was so nice, my wife had to share a picture on facebook before eating. At first, I thought that there was not enough dressing but after finishing eating the dish, I decided that less is more in this case. I only got 4 servings with this recipe but that is all I needed.  Will definitely make again

I bought a flat iron steak on a whim because it was discounted and I needed something for dinner. I just happened to have a red onion, mushrooms and banana peppers but no red wine. I gave it a go anyway! I used Greek vinaigrette, and feta instead of blue cheese and Italian. After simmering my veggies in my dressing I plated the whole mess up. 100% will make again!

This as a wonderful recipe. My family and friends loved it. I added a few vegetables such as roasted butternut squash. The only problem I had was that the oil and wine separated. Other than that it was great. It may be because I used homemade Italian dressing. I will definitely make this again

I used filet mignon tips for a very tender steak and it was worth it. I don't have a grill, so I pan seared the filet ends in butter, and used the same pan to cook the peppers, onion and mushrooms. These delicious ingredients on a bed of baby spinach is my idea of heaven.

Great dinner on a hot evening. Tasted really awesome.  I didn’t have mushrooms but added thinly sliced zucchini.  I doubled the sauce. Served over spinach. Yum Yum!!

This is a basic and good recipe. I made my own dressing which defined the success. ( I used a recently acquired cucumber dressing made in a food processor.)

Already reviewed the dish with 5 stars.  I've made it one time.  I was informed by my family I would be making it again and again.  It's nice when everyone is enthusiastic about a menu.  There is no problem getting everyone to the table without any electronic devices.

This was an excellent salad!  I used a 50/50 Spring Mix/Spinach blend rather than all spinach.  The sautéed vegetables were perfectly done and the red wine dressing was delicious.  I loved the grilled flatiron steak.  I hadn't had that kind of steak before and the butcher at our local store cut two steaks special for me.  I loved the bleu cheese crumbled on top, but my hubby doesn't like bleu cheese, so we skipped that on his portion.  He loved it as well.  I will definitely make again!

Wonderful way to stretch just a pound of steak.  The warms vegetables were not something I'd have considered on my own, but my husband and I loved it.  He'd have eaten the whole steak otherwise, so this definitely created an economical meal.  For those who thought it lacking in flavor, you must use good quality wine, oil and dressing.  I used a great Cabernet Savignon, made my own dressing with good EVOO.  I do make my own seasonings using recipes from this site, too.  Salt and pepper would never be enough seasoning for us on steak so I used a Montreal seasoning that I rubbed, let sit for about 30 mi, then added about 1/2 t smoked olive wood EVOO that I rubbed on each side and let rest another 30 min.  I used the same EVOO with the vegetables.  I suspect it made a lot of difference in depth of flavor.  While these ingredients may cost more, I had plenty of steak salad to serve 4 and it certainly was flavorful.  Like others suggested I did make extra sauce.

My family did not like this. The concept is good, but the dressing that went over the salad was not to our liking. I do like the combination of ingredients, I will just grill the veggies with the steak and leave out the Italian dressing/wine reduction sauce. I left the reduction sauce on the side since it smelled really funny, and my husband ended up putting balsamic vinaigrette over his salad and said that was good. I enjoyed drinking the rest of the bottle of wine.

Delicious and so easy to make.  The hubby doesn't eat salad a lot, but he ate every bite of this one.
