Pretty great, tastes awesome and very filling. It only seemed like a lot of cheese to me, so I used only 200g of mozzarella and about 100g of feta - which turned out to be more than enough! Depends on your taste I guess. From the amount in the recipe I was able to have 4 sandwich slices and I'm totally full. Still have leftovers for approximately 3-4 more.

Really good! Didn't say when to put the tomatoes in, so I put them in with the olives.

At first I did not think that I was going to even like the sandwich.  I had the ingredients and I decided to make it.  Let me say it seems time-consuming but it really is not.  The artichoke aioli sauce makes this sandwich -  you do not want to skip it!   I will probably make it again!

Nice blend of vegetables, cheeses, and chicken. We skipped the olives. It was very good.
