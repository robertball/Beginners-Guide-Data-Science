This is a really delicious simple meal!  The only thing I'd change is add a little more broccoli rabe and a little less pasta, but that's just personal preference.  It was really good as written!

Thought this was really good.  I was not familiar with how to handle broccoli rabe and so was a little stemmy, but overall great flavors and interesting mix of ingredients.

This was quick and easy as well as tasty.  I made it with broccoli.  Next time I will add a bit of crushed red pepper as my chorizo was on the mild side.

Really simple, but great flavour! I added mushrooms to the onion/chorizo mixture (I add mushrooms to everything). Thanks for a great recipe!

we made it with home made venison hot italian sausage not chorizo. It was ok, kinda bland, i think more garlic and maybe a touch more oil next time. seemed like there were no mixing of flavors, it was sausage or rabe. We will make again with some adjustments, maybe more cheese too. Possibly a white wine instead of the 1/4 cup of water

I used Andouille sausage because I had that already at home. I also tossed in herb goat cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. It was very tasty and so easy to make. I would imagine this would be great just the way they have it, but I improvised with what I had... Either the way it is, or if used as the base, it great for  many good pasta entrees!

Delicious.  Only 2 so far tasted it.  I used the whole 1lb box of pasta. The challenge was finding Rabe!  whole foods had it.

I only had regular broccoli so I used that. This was easy and delicious. My chorizo was spicy enough so I didn't have to add any other spices.

I changed this a lot because I wanted to make it for a side dish but I'm giving it a five as it is because the recipe is so versatile and a great way to use broccoli rabe. You could easily substitute broccoli, broccolini, chopped spinach or kale, or another vegetable for an equally good dish. I left out the chorizo and onion and substituted ziti for rotini, steamed the broccoli rabe, and mixed it all together with a squeeze of lemon, a little lemon zest and a couple of extra tablespoons of olive oil. It was an excellent side dish. It stretched the broccoli rabe and the pasta cut the bitterness of the rabe a little. It's an excellent combo.

Loved it. Came out perfect. Instead of rotini i used shells. I added mushroom green peppers to the chorizo mix. Wasn't a fan of the broccoli rube but my wife was. Next time i'll switch with some spinach. Good recipe.

I took some creative liberty with this recipe. I didn't have any chorizo on hand so I subbed with some spicy merguez sausage.  I also added some sundried tomatoes to give the dish a bit more colour, and drizzled some roasted garlic-infused olive oil on the pasta before adding it to the meat and broccoli.  Very tasty!! I'll definitely make again!

I had good spicy chorizo to make this, but only broccoli florets. Found it to be a bit dry for our tastes, so added 1 can of diced tomatoes and it was perfect.
