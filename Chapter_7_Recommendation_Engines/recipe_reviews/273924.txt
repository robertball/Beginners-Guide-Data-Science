I doubled the recipe for the sauce.  Glad I did because the whole family loved the sauce, and drizzled on their rice.  Good amount of sweetness with spice.

entire family enjoyed this.  very delicious . nice touch of heat but not a lot . nice and tender chicken . will definitely make again . of course if the heat scares you , then just add less pepper flakes . but I would not eliminate them.  it really adds to the experience.

I made it with no changes whatsoever.  The sauce is delicious and would make a great dipping sauce for spring rolls or egg rolls.   This recipe has been added to my "keeper" file.
