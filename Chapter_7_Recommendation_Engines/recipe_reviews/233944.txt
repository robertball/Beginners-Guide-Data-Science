These are okay, but a little bland.  They might be better in the slow cooker.

Fabulous!!  The oregano, rosemary and feta all came together and had a wonderful flavor profile.  I did add my garlic cloves to the boiling water with my potatoes so we would have a little milder flavor.  They mash perfectly in with the potatoes.  I served with roasted lemon rosemary chicken and fresh green beans.

Family loved these potatoes.  The only tweak I did was using my masher mashed in the milk, butter, garlic, oregano and rosemary.  Once smooth stirred in the feta cheese.  We are a family of 4 and there is none left this morning.  Will be making again.  Thank you Occasional Cooker for sharing this wonderful recipe.
