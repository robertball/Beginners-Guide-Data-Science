My friend gave me a loaf of this bread (a whole loaf!)--she's the recipe submitter. It is an amazing creation--a toasted and buttered slice is a dream breakfast. I was hoping my husband would continue to think he wouldn't like it so I could have it all to myself, but he toasted a slice and loved it too. There is so much going on flavorwise, but nothing overwhelms. Perfect. Thank you, Frances!

Beautiful. I made a 1 1/2 batch to make three loaves, unsure if a full double batch would fit in my mixer (it'd be tight). I heated the milk and saffron the night before, just to save a step in the morning; I refrigerated it overnight, then let it come up to cool room temp before mixing. I also candied lemon peel the night before (already had orange in the fridge). Mixed the dough in the morning, then shaped and baked that evening.
