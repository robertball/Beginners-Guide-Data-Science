mY husband and I both liked this recipe but my kids weren't to fond of it. They said it was too spicy because of the mustard (they are not to fond of mustard to begin with)

This was great!  The only thing that I did different was didn't add the mustard at all, my family isn't a big fan of too much 'mustardy' taste, so we eliminated that alltogether. The end result was a fantastic tasting creamy chicken, and it was perfect paired up with green beans!  Thank you!

I thought this was actually quite bland.  My husband liked it, but I would not make it again.  I ended up adding a lot of extra pepper, serving it over orzo and sprinkling parmesan cheese on top.  It was edible, but nothing I would rave about.  Definately tasted more like mustard chicken than sour cream chicken.

Definitely a keeper. My wife and I changed the recipe a tad though, adding more ketchup, less sour cream and then putting bacon into the sauce. We also made the sauce separately and grilled the chicken. It turned out amazing and the idea is great. Thanks for this one!

Too much mustard taste.  We like mustard, but it just didn't complement this dish well.

This was a good recipe.  I like the way the mustard gave it a kick.   My family enjoyed it.  Plus it was real easy to make

FANTASTIC!!!  I made this dish the same as recipe but cooked chicken longer and used olive oil rather then vegetable oil. Then used Woeber's Reserve southwest mustard also thinned with a little water served over wild rice  a keeper for sure

It was good but still strong mustard taste with 1 tbsp less than what was called for.  Good over rice.

Made this with two bone-in skinless chicken breasts. They were massive so I cooked them with thinly sliced onion, turning every so often. I had it turned up the burner past medium to cook it faster so I added some water to the bottom of the pan to steam cook the thick meat to keep it tender, checking the internal temperature from time to time. As it reached 140 degrees, I drained off some (not all) of the water from the pan and added the sour cream mixture dolloped over both pieces of chicken for the last 20 minutes of cooking and replaced the lid on the pan to complete cooking. The thoroughly mixed sour cream mixture had these variations—added a bit more salt by 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.; added some garlic salt to the regular salt; kept the ketchup the same, but reduced the mustard to a 1/2 tablespoon and used drained, canned mushroom stems & pieces. I made white rice to put it over and my husband loved it! I was concerned about other reviews so I wasn’t getting my hopes up but I thought it was pretty tasty too. I wouldn’t be afraid to serve this to company.

My wife and I both love it.  I don't like mustard so I leave it out and I make some bacon and crumble it up and put in the sauce about 1 minute before ready to served.

I added 1/3 cup per serving onion and a teaspoon of paprika and I loved it. I also used a reduced fat sour cream, evoo and a pad of butter instead of vegetable oil. Winner.

Ok so I was VERY hesitant to make this but it actually turned out well. The alterations I made were half the amount of mustard and added a half cup of frozen spinach. Served it on top of gluten free pasta. This was a quick Tuesday night meal! I would have given it five stars but I had to add about 1/2 tablespoon of salt to it.

We added a thinly sliced, medium yellow onion and sautéed that with the mushrooms, chicken, and garlic before adding the sauce ingredients, along with a little marojam, thyme and seasoned salt in place of plain.  We ate this with white rice and green beans, and it made a nice, easy meal.
