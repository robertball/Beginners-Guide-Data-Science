I loved this recipe.  The contrast of smooth center and crunchy topping were great.  The only change I made was I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the casserole.

I used butternut squash with this recipe as well.  I have used this recipe twice: for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Very easy to prepare, and it was a big hit for even the ones that didn't usually enjoy squash.

Depending on the size of the butter nut squash as compared to the normal size of acorn squash, I ended up adjusting the amount of ingredients.  

For example, the butternut squash I obtained at Thanksgiving was much larger than normal, so for 2 squash I tripled the amount of ingredients.  However, the butternut squashed I obtained at Christmas was comparatively smaller, so I doubled the ingredients.

I made this recipe with modifications.  I had no half & half, so used 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk and omitted the white sugar. It was wonderful!  The squash seemed a little soupy when I put it in the oven, but it firmed up nicely and became very light and creamy.  We loved the crunchy topping, and it was a wonderful side dish with ham this past Easter Sunday.  The next time I make it, I might add some pumpkin pie-type spices (cinnamon, clove, ginger) and see how we like it that way.  Other than that, I might get some half & half so I can try sticking closer to the original recipe! Overall a great recipe that seems very flexible and easy to make.

I followed this recipe, with the exception of butternut instead of acorn squash-- use two butternut, three makes too much for the baking dish. This turned out great!! My very picky 5 year old even liked it. The topping would also be good on sweet potatoes. For the last two minutes, I used the broiler to help toast the pecans. Great recipe, thanks!

After having sweet potatoes with pecans instead of marshmallows for the first time, I HAD to find a recipe! This is absolutely fabulous. Instead of three acorn squashes, I use 4 cups of mashed yams from a can (buy 2 of the big yam cans). Excellent!!

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving Dinner although I felt it could almost be served for dessert.  It is definitely a sweet dish and I didn;t need to double the recipe, even for a crowd of 12 (due to the fact that most people don't take heaping servings of sweet veggies at dinner).  My husband (who loves sweets) adored this casserole.

This is absolutely delicious! I brought it to my family Thanksgiving dinner. The people who grew up hating squash said it was the best they'd ever had (and proceeded to eat it happily) and those who actually like squash ate seconds... and thirds... and made me promise to bring some to Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, but due to time constraints I stuck it in the fridge overnight before baking it (and then let it sit on the counter for about half an hour before putting it in the oven). Next time, I will wait until it's about to go into the oven before applying the topping to be sure to get it nice and crunchy!

I just made this for Thanksgiving as I've been wanting to try squash recipes.  It was such a hit!  My husband loved it and I took the dish to a work get together and was asked to pass along the recipe.  
Kids were a little wary to try it, so you might want to tell them that it's similar to sweet potatoes.  
Very delicious recipe, thank you!

I used coconut oil instead of butter (did the same for basting my turkey.) It works beautifully. No sticking to the pan. I wish I had made twice as much topping and used an 11 x 13 dish and spread it over even more of the squash. It was that good!

This was the most popular dish at our Thanksgiving dinner. I've made this several more times and have used at least 5 different types of squash that we received from our CSA. There isn't one type of squash that made it better. They all tasted delicious. I agree that it is more of a desert like dish. At the same time, it is a little savory. I have also tried it with coconut extract and that was also delicious. Yum!

I will definitely make this casserole again!  In the future however, I think I will use a little less sugar within the squash portion next time.  Also, I will use 4 acorn squash  instead of 3 as suggested to make the casserole dish a little more full.  I have found that 2 or 3 large butternut squash work just as well.  I substituted organic Monk Fruit sugar for the regular granulated kind and it did not affect the final taste or texture one bit.  Everyone who has eaten this dish has raved about it!  Thank you for providing your readers with such a dependable recipe that will stand the test of time.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit with everyone. Definetly, on the sweet side and the acorn squash is the right ingredient for this dish. I plan to make this again on Thanksgiving again.

I made this with three packages of frozen squash, and it was fantastic!  I used the same test I use for doneness with custard - stuck a knife in near the center and kept it baking till the knife came out clean.  It took a lot longer than 40 minutes, but maybe my oven is not calibrated correctly - I just moved into this house.    I took it as a side dish to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house, and when the friend's teenager got the munchies later - this was what she wanted!
