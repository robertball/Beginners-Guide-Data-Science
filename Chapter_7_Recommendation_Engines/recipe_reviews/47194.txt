I forwarded this recipe to my 19 yr. old daughter. It's her first year in college and she only has access to a microwave in her dorm. She hasn't stopped raving about it since she tried it. Very easy, very inexpensive, and very tasty. Thanks Dev, she loves it!

i changed the noodle type to penne rigate and added a layer of cheese. i also decided to cook the noodles and broccoli and then combine everything in a baking dish and heat it for 20 minutes at 325. it was such a great tasting meal.  the broccoli and french fried onions really added great flavor. next time i am going to go heavy on the french fried onions, but you will need to decide if the ingredients are balanced to your liking. some other ideas i had were mushroom or tuna. i am also considering going with a whole grain pasta the next time. this casserole is a great idea for a quick and surprisingly tasty microwaved dish, and has great potential to be a great oven baked dish as well.

Surprisingly good!!  I had cream of chicken soup on hand & used it.  This really is comfort food.  It would even make a good potluck dish.

Great, simple and tasty. :) Perfect for the lazy cook or people with limited appliances. Save yourself a step and put the broccoli in with the pasta. Cook it all at once -- it saves time. (I also have done this recipe with frozen peas in place of broccoli and that works well too) Also, if you want some more protein, try adding in a can of drained tuna! It's just like tuna noodle casserole. Yum yum.

You guys!! These are tha bomb! My son said he would eat them as fast as I could make them. They are super tasty and super easy. I also make them without using the egg, just dipping the slices into milk and then into the crumb mixture. This is my favorite way because I think they turn out crispier this way. Don't undercook them. We liked them best when they were dark brown, right on the verge of burning.

Thanks! I am currently limited to microwave cooking and trying to make healthy meals for my family. I added some pre-cooked chicken to the recipe before I put it in the microwave for the final cooking.

For microwaveable and easy to make I should rate this 5 stars but for flavor it's 4 stars. For those college students that might make this next time you get pizza save those little packets of crushed red pepper flakes and use them to top this.
