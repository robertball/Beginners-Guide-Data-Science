This is my recipe.  After making this several times since writing the recipe, I've found that: I like chicken flavored vegetable broth by Orrington Farms the best; it's ok to use minced garlic from a jar; add 1/2 cup more celery; add herbs/spices before boiling; decrease water to 10 cups; increase noodles to 3 cups (I like the dumpling style noodles); and decrease cooking time to 20-30 minutes.  The cornstarch/water mixture is optional.  Oh, you may need to add salt to taste depending on the sodium content of your broth.  And this is probably more like 6-8 servings.  :)

This soup is great! I put in 10 cups of water based on other suggestions here, but 12 cups would have been just right (the egg noodles soak up a lot of the liquid). I stopped eating meat last year and now I won't even miss chicken noodle soup!

it was really good as a base soup, although i admit that i had to make a few adjustments. i added lots of green vegetables and only kept the water/stock to 6 cups, not 12. in making it i really feel that 12 cups would make it way too thin.

This is a nice simple soup that i enjoyed and will make again. I have a warning for all people who read these reviews though.  Keep the broth at 12 cups if you use egg noodles.  I reduced the broth to 8 cups and those noodles soaked it right up.  after two bowls there wasn't any broth left!  Thanks for a good recipe.  I will make it with my own vegetable stock next time to reduce the sodium and keep it at 12 cups.

This soup is fantastic. I have made it a couple of times now and absolutely love it. The first time I made it I followed the ingredients exactly. The scond time I made it , I altered it slightly. I added a little more cornstarch to thicken it up a bit and used two cloves of garlic. and a little extra carrots and raisins.  I will be making this on a regular basis .

This is a good soup recipe. Nothing too fancy, but very tasty. I made it once with the raisins, and once without. It is good both ways, but I think I prefer it without. The raisins give a very interesting sweet taste, and is definitely worth a try.

Unreal. I can't believe there's only 2 tbs of butter in this! I forwent the raisins like a few others. I also didn't have the fake chicken broth so I used 6 chicken flavored bullion cubes (fake chicken, vegetarian cubes). I also used only 10 cups of water, added another cup of egg noodles, and the last of my frozen peas (about a cup and a half) it came out just the right consistency.  Holy smokes, the flavor is great and it made my kitchen smell wonderful! Thanks so much!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I made it last night for a Monday night dinner and not only is it easy enough for a weeknight, but my husband loved it.  I used the dumpling noodles, which I love anyway, and used vegetable broth because I couldn't find the kind called for in the recipe.  I added more salt because my broth didn't have a whole lot.  As for the other seasonings, I really only used the poultry seasoning and black pepper (and a bit of thyme.)  I also added peas because I thought they looked pretty.  And one more change - I sauteed the tofu with the veggies for just a bit to give it some flavor.  My husband usually HATES celery, so I left it big enough for him to pick out but he wound up liking it.  I didn't have to use the cornstarch mixture, but I could see how it would be a nice thickening agent if your soup was thin.  I will most certainly be making this recipe again and again this fall and winter, especially since I keep most of the ingredients on hand.  A soup that's this easy is always nice to have in the arsenal.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

I was not crazy about this. All I could taste were the herbs. Maybe if they were bundled in a sachet and simmered with the soup instead being tossed in. The only change I made was I omitted the butter and used vegetable stock to keep it vegan. Will try again with some tweaking.

Holy mackerel this soup is fantastic. I used chicken broth since that's what I had but OMG it was delicious! I think the real key to this recipe is the butter at the very beginning. It wasn't THAT much butter especially compared to the amount of broth that's added but I think it really brought a much richer flavor to the soup.  I didn't have celery (so I used celery salt), marjoram, or cornstarch but I didn't miss them a bit.

I loved this soup.  I made it much as written, except used Gardein "chic'n" scallopini cutlets for half the tofu, regular tofu for the rest.  Next time, I'll use all scallopini, it is very flavorful.  The broth was great, I added peas.  I used Imagine chicken less broth, it was all the store had, but it was very good and rich.  I put the noodles in at the end, as others suggested, and used sturdy kluski type noodles. I couldn't make myself put the raisins in.  This was a very good, rich, and tasty soup, and I will be making it regularly.

This soup was surprisingly like chicken noodle soup.  The cubes of tofu held up well in the cooking, and they were remarkably like the little cubes of chicken you get in canned chicken soup.  I agree with the reviewers who said the soup was too thin, so I would reduce the broth next time.  I chopped my veggies small so that they would cook as quickly as the recipe suggested, but they were still slightly underdone.  My noodles were slightly overdone, too, so I'll have to do a bit of adjustment.  The raisins weren't a bad idea, but I don't think they added much and wouldn't use them again.  Definitely worth another try.  Thanks!

This is so yummy & easy! My husband & I love to make it together on a night when we want to eat something light and healthy but satisfying.  Also, it is a staple when someone in the house is not feeling well. It is easy to adjust to your liking by adding whatever veggies, herbs, spices you prefer. I mostly stick to the original recipe because it is really perfect as is. Great simple to make and wonderful to eat recipe, thank you so much for posting.

Just a great recipe!  I chose to use 2 cloves of garlic and added the herbs before boiling as another reporter suggested.  Loving raisins, I used 1 cup and plan even more next time.

This was deliscious!  We're new vegetarians.  It tasted so close to authentic homemade roast chicken noodle soup.  So it was nice having something taste simular to our old ways.  We like our soup more soupy so I cut the veggies in half.  And we left out the raisins cuz our family doesn't like them.  Thanks for sharing Sarah.  :)

This was excellent and a complete lifesaver tonight with my mostly empty fridge and a half hour to get dinner on.  I almost didn't put the raisins in, but they ended up being my favorite part!  Thank You for submitting this!

My husband and I love this soup! It's our go to soup whenever we make soup for our non-vegetarian friends. The only things I change is adding more carrots (I love lots of carrots in my soup!), using firm tofu that I froze for a day and then thawed (this gives it a chewy meaty texture), and waiting to add the noodles until the last 10 minutes of the simmer. The first time I didn't and the noodles turned to mush.

My husband and I loved this soup. I added way too many noodles, but it just make it heartier. And the raisins were a nice surprise. This is definitely way more than 4 serving (more like 8 large servings) and my husband is a big eater.

I really enjoyed this, wonderful flavor.  I did make some minor changes including... I doubled the noodles and omitted the tofu and corn starch.  I felt it would be too liquidy without the extra noodles.  On a side note, this made 8 good sized servings for me, not the originally suggested 4.

Wonderful! I added 1/2 teaspoon of each of the spices as we LOVE thyme and rosemary and I also made homemade egg noodles. Even ground up some for baby and he loved it! Will keep and make many times! Thanks, Sarah!

Very tasty, even though I didn't use the poultry seasoning or chicken-flavored veggie broth. Just used regular veggie stock and added a little salt at the table. Used 10 cups stock and it was perfect. Next time, I will add the cooked noodles nearer the end like another reviewer did. And most important for me was draining the tofu and frying it a little so it firms up into a nicer consistency. Very satisfying on this cold, cold day!

I used about 8 cups of water and made my own egg noodles. Fantastic vegetarian recipe.

Love this recipe!  Haven't been bold enough to try rasins but have added a bit of fennel instead of celery and it turned out great.  I don't put tofu in either-- it's hearty enough on it's own with a bit of baguette.

Awesome recipe! We are new to adding tofu to our diets and I thought my boyfriend would be skeptical he loved it so much...wanted me to make a double batch!

This was a really nice soup - even my non-vegetarian husband approved.  And I was missing several of the spices, but just added seasoning here and there.

Very good soup and even the non-veg family members like it. I make it without the raisins and replace the tofu with TVP chunks for something different.  I use 14 cups broth and double the poultry seasoning.

This was quite good, and it adapted well to the crockpot.  I did reduce the broth to about 8 cups, which made a hearty soup.  I wonder if the number of servings in the original recipe is right. . . that seems like an awful lot of soup for 4 people.  I'm sure I will make this recipe again occasionally.

Super good! Definitely don't miss the chicken. Ours came out not so much of a soup, more of noodles with a little broth. I would agree with some of the other comments of if you use egg noodles, add more broth. But still, so good!

Really great! Will make again. Agree that it could use a less liquid and more noodles. I will make this adjustment next time.

I followed the recipe, except that instead of plain tofu I subbed vegan chicken "Garden chicken scalloping" because the texture is better.  Will make this again and again.

I usually search for recipes based on what I have on the fridge.  I search for a recipe with tofu and beef broth.  I found this great recipe and I substituted beef both for chicken and I only had two cups.  I had penne pasta so that's what I used.  It turned out delicious, nutritious and it's healthy.  What more can I ask.

I am adding this to my menu rotation. Not too fussy, but very tasty. As all the other reviews say - 12 cups of broth look like a lot. But don't skimp because the noodles really drink it up.  I hate raisins, so I added fresh sliced mushrooms instead. May try peas next time. Otherwise I stuck to the directions. Easy!

Loved it! Made the following alterations: I used fresh homemade noodles (and boiled for longer to make sure they were cooked), left out the raisins, and used a half-and-half mixture of regular chicken broth and a "Thai and ginger" broth they happened to have at the store when I was getting the ingredients. I only used eight cups of broth, but when I make it again I will use the twelve originally called for in the recipe. The Thai ginger broth added some extra flavors (ginger, coconut, lime, and lemongrass, I think) and I would definitely recommend its inclusion if you have it available! However, even with straight chicken broth this would be delicious and very flavorful with the onion, garlic, and myriad spices. Very glad to have found this recipe.

I made this soup today.  I have to say,  it was DELICIOUS.  I have been sharing it with everyone.  I added more carrots on my own just to have more filler in soup.  I purposely over measured spices,  and it was divine!  My apartment smells amazing.  Great flavor and texture.  Appreciated this on a 20 degree day.  Thanks!

I love this soup. I hate celery, so I make it with leeks instead and don't use the raisins. I've also found that, if you follow the instructions, that the herbs are still too hard once the soup is finished. I've started to add the herbs with the veggies so that they cook down with them and are soft once the soup is done. Also, if I'm feeling like adding chicken to the soup instead of the tofu, I put in two large chicken breasts, diced, into the broth at the same time as I would the tofu.

This was good and wholesome but pretty bland, even thougg the tofu worked great.  However, would not make it again without a few changes.
