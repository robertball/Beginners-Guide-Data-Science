So good! It is well worth your time to make the rosewater yourself (i just put an oversized lid ontop of the boiling rose petals and let the steam condense and drip into a container) the pistachios(i used fresh and crushed myself) go very well with the real whipped cream. A very delicious light recipe that is worth all the work!

This is a great recipe.  Kids love the creamy taste though I don't add the pistachios for them.

I loved this recipe but I changed the bottom layer - 6c cold milk, 1 c semolina & 1/3 c of sugar as soon as they boil i take it off the heat & add mistika and pour it into dishes. I made the same syrup and topping. It's so delicious & light. I made it for my son's birthday.

I used 1 can of coconut cream, 1 can of coconut milk, and water instead of milk since I'm allergic to dairy. I topped it with a mixture of diced dried apricots and pineapple, craisins, golden raisins, orange zest, and slivered almonds. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and half a teaspoon of orange extract to the syrup. Because of these additions, the dish has a bright flavor and appearance. It's delicious!

I made this recipe several time and everytime it was perfect. I did not add the cream as the recipe is already rich. I even left the milk out of the fridge for over 12 hours, the recipe came out PERFECT.

Amazing.  The saltiness of the pistachios pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the caramel and adds a perfect texture balance.

I love this layered dish and I serve the syrup on the side so people can put a little or a lot.
