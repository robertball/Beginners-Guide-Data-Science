I did half pork and half beef for the mixture. We made them at work one night and everyone loved them. We brushed with some garlic butter and cooked them in an airfyer.

Russia has just been in the news so much that we had to take it upon ourselves to learn a little bit about their culture. Luckily we were able to find this great Russian Dumpling or “Pelmeni” recipe.  Open your horizon’s people, food is the great unionizer!

I looooove this Pelmeni recipe! It’s simple and delicious. I personally cut the onions really small (more of a mince than a chop) and I prefer to sauté them before adding them to the ground beef. Make sure you season with an ample amount of salt and pepper, if you don’t the filling will be bland. My favorite dipping sauce to serve with these is sour cream mixed with a splash or two of white vinegar (sometimes I add dill weed too).  They freeze great, just make sure to flour them before putting them in the freezer. I didn’t do this the first time and they all stuck together. Banging them on the counter to separate them was a workout LOL.

This is very good. I do have a pelmeni mould, and made no changes to the recipe other than first sautéing the onion. I think the seasonings can be enhanced - I'm not too fond of just salt and black pepper. I will make this again and tweak the seasonings to taste.

Fond memories of Pelmeni making parties. My mom and several of her friends and my aunts would sit around the dining room table "folding" pelmeni. Hundreds would be made. Since my family is Russian by way of Shanghai we have and still eat them with vinegar and soya sauce. Delicious!

Just like mom used to make, delicious. The dough stayed together while boiling. I did order a Pelmeni Mold from Ebay for $7.95 first. Five stars on this!

This recipe is AMAZING! It was easier then I thought. I have no complaints. 

I did do one thing differently. I made beef broth and cooked it that way. It was really yummy. That is how we grew up eating it. But sometimes I want to try it fried.

We used half hamburger and half hot sausage, added fresh dill and a few shakes of Franks hotsauce, and garlic powder to the meat mixture.  We also added a lot of fresh ground pepper. The dough was very firm and hard to roll out, I suspect that because of the firm dough I wasnt able to roll them as thinly as preferred. We chose to fry them and they turned out well. We've got plenty of frozen ones that we’ll try to boil.  We garnished with sour cream and Sriracha sauce.  We will make again.
