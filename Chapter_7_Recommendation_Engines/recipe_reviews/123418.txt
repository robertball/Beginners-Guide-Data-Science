This is an excellent recipe!  Husband and kids loved these sticky buns.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the filling and the sauce - and I am glad that I did!    I added raisins to go along with the nuts because of my family's preference for raisins but it would have been very good too with just the pecans.  I didn't have any dry milk powder so I substituted it for 1/4 cup of regular milk and the dough turned out light and fluffy.

As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the filling, but also added lots of chopped nuts & rasins. To the topping, I also added lots of chopped nuts & rasins.  In stead of using a saucepan, I used the microwave. I used regular flour.  My guests said that I "nailed it", meaning that they were just like they remembered from childhood. This recipe was so...easy & delicious.  I wrapped the left overs securely in a zip-lock bag, removing as much air as possible, so they were soft & delicious the next day.  This will become another signature dish of mine, for years to come.  Thank You So...much for the recipe!!  I've made this recipe several times & its turned out perfectly every time.  I plan to use the dough recipe for dinner rolls tonight.  Much better recipe than what came with the bread machine. May 2011: While its still cool out, I will be making several batches to freeze for summer guests. They freeze very well.  Thanks again for the recipe!!!!!!!

Big hit with the family.  I did double the fillling and sauce instructions. OMG!! Without doing this they will not be real STICKY Buns.  Also I used all purpose flour by mistake, the first rise was uneventful. But after you roll them and let them sit again for an hour they double in size.  Will use this over and over.

These Sticky Buns were not quite sticky enough... My family liked them... but I didn't really... Fresh out of the oven they were better, but later that day, not so good...

My goodness these were terrific.  I made them for Christmas morning breakfast, brunch at my sister-in-laws, then again at work for a New Year's Day breakfast.  I actually prepared them the night before to the "in the pan stage", covered and put in fridge for the night where they would rise slowly.  Then, in the morning, I took them out and let warm a little bit to get them rising again, then baked.  Worked beautifully!   I too doubled the filling and the sauce... just cause I like all that stuff.  They were so good and buttery...yum! Thank you for a great recipe, they were a hit with everyone who tried them.

I made these using my stand mixer and used 4 cups of flour and they turned out perfectly, so light and fluffy. I did double the filling and glaze and they are the best sticky buns I have ever made. Delicious!

Made this the evening beforehand, and let it rise overnight.  My family LOVES this recipe!  I exchanged the pecans for almonds, the sugar was replaced with Splenda, and I cut the butter in the filling to 1/4 cup.   I went with the bread machine version, and it turned out beautifully.  I will be making these again and again!

Just finished making these and they are AWESOME!  Light & Fluffy, Oooey & Gooey...Delicious!  I mixed the dough in my Kitchenaide with the dough hook.  I used lowfat milk instead of water & milk powder and had to add an extra cup of flour during kneading to get the right consistency.  I also followed other's advice and doubled the filling and sauce - perfect amount of cinnamon!  After rolling the dough I cut them into about 2" slices and divided the sauce between 5 mini-loaf pans, then centered 2 rolls per pan so I could freeze some unbaked and keep some in the fridge unbaked for tomorrow morning.  Baked off one pan tonight and they are absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to bake some more hot and fresh in the morning!

I've never made an authentic sticky bun so this was an interesting project for me.  I was surprised that it was a bread dough base.  I didn't double the filling, although probably should have.  The topping was perfect.  I cut the buns into 8 as opposed to 12 but didn't increase the cooking time for the thicker buns - my fault.  Flavors are very good, presentation was perfect and I'll make them the next time the family comes to visit.  Oh - I used my bread maker for the dough.

Oh, my gosh -- these are like heaven!  Yeast breads and I aren't exactly on good terms, but these turned out absolutely perfect.  I didn't have any milk powder, so I did what another reviewer suggested and used 1/4 cup of whole milk.  The dough was easy to work with and produced a soft, fluffy bread.  I (unintentionally) cooked the topping a bit longer than specified -- almost to the hard candy stage -- but it baked up with an awesome, crackly caramel glaze that was half gooey, and half chewy.  Delicious.  I hinted around to my husband that these are the best I've ever had (meaning: better than my mother-in-law's recipe), and although he didn't specifically state that, I am pretty sure he agrees!  ;-)  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe!  The bread is soft and moist and they are very addictive. 

I did tweak it a bit.  Ok, I don't know about anyone else, but I don't eat this kind of thing for health reasons.  I want it as yummy as possible.  I changed the liquid to 2 cups of milk and the butter to 4 tablespoons.  I use 1/2 cup of sugar and put in 2 eggs.  I am also a great fan of vanilla so I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  I just added flour until it was workable dough, about the same consistancy as the original recipe.

Now this does give you quite a bit more dough.  I have a large baking pan that's 13"X21" so I DOUBLE the sauce recipe to cover the bottom of the pan.  I also add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of vanilla.

I use brown sugar in the filling and almonds instead of pecans.

I divide the dough into two balls and roll out each ball seperately.  I end up with 16 buns this way.  Leave lots of space around each bun to allow for rising.

I do not knead at all by hand because of an allergy.  I use my Kitchenaide totally and it works very well.

My rating is for the topping only! I always use the recipe "super soft gooey cinnamon rolls" for the roll part! I also add 2Tbs of honey to the topping mix.

The ready in 50 minutes is a bit low. There is 2 hours of rise time alone. If you make dough in a bread machine, the machine time alone is over 50 minutes.  The buns were great and worth the  2 hours  50 minutes time to make.

These are excellent. The only thing I would say is the prep time you have listed should be more realistic. Anyone who has ever worked with yeast will know that you can not have a prep time of 30 minutes. I made these and it was 3 and 1/2 hours from start to finish. For those who have not worked with yeast don't be afraid. Try these They are well worth it.

I thought these turned out really well overall.  I too doubled the ingredients for the filling and topping - if I hadn't they definitely wouldn't have been "sticky" enough.  I used my Kitchenaid mixer (for the first time) to make the dough and it turned out perfectly - although I did end of having to bake slightly longer than what the recipe said.  But the flavor was great and my family really enjoyed them.

These were awesome! I only got one, but since they were gone in minutes, I'm pretty sure everyone else loved them, too! I did mess up a little by not reading the recipe closely enough. I mixed the filling ingredients together which made it very hard to spread, but they still turned out great.  I increased the amount of filling and added some raisins, but made the sauce as written.  Another great recipe from this site!

Delicious. gone in minutes. I added a half pack of vanilla pudding to the dry mixture. The dough was very soft and sticky but after it rose it was easily workable.

I used a bread machine to make the dough and it kind of blew up and made a huge mess inside my bread machine.  I tried to salvage the dough and as it turns out I had plenty of it after adding extra flour.  I would up the flour to 4 cups from 3 because that's about how much extra (1 cup) flour I added to make the dough workable after the minor explosion.  They still rose nicely and I took others' advice and made extra topping and filling.  They are baking right now and they smell divine.  Reminds me of my childhood.

The only major issue I have with this recipe is the deceitful time requirements at the top!  It says prep time 30 minutes cook time 20 minutes, ready in 50 minutes.  This of course is ignoring the two 1 hour wait periods!  My own fault for not reading the whole recipe before committing but still.

Love these! They a big hit in our house. I have made them twice, definitely double the sauce and filling recipe. I made them to the "pan ready" stage, and let them rise the 2nd time in the refrigerator overnight. Then baked them the following morning. I did learn (the hard way) that the baking time was about an hour. The bottoms were still raw after 30 minutes.

Very easy.  I agree with others.  Double the sauce and make sure you roll out dough very thin.  Yum

These are great. The easiest tastiest sticky buns I have ever had. I too followed others advice and increased the amount of sauce.  I will make these  again and again, despite what my waistline says.

I also doubled the filling as suggested by others, and I substituted 1/3 cup evaporated milk for the dry milk powder. These were absolutely AWESOME! Took them to work and they were devoured within minutes! Definitely a keeper!!!

Solo good! I didn't double the filling and they were more than sweet enough. Although I added 1/4 sugar to the inside. The buns were light and fluffy! And very sticky! :) yum!

Just like I remember from the good old days when Grammie made these.  I did not have powered milk, but used 1/4 cup milk scaleded then cooled.  It seemed to work.  These are sooooo good!

SO good!! I've made these several times and they are the perfect sticky bun. I double the sauce. I also made them the night before, put them in the fridge overnight and took them out to warm a bit and get the rising a bit and baked them for 30 minutes (covered with foil for the last 5 minutes). Love them.
