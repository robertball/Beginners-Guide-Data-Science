Overall, this was a good start and a very creative idea, but rather bland. I made a few modifications to the recipe (see below). If I made this again, I would also use less sugar, the juice of the lime, and at least twice the mint. You can barely taste it at all.  Modifications: 1. Used an 8" x 4" baking dish (couldn't find 7x3) 2. Mix of olive and vegetable oil (couldn't find grapeseed oil) 3. Added the juice from the zested lime (batter tasted a little bland) 4. Baked it for 75 minutes (!!!) Given that the baking dish I used was larger, I exepected a shorter cooking time, not more than double.

This is an interesting bread, and I went with it bc I wanted something different and had blackberries to use.  Yes, I know, it calls for blueberries, but none of my blackberry recipes did it for me.  I am puzzled by the comment that states that in a larger pan it should cook more quickly--smaller pans cook faster because there is less surface area to heat, hence the reason cupcakes cook faster than a cake.  Regardless, I suppose it's counterintuitive, so it doesn't really matter why.  I baked this in a single loaf pan and wouldn't recommend that--it's too much batter.  I did notice that but went ahead anyway bc I was too lazy to redistribute.  So, it took over an hour and a half to bake, and it overflowed, but whatever.  I used lemon extract and zest and used rum instead of rum extract (I really thought I had that, but I don't!) and am glad for the turbinado sugar, which makes for a nice topping.  For those not in the know (this includes myself, I had to google it), sucanat is a type of sugar processed to retain molassess. Not exactly brown sugar, but that's what I subbed.  I doubled the mint and can definitely taste it.  This is a unique and fun recipe.  Thanks for sharing!
