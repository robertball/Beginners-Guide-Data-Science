I did this recipe exactly and it came out more like a hummus shake.  Very watery.

This hummus was runny and bland.  I like the idea of using yoghurt in a hummus recipe to give it an extra tang, but I wouldn't use this one again.  It just wasn't worth "tweaking" to try to get it right.

Delicious!  So incredibly easy to make.  The yogurt adds a nice little tang, and as my boyfriend said, makes it a bit lighter as well.  We cut back on the lemon juice (I think the 1/2 cup thing is a typo).  After we tasted it, added some cumin and freshly ground black pepper, but we could have left it alone according to the recipe.  Will definitely make again - great for informal get-togethers with friends!

1/2 a cup of lemon juice? What? I used 2tbs and it was perfect and I also used only 2tbs greek yogurt. For me it was the perfect consistency. I always add a dash of curry, cumin and cayenne to my hummus. I ate this with bagel crisps but of course hummus is good with raw veggies, pita bread and as a sandwich spread in place of mayo.

I HELD BACK ON THE JUICE FROM THE BEANS &SEASONED WITH THE LEMON JUICE TO TASTE. I ALSO ADDED SOME TAHINI SIMPLY BECAUSE I LOVE IT. THE RECIPE CAME OUT GREAT AND NOT RUNNY.

PERFECT!!!  Really simple, so easy to customize.  I read the reviews, used lemon only to consistency, drained yogurt overnight first. Doubled garlic and added a bit of coriander & cumin -- OMG to die for!!!  This is the only hummus recipe i'll ever use!  Can i give it 10 stars??

My bad. I didn't read the reviews first. I had to add a whole extra can of chick peas to make this almost the consistency of regular hummus. Far too lemony as well. Will not be using this one again.

I liked this recipe, as it is versitile. The problem with the original is too much lemon juice. It should only have 1 Tbsp or so. To mix things up, I used kidney beans and lowfat silken tofu, and chopped scallions can be added for extra flavor (mellow them by grilling them first). I've tried using strawberry banana yogurt as well for a sweeter dip.

I like this: (1) like another reviewer said, it's more tangy than usual and (2) it's easy to make. But I think it doesn't hurt to add a little cumin and ground red pepper. I made a double batch.

This was fantastic! I made it for some guests and they said it tasted just like the Hummus they had at a restaurant.

Delicious!  Creamy, thick, with a little texture, not completely blended and I like it!  I read the reviews first so knew not to add so much lemon juice - I probably went too light on that - only used 1 Teaspoon Real Lemon juice from the bottle - I can't taste the lemon, but... the hummus is excellent!  I was careful to pour off any extra liquid from the non-fat yogurt before adding and I used my blender.  My blender had a bit of a time with the thickness - had to stop and stir several times - probably should have broke out the food processor.  Thanks for the recipe - I have saved it in my favorites!

Love this! Mine wasn't runny at all. I added a little tahini but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. It was different than I'm used to, which I loved. I'll be making this again.

I make my own hummus about once a week. Was a little concerned about the proportion of liquid to the beans so I used one can beans, 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 C lemon juice, 1/4 C non fat yogurt and added 1 tsp cumin, a few dashes of paprika. I thought it was quite good and I will probably start using yogurt instead of tahini from now on because it is much lower fat, lower cal and I eat a lot of it. Next time I will try thicker 2%  greek yogurt for a more creamy texture. Great idea, thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe! I'm not to picky with measurements on something like this, so I just eyeballed the lemon juice. I also left out the salt. I used 4 oz yogurt. It's really light compared to other hummus, so it's good for something different! Will try again.

I liked this a lot. I used Greek yogurt and half the lemon ( although I may add more to the left overs). I also added about a 2 tbsp of tahini, a bit of cumin, and a dash of hot sauce. It came out nice and thick. I think the yogurt adds a nice taste and texture. Good recipe!

sal, you did it again!!! This is incredible!!! I cut the lemon juice back to 1/4 c. and the texture and flavor are perfect!!!  For those who are wanting less liquid...use True Lemon, which is real lemon juice in powder form.  But this recipe rocks and I'm going to make it VERY often!!!

I've tried a similar recipe and it was very good but this recipe is missing a very important ingredient...Tahini.  You can't have hummus without tahini.  Also, if you use that much lemon juice you will have soup and not a dip.  I suggest cutting back on the lemon.  Add a little at a time to get the right consistency.

This is pretty good. I used 1/4 cup of yogurt and 1/4 cup of lemon juice and a dash of cumin and it was delish...the tahini was not missing from this recipe.

I love humus and I love lemon.  It was watery.  I mixed it in my Nutribullet. It is super watery.  Next time, I will double the chicpeas and give it a go.  Good flavor.  A little garlicy....
