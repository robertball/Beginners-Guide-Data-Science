We put a little olive oil on the okra and tomatoes, after I sliced the tomatoes pretty thick.  Then we grilled them both, tossed with some salt and pepper and left out the vinegar and onions (not really a fan).   Awesome!! We'll be doing this again!!!

Tip! If you are in a hurry, instead of grilling the okra, put them on a plate and microwave for about 3 minutes or until color turns bright green, and then mix it with the tomato mixture. It doesn't provide as much flavor, but it is quite good and very convenient.

Love it! I made it indoors in a skillet over the stove with a little bit of olive oil. Also, I accidentally got white cooking wine instead of white wine vinegar. I just used rice vinegar with a splash of the white wine, and it still came out wonderful!

What a good salad. I had to use frozen okra pods, since okra isn't in season anymore, and I "grilled" them on the stovetop, since my grill is covered in 8 inches of snow. I oiled my skillet and grilled the pods over medium-high heat. It still worked out pretty well. Thanks for the recipe.

This salad was ok.  I couldn't find white wine vinegar at the store, so I used balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing instead.  I think I'd like the grilled okra by itself better.

We made this with okra that had been sliced, and then sauteed in just oil until it stopped being stringy, then a little longer.  It was even good the next day (a little slimy, but surprisingly little).  I'm sure it wouldn't be great after even another day, at least, not to me, but we loved this.
