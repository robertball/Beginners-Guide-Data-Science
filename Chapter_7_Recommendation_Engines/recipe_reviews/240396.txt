I loved everything about this and will make it over and over again. The possibilities are endless as to what it would go good with. Buttermilk is not something I keep on hand but it is so simple to make your own. Fill a measuring cup just shy of a cup of milk and then add a tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and let it sit for 10-15 minutes and there you have your cup of "buttermilk". This was great on salad and perfect as a dipping sauce too. 5 stars all the way!

This is the closest copycat recipe I have found to Cafe Rio's house dressing. My family practically drinks it. Don't over-blend it.

LOVED this dressing!! Made a type of Baja Salad then topped with this dressing and it was amazing! We took it to a New Years Eve party and everyone raved about it. Will be making this again and sharing, thank you!

I've never had this before,  and especially never made it. Was looking for a different kind of sauce to put on my street tacos. THIS WAS DEFINITELY IT!!!! I added a cup of sour cream to this recipe and withheld the tamillo. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!! Plus it was a great tortilla chip dip too.

This is outstanding!  Can add 1/2 avocado but it's great as written.

Did it just like the recipe said, except I didn’t have time to let it refrigerate for an hour. We used it on top of a simple meatless taco salad. It was delicious, and it stayed fresh in the fridge for at least a week (by which time we’d finished it).

I was looking for a recipe like the ranch dressing at Don Pablos and this was delicious.  It was the first time using tomatillos and I will definitely be making this again.

No changes were made.  Tastes just like I imagined.  Also, if you're looking for the Pollo Tropical creamy cilantro dressing, this tastes just like it
