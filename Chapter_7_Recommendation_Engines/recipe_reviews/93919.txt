I made a few changes in the recipe...I stuffed the whole jalapeno instead of the half and then wrapped it in bacon, also on some of them i stuffed some shredded mozzarella cheese with the shrimp and then wrapped. I also sprayed the outside with some italian salad dressing spray.....they were a HIT!!!

great recipe!! everyone loved it and i'll definatly make it again. The second time i coated the peppers in a little oil and placed them in the oven for a while. i left the seeds in for the par bake so they would release their heat. i also cooked the bacon on a skillet so it would get a little crispier on the grill.

This was awesome!  My boyfriend and our friends looooved this, only I messed up on the bacon part.  I bought 28 shrimp but only one package of bacon so I had to cut the bacon in half and it worked out.  I took the other person's advice about cheese - I cut up blocks of Monterey Jack.  Absolutely yummy, and I'll stick with half a slice of bacon.

Awesome! I made two changes: 1) I partially cooked the bacon prior to preparing. 2) I added a small piece (the size of the jalapeno) of Monterey Jack cheese, which I put under the shrimp. These were so good and easy too. Next time I would parboil the peppers for perhaps 60 seconds so they aren't quite so crunchy. Other than that-perfection!!

Outstanding! I made this with whole jalapenos, and stuffed them with a little cream cheese as well as the marinated shrimp. I also used half a slice of bacon per pepper, which was plenty. They they were a bit fiddly to make, the end result was definitely worth it. Amazing! Thanks so much!

These are amazing over a bed of white rice. I added in basil pepper jack cheese to the wrap and it really added a different dimension. While these are spicy, it somehow balances out with the crispy bacon and white rice. Wonderful.

These are absolutely delicious! I whipped up a quick sauce that included light sour cream, a little ff mayo, salsa, dill, onion flakes and garlic powder to dip these in and they were a complete hit with my husband and his friend.  I will definitely make these again!  Thank you for such a quick, easy and tasty recipe!

Very good. followed the recipe exactly except I used only a 1/2 slice of bacon to wrap them in and instead of putting them on skewers I used toothpicks to secure and laid them right on the grill. Love this one!

These are Awesome! I've made them four times for our different groups of people. They are always a hit, you don't have to do anything other than follow the recipe. They are easy to make and delicious.

Honestly, these were just ok. Maybe my jalapeños were too big, but the shrimp and bacon were overwhelmed by jalapeño. I might try it again with smaller jalapeños, but am limited by what is for sale at the store.

These are fantastic! I do have a couple of recommendations that I hope help. You really need to use jumbo shrimp to get the right  shrimp/jalapeno ratio. For the bacon I suggest frying it up some prior to grilling it. If not,  the shrimp will get way overcooked by the time the bacon is brown. Keep in mind that the lime juice "cooks" the shrimp too so if you like your peppers really soft you will need to cook them some prior to grilling as well. These are a little tricky to assemble but well worth the trouble. 5 stars all the way!

I served this to 4 of us and none of us thought the combination was great. :(
