We grew turnips in our garden for the first time this year, and they grew like crazy.  This recipe is great and I would totally use it again!  I left out the sugar, since it was not Thanksgiving and we didn't need any extra sugar.  My family is not really fond of turnips, but we ate this all gone.  It tastes like brocoli with white cheese melted over them... Not bad for turnips!

Turnips are not my favorite vegetable but this is a really good dish. I made it just as the recipe stated but tripled for my big family. The kids even ate it without complaint.

I tried turnips for the first time ever tonight.  These were delicious!  The only changes I made was I simmered 3 turnips and  reserved 1 cup of the water that I boiled the turnips in, as I wanted to return the taste and nutrients back into the recipe, so I used the water instead of milk.  I have 3 turnips left and I will be making this recipe again very soon!  Thank you.

I was excited by all the positive reviews.  I always like the taste of turnips in my soups so I wanted to try it as a side. It was disappointed. It did not have enough flavor.  I think that maybe adding tarragon would help.  Also, maybe adding some carmelized onions would also help.  Will be looking for another turnip recipe...

I've never had turnips before but I got some for free from a friends garden so I thought I'd try this recipe.  This dish was pretty easy to make and had a nice subtle flavor. It would make a good side dish instead of potatoes for any meat.

I had never tried a turnip until I tried out this recipe. I bought 5 small ones, as my grocery store does not carry large ones. I modified the recipe a bit, I made a larger amount of roux and added more milk-must say, it is very tasty and I agree with the other post that says it tastes like broccoli with cheese sauce! Can't wait to try more turnip recipes. Thanks!

This was the favorite of my dads!  He ask for this a lot, so mom would make it often for him.  My brother and I both liked it too.  A real southern way of fixing turnips quickly for supper after working the fields all day.

At first I followed the recipe to a tee. Too much "goo" and not enough turnip. Also, that "goo" was super plain, and on top of that, basically just tasted like thick milk. I tried to add cheese and salt to try to make it more like a turnip au gratin, but then it was just slightly-cheesy-and-more-flavorful-milk "goo". Oh well. I tried. As my husband said afterward, if there was only about 1/3 of the milk mixture it'd have probably tasted better. One other thing I thought about trying but forgot to mix in to "rescue" it-garlic powder. I added it on top at the end and it worked a bit better, it would have more so I believe had it been mixed in.
