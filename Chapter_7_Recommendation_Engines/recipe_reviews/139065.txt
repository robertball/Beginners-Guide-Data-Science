I've made this recipe several times with no changes whatsoever. Which is why I'm reviewing it AS IS, unlike many reviewers here who rate the recipe then proceed to list 5-25 changes. Not fair to the issuers of these recipes. I love to read recipes, but it really scrapes my rear-end to have all these "ratings" that include a jillion changes and modifications. Please respect the generous souls that share their recipes here! (By the way, this mac-n-cheese recipe is great for those of us on the run) Prepare it like the recipe states, THEN make changes if you wish. If your changes are delicious, be daring and post a new recipe. But don't be surprised when others completely change your recipe then have the audacity to give you a low rating. (Soap box closed)

I was really excited to try out this recipe. The final dish came was excellent. I did however make the following modifications. 1. I used Chorizo sausage which I first browned along with a can ( 4 oz. ) of green chiles and around 10 oz of picante sauce ( medium ). Salt and peppered 2. Removed from heat and cut the browned sausage ( 1 lb ) in rounds ( still pink in center ) and added to slow cooker - which already had the cheddar soup and water mixed in.  3. Added a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning. 4. Cooked for an additional hour on High, and added another 3/4 cup water. I also did not stir frequently as I think this defeats the purpose of a slow cooker. 5. Added extra cheddar cheese. I let it this dish sit overnight as well. Very well received by my wife. There was a nice background heat to a traditional baked mac and cheese taste. This was not a standard creamy out of the box Velveeta meal.

This recipe was really easy and tasted great.  I used turkey kielbasa and browned it first.  Next time I will add the kielbasa with the cheese and sour cream as it kind of took over the flavor of the rest of the dish.  Also, I found that using whole wheat pasta made it less mushy and added some nutrition!

This was really bad.  I only cooked the pasta for an hour and a half and it was total MUSH.  Not only was it mushy, the cheese flavor was way too much.  If I made this again, and I won't, I would omitt the mozarella.

AWESOME! Everyone in my family loved it! Even my fiance who is picky about just everything gave it a third helping status. We used the kielbasa and it came out great. THANK YOU!

The shells were mushy, I only cooked it an hour. It would have been better to cook the shells on the stove and add them in at the end. The flavor was pretty good.

I made this without the meat and found there weren't enough noodles so I boiled some more and added them after.  The noodles that were cooked in the slow cooker were very mushy but I kind of liked them that way (I am pregnant though).  It was annoying to have to get up and stir so often.  If I make it again I'll probably only cook it for an hour to avoid the mushy noodles and constant stirring.

This was excellent but I made a few changes. 1) I used 1.5c shredded Cheddar cheese and 1/2c Mozzarella. 2) I used half a kielbasa instead of a spicy sausage. 3) I didn't season at all, it was already enough from the soups. My son (23m) ate his entire bowl and my husband went back for seconds.  I will change the cheeses next time and probably use less water (way too much sauce).  I'll try different pasta (smaller) and more kielbasa.

Made exactly as directed.  The noodles became total mush long before the allotted time.  I didn't care for the sausage and since it was not in for very long, its flavor did not permeate the dish, and the sausage itself didn't get nice and soft like other sausage slow cooker recipes that I make.  Add to that the cost of this recipe after you hunt down andouille sausage (6.99 for the package, the ONLY type at my grocery store) and I was looking at $15 for a pretty generic meal.  It seems like this would be made just as easily making the sauce on the stove and preparing the noodles separately to give them the best consistency. On the positives - I thought that the sauce was really great.  It's nice and creamy and quite tasty.  I know it seems blasphemous to not use real cream or milk in mac and cheese but I always find that dishes made with cream sauce never reheat very nicely. If I make this again I will forget the sausage and go straight for mac-n-cheese, and only if I can get the entire dish for under $5

I just wanted to start off saying that I omitted the sausage since no one in my house is a sausage fan. Besides that, I followed the directions to a T, I stirred often, etc., but the end result was not so good. The pasta was very "glue like" and completely lost its shape, I actually had to cut into it since it was to mushy to scoop out. Unfortunately, it wasn't a hit, but I'm rating it 4 stars, because I didn't add the sausage and that may have been why this recipe didn't turn the way I expected.

Ive made this 3 or 4 times now just like it says to. I think its great and very easy. It definately helps to stir every 15 to 30 mins though. Made a double batch this time!

Very good but I would suggest using only 1/2 cup of each type of cheese.  Mine came out way too cheesy using 1 cup of each type.  Also the sausage taste takes over.  I didnt mind but my wife did.

I made this without the meat and it came out delicious.  The pasta was definitely overcooked, but not in a particularly bad way.  The sauce was very cheesy and thick.

I think I may have added the sour cream too late, but the noodles were very soft, overcooked, and the whole dish was a little soupy and not very well homogenized due partly to my mistake.

Made this according to directions and the consistency was awful.  It was entirely too thick and extremely difficult to scoop out of the crockpot.  I would make this again, but in the oven.

I forgot to take a pic of this, but it turned out pretty ok. I had to alter the recipe because I found out that condensed cheese sauce has wheat flour in it and I have Ciliac. I used Velveeta Cheese Sauce packets (They don't specifically state they have wheat flour) and GF elbow noodles (Theres not a noticeable difference between real noodles and these. I used 1/2 a cup of milk along with water. The andouille  that i bought was spicy as hell.  I would use a different meat next time. I also read on another comment that the noodles turn really mushy. I would have to agree, the noodles ended up getting really mushy after some time. Otherwise, it was pretty good ! I would make some adjustments from the first time, but really tasty!

like any pasta recipe, it is important to check on it to determine the texture.  Everyone's slow cooker cooks at a different rate.  the same with stove top pasta.  taste the dish at different stages, be conscious of your own testes, AND STOP GIVING A RECIPE A 5 STAR BASED ON YOUR CHANGES!!!  Post your own recipe with the changes.  then see how you like it to have your recipe given 5 stars only to read that they made a dozen changes to it, essentially rating THEIR recipe, not yours.

I made it in hopes that it would be a good cheese sauce.  I gave it a three because the sauce just wasn’t right for my liking.  A guest that I had over liked it so 50/50.   I sent the rest home with my guest.

The noodles turned to paste after an hour of cooking.

I followed the recipe but it took about 4 hours to cook fully. Second time I used extra sausage, and cheese. :)

I dropped the andouille - just not my taste, but added some chili powder!  Loved this recipe.  So cheesy and tasty and easy!

Me and my co worker tried this recipe two different ways:

1)Slow cooker: We used all ingredients, this was not that good at all, didnt really have a taste to it. It was mushy as the other reviews stated, The noodles had no form anymore, however i do agree it was cheesy, but i love cheesy mac

2)Baked: We used all ingredients advised but instead of in the slow cooker, we put it in the oven and instead of andouille sausage we used chorizo. It was pretty good, although seemed a little bland to me but alot better than the slow cooker way however, baking it definitely needed more cheese.

This was really good, and I am a fan of using raw pasta.  My only complaint was that it seemed a little dry, so I added a bit more water (I like creamy mac and cheese).  I will try this again.

This was GREAT! We had Mexican Pork Chorizo on hand and used that. We also spiced it up a bit with some Tapatio Hot Salsa...too spicy for the kids, but great for us! If you didn't want any meat in it, it would still be fabulous!
