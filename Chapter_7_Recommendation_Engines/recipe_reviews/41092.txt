I  lightened up this recipe with lean ground beef, fat free sour cream, reduced fat cream cheese and fat free cottage cheese---it was still very good--very rich.  I think next time I will use a little more spice in the meat mixture ie garlic and perhaps use a little less cheese mixture.  Overall it was very good and my husband told me I could make this anytime for him--it's true--men do love it!!!! :)  Thanks for an easy good recipe!!!! After ligthening it up--it was only 6 weight watcher points for a serving and very filling!

This is a great "poor-man's" lasagna. The only item that I found a bit overpowering (eventhough I measured correctly) was the cinnamon. I would try this recipe again only without the cinnamon. Overall, very tasty.

This is creamy delicious stuff when made according to the recipe. 
I have been making this for years. It is high in fat, but it is easy and inexpensive, and it is true, Men do love it! I suggest to everyone that you make it as written. I too wanted to doctor up the tomato sauce, but when you do that you loose the lovely green onion flavour that should be the star in this recipe. I also use real butter, and omit the green peppers.  Try it!

Very good. I made a more hearty spaghetti sauce then this recipe called for. (using garlic, herbs and spices, ect) I also added about 1 cup of grated Monterey jack cheese to the filling, and I topped it with grated cheddar. Hearty and good!

Although this recipe was easy to prepare, the dish did not have much flavor at all. Sorry but I don't think I would make it again. If I were I would use salsa instead of tomato sauce for an extra boost

I used ground chicken and Penne pasta because that was all I had.  I also substituted the new Campbell's creamy ranchero tomato soup for part of the tomato sauce and left out the sour cream.  Might need to season the meat a little next time, some paprika or garlic maybe.  Overall, it was good!

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe, except I used homemade meat sauce leftover from spaghetti 2 days ago.  The result: stunning!  Let it rest (cool) in the pan about 20 minutes before serving and it will cut nicely into squares for an attractive presentation.

I omitted the butter totally. Didn't see any need for it at all. I added 1 tbsp of garlic, tsp oregano, and parsley, 1 cp ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese,and 3/4 cp sour cream for the cheese mixture. I mixed in 1 can rotell with 1 1/2 lbs of ground meat instead of the 1 lb ground meat. I layered the nooodles, cheese mix, and meat, topped with mozzerella cheese, then repeated a second time. Left everything else the same in the recipe! I did let it sit for about 15 minutes to cool. YUM YUM!

This is a real crowd pleaser.  In my house the "crowd " is me and my 9 yr old son and it's hard to please both of us.  Since I am under doctors orders to eat low fat, I used extra lean ground turkey, fat free cottage cheese, low fat sour cream and only 4 oz of low fat cream cheese and it was still good!  Next time I will add a few spices since it is a bit bland using so many low fat ingredients; but, it's still great.

I really wanted to love this.  I thought I would.  I definitely didn't.  I thought it had way too much of the cottage cheese mixture.  I thought it could use an extra pound of ground beef and a can of petite diced tomatoes in the sauce.  Some seasoning in the sauce, some sugar, salt, pepper, oregano.  And I would cut the cottage cheese and cream cheese in half.  I will try it again that way and see how I feel about it.

UMMMM A HEALTHY DISH-  FOR ME TONIGHT THOUGH-  BRING ON THE FATTY RICH COMFORT- YUMMMMMMM

I husbands mother had given me a recipe very very similar to this a few years ago. It is one of my husbands casserole dishes. In her recipe you mix the cottage cheese mixture with the noodles and alternate layers of meat sauce and the noodle mixture. I also added garlic powder to the meat while it was browning and to the egg noodles.. It is a tasty recipe the makes a lot, and everyone in my family loves it.

I used a 12 oz. bag of egg noodles-for 8 servings-but didn't add any extra sauce or anything. I probably should have. I used one can of tomato sauce and instead of the other can I used spaghetti sauce. The bell pepper and onion was not fully cooked, it should have been cooked with the ground beef. I pretty much followed this recipe as instructed. It was filling, the leftovers were good, but it somewhat lacked in flavor. My husband didn't like it too much, but he's not a fan of anything with noodles in it. It wasn't hard to do, but I don't think I'll be making it again. Also, my 3-year-old ate it and I didn't hear any complaints.

Very good.  I took the advice of others and used 24 oz of tomato sauce.  I also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and some Italian seasoning.

My boyfriend has practically inhaled this cassarole.  I like it, it's very rich, but one thing I would change is to saute the green pepper before adding it in.  That's just a personal preference, I like my veggies to be hidden :).

Very good homey dish. I did change it up a littl for our tastes. Instead of the green onions, I sauted some chopped yellow onion with some sliced fresh onions, and then added ground turkey ( we're trying to lighten up where we can).  I added garlic powder, cajun seasoning and worcheshire to the sauce. We enjoyed this with some Italian zucchini and tomatoes as a side.

This recipe was given to me by one of my professors in 1967. She had prepared it for an informal dinner for a few students at her home and we all loved it. She called it Thora's Hamburger. HOWEVER, she made the following additions: Add 1 tsp. oregano, 1/2 tsp. basil or 1/4 tsp. thyme, and a 4 oz. can of mushrooms to the tomato sauce. It makes all the difference. 3 stars as is, but 5 stars for an easy & tasty comfort food dinner. Omit the butter/margarine if you like. Use oil or pan spray.

I thought this was really bland even though I added extra salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and garlic powder to both the meat and cheese mixtures.  It also came out really dry.  That might be because I baked it an extra 10 minutes (I had made the meat mixture in advance, so it was cold from the fridge and wasn't heated through in 30 minutes), but the onions and peppers were still crunchy anyway.  It might turn out better if you use pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce,double the sauce amount so it's not so dry, and cook the onions and peppers first.  I probably won't make this again.

We are not fans of cottage cheese so I changed it to Ricotta cheese and instead of egg noodles I used Penne pasta, that is what I had on hand. I couldn't get beyond the strong cream cheese taste. I had to really DR up the sauce with added spices, but that is because I am spoiled and usually make my own pasta sauce, never use it from a can. But...my husband and two kids ate it up, thus the 4 stars! I actually would make this dish again, only using my homemade pasta sauce and omitting the sour cream and cream cheese and would add some mozzerella into the dish.

This is very, very good. I used spaghetti sauce rather than only tomato, left out the green pepper, and covered the top with lots of mozzarella cheese. It's wonderful.

My family loves this casserole and it is on our regular menu rotation.  I do make a few changes.  First, I always double the recipe because it is great as leftovers! I do not use the butter or green onions at all, I just add a little more chopped green pepper. I also put 2 packets of spaghetti seasoning mix into the sauce and meat mixture (less or more to taste) and simmer 5 minutes before adding mixture to casserole dish and baking.

Followed the recipe the first time I made it and liked it - thus the four stars.  The second time I made it I added a couple of healthy shakes of hot sauce and baked with shredded cheddar on top.  Family really like it that way - cheesy, creamy goodness. Thank you for posting this comforting recipe!

Comfort food at its best! My mom got this recipe from the Washington post in 1969. Only change is that the original recipe calls for *two* pounds of meat! Our personal preference was to do 12 oz of noodles and real butter as well and no green peppers. Enjoy!!!

I thought this was a very good weeknight meal, with great leftovers.
First, I used REAL butter instead of margarine, just a personal choice I guess.  And as some other reviewers suggested, I used a jar of my favorite store-bought spaghetti sauce instead of the plain tomato sauce, and used most of the jar.  Low fat cream cheese and cottage cheese worked great, and I also covered the top of the casserole with grated sharp cheddar cheese for the last couple of minutes in the oven.
Good served with a green salad.  Very similar to a lasagna.
