Very simple and very tasty.  I baked the pork chops due to sub-zero temps outside, and they turned out very good.  I used a little seasoning salt, and about 10 mins from complete I topped with store bought apple sauce and shredded cheddar cheese.  Very good!  The picky fiance enjoyed as well.

Very easy and very good. The apples and cheese are a different yet delicious flavor combination to go with the pork. I will definately be using this recipe again!

We sampled this recipe along-side another pork chop recipe.  This one was very quick and easy to make, and it allowed my husband to 'help out' by cooking on the grill!  The apple and cheese topping was delicious, and went nicely with the pork.

This was a nice easy recipe that I would recommend to anyone wanting a little different flavor. Apples & cheddar cheese on pork chops; awesome! Thanks for the recipe! Traci H.
