This was awesome.  One modification, as per some earlier readers' comments:  Before doing anything, I browned six strips of bacon in the large skillet, removed them and let them drain.  Then, I added the veggies to the bacon fat and proceeded as described (with clam juice, water, etc.)  Crumbled the bacon into the soup after it was all combined.  Adds fat, but a huge flavor too.  Simply outstanding recipe here -- I love the red wine vinegar idea.  Thank you!!

Very good base recipe but definitely does not warrant five stars. To increase flavor, I substituted clam juice for the water, added bacon grease in leiu of half the butter.  The bacon grease, while not exactly healthy, gave the chowder a better flavor (IMPORTANT NOTE:  You must let the roux cook down before adding the half and half ~ this will eliminate the flour taste that so many are noting in their reviews). Added 1/2 teaspoon of Bay Seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder for more flavor.  Used a mix of chopped and minced clams and substituted 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt for a portion of the 1 1/2 teaspoon regular salt.  Stirred only 1 tablespoon of the vinegar into the chowder prior to serving.  Topped the chowder with crumbled bacon and a few chives for color.  Helpful Tips:  For a smokey flavor, add 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke which adds depth and complexity to the chowder base.  Add fresh grilled corn cut off the cob which increases the smokey flavor.  Replace black ground pepper with white pepper ~ it has a more delicate flavor than the ground black pepper which can be rather harsh with such a creamy base.  Most Important:  Do not add the clams to the chowder until you are ready to serve ~ the longer seafood "cooks" the tougher it becomes!  Delicious with the changes.

I have been a clam chowder fan for as long as I can remember.  I order clam chowder often - when it's available.  This recipe is exceptional and compares favorably with the best clam chowder recipes I've tasted in fine restaurants.  I did the bacon thing as many other reviewers recommended.  I'm glad I did.  It added just one more interesting taste element to this already fantastic flavored soup.  I prefer my soup thick, so I used all 1/2 & 1/2 as well as a trace of heavy whipping cream that I wanted to get rid of.  When the soup was slightly thicker than even I like, I thinned it out ever so slightly with a little skim milk.  The only recommendation I might add, for those that prefer the consistency of more substantial clam;  get the chopped clam instead of the minced.  I think that's what I'll do next time I fix this, which will be often!  It's good enough to be an award winning soup!

Very good recipe and is now a keeper in my personal recipes.  I left out the celery and carrots due to veggie pickiness in the family and was concerned that would affect the overall flavor.  Not a bit.  Interestingly, I tasted it prior to adding the salt and red wine vinegar.  VERY bland, uninteresting.  I added the salt, OK, that picked it up so that it started to taste like clam chowder.  But the real kick was the vinegar.  It brought it all together with a great taste!  BTW, as suggested by others I used all clam juice instead of water, added some bacon and sauted the onion in the bacon fat before adding the potatoes and clam juice.  Minor changes but bacon just sounded so good.  Well done, Sharon!

My husband and I are both loved this clam chowder. I changed it alittle by cooking the onions in drippings from 4 slices of bacon and reducing the amount of butter. I also used 5 cans of whole baby clams. We are both from Maine and this is better than most restaurants up there.

Delicious!!  I make this recipe twice a month. Following other reviews, I use cornstarch instead of flour. I heat the cream (fat free) over low heat, while the vegetables are simmering. I mix 3/4 cornstarch in with 1/4 cup milk, then add that to the cream. I don't use the red wine vinegar, b/c I don't think it needs it. I also add Old Bay seasoning, garlic and onion powder, and I use dried minced onion instead of fresh. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

This is a good clam chowder recipe. However, when I first made this I felt that the half and half made it too thick like a stew. Since then I have used milk and it's much better. I also use chopped clams instead of minced. Thanks Sharon!

We lapped this stuff up!  I was dubious first because there was a lot of vegetables and juice in the first mixture, but it all mixed together wonderfully! 

I also used part half&half and part skim milk and it was still VERY rich.  I also added some chopped fresh parsley at the very end and will try it with some bacon next time, although honestly it does'nt need it.

I also recommend using bottled clam juice in place of the water if you like more of a sea taste for your chowder and I used 3 cans of chopped clams and 2 cans of minced.  It makes a LOT of leftovers and I froze them for a later meal.

I am a chef and make clam chowder in restaurants and catering and use a similar recipe when I make it.  This recipe seems quite solid but here is what I do if anyone wants to try a little spin on it.  I add some fresh garlic to the sauteed veggies while they cook in bacon fat with a dash of butter(salt pork or ham hocks also work well here)  I do not use any onion at all but substitute shallot instead and nearly carmalize all the veggies first.  I do not use any half and half but instead use an extra can (or make your own) clam juice/stock and make up for the added water content by using heavy cream.   You wont need quite as much heavy cream as it calls for half and half and it still comes out nice and creamy with a little more clam flavor.  I add the chopped crispy bacon and clams towards the end of the cooking process as to not have tough clams or rubbery bacon with less flavor.  Try it out if you like...i also cook soup with a couple bay leaves, a little celery salt, thyme and a couple other minor adds that i like in clam chowder.

This is now my best clam chowder. It was fantastic! I made it pretty much as is with only slight changes. I used 4 cans of clams, next time I will use 5 because the hubby loves a lot of clams and use whole BABY clams. I will nix the carrots as it is I just used half a cup but the hubby dislikes like cooked carrots so he wasn't crazy about that and quite frankly I've never had carrots in my chowda. Next time I will try it adding   some bacon as was the other half's suggestion and I didn't even mention the other reviews to him. And I used clam juice instead of water. An 8oz bottle with the juice from 4 cans of clams was enough to cover the veggies. The red wine vinegar in it was outta this world! never in a million years would I have guessed it. What a superb super secret ingredient! This is getting written in my family favorites book tonight! I served it it warm bread bowls, perfect for a cold rainy new england day.  Side note: we like our chowda thick so I cooked it a little longer to where it was thicker than pancake batter before adding the veggies and juice. Perfect! If its to think for you then it can be thinned with a little milk.  ****Update**** I entered this in a Contest and took second with it after my husband said there was no way a flatlander could win in New England with Chowder. It was my first time trying to reheat it in a crock pot, I made the night before and didnt add the clams or red wine vinegar as well as left the potatoes and veggies a little more firm. 3

This dish would have been perfect but I strayed from the recipe and added 2 cans of CHOPPED clams instead of just minced clams.......they were very gritty....
NOW I SEE WHY YOU HAVE TO USE THE TINY ONES....We just like more clams instead of potatoes.......but next time we'll just use the tiny clams ONLY....it was great all the same, A+ IN OUR BOOKS!

Good recipe but I made some changes.  On the ingredient list I added 4 slices of diced bacon, increased potatoes to 3 cups, added 3 cloves garlic (diced), added 1 can chicken broth, reduced butter to 1/2 cup and reduced all-purpose flour to 1/4 cup and the next time will reduce red wine vineger down to 1.5 T.  On the directions I sauteed the bacon in a 5 quart dutch oven over medium heat.  When crisp I added the onions, celery and garlic until they started to get translucent.  I later added the carrots and 5 minutes later added the potatoes.  I let them cook for about 5 minutes and then added the clam juice and instead of water added the chicken broth - just enough to barely cover.  I added some salt and pepper and brought to a simmer for about 20 minutes.  In the meantime in a small saucepan I melted the 1/2 cup butter and wisked in the 1/4 cup flour - I then added the half and half until this got thick.  I then poured this over the vegetable, clam juice and chicken broth mixture and later added the clams as informed below and also the vinegar.  My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  Thank you Pioneergirl... (I know I made some changes but you gave an excellent base recipe and I just incorporated some changes from my years of experience in making fish and clam chowders).

I have added this recipe to my recipe box and  plan to make it as soon as I stock up on the clams.  I love reading the reviews for all of the recipes.  Have to laugh though when a recipe is rated "the best I have ever tasted" and then lists all the changes they made.  GAW

Delish.... Ok, I made a few changes but not many. First let me start off by saying that if you like your chowder on the thicker side just cook the half & half mixture a bit longer. Come on people! That is cooking 101. Now that I got that out of the way, I did cook off 6 strips of bacon and then put the veggies in the grease along with the juice from 2 cans of whole baby clams as well as a small jar of clam juice. I did not use water nor the minced clams. I used 2 10oz cans of whole baby clams to really get that full clam taste I like. Also, using the clam juice instead of the water does not make it too clammy at all but instead just right when mixed all together. Other than those 3 changes i cooked the recipe exactly as written. I think next time I will add some corn though as I personally love corn in chowder. This was delish. Thanks for the recipe!

I peeled and cubed 6 med potatoes, with garlic, diced onion, and frozen corn and boiled this in clam juice and water til tender. I diced leftover Green lipped mussels, shrimp, and slip lobster tails, and added this to the veggies near the end to prevent the seafood from becoming rubbery. I also used 2 cups half-n-half and 2 cups of 2% milk, omited the flour, and used 1/4 cup corn starch instead (no flour taste).  I used another recipe idea (found on this site) and added 8 oz of cream cheese with the milk, stirring til smooth.  And don't forget the red wine vinegar! It brings out the flavor of the seafood!  This chowder was so creamy and just the right thickness with loads of flavor!  It is also great as leftovers the next day, if you have any leftover that is!  10 stars!!!

I learned how to make clam chowder from my Nova Scotian mother and the first part of the process was to boil some patatoes with extra water, mash them and that became the thickener rather than flour. Now I simply use more patatoes to adjust the desired thickness

Cooking potatoes in the clam juice soaks it up and makes the rest of the soup lack any real clam flavor. Waay too much flour, that was all I could really taste. Recipe lacks any real flavor, which is obvious by looking at the recipe after making a quality clam chowder.

If you want real clam Chowdah, forget the flour. It adds nothing to the flavor, and in fact detracts from it. New Englanders make theirs thick through the natural  action of the cooked potatoes.

I've been looking for an actual "Chowder" recipe NOT "Soup" and I have finally found it.  Some of the other recipes have a lighter soupy consistency, so if that's what you're looking for, then this is not the recipe for you.  My son, who does not like clam chowder, surprisingly had seconds last night.  I have found the perfect recipe for my family and friends.  I did make some modifications, to our taste.  I added a bottle of clam juice, an extra can of clams and 2 cans of canned shrimp.  Note: If you use the full quart of half-and-half, it will come out VERY creamy.  I had to add some milk and some cornstarch to even out the flavor. I left out the red-wine vinegar to be added invidiually by family members as not everyone liked the vinger added.  I also left out the carrots, seeing as they don't really fit into the clam chowder.  Otherwise, this was an excellent thick and creamy chowder, just like our family likes it.

I wanted to make some Clam Chowder so I decided to try this recipe and I am glad that I did since it turned out very good with some cheddar cheese added to the soup to give it some better flavour and improve the texture of it.  I put both light cream and 2 % Milk which I think gives it the same amount of sweetness that all cream would give which I think has kicked it up a notch with my new addition.

Definitely the bacon, YES! I also use red skinned potatoes, leaving the skin on. Makes it pretty. And finish by adding green onion & parsley at the end. Yummy!!

This tasted like bechemel sauce with potatoes. No other flavors came through, and I followed the directions exactly. Perhaps I am used to stronger tasting clam chowder, but this tasted like nothing. After a lot more spices added, it tasted like potato soup, which was still better than the original turnout.

Made tonight with a few changes. Browned 6 pieces of chopped bacon (husband requested), removed bacon, then sautéed celery and onion and a bit of minced garlic in the drippings. Added the juice of 4 cans of clams (again, husband requested extra clamminess) and chopped red potatoes, needed no extra water to cover. Made the roux with 1 stick butter and 3/4 cup flour and 1 qt whole milk. Simmered while whisking until thick and potatoes were cooked through. Combined all in Dutch oven and warmed through. Added a splash of red wine vineagar to our bowls. Served with crusty ciabatta rolls. Ah. Maxing. Silky smooth and creamy and delicious and savory. Will be making again and again.

This clam chowder knocked my socks off!  I did saute my onions in a little bacon grease and added some chopped bacon at the end, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  I was curious to see what the vinegar would do to the recipe.  I tasted it before and after adding the vinegar, and all I can say is that it is an integral component.  Don't even consider leaving it out.  Thanks for the awesome recipe, PG- I can't wait to make it again!

Very mediocre. A lot of the reviews tell a tale of all the things they did to change it - all these things were done to make it good, and the original recipe is really not that good.
It is a tad thick, and has almost no real flavor. It is a mash of floured cream with clam and veggies. I didn't even notice the vinegar doing anything to spruce it up.
All that being said, it is a great base recipe. Add whatever you like, revore what you dont. The bacon is a good add, and clam juice instead of water for a fuller clam flavor. I think a dash of cayenne pepper would kick it up enough to make it tasty.
I will make it again, and modify it heavily, but this recipe is not the 5 stars it has been voted.

Excellent clam chowder.  I also made a few minor changes just because I remembered my mother doing it, fried up about 4 strips of bacon (I know we would sometimes have chopped up ham - and wouldn't hesitate to add if I had some on hand).  I used baby whole clams instead of minced, and used the juice from the cans and extra juice from the bottled clam juice to cover vegetables.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

This was he first time I tried making clam chowder and it came out great. As others suggested, I fried 4 or 5 slices of bacon until crispy and sauteed the vegetables in the drippings. Other changes I made were using 2 cans of minced clams and 2 cans of chopped; increasing the potatoes to about 4 cups; I used light half-and-half and light butter to try to cut down on the fat and calories, and it still came out creamy and delicious. My fiance is from Massachusetts and she was skeptical of me trying to make "chowdah", but she loved it. I definitely will be making this again.

Great recipe!  I had to change a few things because my cupboards were bare but this recipe is an excellent base for any variation of seafood chowder.  I used 2% milk and mixed it with the flour like a roux, to about a peanut butter color. I also added a can of tuna and a can of salmon because I was short one can of clams and I wanted that fishy taste. I also used homemade chicken broth instead of water to soften the veg.    The results were divine!   Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I've searched for years for a fabulous, creamy New England Clam Chowder recipe.  I found it here!  I scaled the recipe for 12 servings and when all was said and done, I had one small serving left over.  The only thing I changed was that I used a bottle of clam juice instead of water to cover the veggies when cooking.  I'm making an even bigger pot of it for our Daytona 500 party on Sunday!

Minor adjustments and this is AMAZING: I use 5 cans of chopped clams instead of 3 (can you ever have too many?), 1.5 cups chopped onion, 1.5 cups sliced celery, 1.5 cups sliced carrots, and I skip the potatoes.  I also replace the quart of half-and-half with 1 pint half-and-half and 1 pint skim milk.  Made it for Thanksgiving dinner this year, and the entire (HUGE) pot disappeared!  Also perfect for cold days when you need to heat things up a bit, and lasts for a good few meals if you just pair it with some sourdough or french bread.

followed directions exactly.  Like the base, but all you can taste is celery and carrots.  No clam chowder taste at all and expensive to make!

Terrrrrrrific!!! I made it tonight and everyone loved it. Tastes as good as my favorite resturant in Maine. I toke the suggestion to use 5 cans of clams , then I also added a little more clam juice. I also left out the carrots. I'm sure it's good in it but to me clam chowder just dosen't have carrots in it. Will make it again!!

I made this pretty much as written - I left out the carrots because I've never seen carrots in Clam Chowder and I just didn't feel like putting them in. I did use more clams than called for and I didn't use the vinegar - I forgot about it.  That said, we loved this clam chowder.  It was rich, but not too rich and the flavor was delicious.  I think this is my new clam chowder recipe - thanks for a keeper!

A little bland and pasty 

The roux should be cooked more, less butter in it and less roux in general. 

I would add whites of leek

Fresh chopped thyme

White pepper instead of black

Lemon juice instead of vinegar

Clam base instead of salt (no mono-sodium glutamate) 

Cook the potatoes separately

Cook the vegetables in descending order,start with the celery(it takes the longest) then add the onion then the carrot and leek, then add the roux,clam juice and half and half.

I've made this soup twice now with the following changes:  sauteed vegetables in 1/4 cup butter; then added clam juice from 2 cans of baby clams.  I then added 3-4 cups of water and let it all simmer until the veggies were tender.  I added the clams and about 1-2 cups of chopped imitation crab - you could use real crab if you desire for an even more authentic taste.  Mixed this with the butter/flour/cream mixture and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.  My husband goes nuts over this - he's from the East Coast (we live on the Canadian prairies) and he admits it's even better than his mom's back in beautiful Cape Breton!  This is perfection!

I made this chowder as directed and am very disapponted. It had no clam flavor whatsoever despite the fact that I used two bottles of clam juice instead of the water. I will not make this again.

This had a good consistency for chowder. But I thought it tasted like potato soup. I even followed the advice of others and cooked the potatoes and onions in clam juice instead of water. It did not taste like clam chowder at all. I like the thickness of it, but that's about it.

Like others, I used clam juice instead of water,6 strips bacon and cut the butter down to 1/2c.  I also added 2 more cups of potatoes (hubby is a meat and potatoes kind of guy).  We love garlic so addeded 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic too.  Kept the rest the same.  Don't forget the 'magic' vinegar!  Awesome recipe!  I chuckled when I read the one review where the leftovers were frozen for 2 more meals.  Just my husband and I and there weren't any leftovers...we ate it for lunch AND dinner!  Delicious!  I may try it with crab meat next time out of curiosity.

Following other reviews I used 5 cans of clams, but found them to be too much. From then on, I've done this chowder again differing the proportions of the veggies and even adding only 2 cans of clams, depending on what I had on hand. It always turns out delicious!!! I often use milk instead of half-n-half and it works great! This is the best clam chowder I've ever tasted, and even better: it's homemade!!! Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!!  My mom and I made this and absolutely loved the clam chowder.  She said it was the best clam chowder she's had...even the cats were scratching at the door!  I took member comments into consideration and used 2 cups half & half and 2 cups 1% milk to reduce the fat, and also used 4 cans of clams instead of 3.  I can't wait to make this for my boyfriend!  Thanks Sharon.

Completely delicious, but a bit heavy, I might use whole milk next time instead of the half and half.

I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and made some modifications to the recipe. However, to make it even simpler, I used 3-4 cups of frozen hash browns instead of cubing potatoes and bought pre-cooked bacon. It cut down the prep time to under 30 minutes and it was delicious!

I don't eat clam Chowder, but I made it for my husband who loves it. But he asked that I not make it again - he wasn't very satisfied, he ate one bowl & told me to throw the rest away. Probably difference in taste buds. I don't know!

I thought it was fabulous! People who have rude things to say should keep their nasty comments to themselves and only offer constructive criticism. Sad that even on a recipe site people have to be hurtful to others.

This was delicious! The only change I made was to use Fat Free Half and Half and to add clam juice instead of water for the vegetables. Otherwise, the recipe was made as listed and I got rave reviews... just passing the rave reviews on!

I live by the ocean where the restaurants all claim: rated "world's best" chowder & they don't match up to this recipe.  I get a lot of company and the chowder is always well received.  I like to add about 1/4 cup of frozen corn.  I also followed another review and begin wit 3 strips of bacon. Sometimes I use fat-free half & half.

Red wine vinegar was a good addition.  I used others' idea of adding bacon--not sure I really liked it.  But, like I said, adding the red wine vinegar brought out the clam flavor nicely.

This was my first clam chowder and I won't even try another one!  Super yumilicious. I did take a couple of suggestions and added 4 pieces of crispy bacon, more potatoes and baby clams (no celery and carrots, per our own tastebuds).  Just because I felt like it, I added a dash of garlic powder and about 1-2 tbsp of parsley.  My husband and I were fighting over the leftovers! Two thumbs up!

I grew up a stone's throw away from Pismo Beach, California. Clam chowder is EVERYTHING there. Restaurants are judged by the quality of their chowder. I have to say, this one is pretty darn close to perfect. I tried to stay true to the recipe, but I couldn't bring myself to add water, I used a bottle of clam juice instead. 1 bottle was perfect. And, I couldn't bring myself to add the vinegar. That just sounds terrible and ridiculous. It was too perfect already. Perhaps I'll try it sometime in the future. Otherwise, amazing chowder!

While I enjoyed this, my dad and husband both thought it was more like a lobster bisque than clam chowder.  My husband said it was too "flour-y" which I didn't pick up on.  But, I'm not going to make a pot of soup that only I enjoy.

This is an excellent chowder.  This may may make 8 servings but 3 of us polished it off.  I was asked where I got this?  It was too good for me to make? Next time, I will try the bacon as others have suggested.  But this is excellent without it.  Can't wait to make it again. Like soon.

OMG, this was FABULOUS!!!  I am allergic to dairy (cow) so I used canned, evaporated goat's milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2.  Was velvety smooth and lucious.  Also followed others reco and added some chopped crisp bacon, cooking the veggies in the grease and using bottled clam juice instead of water.  Also, cooked the flour/margerine (non dairy) for a few minutes to remove flour taste.  We had tonight for Christmas eve and my husband and I both gorged saying we will serve to a crowd next time with pride.  Simply outstanding.  Thank you for a magnificant new addition to our festivities.

After all the great ratings, I expected much more from this soup. I'm sorry to say that I've had better clam chowder from a can. I will continue to look for the right recipe for me. Thanks for posting.

I made this recipe two times now and I am going to make it again this week. I used the bacon grease but didnt add the bacon. I ate it while cooking the chowder. This recipe is perfect! I didn't change anything. I think it goes without saying you should cook out the roux before adding the other ingredients. Yeah I know the recipe doesn't explicitly say that but anyone who knows how to cook doesn't need it to say that.

We love clam chowder, have enjoyed it from Boston to the Oregon Coast.  This recipe was thick and good, however it lacked  enough clam taste.  I think I would add more clams, maybe some juice. My husband thought it a bit too thick, so the juice would flavor it up as well and thinning it out a bit.  I cut up several strips of bacon browned those and sauted vegetables in the bacon before adding the clam liquor.  I will try it again for sure!

This chowder is awesome. i ommitted the carrots and made up for them with and extra cup of potatoes. my mother didn't like the red wine vinegar so the last few times i've made this recipe 
I've added a splash of white wine in the pan I started the potatoes in and I add 1/2 a cup of chedder cheese 5 minutes before serving.
Also DON'T ADD SALT the clams and thier juice add salt naturally, and salt is one of those things you leave for a picky guest to dicide on AFTER you put the bowl in front of them.

I started following this recipe in 2005. I have not used another one since. I do not always follow it to the Letter though. I add a 1/2 pound of bacon/ham pieces, tsp of curry and tsp of marjoram. My wife and I do our own clamming and crabbing on the Oregon coast. We will use whatever shellfish we have on hand. Any combination of clams or crab works great in this recipe. This recipe is incredibly easy to make. After a while, you can make it by memory. Not a single person who has tried has complained. Almost everybody goes back for seconds.

I've always followed the Betty Crocker recipe, which aside from the bacon is close to this.  Lately, trying to keep things a little healthier, so my adjustments are... instead of bacon I use a smoked chicken breast (it really benefits from the smoky flavor), and instead of 1/2&1/2, I thicken with instant potatoes....

I followed this just as it is...and it turned out fantastic...you always have to cook your rioux before adding anything to it or it will taste like flower.  My husband that it was better than any clam chowder he has had in restaurants.  Definitely a keeper!!

I cooked the veggies in bacon grease seemed to add some flavor. once it was ready to serve, I felt it needed more flavor, added some garlic powder to it. Next time I would double the veggies and add another can of clams to fill it up,  as ther was plenty of broth. also used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 and 2 cups of 2% milk didn't have the full amount of 1/2 and 1/2 on hand.

What a great recipe. I ate two bowls back to back. The bacon is a great addition and I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half as I like my chowder nice and thick. Awesome!

This certainly is a splurge on calories and fat even using fat-free half and half, but WOW is it good.  The consistency, in particular, is absolutely perfect...thick and creamy exactly the way clam chowder should be.  I have access to fresh clams, but I honestly don't think that preparation is worth the effort when you get something this good from  canned clams.  One thing I will mention is that it did take some time for the cream to thicken, so I would start that sooner the next time.  I got my veggies cooking and then started the roux, and the veggies were done before the cream thickened.  I could see adding a bacon garnish, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Pioneergirl for sharing your recipe.  This one's going into my favorites!

WOW!!! I love this recipe of clam chowder. Though I didn't read the step about keeping the clam juice and I tossed it, but surprisingly enough, this came out REALLY yummy. I think if I added the clam juice, it would be a little too fishy for my taste and my husband HATES seafood. he did enjoy this soup!! I would make it again and again!

This was delicious. My husband and I are clam chowder coneseurs and we thought this was pretty good. We only get clam chowder when we go on vacation in Long Beach Island NJ, where they have a huge chowder fest, and they only have the best of the best clam chowder. This was the first clam chowder recipe i ever tried, and it was a lot easier than i thought. I never tried it before because i didnt think it would be good enough for our likings but decided to try for lent. I did not do the bacon thing that others did, only because it was lent and i  really dont like bacon. I followed the recipe except i didnt use any water just the clam juice and i used half half and half and half whole milk.  It was very thick and creamy and delicious.   Another thing is to use the chopped clams not minced. Delicious eaten out of a bread bowl.

Very rich but we love this.  It has become a Christmas Eve staple in our house.  I did take the suggestion of some of the reviewers and saute the veggies with 2 slices of chopped bacon. I also added extra milk as it was really thick when I used 3/4 cup flour.

Excellent springboard! Changes I made: minced 4 slices of bacon and then added onions, celery and carrot. After transparent added clam juice and potato cubes and water to cover. The rest I did the same. Bacon adds a most excellent background flavor that marries with the clams perfectly.

This is almost an exact copy of the Ivar's Clam Chowder recipe that circulates around Seattle (home of Ivar's Seafood restaurants), but that doesn't mean it's not freakin' awesome!  I love going home to Seattle for a bowl of Ivar's clam chowder, and this recipe is very close to the creamy, thick, tasty goodness you can get at Ivar's.  This is a clam chowder recipe that will convert clam chowder haters (including picky kids) into fans because it is mostly creamy and not very clammy/fishy.  I agree with other reviewers, adding bacon definitely helps.

Two thumbs up to Pioneergirl!!! I've been making clam chowder for years. It was always good, the red whine vinegar is the secret to make it great. Added bacon for my meatlover family. Thank you for sharing.

This soup is great.   I did however, use "Old Bay" to season it and skipped the red wine vinegar.  I also added extra potatoes so I could mash some and make it thicker.  Also, I drained a can of corn and added it.  Thank you Sharon for sharing!

I have been making this for years and it is soooo good. Sometimes I do cheat and use skim milk/less butter and use more veggies to begin with (wich I add some chicken stock/clam juice), then put about half in a blender and add it back to chowder before finishing. It makes it thicker with out the fat. Not quite as good but close enough to eat on a regular basis for lunch.  Don't be scared of the vinegar it's yummy - if you are cooking for a crowd don't add it and leave the bottle out so everyone can add their own.  Thank you 8 - )

Amazing chowder! However, I changed a few things to make it super good! I used 3 cans of chopped clams and then 2 cans of minced clams (becuase I like a much more "seafood" taste to my chowder), which was barely enough juice to cover the vegetables. I ommitted the carrots, since I do not care for them or feel they belong in clam chowder. I also used 1/2 quart of half-and-half and 1/2 quart of milk so the soup wouldn't be too rich, but just right! I only used 1 tablespoon of the vinegar, since I was a bit leary of it, but next time will definitely try 2 tablespoons, the vinegar was great! I also added parsley to give it a little added flavor, and there was no soup left! Excellent recipe!

I'm a little bit surprised at the reviews on this recipe.  Consistency was good if you like nice and thick chowder, but the taste was a tad bit lacking.  If you have never made chowder before, then I suppose this would be a good recipe.  On the other hand, if your a chowder buff, you may be a bit disappointed.  I didn't add the bacon as others suggested, may be I should have.  Be sure to cook the flour mixture a bit, otherwise you will have a flour taste.  And go easy on the red wine vinegar.  I could taste it once I was done.  I did add more clams and used a combo of chopped and minced.  I like larger clams (not too big) and was glad that I did this.  Not a bad recipe, but certainly not 5 stars in my book.  Sorry I couldn't rate this better, just being honest.

The best clam chowder I've ever had!  I followed others advice and used 3 cans chopped/2 cans minced clams.  The juice from those gave me plenty of liquid to cover the veggies.  I also added some bacon and I used only 1 TBSP of vinegar.  My only suggestion in cooking the veggies, would be to let the carrots/celery go for a little while before adding the potatoes/onions.  They seem to take longer and I didn't want the potatoes to be mush so the carrots were a little crunchy still.  I will make this recipe all the time!  Thanks!

This was a wonderful recipe! I made it for a dinner party and my guests raved. I saved a lot of time by mincing my clams in my food processor. I made it in the morning and added the clams in the evening just before serving. I forgot to add the red wine vinager and it was still great. Thank you!

I made clam chowder for the first time ever yesterday using Sharon's recipe.  I can descirbe it in one word...PERFECT!   Thick, chunky and just the right flavor.  No more spending $3.95 for a small bowl of watery chowder at the local restaurant.  The taste and texture was much more than I hoped for.  Thanks Sharon!

This was the second best clam chowder I've ever had. It was amazing! I did make a few changes... I also cooked several strips of bacon, then sautéed the veggies in the bacon fat. I used all chopped clams instead of minced, and substituted all clam juice for the water. I switched out the black pepper for white, and added a teaspoon each of both Old Bay seasoning and onion powder. Perfect!

This is by far the best clam chowder I have ever made and I've tried a lot. It's ,in my opinion, an award winning recipe. I made bread bowls to put it in and my family loved it! I did add a little extra garlic and a touch of chicken broth to thin it a bit. I also used real bacon bits that were precooked.

This is TRUE New England Clam Chowder!  No  matter what changes or additions or modifications other reviewers said they made, DON'T.  They didn't end up with real clam chowder, where the clams reign supreme.  This recipe is spot-on;  it's creamy, rich and full of that delicious clam goodness that needs only a chunk of crusty bread and a nice chardonnay to be a meal fit for the in-laws from Massachusetts.

By far the best clam chowder recipe I have followed.  I read people's feedback and reduced the amount of flour to 1/2 cup; I used a half of cup of milk and a pint of heavy whipping cream; I used bacon (who doesn't love bacon).. I also used 5 cans of clams - 3 minced; 2 chopped; and then sauteed the onions and garlic in the grease and followed the recipe above... being a seafood lover I added bay scallops and a can of lump crab meat; then crumbled the bacon in and added old bay seasoning and a few crushed red peppers... I love it!!  It's rich, creamy and delicious

This was a great base recipe but I too fried up half a pound of bacon and used SOME of the bacon grease to saute the veggies. I also added about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning, a teaspoon of thyme as well as a little beef bullion. Much more flavor after adding the extra ingredients.

This is a very good clam chowder recipe!  It was my first time making the chowder and I used the other reviewer's tips of incorporating bacon into the chowder.  I cooked the bacon first and then tossed the veggies, water, and clam water into the bacon grease, yum! I did notice that I cut the potatoes too small so when they were fully cooked, the celery and carrots were still a little crunchy. Be mindful of the chunk size of the potatoes is my advice, but I am a novice cooker so you guys must already know it!  Also, I used 1 pint of half and half and 1 pint of non fat milk to make the two quarts, I did not want it to be too heavy.  It turned out great! I had two bowls of this soup and it is serious comfort food.  I'm making this soup for my boyfriend when he comes back from Afghanistan.

Good.  I halved the recipe, because as is, it makes too much for just two people.  I like leftovers for chicken noodle and tomato basil, but prefer none in this.

I left out the onion and carrots because they just aren't necessary to me.


I made some bacon beforehand to crumble into the soup.  Popped it into the over at 400 degrees for 13 minutes.  Pulled it out right before it turned crispy and reserved the bacon fat.  


I simmered the potato in the juice from the canned clams, bacon fat, and also another bottle of clam juice. 

Then I crumbled the bacon into the potatoes at 10 minutes and also add the celery at this time.  IF you put the celery sooner, it just becomes mush.  The potatoes should be on for at least 20 minutes, however, to get that melt-in-your-mouth texture.


The only other changes I made was I cut the red wine vinegar by half (can always add more if necessary) and cut the butter/half half/all purp by a third, as I like my soup not incredibly thick. 


I love it the way I have it!  Delicious with sourdough bread.

Wow, this clam chowder is the best! It's rich, hearty and packed with flavor. The celery, carrots and onions that are simmered in the clam juice adds to the flavor of the vegetables.

This isnt a thin chowder by any means, it is thick, rich and flavorful. There's no need to adjustment this recipe..If you don't care for some of the ingredients, don't spoil it by altering the flavor because it's simply perfect as is.

It takes less than a half hour to make, but tastes like it simmered for hours. If you like a hearty and flavorful clam chowder, try this recipe, you wont be disappointed.

Thank you for this outstanding recipe PIONEERGIRL.

I thought the soup was excellent.  Was a bit leary about adding the wine vinegar but did anyway and was surprised how well it tasted.  The only thing I did different was I followed a few others and cooked up some bacon and sauteed the veggies and added bacon to the soup.  I do not like a thin clam chowder and was pleased with the consistency of this recipe.

Very nice recipe :). I used clam juice (from the cans) + 2 extra bottles instead of using water, and instead of putting carrots I just added a bit more potato and celery. I also sauteed my veggies in the bacon fat (and cut down the amount of butter). At first I was very skeptical of the red wine vinegar so did not put it into my pot of soup...Instead I put in a few drops into my own bowl. I was quite surprised how well it worked and will definitely add it straight into the soup next time :). 

Lastly for those who are saying that the clam chowder tastes like flour: You need to cook the raw flour taste of our your roux before adding in the 1/2 & 1/2.

This was a good base recipe but as is, we thought it was bland and very, very thick.  Almost like stew.  I added more milk and water to thin it down but it was still thick.  Will make again and reduce the amount of flour called for.  After mixing everything together and tasting I added 1 tsp Bay seasoning, 1/2-1 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp onion powder.  I sprinkled some crumbled bacon on top to serve.  With these changes my family lapped this up.  Served with soft bread and a side salad.  The rating is based on recipe as written.

One great chowder recipe! Turned it into more of a seafood chowder though, but used this recipe as a base.  Like many previous suggestions used 6 strips of bacon then browned the veggies in the bacon fat. Then followed the rest of the recipe as directed.  After all was ready to serve, added 2 drained cans of crab meat, 1/2 pound of small shrimp, and 1/2 pound of prawns.  Really could have added any seafood.  Did use the red wine vinegar suggestion, and it did add nice flavor.  Will use this recipe over and over.

I used this recipe as a base for developing a kosher "clam" chowder. I know, the purists will probably hate this but a number of chowders originally were made with fish instead of clams.

Way too bland.  I made the mistake of not checking the reviews before I made it.  Way too much tweaking needed to make it edible.  The recipe needs to be re-written with the changes included.

This is...amazing. OMG! Of course, I just had to add the bacon, and use the grease (and butter) for the roux. I didn't use the exact measurements, and ended up adding a few chicken bullion to add those layers of taste I just couldn't get otherwise. Thick, rich and fabulous!!!

Fantastic, and so easy!  I added some chopped up broiled bacon to the soup when I added the cream/roux.  Husband loved it.  I couldn't find clams so I bought a jar of pickled cockles, which I wasn't sure would work but it turned out I didn't have any vinegar in the house so it worked out fine.

For a first timer making this recipe I found it wasy to follow but very time consuming to prep. I made it for my husband. I do not eat seafood. I am sure my husband will devour this and ask me to make it on a regular basis. Once I don't have to follow a recipe it will become easier to make.

Wow!  Easy, and delicious!  Was done and ready in about 30 minutes!  I love that this recipe doesn't use canned soup as a base.  I did alter by using regular 2% milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 (because that is what we use) and a bit of garlic powder, and it was still creamy and thick.  Will make this a part of our regular family menu.  THANK YOU for sharing!

It was good, although I made a few changes. I ended up putting 30 oz of clams. The 20 oz just didn't seem like enough.  I only used 1/3 C of flower...and it was still too much.  3/4 C seems like a nightmare.  Also, diced and rendered some bacon, and used some of the drippings for my roux...and used bacon bits for garnish, along with some green onion.

So delicious! So simple. I used red potatoes, and added a leek. I also used 3 strips of bacon as per suggested and softened the veggies in the bacon grease before adding the clam juice from the cans. I used 4 cans of clams, 2 minced and 2 chopped, because we like the clam flavor. I used flour instead of cornstarch and added milk since it thickened up quite a bit. Old Bay Seasoning and the red vinegar really made it sing. So good and so filling! Served with an artisan crusty bread and the whole family gobbled it up.

I microwave the veggies in a bowl with a little bit of water in the bottom for 2 min. each bowlful.  Dump everything in the crockpot on high.  Cleanup was easy.  I had to wash my chopping knife, a spoon, and a bowl.....eyeballed the measuring parts.  Done in 1 hour, while I'm watching the football game. Voila!

Great recipe!  I made a few MINOR changes...I added some bacon grease with the bacon to the butter and flour mixture as others have recommended (great idea) as well as some minced garlic.  I ended up not adding the vinegar because I was already satisfied with the taste and was afraid to mess it up, although I'm sure it wouldn't.  My husband and I made this with some homemade bread bowls - so good!  We'll be making this recipe again for sure.

mmmm...good!  the bacon sounds like a delicious addition, however an unhealthier one :(  It is great as is.  I made this twice and the second time I added 2 dashes of Old Bay Seasoning-- awesome!  That was the "something" it needed.  Thanks for sharing your recipe- we all love it!!!

Fantastic recipe.  I plan to make this again and again. A couple things I would do differently:  a) mince and fry some bacon and add to the celery/carrots and add onions.   b) Instead of using half and half (to avoid some serious fat) use 2 cups 2% milk and the other 2 cups half and half (fat free).

first soup I ever made and it was scrumptous. Thanks for the recipe. One variation, I used stock of chicken that i previously boiled and stored in the freezer about 1 cup. Everything else I did the same. Used white dried pepper and just a touch of garlic.

*5 stars the way I make it* I add extra potatoes because I like it chunkier, and although I like thick soups, half and half makes it WAY to thick, like sludge. Making it with regular milk thickens up perfectly with the flour. I use white pepper instead of black and I add some onion powder. I also reduce the amount of red wine vinegar. I have made it the other way, it was too thick, didn't have enough stuff in it, almost just pure sauce, and the red wine vinegar was over powering. The changes I make make sure it's gobbled up at my house.

Very good soup. Next time I think I'll add some bottled clam juice for a little more flavor. I told the kids it was potato soup and they gobbled it up.

Really good. Left out the carrot (thought it was weird).  Also, started off the soup by browning some bacon.  Added fresh parsley at the finish. Yum!

This turned out really well. I cooked in big crockpot so I doubled the recipe and it filled it to the brim. The one thing you shold do if cooking in crock pot is step number two. Do that first and then throw everything into the crockpot and let it cook on low for 6 to 8 hours. For step 2 I melted the butter and combined all the wet ingredients and then added the flour. It left little clumps of flour throughout. In the end it still tasted great but didn't turn out too pretty.

The only thing I changed on this recipe was to add Old Bay Seasoning instead of salt and pepper. I liked the suggestions of bacon and will try that next time.I have made this numerous times and it is a good recipe as is if you don't want to change anything.

Superb soup - just a bit too rich if serving as a main dish (which is uncommon I know).  Would make a great starter soup as it is in the recipe.  Next time if I make this as a main course, I will be cutting the butter in half.

This was my first time making clam chowder, and as many have before, I loved this recipe!  Although I personally wanted to try the bacon version that was recommended by others, I was making this for someone who doesn't eat pork and is trying to lose weight, therefore I altered the recipe slightly, following the advice of another reviewer:  sweated off the onion in a little olive oil before adding the other veggies, used all clam juice instead of water, reduced butter and flour to 1/2 cup each, and used fat-free half and half.  It was delicious and just the right thickness for our taste.  Great recipe!

This soup was great - I did add an extra can of clams and also a bag of frozen corn.  And used 2% milk instead of cream to cut calories and fat - it was DELICIOUS!!!

AWESOME! Super easy and really tasty. The only change I made to the original recipe was using a bottle of clam juice to cover the veggies. The vinegar does make the soup! DELISH!

Yum.....This chowder is sooooooooo good.  I did make a couple of alterations, using a technique from another recipe on this website.  After 1st chopping and preparing the vegetables, use a 4 qt pan or dutch oven and cook 6 strips of bacon until brown and crisp.  Remove the bacon and drain on paper towels.  Add the vegetables to the bacon fat in the pan and saute for 5 minutes.  Then add the clam juice drained from the cans and enough water or additional clam juice to just cover the vegetables and cook until tender.  I always buy an extra bottle of clam juice so I can use all clam juice and no water for cooking the vegetables in as I think it gives it more clam flavor.  For the white sauce I reduced the butter and flour to 1/2 cup and thought it was just right.  At the end, add the minced clams and crumble the bacon in as well.

My family loved this! I did add the bacon, but I also added just a little bit of cream cheese as I thought it just needed a little something extra after tasting it the first time. I've never added cream cheese to soup before, but it turned out great! We will definitely be making this again!

Excellent chowder.  In addition to the cans of minced clams,  I throw in whatever seafood I have such as tiny scallops or tiny shrimp or some kind of white fish. I buy the bottle of clam juice since I put more ingredients in the pot.  I also put cut up cauliflower instead of the carrots. This makes the chowder nice and thick.  I like to add Old Bay seasoning for taste.  I have to tinker with the right combination of salt, pepper and Old Bay seasoning but once I hit the right mixture, this chowder is wonderful!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and was very disappointed with the outcome. Like other reviewers, my soup had no clam taste, if any, and I could only taste the flour and potatoes. I tried adding some seasonings to save it, but to no avail. Thanks for sharing but this was not my cup of tea.

I love this recipe, it got gobbled up within a day between my boyfriend and I. I read some of the other reviews and made the following changes:  * I used 32 OZ of whole clams - alot more than the recipe called for (3 large cans of clam). * Fried the veges for a few minutes in bacon fat * Poured in clam juice once the veges softened in the fat (did not need to add extra water because I used so many cans of clam juice). * Crumbled six pieces of bacon into the soup.   The red wine vinegar REALLY did make a difference, brought out the clam flavor!  What I'd do different next time: Use 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of butter (for less of a buttery taste to the soup).  Yummy! Can't wait to buy some fresh San Franciscan clams for this soup!!

I love this! I am from San Francisco and this is the closest recipe I have found. I have made a few changes for my personal liking, I use 5 cans of clams, clam juice instead of water, and leave out the carrots. Very Yummy.

very tasty. here's how i made it healthier: substituted 2% milk for the cream, used light butter and reduced the amount (i think 1 stick is enough to flavor), omitted the salt (there's already enough in the clam juice), and substituted cornstarch for flour (used slightly less than 1/2 the recommended amount). i did sprinkle dried parsley on top, but i was really surprised how much flavor this had for having so few spices. reminds me of home in massachusetts!

Wow! this is "My Best Clam Chowder!" I took a hint from the other reviews, although I kind of winged it from the beginning.  I had a pound of frozen clams in the shell and steamed them in 1/4 tablespoon of butter and 1 teaspoon of minced garlic.  After making sure they were coated,I added 1/4 cup of white wine, covered and steamed for 4 minutes till they opened.  I drained the juice and added the juice from one 10.5 ounce can of minced clams.  Thinking I didn't have enough clam broth, I added 1 1/2 cup of chicken broth to both the drained clam juice and buttery/garlic wine clam juice.  I then fried 3 strips of bacon, removed from pan then added the veggies with the clam broth.  Yes, I sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease, fattening but soooo tasty! (then added the clam broth as instructed)  After whisking the butter, flour and cream mixture, I added all the veggies and clam broth.  I crumbled the bacon and added both the minced and steamed clams, salt and pepper to taste then the red wine vinegar.  This was in one word, FANTASTIC!  It wasn't that hard nor expensive, this is a definite keeper!! Thanks!

Yum. I skipped the vinegar and sauteed the veggies in salt pork fat. I added a little milk to thin it out a little.  I made two batches and it was gone within 20 minutes.

This recipe is pretty basic, so it's easy to make it your own. I replaced some of the onions with shallots, and I used a half pound of fresh minced clams (instead of canned). Based on other reviews, I replaced the flour with corn starch. The vegetables definitely take longer to cook than it would take you to make the roux, so I would recommend waiting until the potatoes are just getting soft before you start adding flour/corn starch to the melted butter. Also, cooking the veggies in clam juice is definitely the way to go-- it adds the perfect amount of clam flavor.

Things I added: a can of corn, 2 tsp. of fresh, finely chopped sage, a half pound of fresh diver scallops (added to the vegetable mixture when it was almost ready), Old Bay seasoning, Zatarain's Creole Seasoning (just for a little kick), and 1/3 cup of chopped parsley. Excellent!

And one more thing-- I would advise others to add the clams at the last minute, preferably just as you start seasoning to taste. They do get tough.

This was a good starter recipe, but after reading many reviews, I made some modifications as well.  First, like so many others, I browned some bacon, removed the bacon and sauteed the veggies in the grease before adding the water and clam juice.  I also added as many suggested, extra clam juice instead in place of some of the water to increase the flavor.  Seasoned with Old Bay and salt, as well as returning the crumbled bacon to the mix. I used some chopped clams as well as minced to get some larger pieces for texture. Also used cornstarch to thicken instead of flour.  I tripled this recipe for a party and it made a LOT - thankfully I can freeze the leftovers.  Took another reader's suggestion to serve with Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this site, they went well together.  Note this does make a thick chowder, so if you don't like it that way, this isn't the recipe for you.  I will be making this again. Thanks, Sharon.

This was okay. The recipe says to cook the veggies in the clam juice and meanwhile make the cream sauce. The way the recipe was written it makes it sound like the veggies should cook in the amount of time it take to make the cream sauce but they don't; it takes quite a bit longer for the veggies to get soft (I would say about 10-15 mins). Also, I think next time I make it I will use shallots rather than onions because they give cream soups a really nice richness or I will use the onions and add some garlic. Overall, a nice clam chowder recipe, I just need to make some small adjustments the next time I make it.

I think this recipe is a great recipe to tweak and edit to your personal tastes.  I started off by frying up four pieces of bacon until crispy, which I then put aside and later crumpled up into the finished soup.  I then added the onion, along with a few cloves of garlic to the fat and fried them up.  Once they were cooked a bit I added the celery along with a bit of old bay seasoning.  Then I added the potatoes, and covered with the clam juice.  I didn't need to add water because I used 5 cans of clams instead of the 3 called for in the recipe.  

I also cut back the amount of butter and flour in the rue to 1/2 cup, and after combining the vegetable mixture with the cream mixture, I added a can of corn, drained, to replace the carrots.  I also seasoned with a bit of parsley.

I almost skipped the red wine vinegar, but I'm glad I didn't.  It's such a small thing, but it makes this whole soup pop!

This was very good. I sauted my veggies before adding clam juice and bit of water to cover. I used white peeled boiling potatoes, no vinegar,non-fat half and half, 2 sm.cans diced clams and one can of whole clams and would have liked more clams. I served it in my homemade semolina italian bread bowls..we also enjoyed it topped with crisped bacon and some hot sauce...my husband said it was really good.

I am a huge fan of New England clam chowder and this one set the bar even higher for me.  The secret ingredient really is the red wine vinegar.  Before it was added the soup tasted okay for clam chowder but afterward it was completely tranformed!  I can't wait to make this one again!

I thought it was very good, although for some reason the celery was still crunchy while the potatoes and carrots were almost too done -wasn't the size of celery or anything like that. Next time I will boil celery in some water for a few minutes before mixing with other ingredients to give it a chance to "catch up" to the other vegetables.

This is one of those recipes you just want to savor instead of gobbling it all up in a rush to get out the door.  This is the first clam chowder I've tried to make because I never thought I could do better than the restaurants do.  This recipe far surpasses ANY clam chowder I've ever had in any restaurant!  I used one extra can of clams and mixed 3/4 quart of half and half with 1/4 quart skim milk.  I like a lot of clams, but other than that, I would not change a thing!  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Wow - this was the best clam chowder my husband and I have ever had - we no longer have to drive to Newport to have clam chowder at The Chowder Bow. I used 5 cans of clams and added a little white wine (omitted the red wine vinegar). Fantastic!

I also cut down in the half & half, and added milk instead. Used clam juice instead of water and added: bacon, shrimp, scallops. It was very good and not too thick. Very easy to make and not at all time consuming.

What a GREAT recipe! I made this for Valentine's day and my husband and 18mth old son could not get enough! I used one can minced clams and one chopped to give a little more texture. Also I've read people mentioning a flour taste. I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and used 1/4c cornstarch instead of the flour. I always find that cornstarch dissolves better in a cream mixture and does not give the flour taste. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I've had a lot of clam chowder in my life, and I have to say that this recipe is one of the best!  It's fairly easy to make and the results are great.  It doesn't have an overwhelming clam taste, so it's good for people who think most clam chowder is a little too clammy.

Simply incredible.  My girlfriend(who is a clam chowder snob) loved it.  She thought it took me hours, which it didn’t(browning points for Joe!).  Actually the first time I made it I was in a hurry and it only took around 40min.  As other reviews have suggested, 5+ cans of clams is a must.  Enjoy it, and trust me, you will.

This soup was good.  I followed the previous suggestions and added bacon.  I thought it could use more seasoning maybe celery salt or all seasoning salt.  Also, I one and one halved the recipe to feed my family of 10, but only used three cans of clams, I should of added two more cans to give it a stronger clam flavor.

This was SO GOOD.  I told my husband I could eat it every day (he thinks I'm crazy, but I could!).  I took a suggestion from an earlier review and sauteed veggies in bacon drippings before simmering.  I'll be sharing this recipe with family & friends. Thanks Sharon!

This is a really good chowder!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  I omitted the carrots, but added some thyme & 4 pieces of bacon.  It got really thick, so I thinned it down with a bit of milk.  Thanks again!

Fantastic! My first chowder and I came off looking like a pro. I use the larger pieces of clam in lieu of the minced pieces. Also, I throw in some fresh cooked bacon bits and a little bit of bacon grease for added flavor. Make a day ahead of time, flavors are even better after a day in the fridge. Thanks Sharon.

WOW - is this good!  I used extra clams, just because we like it that way, and substituted balsamic vinegar (I was out of red wine vinegar).  Also, I used 2 bottles of clam juice to simmer the veggies, instead of water. Overall, it was delicious !  Great with french bread & a salad.  Also, you can freeze it before adding the clams.  I defrosts beautifully, reheat and add the clams.  The clams will get tough if cooked too long.

Delicious! My husband is from Vermont, and said it was the best he has had in a long time. I added about 1/2 cup of corn, a dash of garlic powder, a dash of onion powder and a little bit of milk (because it was starting to thicken up too much). It doesn't need bacon like some reviews were suggesting. However, I did garnish with some freshly shredded Parmesan cheese I had on hand.

For being my first  attempt at making this meal and after browsing the many available recipes, I was drawn to the simplicity of this recipe. Turned out to be a delicious And easy soup to make, but I did fill a bowl in  sourdough bread.  I would totally Share this recipe with my family.

A big hit tonight!!!  We did alter it some.  For the chopped potatoes we used a 2 lb bag of southern style frozen potatoes.  We used 2 cans of minced and one can of chopped clams.  We omitted the carrots, and used garlic instead of onions.  We didn't add water and in fact we used a jar of clam juice and a beer.  We didn't have enough half & half so we used milk and thickened it with some corn starch.  Oh, and we also did like the others and used the bacon grease for the celery and garlic and that added great flavor.  So it seems like we altered this recipe a lot.  We sort of did, but we couldn't have made it without the basic recipe, which is similar to a recipe my husband and I used to make 20 years ago, but lost somehow!  Oh, and we served it bread bowls! Thanks!

I didn't make it but you can't make chowder without bacon or panchetta being rendered first.  :(

This is a good and easy recipe, it do start with bacon and sauté vegetables in bacon fat. I also add a can of creamed corn. Instead of clam I add a package of crawfish. Maybe its a Louisiana thing.

CLAMAZING! Super easy and totally delicious! I tweaked it a bit for calorie sake - used a pint of half and half instead of a quart and used half butter and half margarine. I upped the ante and made sourdough bread bowls and blew my husbands mind! Perfect accompaniment to a cold Chicago Winter night. This is getting added to the regular rotation. Yum - YUm - YUM!

Have made this four times both with half and half and with milk.  Great both ways.  I always add the bacon as suggested and I put a little more flour in my roux.  My husband and I prefer a thick chowder.  Thank you great recipe!

This was by far the best clam chowder I've ever made.  I also browned some bacon, but added the drippings to the melted butter/flour later on.  And instead of using water to cover the vegetables, I added a couple of bottles of clam juice (in addition to the juice from the canned clams).  I added the crumbled bacon at the end, with the clams.  Even the one child in my house who claimed not to like clam chowder, ate this up and asked for more.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe! Only note I have is use sea salt vs regular or kosher salt. It gives it a very appropriate flavor.

Great recipe!  I added bacon like the other suggested and used minced and whole baby clams in my batch.  I also used all the clam juice and found that the red wine vinegar really did make it better.  I'll definitely be making this one again, thanks for the recipe!

This is a great clam chowder recipe.  I had misgivings about the red wine vinegar, but like other reviewers, I found it to be an incredible addition.  It added complexity without an actual vinegar taste.  I have made clam chowder my whole life, but from now on, it will always include the vinegar.  I made the recipe basically as written, with the exception of replacing the cream with canned milk. I love real cream, but canned milk avoids some fat calories without a significant loss of flavor.

Excellent chowder.  We simply love Clam Chowder, and like it thick.
First, I want to point out that, contrary to many reviews here, the recipe DOES call for you to use the clam juice.  I did that, and also added some seafood stock, instead of water, to cover the veggies.  Also added a tsp of Old Bay, used 1 c half and half (all I had) and the rest whole milk.  It was still plenty thick enough.

Yum yum, thank you - this is going to become a staple for me.

This recipe was excellent!  To make it a little richer, I sauteed a 1/2 pound of diced bacon, added it to the simmering vegetables and clam stock/water, then deglazed the bacon pan with a little white wine and added it as well.  I then added a little dried thyme, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of red wine vinegar and let the soup simmer on very low heat for another 1/2 hour.  It really made this rich and hearty - my husband loved it. :)

Made changes: added bacon crumbles at end, sautéed veggies in the bacon fat, and subbed clam juice for water and white pepper for black, all per other reviews. Second time: Didn't do bacon or pre-cook veggies; should have.  Added sherry, yum.  Also used corn starch slurry to thicken instead of flour.  A few tablespoons of cornstarch.

My husband and I made this the other day and we have to say it is the BEST clam chowder either one of us has ever had - My husband is very picky too - 
We used the slow cooker to make ours - Just let the veggies simmer in the clam juice all day - And I have to say that using only 1/2 cup butter and using the 1/4 cup bacon grease was probably the BEST idea ever - My husband is always looking for the bacon flavor - 
Its only been a week and my husband thinks we need to make it again -

definitely a favorite.  I followed the advice with other about adding the bacon, but it wasn't until I added the vinegar that the chowder came alive.  Even my husband loved it and he's a picky eater!

This is a great recipe. I have made it for the last few xmas eves. I do prefer to fry up some bacon, then save some of the fat to fry the onions in. It adds some flavour. I crumble the bacon to sprinkle on top of the chowder if desired when served. I know this is high in fat, but I only do it once a year and it has become a family favorite. Never leave out the red wine vinegar. It MAKES the chowder!

I made this for my parents while they were visiting me in college.  My father is Byzantine Catholic and doesn't eat meat on Fridays, ever, so I was unable to do anything involving bacon.  However, it was pretty darn delicious otherwise, and I plan to make it again.  I used baby clams, but would like to try to use chopped larger clams next time.  We all really liked it.  I think next time I'm going to try to thicken it up just a little bit more... I used fat-free half-and-half, which can sometimes not thicken as well as regular.

This was by far, one of my favorite dishes! Do try it for yourself. Everyone ask for it when were having a GO BEARS party... Don't be afraid of putting in, an extra can or two of clams, a bit of garlic, and a squirt of Worcestershire sauce, you will be glad you did. I'll bet you will be making more and more of this wonderful stuff.....

Wow! SOOO good! I did add more clams than it calls for and I really thought I had celery but didn't so I substituted for a few diced asaragus spears. I know sounds weird but it actually tasted really good. Everyone in the house loved it - even the one who said she was not normally a new england clam chowder fan.
Plus I used Gluten Free flour as we're GF here and that so I only needed 1/2 the flour called for.

I loved this, it's easy and yummy.  I skipped the vinegar, and split the amount of half and half with whole milk. I have made it several times, and tried skipping the carrots in one batch, and also just used whole milk instead of any half and half. Was just as yummy with less fat and calories.

Delicious.  I have never made clam chowder before, but am a veteran of bone based soup stock.  I boiled a ham bone for 1 hr, let stock cool and then made this soup.  As a result I was able to reduce the half and half cream by 50% as well as the amount of butter by 25%.  To serve I topped with a tablesppon of crispy bacon bits.  Absolutely delicious and very filling!  Yum!

I don't know what possessed me to make clam chowder on a muggy, 85-degree day ... but I am so glad I did! I read a bunch of reviews, promptly forgot them, and ended up following the recipe exactly -- except I totally forgot the vinegar. Anyway, the result was amazing! My three picky kids devoured this. I will definitely make it again!

SO VERY GOOD !!I modified it just a tad...fried about 8 slices of bacon and used the grease to saute the onions, celery and about 8 oz of sliced mushrooms. Then combined sauteed vegetables along with cubed potatoes and diced carrots  and covered it with the juice of (4) 6.5 oz cans of chopped clams and followed the recipe as written from that point on. Crumbled the bacon and used it as a garnishment over individual bowls of chowder at serving time.

I needed meatless and low-fat. I cut the recipe in half. I used 1/2 cup fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 1/2 cups 1% milk. I only used 1/4 cup lt. butter and 1/4 cup flour. I used 2 cans chopped clams (instead of a can and a 1/2). I used some garlic powder while simmering the veggies. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was really good and quick and I used ingredients I had on hand.

This soup is delicious. So very thick and creamy. I put only a splash of vinegar in at the end and I used a 50/50 white and wheat flour. It gave it a brown textured look, but was still so so good. After it was all cooked, I ran it through the blender and that made nice and chunky, but smooth. Try it... you won't be sorry.

My family really liked this chowder.  I followed the recipe as written except for the vinegar.  I also cooked some bacon the add to the bowls and added some of the grease to the onions and celery when I cooked them.

This recipe is better than anything at a restaurant. I add an extra can of clams, but that's my personal preference. Also, I don't have any half and half the I'll use about a pint of heavy cream and make up the rest with milk.

I lost my recipe for the clam chowder I used to make.  I found this one and it is fabulous!  My son who is a very finicky eater said it was "delicious".  coming from him, that's quite a compliment!   The best thing about is is once you buy the basics,, celery, carrots, potatoes, all you have to pick up is the clams.  The only thing I added was a bottle of clam broth rather than using water to cover the veggies.  Give it a try!

This is by far the best recipe for clam chowder that I have ever used.  I would not change a thing.  This is the second year in a row that I have served it as a first course at our Christmas dinner.  Thank you!

Very Good!! Tried it just as you read it in the recipe above. Would have liked to add bacon, but had some vegetarians at the table. Still thought it was great!! Even a self described expert at Clam Chowder gave it a big thumbs up.

This came out perfect, it is a great cold weather dinner with a loaf of bread and a salad.  Don't overcook the clams as they will get tough.  A keeper of a recipe.  Thanks!

Awesome base to start with! I made a few substitutions. I used chicken broth instead of water to cover veggies and left the carrot out. When I make it again I will probably use addition clam juice instead. It was on the bland side so I added a packet of leek soup mix. This gave it such an incredible flavor! Thanks for sharing!

I am eating and reviewing at the same time. This recipe is AMAZING!! I usually prefer to try a recipe as written, but there were a few modifications that I knew would suit my family's taste. 
- Cook 6 strips of bacon, remove bacon, saute veggies in bacon grease until soft and then add the clam juice (I add a couple cloves of garlic minced to the veggies)
- After adding clam juice, add fresh or dried thyme and extra chicken broth if necessary
- Crumble bacon into soup with clams
I chose to omit the red wine vinegar this time. AMAZING!!! I will make this one again

Absolutely delicious.  I cut down on the fat by replacing the half-and-half wtih fat-free evaporated milk, and it still tasted rich and creamy.  The vinegar at the end (plus a dash or two of Old Bay) really sealed the deal!

We made this and added a little bit of bacon like the other reviewers.  It was very good!  It was our fist time making clam chowder as well...I'm not giving it 5 stars because I guess that I think it was just a little too rich.  I will make it again on a cold winter day... probably.

Just tried it and loved it! Shared it with family and neighbors here in New England and they loved it too. Modifications...used baked blue fish left overs from night before as clam substitution. This gave it a great soft meaty texture and seafood taste minimizing the potential for tough clams. (What else can you do with left over baked fresh caught blue fish your fisherman brings home proudly?) Used 1 can rinsed Great Northern White beans instead of potatoes to keep the carbs count slightly lower. Absolutely delicious...A definite keeper!!!

Wonderful!  I love soup, especially clam chowder.  So I was really excited to taste this.  It turned out great!  Instead of using carrots, I cut up some bacon bits and throw them in.  This is a keeper!

I made this last night for dinner, it was my first attempt at clam chowder. First off, I left out the carrots/celery per our taste. I cooked the onion in bacon fat, which definitely gave flavor. I wish I would've had bacon (not just fat) to put in the soup, it would've been delicious. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic. After reading reviews, I only used 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup butter for roux, and it was perfect consistency. Overall, this was pretty good, I will add more clams next time!!

I had to register just to comment on this recipe.  I've had tons of clam chowder in my life.  This recipe is by far the absolute BEST I have ever had.  Thank you for posting this.  I found this 4 days ago and I will be making it for the 2nd time tonight.

Best clam chowder I've ever had, HUGE raves from the family, including my picky kids - and my first time making clam chowder! Definitely a keeper.  A very simple, easy recipe to make.  Don't forger to add the minced or chopped clams right before you serve the soup to keep them from getting tough.  Also, I used whole milk instead of half and half, we are slightly lactose intolerant and we didn't need the extra fat (who does?).  If you find that the consistency is thinner than you would like, add a slurry of 2T cornstarch to 2T milk, stir well and add to chowder.  Amazing!  (Next time I will add more clams and more potatoes.) Enjoy!!!

Really good. Thanks Pioneer Girl! I kept the same ingredients but did a few things different, all the same in the end I'm sure. I did add bacon though and cooked the onion, celery and a clove of garlic in the bacon drippings. Made a roux of that with the flour. Had I known before hand I would have added one more can of chopped clams to the 3 of minced. This is great hearty soup for sure! The potatoes thicken it up nicely. I feel a cold coming on and this was the perfect comfort food to get me through that! Thanks again!

This was very very good.  I took a few of the reviewers advice and cooked bacon prior then added the veggies to the pan with the fat.  I used half heavy whipping cream and half/half.  Outstanding with some bread bowls.  thank you so much for sharing.

I've made this recipe for years and my husband absolutely adores it.  The only thing I would recommend adding is a half of teaspoon of celery salt...otherwise this is the best clam chowder hands down!

Love this recipe.  It's definitly a once or twice a year recipe for us though.  I cut up one pound of bacon and pan fry half of it.  I add in the onion, double the carrots and celery and soften them up by frying them in the bacon fat.  Set that aside, and fry up the other half of the bacon (drain some of the fat) and add the potatoes.  After they brown a little bit, I add all the juice from a large 51 oz can of chopped clams (that is enough to cover).  I bring that to a boil, add the veggies back in and simmer.  I follow the rest of the instructions as written except I salt and pepper as I go, rather than at the end, I think it gives a fuller bodied flavor.
Sometimes I need to add some extra milk because it can be a little thick.  The red wine vinegar adds a 'clean' flavor to the soup.  I also add in about 1/2 cup of fresh cut parsley along with all the clams from a 51 oz can (they come in a two pack at Costco).  As others have stated, do this at the last possible moment so the clams don't get chewy!  
A+ recipe!!!

This was delicious!  I came across some fresh clam meat at our fish market, so I was inspiried. First, I sauteed the celery and onion in a little olive oil.  I somehow forgot the carrots, woops.  I (sadly)changed some of the ingredients as we are on a lower cholesterol diet:   used 3T butter, 1/3 cup flour, and a strange combination of skim milk, fat free half and half, and regular half and half.   It was very thick and creamy and I honestly wonder if I could make this soup in the future without the regular half and half and maintain the thickness and creaminess. My family loved it.  In fact, we debated how to make it a "fish chowder" next time.

This was the first time I've made clam chowder and although it was pretty good, the soup was strangely sweet. I couldn't figure out what was in there that had made it so sweet but figured out that the clams that I used were preserved in a sugar mixture. I don't know if they're all like that, but I'll definitely make this again, just with a different brand of clams.

This is my chowder recipe from now on.  It's important not to let the cream boil, but just to let it warm through when combining the ingredients.

I made this ahead of time for my parents' Valentine's Day dinner, but I couldn't refrain from eating some myself! I'm not a huge fan of seafood, but this chowder isn't very clammy (even though I used clam juice to cook the veggies). I'd suggest adding more clams for anyone else though. Also, I didn't use the red wine vinegar, but it tastes great. It's a wonderful chowder base that could be used for just about anything.

Awesome basic recipe. I followed the basic recipe with a combination of milk and 1/2 & 1/2. It still needs something but was not a disappointment. My family gobbled it up. I doubled the recipe and it will provide leftovers for the week.

This was great. I did make a few changes. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of Old Bay, used skim milk instead of half-and-half, and left the skins on the potatoes.

I was really looking forward to this chowder since it got such good reviews, but my husband and I were both disappointed. Perhaps I cooked the flour/cream mixture too long, but it made the chowder SO thick, as in way too thick. Also, it had a pasty taste to it. Maybe I should have used cornstarch instead of the flour.
I think that my experience was probably a fluke since others loved this so much.

Very good!  I recalculated the recipe to serve 4 instead of 8 and made a few modifications.  I decided to cut calories and fat by using fat free half and half and cutting back the butter and flour mixture by a few tablespoons.  It still came out extremely rich and thick, to the point where I added some skim milk at the end to thin it out.  Like others, I cooked up some bacon - turkey bacon in the pan before cooking the veggies and clam juice.  Like others, I also used all clam juice instead of water.  Next time I will use even less butter and flour and twice as much clams.

This chowder is rich and delicious!  Very hearty.  I did add two additional ingredients based on other reviews.  I cooked bacon and added the grease to the vegetables mixture saute (did not add crumbled bacon - kids ate it for breakfast).  I also added 2 tsp. thyme at the end since I thought it needed 'something else'.  Great recipe !

It was very very good, but not very "clammy"....My husband said its like Potato soup with clams.  I have always added bacon and a stick of cream cheese to my chowder, and did so this time as well.  I also added one jar of clam juice, and 3 cans of chopped clams, one with juice, 2 drained.  I probably should have used 2 clam juices and 4 cans of clams not drained to make it more clam chowder-y.  Overall, a very good soup, easy and tasty!

Love this chowder!!!  Don't add bacon.  That would completely alter the type of chowder this is.  I add one additional can of clams.  I also add about 1 tsp of red wine vinegar to my bowl of soup for a little tang.  This is one of my favorite recipes!

This was great! I did use fresh clams (about 1 lb shucked), and omitted the celery (hubby doesn't like) but used a few dashes of celery salt in it's place.

This is such an easy recipe and much quicker to make than expected. We went all out and added 6-9 strips of bacon, and sliced baby Portabella mushrooms. I used both chopped and minced clams to test, and decided I prefer the chopped. As is common on the west coast I served the chowder in bread bowls (Asiago bakery bread). I used just 1/2 and 1/2 but may try adding heavy cream in order to create a thickness without adding additional flour. The whole family LOVED it, and it's now on the twice monthly dinner menu!

The best clam chowder I have ever eaten in my life! The only changes I made was I added 5 cans of baby clams, and 1lb of scollops! Truely amazing! My family comes from back east *nova scotia*. So we all are big seafood eaters! :) Thank you for the great recipe!

Yummy!  This recipe was fantastic even before I added the clams & vinegar.  I am trying to lose weight so used fat free half-and-half, which didn't hurt this recipe at all.

I added a bottle of clam juice and also made bacon and sauted the onion and celery in the bacon grease.  When finished I put the crumbled bacon on top.  The consistency was perfect.  Something was definately missing.  It really needed some spicing up.  I will be making this again.

This has become a weekly recipe at our house. After trying another highly rated clam chowder, we enjoyed this one the best. We cook the veg a bit, add everything but the clams to the crock pot and cook on low for a few hours, we then add the clams during the last half hour or so. Perfect! Thanks for sharing!

I am never going to buy clam chowder in a can again.  This recipe was not only delicious but also easy to make.  I followed the advice that many of you have put out there about using the bacon fat.  The only deviated from the recipe slightly.  I used frozen clams instead of canned clams and I just bought the clam juice separately and poured that into the mix.  I still cannot believe how easy it is to make.

A good base, needed to be thicker, and there is something, an herb that's in the best clam chowders and I can't figure out what it is.  Its green, rosemaryish but not rosemary...anybody know what I'm talking about?

This soup was DELICIOUS!  Definitely (as other reviewers stated) a restaurant-quality soup.  To be honest, though, I didn't notice a difference when adding the red wine vinegar.  I bought oyster crackers and it was perfect :)  My husband was happy after work that day!  A definite keeper!

11/7/09-I used 1/3c butter, 1/2c flour, and fat free half & half and this was very rich and thick.  I think the fat free half & half gave it a sweeter taste than it would have had otherwise.  Next time I will definitely use part milk.  I put in 3 cans of chopped clams and also used extra clam juice instead of water as others recommended to cook the veggies.  I think this could easily accommodate 2 more cans of clams to give it more clam flavor.

I really hate to give a 5 star rating when I alter the recipe, but in this case I didn't alter it too much so I'm still giving it a 5 star. I did sautee my vegies in bacon grease (I know high fat, but I wanted the extra flavor). I also used 3-10oz cans of clams. This soup makes alot and those 3 small cans just don't seem to do the soup justice, it definately needed more clams. Lastly, I didn't put in any water I used all clam juice when I cooked it. You need it for the flavor. A definate remaker! Yummy!

Perfect. My family is constantly critiquing chowders at every seafood restaurant and they voted this as better than they've ever had. Just for a bit of flavor, I added a few pinches of thyme, old bay, white pepper, oregano, and basil and I omitted the vinegar (I served this chowder with lemon wedges). Thank you for a great recipe.

This is a good base recipe. I did modify it a bit to suit my personal preferences though. I diced and browned six slices of bacon before adding the veggies. I omitted the cup of carrots and added an extra cup of potatoes. Per the recommendations of some of the other reviewers, I used 5 cups of chopped clams, their juice, and an extra bottle of clam juice instead of the water. I used a mix of milk and half-and-half to cut down on the fat. I will use all low-fat milk and less flour next time--it was too thick or me.

Perfect recipe.  We go clam digging and use fresh clams, but still need to add clam juice from the bottle.  Even more than the recipe says.  (Simply because we are using fresh, and not canned clams that have been sitting in clam juice for an eternity.) Do the bacon thing and cook strips first, then sautee veggies in grease. (As others recommended)  My husband and his office loved it and asked for the recipe.

This wasn't all that bad, but it could have been better. I made the recipe as written, and here are the changes I'll make for next time. First off, I wouldn't put carrots in it. They didn't taste bad, but I've never had clam chowder with carrots in it. Second, use nothing but clam juice to cover the veggies. Don't use any water. Buy extra clam juice if you have to. This recipes didn't have enough clam flavor for me, and that would certainly help. Lastly, needs WAAAAAY more clams. Like I said, not enough clam flavor. Next time, I'll just 5 cans and see how I like it. Overall, a good base recipe to change to make it better. I just couldn't give it 5 stars with all the changes I need to make.

I do this as one member said: "Before doing anything, I browned six strips of bacon in the large skillet, removed them and let them drain. Then, I added the veggies to the bacon fat and proceeded as described (with clam juice, water, etc.) Crumbled the bacon into the soup after it was all combined." it is perfect with this combo!

I was looking for a clam chowder recipe that tasted like the restaurant. This just didn't do it for me. I followed the recipe exactly as written and I was not happy with the outcome. I didn't like the addition of red wine vinegar. I would leave it out next time.

The red wine vinegar makes this recipe!  I added double the amount of vinegar, a bottle of clam juice, and used chopped instead of minced clams.  I also added a large handful of fresh parsley, skipped the carrots, and replaced half and half with low fat milk.  

The milk will make the soup thinner, which is fine by me to make this soup less fatty.  When it cooks longer it does get thicker anyway.

This clam chowder was wonderful!  We have clam chowder every Christmas Eve, so I have tried several recipes.  This one has been the best, by far.  I did change it slightly.  I added another cup of potatoes, so needed more liquid to cook the vegetables.  I added a can of low sodium, fat free chicken broth, since I didn't have any clam broth on hand.  I like the generous amount of clams, and the vinegar gives it the extra spark of flavor.  Five stars!!!!!

This was simply scrumptious!  I doubled to 16 servings for a family Christmas dinner and it made a crockpot full plus another generous 4-6 servings.  I left out carrots, used bottled clam juice w/ juice from clams to cook veg instead of water.  I added approximately 3T cajun seasoning and 4t tabasco sauce to add some flavor and heat.  A keeper--thanks!

This was great! I scaled it down some, only used about 1/2 cup of flour and butter, and only used two cans of clams. I used about 2 cups of skim milk, and 2 cups of half & half. Used the juice from only one can of clams, because I don't like that "fishy" taste. Also skipped the celery since we don't care for it, and used about 1/8 tsp celery salt instead. It tasted really bland until I added the vinegar, which added so much flavor!! The vinegar is a MUST! The chowder turned out really thick and filling. I even ate a large bowl, and I'm not a fan of clam chowder. Thanks for sharing, this is the BEST chowder!!

Excellent recipe.  I've made this several times to rave reviews.  However, I substitute fat free half and half for the regular.  There's no difference in the taste and I can eat it without feeling guilty.

OMG...Awesome! I added bacon and used the drippings to sautee the vegies before boiling with clam juice. I also used 2 cans minced clams, and 2 cans chopped clams, and reserved the juice in place of water for boiling (I also added another bottle of clam juice). I didn't have enough hal&half, so I used 2 cups half&half, and 2 cups milk and mixed about 2 tbsp cornstarch w/ the flour. I served with tuna sandwiches. Other than those alterations I followed the recipe (sorry I always alter recipes) but YUM! Thank you!!!

This really is outstanding clam chowder! I too followed advice other reviewers had listed. I began with putting the half and half in a small sauce pan on medium-low to warm up. I cooked 6 slices of thick bacon. Reserved some of the bacon grease and sauteed the onion and celery. When it was nicely cooked, I added 2 diced (small dice) russet potatoes and covered the vegetables/potatoes with 1 bottle of clam juice as well as the juice from the 3 cans of clams. I let it cook on a slow boil for about 12 minutes until the potatoes were tender. In a large stock pot, melted the butter and slowly added the flour (I did use what was called for in the recipe). Added some chicken stock to the roux to give the flour some flavor. I had about 1 1/2 cups of stock leftover in the fridge, so I used it up. After whisking the roux for a couple of minutes, I slowly added the warmed half and half.  Whisking quite a bit so I didn't get clumps. I added 2 Tbs of Old Bay Seasoning, salt and pepper. Once all the half and half was in and the seasoning was the way I liked, I added in the potato mixture. I let it heat through, then put in the clams. I used 3 cans of the chopped clams. The clam taste was quite light, so I think I may use 5 cans next time. I tossed in chopped green onions for color, made a grilled cheese sandwich and dinner was done. My husband all but licked his bowl clean. Thank goodness for the grilled cheese or I think he would have! We both really liked this chowder.

This recipe was AWESOME.  Great proportions.  I did change it a little to suit my family's taste and to accommodate what I had in the house.  I omitted the celery, and reduced the roux to 1/2 cup, instead of 3/4-- it made the soup a little thinner, BUT that is how we like it.  I added about 1.5T of Old Bay Seasoning for a little spice... I also used "fancy whole clams" in the can, because that is all we had.  Great recipe though- we loved it... Even my husband, who insists soup is not a full meal, ate only this with the Baking Powder Biscuits (also on this site).

Awesome!  I love it.  I tried it both with the bacon and without and I have to say I like it better without.  I know I'm a minority on that one but without the bacon it tastes a lot more like Clam Chowder and less like just a potato soup.

Thanks for this, I'll be making it again.

This is the only clam chowder recipe I use. My husband is not a fan of chowder, but was shocked at how much he liked this! So was I. It really is the red wine vinegar that makes it pop!. I use three cans of chopped clams because we like bigger chunks. I also used a bottle of clam juice instead of water. Absolutely perfect!

This is very good but of course, I made it my own.  I browned cubed bacon ends and set those aside.  I sauteed the carrots, celery and onions along with pressed garlic in a bit of olive oil.  2 cups of potatoes didn't seem like much so I used 4 cups.  I used the clam juice from the cans along with the bottle of clam juice and it covered the vegetables nicely.  

I used 2 cups of half-and-half and 2 cups of 2% milk and it was fine.  I also only used 6 tablespoons of butter.  Gotta cut calories somewhere!

I added the bacon pieces along with the clams at the end.  Also used a pinch of cayenne and Old Bay.  I forgot the red wine vinegar which I think would add another layer of flavor.

As other reviewers mentioned, I also found the taste to be quite "flour-y" and a tad unpleasant.  Next time I will try the cornstarch.  But my husband and mother loved it so it could be just me.

5 stars with some revisions:  I'm from Boston and take clam chowder very seriously!!  This is a good base but lacks a lot of flavor.  First off, I double the canned clams and then add a bottle or two of clam juice instead of water.  I add about 1 to 1 1/2 tsp. of thyme with the vegetables (and leave out the carrots).  After the cream is thick I double the red vine vinegar and add Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce to taste.   This makes it a lot more flavorful in my opinion :)

This was quite good but we didn't care for the vinegar in it.  Next time I make this I will leave it out and add a bit of garlic.

I followed a number of suggestions and made a couple of changes – but mostly used recipe (adjusted for 12).  I made a day ahead because of my schedule and so many said it was better the next day, but would feel good about serving the day it was made only would simmer about 10 minutes after adding clams and such.  I sautéed the celery and onions in EVOO, added potatoes, juice from 4 cans of whole baby clams, 2 bottles of clam juice, aprox 2 tbs. black pepper and let that simmer until potatoes were tender.  I then melted 1 cup butter and 1 cup of flour {called for 1 cup plus 2 tbs. of each} let cook until flour totally blended and cooked – nice and golden, then I added 4 cups of half and half and 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth (called for 6 cups of h&h and I only had 4) and whisked until thickened.   Added veggie mix, aprox 2 tbs. of sea salt, and 6 drops of Tabasco and simmered until all nicely blended.  I took the pan off the heat, stirred in the 4 cans of clams, 1 pkg of tiny shrimp, and 6 slices of precooked bacon cut into small pieces, covered for 1 hour and then put into the refrigerator.  Next day I put into crock pot and let it heat up gradually and then took crock pot along for lunch – I took along the red wine vinegar along for each to add.  Next will substitute either 1 bottle of clam juice or 1 extra can of clams for part of the chicken broth.  I love all the reviews and suggestions this will go into my favorites.

So delicious! I used a bottle of clam juice (in addition to the liquid from the canned clams) and also added an extra can of clams. Other than that (and nixing the carrots), the recipe was solid as is. Amazing. Thank you!

This chowder recipe is by far better than some restaurant chowders. My family and I love clam chowder and it was a joy too see my family take their first bite and claim it's the best clam chowder they've ever eaten. The only changes I made was to cook 8 slices of bacon in a skillet until browned. I crumbled the bacon and set aside. I then added the carrots, celery, onion and potatoes to the bacon drippings. I cooked it in the dripping for about 3-5 minutes. I then added 1 8 ounce bottle of clam juice, and the reserve clam juice, from 3 cans whole baby clams. I simmered the vegetables until tender. The only changes I made too the white sauce was to use 1 cup of butter, 1 quart half & half  and 1/2 quart heavy cream, and 1 tsp. sugar. Other than that I folllowed the recipe as is. I think the red wine vinegar and some chopped fresh parsley is what sets this chowder a notch above the rest. Thankks for sharing your recipe Sharon. It was a big hit with me and my family.

Great recipe! This works very well using fat free milk with a splash of heavy cream. Because of the flour, it still gets very thick and creamy.  I added extra potatoes and clams as others suggested.  There are two of us in our household and we both love it!  Even better with fresh sourdough bread & butter :)

Wonderful--nice and thick the way we like it!  The only changes I made were to use chopped clams instead of minced (they're slightly bigger) and I substituted low-fat half-and-half for half of the half-and-half.  Ha--say that 3 times! Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!  I added an extra potato, about half a pound of cooked bacon pieces when I put in the clams and let everyone add their own vinegar, and it turned out great.  Next time I'll try it with extra clams - yum.  This is definitely a keeper!

EDIT: Thought I might add that I used cheap clams, That's probably why it needed more-even w/ so many cans, it still didn't taste too "clamy". Then again, I love clams!! END EDIT.
This was wonderful. My first time making clam chowder and it turned out better than any I'd ever had at restaraunts. I used 8 6.5 oz cans of clams and I think I'll put 10 in next time. I put more of each vegtable than what they say...and about a cup more 1/2-n-1/2. Very simple to make and it was very rich and hearty.

I made this for my parents on Mothers Day. I served it with an avocado/bacon salad I found on here along with crusty bread. They loved it. My Mom actually just returned that day from a trip to Florida and she said it was better than the clam chowder they had down there. Such a nice, easy and hearty recipe. All the dicing takes some time, but well worth it. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband LOVED this recipe and it's hard to get a rise out of him when it comes to my cooking.  Next time, and there will for sure be a next time, I think I'll just add 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and add the rest 1/4 tsp at a time.  It was a bit strong for my taste, also maybe just 1/2 cup of flour would be sufficient cause it was very thick.  All in all it was an AWESOME recipe!  (I also added bacon like others and it was a great addition)

I followed the instructions to a 'T', and it came out tasting more like elementary school paste than anything. I managed to make it pallatable by adding a ton of Old Bay, some white port wine and parsley flakes at the end...but, it was still missing that 'something' that makes clam chowder taste like clam chowder.

I have made clam chowder many times and it is usually a dismal failure--probably because i just cannot use butter and cream, it's just too fattening!  this version came out great. my only changes were: fat free evaporated milk in place of 1/2 and 1/2, margarine instead of butter-and i used cornstarch in place of flour (USE LESS CORNSTARCH THAN YOU WOULD FLOUR, MAYBE 1/2) i really thought the vinegar sounded weird but gave it a try and it was fantastic (i used balsamic)not vinegary at all.  super good recipe, thanks!

Pretty good and more or less foolproof. I am impatient in the kitchen so dumped all the vegetables and clam juice in one pot and butter, flour and half and half in the other. I may have done it all wrong but it still turned out very well. First chowder recipe I've made that actually turned out! Unfortunately, I love chowder and no one else in my family does but I'll make it again -- great comfort food. :)

This chowder was VERY GOOD. Just like anything I have ever had in a restraunt that I have liked. Nice, and thick, and full of flavor. I messed up a bit though. This was the first soup I have ever made, and I over cooked my vegies :(... next time I knwo though. Only cook your vegie's about 10 minutes. They will finish cooking in the soup. I liked the carrots though. I used 3 cans of minced clams, and 2 cans of Chopped clams. I agreed with many of the below reviews, and felt it needed this touch. I can't wait to make this soup again, but not over cook my vegies!

This chowder is terrific.  It's hard to go wrong with a stick and a half of butter and a quart of half-and-half!  This is really rich and good.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers to double the amount of clams--perfect.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning to the vegetables while they were poaching.  The carrots are tasty and add a nice touch of color; I wouldn't leave them out.

I made this recipe for my son's first birthday party (we had a soup theme).  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2, omitted the carrots, used chopped rather than minced clams, and replaced water with clam juice per another user's suggestion.  It was a BIG hit with everyone.  Hint: The longer you simmer the mixture before adding the vegetables the thicker it gets.  To thin, add milk as desired.

I have been using All Recipes for a long time but never felt compelled to write a review before now. This Chowder was delicious !!! The only thing I did differently was adding a little thyme & minced garlic. I also fried about 4 strips of bacon & crumbled up into the mixture. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

Sorry - you can't taste the clam in the clam chowder. It was like a creamy veggie soup. I even added a little bacon to give it some flavor. I will look for a recipe that uses bottled clam juice to give it clam flavor. We ate it for dinner but not the leftovers.

Oh man, I haven't even added the clams yet, and this is already a 5* recipe!  I only used 1/2 c. of butter, and whole milk instead of the half n half, and it's so rich and delicious you never miss the extra fat.  I did, however, add a couple of strips of uncooked chopped bacon to the butter while it was melting, and let them cook together before adding the flour, and it gives the chowder that little something extra.  It's fab, you have to try!

This review is a doubled edged because i fixed this in place of a salad it was very good but my whole family except for me got sick,I used canned clams and I don't know if it was bad clams or if it was too rich or if the main fish dinner was bad or what but now no one wants me to make clam chowder EVER again! I did as other viewers suggested and mixed whole clams and minced and added exra of both, it was easy, question though, has anyone else had this issue making clam chowder before? please do not let my Fluke of an incident spook anyone from trying this it is a good recipe

Having worked in restaurants for over 10 years, I can honestly say this might be the Best Chowda out there!  My husband would agree!!  I took some suggestions from other reviewers: cooked 4 slices of bacon (to add to chowder later); added the onions to the leftover bacon grease; and I used 5 cans of minced clams.  Absolutely delicious!!!

Excellent!  I have to thank the others who made the suggestions of adding the extra clams, using the bottled clam juice to simmer the veggies and cutting the cream with milk.  This was the best clam chowder!  Thanks too to Sharon for submitting.  This goes in the permanent file!

THIS RECIPE ROCKS!  My husband claims to *hate* clam chowder, and he had 3 bowls of this and asked to take the leftovers to work the next day for lunch.  I also had my dad & brother over, and they had a couple bowls as well.  I used 4 cans of clams & 3 cups of potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It really hits the spot on a cold day.  Thank you!!!

This is very good! I used 5 cans of minced/chopped clams, and the juice from them were enough to cover the vegetables. Next time, I'll try other reviewers' suggestion of using 2 cups half-and-half and 2 cups 1% milk. I used non-fat half-and-half and it may still be a little too rich. But no complaints here, my husband said it's better than the restaurants make. And it's nice that you can adjust the amount of vegetables and/or clams to your preference. Thank you!

Pretty good....think I will make a few more adjustments next time. Used yukon gold potatoes (which hold together great and cooked perfectly)...used 4 cans of clams instead of 3 (will use maybe 5 or 6 next time) and used the whole qt. of 1/2 and 1/2 (will use half milk next time....a little too rich I think). Tasted good but needed a little more of something....I added some dried parsley and dried thyme leaves for more flavor and added a lot of fresh ground pepper. Good recipe...just needs some tweeking!

Delicious! I left out the onions (which I hate) and added two extra cans of diced clams. Hubby raved about it (and now refuses to eat "the canned stuff") and even the kids (2 and 4) slurped down a bowl! The vinegar does add a nice kick, although I will probably use more clams to give it a little more taste.

I took the advice of many and used bacon greese to cook the veggies.  However, I did leave out the celery and carrots.  I added crumbled bacon to the mix.  I think that next time I will make it with whole mile versus cream.

This is a really quick and easy weeknight dinner dish.  It wasn't as thick as I normally like my clam chowder to be, and it could use something extra to give it more substance, maybe more clams or potatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband and father-in-law are both highly discriminating clam chowder fans from New Hampshire. My husband (who is also a chef) absolutely loved this recipe! I would not change a thing.. it is perfect and so easy. We will never have canned chowder again. I can't wait to try this recipe on my snooty father-in-law!!!

This is a great recipe but I made a couple of changes.  I used whole cream instead of half and half, cut the flour down to 1/3 cup, added two more cans of clams (we love clams!), added some cooked bacon bits, lots and lot of pepper and fresh dill.  My husband raved over it and my friends have begged me to make it again.

I added 2 more cans of whole clams, 1 tsp of Phillips Seafood seasoning, which is similar to Old Bay, and also 4 strips of Bacon, two slices of diced smoked ham
I fried the bacon, and used half the butter for the roux. It turned out absolutely wonderful, and everyone loved it. I personally felt I should have omitted the Ham. it added too much salt and took away some clam flavor. Overall, a hit. Will make it again.

This was fantastic! I did change a few things based on some reviews here which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. As others suggested, I sautéed 6 chopped up strips of bacon first and then added these back in along with the clams at the end. This gave it a ton of flavor, I think not adding bacon would be a huge miss! I also only used 1/2 cup of flour as I thought 3/4 would thicken the soup too much, 1/2 cup thickened it plenty. I also omitted the carrots, I thought that was just out of place in clam chowder. With these changes - 5 stars!!!

This recipe is easy and simple to make. I followed the recipe. The only thing I did different was add bacon. I fried the bacon in a pot and when enough fat has rendered I added the diced carrots, onions and celery. Afterwards, I added the potatoes. I did not use canned clams. I live in Washington State where razor clams can be harvested in our ocean shores. I had caught razor clams that I had cleaned, vacuumed sealed and frozen. It's way better than canned clams. Before adding the roux, I turned off the heat. I added the roux to my veggies instead since it was in a bigger pot. The last were the razor clams so that they were not overcooked. I also added an 8 oz. bottle of Bumble Bee All Natural Clam Juice because I just happen to have it. I also have razor clam juice that I added when I thawed the vacuumed sealed bag. It was creamy and tasted great! Will definitely make it again.

My husband made this for supper tonight and followed the recipes to a tee. Nice surprise to come home to this. Must say it was delisous and the croutons made it that much better. We are from Nova Scotia but must say this is the best I have ever had. A BIG YUMMY!

I thought this was great! My entire family really enjoyed it. The only modifying I did was change 1/2 of the salt to garlic salt for a little extra flavor.  Thank you for a great easy chowder recipe!

Love this recipe! I opt out of the celery, carrots, and only use one tablespoon of red wine vinegar. It is much better the second day once everything has married and settled.

Delicious. Made as is sans celery and vinegar. Was too rich for a couple of the kids but restaurant quality. I may try milk next time instead of half and half.

I use the cream but I also add some milk to lessen the fat content. I add bacon and I cook my onions and celery with that, canned sweet corn (at the end) and I add some rosemary and Old Bay. I also thicken the chowder. I buy extra clam nectar and do not add any water to the potatoes and carrots to cook them in. Super recipe!

This is very good. I left out the red wine vinegar since I did not have any. Next time I make this I am going to leave out the celery and add a bottle of clam juice.

I used fresh clams that we dug ourselves, so instead of clam juice, I cooked the vegetables in chicken broth. I didn't have bacon, but I added ham. Used 3 cups of 2% milk and 1 cup of sour cream (I was going to use raw goat milk, but it went bad). And I did not add vinegar, but this was REALLY good; I will definitely make it again! Perfect in a bread bowl. Mmmm mmmm :)

Loved it.  So quick, easy and tasty.  Like other reviewers, we enhanced the flavor by adding a bottle of clam juice, and reducing the amount of cream. We ate this as a main dish by also making it lighter and adding more protein.  For the extra protein, add a pound of scallops, shrimp, haddock or cod, or some combination.  To lighten the chowder, replace the quart of half-and-half with 2 just cups of whole milk.  Also, make it lighter by  thickening it with cornstarch dissolved in a bit of water instead of the butter and flour.  Add the cornstarch mixture when you add the seafood at the end.  Simmer everything a few minutes, then slowly add the broth to the milk to raise the temperature of the milk, before combining everything in the pot, and bringing to a last simmer.  I also added 2 packets of Splenda at the end to enhance the natural sweetness of the seafood.  You could also do this with a very small quantity of sugar if you prefer.  It tasted so good, that I never added the vinegar.

Added bacon grease to the butter. Left out the carrots.  Used all clam juice instead of water.  Mixed whole and chopped clams.  Added Old Bay seasoning. 

First time making Clam chowder and it was awesome!

Wonderful! Must give 5 stars. I followed the recipe and it was thick and creamy and delicious. I waited until the end to salt it - some of the reviews had it too salty but mine wasn't. Next time, I will use milk and not cream. Served with a hot crusty baguette. Deelish!

Out of this world. I don't even like clam chowder but figured it was a good way to get rid of leftover steamers. I love this recipe. It is amazing. I think I'll use it as a base for seafood chowder in the future.

Very nice! You can't go wrong with a quart of cream:)  Maybe add another can of clams too make it more clammy. Also, make sure not to add too much water.

I love this recipe! Ive made it several times.....I did make the following changes...I used 4 cans of chopped clams, i did not use carrots, i used dried onion and added some additional spices.  It is easy enough for anybody to make and turns out awesome! Better than the restaurant :)

Also....used reduced fat half and half and it remained the same :)

Excellent!  Instead of measuring out the vegetables - I just approximated and used 2 big carrots, 4 stalks of celery, 1 medium onion and 4 medium potatoes.  I ended up with more than a cup each but it just made it heartier.  Also, didn't hold off putting the clams in.  Delicious for this fall day in Charlotte, NC

My 13 year old son is obsessed with clam chowder and we buy a can for him at least once a week. (Disclaimer) I am NOT a great cook and when I told my son I would make him chowder instead of buying canned he begged me not to. He nixed the bacon idea as well. So, I followed the recipe and took the suggestions to add clam juice instead of water. The flour/roux think was weird and seemed clumpy and gross. I constantly stirred it until it was like a paste and then added the 1/2 and 1/2. Then I stirred for about 10 more minutes. It really thickened up. Poured in the veggies-Seemed like it would be more of a veggie stew but they mixed well with the cream. Added the clams and turned of the heat. Then added the salt and red wine vinegar. So the verdict= It's way better than canned, add more clams then the three cans and maybe the mixture of minced and whole, needs to be a little thicker, (he likes the Monterey stuff which makes a spoon stand up) So until I get The Old Fisherman's Grotto restaurant in Monterey recipe. This is what I will use!

This was amazing!!! Simmered veggies in lots of clam juice(enough to cover. Leave crunch in the celery. No water was used) and some bacon grease.  No bacon added to the soup.  ready crushed garlic was also used.  Make with fried croutons (French bread cut in cubes and fried in butter salt pepper and parsley) no vinegar was used.  did not use exact measurements on anything except for the butter flour and half and half to make the sauce.  The directions were very easy to follow, thank you!!!  This was the best clam chowder I have ever had!!!!

Wow this is amazing. I usually follow any recipe to the T tge first time but since I pretty much am obsessed with bacon I added 3 strips crumbled and also used the bacon fat. This is great w/ some oyster crackers, baguette & a glass of Riesling.

This was the first time I have ever made clam chowder and it was a hit. I read some of the reviews and I agree that bacon makes a big difference. I omitted the carrots but used everything else. It turned out fantastic. I will make this often. I might end up weighing 500 pounds.

Very good chowder.  Two things to change....use skim milk instead of half and half.  Oberweis fat free milk is the best.  Next, use 2-3 teaspoons Knorr powdered chicken bullion instead of salt.  If the chowder it too thick add more milk.  That's how to make it 5 stars.

This was my first attempt at clam chowder. I made it two times. The first time I followed the recipe and it was good. Second time I minced the celery and diced the carrots and potatoes quite small and also only used 2 cans of minced clams. I liked this better, it wa creamier and less chunky and slightly less fishy taste which I prefer.

This was a fantastic recipe! I made a few modifications that had anyone who ate it licking the bowl and begging for more. I wanted it to be lower in calories as well as with a little more kick to it, so here are the modifications. 

Also, I am a firm believer that clam chowder should always be thick! So when making the roux, take your time and let the cream/butter/flour mixture slowly cook with absolutely constant thickening.

Mods:
1. No potatoes- instead, I used double the carrots, 1.5 times the celery and about 10 cloves of garlic (chopped)
2. More seasoning!- I added garlic powder (I love garlic!), oregano, dill and parsley; all to taste
3. 1/3 less butter- instead of 3/4 cup I used 1/2 cup. It turned out just fine without the 400 extra calories. Next time I may try to get it down to half a cup, but we'll see.
4.LOTS of pepper and half a teaspoon more salt- this technically goes under seasoning, however I feel it deserves it's own bullet. The pepper really gives it a kick to compliment the thick creamy texture and the extra salt was necessary with all the extra vegetables.

AMAZING!!!  Soup had a bit of a floury taste to it so I added Old Bay as other reviewers have suggested.  Couldn't have been happier!  The Old Bay is a MUST HAVE for this recipe.  Hands down, the best Clam Chowder I have ever had!

My daughter requested clam chowder after remembering having it at Disneyland, so like a good mom does (when she's been adequately buttered up and swayed by a sweet smile and batting eyelashes) I promised her is give it a whirl. Having never made homemade clam chowder I was nervous but or no reason. It was easy to make and turned out fabulous. My picky son who hates veggies of any type scarfed down two bowls. My daughter said it outranks Disneyland and is the "Best ever!"  I agree. Will definitely be making this more often.

I would give this recipe 5 stars but for the fact that just in the process of reading the ingredients I knew it would need more seasoning.  I played with the prep a bit, too, but that was more because I assumed I knew how to start it but instructions were a bit different. All worked out okay. This chowder turned out really rich, creamy and just thick enough ~ all of those are a must for this Massachusetts resident and her family. I included about a teaspoon each of Thyme, Dill and Old Bay seasoning. Generous sprinkling of salt and a combination of white and fresh ground pepper. The "Chowdah" won't be eaten until tomorrow to allow the flavors to ripen so taste should be even better!!

Ehh, made recipe exactly as stated. Boy was it bland. I had to over compensate with salt and then it just tasted like salty creamy soup. It was way too thick too. Next time i will not add water. Maybe more clam juice and maybe brown the vegis a bit to add some depth of flavor.

Excellent recipe.  I use that I dig that morning and the juice from those clams as the liquid for the soup instead of canned clams.  I don't add any salt as there is plenty of salt in the fresh clam juice.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it, but found it too thick. I thought it tasted as good or better than restaurant clam chowder and I'll definitely make it again, though I will substitute lowfat milk for the half and half. Be sure to have soup crackers on hand for this one.

This is a GREAT clam chowder recipe.  I didn't have half and half on hand, but used half skim and half heavy cream. Incredibly delicious and a real hit for Christmas Eve. I didn't change anything else.

This would be good with either Malt Vinegar or a spot of lemon juice if you don't have red wine vinegar on hand. Turned out so good! I cut the recipe in half and added a bit of bacon. I was also out of onion so I used onion powder instead. It worked fine and I will make this again.

I have been making this for years.  It's the Bratten's Restaurant recipe.  Bratten's was a marvelous place in Salt Lake City, Utah  that closed about20 years ago.  The red wine vinegar gives it that "extra something" that makes it unique. Best Clam Chowder in the world.

This is so delicious! Even my sister who normally doesn't like clam chowder loved it. Not too much of a seafood taste (I know it's clam chowder, but too much can even ruin it) and very creamy. I will probably be making this again...most likely for my family to have during the winter months. ;)

A little trick my mother taught me. Use instant potatoes to thicken your clam chowder. Add a little at a time until it's just right!

This was absolutely scrumptious!  I made a couple modifications as other reviewers did as well.  I added a can of creamed corn & about a 1/2 pound of crumbled bacon.  This recipe definitely goes on the list of favorite fall chowders!

This is a great recipe. I actually prefer clam chowder without bacon or ham so finding this was excellent. I did a couple of things differently. Instead of just throwing in all the veggies all at once with the juice, I sauteed the onions in butter first just till soft, translucent & slightly browned. I also sauteed the potatoes in as well (stirring them into onions & butter for about 3 min). I then added the clam juice, carrots, celery & topped it off with about 2 cups of HOT water & a tsp of THYME. That cooked for a few min while I made the roux. I love it creamy so I added a half pint of heavy cream. I also used 2 cans of whole baby clams and 2 cans of minced clams as well as more potatoes than the recipe called for. IT WAS SO GOOD!

Heavy flour flavor... I didn't like it, but my boyfriend loved it.  I'm into "light" flavors, so it might just not be to my taste... Maybe a Manhattan would be better for me.

I did the bacon thing as most reviewers had suggested. Only thing I want to mention is this: After adding the flour to melted butter, cook it on medium low heat for a few minutes (10 or less). This remove the raw smell of flour. Also, after adding the half-n-half the flour was made into clots and I only got rid of them by transferring the mixture into a bowl and using the mixer on it for a couple of minutes. That made it totally smooth and nice. As for the vegetable part, next time I'll drain the broth, keep it and put the cooked pieces (except the potato) in the food processor for a few seconds to grind them well, and return to the broth. That'll give the soup a smoother look.

Oh wow! Honestly the best soup I have ever tasted. I can't believe the difference adding Red Wine Vinegar to a recipe does. Next time I'll make sure to have the vegetables ready before I start the soup base... I found that waiting for the vegetables to become tender made my soup base too thick because I kept stirring and stirring but it still came out amazing.

Followed this recipe to the T, but thought it was too thick at the end. My son loved it and he said it didn't sound good, but he raved about it and wants me to make it again. I complained about it being too thick, but he wants me to cook it that way again. However, I'm going to decrease the flour some and I don't think I used as much water as I should have to "cover" the vegetables. I wish there had been an exact amount listed, but I will increase it next time. I will also buy some clam juice for more clam flavor. But this is a great base to spring from. Thanks!

This is hard to rate.  My husband liked it, I did not.  I thought it was lacking something and rather bland.  I guess I should have followed other suggestions and added bacon. Will not make again.

Very good. I think the vinegar adds a nice flavor boost. I added bacon because I have always made clam chowder with bacon. I used 1/2 non fat milk for caloric reasons and it was Very Good. My new recipe!

I make this recipe ALL the time! It's one of my absolute favorites!! I too add bacon and bacon grease for flavour and then cut back on the butter and I also add a couple jars of clam juice to replace the water. The vinegar at the end just takes it to a whole new level of yum!! Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe:)

Fantastic!  Will make this again and again.  I cooked 6 strips of bacon and sauteed/softened the vegetables in the bacon fat before I added the clam juice to the pot.  I added 4 cans of minced clams and there was enough juice to cover the vegetables so no water was needed.  I also added some cayenne pepper as we like a little kick to it. The red wine vinegar is brilliant.... DO NOT OMIT!!!

This was very delicious!  I didn't have carrots, so substituted zucchini.  Also did not have much half and half, so only used 1/2 cup and added some milk--not as much as stated, because we like our clam chowder thick.  We used Old Bay Seasoning, and it turned out great!  Did not use bacon, so this is a lower-fat version!

Very delicious!  I gave it 4 stars simply because it wasn't the BEST clam chowder I have ever tasted, but it sure is yummy!! I made the mistake of dumping the drained clams whole into the chowder before thinking that I should probably cut them up first.  So I ended up fishing them out, chopping them, and putting them back in.

This recipe is absolutely perfect as-is, however, after reading some of the reader comments below I am totally adding bacon to the next batch. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, PioneerGirl!

Yummy!  Wish I could figure out how to make this in one pot.  I end up using bowls and two pots to make this.  But it is really yummy!

I make this every Christmas for my family and it is a hit with everyone!  Even my picky 2 year old eats it. I do make some modifications and put bacon bits, garlic salt and cayenne pepper in it.  The bacon grease that I get from the bacon I use in place of the butter.  I know, I know...not fat free by any means, but it is only made once a year so I splurge.

Great chowder.  I also included bacon as recommended by other commenters.  Comes out a little bland but that's what salt, pepper and hot sauce are for.  Loved it!

Absolutely the best homemade chowder, and practically beats any I've tried anywhere else! I followed the recipe to a T, with only 3 minor changes. First, I sauteed bacon with the onions, then added the rest of the veggies and liquid and simmered all together. Secondly, I didn't have half and half, but I had whole milk on hand, and that worked just as well. Everything came together perfectly!! Third, I added corn, because I like corn in my chowder and so does my family. I doubled the recipe and it makes a big pot that feeds a family of 6 adults, plus leftovers. Make sure to cook the roux a bit before adding the cream to cook away the flour taste. And the longer you cook the cream with the roux, the thicker your base will be. My chowder was perfect!!! And who would've thought that red wine vinegar (the secret ingredient) would have brought all the flavors together so wonderfully! This has to be the most easiest and super tasting chowder ever.

The recipe as is, is quite bland, but a good base to season as you would like. There are several good suggestions as to how to perk this recipe up (tsp onion and/or garlic powder, etc.). Clam juice itself is not overly tasteful. Instead of water or additional clam juice, I'd cover the cooking vegetables with a quart of chicken broth. Also, a good roux takes takes a few minutes and patience (the flour & butter step). Alternatively, I would definitely go with the bacon suggestion: Dice up 4 strips of bacon and fry until golden brown, add 1/2 cup flour. and mix together, browning slightly - then add gradually add the cream, etc. Good luck!

Omg!!! Followed this recipe exactly except seasoned flour with a little Old Bays (@ 1/2 tsp) and a pinch of garlic powder and used white pepper instead of black pepper and I added it to the veggies as they cooked. Very simple, easy, quick recipe...start to finish under an hour. You will not be disappointed. Yummy yummy yummy!!!

OMG!!!It was amazing. I have been craving for clam chowder for some time now. I made it yesterday and was pleasantly surprised, because it was much better than I expected. It was even better than some restaurants'. And it was not hard to make at all. I will, definately, make it again, and again, and again. Thank you for sharing.

I absolutely love this recipe.  Every time I make it I'm told it's the best clam chowder ever. I use fat free half n half to reduce the fat and the last time I made it added Old Bay.  We also add mushrooms (we add mushrooms to everything).  This recipe is great as originally written and great with little tweaks as well!

This was really delicious, I'll definitely make it again. Following the advice of other reviewers I sauteed the vegetables in bacon grease and threw in 4 crumbled strips of bacon at the end. I stirred milk into my roux, only 3c. because I like my chowder thick. Awesome!

This was a fine chowder with extra salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I omitted the carrots (personal preference) and used 4 cans of clam instead of 3 so there was no need to add extra water.  As others have already mentioned you must cook the roux lest you wind up with a pastey-tasting soup!

I followed the recipe exactly and I was very disappointed. It did not taste like the clam chowder I loved so much in New England. The vinegar was overpowering to me. I would not make again.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and started the recipe by cooking some bacon and then cooking the vegetables in the bacon grease.  I also used 1/2 half and half and half 1% milk.  The soup was very thick.  Next time I might add some bottled clam juice to think it out a little.  Great dinner for a cold winter's night!

we LOVE this chowder--I don't measure my vegetables, I just throw them in:  loads of potatoes, carrots, onion...depends on how much I have around.  This is a delicious, stick-to-your-ribs, hearty chowder and is now my go-to recipe!  Thanks!!!

I made this soup for dinner tonight, and it was awesome!!!  After reading some reviews though, I did add more veggies to it (simply because I never measure them, but know it was more than called for).  I also used FIVE cans of clams and their juice!  Next time however, I will fry some bacon and use the fat to add to the trinity for the veggies to cook in.  I did add some finely chopped honey smoked spiral ham, simply because I had so much left over from Christmas.  I also added some Bay seasoning to it..and served it with sourdough bread.  GREAT SOUP...will definitely make this again........and again!

I made it 'as written' and it was OK.  It was edible, but not fantastic.  It was bland, and I like bland things.  I added some bacon to it - that helped.  I added more pepper than I thought I would need.  It was a super quick recipe to make, I would have given it 4 stars, but it was too much work for not enough flavor.

I have made this clam chowder 2 twice.  First as written....YUM, second, I used a quart fat free half and half with a splash of skim milk.  I also fried up some bacon.  Oh, and I used a splash of white wine as an excuse to pour myself a glass.  :)  I baked some bread, served up the chowder and my husband...of few words....said, "This is good!"  That is high praise in my house. Cheers.

Very, very good clam chowder.  I followed previous advice and fried 3 thick cut slices of bacon in my pan before adding the veggies, etc.  I don't recommend any more than 3 because the soup might come out greasy.  As it was, it came out perfect.  I thinned it out with skim milk because I like it thinner.  The red wine vinegar is a MUST HAVE.  Don't skip it!  It adds brilliant flavor.  Definitely one of the freshest, best clam chowders I have ever eaten.  Every time a friend of mine gets sick, this is what she wants me to make her.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great recipe! I followed the advice from Crystal S which made this recipe taste almost too good... The 1/2 teaspoon of smoke flavoring really made this dish stand out too! One thing for sure, I'll never buy canned chowder again :D

I loved this. I did follow the no water and added clam juice from the cans and an extra bottle of clam juice while cooking the veggies down to tender. I would do half of the carrots next time. They were a bit strong but not too over powering. I tried a bowl without the red wine vinegar and with a few drops. I liked it both ways. I did half minced clams and half whole clams. I actually prefer the minced clams. I also followed some reviews about the half-and-half and half milk. It was still perfectly creamy.

This is the best Clam chowder I have ever made, well its the first one, and OMG,, its the best. The only thing that I will change the next time is cut the flour down to 1/2 cup. I also used light cream rather than the 1/2 and 1/2.and rather than the water I used a cup of bottled claim juice.
I also added 1 1/2 teaspoon of Beau Monde Seasoning, makes a huge  impact on the flavor.
This one is a keeper. Thank you so much.

I made this recipe exactly how it says last night (for the 1st time) and it was a hit. My 7-year old first said he didn't want to have it. I told him he had to try it first and *bam* he ended up having two bowls and absolutely loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

This chowder was deliciously warm and comforting. A lot of other reviews recommend adding bacon, but it is not necessary because this recipe is fantastic without it. We will definitely make it again!

I loved this Clam Chowder recipe!! It was SO delicious. Turned out perfect! I only made a few changes. I cooked 6 strips of bacon and used the bacon grease to sautee the vegetables and clam juice. At the end I added the bacon, crumbled up and put it in at the last second before I served. It's always a positive thing when my husbands picky taste buds agree with what I make :) We were both impressed.

This is the best clam chowder I have made, and I've made plenty, being from the Bay Area!  I did sauté the bacon & use the drippings, which added much flavor, and served the bacon bits on top.  Delicious!  
Thanks Pioneer girl!

this was my first clam chowder and it turned out awwwwwwwwesome!
only thing i did is add some sauteed in butter portobello mushrooms which i figured would have the same texture as the clams- couple sprinkles of thyme mentioned by others-  and i did buy 2 chopped, 1 minced and one can of whole baby clams- and i think i was a little over the 2cups on the potatoes-  and left out the carrots-  it was absolutely great!  and last- it did seem a little thick at the end and i just added a dash of milk-

thanks Pioneer Girl

This recipe is fairly simple yet the results are amazing.  I was a little skeptical of the vinegar but it adds a richness and no vinegary taste at all.  I've started to use this trick in many other creamy soups.  After making this just once my family was hooked and begs me to make it over and over.  The only change I've made is to use 1% milk or even fat-free evaporated milk in place of the cream to lighten it a bit - can't tell the difference.  Perfect for dreary, cold days but I've also made it in the summer!  Grab some crusty bread and you're set!

This was very good. I did make a few changes based on other suggestions, such as sauting the veggies in bacon fat. I only had a 50oz can of clams, so i used the juice from that and did not add any additional water. I also added a couple of chicken boullion cubes as I was afriad that it would lack flavor and some garlic poweder. I used the 3/4cup of flour and it was perfect.

I used clam juice instead of water and a little less flour than indicated because it didn't look like it needed any more. I also chose baby clam instead of minced.  The flavor was lacking something but not sure what.  And I did try the red wine vinegar. My kids enjoyed this more than I did so I'm glad I tried this.

My family and I didn't care for this much. I think it has too much cream, it seemed very 'heavy', and there was just not enough flavor. I've tasted much better, and for the time and effort it takes to make this, if it's not a 'keeper' and doesn't get the approval of my family, I will not make it again.

Sauted veggies in fat of 4 slices of bacon as some advise.  Used 2 cups fat free half and half and 2 cups skim milk to cut the calories.  Use three cans of chopped clams and one can whole baby clams with all the juice.  Omit the water. Did not add cooked bacon to finished product as I did not like the texture.

I added a firm white fish and langostino tails to make this a seafood chowder.  I used less butter and half and half and a little less flour.  Came out wonderfully!

This was a great recipe. I never made clam chowder before but I've eaten lots of it. I made this for my parents and they loved it too. Even my super picky son had two bowls. I did saute the veggies in bacon grease and substituted 1/2 the water for clam juice. Other then those changes all I did was serve crumbled bacon and chives on the top of the chowder. Thanks so much I'll be making this again and again!

Yum ~ this recipe was fantastic.  My only change was to use cornstarch instead of flour to make it gluten free.  Will make again!!

This clam chowder was so good and easy to make... everyone that tasted it liked it as well! I followed the advice of using clam juice instead of water.

This was delicious! I had never had homemade clam chowder before, only the canned stuff. Now I think I am spoiled forever! I cant imagine ever being satisfied with canned again now that I have tried this. I did apply a few reviewer suggestions - I exchanged 1/4 of the butter for bacon grease, added 1/2 tsp. old bay, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. garlic salt. The only small adjustment I would make next time, is using larger chunks of clam rather than the minced. Thanks for sharing!

Did away with most of the butter and all of the flour....added two cans of Cream of Celery soup and increased the amount of clams to 5 cans.  Bacon was a nice addition too.  Thickened nicely.  Everybody raved over the dish.  You can make oyster stew the same way without the bacon, vinegar and potatoes.

I been looking for a good clam chowder recipes well this is it! I did it change a few minor things I just can't seem to help myself. on the advice of other reviewers I cooked 3 slices of bacon in my stock pot, then took the bacon out to drains and crumble in later. when I added the clam juice and water I also added in some time and old bay seasoning (next time I will use bottled clam juice instead of water). I didn't want to use a separate pan so any microwave safe bowl I added the potter and the flower and cooked it together until thoroughly nick n about a lease then I added the half and half into the bowl using a whisk. then I dumped the mixture into the stock pot with the vegetables and water and juice. I cooked the whole thing on medium heat until nice and hot thick but not boiling. then I added back in the bacon and the clams. I used 2 cans of chopped clams and 1 can of baby clams. I didn't have any red wine vinegar but I will try it next time it was still amazing without it!

Amazing chowder, my whole family, young and old loved it!! I added a jar of clam juice (i like my clam chowder to taste like clam chowder, not potatoe soup) and i added a jar of real bacon pieces.

Made this last night and it was amazing! Cut up a pound of bacon, cooked in the stock pot and added to veggies and clam sauce before cooking. I used skim milk instead of half and half and it still was amazing. Let's be honest w/ as much bacon grease and butter how could it not, I probably could have used water and it still would have been delicious! This is a must have recipe! Alot like Market Street Grill clam chowder!

Absolutely fantastic!  I used cream instead of the 1/2 and 1/2 cause that's what I had on hand.  I also added a little bacon grease (what's not better with bacon in it?!) and added some thyme at the end.  My 2 boys who hate seafood had seconds!!  Absolutely add the red wine vinegar.  I wasn't so sure about it, but after trying it, I now proclaim it to be the ultimately secret ingredient.

Excellent recipe. I've just finished making it for the first time, and will make it again. When trying new recipes, I generally do not make any changes; however, I did make four tiny changes to this one. Instead of water, I used store-bought vegetable broth, about 1 cup more potato, a clove of garlic, and 1 additional can of minced clams (because they were buy 1 and get 1 free). I don't care for strong fish or seafood flavors, and even with the extra can of clams, the flavor did not overwhelm my palate. Because I try to stick to a mostly vegetarian diet, I chose to bump up the overall flavor of the chowder with vegetable broth instead of water as directed in the recipe or sauteing in bacon as suggested by other reviewers.

I have followed the recipe as is, but have now tweeked it quite a bit.  My first complaint is that it is not clammy enough.  I add an 8 oz bottle of clam juice and 2 other cans of chopped clams. I also add bay leaves, a clove of chopped garlic, a pinch of thyme leaves.  Some white wine adds some good flavor as well. Cooking on the stove doesn't seem to soften the potatoes enough, so I now put it in a crock pot to simmer to enhance the flavor and cook the vegetables more.  Much better!

Delicious combination of flavor makes a thick and filling chowder.  I can't eat bacon, so the fact that this recipe did not call for it made it a great one to try.  I have made it twice now.  This chowder is fast and easy and worth the work.  I have made it with fat-free half-and-half and regular half-and-half and it tastes good both ways (but of course it is better with the real stuff).

Great! But not quite perfect, I thought it was a little too half-and-half-y. Next time I will probably drop about 15% volume of it and displace it with water or clam juiciness. But I did think this was a fantastic start to learning how to make some chowder. Also I must like clams, or meat, or something, because I think it should be about double the clammy-ness. More clam juice too, and less water in result. But thanks, this is now my basis for clam chowder!

My husband and I really enjoyed this clam chowder. Next time I would use clam juice instead of water and use more clams as many reviewers suggested.

My husband gave this five stars, I would give it about three as it lacked some flavor until you put the vinegar in. Then it tasted like vinegar. :) But hubby says it's one of the better clam chowders he has ever had. 

I like my soup/chowder to be chunky so I sliced carrots and celery and left my onion pieces big. It ended up tasting very floury despite following directions to the letter, so I added milk at the end to  balance it out and make it less dense (the thicker cut vegetables could be to blame for this too). 

Definitely will make again, if only to keep husband happy.

This was a great recipe. Delish!!!  Things I did differently was to first take 2 strips of bacon and cook them in the skillet.  I then took them out and drained the fat -- then cooked the veggies.   At the end of the recipe, I crumbed the bacon and put it in.  Instead of a quart of half-and-half I used a pint of heavy cream.  I also didn't use canned clams, but fresh clams.

FABULOUS!  I made this tonight for my parents and my Father told me that it was to die for!  I did add the bacon like other reviews said...I do think that it would be just as good without it though.  Next time I think that I will use clam juice instead of the water for just a little more kick.  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!  I gave it 4 stars because I did add 4 pieces of bacon and sauteed the veggies in some bacon grease.  It was FABULOUS!  Can't wait to have it tomorrow after it's sat overnight!  Thanks for the great recipe.

followed recipe exact, the flavor was awesome, however it was a bit to creamy/thick for my family. I guess the places we eat clam chowder serve it more liquidy so that is what we are used too. Other than that it was good.

Using the bacon is a must.  Since we had fresh clams, I chopped those a little and threw them in at the end.  We left out the vinegar and just added salt and pepper.  Beautiful results, thanks for sharing this one!

This is the best clam chowder I've ever made. It's not the best I've eaten, but deserves better than four stars, so I gave it five. I minced all the veggies (and added 1/2 cup leek) and cut the potatoes into small cubes. I sauteed all the veggies except the potatoes in a little bacon grease and instead of using water to boil the veggies, I used clam juice. This is the recipe I will use from now on. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this recipe, and it is very good. Everyone loved it. I did add mushrooms though, because we love them and it was well worth it.

I halve the recipe and only use one can of clams, that way I wont have any leftover. It's really good but since the clams get chewy after a while it's not really a recipe you want to eat the next day. Other than adding the clams right before serving, I wouldn't change a thing.

I doubled this recipe for Christmas Eve, and it was a big crowd pleaser. There were 12 guests at the table and it made just enough but none to spare. I did make a few changes, such as adding bacon and using 1% milk to cut the thickness, but overall, I stuck to the recipe.

I finally got tired of shelling out money for canned soup, and I am soo glad I found this recipe! We love clams in our house and the heartier the better, so I added lots of chopped clams. I sauteed my veggies in the bacon fat, but I wasn't really feeling the bacon in my soup, so I left it out. I also didnt have clam juice, so I added fish sauce! I know that sounds weird, but it worked. The soup was a little thick, so I thinned it out a tad.  This recipe is so good, I dont think I ever buy canned chowder again. I didnt know about the veggies, but except for chopping the carrots extra small (hiding them from my 5yod who will not touch them) they were no problem at all and added great flavor. perfect for a chilly day in the house!

Awesome recipe!! I didn't have celery, and I used fresh clams because I had them. Absolutely deelicious. Oh, I also cut a bajillion calories by using skim milk and half the butter. Tasted ama-zing. Really hit the spot.

I don't like clams but I sure do love this soup.  I made it at Christmas and everyone loved it!  I just added a little but of garlic powder and a little extra half and half cause I don't like it so thick.  Best clam chowder ever!

i usually make the quick and easy clam chowder recipe on this site and my whole family loves. i figured this would be better because it's completely homemade, but we were disappointed. this really turns out too thick and pastey. despite using an extra can of clams, it still was clammy enough for us. i will not be making this again.

Delicious!  I love chowder.  My parents first made it when my cousins came over to visit, and we LOVED it!  We've been making it again and again ever since.  I personally like clam chowder in bread bowls.  They are YUMMY!  We didn't add carrots, but threw in 6-8 strips of bacon.

PERFECT.  HUBBY and father VERY happy. Did not last 2 days. Hubby requested more than 3 cans of clams next time. I added a dash more of red wine vinegar, a dash more of clam juice and lots of pepper. Make to taste. GREAT recipe. Keeper!

This was an amazing chowder! I have never made chowder before and my family loved it.  It was very easy to follow.  I did not use celery because my husband doesn't like celery.  I knew it was good and my daughter came over the next day to eat the leftovers!

Really good chowder recipe.
I added bacon based on a few other comments, and also added some Old Bay seasoning and white pepper for zest.  After some trial and error I switched balsamic vinegar for the red wine called for in the recipe, it adds the same flavor without the sweetness.

This is an excellent chowder. It's very hard to find a good chowder even here in Jacksonville. This is the second best I have ever tried. It's the best I have ever had at home. I did add bacon and the grease. Awesome recipe!

Great recipe!  Better than most restaurant versions. I used Bar Harbor Chopped Clams, substituted 2% milk for half-and-half, and reduced butter to 1/4 cup. Still thick and delicious! Added red pepper flakes and fresh Italian flat leaf parsley to taste at the end when I added the clams.  Definitely don't skip the red wine vinegar and you will love this recipe.  Yummmm!!

This was my first time making clam chowder and it turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the celery. I had some bacon bits in the fridge so I added about 2 tbl of those.  I also used chopped clams instead of minced.  Thanks for a great recipe!

All I can say is wow! What a great recipe. Made this for the first time and loved it. I had been looking for a great clam chowder recipe and this one was the best I have ever had, on the first try.  Thank you very much for posting it.     A friend who didn't like clam chowder tried it and loved it!

Great, simple recipe.  I halved it and followed exactly.  I might add more veggies next time but that could be because of halving it (or maybe I just prefer it).

This was very good, although I did make a few changes. Started out by cooking 4 slices chopped bacon ands then used the fat to sauté the celery and onion. Left out the carrots, and used at lease 2x the amount of clams. I did use some whole ( canned) clams which were  little "chewy" but not too bad, and gave a little more texture . I also seasoned with a bay leaf and some thyme. At the end, garnished with the cooked crispy bacon. Def. Will make again!

I doubled the recipe and it worked out great.  I didn't have half and half, so I used whipping cream and whole milk.  The consistency was perfect.  Like some of the other reviews suggested, I cooked some bacon, sauteed the onions in the grease, and crumbled it into the finished chowder.  Perfect recipe for a large family.

It was good, however, I would only put in half of the potatos. We ended up having potato soup it seemed like. I also ended up doubling the clams, which I still didn't think there were enough.  Good soup, but I would do the changes.

It was a solid four as the recipe is written. It was a five when I added some garlic and hot sauce. My six year old ate it as is and loved it, what an amazing thing!

I loved it! Very easy to make. I took some pointers from others and used some bacon and its' grease. I think the bacon added tons of flavor.

My husband is very particular about New England Clam Chowder.  I used this recipe for our first attempt at making it ourselves.  And he raved that its the best he's ever had.  We'll definitely will be making this again.

This was my first time making Clam Chowder.  My teenage daughter loves Clam Chowder so we made this together and it turned out wonderfully.  It was so easy and the red wine vinegar gave it a great taste.  We will be making this again and again.  So simple, so tasty.

Added Beef broth , because I couldn't find any extra clam juice to cover the vegetable mixture , and it came out awesome .I also fried up half a pound of bacon and left the grease in the pan , I then added all the vegetables to the left over grease , and sauted them , and added the clam broth as well as the beef stock.

I agree with the title of this recipe, this is the best clam chowder ever!! My adaptions are for a 12 serving recipe. I used 1 stick of butter, 2 cups of half and half and 4 cups of 1% milk. My recipe was sooo creamy and rich I can't imagine using the amount  of butter and cream that the recipe used. If you don't like clams, you can take out the clams and clam juice. I made it both ways and it is great either way!!!

I love this recipe, it is my go to for clam chowder.  It makes a very mild calm chowder which I think is cleaner tasting.  Sometimes I will use crab meat and bay scallops along with one can of clams instead of using the  3 cans of clams the recipe calls for and make seafood chowder.  Perfect winter soup.

Excellent starting point, but could use a little tweaking here and there. I didn't use 3/4 cup butter only 1/2 and decided to use 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups low fat milk. I skipped the bacon browning part that everyone is recommending since it seems a bit unhealthy for me and still came out fine. Be sure to use all the clam juices from the clams and omit the water entirely. Instead of using flower, I used 1/2 cup of corn starch that made the chowder nice and thick! I also decided to skip the onions and use onion powder instead. The red wine vinegar is a nice touch I added about 3-4 tablespoon, make sure to add a little at a time otherwise it may be overwhelming for your taste.

This is soooooo good and is very popular in my family.  I am looking for ways to make it less rich, I may try using milk instead of cream or perhaps 5% cream.  The only change I make is that I add bacon at the end.

I have made this recipe dozens of times and I am always asked for the recipe. The only thing different that I do is to use chopped clams instead of diced and fat free half and half, you can't tell the difference. Even my more than picky husband will eat it. try it you'll like it. SJS9

So very tasty!!  Followed recipe for the most part.  Did do as a few reviewers mentioned and browned up some bacon and used that fat to saute the onion, carrot, celery, and some garlic.  Also used some in place of some of the butter.  Also added a jar of calm juice and another can of chopped calms.  Will definitely be making this again!

Clam Chowder is my favorite soup and this recipe does not disappoint.  I took the suggestion from others regarding cooking the vegetables in bacon fat and using the bacon pieces in the soup.  I also used corn starch instead of flour, green onions instead of regular onions, and used only 1/2 cup of butter.  It is delicious!

I made this for dinner the other day & it was pretty good! I used 3 cans of whole baby clams instead of minced, I also used a bottle of clam juice instead of water. Before I started the chowder I cooked up some hickory flavored bacon, then placed them on a plate & crushed them up. I also put the bacon grease in the pan with the potatoes, carrots, etc to add flavor & sprinkled a little garlic powder in there. I added a tiny bit of cornstarch to the half & half mixture cause I like a thick chowder! It still seemed to need a little more flavor, but it was still really good! Next time I make it I think I'll use heavy cream instead of the half & half & add real garlic to it instead of powder. Over all very good chowder!

Well this was the first time making clam chowder, and wow this was great. I did everything to the 't'. Only a couple things different, I did the bacon like others suggested, and I also added a little bit of heavy whipping cream to make it a tad thicker. Really good soup, though it wasn't as 'clammy' as I would have liked. Next time I'm gonna add more clams and clam juice along with some lemon. But again YUM!

This was an excellent chowder!  I tweaked it a bit to match our preferences, and I have received numerous compliments on it as my husband took it to work to share with his co-workers.  I added bay leaves to the simmering onions, celery, and potatoes in clam juice (and eliminated the carrots based on personal preference).  I also added salt & pepper at that stage.  For the creamy base, we like a really thick chowder, so I used 1 container of 1/2 and 1/2 and heavy whipping cream.  When that wasn't thick enough, I took a small container of heavy whipping cream and added about 1/2 - 3/4 of a cup of cornstarch.  I whipped it together then added to the creamy base, and the thickness was awesome!  I also used a LOT more clams than recommended (8 cans) and used red potatoes for color. Thanks for the recipe - I have been a clam chowder fan my whole life but never had the courage to try and make it myself.

My son the clam chowder guru loved it!  All I had on hand was wheat flour which gave it a different look but he didn't care.  I also used 2% milk and whole baby clams instead of minced.  YUMMY!

This would have been 2-3 stars without modifications. I followed the directions but it was really bland and did not taste right. I cooked some bacon and put the remaining soup in the pot with the bacon grease. I also had to buy another bottle of clam juice. After that, it tasted good. I am giving it 4 starts because it gave me a good base to use. Thanks!

Wow... I have never made a creamed based soup or chowder before and I have to say this recipe is easy and great!  For those rookies, just be patient with the thickening of the cream... it takes a good 10 minutes before it really starts to thicken.  You do not need to add heavy cream, the half & half makes it plenty thick.  The only thing I did different was I added some minced garlic and instead of the vinegar I used port wine!

I loved this recipe. First i did what others suggested and cooked up some bacon. I added the onions and potatoes and a little butter.I used the juice from 3-8oz cans of chopped clams and 3-16oz cans of whole clams for the broth. I thickened the half and half and added it. Then I added the clams. I let that heat for a little while then added the vinegar. Lastly I put the crumbled bacon back into the pot. This was fantastic!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Just made for dinner and OMG sooooooooo good!!  Only change after reading others review was to use only a 1/2 cup of butter, added bacon and celery salt.  I'm not crazy about clam chowder but my husband is and we both loved it!!  Served in bread bowls with salad and was a big hit!  Thanks for a great recipe  = )

I've made this so many times over the last two fall and winter seasons and I can't believe I have never rated it.  This clam chowder is fabulous - made it as written once and it was just way too rich for us but I still can't give it any less than five stars because it's just as good with 1% milk and one-third the amount of butter. Usually when you take away the "good" stuff and replace it with healthier options, you may be left with a so-so product, but not with this chowder. It is still rich and creamy.  I always use regular milk instead of cream (I've used whole milk, 2% and 1% - what ever I have on hand) and you really can't tell a difference.  I only use 1/4 cup of butter (half a stick as opposed to 1 and 1/2 sticks) and 1/2 cup of flour. Always make sure to cook your flour in the butter for a minute or two to cook out the "flour" taste.  I usually add 4 cans of chopped (not minced) clams and boil my veggies in the clam juice and vegetable broth for added flavor. The red wine vinegar makes all the difference. This recipe is so good. Thank you Pioneergirl!

Such a winner! Added bacon, as commenters suggested, and omitted carrots in favor of more onions and celery. Also substituted 2 cups heavy cream, 2 cups milk for the half and half. Also, I live in China, and I couldn't find clams with clam juice. I used canned smoked clams packed in oil instead. Added the clam oil to the veggies - worked great!

I wish I had bacon, I would have used that to build on the flavors.  It was very good, a little too rich.  Next time will only use half of the half and half and the other half 2 % milk, and add bacon.  Otherwise, very nice

This is the best soup I have ever had!   I did use more clams than the recepie called for.   I also used fresh clams and some caneed ones and only added clam juice as per others recomendation.   The soup was a big hit!  Every one loved it at the clam bake.    The soup might be a bit rich for some, and one could substitute some whole milk for some of the half and half.

I love this recipe- followed the recommendations and added bacon and thought it was fabulous. One small change- instead of using a pan and a skillet, I cooked the bacon in a wok, removed them- added the veggies, clam juice and butter, once they were done I sprinkled them with flour making sure to eliminate all flour lumps, and then added the rest per the recipe. Less dishes, and more flavor!

I made a few small changes. 1)like someone else suggested, i only used clam juice, no water 2) i reduced the butter and half half by a third to cut down on fat, and substituted the rest of the cream with milk. 3) i can not have gluten, so like most recipes that call for a thickner, i substituted cornstarch. 4) and most importantly i added a clove of garlic.  after tasting the completed recipe, i felt it still needed something and garlic did the trick.  i read many reviews that said bacon was added, but we don't eat bacon, and felt the garlic added that last needed flavor.

Mine came out a little drier than I wanted, but I substituted soy flour for all-purpose flour and had to leave it on the stove for a little longer than expected before serving so that's probably the culprit. Other than that it tasted delicious.

I love this recipe! I use a big can of clams that I get from the bulk section and a quart of half and half. I also thicken mine with 2 cups of instant potatoes rather than flour, it gives it a great flavor. Definitely a family favorite!

I specifically chose this clam chowder recipe because it did not rely on bacon for flavor.  I cut back on both the butter and flour using only 1/2 cup of each, and it worked just fine. I did saute fresh minced garlic in the butter before adding the flour.  In place of the half and half, I used milk. The recipe was still rich and thick with these cuts in fat. Next time I wouldn't add the carrots just because I don't think that they really belong in there.  I was timid about adding the vinegar...tasting the soup before and in between adding a little vinegar at a time, just to make sure it would be ok, but not to worry...adding the full amount of vinegar adds to the flavor, but you can't tell that there is vinegar in there.  The type of canned clams used were Baby Clams-Fancy Whole, and the size was just right.  This is the first time I've tried making clam chowder, and we really liked this.

I have made this recipe so many times. Each time I cannot believe how good it is. I also add the bacon and cook the veggies in the grease. I use clam juice instead of water to add flavor. YUMMY!!!!

The family really loved this chowder. I must admit that I changed the recipe a bit only because I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used 1 tbsp of red wine and 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar. I also was short on potatoes so I used frozen corn instead. This is a keeper and I can't wait to share with friends and family.

Pros:  -Easy to put together  -The taste was fabulous (after the extra additions) -My hubby asked for two bowls and there was still lots for tomorrow!  Cons/Changes:  -I wasn't sure how long to let the half and half/rue mixture simmer for. I felt like I was stirring it for at least 15 minutes before I noticed any sort of thickening -I added a lot more vinegar and salt than suggested in the recipe -Without the additional "bacon step" I think this would have been pretty bland  Overall, I enjoyed the taste and ease of preparation so will likely make it again!

This was very good and siimple to prepare. I think I would add some "real" clams also to hep up the clam content. The canned stuff is good but tends to get lost with the veggies.

Wow...I got rave reviews from the family for this one.  It was very yummy, not hard and my husband called his dad over and told him to bring a container so we could send him home with some.  My mother-in-law called soon raving about how delicious it was!  She said it was the best she had ever had.  Recently she said she had tried some at a restaurant and was so disappointed that she probably wouldn't order it again.  This was a fabulous recipe!  Now, if I could just get it to taste as yummy and cut out some fat........

This recipe is excellent! I used red potatoes, and I added some extra clams because one can never have too many clams... I think I will use part milk though next time to eliminate some calories, but as is the recipe is great!

OMG fabulous! This is sooo good I could lick the pot! LOL I made this almost exactly like the recipe. Here are my changes. I did not have red wine vinegar so I used white. I sautéed my veggies in the grease of 2 pieces of bacon then added the potatoes and all clam juice plus 1 8oz bottle, 2 cups half and half and 2 cups 1% milk. Used 2 cans baby clams and 1 minced clams. This was the best ever!

This is a fantastic recipe. I always read the reviews, and always use other suggestions to make it taste just right. I used cornstarch instead of flour, and used all 1/2 & 1/2. The bacon is a must, and I left out the carrots. I used 5 cans of chopped clams, and 3 cups of potatoes. The red wine vinegar is perfect, and I also added Old Bay spice for a chowder that everyone raved about!! Great job...Thank you.

Both my fiance and I loved this recipe.  It had good flavor and was easy to make.  To save a bit on calories I used a pint of 2% milk and a pint half and half (vs. the whole quart).  I also used about 1/2 the amount of butter.  Even with the changes everything tasted great!  Thanks for sharing!

Aside from it not being very clammy tasting it's fantastic. I did not want an overwhelming clam taste but I was really surprised you could barely taste clam and I used an extra can of chopped clams. I also added bacon like the reviews suggested and used fat free half an half by my own choice to lighten it up. Same creamy taste, tons less fat. Awesome recipe. A total keeper!

Fantastic soup.  Even my kids loved it.  Definitely NOT a low fat meal though.  I used less half and half and added some 1% milk instead.  Also used less butter and added olive oil instead.  But the taste is fantastic and it's easy to make.  Definitely a keeper.

Okay, so I have made this like 20 times now...so I figured I better rate it.  I love it.  My husband loves it, our friends love it and my Dad who is super picky Clam Chowder lover really liked it.  You can make it thinner by using a little chicken broth and less half and half, but whatever you choose it is sooo good.  Thank you!

I'm giving this 4 stars for now because I want to change a few things next time and then it might be perfect.  I will definitely use all clam juice next time rather than water.  And will add one extra can of clams (I used chopped, not minced).  I cooked up 3 slices of bacon and sauteed the onion, carrot and celery in the bacon fat for just a few minutes. I also used cider vinegar b/c I didn't have any red wine vinegar...I was super nervous about adding the vinegar b/c it seemed weird, but it worked!

The taste and texture of the soup is awesome. On the other hand, I'm not a huge celery fan, so I will cut that down to half a cup, and add more potatoes  next time.

This is really good! Perfect flavor! I did use bacon and added the butter to the pan after so it would get the bacon flavor and I used non cooked clam meat. I boiled it until tender (about 15 minutes) and used the juice on the rest of the recipe... Minced it in the food processor before adding... I have a thing against canned stuff and it was actually a lot cheaper and better!

Love this recipe. It was my first time trying to make clam chowder soup. I did make sum minor changes though instead of making a homemade cream, I subsituted it with cream of mushroom soup...All I have to say is that it came out better than progessive or cambell soup, and it was quicker. Thanks

I've made this recipe many times and it never gets old. I also fry bacon (added later) and then saute the onion and celery in the bacon fat in the soup pot. I add a bottle of clam juice plus the drained juice from the canned clams to the liquid. I also add some Old Bay and garlic powder to the mix. I let the mixture cook sometimes for a few hours then thicken with a cornstarch/broth mixture. I know I have changed the original recipe, but in my opinion, what makes this recipe a 5 star on its own for the submitter is the quart of half and half and the red wine vinegar which are the magic ingredients. Also, adding the clams right before serving time is essential so they remain tender. Truly delicious restaurant quality soup. The entire pot is gone in 2 days. Thank you.

I used 2 tablespoons of reserved bacon fat to lightly sauté the celery, carrots, onion and potatoes before adding. This chowder is so delicious and works well with clams and other seafoods. I add scallops and lump crab to make it a seafood chowder instead sometimes. Lightly sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley or dill once plated for a fabulous presentation and enhanced flavor. I do also add superfine crushed garlic or garlic paste occasionally which I like, but if its for the kids, they prefer no garlic.

Very good. But not what I was hoping for. It didn't really taste like clam chowder from a nice restaurant, like I was hoping. I think I will leave out the bacon next time. Mine was VERY bacony! It was hard to taste the clams, in fact, my husband said he couldn't tell they were even in there. :(   It WAS a very good soup though! We enjoyed it, but very HEAVY. I ate half a bowl and I felt like I had ate 2 full ones.  Changes from others suggestions: Added the bacon and grease, used cornstarch instead of flour (1/4 cup) and added drained corn kernels instead of the other veggies. I also used clam juice instead of water.  Also, it makes a LOT, I took leftovers to the inlaws. :)

Wow, what a great chowder! Being a New England girl, my taste buds sure do love a nice hot bowl of thick, creamy chowder, and boy did this recipe deliver! I left out the carrots and added extra potatoes. I also steamed up some fresh little neck clams, instead of canned, then roughly chopped them for a chunkier soup. I used the liquid from the steamed clams for a little extra flavor. The vinegar also worked wonderfully in this. It really brings it all together! Thank you for such a lovely recipe!

Excellent recipe.   I read the reviews and did the following.  I purchased OM bacon crumbles, 2 jars of clam juice, and 2 cans of diced potatoes... I just added the onions, carrots, and celery to the skillet as per the directions and then sprinkled 1/2 of the bacon crumbs on top and poured the clam juice to cover all - I did not use water.  I also have made this recipe using corn starch instead of the flour - I find that it is a creamier texture... I add the potatoes in toward the end since they just need to heat through and then add the clams... the vinegar is a must. Top with the remaining 1/2 of the bacon crumbles... FABULOUS with crusty french rolls.  MMmmm good!

The red wine vinegar really gives this  a yummy twist.  I used 1% milk instead of cream to cut down on calories and neither I nor my husband could tell the difference.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this. Simple to prepare and delicious. I left out the onions and used onion powder instead. If you add 1 extra can of clams, it pretty much is a perfect recipe.

The name says it all - "My BEST Clam Chowder".  It's fabulous!  I use milk instead of cream (to cut the fat) and thin it a little with a bottle of clam juice.

This was pretty good. Like others, I used all clam juice, no water, & I rendered 3 slices of bacon and used the grease to saute the veggies, omitting the carrots (I've never had carrots in my clam chowder before)  This added a ton of flavor.  The vinegar is definitely what makes this recipe!  It instantly changed from potato soup to a classic flavored clam chowder.  I love rich, creamy recipes, but the half and half was WAY too thick & creamy for this one.  I mixed 2% milk into my bowl and it was then perfect.  I will use 4 cups 2% milk and .5 cup cream next time.  Throw the crumbled bacon in at the end, even if it's not "classic" clam chowder fodder, it's too good to waste!

This clam chowder recipe is delicious, but there is no need to pack in all of those calories.  I followed the recipe closely, except I used 5 cans of clams, omitted the butter altogether and used all skim milk in place of the half and half.  To create the desired thickness, I simply added 3 teaspoons of corn starch.  At the end the red wine vinegar and some fresh chopped cilantro really gave an awesome tasty touch!!  Hubby loved it, will make this again!

Delicious!  I used 1/2 stick butter, 1/2 c. flour, and lowfat half and half to make it healthier.  I also used 4 cans of chopped clams.  Thanks for the recipe.  It has been a huge hit every time.

A good place to start but needs some modifications... bacon being the most important. I fry up some bacon and then add the onions to cook in the bacon grease. I always find that I have to drain off some of the liquid the potatoes are boiled in to get the right consistency, so I wait until the end to add the clam juice.

This is really great clam chowder.  I took someone's suggestion and added bacon.  The vinegar gives it such a good flavor.  Warning:  It makes enough to feed an army.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.

This recipe is so similar to the one I have been using for years. I must admit I like the addition of the vinegar. I left out the carrots but added a few things from my recipe like thyme, a sprinkle of dried dill weed and Old Bay seasoning. I also cut down the fat by using fat free half & half and also using 2% milk. I cooked the veggies down in some clam juice instead of bacon grease. I use Turkey bacon fried really crisp to crumble on top. Living so close to the ocean, we have several Seafood Markets around so it's great to be able to make Clam Chowder with fresh whole baby clams added at the last moment before serving. A splash of hot sauce is just the thing to set it off just right!!

Used chopped clams instead of diced.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and by cooking the veggies in bacon fat.  The chowder was so delicious.  I will be making this again.

This was the best Clam Chowder I've ever made. I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 however because I changed it a little. I left out the carrots because I don't like carrots in my chowder & I added extra red wine vinegar & some Old Bay seasoning. This gave it the extra flavor it needed. Other than those things it's a great recipe & I will be making it again, hubby loved it too.

This is an excellent recipe! However, for those of you looking for that extra "hmmm?' thing, it's THYME and WHITE PEPPER.  I also finely GRATE a carrot rather than dice and sprinkle in some chopped fresh parsley just before serving.  There it is.. that little extra "IT" factor that gives the restaurant flare, but that's missing the point, this is HOMEMADE chowder and it's supposed to be your own pride and joy, not something you paid somebody else to make for you. ;)

I did add bacon to this recipe, but even without it, this was good stuff!! The vinegar really adds that extra kick to make a flavorful soup. This tasted like the chowder I used to get in San Francisco. I served it in sourdough bread bowls and my husband inhaled his first serving and went for seconds! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We love this soup and make it a couple times a month. The red wine vinegar at the end is essential. Our only substitution is using 2% milk instead of the half and half, which changes the consistency, but the flavor is still almost as good. Do not be tempted to use skim milk; it doesn't work out well. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Very good recipe!  And very easy.  I followed the directions with only a few minor changes.
I left out the carrots (personal preference), I used the bacon grease idea, used 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of half and half (I did add a little more milk later, just to thin it down a little), and I added an extra can of clams.  Everything else was the same.
Would highly recommend this easy and delicious recipe.

Great with the bacon grease to saute the veggies in!  I used real clams, cleaned and steamed in a garlic wine sauce, then chopped and added last to soup.  I added more milk when I reheated it, and even froze some and it was great.

I made the mistake of letting it boil and the soup got super thick.  I tasted it just before it got thick and it seemed like it would have been a good soup.  I will make it again and be more careful next time!

This recipe is delicious. The first time I made it all I had was heavy cream so I used that.  Talk about fatty and rich.  It was the most delicious.

This really was super yummy.  I made it just as written plus added some Old Bay Seasoning (had too being from the Eastern Shore of MD).  Everyone (husband and 3 kids) all had nothing but compliments.  That deserves 6 stars!!

This was delicious! Better than any restaurant chowder. Only complaint was it was more of a stew,very thick.  I will add some milk next time. I cut recipe in half and followed exactly except 2 cans of clams with juice and filled one can with water (while clams still in it) which was enough to cover the veggies. Amazing how the red wine vinegar made the flavor pop. I did add 1/4 tsp dill with the S&P for another kick. IMHO Leave the bacon and drippings for your corn chowder!

Delicious!  I personally don't love clam chowder, but my husband does and he thought this recipe was great.  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and used 6 slices of bacon and thinned this recipe out a little by using half milk and half cream.  Still not healthy, but stellar recipe!

Well, I am really not sure how to rate this one. I have lived in New England my entire life so I think I expected this to be the type of chowder we have around here. It was a very basic recipe, but the taste just didn't do it for me. It was thick & creamy, but didn't taste very much like anything but cream & butter. I missed the clam taste that I am used to from the chowders around here. So, I may make this again but I would add more clam juice and maybe cut back on the half & half a little. I did add bacon to my chowder but left out the carrots, because carrots in chowder just seemed a little odd to me.

I live in Santa Cruz California, and have tried clam chowders from up and down the west coast, this rivaled any chowder I have eaten anywhere.  I did make a few changes.  First I cut up four thick slices of bacon and fried them up adding the potatoes a few minutes before the vegis and clam juice.  I replaced water with more clam juice, to cover the vegis, and left out the carrots.  I also switched flour with corn starch.  I used one pint half and half, and one pint heavy whipping cream.  Next time I might use just a quart of heavy whipping cream.  I can't wait to try it again, next time I am going to make some home made sour dough bread bowls, instead of store bought ones.

I tried several recipes for many different kinds of chowder and this was the absolute best!  I did what others suggested and browned some bacon before adding the onions and celery and to cut fat and calories I used equal parts of 2% milk and half and half...turned out perfect!  Be sure to add the vinegar...it really does make the flavors sparkle!

I just made this recipe and loved it.  I used corn starch in place of the flour because I like my chowders to be thick.  I used extra clam juice to cover the veggies in place of water and also used an extra can of clams.  The bacon added a nice flavor.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

It really was very good.  I added an extra can of clams, cooked bacon first and used the fat and clam juice to cook the veggies.  Substituted corn starch for flour - added Creole and Old Bay spices - put clams in at the same time I did the seasoning.  Came out DELICIOUS!!!  Will def. make again.

Perfect recipe!
Usually I dont really follow instructions and I am not used to such accurate measures (like 3/4 tsp), but I did it for this clam chowder (OK I added parsley) and it is a big success!
I like this one a lot and it is going right into the classic ones... and it will be be also "My Best Clam Chowder" ;) 
Thanks!

This was the best clam chowder I've ever had. Everyone loved it. I did what a lot of other people did and browned some bacon, mixing the fat in along with the vegetables. I did not include the carrots since I've never really seen carrots in clam chowder. The red wine vinegar added a whole new level of flavor that was evident the moment I poured it into the pot. I also added a dash of onion and garlic powder. Oh, and I did not have half and half so I ended up using heavy cream. This without a doubt made the chowder extremely fatty and rich, but it did not take away from the flavor. However, next time I will be using half and half.

For my husband and I clam digging is a ritual, so he was always attempting some clam chowder recipe or another.  I used this recipe, with the slight tweaking - clam juice instead of water, corn starch instead of flour as others mentioned, and of course fresh razor clams.  Now it is the only recipe used in our house!  Well done!  Thanks for all of the tips too!

This was awesome!! I read a lot of the reviews and modified the recipe also. I used an extra can of clams, added bacon and used a bottle of clam juice.  I also used fat free milk and cornstarch instead of flour.  I was very surprised at how good this was. My kids LOVED it and want it in their thermos tomorrow for lunch at school.

Revised review today so I do not have to keep giving out the recipe:
I have perfected this recipe with suggestions and use a crock pot to simmer. If you are not worried about calories, as we make this every Christmas Eve; here is my modifications. 
Cook the bacon on low, saving the bacon grease,
Saute the onions in butter and garlic,
Add the bacon and a little grease, and the clam juice from the cans, with the veggies for 15 minutes on low to medium, depending on your stove.
In another pan, melt the butter and whisk 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 corn starch,
add 1/2 quart of half and half and 1/2 quart whipping cream,
place the veggies and bacon(everything from the other pan) in crock pot and pour the sauce over the veggies. You may need to add a little half and half or whipping cream as desired while simmering.
Allow to simmer in crock pot on low for two hours (check veggies to know when ready); adding the following ingredients for taste:
1. 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning,
white pepper and black pepper to taste,
a little thyme to taste,
a little more garlic-just a little,
a little garlic salt -(avoid regular salt) very little is too much,
a little onion salt,
add key ingredient-liquid smoke to taste (use carefully, start with a little, let simmer, check later, add more if needed, for desired taste).
*If you do not like the taste, add a little more whipping cream.
In two hours, when you are ready to eat, add the clams and add the red wine vinaigrette to taste . You will know when

I made this chowder for my boyfriend (who LOVED it) and a get together at my sister's house.  Everyone went for seconds, and the pot was scraped clean!
I added a couple of things though.  I added 5 strips of crumbled bacon, and 5 cans of clams. Very good!

Pretty darn good. This was my first time making a chowder, so I was impressed though my New Englander boyfriend was not. I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I didn't add carrots, I added corn. Oh, and a dash of Tabasco, 'cause it's tasty.

I agree with the other reviews that stated there was not quite enough clam flavor, but this is pretty easily fixed. I plan on adding an add'l can of clams next time (and also a tad more salt). My husband made this soup a 5 star by putting cognac on the table and adding a splash for an incredible finishing touch. Both my husband and our Russian guest said this was the best clam chowder they'd ever had! Allrecipes.com makes me look good yet again!

I made this for a chowder cook-off and it got rave reviews.  I didn't stray from the recipe at all and it was perfect!  I will definitely make this again and again and again...

Very good chowder!  Although ... and this is hardly a criticism (more a caution) ... I really don't think this stuff would be hurt if you substituted whole milk for at least some of the half-and-half.  I doubled the recipe (for my weekly lunch-at-the-office supply) and it just felt WRONG dumping that half-gallon of half-and-half into the pot!  I also doubled (or tripled) the amount of clams and clam juice.  Glad I did that, because the clam flavor seems to have a hard time getting through the cream....

(Guilty) yum....

My, oh my!  This was awesome!  My family devours this each time I make it.  I have to wonder if maybe some of the reviewers who stated that it was bland and needed more clam flavor noticed that you cook the veggies in the drained clam juice?  We had no problems tasting the flavors.  Also, if you cook the flour for about a minute or so before stirring in the cream, you shouldn't be able to taste the flour.  I did leave out the carrots just because that's not something that we associate with clam chowder.  Also, if you're in a hurry or out of potatoes (like I was), I found that frozen Ore-Ida O'Brien potatoes make a great substitution.  Just don't cook them too long or they will turn to mush.

This was excellent, only changes were a bit of Old Bay Seasoning added in and I replaced the flour with 1/3 cup corn starch.  Will make again and again!!

I have to admit, I was a little hesitant about making this recipe.
But after tasting the finished product, I completely changed my mind!!

It tasted great!  

The only thing I will change for next time is a little less flour.  I would cut it to only 1/2 C.  I hope this doesn't change its thick consistancy.  I tasted a little bit of flour in it.  Could be that I need to add more salt/pepper.

My husband absolutely loved it as well, and wants me to make more ASAP!!

Thank you for this recipe!!!

This soup was delicious! I used many of the tips from other reviews and it made a great soup! I uesd 2 cans of clams and a dozen fresh clams. I also added a jar of clam juice to thin it out a little and add some more flavor. Will definitely use a few more veggies next time! Thanks!

Loved it, the best chowder I have ever made. I only had 2 cans of clams so would add that third next time. I also did 4 cups of potatoes and used 1 pint of half and half and 1.5 cups of milk. Also no carrots and used only 2 stalks of celery as that is what I had on hand. I made some sweet dinner rolls from this website to go with the chowder-yummy!!

I sauted the onions and celery in 2T Butter. When transparent I added 6 slices chopped cooked bacon.  Add chopped potatoes and then drained 5 cans of chopped clams into pot.  We love clams!  Added 2 bottles of clam juice to cover and cooked on medium till potatoes are cooked.  I only used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup of butter to make roux.  Did not add vinegar or carrots.

This is the best clam chowder I have ever had. It's thick, creamy and full of flavor. I added one more can of clams and omitted the vinegar, as I don't like the flavor. It was absolutely delicious. Hubby ate it up.

A very yummy and rich clam chowder.  Unfortunately I didn't cook the veggies enough so they were a little crunchy even though the potatoes were soft.  As a leftover, I thinned the soup with 1% milk before microwaving because it was pretty stiff coming out of the refrigerator.  Will make again.

This recipe would have been 5 stars, because it tasted delicious-- until I added the vinegar. Next time I'll leave the vinegar out, and it will be perfect.

Delicious! I like it with 1 more cup of potatoe added, however my son thinks it is perfect as written.  Had to thin a little with some milk (I only like thick chowder but mine turned out just a little too thick).  A hit with the whole family my sister even asked for the recipe. Similar to the chowder I get at my favorite Oregon coast restaurant.

This is so good. I did not put carrots in, I added more potatoes instead. 5 cans of chopped clams is just the right amount. This is restuarant quality. Thanks!

I made half of the recipe. Used 3 cans of chopped clams(didnt have minced in store) and used all the juice. I also sautee the onions in the butter, which I reduced by half. Instead of half&half I used half regular milk and half soy milk, which has nice creamy consistency and lower calories and substituted flour with cornstarch.We loved it.

Excellent! I made it following the recipe exactly. It was a little too rich for my family.  Next time I'll use 1/2 milk and 1/2 half-and-half.  I will also add some clam juice instead of water. Thank you!

Really, really, really good chowder!  Very thick, rich, and hearty.  I followed the recipe exactly except for two minor changes: I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk (I guess I used more of the 1/2 and 1/2 in my coffee than I realized!) and I added one can of tiny shrimp (I had clam chowder with shrimp in Newport, OR and decided all clam chowder should be made that way).  The red wine vinegar absolutely makes this recipe!  Hubby  (who is a clam chowder connoissuer) says this recipe is a keeper for sure!

This is by far the best comfort food yet!  My husband actually treated me to a night off and he made this for dinner tonight using five cans of clams as suggested by other reviewers.  This chowder followed by a glass of wine, a Lazy Boy recliner and a movie is the ultimate evening!  I can't rate this chowder high enough!

this recipe was so phenomenal.  I did use half milk instead of half and half, and it was still really creamy.  I forgot the carrots and the vinegar, and it was the best clam chowder I have ever had.  Also, I used whole wheat flower (trying to be healthy), and I really think it enhanced the creaminess of the soup.

GREAT! I tweaked it up just a little bit.  I followed the other suggestions and used clam juice in place of the water to cook the veggies. Also... I reduced the butter to 1/2 cu, BUT tossed in a few T. of bacon grease from breakfast. I used a 1/2 QT FAT FREE half and half, and a 1/2 QT 2% milk (instead of ALL half and half). I added 1 t. Kosher salt, and 1 t. Johnny's Seafood Seasoning. 
Very smooth...very good!

I have used this recipe for years now.  I found it one day when I tried to call my mom and get her recipe but she wasn't home.  I thought I would try this recipe and I loved it!  I do cut the clams down to two cans and by now, I really don't measure the veggies.  I always add more potatoes!  This is a great recipe!

I followed the exact recipe and we thought the chowder was just okay. It was more like a thick potato soup recipe, because it really lacked the good clam flavor. If you grew up on SF chowder than you will need to add quite a bit to this recipe to match it. However, it was very easy!

This was an okay recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out ok, but a little bland. I added some more salt and more vinegar and it seemed to help. May be better the next day.

I am not the best cook...which is why this easy recipe appealed to me. I still managed to mess up! But, it came out soooo great! Thanks!

My husband and I love this recipe.  Its a bit of work to chop everything up, but worth it in the end.  I make it exactly as listed, but don't always measure the veggies precisely.  This is a regular winter meal for us with a fresh loaf of bread.  Yummy!

Wow!  This clam chowder was sooo good!!  It was the best I've had in my entire life.  I didn't have any carrots in the house so I omitted those, but I had never had carrots in clam chowder before so wasn't disappointed.  I will make this soup again.  My whole family loved it.

WOW!!!!  I have to admit this was the best clam chowder I have ever made.  I decreased the butter to 1/2 cup, used 1% milk and added a dash of nutmeg.  I'm always in a rush--so after cutting the onions, celery and carrots with my Borner slicer, fast easy and wonderful, I just added hash browns (the cubed kind, not the grated) to the vegetables for the last minute or two and then added it all to the soup.  So fast, easy and clean.  I will definately make this chowder again!!!  Even my picky eaters loved it and my husband had to fight with the teenage boys for the left-overs.

The HusbandUnit RAVED about this one!  Changes I made:  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used a bottle of clam juice to simmer the veggies in.  Along with the red wine vinegar to finish, I used a few drops of hot sauce (Tabasco) and a few drops of Worchesteshire.  Ultra-creamy and SUPER easy to make!

I made this chowder twice before, and it is the best.  I use diced green pepper instead of celery.  I also substitute half of the half-n-half with 2% milk and it is still super rich and creamy.  I have not used the red wine vinegar yet - I forget.  Time to make it again!

WOW!!! This is good stuff! I have never made clam chowder before and like other users I added a little bacon and used clam juice instead of water. I too was a little skeptical about the vinegar but it is truly the "secret ingredient" that pulls all the flavors together in the end! Very good recipe, fit for company! Thanks for sharing!

This is a fabulous clam chowder!  I, too, was dubious about the vinegar but went for it and it did seem to perk up the flavor without tasting vinegary.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very very rich.  Maybe too rich for a main dish, but perfect for a side.  As a main dish, next time I'll use half milk instead of a whole quart of half&half.

I used white pepper, the taste doesn't change but the chowder looks a pretty creamy color also before serving I added some bay shrimp and my family loved it. Also I cook the flour and butter about 3 minutes before I add the half and half.

This was pretty easy to make and tasted very good.
I was afraid of the vinegar... used most of it, but not all of it.  I could still taste it in the soup (good flavor) but I'd still be afraid to add all of it.  I will make it again this winter!

This was OK.  It didn't have as much flavor as I would like however.  I was looking for a clam chowder taste simalar to the one you would find at the Fisherman's Warf in San Francisco.  This definatley wasn't it.

This was very good.  The red wine vinegar really does the trick!  I did what other reviewers suggested and cooked bacon and then sauted the veggies in the grease for a short time.  We love bacon so everyone loved the flavor of the crumbled bacon on the top.

HMMMMMM GOOD! I couldn't remember what type of dairy the recipe called for so, i picked up "light cream" and "heavy cream". Boy was it good! I made this for my husband who loves clam chowder (i never had it before this recipe). By the time he got to it, there was only one bowl left. Even my 3 year old liked it. 

He loves clams, so he said to add more next time. I think i cut up the vegs to big, because he said " I didn't know carrots and celery where in clam chowder" maybe i should have made them really small? What is the recommened size for vegs in this soup?

Simply outstanding!  So easy to make for the results you get.  I followed fellow reviewers' suggestions and got 5 cans of clams, and used bacon (which I love in everything anyway!).  Next time, I'll leave out the celery and throw in some corn.  I've always been leery of making clam chowder because it seemed like such a daunting task, but thank goodness for finding this recipe...I'll always be making this from now on instead of eating the canned stuff!

(imagine that)  This recipe is definatly a keeper.  Thanks so much sharon.

Overall I was happy with the results.The chowder was rich and creamy.  I sauted some bacon before melting the butter. Next time I would saute the onions too.  I thought it could have used more of a clam flavor, next time I would add more clams.  I added too much water when I was simmering the vegetables, I think you could have used extra clam juice instead of water.

This is the best clam chowder I have ever had. My husband loved it too. This recipe didn't call for spices, which was dissapointing. I love spices so I added thyme leaves, bay leaves, and california garlic. I have to have garlic! It was wonderful. The vinegar was definately the final touch.

This was outstanding!  First time at making clam chowder, and it was such a hit.  I followed some of the other reviews and added 5 cans of clams, and used 2c skim milk and 2c half and half to cut down on the fat.  So delicious and rich!  Thanks!

This soup was fabulous!! My husband asked me to
make more the next day!  We don't like carrots, so
I left them out and added 4 pieces of cooked, diced bacon. The flavor was great...thank you!

Great recipe! I altered it a little. To cut some of the fat and calories I used 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups of fat free milk. I also made the roux with 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup flour. It was still very rich and creamy. I added more clams too, yum!

I'm from Pontiac, Michigan...not exactly the Clam Chowder capitol of the world.  Actually I'd never had chowder, I found the recipe for my chowder-loving wife.  And, WOW!  I love this stuff, any kind of chowder sounded bad to me until I had my first bite of this.  Smooth, creamy, fresh and filling.  The perfect meal for a rainy/snowy day.  Perfect as is!

This recipe is to die for.  We just came back from Cape Cod and after eating chowder all vacation, we had a huge craving for it when we came home.  I found this recipe and tried it. WOW! it was so creamy and delicious.  I gave some to several of my neighbors and everyone agreed it was the best they ever tasted.  Thanks!

Delicious! I used 2 cups of half-and-half and 2 cups of skim milk to cut down on the fat.  I thought it might taste a little thin, but it was still great! Lots of chopping and peeling, but it was well worth the effort. My boyfriend, the New England clam chowder afficianado, rated it with the best he's ever had.

This was a great clam chowder.  I added 4 cans of chopped clams instead of 3 minced.  I also didn't add as many potatoes.  It turned out great!!

The chowder was very thick when I served it and got even thicker as it cooled. Next time I'll use 1/2 cup flour and add another can of clams. My Husband & I thought it was pretty good!

This was great!!  My husband, the clam chowder critic, says it is the best he has had.  I added a little corn starch to thicken a little more because he loves it really thick.  Great with sourdough bread.  It makes a ton but I hear no complaints about having to eat leftovers!

I thought it was delicious.  I used 3 cans of chopped clams and 2 cans of baby clams. I think more clams in a chowder is better. I did not use carrots. I used clam juice instead of water. My changes were just personal preferences.

Love this recipe. I reduced the flour and butter to 1/2 c. each. I put in 3/4 c. chopped onion and  then added 1/4 c green onions when I added the clams. I added a little garlic (1/2 tsp or less) and thyme and a couple bay leaves. I did not use red wine vinegar.

Excellent chowder but I much prefer adding a little cream sherry instead of the vinegar and top it with a little crispy bacon and green onion or chives

Took some advice from other reviewers. I cooked 6 pieces of back until crisp in a large skillet. I then sauteed all the veggies in that grease and the in a small minced clove of garlic before adding the clam juice. I had two 10oz cans of baby whole clams, so I used the clam liquid from the cans and one 8oz bottle instead of the water. The only other change was to add the crumbled bacon in right before serving and add a little extra seasoning including a little thyme.

Lactose intolerant version. My husband is lactose intolerant. I used fewer carrots to balance  the sweetness lactose free milk has. I also used a smart balance butter substitute and oil for the roux (1/2 of each).  Used a little bacon grease per other recommendations . Absolutely delicious!

Everyone loved the chowder.  I used 4 cups diced potatoes with the skins on, 4 carrots, 6 cans of chopped clams and 1 bottle of clam juice (instead of water).  I also used bacon grease as others suggested, but I did not add the bacon to the chowder.  I reduced the salt from 1 1/2 teaspoons to 1/2 teaspoon.  I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great.

I've made this recipe and variations of it many times. I love it and always get compliments on how great it is! If you like yours a little brothier, I like to add a jar of clam juice.

My family loves this chowder. The only change I now make is to use bottled clam juice instead of water. Make sure to add the red wine vinegar. It sets it off.

The changes I made were I exchanged one whole clam can for 1 minced can and I’d probably use a little vegetable broth and less half and half next time, for more fluid. It was very thick, which I enjoy, but if you need to save for next day, then it becomes too thick, almost!

This was my first time making this recipe and I followed all the directions as written.  My family loved it.  It was very creamy and quite tasty.  I found it was too thick for my taste as it was quite thick. I will make it again because it was a hit.  The next time I will probably use half the flour so it will not be as thick. A winner!

This is by far one of the best clam chowders I’ve ever tasted and I’ve had clam chowder up down both coasts. Simply follow the recipe but brown some bacon before hand, add the veggies to bacon fat, and then continue with the normal recipe. Throw the chopped bacon in the soup and keep some for a topper. I stole this from a few other reviewers and it makes a world of difference. Plus I only add one can of minced clam, the other 2 are chopped. Bigger better flavor

Been using this recipe for years. It's the best. I always double the recipe and make two modifications. First I buy a 51 oz can of clams, 23 oz clams the remainder clam juice. Second I buy a 1# jar of clam base  and add it as needed to boast the flavor. Do not add salt as the base is salty.
PS Costco sells the clams in a 2/ pack.

Absolutely delicious as written.  And absolutely delicious with a few changes.
1.  fry up some bacon and drain, retaining the fat in the pot.
2. saute onion, garlic, celery and potatoes for a couple of minutes.
3.  Cover with clam juice and simmer until potatoes are al dente.  About 10-15 minutes.
4.  Add salt, pepper, Old Bay, a few drops of Liquid Smoke, and 1tbsp red wine vinegar.
5.  In a separate pot, melt 1 stick of butter...whisk in 1/2 c. flour. Stir constantly for about 5 minutes.
6.  Add about 4 c. 1/2 and half.  Continue whisking until thickened.
7.  Add the cream sauce to the onion/garlic/celery/ clam juice.
8.  Stir.
Add clams and crumbled bacon and simmer for about 2 minutes.
Correct seasonings.
Add parsley.
Turn off your stove.  You're done.

Just finished eating.  We're all full!!!  So delicious.  I followed the recipe as it was written (I have never made it before...didn't even know if I'd like clam chowder.  IT's a favorite of my wife, but I had never tried it). Highly recommend.

Really really good! Spouse says better than San Francisco Wharf! I used a little chicken broth, instead of water, to cover vegetables.

We made this chowder along with homemade French bread for Christmas Eve and thought it was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to add an extra can of clams along with clam juice over the vegetables as was suggested by others.

My first time making clam chowder and like many others, I used 4 slices of bacon, reserving the bacon grease to add to the total amount of butter needed. I used 4 cans of clams (2 minced and 2 chopped). Then with the addition of one bottle of clam juice, there is no need for water. Pretty easy recipe to prepare. Will definitely make it again. Thanks!

This recipe is a keeper.  The local grocer had 6.5oz cans of minced clams 2 for $4.00 so I used 4 cans instead of 3.  Instead of adding water to cover the vegetables I added an 8oz bottle of clam juice.  Was afraid that the 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar might over power, so I reduced it to one.  Very tasty!

It may have been new user error but this was a very watered down recipe.  I felt like I was drinking half and half versus enjoying clam chowder.  Definitely won’t use half and half next time.  A heavier cream makes more sense

Best clam chowder I ever made, instead of adding water to the clam juice to cook the vegetables, I added better than bouillon to the water clam flavor of course. “Fantastic”.

I substituted ham for the clams this time, water for the clam juice, and apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar. Still delicious.  I was using what was on hand.  Made 1/2 recipe.
I’d make it both ways again.

It was okay - it tasted like too much flour, too much cream, too much butter - just overloaded with richness.  Plus, it's missing bacon.  Not enough clam flavor because it was overwhelmed with flour and cream.  I had to add two more cans of clams, which helped, but it still wasn't great.

Too much flour. I made it exactly. Then I started doctoring it to try to overcome the flour flavor. Adding a cup of milk and double the red wine vinegar helped a lot along with more butter. It also tastes better served over white toast. This is definitely not what I’m looking for. Will keep searching for a flourless recipe.

It was delicious, I would only use less clam juice to have more of that creamy flavor to it. I also added bacon to mines, and used the bacon fat instead of the butter

I used vegetable broth instead of water to cook the vegetables. Like a lot of reviews, I cooked bacon to top off the chowder and used the drippings along with the butter for the roux. Good, but turned too thick for my taste. Next time I'd cut back or cut out the flour and add more clams.

I made all the changes Crystal S Recommended. I also added a tablespoon of Loaded Potato Soup mix.  A day later is was so thick I added another 2 cups of water. Still tasted fine.

Made this just as directed, and we enjoyed it. I'm keeping this recipe, but next time I will sub clam juice for the water and add a touch of old bay seasoning for a deeper flavor.

This was really good. I definitely would add more clams as a personal preference and I added 6 strips of bacon and the bacon grease while cooking the carrots, celery and onion.

Very good! Used minced and chopped clams as suggested and 6 strips of bacon. Could have used a little more clam flavor. Next time I will use additional clam juice.

Excellent recipe with a few small modifications (and good suggestions by other reviewers):
+ 6 strips of bacon & bacon grease
+ Onion powder
+ Old Bay seasoning
Reduce amount of half and half by 50% and replace with milk.

The only augmentations I made was using gluten-free all purpose flour and I didn't use the vinegar. I was all done with the pot, & had already served it up to my family, I looked over by the sink and there was the vinegar sitting there waiting to be used little teardrops in its eyes. But this was still super yummy even though I'm a dum-dumb.

Personally I felt this had WAY too much half-and-half. I wish I had seen the reviews that said to use milk. I think about 2 cups of the cream mixture added it to the veggie/clam mixture would be delicious. As is, I felt like I was eating cream.

Made this today but only had whole wheat flour, which was not ideal. So I took another person's tip and added bacon (and some of the grease!) and it definitely helped.

The chowder is fine except that it requires so much thickener. Many people think a spoon needs to stand up straight in a bowl of real New England clam (or fish) chowder. Please, cut out (or cut way back) on the flour. "Thick" chowder is for tourists.  Real New Englanders think the starch from the potatoes will be thickener enough, or maybe just a little flour, or even better,  just a little corn starch for a gluten-free version.

I make this in my instant pot with the following modifications: I do cut up about 12 strips of bacon and sautee first (sautee mode) - remove those and put in a bowl to drain on paper towel then double up the veggies (carrots, onion and celery) and sautee those in the bacon grease until slightly softened.  Add the clam juice from six cans (doubled that part too) to the veggies and deglaze the pot.  Add the potatoes and add just enough water to cover (about 2 cups of water in my 6 qt pot).  Set to manual (pressure cook) for 8 minutes then do a quick release.  While it's cooking I make the roux but I do NOT double the roux - it's plenty thick enough made per the recipe.  Once the pin drops on the Instant Pot I slowly add the roux, the salt and pepper (to taste) and vinegar then the claims.  It cuts down on cooking time overall and is so good!

I tried making this for the first time and it came out great!! The cooking process is very simple and straight forward! Easy process, just be careful not to make the butter hot or throw vegetables into hot oil directly!

My father and older brother loved the smell and taste! I'm definately making this again!

This was fantastic. Used bacon first as suggested. Corn starch instead of flour. Shallots in place of onions. Tasted it and it was good, then added the red wine vinegar and that took it over the top. Will be a staple for this fall and winter.

I changed a bit with this one, and WOW I think this is a new favourite.  Heats up really well for a couple of days so its great for meal prep if that's your thing.  
-Milk instead of cream
-3 cans of baby clams and juice instead of two
-Sub Red Wine Vinegar for 2 Red Wine Iced Cubes m(1/4c total?)
-Added 2 TSP dry mustard and a whack of black pepper
Added a cob's worth of sweet corn

I changed a few things. I used no fat half and half instead  and half the amount of butter. I also used the leaves of the celery stalks while simmering the vegetables. Only used clam juice. No water or wine. 
Came out fantastic!

I cooked the four chopped vegetables down a bit with 2T of the 12T butter needed for the entire recipe, then added the clam juice/water.  Next time I'll add 1/2 cup white wine as well (or vermouth.)
I'm also going to add fresh thyme and perhaps a bay leaf. An excellent recipe; it's going into the regular rotation!

This was very good. I did make one change...instead two cans of minced clams, one of the cans I used was a 10oz whole claims. It was delicious, next time I make it I'll use two cans of 10oz whole claims. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe is the absolute best.  My entire family loves clam chowder and we all agreed that it is some of the very best we have ever made.  I added sautéed bacon, fresh thyme and bayleaf and used chicken broth instead of water.  I still felt like it was a little flat on seasoning, so I also added a chowder spice base and a little red pepper flakes and it gave it just the punch it needed.  It is a very thick recipe, so for our own personal taste/thickness, I added more chicken broth at the end.  Great recipe, you will love it!

Excellent chowder. Will def make again. I didn’t add any water, just used the clam juice. The clam juice was enough because I placed the celery, carrot and a leek in the food processor to mince it well. I left the potato’s as thin slices. I added bay seasoning, onion salt and garlic salt and omitted the salt and pepper.

The best clam chowder I have ever made.  I like my chowder thick and this was thick.  My only disappointment was it was lacking a bit in clam flavor.  I think I will try it with fresh clams next time.  I will never open another can of clam chowder, outside of an emergency that is.

This recipe is SUPER solid! That being said, it can be bland if you don't use a lot of salt and pepper. I read the comments after I made it (rookie mistake) and here's what I'll think about trying next time:
- Bacon grease & bacon
- Let the roux cook down more
- 1/2 teaspoon of Bay Seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder
- Chopped clams instead of minced clams
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
- Chives
- 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke
- Fresh grilled corn cut off the cob
- White pepper
- Saute the onion in the bacon fat, LOW & SLOW
- Clam juice - no water
- Dried minced onion?
- Nearly carmelize all the veggies first
- Parsley
- Celery salt
- Thyme

Made the recipe for 24 servings. Cooked a pound of bacon and started the veggies in the bacon grease for about 5 minutes before adding potatoes and covering with the clam juice. Scaled up all the ingredients proportionally and it was perfect. It may look like a lot of Onion or Celery but go with it. I cooked the rue on low heat for about 10-15 minutes to get rid of the flour smell and taste.

Great recipe! Easy to follow and once all the vegetables are chopped the chowder is complete in very little time. I added 1/2 lb chopped fried bacon and used the bacon fat to cook the onions in. I also used fat free half and half and it didn’t seem to affect the consistency. I can’t imagine it affected the taste very much either. I will use chopped clams next time since the minced were not very noticeable among the veggies.

Very good but I changed up the recipe. I only had 1 can of minced clams so I added a bottle of clam juice. Also, I used half cream, half milk. Next time I'll add bacon but all-in-all a great family meal - my kids LOVED it

As others have said, this is a good base recipe. I followed others' directions and sauteed the onion in bacon grease before adding the other veggies. I subbed clam juice for water with the veggies. I added 1/2 tsp Old Bay and 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder. Very good and velvety smooth after adjustments. If you find it a bit too thick you can add a splash of milk until it's to your liking.

I added more clams and a little more butter than what it called for and only used one potato... this was the best clam chowder I have ever had! And it was the first time I have ever made any. It was awesome!!!

Doubled the Recipe  and have an abundant amount of leftovers. This is a very filling recipe. There were no complaints except everyone took to much and couldn't finish what they had in their bowl.

This was wonderful.  For some reason it was a bit thick.  We were drinking a white wine so we put it in and it was unreal.
Thank you I loved it.

We loved this.  I started with the 5 strips of bacon.  Drained some of the grease and cooked the vegetables in what grease was left.  I poured the liquid from the 3 whole baby clam cans  over the veggies plus a bottle of clam juice.  I added a bay leaf to that.  I made the roux with 1 stick of butter and 3/4c flour--that was perfect.  Then a quart of 1/2 1/2 plus a touch of milk.  Added garlic salt, onion powder, a bay leaf.   Next time I will reduce the celery and carrots to 1/2 c each.  Flavor was perfect for my clam chowda experts!!!!

I've made a couple of other clam chowder recipes but this one deserves 5 stars.  My husband asked that I make this one again.  We had a group of friends for lunch over the holiday.  All four men picked the clam chowder.  They all loved it.  Definitely a hit!

I have made this twice now, and this recipe is a keeper! The second time, I made some tweaks.  Used gluten free flour. No difference.  My own spices that I added... a few shakes of smoked paprika.  A couple shakes Old Bay.  a pinch of dill.  My husband said, that recipe was good, but whatever you did really put it over the top.  The family thinks I slaved over this, and it is a piece of cake to make... chop and boil some vegetables, make a white sauce, add clams, vinegar and stir it all up.   One typo I noticed is that the list called for three cans, and the recipe seemed to call for one.  I added three and it was good.

Delicious! We are in the Pacific Northwest. I used fresh clams that my husband dug from Ocean Shores. I also added smoked salmon (from fresh fish my husband caught) instead of bacon. It was amazing!  will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I made this for Christmas Dinner to accompany fresh crab and sourdough bread.  It is delicious.  I will never buy clam chowder again.  I did add bacon and bacon grease, along with thyme.  It was very tasty and my guests loved it.

I made this for the first time on Christmas Eve. My whole family the guinea pigs. I gave three stars because of the ease and the base isn’t bad but there is room for improvement. I used whole clams and chopped myself. There was too much flour. A rue is 1:1 but this was a little much. There wasn’t enough clam flavor, I’ll add clam stock next time. I’ll probably try whole milk rather than half and half as this is thick! The veggies were good and held up well. The carrots were a different spin but tasty. All in all this is a solid base to build on. Plus my family ate it!

I made this recipe  and loved it.  AND for all those bacon crazy people out there, my humble opinion is that if I wanted bacon chowder I would have made bacon chowder.  I LOVE the taste of clams, and bacon only detracts from this.  I don't recommend bacon.  I made even more clam flavor by using the recommended amount of clams, but chopped instead of minced.  In addition, I made my own clam juice by steaming 3 lbs of clams. I did not add carrots.  This has been my Christmas Eve tradition for 4 years, and I hope to continue for many many more. YUMMY!!!  Serve with warm sour dough bread and a light salad and get smiles!!!

This clam chowder was great, the red wine vinegar really brought the flavor out. I left the carrots and celery out as I have picky eaters in my house. I cooked the roux "flour and butter" for about 5 minutes whisking constantly to get flour taste cooked out. My kids added bacon to theirs and liked it better that way. Thanks for sharing this recipe we will make this again!

I made this exactly as it is written.  I added the salt and pepper a little bit at a time until I got it to where I liked it. I'm not sure of the amounts. It was fantastic.  I'm not sure I tasted much difference with or without the wine vinegar but added it because that's what the recipe required. 
Then I tweaked it. I added a bit of Thyme and garlic powder.  I should have left well enough alone. It was better without them. 
Live and learn. That only means I will have to make this again and again.
Thank you!

Really terrific recipe. Made it for a crowd and it was a hit. I used a 51oz can of clams and juice from Costco and it was not too much clams. It also provided mugh more clam juice so I needed almost no water. I also increased all the vegetables by half a cup. Using sweet unsalted butter, I needed a bit more salt for some but left it out so that everyone could season individually. Some specifically appreciated the lower sodium.

We loved this one.  I do not understand the need to add bacon to everything.  I did NOT add bacon or bacon fat to this and it was great.  Extremely rich.  When I make again I will probably use a little milk or broth to cut the half and half.  I did use 3 cans, not 2, of clams.

Excellent soup. Did add 6 strips of bacon  cooked and saved the grease and reduced the butter by the amount of grease from bacon. Also reduce salt by 1/2 tsp and add 1/2 tsp of garlic salt. Also added 1 tsp of bay seasoning.

I cooked according to the recipe, but did add bacon bits to the soup at the end.  At the end, the soup was a little too thick, like gravy, so I thinned it with some milk and added a tablespoon of Sherry cooking wine. Delicious.....  Next time, I will use half milk and half 1/2 and 1/2.....

I did not add any red wine vinegar or carrotts ( mainly because my in-laws don't like  it in there ).Other than that I followed it to the T. This is a fantastic recipe and I will use it over and over again. Thank you for contributing this.

No bacon. I make New England clam chowder all of the time and the first thing is to brown bacon and add butter. When Bacon is done you crumble it and then cook the celery and onions until translucent, then you add the clam juice and potatoes and seasonings and bring to boil for about 10 minutes then you add one large ear of corn off the cob where the kernels had been roasted for about 10 minutes along with the clams, stir all together and then add cream and bring to a slow boil, then you mix corn starch and water together and pour into hot soup and blend to thicken. You are missing all of this and therefore the soup is marginal. The bacon is the real key to the flavor you get in restaurants and my recipe comes from the Cliffs of Main recipe which I got off the internet and have used it for years.

Made this chowder recipe for dinner tonight.  It’s an easy recipe AND it tastes good:  winner!  The red wine vinegar really brightens the dish (like using a splash of lemon juice on other dishes).  I’m keeping this in my favorites file.

I made changes based on previous reviews,  I used clam juice and chicken broth to boil the potatoes in , and used bacon grease to cook the onions and carrots in before adding them to the potatoes and clam juice chicken broth. I bought chopped clams instead of minced. It turned out really good, would make again.

Amaze! I only subbed a few things because I eat low carb... frozen cauliflower, defrosted and chopped instead of potatoes, more heavy cream + less water instead of half & half, added 6 slices of bacon grease to ghee instead of butter, added the chopped bacon to chowder.  I used paleo flour instead of all purpose.  I also made keto bread and poured chowder over...yummy!

The better the clams the better the soup will be. I also would recommend adding half the clam water from the cans of you go that route, otherwise it doesn't turn out very thick and you'll have to add more flour or corn starch to make it thicker. This goes great with bread bowls if you can find them! 
Also, this recipe makes a lot so if it's just a couple eating this, you're going to have leftovers, lots, and they'll likely go bad before you can eat it all. 
So half it! 
However, if you're cooking for a group you'll be good :)

Excellent consistency and flavor!  I spruced it up by adding chicken broth instead of water when cooking the vegetables. Threw in fresh thyme and rosemary to the stock as well.

Was great! Used clam juice instead of water and used an extra can of baby clams, turned out perfect! Be sure to add salt to your liking, I felt it definitely needed more salt.

Will use Coffee Mate in stead of Half & Half,. Making it this evening it looks absolutely delicious. Can't wait to make it, I haven't made homemade clam chowder in many years and I just love it. I appreciate finding the recipe on on this site, since I haven't made it in at least 15 years or more. I normally go to a particular restaurant but there's nothing like homemade.

The chowder came out really good. The stock was nice and creamy, but no too thick. It's not good when it's thick like gravy. I ordered fresh middleneck clams online from Crab Dynasty.

Like many, added some real bacon. Also a couple finely chopped crimini mushrooms. That said, this is clearly a great recipe just as posted. And that’s from an east coast Canadian Maritimer where seafood and clam chowders must meet exacting standards

Like other reviewers have stated, this soup lacked so much flavor and tasted very floury even though I thoroughly cooked the flour and butter mixture. It didn’t even taste like clam chowder except for the occasional clam you’d come across. I’ve had many clam chowders and I’ve never had any with carrots before. This soup needs a lot of tweaking. I might try it again with quite a bit of substitutions/modifications, or just look for a new recipe altogether.

I've made it like the recipe calls for and it is excellent. Next I did what a few of the other reviews said, added bacon, garlic etc. I also have had cream to use so I really go for the extra calories then :)  I like to also add cod fish to mine as well. After you make the bacon, fry up a little cod (but you can just put it in raw as well if you give it enough time to cook) and my kids barely know its there, mixes in with the potatoes. After its done cooking, I sprinkle over the top the crumbled bacon and some diced parsley or chives for extra appeal. I like to make it a full and heavy meal. My husband, born & raised in Maine, loves all of this, says its much better than a restaurant.

I love New England Clam Chowder ( not a fan of Manhattan Clam Chowder)

I think it should be thick & full of clams.

I omit the carrots, there should not be orange things floating in  Clam Chowder & they add no flavor.

Use 3 cans minced clams + 2 cans of chopped or baby clams.

Also, bottled clam juice in place of water is a must.

The 6 strips of crumbled bacon is a very nice touch (as others have mentioned)

I dice the potatoes incited of cubing them so they fit on a soup spoon better. 

Serve with a side of Oyster cracker for anyone that would like them.

Also, make your own Half & Half (1/2 heavy cream + 1/2 whole milk)

I make this EXACTLY like the recipe, and everyone who has ever had it LOVES it!  I don't understand why anyone would think this is bland.  I am very picky and like flavorful foods and this is my favorite clam chowder, hands down.

I made a gazillion changes including using riced cauliflower as my base and reducing the heavy cream to a cup. But I kept the overall idea the same and added thyme and old bay seasoning. It’s soooo delicious!

I think this is a great starter recipe for a basic, no frills, clam chowder. 

The instructions don’t really elaborate on the butter and flour phase, but I let it cook a little while until it is almost a roux which thickens the half and half nicely....  the recipe as written was too thick for me, but was still delicious.

I’ve made it three times so far, but after testing it a few times I’ve decided I like adding an extra 2 cups of half and half.

This goes in my edible but not memorable category. Too much carrot and celery, not enough clams and not thick enough.

Seriously lacking in flavor.  No spices at all -
I added Time, Tarragon and Basil. What's a chowder without sweet corn? I added bacon and the bacon fat. Used no water, but did use a 8Oz. bottle of clam juice. This recipe produced an exceedingly bland result

I always order clam chowder if the restaurant I’m in has it.  I made this recipe as it was given and loved it.  How anyone could give it less than five stars is beyond me.  Now that I have read other reviews I’m going to try some of their ideas.

Subbed dry sherry with a little white vinegar for the red wine vinegar and diluted the half and half by 50% with 2% milk.  Perfect.

For me, chowder has to be just the right thickness - not too runny and not too thick. I used about 2c half and half and the rest I used whole milk and the consistency was perfect. Tasty, too. Served with sourdough crostinis. I’ll defiitely make this again.

Excellent!   Easy to make and great flavor.  I put a little less vinegar than suggested but next time will put it all in.  The only other thing I did different was an extra can of clams just because I had it.  Did not feel like it needed bacon or whatever, loved it just as written.  Perfect for Friday in Lent or anytime.

This clam chowder recipe is fantastic!  Like others, I fried bacon, sautéed my carrots and celery in grease then added 8+ ounces of clam juice. I bought 8 ounces and drained the clam juice from the clams. I used 1% milk , 10 tablespoons butter for the roux. I couldn’t decide about minced, chopped or whole clams so I bought all 3.  I couldn’t determine one better than the other. 

Great recipe!  Thank you!

Excellent recipe. I made three changes but only due to personal preference 1) I always saute my onion and veg in margarine or olive oil before adding to liquid. In this case I sautéed them in becel olive oil margarine then added the clam juice and followed recipe as is until my next change  2) I found I had to use at least another 2 cups of milk as it was too thick for my liking. I will keep this recipe handy and have marked my changes but will also either use less flour or plan to use more milk in the roux from the start .3)  I added Old Bay Seasoning as I do to most of my seafood recipes, just gives it that extra little kick. great recipe and the red wine vinegar is a special touch - what about red wine??? Hmmm.

It was really bland even though I followed some of the suggestions that were recommended by others (e.g., substituting clam juice in place of the water, using garlic to season, etc.) I think it would be great if there were more seasonings added to it.

This chowder was very good.  I followed some of the suggestions made and used some Old Bay Seasoning and some flaked red pepper because my husband likes heat.  I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe as written and came out with a lbland tasting chowder.  I went back again and with improvements, turned out fine. If using this recipe, I would follow user suggestions and sauté garlic with the veggies, add clam juice instead of water, reduce flour to 1/2 cup and use spices (old bay, thyme, white pepper) I also think that this needs some heat so I would use a little cayenne or chili powder.  We prefer fresh lemon juice with seafood so we subbed that for the vinegar.

Great flavor and loved by whole family.  I also added bacon as others suggested.  Also made 2/3 of roux or else I find the chowder is much too thick.

Turned out well. Made the recommended changes , bacon, old bay. I used instant mash potato as thickener. I used extra clams but would have liked a more clam taste but very good as a basic recipe.

I thought this was GREAT!! I was afraid of the red wine vinegar so I put a bit less in. I also didn't put as much salt in. This is an excellent recipe. Don't be afraid of the carrots. Here in New England not too many people actually use carrots in clam chowda. I figured I would be adventurous so I did it. I would definitely make it again and I would put in the full quantity of vinegar. We did add salt individually. So, just follow this recipe exactly. Wicked good!!

Made this tonight and it was very good. I did fine the first instruction about the clam and juice in the skillet confusing. Then AFTER I dumped the juice down the drain I realized that the juice went into the pot and the claims are set aside. So with that I think the flavor was good but would we better with more seafood flavor. Not a fan of celery so I put frozen corn in at the end.

I rarely read ratings. People change the recipe to the point that it isn't what they made.  I'm an accomplished cook and followed the instructions to the T.  This is fabulous!   Okay....now for my input.  More potatoes lol.  Thanks for a really great and easy chowder!

Wonderful! Per other comments, I browned 6 pieces of bacon first, then added the vegetables, water, clam juice to the bacon drippings. When the soup was done, I added in the chopped up bacon. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was a crowd pleaser!

This is tasty WITH a FEW modifications. You have to, to ones taste. I added chicken bullion cubes to my water. Used the bacon grease with the clam juice. Used a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken the soup. Did add bacon. It was AWESOME!

Umm..If I personally didn’t make this clam chowder myself, I would think I was just eating potato soup. Don’t get me wrong, it IS delicious!!! However, there is not a hint of clam flavor at all! The only thing “clam” about it are the chunks from the 3 cans of minced and 1 whole baby clam (I added whole because we love clams!!). I followed everything perfectly and even added some bacon grease to the veggies and clam juice.  I would make it again though!!

Excellent clam chowder recipe...I have dairy intolerant family members so had to swap the dairy...for the  cream I used full fat coconut milk (14 oz.) + 2 cups of homemade chicken broth and reserved all the water & oil from the smoked clams about 1 cup worth.  Added 2 pieces of bacon diced & some bacon grease to soup base. For the butter I used coconut oil. Delicious, rich and comforting on a cold dreary day.

Oh myyyy is this a keeper! 
I did follow the advice of others and cooked the veggies in bacon grease, used white pepper instead of black  and used half cornstarch/half flour for the roux.
Minor adjustments, but I feel like it would be great just as written too.
Delish!!!

Way too much flour. The soup was so thick, it was like pureed baby food! I think 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of flour would suffice. I had to thin it out with more milk. Add your salt in gradually- I was fine with 1 and 1/4 tsp salt. I did not try adding I  the vinegar so I cannot speak for that.

The recipe was great. I did make a few changes based on other comments. I precooked the potatoes. I added a bottle of clam juice instead of water. I added a seafood blend from Costco. Lastly I added a lil bit of corn starch and garlic powder. The carrots and celery add color, but not much else.

The red wine vinegar gave it extra flavor.
I always add extra potatoes.
Will definitely be my go to clam chowder recipe.

I am going to rate this exclusively based on the 3/4 cups of flour.  Even 2 Tbs of flour is unnecessary.  You should be doing a slight mash of the potatoes after they're cooked, and then perhaps whisking things back together before serving so that the served soup is properly emulsified.

The bacon fat made a lot of difference. It tasted excellent because of it. Also I cut down a little on the half and half because I wanted the consistency to be on the thicker side.

Made it with some bacon fat as well as butter and added the chopped bacon to final soup. Tasted great but was a bit too rich for our family. Will try again with less fat.

Way too thick, maybe more fluid, less flour. Flavor was good though. I did cook down the flour and butter mixture but it still had a thick pasty taste.

OMG I love this recipe.  I have cooked for many years and never made clam chowder because my husband will not eat it.  So I had this chowder and he got chicken noodle out of a can.  This was easy to make, was fairly quick to make and just such a wonderful, delicate flavor.  I thought better than clam chowder in restaurants.  Make it just the way it is written and enjoy.  grammagennie

This was good, easy. I used heavy cream and a low carb thickener. Added chicken stock instead of water. I would have added clam juice had I had it and bigger clams. I also used diced turnips instead of potatoes.

It's a good soup.  Added 4 cans of clams and spring onions as preference upon service.  Changed black pepper to white.  Otherwise, made as is and it was pretty good.  Definitely better than Progresso Clam Chowder, but not quite as good as nana used to make.  Kids and hubby were happy with it, so it's a winner here.  Thanks.

Made this tonight and what a huge hit with my family! The only change I made was to add in one pint of heavy whipping cream and four cans clams instead of three. I also used Krusteaz gluten free flour, which worked beautifully. I think it was important to cook the vegetables in the clam juice because it gave the soup a wonderful flavor. This is one of the easiest soups I've ever made. Delicious!

Outstanding. Foolproof! This was my very first attempt at clam chowder, and I'm so glad I used this recipe!! I followed the original with modifications based on the suggestions of other commenters: 1) cooked roux with half butter, half bacon grease and made sure to cook it all down to avoid too much of a flour flavor, 2) used clam juice (and chicken broth) in lieu of water, and 3) seasoned with Old Bay, onion powder, and garlic salt. The red wine vinegar put the flavor over the top!!! Served with sourdough bread. Incredible!

Delicious! Boiled the vegetables (1 onion, 3 carrots, 3 celery stalks, 6 small red potatoes) in all the clam juice (from 4 cans minced and 2 cans whole) and about a cup of water to cover everything. I also added 2 handfuls of prepared crumbled bacon since its all I had on hand and some dried thyme (about a tsp) from my garden. I mixed up the flour with the cold half and half and then added it to the butter. When it became a roux, I added it to the veggies and let that combine and heat up before adding the reserved clams and some black pepper.  We omitted the vinegar. Wonderful! This will become a regular in our house.

.....Update: Today we had another snow day, so we made this again. This time I tried it with the vinegar. It surprised me how flavorful the soup became with a small amount of vinegar. Add it, don't hesitate.  You'll be glad you did.

I echo the bacon, of which I substituted the carrots with ... never heard of clam chowdah with carrots (NH born and raised).  Five stars with cooperation of others, but well done on demystifying this for me...I always had it made for me.

Stop reading now if you're someone who doesn't think changes should be reviewed!  :-)

I used stock that I'd made from mussels shells and shrimp tails (from the evening before) in place of the  water, but I would substitute clam juice if I didn't have that.  Water just doesn't seem right.  I also cooked up 4 pieces of bacon, removed them and sauteed the veggies in the drippings for a moment before adding the stock.  (Before adding the veggies and clam juice/stock into the white sauce, I skimmed off some of the fat that came to the top, just to cut down a bit on the calories.)  I added the pepper but left out the salt so that people could add their own amount at the table.  Served this with salad and crusty bread - great winter night dinner!

This was some of the best clam chowder I've made. It's an easy recipe and tastes great. It's flavorful and very creamy, just how I like my chowder. Others who also had a bowl commented on the flavor. Definitely worth a try.

This was a great base to work with.  I made some modifications based on my tastes.....half the potatoes, used clams, prawn, squid, crab and scallops.  I added clam juice instead of water and a little bit of chicken stock.  it was fantastic!  For those who found it runny, just keep stirring on medium high heat and it WILL thicken!  I will definitely make this again!

I have made this several times and each time my family loves it!  It is an easy recipe to make.  The only thing I change is adding bacon and sweating the onions and celery in the bacon grease before cooking the potatoes and carrots. Definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who is a fan of clam chowder.

I followed the suggestions of several others that have tried  the recipe. I cooked up bacon and split it in half, one portion to start the vegetables and one to replace part of the butter in the roue. I only used clam juice to simmer the vegetables and no water. Garnished with bacon and green onions. Oh, and I seasoned the vegetables with garlic powder, parsley and pepper.

This is a very rich soup, gourmet quality

The first time I made this I wasn't overly fond of it.  But I tried it again today and love it.  I made it exactly as written using chopped clams instead of minced (I like bigger pieces).  This is what New England Clam Chowder is supposed to taste like.  Will definitely be making again.

Add your favorite seafood too!  Chunks of shrimp, salmon even scallops make it a rich treat.  My mother's recipe was very similar, but I add bacon (which other reviews recommend) and 2 teaspoons of sugar.  The Red Wine Vinegar is a must and I serve Malt Vinegar at the table to add a few drops as the garnish.  My guests frequently request this recipe

I made the same changes as most added the bacon. Grated the carrots diced the celery and potato small. I omitted the salt my husband is on a low sodium diet. This was delicious.

This was a great clam chowder soup!  I followed other suggestions.  I cooked 4 pieces of bacon and used the grease to brown the onions and cook the carrots and celery.  Then I added the potatoes and a can of corn.  Cooked all of this with the clam juice from 4 cans on medium while making the roux.  I did not add other spices, just salt and added the vinegar at the end.  Next time I would add Old Bay.  GREAT SOUP.  I don't think the adding of bacon or corn alters the recipe that greatly, just makes it better.

I have made this chowder several times now and it's nothing short of amazing. I double the clams and I choose to use the chopped clams instead of minced. Do not omit the vinegar!  It is truly the secret weapon. Nice with crusty bread on a snowy day!

Based on a number of other reviews, I added three rashers of bacon and then cooked the vegies in the bacon fat. I also used  1/2t Old Bay Spice, three cloves of garlic, 1t Cholula sauce, 1/2t onion powder and white pepper instead of black.
Finally, I used gluten free all purpose flour with 2t of cornstarch. That might have been a little heavy handed with the cornstarch. I thought it messed the texture up just a bit.

I thought the vinegar was a perfect addition. Overall, I thought  this was yummy but not exceptional. My guy loved it, so four stars.

Boring! Tasted like nothing! Adding water didn't help. I would use chopped clams next time. Minced was like eating nothing. I have made clam chowder many times and I wouldn't make this one again.

This recipe was easy and tasty. However, it turned out a little too thick for my palate. One change I will make when I prepare this recipe again is to use half the amount of half-and-half and use whole milk for the other.

Excellent recipe. I followed it almost exactly, but I did half the amount of half and half, and skim milk for the rest and about 2/3 of the butter to reduce calories. Still excellent, rich, creamy. Wonderful dish!

We loved this but made some changes. I cooked the vegetables in clam juice. I did not use cream but skim milk because that's what I have and never use cream. It was thick but did not taste like flour. I forgot the red cider vinegar for my first bowl but added it for the rest and it really made a positive  addition. My husband said he could not get a better clam chowder in a restaurant.

Absolutely AWESOME recipe! I left out celery and carrot (personal preference), fried a few slices of bacon and cooked onion in that. Followed all other recipe measurements exactly and we loved it. I agree with some other reviews that the red wine vinegar really enhances the flavors and makes them "pop". This is a keeper for sure!

This is my go to clam chowder recipe, however, I substitute a bottle of clam juice for the water. Also, as well as the 3 cans chopped clams, I add 2 large cans of whole clams.

I do love it though!!

I like the pure flavors of cream and fresh razor clams and for us there was just too much carrots & celery.  Next time I think we will make it with 1/2 as much celery and no carrots.  We also used bacon grease as a base and clam juice to cook potatoes.  It was good but not great.

Excellent! My family's favorite soup now. Perfect with homemade bread to dip.  Made w/o celery. Instead of half & half, used 1/2 amount of heavy whipping cream, rest water instead.

I have been using this recipe for years.  Over the years, I have made a few adjustments.  I reduce the half and half and substitute with milk.  I also sauté the veggies in a little bit of bacon grease.  This recipe is so good and inexpensive, it makes it impossible for me to order chowder at a restaurant!

This is a great recipe! I changed just a couple things after reading the reviews: I diced and cooked a few strips of bacon first, took the bacon out, and cooked the veggies in the bacon grease. Then I cooked the potatoes separately first (mostly par-boiled), then used chicken broth instead of water to cover & cook the veggies and potatoes before adding the roux.  When it was finished cooking, it was a tad too runny for my taste, so I used a potato masher to roughly mash some of them to thicken it up. Added the diced cooked bacon back into the chowder, and I also added some hot sauce to taste at the end. It was delicious!

I agree with others that bacon fat and crumbled bacon bring this recipe over the top. Also more clams wouldn't hurt. I used 1 pint half and half and one pint 5% and still needed to add some 2% milk at the end to thin it out.

I love this recipe, but I had a problem with it being a  little bit too thick. So, I recommend a little less flour or a bit more ceeam.

I made this soup with fresh clams and it was divine.  My husband and son loved it!!!  If I were to change anything, I think next time I will try using homogenized milk instead of half and half for no other reasons than to make it less thick and cut some calories/fat.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!!

I love this recipe. I see people giving less stars for not adding bacon and grease. I don't get that. the good thing about this recipe is it is able to be altered to your tastes. for instance I left out the carrots and used a tad more potatoes. I also used red potatoes as that's the way my mother, who hides her recipe, makes it. this deserves 5 stars because this is perfect clam chowder.

This is a great chowder recipe.  I've been making it for years.  You don't taste the vinegar - it just adds a little zip.    A little bit of vinegar add so much to just about any soup or stew.

Loved it! I was intrigued by the red wine vinegar but it made all the difference. I added a bottle of clam juice to up the clammy flavor and tsp. of vegetable bouillon. I also used 2 - 10 oz. can of clams instead of 3 - 6.5oz. It was so yummy. Of course, I served it with sour dough bread. Enjoy!

My husband rated this 10 stars. I used clam juice in lieu of water and sautéed the onions in bacon grease, using the crisp bacon as a topping just before serving. I omitted the carrots because it just didn't seem like orange anything needs to go in a New England clam chowder. The red wine vinegar was a great addition to the flavor. I probably won't add as much flour next time and will use another can or two of clams and I may use a teaspoon of thyme. Delicious!

I've made my rendition of this recipe probably 20 times by now and it is really great. As others said, you definitely want to add the bacon step in. I use 4 strips, chopped, and set aside the cooked bacon for topping the soup with. I add two bottles of clam juice and top the rest of it off with vegetable broth to cover. 

I also prefer a less chunky soup so I run the hand blender through it before adding the clams, leaving some chunks. This also thickens it - so all I need then is to whisk about 3T of butter into 2 cups of half/half and mix that in to get it to the right consistency. All that butter is an unneeded and fattening step to me! 

Do not skip the red wine vinegar though! I put the bottle right on the table to drizzle in each bowl.

Followed recipe as a guideline but started with a lb of thick cut bacon in a Dutch oven. Once crispy, removed and set aside. Added veggies to bacon drippings and cooked for a couple of minutes then followed recipe. Chopped up the bacon and added half to soup when combining remaining ingredients. Used remaining bacon as a garnish when serving.  Came out good. Guests are two bowls each. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great base for clam chowder. I made it the first time following the directions.  It needed a bit more though.  Ever since, I add 3 cans of chopped clams and 2 minced.  That kicks up the clam to enough.  I also added 4-5 strips of crumbled bacon and  cook the veggies in that along with clam juice from all the clams I opened up.  When you make this, make sure you cook the rue to get rid of that flour taste.  It only takes about 4-5 minutes, but so worth it.  I've used all half and half and sometimes half of half and half and the other half 2% milk.  Both are great to use.  The last few times I've made this, I've also added some tarragon near the end.  I love tarragon and I think it added just another  note to this already lovely soup.  My family loves it when I make this and there's never any leftovers.  Can't beat that.  Oh, and either serve it in some sourdough bread bowls or have some on the side.  So good!

Everything Chefsingledad but sautéed 8oz sliced portobellos, and don't forget some fresh garlic. Clams and broth were leftover from a previous bake which I think makes a huge difference.another clam bake this weekend and more chowder from leftovers to follow. Great recipe.

I have made this clam chowder at least 5 times now and it is incredibly delicious and easy.  I love that it is a traditional fish-only chowder like my New England grandmother used to make. I do make three simple additions:

1.  I use four cans of clams instead of three.
2.  I add a couple teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning and dried Thyme when I add the salt and pepper.
3.  At the very end, I remove a one cup portion of chowder and blend it for about 30 seconds in the Vitamix. I then return it to the pot. This thins the chowder to a perfect texture without sacrificing flavor (like adding water does).

I found this clam chowder to be very bland even after taking other reviewers suggestions and incorporating bacon. Maybe using clam juice instead of water would give it a more of a clam flavor. I don't know. My husband liked it so it wasn't a total waste.

I followed the recipe the first time and it was good.  I mixed up the recipe a bit the second time and it was perfect.  I browned 4 strips of chopped bacon first,  used the fat to cook the onion,  celery,  and carrots,  then basically continued as the recipe stated.  turned out amazing.

Made changes to boost flavour. Crisped a few slices of diced bacon. Added butter after the vegetables. Minced 3 cloves of garlic. Deglazed with 2 capfuls of sherry. Then added flour. Threw in a couple dashes of cayenne and used no salt added chicken broth, clam juice from clams and a small bottle of clam juice. Simmered for about 1/2 hour, added the clams and heated through. Used 1 cup of whipping cream. Very good.

I made it for dinner, and it turned out great! There are just a few notes I have.

First, if you're on a time budget and don't have all day to cook, you should put the veggies on high and let them boil in the broth. They'll simply stay as rocks if you keep them on medium. If you still want a little crunch, turning up the heat halfway through will do, but unless you like raw potatoes, you have to turn up the heat! On a positive note, I normally hate veggies (especially carrots), but the veggies, once softened, create a wonderful texture (and a little nutrition... you know, besides the crazy amount of butter).

Also, and this should have probably been something I should have known, but it's a good idea to give your clams a rinse before throwing them in. I found that some of the clams had a gritty bit to them, probably from dirt. It won't kill you (12 hours later, I'm just fine!), but it can hurt your teeth a little. Just a little rinse in water will fix the problem.

I made a few changes. First, I find vinegar far too sour for my taste, so I omitted it and added in some of my favorite spiced for taste and color: paprika, oregano, basil, garlic paste, onion powder, and parsley. I also used green onions instead of a regular onion. It's easier to cut, is very fragrant, and it doesn't make your eyes tear up. Though if you do this, put them in the broth when everything else is 10 minutes from being done, or they'll get soggy. I also added bacon (turkey bacon for us) like a lot of pe

I cut the recipe in half but used 2 cans of clams and a bottle of clam juice instead of water. Be careful not to overcook the carrots and potatoes. A little al dente will make your mouth happy.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I was unimpressed with the texture and taste of this recipe. I thought it only resembled New England clam chowder in that it had the same basic ingredients (I.e. Cream and clams) but not an authentic texture or taste.

I took a suggestion and added the bacon and this is always a hit.  My picky mother even craves it now.

I did make a couple changes, but I loved it, so felt the need to give this recipe at least 4 stars. It was only me and my son eating, so I reduced the recipe to 3 servings and per suggestions, I first cooked 3 slices of bacon and used the grease to cook the onions . Then I used the grease and half the butter for the flour mixture. I didn't have extra clam juice (as some suggested using to cover veggies), so I used some chicken broth instead to add flavor. At the end I added the bacon bits. After all of that this dish was certainly NOT lacking flavor! So scrumptious. I look forward to making it for my husband when he returns from work. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an VERY good base. I suggest every one add what seasonings to their liking. We don't like potatoes in soups so we take them out after it thickens, and also add some old bay an cayenne for some extra kick.  We also use 6 cans of clams rather than 3 so it makes it extra clammy.  But it is delicious and we make it at least twice an month.

Only changes made were to add more clams and use clam juice for the boiling liquid. There was a missing depth of flavor.  I liked the texture, it was smooth and creamy, but it still need a little something.  I'll try it again, maybe adding some Old Bay Seasoning like someone else suggested.

I tweeked this  recipe like the others. I used 1/2 bacon fat & 1/2 butter & flour, made a Roux,  No Water.  Used  2 bottles of Clam juice plus the juice in the cans & 1 Qt. of 1/2  & 1/2, 1 Tbsp Ole Bay & pepper to taste and the potatoes, carrots , celery & onions .  Add the Clams, garnish with crispy crumbled  bacon.  Was a big hit with my family.  Will make this over & over again.

Love this recipe! My husband really enjoys it for dinner most nights! Try adding some dill weed to the soup while its heating up, it makes it a lot more flavorful. Also try seasoning the vegetables with salt and pepper. Overall a great recipe!

This is so good! I increase the veggies except onion to 3 cups each and add some frozen corn at the end. I melt the butter, cook the veggies, stir in the flour to cook 2 minutes while stirring, pour in clam juice from two 10 oz cans, add the milk (2%) mixed with a few schools of powdered milk. Our favorite seasonings are salt and black pepper to taste and about 1 t each parsley, thyme, and Old Bay seasoning. The clams and a few dashes if vinegar are stirred in before serving.

Made as directed and LOVED it! I actually forgot to add the onions until last. So I cooked them in a little butter until soft. I think I prefer then that way anyway. Very easy recipe. Perfect consistency. Next time, I might add the bacon as suggested in some reviews. But, delicioso without it!

We have made this a couple of times. Since my husband is lactose intolerant I use lactaid milk instead of the half and half. Also used chicken bouillon instead of the wine. Of course sauted the onions, celery and diced bacon together. Boiled the flour mixture a while to get the flour taste out.

This was so quick.  All the family raved.  Best clam chowder I have ever made.  It didn't taste like clams in gravy.  Very nice flavor.  I did add 8 oz sour cream so the doctor could scream, but it was worth it!

Followed the recipe with adding a little bacon fat with the butter. It was a very enjoyable chowder which we will rotate in our meals at least once a month.

This was awesome! Did make a couple of small changes...I chopped the onions (not finely) and instead of adding them to the broth in step 1, I sauted them in the butter in step 2 before adding in the flour. I also used 2 10 oz. cans of whole baby clams, instead of the chopped/minced clams. Made it really meaty. Don't skip the red wine vinegar...sheer genius. It really made it pop!

Stuff I added:

* I added 3 lg cloves of garlic   I used a yellow onion
* I used 3 yukon gold potatoes
* I skipped the carrots. They don't belong in clam chowder
* I used 1 Can whole clams and 1 Can chopped clams
* I added the juice of the Can of whole clams
* I used 3 celery stalks
* Added about a tablespoon of Thyme
* Added cayenne pepper
* Added a few splashes of Tobasco
* It was really thick so I gradually added about 2-3 Cups vegetable broth

Can't remember what else.  Just had fun with it.  A Bay Leaf would have been cool. I forgot to add it.  Also forgot to buy parsley for garnish, because I like making it pretty :)  Enjoy!

This is our absolute most favorite clam chowder recipe, with a couple modifications to suit our tastes! For the most part, I kept everything the same, except a couple things. I cooked the veggies in bacon fat (we keep leftover fat in a jar in the fridge, or you can cook fresh bacon), then instead of adding water to them, I use a bottle of clam juice. Also, I use a pint of heavy cream, plus a quart of half and half because we like ours thick. If it gets too thick I add milk. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the changes I made. Fabulous, thank you!

I used fresh clams (steamed them first then strained the steaming water through paper filter to get all the good clam juice) and whisked clam water into soup with thickening flour. Used all fresh celery, and other veggies. It was great :)

Very good, easy, quick clam chowder.  Few changes:  I had a couple strips of cooked bacon left over from breakfast.  Started by warming those in the pot before adding the onions, etc.  Just gave it that nice flavor.  I left the bacon in throughout the whole process.  Must thin (or thicken) to your own preference, the flavor does not suffer either way.  Although I am usually a vinegar fan, next time I will not add the vinegar.    I added a pinch of rosemary leaves.  Delish.

Delicious!!  I have made this several times now and it is a monthly favorite in our house.  After the first time, I decided to cut back on the amount of flour to one Tbsp.  and cooked the potatoes in chicken stock until tender.  Added a few strips of bacon and two additional  cans of clams. YUM!

This is an excellent recipe for clam chowder. I followed other recommendations and browned a few strips of bacon in the skillet, drained the grease, added butter and EVOO and then cooked the veggies slightly before adding the clam juice and chicken stock instead of water. I don't use half and half, as it's just too rich and it kills me to use that much. I use regular 2% milk instead and it still comes out creamy and delish. You can substitute the proportion of milk/half and half as you desire, it's really a great base that you can tweak as you see fit. I've omitted the clams altogether and made it with lots of potatoes, cheddar, corn, and bacon or ham and just use it as a potato soup. It's very versatile. The vinegar really adds something special. Thanks so much for the great recipe, a definate keeper!

This was easy to make.  I doubled the recipe, peeled and cut my own carrots, potatoes, and onions; and it took me less than 50 minutes - start to finish.  I will certainly make this again.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Added bacon and sauteed the onions lightly in bacon grease before adding the other veggies. Besides that I followed it exactly. It was a big hit!!!

Delicious, we loved it.  I sauteed the vegetable (minus the potatoes) until lightly caramelized, and added 1 clove of minced garlic.  I used all clam juice, no water.  Made a rue with the butter and flour and cooked and stirred (and stirred and stirred) until it turned light brown.  Doubled the clams. Totally worth the calories!!

It was good, but to make it GREAT, next time I will triple the  amount of clams and use fresh ones.  And bacon is a must in my opinion.  This was my first try--I added a Magi (large) crawfish seasoning cube and Old Bay Seasoning--in retrospect, I think a garnish of fresh chopped green onions would be good too.  Not sure why it works but the addition of the red wine vinegar deepened the flavor--don't skip it!

My first time making homemade clam chowder. I wanted to make a chowder that had more veggies other than potatoes.   I took the advice of others and browned 6 strips of bacon, removed them and then started by adding veggies to the bacon grease. Did not use the red wine vinegar as I did not have any, so I don't think I missed anything. This made enough for 2, 2 dinners and lunches.  Had the Red Lobster cheddar cheese biscuits with this. So very yummy!

I LOVED this! But I did follow others advice on using the bacon grease and crumbling the bacon in! That is the only reason for the 4 stars! The red wine vinegar really gives it good flavor! Thank you for this recipe! YUUUUMMMMY!

I tried it following the recipe.  I agree with others stating the roux makes it to thick. As I was tasting I could get no hints of clam but more of a almost potato soup thing. I added bacon as well and prepared that like the others said in the bacon fat. I only used clam juice, no water. I used chicken broth to thin it out, also I added a dash of Frank's hot sauce, white pepper, some fish sauce for more fish flavor, some  celery salt ,and thyme.   Next time I make it no roux maybe even regular milk and more potatoes.

I used 2- 5 0z cans of whole clams, and instead of the half and Half, I used heavy cream.     I also used Pinot Grigio instead of the vinegar. The substitutions were made only because that is what I had on hand.  This is amazing!  My husband said it was the best he has ever had.

I've made this clam chowder several times before. I think the red wine vinegar is what sets it apart from other clam chowder. I made a few changes. I added a little bit of chicken bouillon with the clam juice when I cooked  the vegetables. I also added a handful of chopped parsley at the end. Very good. I don't think it needs any bacon or bacon fat

I have tried a lot of clam chowder from all over the united states and this is absolutely the best ever.  No need to change a thing unless you would like to add more clams.  I make this for my boyfriend and patrons at my bar and they constantly ask me to make it over and over.  Thank you

This recipe is great! I doubled it and used the fat of 3 bacon strips in veggie/clam juice mixture, adding the chopped bacon in the soup after. Also I used chopped clams instead of minced clams to get chunkier pieces.

I loved it.. So good recipe 
I messed up the part with the butter n flour   But i ended up putting the butter,flour & half n half in the blender to be on the safe side to avoid any clotting.. LOL 
Other than that it tasted soooo good before& after adding the black pepper, i may not add the black pepper next time though i liked it more without the black pepper 
I loved it ... Sure I'll be making it again

READ the comments of others before you make this unless you like a bland and pasty clam chowder.   I made it exactly as directed and now I'm doctoring it with suggestions of others to add some flavor:  bacon grease, old bay, garlic, etc...  Does anyone know how to get rid of the pasty effect afterwards?  I'm going to add clam juice.  Fingers crossed. :)

Hubby Loved this one!  Said it was the best clam chowder he has ever eaten and liked the added carrots.  Uses half and half so its a slightly healthier version.  It does make it super thick may consider milk next time as suggested in other reviews

Every Christmas Eve  our family has crab, Mac n cheese and clam chowder for Christmas Eve. The inlaws moved south, so tonight it was my turn to find the perfect chowder. I found this recipe and was not disappointed. I took the tip to add bacon and made a pretty amazing roux. It turned out fantastic and we will continue this tradition with this recipe for years to come. 

Corn would be a delicious addition as well.

Delicious! I did add the bacon step mentioned in other reviews.  Something wonderful happens when you add the  red wine vinegar.  Addicting!

Amazing!  I doubled the recipe and had great results!  It needed the extra salt and peper at the end.  I skipped the vinegar.  Rave reviews and I'll make it again!

I've made this a few times. Exactly as written and with my own spin. It's a good base but it has a lot more potential. Def do the user recommend bacon thing and if you like actual bites of clam, use chopped clams vs minced. My one real criticism is that this is thick. Reallllllly thick. Personal pref but I like  soup to be a soup and not a stew. SO called it tasty clam gravy. I might use whole milk and see if I can't thin it out just a bit. If that doesn't work, I'm going to add more clam juice or more milk.

"Oh, gosh, this is good!!" Is what I said with my first bite.  I haven't had clam chowder much before but I made this to surprise my husband, and I have to say that I like it better than any other clam chowder I've had!  He loved it too!!!

I make this all the time now whenever it's cold out. Perfect as is, but I add a teaspoon of dried dill weed sometimes. So good with some fresh sourdough bread! Than you for sharing the recipe.

Good base.  Replaced the water with clam juice.  The potatoes thickened it up enough that I didn't feel the butter/flour step was necessary.  Also I just used a splash of half and half vs. a quart.

First time I made this recipe, I doubled it to feed the neighbors family of five and my family of five. I forgot to use the red wine vinager but still it was  a huge success!!! Tonight I made this recipe with the vinegar and did not double. I used some heavy whipping cream as well and a jar of clam juice. Though it was still very good, it was lacking in the clam flavor department.....I recommend doubling the clams to 6 cans for a richer soup! Oh! And I also added an extra half stick of butter! The more the better;)

Excellent chowder, I added bacon and used some chicken broth instead of  the water and  clam juice.  I made this for family and friends at half time during a football game.  Everyone loved it. Will definitely make this again!

Although the recipe is a great base there is one very vital ingredient missing... Salt pork! Always start with salt pork and sauté your onions in the drippings. Then follow through with the recipe.  The red wine vinegar is an added touch I've incorporated over the years. Does something for the end flavor. Oh... And remove the salt pork from the pot prior to proceeding.

Now this is exactly what I wanted.  I don't like bacon in it, it overpowers the delicate flavors of the clams, butter, and milk.  However, loaded baked potato soup is amazing.
Everyone loves this clam chowder.

It was good but it was missing some flavor. I added garlic powder & bay leaf seasoning. If I were to make it again I wouldn't use the whole quart of half and half & I think the bacon like the other reviewers mentioned would make it better! Another can of clams wouldn't hurt either!

I made this for dinner this evening. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding bacon. I took the que from other reviewers and fried 6 slices of bacon, removed it from bacon and cooked the veggies in the clam juice and veggies. Absolutely FANTASTIC! And SUPER easy. Adding to my regular recipe menu for certain.

Great recipe,   For additional  flavor --I added 2 vegetable boullion cubes (equivalant to 4 cups),  used califlower instead of potatoes, basil, oregano, dill weed, and garlic powder.   Also added 1/2 cup of creme sherry.

excellent!   made it with the addition of bacon. super easy and can be tweaked to your taste -  just eyeball the veggies,  add however much you like. sprinkle the chopped cooked bacon on it just before serving. i think next time I'll cut the butter by a third and substitute half of the half and half with regular milk to save some fat and calories.  super delicious.  thanks for my new go-to-on-a-cold-day recipe!

My kids request this soup all of the time!  My husband also loves it.  I often make bacon and use the grease to sautee the onions and celery first.  Use some of the crumbled bacon on top for a nice presentation when serving. In addition to clams, I add multiple types of seafood:  crab, shrimp, scallops, and sometimes even calamari. I do add some cayenne pepper for a little spice to the soup, too!  Then serve this soup in bread bowls.  Yum!

OMGsh!!! This is ridiculously delicious. My entire family clamors for more, so I triple the recipe to ensure seconds and thirds all around. Served in sourdough bread bowls makes cold winter nights worth every single digit degree.

I will definitely make this again. I am putting here what I would normally put in my "personal notes" which is apparently no longer available. I used 4 small potatoes, 2 small carrots, and 3 celery stalks. Used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour, and about 3 cups of milk. Then added water/clam juice from veggies and veggies, and simmered until desired thickness. Salt to taste, a lot of ground pepper, and a good bit of old bay. Used 2 10 oz cans of baby clams. Turned out great!

LOVE, love love!!!  I have now made this many times over this summer and have tweaked it to be my own! First made following recipe. It is very good as is and an awesome base to make just the way you like it.  I prefer chowder to be a bit thinner, I didn't think the carrots added much to it and wanted more potatoes. I followed other suggestions to first brown and crumble about a 1/4 lb bacon to stir in at the end. I increased potatoes to 3 cups and substituted 1 cup corn for carrots. I decreased to 1/2 cup flour and use 2 cups half & half and 2 cup skim milk instead of quart half & half. I have used leftover fresh clams as well as the canned and both are good. I do prefer the chopped clams to the minced.
All of these adjustments took place over many excellent batches of a very good recipe to start with.

The recipe as is warrants 4 stars, but with the additions of bacon, bacon grease, and bottled clam juice (in place of water) as suggested by many reviewers, it's a 5 star recipe.  In the summer you might go with a slightly lighter chowder by subbing milk for some or all of the half-n-half.  In the winter we love it hearty, as is.  Another delicious variation is to dice 1 to 2 cups of white fish, like haddock, and use that in place of the canned clams.  In step 1, simmer veggies in clam juice until almost tender. Then add fish and continue simmering until it is flaky.  I still used bottle clam juice when using fish.

I added bacon as others suggested, and cooked the onion with the bacon. Used spelt flour for gluten free. Didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar. Puréed the veggies slightly before adding the cream mixture.  This was very good. I would not purée the veggies the next time.

Great basic recipe. I have made this recipe a number of times and my family loves it. I do modify it to our liking by seasoning the veggies with seasonal all, onion and garlic powder, adding a little rosmary and tyme, and sometimes a splash of chicken broth with water replacing the yucky canned juice, and once even added scallops Yum!. My mods definitely change this recipe from being a classic clam chowder, but I'm sure glad I found it because it's still pretty good as is in my opinion.

Delicious with the bacon modification. Be careful with the bacon proportions though.  I used 4 slices of Nueskes, which is a high quality brand with a potent flavor.  The chowder takes on a heavy bacon flavor.  Still delicious, but you lose the clam aspect.

I needed to add lots of additional spices.  I used poultry seasoning, more pepper, onion powder.  Tasted kinda "floury" but everyone gobbled it up.

YUUUMMMMEEEEEE!!!!!   It took me two times making it incorrectly (I kept adding the clams in the beginning) before finally getting it right and boy oh boy was it good. I will need to type up this recipe reminding me to hold back the clams.   I also only had 1 can of clams instead of 3, but it was still just "clammy" enough.  I did the bacon suggestion as well.  It made it perfect.  Yes, it was a little on the thick side but it was cold and snowy outside and just right for the day.  I will definitely make this again.  Oh yeah, I got this recipe out of my magazine and it has a few different things listed even though its the same title/chef.  It has the use of a bottle of clam broth to go with the 3 cans of clams.

My husband and I absolutely loved this!  Will definitely make it again.  I also fried about 10 pieces of bacon and put the bacon grease in with the veggies when cooking.  Then crumbled the bacon on top when serving it which adds flavor.  Yum!

Made recipe exactly except had home canned diced clams so I probably had less juice. Liked that the veggies cooked in the juice. I didn't use bacon like some other reviewers suggested because this is CLAM chowder, not potato soup with clams! Vinegar is a must. Had to thin the final product a little as my husband thought it was too thick.

This was a yum! Followed the recipe except for using clam broth instead of water. I am my own worst critic and I loved this. I used chopped clams canned and fresh and small canned baby clams. Pioneer girl's best clam chowder is my best clam chowder too. This was so fun!

If dairy doesn't agree with your stomach, you can omit the butter and half-half.   Here's how.... Soak 1 c. raw cashews for 2 hours or overnight.  Drain and blend cashews with 1-8 oz bottle clam juice and 2-3 t. cornstarch.  Blend till it is smooth and silky - no nutty lumps.  Add this to the veggie mixture at step #2 of the recipe and use more water to thin chowder to the right consistency.  Heat through 2-4 min, and move onto step #3.

This is a nice and easy clam chowder recipe. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked six slices of bacon to crumble into the soup and then cooked the vegetables (omitted the carrots) in the bacon grease. I also used a bottle of clam juice instead of water. The red wine vinegar is the key to this recipe, don't skip it.

Other viewers use nacon for extra flavor, but I used some smoked turkey wing to add some flavor and less fat. Believe it or not, it worked like a charm. Whenever I don't have red wine vinegar, I just sub some white wine (Moscato) and it's just as good. Most of the time I add shrimp, scallops and oysters also. My husband loves this, and I'm quite fond of it as well.

Great recipe!  I made it with the addition of the common reviews and resaved as My Best Clam Chowder II.  Basically added bacon, bay leaves, thyme, 5 cans clams and clam juice instead of water

Very delicious. Followed it pretty close except had no red wine vinager, which is too bad because many others said that was the ingredient that really kicked this up a notch. But still turned out great. Next time I will sub the water for clam juice and add more clams.  Used more milk than half and half to cut the calories just a bit. Added a little Old Bay too. Very delish. Will be making again!

I think the red wine vinegar is really optional. I tasted it before and after. I loved it before, not so much right after, but then once it sat for a little while, I couldn't really tell the difference, so either way it turns out fine (though, I only added 1 T and not the 2 called for).  I used clam juice in place of the water (3 bottles), and I poured the juices from 4 cans of minced and chopped clams into the pot as well.  Once the veggies were softened, I used a potato masher to mash it for a few seconds, to break up the potatoes a bit, because I like a thicker consistency. Also, I used half bacon grease and half butter for the roux, and  3 T. of cornstarch and 2 T of flour, rather than 3/4 cup of flour (I'm gluten sensitive, so I try to avoid wheat as much as I can).  I was worried it would all be too runny once I combined everything together, but it was the perfect consistency. I did let the clam juice and veggies reduce quite a bit, but there was still plenty of liquid in the pot before adding the half and half mixture.  Overall, I was very pleased.

very easy to make and i agree with above comments. It was too thick and I would use bacon to saute veggies and I would use whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2.. next time i'll try it. I'll definitely keep this recipe

This was very yummy, super creamy! I tweaked it a little, I added chicken base to the water/clam juice. I added a couple strips of bacon. I didn't use the vinegar. Other than that, I was very please with the out come!

Very good recipe.  I tasted the soup before I added the vinegar and then after. I liked it better without the vinegar.  I also used milk instead of half and half and the thickness was just right.  I also added bacon fat.

I really liked the recipe as-is and I would give it four stars. On the second go around I only dumped in half of the water from the vegetable boil. (the recipe was not real clear if it was all to be used or drained) I also used 2 tsp of my favorite Cajun seasoning dumped into the rue right before adding the half and half. I think it gave it a great kick and the chowder had just the right amount of thickness for my liking. With the small adjustments I would easily say five stars.

Followed reviews and used bacon, extra clam juice, unsalted butter and more clams.  Don't use Old Bay--too salty.  Used almond milk rather than cream.

Have used this as a base recipe.  I like to add a couple of diced red and green bell peppers to the veggies. Adds a little extra to the flavor.

Family said it was the best clam chowder they have ever had. I loved it too, but the calories!!! I cut my vegetables pretty small and they did cook fairly quickly, so I would recommend checking them frequently right from the start. (I would have preferred to have turned off the burner the moment the veggies became tender.) I cooked the half and half mixture until it was very thick prior to adding the vegetables, since I knew I would be watering it down with the clam juice/water mixture. I never did add all of the clam juice/water, just enough to get the consistency I was looking for in the clam chowder.  I did make one MISTAKE, I added Balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. I thought maybe I had ruined the dish, but it was delicious with the Balsamic. Not sure if I would make again, even though it was very good because of the calories involved.

Tasty clam chowder recipe! The red-wine vinegar that I used must have been really strong, as I thought it was a bit too over powering. Will cut it back next time - probably to 1 tablespoon.

Two of my adult daughters told me this is their "go to" clam chowder recipe so I decided to try it since DH and I love clam chowder, especially on cold days!This recipe is very close to the one I normally make and is very good but we found it to be a bit too "milky" tasting so I'll go back to my original way of making chowder.

My children are going through food testing so we needed to make this dairy free. I used coconut milk instead of half-and-half. I also added Old Bay Seasoning and white pepper. Didn't try the bacon this time around. This was wonderful! The coconut milk added a slight sweetness. I think it would be really good countered with bacon and liquid smoke.

I love clam chowder, but have never made it before. I must say I loved this!  I will make again soon.  I left out the carrots, simply because I didn't have them and think I will continue to leave them out as I don't see them adding anything to this.  I took others suggestions and fried a few strips of bacon first and added veggies to this, though next time I will brown up some of the onion first and try it that way before adding the liquid.  I added clam juice and some water to make the liquid and recommend this for a more clam flavor.  I will add more clams to my next batch for more flavor, but bought all the store had at the time and didn't want to run out to another store.  I cooked my cream mixture till it was nice and thick and it ended up being perfect when added to liquid.  I liked the nice creamy, rich texture of the soup.  Although this is not the healthy version of the soup, it is a great treat.

Nevertheless New England Clam Chowder has always been one of my
favorite dishes. Love at first bite.  This recipe yielded the best NECC
I have ever eaten.  And thanks to PIONEERGIRL, I made it myself! (Big grin.)
I made it by the recipe with the exception, like others, I cooked bacon to
use as a topping and cooked the onions in the bacon grease. Everything else
by the recipe. And I do want to echo: The vinegar makes this chowder. Who
woudda thunk it? Many, many thanks PIONEERGIRL.

This is one of the best clam chowders we have made!!  We used real steamed clams and 1 can of canned with the juice and it turned out amazing!!!  Great for meals the next day too! This is not a recipe for those on a diet. :-)

I tried this recipe but I also followed chefsingledad's recipe and added the bacon. It was delicious. I've made it for family and friends and they loved it.

This truly was the best Clam chowder I ever put in my mouth. After reading the reviews, I will try adding the bacon and cooking all of it in the iron skillet. Don't know how this recipe can be improved but
after reading some of the reviews, I will try cooking the bacon in the skillet and cooking the veggies in the drippings and  adding the chopped bacon. ---- Barbara526

Excellent recipe. I only used one pot. Just before the veggies were done I added the cream and cornstarch/water mixture. I also used heavy cream instead of half and half. Quick & easy & tasty.

It's a pretty good recipe.  It's not particularly outstanding but it's not bad.  I was hoping for a creamier consistency but it was a little on the thin side for me.  Next time I plan on using heavy cream instead of half and half - I'm not one to count calories.

I made a few changes to this recipe which made it a 5 star in my house ! I used freshly shucked little neck clams and oysters which made all the difference in flavor. I also used 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cups half and half. I did not have any red wine vinegar so I used cider vinegar and I also added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for some kick. Absolutely delicious!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I added only 2 cups of half & half and the rest milk. It was a little too thick, so I added a little more milk at the end. I also only used half of the butter to cut down a few calories.

Loved it.  My husband said it was the best clam chowder he ever had.  I added the bacons, as suggested, and that made all the difference, I think.  Super creamy and tasty.

Delicious!  My kids and husband said better than some coastal restaurants in San Francisco and Monterey!   I happened to have some bacon oil left from breakfast this morning so used that to sauté the vegetables.  I added 2 cloves garlic. I used the half and half and added fresh parsley and garlic salt.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used 1T rice vinegar + 1T red wine cooking sherry.  Came out very creamy and rich!  A small bowl was satisfying.  I will definitely make this again.

This is my favorite clam chowder. I modify it slightly. I add a lot of water to the veggies, a lot more veggies, and I don't put in the red wine vinegar. But this is a great recipe even if I put my own twist on it.

Clam chowder is not my thing but it is my husbands and he said this is the best he has ever had or it would be if I cooked the veggies down a bit.  I did the bacon grease as others suggested.  I used 2 cans of minced clams and 2 cans of chopped clams.  I used 8 oz of clam juice instead of water and I cut the carrots down to 1/2 a cup of shredded.  I like clam chowder, I've certainly had it before however it is not something I would order in a restaurant but this was good.  Next time I will saute the onion and celery and carrots in the bacon grease for a little bit before covering them with the clam juice per my husbands request and he said although it isn't typical some corn might be good in here.... Also one more can of chopped clams.....I think I will do that.

I made this recipe for my husband's special birthday supper at his request and I had never made home made clam Chowder before but we both have ate many others recipes and I have to tell everyone that not only was this so easy to make but it turned out more fantastic than we both ever imagined and will for certain make this again.  I can also see great possibilities using other veggies instead of the clams for a hearty winter Chowder

I followed the recipe exactly as listed.It was extremely starchy, thick and lacked clam flavor. In fact, it could have passed for a type of mashed potatoes or puree. I'm going to try it again with the suggestions of the reviewers (bacon grease, milk, cooking the roux down, all clam juice-no water, and both diced and minced clams). Hopefully I will have better luck.

I added about 6 pieces of chopped bacon cooked with drippings, and added a touch of liquid smoke...this was my first clam chowder and we loved it!  Thanks :)

This was my first time making clam chowder and was worried I'd mess up on cooking in the flour, but I kept mixing and it was fine.  I'd like more flavor, so added Old Bay and followed the suggestion to add bacon to it! I didn't have any red wine vinegar and I think it tasted great without it. Will definitely make this my go-to recipe for clam chowder!

I have made this twice with rave reviews from family and friends.  I did add more Clams that what the receipe said.  Single receipe I added 2 extra cans.  Yum!! Forgot to say, I also used Fat Free Half and Half and Smart balance for the Rhue the second time and it was as good as the first!

It was a little too liquidy for chowder. Also, there was a lack of seasoning.

Great recipe, and adding the fat from some strips of bacon to replace part of the butter (I use three bacon strips' fat to replace 1/4 c), it tastes fantastic! However, I do not use the actual bacon itself as I have tried crumbling and using one, two and three strips at different times, and the whole family prefers the slight smoky flavour to a full-on bacon-y one.

I make this once a week and EVERYONE (hubby, son, MIL, FIL...moi) all looks forward to it!

Add Pillsbury's Corn Biscuits (come in cans of 8) and you have a cracker meal!

This was a classic recipe that went over extremely well.  Loved the addition of carrots.  I also cooked down 5 pieces of bacon and used the grease with the clam juice to cook the vegetables down.  In addition I included about a cup of red wine to the cooking vegetables.  I added the crumbled bacon in the end with cooked steamers (cleaned), thawed clams, and already cooked halibut (other white fish would be fine as well).  Rave reviews from those that grew up on clam chowder in Maine on the coast there entire life (best I have ever had).  I did utilize light cream instead of half and half and also had to add more water as it was too thick.  Perhaps cut down on the amount of flour, 3/4 cup is a bit much.  Enjoy!

First and foremost. THIS RECIPE IS DELICIOUS. Exactly as it is written. Period. Make it, make it now. You will wonder where it has been all of your life. Yes, use the vinegar. Don't skip it, it matters. If you have any other shellfish in your fridge/freezer, throw it in. Why not. Its delicious, enjoy.

We really liked this - hubby and oldest son raved.  I did start with bacon, like many reviewers suggested and I seasoned with salt and pepper as I went instead of at the end.  I reduced the butter and flour to 1/2 cup each.   Still plenty thick.  When I tasted for seasoning near the end of cooking it was so good that I completely forgot to add the red wine vinegar.

Suprisingly disappointing! I made the recipe exactly as it is written and just found it very bland and even sweet, which was not right for clam chowder. I am so sad because I had high hopes bases on the reviews and doubled the recipe. That was a lot of work for something that is so/so. I'll be looking for a better recipe. Thanks anyway

This is a good recipe.  I read a bunch of the reviews and used some of the suggestions (no water, all clam juice, bacon grease and butter in the roux) and I used 4 cans of clams.  Used all other ingredients as the recipe stated.  Really good!

This was good and the bacon idea worked well. It did not have the clam taste I usually get, maybe because they were canned clams. The texture was nice and would make again.

Something is just off.  Too much flour maybe?  Made as written except fried bacon and added that to the veggies. Had a very fishy taste, but other than that was kind of bland.

This was excellent and super easy!  The only change I made is to use chicken stock (along with the clam juice) instead of water to cook the vegetables in.

My wife enjoyed this recipe - unfortunately the carrots made it slightly too sweet for me. Next time I'll either omit the carrots or cut way down on the quantity.

This is a decent recipe by itself, but serves more as a base.  We enjoyed the texture, but it was missing something in flavor.  After reading some of the other reviews will try some of their suggestions the next time around.

Very yummy chowder. I, too, added the bacon and it really kicked up the flavor. One word of warning, however. If you are like me and enjoy adding Tabasco or another hot sauce to your bowl, I would omit the vinegar ( as tasty as it is). Having both makes the soup a bit too acidic.

Hubby loved it. I thought it was just ok. Will definitely make again but with modifications. Will use clam juice instead of water for more of a clam taste. Will also use more milk & less half & half and less flour as I thought this was too thick. Overall, a good base recipe.

My favorite recipe yet. I was raised in the Maritimes in the 60s and this chowder brought back many memories. The Red Wine vinegar is quite a surprise. I  now use it on my French Onion Soup. Thanks Pioneer.

Good  recipe.  We did make some minor changes . . . we used 100% clam juice, no h2o.  We also sprinkled about 1/4 lb of crispy bacon into the finished soup.  Was satisfying and simple to make.

I made this recipe using 4 cans of whole baby clams and followed the advise of others and added 6 strips of bacon.  It turned out very good, but I thought it could use more clam flavor.  Next time I will omit any water and will just use clam juice with the veggies.  A keeper!!

This recipe was easy with outstanding results. We live in the Northeast and really enjoy our "chowdas". I did add about four or five slices of cooked bacon crumbled and had to make this twice in one week because of the raves from family and friends.  Very creamy and great tasting. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty darn good. Few changes I made: used red potatoes. Also used clam juice instead of water and added in the bacon grease to the veggies as well as crumbled bacon to the end broth. I also added a bit of heavy cream to thicken the broth and used white and black pepper. Turned out yummy

Very good start!  I will definitely add bacon or tasso ham next time.  It's a little lacking in flavor, but I loved the red wine vinegar.

I have tried several clam chowder recipes!  This is the best.

I have also made it gluten free by using corn starch in stead of flour.  Just cut the corn starch in 1/2 of what the recipe calls for flour.

Delicious!

Well received by the entire family (which, in itself, is a feat!).  I doubled the recipe, and added a full pound of crumbled bacon (I added slightly less butter for the roux, using bacon drippings instead).  Because I added so much bacon, next time I would probably add an extra can of clams.  But, the taste was amazing nonetheless!

a keeper! Made my roux with bacon grease and added a smidge of liquid smoke as well. While this recipe said 8 servings, it was just enough for 4 adults as mains, with spinach hot pockets on the side.

The vegetable portion with the clam juice was fine, however the cream mixture was very very thick, after combining the 2 parts, the ladle actually will rest on the top of the soup without sinking.I think it probably would work with half of the flour called for.  I added 2 cups of chicken to thin a little.  Also  I added the vinegar as many reviewers thought it added,but be prepared you will have a vinegar taste which is fantastic with bean soup, but not what I expect with a chowde

Yummy, Yummy Yummy. I've never cared for clam chowder. Made this for my husband with no intentions of eating any of it. Had it for dinner, then the next day for breakfast, and lunch and dinner again!! (I did add bacon bits) It is wonderful just the way it is!

Very creamy!  The vinegar really brought out the flavor.  This is my go to chowder recipe! I used clam nectar and did not use any water, bacon grease for the butter and bacon to replace some of the clams, savory and bay leaves.

It is both delicious and super easy. The second time I made it I dumped 4 oz. of processed cheese food (Velveeta) into the mix at the very end. Worked like a proverbial charm.

This was my first time making clam chowder. Wow!  It tasted like it came from a restaurant. I cooked 6 slices of bacon and then put the vegetables in with the drippings.  Crumbled up the bacon and added it when I mixed it all together. My family loved it!

I made this for my parents who love clam chowder.  I got a five star rating from them :). Even my husband who isn't a fan, liked it. My one change:  I used one pint half & half and one half skim milk.

definitely a good recipe.  bacon gives a great addition of flavor, and so does using seasoned pepper.  would also add that you should rinse your clams thoroughly to make sure all sand grains are washed away.  overall a very nice recipe.

Yummy!  I took advise from others and used bacon fat with the butter. That was a great idea. To add more flavor I cooked the veggies in broth.  Next time I will buy additional clam juice to replace some of the liquid as I like a stronger clam flavor.  I will also thin the soup as it was rather thick and while I am fine with thick, it would stretch out the soup while not sacrificing the flavor. Thanks for posting.

Followed recipe exactly. Wasn't thick enough so added a couple tablespoons of water with corn starch. Doesn't need bacon. Would be great with it but it would have tasted much different. Used the chunky clams.

It was great!  Cooked the onions and carrots in bacon grease, then added the potatoes.  I left out the celery but added garlic and LOVED it!  I thought it was delightful and will definitely make it again!

I love this recipe! It is my go to "clam" (or corn/ no clam, since I'm a vegetarian) chowder. I make it a few times per year and have since I found it two years ago. For the vegans/ vegetarians out there, simply replace the clam juice w 1+ cup of vegetable broth and if you are making corn chowder, put the excess liquid you have drained from the corn in to start. I have made this soup so many times and never experienced the lack of flavor some of the other reviews comment on. It may be because I start w vegetable broth and not the clam juice? I do tend to adjust seasonings as I taste to ensure it is flavorful enough (I do this w all recipes, though). Enjoy!

Famiky loved the recipe but I had to use my VitaMix because the roué was lumpy. I also added a half teaspoon of thyme and seasoned salt instead of table salt.

This was good, but not quite what I expected. It sort of had a sweet taste to it. I think next time I will skip the carrots and maybe use milk instead of half and half.

I used two cans of clams, two cans of evaporated milk and then regular milk to make 4 cups.  For the roux, use only 1/2 cup of marg and 1/2 cup of flour.  I chopped cooked bacon at the end and put it in. It was excellent.

This recipe was delicious. I did take the advice of others: Clam juice instead of water,added Old Bay, used some bacon salt for some smoke. My ENTIRE family of picky eaters loved it!

This makes a very nice this soup. The longer you thicken the cream, butter, flour mixture, the thicker it will be. Was a touch on the bland side though. I did not add bacon as I do not like that flavour but instead I added cocktail shrimp and crab meat as well as corn. Fabulous!

First time I tried this. It was excellent. Change nothing from the receipt, except I like a lot of clams, so 4 cans  made it right for me.  One of the best, other than Harray's in Las Vegas, the best clam chowder I have every had. Right on!

Awesome but I used the clam juice instead of water to soften veggies, also adding 1 tsp of oregano and 1/2 tsp of thyme while they cooked I also added corn instead of carrots which I didn't have on hand. I drained veggies set aside and used juice to make a roux. using cornstarch instead of flour. using both 1/2 & 1/2 cream and milk to make to your own consistency add veggies warm gently not to boil add clams heat and serve. cant wait to make it again

Perfect just use fresh clams not canned. Add 6 strips of crumbled bacon to the final product. Add 6 cloves of  minced garlic to veggies. Saute the vegetables for a few minutes in some of the bacon grease. Added 1/2 teaspoon of Bay Seasoning, garlic & onion powder for more flavor

This gets five stars with my modification. Instead of adding water to cover the vegetables, I added a bottle of clam juice. After putting it together and adding the clams, I added about one cup of bacon crumbles (store bought.) It had thickened so much from everything that I added another half bottle of clam juice. I also used 1 tsp of course kosher salt instead of 1 1/2 tsp regular salt. I've tried the other suggestion of cooking it in bacon grease but I think this method tastes way better and has more bacon flavor, believe it or not. It is really yummy in a bread bowl or served with Garlic Texas toast.

Recipe is great. I usually can't eat fishy stuff, but this didn't taste like it at all. The only thing I would change is to add corn. Other than that it was spot on as were the directions.

My husband's favorite. I usually use about 1 geoduck clam either fresh or frozen instead of using store bought. works well but is better the next day. Nice basic clam chowder.

very good the only thing I did different is I had to add about 1 TBSP of instant potatoes to thicken.  I don't know why mine didn't thicken with the butter and flour but till a really good recipe!

This is with out a doubt the BEST Clam Chowder recipe I have ever made, and it is so easy to make. I added a extra can of clams as I like more clams and I wanted the clam juice instead of water to cover the veggies. - Jenny

Nice recipe...per other reviewers, needs all FIVE cans of clams....get 2 minced, and 3 chopped cans clams.  Buy small clam juice to use instead of water.  Used 1/2 and 1/2 and also small amt heavy cream.  Thickened with cornstarch (1/3 cup) and water instead of flour.  Perfect consistency.  Hubby had a huge bowl to eat and we had 2 large Tupperware containers of leftovers.  Only takes about 30 mins to make, great for weeknight dinner.

So easy, and was a hit.  Will definitely keep in my recipe book.  I did add a few dry spices while heating in the pot... oregano, more pepper and a tad more salt, basil, a little crushed red pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.

At first hubby said "I've never chowder with carrots" but a few bites later he said that it was really good (and considering he's quite stingy with praise, THAT'S a big deal!). I'm thinking that the same recipe could be use for ham and potato soup too.  Thank you for sharing!

It is good soup.  I followed the recipe exactly but made the changes reccommended by others comments.  They cooked bacon the added the bacon grease to the veges and water to cook. Next time it might be good to not add the clams. The kids didn't like them.

Very good and easy to make clam chowder! For me it needed just 2 adjustments. The first being more clams. I used the recipe calc. to cut down to four servings , which called for 1 1/2 cans of clams. I put in 2 cans and was still a bit short. Next time I will use 3 cans to make 4 servings. The other adjustment was to add Old Bay seasoning with the salt and pepper to add a bit more seafood taste. I then baked an olive cheese spread on the bread and it was a meal fit for a King!

So delicious but 4 stars since I had to make changes. Here is what I changed:

-cooked 6 strips of bacon in skillet, then used the grease when cooking the veggies, added bacon at end of cokking
-used 4 cans of clams instead of 3. This was enough clam juice to cover the veggies so I didn't use any water
-scaled back the celery and increased the carrots (personal preference) as well as used 3 cups of sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes.

Overall, tasted great. Since I didn't use any water, I will scale back the salt next time as well as try healthier options to see if I can cut down some of the fat.

Very good!!!  I added shrimp, scallops and haddock and it was excellent seafood chowder.  My husband said it was probably the best he has ever tasted and he has tasted a lot, living in the Maritimes.  Next time I will add bacon, as suggested by others and that should put it over the top.

I made this for dinner tonight and loved it.  The only changes I made was that I added one more potato, cooked in the juice of the third can of clams and then mashed it up when tender and added to the soup.  Also, shredded the carrots.  Didn't add the bacon but may do that next time.  It was delish!!

I have been looking for a good clam chowder recipe without bacon for a while and I just hit the jackpot. Followed the recipe exactly as written (well I didn't add carrots). This is the best New England clam chowder ever!!! Thank you!

Made this yesterday, and have to agree that it is really quite delicious and easy to make.  I found that the drained clam juice was plenty of liquid to cook the veggies in.  And I used half 1% milk with the half-and-half to cut down on the richness (and fat).  It was still plenty thick for my husband, who prefers thicker cream soups.  I would like to try it with cooked, crumbled bacon another time, for extra flavor.  I liked the feature that changed the recipe for a different number of servings--made it for 4 servings instead of 8, since it was just for the two of us.

i too hate when people review recipes after they've majorly changed them but know that you can use half and half and regular milk combined and still have an amazing clam chowder!  this recipe is a keeper.  tastes like it's from a restaurant.  excellent!  i chopped the veggies the day before so when i made the recipe, i just tossed everything in.

I watched the video (very helpful) then made this recipe last night and it was outstanding (eating the leftovers for lunch right now as I type). I grew up in New England, but now live in Seattle. This is exactly how I would expect a great chowder to taste. Similar to other reviewers, I added some bacon. I also used three cans of chopped clams and added a small bottle of clam juice. I will definitely make this again. Thanks Pioneer Girl!

I have made this soup several times already and it was a HUGE hit every time. We aren't fans of the celery so I just added more potatoes. Definitely worth 5 stars.

YUM!!!  It was delicious and creamy - just the right consistancy for what I think chowder should be like.  Not the watery version I get at our local restaurants in Pittsburgh.  I added more clams and a little milk instead of a whole quart of cream.  I loved the carrots, celery, and the potatoes but I also added some peas and corn.

The vinegar gave it a sour cream taste. I would either cut that in half or eliminate it and add creole seasoning.

This was a great base recipe. There weren't nearly enough potatoes so we added about 3-4 times more. I skipped the red wine vinegar. I didn't wait until the end to season with salt I added salt through out the entire process. Thank you! This was the best clam chowder I've had nothing in new england was as good.

This was a fantastic recipe!!! So simple but it taste like you slaved all day! I used the bacon idea and simmered the veggies in the bacon fat. I also used Kosher salt instead of regular. Just superb!

Pretty good! But for 3 servings I added 2 teaspoons of flour and 1 teaspoon of butter and 2 extra teaspoons of red wine (substitute for red wine vinegar) and the taste was absolutely exquisite! It made it just creamy and buttery enough. Also, I added a generous amount of pepper.

This is the first recipe I've ever rated - I admit I used some of the recommendations of others, and I have to say it was amazing.  I made the clam chowder this past weekend for a community clambake - so I made enough for 30 people.  It was so easy to increase the recipe size, and I got more compliments than I ever imagined.  I was told it was the best clam chowder ever, and at the very least it was among the very best.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, and thanks for all the great suggestions for improving it! The most important improvements included using the bacon grease, cooking the flour long enough not to leave a pasty taste, using a little less vinegar (I used white balsamic rather than red wine), and adding the old bay.

Because the recipe was well explained, even someone like me -cooking impaired- was able to execute this wonderful, hearty dish. I used chopped clams, and just the clam juice from the cans. I served it on bread bowls: excellent!

Perfect for fall & winter nights!  It makes a ton of chowder.  I also increased the clams to 3 cans minced clams and 2 cans of whole clams.  I also used clam juice instead of water (it took the whole 8 oz. bottle).  I took other users advise and browned 5 strips of bacon before sauteed the vegetables and crumbled the bacon & chives over the top when served.  I will use a little more bacon next time and maybe even one more can of clams.  It was fabulous!  Thank you!

This recipe was delicious. I did not stray from the recipe given, except I used slightly less red wine vinegar because I was nervous of what it would do to the finished product. Made it with Ham & Swiss Sandwiches on thick cut sourdough bread and it was PERFECT!

This was a great chowder.  Made it for the first time for a group of friends and received lots of compliments.  There was not a drop left!!  The only thing I changed was added less butter and used fat free half and half to make it a little healthier.  Also, I forgot to add the vinegar at the end so I'm not sure how that would have made it different.  Took some others suggestions and had bacon bits on the side for those that wanted to sprinkle on top of the soup.  Definitely a keeper!!

Quick and easy, and a real crowd-pleaser. I usually add one or more of the following items to the basic recipe:
1. a dash of cayenne;
2. kernels from an ear of fresh corn -- I add this towards the end, because they don't need to cook much;
3. a diced red bell pepper, which I roast in a dry frypan until it scorches a little (the pepper, not the frypan);
4. some fresh herbs -- a bit of minced lemon sage is nice.
5. Last but not least -- whole milk instead of cream. Didn't miss the cream one bit.

This was wonderful. I did use the bacon and white wine vinegar instead of red. I also had to make it gluten free so used cornstarch instead of flour, but turned out amazing.   Thank you Pioneergirl and all you reviewers.

Good, basic recipe except for the red wine vinegar.  I used an 8 oz. bottle of clam juice instead of water to give it a bit of "tang".  I would not add vinegar to this!  Also, I substituted corn for the carrots but this is just my preference.

Made this and enjoyed it.  I did add more whole baby clams and some bacon.  Next time I will use 1cup of potatoes instead of 2cups.  Seemed like potato soup with clams instead of clam soup with potatoes.

I did not care for this recipe. For my taste, this is not what I have in mind when I want clam chowder. I think the vinegar was the problem. Thanks anyway.

Really good. Quick, easy, comforting. I mad this last night and my husband who insists he hates NE Clam Chowder admitted it was good. 

I took the suggestion of frying six slices of bacon and cooking the veggies in that first. I'm sure it made a big difference.

This is my first time making this and i just have to write how awesome clam chowder really is! It's creamy and filling. Tweaked the recipe a little after reading the reviews too. Only used one large pot (hate doing dishes), browned some bacon, removed them and let them drain. Then, I added the vegetables, water and clam juice to the bacon fat til tender. Added butter to pot. In medium bowl, measured out flour and mixed some half and half til smooth then added to pot. Poured rest of cream and heated through added clams. Forgot to add vinegar though. Soup was still great though! Thanks for the recipe.

The only thing we're changing is adding more clams, but we love clams!

Great recipe, my family and I loved it. I added the bacon like others had mentioned and I used whole clam meat that I cut up a bit, I wanted alot of clam and not too much potato. I cooked the bacon, drained most of the fat then added the vegetables, garlic and paprika then I added two bottles of clam juice since I diddnt by canned clams. Other than that I followed the given instructions. I will definately make this recipe again!

This was pretty good, but there was something about the vinager flavor that I didn't like. I will definitely make this again, but won't add the vinager and will add another can of clams as well as a little bacon.

This is an exceptional recipe with a few adjustments made from other reviewers.  I omitted the carrots (we live in Florida and I don't ever remember carrots in my chowder), used clam juice instead of water and sautéed the celery/onions with a scoop of bacon grease before adding the potatoes.  

It was really a very good recipe and I plan to make it over and over again.

I did as others suggested and used clam juice in place of water, bacon, sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease and still found this way to bland. The taste of the flour was too much. The consistency was and color were very good tho! To add some flavor I added some Sherry, not a good idea, it then tasted like stroganoff with a mild clam flavor.

I think I may have make a mistake in making this soup.  Clam chowder is my husbands favorite and he loved this soup(much better then the can, he said)  I think I will have to make this often.  :) the first time I made this I followed the directions except instead of adding water to cover the veggies I added a jar of clam juice.  The second time I did this and added the bacon and bacon grease like everyone else suggested.  this is a keeper, thanks

This was my first time making clam chowder and WOW - what a crowd pleaser.  My 10 & 8 year olds LOVED this recipe.   Made  a few modifications - added the salt, pepper, & a bit of thyme into the veggies while cooking.  Like other reviewers I added the veges to the bacon fat. Let the veges saute a bit in the pot before adding the clam juice.  Also, didn't add any water - instead used clam juice to cover veges..  Used condensed milk & skim milk in lieu of half & half.  Went well with "from scratch" biscuits (also from allrecipes).  Will ABSOLUTELY be making this again....and again....and again....

This was awesome!  I just finished eating it and had to rate it, it was so good.  I omitted the celery and forgot to mince an onion so I just added some onion powder instead.  I covered the veggies with clam juice rather than water for some more flavor.  Other then that I followed the recipe as stated.  It was very thick but I like it that way so I didn't thin it out.  This was definitely better than a lot of restaurants I've had clam chowder at and super simple to make.

This was so yummy! I followed the recipe, except I sautee the onions and veggies on a little bit of olive oil before cooking them. I agree with some other reviewers that the red wine vinegar does make a difference on the taste, it makes it slightly tangy. Thanks for the recipe, will make it again soon!

After reading some of the other reviews, I took some of the advice and fried 4 pieces of bacon then sauteed all of the veggies in the fat before adding the cooking liquid.  Didn't use water...bought extra clam juice.  Added hot sauce and garlic.  Delicious!  Will make again.  Next time I will add another can of clams.

Loved this soup. Thick and creamy. Was unsure about the red wine vinegar but it gave it a great flavour. If you like a stronger fish flavour you could use clam nectar instead of water.

I made this soup for dinner after the Christmas Parade. It was the best I've ever had and it was super simple.I added 4 strips of cooked crumbled bacon and 2 teaspoons of the bacon drippings. At the end along with couple dashes of  caynye pepper, a bit of garlic powder and frozen corn. Really Really good. It will now be a tradition.

My family thought this was the best. They were fighting over the left overs. I added more clams and shrimp and a little old Bay. I am planning on making again tonight but instead of shrimp I am adding Lobster, clams and scallops. This recipe will go in the recipe box.

I don't generally like clam chowder but my family love it. I actually liked this soup! The red wine vinegar made the soup! I did the bacon thing suggested by others, which I wouldn't skip. Due to picky eaters, I didn't add celery or carrots, but I did sprinkle in some celery seed. It was a little thicker than we liked so I think I'll cut back on the flour next time. Keeper.

Made this for Christmas Eve 2009 and am looking forward to serving it again this year. Huge hit with everyone! I did leave out the carrots and made a little more rue than was called for and it was GREAT!! Red wine vinegar makes a big difference.

Great chowder recipe! I followed others' advice and cooked 4 pieces of bacon first. I wiped out almost all of the grease, then cooked the veggies in the same pan with clam juice and water. I was trying to make it lower fat, so I used about 1/8 cup margarine instead of the butter. I mixed the flour with fat free 1/2 and 1/2 before pouring into butter so it wouldn't clump. I only had about 3 cups 1/2 and 1/2 so added an additional cup of fat free milk. Did not miss the fat at all. My two kids (9 and 6) both loved it, too.

I used 1/2 half-and-half with 1/2 cream and I cooked the veggies in bacon as others suggested.  Was so excited to try this as it looked so good.  By the look on my husbands face I knew it wasn't going to be served in this house again.  It was way too fishy tasting for us both and I thought it was way too creamy, which he liked.  I used canned baby whole clams.

Excellent! The red wine vinegar gives this chowder a hint of tartness.  I used two cups of carrots instead of one cup as directed because I love the texture and color of carrots.

Decades ago I went to a restraurant and was served the best clam chowder I had ever eaten and I have always compared every bowl of clam chowder to that one.  I have to say, this recipe is outstanding and is just like the clam chowder I had many moons ago.  I look foward to making this recipe many many times in the future.  Excellent!

Amazing!! This was my first attempt at clam chowder and it was SO easy. I made it low fat by using skim milk and only 2 tbsp butter & flour. My husband went back for 2nds, which is very rare!

I loved this recipe. After returning from the Cape a few weeks ago, I was craving clam chowder. This one tastes just as good as the one we had there. My only changes were adding bacon, an extra can of clams and substituting clam juice for the water as suggested by other reviewers.

Amazing.  Followed the recipe exactly except for only 1/2 cup butter and maybe 2/3 cup flour.  Also used fat free half and half.  Everyone loved it.  Kids all had seconds.  Tasted a little flourish at first but as it settled I couldn't taste the flour as I saw another reviewer say.  Anyways this was so quick to make and didn't make too much of a mess of the kitchen which goes along way for me.  Will be making this again

This is the first clam chowder I have ever made and it was a hit with my family.  I did use rendered bacon fat to saute the vegetables and cut the butter in half and supplemented with canola oil.  Really delicious and I plan on making it again.

Excellent!  I added more chopped clams, sauteed the onions in bacon fat, used fat-free half & half, no celery & carrots, less butter and thickened it with a little potato flakes.  Tried it without the vinegar and it was good.  After adding the vinegar it was fantastic.  Don't skip the red wine vinegar.  I myself didn't eat it with the bacon crumbles as some suggested because I loved it the way it was.  However the family had the bacon crumbles.  Everyone loved it.  I will be making this often this winter.  EDIT:  DON'T SKIP THE VINEGAR!  I now use vinegar on even the canned Campbells & Progresso stuff just so I can get close to the taste of this awesome chowder.  Dang this cook has it together!  My taste buds thank you!

This was great! I will add less carrots next time (maybe 1/2 a cup instead) because they added a little too much sweetness for my taste. Added cayenne pepper and a bay leaf (simmered with the veggies).

This was fantastic!!  The only thing I changed was to omit the carrots, used 2 cans chopped clams and 1 can whole baby clams...used the juice from all 3 cans to cover veggies and did not need to add any water.  This recipe will definitely go into my favorites folder!!  Thanks for sharing!!

Very good - excellent flavor.  It was a little too heavy for me.  I had to add milk to the leftovers because it congealed and was more of a paste than a soup.  If I made this again, I would use part half-and-half and part milk.

This recipe was delightful. I did make a slight change....we like lots of clams, so added 2 cans of minced clams & 2 cans of chopped clams. I also addded celery salt to the vegetable mixture while cooking, it added a nice aroma. This paired well with the rich creamy soup. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this several times and everyone that tasted it said it was awesome! It is even better after setting in the fridge for a few days as it seems to get a stronger clam taste to it.

This was absolutely delicious! the vineger is what really gives its wonderful flavor. Used all clam juice instead of water and like most ppl also fried up some bacon and sauteed veggies in the fat, along with clam juice. It was very hardy and filling I will make it again soon my husband loved it!

5 million stars! I always try clam chowder at restaurants and none can come close to how amazingly delicious this is. I made the recipe exactly as listed. The red wine vinegar is the key ingredient.

Excellent!  Stayed fairly close to the recipe, just followed the bacon addition that others have suggested and substituted 1 cup of the cream with 2% milk to tone down the richness a little (which I think just reflects personal preference, not a fault of the recipe).  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe - we all loved it!

Awesome!  I didn't have celery or carrots on hand and I used cider vinegar instead of the wine vinegar.  I had never made clam chowder before, but it was still easy to wow family and friends with my first attempt!

I tweaked it (as others have suggested) by adding the bacon and softening up the vegetables in the bacon fat.  I also didn't have any red wine vinegar, and substituted with apple cider vinegar.  It turned out fabulously.  Overall, a really good chowder!

I loved this chowder! This is the first time I ever made it and I could not believe how easy it was. This is excellent and easily adaptable to suit your own personal tastes. You can add bacon as other reviewers described, some hot peppers finely chopped to spice it up, or even drained diced tomatoes.  I served mine with some traditional Native American fry bread and it was a hit. The soup is very filling but I would recommend doubling the recipe for a larger family because it will go fast. Thanks for the recipe! I am sure that it will become a favorite in our home!

Made this when my husband and I had guests staying with us. Everyone absolutely loved it and were begging for the recipe! This is a thicker chowder so if you're looking for more of a soup, this may not be for you. This will most definitely be a regular in my home

Great flavor, I added chopped bacon for extra flavor and sauteed the onions, Very rich with all that butter and half and half. Nice and thick, I thinned it down with some 1 percent milk as it was really thick when finished.

LOVED IT!!!  This the best homemade clam chowder my family had EVER had. It was easy to follow and worth the work! We always make bread bowls with this chowder. Cut the tops off the bowls and spread butter across the top of the bowl and the top and under the broiler it goes. MMMMMM....

I made this recipe as written.  The family and I thought It was ok.  It was very sweet tasting, not as clammy as we would have liked or what we're used to in a good clam chowder recipe.  We did love the thick chowder consistency.  Next time I'll try adding more clams and using all clam juice.  Might even try adding some bacon to it.  It is an ok base recipe.  I just need to tweak it a quite a bit for our tastes.

if making gluten free use rice flour instead of all purpose baking flour. i found the all purpose flower gave the chowder a funny taste.  as others have said, it comes out very thick, so use milk instead of cream if you don't like that.  very tasty and easy to make. and the ingredients are cheap.

wonderful recipe. I only omitted celery because we dont like celery in our soup. and used more clam sauce than water... and substituted half the cream for 2% to cut down on fat but it turned out deliciously.  I would test it after adding the salt and then the first tbsp. of vinegar so you dont add too much of either....yuuuummmmmy!

This was really yummy.  I followed others advice and cooked bacon and also veggies in bacon.  I added some thyme and a splash of tabasco. I also crumbled up the bacon and next time I might leave this step out.  I also added 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar.  So good.

Very good chowder. I used a can of oysters and a can of clams for variety, plus I used sherry since I had no red wine vinegar. Delicious!

This was amazing!  Used the bacon suggestion, made it GLUTEN FREE by thickening it with garbanzo bean flour and a little cornstarch. Also added a bottle of clam juice.....YUM!

It was a little thicker than I prefer for soup and not as flavorful as people said it was.  I made no changes so this is on the original recipe.

this was the BEST... I added more clam's and more potatoes because we love clam chowder thick. Was easy to make once everything was collected. Will for sure make it again (but will have more for left overs)

Great recipe. I did use half and half for half of the amount and 2% milk for the other half. Still very creamy but cut down on some of the fat. i left out the carrots.

Amazing!  I made this for my husbands birthday, and was quite pleased with the results.  It is very thick, just like the resturaunts, and the vinegar gives it a great taste.  I used goats milk (we have dairy goats, and I am always looking for ways to use it), and added bacon.  I also cooked the onion, and celery in the bacon greese.  The only thing I don't like is the high calories.   It was also pretty quick and easy. Try it, you won't be disapointed.

This is now my go to recipe for clam chowder. My fiance and I like ours a bit more chunky so I add extra potatos, carrots, and celery. Other than that I make this exactly like the recipe says!

This soup is truely restaurant quality...or better! My husband and I made this on a cold, rainy day and it more than hit the spot. We were really impressed with ourselves...lol! We took the advice of someone else and added the bacon grease for flavor. What a treat! Thanks for this amazing recipe!!!!

So yummy. What I did different was added about a cup of milk to the half and half mixture to loosen up the thickness a bit. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Don't know if this hurt the taste or not but sure was good. I also only added one can of clams since I wasnt sure how my family would react to the taste. I will gradually add more clams each time I make this recipe to see if they still like it.

This was awesome! I made it as written except that I did saute the veggies in some bacon grease or a few minutes before adding the clam juice and water. Also, in place of 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, I used bacon salt for a little extra bacon flavor. It turned out great and I will definitely use this recipe anytime I make clam chowder :)

This was really good!  I would DEFINITELY recommend adding the vinegar.  It sounds a little unusual but it adds that extra "something"! I cut the butter and flour down to half a cup and it still turned out great! I also used a food processor for the carrots, onions, and celery and it was perfect! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Great recipe!  I also cooked about 4 strips of bacon (which i chopped and added later) then cooked the vegetables in the grease for a few minutes before adding the clam juice (all clam juice, no water).  I used heavy cream instead of the 1/2 & 1/2, but ended up having to add about a cup or two of 1%milk because it looked too thick.  I think I would have been fine either way because you get a nice texture once you add all the juice and veges. I went with 2 cans of whole baby clams and 1 can chopped. Next time i'll probably throw in a can of minced too and maybe even another can of the whole ones.  I added a tiny bit of nutmeg and cumin at the end for complexity.    Definitely restaurant quality..and easy too!

First time I've made homemade Clam Chowder other than the cheating method ala cream of celery soup..which was good, but not the real thing.  I must say this recipe proved to be a real winner...I did do the bacon addition as recommended by some other reviewers.  It was fabulous!  It was our Christmas Eve dinner!!  I had one person say, it was "the best clam chowder I have ever had".  Wow!  Well, meantime, I have enjoyed it for the last couple days, of course, thinning out, once with 1/2 AND 1/2 AND today with fat free milk...It only got better ( of course, little tobasco sauce just added another dimension).   Thanks, PIONEERGIRL for a great recipe.  I look forward to when I can serve it to guests the next time..a true keeper.

This is an excellent recipe! I made a few changes though. I added a bit of thyme time at the end and used 3 table spoons of red wine vineager-it tasted deliciousl. Also, for thickening I used cornstarch instead of flour, used much less butter than is recommended--only 1 table spoon, and 1 quart or a bit more of 2 percent milk. It still tastes great. Oh, and I also added more vegetables, because I like the taste of celery and carrots. Yum!

Originally I gave this recipe 4 stars. The first time I made it I used fat free half-and-half, and I think that is what made it sweeter than I would prefer. After making it again, with some changes, I give this 5 stars. As far as changes, I use 5 cans CHOPPED clams, 3 cups cubed potatoes, and light cream instead of half-and-half. Also, instead of using water to completely cover the vegetables, I used clam juice. It came out fantastic! Very thick and creamy (which is fine with me). It it is too thick, you can always substitute some milk for maybe half the cream to thin in out a bit. I might try that sometime. I also plan to up the recipe and try 7 cans of chopped clams. Can't have too many clams. Overall, great recipe.

I used 1% milk in place of half of the cream and left out the carrots; added one extra cup of potatoes instead and one extra can of clams. It was so good.  The whole family loved it!

One bowl was gone in no time and we had to have another.  This recipe is delicious, so much flavor. I added the browned bacon as suggested by others.

I agree with people who said they could taste the flour.  I added more clams and a jar of clam juice but didn't help much.  Would not make this again.

My husband and I both LOVED this recipe.  I did add a little milk at the end to cut the richness of it and to thin it out a little.

This was delicious - I grew up in New England and have very set opinions about chowdah - accordingly, I used milk instead of half and half because chowder should not be too thick. The butter and flour roux more than does the trick. The vinegar was the surprise ingredient for me and it definitely added that special zing at the end.

I was a little worried after reading some of the negative comments, but this was a great recipe! I think it would be a 5 star with the following changes: I also cooked the vegetables in the bacon grease, I would leave out the carrots because it is a little odd in a chowder, and I would definitely add a 4th can of clams and juice to give it that extra taste. I also added 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, used only 3 or 4 tablespoons of flour and thickened later if I needed, and I also only used about 3/4 quart of half and half. I will definitely be making this again! Very easy and delicious. Thanks!

I loved this recipe.  Simple, easy, but so delicious.  The red wine vinegar sounds weird, but makes a huge difference.  I cooked 4 slices of bacon ad sauteed the vegetables for a little while.  I also used red potatoes and they were great.

This was better than any restaurant chowders! My family raved over it. I did add bacon and used clam juice instead of water. I forgot the red wine vinegar, but it was still amazing. This will be a regular recipe for my family forever. I served it with soft breadsticks. AMAZING!!! Thank you so much for sharing this!

Very good, I am sure the bacon would give it more taste, but I did not have it today and I did not miss it. I saw another recipe added Dill and I did put some in, and everyone liked it. I was afraid the vinegar would cut/curdle the milk but it did not. It was served for dinner and no one asked for anything else, very satisfying and filling. Will make it again and again. Thanks...

Pretty good. I liked that it was a thick chowder. I omitted the carrots and did not have celery on hand, but it probably would've benefitted from the celery... I felt like something small was missing. Other than that, one of the better recipes I have tried.

I didnt feel this soup had that clamy flavor to it. It probably needs clam juice instead of adding water to the veggies. This soup was good and the family enjoyed it.

I have not tried this yet. I only have a question about this recipe. I do not see how much water I'm supposed to use in this recipe, or am I reading the instructions incorrectly...? Please email me at flippin21inlv@yahoo.com so I can get the recipe right. I love clam chowder and I have not found any good chowder since I moved to Vegas....

Good and creamy soup. It was just what I was looking for. I did make a few changes hence the 4 rating. I cooked 4 pieces of bacon til crispy. Removed, crumbled and saved. Sauteed vegs except potatoe until softened. I had some fresh clams so when I cooked them I used their broth instead of water in the recipe. YUM! I followed the rest of the cooking instructions. At the end crumbled the bacon on top. Best clam chowder I ever had!!!!!

Thanks for such a great recipe! I'm still finding my way in the kitchen, but this was an easy and just about fool proof recipe. I followed the instructions and used fat-free half and half instead of regular. When my family described how yummy it was, they said it was creamy, rich, and slightly sweet. I will definitely make this again! Thanks  :)

I know I know people hate it when you alter the recipe and then you post a review on it, but I wanted to add my little tweak to it and post it so that others might like it that way.. Instead of 3 cans of clams I only did 2, and then I also added quarter pound of shrimp meat (those little cooked shrimps) and a quarter pound of scallops (cut them small, and pan fried them with some butter and garlic)..and instead of carrots...that i forgot to buy..i just put in mushrooms, lol that was really really good! I highly recommend adding in some more seafood to make it a seafood chowder..so hearty and good! Oh! Definitely use fresh clams if you can, that's the only thing that I would do differently.

Made this chowder last night because we needed something to do with a recently caught geoduck. Got two cans of clams as well for their juice and to make the chowder extra clammy. Substituted one cup milk for part of the half and half and also mashed one and a half boiled potatoes into the broth to make it thicker. Also added some fresh dill. The red wine vinegar is a GREAT touch. Really happy to have leftovers for lunch today.

This was my first attempt at Clam Chowder.  It was very good.  I used the suggestion of another and added 6 strips of cooked crumbled bacon.  I also sauteed the veggies in some of the bacon grease and then added the clam juice till the veggies were tender.  I also added cut up cooked shrimp and some flaked crab meat.  I did not add the red wine vinegar.  It was awesome and my boyfriend loved it and I've made it now several times.  Thanks -Great recipe!

Great recipe. I was looking for one without bacon. Only made two changes - added bottled clam juice to thin out, used fat free half and half to cut some calories. This is a keeper.

Pretty good.  I do recommend using half of the half and half and using milk for the other half because I used half milk and half half and half and it ended up rich.  I may even cut back on the half and half more next time.  I substituted one can of minced clams for chopped clams to get a little more of a clam flavor.

This is absolutely the best clam chowder. The only thing I did different was a add a bottle of clam juice to it. I also omitted the carrots. This recipe is a definate keeper.  Love it.

Used chopped clams as suggested and only had half the amount of cream so I used whole milk to make up the rest and it was still wonderful!!  My husband says it's a keeper! Thanks!

This recipe was awesome and soo easy. I will NEVER buy canned clam chowder again, especially because they never seem to put enough clam in there. I didn't change a thing and it came out great!

The perfect recipe, with one exception, the vinegar.  The vinegar makes it too pungent for my tastes.  Next time around, I'd skip the vinegar and add some shrimp.

OK - needed more flavor.  I used clam base and would have added bacon if it wasn't that its Ash Wednesday and we don't eat meat....  Probably won't make again. - I'll keep looking.

Very good followed other people's additions, my kids didn't care for the carrots. They thought it made it taste like vegetable soup instead of clam chowder. Will make again just omit the carrots.  Oh and bacon is a must!

Yummy.  I used 2% milk instead of the half-and-half and it was still plenty thick.  Also, I used 3 potatoes, which worked out to be about 4 cups.

Wonderful soup!  My husband says the best he's ever tasted.  I followed the advice of others and fried up some bacon and cooked the veggies in the bacon fat.  I also crumbled the bacon and added it to the soup.  I will make this again.

The red wine vinegar gave the dish it's unique in a good way taste.  Followed other reviewers tips with frying a few strips of bacon and sauteing the onions in the bacon fat before proceeding with all the directions as stated.  I also didn't add any water to the boil but used all clam juice instead.

This is an awesome clam chowder recipe.  I too think the red wine vinegar makes the flavor better.  I used 3 cans chopped and 2 cans minced clams.  I served this soup with some crusty french bread.  It was fantastic!  Will make again!!!

I just made this recipe for some friends and it got rave reviews!  I made it once already following original instructions and it was awesome.  Followed some other advice and added bacon, using some of the bacon grease (just some...) to sautee the veggies.  I did have to thin out a bit to personal preference.  One added extra is I put a dash or two of Tabasco sauce in my bowl of soup to give it a little extra kick.  

Both the original and custom recipes are awesome and I highly recommend making this!

This was good although I think I would have preferred it with fresh clams. It is very rich tho so be prepared to blow your diet. I will probably make this again on a cold winter day.

This was fairly good. Left out the red wine vinegar as I didn't have any & used vegetable broth in place of the water. Also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. It was strangely a little sweeter than normal chowder...perhaps from the carrots?

Easy Easy Easy! The winter here in Chicago get cold so I made this two nights ago.  I don't eat pork so I didn't make the adjustments some reviewers suggested and my chowder was soooo good.  As the recipe suggests don't add the clams until right before serving.  I added mine a little too early and they were a little tough, but my BF didn't seem to notice at all!  Enjoy!

This chowder was tasty. I did add a bit of white wine and garlic salt and liked the result. I was leary of the redwine vinegar but decided to try it because of the reviews. It was a great decicion.

So good! Better than my favorite restaurant's recipe. My only change was that I was too lazy to dice up potatoes so I added a can of cream of potato soup. The results were even better than when I followed the recipe to the letter. However I did add 1/2 cup of water to keep it from getting too thick. yummy!

Really a great chowder... I would give it 5 but we feel it needs just a little something more so I'm going to give it 4 stars... but still a great chowder!  I followed the suggestion of using the bacon grease to sautee the onions, celery, carrots & potatoes.  I also used whole milk vs. half and half but I do that with every chowder recipe.  We had a blizzard the day I made this and didn't realize I was out of red wine vinegar and no stores were open, so we took a little out and stirred in balsamic... we did the same for rice vinegar and sherry... finally we found that Worchestershire sauce was really good... I added maybe a half tablespoon as it is a very strong flavor.  

Definately a keeper!  I'm just going to see if I can figure out what is missing... it's very slight but we feel it just needs a little something... just not sure what it is yet!  This is certainly worth a try!  :-)

Very yummy and easy clam chowder recipe. The red wine vinegar really makes this dish. I also added bacon and used the dripping to sautee the onion and celery before adding the potatoes and clam juice. I used 4 cans of clams (2 chopped, 2 minced), so I had enough juice to cover the veggies. I couldn't get myself to use all that butter so I substituted most of it with olive oil. I also used 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and 2 cups 1% milk. The richness is definitely still there! Great recipe for a cold and windy day.

I love this recipe and have been making it for a couple of years now.  It is delicious and easy. The only changes I make are to add crumbled cooked bacon and I only put in one tablespoon of red wine vinegar.

I REALLY wanted to like this recipe, but it turned out WAY too thick and creamy.  The cream overpowered the taste of the clams and the potatoes.  I will try some of the suggestions and use 2 cups milk/2 cups craeamer.

super yummy clam chowder! I'm a newbie in cooking and I was so surprised that my fav. soup is actually so easy to make. next time I will try 2 cups half/half cream + 2 cups milk, in order to thin it down a tiny bit. Because I find that even after I turned off the heat, the soup thickened up further more. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

4-5 stars: Used clam juice in place of water, red potatoes and served w/ crumbled bacon.  And it is oh-so-yummy!  :)  I froze it up and just had some of it thawed.  The potatoes absorbed some of the liquid, but it was still delicious!

Love this!  This was my first time making any kind of chowder and my picky husband tried to eat 3 bowls the first night (could only get 2 1/2 down).  So I know that this is a keeper!  Did add the bacon as others suggested but kept everything else the same.

I used fat-free half and half. I also used about 1/2 the butter and flour called for in the recipe.  It was still wonderful.  My husband raved about this.

I made this as an appetizer for a small dinner party; everyone loved it.  I omitted the celery, carrots and clams completely.  As usual, I sauteed the onions and potatoes in the bacon grease, but I added garlic.  After adding the water/vegetable mix to the butter/flour/half and half mix, you might find that the "soup" is too thick.  Thin it down with milk.  I used a salt mix called "vegeta" which worked well.  The red wine vinegar should be at least 2 tablespoons, and as much as 3.  It really makes a difference.

Very nice, but so rich I will probably only make a couple of times a year.  I did add about 2 TBS Old Bay to the veggie mix while simmering.  Otherwise I think it might have been a little bland.

This is great!  First time I've made it from scratch and it turned out wonderful!  We don't eat much clam chowder because hubby doesn't like the canned stuff.  So I decided to give this a try and am glad I did!  I added 4 strips of cooked crumbled bacon, left out the celery and doubled the carrots.  I cooked the bacon, then added the veggies and sauteed them for a couple minutes, then added the clam juice and water and made it as usual.  Will be making this again for sure!

This was pretty good!  I wasn't expecting much but I was very pleasantly surprised.  Next time we will leave out the veggies though, just not our taste.  When we tried this prior to putting in the vinegar it tasted like flour.  Once we put the vinegar in, delicious!! Next time I think we'll try more chopped clams (we did 3 cans minced, 2 cans chopped), we wanted more clams!  Also, I think we will try 1/4 cup corn starch and 1/2 cup flour to see how that is.  We did put some Bay Seasoning in, but honestly we both liked it better without the Bay Seasoning!! Definitely will make again and highly recommend this chowda!!

Incredible!  My daughter loves clam chowder, but I've never attempted to make my own.  This was excellent!  I used a cup of country style hash brown frozen potatoes because I didn't have any regular ones.  Worked out well!  So easy!

I made this just two hours ago.  The title says it all, the BEST clam chowder.  My entire family loves clam chowder.  Even the little ones (ages 12, 5 and 4) order it whenever we go out to eat. 

This is -- without a doubt -- the best clam chowder we've ever had!  I added bacon as some have suggested and agree that you shouldn't skip on the red wine vinegar.  It really gives it a great taste.

Thanks so much for this recipe....it's a keeper!

The red wine vinegar really brightens the flavour of this soup so don't leave it out.  I took other reviewers suggestions and added bacon.  I rendered bacon in the pot for the roux...took the bacon out and added the butter to the bacon fat for extra flavour...there was about 1 1/2 tbsp of bacon fat total.  Great creaminess and flavour..

Excellent doesn't come close to describe this!  We absolutely loved it!  Just for my own tastes this time, I did add bacon (actually bacon bits) while sauteing the veggies and some chopped portobello mushrooms b/c I needed to use them.  But this recipe by itself is great!  Kudos to the cook!  Love it!

Slamming Yummy! I followed the recipe exact with quantity of everything except onions, I doubled onions because I like them. I did do the vegetables first in bacon grease as others suggested to do. 
I believe this is some of thee best clam chowder I have ever tasted. No more ordering out for this soup ;-)

This is a great recipe!  I wasn't able to find canned clams here in Germany, so I used frozen ones instead.  I also left out the celery because hubby is not a big fan and I forgot to add the wine vinegar at the end.  It still tasted great and better that what you would get in a restaurant.  Will definitely make again for years to come!

Mmmm...excellent clam chowder.  It was my first attempt at making clam chowder, which is one of my favourite soups.  I used to live in Massachusetts, and since I moved, I have not found a good clam chowder at our local restaurants here.  I also used 4 strips of bacon and Old Bay seasoning.  I was skeptical of the red wine vinegar, but used it anyway.  Boy, was that awesome!  Even my hubby, who is not generally a clam chowder fan (I usually buy the chunky campbells can), LOVED it, and packed leftovers for lunch!  Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe.  It is a keeper in our household.

Excellent clam chowder.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used bacon like many others.  This was fabulous.  Even my son, who doesn't care for clam chowder, said it was delicious.  My husband said it was the best soup I ever made.  Thanks for the recipe.

Like many others, I fried up some turkey bacon and then stir-fried the vegetables in the bacon grease.  I omitted the carrots (in clam chowder? really?), and added a small bag of frozen corn instead, which added a great splash of color. The soup was AMAZING, and tasted like a combination of corn chowder & clam chowder.  Easy and tasty, but I'll probably only make it once a year, because of the fat content.

Very Yummy!  I gave 4 starts because I changed a couple of things.  As another reviewer suggested, I fried up 5 strips of bacon in the pan first, removed (and saved to crumble in at the end) and then sauteed the veggies in that, then added the clam juice.  Also, I did 2 cups half and half and the other 2 cups 2% milk and it was plenty thick and rich enough.  I actually added a bit of water at the end because it was a bit too thick.

This was fantastic! I did add Old Bay seasoning like other readers suggested. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it wasn't thick like clam chowder. Will try again though, maybe with more flour? Thanks again!

When I open a can of Clam Chowder my hubby suddenly goes missing so he won't have to eat it.  I made this recipe as written, except I used additional clam juice I had on hand instead of water to cook my vegetables.  I feed it to my hubby and lo and behold, he liked it!  This is indeed an easy and delicious clam chowder recipe.  I enjoyed it so much I had a second bowl....

EXCELANT!!!  I'm 6 months pregnant and had the biggest craving for clam chowder, even though it is July.  I did the baccon thing, and then cooked the onions and vegies in the baccon fat, and instead of using water to submerge the vegies, I used clam juice.  I also used a full quart of heavy whipping cream.  So much better!  Though next time I might just use a pint and a half to make it even thicker...and it was pretty think this time.  :-)  It turned out perfectly!!  :-D  I served it w/ warm sour dough bread.  I was very happy w/ the results.  I will be making this often.

This soup tasted better than what i would get at a restaurant. The only thing i changed was that i added a little less half and half than what it called for because i like my soup thick. Another thing i do to make soup thinker is add some instant mash potatoe flakes and it works wonders!

FANTASTIC CHOWDER!! I did however vary a little from the recipe – I used ¾ of the recommended amount of butter/flour. Replaced the half/half with heavy cream. The heavy cream was all that I had at the time and it turned out incredibly good. Clam juice was used in place of water. I also used chopped clams instead of minced and added a can of whole baby clams. This really was some awesome chowder – we will be making it again….soon!!

Awesome!  Tasted just like my mom's.  Used all clam juice, no water.  Didn't need much salt because of that.  Also, I added some shrimp, just cause that's how my mom made it.  It was fabulous!

First time making clam chowder & it was delicious.  I only had two cans of clams on hand but next time I'll be sure to use three.  I think it also needed just a few more vegetables and perhaps a bottle of clam juice. But nonetheless it was still very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This clam chowder was a hit. I did add bacon like other reviewers, left out the carrots, added a extra can of clams, used the cornstarch like others. I will use a little less cornstarch next time because it was really thick. I will make this again and again.

Great clam chowder recipe!!!  I tripled the recipe to make for a large group and I also wanted plenty leftover for the next day and it still turned out fantastic.  My only changes to the recipe were that I DOUBLED the amount of minced clams called for.  I had so much of the other ingredients the minced clams seemed out of proportion.  I also added extra canned clam juice to cover the vegetables with because I had so much potatoes, carrots, onion and celery I needed more clam juice than that which came with the clams to cover the veggies.  I could have used water, but I think the clam juice added much more flavor as others have suggested.  Some minor doctoring aside with certain spices I like in almost all my soups and this was ready to rock.  By far the best homemade clam chowder I have ever tasted and my company agreed very enthusiastically.  Thanks for the recipe Pioneergirl…it’s a winner!

I tried this receipe and found it a bit bland. I should have swapped the water for the claim juice. To spice up the taste, I added soy bacon (vegetarian), fresh parsley, fresh cilantro, corn, cayenne, fresh bay leaves and the receipe was much better.

I followed the recipe, and used chicken broth to cover instead of water.  I also didn't use the red wine vinegar "i didn't have " and it came out great!  My teenage son and his and friends loved it.

Wow - this is GREAT with crusty bread for dipping.  I'm not sure it's cheaper than buying a couple of cans of good quality clam chowder, but it sure is healthier.  I used fat-free half and half which was a mistake - the soup came out tasting very sweet.  I had to use a lot of salt and vinegar (probably 4-5x the written amount) to clear the sweet taste.  Next time I'll use regular half-and-half.  I'll probably use more clams, too, just because we love them.  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!  Made for a group of guys in honor of the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.  I added 3 slices of crumbled bacon when I added the vegetables.  Used 5 cans of clams, which was perfect.  Didn't need to add any water to cook the vegetables.

This recipe is wonderful, except for one thing....where's the bacon? I fry thr bacon seperate and drain all the fat, with all the butter...extra fat isnt needed. I also add a little old bay..just a dash for a little something something.

This was good.  It didn't have enough clam flavor for me, and I even added a jar of clam juice.  It was really thick, almost too thick (and I like creamy soups) and I had used 1% milk for one cup of cream and even cut back on the butter a little.  I did enjoy it though, and my husband loved it.

Good, but not great...I've definitely tasted better. However, I did rate it a 4 because I believe with a few modifications it could be a winner. Next time I'll take the suggestion of others and add bacon and maybe another can of minced clams.

Loved this recipe.  The only change that I made was I used 1 pint of half and half (fat free) and 2 cups skim milk because that's all I had.  It turned out very good but did need a little extra salt and pepper for flavor.  Next time I'll try adding bacon as suggested by others.

Was searching for a great Clam Chowder.  This was excellent.  I made a few modifications following other review comments.  I did not add any water.  I used the clam juice from the canned clams and added clam juice from a bottle for the rest.  I did not add carrots (my son said clam cowder does not have carrots).  The Vinagar is a must.  Very nice rich consistency.  Served for Friday dinner with crusty beard and fresh green salad.

Received three "This is the best clam chowder I've ever had" comments, and I'll add my own. Absolutely delicious! I used one pint half & half and one pint 2% - VERY creamy - and was only brave enough to add 1 T balsamic vinegar (no red wine vinegar on hand). Next time I'll try the 2 T because it added a real depth to the soup. Omitted carrots (yuck!) and added an extra can of chopped clams (3 minced, 1 chopped for chunkiness). Also used 1/2 jar of clam juice to cook veggies instead of water. Slurp!

We make this every year for Christmas, served in Italian Bread Bowls (also from this site).  We use 5 cans of clams as suggested by other reviews.  Couldn't be better.

Seems superfluous to add my review when there's already 275 reviews, but I will anyway--this is some awesome chowder! My husband said it was the best he'd ever had, and I think it's definitely up there among the best. I put in a pint of half-and-half and a pint of 1% milk, rather than the full quart of half-and-half. I also added a couple of leftover sea bass filets from a previous meal, cut into small chunks. I'd cooked them blackened-style, so they added a little extra to the overall flavor. I also put in a tsp. of Old Bay with the veggies while they cooked in the clam juice. This is a great soup to make straight or play with.

I'd really give it a 4 1/2. This is really a very tasty chowder! My husband and I loved this recipe! Made it as is but added a handful of dried parsley for color, skipped the carrots & red wine vinegar (didn't have either) and 2 cooked and chopped slices of turkey bacon. It's simple and so are the flavors, in a good way though! It would be a 5 but it wasn't quite clam-y enough to suit our taste. It has a very mild clam flavor. If you like a stronger clam flavor to come through I would suggest using double the amount of clams and do not be afraid to use the liquid from 6 cans of clams - this makes a very thick chowder. We will absolutely be making it again! Outstanding recipe, Sharon. Thanks!

Wow, this recipe is fantastic.  After many attempts at trying to make a good clam chowder, having only failing miserably, this recipe came through, and even better than I expected.  I did change a few things though.  I first fried up four slices of bacon and sauteed the onions and celery in the bacon grease before adding the clam juice,  added only 1/2 cup of flour instead of the 3/4 cup that the recipe calls for, used only a 1/4 cup of celery instead of 1 cup, and omitted the carrots.  This came out great!  The entire family loved it at the pot was gone in just a few minutes.  Absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

The recipe is just perfect as is-I would give it 6 stars if I could.  Next time I might try an extra can of clams. My son who does not like veggies just polished off two bowls. I had just returned from Boston and enjoyed lots of clam chowder...this recipe beats anything I have found in a restaurant. Thanks for a great keeper!

Very good clam chowder!  I think I added more red wine vinegar than it called for because I thought it needed a little more.  I will make this again!

This wasn't bad for my first try at clam chowder. I followed recipe exactly - no substitutions. Like some others I found it to be on the liquidy side - I'm used to the thicker stuff at restaurants. But unlike some others that said all they could taste was flour - I didn't. Actually, I couldn't taste hardly anything at all except the celery! I agree that it needs something - perhaps more clams or clam juice - not sure since I've never made it before. Oh - and the red wine vinegar wasn't good - not inedible but I wouldn't do it again! I guess I'll keep looking for the perfect clam chowder.

This is so good I added more salt for taste. With the flour it felt like I was eating dough in the chowder so maybe I will add less flour next time. I will probably replace the carrots with corn next time too.

I was pleased with the results for my first attempt at clam chodwer. It was a little thick and I think needed a bit more flavor. I will make again and and some extra clam juice or seasonings, and will also try a few other recipes. Thank you for the recipe!1

So good! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used 5 slices of fried bacon as well as the bacon grease. This is definitely something my body wouldn't be able to handle EVERY day but definitely something I would make again. I used 2 cups milk and 2 cups half and half instead of the full 4 cups of half and half. That made it a LITTLE more healthy. =)

This recipe is THEE BEST! Absolutely TO DIE FOR! HEAVEN! I did make one little change, I used chicken stock rather than clam juice. I think it would be just as delicious with the clam juice however. HIGHLY recommend!

The presence of the flour is overwhelming in this recipe (for my taste).  It is INCREDIBLY thick... and rather bland.  To make it a little less so, I added plenty of extra vinegar and some cholula sauce.  It helped a lot but, sadly, we ended up dumping most of it.  (Maybe it's just my westcoast tastebuds...)

Great recipe. Easy to make.  I reduced the recipe for four servings and after my son-in-law and I tried it we were wanting more.  I will be making a larger batch this weekend. Months later I have made several batches and always have to send some to my son-in-law.  My daughter called me one night to say they were at a very popular restaurant that is supposed to have the best clam chowder.  My son in law embarrased her by saying loudly that is was not as good as moms.

Great clam chowder!! Excellent reciepe. I added extra canned clam juice, reduced salt and omitted the vinegar. In addition, thyme to taste. This was managable because you're basically cooking the vegatables separately and end up with great consistency. You'll impress your guests.

This was perfect. I made this recipe exactly as written and it came out delicious. My entire household was raving about it; the whole pot was finished in less than an hour. I love the flavor the vinegar gives it, it's a great twist! Thank you, this will definitely be something I make again.

Very good...nice, thick and chunky.  I used 3 cups of potatoes and omitted carrots.  It was a little bland and paste before adding the clams so I added some chicken boullion granules, a dash of hot sauce and black pepper. Did not add vinegar as others suggested.  Yummy!  Just did a chowder crawl in Portland...and this is as good if not better!

The soup was quite easy and pretty good. I didnt have any carrots at hand, so i added 1/2 cup more of celery and onions. I didnt use any of the red wine vinegar either (I didnt have any). The soup still turn out pretty good. My mother was commenting how good it taste. A keeper.

Oh this is gooood.  The only change I made was to add one more can of clams, and the only potatoes I had were yukon golds.  Absolutely delicious.  Will make again.  The vinegar sounds odd, but put it in.

This recipe is so fantastic because it's really easy and comes out with a great flavor.  I add a little extra Old Bay or some allspice depending on what sort of mood I'm in at the time.

Very good. I didn't have cream or red wine vinegar on hand, so I used whole milk and balsamic vinegar. I think it really needs the cream. Will definitely make again.

Nice chowder!  Not quite "clammy" enough so next time I'll add a bottle of clam juice.  Also, I added some seafood seasonings which really complimented it I think.

I have to agree with everyone else - this was absolutely delicious - as good as any I have ever eaten.  I added some majoram and some thyme, almost doubled the clams and added some milk.  Thank you for this recipe.  It was as easy as it was good.

I was suprised to find vinegar in the recipe but I'm up for anything so I gave it a try.  HUGE hit for Christmas Eve!!  The New Englanders and the Southerners really enjoyed this meal.  I doubled up on the clams and used clam juice instead of water like what other reviewers said.  Fabulous!

Now if I cheat and have to go with clam chowder in a can I will add a little vinegar for some added flavor!

i used two cups of half and half, and two cups of milk.  next time i will use even less half and half, since it was little too sweet for me.  also i did used the corn starch instead of the flour as others suggested, along with the one clam juice bottle instead of water.  i used two cans of minced clams, and three cans of chopped clams, and it was barely enough.  i didnt use the carrots, and i didnt have any celery, so i used celery salt and one extra cup of potatoes and it did just fine.  the chowder hit the spot.  good for a cold day.

My husband and oldest son said it needed bigger/more clam chunks but my little ones and myself liked it the way it is. I followed this recipe to a "T" except I added a little milk at the end to thin it out a tad. I gove it a 5 because I think it is a fabulous chowder but next time I will add more clams/clam juice, one or the other. :-)

I'm giving this recipe a 4 only because I changed a few things.  I left out the carrots because I'm not use to carrots in clam chowder and I replaced them with extra potatoes.  It was a little too thick for me so I added some milk as well to get it to the consistency I liked.  It tasted better the next day.  Would definitely make it again.

Sorry but we were not thrilled with this recipe.  I wish I would have read more reviews.  Lacked true clam flavor and tasted more like very thick potato chowder instead of thick clam chowder which we were looking forward to.  You really need to add a lot more clams in their juice to get the taste of clam chowder.  Will keep looking.  Thanks

Excellent recipe for a quick and delicious meal - we forgot the red wine vinegar and added about 3/4 of a can of corn but it still tastes great. This only takes about half an hour to prepare and is a hearty and tasty meal.

I've made this a number of times, but once it didn't turn out so good.  Make sure to cook the flour long enough or your soup will taste like raw flour.  Good soup.

Excellent chowder!  I added 4 cans of clams instead of 3, but the taste and consistency were supreme.  Very easy, yet tasty!

I give this recipe four stars but I didn't make it quite this way.  We are a cajun/south Texan family so crawfish was a must.  First I omitted the carrots, then I cooked the celery, onions, & potatos in chicken broth (to cover) until the broth was mostly gone.  I set that aside and sauted 1-2 lbs of crawfish tail meat in a little butter until done and set that aside.  Then I followed the butter, flour, half & half directions except I used 2 c. half & half and 2 c. 2% milk.  (It still comes out so thick I end up using more milk to thin it out) Finally I dump the meat and veggies in and let the whole thing heat through adding some CajunLand seasoning to the whole thing.  Served with hot french bread....yum!!  It is a little rich so it maybe best served as an appetizer or leave the potatos out and serve over fish or maybe even leave thick and served with toasted baguettes as a dip.

Very good.  I doubled the amount of clams and omitted the carrots.  I also used fat-free half & half which worked quite nicely.  The next time I make this, I'll add some bacon or bacon fat to add flavor.

Very good chowder.  I did cook the veggies in clam juice as others suggested.  Next time I will mix 1/2 qt. half-and-half with 1/2 qt. milk.  This is a keeper!!

This was wonderful!  I used 4 cans of clams and left out the potatoes because I don't care for them in my chowder.  My boyfriend who claims not to be a clam chowder fan couldn't get enough of this. He wants me to make it again already.  I have to agree, it is a great recipe. The red wine vinegar is a wonderful touch.  Yum!

It was better than most restaurant!
I would use 5 or more clam cans to bring more
clam flaver to the soup next time. 
Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Just made two batches of it for the holidays. I liked the red wine vinegar at the end - but maybe just a little less of it. Tastes GREAT and not too hard to make.

Excellent Clam Chowder. Especially since I went to school in boston and have become somewhat of a clam chowder connoisseur. This was simple to make, tasted great! I never was a fan of celery, so i removed it completely from the dish. I added bacon and a bay leaf for seasoning. Thumbs up all around!

We live near a coastal area and have access to some wonderful seafood restaurants where we have sampled many different clam chowders.  This recipe rivals some of the best we have had!  
I divided the quart of half and half using 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 of the half and half and it was still rich without being heavy or "floury." (Which can be a problem with some clam chowders.)
My 12-year-old son helped me with the preparation and we had fun making this soup together.  
It was even better for lunch the next day!

Great clam chowder. I think that this is probably the best chowder I have had. I did like the others and added more clams (5 cans...but I could still do more).

Next time, I would probably add a bit of bacon, but the recipe is great without it.

I plan on making this recipe many more times in the future!!!

I tried this recipe , my husband loved it, and he only eats New England Clam Chowder from the Black Rose pub, in Boston, MA 
I loved it so much I drove 25 miles to share some with my mother, and brother.
They raved about it , even Dad , who will only eat Manhattan Clam Chowder, said it was good !
Thank you so much for sharing it !!!

This recipe was awesome! I'm not a real fan of creamed soups, but this was the best clam chowder I've had.  I made it for a family gathering and they went absolutely wild over it.  Everyone wanted some to take home.  I'll be sharing the recipe with them and I'm sure we'll see this again at our next gathering, just in a larger pot.

having tried numerous recipes for clam chowder this is by far the best recipe i have tried. I added an additional can of clams (we are big clam fans here) but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  My family can't wait for me to make it again.

This was the first time I ever made clam chowder from scratch.  I admit, I was a little intimidated because I am not big on seafood but have always enjoyed canned clam chowder.  I tried the recipe and I will seriously never eat a bowl of canned chowder again!  It was so creamy and good!  I made it at my parents home and they asked me to print out the recipe for them as well!

This is absolutely wonderful!!  My boyfriend is from PA and so he has had a lot of chowder but he said this is the best he ever tasted.  We dont like celery or onions so I left these out and added more potatoes and carrots and added an additional can of clams...DELICIOUS!!!

This is very good!  My husband likes to add a little hot sauce to "kick it up a notch."

This is by far the best Clam Chowder recipe I have ever made. We just returned from a trip to New England, and this is better than what we had in the restaurants there. I added a generous teaspoon of thyme and used chopped clams rather than minced. We will have this over and over again! Don't skip the vinegar, it really adds a subtle deliciousness. YUM!

I have always loved clam chowder.  This is a delicous soup.  I thought it was even better the next day.

This is so delicious!  I served it to my mother & my in-laws for a family dinner and it was a big hit!  I also passed this recipe along to a co-worker who makes it about once a week (she uses canned potatoes & chopped veggies from the salad bar).

This was the best Clam Chowder recipe I ever tried! Every other recipe I've tried turned out watery until this one! This recipe was rich and creamy and thick! The only other change I would make would be to add another can of clams! Thanks!

I was expecting better but it was pretty good, a little too creamy for my tastes.
