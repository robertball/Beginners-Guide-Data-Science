Absolutely a wonderful pie. For those who find that their pie was runny be sure to use a quality corn syrup, Karo or better. I have used store brand corn syrup and my pies never set up no matter how long they cooked. This may not be the reason yours didn't set up but it's something to check.

10 stars for this recipe....made it for Thanksgiving, and Christmas, then the kids wanted me to make it again just because it is a great pie.  Hard to stop eating though!

So good! I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. I added whole pecans to the top for a better look, and they got a little burned. Probably won't do that again!

A friend served this pie one day and I had to have the recipe.  Only change she made was to increase chocolate chips to 1 cup and instead of mixing them in the filling, she layered them on the bottom crust before adding the filling.  Best Pie I have ever had! When I made it, I followed her directions and got rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe. This is definately a keeper!!!

I cut the sugar by half and add a few more pecans.  Very yummy.  It's Thanksgiving Eve and I'm heading to the kitchen right now to bake a couple of them.

I've been making this pie for years.  It is the absolute best.  I can't wait each thanksgiving/Christmas to make it.  It's a special treat.  I always melt the chocolate and butter together in the microwave first and add to the eggs.  Then whisk in the corn syrup to keep from cooking the eggs.  I highly recommend melting the chocolate.

I've made this recipe for years and it's perfect each and every time. It's not too rich and I love the crunch the pecans get after baking in the oven. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, it's delicious!

SO yummy and EASY!  I've made this twice, the second time using 3/4 c corn syrup and 1/4 cup maple syrup along with semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate chips, just because that's what I had on hand.  VERY good both times!!

Delicious. I did find it a bit runny so I added another cup of pecans and I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer to set. Make sure you use tin foil as suggested in the recipe or your crust will burn. Very yummy! Big hit!

This pecan pie was not to my liking.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Did not even bake right.  It got a very hard crust on the top of it (crystalized) and I followed the directions to a T.

Great pie! I made 2.... They came out perfect!! I used karo syrup and frozen shells. The only change I made was I used 3 tablespoons butter instead of 4, a cup and a half of pecans instead of 1, and I substituted milk choc baking squares for the choc chips. Melted the butter and squares together and added to egg mixture. They set up perfectly and came out clean for the suggested baking time. Very Yummy pie!!!!

I made 8 pies for Thanksgiving this year, as I couldn't make up my mind which one everyone would like!  This was a favorite by far, and my daughter said I need to make it every year now!  It was simple to make and not over-chocolatey...the combination of chocolate and pecans was wonderful!  I used 3 milke chocolate bars as that's all I had on hand and it turned out awesome!  Thank you!

This was the best pecan pie ever!!  I love pecan pie, but this was great.  I did't put the tinfoil over it like it says though, bc I like my crust dark. It turned out way better than I imagined, and was so easy!

I used with a graham cracker, ready made crust.  This the second time I made this pie and both times the knife does not come out clean at the end.  Just make sure you don't burn the crust and it will set when you put it in the fridge.

First time I made this mine also came out 'runny', and I even baked it for 10 mins past the time. I'm wondering if it has to do with the type of pie crust I used. It was a pre-made frozen type, and although the pie crust directions said to fill it while still frozen, I now wonder if I should have 'thawed' it a bit.  Once I refrigerated the pie it actually 'firmed up'. At least it is still edible.

I made this for the first time at Thanksgiving, 2015.  I have now had to make it by request for Christmas, New Year's Eve, and my daughter-in-law's birthday.  My son has already "ordered" one for his birthday.  Delish! I coat the bottom of the pie crust with regular size chocolate chips and then mix  mini-chips into the filling.  I use Karo light corn syrup, and I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup.   Knife won't ever come out clean: it's melted chocolate!! Check the filling to be "set" instead.

This pie is scrumptious!  I baked it for ten extra minutes, and after it was chilled, the consistency was perfect.  Chewy, crunchy AND creamy?  Fantastic, and I will be making it again.

Ok, I read the majority of the reviews on this one.... this pie is AWESOME. I didn't have a problem with the burning edges, however, I did follow the recipe and used foil. I also used a store brand syrup and had no problems with it setting...my knife wasn't "clean" as if it would be with cake and such, but it was right. I used pillsbury refrigerated dough...turned out great. The only problem I had was I used a deep dish pie pan, but it didn't fill it up enough! I'll just have to make 2 next time. ;-) Good job on this!!

I thought the chocolate would melt and spread across the crust but instead it stayed in chip form. It was not that appealing to me or my hubby. I will look for another chocolate pecan pie recipe.

A true crowd pleaser. I used a frozen Deep Dish pie crust and just covered the edges with foil. I have made many pecan pies that usually resulted in either a gloppy mess or burnt to a crisp. This was the closest I have ever come to perfection. I am so excited!

This pie is perfect.  I get rave reviews everytime I make it.  The foil around the edges is a must.  The only thing I change is that I always put it in a deep dish pie crust otherwise the above ingredients run over the sides.  I know you will enjoy this pie immensely!

This was very good, but I over-cooked it, due to the instructions. Ignore the instructions that says a knife should come out clean... With the chocolate chips and corn syrup, it will not come out clean even when done cooking. I cooked mine 10 minutes over because I was waiting for my knife to come out clean,(never did) and it ended up a little hard and burnt on the edges. The center was delicious though!

I ran across this recipe as I was looking for a pecan pie to make for Thanksgiving. This did NOT disappoint!! I'm already baking another today. I can't believe how easy it was to assemble and the outcome was just amazing! My crust did a little breaking on the edge, but that was my fault and had nothing to do with the actual pie itself. Definitely 5 stars from me and I'll keep this in my favorites for sure!! May I add that instead of milk chocolate chips I used Tollhouse semi sweet chips. They were perfect!!

I'm glad I thought to put a baking sheet on the shelf underneath this.  It overflowed while cooking something awful.  It never  set while cooking in the middle.  I finally took it out after an hour and a half and the middle was still runny.  The next morning even though I wrapped it up to store it overnight it was overdone.  Chocolate in anything is always good, but this was not the gooey pecan pie I know and love.

I made this using semisweet chocolate chips instead. I'm a dark chocolate lover. Also made my own pie crust. Took it to work. Huge hit. Had to make it again for a pot luck. People love this pie. Thank you for the great recipe!

Fantastic! I make 2 pies at a time and divide one bag of milk chocolate chips and pour onto the bottomof the shells and use 1 3/4 cup of Light corn syrup for the two pies combined and one bag of pecans that measures 2 1/2 cups. The rest of the ingredients were the same. It was a perfect thickness.

This pie was way to sweet for my liking. Also did not set well until it was left in the refrigerator overnight.  May try it again and modify the sugar and corn syrup because I do think it has potential.

I was looking for a variation on the standard Pecan pie and this is it.  The chocolate balances nicely with the pecans, without being overly sweet or tasting like a candybar.  Very nice, super easy recipe!

I've made the basic Karo pecan pie for over 23 years, but have been trying numerous different pecan pies with chocolate over the past 2 years.  I HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!  This pie is easy to make, browns very easy to make a wonderful presentation and tastes awsome!  I made two last weekend for our church dinner and ended up cutting and eating one of them at home, hot out of the oven.  Everyone who ate the pie loved it.  You can't go wrong with this one.  I will definately bake this pie several times a year.

This recipe was very simple and the taste was great! I don't eat pecan pie, but I tried it because it contained chocolate. The best I've had. I made this for Thanksgiving and this was the first dessert to go!
