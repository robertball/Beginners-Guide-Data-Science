I have been making this cake for years and ALWAYS receive LOTS of compliments. The cake is very moist and the glaze tastes awesome!  The only difference between my original recipe and Glenda's is I have never add oil to the glaze and I also glaze when cake is completely cooled.

I've made this cake for 25 years. It's our family's traditional birthday bundt. My mom still uses the apricot nector, but I prefer GUAVA nector. It really makes this cake taste moist and sweet. I won't ever turn down a slice with apricot nector, however. We use Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme brand.

This cake is so delicious!  I get the apricot nectar in the Mexican food section of the grocery store; it is in cans like soda pop.  It is so moist and the glaze has such a delightful zing!

I made this for Easter dinner, and everyone raved! I usually prefer making cakes from scratch, but this recipe looked interesting. Plus, we're a chocolate-loving family, so I wanted to overturn the status quo. :-) I omitted the extra 1/3 cup sugar, cause the cake mix is plenty sweet on its own; also omitted the oil in the glaze and used a little extra lemon juice. I was also tempted to put a little vase of flowers in the middle of the bundt, but left it alone. This is one cake I'll look forward to making again - thanks!

My family loves this cake!  My recipe calls for only 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup oil, though.  Also, my recipe's icing is 1 cup powdered sugar and the juice of one lemon.  I sometimes almost double that, though. In case anyone is wondering, you don't actually taste the apricot flavor.  That nectar just gives the cake incredible moisture.  I like to make it a day or two in advance to let all the flavors and moisture get just right.  YUM!

This cake was easy to make.  It is delicious and tender.  It is not too sweet and the glaze goes on thick but melts beautifully over the warm cake.    A word of caution- the cake was very tender, so removing it from the pan was a little bit difficult- make sure your pan is properly prepared!  I served it with a lemon and apricot whipped cream- It was perfect!  (Whip the cream.  Add powdered sugar.  Then fold in lemon juice, lemon zest, and a bit of the leftover apricot nectar.)  Yummy!!

This is SO, SO GOOD. I used apricot puree from last year's harvest instead of nectar and it turned out great. I topped it with buttercream frosting, adding just a few spoonfuls of apricot puree to that, too. YUM YUM YUM! Shared some with my neighbor and now it's her favorite too!

Nice flavor but a bit on the dry side for me.  My hubby isn't a lemon fan so I used an orange cake mix and orange glaze instead and it was good.

Very tasty, but a tad too sweet for me.  I think I'll omit some of the sugar next time.  I greased the pan but had a hard time getting the cake out; it just did not want to come out, and crumbled a lot--next time maybe I'll use parchemt paper or something.  I didn't use the icing called for here; I used the Clear Lemon Sauce recipe from The Joy of Cooking.  I just remembered my dad making it when I was little and I wanted to use that; I'm glad I did--it's delicious.  This cake is lovely with that sauce and some strawberries.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Everyone that tried it wanted to know who made it so they could ask for the recipe. Definitely a recipe I will be making over and over.  Not only is it delicious but it is an attractive looking cake.

Made this cake yesterday and loved it.  I had stopped using cake mixes years ago, with this delicious cake under my belt (in more ways than one I am afraid) I most certainly will be purchasing this mix to make this recipe.  Forgot lemons, so used rest of Necter in glaze, looking forward to making it with the lemon juice called for in the recipe.  Thank-you.

This cake is delicious. The longer you keep it the better it taste.
Cake is better in a tube pan as cupcakes or squares maybe to rich with glaze.

My grandmother made this cake every week.  Brings back great memories :)     The cake is perfect with a glass of tea in the summer!

I can hardly wait for the next potluck so I can bring this cake.  It looked beautiful and was absolutely delicious!  Could only find guava nectar but was not disappointed at all with the taste.  The only problem I encountered was with the glaze--had to increase the amount of lemon juice to create a liquid. Because it makes such a large cake, cut into serving sizes, wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in freezer.  Whenever I wanted a piece of cake I microwaved it for 20 seconds and it tasted freshly baked.

This is hands down one of the best cakes I've ever tried to make. The only disappointing factor was that I couldn't really taste the apricot in the cake all though it did make it very moist.

I followed the instructions to the T and it was a delicious lemon cake but it had nothing of apricot in it. I use an apricot juice in a can. Could that have been my mistake?
