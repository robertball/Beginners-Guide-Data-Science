I had all of these veggies (except zucchini) in my fridge, thanks to the CSA program I'm in. I didn't know what to do with all of it, but this was a great solution.  I worried that the lack of spices would make this bland, but I needn't have worried.  This is a hearty soup, perfect for a chilly autumn day.  At the table, I added a bit of parmesan and enjoy it even more.  My daughter, she's 6 and is very picky, liked it - although she removed the soggy bread.  My husband ate two bowls full and declared that it felt great to eat a hearty soup while enjoying so many veggies.  Amen!

I found this made alot of soup so have lots of friends over and it does get better with age.  The only thing I didn't like and it may have been something I did wrong but the bread was not soaked through and was a bit overwhelming...not exactly like the one I remember from Tuscany but good!

This was an easy and healthy soup to make for my family. I followed the recipe as written with a few on hand-ingredient changes(frozen sliced zucchini/1 can fire-roasted tomatoes/No Swiss Chard). This is a soup that tastes even better the days after you make it!

Very good soup. I made it without adding the bread and ate it right after it was done cooking. I will make it again!

Very hearty italian peasant soup, but be advised this recipe makes 6 quarts of soup. The bread adds a nice flavor to a filling soup.

The classic version of La Ribollita.  I actually made this in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high after sauteing the veggies as instructed.  I then let it sit overnight in the fridge as required to be "rebollita".  Having used gluten free bread though I had to leave adding the taosted bread for the next day as it disintegrates due to the lack of gluten.  It is a delicious and flavorful soup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Fantastic,  made a few changes...substituted parsnips for potatoes, turkey broth for water, added garlic, and added red thai chili sauce ( sauce).  My family loved it...oh we are doing low carbs so we did without the bread.

This made a whole lotta soup! I followed steps 1&2 to a tee and found it a bit bland so I used 1 cup finely chopped stewed tomatoes and 3 tbsp tomato paste in total. I tore the bread into pieces and placed them at the bottom of my slow cooker. Poured the soup over that and left in fridge overnight. Let the soup sit on low for the entire next day. When I ladled the soup out, the bread was almost like a dumpling. This wasn't my most favourite soup but I loved using all of the veggies I had left after a week of not cooking too much, and had some frozen as well. I had a lot of leftovers so I added some cooked pieces of Italian sausage. YUM. I enjoyed trying this soup. Thanks TINATED.

Very bland. Salt and pepper help but not much. Parmesan Reggiano helped more as did some Italian Seasoning.
