This is like gingerbread, a dessert, rather than a quick bread. I replaced the corn syrup with honey.  I cut the recipe in half, and spread it in a pie pan instead of baking in a loaf pan. It baked for 40 minutes.  Oh!  I will be making more of this real soon!  Thanks for the recipe!

It would sure help to know the size of these "three small loaf pans". I have regular size and individual size [mini] loaf pans, but I don't know what small really means.

Looks good; spent the day baking for a church bazaar and wanted one last item with a different flavor profile. Was starting to run out of one ingredients. So used all purpose flour for the rye, honey and maple syrup for the corn syrup. Also halved the recipe as another reviewer suggested. Plan to make again.

We have a bakery in our town that makes a bread like this that they sell only at Christmas and Easter.  Everyone we know loves it and buys it at that time.  This recipe is spot on.  So glad I came upon this recipe.  We love it warm with butter or even toasted.

This bread is fantastic! I did use a few substitutions simply because I didn't have the ingredients on hand--I used all-purpose flour and maple syrup rather than rye flour and molasses--but really, I went with this recipe for the anise flavor. It was still delicious! Next time, though, I'll make a trip to the store. Thanks for a great recipe!

I replaced the buttermilk with low fat yogurt, the corn syrup with honey, replaced anise with orange peel. It was a hit at a gathering I went to. I served it with whipped butter. It is a little sticky but that's fine.  and it sunk in the middle so the aesthetics aren't perfect
