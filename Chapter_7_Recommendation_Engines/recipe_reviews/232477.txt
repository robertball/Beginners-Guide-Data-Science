I subbed homemade Chinese hot mustard for Dijon and found there was enough heat to omit the hot sauce. Fat-free mayo is disgusting, so I subbed Greek yogurt and a little full-fat mayo. It was pretty good but it needed more kick so I added about 1 tbsp pickle relish, 1/2 tsp dried dill, and a few dashes of garlic powder. I ate it with salad greens, and it was pretty delicious.

I like the heat, but next time I might try 1/2 tsp. minced jalape√±o instead of the hot sauce! Great lunch!

I used a green onion instead of red, because it was what I had in the house.  Very yummy.

I only had regular mayo so not so healthy for me, but absolutely delicious.   I used a little less hot sauce, since I have kids, and next time, I may use a little less mayo - it was plenty moist.
