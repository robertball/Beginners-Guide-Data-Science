I used flour tortillas instead. Was excellent with all the fresh vegetables including some fresh tomatoes.

I made these for my family tonight and they were very good, I have been to mexico a bunch of times and have a lot of friends from mexico and these tacos taste authentic. you don't need the olive oil, garlic, lime dressing just cut a slice of lime to squeeze on the taco. also if you cant find pickled onion buy rice wine vinegar and a red onion, slice the onion into thin slices and soak in the vinegar overnight.  don't forget the queso fresca (fresh Mexican cheese) as it helps make these tacos something special.

Loved these! Only change I made was to use filet because it was on sale for less than flank steak for some unknown reason. Loved the texture and the crunch from the cabbage. Wil make again.
