This was an amazing dish. I did not have brandy, but it still tasted great. This was my first time lighting alcohol on fire. It is not at all scary. However, the leftovers were not very good.

We loved it!  My guests raved about how good it was. Our Kroger had no hazelnuts, so I used almonds. Very quick and easy.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe but BEWARE. I followed the suggestions to double the sauce, but don't do it all at once, because I had a flame up to my ceiling! I never used brandy, so I am lucky I still have eyebrows! Add the brandy a little at a time, and let it burn off.  This tastes excellent, and looks a lot more difficult than it is. I used the same recipe on Salmon (no breading, just the hazelnuts) and i loved it.

Thanks Dave for a great chicken recipe.  I used brandy and whatever other liquer I had on hand - I don't think it has to be hazelnut liquer to taste good. I made this as a mid week dinner and impressed everyone.  The chicken was very moist and tender and the hazelnuts in the crust had a great flavour - and I don't normally like nuts!  Even warmed up the next day it still tasted great!  Thanks!

My husband thought this merited a 4 so I will give it that. In my opinion though, it was not that great. The bourbon chicken that I made last week surpasses this recipe by leaps and bounds (see reviews). This was pretty but I thought the hazelnut flavor was a bit overwhelming. Again, my husband liked it.

So easy to prepare once you have all the ingredients. But I don't think that it's meant for 2 servings...more like 4! The Frangelico is really sweet so I think next time I'll use more brandy than the Frangelico. My mom who's not fond of chicken was thoroughly impressed and made it tonight for some of her friends!

This recipe is incredible!  I have made it several times for family dinner parties, and it has become everyone's favorite.  My guests now excitedly congregate in the kitchen to watch the blue flames! Like others, I have added more mushrooms and doubled (sometimes tripled) the sauce.  Adding the liqueurs little by little is smart so that you can be sure the alcohol burns off and has no aftertaste, in addition to avoiding huge flames.  Having made it the first time with naked Turkish hazelnuts I'd brought back from Istanbul, I was scared to try them with the skins on (all I could find in the US grocery store).  It turned out perfectly and really just added more color to the nut breading!  This was a brilliant idea for a meal and never disappoints.  Even if you're not one to enjoy a sweet taste with your meat, it's subtle enough to be appreciated!

I tweaked this recipe a bit. There was no way that I would be able to fry the chicken breasts in so little butter, so I did a mix of 1/2 butter and 1/2 grapeseed oil. I used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs and also ran the filberts (hazelnuts) throught the blender. I added 1/4 tsp EACH thyme, oregano, and garlic powder to the panko breading. I butterflied the chicken breast and lightly pounded them thinner.  This is a great recipe for special dinners or for company.

This recipe was sensational, and I discovered the same as everyone else that the amount of sauce was not adequate so next time I will add more, other than that it was flavorful and a great dish.

This is so good, impressive, and very easy. I'm going to make this on Thanksgiving eve--the beautiful blue flames and the tasty sauce will be a big hit. Two suggestions: double the sauce and serve with rice.

This was delicious.! I will make again.  Double the sauce as others suggested and perhaps cook more mushrooms, otherwise DO NOT CHANGE A THING.  Don't skimp on the quality of the alcohol, it will make a difference.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a new favorite.

I doubled the sauce.  Lighting in halves to control the flame.  For the brandy I used American Honey by Wild Turkey 71 proof and I double theFrangelico.  I was concerned about the sweetness but it was perfect.

I liked this recipe. It creates a very hazelnutty flavor.  I think that a little flavor could be added by adding something to the bread crumb mixture.  Maybe poultry seasoning or lemon pepper or paprika.  I'm not sure.  As it is, you definitely get a chicken dish that tastes strongly of hazelnut.

Yummy...I really liked the nuts mixed in with the breadcrumbs. I am glad I used the advice of other reviewers and used less frangelico, as it was still a ery sweet taste even with the lesser amount of liquor. Will make this again!

The hazelnut didn't light on fire after several attempts. The flavor was way too Hazelnut-y for my taste.

This has to potential to be a very good recipe.  There is definitely not enough sauce if you follow the original recipe-  I doubled the sauce and there still wasn't enough.  What this recipe has over my favorite bourbon pecan chicken from this site is that it is healthier in the absence of a huge amount of butter in the sauce....Overall, though the hazelnut liqueur added something very special and delicious to the dish!  I will definitely make this again and try to tweak the sauce part to make it that much better!

This is a really tasty recipe.  I used fresh bread crumbs from garlic/herb bread, added extra mushrooms, and more brandy and frangelico.  It's very easy to prepare and quite an impressive dish!
