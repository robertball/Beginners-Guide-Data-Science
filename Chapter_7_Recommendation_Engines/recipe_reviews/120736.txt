A rather unique and very delicious twist on plain old cheesecake, cut into dainty little squares.  Loved the different, oatmeal crust, and the little bit of raspberry was just the right amount without overtaking the lemon cheesecake and was a nice touch!  Pretty to look at and a treat to eat.  I made half a recipe in an 8x8 pan (I tried a 9x9 but there was not enough crust for it), then cut into 16 squares, each of which I topped with a fresh raspberry.

I made these with butter substituted for shortening in the crust, homemade raspberry freezer jam, key lime juice and zest. I chilled them overnite before cutting. Hint - run some warm water over the knife before and while cutting and they will cut cleaner. These were very, very good.

Wow!  Just fantastic recipe!  After reading the other reviews, I made just a few adjustments.  I lined my pan with parchment paper because this type of crust can stick.  I used butter in the crust and a generous amount of raspberry jam (I warmed it a bit first). All my ingredients for the cheese layer were a room temperature and blended nicely.  I watched it carefully so that it was still "jiggling" when I removed it from the oven and let it cool slowly.  Then I put it in the fridge for several hours.  I cut the whole recipe into small squares (2-3 bites) and froze half of the batch for later. To serve (after thawing) I put a dollop of whipped cream and a fresh raspberry.  BEAUTIFUL and DELICIOUS.  Next time I might swirl a bit of raspberry Jam though the cheese layer for a different effect.  The recipe is great and you can be creative with the trimmings.

Really easy. I halved the recipe and made it in a 9" round springform pan.

Oh my!! What a delicious little treat this is! I loved the oat crust and touch of lemon in cheesecake and the jam in and of itself was a perfect compliment. I did not have any fresh raspberries nor any raspberry jam so I improvised on the filling. I also decided to use the original recipe for the crust because I like a thicker layer, not thin. I used butter instead of shortening. I then halved the filling recipe using 2 (8 ounces) packages of cream cheese, etc. I happen to have 2 lbs of fresh blueberries so I made a sauce using the"Blueberry Breakfast Sauce" from this website. It was just the right amount for this cheesecake. I layered it on the crust, just the right amount covered a 8x8 aluminum pan. The lemon cheesecake filling had a good amount of lemony flavor and it was the perfect amount covering the entire jam using the back of a spoon to spread. I baked it for 33 minutes and let it cool. I had a handful of fresh blueberries left so I added to each of the bars I cut for presentation. This is definitely going into my recipe box for use again and with different fruit jams. Next time I will use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I might even try adding some nuts into the crust, not sure which kind but it will be fun trying. Thank you Peggy for sharing! UPDATE: Hubby said to give this a 10 stars, he ate a huge chunk!

I substituted butter for the shortening. I loved the thick layer of cheesecake filling with great lemon flavor.  The raspberry filling and oatmeal crust balanced it very well.  My husband and I had some right away after cooling, but was much better the next day after chilling in the fridge overnight. I did use fresh lemons and fresh zest.  I made it to share with a neighbor who needed to gain weight after 25 days in the hospital.  My new favorite dessert!  I'm taking this with me the next time I'm supposed to bring something.

Fabulous!  I love lemon so I doubled the lemon juice, zest and added 1/3 c. more flour and 1/4 c. more sugar to offset the extra liquid.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the crust.

This was very good! I had blackberry jam and so used it rather than raspberry, also subbed lime for lemon as that is what I had. I decided to swirl some blackberry into the top and it was pretty, but did crack. I especially liked the crust. Out of the three desserts I took, pumpkin pie, apple pie and this, it went the quickest.

To me, the crust tasted like flour before baking. I bumped the brown sugar up to 3/4 cup - just to give it some flavor. I doubled the jam and halved the cream cheese mixture. Still with it being halved - it was a pretty thick layer of cheesecake. Turned out very yummy!!!

Followed the recipe to a T and I really liked these.  I did think there was too much of the top layer and will scale that back next time.  I used a 12 oz jar of jam and it was perfect for the second layer.  I LOVE this crust and will use it in place of graham cracker crust in other recipes.  These are on the tart side and though I love that no one else did.  I look forward to playing w/ this recipe (using different jams, and perhaps something on the top etc..) next time.

These are great! I made them for my bookclub this evening, and there was a cheesecake lover who liked them alot and wanted the recipe. This is not a diet-friendly dessert, but I guess that's why it is a dessert...I think I may try making these with key lime juice/zest with strawberry next time for a change. Just a lovely dessert and feeds a crowd, too. The crust is yummy too. Pairs perfectly with coffee and tea.

Another big hit at school! Followed the recipe exactly but needed a bit more jam to cover the crust and also sprinkled some cinnamon. They are best chilled overnight because they settle nicely. I will make this again... and again.

This is my first post.  I'm not all that in to cooking so I definitely collect the recipes that make it worth my while.  This one is a hit!  I made it last night and carried it to a gathering this morning.  It was so easy and simple.....even for me!  It was delicious and I had several requests for the recipe.   I took the advise of others and added a little more brown sugar to the crust.  I didn't have a lemon soooooo, no lemon zest either.  The rasberry layer is especially nice and sets it apart from ordinary cheesecake squares.  Well, now, everyone thinks I'm a great cook.  This one definitely goes to the front of my recipe box.

These are fabulous!  I made them for a large backyard barbeque and they were definitely a hit.  Generally I'm not a fan of bar cheesecake recipes, because they have a fluffy, from-a-box taste, with a boring, crumbly crust, but these taste just like they came from a mini springform pan.  They also present beautifully.  I will definitely be adding this to my list of favorites!

Oh my heavenly stars, this is wonderful!! I made a half recipe in an 8x8 glass baking dish. I prepared the pan with Bakers Joy and after cutting these into 16 squares (dipped a sharp knife into hot water and wiped clean before each cut), they came out without a fuss and looked beautiful. I used our favourite raspberry jam with seeds and that was just fine. The cooking time was true, 35 minutes. I topped each with a fresh raspberry. Gorgeous! We loved the unique taste of the crust and the refreshing burst of citrus from the fresh lemon juice and zest.  Thank you so much for the recipe! Update: Just took a couple of bars out of the freezer. They've been in there for quite a while, and after defrosting they taste every bit as good as the day they were made!

These are wonderful. I gave a four because the filling was barley noticeable.  I doubled the raspberry filling the next time and also made a batch with blueberry filling and both were great.  Topped with a raspberry or a blueberry and a mint leaf as these were for a baby shower.  Not a crumb leftover!

I made this for a company BBQ and everybody LOVED it!  It was so easy to make and it was nice I didn't have to make it in a springform pan.  Didn't make any changes to the recipe but couldn't find seedless raspberry jam so just used preserves - couldn't tell the difference.

These where amazing! I made them for a charity bake sale and not one was left! Everyone raved about them. They where a bit messy coming out of the pan, so next time I will make sure the pan is super greased.

These are simply delicious! I used a little bit more brown sugar in the crust to make it sweeter and I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry. It turned out sooo delicious. This is a permanent addition to my recipe box. Highly recommend!

These were good, but not GREAT. They were easy to make and had a nice flavor, but I found the crust to be a bit too chewy and the overall flavor a bit bland. Next time I will use a graham cracker crust and DOUBLE the amount of raspberry jam. I might even top if with the jam and also some fresh raspberries on top of that. Overall this is a nice easy recipe, but I think I will tweak a few things next time...

This was my very first cheesecake recipe. It turned out really well, and I received many compliments. Though next time I will use more than 1/2 cup of raspberry jam, I could barely taste it.

Excellent! Like others i made half the recipe but should have made the full batch. I brought these to work and they were gone in no time! 2 people asked for the recipe and had many compliments. I liked the crust alot and used low fat cream cheese, like another reviewer i also topped each square with a fresh raspberry. My only critique is yes they are difficult to cut, but that is the case with anything cheesecake, make sure you wipe the knife clean after each slice. I will make again! Yumm!!

Made these for a work function and they went over great! I did decide to use lime in place of the lemon, but followed everything else as written.  I thought the crust was fine, but not outstanding.  I would consider just using a simple graham cracker crust in the future.  Between the jam and the filling, you really could do a ton of easy variations on this recipe.  I thought it was easy to put together and I didn't have to futz with a spring-form pan.  Very tasty!

These were amazing! I used an entire 15 oz jar of raspberry jam and used 2 low fat cream cheese packages with two regular packages of cream cheese.

This dessert has a good flavor.  I didn't rate it a 5 because I wasn't crazy about the way it looked when I cut it (which I did very carefully, with a warm knife that I was constantly rinsing.)  Although the squares were set when I took them out of the oven, they weren't as firm as I would have liked after being chilled overnight.  I was hoping they would have more of a true cheesecake firmness.  If you look at the photos, you'll see that they don't look particularly wonderful when cut so I'm guessing that it wasn't just me.  Since I was serving them for a party, that bothered me a little bit.  Like I said, though, they were tasty.  I made a lemon whipped cream topping to put on them and that helped the presentation some.

Definately needed additional lemon in this recipe.  If I make it again, I will add more lemon and zest and possibly add lemon to the crust as well.

Loveed these. It was so incredibly creamy and yummy.  I did make some changes and have saved an alternate recipes.  I used two 8oz packages of cream cheese and one container of temptee whipped cream cheese. I also added 3/4th cup of heavy cream and a half cup of sour cream.  I kept the oven door as some recommend after I turned off the oven just to make sure it doesn't crack. Will make this again and again.

Great dessert. Next time, I would mix the  flour and whole oats in food processor so that the crust would be lighter. Will make this as a favorite lemon bar.

This was so good and rich and delicious! I used my homemade raspberry jam, I think you could use any flavor of jam.This makes alot and it is very easy to make. Next time I will use butter in place of the shortening for depth  of flavor. So good,you must try it!

This was really good. The family asked for seconds. Wish i had more jam for a stronger rasberry flavor. I cut it in half and put it in a 9x9 pan. It might have been because I halved it but it took longer to bake. About 40 minutes. Maybe the recipe was supposed to read 40-45 because at the top it says that the bake time is 45 minutes.

This was a great dessert for when I had no butter, vanilla or chocolate chips. Thanks!!! :)

This was a VERY delicious dessert that I brought to a friend's housewarming party.  I added 1/4 cup ground pecans and 2 Tablespoons ground flaxseed to the crust mixture for added nuttiness.  I doubled the juice and zest but will probably only double the zest next time.  It was a bit too liquid but I did like the extra zing of lemon flavor.  I had to sub strawberry jam mixed with a bit of orange marmalade for the raspberry but I think the sharpness of the raspberry is probably much better.

The oatmeal cookie crust was a nice change from the graham cracker crust.  The raspberry layer took this to a fancier level than just plain cheesecake.  It was a nice, rich recipe and pretty in presentation too.  Thank you for a good recipe!

This is a lightly lemon flavored cheesecake-like dessert. I followed the recipe exactly. I think you could easily substitute any flavor jam. I recommend giving this plenty of time to chill before serving.

This is a wonderful recipe for cheesecake type squares and so easy. For a change of pace try using homemade lemon curd (you can also buy it but not as good) in place of the jam.  Gives it even more of a lemon taste.

These tasted wonderful and were a big hit!  I gave it 4 stars because I was only able to take about half of the squares to a holiday party because the outer edge pieces looked terrible.  I warmed and drizzled some of the raspberry jam over the top to dress them up and hide some imperfections.

We didn't care for this recipe.  We like traditional graham cracker crust better, and thought the lemon made the cheesecake to tart.  It did look pretty but didn't taste as well as expected based on other reviews.

I made these last night for the hubby to take to work. I did not make any changes and they were amazing! The guys at my husbands work raved about them and gave them an 11 out of 10! I will definately make them again. Plus they were pretty easy to make. Also I couldn't find the seedless raspberry jam so I just used the one with seeds and I also omitted the grated lemon peel just because all and all it was a great recepie.

I've never made cheesecake in my life.  This turned out amazing!!  So smooth and creamy with just the perfect zing of lemon.  I'd heard the trick to keeping it smooth is to just beat it for a super long time, which is what I did.  I will definitely keep this in the memory bank as a quick and easy dessert.  =)

Yum! Everyone at worked raved about these treats - they loved the crust, that they could pick it up and eat it without it crumbling all over like a graham cracker crust. I actually modified the recipe slightly, after reading another review: I only used 2 8oz packages of 1/3-less fat cream cheese. It still had plenty of great cream cheese flavor - certainly "thick" enough. Because I did that, i decreased the sugar slightly. I had SUCH a hard time getting some of the bars out of the pan, that's my only complaint. I'm glad I plated them at home and didn't just take in the pan... I literally chiseled them out. They still looked and tasted great... I just might use tinfoil or parchment next time. To make them pretty, I melted white chocolate chips with a bit of sweetened condensed milk and did a cute swirl on top!

Really easy and fast.  Fresh lemon juice and the zest from three lemons produced a tart/sweet combo that my family loved.  Had to bake for 15 minutes longer than called for in the recipe, and as other reviewers said, chilling for a few hours made it easy to cut into bars.  Thanks!

I made this for a work contest. Everyone loved it. I got second place. I thought it was ok. I was expecting someting a little more tart, but it was 100% sweet. But everyone else liked it

I didn't have any oats so I used a graham cracker crust and strawberry jam instead of raspberry. I made these for an event and went to cut them into squares and the cheesecake kept sliding off the crust a little because of the jam. (That's why the 4 stars, not great presentation.)  But the taste was very good!

I made these the other day because my boyfriend loves anything lemon and, it not being my favorite, I am always looking for new lemon recipes.  I didn't have raspberry jam so I used seedless strawberry.  I also didn't have a lemon so I used a little more lemon juice instead of the grated lemon peel and it turned out great!  He loves it and even me, the lemon non-lover, enjoyed it!

I really liked the way the recipe called for rolled oats for a base. It wasn't too difficult to make and the flavor was very good. It was a rich and melt in your mouth kind of dessert but it wasn't too heavy.

It was very good, just found it to be a heavy filling. I like a light weight cheese filling for my cheese cakes.

I made this for Mother's Day, and it was absolutely perfect! Thank you for sharing, my Mum loved it! The only changes I made were making a graham cracker crust and using huckleberry jam and butter, but this turned out great!

These were good, but not much raspberry. next time 'i would double the amount of raspberry jam, and let the crust cool a bit before putting the layers together.
