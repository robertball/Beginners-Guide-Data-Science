Just made a batch tonight! They taste EXACTLY like I remember...We weren't patient enough for them to cool...they were GONE before they became hard. LoL~ We added a light white glazing of confectioners sugar and lemon juice for a slightly different twist.   THANK YOU for posting this recipe! :)

These came extremely hard.  I may have done something wrong, but I am not sure what since I followed the recipe exactly.

Made the recipe exactly, and the mix was too dry.  Didn't really rise and spread as mentioned in the recipe. Cloves flavour is a bit odd -  Won't be making this recipe again.
