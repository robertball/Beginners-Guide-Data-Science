I used a rotesseire chicken breasts for ease. Rich and delish. This is probably the first recipe in the history of my all recipes that I will always make as written with out saying it could use this or that.

I found the recipe a little bland, but every other family member loved this, so it's a keeper here.  Some advice:  oftentimes swiss cheese can be used in place of gruyere, and since the gruyere was expensive I decided to go this route.  I used an inexpensive swiss and the flavor was too stong for this dish.  Next time I will try either Cracker Barrel's Baby Swiss (which is hard to find and why I had to use a store-brand of block swiss) or spring for the Gruyere.  I also used only button mushrooms, since I prefer those to shiitake.  Finally, next time I make this, I'm going to cover the dish with foil after pouring the sauce over and baking since the sauce basically bakes away and/or "hardens" onto the pasta in it's half hour in the oven.

This came out very good with a few adjustments.  First, I made this without the chicken & subbed Fontinella in place of the Gruyere.  I added some red pepper flakes in with the garlic & since I omitted the chicken, the ricotta mixture seemed boring.. so I spiced it up a bit with some coriander, parsley, S&P, and a pinch of allspice.  It gave the shells plenty of taste.  I wouldn't change the sauce.  It was very tasty!

This was so good. I did some things different though.  I boiled my chicken breast in lightly salted water with a bay leaf and a crushed garlic clove.  Once it cooled completly I cut up the chicken in a fine dice.  I also chopped up the mushrooms into smaller pieces.  I added 2 cups of ricotta cheese and 1 tsp. of italian seasonings to the chicken/cheese mixture.  Once it was combined well I put it in a pastry bag and used it to fill up the shells, much easier this way.  It filled up 20 jumbo shells.  I noticed that a lot of the shells broke, so I am glad that I cooked more than 8 oz.  I would have like more sauce so maybe the addition of a cup of chicken broth would do the trick.  Also, for the blandness, these stuffed shells taste great with a little spaghetti sauce drizzled on top.

This was very good.  But, it took me quite a bit longer than 30 minutes to get it ready for the oven.  I also think it could have used a little more sauce.  I will make it again but use more chicken broth.

The only mistake I made in attempting this meal was being overly ambitious on a weeknight - I was in the kitchen much too long tonight, but it was worth it.  I bought the Gruyere, it was expensive but worth it, sharp and delicious - it does not taste like swiss cheese to me more a cross between swiss and sharp provolone.  I too chose to use marsala wine instead of sherry, I think marsala is not as strong and the substitution was delicious.  My sauce needed a lot of thinning from chicken stock, the roux stayed in roux form once i added the liquids slowly... it seized right back up.  Delicious, even if it took a while and dirtied a lot of dishes.

Beautiful dish! This would be great for company. I only used button mushrooms. I couldn't find gruyere cheese so I used a 5 cheese Italian blend. The white cream sauce was heavenly.

I had such high hopes for this recipe. To put into family's words "not bad, but don't have to make it 
again". Which is fine because it really takes alot longer than thr 30 mins it says

Wow, this was really good!  It was time consuming, but worth it.  I made it on a weekend night, when I had a little more time.  I pretty much made exactly as instructed. I used a little more garlic
and cheese, just cuz I like it!  I thought it might be a little too rich, so the last 15 minutes I topped dish with dollops of marinara sauce- oh maybe 1/2 cup toal. My sauce was really thick, so I think this helped from dish being too rich & dry.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was a little complex to assemble. Mushrooms, chicken and pasta and sauce were all cooked separately and then assembled before final baking. The result was a lovely combination of flavors. The baked shells have a bland appearance so I served them with braised asparagus and a fruit salad.

This was restaurant quality! My husband said he would expect to see this dish on a high end restaurant menu; & he would think it would cost a pretty penny. I paired it with a spring mix salad & a garlic bread recipe I found on ths site. It is very time consuming to prepare, so I won't make this very often. Definately for special occasions or perhaps a romantic night.

Delicious!  I did use all of the reserved liquid from the mushrooms and chicken and ended up using more Gruyere to thicken up the sauce. I was advised by the "cheese lady" at my supermarket to use the Gruyere as it has a distinctive taste and melts well-I'm glad I did as it turned out perfectly!

this was great. it has a unique taste but i really enjoyed it (my partner didn't but she doesn't love mushrooms).
also, the mushroom mixture had NO liquid left over!..at all. the 1/4 cup of sherry was such a tiny amount and the mushrooms just sucked it up and even after they were cooking there was none left. i also just used regular sherry instead of dry as that's all i had.

This recipe takes some time, but I think it is worth the effort.  It is very tasty, and I've never had anything quite like it.  However, I would put the prep time at closer to 1 hour.

This was delicious but I'm glad I read others' reviews before making it. It does take MUCH longer than 30 minutes to put together as others have said. I also increased the amount of sauce. I boiled my chicken breast in chicken stock with fresh rosemary added. I also cooked down spinach to add to the mixture as well as chopped artichoke hearts. I found that the mushrooms ate up all of the liquid, so when I was making the sauce I added in some of the chicken broth that the breast had boiled in. This insured enough liquid and made a very tasty sauce! I had leftover filling so I'm going to try freezing it and the next time we want this dish I will just have to boil shells and make a sauce!

WOW!!! Yummy.  I did make some changes- additions.  I added chopped up artichoke hearts, and only used baby bella mushrooms instead of button and shiitake mushrooms.  I also added rosemary, crushed red peppers (dash).

I quadrupled this recipe for a large party.  My only complaint is that this dish is a bit time consuming, and as others have stated, it requires many steps.  That said, hands down it tastes very upscale and delicious.  The only things I did differently, was used finely chopped fresh spinach in the chicken mixture rather than the mushrooms.  I did use the mushrooms to make the roux, but I was unable to put them back in the dish because of food aversions of the the guests. Also, I added about 2C of freshly grated Parmesan to the chicken mixture too.  ( and yes still sprinkled on top over the sauce for baking)
Will make again but prob only for special occasions and when I have hubby to help.

This is one of the recipes I go to for impressing people! It truly is delicious. The sauce that goes on the shells is to die for, and I might even steal it to use in other dishes. It's that good! I used all button mushrooms and red cooking wine because it was all I had and instead of gruyere, I used half cream cheese and half swiss laughing cow wedges. It turned out perfect! I also seasoned the chicken breast with a basic poultry seasoning rub (like kick'n chicken). Other than that it does not need any other seasoning. My only recommendation to anyone making this recipe is DO NOT pulse in a food processor. You want to pull the chicken yourself. It is tedious but if you pulse in a food processor it grinds the chicken which leads to a gritty texture. When I made this the second time, no one liked them simple because of the texture. It doesn't feel like you're eating real chicken. Otherwise though, this is great!  Make it!

I had high hopes for this recipe, didn't skimp on ingredient quality, and made the recipe as stated. It took more than 30 minutes prep time, and in the end, was somewhat disappointing.

Very good, but yes, a litle bland and very buttery. I would reduce the butter to make a bit healthier and add some spinach as well....so add more seasoning to your taste and enjoy!

Excellent dish!  Used a rotisserie chicken to save time, doubled sauce ingredients (though only used 1 1/2 overall) and doubled the ricotta.  I didn't separate mushrooms from sherry liquid after cooking - just dumped all into ricotta mixture.  Added 1 bunch of fresh steamed spinach.  Used 8 oz of manicotti and filled all but 3 shells.  Heated 1 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup sherry with thyme and pepper for roux mixture since I did not have cooking liquids from the chicken.  Unable to get greyere cheese at the market, so subbed swiss cheese (approx. 1 1/2 cups combined).  This is a very rich dinner.  Everyone raved!

I think what I like best about this dish is that it is a delicious almost "fancy" meal, that is still achievable.  What I mean by that is that the ingredients aren't too far-fetched and while it is slightly time consuming, it's expected when making stuffed shells.
I have to admit that I didn't follow the recipe to a T (I never do); I used Marsala instead of sherry... but I liked the basic concept.  The first time around I had it as is, the second time around I poured a little bit of red sauce on top.  Both ways was excellant - thanks!

This was very difficult to make and did not taste that great.  I think the cheese I used may have been bad even though I paid top dollar for it at the organic food mart.  I may try one more time with another brand of cheese.

We enjoyed this, used marsala just what I had on hand, after reading the reviews I added a little extra wine.  Turned out very good.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent. Everyone in my family loved it.  Couldn't find jumbo shells at my supermarket so used manicotti instead.  Still great.  To cut down on prep time I cooked the chicken and mushrooms the night before and assembled everything the next day.  I pretty much doubled the sauce used so it wouldn't dry out when baking, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I dont think I liked this. Too much work for the result. The sherry was too strong and the stuffing was kind of bland to my surprise. Wont make again but thanks anyway

This is a fantastic way to prepare stuffed shells.  Rich and delicious.  Time consuming (longer than prep time indicates)but worth all the compliments that come with this meal!!  A great recipe!

This takes some time to prepare, but it is definitely worth it! It has excellent flavor and is very filling. I have made this twice and both times received compliments, just wanted to pass them along. Yummy!

The filling was very good.  It was hard to get the topping thick enough, though, so I had to add more flour to the sauce.
