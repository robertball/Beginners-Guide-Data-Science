This was excellent, my husband and I both went back for seconds! I did not have ranch dressing, but I had a ranch dip packet. I added sour cream and yum. I will make it that way everytime now.

This recipe was absolutly delicious! Instead of using white cheddar I used mild cheddar cause its all I had. I also cooked the chicken for 45 min instead of 35 min cause I had thicker breast. This recipe has been added to my rotation. Thanks for sharing =)

I changed it just a little bit. I used bread crumbs instead of flakes because I didnt have any. And I added a powdered Ranch dressing packet to the mix, put a little more cheese on top of the chicken before the oven and YUM it was great! The powdered dressing added extra flavor and my family just loves extra cheese. Very good!!

Not very flavourful at all, but the cornflakes are a great coating.

Just tried this chicken at a dinner party and begged for the recipe. The cornflakes give the chicken the perfect amount of crunch. The ranch and cheddar added nice flavor without being too overpowering. The chicken was extremely moist. I can't wait to make this at home!

On the advice of some other reviewers, I used panko crumbs since that is all I had. I didn't think Captain Crunch, or rice crispies would be a reasonable substitute. I also happened to have a white cheddar with garlic that was a nice addition. I did use bone in chicken breasts and the cooking time did need to be adjusted. For 2 large breasts, it was 40 minutes at 350, still not done, so upped to 400 for an additional 15. This was a fairly quick and easy, tasty dinner. Thanks for the great idea with ready ingredients.

I made these a bit differently from the recipe by cutting the chicken into strips.  I also broiled them for a few minutes before taking them out of the oven.  Everyone who ate them liked them alot.

I used Panko breakcrumbs instead of cornflakes because it's what I had on hand.  This was a good, simple weeknight recipe.  I enjoyed the crunch.  I think this would be good to try with different cheeses as well for a different flavor.

This is a great easy way to make a dinner that even my pickiest eater will eat.  I have made it twice, the first time I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it.  The second time I made it, I was out of corn flakes and used seasoned bread crumbs as a substitute and everyone loved it as well.  Thank you for tasty and easy new meal on our dinner rotation!

Delicious, but I recommend doubling the breading to get a better coating, but reduce the salt and pepper to about half, or it's way too salty.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe; I have made it several times!  He always comments on how moist the chicken is.  The flavor is incredible as well!
I plan to use it when we have guests too...since it seems to be such a hit!

This is really good. I used another brand of ranch since Hidden Valley has MSG in it.

Who ever said this was bland, must have used bad cheese and dollar store ranch and forgot the salt and pepper.  This was great.  I only had standard yellow cheddar (extra sharp).  It worked just fine.  perhaps it's the extra sharp part, but I'm sure medium or sharp would have been good to.  Thanks for this one.
