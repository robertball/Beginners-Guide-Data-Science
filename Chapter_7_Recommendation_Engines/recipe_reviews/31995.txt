I had to modify this recipe, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, because it was bland.  Double (at least) the curry powder and worchestshire sauce.  Zezt a whole orange and use the juice from the orange as well in the last couple minutes and it is wonderful.  To finish it off I also segment an orange and use it to garnish the dish and add a little extra parsley for garnish as well.  It looks and tastes nice!

Not a bad basic recipe and easy, but it is bland and I find that curry paste (to taste) greatly improves it.

This recipe was easy to make but a little on the bland side, even when adding orange slices. It is a good base for a curry chicken recipe though and if I make this again I will add some more spices and flavors. Raisins would also be a good addition.

I read the previous reviews and decided to add coarse black pepper as I was browning the chicken and juiced the orange after I made the zest, using the juice in place of half of the water. Delicious! Next time I might try a little chicken bouillon paste as well.

I had but one  medium onion and used it all in the recipe.  I had one orange like wise and used the zest as described, but then I couldn't see the orange going to waste.  So I took the orange and hand squeezed it into the solution and reduced the heat and reduced it until thickened!!!

I added broccoli to make this a complete dish. I didnt taste the orange or curry very much so I added the juice of half the orange and 1/2t more curry powder. My orange was very tart so I added a pinch or sugar as well
