UPDATE: 12/18/11  This is my go-to banana bread recipe. it is always super moist without being gummy, and is always a great way to use up buttermilk and those dark bananas. the darker the banana, the bigger the flavor. perfect recipe when wanting to use up bananas and buttermilk.  The flavor and texture were superb.  I added 1 extra banana, replaced applesauce for the oil, and 1/2 tsp. salt.  They were wonderfully moist with a great banana flavor.  I think 3 bananas is the way to go...most recipes call for 3 ripe ones.  I didn't have nuts or choc. chips but had butterscotch chips.  Oh wow!  These really made the recipe.  The combination of flavors was great.  1 tsp. of cinnamon is just enough to add a layer of flavor...it enhances the bananas and does not overpower.  Because the batter is nice and thick, nuts or chips won't sink to the bottom.  Came out beautifully golden brown.  Made these into muffins and made 18.

This was an excellent recipe. The cinnamon really added extra flavor. I used 3 large bananas for more banana flavor and used 1/4 tsp of salt. This bread did not last long!!

I added 4 bananas instead of two and also included 1/2 tsp of cardamom.  This by far, was the best banana bread I have ever made!!  It came out quite moist and just oozing with goodness!!

Cinnamon added a new twist to this recipe.  Disappointed that the bread didn't have more of a banana flavor.  
Hint: add black walnut flavoring to nuts the night before to get a REAL black walnut taste.

Great recipe. I added an extra banana and divided the batter. I also folded in re-hydrated cranberries into half of it. I made muffins instead of a loaf and used apple sauce instead of oil. The muffins were moist and flavorful. They weren't as "rich" as my grandmother's bread but I liked them better this way. They weren't heavy on my stomach and still gave me the banana flavor I wanted. I was planning on freezing half of them but they disappeared so fast I didn't get a chance too. My Mom and Husband loved them. Thanks for recipe!

definitely one of the better banana bread recipes i've tried from this site. i only had soymilk on hand and i had no walnuts and vanilla so i omitted those. i also cut the sugar and oil in half but i didn't notice much difference in the taste--maybe just not as sweet. i also added a third banana as someone suggested. and i mixed it by hand and the bread turned out just fine. the cinnamon adds a great flavor!

Came out very moist and very good. I made the chocolate chip variation, which went well with the banana and cinnamon flavors.  I like that it uses just two bananas, which is usually how many overly ripe bananas I end up with out of a bunch.

I've had better success with the Banana Sour Cream Bread on this site.  I added semi-sweet chips (a first for me) so perhaps it's a taste thing.  However, this one wasn't as moist and just didn't compare to the other recipe.

I made this banana bread for a bake sale. I followed the recipe and also added 1 more banana as others said. I used my electric mixer, I mashed the bananas using a fork, then added it into egg/sugar mixture. I also blended the flour/cinnamon mixture into the batter. After scrapping the bowl I licked the spoon and was amazed how it tasted. I used 2 small loaf pans. They are in the oven now and can't wait for them to come out. Thank you Sharon for sharing this recipe.

This banana bread came out beautifully for me.  It has just the right balance of texture, light and moist at the same time, not at all heavy.  There is plenty of banana flavor as well.  I love cinnamon in banana bread, so I doubled it.  A lot of banana breads I have to bake longer than 60 minutes, but this one was done on time.  Not wanting to get my blender dirty, I mixed it by hand and it was plenty easy enough.  Beautiful recipe!

Oh my goodness!  This is now my favorite.  Nice and tasty and moist!!!  I omimited the cinnamon and used the entire zest of a very large lemon instead--to brighten the flavor.  Wet batter that results in moist mini muffins, which took 25 minutes to bake.  Oh, used 3/4 C chopped pecans and topped each mini muffin with a pecan half.  Yield?  48 - 60 mini muffins.  A crowd pleaser.  Husband's coworkers went crazy over these.  Also good with orange zest in place of lemon zest.  Or add almond extract rather than vanilla and top with whole almonds.  Bottom line?  I have found "my" banana bread recipe!  Thank you, Nanna Towgood and Granddaughter Towgood for sharing.  That's what it's all about.  Now Nanna lives on in the hearts and mouths and stomaches of dozens of new admirers.  God bless her--and you, too!

I gave this banana bread recipe 5 stars because it is the best one I've ever made. The banana bread consistently comes out moist unlike other recipes I've tried. My family loves it and I have made it numerous times for ourselves and potlucks. The only ingredient I altered was using Saigon cinnamon instead of regular cinnamon. This was delicious!

I made this bread because I had buttermilk I wanted to use up lol.  I loved the bread...I substituted 1/2 c applesause for the oil to try to make it a little more healthy.  It still came out great (a beautiful loaf) but was a little chewy because of the substitution I think.

This is an absolute winner! So easy to make with very little prep involved. I added more walnuts and about 1/2 cup of pounded macadamia nuts to the mix too. Just awesome! The smell of this cooking wafted throughout the house and really hammered-home that fall feeling.

i didn't have any buttermilk so i substituted it for the same amount of peach yogurt. I didn't feel like digging up a loaf pan either so i put it into a 9x13 jelly roll pan and cooked it for about 20 minutes, and it came out amaaazing and super moist. definitely making this again!

instead of blending the ingredients together i just mashed the bananas into a plastic bag and cut a corner to squeeze it out; saves some dishes to clean and it was still yummyyy.

This is such an easy recipe! I mashed the bananas before adding and used a hand mixer to blend it all together.  I did forget to add vanilla but it was still awesome.

I did not care for this banana bread. I just realized though that I forgot to put the sugar in...it still tastes sweet though, just very bland. I don't think the sugar can fix that the extreme lack of flavor. Even though I can smell the banana, I can't taste it at all. I used half whole wheat/half regular flour and 2 med-large overripe bananas. The bread was moist and dense, but unlike any other banana bread I've made as its somewhat cake-like, not bread-like. Maybe I'll try it again with the sugar (oops!), but I've had other recipes that far exceeded the flavor of this one already, so I think I'll stick with those. Sorry, this one just didn't do it for me.

I had to come and rate this right away.  It's still warm from the oven but I had to have a slice.  This is a great bread.  It's texture is cake-ish but it's not over sweet.  I really wanted a banana bread that was really a bread and not just an oversized cupcake.  I didn't have 2 small bananas.  I only had 1 large but it worked just fine.  I was looking for a mild banana flavor and it is just perfect.  The only modifications I made was I had to make a substitution for the buttermilk with milk/lemon juice.  And, I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I like the milder flavor of pecans.  Good recipe.  Definately saving this one for future use.

I really liked this recipe alot!  I'd tried a different one, recently, and it came out tasting more like bread than anything.  The only changes I made was I used 3 medium-sized over-ripe bananas, instead of 2 small and I used 1/2c. brown sugar and 1/2c. white sugar, instead of 1c. white sugar.  I made this in my bread machine and my family LOVES it!

Delicious!  Even my husband loved it (and he hates everything).  I also used 3 large bananas instead of 2, turned out perfect.

I was looking forward to a great tasting banana bread.. I used about three or four small, but very very ripe bananas, and mashed them with a fork. The end result wasn't how I expected it to be. I actually thought it wasn't sweet enough. Suprisingly, my 6 year old picky brother actually liked it. Everyone else hated it. I felt sad because I hate to give low reviews. Nonetheless, I will find a way to tweak this!

I doubled the recipe, used two cups of banana puree, 2 T. of rum, a dash of maple flavoring then poured into 3 loaf pans, which I topped with a crumble and dusted with cinnamon sugar. They are beautiful!

perfect just the way it is.  I scaled the sugar back to 3/4 cup and had a 3rd banana so I added it.  Dense, chewy and perfect!  Next time I will increase the cinnamon for a more cinnamon-y wow!

Wonderful recipe! I added and extra tsp of vanilla and  used 3 bananas instead of two, otherwise the recipe is perfect. I take this to church often and everyone loves it.

My husband says this is what Banana Bread is supposed to taste like!  My minor adjustments were to use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and instead of buttermilk I used plain yogurt.  Looking forward to trying it with the chocolate chips. Next time I would like to try with butter rather than oil.

I tried using applesauce instead of oil and they turned out too fluffy and dry. I'll probably try one more time and follow the recipe to the T to see if that was the problem. However my 2 year old daughter LOVED them.She's a bit of a pasty lover just like her her mama =)

Really easy! I made muffins to shorten the baking time (25 minutes). As other reviewers suggested, I added an extra banana for more flavor. Yum.

This is a great basic banana bread recipe.  I have used nonfat milk (with vinegar added), soy milk and eggnog in place of the buttermilk and they all have turned out great!  I freeze my bananas when they are brown, so I can make banana bread when I want.  Just thaw them before use.  I also add a couple spoonfuls for ground flaxseed, just to sneek it in my kids bellies!

Family & friends gave this a thumb's up! Instead of 1 large loaf, I made 9 miniloaves which only takes 25 minutes to bake. I was a bit generous with the cinnamon. Overall hit!

Really happy with how this came out. Moist and flavorful. I used 3 over ripe bananas instead of 2 and added a little nutmeg. I still wish there was a way to make sure the outside doesnt cook faster and get crusty..cuz I'm one of the ones that hates the crust on the bread!
But all in all it was fantastic.

Yum!  This was my first banana bread and it was great!  I didn't even bother with sifting or using a blender.  Just mushed up the bananas and dumped everything else into the bowl.  Very easy and made the house smell so good.  I used chocolate chunks instead of walnuts.

I used brown sugar instead of white and all of my ripe bananas on hand, which happened to be 5. I tossed in some butterscotch chips as well. It turned out great. It is the best banana bread I have ever made! I really think that the blending of the wet ingredients makes all the difference. This was delicious! It will go in my permanent file for sure.

I like this recipe because whenever I have old bananas and need to make banana bread I only have one or two, so this recipe allows me to make great tasting bread with only a few bananas. Plus its so easy to use the blender!

I changed a few things...I did not put the bananas in a blender I just mashed them. Then I only used 3/4 cup of sugar. The vanilla I put one tablespoon and one teaspoon of rum flavor extract.

This is a really great banana bread recipe and everyone at work loved it.  I'm hanging onto this one!  I love that you blend the liquid ingredients together with the bananas.  My modifications were to reduce the sugar to 1/2 a cup and I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the dry ingredients.  I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of whole wheat flour as well.  I also made a crumb topping out of walnuts, about 1 T each flour, cinnamon and then cut in some butter.  I made 2 batches (had that many old bananas) and made 1 loaf of bread and 12 muffins.  325 convection oven for exactly 55 min worked perfect!

This is the best banana bread I've made on this website.  The texture is moist and perfect, and it's a pretty loaf, to boot.  The only change I made was to add an additional banana, as others suggested.  Wonderful!

I probably devoured a quarter of the loaf myself so must give it a high rating.  I substituted milk + apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk & added a ripe avocado (didn't know what else to do with it!).  Delicious.

This banana bread is insanely good. I did make some adjustments though. I used vanilla soy milk mixed with a teaspoon of vinegar to make it sour, because I didn't have regular milk... and I used almonds instead of walnuts. It smells amazing when it's cooking. It makes a lot of bread. I filled up 12 muffin tins, AND a loaf pan. I will definitely be keeping this recipe to make again and again.

Thanks Nanna, whoever you are!

I love this recipe for so many reasons!  I was looking for a banana bread recipe that called for oil so I could replace it with applesauce to make it healthier.  I love processing it in the blender- it makes it so easy to mash the bananas and mix the ingredients.  Yummy!

I lost my own Grandma's recipe a few years back and since she has passed I couldn't exactly get it from her again. So I have tried so many recipes these past few years in an effort to find a yummy one.. And I do believe I have found a winner. I did add an extra banana and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar because I remembered that much from my previous recipe. Since finding this recipe, my family has demanded it become a Sunday ritual in our house. I would recommend this to anyone needing an excellent recipe. Thank u so much for sharing

OH MY MY!  This was incredible!  The only enhancement I made was to use an additional banana.  Perfect flavor and texture.  Each time I've made it its devoured within the hour!

From Bev in CT
I do not normally like banana bread but my husband does so I made this recipe.  It was fantastic.  I make it at least once a week and make sure I always have ripe bananas in the freezer.  My only variation is that sometimes I add chopped dates or chocolate chips.  This recipe is truly a keeper.

I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 tablespoon vinegar.  I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, other than that, this is a great banana bread.

This is a great recipe.  I've tried it many times and I always use 3-4 bananas.  I cover with foil for the last 10 mins or so to ensure the bread doesn't get too dark.  Very moist and delicious.  My co-workers are always surprised at how moist it is.

Pretty good, although it could be a bit sweeter for my taste. Chocolate chips would be perfect! Also, be sure to remember the vanilla!! It's listed in the Ingredients list, but the directions forget to tell you to add it.

Great recipe!  I subbed sour cream for the buttermilk (same amount) since I didn't have any.  Didn't seem to affect the texture or taste at all.  Just need something acidic to use with the baking soda.  Made muffins and baked at 325 degrees (convection) for 25 minutes.

This bread came out really good! I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted plain lowfat yogurt and added 1/4c flaked coconut instead of walnuts (didn't have any on hand). It came out very tropical!

Very good banana bread that's a little lighter than others I've made and not quite as sweet.The buttermilk makes it really moist.I added a little cinnamon because I love the flavor it gives.I'm sure I'll be making this one again.

I have made this many times, for family and gifts. I have had giftees throw away their family recipe for banana bread when confronted with this one. Everyone always wants more, and I cannot keep enough bananas in the house to satisfy the wants.  Highly recommended.

I have made my share of banana breads over the years and thought I would try this one.  I always read reviews for I write reviews as well and normally do a little something different to a recipe.  I used a total of 6 VERY ripe bananas.  (Some may call them rotten)  I also added a small individual container  of apple sauce. (I would guess abut a half cup)  Put in about a 1/3 cup more walnuts than recipe and I lightly roasted with a little oil on top of the stove.  I find it always gives such a better flavor and is so quick to do for much better results.  Doubled the recipe which then made 4 small loaves and 1 medium loaf.  Cooked 45 minutes. Greased and floured and put parchment paper on bottom of pans which makes them come out very easy and not brown at all.  My toothpick came out clean but when I took them out of pan I wondered if they were cooked enough.  The answer is yes.....they were just very moist.  So many times banana bread can be dry and crumble which I hate.  Not this one!!  This is not a heavy banana bread but light and moist.

Tried this recipe today and loved it. The touch of vanilla and cinnamon added to it. I also added extra walnuts as my husband loves baked items with walnuts. Next time I may try half regular sugar and half brown sugar and more banana if I have some to use up. Excellent!!

Baked in an 8X8 glass and came out fantASTIC!  added carob chips (all I had on hand) used the 4 bananas like other recomm.  Also used safflower oil to make it healthier, subd. 1/2 sugar for brown sugar, 1/2 flour is wheat and accidentally used 2 t of baking soda and no powder (I have one brand of deceptive baking soda that looks just like powder in the round container...  grrr SNEAky!0  Raised well above my expectations maybe THAT was a good switch?  sifted all dries and did wets in the blender.  The bread is beautiful, will make again!

Very nice banana bread - I made two loaves, so I doubled everything except the oil, used egg substitute and half whole wheat "white" flour, and didn't quite double the sugar as it seemed like a lot.  I also had a total of 6 small bananas to use up, and I noticed that a lot of reviewers used three instead of two when making one loaf, so I used them all.  Great banana flavor, nice moist texture - the hint of cinnamon is just right for this if you use a little more banana.  I did skip the whole blender part and just mushed everything up instead.  Thanks Sharon!

Just used this recipe this morning.  I am always looking for recipes that use buttermilk and this one fit the bill.  I try to use more whole wheat when baking so used 1 cup wheat and one cup all purpose.  Also cut the oil in half substituted cinnamon applesauce.  It was the best banana bread I've ever baked. My search for the best banana bread recipe is over!

I made this recipe with 2 large, very ripe bananas.  I added mini choc chips and walnuts.  This was very easy to make and had delicious flavor.  Will definitely be making this banana bread regularly.  Thank you!

Very tasty...I asked my son 4 or 5 stars, he said 4, because there isn't enough of it! lol.  I used equal parts whole wheat and white flour, next time may try all whole wheat, as I like a dense texture anyway.  Also 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 oats is a nice combo. Cut back on the sugar, about 3/4 cup, and used 3 good sized over ripe bananas.  Excellent!  Update: I have also made this using coconut oil and about 1/2 cup of honey or maple syrup.  Yum.

I liked the cinnamon, and the general flavor, and it was very easy to prepare.  However, I thought the texture was a bit rubbery.  I substituted applesauce for oil, so maybe that was the cause, but I prefer more of a traditional crumb.  A side note -- butterscotch chips are great in it!

this is very good! the only thing i did different is add an extra banana, used applesauce instead of oil and put in a tiny bit of nutmeg. the bread is moist and delicious but i think you should use 3 bananas.

My mother has declared this the best banana bread she's ever had.  I substitute brown sugar for white and either use 2 large bananas or 3 small.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I have used the same banana bread recipe for years (it was my Nana's) but recently I wanted to make some bread and I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I found this recipe and tried it out and it was delicious!!  I was skeptical about the cinnamon but it adds a really nice flavor.  Very subtle. I also used 3 bananas and it turned out great.  I will make this bread over and over. I made this to feed to the coaches and officials at a track meet a couple seasons ago and now the coaches request it every season.

Really good! My kiddos loved it....I subbed all of the oil with applesauce and I used 4 bananas that were frozen and thawed. Instead of the nuts, I added 1/2c mini chocolate chips. Delicious, I tasted it and a great way to use up some buttermilk which was low fat by the way. Thanks!

I loved this recipe, and it was so easy to make!  I did have to make some small adjustments though.  I did not have any buttermilk so I substituted 1/2 cup light sour cream.  I wanted to try using less oil  to be a little healthier so I used almost half a cup of apple sauce and 2 tbs veg oil.  My family loved it.  Very glad I found this one.  Thanks!

This recipe is the BEST!!! I've been making banana bread for years, and never seemed just right.  UNTIL NOW!!  Awesome, moist, flavorful..I didn't have buttermilk~so I used 1/2C of milk & 1/2tsp of lemon juice.

This banana bread is SO wonderful, very moist and sweet. I doubled the amount of bananas but did everything else just as written. No one in my family likes nuts, so we went with the chocolate chips. I used the mini chocolate chips because they stay suspended in the batter better and you don't end up with just chocolate chips on the bottom. Will definitely be making again...and again.

Good recipe, soft bread, not too sweet, I did not have buttermilk so used 1/2 cup regular milk with one tsp of white vinegar added to it.  Will be making this recipe again.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've found on Allrecipes.com.  I did not have any buttermilk but googled it for a substitution and found that you can make it in 5 minutes...1/2 tblspn of vinegar OR lemon juice, fill rest of liquid measuring cup with milk to reach the 1/2 cup line and let it sit for 5-10 minutes - WA LA that easy!  I also used 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips which adds a little extra sweetness, so yummy! Thanks Sharon for this treasure!

I made a double batch of this recipe and it came out wonderfully.  The bread was sooo moist I couldn’t believe it.  The only change I made was in using three large bananas (six in a double batch), rather than two small ones.  The bread itself had a nice combo of flavors, and between the banana, cinnamon, and chocolate chips no one flavor really overpowered the others.  This recipe is a keeper; thank you Nanna!

Quick and Easy to make, but tastes absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and was really happy with the delicious flavors of banana with a hint of cinnamon! I am going to teach my 11 year old how to make it today - it is simply enough that he will be able to make it on his own, once i've shown him how to do it.

Dee-licious.  Used sour cream instead of buttermilk (equal measurement), applesauce instead of vegetable oil (equal measurement), 3 bananas that were 1/2 liquified inside the peel (best bananas to use!), halved the cinnamon, 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cut dark brown sugar, and added a large chopped mango for fun.  Mango was unexpectedly awesome.  Next time I'm trying rum instead of vanilla extract, like a previous person suggested.

Loved this recipe! I made a double batch, and instead of using all of the nuts, I did half nuts and half semisweet chocolate chips.  We loved the results! Thanks for sharing your Nanna's recipe! :)

This is a good banana bread.  Bakes up nicely, it's moist, and was enjoyed.  I did double the banana's, as I read in the suggestions, and I'm glad I did, because with 4 banana's it had just enough banana taste. But it's missing ... something in the overall flavour.  It's a little too plain, kinda bland.  I'm thinking this recipe needs some other spices.  Maybe some more cinnamon?  An addition of nutmeg, allspice, ground cloves?  Not sure what, but something ... In any case, as a base recipe, this is wonderful, and it will be enjoyed if you decide to go with it. Again, definitely double the banana's.  :)  Bake time doesn't change or anything with the additional ... liquid? ... it would be a liquid I'd think, after all that blending.  Anyway, took me 55 minutes in a glass bread dish, just as prescribed. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good, except I overcooked a bit and that is a no-no with banana bread.  I think adding more cinnamon might be a good idea because I thought it was a little hard to notice.  Otherwise, very nice recipe.

we doubled this recipe easily, I always use overripe bananas, nice and black.  We also added 3 handfuls of choc chips and 2 handfuls of chopped pecans before folding into the flour mix.  I used one stoneware and one regular bread pan, they were done at the same time, 55 minutes.  Bread is moist and delicious, chips and nuts are well spread.  I would add more spices next time, maybe 1 more tsp of cinnamon, or a mix of nutmeg.

This is a fabulous banana bread!  I added 1 more banana and think it needs that.  I love mixing the "wet team" in the blender - how handy.  This makes a very large loaf, so the 2nd time I made it I split it into two smaller loaves and baked for 45 minutes.  Just great!

I have a banana bread recipe that I like that uses sour cream; but for those times that I have buttermilk and no sour cream, this is a great substitute recipe. Came out moist; browned nicely. I did put foil over the top near the end to keep it from browning too much. Used mini chocolate chips in place of walnuts.

Very simple. Only substitution I made was using a stick of margerine in place of the  vegetable oil. It smells wonderful.

Update:  This gets much better after sitting for a few days!  I had a slice this morning (4 days after baking), and it was very good.  If you don't like the initial results, wrap it up and wait a couple days.
-------------
This was good, but missing something.  Another reviewer mentioned adding one more banana, which might do the trick.  My husband thinks it needs more sugar, but I like the sweetness as is. I didn't have any buttermilk, so used fat free plain yogurt instead, which worked out fine.  I also added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg.  I will probably give this another try.

This recipe is delicious!!  I used applesauce instead of oil, and 3 bananas.  My children ate it warm from the oven and they cannot stop talking about it.  I had to go hide a few pieces for their Dad to try when he gets home.  Very delicious with a handful of chocolate chips.  Will be making this over and over.

Oh my!  This recipe is pure banana bread goodness.  I did not have any buttermilk so I just used the 2% milk I had on hand--it's late night and I was desperate. This is THE best banana bread I have ever had.  This one is a definite keeper.  I am going to gather all of my other banana bread recipes, set them alight and dance around them. Thank you soooooooo much for sharing this!

Made this last night-only a little piece left. I had to use up 3 bananas, also used 1/2 cup white sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. Turned out great!

Lovely moist banana bread!  I followed the recipe exactly, baked it in my countertop convection oven with excellent results. The recipe is super fast and easy!   Mashing bananas up to make banana bread is kind of messy...blending them with the wet ingredients is much less so...  Flavourings were excellent and could be adapted to taste.

I love this recipe! My family loves banana bread and I have tried many recipes.  This is by far the easiest to prepare and clean up. It is also delicious.  I have added an additional banana as recommended by another reviewer.

Way to go Nanna!  I am always looking for the better banana bread recipe and this one was WONDERFUL!  I needed to use up some bananas and I also had buttermilk in the fridge that was going to waste so this worked great for me.  I made the recipe as stated except for using brown sugar instead of white. I added 4 small bananas and made 2 small loaves instead of 1 large.  I put walnuts in one loaf and choc. chips in the other and they were both great.  It took about 35min for the smaller loaves to bake.  YUM!  I plan to use this recipe from now on.  Thanks for a keeper.:P

I cannot overstate how wonderful this banana bread is.  This has become my only banana bread recipe and I get asked for it every time I bring a loaf somewhere.  The only thing I changed is I omit the cinnamon and walnuts.  This bread has a little bit of crunch to the crust, the perfect amount of sugar and is perfectly moist without being dense or wet.  My husband is a vegan so I make a vegan loaf for him too using Ener-G Egg replacer and soymilk with a splash of lemon juice added for the buttermilk.  Perfection every time!

I liked this recipe because it did not ask for anything fancy other than buttermilk (not a staple for me).  I substituted and added like crazy - 2 large bananas, added 1/4 c. cocoa powder, added small amt fresh minced ginger, added some fresh grapefruit zest, sliced almonds and whole milk instead of the buttermilk.  Came out great but a tiny bit drier than I like which is my fault b.c. I added the cocoa. However, the coca was especially nice. I might next time add another banana because the banana taste was not very strong and maybe add some more milk to compensate for the cocoa.

I did not have buttermilk on hand, so I measured 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice in a liquid measuring cup and then added milk to the one-cup line.  I let it sit about 10 minutes then measured slightly more than 1/2 cup.  The bread turned out great!  Very moist and delicious!

This bread needs more banana flavor. Next time i will add 2 more mashed bananas in addition to the 2 in the blender.  Right now i made a spread of mashed banana and applesauce and it's the perfect topping!!

this was the best recipe I've tried, and I've tried quite a few.  I added a teaspoon of ground cloves as well to spice it up.  I also used 4 small bananas to make it extra moist.

I wanted a more spiced sort of Banana Bread, so I added 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the recipe, as well as used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar. It worked out well, and this turned out to be a nice, moist bread. Its not as dense as some other banana breads I've had before... so my search continues. But still quite good!

I made this with gluten-free all purpose flour and it came out great! Very moist and flavorful. I added walnuts and chocolate chips. I was a little short on time and made it into muffins which cut the baking time to 20 minutes.

Over 20 years ago, I made banana bread similar to this recipe & it was the very best, unfortunately, I lost the recipe. I have been diligently searching for a banana bread recipe with buttermilk in it for months, and this one looks like a winner!

The cinamon covered the banana flavor completely and thats even when I more than doubled the amount of bananas. So cinnamon is a no-go with banana bread.

This turned out really good! I am a lousy baker, and this was easy to make. Loved the use of the blender. I did add chocolate chips, and my husband said,' this would be good even without the chocolate chips'. It's a keeper! Thanks.

I made this today and was blown away - I have been making banana bread for years and this is amazing. I used about a cup of butterscotch chips and raisins in the recipe. So yummy, moist and flavorful. I could eat the whole loaf myself. Thank you for such a great recipe

This recipe was quite enjoyable, but I had to add another banana, split the sugar in half to add another half of brown, added equal amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg, and added 1/2 cup of apple sauce. The flavors were good, and the banana bread was moist!

My husband is a huge fan of bananas. He said this was the best banana bread he had ever had, it was so moist and flavorful. The only thing I did different was add 4 bananas instead of the 2 the recipe suggested.

This is, by far, the best banana bread I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly.. only omitting the walnuts. My kids despise them! I gave it 4 stars, just in case there's a better recipe out there.. but I'll definitely be sharing this one with my family!

I am not a fan of banana bread but my family is. I found this recipe close to 10 years ago and have not made banana bread any other way since. Every body that tries this bread raves about it. Thank you for sharing a family recipe it is now one of my family’s favorite.

Excellent recipe!!!!! Makes tasty and moist banana bread. I especially like it because it only calls for 2 bananas, I never seem to have 3 ripe ones for some reason. Only change I made was I used 1/2 cup light vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk. It makes it even more moist (and I never have buttermilk on hand). Next time ill try applesauce instead of oil like others have suggested.

I subbed applesauce for the oil like some other reviewers, and I don't know if that made the difference, but this bread was overly moist, it was kind of gross.  I am all for a moist bread, but this was lacking typical banana bread texture. I dont know how to describe it, other than it was more like the consistency of the brown bread you can buy in a can?  Not what I was expecting. I also added chocolate chips, but they all sank to the bottom. I would probably dust them with flour if I made again.  The batter was so liquidy I feel like anything that I put in would sink anyway.  The taste was not bad...but I just could not get over the texture.

Great! Doubled recipe to make 2 loaves. Slight changes for doubling: 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla; 1 1/2 c. sugar; natural with cinnamon applesauce instead of oil; This would be even better with nuts or chocolate chips. As is, it's not too sweet - just right; also adding applesauce instead of oil improves the taste for us!

This is my favorite banana bread recipe. I make it following the directions exactly, with this minor exception.. I don't use a blender for the wet ingredients. I instead use my KitchenAid stand mixer with the paddle attachment.

I have used several recipes to make banana nut bread but this is by far the best! Some were just too moist to the point of a doughy taste. Others were dry. This one was perfect! It was moist but very well held together. This will be my go to banana nut bread recipe! My family agrees!

Used milk because that’s all I had (rather than buttermilk). Added choc. Chips rather than nuts. Delicious!!

I made exactly as written. Decided to try the chocolate chips for something different.  Spot on!  The cinnamon was an interesting addition for banana bread.  My family loved it.  Will be making this again.

This recipe is easily becoming my favorite. I did use 3 banana and increased the salt to 1/4tsp as was suggested in another review. I do recommend letting it rest for a min of 15 min like muffins so you get a nice rise on the top.

I have been making this bread for a couples years now.  It’s always a hit.  I make a topping to go on top to add crunch.  I put crumbled butter, brown sugar, pecans, flour and oatmeal on top when it’s raw and cook it same as directions.  Yummy

I agree with others, it’s not sweet enough.  It was blah over all. My crust ended up over done. Next time I will bake it at a lower temp.

I was looking for a good banana bread recipe and I finally found one! I didn’t have any walnuts.  I also wanted to double the recipe.  I used three bananas for each one.  It took an hour and 10 minutes to bake in two bread pans.  It is delicious.  I already ate too much!!! My picky kid loves it too!

The bread was FANTASTIC!  I lost my recipe years ago but remembered most of the ingredients, and this recipe was as close as I remember.  I did NOT use the blender, my wooden spoon was my go to utensil.  Thank you

This is a great banana nut bread.  It is moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  I used three large really ripe bananas.   I used pecans because I had them on hand.   I also  covered the bread with foil about 10 minutes before removing from oven.   When I removed it from the oven, it was picture perfect with the bread rising higher than the pan and the top of the bread a golden brown.  It's a winner when something taste as good as it looks.  A keeper for sure.

A blender! I loved that the wet ingredients are mixed together with a blender! Never thought of that before. Just slice the bananas in and go. The batter was much thinner than I was used to, so that worried me a bit, but bread came out moist and delicious - a little heavy, but that's OK for banana bread, imo. My family doesn't like nuts, so I had to leave those out, which was a bummer. They would have made a delicious texture contrast to the bread, I'm sure.  I also added 3 bananas, per other reviews. The only other thing I did differently is use 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 milk for the 1/2 cup buttermilk. (I do this for a lot of recipes - I rarely have buttermilk, always have sour cream.) Will definitely make again and again. Thank you for sharing it!!

I have made this for decades- great.  My preference is to only use real butter and 1/2 brown 1/2 raw sugar.  When I don't have buttermilk I cheat and use milk in which I add a little white vinegar or lemon juice to sour the milk (takes about 5 min. )

This is my favorite recipe. Never dry. 
Honestly I always use extra banana in any recipe for extra flavor.  This recipe I found needs 2 to 2 1/2 LG bananas to let the flavor through.

This was the moistest banana bread I've ever made. The only changes I made were an extra banana and to substitute  cinnamon applesauce for the oil to save some calories since I knew I would eat the heck out of it. I stayed moist for DAYS. I kept it wrapped up in press -n-seal wrap. My only complaint was that I added too many chocolate chips, but that has nothing to do with the recipe. I'm making it again this weekend. Sooooooo good.

I made it like the recipe but substituted pecans for walnuts as we like pecans. I say it was ok because the banana flavor was not what I expected. I think next time I will make my usual recipe or try this one with an extra banana and a splash of rum and maybe use brown sugar instead of white. This did come out light with a firm crisp crust and a moist inside but just not as full bodied in the banana flavor I was looking for.

I have tried virtually every banana bread recipe  on this site and this is the best by far. I used 2C of whole wheat flour and 1 C Splenda. I spaced out and whisked the sweetener in with the other dry ingredients, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The bananas I wanted to use up were almost 2 C, so I reduced the temperature to 325 degrees and added 15 minutes of baking time. The result was a tall, perfect, moist loaf with a great texture. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I'll be making it often

The best we've ever tasted! I added a bit more salt & substiuted 1/2 the buttermilk with sour cream. Doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13 glass pan. Used hazelnuts and increased the amount to 1.5 cups.  Brushed top with butter while warm. Most excellent delicious recipe!

I only had two over ripe bananas and this turned out very yummy! Most recipes call for three bananas, I was so happy when I found this one! Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe! Delicious breakfast with my morning coffee!

Wow nice moist bread. It is a light banana taste just add more banana if you like. I liked this recipe because it only had 1 cup of sugar. I also had enough batter for two pans which to me was a bonus! 
Baked at 325 for 45 minutes in a convection oven it turned out perfect.

I really like this banana bread. Kids loved it, the only change I did for healthy reasons I used coconut oil and coconut sugar. And used 3 large bananas

Great recipe.  This reminds me of the recipe my mother used.  In her recipe it called for shortening, sour milk and a mixer.  This was so easy to throw together.  I made muffins instead of a loaf.  The time was less than half and slightly browned like my wife and daughter likes it best.  You could use chopped pecans or walnuts, but I would say to toast them before adding them to the the mix.  This recipe made about 20 standard muffins for me.  Great recipe, fast, easy and most of all tasty.

I love Great Harvest Bread Company's banana chocolate chip bread and this recipe is as close as I have come to replicating it. It has a light banana flavor, which I prefer, and is dense and rich. The half cup chocolate chips was enough for me, but you may want to add more if you like a good amount of chocolate. I did not use a blender. I just put the two whole bananas in my KitchenAid and mashed them before adding the remaining wet ingredients and sugar. Worked great! Will be making this recipe from now on!

I used melted butter and coconut sugar. Super moist and not too heavy. I'd use oil as a last resort because butter makes everything better!

I needed to use up some buttermilk & bananas so I did an ingredient search and came up with this recipe.  I made it exactly as written (please people with the healthy substitutions-if I wanted healthy I wouldn't make a sweet bread!).  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there was not quite enough banana flavor.  I think if 1 additional banana were added it would be a 5 star.  The texture is nice and fine (but not soggy) and the spices are just right. I think using the blender instead of a mixer added to the fine texture. I did have to bake it for an additional 8 minutes but that may be because I used a glass loaf pan instead of metal (or maybe my oven is off a bit). BTW, don't forget the vanilla - it's listed in the ingredients but not in the instructions.  I added to the blender mix.

I really like this recipe. I did add a touch more banana and it def. took more than 55-60 min. I had to go out so I shut off oven and opened the door a little and it was perfect when I came home. I like the raise of the bread and the moistness.

I love this recipe. I always tweek it by using nonfat or lowfat yogurt instead of buttermilk. I also have used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar and half a cup of maple syrup. It comes out delicious and moist!

I accidentally forgot the sugar once.  The sugar free version did not get votes, i.e.; I had to throw it away since no one would eat it.  Greet recipe.

This is the best banana bread recipe I’ve found! I replace the nuts with chocolate chips (or omit altogether if I don’t have any on hand). I also make my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar. We make this weekly in our house. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I've made this banana bread over and over. Sometimes as a bread, most often as muffins (for the portability factor). It's awesome! I usually add a third ripe banana (making it 3 bananas instead of 2) and some semi-sweet chocolate chips (usually a cup). I often use olive oil (as I don't normally have vegetable oil) and it turns out great. 

I can make a double recipe and it still doesn't last long around here!

This was great bread, even though I overcooked it.  I added 1.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for added yum, and I did not have any buttermilk so I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2.

This is my new 'go to' recipe for banana bread.  It comes out great every time!  We omit the nuts due to an allergy here, but otherwise use the recipe as is.  Good stuff!!!
