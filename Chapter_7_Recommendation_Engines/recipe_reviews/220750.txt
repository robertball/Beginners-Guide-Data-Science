Tasty soup. I did think it needed salt and some heat. I like the contrast of sweet sweet potatoes with a little zip, so I added some chipotle chili powder. My only change was to use a mixed bag of baby greens ( kale, chard and spinach) instead chard. Baby green are more tender imho.. nice dinner

Very good. My kiddos loved it. I didn't have couscous so I served over rice, and I used chicken broth instead of water. It is delicious!!!!!
