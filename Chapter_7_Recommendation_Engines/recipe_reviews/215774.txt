OMG! This was so easy, inexpensive & D-lish! First time ever making & eating Kugel. The only thing I did different was that I mixed in the brown sugar instead of sprinkling it on top. Will make again!

Best kugel I have ever made.  I used the balloon whip in my Kitchenaid mixer to make whipped cottage cheese.  And Kugel is really my name.

This recipe was perfect. I used an immersion blender to whip my cottage cheese until smooth. That was so easy!  I added 1 cup dark raisins to the cheese mixture before baking.  This kugel was scrumptious!

I thought this recipe was a bit strange.  It was a little too sugary for me, half way between a meal and dessert with not a whole lot of flavor other than the sugar (and I LOVE sugar).  

It was also difficult to get it cooked thouroughly in the center since I doubled the recipe.  So I had to cook it for an extra 30 minutes.  I definitely plan on making this again, but next time i'm sure it will be great if I cut the sugar in half, and also add something that will compliment the sugar like 1 lb of breakfast sausage.

Delicious!  I've been making various versions of noodle kugels found in various Jewish cookbooks.  While I was on Allrecipes I came across this one and decided to make it.  I added some (not too much) cinnamon and it was perfect!  Wouldn't change anything else!  The whole family loved it,

Itâ€™s good and easy for a six year old to put together, minus the parsley that was for something else... ha ha ha.

This was the first noodle Kugel I've ever made (and I'm Jewish!). I'm actually used to them being dry and burned on the top.  This one was nothing like those.  It was moist, not burned, and delicious!  I highly recommend it.  Even my picky husband loved it and had 3 servings of it!

I did make 1 small change - I used a can and a quarter of Coconut Milk as a substitute for the sour cream, simply because I don't like sour cream, and I'm also lactose intolerant.  I also used lactose-free cottage cheese, but I don't like the taste or consistency of lactose-free sour cream.   I think that it would still be delicious with sour cream though. 

Thank you so much for posting this excellent recipe!

I love this recipe I make it every time my family gets together the only change I make is that i leave out the brown sugar it is already sweet enough.

I tried this again and I think it wasn't creamy enough for me and a bit too sugary.
