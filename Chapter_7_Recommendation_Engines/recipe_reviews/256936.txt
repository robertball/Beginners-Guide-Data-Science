I thought there was a little to much sesame flavor and will cut back some next time but it was great will definitely be making again. Added cilantro this time for color and will add in some jalapeno next time for some kick.

Quick, simple and DELICIOUS!
The only variations to this recipe that I made were using Hawaiian red salt in lieu of sea salt, going heavy on the sesame oil, and I added a a little sriracha.

I loved the ease of throwing this together! I didn't do the nuts or seeds but used finely minced garlic and red onion. It was delicious with some brown rice. Nice, easy and light meal ready fairly quick. Thank u.
