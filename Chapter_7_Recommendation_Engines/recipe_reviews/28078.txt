Off the hook. I did have to triple the coating(and I did add garlic and onion powder) and I didn't have gruyere, so I used mozzerella. I followed the recipe exact otherwise. My husband and I nommed all through dinner, he even said that dinner was a pleasant surprize. Taste-wise, I compare it to French Onion Soup but on chicken. This would be a great company dinner or comfort food for family. I served this with a browned garlic rice and steamed broccoli. A+! NOTE: I suggest you don't do what I did and not pound out the chicken. You want the thinness and tenderness that pounding/flattening provides. Otherwise, you have a tough though very tasty chicken breast. NOTE: If you want to make this into a sandwich, just cut the chicken into strips after cooking, cook the mushrooms together with a bit of the white wine and butter and assemble the "filling" on hoagie buns, broiling briefly with the cheese openfaced. My husband thought this up and this
is how he prefers this recipe now. I have to say it's a great idea.

Despite its fancy name leading you to think you're in for something exceptional, this is still nothing more than cooked chicken with some cooked mushrooms and onions with melted cheese on top. While it was acceptable, I'd call this just average and certainly not a memorable palate pleaser. In addition to its being a rather basic chicken recipe with not much flavor or complexity, I believe that if cooked as directed you'd end up with some TOUGH, basic chicken. Once browned, the chicken needs no more than 20 minutes of additional time in the oven, and that's UNcovered. This chicken is so plain and nondescript that at least you won't offend anyone's tastebuds. I substituted shallots for the onion and added fresh garlic, but neither was enough to wake this up.

Very lovely dish Rebecca! I dipped my chicken into an egg wash before dredging it in the flour. I added more seasonings to the flour such as garlic and onion powders and a shake of Mrs. Dash. Due the the ridiculous price of Gruyere, I subbed with Asiago and it was delicious. A splash of fat free half and half to the wine sauce made a nice addition. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that my whole family loved.

This was a great, fast, easy dinner! I used half Gruyere and half grated Parmesan. I also added about 1 tsp. of fresh lemon juice and a small clove minced garlic.   It was wonderful served with buttered vermicelli noodles and steamed green beans.   A quick recipe I WILL make again-- my hubby loved it.

My family really enjoyed this.  Next time, I will brown the onions (similiar to French Onion Soup) once brown, add the mushrooms and saute for a few minutes and then add the wine.

I made this for the gang at work - huge hit!! I used everything in the recipe but not the exact amounts - "eyeballed" it - as I like LOTS of mushroooms and a fair amount of cheese. I will definitely make this again and again.

This is a great recipe for chicken that tastes a lot harder than it is.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful--perfect over rice.  Just add steamed veggies and you've got a great meal!

I was a little skeptical of this recipe, because I am not a big fan of wine (pretty much never drink the stuff), but I figured "you only live once."  Turned out quite good.  The mushrooms and onions were cooked and tender, as was the chicken.  The flavor of the wine is much less overwhelming than when you drink it in a glass, so even you wine-haters should really give it a go!

This recipe was good, but the whole dish seemed a bit bland to me.  The mushrooms, onion, and white wine just didn't give it enough "kick" of flavor.  My beau said he liked it, but I've seen him react much more favorably to other chicken recipes on this site.

I thought this was great, and will make again for sure.  I did swap the wine for chicken broth as I detest wine, even in cooking.  I will make again for sure, although I will add more dill next time as I couldn't detect it at all, and I think it would add an interesting flavor.

I loved this!!!!!!!!!  I skipped the oven step and just took the chicken out while I cooked the veggies then put it on top of the veggies to melt the cheese!  I added a little garlic powder/onion powder to the flour!  Very easy but elegant meal!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Completely in love with this dish!! I cut it down to two servings. Butterflied two breasts, so they were quite thin. I'll admit that I did not measure anything, but I used all of the ingredients. I think an addition of garlic to the onion/mushroom mixture would be advisable, but it was good as is. My chicken didn't need anywhere *near* 40 minutes in the oven...it was practically done after the browning, so I cooked it for about 10 minutes, added the Gruyere (one of my favorite cheeses and not nearly expensive where I live as some others have mentioned) and cooked it for about four more minutes, until the cheese was melted. Served with asparagus and a salad, it was a lovely Sunday evening supper and I have two pieces left for lunch. Do give this a try...even if you pay $10 for the cheese, it's worth it.

This was okay but not fantastic, as a lot of other reviewers said. I was hoping I would agree with all the reviewers that loved it. I added garlic powder, onion powder, crushed red pepper flakes and basil to the flour mixture but my family still said "It was boring" and "It was okay but don't make it again". My mom did really like the mushrooms though. I just think the sauce needs something... it's basically just wine and butter, and while it smelled fantastic, only tasted fine not fabulous. We ate it (and my mom somewhat reluctantly took leftovers to work for lunch) but most likely won't make again, unless I come up with a bright idea to jazz up the sauce.

Very yummy!  But agree with others that the actual chicken was lacking flavor.  The mushroom onion sauce was amazing though! I've made this twice.  Once with white wine and dill as called for.  Once with dry sherry and thyme.  Really preferred the sherry and thyme. I can't see where 8oz of gruyere is needed.  I used about 4 and it was still very cheesy.  I will make this again but maybe marinade or season the chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent base but it needs more flavor.  Maybe more dill or something.  We enjoyed it and with some tweaking will make it again.  As is, it's not memorable.

Made this last night. Hubby scarfed it down in a heartbeat, it was so delicious! Like others suggested, substituted swiss cheese for the Gruyere and frankly, it tasted just as good. Added a bit of garlic salt to the onions and mushrooms while sauteeing.   We ate late, so didn't make a big meal out of this, just served with some garlic bread. But I can see how this would go perfectly with some asparagus or with a side green salad. The dish is very rich (and buttery) so you'll want to pair it with something light. I also definitely plan on using this to top steak some night.   All in all, definitely adding this to my list of recipes to keep!

Outstanding! I didn't change a thing.  I would recommend buying the most expensive cheese you can find as it really makes a huge difference in the outcome of any dish.  I've made this twice, both with great results!

This is an delicious, easy meal that's a weekday treat.  Served with wild rice and a green veggie and a glass of chardonnay.  the flavor is subtle and if you like more spice, you may want to add garlic or be more aggressive with your favorite herb.  I used rosemary instead of the dill. I upped the breast halves to 6 and the wine to a cup.  When I make this again and to thicken the additional wine,  I will sprinkle a tablespoon of flour on the bottom of the banking dish before pouring the wine/mushroom sauce over the chicken.  The gruyere cheese is a nice change, it has the creaminess of swiss and the salty bite of shredded parmesan.  thanks for the great recipe, Rebecca!

Sorry for the low rating -- but this was a huge disappointment.  I am surprised with the other reviewers who raved about this, as we found this dish WAY too bland.  The tasteless chicken was one thing, but I didn't think the presentation was "company-worthy" either...  Based on all the good reviews, I was hoping for something great....

Very tasty.  A little salt and cracked black pepper needs to be added to the wine as it is reducing, but otherwise a great recipe.

I was a little disappointed with this one - it't didn't have garlic (what is French cooking without garlic?) so I added some, but it still seemed a little bland.

Simple and tasty. I read the reviews before trying the recipe out and added a few things to "kick it up a notch." Just for something different I sauteed the onions and mushrooms with chopped up ginger root. I baked everything in the oven like it says but added sliced up apple in the dish while everything baked. Everything was in the oven for just over 20 minutes and that seemed to be perfect. I found that it's not necessary to serve on rice considering the chicken with everything on it is already quite filling. I had chopped up veggies on the the side. Next time I'll probably try using a cooking oil instead of all the butter.

My husband and I loved this!  The chicken was juicy and had great flavor.  I might try adding a little garlic next time.  We did make one change and used swiss instead of the Gruyere cheese.  I would absolutely recommend!

I hate to rate a recipe when I did not follow as directed. I did not have any dill weed. I used Lowry's, pepper and italian seasoning to season the flour. I also used 2 cloves of garlic when sauteing the mushrooms and onion. I also did not have gruyere so I used Edam. I really thought it was a delicious and moist dish. Thank you for posting.

I thought this was really good.  The gruyere cheese makes the dish.  I love cheese, so I used more than indicated.  Will definatly repeat

I made this exactly as written and it was delish.  My husband loved it.  We will definitely make this again. If you want a kicked-up version, adding additional spices would be great.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and we just loved it!  The sauteed mushrooms and onions along with the white wine went beautifully with the chicken.  Flavors were like fireworks!  Served it with wild rice, sweet peas, and butter rolls.  Complimented with a nice Riesling wine.  Scrumptious! :)  It was also surprisingly easy to make!

I loved this recipe! I made it exactly as directed except for substituting basil in for dill, because I did not have any dill on hand. I also used dried parsley instead of fresh. I thought that this recipe came out great, it was better than eating out in my opinion! My only concern was that this took about 35 minutes to prep. all ingredients and then  around 12 minutes to brown the chicken and then 30 minutes of baking. I will be making this again!

This was a very delicious, satisfying dish. I wouldn't call it quick, but not overly complicated, either. The best "change" I made was to use the original recipe, but use 6 medium sized chicken breasts. I put 4 in one cassarole dish and two in another smaller one so they were all laying flat. I just divided the mushroom/onion/wine mixture over them and gave each piece it's fair share of cheese at the end, and it worked out great! This way I made more without multiplying any ingredients (esp the pricey cheese). I did use the gruyere, which was $10 for the 8 ounces. That didn't bother me as much as having to shred all of it. If you can buy it shredded, do it. That would cut of 1/2 the prep time. I followed the recipe exactly, other than only left it in the oven until the cheese melted at the end, less than 10 min. I did cover the dish in the oven as stated in the recipe, which I will do again. The chicken was moist and tender, and I didn't pound it before hand. The breasts were not the huge ones you sometimes get in frozen bags, though. If they were, I can see they may need some pounding. Served over rice with yeast rolls and peas on the side. The peas were probably overkill, as the mushrooms and onions certainly provide enough veggies for one meal.

I paid over $7.00 for half a pound of this cheese. I expected this to be an over the top recipe. While it WAS good, I was expecting a "WOW" factor that I just never really got.  *edit* I forgot to say that my 3 youngest did not like this. Maybe it was the combination of cheese on top of the chicken. If I make this again, I will use different cheese and it will be made only for the adults. Still 4 star worthy.

This recipe was good but not great.  I tried it because of the high rating and number of reviews but if I were to make this again I would make it on the stove top rather than dirty multiple dishes and I would also use about half as much cheese.  I think the amount of cheese over-powered the sauce which did have a very nice flavor to it.  I would thicken the sauce slightly, as well.  Thanks Rebecca.

This was a nice light dish....and quick and easy to prepare.  I used a Reisling wine that we had on hand...would have turned out better with a dryer wine such as a Chardonnay.  More gruyere cheese would be a great addition as well.

First I must say that I'm not a fan of any kind of smothered meats.  I made this for my husband as he tried it at a restaurant and loved it; however, the restaurant recipe was a bit different and I may try it their way next time. I think there were way too many mushrooms and the onions should have been diced.  I will also kick up the spices in the flour as the flavor was bland.  I will also add sliced tomato on top of the chicken (restaurant recipe) before the cheese.  Hubby is not a fan of tomatoes but loves them this way.  Oh, and don't forget to pound the chicken!  Very important!

I gave this 5 stars!  What a great recipe to share with guests.  I did follow a few of the others reviews by sauteing the onions, mushrooms and adding 2 cloves of garlic. Thanks for
the great taste.

Yum!!!!!!!!!!! Even my picky boys liked it! I was cooking with my newborn in a sling, so I unintentionally didn't quite follow it, but it still turned out great.  Next time will add extra mushrooms & onions and will see if still good with a cheaper "swiss" type cheese.

I don't think gruyere is meant to top something.  It's great on a sandwich in between bread but on chicken it turns rubbery really quick.  I hated it but my husband seemed to love it.  Thanks though.)

This is an absolutely delicious dish!!!!  Only thing I did slightly different was to increase wine to 3/4 cup and dissolved a chicken bullion in about 1/3 cup of hot water and added it to the mushrooms and onions just because I wanted mine to have more sauce.

I went against the French and used olive oil to brown chicken; worked fine and saved some calories.  I also added a bit of minced garlic.  Ate plain (not over rice or noodles).  It was GREAT!

This was a good recipe but I agree with others that is is a tad bland.  I made few changes, only added extra fresh garlic to the pan and cooked this recipe totally stovetop. I have to give it only three stars because there are so many other chicken recipes on this site that are much better. The Gruyere cheese is so expensive also.

I made this dish over the holidays.  I tripled the recipe to feed a crowd.  The only change I made was to add a dash of garlic powder to the flour mixture before browning the chicken.  I used Cavit Pinot Grigio as my white wine. This received rave reviews from my guests!  Will definitely make this again.  A winner.

I really enjoyed the rich flavor of this dish - the sauce was amazing!  Because some reviewers had said the chicken was bland, I marinated my chicken breasts in OVV, garlic, and white wine.  I also dipped it in egg prior to the flour and browned it in OVV,instead of butter,and added more crushed garlic as I think there is no such thing as too much garlic.  I made a rue with the extra seasoned flour after the mushrooms and onions were soft to which I added wine to make a decent amount of sauce. I just eyeballed the amount, but 1/2 cup of wine was not enough - in fact, I only cooked 2 large chicken breasts and used the amounts of stuff it had called for 4.  I used Jarlsberg as I was out of Gruyere.  I served it over white rice - and the sauce over the rice - fabulous!! I'm sorry I don't have any left for lunch today!!!!!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We love gruyere cheese so this was a real treat for us.  The chicken was very moist and the flavors blended nicely together.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  Will definitely make again.

Oh my goodness, so delicious! I subbed what I had at hand and made a few changes. I used Swiss cheese (magnificent) and I used sherry instead of white whine, which I recommend 100%. I didn't have enough onion so I added some shallots and some garlic. I cut the chicken up into pieces and breaded them with bread crumbs and seasonings. Don't use Italian seasonings in this one - oregano really detracts. But the dill is really nice. I want to make this over and over and over again, with more sauce next time and over pasta. My boyfriend got really excited at the thought of having it again.

One of my new favorites! The only thing i did differently was dip the chicken in an egg wash before dredging in flour  like a reviewer suggested.  The Gruyere was about 7 bucks for just 8 ounces but was totally worth it. Thank you awsome recipe!

This smelled terrible while it cooked, but tasted better than it smelled.  I used Chukar (partridge) instead of chicken, but other than that I followed the recipe.  It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't gross.  It's also very rich, so people don't eat much of it.  I suggest pairing it with a side dish that's light.  Probably won't make this again.

Absolutely wonderful. Did not change a thing and my family loved it. Served it with rice and asparagus baked in the oven separately. I can't wait for the leftovers!

I am very pleased with this recipe.  I read the other suggestions and dredged in egg yolk prior to the flour mixture and I added 2 tsp of garlic to the mushroom and onion sautee.  It is very rich and this was my initiation to gruyere cheese.  It was good but, I will also try this with asiago and swiss to compare.  Dinner party worthy!

This is a great company entree dish.  Everyone always loves it whenever I've made it.  It is rich.  We haven't found it bland like some other reviewers have mentioned.  I've substituted both Emmanthal and Swiss cheese for the Gruyere and had good success.

Made this for dinner last night.  I also dredged the chicken in egg before flour.  The only other change I made (addition) was to saute baby spinach with a little garlic and use as a bed for the chicken.  I also did not have gruyere but a bag of shredded Italian 6 Cheese Mix was creamy and wonderful.  My husband said "Good Stuff" at least three times during the meal.  It's a keeper.  Thanks!

This was fabulous! The only thing I changed was that I used a 2-quart baking dish instead of a 1-quart--I do not see how it could all fit in a 1-quart, and the 2-quart worked great. Oh, I also added a bit of rosemary. Easy and delicious, and the leftovers were even better!

I thought this was a particularly tasty chicken dish....loved the onions and mushroom add-ins for the moisture they contribute  My only adjustment would be to sprinkle [very, very lightly] the chicken breasts with salt prior to dredging and leave the salt out of the flour dredging.  I served to this to my family and all added a little bit salt.  Otherwise, it is an easy/quick prep and very pretty presentation.

Made this exactly as the recipe stated except I added just a tad more cheese since my husband wouldn't stop eating it as the chicken was baking. Figured a little more on top would satisfy his new-found love for gruyere cheese. This was the first time I made it, and it certainly will not be the last! Whipped up a side of baked veggies to go with it. Absolutely delicious!

Excellent dish!! I lived in France for some time and always crave authentic cooking. This recipe, with its white wine and Gruyere cheese was very close to the real thing. My advice is do NOT substitute the cheese, add a little extra wine, and a little garlic. Bon appetit :)

My family loved this one....I did use baby bella mushrooms  as my mushroom of choice. The only thing I did different was to use chicken broth instead of the wine....so it would be more kid friendly. Very moist and juicy, my girls loved it! Thanks!

I didn't have boneless, skinless chicken, but love the ingredients in this dish.  To overcome the "bland" reviews, I inserted slivered garlic into the meat.  Then I splashed lemon juice and white wine and left it to marinade for 1 hour.    Dried dill has little flavor so I sprinkled more dill on the meat, along with some salt for infusing the flavor.  Then I dredged the chicken in the floured mixture, doubling the dill.  When I sauteed the mushrooms and onions, I added a bit of fresh garlic and started the mushrooms first, adding the (white) onion for the last part of the sauteing.  Chicken breasts come in all sizes.  Figure boneless, skinless chicken breast to be rather small.  Large chicken breasts (with bone and *some* skin) will take longer.  We are in the age of instant thermometers now.  Use them.  Honestly the chicken was so delicious that we skipped the cheese this time and also skipped the starch.  It was delightful.  Thanks.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I had to change it based on the ingredients I had on hand. I pounded the chicken breast flat per personal preference. I used fresh basil instead of parsley, i only had a little bit of fresh mushrooms so I used some dehydrated wild mushrooms, including dehyrated morrels that I rehydrated. I only had about 1/4 cup of red cooking wine and didn't want to open a bottle of white so I used the red wine and some chicken broth from my daughters left over chicken soup to deglaze the pan. I think I could have used chicken broth instead of wine altogether if i had to. I didn't have Gruyere cheese but I had shredded swiss and a block of romano that I grated. The combination of the two was wonderful. I had a bunch of liquid on the bottom of the pan that tasted delicious, I spooned it over the cheese to get the added flavors.

This dish was amazingly delicious! It tasted a lot like chicken marsala. The only recommendation I have is to add more gruyere!

My picky husband and I loved this. I followed the recipe as is. If you can find Gruyere cheese in your market it's worth the splurge. It melts so beautifully and really complements this dish.

This was great!  I used a good swiss cheese instead of gruyere, and also used fat free cream of chicken soup mixed with water for the sauce.  I also used egg instead of milk, and dredged through italian bread crumbs.  My husband loved it!  This will be one of my regulars.

I just made this for dinner tonight and I couldn't wait to finish cleaning the kitchen so I could get on the computer and rate the recipe! If I could give it 10 stars I would! This was love at first taste for the whole family! I guess it became our favorite recipe on the site after our first bite! The only thing I changed was I added some fresh minced garlic to the onions and mushrooms! I served it with a side of ziti and steamed broccoli. Yummy Thank you for such a winning recipe!

Gave this one 4 stars because it was very tasty, but still needed a little extra something.  I added thyme to the coating and garlic to the veggie sautee; served with lemon broccoli on the side.  An easy and savory recipe!

I made this with fake chicken from Morningstar farms and it worked out quite well.  The sheer amount of cheese was very greasy, but very French.

I did not bake this in the oven, but left it stovetop the entire time. It was incredibly moist and extremely flavorful. My family loved it.

This recipe is a good basic recipe and I found all the reviewers 'tweeks' interesting.  I used a good dealcoholized white wine instead of regular.  Pay a bit more if you substitute decalcoholized win; don't buy 'cooking' wine - it's super salty.  There are a few German brands that are good subs.  I cut back on the cheese used.  Thanks for the recipe and the guidelines.

One of our favorites!! The only change I make, is I caramelize the onions on the side, and then put on top of chicken as about to serve.  I've made without the mushrooms and wine, if I forgot or didn't have on hand, and it still turns out good.  Obviously adding those in give a different depth of flavor.  This is pretty easy to make, I HIGHLY recommend!!

Nice comfort food. I made a few changes based on some other cooks' comments. I sauteed the onions with a bit of salt and sugar to near-caramelized state (with a dash of Worcestershire sauce) before adding the mushrooms. Divided the fresh herbs so that I had some parsley and dill to sprinkle on as a garnish. Added onion powder, garlic powder and paprika to flour mixture.

Delicious!  I used thin sliced chicken breasts.  I did not have any gruyere cheese in the house, so I did not use it this time.  But I love it, so next time I will use it for sure. Let's face it, sauteed onions & mushrooms are wonderful on there own. This is really good comfort food. I will make definitely this recipe again.

This is a good recipe. More of a method though. I didn't flour the chicken breasts, just olive oil, salt, and pepper. Sauteed them until browned on both sides and partially cooked through. I sauteed a whole contained of sliced mushrooms in another pan with white wine and garlic. I covered the chicken breasts in the mushroom mixture. Put this in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes. Put some sun dried tomatoes on top and cover with a few slices of swiss cheese. Return to the oven for about 5 minutes. Enjoy!!!

Pretty easy and tasty.  It's your typical baked chicken dish, but with a little extra seasoning here and there, I'm sure you could liven it up.

I used chicken tenders instead of breasts so the cooking time was slightly shorter, and I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used dried - it was fine.  Also, I used Baby Bella mushrooms instead of white because typically I like them better.  This recipe was delicious, but VERY rich!  I don't think I ate a whole serving, but that's probably good considering it's not that healthy.  I won't make this often because of how fattening it is, plus the cost of Gruyere is insane ($20 a pound!) but when I do I will enjoy it immensely.

I thought this recipe was nice, looked and smelled wonderful and was easy to make. The chicken was tender and I thought it had good flavor. The next time I make this I might try it with asiago cheese as others have suggested due to the price on the Gruyere. Thanks

Very juicy, yummy chicken. I was worried because some people said that it would be bland or too dry. So these were the changes I made: 1) dipped the chicken in egg before putting into the flour 2) added basil, garlic powder, onion powder to flour in addition to the dill weed & salt, pepper 3) I just let the flour on the chicken get yellow on the frying pan instead of brown 4) I sauteed the onions first, then the mushrooms and then added the wine 5) I did not use the gruyere cheese (too expensive) so I put parmesan cheese and put slices of swiss cheese to put on each piece of chicken. My husband and I loved it.

My teenage daughter, husband and I all loved this recipe! Will definitely make it again. I agree with those who say the gruyere is imperative. It was easy...my only adjustment was to add garlic when I added the wine.  Surprisingly the wine was not overwhelming.

This was delicious! The gruyere melts beautifully, but its distinctive scent had my husband and son wondering what in the world it was! Hubs commmented that it tasted like something from a 5 star restaurant! I served it with Kashi pilaf that I cooked up with more mushrooms..it was delicious and very healthy!

Mushrooms and cheese - what more could a chicken want?  This was rich, satisfying and oh, so subtly flavored.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It was very easy to make.  The flavors were simple, so I will add more herbs next time and use better wine.  This is great for comfort food.

I love this dish. Have made it twice and it was a snap both times, yet tasted like I had slaved over the stove. I did not, and would not, change a thing.

Excellent dish. I made a few substitutions- I used portobello mushrooms, and fennel seed instead of dill because I did not have dill available. I also used the purdue ready-made roasted chicken strips, and swiss cheese instead of gruyere. It was delicious! Thanks!

A weeknight favourite for us. The gruyere cheese is imperative....don't try to substitute any other cheese, or it will be bland and lack the nutty flavor that makes this recipe so tasty.

This is delicious. My Mom made it for Christmas dinner a few years ago...everyone raved about it. Now all we have to do is mention gruyere cheese and everyone starts talking about Mom's chicken recipe!

Very easy and simple ingredients. Added garlic and onion powder to flour mixture. Also added minced garlic to pan with mushrooms and onion. Will make again.

I loved this! I cut the onion to a half onion since they are bigger now. I also used portabello mushrooms instead of regular mushrooms. Next time I would also add a couple of cloves of pressed garlic to the sauted mushrooms and onions. My family loved this!

This one's a keeper.  Didn't have Gruyere, used Swiss & tasted yummy.  My husband had nothing but great comments about  this dish.  It was the perfect dish to kick us outta the chicken rut we were in.  Tasty!!

This was the first recipe I tried on allrecipes.com and I love it!! The only change I made was to use a pesto gouda cheese on top. It's a hit with everyone I've made it for, in fact I'm making it tonight.

Very rich. I did take others suggestion & add a clove of garlic. I didn't use as much mushrooms or cheese as called for (I used portabella mushrooms). This isn't a dish you'd make frequently, but nice for a special night. Very easy!!!

I think you have to be a Gruyere cheese lover to really enjoy this dish. Though the chicken was extremely tender, the results were just to oily, heavy and rich. Some liked it, some didn't...

We really enjoyed this!  I used chicken breast tenders and it turned out wonderful. I served it with Lemon Broccoli and fresh garlic bread.  You definitely need to serve it with something that will soak up the juices such as bread, pasta or rice. Fantastic. Thank you!

This recipe was fantastic.  I made a few changes:  used 1/2 garlic butter and 1/2 margarine instead of all butter, added essence and garlic to the flour mixture.  The chicken was so tender and it went great with rice.  I have never cooked with this type of cheese before and was a little sceptical at first due to the smell but was I wrong, this cheese is perfect for the recipe.  This is a definte keeper.  Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! Thank you. I added fresh garlic to the mushrooms and added wine much earlier to infuse in the flavor of onions/mushrooms. I served with roasted mini new potatoes and will definitely be asked to make this again.

Thanks for a great recipe. Made this last night and the chicken was moist and the sauce very flavorful. I browned the chicken in equal amounts butter and EVOO and then proceeded with the recipe. Everyone loved it, and I am looking forward to the leftovers. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was very good, it also turned out excellent.  However, I used more flour and I dipped the chicken in an egg yoke first.

"Outstanding" - I used turkey tenderloins instead of the chicken, but the outcome was still the same - FANTASTIC. I even took some to the guys at work the next day, micro-waved it and they are still talking about it.

This was easy and very tasty. After browning on the stove,  I recommend only leaving in the oven for 10 minutes  then adding the cheese and placing under the broiler until melted. Chicken was cooked through and juicy, not tough.

We loved this so, so much. Don't skip serving it over rice or pasta or even just having some crusty bread on the side. You do NOT want to miss a drop of that sauce. Stunning!

This was simple and tasty. The white wine and type of cheese made the meal.

Was really rich...   Did not use. Dill as not a fan, but otherwise followed exactly.  Very oniony.  Everyone ate it without complaint.  Looked really gourmet when finished.

This was super good!  I pounded the chicken breasts a little to get them uniform in thickness.  I quartered the mushrooms but I think next time I will slice them.  I only used 6 oz of Gruyere and it was plenty.  This is a do again recipe for sure.

I loved the flavors of this, but my chicken turned out tough.  I'm not sure how to avoid that with the cooking on stove and then finishing in oven method. Other than that, it was delicious!

I made a few minor modifications and this dish was super tasty and easy to make. I doubled the parsley in the flour dredge mixture and added 2 smashed and chopped garlic cloves when sautéing the mushroom and onions. I also reserved some of the flour mix and added it and a little more butter before pouring in the wine. Finally, I used about half a cup of heavy cream to give the sauce more texture. I figured with all the butter and cheese I may as well go all the way with the fat content! Served over vermicelli with steamed petite peas on the side. A lovely dinner that me and my husband devoured. I'll make this again for sure, next time probably for family and friends.

I was so disappointed with this dish. I made and served it for guests and I was not only unhappy myself but embarrassed my guests had to eat it. I took several reviewer's suggestions and added onion and garlic powder to the flour for dredging-chicken was horribly bland. The sauce was runny and flavorless even though I used pressed fresh garlic to add flavor. Sorry but this recipe does not get my vote. Even the triple amount of cheese could not liven up this dish. :(

Made this last night, and it was fantastic. However I changed the recipe somewhat.  I used shallots instead of onion.  I also baked the chicken for 10 minutes initially, and only 5 more minutes after adding the cheese.  Turned out well. Got the thumbs up from the Mrs and I'd definitely make it again.

The pictures looks delicious. I didn't know Gruyere cheese was so expensive. I added basil and lemon juice. My husband love the dish and asked me to make it for Thanksgiving.

This is a fantastic recipe! So much different than all the other chicken stuff I make. Family loved it unanimously! I cook a lot, and it's hard to find a one pan dish that everyone likes! The onions and mushrooms stay nice and big, so they can be avoided if someone doesn't like them.. It reminded me of french onion soup....

Take the time to call around and find real gruyere cheese, it is so worth it!  This is a new family fave.  It is quite rich though, beware.  I deglazed with a splash of white wine for an extra kick of flavor.  Thanks for sharing!
