Made this for the Recipe Swap! Very good sauce. I did double the jalapeno and I ended up needing more salt, so added my favorite seasoning blend(garlic/onion/salt/black pepper), but it sure is easy and great to have for folks to have a place to start. It would also be great with a bit of chipotles added! Thanks Mis7up! :)

Not spicy or hot as all.  Tastes like slightly flavoured tomato sauce.  I added a lot more onion and garlic as well as a bit of vinegar and used 6 Jalepeno's and 2 Habanero's to spice it up a bit.  In the end I just felt like i was making a pasta sauce.

This rates a 5 for ease of prep and a 4 for flavor.  Personally, I think that it needs more salt. I used fresh Romas which gave a good thick sauce.

This is a very good and easy recipe. Basically the real deal, but using whole canned tomatoes. If you want all fresh, just substitute the can for real tomatoes. If you want green salsa, substitute canned tomatoes with tomatillos. If you want more heat, leave the seed and veins of both Jalapenos or add your favorite hot pepper. If you want less heat use one seeded and deveined Jalapeno. Do you want a smoky/roasted flavor, coat the tomatoes, onions, garlic cloves, and Jalapeno with oil and roast in the oven or stove top or grill, then peel the charred skins and use as directed in the recipe. Do you feel italian? Substitute the cumin for basil, and substitute the Jalapenos for 1/2 tsp Crushed Red Pepper, process so its very chunky; add olive oil, blk pepper, and balsamic vinegar, and you have a Quick Bruschetta. This is a great base for many recipes.

Really nice sauce.  I swapped in four habeneros for the jalepenos because that is all I had.  It turned out great.  What a  nice flavor.

Your dad's recipe is great! My advice for the "not hot enough for me" people is to write your own or simply add more pepper. Don't  say it sucks just because you can't cook.

Loved this indeed! I added some habanero. Roasting the jalapeño first is key to this being a unique sauce. It’s addictive, be careful. I used it to make salsa chicken and found out that warmed, this salsa is even better. Thank you for the recipe.

I have been making this salsa for years. The only change I make is to add cilantro and lime juice for an authentic Mexican salsa. I also add more salt. I vary the amount of onion and peppers depending on how hot I want it. One trick is to use canned jalapenos and put in some of the juice from the can. It adds more pepper flavor.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  It feels more like a salsa/pico de gallo.  It was a bit too watery to use as a taco topping, but is great dip for tortilla chips.  Can't be how quickly this comes together either.  Will make again.  Thanks Cliff!

I used 2 or 3 Serrano peppers and enjoy their kick more than jalapeños.  The key is to add 1/2 tablespoon or so of white sugar.  It cuts the acidity of the canned tomatoes perfectly & really improves the salsa.

This was a great starting point.  I doubled the recipe.  I removed all the seeds and membrane from the peppers, (and set them aside in case it needed more heat after I tasted it)which I was so glad because it was HOT.  The heat is determined by the jalapeño peppers that you use.  If the peppers look woody they are hotter.  One of my peppers looked woody.  I also doubled the spices and the salt and added cilantro.  My familia agreed that this was perfect!

The hotness of the sauce depends on the peppers. Make sure you go to where you have experienced their peppers so it will be closer to the hotness you desire. I would add more onion and I mean the small white hot kind along with a touch of apple cider vinegar. We should note there is no sugar!!! Thus the 4 stars!

Not hot enough for us.....had to add more garlic, more peppers, less cumin and lots of cilantro.......also adding a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice or vinegar sets the heat and its hotter tasting.

This is how I make my salsa and I love it. The people who said it tastes like pasta sauce I am guessing they are using stewed tomatoes- I use diced tomatoes or even the whole ones. Just make sure they are not STEWED! Otherwise it will taste like pasta sauce. I even use a can of Rotel sometimes which depending on the type is already spicy.
