Due to personal preference I swapped the measurements around for the mint and cilantro. A little bit of mint goes a long ways with us. With that being said, this was great! If you love mint then I say put it all in. I do feel as written it would need more cilantro. Then again, some people feel the same way about cilantro as I do about mint. I served this with chips to go with fajitas but it would be great as a spread for a sandwich or wrap. This one is a keeper!
