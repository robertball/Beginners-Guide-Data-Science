I think it was a really good soup. I thought that it was very flavorful and I enjoyed it. I think that I would make this again.

Never had this soup before, so I can't say how it measures up to its namesake, but I liked it.  If I did anything differently, I would mash fewer potatoes, leaving more cubes in the soup (personal preference) and thicken with a little cornstarch slurry, if necessary.  Muenster cheese is not bold (very mild), and the chicken broth adds needed flavor, so I'd recommend making this soup only with broth, not water.  Didn't have an avocado for a garnish, but will try that next time.
