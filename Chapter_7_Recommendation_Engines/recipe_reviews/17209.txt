Great cookie.  I'm very strict about using only real butter in all my baking, but I did give butter-flavored shortening a try and was pleasantly surprised. I followed recipe exactly (unsual for me) and it turned out terriffic. I baked mine for 9 min. for the perfect soft and chewy cookie.  Of all the cookie recipes I've tried, these taste almost identical to Mrs.Fields coming out of the oven.  It also keeps well the day after. TIP - keep the cookies on the cookie sheet for at least 10 min. if you want the cookies to stay moist and soft longer.  The natural steam that forms on the bottom penetrates the cookie keeping them moist. A bakery secret.

These ARE the best chocolate chip cookies ever! Since I don't care for milk chocolate, I substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips, and I used butter.  I also melted the butter before beating it with the sugars; this was a tip from an online "Chocolate Chip Cookie Hints" site.  This site also recommended tripling the vanilla.  I used 1 tablespoon of regular vanilla (couldn't find the Mexican variety). The cookies were slightly crispy on top and sides, but wonderfully rich and chewy and flavorful in the middle.  I just baked them today, and they're already almost gone!  Thanks, Nicole!

A Winner At Our House, according to my 86 year old Cookie Monster Husband. If anyone had a problem with these cookies being grey or too soft or too hard, then it was their problem not the recipe. My husband was shocked that I had got the recipe off the internet, as I am a excellent cook and usually invent my own recipes.

I probably did everything wrong as I have Arthritis Hands, so had a problem stirring, so I used my hands. I also shaped the dough into Balls, with my hands, guessing at the size. The cookies baked down to 36 - 3 ½ inch, not too thick and absolutely not too thin wonderful cookies. Baked them on my “REMA” Air Insulated ungreased Cookie Sheets 

Clicked on recipe to make 36 cookies instead of the 18 in the original. I did not chill the dough followed your recipe to the letter otherwise. Granddaughter and two Great Grandchildren coming to visit for two weeks. Will be busy so I wanted to get some goodies ready ahead of time. After they cooled I placed them into a box separated each layer with a sheet of parchment paper. Wrapped the whole box in Aluminum Foil, and placed into the freezer. Took one out the next day let it thaw our on a parchment paper. They were perfect, and I now will have 30 beautiful and delicious cookies ready for our family, husband gobbled up three before they hardly cooled, saved three for the next day, I pinched off a piece to taste test for quality as I do not eat sweets, these couldn't be better. Thanks, Dewey & Me

YUMMY. 
I did only use 1 egg...for a chewier "less-cake-like" cookie. 
And I bought some Mexican Vannila last time I was in Mexico...not very good at all (unless I just got a bad batch?)...don't waste your time buying it. 
I also used half butter, half shortening...and a little less sugar(s).

Good cookies but these aren't a family secret recipe.  They're exactly the recipe on the Nestle's tollhouse chocolate chip bag!

A great recipe! While I usually hate it when a reviewer remarks on the changes they made to the recipe, because I did not have milk chocolate I substituted semi-sweet. I also did not have mexican vanilla so I used 6 teaspoons regular vanilla(on another reviewer's suggestion). The recipe made closer to four dozen. Even with the changes I had to makeit was a wonderful recipe that left none for the next day! Thank you.

I adapted this recipe to lower the fat and am quite pleased with the results.  My changes are:  1/4 c. butter flavor shortening; 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce; 1 tsp. butter flavoring; 1 c. chocolate chips.  My cookies were soft and slightly cakey.  Had to bake for 20 min.  I estimate my version to have about 5g fat per cookie instead of 13g in the original recipe.  My husband liked these which surprised me because he's VERY picky about chocolate chip cookies.

These are very good but I prefer the Mrs. Fields recipe. It has 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1/2 a cup sugar and it gives it a golden quality and a chewy texture. Still very good!!!! Thanks

Ok, let's try this again. I don't understand why my review for this recipe keeps getting deleted. I have no idea how I could possibly be offending anyone with the truth. What I have to say should be helpful in regards to THIS particular recipe. To the reviewer who said, "This is the exact recipe on the back of the Toll House chocolate chip package", and the 80 people who somehow found that information "helpful": this is NOT, I repeat, NOT the same recipe. The package calls for butter or margarine. This recipe calls for butter-flavored Crisco. The "family secret" the submitter is talking about is the Crisco. My mom has always used the same "secret" in her chocolate chip cookies. It produces a thicker, softer cookie. Using butter produces a flatter, crispier cookie in this recipe. So, everyone that is using butter needs to go review the Toll House recipe (it's right here on AR), otherwise you are not reviewing this recipe and misleading everyone. I use THIS recipe. They taste great, stay soft for days, and present beautifully.

I did not have mexican vanilla but I did have a quality brand name pure vanilla extract that I used in it's place. I did not make any other changes. My cookies were done at nine minutes. I let the cookies cool for a couple minutes on the sheet before pulling them off with the spatula and letting them finish cooling on the kitchen counter. We're now almost through with the day and my husband and two kids have eaten almost half of this batch of cookies. I would say they liked them!

I, like several of the others, feel these were very good, but maybe not the "absolute best". However, I haven't yet met a cc cookie I wouldn't call friend. Also, since I used Ghiardelli chips, I notice the recipe is exactly the same on the bag as Nicole's, except that they use butter instead of butter flavored shortening. I will say, that I do like that these cookies stay chewy in the middle, & lightly crisp on the edges, which to me is exactly what you want. If you bake them for 8-10 mins. they're light in color, & more chewy----10-12 mins. gives you a more normal golden brown color with less chew. In general, it's a keeper recipe for me!

The flavor is good but I'm not a fan of cakey cookies. I like them done around the edges and chewey in the middle. My students made this recipe and all the results were the same regardless of the amount of time they spent in the oven. The search goies on for the perfect cookie.

I do a lot of baking. I am very fond of chocolate chip cookies, but these were not good. I followed the recipe exactly. The batter was nearly flavorless. The cookies were too greasy and tasted like fake butter, crisco and salt. TOO salty and greasy. The texture is too soft also. I like my cookies to be a bit chewy on the edges with a soft yummy center, and stay soft/chewy for a few days. Save your time and don't bother with this one. I have five kids and there are still cookies sitting on the counter. Enough said.

I am pretty sure this is the same recipe as the one on the back of the Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chips bag...But it is the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe I have  ever encountered. The key to these cookies is the amount of time you beat the eggs. I usually beat the mixture for 5 min after each egg addition but I have done it before for 10-15 min and the result was delicious!

Pretty darn good. However, this recipe made exacltly 4 dozen, and I used very rounded spoonfuls! They are delicious and keep for several days. I am not a huge chocolate chip cookie fan but I do have to eat a few of these every time I make them!

Yes, this is essentially the Tollhouse recipe, except for the 2 tsp. Mexican vanilla.  However, they turned out MUCH better than my Tollhouse cookies ever do.  I think it was because of the technique- instead of beating the flour mixture into the creamy mixture (as Tollhouse recipe directs), I followed the recipe and gently folded it in.  They were delicious!!!  Much fluffier than what I normally get and had a melt in your mouth quality.  I highly recommend following the directions as stated in this recipe.

The batter has zero taste to it.  I wasn't impressed with the end result at all.  To be honest, the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the back of the Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels package is way better than this one. I wouldn't make these cookies again.

As the title says these are ABSOLUTELY the BEST! Even the raw dough tastes great~ If you're looking for a cookie recipe to try this is the one to try and KEEP! 8 min cook time makes these cookies perfectly browned on the bottom and goldenish on top with a chewy centre once cooled. Comes out looking under cooked but once cooled they're perfection.

I have never been able to make chocolate chip cookies before, they always came out paper thin, but these are perfect.  I have to make them for my husband all the time.  When I took them to work they were all gone in 15 minutes, everyone loved them.  I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup regular crisco and regular vanilla. I use my hands to make balls before putting them on the cookie sheet that way they come out perfectly round. I also bake mine 7-8 minutes so they are not too crispy.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!

These are incredible. A Few notes: If you like CHEWY cookies with a nice crisp edge (divine) you MUST tupperware or zip-lock these cookies AS SOON AS THEY ARE COOL. Do not leave these out and do not use a cookie jar unless it is air-tight. You will have the soft chewy cookie you are looking for. Also, I scaled this to double and it still turned out great. They keep demanding more! Good luck and ENJOY!

I have been looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe using Butter Flavored Shortening for a long time.  I had the recipe when I was a kid, but lost it over the years.  They are as good as I remember!!  I accidentally overbaked one batch, but the insides were still soft and chewy! I didn't know what Mexican vanilla was, so I used vanilla flavoring, and they turned out great.  I used only the mixer bowl to make them by creaming the sugars with the shortening, then adding the eggs, then the vanilla, then the salt, and finally the baking soda.  I beat that on high until it was really fluffy.  Then I added the flour and chips.  I found that I needed to add anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup extra flour to make the dough less sticky.  The second time I made them, I left out 1/4 teaspooon salt (to be more healthy). They tasted just the same.  Instead of baking them all at once, I made cookie balls and placed 12 in each plastic baggy and froze them.  When I "need" some cookies I take out a frozen bag, preheat the oven, pop them on a cookie sheet, and bake. I have fresh cookies with in 20 minutes!! (I also gave them as gifts to the neighbors, still in their frozen baggies so they can enjoy the fresh baking aroma.)  They loved them!  Good luck!

I have my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipes, but today I wanted to try something different.  I prepared them as written with the exception of using half butter and half regular shortening (I tried the butter-flavored once, long ago and didn’t like it) I was both pleased and disappointed with this one.  Disappointed because I found these are the type I don’t care for – while they are tasty, with crisp edges,they're a little on the soft and thin side.  Pleased, because this is exactly how Hubs prefers them.  Score.

These were delicious! The only change I made was that I used regular shortening because thats all I had on hand. Mine baked a little longer than 10 minutes but sooo good!

These cookies are excellent!  They stayed soft and chewy for a few days after baking, and have quickly become my boyfriend's favorite!  I used mini M&Ms in half of the dough, and those cookies were delicious!

These cookies are"really" good, and buttered flavor shortening does make a difference rather than plain ..but i used plain as well and they were still awesome! NOTE:..take them out right befor they turn brown! let them set and theyre absolutly the perfest cookie!!!

I don't know why these are "the best". It is the Nestle Tollhouse recipe using butter flavored shortening instead of all butter. The water in the shortening makes them soft and not crispy. I prefer butter.

I made these for my boyfriend and decided to give a dozen to him and the other dozen to my parents. My dad was a HUGE fan of these. Every time I go to my parents' house now, he requests them. He has one of the biggest sweet tooths I've ever seen and I once made the mistake of putting semi-sweet chocolate chips in. They were still very good, but he prefers the milk-chocolate. I also always use regular vanilla extract, butter and just 1 egg. Cooking time is also always a little more for me, 10-11 minutes. For those of you who are saying the cookies turn out flat, try refrigerating the dough for 30-60 minutes before cooking. If the dough is thin/sticky they will turn out flat.

I was not that impressed by this recipe.  I was expecting something wonderful from all the reviews but was disapointed to find out they were just regular chocolate chip cookies.  They tasted fine and my husband ate them up, but he does that with any cookie.  I think I prefer the Betty Crocker or Nestle Tollhouse recipes to this one.

Great cookie! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Note about Mexican Vanilla:  There are two types, real and synthetic.  Real, genuine, pure Mexican Vanilla is AMAZING but not cheap (unless you happen to be in Mexico and can pick some up). The synthetic usually comes in huge bottles and is dirt cheap.  The flavor is not good, in my opinion. AND some synthetic vanillas have coumarin in them, which has been banned by the FDA.  The real stuff has a high alcohol content and is amber in color.  The synthetic stuff is black in color, almost opaque, and doesn't have the high alcohol content.

Cakes belong in cake pans, not in cookie form. That said, my husband loves them, I do not. I followed the recipie exactly, only used regular vanilla instead of Mexican. I hate cakey cookies and thats what these are. If your looking for a cakey cookie then this is definitely the recipie for you!!!

After first pan came out and were so bad in every way (appearance, taste, texture, etc.) I put all rolled cookie batter back into bowl and tried some variations, with not enough improvement to continue baking them. One star becuase 0 stars isn't possible.

I have made these cookies many times. We love them!! To help with "spreading" and the shortening taste others mentioned, I use 1/2 butter flavor shortening and 1/2 margarine or butter. I also add twice as many chocolate chips. A mixture of milk, semi-sweet and white are favs with my family. "Spreading" can occur when the cookie sheet is not completely cold. I alternate two sheets-- one baking while the other is cooling. I have even been known to pop the "cooling" one in the freezer when it is just barely warm. I got this hint from Maida Heatter-- a real cookie maven. It stopped all my "spreading".

It was "ok". I also think they were a little cakey and not the traditional crispy outside, chewy inside that I get with my favorite recipe. They also didn't have that traditional chocolate-chip cookie flavor because of the milk chocolate chips. I stuck to the recipe exactly and half of the cookies were left uneaten which NEVER happens with my cookies. Still...if you like "milk chocolate" chips, this is a good recipe to try.

Very good recipe, overall.  Perhaps a touch sweet for my liking, and the amount of chocolate chips was a bit too high. The cooking time of 10 minutes seemed best to me.  Next time I'll probably use 1/3 less chocolate chips and a touch less sugar, and it should be perfect!

These were just as the title described them - ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!  They didn't last long at my house and everyone that tried them either had to have the recipe or begged me to make more.  I didn't have Mexican Vanilla so I used Pure Vanilla Extract(about 1/2 tbsp).  I would suggest to the people who didn't like them the first time around to follow the recipe step by step and try them again, they deserve another chance.  Unless you only like crunchy choc. chips - nothing bland about this cookie recipe!  THANK YOU Nicole for sharing it with us. :-)

This recipe is EXACTLY the same as the Toll House cookie recipe with the exception of an extra teaspoon of vanilla. Why pass it off as a secret family recipe?? That's a joke.

This is acutally about the same recipe I've always used for my cookies. I've tried mexican vanilla, but still prefer regular. I use a little more brown sugar and a little less white sugar. But my tip is that I don't spoon the cookies out, I roll them into balls first-they tend to be fluffier this way. I also have found that air-bake cookie sheets make a big differance in keeping them soft and moist. Take them out when the edges start to turn light brown, let them sit on the pan a few mins outside of the oven, they will darken a little more as they sit. Love them!

Amazing!!  These are so soft and perfect.  Some say to refrigerate the cookie dough so it's easier to handle but after making these about a dozen times, I would say not to refrigerate the dough, it spreads so much better and gets this crispiness on the edges when it's put on the baking sheet right after the choco-chips have been folded in.  And the center stays soft and wonderfully yummy!  375F for exactly 11 minutes-  PERFECTION!

Pretty darn good - crisp edges and chewy centers. To avoid flat cookies, stick the dough in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before baking them!

Over the last 2 years, my kids and I worked our way through several books of great cookie recipes. We made 192 recipes to be exact. Wish I had just started here. These have a great buttery taste. FIVE stars from this family of experts.

Very good.  Interesting twist using milk choc chips.  They would be real good using semi-sweet too.  I substituted a cup (tub) of soft Fleishman's and they turned out soft.  Used 375 instead of 350. -Suzie

Cookies come out delicious. The only reason you might get a  hard bunch is due to the extended baking time. Try only leaving it in the oven for 8 minutes or 8 1/2 mins.  If you want to preserve the cookies later on, you can opt to freeze them in a plastic freezer bag or store them in a plastic container/ziplock  bag.  I find that mine stay fresh for days..and the frozen ones last for a month!


I also used regular vanilla.

I was searching for a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe when I came upon this web site. I do a lot of baking, especially anything with chocolate in it. After reading many of the reviews both bad and good, decided to try this 
(I was fortunate to have a friend that let me borrow her mexican vanilla). Like several reviewers stated, they were good still warm out of the oven but not that great next day. I even had 4 friends rate them and they all gave it a 3. I agree, believe the Tollhouse cookie recipe is better. Two things that may help, I always use parchment paper when I bake cookies and the cookie scoop is a wonderful time saver, I use the 1 teas. scoop (perfect size) that can be ordered out of most baking cataloges.

Thank you for the recipe Nicole.  I am newley married, and this week I started on a kick to find the very best chocolate chip cookie recipe.  So far these are the best that I have made, and they got really good reviews from my husband and his family.  He said he wanted a cookie that tasted like a Hungry Bear cookie.  (A yummy local cookie store) And these are definently the closest so far.  (Or at least my version of them)  I used what I had, which was regular vanilla 1+ Tbs, semi sweet chips, and 1/2 butter 1/2 regular crisco.)  They had just a slight crispyness on the outer edges, and a delicious chewy center.  They did spread out a bit, but they were not flat.  I am only not giving them a 5, because that would end my "quest".  And it is kind of fun to have a challenge - to find the very best.  If I do not find any that are better I will write back and give them a 5!  Thanks again

Absolutely the BEST choc chip cookie I have ever made or tasted. I was worried, I didn't have butter flavored Crisco, so I mixed 1/2c real butter and 1/2c Crisco. They turned out wonderful and didn't last 2 days! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were great cookies.  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used regular shortening and added some butter flavored extract I also used 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips as well as the milk chocolate.  Got 20 cookies using my large Pampered Chef scooper.

Fantastic!  The recipe says it makes 24 but I made it exactly as is (twice) and made 40 - 43 both times.  They are gooey and chewy and they stay that way  -- they don't harden!  A quick zap in the microwave they're hot and gooey again :-)  VERY GOOD!

I watch for the "chip" sale every yr. and bag a bag or 2 of all of them... semi cho. milk cho., peanut butter, butterscotch, mini M&M's etc... Then I dump them all in a 2 gal. freezer bag and keep them in the freezer... Do the same thing with nuts.... Then whenever I bake, I pull my bags out and grab a handful or 2 and put in my dough....Save money, and always have them on hand to bake whatever I want....

That sound you hear is the clatter of my teeth falling out after I ate half a cookie. I followed the recipe exactly but I reduced the sugars to 1/2 cup each and only 1.5 cups milk chocolate chips (I prefer semi-sweet, but didn't have any on hand). But these still came out WAY TOO SWEET! The texture is nice (it's a soft cookie, not a chewy one) but I would reduce the sugars and use semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk if I were to make these again.

Awesome cookies! I may try adjusting the ratio of brown to white sugar to include a bit more brown sugar. I used real butter instead of the shortening. I also followed the advice about melting the butter before mixing it with the sugar. I don't know when I will make these again, considering the fact that my husband ate 10 in one day! I think I will just have to ration them next time...

AH! This was so good! I did substitute butter for the shortening and used the pure vanilla extract I already had. Also, for chocolate chips I used 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 cup mini semi-sweet. The mini ones make sure that you get chocolate in every bite, and I love the slight contrast in flavors between semi and milk. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

These are great! I used regular shortening b/c it's all I had, and I mixed half milk chocolate chips and half white chips. I might try them with butter flavored shortening eventually, but see no reason to buy it only to use with this recipe.

My cookies came out horrible! I really wanted this to work too. I love cookies, but these came out flat and I even added more flour! Perhaps if you changed the baking soda to baking powder that's the only thing I think would make a difference.

After trying several great cookie recipes, I tried this one over the weekend.  I didn't use the mexican vanilla, but it made no difference, these cookies are AWESOME!!!  1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar is all i added for the "cracked" cookie look.  My kids like the palm size cookies and these delivered!  Used an ice cream scoop for dropping.  THANKS for the recipe!!!!

this is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe by far. I took the advice of one of the reviews and melted the butter, i also put 1c sugar, 1c brown sugar and used 2 tablespoons of regular vanilla extract, added 3/4c chopped pecans, and used semi sweet chocolate chips. I baked them  for 11 min and the cookies turned out crisp on the out sides and moist and chewy on the inside and soooo delicious. i will from now own use this recipe. i had used another recipe and thought it was good but this recipe is the all out best chocolate chip recipe i have ever tried.

Try adding a 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract to the liquids and a tablespoon of Hershey's cocoa to the dry ingredients, for chips add Giardelli's bitter sweet chips (60% cocoa)
  YOU'LL NEVER GO BACK :-)

These are without a doubt the best chocolate chip cookies ever.  I have made them dozens of times and they are always a hit.  People always ask me for the recipe or ask me to make them.  I live in New Zealand and we don't have Chrisco so I just use normal butter and they work just fine.  Sometimes I put white chocolate chips or m&ms in too.  Love this recipe.

Really, really yummy!  Just the right balance between sweet and salty.  I've tried this recipe before and finally made two adjustments that made it just perfect to my taste: I used less chips (1 to 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet choc chips); and added an extra 1/4 cup flour.  Before when I made it the dough seemed to cook/melt too thin.  Adding a little extra flour seemed to help. Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used butter.  They turned out just the way I LOVE them, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  YUMMY!  Mine didn't turn out like the picture but they were just the way I like them!  Great cookies.

I did find these to be the ABSOLUTE best! I do have to say i used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of crisco (1 cup all together) I think they are best if you make them right away. I found them to be slightly better then than refrigerating and then cooking. The batter was like a blanket over the chips, kind of flat, crispy, and chewey in the middle. I used m&ms cause I had a lot. I also used the base of the cookie recipe and added white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and pecans (without semisweet chocolate) They were delicious too. This is the recipe I will be using from here on out.

First, I rarely give a 5 star as that is for "Praise God for this food!" food.  That said, this is about a 4 1/2 star cookie.  Took about double the prep time but worth it.  Enjoy!

For not getting hard and crispy after cooling i'd give this 5 stars but, it just didn't taste like what i want my cookies to taste like. If you don't like your sweets too rich than you will like this but, for those of us who have serious sweet toothes than it my not be what your looking for. The amount of chips in it was perfect but, the batter just didn't really have much flavor to it and I want to be able to taste my whole cookie not just one part of it.

Well, of course they are good...THE "SECRET FAMILY RECIPE" IS THE TOLL HOUSE RECIPE ON THE CHIP BAG!!! Just use real butter, regular vanilla and there you go...Even if you are from the Toll House Family, this is no secret recipe :)

Good , but not the absolute best.  Warning - make
sure not to overcook - they become really crunchy and they are meant to be soft.  The first batch I left in longer than recommended because they were not browned on the bottom only to learn that they will never brown on the bottom no matter how long you leave them in, they will only get crunchier.

These cookies turned out suprisingly delicious. I substituted butter for butter-flavoered shortening and it worked fine. Instead of 24 cookies, I ended up with over 30 smaller ones. My advice for this recipe is to bake them for closer to 8 minutes than to 10 minutes because they brown quickly and will taste horrible if overdone.

Great Recipe!! Definitely the absolute best  chocolate chip cookie recipe around!!  I actually found this recipe here over a year or so ago and have adopted it as my own "secret" recipe.  Everyone always asks me to bring cookies to pitch-ins.  The only change that I made to the recipe is that I used regular vailla (not Mexican) and semisweet chocolate chips (just because that's what we prefer).

These cookies were the best cookies EVER!! I am eleven years old and I love to bake. These were very easy to make and my entire family plus my cousin and family friends loved the cookies. They were very delicious and it was fun to add extra's to the batter.

I made these cookies for the grand opening of our cafe and everyone commented how delicious they were.  I did use melted butter and baked a little longer than 8-10 minutes.  I also added extra vanilla and peanut butter chips.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much!

I'm sure my husband would give these cookies a 5 star rating, but I would not. They were way too crispy for my liking, not very chewy at all. Plus, next time I make them I will use butter instead of shortening. Maybe it's just me, but I think they lack that good butter taste. Thanks for the recipe, though!

A classic recipe for success. A note on Mexican vanilla. Rated as the best vanilla extract the world has to offer, it really does make a difference if you can find some. It is more aromatic and flavorful than american vanilla, so if you have to substitute american vanilla, you may wish to add a little more than is called for in the recipe. Once you have tried Mexican vanilla in your baking, you will never turn back, and it is definitely worth the trip to go there and get it yourself if need be!

These are excellent cookies! I use half butter flavored shortening and half margarine.  I also use half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half milk chocolate chips.  My family loves these.  The best thing about these is that they stay moist and chewy the second and third day (they've never lasted longer than that!).

Used real butter and regular vanilla extract. They turned out delicious! Everyone ate them up in two days the first time I made them. The only thing wrong was that they were awfully flat. Pretty easy too, coming from a 17 year old.

I did not have any Butter Flavored Shortening, so I used 1/2 cup of Regular Shortening and 1/2 cup of Butter.  Also I did not have Mexican Vanilla Extract, so I used Regular Vanilla Extract.  When the cookies were still warm they tasted Ok.  But the next day they tasted Awesome. I can't wait to make them again.  They disappeared real quick.

If this is a secret family recipe, then Nestle stole it.  This recipe appears on the back of the semi-sweet morsel bag.  The only difference is that recipe calls for real butter instead of crisco and the oven temp is 375 instead of 350.  I've been making these cookies all my life, and they are great.  But I don't think they are a secret family recipe.

Really do not care for the butter-flavored Crisco taste. Greasy, processed, ick. May try again with just butter, because I do like the taste of the Mexican vanilla.

This is the recipe on the back of a choc chips bag, just subbing butter shortening for butter.  Needless to say, these were great.  I actually made my own butter flavored shortening by combining 1 c of shortening to 1 tsp of butter flavoring.  They did have a great texture, and to my disbelief, didn't taste like a big bite of shortening. My brother says these are best left almost raw (about the 8 min mark).

Easy to bake. I was hanging with my daughter while she cooked this. I suggested substituting 1/2 of the choc chips with white choc melts (chopped) and was accused by my health-conscious brother of doubling the chocolate! Made the cookies feel like triple or at least double chocolate... mmm!

These are very good cookies! I used butter (melted, as per the suggestion of another reviewer) and semi-sweet chips as that was what I had on hand, but did everything else by the recipe. Except that when I jotted the recipe down to take to the kitchen, I didn't write down the oven temp. I ended up baking them at 375 for 10 minutes and they came out great - a bit crispy on the bottom, soft in the middle. I think my favourite chocolate chip cookie recipe is still the Best Big Fat Chewy Chocolate Chip cookies recipe on this site as I like my cookies a bit chewier, but this is a great recipe too and I would make again!

I made these with my niece tonight. She helped beat the creamed mixture and stir in the chocolate chips. We enjoyed them with our mochas. The recipe is perfect, as is. Slightly crispy, not overly sweet. I used sea salt instead of iodized.

I've been working on making the best of the best chocolate chip cookies, and so far these are the best I've tried!  I think the key is the shortening.  I think the butter makes the cookies too soft, the shortening give the cookies a better crisp texture.

Perfect chocolate chip!  Crisp edges, chewy center.  Can be crispier if you cook them longer and they are still delicious.  I used less chocolate chips however, so the dough would spead out more and the cookies would be flatter.  Leave the amount of chips in if you like a thick chocolately cookie.  I did 1/2 the amount of chips and it was still good.  Used a cookie scoop, baked for 10 minutes - perfect!

I was curious to find out how chocolate chip cookies made with all shortening came out, so I decided to try this recipe. I also have Mexican vanilla that a friend brought back for me from a cruise. While I really like the texture of these cookies, they are soft and chewy and crisp on the edges, I was disappointed with the flavor. Too much imitation butter flavor that completely overpowered the vanilla. Maybe replacing part of the butter flavored shortening with plain shortening would help. Anyways, I think I'll stick with recipes that call for part real butter, part plain shortening.

Used butter instead of shortening.  These were great.  Don't leave them sitting on the pan for more than a minute after you take them out of the oven or they get TOO crispy.

These are excellent!  I had serious doubts about using the butter flavored shortening instead of butter, but I stuck to the recipe completely, other than using regular vanilla instead of Mexican vanilla.  I'm super glad I didn't change it.  Yum yum yum!

I'm made these cookies many times and they are fantastic. A few changes I have made: - I used regular vanilla extract but put in 3-4 teaspoons for a stronger vanilla taste - When I don't have shortening, I've used butter and margarine - both came out very good as well - I also followed MommyFromSeattle's tip about leaving the cookies on the baking sheet for 10+ minutes. The cookies were soft and moist for days.  Amazing recipes. Easy to play around with ingredients (when experimenting or short on ingredients) without adversely affecting taste. A major plus!

wonderful cookies.  I  was unsatisfied with the tollhouse recipe as my cookies always turned out flat and without a rich flavor.  This will be my new chocolate chip cookie recipe for years to come!

Fabulous. I used half unsalted butter and half regular shortening because this is what was in my fridge/cupboard. Next time I will use the recipe as is. I always have trouble with correct timing because I never follow a recipe. My bet is it will be that much better if I follow exactly. My 3 year old and 4 year old helped too.

These are okay but taste like they're really bad for you, like they have a lot of preservatives and are made in a huge factory - not my own kitchen! The cookie dough was completely inedible because of the shortening, and in the baked cookies you can still taste the shortening. Maybe with butter next time they'd taste better. I will admit that they are really soft and baked perfectly though.

baked these for school last week, they were great, and youre a plagiarist  changes: mix in only 1/2 of the chocolate chips then top the cookies with the rest. and personally, butter is better than shortening. i also add a bit more chocolate chips =) remember though that you can only fit so many chips on top so mix in a bit more than half if you use more but yeah.. the only difference between this and the one on the chocolate chip package is shortening for butter and mexican vanilla for vanilla. uses most of the same wording too

I've searched and tried tons of chocolate chip cookie recipes. I made some alterations and they were perfect! Crispy outside, chewy center. Used butter rather than shortening and melted it before adding it. Make sure it's completely cooled before adding it to the mixture. Delicious!

This recipe was the worst cookie recipe I have ever made before. I've made cookies from scratch before and they have never came out like this. While the cookies were cooking in the oven they mushed all up into one big cookie, overflowing over the pan. I hope people never use this recipe ever again. If you do you're just wasting your time.

I have tried a few chocolate cookie recipes on this site, this one has just the flavour I was looking for. Yum! I used smarties in place of the chocolate chips. This cookies are wonderful, they taste even better the next day and they freeze wonderfully.

I am sorry to say I cannot agree with the rest of the highly rated reviews.  This cookie has a "different" texture than expected.  There is a slightly "off" taste to the cookie as well.  Not a totally bad cookie, but not one to keep in my recipe box, and definately does not live up to its name.

FINALLY!!! I waited 4 days to review this recipe, and the cookies taste good AND stay chewy for days. (At least 4!!) I have been searching for "the" chocolate chip cookie recipe, and I believe I have found it. Changed it to suit what I had on hand; used real butter and vanilla extract.

These were pretty good. I was kind of disapointed when I looked at the recipe on the bag and noticed that the only difference was an extra 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp extra vanilla...I was expecting something more than what I can get off the chocolate chip bag.

Good but my dough was too runny so I had to add 1/4 cup flour. After that, it was perfect. Also I found that these cookies taste better and stay chewier when they are undercooked.

I'm not sure what "Makes" this recipe, but I think it might be the extra vanilla. I've been baking with butter flavor crisco for years and have yet to make a cookie like this! Delightfully chewy and not too puffy or too flat. I sift a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon into my flour mixture for a little extra *something*

Fantastic!  I will be making these again and again.  I did use half butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. I also used bitter sweet choc. chips. (dark choc)  I added about 3/4 cup of finely chopped pecans.  These came out beautiful. Not flat.

Whoa Girl!  Those are perfect.  Beating each egg into the dough at least 2 minutes made all the difference.  Also, I used 2 hearty tsp of vanilla bean paste and a tad more sugar for a slightly crispier on the outside version.  Wow!  Thank you!

The name for these cookies fits.  I've been using this recipe for over a year and everyone loves it!  I always double the batch and then put a ziplock bag of dough (flatened to about 1" thick) in the freezer.  When I have a craving or someone pops in, I just break off chunks and bake them without thawing.  They're terriffic with chopped walnuts.

THIS RECIPE IS SO EASY TO MAKE AND A LOVELY CREAMY TEXTURE.  I USED BUTTER AND NORMAL VANILLA ESSENCE, DROP THEM BY THE TEASPOON ONTO THE BAKING SHEET. I CHILLED THE MIXTURE A BIT, AND USED MY JUDGEMENT WHEN BRINGING THEM OUT OF THE OVEN. MY KIDS WERE EATING THEM AS I WAS TAKING THEM OUT OF THE OVEN, THEY LOVE THEM. WILL KEEP THIS ONE!!

My mom loved them. I just ate one and enjoyed it intensely. I use spoon-sized amounts and they spread out a LOT -- needed to use 2 cookie sheets.  At 350F I had to bake them for about 18 minutes. 

Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar -- I ate one and I'm getting a really bad headache, and I used less than the recipe called for to begin with!

Mine didn't exactly turn out like the photo, but that's most likely due to my pathetic ability to make cookies... Recipe was easy to follow and I had all the ingredients in my pantry and didn't have to make a trip to the store! Apart from the black bits though, they tasted quite nice!

Everyone in my family thinks I'm a good baker because of this recipe, and no one knows how easy it is!  :) Thanks, Nicole!  The milk chocolate chips really make a difference from the standard semi-sweet.  The first time I made these, I did everything exactly as the recipe says, except I couldn't find milk chocolate chips, so I bought the half milk chocolate/half peanut butter chip mix by Nestle.  Really really good, if you're a fan of peanut butter!  I typically bake these for 8 minutes rather than 10 because they are just a little undercooked and really soft and taste amazing.

I have tried many many recipes for chocolate chip cookies and this is one of the best.  The cookies were even better when I substituted butter for the shortening and added 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Soft in the center, crunchy on the outside.

this cookies are great!, But only add about a teaspoon and a half of bakingsoda; the original 2 teaspoons causes the cookies to rise way too much. If you don't take my word for it and add the originall 2 teaspoons, make sure to smush your cookies down on the cookie sheat before you bake them. Other than that, Scrumshish!

Yummy! I found that depending on the type of pan I used, they baked a bit differently. So you might want to watch them when they are getting close to being done and choose when you think they are ready instead of totally relying on the timer. Also, I used just plain butter and vanilla extract instead of the shortening and Mexico stuff and they were still great!

I have looked long and hard to find a cookie like my grandma used to make, and now I found it!
And once I figured out that mexican vanilla was just "real" vanilla I was even better off!  I highly recommend this cookie!  I add walnuts and it is even better!  (If that is possible!)

This is our family's chocolate chip cookie recipe and we love it! Tose who don't want a crispy cookie just need to remove thme from the oven when they look slightly under done.  I only cook them 6-8 minutes and they remain soft and chewy.

These are great!  I have been looking for a really good chocolate chip cookie recipie for years.  My old one was good but was a bit too sweet.  I live in New Zealand and we don't have Crisco so I just used butter.  I also just used plain vanilla essense.  Everyone loves them.  I made them for 4 teenage boys - and they ate the whole batch in an hour!  Thank you

I just baked these for the guys in the manufacturing plant where I work.  They were fabulous! You really need the Mexican vanilla...regular just does not compare..a warning though....the recipe yields far more than one would imagine...though that is not necessarily a bad thing!  An excellent cookie!

I agree- this is an A-one cookie recipe.  I used butter instead of the butter flavoured shortening and I also used my child's uneaten solid chocalate Eater bunny(chopped up) as my chips.. they were fabulous cookies and I gave them to all my neighbours as "thank- yous" for being such great people.  Yum!!

My son loves "Soft Batch" cookies, but I am a traditionalist, MUST BAKE REAL COOKIES.  He is in the Air Force and is headed to ----.  I am hoping that these are going to be a hit with the guys.  They are faintly crisp on the outside and moist and tender/chewey inside.  Don't bake longer than the instructions.  BEST CC cookie!

I am not a very good cook, so I followed this recipie to a "t". My only problem was I didn't think they looked cooked and continued to cook them for 7 more minutes, when I should have pulled them out to continue cooking as they cooled. They turned out harder than I anticipated, but still were delicious. If I would have prepared them correctly, I would probably give the recipie a higher rating. Still, all the cookies got eaten, and my neighbors went on and on about how great they were!

These were just as they are named "Absolutely
the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies".  I did add
about a cup of chopped pecans because our
family loves chocolate chip/pecan cookies.
I gave some of these to my friends and
neighbors for Christmas and they are all
asking for the recipe.

These are awesome!  The crisco helps to make the cookies soft, yet crunchy on the outside.  I added white chocolate chips for a change and they are soooo good.  Thanks!!

These are basically the same as  most chocolate chip cookies--only using crisco.  I prefer margarine or butter to crisco, so was not at all impressed with these.

Ususally, I will not review, if I made changes, but this time, I cannot resist, because these turned out to be the best cookies I have ever made.  I took another reviewer's tips, and melted a cup of butter, instead of using shortening, plus I changed the sugar to one cup brown, one half cup white.  So, I wound up with a way-too-runny batter!  I ended up using a total of 3 and 1/2 cups flour, and that made it the right consistency.  To.  Die.  For.  Got forty cookies out of it, and I will be using this recipe, with my own changes, from now on!

I followed the recipe exactly and I was sadly disappointed by the "flatness" of them. They expanded a LOT and came out much like pancakes.

These tasted great!! One "key" though, is to place the dough in the fridge before baking... otherwise the cookies melted, or flattened in the oven.

This is an amazing cookie. I used a tbls of regular vanilla extract, but I didn't have enough milk chocolate chips so I used semi-sweet, white, AND milk chocolate. Wow! That is all I can say. I'll definitely be making these again.

Wonderful cookies!  I didn't have any butter-flavored shortening, so I used 1 cup of unsalted butter, but followed the rest of the recipe as written and they still turned out fantastic.  Everyone loved them! Will definitely use the shortening next time.

I have been making these cookies for 8 years now and will use no other recipe. These are a family and friend favorite. I do make a slight variation by adding only 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chunks. I just use regular vanilla.

I have used this cookie recipe for YEARS now, and wherever I take them I am always asked for my "secret recipe!"  I don't like butter flavored shortening, so I use 1 cup of real butter. I find the cookies turn out a bit chewier when I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. I also use regular vanilla- don't use the imitation vanilla! It just leaves these cookies flat. I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp. and use semi-sweet chips (or a 50/50 mix of milk and semi-sweet) to balance the sweetness of the cookie. I've made this recipe "my way", and the original recipe, and they are what they claim to be, either way. Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookies!!! Thank you, Nicole!!

Love these cookies.  Made them a few times and they've come out great.  I don't know if it's my oven or an issue with the recipe, but I have consistently had to cook them longer than recommended.  Either way, they're fantasitc.  As my husband says..."Nom Nom Nom"

These are perfect! Use the shortening, it makes the cookies chewy. My son asked why these cookies were so awesome. I told him I used shortening, and since I didn't have the butter-flavored kind, I added a cap of butter flavoring.

Crank up the heat to 375F convection if you have that feature, add 1/2 tbsp cream of tartar for the "cookie crackle" effect. Cool the dough approx 8mins prior to baking & keep cool in between time. It makes a huge difference in the appearance,texture, and the way the sugars caramelize. baking is all about exact measuring and cooling...Although I did have to do a dash of real vanilla from the bean ;)

For this recipe I did the following changes. 3/4 cups butter, 2 cups flour, and 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder instead of soda.  These alterations yeilds a lighter coloured cookie, that is much thicker and does not spread too thinly.

The flavor was good on these, but the appearance was just not impressive.  I would not claim them as my own if I took them to a gathering.  They flattened out and just look completely homemade.

i use to use my mother's recipe for chocolate chip cookies but once i found this recipe i had to rethink it. even my mother agrees that the cookies come out better than hers. i have to admit i've never used the mexican vanilla, i've never found it. they are the best cookies just the same. i also use self rising flour and cut out the baking soda and salt, it cuts down on the number of ingredients and the recipe come out exactly the same. my husband and kids barely let the cookies cool before the're gone.

I don't care where this recipe came from, my family loves these cookies. I use regular vanilla and was short on chocolate chips I had a bag of m&m's in the cupboard so I combined the two. They loved them, i have made them two weeks in a row now. My husband and kids, keep asking when I will make them again. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These are hands-down the best chocolate chip cookies ever.  The only change i made was out of necessity, I used cake flour because i was out of all-purpose flour & it makes them even better.  I always use cake flour now!!

I've tried quite a few chocolate chip cookie recipes and this is by far the best. Everyone raved about them. I also didn't have any mexican vanilla extract so I used the regular kind and they were delicious, next time I'll try recipe as is. Thanks so much for sharing!

These cookies are FANTASTIC.  I'll never use the recipe on the back of the Toll House bag again.  I've taken them to several parties and will be baking them for a bake sale tomorrow.  Best of all, they freeze well...if they even last that long in your house!

Ashley- your wrong! the recipe has a few differences from the toll house recipe. the vanilla is different in amount and kind, the shortning and the chocolate chips are different, and they make a HUGE difference! For fun my 3 daughters and I made both recipies exactly, the toll house and this one today. This recipe is so much better you would never know that it only has 3 things different, it is a great cook who can see the couple things that need changing to make the recipe supurbe instead of just ok. This is the best chocolate chip recipe ever! Every one who has tasted them from me LOVED THEM!!!

Wow! I had to use non-hydrog. margarine because that is all I had and they still turned out supper delicous, soft and chewy.  I baked them on parchment instead of greasing pan and at my son's request we used half peanut butter & half milk chocolate chips....yummy!!!!!

My friends could not stop talking about these cookies after I made them for a party. The only adjustments I made to the recipe were I added a little more flour and I decreased the sugar a bit. Also, I added one cup of walnuts to a second batch. The cookies do not flatten out like other chocolate chip cookie recipes.

Sorry - but this is the recipe that is on the back of the Nestle Chocolate Chip bag - the only difference is they use butter, and you used butter flavored crisco - a really tasty way is to add a stick of butter, and 1/2 stick of butter flavored crisco - the cookies won't go flat on the cookie sheet

Excellent!  I just used plain Crisco (not butter-flavored) - tasted fine.  Crunchy on the outside - chewy in the middle.  Perfect.

This is a good basic recipe, very similar to the Toll House except for the Mexican vanilla and the shortening.  I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening.  I also used semi-sweet chips and added in walnuts.  My family enjoyed them very much.

I have been using almost the same recipe for years and I am not kidding these are the best chocolate chip cookies ever!! The only difference I make is: I use real butter, regular vanilla extract, and dark chocolate chips. I always use my mixer to make sure all of the ingredients are mixed together properly. Also I only cook mine 7-8 minutes. Any longer than that they turn out over cooked and to hard.

This recipe works a lot better when you whip the cream mixture with an electric mixer.  I tried it once by hand and couldn't understand why this recipe was "absolutely the best" but when I used my mixer, they turned out really tasty.

This was one of the greatest recipes ever!!!! I have tried many recipes before and they were ok but, this was very good. My only problem wa they were a bit too salty for me but otherwise they are great. Also, instead of milk chocolate chips i used semi-sweet or dark chocolate chunks.

Was far too 'eggy', my flat mate deemed it more of a cake texture than biscuit.
Probably wouldn't make again.

Everyone that tried these cookies told me they were great. I'm not a big chocolate fan, but my husband begged me to make him chocolate chip cookies. To be honest I was intimidated to make them since I had never made Chocolate chip cookies before, and my Mother-in-Law is the best baker, so I made the right choice in coming to all recipes and reading the reviews. Since I'm not a chocoholic I added 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips and they turned out wonderful. I made them on an electric oven and I had to leave them in there for 5 extra minutes and also be careful spooning them onto baking sheet, I made the spoonfuls too big and my cookies came out square because they flattened out and squished against each other, but it didn't affect the flavor at all, my square cookies were wonderful! This recipe is definetely a keeper!!!

Wow. I wasn't inspecting much, and I just threw the ingredients together in a bowl and slapped them on a cookie sheet. THEY ARE DIVINE!! I used margarine instead of shortening, and they turned out perfectly. Very moist and chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges. They taste like Subway cookies, only better!!

These were good but not great. The first batch came out to mushy and spred way too much. The first thing you need to tell people is are you scooping out the flour or dipping in thus makeing it more compact? After that what I did to fix it is instead of adding more flour I added cocoa powder to make theme cho. choc. chip. These came out fantastick. So If you want to keep them plain dip into the flour bag if not then scoop and add 3/4c. cocoa to the flour mixture. I also upped the vanilla by a bit for more flavor.

Edit..... I've made these about 20 times since and have them down pat. First off, add another tbsp. of flour. Second,  add 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring if not using butter flavored shortening.  Third, add another 1/2 tsp. Vanilla and up the brown sugar (dark) to 1 cup and white sugar decreased to 1/2 cup then they are perfect.  Allow the dough to rest overnight in the refrigerator if possible to get the best flavor.

My quest for THE chocolate chip cookie I will use & pass to my kids and friends is OVER. Nicole..these are TRUE to their name. I added 1/2 tsp almond extract & 1/2 c crushed walnuts...just to give it an additional "edge"--Perfection in a cookie! If you follow directions you will not be disappointed! Not the cookie for those that like crunchy cookies//I salute you Nicole!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! My family expects my usual Choco Chip cookies for Christmas, but I wanted to try something different. I didn't have 'mexican' vanilla, so I added 2.5 t., instead for more richness of flavor. (Probably didn't matter, at all!) But... these are a definite 5. I agree with the other post.. . any problems with color, etc., were by the baker not the recipe!

i made these for a baby shower. It wasn't really what i would call "absolutely the best". Then again, it seems my standards may be too high because everyone raved about them and they were the only dessert touched at the party. Perhaps its just me. :)

So simple and so simply delicious!!  I didn't have Mexican Vanilla, so I used regular vanilla and I did not grease my cookie sheet.  Might add nuts next time, but this recipe is truly going to be a favorite!

These really are absolutely the best!  I have made several varieties of chocolate chip cookies and when my husband had one of these last night he said they were the best ones I have ever made.  I used half a bag of chocolate chips and half a bag of chocolate chunks, both semisweet.  Also just plain old vanilla extract.

This is the recipe I use the most for chocolate chips. I sub butter for shortening, it is my preference. Also, I prefer semi-sweet chips. If you like a thicker cookie that doesn't spread too much, chill the batter for a couple of hours.

Ok, they were good. They had a nice texture though, I found them to be little on the dry side. Really the batter didn't have the flavor that butter gives. However, they, like every other cookie that finds itself in my house, were gone by the next evening. Thanks for sharing.

These cookies are fantastic!  I'm a big fan of using Crisco in cookies.  I didn't have any mexican vanilla on hand but regular vanilla came out just as well!  Definitely a keeper!

I wish I could have found the mexican vanilla extract in our stores, but no luck...so I had to use the regular real vanilla extract. Still these were absolutly the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made and believe me when I tell you, I can cook my heart out and everything is wonderful, but when it comes to baking I can't even make the "slice and bake" cookies you find in your grocers refrigerator section..LOL..These came out perfect! so much so that I am making them again today. I wouldn't change a thing!! Thank you so much for the recipe and hopefully one day I can find that mexican vanilla extract and give them a try that way.

WOW This is a great recipe. I substituted move over butter in place of the butter shotening and mixed the choc chips with milk choc and semi sweet chips and also made a variation of peanut butter cookies with this recipe. Absolutely mouth watering. Blue ribbon recipe. This is definetly a jewel in the treasure chest of cookie recipes. Thanks!

These cookies are so awesome!!  The name fits!  I only gave them 3 stars because I did have to make changes to make them 'absolutely the best' for me.  You might love them as is - here's my version:

I used to make these with just the shortening and they were great. I then switched to half butter, half shortening.  Not much different.  THEN, I omitted the shortening altogether and now make them with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil (to get rid of the unhealthy shortening and replace it with a healthy, natural fat).  
The butter/coconut oil version is truly the BEST version of these cookies.  I will never go back to using nasty shortening - the taste is inferior and is a very unhealthy, manufactured fat.

I also use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk, to cut the sugar.  The cookies are very sweet as is, and adding milk chocolate chips is just too much.  The semi-sweet chips give a bit of balance to this cookie.

Well, the recipe isn't bad, but I found it remarkably similar to the recipe on the back of Tollhouse chocolate chips.  The only difference is the mexican vanilla instead of regular vanilla and butter flavored shortening in place of the real thing.

The many 5-star reviews prompted me to try this recipe, but we could not stand how the cookies turned out. Very greasy (from the shortening) and not very much flavor at all. I followed the recipe exactly. Won't use this recipe again.

I was skeptical that these were the BEST chocolate chip cookies ever, but they ARE! They aren't cakey at all, and not too thin. It's easy to make soft or crispier ones for people who have preferences. They also aren't as sweet as some other recipes, which is a big plus. Thanks so much for this GREAT recipe!

Wow!  You were right -- my husbands couldn't get enough of these tasty treats!  Even my 17-year-old son, who hates food, LOVED these cookies, and you were right -- after one, he was on the floor begging and crying profusely!  THANK YOU, Nicole Faust Hunt, for bringing my family back together.

Outstanding cookies!  My husband claimed these the best choc. chip cookies he has ever had and he can be picky.  Took them to a family BBQ and everyone raved.  I didn't have the mexican vanilla, used 2 tbsp of Watkin's triple strength vanilla instead.  The shortening flavor took me a little to get used to, a bit greasier than butter to me.  But I loved them, yum!

These are truly the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had.  I've done all sorts of variations - white chocolate, w/ or w/out nuts, butterscotch - all have been amazing.  They are very soft and stay that way for days.  I usually double the recipe without any problems.  The texture and flavor is really amazing.

I use this recipe every time I make chocolate chip cookies now.  I add thjings sometimes and they always turn out great, not soft and not crunchy, but definately chewy and delicious.  I also use regular vanilla instead of mexican, just can't seem to find that here.

I've never made cookies that are so easy, the butter flavored shortening adds texture and flavor. GREAT RECIPE!

To all of the whiners, and idiots that can't bake, I've been making these cookies for my kids for over a year. I'm a stay at home Dad, and seven kids can't all be wrong. I've never had a batch come out bad, and my kids have loved them everytime they were put out.

Okay I'm not one to follow recipes to the exact, bit this one I did and I must say my family is amazed with these cookies! I've made them for 2weeks straight now. LOL. I love cooking but baking hasn't been on my side these days. I'll try a cookie recipe and they come out too hard or way too small and taste like flour still. But this recipe is amazing. I would recommend this recipe to any and everyone as long as you follow it exact as is... I cheated and added alittle more chocolate chips But hey its okay to indulge sometimes. Lol thanks for this recipe from my family and I.!

I've made this recipe every year at Christmas for the past few years and it always gets rave reviews!  The only changes I make is I use half milk chocolate chips and half semi-sweet, and I use half vanilla extract (I've even used imitation extract and it was fine) and half almond extract, since I like the subtle nutty flavor.  Overall, a great recipe, though!

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. They are even better a day or two after you make them! I prefer mine with milk chocolate chips. I make these several times a year - and I bake dozens of them around the holidays.

I use this recipe when I want to make large M&M bakery-style cookies.  I double the recipe, add a large bag of M&M's instead of chips and double the amount I drop onto the parchment-covered cookie sheets.  They bake beautifully and look just like the ones you'd find at the bakery!

Only giving you 4 stars for the use of butter flavored shortening.  Was not aware that something so silly even existed.  

I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup REAL butter, and 1 cup coconut oil.  I would have to say this is the only recipe that makes it into my bookmarks for chocolate chip cookies.

Flat, dry and not sweet enough.
This recipe is off- Needs 1/4 C more Sugar, 1/4 C more Flour. Instead of just 1/2 tsp BSoda: 1 1/2 tsp Baking POWDER+ 1/2 tsp Baking Soda. Also add more Vanilla , 1 TBSP WATER = 1 TBPS OIL.
Baking POWDER is needed in cookie recipes.
Also 1 TBSP water is common in traditional cookie recipes.
Good luck.

FANTASTIC RECIPE.  It's a must to use Mexican vanilla.  When I use that vanilla people tend to ask me what is in this that gives it a special flavor. My version:   I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter shortening.  I use 1/2 milk choc chips and 1/2 semi-sweet and add a bag of Heath bits.

Wonderful cookies!! Everyone loves them! I'm "afraid" that i will have to cook way more tomorrow lol! I got the first 12 out of the oven 15 minutes ago and they're all gone!
I did followed members suggestion. Using butter, melting butter before adding the sugar and brown sugar, then let them on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes before taking them out in the cookie jar. 
Do i need to say that this recipe is a keeper?!

I did like how these cookies came out very soft, and there was tons of dough.  However with both salt and baking soda they were soo salty.  Next time I am going to cut the salt in half and maybe use baking powder? I made mine quite large and left them in for 10 - 12 minutes Either way solid base recipe, but needs  a few tweaks to bring out its true potential.

Very much like the Hershey Chocolate Chip recipe, slight variations.  Turned out very good.  I tried leaving them on the tray for 10 min as suggested by another reviewer, however they stuck badly to the sheet (greased).  The next sheet I only left for a few minutes so they would set and they came off fine so I would not recommend trying that, or use parchment paper. I substituted real butter as I did not have shortening on hand and shortening is a trans fat, very bad for you. Also make sure your Mexican Vanilla says 'does not contain coumarian' - I bought mine in Mexico and there are some that do not say this. Very important! Oh and I baked mine for 12-14 minutes.  At 8 they would have been runny!

I searched and searched for the chocolate chip cookie that had butter flavored shortening as an ingredient because I have made them before and loved them, but couldn't find my recipe.   This is NOT the same recipe as on the Tollhouse bag.  It's definitely better!   Softer on the inside and just enough texture on the outside.   Delicious!

These cookies are amazing! The recipe says it will yield 24 cookies, but I managed to get 42 out of it with small to medium scoops. The cookies have the perfect cross of crispy edges and melt-in-your-mouth middle!

I used butter instead of shortening and a mix of white choc chips and butterscotch chips instead of milk choc - these came out perfect!

Fantastic!!! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and I only had imitation vanilla extract. It was still Fabulous. I can only imagine how great it would have been with real Mexican Vanilla extract and milk chocolate chips. Excellent!

I've never reviewed/rated a recipe before, but this one is by far the best cookie recipe I've found and tried! For small cookies bake at 9 minutes, mine were slightly bigger so I baked for 10 and they came out perfect. These are bakery quality!! I've never made such pretty (AND deeeelish) cookies!

I found this cookie to be rather bland, lacking the usual rich chocolate chip cookie flavor.  The dough has an awful aftertaste because of the shortening.  I think I'll stick to my usual recipe.

Yeah I'd say that these are pretty good cookies. Except for using Butter flavored Shortening. (why would you use shortening in this recipe?) and the Mexican Vanilla instead of regular vanilla. This is the exact same recipe as Nestle Toll House. So I give this a zero rating (even though I had posted 1) since they are only slightly altered from an already Famous Cookie Recipe. If I could give a zero I would.

I have used this for chocolate chips, white chocolate (vanilla) chips and peanut butter chips and it is a no-fail good cookie.  I gave it four stars because it isn't amazing, but it is good.

Excellent cookies! I use what I have and make the necessary adjustments like 3/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup of shortening instead of the butter shortening, vanilla or imitation works, and semi sweet chips. I'm sure if I had the ingredients in this recipe these cookies would be even better! Either way, my family loves them and they dont last long at my house either! Thanks Nicole!

Soft and yummy - a perfect chocolate chip cookie. Modifications for our family: only 1 cup sugar. Add 1/4 cup applesauce for moisture. 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flour for an extra rich and nutty flavor.

These weren't THE BEST but i still gave them five stars because i love any chocolate chip cookie. If you really want THE BEST try The Best Chocolate Chip Cookie from this site. I did make some changes, i used all whole wheat flour,  only butter instead of shortening also, i added an extra half stick of  butter because whole wheat flour tends to be dryer than white. They came out great! thanks for the recipe!

While this is a delicious chocolate chip cookie, it is not a secret family recipe... it is from the original Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book.  I grew up eating these cookies as well.  For those of you who like to use butter instead of shortening try using half butter half shortening.

Just made these today and they are delicious!  I made a few changes based on what I had in my pantry.  Used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup regular shortening.  I also threw in m&ms and 1/2 chopped pecans because I didn't have enough chocolate chips.  Like other reviewers I used regular vanilla.  Cooked for 8 minutes and let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few more.   Thanks for sharing!

The name says it all. Everyone loved these cookies. I'd say they're the best chocholate chip cookies I've ever baked, hands down. They're moist and sweet and delicious. The directions are clear and the ingredients are simple which is what I like. I didn't use Mexican vanilla extract because I didn't have any, but clearly it didn't hinder the results. These honestly are amazing!!

These were hands down the BEST chocolate chip cookies i've ever made from scratch! I substituted the shortening for 1 cup of margarine, melted and I found that the batter had spread a lot when i'd put the first batch in the oven, so I used a really tiny teaspoon for the second batch and spread the cookies far apart. Will definitely make this again!

This is very similar to the Tollhouse Cookie Recipe but uses butter flavored shortening instead of butter.  I always find that my cookies bake better and don't spread out when I refrigerate my batter.  I also only use 1 egg so they aren't so cake-like.  As for Mexican vanilla, it's difficult to find here, pure vanilla has always worked for me!

Really good. I doubled the recipe, but only put 3 cups of chips in and still had lots in each cookie. I also used 1/4 c of butter, and 3/4 cup hortneing, instead of just butter flavoured shortening. I got many compliments on the cookies and requests for the recipe.

YUM! I cannot eat dairy, so i used semi sweet non-dairy chips and margarine and it worked great! i used 1 tbsp less margarine, and melted it before addint it to the sugars. this recipe works great in a blondie too, if you don't have time to make individual cookies :)

These are delicious! I didn't have butter flavored shortening so used regular and they still turned out great. This recipe makes a lot (more than we could finish ourselves) so I brought the rest in to work the next day.  I set them out in the lunch room and they were gone by 10 am!

6 Stars if I could. The name says it all. I have searched far and wide for the best chocolate chip cookie and I feel honored to have come across this recipe. I am not being dramatic because that is how WONDERFUL these cookies are. Life changing. They will forever be in my family recipe book. THANK YOU NicoleFaustHunt. They have the perfect consistency, perfect taste, and are easy to make/clean up. The only thing missing is a tall glass of milk to go alongside them. MMMM MMMMM!!! I may have a new obsession..

WOW! I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I hate crunchy cookies, so I thought I would give this one a try. BEST chocolate chip cookie I have ever had! they are chewy,soft and mouth watering. I will definitely make these again...and again! (the one thing I changed with the shortening, I used margarine )

I think I may have died and gone to heaven. The PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER! These are equivalent to the amazing cookies you can get at any good cafe.  There are the perfect mixture of chewy, gooey and crispy. Anyone who has 'issues' with this recipe, obviously needs to review their kitchen skills.   Easy to make, and far to easy to eat ( or inhale!)  Thank you SO much for sharing. Now I FINALLY have my prefect recipe that I have been searching for.

Just made these tonight. I used regular vanilla extract and regular veg shortening for this and it still came out very yummy. I baked about half of the dough and put up the rest for later. The edges are crisp while leaving the inside chewy. Very good flavor and will be great with a glass of milk.

My husband didn't like how they were more "cakey" (but, he still ate like 4 in one sitting!).  I like the dough better than my "normal" recipe, but I like my "normal" recipe's (which is the one off the butter crisco) cooked cookies than this one.

Okay.. so DELICIOUS chocolate chip cookies!! I didn't have Mexican vanilla extract so I just used a little bit more of regular vanilla extract. I also used regular unsalted sweet cream butter and they tasted delicious.  They seem to be turning way too brown on the bottoms and sides however.. doesn't do anything to the taste.. they still are delicious! But.. I am wondering if this is because I used real butter and not shortening??

This is absolutely NOT the best recipe for Choco-chip cookies! I was better off taking all the ingredients and just dumping them down the drain. I read the good reviews, and then I read the bad reviews; I decided to try the recipe anyway. I used butter instead of shortening because I didn't have shortening on hand, other than that I followed the recipe perfectly. The first batch (2 dozen, which was about half the batter) looked more like choco-chip pancakes...they were flatter than flat and I only left them in for 8 min at 325 (my oven heats up higher than it should so I always lower the temp by 25 degrees). I decided to add 1/3 cup of flour to the rest of the batter, and although the second batch came out better (fluffier/thicker) they still lacked flavor. Overly sweet but that's it..no other flavor other than "sweet". Maybe I royally messed up somewhere along the line, although I doubt it, but these cookies are still sitting on the cookie plate, and I made them 3 days ago! Cookies rarely last a day at my house. Save yourself the aggravation and the wasted $ and find a different recipe. I'd give it a 0 but allrecipes' rating system doesn't go that low

Pretty good recipe. Small footnotes: the mexican vanilla is not essential, and for me, being a professional chef, I substitute a different shortening, and add butter extract...the shortening I choose to utilize is called Bake Rite...it is an animal fat based shortening, and it is available @ wal-mart.  the difference in amazing.  and to the reviewer who complained that they turn out flat...if you look at the picture....it shows nothing that would lead me to believe otherwise...they are supposed to be a flatter cookie...good recipe Nicole...Kudos

These really are the best chocolate chip cookies! They are delicious, also they are very good with milk or coffee. I did everything exactly as the recipe said except for I didn't have mexican vanilla extract so I used vanilla extract substitute and I didn't have milk chocolate chips so I used semi sweet chocolate chips.

Wow! I have been baking for four years, and NEVER once did a chocolate chip cookie recipe ever come out the way I expected. I made these, substituted the Mexican vanilla for regular vanilla, and I used butter instead of the butter flavored shortening. I have tasted better, but I still LOVE the way these baked. I give the appearance a 9, the taste a 7, the bake time a 9 (they were brilliant in 8 minutes!) Thanks again!

I have been making these for years, everyone loves them, they are also very tastey as a cookie bar, if you put them into a casserole dish and bake for 20-25 minutes.

I made the cookie yesterday and I found that it was really good! One thing I would like to say is cookies became soft quickly... I have made cookies for several times and I think that using high quality of flour is important.

The best cookies ever, we absolutely loved them! The funny thing was that I had no butter only margarine so I thought for sure they might not turn out. They turned out great but I will use butter next time for more flavor. Over all very yummy and moist, will make again for sure!

I'm not sure what I did wrong because I followed recipe but my cookies came out flat (like thin crepes would come out) and looked nothing like the picture. The flavor is ok, no different from other recipes that I have tried.

These cookies were extremely bland with NO flavor. The only change I made was using semi-sweet in place of the milk choc. Bummer because I wasted ingredients. Even my little 10 year old nephew said the were 'horrible'.

TERRIBLE. Made these twice to make sure it wasn't me.  The cookies are way, way too sweet.  Those reviews are correct.  Two c. of chips is way too much.  Half that will be fine if you feel you must make this recipe.  Too many chips make the cookie very melty-like and they fall apart, and not in a good way.  They required 2-3 minutes of cook time more than the recipe called for.  I would never make these again.  Yes, it's pretty much a rip off of the tollhouse recipe.  I only made this recipe because I couldn't find my one from Joy of Baking on their site. This recipe here, well, it's Friday morning and the only cookies left in the tin are the ones from this recipe.  Sad, even my teens didn't like them.

These turned out great! I made sure not to cook them to long, only until slightly golden. This made for chewy cookie and semi melted chocolate. I couldn't stop eating them!

The only difference between these and Tollhouse is the shortening and vanilla. Otherwise identical. I combined the two recipes, and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening. I also used semi-sweet chips, and 1 tsp mexican vanilla with 1 tsp really good vanilla. I baked them for exactly 9 minutes and let them cool on the pan like a previous reviewer suggested. I used 1 tbsp flax seed mixed with three tbsp water to replace one egg, and used egg beaters to replace the second egg (didn't have any real eggs) Not only did that make them healthier, but you'd NEVER know. The texture was slightly crispy on the outside and ooey gooey chewy on the inside.

They came out absolutely perfect that way and look picture perfect, too.

I think they are wonderful although you do not need two cups of chocolate chips. I use one cup and a half a cup of oatmeal. I make them at least once a week now.

I have been searching for a solution to my flat, thin, spread-out chocolate chip cookies. I finally realized that using butter flavored shortening would do the trick! I did 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter, and the cookies actually held their shape!! awesome recipe- i used kosher salt, and i doubled the vanilla because i didn't have "double strength" vanilla- and the cookies had so much flavor. thank you for this great recipe- it will be my standard from now on!!

Now I finally know that I do not like shortening in my chocolate cookies. I will stick to my recipe that uses butter. I think these cookies looked prettier and my husband liked the softer texture.Worth trying because you just might prefer your chocolate chip cookies without the butter. Nothing wrong with this recipe at all.

My mother is an awesome cook and baker, but one thing she has never been able to master is chocolate chip cookies. I went on the hunt one day and found this recipe! They beat any chocolate chip cookie, hands down! I also mix it up a bit. I've use white chocolate chips and crushed macadamia nuts and in another batch I used a little cocoa in place of some flour and white chocolate chips. It makes a great cookie every time!

These cookies came out perfect!  Next time I might try using 2/3 shortening and 1/3 butter, just because I could tell the difference and happen to like butter, but these looked and tasted great!

I have been trying to find a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe. I want just a little crispy but a soft chewy middle. These cookies were just ok. The first batch came out of the oven and looked and tasted awesome! I burnt the 2nd batch because I didn't set my timer and the third batch did not flatten. They remained clumped in a ball. The taste was good though. Next time I will use semi sweet chocolate chips. I will try this recipe again.

Excellent recipe. My 3 year old son that will not eat anything has to be told not to eat more of this. It took me a while to get this done right, then again I had never baked cookies before in my life. So when people say they are too flat, to crisp too whatever.... it's probably them and not the recipe. Trust me, if I can do them right I'm sure anyone else can so give them a second try if the first were not that good. The dough has to have a consistency that when battered all together seems to be play dough (cracks a little bit, might let one or two chips fall off).

instant family hit! i made over a hundred of these cookies and in 3 days, they were completely gone. my mother-in-law's family came in from out of town and could not stop raving about how good these cookies were. the only thing i changed with my second batch was that i used semi-sweet mixed with milk chocolate, and i thought they came out tasting better. but i think you can do what's up to you because these cookies taste wonderful either way.

I enjoyed this cookie and would bake it again as is. 

I am wondering if anyone can give me any advice to make this cookie with a little more substance to it?

As it is I do believe it is a very good cookie recipe however!

I’m new at baking cookies.  I didn't have a problem with cookie dough spreading too much, in fact, mine never spread.  What did I do wrong?  I used butter instead of shortening and 1c of sugar instead of 1 ½ c.  I used hand mixer to beat wet ingredients.  I added some milk hoping to make the dough spread a little.  It didn’t work.  So I just shaped the dough flat before putting it in the oven.  I only used 1c of choc chips, just my preference.  The cookies were very tasty though.

This is really the best chocolate chip recipe that I have tried in a long time.  It is very easy and my family loves it.  I bake up a batch fairly quickly and they get eaten right away.  I use regular vanilla and sometimes I use milk chocolate chips and sometimes I use semi-sweet mini chips.  They still come out great.  The recipe is so easy that my young son can make it himself.

This is a great recipe--easy to double, too.  It is also very forgiving--I realized after mixing in the dry ingredients that I forgot one cup of flour. I went ahead and added it and the recipe still turned out great.  Very crisp and soft in the middle.

These were great. I could not find Mexican vanilla extract, and had to use the regular, but they were great. I can't wait to find the other and try these again.

I've made cookies using this recipe twice now.  The first time I used it, I followed it exactly.  I wasn't terribly thrilled about the appearance, as I prefer thicker, puffy-looking cookies, but the taste was excellent.  The second time I used this recipe I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and added walnuts to the dough.  It came out perfect :-)  Very good recipe overall and my family greatly enjoyed it :-)

Well this was not my favorite. I found that in order for them to resemble a baked cookie I had to press them and they were still raw in the middle. The flavour was good.  But I have used better recipes.

My first batch was baked at 8 minutes and was very undercooked. I waited for them to become firmer but they simply flattened and then fell apart and were thrown out. Second batch was baked for 10 minutes and they were only slightly firmer and very crumbly. Ok taste but a little on the sickly sweet side for me and very oily - too much butter.

I thought these were just okay. I made them exactly to the recipe without any alterations.  I'm not sure if its the fact they're made with shortning instead of butter or if it was the milk chocolate chips.  I will stick to my tried and true recipe with butter and semi-sweet chips.

These are tasty, but they are a bit cakey.  Plus, the first time I made them, they burnt around the edges and didn't cook in the middle.  They turn out fairly nicely on a baking stone.  I REALLY prefer chewy cookies, so I'm still looking for the right recipe.  I think the best one I've found so far is "World's Greatest Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies."

This recipe is by far the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. The first time I used it I made the cookies with mint chocolate chips, and the with half milk chocolate and half peanut butter chips. It's nice that you can play with the recipe and it is still awesome!

I needed a recipe where I didn't have to soften any butter and liked this because it used shortening.  I had butter flavored shortening.  I should also add that I had 1 egg yolk and about 1/3 cup dry vanilla pudding left over from a recipe (that flopped and was the intended treat to give to someone) so thought I would throw those in.  So I used 1 whole egg and the 1 eggyolk.  These came out perfectly!  They don't spread much while baking so alot can go on the sheet.  They actually look like bakery cookies.  I had a 10oz package of those whitechoc/choc swirl chips so used those and tossed in a handful of white chips.  This is the recipe I'll use when I have an extra egg yolk that I need to do something with.  Quick to whip up start to finish.  Thanks for saving me!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! My husband told me I should win an award for my cookies (I think he may be a touch biased), but all joking aside, they were excellent. I used whole wheat flower instead of all purpose, and thus needed a third egg to make it mix, but they came out wnoderfully.

These cookies aren't bad. When I make choc chip cookies, they disappear VERY fast in my house, these still seem to be lingering around after a week. I might try them again, but as others suggest, I will use butter and less chocolate chips and see how things turn out. Not too bad of a recipe though. Absolutely the Best? Well it is an opinion.

Fantastic cookies!  I used regular vanilla.  I also make the dough and formed it into two "logs" and wrapped in wax paper froze for about 40 minutes (or longer) then all I have to do is "slice and bake".  Using butter flavor shortening instead of butter makes the perfect texture for cookies--firm on the outside, chewy on the inside. Do not overbake, they may not look done, but they continue to cook when you remove them from the oven.  If you freeze and slice the dough you may have to bake a little longer.

Excellent cookies! I made no changes at all except using margerine instead of butter flavoured shortening & using 2 packets of plain choc chips (200g per batch). The other change I made was making half the amount of cookies so they were JUMBO ones! This meant the cooking time was slightly longer.

I was looking for a crispy cookie but this wasn't it. Nevertheless, these are pretty good cookies. I didn't have enough white sugar on hand so I substituted it with more brown sugar and it turned out fine. Also substituted the all- purpose flour with plain flour=)

these really ARE the best! i have tried many chocolate chip cookie recipes and this is by far my favourite. i like soft, chewy cookies, and this is perfect. one tip: i like to cut the chocolate chips down to 1.5 cups and add in half a cup of Skor chips- makes the recipe even better, and a bit unique.

This recipe was also used in a bakery in the philadelphia area and sold thousands a day. The cookies are great for many reasons, for one, they can be frozen up to a week (maybe more), thawed, and still taste completly fresh. They also have a high tollerance for shipping.

Every time I make cookies they flatten out too much.  But these did not..and my family LOVES them (my husband raves about their 'dunkability')!. I originally made them to bring to work, but my husband claimed them so I ended up having to make 2 batches.

I didnt think you could improve the "classic" chocolate chip cookie, but these were the BEST cookies I have tasted!

These were good but there is another recipe on this site that I liked better.  I prefer butter to the butter flavored shortening.

My kids liked this but I really did not care for them. They are great if you like a crunchy cookie, but I felt they were very flat and too crucnhy.

I made these in a pinch since I couldn't find my original recipe for a 3rd grade bake sale.  My kids love them, but I have had and have made better.  I was rather disappointed with the crispy texture, but they taste great to the kids and that's what counted this time around.  They do taste great and go excellent with a glass of milk.  Thanks Nicole!

I hate to disagree...but these weren't "absolutely the best..."  I think the biggest difference is I am an "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" user and I found the Crisco butter flavored shortening made them too greasy tasting.  Try this trick too...use ICBINB margerine and substitute one box of cheesecake flavored Jello pudding for 1/2 cup of flour.... My family finds those awesome. I like my recipe better, but thanks for sharing.

This is the best recipe I've found for chocolate chip cookies.  Anyone that has eaten these cookies usually asks for the recipe.  I've found that Ghiradelli Chocolate chips add a great flavor to this recipe.

These cookies turned out very well.  I gave them to a couple of friends and they really enjoyed them.  I did make a couple of changes:
1 - I added a bit of chocolate milk in the batter
2 - I used half shorting and half butter
3 - I used accent instead of regular salt (it brought out the flavor).
Good recipe. I would recommend it to others.

The 5 star rating comes from my cookie loving husband. He says they are "rich,dense and buttery, not cakey and light".(Just like he likes them) He didn't mind that they were flat. I added 1/2 cup of toffee pieces (Skor)& used Ghiradelli Double chocolate chips which may have influenced the finished product.I could taste the salt and baking soda.I froze some of the  dough and it was good mixed in with vanilla ice cream but I think I will continue my hunt for my "perfect" cookie.

These are the best cookies i have ever made...every time i make them they're gone in two hours! i had to sneak some away to save for the next day to see if they would still be good and to my great surprise they were even better the next day!! Anyone who disagrees shouldn't be baking them! i use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

This recipe is awesome!  I brought some cookies into work and people were asking for seconds.  I'm not a big sweets person and I couldn't stop eating them.  The recipe was very easy and the cookies came out perfect.  If I could I'd rate this recipe a 10.

I used regular vanilla since there have been warnings about using Mexican Vanilla...some of it isn't vanilla at all but tonka bean extract which is extremely toxic. The cookies were great though and the butter flavored shortning made them stay soft and delicious. A fabulous cookie recipe that I will use again and again!

I use this recipe to try something different to cure the chocolate craving last night and I was not very impressed. Although, they had a decent taste, the recipe called for to much shortening and they were very flat.  My fiance' said to never make them again. If you try it use less shortening.

Looks good but who keeps mexican vanilla on hand? I use PURE VANILLA EXTRACT from McCormick. Also, what would happen if I just used Self Rising Flour. I think both would work.

Enjoy!

I don't know if I did something wrong but I did NOT like these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they had a funny sort of taste afterwards, not at all what you would expect from regular chocolate chip cookies.  The kids hardly touched them.

I really like these cookies, a little too much in fact since I'm the one eating them all.  I have never seen Mexican vanilla before so if anyone knows where to find some, pass it on.  Is it really different from regular vanilla?

I made these last night... my daughter had eaten all my chocolate chips but I had a bag of peanut butter/chocolate chip mixture.. I added that and made them with my medium sized scoop... they were really big cookies... but... they were the BEST cookies I’ve ever had!! Crackled on top with a little bit of crunchy and soft inside... they were so good!! I told my husband these are the kind you go to a bakery for!! I’m making white chocolate macadamia nut tonight with this recipe... thank you so much for sharing! My new favorite recipe!!!

This recipe replaced my "toll house" recipe about 2 yrs ago when I came upon it while looking for a recipe that makes a softer cookie!  They are so good-they don't last long enough to get hard & crunchy!

I'm not TOO crazy about cookies, but these were really good. My first time making cookies from scratch and I was quite pleased. The only change I made was adding one extra egg. Maybe mine weren't as large as those used in the video tutorial.

Love this recipe. I make some ahead , I make the dough scoop them into balls and place on cookie sheet and put in freezer. I leave till hard and put in zip lock bag. When I want some I just put on cookie sheet frozen and bake a usual . Comes out same and when you want a cookie there is always one there in 10 min or how ever long your oven takes:)

I loved these! I was out of butter and looking for a good cookie recipe that I was planning to substitute shortening for and then I found this one that doesn't use butter anyway. I didn't have Mexican vanilla, so I had to use regular and I used a little less chocolate chips just because it's what I had left and I like a little less. I halved the recipe and baked them on parchment paper and they turned out lovely and delicious. I did have to bake them longer than suggested - about 13 mins.

Amazing! This is only my second time using this recipe, but EVERYBODY loves them! One person said that these cookies were the best I've ever made. I will use chocolate chips, however, sometimes I spice it up with mini M&M's or peanut butter chips, and they turn out great! I use normal vanilla extract instead of mexican vanilla extract and they still taste great. One suggestion, I put in 1/4 teaspoon of salt instead of 1, as I found they were too salty for my liking. Other than that, these are the BEST!

BEAUTIFUL cookie recipe. Absolutely awesome. Keep in mind: Check your cookies before bringing them out because my oven took twice as long to cook (about 18 minutes) the cookies. We also used 1/3 cup of butter and 2/3 cup of shortening as we were almost out of shortening, and it turned out beautiful. My favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies on this site so far. Will be doing again.

These cookies were amazing! They were so moist and chocolate-y.  I loved them, my neighbor loved them, my boyfriend and his parents loved them, my sister loved them and even asked for the recipe... SO GOOD! This will be my go-to recipe for choc chip cookies.  The only change I made was just to use regular vanilla extract, because it's what I had.

I have not tried the recipe, but I sure saved it.  While some complain about them being flat, it is exactly what I have been looking for.  I asked my mom many years ago why mine didn't come out flat like hers, and I never found out, so here's hoping mine come out flat, just like Mom's!

I have made several top rated/popular Choco-chip cookie recipes on here and these by far out of any of them and any that i have had or made in my life are above all the -best- their texture is perfect, the outside it thin and crispy, when cooked on a heavy Nordic aluminum pan they come out gorgeous, crackle top with a glisten from the sugar crystallizing. The thickness is perfect, not too thin or thick. I used nestle mini morsels (1cup) and special dark chocolate chips (1cup). I know that Crisco is not good for you but by golly does it do wonders in baking. As my mother would say it is a dessert and its alright if it is not great for you, because you're only supposed to have it as a dessert! 1 cookie after dinner won't hurt ;) Summery : these cookies melt in your mouth, and their buttery light crispy goodness will be haunting you for another. ( and just like any other thing your cook or bake, DON'T cook them for to long, DUH that is how anything come out bad, so just like in most cases if you didn't follow the recipe and it comes out like , clearly it id operator error, and if you did it right and it came out bad then you should find another recipe, but if 1,000+ people claim its incredible... maybe you should check out the dates on your ingredients. ;)

I was so happy with this recipe after combining a few reviews in. I used butter instead of shortening, used a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and one egg instead of two. Just for fun, I tossed in a dash a cinnamon. I left them in for exactly 10 minutes. They flattened out which was awesome (personally not a fan of a cake-like cookie) and taste great. Crisp edges and soft middle.

Try doing a 12 serving batch. Omit the two tablespoons of the brown sugar and white sugar. This edit makes it great. You can remove the chocolate chips if you do not like them.  
Also, soften the butter first or let the batter sit awhile.

Great recipe.  I'm surprised because I do not like to use shortening but I did this time and they turned out great.  I didn't have mexican vanilla, I just used regular, ( not sure if there is a difference).  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Basically, it is the original Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe, but with Mexican vanilla. That makes it more of a secret ingredient than a secret recipe!!

Well, I tried subsituting the Shortening with Butter because we were out... I would'nt recommend it. They came out very cakey, which my family and I are not big fans of. Usually when I make cookies they are gone in a day or less, when I made these, it's been 3 days and there are a couple left. Well, I guess I willl try the recipe again with Shortening and see how it goes. :D Thanks for the recipe though, others seem to enjoy it. xD

This is my favorite chocolate chip recipe, and I have tried MANY!  I use butter instead of shortening, and regular vanilla.  These cookies are fool-proof for a beginning baker.

These cookies were really good!! My brothers and sisters said they were the best!  The only thing I did different was use butter and not shorting, and I moved the rack in the oven up higher so they took more like 15min to cook, but they were a  perfect light brown.   Thanks for sharing!!

These cookies came out great, perfect combination of sweet with a little bit of salt, they form nicely while baking. Baking time can vary with this recipe, for a gooey center thake them out a min - 2 sooner or for more of a crunch leave for an extra min. I use parchment paper so they don't burn, and changed the recipe slightly

My last "favorite" chocolate chip cookie recipe has been pulled offline so I tried this one. I had used most of my chocolate chips elsewhere, so I made some without them and then added them to the second half of the dough. 

I also had some caramel sauce to use up that I added. The recipe was too dry for me, I did not use all the flour and what I had put it would barely mix (must be climate, since every recipe does this to me) so the caramel sauce helped even things out.


They're really good this way, by the way! They don't need the chocolate if it's not available.

These cookies get gobbled up super quick!  I substitute 1 cup of softened butter and 5 teaspoons of vanilla, and I find 10 minutes in the oven is perfect.  My family thanks you for sharing this recipe!

This is the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe yet! The only thing I did differently is used salted butter because that is what I had in the house and used a smaller amount of chocolate chips because I like my cookies less sweet. Turned out soft and yummy! Will make again and again!

The shortening helps the cookies from flattening out entirely, but since there is no acid in this recipe, baking powder would be a better choice than soda, I think. I second-guessed myself and made these with half soda and half powder. I bet they would be even more to my liking if I had gone with just powder.

This is a good cookie one I've been making for years.Sounds alot like the toll house cookie recipe. The difference is they use 1 cup butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, and semisweet choco chips. Like I said good toll house cookie.

Love this recipe! I also melted the butter before adding in, and I substituted 1.25 cups (of the called for 2.25 cups) of regular flour with whole wheat and you can't even tell. The cookies were amazing.

I'm making the recipe again with stevia sweetener and hope that this still results in a decent cookie... because the regular recipe was too addictive to eat all the time!

These cookies turned out great! They're soft and chewy on the inside and just crispy enough on the outside. I didn't follow this recipe perfectly, though. I only had half a cup of butter, so I substituted some canola oil to get the desired batter consistency and taste. I also used two and a half tablespoons of regular, organic vanilla extract. I didn't have milk chocolate chips, so I used semi-sweet. The trick is to taste the batter and try to figure out what's missing! If you have a terrible batter, you'll end up with terrible cookies.   This is probably going to be my go-to chocolate chip recipe because I feel like I got it just right!

These are awesome. SO much more flavorful than your typical chocolate chip cookie base (with butter etc.) I've made these countless times, and end up calling them my garbage dump cookies because every time I add pecans,walnuts,white chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips, a splash of honey and maple syrup, and a few rolled oats. People are ALWAYS begging me for the recipe and asking me "can you please make more of those garbage dump cookies?" =)

Great cookie recipe! The ONLY thing I did differently, and was ONLY because I was trying to salvage a 'recipe gone wrong', is that instead of using JUST flour, I ground up the caramel popcorn I had 'TRIED' making (what didn't burn, I put too much salt on....blech), and I used 1/2 Flour and 1/2 Ground Up Caramel Popcorn Flour. I made sure to use unsalted real butter, so it offset the salt in my popcorn flour.  Well, my children who were soooo disappointed by that awful caramel popcorn I made, were SO THRILLED with these cookies!

Good Recipe! I didn't have chocolate chips in the house, so I just cut up an chocolate Easter bunny into chunks, which worked just fine.

I altered the recipe a bit. Not because it didn't look decent, but because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used 3/4 cup of butter instead of the 1 cup of shortening, baking power instead of soda, and I'm pretty sure I only put 1 1/4 cup of flour in. That last one was an accident, but other than the first batch being a little flat, the cookies tasted great. I usually have a general rule that I always use butter and not shortening when baking cookies, so I don't know that I will ever try the original recipe, but I still enjoyed making and eating the final product.

These were really good.  Still on my quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie.  Oddly, these tasted better the next day.  Comments from the family: maybe a little too much butter flavoring.

These are fantastic!  I made them using whole wheat flour, pecans and some chopped up white chocolate in addition to the two cups of chocolate chips.  I used butter in place of the butter flavoured shortening.  My yield was 40 cookies.

This is the best and easiest recipe I have ever used, My cookies used to always come out flat and since i switched to this recipe they come out perfect everytime! I wouldn't change anything from this recipe except everyone once and a while I do white and milk chocolate chips and walnuts. They are DELICIOUS!

i understand that if you're going to change the recipe as much as i did than you might as well submit your own but being new at this, i'd rather not subkect myself to that sort of criticism yet :).  I needed that basic chocolate chip recipe and this is that first one I came across. Overall, my cookies turned out a little cakier than I prefer but it may be due in part to my modifications: I used light butter (half the fat of reg) instead of shortening. I did not have a full 3/4 cup white sugar so i blended the 1/3 cup i did have with splenda to reach the full 3/4 cup. I was also short on vanilla (looks like I need to go grocery shopping) so i only used about 1 tsp ( I had planned on doing a tablespoon per another reviewers suggestion). I also used 1/2c. egg substitute instead of actual eggs -- also reducing the fat.  all things considered: I am very pleased with my somewhat lowfat chococate chip cookies. I'm sure if I had made them according to the suggested fat content, they would have lived up to their potential.  p.s. i was able to get 37 of what i consider to be the perfect size cookie from this recipe... ??

This is my go-to recipe for yummy cookies, however I never use the shortening or mexican vanilla and instead use butter and normal vanilla. Still come out great.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing this needs is a nice cold glass of milk. I used a small cookie scoop and made almost 4 dozen rather than 2.

I made these today and the cookiees were so flat when I took them out of the oven. The taste was good but the presentation was not too appealing as the edges were burned and the entire cookies was spread out on the pan and had to be scrapped off. Will continue my search for the best chocolate chip cookie.

I was really disappointed.  When I tasted the cookie dough, it didn't taste as good as cookie dough usually tastes.  I checked the recipe to make sure I didn't leave anything out (I hadn't).  I baked them, and they came out crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Sounds perfect, but there was an aftertaste afterward that tasted kind of fishy.  I believe that was the butter flavored shortening that gave me my results.  I LOVE chocolate chip cookies, but I won't remake this recipe.

These are NOT the best chocolate chip cookies ever. They are actually very bland, and would be much better with butter, but if you don't like real chocolate (semisweet), you will probably like them.

This Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe was awesome! For my whole entire life I've been sticking to the Nestle Tollhouse Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe. Until today, I decided to try this one and it turned out even better than my recipe! But the dough did taste a little too tasteless, there wasn't must taste in the dough. Other than that it was the best! I made if for a bunch of little kids and they loved it! It's very chewy! AWESOME! Thanks for sharing!

An instant hit with my friends and flatmates! Making a sandwich at uni is rare so baking is really unheard of! It helps that the cookies turned out surprisingly well. Made 2 dozen and they are all but gone now... Followed the recipe other than that I used unsalted butter instead of shortening. After mucking up the first couple of batches I made the dough again, and this time I folded in the chocolate chips after I put the spoonfuls onto the cookie tray- it's much easier this way. The only issue I had was that the bottoms of the cookies didn't brown properly. I tried putting the tray to a lower rack in the oven as advised on google as well as trying a thinner tray, but it didn't make much of a difference. It's the first time I've used the oven at my dorm so I can't say for sure if it's the recipe... other than that, great recipe! I could tell that I'll be making more very soon!

This is the exact recipe that I bought off ebay a couple of years ago for .25.  It is an excellent recipe that I still use today.  I do add more flour, about 1/2 cup more, & decrease the vanilla back to 1 teaspoon because the other was too overpowering.  All in all, it's a keeper.

This recipe is okay but I thought the shortening took away from the flavor. I did use butter flavored shortening but the effect was inferior to that of cookies made with butter.

These were absolutely fantastic the first day. Moist, chewy, and delicious. However, they'd become extremely hard and brittle by the next day. I would make again, but for this. The recipe could have easily stood extra chocolate chips. Thanks for the recipe!

Yes, I believe that is the absolute best chocolate chip recipe!  I used half cup regular shortening and half cup margarine.  Yummy!

My family LOVES these cookies! I didn't have the Mexican vanilla, so I followed the suggestion to substitute 6 tsp. of regular vanilla. I also followed the tip to leave the cookies on the sheet for 10 minutes after taking them out of the oven. They're amazing!

Wow! For the longest time i have had such a hard time trying to make "the perfect" chocolate chip cookie. It just seemed that no matter what i did they always came out wrong. They tasted fine enough but they were always either to lumpy or spread out flat like pancakes! This recipe worked perfectly! The only changes i made to it where to only use 6 Tbs of shortening and 6 Tbs of butter. And i used 2 Tbs of regular Vanilla extract because i didn't have any of that Mexican Vanilla Extract.

Not the "Best" I've ever had, but very tasty. Mine took about 14 minutes took cook. I think I may try using margarine instead of shortening next time. very yummy!

I usually use more chips then the recipe calls for, and I add nuts. I use this as my base cookie, and then alternate the chips/fruit/nuts that I add.  If I refrigerate the dough a half hour before baking, I get better results.

I thought these were delightful! they stayed moist and chewy. The only thing I noticed that was bad was that they tasted "floury". I think the chocolate makes up for it! :)
All around these are some great cookies!

This are not "the best." I followed the recipe exactly and they just came out ok, not impressive. Also, it took an extra 4 minutes than the recipe says to get them fully baked.

These are great, in response to anothers review...my mom had the most incredible recipe for candied yams. She mad it evey year and kept the recipe a secret. After begging and begging fo it she finally handed it over on a recipe card in her handwritting as it was passed down to her from her mother. several years later I found the exact same recipe right down to the measurements in the Better Homes and Garden cookbook. It happens...get over it.

This was pretty tasty!  The only things I found to change were that it actually took between 12-14 minutes to cook all the way.  Also, my boyfriend thought it had too many chocolate chips.  I recommend using 1 to 1 1/2 cups of chips instead if you want more cookie and less chocolate.  Also, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips because I find milk chocolate chips are just too sweet to go into cookies.

I loved these cookies! I used butter instead of shortening and they turned out crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Just the way we like them in our house.  They go really well with a glass of milk.

With the current chocolate bar price wars I decided to just chop up 3 large milk chocolate cadberry bars in place of the chips,yum! I agree with "Good Eats" Alton Brown, the butter flavor shortening makes a better cookie than butter.

These cookies look like a classic cc cookie, however they lack the classic taste. The texture was nice. I used imitation vanilla; perhaps that was the problem. I don't know. I will try them with more vanilla.

It's true...These are absolutely the best! The Butter flavor shortening adds that special 'yumminess' and makes them soft.  I added cinnamon and they are a hit around our house...as long as they last.  Tip: Take them out of the oven before they turn brown, but leave on the cookie sheet the recommended time.

I used this recipe last night and these cookies truly live up to their name! I used milk chocolate chunks because the store have chips, this made them even better. I have found that the Kroger milk chocolate chips taste better than name brand.

I gave it 5 stars but I should say that my personal opinion is that it needs nuts. Next time I will add walnuts or pecans. Texture is perfect; they are a little sweet,  but I would think the nuts will help that. I followed the recipe exactly except for using semi sweeet mini chips instead of milk chocolate. These are delish!

3 inch cookies. The recipe said I would yeild 48 but didn't say how big.  I  substituted half a cup of softened butter and added it to the remaining shortening. I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. I made these for a bake sale.  They should go fast.

I used all butter and took one other persons recommendation to melt the butter and use 1T of vanilla.  The cookies are delicious.  They are brown and a little crisp around the edges but very soft in the middle!  Love them!

My husbands words to this one were "delicious". I can say I do agree with him.  I also added butterscotch and white chocolate chips to this

Tried this today and there is nothing extraordinary about this cookie.  Not much of a taste, basic recipe from the butter flavored crisco package.  Followed the recipe exactly, won't be making this again.  A real baker would know this is nothing to write home about.

Love this cookie- we added a tbs of cinnamon (MMMmmMM) and used plain crisco w/o a problem. You can find Mexican Vanilla in the "ethnic" aisle in most Wal-Mart stores. Sometimes you can get 1/2 a gallon for 2-3$

This was a worthwhile bake. Interesting without being a total stunner! The kitchen was mess when I was finished, but what a delicious odour - throughout the whole house! My my. My neighbours were wondering what on earth it was! Until I told them that I had found the chocolate chip cookie recipe from America that was out of this world! What an odour, I tell you!  And then we  tasted them. Piping hot, I must say! And ssurprisingly chewy on the outside and rather crispy on the inside. Odd. But quite good , really. Well done!

Took these cookies on a weekend to an inn with friends and everyone said they were fantastic.  I used butter instead of butter flavored shortening and mixed semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips.  Did not add nuts, but one person suggested that would be a nice touch.

Absolutely perfect. i tried the original recipe first then used white chocolate chips in lieu of the darker/milk variety as I am not a huge chocolate person. They turned out even better to my taste!

Yummalicious!!  These cookies came out a little thin to make them crispy on the outside and soft and gooey in the middle.  I used choc. chips and peanut butter chips.  Will definitely make this my #1 choc. chip recipe.

These were wonderful!  Turned out perfect - soft in the middle and cruchy on the outside.  These were not "cakey" at all - as some reviews mentioned.  I made these exactly as the recipe stated except I used semi-sweet chocolate chips (my personal preference).  I baked these on my "Pampered Chef Stoneware" (the only way to bake cookies) - and they were perfect!

These were just a little bland for us. However, they baked up beautifully and stayed nice and soft in a ziploc bag. Not sure what was missing..

These cookies are "Absolutely the Best"!  I have made them so many times in the last year, becuase everyone I make them for absolutely loves them!  I use dark chocolate chunks, instead of regular chocolate chips, which adds nice big chunks of chocolate within the cookies.  These chookies are so soft and have that perfect homemade taste.

This is almost the same recipe as the one on the back of the Toll House Chocolate Chip bags (only difference is using shortening instead of butter).  These cookies came out of the oven flat and crunchy.  By the third batch I decided not to grease the pan and this helped a little.  From now on I'll stick to my old recipe.

These cookies had a good flavor maybe just a bit "floury" if that's a word. I've never had luck with chocolate chip cookies but at least they tasted pretty good. They were very flat though.

Awesome!! I had a recipe for choc chip cookies that I really didnt care for, being that the cookies would end up with a cake-like texture. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Crispy edges and sooo flavorful. I am so happy I found this recipe!

Good but too floury for our tastes...Nothing beats the original Toll House recipe (in my opinion).  But, if you want something new, try this one.  A lot of people seem to like it.

These cookies are really delicious.  They are moist and not cakey or crispy.  My husband really liked these too,  and said these are the best cookies I've ever made.  I have tried many recipes and some turn out cakey, which we don't like, or too crispy. These are perfect. I used becel margarine, and added 2 cups finely chopped walnuts. I put them in a zip lock and they are still moist and chewy  the next day.I will use this recipe from now on.

I made these the other night and they were delicious! I used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 of semi-sweet. Also used half butter flavoured margarine and half shortening. Do NOT overcook!! Everyone loved them.

These were great!  I used vegan butter sticks and vegan choc chips because of my daughters dairy allergy.  They were so good that my husband and I want to follow the recipe exact next time for us.

I am not much of a cook; my husband has been begging me to make choc chip cookies for 6 years now, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've done it (and flopped)....I sucked it up and again--and let me tell you, these were great!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup reg shortening.  My kids love them and loved helping me make them, and my husband is EXTREMELY pleased.

This is the one that gets my husband's vote of approval. It is the only reason I buy butter flavored Crisco! The texture comes out not too flat and not too cakey.

I too have been on the hunt for "the perfect" choc chip cookie recipe...if it even exists.  This was not a horrible recipe - just not "the best".  They came out pretty consistent and it would have been hard to screw them up.  But, they really just tasted like the "Crisco" chocolate chip cookie recipe that comes in the "Crisco Sticks" package.  Nothing special, but a decent recipe, and they store well.

These are some of the best cookies I've ever made!  I make them all the time and always get excellent compliments on them!  The difference in this recipe and others is that you use the butter flavored crisco and the mexican vanilla, this kind of vanilla is much sweeter than brown!

These really are great cookies! Everyone couldn't stop eating them. I substituted margarine for the shortening and didn't have a problem. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter and didn't have a problem with the dough being dry. Add the flour in three steps and you shouldn't have a problem. I also used "bakers secret" cookie sheets and didn't have a problem with flat cookies like some people had mentioned.

I was really looking forward to these- I bought the hard-to-find Mexican vanilla & everything! Not my idea of the perfect chocolate chip cookie. Almost all cc cookies taste great right out of the oven. These are flat, & I like them "taller." Chilling dough doesn't help either. I guess different people have different ideas of what the perfect chocolate chip cookie should be!

Boring! I thought these would be better with all the great reviews but they were just normal chocolate chips. I've been looking for a recipe that makes REALLY fantastick chocolate chips and this definately was not it. Even with the butter crisco. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RECIPE if you want something absolutely fanatastic because this is definately not it. These are just regular cookies.

This is an all-time favorite--I get requests for it constantly at work!  I use butter instead of the shortening, and use regular vanilla instead of Mexican vanilla.  Don't cook them too long and they'll stay nice & soft!

The cookies were only taste right out of the oven, but what isn't.
The next day, they were too hard, and for named "best cookies" they were nothing special.

Wonderful flavored cookie!  My family loved this recipe.  I only wish they would have spread out more, instead of keeping the same little ball shape they started as.  I don't know if it's the recipe or just my altitude (Utah), but overall very yummy!

I have made this recipe several times now and my family loves it. I add different things to the cookies in addition to the chocolate chips like apricots, yogurt covered pretzels, cinnamon chips, coconut, five types of nuts, and abuelita.

Just a very good cookie. Buttery. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Accidentally mixed all the ingrediance into my mixing bowl. Flour went everywhere but in the end I cam up with a firm batter and the cookies rose beautifully. Not flat at all. Cookies are somewhat firm...Make sure you have a lot of cold milk on hand!

Usually don't leave feedback, but this one is worth it. I have made these cookies my baby's blessing, my friends baby shower and for other special occasions.  Now everyone wants the recipe, or wants me to bring them to the next get together.  They are the best!!  Grandma even likes them!

These were ok...they were a little greasy.  Also, if you cook them for too short they don't get brown, but once they finally get brown, they get too hard.

You should use light brown sugar with this recipe.  Dark brown sugar will cause the cookies to come out of the oven very crunchy (and I like my cookies moist!) Also, you can use this recipe at Christmas time.  Don't add the chocolate chips, and when the cookies come out of the oven, then top it with some holiday m&ms!

These were good hot out of the oven, but got hard the next day.  Would agree with previous reviewer also:  too much shortening made them flat.

Great!! These are delicious. When I am really craving chocolate I add cocoa and these make scrumptious chocolate bombs. I prefer using regular vanilla over mexican. And I don't grease my cookie sheets there is enough grease in them to keep them from sticking. Whenever I make this recipie my family rejoices. And everyone appreciates it when I bring these to church gatherings.

My teenage daughter & I made these as a "welcome to the neighborhood gift" for the new neighbors.  Unfortunately, after we tasted them they only recieved half of what we made them as my family devoured the other half.  This is my new "Old Family Recipe..." and will make it a permanent addition to my kitchen file, thanks for a goodie!  Someone mentioned it was similar to Toll House, well the butter flavored Crisco, milk chocolate chips (instead of semi-sweet) and the mexican vanilla are what give it the different distinct flavor!

These cookies tasted great! The milk chocolate and Mexican vanilla (I used Madagascar vanilla, another very pure and very flavorful vanilla) truly add to the richness of the cookies.  If you like super rich cookies, you will love these.  I also added about 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts, and this added to the texture with a little extra crunch.  I had to bake the cookies an extra two minutes to get "golden brown."

I was taken in by the name and the positive reviews and had to try this recipe.  It was very easy to make and the cookies were very well recieved.  In fact, I took them to a party and the kids there liked them so well they ate all of them leaving lots of other kinds of cookies on the counter to be left overs.  I thought they were a little too sticky because they flattend out a LOT as they cooled so I will probably do what another reviewer of the recipe did and add about a 1/2 cup more flour the next time I make them so they keep their shape a bit better.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks : )

Very easy recipe. My daughter loved them. However, by greasing the cookie sheet, they burned on the outside and the inside remained uncooked. The next batch, I didnt grease the cookie sheet, and cooked them for 9 minutes. The outside was *perfect* and the inside remained just a little bit gooey. We like gooey cookies though. I'd say its a good recipe, but next time I'll use baking parchment to line my sheet and perhaps try cooking them a minute more.

I think I overcooked the cookies.  I was waiting for them to turn a little brown but it took longer than they were suppose to.  Next time I will take them out when I timer goes no matter how light coloured they look.  They have the potential to be really good.  michele, Ontario

I thought they were too soft. I like the "Neiman Marcus" recipe much better.
Maybe it's my personal taste! My husband liked them though!

I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate and they turned out great! I needed to make them fast for after a dinner, and everyone thought they were great.

My only changes were that I doubled the recipe and put nuts into 1/4 of the dough and the rest without.  I also used no stick foil for ease of cookie removal and no wash cookie sheets.  Everyone is happy and all said this IS the Best Chocolate Chip cookies ever.

I made these instead of making my mother's cc cookie recipe and I wish I hadn't.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I don't know if that's what changed the taste but these were the most bland tasting cookies I've ever had in my life.  I will never use this recipe again.

I successfully bake a lot and I followed the recipe exactly. I wrote it down and double checked the ingredients  but the finished product looks nothing like pictured. I was hoping for a crispy cookie. Instead they look like the delicious mincemeat cookies I made about 10 days ago. So it’s not my shortening. I hope I can post a picture of the finished cookie. The taste is okay. It’s just disappointing that they are thick. I even made smaller cookies for the second cookie sheet. And I pressed them down but they are still nothing like pictured or described. 

I also think for my taste there’s too many chocolate chips. But that’s just me. So I am not a fan. No offense.  Next time I will use my late mother’s recipe which I cannot locate thus far.

My go-to recipe! I always use a little bit less salt, use real butter instead of the flavoured shortening, and make them small so there's more to go around. They always disappear within hours of baking!
Make sure that the butter isn't melted when combining with other ingredients, the consistency becomes very liquid and cookies turn out flat and too soft.

I usually struggle with Chocolate chip cookies, but these Turned out great. Doubled recipe (i recommend). Used regular sheet pans (special air flow one made them flat) and only cooked 1 pan at a time (verically) in oven, on top rack, farthest from heat source. Cooked 8 mins only and allowed to cool 5 mins on sheet pan before removing. Spent the 5 mins scooping next pan up. Use Medium pampered chef scoop to portion, 8 cookies to a pan, flatten slightly after scooping. Most beautiful cookies I've made. Since I am gluten free, I don't have a review on taste. I made these for family and friends. Will update in future when i get their response!

I am not a fan of chocolate chip cookies but these cookies I LOVE!  They are truly the best and so easy to make.  I use Country Crock baking sticks and Trader Joe's chocolate chunks and they come out perfect every time.  Thank you thank you thank you for posting this recipe.

Amazing cookies! Chewy centre and slightly crispy exterior. No flattening at all. To avoid getting flattened cookies: make sure to really beat the shortening (or butter if you’ve substituted), sugar, egg mixture until it turns very light beige and is light and fluffy (took 2-3 min of beating at medium speed with electric mixer after adding each egg to get this result). I made a batch with shortening and one with butter: very similar results, FYI in case you only have butter on hand.

Awesome recipe! I did sub butter for shortening & put dough in the refrig for about an hour before baking ~ per the oth reviews.  It was also recommended to bake for only 8 minutes & I wish that I had noted this & will follow this baking time on my nxt batch. Even w/ the additional baking they were great & my family loved them. Recipe is a keeper!

Even butter flavored shortening couldn’t cut the greasy texture for me. Others liked them, but they weren’t what I was looking for. I like a less sweet cookie to offset the chocolate chips. Butter is needed for that.

This isn't much of a "secret" family recipe considering it's printed on the back of the Tollhouse chocolate chip bag.  Cookies were still good, but I've had much better.

Cookies were still soft and tasty even after 7 days. Good flavor, easy to make, looked like they came from a bakery. Only changes were 1/4 tsp cream of tartar, used super dark brown sugar, and used dark chocolate disks with extra disks stuck into the dough tops before baking. Will make these again and again.

These are amazing! I didn't have the butter flavoured shortening, so I used 3/4 cup salted butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil (just because I'm crazy about coconut!). I also used smashed leftover Easter chocolates instead of chocolate chips. Super amazing! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I love it. I would suggest try cutting the sugar by 1/4 cup. Instead of the butter flavored shortening, you can make half butter and half shortening. And don't forget that you can't go wrong with an overflow of chocolate chips! Happy Baking!

This is the exact recipe on the nestle chocolate chip bag with shortening substituted for butter and milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. I make them all the time but since I live at a high altitude, over 4000 ft, I have to add extra flour so they don't go flat. I use 3 cups of flour and they come out perfect.

My son requested chocolate chip cookies with "no nuts, and with milk chocolate chips", so I gave these a try. I didn't have butter flavored shortening, so I used half Crisco/half real butter. While mine didn't turn out as pretty as the ones in the picture (mine spread out quite a bit), they were still tasty. I only made half a batch, as these are just for my son's lunches. He likes them, so that's what counts.

I don't like to call any recipe "Best" because I've found there is always something better out there.  However, that being said, this was a darn good cookie.  Not too sweet and just the right texture.  I used dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate.

Excellent texture and flavor!  I used butter and substituted some of the chocolate chips with mini M & M's I had on hand.  I also reduced the amount of Mexican vanilla I used because mine is very thick and has an intense flavor.  I increased the cooking time by 2 minutes for my oven.  Perfect cookie!

Quick and easy. Soft in the middle and crunchier on the edges. A bit too sweet though, I'd suggest using less sugar.

Haven't tried yet but know it's good from ingredients.  Replying to comment about Mexican Vanilla. Be careful when buying vanilla in MX. Lived there couple years and definitely  "bad" and "good" ones. Look for "no coumarin" on.bottle and should, of course, smell very "vanillaish". Reputable dealer will let you smell it! Like everything, sellers know tourists are easily fooled and can't come back to complain!

I really enjoyed these cookies. I used regular vegetable oil shortening rather than butter flavored and we put in milk chocolate chips.  One of my new favorite cookie recipes for sure.

I've tried a lot of chocolate cookie recipes.  This is my all time favourite.  The cookies are soooo delicious.  The shortening is definitely the key.  I always make them to bring to parties and as small Christmas presents.  They are always a hit.

These are the BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever made. I used real butter and added caramel bits in the cookie dough. I also sprinkled sea salt on top of the cookies before I put them in the oven. These are really good and whoever ate from them literally BEGGED for more. I absolutely give these 5 stars. I will always make them when guests come over. I recommend you try them with or without the caramel.

Love me a soft and chunky chocolate chip cookie. This is it.  Like previous reviewer I was skeptical about using butter flavored shortening in place of butter, but the shortening does work. I made no deviations from the actual recipe.

I used butter and followed the advice on two tablespoons of vanilla. They disappeared.

Yummy cookies! I did change things a bit: I used butter in place of sahortenoing , did not have vanilla so omitted it (but would have been even better!), used a combination of mini and full sized chocolate chips, added in chopped pecans for a little bite, baked them about 15 minutes rather then 8-10, and I used all white sugar (I find it is more better that way). I usually mix up my recipes and do a little experimenting to create my own product. Thank you for the recipe, though. It is something good to look back on. I'm sure you are a wonderful cook/baker and always will be. -Gemma

Instead of milk chocolate chips I used semi-sweet (since these were the only ones I had). The cookies turned out okay but really thick and not that chewy. Also they tasted a little cakey. Although, they were crunchy on the corners and soft in the middle which was good. I was a little disappointed with the result - next time I'll try using one egg instead of two.

These turned out super flat. I added over 1/2 cup flour to them and they still were flat. They spread all over the pan. I think the flavor was on point but the texture was so off. I will not make these again.

Really really good.   I subbed butter for shortening, out of necessity, and increased the vanilla (didn't have Mexican) to 1 Tbsp.   The bake time was longer than the recipe says, but it resulted in a slightly crispy edge with a slightly chewy center, just how I like it.   I'm sure that I could have baked them and made them a crispy cookie, just how my lady likes them, but this time, it was all about me.   Thank you for a great recipe.

These are good cookies, but I was using the picture to judge and was looking for a less floury or cake-like as another commentor mentioned. Next time I will try their suggestion. I like a flatter, thinner chocolate chip cookie. Good nonetheless.

"Oh my God" were the first words I said after taking one bite - I baked these at 350 for 12 minutes (I made them a little large) and they are perfect!!   A little crispy on the outside and the chips are warm and soft....highly recommend for a cookie fix   :)

Truly is the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made/tasted.  I used regular vanilla.  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used 1/4 cup melted butter and 3/4 cup shortening.  Also left cookies on sheet about 2 minutes. These are excellent.  A little it crunchy around the rim and then melt in your mouth softness inside.

They are okay but not the BEST
 lost my recipe and thought this sounded close but nope. Turned out flat and i had to cut them into squares as they turned into a blob. I didn't have vanilla so I used maple syrup which was okay. Good not great but not bad either

I can honestly say, without any doubt in my mind that this is my favorite cookie recipe. ALWAYS my go-to for chocolate chip cookies! I am usually terrible at baking, but even my first time making these they came out so wonderful that they didn't last one day in my house. Even a family friend, who said that it was impossible to make cookies that were better than his aunt's, admitted after he tried them that these were the best cookies he has ever had. Thanks so much for this recipe!

These are pretty good cookies. I've made them a few times now. If you want them to be even tastier add caramels to them. Just hand press them into the dough before placing them onto the cookie sheets. My mom asked me to make more of them. Thanks for the recipe! :-)

Excellent cookie recipe!! A super good balance of sweet and salty! I did not add as many chips as directed and added walnuts. I like to taste the cookie part just as much as chips.** I also had to bake them a few minutes longer, my oven is a bit on the old side.** You may want to do a test cookie for baking time purposes. THANKS for posting!

I used dark brown sugar, added 1 cup of oatmeal, and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavored margarine (I remember my mom's old betty crocker cookbook had half and half butter/crisco). They look beautiful...just like I think a chocolate chip cookie should look! I let them sit on the cookie sheet for 5+ minutes, then put them on the rack. They have a thin, crispy crust and a soft middle! I had to increase the baking time about 4 minutes due to using the LARGE Pampered Chef Cookie scoop.

You have to have this NOW! It was so good, I almost died! My dad took four, pretty unhealthy, huh? I put in a bit less flour (1/2 cup) and still worked out. I put in 2 cups of chocolate chips and that was way too many! Try 1/2 cups, I did it and it was better. Hope you have it soon!

These are delicious!  One variation of this recipe I did when I had no chips to add was replace the vanilla with almond extract, add 50% more salt.  Then after cooling, spread some frosting on top.  The extra salt helps contrast the sweetness of the frosting making a very delicious treat.

These are amazing as m&m cookies. After a few days, they became crumbly. I am in high altitude, so I'll probably need to just use a little less flour. But, in any case, this is a great base recipe!

I made the recipe on a dry day, and is used just a spoonful less of flour.  I made a test cookie at 9 minutes, but it fell apart when we tasted it, once it had cooled. So I baked the batch 10 minutes. After they cooled, they were crispy, not soft in the middle, like when they were baked at 9 minutes.

A great basic chocolate chip cookie.  Buttery, sweet, salty, and a good consistency.

It is a nice recipe, but, is not a family secret recipe. i have made this many times before, and i usually use organic chocolate chips, but last time i made this i was out of organic, so, i used Toll House chocolate chips.... then i look at their recipe, and compared it to this..... i realized that they are the same recipe!!!
i don't know if  NICOLEFAUSTHUNT knows it, but this is the toll house recipe only the ingredients are moved around, and the mexican vanilla. :(

I have never made cookies with shortening, but had some left over from another recipes and wanted to use it, so I decided to try these.  They are so amazing - quite possibly my favorite chocolate chip cookie ever!  I don't know if it is the shortening or just the overall recipe, and I'll probably try them with butter later because I normally have butter around, but wow, I love them so much - and the whole family agrees.  They are nice and soft but with a deliciously crispy edge.  Will make again for sure.

This is a great recipe... Thanks to all who shared their tips and experiences.... I used dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate (it is all I had),  and used equal portions of butter and shortening. Also, I added a little bit of cinnamon... This were the best chocolate chip cookies I had made... My husband devoured them quickly.

Of course this recipe is jammin'!!  This is the Classic Toll House Cookie recipe with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips - using 2 tsp of Mexican vanilla instead of 1tsp of regular vanilla. And I just noticed it isn't butter - they added butter flavored shortening which we will probably discover causes cancer in 20 years...
 Nestle puts a lot of time, effort, and money into their test kitchen.   I've never made a recipe from the back of any of their chip bags that wasn't excellent.  Of course they seem to like the same type of cookies I do - chewy or crisp (or both if you can manage it, crisp edges with chewy centers)and totally decadent.   You can keep your cakey cookie recipes, this is just how I like them!

The recipe was easy to follow.  The only thing I "accidently" did was add 1 c. of brown sugar.  I over measured.  I did not have Mexican vanilla so I used regular vanilla.  And I also used 2 brown eggs (since they were a gift from and aunt and uncle's farm).  The cookies turned out deelish!!!!  This is now my go to recipe for choco-chip!!!  I can't wait to mix in some other ingredients to change around the flavor.  My teenage daughter tried them and said they were "off the chain", which means the best.  Thanks!!!

These are my new favorite cookies!  They are delicious!  I followed a few tricks from other reviews.  Melting the butter was genius (but I also had to up the flour by 1/4 cup).  I upped the vanilla to 1T.  It also helped me to refrigerate the dough for about 10 minutes just to make it easier to handle.  These are amazing, enjoy!

These were ok. They were a little more crumbly/cakey and not as chewy as I was looking for. I did use regular vanilla instead of Mexican.

I usually use the recipe on the chocolate chip bag, but I had 2 bags of Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet Mini Chips and there was a cupcake recipe on the bag, so I went  looking and found this wonderful recipe. I had no butter-flavored Crisco, but I had plain so I doubled the recipe using 1 cup of Crisco and 1 cup of butter, in an attempt to get the butter flavor. I also used the semi-sweet mini chips rather than milk chocolate as that is what I had in the pantry. Luckily, I had Mexican vanilla! Wow, what a hit. I took them to work and several people told me they were the best chocolate chip cookies they had ever had. I had many requests for the recipe. The combo of shortening and butter made them crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and let me tell you, these are outstanding cookies. 
Thanks so much for the recipe Nicole!

These are great. I used semisweet chocolate chunks, unflavoured shortening and 3 tspn pure vanilla extract. I think the biggest difference between these cookies and the rest is the salty batter. The full teaspoon of salt really adds a nice flavour.

Great recipe!  My son and husband claim this as their "Go To" recipe for chocolate chip cookies now!  The 3 times we've made them, we use butter and regular semi sweet chips (because that's all we had) and drop them by tablespoon, baking for 10 min and they come out perfectly--no aftertaste, and just the right thickness for chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  To make sure we don't eat the whole batch in one night, we freeze the dough to help with  rationing.  Thank you for sharing!

I've always used Mexican vanilla in my cookies, but it must be this particular combination of ingredients that did the trick.  These are the cookies for which I've been looking for years!  Chewy and soft and so moist!  I took them to a party last night and they were a HUGE HIT!  I followed the recipe to the tiniest detail.  Thanks :)

Great recipe! chewy and moist! The extra tsp of vanilla (compared to most CCC recipes) really makes the flavors pop! I did notice that they came out much better using a pizza/baking stone - they are a bit chewier, had a more appealing texture, and weren't as flat as the ones I did on a cookie sheet.

Really Good! This is friend's mom's "secret" recipe growing up. I asked her for it once and she gave me Tollhouse. Well I'm sure glad that you posted this because it is as good as hers even if they weren't willing to share. Many Thanks to you!

These cookies taste great. But I had to add an extra cup of flour after my first two trays went flat while baking. I wasn't impressed with that but they still tasted amazing.

This is the first chocolate chip cookie recipe that has EVER worked for me. The only things I changed, was I used one egg instead of two and used regular vanilla. They came out crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. The only thing is they came out a little pale, BUT that did not keep them from being eaten lol. This will be my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookie from now on!

Excellent! I added a little less baking soda -- probably about 3/4 of a teaspoon, and these turned out great. I'll definitely make them again!

Great! I loved these. I have been using the so-so recipe in Better Homes and Gdns for years and decided to try this one. So glad I did! I added an extra tsp of vanilla, which gave them more flavour. Perfect texture. I will make these again for sure.

This recipe is SUPER simple. It's practically the same recipe on the back of the Hershey chocolate chip bag but it's worth making if you haven't yet. One change: I baked at 375 for 7 minutes since my scoops are a lot smaller than normal. They still came out perfectly soft inside. I love to make smaller sized cookies. Out of this recipe, I ended up with 72 cookies! a lot more than I intended.. but I'm sure they'll ALL be eaten in no time :)

These are by far the best cookies ever!  I use the base recipe for making white chocolate chip macadamia too.  You can subsitute anything for the chocolate chips and still have the perfect cookie.  Thank you for sharing this recipe as it will stay in my family for many years to come.  Award winning!

i can"t tell you how many thousands of cookies I have made in my day, but these are the best I have ever had. I didn't grease the cookie sheets, but used parchment paper, instead.  I didn't time them, either. I just took them out when they were a very light golden brown.  so good. Everyone said they were the best they have ever had. I made them for the first time this Christmas, tripled the recipe and STILL had to make another tripled recipe because I ran out. I was about to make them again tonight because i crave them. I am seriously bummed that i don't have any eggs. lol  I have officially thrown away every other chocolate chip cookie recipe i had.  Be sure to keep these in an air-tight container because they are amazing soft.

I made these for christmas after trying so many different ch chip cookie recipes i wanted to try a new one. I thought these sounded like a good recipe. I didnt have any butter flavor crisco, so i used half cup butter and half cup regular crisco, 3 tsp. van ext.(not mexican)  and i used dark ch. chips in my cookies.  I refrigerated the dough for about an hour and they came out on the thin side but very delicious out of the oven,  how chocolate chip cookies are suppose to be.  Very tasty. I dont know what the SECRET is in this recipe but they do turn out good.

Okay I don't know why the complaints about this recipe, it's basically the original Tollhouse if you compare the ingredients.. Only only complaint is the oven temp and time is waaay off! It should really be 375 instead of 350 and for 12 minutes not 10! Otherwise it's the same as tollhouse and your basic chocolate chip cookie... I

After ordering some wonderful gourmet chocolate chip cookies online from a company called Shelbys Gourmet Cookies at www.shelbyscookies.com I started experimenting with different recipes to see if I could recreate the same cookies at home.  I think I hit a home run with this recipe.  My cookies came out chewy and moist just the way I like them.  Great job!

These turn out every time! I use real butter instead of shortening (I use butter for all of my baking) and they turn out brilliantly. Sometimes I do 1/3 Skor (toffee) chips to 2/3 chocolate chips and it's a nice change.   Just make sure you don't overbake - if you catch them just as they begin to brown, they stay wonderfully chewy. People ALWAYS rave when I make these and I'm known for making the best chocolate chip cookies.

i liked the recipe a lot but i found that it was a little too sweet so next time i might just only use 1/2 a cup of each sugar. also using normal butter worked fine. they were really nice and chewy and soaked up the milk from my cup just the way i liked it! i loved it!

These are absolutely the best chocolate chip cookies ever!  I have been searching high and low for the perfect recipe, and this is it!  I make these a lot with chopped pecans added in, and they are delicious! Thank you! The only difference in my recipe is I get 53 cookies every time, not 24, but I'm not complaining! :)

I was looking for a cookie that baked consistently from the first batch to the last. These were excellent. Tastes great, looked great.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it is a great recipe. I've been using it for years. I originally got it off the back of a bag of chocolate chips...The only difference is this one uses shortening instead of butter and has 1 more teaspooon of vanilla extract.

yummy.. chewwy.. and delicious. make a lot.Decided to try this recipe since it looked good. i have many different choc. chip cookie recipes. This is another i can add to my collection. I added a bag of choc. chips and a bit more mini choc. chips to make sure there is plenty of choc. chips in every bite. I also baked them for 10 minutes and took them out slightly under cooked and let them bake more on the sheet. and ummmm yummy thy come out chewy and soft. just like my husband likes them.... thank u.

Just made these (my house smells yummy!!).  They are awesome.  Kids loved them.  I added a tsp. of almond - and cooked them for longer than the recipe called for.  Overall a 10!

the butter flavored shortening combines the best of both worlds; the flavor of butter and a very moist chewy cookie.  Absolutely the best!

Good flavour, but came out flatter than I like.  Would make good cookies for ice cream sandwiches.  Definitely not the best.

These cookies were pretty good. They definately were not the best, I'll say. I used 2 cups mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate chips. It tastes alot better and gives it better flavoring. All in all, I still think the Nestle Already-Made cookies taste ten times better.

I made these and they turned out so yummy!  I did reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. and use half butter and half shortening.  Key is to make sure you beat these until they are fluffy and let the dough stand in the fridge.  Mine came out very puffy, not flat at all and not too over the top sweet!

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe! They are so soft and yummy! Yes I do agree that you should only put them in for 8 min., otherwise they won't be soft.

I've been making these for years now, but I'm only now getting around to reviewing them.  The name says it all.  They are in fact the best chocolate chip cookies.  I used to think it was the butter flavored crisco, but now I just think it is the milk chocolate chips.  Mmm.

Yumm. I put about 2 T of butter with the shortening because mine was not butter flavored. Mak sure that you take them out of the oven before they look done so that they stay nice and soft. Great recipe!

I loved this recipe! I made several batches and handed them out to a few of my friends for their birthdays. They all loved them. My family liked them a lot, too. They seemed slightly salty to me, but it may just be me. Thanks! =)

SUPER good. 
My boyfriend went insane for these (said he liek dthem better than his mom's! BWAHA! in your face, mother-in-law!! hehe ^_^)
The only thing I did differently, was that I used whole flour, just because I already had it and didn't want to buy more white flour...
Thanks for the great recipe!!

After trying every chocolate chip cookie recipe I could find I found this one and it is a keeper! I used a large ice cream scoop to make giant cookies so I added a few minutes to the cook time.  These cookies usually don't last a day in our home!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Ok.. well.. I did change the baking temp to 375 for 8 minutes.  I found out they dont spread to much then.  I also used 1 cup mini chocolate chips then placed 3 m&m's on top.  I am making these cookies for my son's class, so I think the kids will enjoy them!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these cookies this morning and LOOOOVED them! I love that they are nice and chewy and thick.  I used semi-sweet chips instead and you DEFINATELY have to double or triple the vanilla.  I didn't use mexican vanilla. I just used pure vanilla and it was still a great cookie!  You do not have to worry about these flattening out or spreading...they hold a great shape. Also used half butter half shortening for the real butter taste.

Watkins Vanilla is the best vanilla to use in these cookies!  It only has 8% alchohol and is double strength, so you have way more vanilla flavor in them.

I am always looking for great CC cookie recipes and this is IT!  
The other reviewers who have had problems with this recipe must have done something wrong because these cookies were gorgeous, and tasty! I always use bittersweet chips because I'm not a milk chocolate lover and they were fabulous!

The texture and the appearance of the cookies was great. They tasted ok but not great. I don't know what I did wrong but I could really taste the crisco and the cookies were really greasy.  Not the best cc cookies i've ever had but not bad. Next time I might try half crisco half butter.

I have been craving a good homemade CC cookie and this was it. I made two batchs 1 w/nuts and without. I took them to work where we have a lot of cooks, and everyone loved them. My picky sister has even requested them for her work bake sale. Mexican vanilla does the trick. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is like the one on the back of the flour bag. I used butter instead of shortening. I think i'll stick with the pre made cookie tubes.

Recipe lives up to it's name!  I made these cookies for my boyfriend to celebrate our 6 month anniversary.  I just made them, so he hasn't tried them yet but, I'm sure he'll love them.  I think they're good!  Thanks!

I baked these and was really impressed with how they turned out.  My husband thought that they were "from a box" and the kids kept sneaking them from the cooling rack.  I did have to substitute for NZ products (cant get crisco, used marg/butter blend), - but awesome cookies.  Thanks!

Very good!  The Crisco makes these cookies very moist.  I left a plate on the counter all day for my roommates to enjoy while I was at class and work and by the time I got home they were as if I had just baked them!  I sent the majority of the cookies to my boyfriend via mail and although they haven't arrived yet, I'm willing to bet they will still be just as moist!

Great Cookies!!! A staple at my house. I like to use the mini chocolate chips with them. As with all cookies be sure and not over bake! I use regular vanilla, tried the Mexican kind and didn't care for it as much.

VERY GOOD.  SOFT AND NO TOO SWEET.  I USE 1 STICK OF BUTTER AND 1/2 STICK OF REGULAR CRISCO.
MUY BUENAS.  BLANDITAS Y NO MUY DULCES.  USE UNA BARRA DE MANTEQUILLA Y 1/2 BARRA DE MANTECA CRISCO REGULAR.

I've made this recipe several times and without fail they have come out to be the best cookie ever.  I've made them following the recipe exactly and I've made them with some revisions to the recipe and they've always come out perfectly.   They are pretty sweet and I use a whole bag of chocolate chip chunks, so that may be why.  I'll have to have my boyfriend try them to give a somewhat unbiased answer :)

These are absolutely AMAZING!!! I have never had chocolate chip cookies this delicious! My favorite have always been the softbatch brand and these top those entirely. My husband has made several batches and they don't last around our home. The kids, and we know how honest children are, say that their dad makes the best chocolate chip cookies in the world. They are GREAT!!! Thanks for sharing.

I had to use ordinary vanilla extract for these. The only reson they don't get a 5 is beacuse they spread more than I was expecting. My girls still loved them and the fact that I am once more looking at an empty cookie tin says it all. Many Thanks.

Just got done baking these.  Very yummy.  Nice and crispy on outside but chewy on inside.  I think I would like them better with semi sweet chocolate chips, I will do that next time.  I do love the butter shortening in this cookie compared to just butter.  Quite a difference in the texture of the cookie.

This is a very good cookie. It is crispier than I expected, but has a good flavor. I think semi-sweet chips and some pecans would make an even better tasting cookie.

These are very good cookies. However, I could taste the butter-flavored shortening, especially when they were still warm & gooey. They were much better after they had cooled completely. They look very nice and the family keeps going back to the kitchen for another cookie, so overall these are very good cookies.

Yummy.
I used butter/margarine sticks instead. Would have helped if I kinda melt it or soften it in the microwave oven. 
It is delicious. 
Baked it for about 10 mins and it is nice and soft and delicious!

Really yummy chocolate chip cookies! I made these with butter, semi-sweet choc chips, and extra vanilla and I am so happy with them. They have a great texture... crispy edges and chewy centers. And, they were so easy to make. I just served them to my dad (a true chocoholic) and he just came back for seconds (of three cookies at a time). I will definitely make these again... the only thing I think I might do differently next time is just a little less salt.

These were easy to make and delicious.  I usually bake my cookies for a shorter period then called for but these took the full amount of time.

Really good. I followed the advice of reviewer AIGEL3 at the bottom of the recipe page. Melt the butter and a tbsp of vanilla. I just had regular, and I used half butter half shortening. They turned out great. I left out some of the choc. chips, they probably get such good reviews b/c there is 2 cups of chips rather than the standard 1 cup! Milk chocolate chips - my husbands favorite.

These were delicious!  We are still baking them, and the kids are raving about them.  My 8 & 11 yr olds made them with little assistance.  One slight change...we used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I love this recipe, but I made some changes to it to suit my tastes.

I cut the baking soda in half. I find them too cake-y and not chewy enough with the amount of baking soda called for. I use half shortening/half butter, and I use normal pure vanilla extract instead of Mexican vanilla. 

I also usually make these as Caramel Peanut Butter Chip Cookies, by adding 1 cup of small caramel pieces (ie Skor pieces), and 1 cup peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.

very good dough, though a bit sweet for me (and that's saying a lot), and a little greasy from the shortening. i used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips, which made them even sweeter. i didn't grease the cookie sheet since there was plenty of shortening in the dough.

I made these cookies, but with butterscotch chips and sprinkled white sugar on top so they were sparkley.  I brought them to the workers at a very popular breakfast place in Calgary and have been begged daily to make more by everyone who tasted them.

I made these cookies and have never receieved so many compliments on anything I have ever made.  Great recipe!  These are truly the best.  I think the Mexican Vanilla made a difference.  I'm glad I didn't substitute the regular vanilla for it.

I thought these were good, but not the best. They tasted like the average chocolate chip cookie, but I think I thought it would taste sooo much better than that. Great recipe though!

The good news is that the cookies are tastey; however, as I suspected, using shortening instead of real butter puts the "rich" factor over the top. I just finished making 8 dozen of these, and after eating three (to test oven temp, etc...), I feel like a brick is in my stomach. Again, they taste good (I'll be serving them tonight to 35 people), but I won't use this recipe again, opting instead for a recipe using real butter.

I halved the recipe and despite following directions, these weren't the best.  The cookies didn't brown very well, but remained light appearing to be somewhat undercooked.  They did not develop well and were not as presentable as I'd hoped.  I'll pass on this recipe next time.

these cookies are amazing! i substituted margarine for butter and used a little bit less of it then called for in the recipe. I used an ice cream scooper to set these down on the cookie tray and they came out like great big cookies!! Delicious! thanks for the recipe!!

I thought I'd try using this recipe because it calls for butter-flavored shortening rather then just plain butter and I wanted to experiment with something different. These cookies came out soft and slightly puffy. The taste of the cookie is good though, but I personally prefer dense moist cookies. I also must admit I prefer using real butter because it spreads more and tastes richer, but for those who like softer texture rather than chewier dense cookies, this recipe does the trick.

This is the best cookie dough recipe, if you're a cookie dough fan, you will love it. My friends ask me to make this when we're watching a movie and plan to bake some, but the dough tastes so good we finish it before we can bake a single cookie.

If you use dark chocolate and dark brown sugar it will taste exactly like Pillsbury's. Excellent recipe, love it!

AMAZING! My cookies came out delicious! This was my first time making homemade cookies and my husband went crazy over them. I added some walnut chips to the second batch and they were great! Definitely the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tried- probably because I made them myself! =) Enjoy!!

I loved this recipe!  I made it on Sunday for my family then made a huge batch for my daughter’s volleyball team on Wednesday.  I did not have butter flavored shortening so I used butter and I also used semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate.  This will be the only recipe I will use for chocolate chip cookies from now on.  Thank you.

Mine also didn't turn out like the photo, but maybe because I made a few ingredient switches. I was out of brown sugar, so i used light (which probably did it). I also used regular vanilla, and dark chocolate chips. They were a little crunchier than i would have liked, but were eaten quickly at work. I am going to keep looking for mexican vanilla, though and try this again! Thanks

Very good recipe, I like the cookies a little brown and crunchy, so I baked them a little longer. I also did what someone else had suggested, I used butter plus a little shortening, to simulate the flavored shortening, which worked fine. Try em, there great!

I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used margarine and regular vanilla.  They are a little flat, but very good.  Nice and crisp around the edges.  I also baked them on parchment paper.

These cookies were very good and I am VERY picky about chocolate chip cookies. These are just the way I like them, chewy in the middle and crisp around the edges.

OMG!! these are amazing!! they are my fave! other then being a little flat wen baked there perfect. i change 3 things though. i added 1C of B.sugar instead of 3/4, i used partialy melted butter instead of flavord shortening and i put 3 tsp. of vanilla. i also baked half the batch for and extra 4 min (12 min) and they were nice and brown and haf a lovely crunchy crust! (i perfer cookies both a lil under and over done). anyway... I VERY MUCH RECOMED THEM!!!

These are by far THE best chocolate chip cookies that I've ever made.  I used Ghiradelli double chocolate chips and the taste was very intense.  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  Thanks for such a great recipe !!

This is my favorite cookie. I have made them several times. I took them to work and everyone loved them. They are moist and soft on the inside but crunchy on the outside - I found that they came out best if you handle the dough as little as possible so they spread out better. If you roll them or make them the consistancy of the prepackaged stuff, they don't spread out enough and don't cook as well. I also add the dry stuff very slowly so it mixes all the way.

These cookies are excellent! Personally, they are not my absolute favorite because they are kinda cakey, but they are still delicious and soft everytime i make them. It made a lot more cookies than I thought, which was fine by me!

Not the best cookie I've tasted. Better to reduce the sugar content. Also in order to achieve a chewy texture, I set the temperature at 160ºC for 8-10 mins. The only complaint is that the cookies turned out flat even though I used egg yolks only & too sweet.

I made these today, and yes...they are good, but as some other reviews say, they really aren't anything special.  I thought they lacked flavor, so after I made on pan, I added peanut butter chips, and that helped a lot.  They are good, and I might make them again because I like that they are soft, yet have crispy edges. I just didn't thing they were the "best cookies ever."

I personally don't like these cookies.  I don't like the texture of cookies that are made with shortening.  My family loved them though..they thought they tasted like Pilsbury slice and bake cookies.

I used lactose-free margarine, melted, and made some with chocolate chips and some with quartered Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - they were fabulous!!! The margarine made them really thin & crispy - my whole household is addicted! Thanks!

I have made my fair-share of Choc-Chip cookies and this by far has topped them all! 
This time I used White Chocolate instad and they turned out wonderful. Also... used regular vanilla and they tasted just as nice! I (and my family) would give this recipe the GOLD STAR!!

Good, but I guess I'm too used to the traditional "Toll House" recipe and this just didn't top that. I did make 2 batches with 2 different mexican vanillas and like the one with the Neilson-Massey vanilla better versus the HUGE bottle of vanilla from Mexico I found.

I really liked this recipe. I used regular vanilla extract, and looking at the recipe, it was strickingly familiar to the Nestle Toll House 
recipe. The two changes were the "mexican vanilla"
verse the regular and the butter flavored crisco verse the butter on the Toll House. Same recipe to me. A good one at that.

I'm not sure how to rate this one.  It tastes ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS when it comes out right, and not so great when it doesn't.  It was my favorite recipe, but when I tried it on another cookie sheet they just refused to come out right.

Everyone in and out of my family loved them.  I usually don't do recipes twice since I found all recipes because there's too much variety to stick with one, but after this one I didn't try any others and have repeated several times. The best!

These cookies turned out very very good in my cookie press.  We used wilton paste food coloring and the cookies were such vibrant colors!  My kids liked these enough to make again.  These were not bland, and tasted especially good warm.

I just used the imitation extract and the crisco golden shortening and it turned out fab. I like a crisp chocolate chip cookie... I like chocolate period! hehehe!  And for Christmas, instead of adding the chocolate chips, I took the new chocolate dark buds in the willow pack and dropped them into the centre after I dropped it on the pan and molded the batter around it. They turned out looking great and tasting great!

This is by far THE best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever!  The cookie remains chewie, but still crispy on the outside.  I added some walnuts to the mix for those who like nuts.  I also was able to get 3 dozen out of the batch.  I'm making more.  They're going fast!!! Thanks!!!!

A lot of shortening in this recipe ... but the resulting cookie is crisp yet soft with a fantastic flavor.  Use a cookie scoop for an almost store-bought look.

This is exactly what it says, the best! I didn't have any Mexican Vanilla, so I used just plain old imitation vanilla extract, and these were fabulous! Everyone raved over them! I made them extra chocolately by adding chips to the tops of the cookies just before baking. MMMM gooey!

I made these cookies last night and they were extremely easy, quick and delicious.  I used regular shortening and vanilla extract and they turn out great!  One of the best chocolate chip cookies I have had in a long time.  Thanks.

I doubled the recipe and gave them out to everyone I knew.  They were very tasty.  The only thing I didn't have was mexican vanilla extract.  I used regular and they turned out great.  I wonder what they taste like with the mexican vanilla.

these were great cookies, indeed, but i think this amount of shortening is too much.  next time, i'll use less.  the cookies and the dough were extremely oily, even after refrigeration.  still turned out pretty good, though!

This recipe is, without a doubt, the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever had. I couldn't believe how great they tasted and how quick and easy there were to make. The only downside is that they get stale fast so it's best to eat them while they're warm and fresh. But still worth it!!!

Without a doubt, these are *the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had*!  I usually don't like chocolate chip cookies, but I couldn't stop eating these!  They have the perfect "bite"-just the right crispness on the outside and so chewy on the inside.  For sure, this is our standard chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I'll be making huge batches of these for holiday presents for neighbours and friends-they are so much better than any "gourmet" cookie shop.  Wow!

These cookies are outstanding!  The first time I made it, I made it as it...great!  The next time, I used a mix of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips, (1 1/2 cups), and added chopped pecans (1/2 cup), and used 1/4 cup butter/ 3/4 cup shortening.....EVEN BETTER!  I just use the regular vanilla since I wasn't sure what Mexican Vanilla was.  This is now my NEW official chocolate chip cookie recipe!

I am a perfectionist when it comes to baking cookies...and I was hesitant to use the milk chocolate chips (I am such a big fan of semi-sweet)...but these turned out perfect (texture & taste) and my husband informed me that this is our new chocolate chip cookie recipe!  Try it!

They're okay, but WAY TOO GREASY.  My suggestion: add 1/2 cup milk; and instead of 1 cup shortening, use 1/2 to 3/4 cup.  3/4 is still a lot.  Other than that, pretty good.

My 10 year old daughter and I liked your recipe.  We made one batch of the cookies and had fun making them.  We tasted a couple and they were delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

They were a little too crunchy for me. But that is just my preference with cookies. I used semi-sweet chips which made them a lot less sweet. I think that I will try the milk chocolate chips next time.

These cookies are delicious.  The dough is very creamy and my family loved the milk chocolate chips.  I had a little trouble juding when to take them out of the oven, because they always look light brown to me.  I found that 8 minutes was good for a chewier cookie, and 9 to 10 for a crisper cookie.  Great recipe--the cookies were all gone in a couple of hours!

Absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever had.  I only use 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  Super easy, very tasty. THE BEST!!!!!!

These cookies are very rich.  If I make these again I will reduce the amount of butter and chocholate chips used.  The batter froze well.

This cookie recipe, though it takes longer to bake a pizza pie version of it, was absolutely wonderful. It was extra chocolatey (especially while using a liquid measuring cup to measure the two cups choc. chips). I would make this recipe every time I make choc. chip cookies.

the texture of these was weird! they went completely smooth on top. they were quite bland, but i`ll have to say that they were chewy! not the best though. the only thing that really made them good was teh chocolate chips! i`ve had better recipes for sure!

We tried this one out and really enjoyed it. I tried a few suggestions from the Secrets of really good chocolate chip cookies web page at: http://www.well.com/user/vard/cookies.html. I used melted butter, did not grease the pans, and used 1 Tablespoon of vanilla and they turned out great. Definately a 5 star rating from everyone who tried them.

Best chocolate chip cookies ever.  I took them to a 4th of July cookout, and to work.
Everyone, and I mean everyone loved them, and begged for the recipe.

These are so good, I have not been able to make a good chocolate chip cookie in years. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening because I did not have butter flavor shortening. I also icreased the flour by 1/4 cup. Excellent!

Very easy and very delicious. The cookies tasted great even after a few days. I doubled the recipe and froze some of the dough - from freezer to cookie sheet to oven, they were still just as delicious. Thanks!

this recipe is NO different than any other.
my favorite cookie is choc. chip so i was excited to try this since they all say these are the best
but they are just regular, still good but regular.
i used 1 cup of butter instead of shortning.
they came out flat. i've made better ones in the past.. sorry.....

These are great...I subsituted marg for the shortening...but they were still great! Halfway through mixing it looked like it wasn't coming together, and we thought about adding water or something, but then all of the sudden, it became cookie dough, smooth as can be. We had to beat it alot. The result...excellent cookies!!

I am a 17 year old male, who has just discovered the joys of cooking, and this recipe was wonderful to start out with. It's easy and simply delicious. My family said that they tasted better than Mom's own secret recipe! Quite rewarding when you are first starting out! :)

My measurements were inaccurate, I mixed everything togeather, butter took the place of shortning and I'm NOT the domestic type.  Despite all odds against me the cookies turned out great.  Crispy outside, chewy inside.  I placed MOUNDING tablespoons on the ungreased cookie sheet and baked them for 15 minutes.  A couple of these cookies are as good as it gets while my boyfriend is out of town!

These cookies are great!! Personally, I found them a bit too sweet, but everyone else loved them!!! I added 1/2 cup more flour as I read in other reviews and they still turned out light and fluffy!!! Wonderful cookies!!!

The cookies were fabulous. I substitued 1/2 of cocoa powder for part of the flour. And they made the most utterly delicious double chocolate cookies. You have to make this recipies it is the best for cookies that I have tried yet. If you want them chewy or crispy. Either way they are delicious. This is definately my cookies recipies from now on. This recipie is perfect in every way.

These were so good!! My batch made 3 dozen instead of 2, and I used regular vanilla extract instead of Mexican. They came out wonderful, chewy and soft!! Yum!

Add a 1/2 a cup of flour, so that they aren't too gooey.  Better than tollhouse!

I made these for family and coworkers, and was reprimanded for not making enough!  Next time, I'll definitely double the recipe.  They were excellent.

[I did get more than 24 cookies (closer to 40) out of the 24 scaled recipe.]

Fantastic! My husband said they were the best cookies he'd ever eaten. I added a tad more flour and used butter. They were great.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The cookies are DELICIOUS!  I couldn't find Mexican Vanilla so I used regular vanilla and it still came out great.  I baked half on an air cushion baking sheet and the other half on a regular baking sheet.  The cookies baked on the air cushion came out flat while the ones baked on the regular baking sheet had a nice cookie mound.  My stepson had this to say, "These are just as good as my mom's!"

Instead of 2 eggs I used 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of creamed silken tofu. I also added 1 cup broken walnuts.
Excellent vegan cookies

I have finally found a chocolate chip cookie recipe I can pretend has been passed down for generations.  I changed the name to Rollyson Family Chocolate Chip Cookies and who knew?  My kids love these cookies.  SOOO much better than tollhouse!!  No comparison.

This is far and away one of the best chocolate chip recipes I have ever had. It will now be my main cookie recipe. The recipe actually made me three dozen cookies, which was good because my 13 yr old thought there were only two dozen. So I did get some cookies after all.

These turned out great.  I added Maxwell House Cafe cappuccino Mocha flavor to them because I love mocha and they still tasted excellent.  I didn't have the butter flavored shortening so I added butter extract to the crisco and whipped it in.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the perfect recipe for basic chocolate chip cookies.  I thought the taste and texture was perfect.  We used semisweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate, because that's our preference.   I liked these cookies because there wasn't alot of added extras like nuts or oatmeal. They're perfect as they are.

These are undoubtably the BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever made!  I tend to destroy cookies when I make them, but these were fool proof!  I don't care what the other people say about where this recipe came from.  It's fabulous, thanks for submitting it.
