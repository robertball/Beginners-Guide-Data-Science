So refreshing! I loved the little hits of mint with the fruit. It was beautiful to look at and the sherry elevated the flavor to something very, very special indeed. I would definitely have this again.

I liked this melon recipe as a 3.5-4 star when I forst made it, but then I decided to serve it with a touch of vanilla yogurt, granola crumbles and added more mint - it was fabulous and my guests loved it. The quality of your sherry also plays a big role - higher quality sherry does have a mild flavor, not the strong flavor you typically get with a cooking grade sherry.

I scaled this for 30 and we had it at a work party. I could hardly taste the sherry or mint, so I would use more next time!

Fabulous and refreshing!
A nice change from boring fruit salads.
