Excellent marinade, and it really did cut down on the gamey flavor. I grilled it over charcoal and finished it in the oven.

I have been looking for the perfect marinade and I think I found it. This was perfect for my lamb ribs that I marinaded then put in the over for 45 minutes then transferred to the grill for another 20 minutes. Ribs turned out perfect and juicy. Nice crust from the marinade. I will be using this marinade for my ribs, rib roast and prime rib.
