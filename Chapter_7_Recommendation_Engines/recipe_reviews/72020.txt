This was great!  I used 2 cans of pears and just used the juice from the cans rather than buying pear juice.  Also, 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon was plenty.  I think it would be way overpowering with 2 Tbsp.  I also seasoned the pork chops with salt and pepper.  Delicious!

It was pretty good, but only because I added lots more sugar.  The 2 tablespoons of cinnamon should probably be 2 teaspoons.

Tried this recipe because I wanted something different.  Excellent, we LOVED it, and it's sooo easy.  (If you cook down the pear sauce, it makes a great Pear Butter, spread it on toast).

Loved this recipe. I made the pear sauce (1/2 TBS of cinnamon and apple cider vinegar instead of pear juice) and just cooked it down and smashed the pears (didn't use the blender) so it was slightly chunky- and delicious. I used one thick cut boneless pork chop and divided it between two people, added sauce when serving (with brown rice). It was declared 'restaurant worthy' (highest honor for an experimental recipe (!). Pork was not dry, sauce added to it tremendously.

Wow...sweet is right! I LIKE that the grainy texture of the pear is maintained in the sauce....and that's about it. This was one-dimentional, overly sweet, had no acidity for balance (the lemon juice was non-existant), and even after cutting the cinnamon in 1/2, the only thing I could taste was pear & cinnamon, not even the pork chop. The sauce was so thick & sweet I'll be using it as pear butter on toast for the next few mornings so it won't go to waste. My remaining pork chops will be put to better use in any dish but this. IF I were to attempt this again, I'd cut the brown sugar to 1tbsp, omit the pear juice & use water or white wine instead, cut the cinnamon to 1tsp, and use a thicker pork chop. But really, I don't think it's worth all the effort; this one is not for me.

Too me this recipe was just okay. I made this recipe with a few changes. First of all, I used 2 little Delmonte pear cups and the juice from them, instead of using fresh pears and buying pear juice. Second, I did not puree the pear mixture, as I like the texture of the whole little pears instead. I put 1 tablespoon of cinnamon in it and it was way too overpowering and gave it a gritty taste.  Next time I will definitely add the cinnamon by "to taste", not buy these measurements. Also, my mixture was thickened in 20 minutes; it didn't take 30 minutes like the recipe said. Overall, it had a good flavor. This can also be done with apples if you do not like pears.

This has to seriously be the BEST pork chop recipe I have ever had! It was incredible and truly easy to make. I seasoned the chops with some season salt before frying them. The meal was intensley  delectable!

A nice change from the usual pork recipes. A few changes though. I used canned pears, instead of fresh pears. And I cut the amount of cinnamon in half. Instead of frying the pork chops, I grilled them.

The pear sauce was delicious and I would make it again. I would, however, probably come up with a marinade and broil the pork next time. It was just too dry this way.

I tried this recipe tonight and I was pleasantly surprised. I usually like my pork chops spicy, but this recipe was the change I needed. The only thing I changed was to use fresh squeezed orange juice instead of the pear juice. (I forgot it on my shopping list) I will use the pear sauce with other dishes.

We thought this was delicious. I did not have pear juice so substituted orange juice and it worked out fine, but the pear juice probably would have made it even better.  NOTE:  I wonder if there is a misprint in the recipe.  We love cinnamon and I used only 1 Tblsp. and it was more than enough.  Suggest taste test before adding 2 Tblsp.  Will definitely make when we have extra pears.

I won't be making this again. Made it for myself and my 4 kids (ages 11, 8, 5, and 2). No one really liked it that much. The pear sauce would have been good but that is way too much cinnamon. It made it taste very gritty and over powered the pears. Good concept but it didn't even look very yummy on the plate.

This recipe was amazing! My roommates and girlfriend were blown away by the flavor. I used thick pork chops that take a lot longer to fry though. I also doubled the pear sauce and used both apple juice and pear juice. I didn't use quite the amount of cinnamon in the recipe either.

Fab-U-lous! I didn't have pear juice, so I subbed some 'Pom' pomegranate juice and a splash of honey. I also tenderized the chops. Perfect for the holiday season-even our picky 8 year old chomped it away!

This rating comes with 2 changes to this dish. First use only 2 teaspoons of cinnamon not 2 tablespoons! 2 tablespoons of cinnamon is way to strong of a cinnamon flavor. Secondly,  this is my husband's & my personal opinion, we make pear chutney not pear sauce. We feel that it taste better that way. So go ahead and enjoy this dish as we do.

Awesome!  I didn't have pears on hand, so I substituted fruit cocktail with the cherries removed. There were NO LEFTOVERS! I added extra lemon juice to taste as I made it as it was a bit sweet.  Plus, I added more cinnamon than the recipe noted.

I used the sauce from this recipe on ham instead of pork chops and it was also good for that form of the meat. As other reviewers have noted, half the cinnamon was adequate. It reminded me bit of apple butter, but definitely had the pear taste.
