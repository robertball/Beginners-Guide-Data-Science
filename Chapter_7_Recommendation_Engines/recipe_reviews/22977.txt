This was the biggest hit of Christmas!  I just varied slightly from the recipe however.  After baking the nuts, I sprinkled a mix of sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon over them to give them even more flavor.  Also, just a tip...coat your cookie sheet with foil...a lot simpler clean up!

Delicious and easy to make. I baked them for closer to 30 minutes, and they are great. You could add a dash of cinnamon for a different flavor. I'm making these for holiday gift baskets.

Very easy, very tasty.  I added a little cinnamon and used them in a delicious summer salad of lettuce, dried cranberries, fresh blueberries, mandarin slices, gorgonzola cheese, and poppy seed dressing.  Yummy!!!!!

I couldn't stop eating these walnuts! Instead of using butter, I coated the walnuts with butter-flavored baking spray. They still taste great.

I love how these walnuts tasted.  They reminded me of the sweet walnuts we use to buy at the fair when we lived in Germany.  I didn't have any butter so I used margarine instead and they still tasted great.

I didn't see this recipe until after I did the walnuts  using the Sugar Coated Pecan recipe. Later I used this recipe. I liked using the pecan recipe better. I think the 350 degree oven made the walnuts taste not quit as good.

I did the microwave for about 5 minutes, then popped in the oven for about 10 to get them truly roasted.  Amazing served on a salad with dried cranberries.

A bit too sweet for my liking.  They didn't leave the appetizer table very quickly.  In fact, I still have half the recipe left!

Pretty darn good. Reduced the recipe in half and added a tiny bit of cinnamon. Used the walnuts on top of a salad.

I had a lot of walnuts that were unsalted, so I wanted to give them some flavor. The walnuts tasted very good after I used this recipe. The mixture did get burned on the sides of the cookie sheet, so if you have an oven that's hotter than usual, I'd suggest cooking them for less time.

They turned out great after 10 mins, but I put them in for 10 more and they burned. My whole kitchen was in smoke. But other than that - great recipe for candied walnuts - I will give it another try with less cook time. Going to use them for salads.

I made these as an embellishment to a dessert.  These were simple to make and had wonderful flavor.  The roasted walnut flavor is prominent with just a hint of sweetness in the coating.  I can’t stop eating them so they may never see that dessert.
