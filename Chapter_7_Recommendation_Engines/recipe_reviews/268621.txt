I was pleased with this recipe and will make it again.  It's crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  The entire family liked this new recipe!

Amazing flourless recipe. The cookies were easy to make and tasted great! I really liked the fudgy brownie-like texture. Toasting the pecans were key in making these, and chopping them up fine-- if you are not a nut person, you can just skip this step altogether.  Overall, this an amazing recipe that will be my go-to flourless cookie recipe.

Very very good cookies! Addictive!  Rich, delicious flavor.


Be careful how big your eggs are.... we wasted 2 batches & $13 after figuring out we used the cage free eggs that are much larger than regular eggs & that kept the batter from cooking & spreading.  
Was a HUGE disappointment as we were REALLY excited to make these again!

It was delicious and very well executed but I think you should use a little bit of coco powder In the mix to give it the beautiful chocolate taste itâ€™s missing

I made these cookies for a small party, and all the cookies were devoured. People said they taste like a crunchy brownie. I will definitely make these little chocolate delights again.

I did add some chocolate nibs to the recipe and would absolutely make them again. Great recipe!
