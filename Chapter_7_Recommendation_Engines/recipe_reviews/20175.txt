These just turned out wonderful.  I used some of the tricks I read and they were perfect.  I added two tsp of cinnamon and I put the egg in the measuring cup then added 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half cream and the dough consistency was perfect.  I added raisins and almonds to mine.  When I took the dough from the bowl, it was crumbly, but I was able to easly mold it into a dough ball and flatten it and cut it into about 12 good size scones.  I also added a bit of lemon zest.... If people had dough that was too wet, they really need to try putting the egg in the measuring cup first, then adding the milk.  If you want quick easy scones, this recipe is for you!!! I will make again.

Wow, these scones were really good!  This was the first time I ever made scones, but not my boyfriend- he gave me a really good tip: see, I was confused and thought that I was supposed to add the entire egg/ milk mixture to the dough, but instead, he said to just add enough of it so that the dough be moistened (We only used about half of the egg/ milk mixture).  Oh yeah, and you have to add it only a little bit at a time, and work the dough each time after you add it.  That way, you can tell how moistened it is.  I know this is what the recipe says to do, but what i THOUGHT the directions said was to add the whole mixture and keep mixing until it was moistened.  It was good the way my boyfriend taught me to do it.  We added enough cinamin so that the dough was a very very light brown. We added to the dough BEFORE we put the egg/ milk in.

Very light and absolutely DELICIOUS!  I used about 1/4 cup of half-n-half and 3/4 cup of milk.  I also recommend using the food processor to combine the flour mixture and butter.  I put 1/2 of the flour mixture into the processor at a time and just used a light pulse to incorporate the butter into the flour.  I then put the butter and flour mixture into a large bowl and stirred in the egg mixture.  One thing that I don't recommend is using the drop method for these scones.  The texture was much better when I added a little more flour to roll out, then kneaded a couple times and patted down into a circle and made scone wedges.  Happy baking!!

Wonderful! I've added fresh chopped cranberries and orange zest/juice.Orange glaze. I've made pumpkin scones with cinnamon glaze. Every altered recipe using this base has been a hit. To avoid dough being too wet I crack the egg in the measuring cup first, then measure to one cup milk or half & half over the egg. Seems to come out perfect.

A+++ We made orange cranberry scones and they turned out delicious.  I just wish they lasted longer, they managed to disappear really fast. Instead of 1 cup milk, We added 1/2 cup fresh OJ, 1/3 cup milk and added cranberries (dried sweetened or fresh cooked in sugar)then glazed them with an OJ/powdered sugar glaze. They were great!

AMAZING!  These scones are fantastic, and they're so easy to make.  I've made them twice in the last twenty four hours, and got rave reviews each time.  I added vanilla and two teaspoons cinnamon, because cinnamon rocks, and some walnuts.  Also, I sprinkled brown sugar on top, but these are all personal preferences.  They were great the first time when I followed the recipe exactly.  Enjoy!

Very simple recipe.  I cut the butter down to 1/2 c. and froze it first then grated it into the flour mixture.  It's easier to work with that way. I used 3 tsp. of baking powder, 1 tsp. of baking soda, and 1 tsp. of cream of tartar. I also used half and half instead of milk.  I did half plain and half with raisins.

I come from England, and haven't eaten scones since moving to America.  I have looked for a while for a recipe and this one sounded the closest to how I remember my mother making them.  I have to say, they were delicious.  The taste and texture were exactly how I remembered.  Traditionally in UK, scones are round like American biscuits, so I used a biscuit cutter to make them and ended up with double the yield as a result.  I also added raisins, which is a common variation in UK.  They can be enjoyed as they are or cut in half with jam and/or butter, but the best way to eat them is with jam and cream!  If they are made correctly, they are certain to stick to the roof of your mouth as you eat them so it's always a good idea to have a drink with them - preferably, steaming cup of English tea!
All in all, an excellent recipe.  Very simple to follow and with delicious results.

I needed an English dish to take to a multi-cultural food tasting party at my daughter's school.  I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  When I made the trial batch, my kids said, "Oooh!  Let's make these all the time!"  That was enough convincing for me to make them for my daughter's class.  I served them with strawberry jelly and hot tea, and they were a hit!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Is it a biscuit? A pancake? I don't know, but it sure isn't a scone. I kinda enjoyed these biscuits with a pancakey flavor. Unfortunately no one else (including the dog) agreed with me. Everyone took one bite and that was it. And like many other reviewers, I too, had to add a lot more flour than the recipe calls for. I was disappointed with this recipe.

These are definitely some amazing scones! They have an incredibly light and fluffy, almost biscuit-like texture, with the sweet buttery taste of shortbread. I cubed the butter and then used a pastry cutter to cut it into the dry ingredients till it made "pea-shaped" crumbs, per usual. Followed the advice to put the egg into a measuring cup and then add milk to the 1 cup line. I used milk (not the cream that other reviewers suggested) and thought the consistency was perfectly fine. I split the dough into two halves, adding 1/2 cup dried cranberries to one half and 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the other, then stirred these ingredients into the dough. Turned each half out onto a generously floured surface, sprinkled the ball of dough with flour and patted it down into a circle 1/2 inch thick. I did not knead the dough and did not find it necessary, because I am 100% satisfied with texture of the finished product. Each half made 8 scones. As I always do with scones, I brushed the tops with eggwhites and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar mixture before putting them in the oven -- it's a delicious final touch!

Great recipe. I have made this multiple times with the following changes to make cranberry-orange scones:  Instead of 1 egg and 1 cup milk, I use 1 egg with 1/3 cup milk and 2/3 cup fresh orange juice. I add the entire amount or almost the entire amount of this liquid a little at a time. I also add two tablespoons of a good orange marmalade that has lots of rind pieces in it, plus 1/2 bag of Craisins (3 oz as the bag is 6 oz). I barely knead the dough at all, and just roller it out into the 1/2-inch thick round once the ingredients are well mixed. Before I put them in the oven, I brush on a mixture of powdered sugar and orange juice (made into a paste and lightly brushed on top). They never fail me and are so good as they are, I haven't branched out into other flavor combos yet.   P.S. I don't have a stand mixer, and have added the butter two different ways: cutting the butter into small pieces and adding the pieces a little at a time, stirring them in, which resulted in a crustier, bumpier scone; and I have also softened the butter in the microwave, then mixed it into a soft paste and put it in the freezer for a few minutes to "re-cool". Then I mixed it in the batter that way to save time. The scones came out less craggy and a little smoother, but tasted the same. So depending on how you want them to look, the texture you want, or the time you have, these are two options that worked for me.

People! These scones are absolutely perfect and that is coming from an English Girl like myself... Many people request them and they are so quick to make!

People have said that they add ALL the milk mixture! Don't do it! You'll end up with a sloppy mess... just add a little bit until the mixture reaches a good doughy consistency that is firm and can be kneaded well).

In true english style eat hot with plenty of cholesterol raising butter and clotted cream and strawberry jam... heaven!

Please please please fix the mistake on this recipe. There is way too much baking powder in this and it comes out caustic. Use one quarter of the baking powder and you have a good recipe. I baked mine in my new scone pan (with a quarter of the baking powder) and they turned out great. Using all the baking powder they have listed make these scones unedible!!

I never made a scone in my life (in fact I don't do all that much baking beyond cookies and an occasional cake). We had just returned from a trip to Ireland and scones were on the breakfast menu everywhere we went. When we got home my wife was lamenting that she missed the scones so I thought I would give it a whirl.

The dough is sticky and tough to work with and I thought I screwed up the recipe, but man these were as good as any we had across the pond! Thanks for sharing. I'll be making these again.

This has become my go-to recipe for scones, they have the lightness and texture that I really love.  And you can mix in practically anything: so far, for sweet scones I have made blueberry & cream cheese, strawberry & cream cheese, chocolate chip, cinnamon chip, raspberry, blackberry, currant, and banana.  For savory scones I omitted the sugar and made cheddar & chive, cheddar & jalapeno, Italian sausage, bell pepper & mozzarella, and even curry chicken (yes!).  The savory scones go perfectly with a bowl of soup.  I highly recommend this scone recipe, but at the same time I urge you to try your own flavor combinations, this recipe is very forgiving and takes anything you throw at it.

Wonderful!  I had some fresh strawberries to use and wanted to make something different.  I just sliced them up and made fresh strawberry scones.  They were great plain, and with strawberry jam.  Blueberry would be great as well.  Will definately make again!

These are so good!! Very light and moist. I added zest of one medium lemon, 3 tablespoons of orange juice, fresh cranberries, raisins, and pecans, and they got rave reviews!I took the advice of one review that suggested measuring the milk into a cup with the egg in it so the batter wouldn't be too liquidy. Superb!

Easy recipe, however the texture was not correct for a scone.  It was more of a cake, I'll be using a different recipe next time.

Great scones thanks! My 3 yr old poured all of the milk/egg mixture in at once so it was too wet and I had to add an extra 3/4 cup flour to absorb it all but they still worked well. I added sultanas too. I don't know why Americans shape their scones into wedges...being Australian, I have always known them to be round in shape ( I cut mine out with an empty can) and they are traditionally served with butter, strawberry jam (preserves) and whipped fresh cream and ALWAYS alongside a cup of freshly brewed hot tea. This is popular everywhere here in Australia and is known as Devonshire Tea. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be freezing them and taking them to a brunch on the weekend.

Great base recipe - I added candied Ginger and toasted Pecans - then coated with a ginger glaze - what a sweet (but not too) treat.  Thanks for posting!

What did I do wrong? They looked great and smelled good, but tasted too strongly of baking soda.

I made these according to the directions, but did the egg & milk measuring cup trick that other reviewers talked about. I also added a little vanilla and fresh strawberries too...so delish! I will be making these again experimenting with other extra ingredients :)

Oh....My....Gosh!  These are so yummy, I just wish they weren't all fat :-(  I guess that's why they're so great though, huh?  I added cinnamon and orange juice with a little orange zest, and they came out wonderful.  I was a little worried about the reviewers that stated 5 tsp of baking powder was too much, and I surely do value my tooth enamel, so I compromised with 4 tbs, and followed yet anothers suggestion to add the egg to the measuring cup and then enough liquids to make 1 cup.  It ended up being about 1/3 c of orange juice and 1/2 c of milk.  The dough was a little sticky, but if you knead gently and use a little extra flour on your hands they come out just fine.  Made 16 scone sized scones, not sure how big the submitter likes her scones, but 8 would be mighty big, like a big scone muffin.  I will make these again and again!  Thanks!

Love this recipe! I did use some of the tips from other reviewers and used just enough milk to make one cup with the egg. I aso added some raisins. The last time I made these, I actually put 5 scones in the fridge because there wasn't enough space on the baking stone and baked them the next day and they came out perfectly. I normally cut out the scones using a  cookie cutter and I get about 12 scones. Delicious with butter and a good quality jam!

I found these scones incredibly easy to make. I added quarter of a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and an eighth of a cup shredded red bell pepper and made savory dinner scones. They were light, flaky, and rose beautifully. More significantly, three people ate the whole plate of them that night!

This is a great recipe, very versatile and easy to make.  I definately cut the dough into smaller wedges to get more scones, just cutting them into 8 makes for very large scones and if you're making them to have with other foods, all you need is small wedges.

I thought these were really good. However I made the following changes that made these DEE-LISH!!
- I used a biscuit cutter and cut them out rather than cutting into wedges (made 26 biscuits)
- I topped them off with brown sugar before they went in the oven (so both the top and the bottom of the scone has a crunchy texture)
- Baked for only 12-13 minutes
- Cut them in half and put a strawberry rhubarb jam onto both sides

= DEE-LISH, a must try!! Don't forget the cup of tea on the side!!

Awesome. Use the frozen butter method where you grate it into the dry ingredients. Works awesome and saves a lot of "cutting". Made this many times with many variations. Thanks for the recipe.

This dough was way too sticky to roll out or knead.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to use all of the milk/egg mixture?  It was a mess.

these scones are great! They actually took me 25 minutes to bake, but came out light and fluffy. i was suprised at how much they rose. I added raisins and cinnamon and sprinkled the scones with a little bit of cinnamon sugar. These are great.

I was looking for a basic scone recipe I could alter with a variety of added ingredients.... AND I FOUND IT! Basically, all suggestions were very good except for those complaining about too much BAKING SODA!  My suggestion to them would be: " READ THE INGREDIENTS CAREFULLY - It is Baking Powder, not Baking Soda!" No wonder they gave the recipe such bad reviews.

Delicious! I made a few modifications. Instead of 3/4 C butter, I used 1/4 C butter and 1/4 C olive oil and it lead to the perfect consistency. I also used 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C half and half. Finally, I brushed the top of the scones with egg before putting in the oven with gave them a shiny browned top. Then I decided to make a glaze with some confectioners sugar, almond extract, and a dash of milk. These paired great with coffee!

just made these for our "royal wedding" party tomorrow. I couldnt believe how easy they were to make. I put the egg & 1 tsp vanilla then enough milk to make one cup. The dough was perfect. I split the dough and made 1/2 with mini choc chips and 1/2 with frozen blueberries.  I was very impressed when I opened the oven. they were beautiful & delicious. This is a keeper.

Always better to have fresh scones. I've made this several times. If you are like me and don't have a pastry cutter, a fork works well, or you can cut the butter in to small slices or chunks and then work with a fork. This recipe is scones made simple.

I've made these three or four times, adding different flavors each time, and with a small adjustment they came out perfectly. The first time they tasted a little dry, (my boyfriend and I like things a little more moist) so I added a tablespoon of sour cream when I added the butter, and they came out prefect and moist.

Excellent! I made them with blueberries and white chocolate chips.  Then glazed them with an orange glaze.  I did have to add more flour since I used all the milk-egg mixture.  I added the white chocolate chips while stirring, but waited to add the blueberries until I was rolling it out.  After rolling it out I spinkled the blueberries on the top and gently pressed them into the dough, then I folded it in half and rolled it out again, repeating the same process.  I cut it into the 8 wedges as directed.  They were HUGE!  I made the glaze with powdered sugar, orange zest and fresh squeezed orange juice.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum!  Made these this afternoon so we can have them with a pot of tea while we're watching the Royal Wedding tomorrow morning at 5 a.m.  I made the recipe exactly as written and the only change I'd make in future is to reduce the amount of sugar by a couple of tablespoons.  Thanks for a great scone recipe!  (Oops, forgot to note in my review that I also made the scones half the size so the recipe made twice as many - wouldn't want them any larger - and I cut them into circles instead of wedges.)

These scones are excellent! I added about 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and the zest of one orange to the dough. I also topped them with an orange icing. They were the best scones I have ever had. They were very tender, flavorful and very impressive looking. I have plans to make them again soon and am excited to try more flavor combinations.

5 teaspoons is Tooooo muuuuch  baaaaking pooowder!  

These scones, unlike the traditional, slightly heavy Irish recipe, float into the air when you aren't looking.

Also, I might note that the scones have a slightly caustic flavor that could damage one's tooth enamel.  

I strongly suggest halving the amount of baking powder, or even quartering it.  At present, this comes out like a cake.

Seems like everyone else has been getting decent results with these, but I don't seem to be getting the same results. Made this twice, first time there was an overwhelming chemical taste from the baking soda, but I chocked that up to maybe me needing to get a new box. After getting a brand new box I tried again. The chemical taste was still there, not as strong, but certainly noticeable. If I ever try these again (and that's a big if) I certainly will not put in as much baking soda as specified in the recipe.

Fantastic!  This recipe has a lovely, flaky texture similar to a biscuit; not very sweet; it's a great carrier for additions to suit your taste.  Although, I measured the liquid to 1 cup with the egg in the measuring cup first, the dough was very wet.  Next time I may use less liquid, but the scones were so delicious!  Used fresh cranberries, toasted nuts, lemon/orange zest, half&half and sprinkled sugar on top prior to baking and then dusted it with confectioner sugar, while hot out of the oven.  Needed to bake for 20 minutes.  It's fabulous straight out of the freezer without warming.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Donna!

I made these exactly to recipe.  They baked up beautifully and looked great, but they had a real bitter taste.  I don't know if it was too much baking powder or what.  I may try again with less baking powder.  5 t sounds like a lot.

these scones are delicious! I added some lemon juice and vanilla to the egg/milk mixture, and then added that to the flour mixture until the dough was moist. I rolled it out, cut it into smaller pieces than what this recipe called for--about half the size. Then I let them sit in my refrigerator for the night, and cooked them the next day. While still warm, I topped them with Lemon Icing. They were so delicious! Will make again!

Excellent. The only reason I didn't 5 star this recipe is that a little better explanation is needed for those who haven't made biscuits/scones before and need guidance on the addition of the liquid ingredients.   It does make marvelous scones!  a hint: If it doesn't rise enough, be sure your baking powder is fresh.

I don't know what I did wrong but the scones took so much longer to bake than the recipe called for. They started to burn on the edges but still were not done in the middle. They were okay warm from the oven but not so good later. I will try this recipe again because I can see itnis a good one. It must be me that is making it a mess!

I just made this recipe to the letter. I grated chilled butter rather than cut it in, but used the exact same proportions. A little sweet but very tasty. I'd make it again with Lemon Zest. A keeper recipe. Very easy to make. The key as always is to handle the dough as little as possible. I made nine 2.5 inch circular scones.

Tasty! I made these instead of my normal scones, because I had no sour cream. Also, had to use margarine because I was out of butter. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and these came out delicious.

This was a soft, buttery and fluffy biscuit.  While very good in its own right, I would definitely not call it a scone.  Scones are drier and saltier.  Also, this makes 8 huge scone shaped biscuits.

The texture of these scones is good, but there are better tasting scone recipes on this site. I found the recipe yielded 8 very large scones or 12 reasonable size scones.

These were great after following suggestions from fellow reviewers: Definitely add the egg to the measuring cup before the milk. I also added 2 tsp ground cinnamon, some orange zest, and subbed 1/2 the milk for fresh OJ. I added some dried cranberries, and topped off with a mixture of finely chopped pecans, brown sugar, cinnamon and a little melted butter - Scrumptious!!

Madly in love with this recipe.  It's very flexible -- Even though I halved the recipe and reduced the butter and sugar content, it still came out marvelous.  As someone had suggested, I grated the butter into the flour and then just hand kneaded it a bit.  To add flavor, i threw it chocolate chips and flour dusted banana chunks.  Baked in my oven for 20 minutes to make the outside a bit more crisp.  Scrumptious!  Thank you!

These never fail!  I usually make them plain and serve with butter and jam, but I threw in 1 Tbs orange zest and some cranberries into a batch for Christmas Eve brunch today. Topped them with an orange juice/powdered sugar icing and they are delicious.

To respond to those below who complained about stickiness: Knead the dough on a well-floured surface until it gets to the point where it can be rolled out easily (keep adding more flour until it gets there). Then, sprinkle a little more flour on the top, smooth it out with your hand and roll it out with a rolling pin. That should work.

I make this all the time and they are hit each time.  I serve them with cream and warm jams.  Before baking, I fold each triangle twice, so my scones are thick and moist in the middle.

Very yummy!  I used past suggestions and used 1 egg with enough milk added to make 1 cup, which worked well.  The dough was crumbly in the bowl, but came together with a little kneading.  Be sure to use chilled butter, which gives it the right texture.  This time, I added 2t cinnamon and some cinnamon chips.  I'll also try lemon blueberry, and clotted cream with jam.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've used this recipe numerous times. I always brush with milk and sprinkle sugar on the tops just before placing in the oven. I like them with a little vanilla added to the liquids. It gives them a little something extra. My kids love these, either plain or with some butter and sometimes with jam. Definitely a hit in our home!

These are delicious, especially when they a still warm.  The dough was super soft and sticky, but 1 or 2 Tbsp of flour brought it together just enough to form a round.  Light and airy, lightly sweet, they're even good without any toppings

Very tasty in the end but I had to add quite a bit more flour to be able to knead and roll out the dough. It was way too sticky with all that milk. However after altering that slightly they came out beautifully and I got 16 scones from it not 8!!

Fabulous scones!  Several friends declared them the best scones they had ever had.  I make them exactly as written, adding all of the milk and egg mixture.  I don't alter the recipe even though I am at 4600 feet. I also add about 1-2 cups chopped apricots to the mixture.   I top them with a pureed apricot/butter/powdered sugar glaze.  Delicious!

Great recipe!  I added 2 Tbs of cinnamon and 2 chopped gala apples and used 1/4 cup half and half and 3/4 cup milk.  They are ENORMOUS once baked so I may cut them into smaller pieces next time.

Just took these out of the oven and well, ok, I didn't follow the recipe *exactly*... but oh my goodness!  No eggs, so I used 1/3 c. applesauce and the rest milk to make a cup, added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (the recipe will stand even more!) and... a scant cup of chocolate chips.  MMMMM!

This was my first time making scones and I was a little leery at first because I've had some scones from bakeries that were really dry. These were AMAZING! And I can't wait to play around with them and making different kinds. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this recipe and will be making them regularly.  My husband often stops by Tim Horton's (well known coffee/donut/baked goods store mainly in Canada) in the morning for something similar and spends a few dollars/day.  He tried these and said they are better.  (What he may not know is that Tim Horton's aren't baked fresh, but warmed from frozen product).  I followed the recipe exactly with only 2 additions - added 1 cup of Craisins and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and they turned out amazing.  Will be making more soon.  I had no idea how quick and simple it was to make these and now we can save some money by making them at home.

Today I was hosting my daughter's home school 'Girl's Book Club', and at the last minute went looking for a recipe for scones (having never made them before).  This recipe was the first one I saw with lots of reviews and nearly 5 stars, simple and quick, so I gave it a whirl.  I followed the directions exactly, using only milk and, WOW!!  It was so easy, so fast & incredibly yummy...EVERY person who tried it raved - and there were 18 people!  We had them with strawberry jam and raspberry tea, and they were a HUGE hit!  Next time I plan to add cranberries & orange zest...maybe even tomorrow - they're THAT good!   Thanks so much for posting this incredible recipe - it will definitely be used often at our house!

Super easy! First time ever making scones and they turned out great.  As other users suggested I only used about 3/4 of the egg/milk mixture so the dough didn't get too wet.  I also added 2 t cinnamon and 1t vanilla, rolled out, cut into wedges then sprinkled with brown sugar and almonds before baking.  It turned out delicious!

This recipe bombed completely and I'm not sure where I went wrong.  When I turned out the dough on my floured service the dough was almost beyond wet.  Ended up adding an additional 1/2 cup of flour and still had a gooey sloppy paste.  No wedges for me, I scooped the dough on my baking sheet with a spoon. Baked for about 16 minutes and ended up with clumpy absolutely delicious scones.  Light, moist with that great butter mouth feel.  Excellent results from what I thought would be an absolute disaster.  I'm a bread baker and I weigh everything with a scale so all my ratios were correct.  Anyway these are now called Bomb Scones in my cookbook and they're keepers.

Be careful when moistening the dough, if you over do it you'll be peeling dough off of yourself and your kitchen for hours! I know other reviewers already mentioned this but it's worth mentioning again: Add the milk/egg mixture in very slowly mixing in between.   Other than that, these came out WONDERFUL and I'm sure I'll make them over and over again. I have all kinds of ideas for making these even better!!

A little too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll reduce the sugar by half and see how that goes. I had to bake mine a bit longer than 15 minutes.

Fantastic base recipe for scones that is very easy to customize and add to; my roommates loved it and finished off a batch within 1 night!   I followed another reader's advice to crack and beat the egg in a measuring cup and then add the liquid ingredients to 1 cup. For liquid ingredients, I have added varying amounts of orange juice, milk, vanilla extract, and almond extract (generally more orange juice than milk, and roughly 0.5-1tsp of extract) I also added cranberries and sliced almonds. Have also added chocolate chips on another occasion for a sweeter scone.

I found this recipe years ago and have used it ever since.  It is highly customizable, and I use it make scone flavors from Lemon Poppyseed to Molasses Peppermint to Cardamom to Apricot Almond.  It always gets rave reviews.  Make sure to be precise with the measurements and DON'T add extra flour.  If you must add flour, use as little extra as possible and on the outside of the dough ball only.

Came out quite well! I used an egg substitute 'cause I'm lazy and was out of eggs, and it worked perfectly. The bottoms burned a little, so maybe next time I'd turn the heat down a touch.

This is a great recipe to embellish with! I added dried cherries(soaked for a short time in warm water to soften), white chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Then I used an ice cream scoop to put them on the baking sheet with parchment. Quick simple and yummy. Great with a good cup of tea.

This is a great recipe! I didn't know that scones could be moist, but these are and they are delicious.   I always use soy milk in this recipe without a problem. I also tried this recipe without egg once and the scones were slightly more crumbly but still great.   In the future I might try using a little less butter, just to cut down on the calories a little (and they can be rather buttery). But remember to treat these like biscuits and keep the butter chunky in the dough, so they don't get tough.  My sweety likes his with chocolate chips and I like mine with crazins, so as soon as I turn the dough out onto the counter, I split it in two and knead chocolate chips into half the dough and cranberries into the other half. And voila, we have Choco-sconos and Crazy Scones.

Yum!  I measured the 3/4 cup butter in a cup rather than using the 1/4 c measurements on the stick of butter. I think i used a lot less butter this way and they were still abosolutely delicious. Best U.S recipe for english scones so far.

I'm 15. And i wanted to cook something with few ingredients. I found this recipe and was psyched. The first time i made these I added much to much of the Egg/Milk mixture (very sticky) and they came out very odd looking but tasted great. Since then i have modified the amount I add and they come out Uber sexy. This is my favorite scone recipe ever!

I made this and I didn't have any eggs.  Made these without the egg and they are so good with or without the egg.  I made half a batch plain and the other half orange (used orange juice instead of milk and added some orange zest, then made a powdered sugar glaze with orange zest and orange extract.)

Great recipe!  Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the tips about only adding enough egg/milk mixture to moisten till after.  I thought I was supposed to add it all, so the dough was very sticky.  I was able to adjust everything and they came out very good.  Rookie mistake.  They'll be perfect next time!

Hands down, this is the simplest and the best basic recipe for scones.  Light, flavorful, and not dry.  This is the recipe to start with and add your own creative touch.  Thank you for an outstanding recipe.

Wonderful scones!  I did just the plain flavor the first time so I could see how they were as is!  I did have to add a tad bit extra flour, and I subbed turbinado sugar for the white sugar, and also subbed 1 cup of the flour for wheat flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness, this is the best recipe! My little girls and I just finished making and eating these and we just loved them. Quick, easy and no weird ingredients that you have to run to the market to get. We made the chocolate chip/sour cream variation suggested by another reviewer and it was truly great. I will be proud to take these to our potluck brunch!! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

This is my first time baking scones and they were awesome. Although I read the suggestions in some of the reviews, I decided to stick to the recipe the first time.  I'm glad I did.  I had no problem with sticky dough after kneeding it on a floured board.  I did sprinkle some sugar on top before baking just for presentation.  I served them with butter and honey, but they were so good we ended up eating them plain.

These were good. I added brown sugar, vanilla, and raisins to this. I just thought they needed to be a tad more sweet.

This was an awesome recipe.  I used 1/2 cup sour cream to replace 1/2 of the milk for an added zing.  I added 1 cup chocolate chips. I mix the dough in ,y kitchen-aid mixer and add additional flour as needed. Remove the mix from my mixer...flour my hands and pat the dough to form a disc on my ungreased baking pan.  I pat it down evenly.  I have found this helps with yielding more scones. My family loves this recipe!Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I added 2 tsp. almond extract and about 1 cup crushed sliced almonds.  I also use half whole wheat flour so I increased the sugar just a little.  I also used vanilla soy milk and brushed the tops with egg-wash and put some sliced almonds on top.  I also used the drop method.  They turned out great!

These were very biscuity and delicious.  The only problem is, as many people said, the dough was extremely sticky.  Following some people's advice  I only added a half cup of milk, and then after kneading the dough I added more milk by the teaspoon to achieve a good consistency.  Delicious! My mother loves scones so I made half a batch with blueberries and half with chocolate chips and they were devoured within an hour.

I wish I could give this a higher rating but it is not what I expected. They are very good...but very cake like. They were fairly basic to prepare however not the scone I was expecting. I added chocolate chips to half, and without them it was very plain. Not bad, not great.

This is another good scone recipe.  It bakes up really light and fluffy and rises well.  I added an egg wash to the top to make the tops golden and crispy.  It's not as white as the other recipe I tried but the taste is about the same.  I got 12 good sized scones out of one recipe.  I will make these again too.

This was my first time making scones.  I added  1 cup fresh cranberries, 3/4 cup fine chopped almonds, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tbs dried orange rind.  I tossed the cranberries with about 1/4 cup sugar before adding to the dough.  I am very pleased with the results.

Great Recipe!! I love Dunkin Donuts scones and these were perfect. I made two rounds (16 scones) making one round with chocolate chips... these were gone almost before they were out of the oven! And the second batch I made with dried cranberries that I moistened and seasoned with cinnamon, brown sugar, and nutmeg. I also sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top before baking. I did find the oven too hot, making the edges crispy and the center too gooey. So I just lowered the oven temp to 375 and baked them for 5 extra minutes. 5 stars!

I don't know why some reviewers seemed so upset with the amount of baking powder in this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and they came out wonderfully.  I didn't roll them out, though, I just sort of dropped them in clumps and flattened them a little.  They didn't taste caustic, and I used just as much baking powder as was called for.
I added about 2 cups of raisins (for double recipe) and they were soooo good! 
Thanks for a great recipe, will use this again!

Fabulous! Sweet, light & moist scone. I did not have to add all of the milk to make it moist enough to pat out. We ate these with blue bonnnet spread & homemade chokecherry jelly, just wonderful! My kids ate 2 each!! Next time I better make a double batch lol

I made these for a tea I was hosting.  They turned out moist and light.  Perfect.  In fact I had a friend from England who makes them all the time and requested the recipe.  I used half and half and made some with blueberries and cranberries.  Wonderful!  Thank you.

These tasted ok, but what a sticky mess they were to make!  More of a batter 
than a dough.  I had to drop them on to the baking sheet, as it was impossible
to cut the gooey pile into wedges as the recipe instructs.  I probably won't 
make these again.

These scones were great -- light and flaky and came out perfectly golden.  I used half and half, as others have suggested.

Fabulous! Bakery shop quality in your own oven.  I use half and half rather than the skim milk which is our household staple.  I have used this recipe with a variey of additions:  dried cranberries, currants, even grated cheddar.  Wonderful texture even when day old.  A favorite.

These are the most moist scones!  I cut the sugar to 1/3 C, 1 C frozen blueberries and substituted margarine for butter, but it still tasted like a scone.  The crunchy outside and tender inside is a nice treat!

I made these scones for the first time today WOW!  I have to say Jillian thx for the idea of grating the butter in that is the best tip I think I've heard in eons! I made cinnamon and raisin scones yummy! I also used all half and half.... I have noticed in other recipes that where I used 1/2,1/2 instead of milk that breads where light and fluffy same here! Try it in corn bread!  One other step I did was an egg wash just before baking to give it that really nice brown look.  I am now hooked! Thank you Donna!

I have now made these twice.  The first time I followed the recipe using the suggestions of cinnamon and the food processor method of pulsing 1/2 the flour mixture with 1/2 butter and repeating.  I also heeded the advice to add the liquid some at a time, and more as needed.  The second time I made these I got creative and healthy and they still turned out amazing; I liked them better.  I used a flour mix of 1 1/2 c. whole wheat pastry flour + 1/2 c. finely ground oats + 1 c. all purpose flour.  I used a stick of butter and for the extra 1/4 cup used coconut oil (the solid stuff from a jar). Instead of using any egg at all I used chia paste, a great egg substitute, made by mixing chia seeds and water in a jar and shaking until the seeds float suspended in their gel. (The ratio is something like 1 T chia seeds per cup of water, but you can decide on what you think is the eggiest consistency.) This time I happened to have heavy cream, so I used that plus some 1% milk.  I added cinnamon and chopped dried apricots. I made the dough and cut it in the evening, refrigerated it and cooked up yummy scones for breakfast. (I had to add a minute or two to the cooking time for cold dough.) The scones were toasty brown, really moist and flaky and a little too addictive--but at least a little healthier...I will definitely make these again

These were delicious. I modified them to make grapefruit scones. I had a couple of ruby red grapefruits so I cut one up and added little pieces into the dough. I also put the egg into the measuring cup ( as other had suggested) and filled the measuring cup with half n half leaving about 1/8 of a cup for fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Before they went into the oven I made a grapefruit glaze by whisking together grapefruit juice and powdered sugar with a little lemon zest and then brushed the tops of the scones generously. The grapefruit flavor was very subtle, they were delicious alone or with a little Devonshire cream. Heavenly!!

I'm still in awe at how good this recipe was. I used 3/4 cup half and half instead of milk and added 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon orange rind, and 1/3 cup dried cranberries. I also glazed them with a mixture of water, orange juice, and powdered sugar. They were SO easy and the dough was literally so much fun to work with. They came out gorgeous. They look like they came from a bakery, but they taste even better. This is coming from a 15-year-old who ALWAYS manages to screw up a recipe, so take it from me, these are to die for. My family thinks I'm some sort of genius now.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was far too gloppy to form a proper scone or biscuit.  Made a pretty good muffin, but not what I look for in an authentic scone.

Amazing! Moist, sweet and extremely easy to make!
I also made a few changes: 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup and instead of using a rolling pin, I rolled them with my hands into small flat balls and baked them (Since I  could not find my rolling pin!) Still they turned out excellent! The best recipe for scones that I have tried.

I have been using this as my customized scone base recipe for years and just love it!!! The scones are very moist, not dry like a traditional European scone.

Great recipe! As others noted, I added the liquid a little bit at a time until the dough was moist. I didn't use all the liquid. I divided my dough into two sections, the egg into 2 halves, and then made two kinds of scone. One was cinnamon raisin (I also added vanilla) and one was cranberry orange (I used half orange juice and half milk). Both came out delicious, very moist and tasty!

Really easy and tasty recipe!  I subbed 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat and only used 1/2 cup of butter and they were amazing.  My 4 year old LOVED them as much as my husband and I did!

Yummy easy scones with ingredients you already have. I added 1/2 cup slivered almonds (delicious) but raisins, dried cherries, cranberries or apriots would all be tasty additions. 

Perfect with my morning coffee!

I don't get it... everytime I make this my mixture is wet and runny... I end up dropping the dough by tablespoonfuls on my stoneware and baking them that way. They do taste good!

These are so delicious I can't believe how yummy they are.  Instead of 1 cup milk I to used 1/2 cup of 1% low fat milk with 1/2 cup of fat free half n half,  and I also added chocolate chips.  For the finishing touch before the oven I spread the scones with egg and sprinkled with sugar.  ENJOY!!!

Easy quick recipe that turns out tasting delicious. I used about half of my milk/cream/egg mix and added blueberries. I brushed my scones with  butter to gloden and found some great vanilla flavored cane sugar i garnished my scones with.

These are easy and delicious.  I've made them four times now and I let my food processor do all of the work!  I only use 1/2 cup butter (1 stick) as I don't think the extra butter is necessary.  The first time I made them with 3/4 C. butter and I can't tell the difference with less butter. This has become a weekend staple for my family.

These were phenomenal!  I took the advice of others and added the milk (milk with a little heavy cream as part of it) to the egg in the measuring cup to make one cup.  I pulsed the butter, sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt in the food processor, then pulsed in the butter and then added the egg/milk/cream mixture and ran the machine until it came together, then mixed in dried cranberries and sliced almonds.  I only slightly kneaded it after that by hand.  I formed it into two balls and then made sixteen wedges.  I served them to my book group with whipped cream and blackberry preserves (and tea on the side to drink).

This was a extremely easy!  I ended up cutting up the butter in little pieces and using my hand to mix it up.  It worked great!  I wanted to spruce them up so I followed other suggestions. 1/2 the batch I added mini choc. chips.  The other 1/2 I sprinkled 1/2 tsp vanilla in it and a bit of cinnamon.  I mixed that up so it was evenly dispersed.  After cutting them with a biscuit cutter I took the little bit of the egg/milk mixture I had remaining and spread it on top.  I then sprinkled cinn./sugar mixture on top of them... Baked them up for a little less than the 15 minutes.  They came out wonderful!!!  Thanks for a great easy recipe! Yum!

A coworker made these for a potluck and it's similar to her recipe except she used at least 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking power. The butter,shortening and water should be colder to prevent gluten from forming;otherwise the scones will turn out hard.Also, add liquid enough till it forms into a dough.

Loved it!  I did it all in a food processor making minimal mess.  I added about 1/2 t. fresh ground nutmeg to the dry ingredients and added dried cranberries at the end.  On the second batch, I was in a hurry and forgot the egg.  Guess what, it came out great, too.

I've never eaten a scone, let alone baked them. I do know that people have different preferences in terms of texture, and these may not be the traditional "sconey" texture. But I have to say that these were absolutely fantastic! I followed the advice of those before who suggested keeping the baking powder at about 1 1/2 tsp, and using less milk, and they turned out perfect!

This is a very good recipe with some modifications. The first time, I made them exactly as listed (except with butter flavored Crisco instead of butter) and found them to be a bit crumbly and could taste the baking powder in them. So I subbed half & half for milk but only used 3/4 C. I used margarine the second time and the texture was better. Not sure how they would be with butter (probably great). Instead of 5t baking powder, I used 3t baking powder, 1t baking soda and 1t cream of tartar. I also added a little more salt, just a pinch. I added 1 C dried cranberries & orange-flavored raisins and some orange peel (probably about 1T). I also added 1t vanilla a 2t cinnamon. Then I made a glaze for them, which made ALL the difference. I used 1t vanilla and 1T milk. I added powdered sugar and milk until it was a good consistency (thick but not as thick as icing). I tried to use a glaze recipe I found on here, but it was WAY too runny, so I just kept adding more and more powdered sugar until it was thick enough. Try the glaze addition. It really does make a difference. :) With the additional ingredients, I found that I needed to cook them longer b/c they rose more and were chewy in the middle. So I reduced the temp to 350 and cooked an additional 10 min, but play with it.

The cool thing about this recipe is that it's easy, so you can make a batch and then make alterations. Next time I'll use this recipe to make mini vanilla scones like at Starbucks.

I just made these for my family. I doubled the recipe though so the cook time was longer (an extra 15 min). I still have scones left only because we ran out of jam. So far they can't seem to get enough. Thank you.

Light and fluffy inside with a sort of crispy outside. My sister and I loved it. Followed the instructions, but at the end I added some craisins and a tablespoon of orange zest, along with a tablespoon of orange juice and a tablespoon of the juice in the maraschino cherry jar, and this recipe worked perfect. Even my neighbour thinks they're wonderful! I'm sure even without what I added, it would be just as good.

Easy Recipe. Followed all the way through. Added frozen raspberries, which I should have altered how much liquid I added.  Dough came out a little to wet & sticky, but nothing I couldn't fix with a little extra flour.  Scones came out perfect, really tender and nice.  I'll never buy dried out scones at Starbuck's again.  I'll bring my own.

WOW! I have a bed and breakfast and needed a quick bread. I found this recipe and it was on the table within a little more than 1/2 hour. I didn't add all the liquid. I added the egg to the 1 c milk and beat it. I added as much liquid as I needed. I was left with 1/3 c liquid. I also used 2 cup of white flour and 1 cup bleached whole wheat flour as I am beginning to do with most of my recipes, usually adding 50% bleached ww flour. I should add that I used a juice glass as my "cookie cutter." Using a food processor made incorporating the butter, child's play. EXCELLENT! THANKS FOR SHARING!

Perfect basic scones recipe. I made orange cranberry (with sugar on top) and cheese dill. Both very perfectly flaky and fantastic.

Great scone. The dough was really wet, so we made them into drop scones and baked for about 15 minutes. Also only used 1/2 c. butter. Was a great shortcake substitute to go with strawberries

When it says to cut in the butter, microwave it for 20 seconds, then cut it into little squares. It will make it a LOT easier when you add it to the flour mixture. I thought it was still too moist when it was time to roll it out, so I added about one more cup of flour to it, and it worked fine. Before it went into the oven I spread butter and cinnamon plentifully and that was AWESOME!!
This recipe is just great, and is really good with jame and whipped cream on top when it's hot from the oven!

These are amazing! I did take a few suggestions from other reviewers by putting the egg in the measuring cup and then adding the milk. As well as I used about 1/4 cup heavy cream and 3/4 cup milk (That is before the egg addition), but I did not use anywhere near all of that mixture. I added 2 tsp cinnamon and about 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and drizzled chocolate ganache on them. Be careful when you bake these as 1 min over and they will become rather dry.

Delicious and super fast. I only used half of the egg/milk mixture and added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also sprinkled the top with brown sugar. I just had a piece with my coffee and it was perfect.

These scones are absolutely fantastic!  I'm living in England in the land of scones and clotted cream and I haven't had anything better.  The second time of making this recipe (in a week), I added about 1/4 cup chopped apricots which was a heavenly addition.  I highly recommend giving this simple and delicious recipe a try!

quick simple, had no problem with consistancy if I added a little more flour.  Used the egg and milk mixed together trick also.
Made 36 small heart shaped scones.

Really great recipe.  Very flaky and not too sweet.  I added a tsp. of vanilla and 2 tsp. ground cinnamon with frozen blueberries and they were phenomenal!  Highly recommend to anyone!

This is a very simple, but very sweet scone recipe. Not so good if you're going to be adding more sweets like jams or jellies, but perhaps really good for some savoury toppings

Hi _ I am not sure yet. Still baking but the metric conversion is wrong. 3 cups flour = 375g? I had to add a lot of flour to get a dough-like consistency.

These are awesome!! Super easy, this is the first recipe I've tried and they came out great! I added chocolate chips to satisfy the sweet tooth. :)  Next time I'll probably freeze the butter and grate it in for easier mixing, and try it with blueberries!

This recipe is great, I made some changes, instead of using 3/4 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup of OJ, also put in 1/2 cup of yogurt.  I also blend in cranberries and walnuts. I baked scones for 25 minutes at 400F, and they came out wonderful, moist inside and golden outside.

These scones are good...but I am having a lot of trouble with the fact that people are giving them so many stars! They're plain and simple (no seasoning), which may be the English way but they don't have the amazing flaky texture that makes a great English scone great. I made these for brunch with friends and, by coincidence, our guests brought scones from a great, local, Cuban bakery.  The scones from the bakery had all kinds of interesting flavors (they didn't have any labels, but I'm guessing light curry cranberry? and coconut with fruit) and were so delightfully flaky that I felt just a little disapointed about serving these homemade scones to my guests. They are yummy, go well with jam and whipped cream, and maybe they're easier than better scones.  But nobody offered any major compliments.

Great recipe!!  Easy to make, and very versatile for different flavoring options!  This time I made the cranberry orange version, adding about 1/3 cup half and half and 1/2 cup OJ.  Next time I'll try blueberry or apple cinnamon!  Thanks so much for the recipe and all the great recommendations!

Sinfully easy, forgiving and so good! I made the plain ones here, but plan to add raspberries or almonds or whatever is on hand next time. My daughter made them with a little OJ and some choco chips. Fantastic! You can wow friends all over the place by showing up with these in hand!

After making the basic recipe, I cut the dough in half, added 60% cocoa chocolate chips to half, kneaded it slightly, then rolled it out and cut into triangles. The second half I added in a little fresh orange juice, some orange zest, and some dried cranberries. I didn't measure any of my additives... I also topped them with some raw sugar.  Baked them for almost 20 minutes. Glazed the chocolate chip ones with powder sugar glaze with vanilla extract, the orange cranberry ones with orange glaze with almond extract. Very yummy!! Better than the ones I buy from Starbucks!!!

Following the further instructions of the top 3 reviewers I made scones for the first time, per this recipe. They're better than any biscuit I have ever made.  My kids loved them and I'd be a fool not to make them again soon. Thanks for sharing this!

I tried out this recipe for my daughters birthday, we are having a tea party.  This was a great recipe.  I didn't have milk so I used buttermilk and half and half (1/2 cup each, I also mixed the egg with the liquid like someone else had suggested).  The dough came out wet so I just spooned it onto the baking sheet.  I added pecans and white chocolate chunks-my daughter loved it!  I will be making these again, and I am going to try different add-ins.  She requested chocolate chip and cranberry.

Wonderful recipe. Very simple. Used suggestions written below regarding egg/milk to equal one cup.  I really only used about a half cup of the mixture though.  Added some lemon zest and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon as well as Vanilla extract.  Used food processor to cut butter. Later I put 1 cup blueberries in food processor and pulsed briefly then added to dough. Turned out great! Made glaze out of lemon juice and powdered sugar. Drizzled over a few. I couldn't have asked for a better scone.

Turned out wonderful.  Everything I wanted in a scone, light, fluffly, and tasty.  They are not super dense like a lot of store bought ones I get and I like that.  But like many of the other reviews, mine were too wet.  I made a huge mess. Actually rather comical given my other perilous baking adventures.  Next time I will have pay attention and add small amounts of milk till I get the right consistency.  Either way they still came out looking and tasting delicious.  I added fresh strawberries to mine.

Solid Recipe.  Followed it exactly and came out with some rather large scones.  So I cut them in thirds after I baked them and they were the perfect size.  Next time I'll make them smaller before I bake them, though maybe that will impact the baking time?  As other bakers noted, it only needs about half the egg and milk mixture.

Wow!  These were great.  No need to buy expensive ones from the coffee shop any more.  The they were moist an flavorful.  I mixed the egg and milk in a measuring cup (egg whisked) then added only a little at a time.  I used about half of the egg milk mix.  I mixed in Raisins and Cinnamon before cutting.  I will make again with a variety of other ingredients.

This was my first time making scones. DELICIOUS! I tried grating in frozen butter, as someone else suggested; that was a great idea. I also used whole wheat flour, which took a lot more liquid than I had anticipated. I ended up mashing up 1 and a half bananas for extra moisture, and wound up with 8 GIANT scones. SO GOOD!

I need help...  My dough turned out a little runny, and I couldn't knead it out.  So I just spooned it onto the baking sheet.  Also, it didn't rise as it was supposed to...  I followed all measurements exactly...  Please tell me where I went wrong.

Great for brunch! I chopped up some strawberries and mixed them with sugar as a topping. My boyfriend devoured them and said he'd prefer scones with berries more than shortcake or angel food cake from now on.

These turned out pretty well...not too sweet.  I added a few shakes of cinnamon, a splash of vanilla and about a half cup of mini chocolate chips.  I also used whipping cream instead of milk because I wanted to use up the whipping cream.  They turned out a bit crumbly but otherwise good.

These were quite good, but you definately need to add something to them or they are too plain.  Very easy and quick to make.  They were a little fluffier than I expected.

These were really, really good. I added 1 teaspoon of maple extract, and it should be noted that I had to use waay more than a light amount of flour. Had no problems with the dough, and found out the scones came out best after 13 minutes instead of 15. Once cooled, I frosted these with the Decorator Frosting recipe by P. Oakes from this site, to which I added 1 teaspoon of maple extract and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.

Nice, but not scones as I know them. They were very soft. I'm used to dryer crunchier scones. Still, we loved them. I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour in the recipe. They were great with jam.

Tasted good and was really easy to make. I was looking for a recipe on a spontaneous decision to make scones and this was pretty easy to make and only called for ingredients that I had on hand. The only thing is it didn't really taste like scones as I am used to them...

i just made these and yes they are my first scones to make but these were delicious.  they had a light texture and made 12 very reasonably/large sized scones.  i did adjust the recipe a bit--i used heavy whipping cream and skim milk (a mixture of both). i also cracked the egg first (in the measuring cup) then filled up the rest with the milk mixture.  i don't know if i used exactly one cup because i more eyed the mixture until it was right.  .  i added fresh blueberries but the scone was not a sweet scone, even with the blueberries so i want to add a lemon icing which would work well with the blueberries.  of course feel free to use butter, jam, honey or the classic clotted cream! these were great! thanks so much. (if you're in the south watch the wet ingredients because you probably wont use as much due to the humidity (i didn't))

This recipe was great.  My family told me the scones "were better than store bought".  I add lemon juice to the dough, a few slices of fresh strawberries, and spinkled cinnamon sugar both before and after baking.  Really turned out excellent.

I woke up looking for a quick and easy scone recipe for my homemade blueberry jam and this was it! Very tasty as is- however next time I'll probably throw in a little cinnamon as some others suggested if I eat them plain.

This is a superb recipe! My husband and I have made it a number of different ways and it always turns out terrific and receives rave reviews. We like the following combinations: 1) orange zest, orange juice, and craisins 2) lemon zest, lemon juice, and craisins 3) walnuts, cinnamon, and brown sugar 4)raisins and cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe!

These scones are wonderful.  I make a big batch on Sunday morning then the family & I have them with coffee for the rest of the week.  These honestly taste as good as the scones I would pay $3 for at my neighborhood coffee shop.

This recipe has been a Sunday morning staple.  My husband always asks for these scones, and they are so quick and easy to make.  I use whole wheat flour and they are still light and fluffy.  Seomtimes I also add cinnamon to taste within the dry ingredients as well.  Dee-lish!

This is a great recipe - definitely a keeper! My husband's Scottish and swears by his mother's scones, so it was a great compliment when he said that even his dad would have loved the scones from this recipe! I followed the recommendation on mixing the egg with the milk in the 1 cup measure. I didn't bother with rolling the dough out, so after kneading I just tore off a handful of dough, rolled into a ball and then patted it flat before baking. Still turned out perfectly.

What a great recipe to use as-is or to modify!  I tried substituting half cup OJ for half of the milk and added a handfull of dried cranberries.  Wow, these were delicious!  Light, tender, not too crumbly.  This is the scone recipe I'll use from now on!

I grew up having tea and scones with my English grandmother, but lost her recipe so I tried this one because it seemed similar.  This recipe made really light, fluffy, tasty scones and I will make it again and again.  I made this in the traditional English style with round cut-outs that I then split in half, buttered and spread with strawberry jam and topped with cream - delicious.  A word to the not so hungry - I have halved this recipe (for the egg, beat in a measuring jug and use half) and have ended up with 7 good sized round scones.

I made this just now... they are so good and very easy to make and very yummy.You can add anything you like in it. I mix little water with brown sugar and cinnamon as somebody suggested and brush it on top of the pieces.If you don't want to have giant pieces, you can divide the dough into smaller round pieces.

I usually make the World's best scones but I was out of sour cream today, so I found this and stirred it up quite easily.  I don't see it as a traditional scone, but the flavor is very good and easy to make.  Dough is quite wet and required a bit more time in the oven.  Overall, a good recipe in a pinch.

I have made these twice now - both times with expellor pressed canola oil substituted for the butter (a heart healthier fat) something I do not see in previous reviews. Really need to watch the liquid ingredients but they turned out great.  The scones I have purchased in the grocery store are way too sugary.  The cafeteria where I work charges almost $2 for a big scone so I'll be saving $$ by making them myself.  One previous reviewer thought that since milk was used and not buttermilk, that was a health advantage.  Not so - buttermilk has the same calories as skim milk, it just tastes richer due to the thickness and name.  Time to make a second batch while I have the oven warm and all the ingredients out.  This time with half of the flour whole wheat pastry flour.

Fantastic! I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 cup of raisins to the batter. The batter looked a bit too thin, so I added about 1/3 cup of self-rising flour. I didn't want to mix it by hand, so I put the dry ingredients and the butter in the food processor, and then had the dough hook attachment incorporate the egg and the milk mixture. Also, I cooked them for about 2 extra minutes. They came out wonderfully and I got rave reviews :) I think that I will use this as my base recipe, and change out what I add to it. Instead of the vanilla and the raisins, I'll try lemon extract and blueberries next time...

Loved these scones! They have the perfect "scone" texture. I added a bit of almond extract and slivered almonds to mine, and they were fabulous - thanks for a great recipe that will be added to my recipe box!

Easy, delicious and just like my favorite bakery!  I added dried cranberries and brushed the top with a little extra of the milk & egg mixture, then sprinkled it with granulated sugar.

Wonderful!!! I just got back from Ireland and these scones taste really close to the ones at the Old Weir Lodge in Killarny Ireland that the owner would bake fresh for us each morning. A MUST Try!!!

These are as delicious as they are simple! (I had to explain to my spouse what a scone  is, but they seem to be disappearing!) I added only about half of the milk/egg mixture and wish that I'd added a little less, as the dough was still a sticky. I cut the dough into twelve pieces instead of eight by making 2 rounds and cutting them into 6ths. Next time I will make them a little flatter before baking. I made this recipe because it had the shortest list of ingredients (and all ones that I had!) and was adaptable. I added a cup of dried cranberries and they are tasty!

This is the best scone recipe I've come across in a long search. I make them whenever the scone craving strikes, or when spur-of-the-moment baking is called for. I've even brought them to a Summer Solstace party, along with fresh strawberries, to be enjoyed as strawberry shortcake. You do need to pay attention to the amount of liquid you add, as humidity seems to cause the dough's moisture to vary considerably from day to day. Great comfort food and great for sharing with friends!

This recipe really works well. The scones are perfect and delicious. For those people that are having difficult with the quantity of milk, the recipe calls for it to be poured in "until moistened". Leave the remaining milk and egg mixture out. Also when adding a sprinkling of sugar on top, use the "Sugar in the raw" style with the larger granual as they do in finer bakerys. I read that one person said they were "salty". Not at all. I think you put baking soda in instead of baking powder. All around a great recipe.

Great recipe!  I switched the white sugar to brown sugar and added approx. 1 tsp of cinnamon to it, and we loved them.  Very moist and soft.  The dough was a little sticky, but I was able to knead it without a problem.  I will definitely be making these again.

Excellent!  I was surprised at how fluffy they were with only baking powder.  I used the zest and juice of one orange and added 1/2 cup cranberries.  My only problem was that they were still gooey after baking for 15 min and I had to leave them in for an extra 8 min or so.  Great recipe!

Opps!! I just made them and am already eating my second one.  I think they taste great.  That said I had some changes to the recipe.  I ran out of baking powder and only used 3 tsp. not 5, I had bought regular whipping cream for a different recipe- knew it'd just go bad in my fridge, so I subsituted that for the milk...and my whopper of an error- instead of using 3/4 cup of butter I used 3/4 of one stick of butter- which would be just half the amount called for.  I took the suggestion of grating frozen butter which worked great.  After kneading, I broke my dough into 2 and formed a circle w each and used a pizza cutter to cut them before baking.  Even with my major error- they were wonderful!!  This was a test run as I needed scones for school project...now I'm wondering do I make them again with my butter error or do I try adding more butter as the recipe calls for.  I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the tops before baking....YUMMY...going to go back and eat my 3rd one now.

I never made scones before and just love the ones at the coffee shop. This is a very easy recipe and holds its own against the ones the pros make. I made mine with dried apricots and cinamon the first time and just cinnamon the second. This is a favorite.

I have done many different things to this recipe and they all turned out great. One thing I did was add 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the mixture then stirred in 1 cup of cinnamon baking chips.GREAT!!! Another twist was to substitute brown sugar for the white sugar, then stirred in 1 1/2 cups of toffee bits. Then I cut into mini scones to make them more bite size. AWESOME!! Will continue to use this recipe over and over agian!!!

A good basic scone recipe- I can't have milk while breastfeeding, so I substituted vanilla soymilk and decreased amt to 3/4 cup.  I also added chopped up cranberries that I sweetened with Splenda.  I made a glaze w/ OJ and powdered sugar and drizzled it on top.  I enjoyed them b/c they weren't overly sweet.  Thanks!

These scones tasted alright, but there's absolutely no possible way you can knead them like how the recipe suggests!  The dough is much too sticky for that, and when I added all of the three cups of flour to mine, the mixture got almost rubber-like and even more impossible to work with.  I ended up dropping them on cookie sheets (which wasn't easy, either) with blueberries in them.  Many people mistook them for chocolate chip cookies by their appearance.  This was my first and last time trying to make scones.

I followed a few other reviewer's suggestions.  I decreased the butter to 1 stick/ or 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of apple butter.  I upped the sugar from 1/2 to 3/4 cup;I used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar.  I added 1 tsp. cream of tartar, 1 tsp cardamom, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves.
They went perfectly with blackberry  & strawberry preserves.  

Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe.  I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, and added chopped walunts and a little maple syrup and they turned out excellent.  I made drop scones instead of kneading the dough since it was very sticky.  It made 14 very large scones.  I baked them for about 17 minutes and added a glaze of milk, powdered sugar and maple syrup. Yummy!

I put 2 T of homemade candied orange peel. Rather than egg, I brushed the top with lots of butter and then sprinkled with sugar and some candied orange peel. Less handling is best, don't overwork the dough.

Alright, this is totally soft and fluffy. Followed the recipe exactly, poured the mixture of milk and egg slowly into the dough only until moistened, and had no problem with the kneading. I like it very much but this isn't exactly what I was looking for in a scone. It's more like biscuits or rolls?! Still gonna search for the flaky, "pie doughy" scones recipe. ThankS anyway.

These are so great, I make them all the time and they're gone in a heartbeat. The orange/cranberry listed by those before are great. Also, I really enjoy making them with about 2 tsp to 1 tbsp of cinnamon and a few handfuls of milk chocolate chips.

These were great. Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned what to do if the dough is sticky at first. I kept kneading and adding flour and the dough came together after a bit. Just a note, if you're not partial to sweet things, you might want to cut the sugar. I cut the sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup and these were plenty sweet for me. I might even cut it to 1/4 cup next time.

I have tried making scones in the past with little success; they always seem pretty bland.  I added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest.  Here is a great hint when working with dried cranberries (or raisins) -- add the craisins and orange zest to the beaten egg and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes before adding to the dry ingredients. This plumps the craisins and makes them really moist.  After the scones had cooled for a few minutes, I topped them with a simple orange glaze.  Very yummy indeed!

This is a delicious and simple scone. I have made many recipes, but I really loved the flavor of these.  After reading all the reviews, this is what I did.  I sifted the dry ingredients, using just 4 tsp bakins powder, I did half butter, half margerine, and I used 1 egg with part half and half part milk to 1 cup (I used slightly more than half of the milk mixture).  I made mini scones for a tea party -  I cut in circles then in half and crimped to make more triangular! These are so light and fluffy.  I also did a batch with cranberries and pecans chopped! Thanks for sharing! This is a great verstatile recipe!

This is my absolute favorite scone recipe. I have added everything from chocolate chips to peaches to it and they turn out GREAT every time! Try some blue cheese and walnuts or just sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar on top...either way they are yummy. I split the dough in half and make two 8" circles. The scones are a bit smaller, but seem to rise better and you can make a couple different kinds.

I've never made scones before but this will definitely not be my last time. They are delicious and go great with tea! I will be having these at the tea party I will host for the ladies from my church. The amount of baking powder was perfect for the recipe and the idea of putting the egg in first and adding milk to equal 1 c. was perfect. Thank you all!

This was a TRUE hit at my work.  Four people ate all 10 of them in less than two hours (I made blueberry and raspberry).  Every week they look forward to the scones.  I even tried making them healthier by using all oat flour (roughtly 3 1/2 cups - just grind up oats in a coffee grinder).  I actually got better reviews with the oat flour!  These are a real keeper!

After paying $1.50 per scone at a local market, I finally decided to try to make my own.  Donna's recipe is easy and a terrific base for making scones to your liking.  I divided the dough into two batches and made blueberry/pineapple and another batch of cinammon sugar.  I patted out the dough between floured wax paper and cut into wedges.  I used 1% milk and they tasted fine.  Will definitely make again.  A real family-pleaser.  Thanks, Donna!

I had never eaten a scone before.  I make more muffins.  Not as sweet as muffins usually are.  Easy to make.  Good with a hot beverage for breakfast.  I carefully added a half cup of elderberries after kneading the dough.  My coworkers thought I could have added more fruit.

These were very good but I have to add almost a whole cup more of flour because it's humid where I live. I also brush a little butter and sprinkle some sugar on top. Just a little.

OK, this is the recipe that I was looking for!  I was trying to recreate my favourite scones from a local cafe, and if you add some currants and a little grated orange peel they are perfect.   I did follow the suggestion and use half & half instead of milk, and definitely butter (not marg) for flavour. Since I was making these in a hurry, the butter was not cut in super fine, and I didn't really knead them, just pressed the dough together enough to make the circle.  Came out perfect, and the rough surface was crunchy and "rustic" looking.  Mmmmm....Thank You!

I made these exactly to the recipe for a mother's day tea party but we couldn't eat them. We planned on adding clotted cream and jam to these but they were so fluffy and crumbly they fell apart before we could eat them. Not sure if it was my mistake some how or the recipe but I won't be making these again.

I keep butter sticks frozen just for scones.  I have searching around for that perfect scone recipe and this is it!  I add my butter to the flour mixture by grating it in, then mixing.  (My kitchen is pretty low tech)  Also add 1 cup white chocolate pieces and 1 cup dried fruit - such as blueberries or cranberries.  My husband loves them!  Makes 8 large scones.  I baked 18 minutes.

These scones are very light compared to other recipes I've tried. I added 1.5 teasponns cinnamon to the dry ingredients, followed the recipe as written except for using advice to top off the egg with milk to 1 cup, then hand folded in blueberries to use up seasonal fruit. I quartered, then cut in thirds the dough to get 12 scones.
Yummy!

Quick and easy way to make something special for breakfast. Used buttermilk instead of regular milk and dried cranberries.  Worked fine. Needs a full inch separation between cut wedges.  took 19 minutes to bake.  Mixed up the dry ingrediants in the food processor with the chopper blade and then used that to cut in the frozen butter.

These are a perfect base recipe for sweet or savoury scones. Crunchy outside and flaky, tender inside. As others suggested, putting egg in measuring cup then adding milk to make the 1 cup measure is perfect.

I added a teaspoon on cinnamon, a 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract, and a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries and they turned out wonderfully. I chilled & grated the butter into the flour which made it really easy to work with and although the dough was very crumbly in the bowl it came together nicely once I started kneeding it. The first batch burned a bit on the bottom after only about 12 minutes in the oven, but for the second batch I dropped the oven temperature back to 350° and moved the rack up to the 2nd top rather than middle rack. The second batch turned out perfectly!

Tried this with about 1 cup of frozen raspberries, and half a small bag of white chocolate chips. Left scones on the counter to cool and they were never seen again. I suspect the munchkins stole them :-)

This recipe is really great. I wasn't looking for a sweet scone so I think next time I'm going to reduce the sugar. 1/8 cup? Or less?

That said, it was quick, simple, and perfect comfort food.

These are fantastic! I make a half recipe most of the time for our little family and they are a favorite. I don't usually change anything but this last time I added a handful of dried blueberries for more of a breakfast feel. Yum.

OK, this was awesome!  The suggestions were helpful so that I added the egg/milk mixture gradually.  I'll know ever better next time.  So good - my 9-year-old scarfed it up for breakfast and even my picky 11-year-old agreed it wasn't bad (high praise).

Awesome base recipe.  I added dried cranberries and pistacchios, then made a basic glaze (icing sugar and a touch of water) with almond extract in it to drizzle over the top.  Moist and delicious!

Oh my god, I made this recipe for my Family. I'm the youngest in the family, yet also the cook. It was so easy and fun to make. I added Raspberries and it made it even sweeter! These are like no scones you could buy at a store. I highly recommend these!

This was really easy to make, not sure about how authentic it is--but they tasted good enough. I'd probably make these again if I didn't have a lot of time and just wanted to indulge a bit. I'm sure there are scones that are more authentic and taste better, but these are really good for only spending 30 minutes in the kitchen!

I don't cook often but for a school potluck I decided to make some scones. While making them I made a few mistakes (I almost forgot to put in the butter) and after adding the butter it had a very sticky and gooey sort of consistency. I added some flour and it helped a lot. Rather than laying it out flat and cutting out wedges of batter, I rolled the batter into a cylinder and cut it so it would already have circular edges. I tried one and it was the BEST SCONE I'VE EVER HAD. I offered some to my family, and they all agreed. One last tip: I wanted to make 16 and I ended up with 21 huge scones by doubling the recipe, so you might get more than expected. And remember; when in doubt, add more flour. HOPE I HELPED!!!

The first time I made them they were awesome! Just now, the second time, I tried to substitute butter for Apple sauce and the dough went extremely sticky. To counter act, I added flour until it was "handleable" as I didn't know what else to do. Still delicious, but waaaay heavier. May use a different recipe with applesauce next time

Really great as drop-scones. Added about 2 tbs extra milk to get a nice soft dough. Added diced candied ginger as a little extra sweetness to combat the fairly high baking soda content. Turned out light and airy and completely delicious.

I made this recipe exactly as is except I added some cinnamon to the mix and cinnamon sugar on top. They were amazing! I made them for a baby shower and everyone loved them. So much so that the mommy to be woke up a few mornings later craving my scones! I made a faux clotted cream and raspberry preserve to go along with them... Yum!

This recipe is excellent!  My husband and I love the scones.  The too wet dough can be resolved by adding more flour which is what I do and the scones are wonderful.  Have used this recipe twice, adding in an extract and/or fruit to get the variaty I am wanting at the time.

I wish I could give 10 stars! I was intimidated by scones, but I don't know why because this was so quick and easy! Same concept as making biscuits...make sure your butter is very cold when you cut it in. It's very important to know that you will not necessarily need to use the entire cup of milk or the entire egg...beat them together and pour it into the flour mixture in small amounts, just until your batter comes together. I threw out nearly half a cup of mixture. These produced big, beautiful, fluffy, tender, gorgeous scones!! I topped mine with a cinnamon glaze.  Thank you for this recipe!!

I made this for my sister's bridal shower party and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it. I added dried currants to mine and brushed the top of the scone with some half and half cream and some white sugar before baking. It was delightful! I also reduced the amount of sugar used by 1/4 since the crowd didn't have a huge sweet tooth. The recipe still turned out great. I'll definitely be using this recipe again moving forward!!

For me it went great. Lovely scones, maybe they would be better if you add some flavor like lemon, orange, chocolate, nuts or vanilla or so. But cool recipe, thanks! Just one small issue the servings turned out like a lot, it says for 12 and i came up with like 30 at least!

These were great! I have to admit, it did not go well the first time I tried... Blame it on the otherwise brilliant recipe which isn't quite clear enough if you ask me. No need to add the whole milk/egg mix, you just need to add some until the dough is right (moist). If you add it all (like I did at first), you're just going to end up with a very buttery muffin batter... Once you get that, you are good for cream tea!

The recipe was good but a few suggestions. After you cut in the butter, slowly mix the egg/milk mixture just a little at a time. You also do not want to roll out the dough too thin. In my  gas oven, I need to roll it to more than half an inch thickness. If I don't, the bottoms get burnt and the edges will be hard as a rock. I also brush on some butter to the top of the scone for a more browned and buttery top. For being a simple scone recipe, these were fantastic

I like how simple this recipe is. First time i did this, it was like a very thick batter consistency. It tasted really good but looked like bread lumps. I just made a batch today and used 3/4 cup egg+milk. Threw in some dried cranberries and walnuts. Now it's a coffee shop-worthy batch of scones

These were amazing! I loved how light and fluffy they were. I added orange zest, cranberries, and dark chocolate chunks. Like other users, I mixed the egg and milk together,and slowly poured them into the dry ingredients until just moistened . I will be using this again! Thanks for sharing!

Yum! These are so good! The recipe yields 8 scones, but with 3 cups of flour, they turn out huge. I definitely cut them into smaller portions, but maybe that's just because I have small kids.

These were good, but just a little too crunchy on the exterior and a bit chewy overall for me to give them a 5, probably from the excess butter on the crunch and the addition of the egg for the "chew". Some recipes call for letting the dough rest before baking, and if I try this recipe again I will do that and see if that makes them more tender. The upside however, is that they were super moist in the interior, and the butter lent good flavor. However, I like to mix in "stuff" for flavor anyway, my favorite additions are coconut and chocolate chips, but if I don't have those on hand I add little nuggets of dried fruit (apricot chunks, dried cranberries, pineapple chunks) and nuts. So, for me the "extra" buttery-ness and excess sugar are overkill. I usually only add 2-3 Tbsp of sugar not a half cup. I went ahead and put in a 1/3 of a cup, but knew it would be way too sweet with the coconut if I added the full half cup. I also liked the quantity, I divided the dough in half and got 16 decent sized scones. So, overall they were good, but still not nearly as good as James Beard's recipe that he got from his mother. With only 5 ingredients (no butter and no egg,) it produces a moist, rich, a tender crumb, and soft lovely scone with very little effort. (You can look it up online using a search engine.)

Overall, these tasted very good. However, The sizes of them are HUGE. Definitely make the scones smaller than suggested. Otherwise, they turn out great. They're soft, crispy and sweet.

I made this morning and added some boysenberries from my garden. I wish I hadn't wasted boysenberries... they tasted more like biscuits, too doughy/floury flavored for my taste, the husband turned them away too. Maybe adding more sugar would have helped? I wont be making this recipe again.

I made this recipe exactly as written (because I think that's how these recipes should be reviewed) and I was very happy with the results: good flavor, good texture (not too dry, not too moist), easy to handle dough, baked up according to directions.  I will keep this recipe on file and make again.  They are easy and quick!

This was the first time I made scones.  I shredded the butter by cheese grater to mix in dough, and reduced the sugar using only brown sugar.  I split the dough and made half with about 1/2 cup golden raisins and chopped pecans, then sprinkled with chopped pecans.  The other half i added about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, couple tablespoons of chives, and couple tablespoons of bacon. Delicious! 

 The husband and son ate all the pecan ones, the cheddar chive bacon need more tweaking.  We will make these again! Great recipe, easy to follow and I had all the ingredients in the house.

AWESOME! I used Half and half though and also only added the milk/egg mixture until it formed a cookie like dough. Very easy to roll out! I made these for "hands around the world" or "World Thinking day" A Girl scout event celebrating countries. Our troop did England and we made them! most of the kids liked them but all of the adults raved about how good they were and even came back for seconds! yummy! I will say though that I think the key is only adding enough liquid that it makes the dough wet and looks like cookie dough. Glad I read that from other reviews first!

They really are delish and exactly like british scones. - We did cheat and add an extra 1/4 c of butter & 1 tsp of vanilla. We cut the dough in small rounds with a cookie cutter and froze them. We brushed the tops with 1/2 & 1/2 and sprinkled with sugar and baked them frozen. Our girlscout troop just made these for World Thinking Day and added chocolate chunks and they were great!

I absolutely love this recipe! I used the exact ingredients along with cinnamon and vanilla extract. They taste amazing! The recipe called for eight but they looked huge when I cut them into wedges, so I made them a but smaller and got a dozen scones; they are still huge! I will be making more of these in a wider variety.

This is a great recipe! I only needed a few so took advantage of the custom feature and made 4- Totally made this in the food processor and just gathered and rolled and made 4 scones for breakfast-I added a handful of golden raisins to the dough and baked as directed-Perfect scones and much cheaper than eating out-I did cheat and had clotted cream and jam but extremely satisfying

Yummy!   I halved the recipe(only 2 people this evening), mixed the egg (egg substitute actually) & milk together as suggested by others.  The dough is a little on the "wet" side, just like my other scone recipes.  Just flour your board, turn out the dough, dust a little flour over & gently fold it in on itself & knead maybe 4 times.  It can then easily be rolled into a round & cut.  Making a 1/2 batch I did 2 rounds cut into 6 wedges each - one plain & the other with orange zest.  Coarse sugar was sprinkled over them all & baked for about 13 min.  They were a perfect size, delicious - no odd tastes.  We had ours w/ clotted cream & jam.  Will make again w/ other flavor additions.

Best scones EVER! Don't purchase from Starbucks! Make these instead. Used the food processor to make the orange-cranberry recipe suggested and accidentally omitted the butter. Still super awesome. Dough was a little sticky but lightly dusted with flour to roll, then smash into a rectangle and then cut triangular scones by first dividing the rectangle into equal quarters. Baked at 400 for 17 minutes and came out perfect. Nom nom nom nom nom.

This is only the second time I have made scones and this recipe is the best ever!!!  The last time I used a different recipe and I am so glad that I finally found this recipe...absolutely delicious.  I followed all others advice and measured the egg and milk together, so that both together would equal 1 cup.  I also added Hazelnut creamer instead of milk just as an experiment.  Either would be great.  The only thing I will mention is: don't freak out that the dough is very sticky like I did.  I trusted the recipe and left the dough sticky when I rolled them into a ball and baked them.  Do not add any more flour than the 3 cups - they were truly great.

I was asked to make 8 dozen scones for a High School football team. This recipe was the best basic recipe we found! I made Lemon/Poppyseed, Vanilla/Almond, Blueberry/White Chocolate, Chocolate Chip and Orange/Cranberry with this recipe. It was a huge hit. Thank you!

Excellent basic recipe. I changed it in the following way: less sugar, flour and flax seed flour, milk and orange juice, a bit of baking soda with a bit of lemon jest, vanilla and rhum extract, cranberries, raisins, pumpkin seeds, and hazelnuts. The result is divine!!! :)

Delicious! I followed tips in other reviews and they turned out perfectly. I intended to make these with blueberries and vanilla extract but accidentally used lemon extract instead -- it was definitely a happy accident! They were fantastic! I used frozen blueberries and only let them thaw at room temperature for about 10 minutes, then folded them into the mixture. That way, they remain whole and don't turn the entire batter blue and explode while baking. I made a simple sugar glaze (confectioner's sugar, vanilla extract & milk) & drizzled on top, but they really didn't need it. Will definitely bookmark this recipe!

Recipe was easy to follow and I took other reviewers advice about adding the egg / milk slowly until moist. I only needed about half the liquid. My mum is recovering from surgery and she loves afternoon tea. I decided to treat her by making scones. They came out beautifully and they were a real hit with the family. So easy and quick to make and smelled wonderful when baking. Only needed that in the oven for about 10-12 mins.

Excellent! Works at high altitude (above 5,000 feet) too. I had to add another cup of flour as the dough was far too wet and patted the dough into a round shape on a plate instead of using a rolling pin. Because I'm at 5,000+ feet, I had the oven at 400F for roughly 10 minutes, then baked until they were done at 375F, to prevent them burning. Worked great!

These scones are fantastic!  First time I ever made them and they came out perfect.  I followed other reviews and added milk to egg, then added wet mixture as needed.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla to the egg and it added just the right amount of flavor!  Will definetely make again, we had a proper English cream tea with these scones, I used a cup and made them round like the picture!

I had to give this 4 starts because I didn't follow the recipe to the T.  I only had bread flour and had to substitute the baking powder with baking soda.  They still came out pretty yummy.   I made half plain and half with chocolate chips.  The dough was a little sticky so my scones looks more like drop biscuits.

Even though I put the egg in the meashuring cup first (with the milk) mine were way too wet. I had to add a LOT more flour (about 10 tablespoons) to fix it. I put strawberrys in my scones (i had to thaw them) but the juice made it wet again so I had to add more flour. It made 18 scones with a glass for a cookie cutter (instead of triangles). i also added a mixture of lemon juice and powdered sugar on top. it turned out ok but I would use less milk.

Great recipe!  I used 1 tbs of baking powder and added milk as needed (probably used a little more than 3/4 cup).  Instead of rolling and cutting the dough, I used a large ice cream scoop and scooped them right onto a cookie sheet.  They came out great!  I added chocolate chips this time, can't wait to try them again with something different.  The possibilities are endless...

Just pulled these out of the oven and immediately after taking a bite had to come write a glowing review.  They're fluffy, with a great texture and look just perfect.  I made mine two ways with rum raisins (raisins soaked in spiced rum), and with walnut and basil.  They are both absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making these again!

We love going to Molly's Tea room and having scones with hot tea. I wanted to try making my own....this recipe was perfect. I added dried strawberries and almonds. Next time I'm going to try adding bacon and cheddar cheese for a breakfast scone. Great recipe for a base and easy to follow.

Fantastic recipe!  Don't let its simplicity fool you.  Nice & light scones.  Edit: I eggwash the scones before placing in the oven.  Also, I substitute whipping cream for milk, which gives it a richer flavour (a la Empress Hotel scones).

I made these spur of the moment one morning and was very pleased with how easy it was and how simple the ingredients were. I used a King Arthur Scone pan and just spooned the dough in. They turned out wonderfully and I will definitely be making these in the future! Great with a little butter and honey, or even jam.

As some reviewers suggested I didn't use all the milk and egg mixture, only about half. I added almond and vanilla extract to the egg mixture I did use. Then added cinnamon and brown sugar to the leftover egg mixture and glazed the top with it. Patted brown sugar the the top after. Very tasty. I don't consider myself a baker, but felt very proud of these scones.

Simple and quick – even for a baking amateur like myself! 

Having the same issues with servings, as following the recipe to a T ended up with 3 baking sheets full of scones!! (Each scone measured 3 inches diameter.) But that's probably just my problem. LOL

Great with tea!  The scones are flaky and buttery, though I would cut back on the butter a bit and maybe cut it up into smaller chunks or grate them as one reviewer suggested.

I added chocolate chips and dried cherries (softened with boiling water for 3 min before draining, drying and using).  I also brushed with milk and sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking.  They are really delicious and this recipe is so easy.

I kept the recipe exactly the same and added 1 cup of fresh raspberries... they kinda got all mushed in, oops! Next time I will use frozen. Also added 1/3 cup of white chocolate chip chunks and sprinkle sugar over them before slipping in the oven. GREAT RECIPE!

This recipe helped me to master scones on my very first attempt.
I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and added 1 cup of chocolate chips.
I can't wait to try more additions!!!

Great Recipe! Super easy and all the ingredients are cupboard staples. Turned out delicious. Slightly crisp on the outside, fluffy like an American biscuit in the inside.  

I made these and used unsalted butter and used about a full teaspoon of salt (instead of 1/2tsp) to compensate. I also folded in some canned blueberries (an American thing) right after the egg and milk but didn't mix too well for fear of them ending up tough.

I cut them into smaller servings and got about 16-18 out of the batch.  Each being about 2in sq. I also sprinkled them with a bit of granulated sugar before baking.

They were a huge hit at the party.  They turned out great.  Not too sweet or salty and just the right amount of moisture in them that they could be eaten without the clotted cream.. by why would you not want the clotted cream?!

I am planning on making them again but this time going for a savory scone adding shredded sharp cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon instead of the blueberries.

Thanks so much for posting this! It is going in my personal recipe book.  Love it!

Great and SIMPLE recipe.  I did go by the suggestions and did not add all of the milk/egg mixture.  I did add cranberries, orange zest and 1/2 milk 1/2 oj.  The scones were moist and delicious with an orange glaze drizzled over the top.  I'm going to make ginger scones the next time and eventually try many of the flavor suggestions from fellow raters.

Made these for a "Royal Wedding Tea Party" the night before. They were great when hot, but a bit dry when they cooled. Served with clotted cream and raspberry preserves which spiced up the flavor, but by themselves, they were quite bland.

They were fantastic, I used 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/2 cup half and half with the egg like other reviewers although I used all of the egg/milk mixture and needed a little more flour due to stickiness I would do it the same way again, I am sure the flavor of these would not be the same if all the egg and milk were not used. I also added some orange rind and sprinkled some orange glaze on them as soon as they came out of the oven which made them very pretty and very tasty.

Chose this recipe as it used ingredients I already had. It could have tasted a bit more interesting, but this is a great simple recipe to start with. I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon for more interest. It makes more than 8 servings.

I liked these so much that I registered for this site! They're so easy to make, which is a huge plus for me since I've never made a scone in my life before this, and they were perfect - flaky, semisweet, and delicious. My husband and I actually ate them right out of the oven for dessert, along with some tea and honey, and that made for a very pleasant evening. The only problem was that I couldn't get him to STOP eating them (I believe he had 3), and I now realize that scones are a bit high in calories due to all the butter! For the second batch, I added a few small peach chunks for variety (canned - I just happened to have them here), and that was good too. Like a few others, I had to add a bit more flour than the recipe called for because I didn't see that you were only supposed to add the milk/egg mixture a little at a time until moist. They turned out fab anyway though!

I really love this recipe!  I like to make up a batch and keep it in the refrigerator and only take out a couple scones worth at a time and that way I have fresh made scones every morning without all the work.  I would classify these as biscuits rather than scones... that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5!

From reading what others said, I tried to get a handle on the wet dough situation but I still ended up with it... my solution was to add flour but of course that ended up with a floury taste after baking, and it took much more time for them to bake. They are also soft. I did add 1 tsp cinnamon and a half tsp vanilla, and the flavor of that is very good. They smell and taste great, just a little heavy. I will definitely try this recipe again, just a little more experimenting to get it right! :)

These were yummy! We added half whole wheat flour and half white flour. We also added one cup of chocolate chips. Just wonderful! The family gobbled them up. These are sure to be a favorite. There are so many things you can add to the basic recipe!

Delicious!  I added mini cinnamon chips and made small scones.  Added my Mom's recipe for clotted cream and it was a hit.

Yummy. I added dates, nutmeg and cardamom. I used my pastry cutter to blend the butter into the flour. Also, since I'm more used to round scones, I just formed these into balls, pressed them down a bit and backed. I've made these several times now and they've turned out great!

yum yum! much better than the store bought ones. I can never find a good one. Mine turned out so light, moist and with great taste. I used salted butter and still keep to the amount of salt recipe called for. It was great, I love it...the sweetness and hint of saltiness. Everything I was looking for. Except I was worried when the dough turned out a little too wet. I hardly kneaded(but I guess that's the trick for scones-not to overknead). Definitely a keeper. Thanks.

These are definitely the nicest scones I have made!, and the whole family really enjoyed them.  However, I made double mixture and put all the egg and milk mixture in at once (didn't read others reviews before I made them!), and had to add lots more flour to get to the right consistency before cutting.  I made small ones (around 30no.) and I cooked them for around 8-10 minutes and on 175 fan assisted.  I have struggled to find a good scone recipe before, so this will become a firm favourite. Thanks!.

I don't know what I did wrong - but these scones started to burn in my oven after 5 minutes - they did not taste very burnt - but a little - Any help would be appreciated - maybe cook them at 375 for longer?  I added chocolate chips (in the dough)  and blueberries (byt poking them in the top) - If you have any suggestions - I would love to hear

I made these as part of a Fathers day breakfast for hubby.  I added raisins.  We ate them with fresh strawberries and peaches.  They tasted great together.

Really easy and delicious. I don't have a food processor, I did the whole thing with a pastry blender. Butter was from the fridge, not frozen. Used half-and-half with a bit of vinegar instead of sour cream, as I didn't have any, and added dried mixed fruit (blueberries, cranberries, cherries). Turned out great! Definitely going to make again.

These were awesome!  I followed the advice of one of the reviewers that said to use the egg and milk mix until the dough is moistened (you won't necessarily use all of it).  I used fresh chives and shredded cheddar.  My kids loved these, so we are also going to do a blueberry/lemon and raspberry/white chocolate version...

this is a fantastic recipe! i followed the hints about the egg and adding the milk to make 1 cup and it was perfect. i had a tea party with some friends and they went crazy for them. i added a teaspoon of cinnamon and if i had more time i would have loved to add some walnuts or almonds. but this is a great basic recipe that can have additions of anything you are in the mood for. looking forward to making these again

I tried this recipe since it seemed the closest to an old recipe I had whcih I had lost. They came out yummy! The only thing I did different is substitute lowfat buttermilk for the milk and added a dash of cinnamon. My husband even liked them and he is not a scone person. Thanks for sharing!

These are fantastic. My sister made them for me a few weekends ago and I needed to make more. I really like substituting a half cup of orange juice for a half cup of milk. This recipe makes it very easy to add any kind of fruit, nuts, spices to make your perfect scone. My favorite is adding dried prunes, chocolate chips and cinnamon!

I initially had a gooey mess!  I left the dough out and came back several hours later and it was much better.  I think the problem was that I melted the butter to make it easier to stir in.  SOFTEN the butter, but don't allow it to melt!

These were great, they had wonderful texture and a lovely crispy top!  I just cubed butter out of the fridge and worked it into the dry ingredients with my hands.  I slowly added the wet ingredients and reserved a little at the end so I could dip the tops of the scones in them before baking.  I thought the dough was a little bland, next time I will add a bit more salt and sugar.

My first attempt at scones- very successful!  I made two batches.  I froze the sticks of butter then grated it into the dry ingredients.  In the first batch I added 3/4 cup finely chopped walnuts and 1/8 cup of maple syrup to the dry ingredients (before the butter).   For the second batch I added 1.5 cups blueberries after I added the butter.  The blueberry batter was pretty wet but it baked up great.

This was a great recipe!  I'm not much of a baker but this was beginner friendly. Instead of using a whole cup of milk, I used 1/2 cup French Vanilla Creamer and 1/2 cup milk.  It made them incredibly moist. I also added chocolate chips.

So Delicious!  Came out great using the drop method but had to bake them almost twice as long.  The taste is fantastic.  I used just raisins and no nuts since I couldn't wait to make them and that is all I had readily available.  So yummy.  Having one with a cup of tea right now...

Great scone recipe - first scones I made myself. I do agree with the other comments about adding the milk and egg in another bowl then gradually adding it in until it is just wet enough. Made the recipe not as easy as it looked because it was up to your own personal judgement - but they tasted great and were gone within a day!

These are tasty, but not scones in MY opinion. I'm pretty picky about mine, I like them a little drier and denser. My first thought when I bit into these was "biscuit." They even had that strange Bisquick-y taste. BUT they still taste okay. I'll enjoy them, just keep looking for another scone recipe...

I used skim milk and cut out 2 tbsps of butter per batch.  I also added chocolate chips to 1 batch and dried cranberries to the 2nd batch and they were delicious, especially the cranberry ones!  I ended up with 24 large scones- they expand quite a bit during baking so be sure to space them out on the tray (I had to bake them for a few extra minutes due to the size but they didn't burn and came right off of the tray)  Tasty and easy recipe with ingredients already in your kitchen!

This is a great simple recipe! I have made this 2 X's now. First x i followed the recipe. Turn out yummy both x's! Second time I used 1 c of all purpose flour and 2 c of brown rice flour and added some ground flax also used  soy milk for a more healthy scone. Watch the amount of milk both x's the dough was a bit sticky. Next x I will reduce the milk. You also can cut down on butter or use oil to reduce the fat, like another reviewer posted. Good luck!

I was craving tea and scones and this recipe was the easiest and fastest I found.  It's really full proof.  In addition to the listed ingredients I added a capfull of vanilla, 2T of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  After I rolled them out I drizzled a mixture of brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon and water over them.  They took exactly 20 minutes to bake and turned out sooooo good!  I will be making these for years to come.  Enjoy!

I made these in a hurry one evening before the kids scattered to their various practices.  They were so tasty that they stuck around for more.  Very easy and turn out great every time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had no milk on hand, only eggnog, so I used that instead. Plus, I added vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and just a touch of ginger. I was very pleased with the result - very soft and crumbly, and so delicious. I will definitely used this base recipe again to try different flavor ideas.

These were great, just a little bit dry. Next time I'll add some fruit, and possibly use whole wheat flour to make it a little bit healthier.

This is the second scone recipe I've made. Super easy and delicious, I used only half of the milk/egg mixture, until the dough was moist and holding together. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I also added sugar to the top before baking them for 15 min. Great recipe!

These were really yummy! In order to make it somewhat healthier I used spelt flour instead of the regular, and Smart Balance buttery spread in place of the butter. I did need to add more flour - but just enough to  be able to handle the dough - if you add too much the result will be a heavy scone. I then divided the dough in half (in order to satisfy everyone's taste) - to half I added chocolate chips and to half I added pumpkin pie spice, allspice and sliced almonds. I rolled the dough out pretty thick and then cut with a cookie cutter. I sprinkled white sugar on the chocolate chip ones before baking and brown sugar on the pumkin ones. They came out delish - nice and not too heavy, like other ones I have made.

Really good basic scone recipe.  I did reduce the baking powder to 3tsp instead of the 5tsp stated.  They rose beautifully.  And I did need to use a bit more than the cup of milk stated to get it to bind.  Forgot to add - I made these into small round scones (used a round pastry cutter) and the recipe made 20 small scones.

This recipe is so delicious and easy.  Very delicate crumb.  Only changes I made were that I used 2/3 cup half & half instead of milk and added a tsp of vanilla.  I also dusted the tops with sugar.  Didn't have to grease the baking sheet either.  Next time I'll try cranberries or maple syrup & walnuts. Like a previous reviewer, I cut my butter into the flour using my food processor in batches (small processor) and didn't handle the dough more than necessary to form the scones.  Very pleased with the results.

Just finished scarfing down one of these fresh out of the oven.  Yummy!  These are easy and I like the fact that they don't require buttermilk and therefore are a little healthier.  As others said, the dough is sticky but in my experience with other scone recipies, it always is.  Just flour your hands and surface well and don't worry about it.  Also I found that greasing the baking sheet is not necessary.  I did not use a non-stick sheet and did not have a problem with sticking.  My mom makes amazing scones and she always tells me not to over-work the dough, only knead it about 5-10 times and then leave it alone.  I added a cup of chopped hazelnuts and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Next time I'll try dried cranberries.  Delicious!

I used this recipe and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to it.  I did everything else just as directed, but the dough was way too sticky and thin, unlike most scone recipes I've tried.  When I put them in the oven they rose, but they all spread out a lot.  They still tasted ok, but the texture was very unscone-like.  It might be good as a cake or cookie... or something, but not a scone.

Wow! What a great scone made with either chocolate chips, plain, or with a nice jam! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and used 1/4 c of sugar and 1/4 cup of splenda - tasted wonderful and a little easier on the waist! A must try, will make many times again!

I just made these scones,and they were wonderful! I have never had a successful scone recipe before. These turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly, except I put cinnamon chips in half of the dough and mini peanut butter cups in the other half. They are great, I highly recommend them to everyone.

Very good and easy recipe! Following everyone's advice I decreased the milk (only adding enough to get the consistency I felt was good) and I added some cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, for me, baking time was more like 22 mins...

I love this recipe and it I get major compliments every time I make them. I add frozen bluberries or dried cranberries to the mix for added yumminess. Today I substituted the milk with orange juice and added dried cranberries. Delicious!! Probably my best scone yet. I also add a little bit of cinnamon to the recipe. 

I just do drop scones to cut down on time and the recipe is great as is if you're not kneading and cutting into wedges. I'd say the dough is a little sticky for that.

I had to reduce the milk content coz it makes the dough too moist/soft. Otherwise, it's really easy to make & quite delicious. Try adding some sultanas and nuts for varieties.

I'm only giving this recipe a 4 because of texture during prep. It's WAYYY too  sticky and it was only remedied by adding over a cup of flour. However, the taste is SUPERB. I added 1 teaspoon cardamom, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4tsp cloves, plus upped the sugar to 3/4cup. Wondeful wonderful taste, especially with strawberry preserves smeared on top!

Delicious! We made some with raisins and about 2 tsps of cinnamon. These are also good with apricot jam on top. Yum!

The appearance was really good but the taste was more like a biscuit. It was good right out of the oven but after a day, it was kind of dry. *note* use 1/2 c milk instead of the whole 1 cup.

I think this a great recipe.... originally the dough will be sticky...you just need to add a few tablespoons of flour while kneading and it turns out great! I added raisins and cinammon for one recipe and cranberries & pumpkin spice for another...beautiful!

These were fabulous.  Easy to make and they are so tasty.  Even the next day!  I added mini chocolate chips and they are more of a desert than a breakfast item.  So good!  The only scone recipe I think I'll use from now on.

Dough was too wet and sticky, and impossible to roll out and cut unless MUCH more flour was added.  If I decide to try this one again I will subtract a few tablespoons of the milk.  The only reason why I might try it again is the large number of positive reviews.... oh well!

Good, but I made mine with modifications - cut back the butter to 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp, the end scone will be much lighter and airier.  Also, slightly less than 1 cup of milk will make it less sticky.  I had to bake mine at 400 for about 30 minutes, or even longer.

So easy, and turned out perfectly! I used only half the recipe (but keep the 1 egg), and just needed to add a little extra flour for keading. Thanks!

very good recipe, we didnt have any problems w/it being sticky...I made have recipe, and still got 8 scones, they were the perfect size for us, we ate them with honey-butter...Next time I may try adding something like dry fruit or choc chips, but they were really good plain.

I make this often for meetings at the office- they rave about them!  I divide the dough in half before kneeding, and generously add chocolate chips to one and either dried cranberries and white chocolate or dried blueberries or chopped nuts (almonds or walnuts) to the other half.  

The only thing I do different than the base recipe is cut them smaller for cooking- it's better for groups of people.

These were good. I made according to thye recipe using skim milk. I also added 1 cup of blackberries. They were really huge and I think next time I would divide dough in half and flatten, making each into 6 wedges(12scones). Also would be prettier if brushed with some milk and sprinkled on sugar before baking.

This was a great recipe! I divided the mix into two rounds and added cinnamon sugar to one half, and a cup of cheese and scallions with a pinch of salt to the other half. I also cut each round into eight wedges, otherwise the wedges would have been too big. They were wonderful!!

The texture on these is so perfect, and they are super easy to make vegan with just egg replacer and earth balance margarine. Every time I make them I add something new, cinnamon and lemon essence, cheese and garlic, etc. and they always turn out lovely.

It's...OK.  The dough tastes great, but after it has been baked the scones are really dry and blane. Bluk! 
  Great when dunked into coffee however!
 But I was looking for something a little more moist, and this one is not it.

everyone loved these so much. i even used skim milk only and had no complaints. imagine how great they'd be with whole milk or half and half! i added 2 cups of raisins and it was the perfect amount for the recipe. my family ate them plain, not even warmed up or buttered. i've made them twice in a day already!

Wonderful, quick and easy!  I used buttermilk instead of milk.  I added a couple of T. fresh lemon juice, grated lemon peel and poppyseeds.  I added a glaze of powdered sugar mixed with lemon juice - yum!  The dough is sticky, but workable - key is to not overwork the dough.  I used 1 c. butter and after cutting in the butter, I made a well in the center and added the liquid mixture.  Gently folding in the flour to mix, then finished by kneading lightly and patting out into a circle.  Worked perfect - light and flaky!  Thank you.

This was my first attempt at making scones- yum!  I left them plain for my first try (will try blueberries next time) and drizzled them w/ the vanilla glaze recipe from this site.  Served warm w/ homemade raspberry jam to my hubby this morning.  Will make again and again!

Oh my goodness!  These are great.  I cut down the baking powder to 3 tsp. and used half heavy cream, and half skim milk.  Took awhile to come together, but once they did, it was fine.  I added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, and then threw in some dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Came out fantastic.  Not too dry like scones usually are.  I can't wait to surprise my boyfriend with these when he gets home.

This recipe was very easy to make, but I found that the dough was much too sticky and the taste ended up being much too bland.  I did add brown sugar and cinnamon, but it really didn't make much of a difference in the lack of taste.  I won't be making them again.

I made these today because my recipe calls for whipping cream and I was out. For starters the dough was so sticky I had to add almost two more cups of flour. I added raisins and rolled and cut them out into rounds and they made more than 2 dozen. They weren't as sweet as my other recipe makes but that is probably due to the fact I had to add so much more flour.

Excellent recipe. I was able to reduce the butter slightly and use a bit less of the egg/milk mixture (a great suggestion from other reviewers), and they were quite nice and light. I used some of the remaining egg/milk mix to brush the tops before baking, too.

Great recipe! I think next time I will try 4 tsp of baking powder (instead of 5) as these seemed to come out with a "muffin-like" texture. Excellent taste!! I added blueberries and will make them with craisins next time!

I added the zest of one orange and about 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips. The finished product was very good, but the dough was very sticky while making them. I added quite a bit more flour to make it manageable. I also cut them into more than 8 wedges otherwise they were too big. I had never made scones before and was suprised at how well they turned out. Looking forward to making more- maybe with cranberries.

Made these with 4 teaspoons of baking powder, because another scone recipe I have requires that.  Also, used 1/2 shortening & 1/2 butter.  Also, added cinnamon to the dough & sprinkled with granulated sugar.  Quite delicious!  Since the dough was really wet (humid today), I just dropped them on a cookie sheet.  SO easy!  My 4 yr old & 6 yr old plus my husband said to keep the recipe!   I think I'll try cinnamon chips next time....and maybe a pwdered sugar glaze.   Yummy!

I have never made scones before, but these turned out excellent!  I added 1 cup of thawed blueberries and they were so good!  I also just dropped the dough onto a cookie sheet.  Can't stop eating these...

Oh my goodness!!!!  I have never had a scone before in my life so i don't know if these are how scones are supposed to taste but...they turned out absolutely delicious!!!  They practically melt in your mouth and have a rich buttery flavor.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was what I was looking for.  The most delicious scones.  Made it again with 3/4 c whole wheat flour and it still came out delicious and  light.  Couldn't stop eating them.  Can't make them too often because I'm on weight watchers.

These scones are simply the BEST !  My husband
loves them with tea and all my family keeps asking to just bake them and nothing else! 
Great with jams or alone.

Fabulous!  The scones are HUGE when cut in 8's--you might want to cut in 16's.  I added raisins to mine and they turned out great.  Will definitely become a family favorite!!

These scones are delicious and easy to make. I made half of the dough with
cinnamon and raisins and the other half with orange zest and dried cranberries.
Both turned out awesome!

Not bad, flaky consistancy.  More like an Irish soda bread taste than anything else.  I made 1/2 batter plain, and 1/2 with frozen blueberries.  I think I like the blueberries better.  I only used 3/4 c. liquid (FF half & half).  I might make again.

These were excellent.  Very tender and moist.  I added two teaspoons cinnamon, one diced granny smith apple and a cup of golden raisins to mine.  I also used half n half for the milk.  Delicious!

This was my first attempt at making Scones.  They are easy to make and taste really great!!!  My hubby even ate one for breakfast.  My 4 year old daughter keeps asking for more.. I can't wait to add something to them next time.  I do agree that they are a little big, I think next time I will start with two circles, and I will use my food processor for incorporating the butter into the flour.

Thought these were EXCELLENT - I like 'em sweet so I added about 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, and I didn't roll them out. I just dropped the dough onto the baking dish by well-rounded spoonfuls to make 12 scones. That made it easier and quicker, too. I'll be making these again and again!

Thank you! I made these for my family at Christmas. My mother and I are big cranberry fans, so I simply added some fresh cranberries! (I imagine that they may be a bit sweet without the tartness of the cranberries.) My mother was so thrilled with the result!  I made them with milk, and they were perfectly flaky, great texture overall, beautiful! I think that I will make more, smaller ones next time, as others have suggested.

Wonderful, easy tasty scones. I took a prior suggestion and add a cup of cinnamon chips, and rolled to a large rectangle to make approx 30.  I did a second batch with a cup of blueberries.  They didn't last the morning in my office

I just pulled a tray of these out of my oven and YUM! I added 1 cup of Hershey's Cinnamon Chips to the batter and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar before baking. I found the dough to be very, very wet. I spinkled a piece of wax paper with flour, put the dough on that and sprinkled it with flour; then topped it with another piece of wax paper. I patted it into a large rectangle and cut it into approx 30 2"x3" triangles. Eight wedges would have been huge!!

Yes, this dough was a bit too sticky.  Yes, it was also a bit sweet.  They were also fluffy, and crunchy, and buttery, and YUMMY!  I added chocolate chips to please my family.  Next time I'll try dried fruit.  Thanks!

This recipie made good scones. I just dropped them on the pan instead of kneading. Tasted a little like shortcake to me. Next time I think I will try them with fresh strawberres and whipped cream on top, instead of jam. Husband a son both liked them.  (But insisted on calling them biscuits)

This came together really quickly, but the batter was way too sticky and wet to knead.  I think that 1 cup of milk is too much.  I just dropped the scones by spoon onto greased baking sheets.  Other than that, they were great!

Amazing recipe, i use it every time i make scones for stew.
However, the recipe adjustment tool is flawed yet entertaining. I wanted to make 20 scones. So i entered in how much i wanted to make. Then 7 cups. Of. Flower... came up and i just got to making... it wasn't till i used my largest bowl i have to store the dough that i realized i had made to much. So i kinda had to made all of it by this point... so now i have 50 or so scones... now.. definitely going to go visit some friends now.

To much sugar, can cut down by ¼ cup.
Substitute milk with ½ & ½ more moisture to it.

I made this for the first time a couple of months ago.  I have never been much of a Baker but made these for my wife. The first two times I substituted self rising flour and they came out very tasty. I love scones because they are less sweet than most cookies. The last batch I made with all purpose flour and added dried cranberries. It was a little sweeter but everyone loved them.

I followed the recipe with the adjustment of 1/2c of heavy cream and 1/2 c of whole milk. I added 1/2 c of chopped pecans and 1/2 c of dried juice infused cranberries!  They came out wonderful.

THERE IS NO BAKING SODA in this recipe. You're  missing out on a fabulous recipe if you use the wrong ingredients! These come out perfectly using the: egg + milk = 1 cup, trick.

My hubby is a pretty conservative eater, and when I said I was making scones, he got THAT look on his face.  He is now eating his third scone and asking why I didn't make them more often.  I always read reviews for tips and suggestions, and this time, made the mistake of following one that is prevalent.  I added the egg to the cup and then equal to 1 cup milk.  Waaaaay too dry.  I had to scrape it up again and add more milk.  I admit it is easier to add more milk than to take it away.  I omitted the salt because I had salted butter, and used brown sugar instead of white and about a tsp of cinnamon.  Next time, and there will be many next times, I want to add dried fruit, coconut, lemon juice, and/or the puree of tiny sour mandarin oranges that grow here in Guatemala.  They are full of flavor, but are very sour, so I blend a couple in my blender and go from there.  Can't wait.  Thank you so much for this great basic recipe.

I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 teaspoons of vanilla (to the egg and milk) and another half cup of sugar. OMG!!!  The mixture was really wet so I spooned it onto parchment paper with a tablespoonful. It was sooooo good. My grandson has been sneaking them all morning.

This is a great basic scone recipe, which allows you to eat these as is or add unique flavors. I added 2 tsp cinnamon to my flour mix. Then I pulsed in the butter using a food processor. I then turned that out into a bowl and added 1/2 cup of half and half and 1/2 cup milk to my beaten egg and slowly poured that in as I mixed the dough, until moist. I used maybe half of the dairy mixture. Do not use all of it or you will end up with pancakes! I then folded in a 1/2 cup of chopped black walnuts. I rolled them out and cut them into circles. I ended up with 20 scones. I cut them in half and topped them with a homemade fall harvest jelly (peach base with cinnamon and cloves added) and finished them with whipped cream. They were a hit!

I made it as is. My family devoured them! Very good with butter and jam. Equally as good slopping up the over easy eggs. Mmm.  These are more light and fluffy. If you like a more dense scone, these are not for you.

Was very yum, but I had to put in another cup (perhaps a little more) additional flour, and did not use the whole egg and milk mixture.

This is the second time i made these scones. Both times they turned out perfect. I added a cup of fresh blueberries which I gently folded in while I was spreading. It out to cut into pieces for baking. When I removed from oven I sprinkled a bit of sugar and cinnamon on top. Delicious!

Not scones. Chewy texture, taste like baking powder and sugar. I agree with the previous review,  they're like pancakes or something. Nope.

I used half and half instead of milk. The family loved these for Sunday breakfast. They taste delicious. The only downside is mine didn’t hold their shape and spread out a bit.

Great recipe. Easy, successful the first time around. I added lemon zest and raisins to the dry ingredients and then mixed in the milk mixture. My English mom was impressed and enjoyed them. :)

I love this recipe. I make them exactly as described and serve them as one would strawberry shortcake. My only negative comment is that no human could possibly prepare this in 10 minutes. Twenty is more realistic.

Best recipe ever. As usual I had to add and replace some stuff but it still turned out perfectly. I mean better than bakery scone. I used 3/4 of gluten free pre mix flour mostly rice. I added 1/2 sugar more and dumped a lot of rhubarb with cinnamon and orange oil . Instead of milk I used kefir. I rolled dough in sugar instead flour. Thank you. I plan to use this base recipe for variety of scones and biscuits.

I changed the 1/2 cup sugar to 1/3 cup sugar. And buttermilk instead of milk. These are wonderful.  I have been trying different recipes for the last month.  This one is it!  I live alone and so I froze them right after I cut them out. I baked 4 of them this morning from frozen for about 17 minutes at 425 degrees.  Fluffy on inside, crunchy on outside and nice high rise.

I used 1/4 cup of splenda blend in place of sugar . I also add the whole egg and use only 3/4 cup of milk. I divided the dough in half made two rounds and cut each into eight pieces, then baked them for about 10 mintues or so. They were very good although they were a little to sweet for me. Next time a will cut the splenda blend back to 2 tablespoons.

These were so good!! I did add about a tsp. of cinnamon and allspice, 1/2 tsp. of cloves, and 1 tablespoon of nutella. The flavor reminded me of puerquitos, which is a type of Mexican sweet bread usually accompanied by coffee. I'd never made scones before so I didn't really know what to expect, but they came out fluffy and were very easy to make.

This is an excellent scone recipe that I make often. It works well with white or whole wheat flour or a combination. I love to add white chocolate chips and craisins and a glaze on top, my husband likes this recipe with some dark chocolate added. These also freeze well, I like to grab one from the freezer in the morning and it’s just perfect by break time.

I don't think 5tsp of baking powder is right, they came out very bitter and tasting like like the powder.  From what I have researched since biting into the scones, it looks like most recommend a 1tsp baking powder per 1 cup flour ratio. They looked and smelled great but I could not get past that taste.

Makes large, fluffy scones.  I used a combo of heavy cream and buttermilk that gave a great flavor, as well as dried blueberries, raisins, and pecans in the dough.  These are quite large, so you could do a half recipe and make smaller scones if you wanted to.

I used 2 cups white flour and one cup whole wheat. I used mini chocolate chips and walnuts instead of raisins. They were great. I made them two times in one week. My husband who doesn’t even like sweets, couldn’t get enough of them.

I liked this recipe and am glad I made them. In my opinion, they were too sweet, but perfect otherwise. I added some diced onion and some cheddar cheese, which added a good savory touch to our lunch.

Very disappointing, the powder resulted in too soft a scone, there was no real texture.  I'm used to using baking soda, not powder.  Buttermilk should be used as well.  Edible, but don't waste your clotted cream and jam.  Pretend they are triangle pancakes instead and add maple syrup.

TOO MUCH BAKING POWDER. A much larger REAL scone recipe only requires 2tsp baking powder MAX. I’ve made this three times and all three times it’s terrible. 400 is too hot and will burn the scones. This is more like a soda bread texture. I’ve put dates in it, blueberries, and left them plain. I am seriously disappointed. Don’t make these just because it’s an easier recipe— lots of better ones out there. Truly terrible tasting scones. :(

Wet ingredients:Add 2 teaspoon vanilla to one beaten egg. Use enough coconut milk to bring to just shy of one cup total fluid.Gluten free and dairy free version:Same as above for wet ingredients. Use Bob’s Red Mill 1 to 1 flour replacement, and Earth Balance butter replacement spread to replace butter.

These scones are delicious! I didn't have salt but the scones still ended up super soft, light and the perfect amount of sweetness. I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, but next time I'll add something closer to half a cup.:) I''m definitely going to be making these again!

These turned out so well! I used 3 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda in the dry mix. Grated 1/2 C (1 stick) frozen unsalted butter into dry mix. Used 1/2 C milk, 1/2 C heavy whipping cream and 1 tsp of vanilla. Used parchment paper and 19 minutes in our slow oven made delicious crusty scones with tender center. Thank you for the recipe!

Very easy to make. Very tasty. Light and fluffy not heavy at all. I added fresh blueberries while I lightly kneaded it and they did great. I cut them a little large so I cooked them a little longer.

Perfect as is.

We have an egg allergy in the house, so I substitute by sauteing 1 grated apple with 1/4 tsp baking soda. After it stops bubbling, I throw that in with the liquids, then add to the flour/butter mixture and continue as instructed. In general, due to the added liquid, I bake for a total of 18 mins.

Loved these scones. I used a food processor (hate cutting in butter) and added golden raisins and pecans for my first try (served w/orange marmalade), blueberry pecan for my second. Delicious!

First time making scones from scratch. This recipe didn’t disappoint! They turned out yummy and got compliments. I did look at other reviewers and decided to add 2 teaspoons  cinnamon and raisins.  Also I used only about ¾ of the milk mixture.

I used half the amount of baking powder after reading other reviews and these turned out great. Not sure about other comments saying these were less biscuity and more 'cakey' these turned out exactly as an English scone should. I added raisins to the mix (didn't measure, just went on feel) and they are fab.

I used the egg in a measuring up and adding the milk to the 1 cup line and it came out wonderful and fluffy. The dough sticky and not quite 'kneadable', but I just formed a flat disk and baked it.  Added Craisins for some excitement.

First time ever tried these scones. Please do reduce the amount of Baking Powder, I used 2 teaspoons, even then it was slightly caustic. I halved the recipe into savory and sweet scones... both came out good... and my sweet scones were perfect with my homemade berry jams :)

I definitely had to add flour to this recipe. Was waaaay too sticky of a dough. But after I did they were perfect. But even before i added flour, this recip made way more than 8 scones. Maybe i was using a small cutter but i came out with 24 scones.

I also followed the tips other bakers mentioned (1 egg cracked in a cup and added the milk and half & half ... I didn't exceed 1 cup)

I divided the dough into 2 and added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries to each.

I rolled out each ball and cut into 8  pieces- so 16 triangles in total.

While waiting for the first batch to bake, I put the 2nd batch in the fridge  to keep cold.

Both trays of scones were finished in a few hours.

I will definitely make these again!

I added dried cranberries and orange essential oil but I don't think it had enough orange so next time I'll use zest and oil. This is a great base recipe and adding your own flavors is fun and easy. Don't be afraid of all the butter.

These are super sweet, so next time I will cut the sugar content in half. I usually add cheese to my scones so the sweet and savoury doesn't quite work. Even for "sweet" scones this is a bit too much sugar. 

I rubbed my butter in the flour by hand instead of "cutting", as this is how I was taught to make scones. Also agree with other comments that the mix was very wet, so had to add more flour too.

They seem pretty "heavy" too - not light and fluffy. But still tasty,

Taste good... I added currants. I may try to use sour cream or buttermilk next time...they were on the biscuit/cake side not in sweetness but in texture.  Still good though. I like the height I got on these.

I liked this recipe a lot.  I modified it by adding 2 t. of orange zest and 2-3 tablespoons of fresh orange juice and using 1 tablespoon less milk. I also made a sort of glaze for the top with 2 tablespoons of orange juice and 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar.

WOOZA! So yummy and not like the store bought rocks! Easy to make and I added fruit to some and chocolate chips to others! I also made Devonshire Cream and used the left over heavy cream from that instead of the milk.

These are absolutely fantastic and are still pretty decent the next day. The only change I made was cracking the egg in a measuring cup and filling it with milk up to one cup instead of using a full cup of milk. We ate them plain, with butter, or with strawberry jam. SOOOOOO good!

Best advise was to mix dry ingredients first and then slowly add the premixed wet ingredients to get the correct consistency.
added dates and had a winner.
Someone suggested buttermilk as a substitute for milk which I will try in the future.

I won't make this recipe again. I was too lazy to pull out my British grandmothers cookbook, so googled this. The dough is soooo wet, not dough anything like a scone. Feel like I wasted my ingredients. I've been baking for over 50 years, always to perfection, this is only the second worst baking event of my life. I'm glad it was just for me and not company.

This is the first time I have ever made these scones! They were FANTASTIC! My guests kept raving about them. I read the reviews beforehand and made sure to make them with those suggestions in mind (the milk and egg in a separate cup and add slowly but not all of it). I also included 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. Will make these again! Super easy!

Dough was very wet. Needed to add almost a full cup of extra flour. I generously floured work surface and carefully worked in extra flour till I could just touch dough without it sticking. 
Added 1 tsp butter flavor, 1/2cup chopped macadamia nuts, and 1 cup white chocolate chips.
Taste was good so I gave it two stars.

OMG! Best ever! Couple of changes I made - I used plain, non-fat Greek yogurt instead of the milk, decreased the amount of baking powder and butter, and sprinkled pie spice (cinnamon & vanilla sugar) on top before baking.  Will definitely be making these again!

I've made this a few times, exactly as the recipe states, and I love it!  So does everyone I've shared the scones with.  Personally, I like that it has a more moist texture than other scone recipes I've tried.  It's delicious all by itself, though my favorite is having it with lemon curd.

Tip:  When mixing the egg/milk mixture into the flour mixture, you may want to use your hands.  Flouring your hands will help the mixture not stick as much.

Woah! 5 tsp baking soda is waaay too much!! You gotta fix this - just 1 will do. Other than that, it's great -  i would have given it 5 stars if not for the wrong baking powder amount. Also, don't use all the milk n eggs mixture, or the batter will end up too wet. Maybe it's understood, but perhaps it should be mentioned.

These scones were great. I’ve found that they can be turned into great orange chocolate chip scones if you add the zest of an orange (or two tangerines), a bit of orange juice (I tend to do 1 tangerine worth or half an orange, just make sure to add some extra flour), and 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips.

This baked up OK but is quite cakey and not crumbly. I followed the recipe amounts save for a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract. It might be improved once they are cold & warmed again but when they are just cool enough to eat they are not really the greatest and taste more like pancake than they do scones. Might be improved with icing or adding fruit or a second spice (ground red pepper, pepper, cinnamon maybe) but I don't have those here and didn't want to add too many extra things the first rattle out of the box so :/

Excellent and easy recipe! I took the suggestion to add cinnamon and they turned out great! I also added a tbsp of vinegar to sour the milk (I removed a tbsp of milk to maintain the liquid balance). Before adding the butter I cut it into thin chunks and put it into the freezer until the last second. Don’t overwork the dough, you don’t want the butter to melt.

I used powdered sugar because I didn't have anything else.  I added a diced small apple, a bunch of raisins and pecans.  Butter flavored organic shortening, almond milk in the dough. Brushed with milk (dairy), sprinkled with a little sparkle sugar and a dusting of cinnamon.  Baked 27 minutes.  Delicate crust and tender crumb.  Best scone I ever had.

Okay just made this today for St Patrick’s Day...very yummy. I added  the rind of an orange and a half of the juice of a squeezed orange...and less milk.  Also added a handful of raisins and coated the top with some left over egg and milk, sprinkled a little sugar on top and into the oven. Made 15. Very delicious! 
With tea of course

Live in Spain now and this is a great recipe as a Scotsman easy to follow and followed exactly  as  the history of scones was Scone (/sku?n/ (About this sound listen)) (Scots: Scuin, Scottish Gaelic: Sgàin) in Scotland, the ancient capital of that country – where Scottish monarchs were still crowned, even after the capital was moved to Perth, then to Edinburgh (and on whose Stone of Scone the monarchs of the United Kingdom are still crowned today).[scone was round and flat, usually as large as a medium-sized plate. It was made with unleavened oats and baked on a griddle (or girdle, in Scots), then cut into triangular sections for serving. Today, many would call the large round cake a bannock, and call the triangles scones. these were great next time will add some raisins or dates, but still best with clotted cream and Strawberry Jam.SCONE as in GONE.

I added about 1/2 cup raisins, 1tsp roasted cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp orange extract. I made them in a toaster oven, which worked fine. I think sifting the flour (after measuring) makes them a bit lighter.

These are sooo good, I added some butterscotch chips to the dough and then brushed the tops with some of the milk & egg ,then sprinkled them with some Raw  Cane sugar . I  made the dough a little too thick  so the scone wasn`t quite done in  the original baking time  so I baked them till golden . Next time I will make them a little thinner ,otherwise they were DELICIOUS.

These worked fine as a vehicle to get lemon curd into my face, but that is about all I can say in their favor. The flavor was fine, but I think that had more to do with the lemon zest and blueberries I added than the actual recipe. The main problem with these was the weird cakey texture. They are not scones at all. There was way too much leavening and liquid, and they just turned out weird.

I followed the recipe exactly and added 3 Tblsp lemon juice, 2 tsp poppy seeds and 1/2 cup dried cranberries.  I took them to a brunch and they didn't last 30 minutes!  Came home and made another batch right away.
tip:  sift baking powder so that it distributes evenly thru the dough.  Fabulous, easy recipe.

These are really good and easy to make. I did not read the tips beforehand and wound up pouring all of the egg/milk mixture in. Whoops! The dough was a bit wet and sticky, but I was able to drop them on the baking sheet. Had to cook a little longer, but they turned out well. Made some whipped cream to top them off and added fresh strawberries on it too. Yummy!

I added a bit more sugar, and around 1/2 cup of flour for consistency. I also substituted butter for shortening, as it was what I had on hand. They were super soft and light. Definitely what I look for in a scone.

This is more of a biscuit recipe rather than a scone.  It's very light and fluffy rather than more dense like a scone.  I followed the advice of putting the egg in my measuring cup then adding the milk and half and half, but I still threw out more than a quarter cup of the mixture. Despite adding orange peel, mini chocolate chips, chopped apricots and craisins, it's still lacking a bit in the flavor department. There are better scone recipes out there.

Just made this but I must say they are way too brittle and crumble.  My guess is that 5 tspn of baking powder is way too much for 3 cups of flour.  Taste good though you can't spread them or pick them up without them collapsing.  Did everything according to the recipe but next time, I will cut back the BP.

Split dough in half. Stirred in chocolate chips in one half. Other half dried cranberries and chopped canned mandarin oranges, extra liquid from oranges kept it super moist and hydrated cranberry just enough. Make a light frosting with some more of the orange liquid, perfect treat for family day.

I totally recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a quick and easy scones recipe. Tip: cut your butter into cubes and then freeze it (easier to work with when incorporated into the batter plus it won’t melt as quickly when baked). Also, I would use an egg wash instead of milk because it makes the top crunchier and adds a puff pastry like texture. It’s really soft and cakey overall and a sure winner at an tea party!

I made these gluten free, and they were amazing!
I really didn't change anything about the recipe, other than using Namaste Perfect Flour Blend (it's a mixture of gluten free flours with xanthan gum) instead of regular flour, and using 3/4 tsp of extra xanthan gum (1/4 tsp per cup of flour, to help imitate gluten's positive baking qualities).  
(I just remembered that I only had a stick of butter, so I used it, plus a 1/4 cup of shortening to equal the 3/4 cup that the recipe calls for.  I thought that since I basically use a 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening mix for cookies and pie crust, I could also use a mixture for scones, and it worked really well. 
 I'll probably do this on purpose in the future.)
I also did not need the entire wet mixture, just like the recipe, and other reviewers, mentioned.  I probably had close to a 1/2 cup that I didn't use.
15 minutes was perfect.  They held their shape, and were flaky,  golden crisp on the bottom, and soft on the inside.   I did divide the dough before kneading, so that I could do half of the recipe plain, and half with raisins.  
I made an optional glaze to drizzle over the top with powdered sugar, a pinch of salt, vanilla, triple sec, and milk- I felt that it completed the taste for what I was craving.  I will definitely be making these again!

I used this recipe for my first time making scones, I read other reviews and decided to add 2 tsp cinnamon, as well as adding a litte bit of liquid at a time until it was the right consistency.  Also, I actually used vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk and it worked great!

Yes I'd make it again. and next time I might put a little more sugar, or put some cereal in it. I feel like that would be interesting.  or get something else, like some fruit, or other types of candy's.

My 11 year old made this recipe almost entirely by herself, with me offering guidance.  She grated frozen butter into the dry mix, stirred it in a bit to further break it up, and then divided the dry mix into two halves.  She mixed the milk and egg, divided that evenly into two wet measuring cups.  For one half, she added a teaspoon of lemon extract to the wet ingredients and 1/2 cup frozen blueberries to the dough.  For the other half she added a teaspoon of almond extract to the wet ingredients and 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips to the dough.  After baking (the blueberry took a little longer, because the frozen berries chill the dough), she glazed each round of scones with a powdered sugar glaze (almond extract in the chocolate chip one and lemon extract in the blueberry one) and sprinkled both with some toasted sliced almonds.  Both are delicious and she is very happy with her results!

This is a great recipe.  I've made it several times, adding raisins, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  Today I made them with orange zest, orange juice (replaced 1/4 cup of milk with juice from orange) and dried cranberries.  Delicious all times and pretty easy to make.

I've added lemon zest, extra vanilla, craisons, and other ingredients according to whim.  Never had a bad batch.  Try a citrus zest glaze - it takes it over the top.

Not sure what this was, but definitely not a scone. The dough was way too wet, and spread out during baking. Will not be using this recipe again!

I love this recipe! I have done it as is, as well I have done it adding all sorts of thing, like berries, rhubarb and raisins. Right now I have in the oven the recipe with cranberries and orange zest. I have also forwarded the recipe to numerous family members

This was very easy and turned out well!  I made it as the instructions read and added two teaspoons of cinnamon, which was the perfect amount.  I used very cold butter and whole milk.   I also cut them with a regular biscuit cutter instead of cutting them into wedges.  These were perfect with butter and jam, and I look forward to making them again!

I did the egg+milk=1 Cup thing, except I used 18% cream. I sprinkled them with sugar after an egg wash but I think what makes the difference is the TECHNIQUE. 

I learned that FOLDING the dough over  at least 3 times is part of making flaky layers. Use a BISCUIT CUTTER without rotating it after cutting to make the exposed sides which helps the biscuit to rise as opposed to wedges or drop batter style. 

They did need 20 min at about 375 rather than 400. They came out perfect. Not too crumbly and not too dense. They are fluffy and tasty. I served them with home made clotted cream and home made strawberry jelly.  I have made them a few times now and they are delicious. I will definitely make these again exactly the same way.

Had a craving for scones and used this recipe.  I couldn't be happier with the results. They were lighter than other scones I've had but my family liked them much more because of that.
I also had a craving for lemon lavender scones so I made just that change .  Reduced milk to make 1 cup with juice of one lemon and added the rind too.  Added  4 teaspoons lavender.  That's the only change I made and it was just wonderful.

I found the cup of milk was too much...I think I measured correctly.  I dumped the milk mixed with the egg in all at once.  Recommend adding slowly and mixing to ensure the proper consistency of the dough mixture.  I added raisons.  Otherwise a good recipe.

Wonderful! Instead of 5 tsp of baking powder, I did 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking  soda. I also added a handful of dried cranberries. Delicious!
Always remember, cutting in the butter means just that! Crumble it into the dry mix with your fingers or a mixer. Don't melt it or the mix will become like soup.

My family loved these.   We just made our first visit to the U.K. and wanted to try making scones here.   This recipe was a hit.   I added a hint of lemon zest.   I only had cake flour on hand so they were light and fluffy.   I would prefer to try them with regular, unbleached white flour but my husband liked them as is.   With the cake flour I would decrease the liquid.  I used 1/2 cup milk mixed with heavy cream.   Then I added 1/4 cup more, but it was too moist and I needed more cake flour.   This may differ with regular flour.   I would make this recipe again, and it seems versatile.

This was by far the best scone recipe I have made so far!! We like ours with clotted cream and jam. 

You need to break the egg in the measuring cup and add just enough milk and or half and half to equal  1 cup. I will have to try add ins next time I make them.

Dough was waaaaaaaaaaay too wet. I unfortunately added all the milk and egg mixture bcz the recipe didn't say to add it gradually.  I somehow managed to get them into the oven and will taste them...but I'm bummed. They look awful. Smell great though.

I found this recipe too wet and too sweet. Next time I will add less milk and only 1/4 cup of sugar. My husband loved it with 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup dates. 

Edit June 22 2018. Although it’s too weight, it’s my favourite to go scones recipe!

I never write a review but this was terrible. I knew not to put in the whole milk/egg combo but it was still really sticky and hard to work with. I guess I still put too much? This should be elaborated in directions. And there was way too much baking powder. It ended up having a really bitter aftertaste that someone else mentioned here. I don't know why. I will probably have to throw out the whole batch. Looks like a lot of people got good results though so go for it, just keep what I said in mind!

I used butter flavor crisco instead of butter and used my food processor to blend it in to the dry ingredients. I transferred it to a mixing bowl and died a handful of crashes. I stirred the egg / milk mixture in just until blended. Note: I too put the egg in a measuring glass with a couple drops of vanilla extract and orange essential oil and added milk to the 3/4 mark. It was the perfect amount of moisture. Baked as directed and glazed with a basic glaze recipe enhanced with a fed drops of orange essential oil. OMG! Moist, light, fluffy and melts in my mouth! The best scones I've made!! Ps...hubby can't get enough!

Great recipe, the only deviation from instructions I made was replace milk with cooking cream + water, as that's what I had available. 

I made one batch plane and one with cottage cheese filling, both turned out great. Next time I might reduce the amount of baking powder to 4 tea spoons as I could taste it a little.

Excellent recipe.  I only added the zest and juice of one orange to give it more flavor.  My DH has been asking for scones for some time, but I have never made them.  Personally  I have never enjoyed scones which I have only purchased in the past.  He insisted that whatever scones we buy are nothing like what he remembers from his childhood.  I made these and it was perfection.   I did roll them out a little thicker (about 1 1/2 inches) and let it bake for an extra 7 minutes.  Absolutely perfect.

Really easy and really yummy. I have made these a couple times, and added 2 tsp of cinnamon and a handful of raisins. In the second batch I made, I reduced the sugar a tad which to me tasted better. In both cases they disappeared quickly.

Yum! I made these and they reminded me of the Irish scones I loved when living overseas for 4 years. I would definitely recommend. I wanted a richer taste so I used cream instead of milk and it was an awesome sub!

Love this recipe!  I add the zest of 2-3 oranges, then make a glaze of orange juice, orange zest, butter, and powdered sugar.  It is delicious and one of my children's favorites!

Not a traditional Scottish scone but still pretty good. A little sweeter than what I am used to. Everyone still enjoyed them and they were very easy to make.

I've made scones for years and cooked scones for a very successful Tearoom. After following the recipe with precision and adding extra flour, the scones turned out too flat for a scone. The taste was so good but not the look of a scone. The recipe needs to be altered with more flour content.

Great basic recipe! Super easy to make and easily customizable. I added dried cranberries to mine. Big hit with the family!

Fantastic recipe. It turned out extremely tender and buttery. Next time I'd reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup as it was borderline too sweet for me.

Followed this recipe with another reviewer's recommendation of swapping out solely baking powder for the combination of baking soda, baking powder, and cream of tartar. The scones came out wonderfully! Light, fluffy, and with just a bit of sweetness! Will definitely make this again!

Made with 3/4 cup milk instead of the full cup (this is equivalent to adding the egg to your measuring cup as in other tips) and these were great. I don't think the extra milk would have ruined them, though. (Maybe others are sifting their flour or using extra large eggs to account for excess wetness?) We shaped the dough into simple animals for Groundhog Day, very cute with raisin faces. I stored them in foil and was surprised they lasted three days. I will keep this as my standard scone recipe.

I am always looking for a new quick recipe for scones. This recipe was perfect. I read all the reviews and used most of them. I added some dried cranberries and glazed half of them. This time I did a orange glaze next time I will try lemon. I split the dough in half, rolled out to about a half inch thick and cut into eight wedges. I like a smaller scone, and they seem to stay fresher longer. I froze half of the uncooked wedges for another day!  I take them straight from the freezer and bake them. Perfect for Sunday brunch!

Made my first version with lemon zest and poppy seeds. Also used glaze from another recipe to drizzle on top. Turned out delicious. Definitely making more with other additions.

They are perfect. Light, fluffy and delicious. I had made some lemon curd with lemons a friend gave me and it paired perfectly. My husband couldn't stop eating them. Next time I'm going put chopped dried apricots in them.

Easy and worked out beautifully. I doubled the recipe and it made 2 and a half dozen, 3" diameter circles, rolled 1/2" thick. I used a food processor to blend in the butter. Changed nothing!

My first time making scones. These are wonderful!  I don't bake very often so I read several of the reviews. I decided to cut the baking powder down to 4 tsp, added 1/3 c of chopped cranberries and some orange zest. I did cut them into wedges, next time I will make into rounds. Brushed with egg white, sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar on top and...wow! i could eat the whole batch! Will definitely keep and experiment with this. Thank you Donna!!

I love them! I'm not typically a fan of scones, but these were moist and light. I will definitely be making these again and again.

I didn't have any milk on hand so I used whipping cream.

Great scone recipe! Easy to jazz up with whatever you want to add. I infused tea into the milk mixture, and added walnuts to the basic recipe. I did use almond milk which meant that they didn't turn out as golden brown as they would have otherwise.

This scone is nice and flaky/crumbly, but there is a strong flavor of baking powder.  I'd cut the amount down.  I added cinnamon and cut up a peach in it, which helps mask the baking powder taste, but not enough.  I'd make it again, without or with less baking powder.

I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 1 because they still tasted decent despite not having accurate measurements, nor texture.

This recipe  creates a very wet dough, and I did use the tip everyone gave, of filling the measuring cup with an egg first, before topping it up with milk till it reaches the 1 cup mark. Despite this, the batter was still watery (like a dense cake batter) and I ended up having to top up about 1.5 cups of flour just to get it mildly malleable.crumb. Sure, it's still good enough to eat - but if you add enough sugar and butter, anything becomes edible.  It's more of a biscuit, and if you've had a proper scone before, you'd know the difference. 

I recommend using a proper British recipe - ideally one that does not use eggs. Eggs are a leavening agent on it's own, hence the cakey texture and tender crumb

I substituted self-rising flour for the four, baking powder and salt and changed the milk to half and half.  I also made sure I used COLD butter.  They turned out perfectly.  Nice simple flavor that goes well with coffee or tea. This recipe is a keeper.

I decided to make chocolate chip scones with this recipe. We had amazing, and delicious results at the end, but we had a small problem. When my mother and I were getting ready to kneed the dough, it was so runny, we couldn't even kneed it. So we made a second batch and ditched the first one. We made the dough, but it was extremely sticky, we had to put at least 2 cups of flour on it to kneed and roll it out. We seemed to manage through time, and got it right, and perfect. This is an awesome recipe to try, just put some more flour in.

my first time making anything resembling baked goods, and this recipe was super easy and quick to make. Added a touch of vanilla and lemon extract and some lemon zest just for flavor and also cooled off the butter in the freezer a bit just to make it easier to cube the 12tbsp of it and they came out melt in your mouth heaven! 

My daughter's, and my mouth thank you!
Will definitely be adding this to my go to recipe.

I found that using bread flour was better than plain flour. The scone with bread flour turned out a lot softer on the insider and crispier on the outside

This was my first time making scones and this recipe was perfect. I added a bit of vanilla to give it some taste. My only concern was mine turned out to be a bit crumbly when I tried to cut it in half. Other than that, it was amazing

Simple and delicious!  I omitted the salt, and I did not notice a difference.  Also knead as few times as possible (10 or less) to keep scones soft and moist.  Cutting this into eight pieces makes REALLY big scones.  I cut the prices in half again - great with Earl Grey and Devonshire cream!

Very easy to make, which is important for me since I'm not a baker. One previous reviewer had an important tip, reduce the amount of baking powder. I used one tablespoon only and while the scones raised a bit in the oven, they were still flaky and chewy. I made 3 batches, cinnamon raisin, dried cranberry and saskatoon berry.  NOTE: using frozen berries makes for a very wet dough, add a touch more flour.

Also...I did use all of the liquid in most cases but I very slowly poured it into my mixer, I think that made a different in the dough coming together.

Very easy, with amazing results! My family loves these scones.
As for changing the recipe, I use almond milk and substitute a medium-sized, peeled, shredded apple for half the butter. I think it resulted in a more cakey scone, but still, like I said, amazing.

use 1/2 c. yogurt and 1/2 c. milk add 1 tsp vanilla. Make 2 discs a 1/2 inch thick to make smaller scones. I disc scones are just too big. butter the tops and sprinkle with sugar before baking.

These are easy to make and super versatile. I used them as a base for my take on strawberry shortcake (instead of using strawberries, I use the 'waste' from rhubarb mix in the rhubarb lemonade recipe on this site) and they were fantastic.

Wonderful, buttery scones--I've made this three times already with enormous success, and this was the first time I baked anything from scratch, which shows how simple this recipe is!  I agree with some of the other reviewers, not all of the milk/egg mixture should be added into the dough at once; in fact, if you add the entire cup of milk, chances are the dough would be too wet to make nice, crumbly scones and you'd end up with a rather cakey mess instead (although...mmm, buttery cake...).  I think I used only 1/4 or 1/3 cup milk at most for each batch I made, pouring the milk/egg mixture into the dough a little at a time as I was kneading, just enough to get the dough moist. I also cut up the butter into tiny little pieces and kneaded them directly into the dough, and am so glad they turned out ok.  These warm scones are perfect with clotted cream and strong tea.

Made this and loved it.  I did alter it a bit though.  
I added a tsp or real vanilla extract, chocolate baking power and chocolate chips.
When done I garnished with a dusting of powered sugar and a swirl of chocolate syrup just before serving while it was still hot.

I cut in the butter with my Cuisinart food processor--the blades make it so easy. I've started making batches of the dry mix and freezing the bag with the wet recipe written in sharpe.  1c milk, 1 egg so I can give it to anyone to share. Amazingly easy to pull from the freezer, add the wet ingredients, put an egg wash on top and BOOM!  These scones are almost fail safe. 

Lemon Poppyseed variation: replace wet ingredients with organic lemon yogurt and the juice from a fresh organic lemon no egg), throw in 3 TBsp of poppy seeds, and they are equally amazing scones. Remember the egg wash for the top.

Though I cook often, this was my first time making scones, and I am lucky enough to look no further for some time. What a great recipe! I added about a tsp of vanilla, just for fun, and they turned out great!! Light, fluffy, and oh-so-tasty. 
My husband makes scone often, but they are often small, dense, and tasteless, or taste of baking powder. These are the opposite. 

As with any baked goods, I recommend not over-mixing the batter- only enough to mix ingredients well.... Same with kneading the dough, on this one.

I added raisins to a couple, and chocolate chips and craisins to others, as well as left some plain. They are all incredibly good.

Made this recipe exactly as written, and the scones turned out amazing!  Light, fluffy, delicious.  Will definitely be making them again :)

Next time I will add an egg or milk wash to gloss up the tops and sugar on top.   I will also use this as a base recipe and add different flavour combinations.

Contrary to some comments, I found this to be the perfect recipe after trying several other.
So really easy and absolutely delicious.
I just used heavy cream instead of milk, added vanilla extract and a handful of flour. I also kneaded and folded the dough 5 times: it gave a nice structure.
Perfect!

I used honey greek yogurt in place of the milk and they are insanely delicious! I also added 1/2 teaspoon good vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, and a heaping tablespoon of poppyseeds. I made a glaze of milk and powdered sugar and submerged each scone before putting on the cooling rack. They taste more like donuts than scones but everyone went nuts for them.

Excellent basic recipe.  I added orange zest and craisins (plumped). I also put the egg in the measuring cup before adding 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 cream.  I also allowed the scones to rest for 20 minutes on the parchment lined baking sheet to allow for better leavening. Wonderfully light, moist and flavorful!  Will use as my go to basic recipe and am looking forward to the possibilities.

I have made this for my family many times and each time is a hit! Every time, no matter how many mistakes or changes I made, it was just as good. I found it easiest making it in a food processor. First add dry, then butter, then milk and eggs. Then just knead for a bit before cutting into triangles. I am sure they  would taste amazing with cinnamon, cranberries or blueberries, but we like it the best plain with whipped cream and jam. Great recipe!!

I loved it. I also followed other recommendations- added cranberries and orange zest, and . used food processor to mix dry and cut in butter.

ok, so the butter was hard and I figured I would just cut it with a knife in small pieces, but then the stand mixer was having a hard time so I microwaved for 30 seconds.   some was melted but overall it was just soft.  the mixture was definitely too thin.  I actually think it was too thin before I even added the butter, so it made rather large scones as the batter was very sticky and should have been firmer.  The taste however was delicious.  I added blueberries at the end, and I will make this again-i'm giving it 5 because the taste was so good.

I followed the recipe exactly only subbing one cup whole wheat pastry flour because I ran out of white. I usually follow recipes as written the first time so I read this as written and put the whole egg/milk mixture in together. The dough was pretty sticky and I had to more than "lightly" flour my surface. The bake was nice, just a touch of brown. They were definitely cake like and not scone at all. I ate one because I just spent the time to make them.

Thank you for the easy and delicious recipe!  We left out the sugar and added 1/2 cup peach preserves.  Just a hint of sweetness the way we like it-a bit like a biscuit that's a bit sweet.

I did follow some of the other's suggestions and used 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup of milk and also added 1 tsp of cinnamon, just because I love cinnamon.  I also reduced the sugar by half.  Still wonderful.

Best scone recipe that I have found! Followed the recipe with the exception from 1 reviewer to put the egg in a measuring cup then add the rest milk (1/2c) & half & half (1/4c) & blend together.  I also added in craisins (1/3c).  I used a box grater to shred the cold butter into the flour mixture.  To mix the wet and dry ingredients together there was no way to mix it but with my hands to knead the dough.   It seemed to be getting a little too dry so I left a small amount of the flour mixture behind in the bowl when I took it out to shape the dough.  I made 2, 7-8" circles about a 1/2" thick & cut each round with a circular pizza cutter into 8 wedges.  The end result was 16 slightly buttery, perfectly delicious scones! Fantastic! Thank you so much for sharing!!

Tastes amazing served plain with Devonshire cream. I was able to make 16 fairly large pieces with the recipe. Only making 8 would have made them really large ( but they tasted so good I could have eaten a lot:))

I've been making these scones for a few years now, and they are always a huge success. This is the recipe people constantly ask me to share. Usually I make them plain, but I have added dried berries or raisins, or lemon zest, and they always turn out wonderful. 
I have two comments though. The first one is the same so many others make: break the egg in a measuring cup and add enough milk to make one cup total. I just dump this all at once in the flour mixture, it's a perfect amount. 
The other comment is that 15 minutes is not enough, at least I have found that I need to bake about 20 minutes or even more. I have used different ovens and I find that 15 mins leaves the scones sticky inside.

Put egg in a measuring cup and then filled the rest with milk per reviews.  Rolled out and cut into circles - made about 12 scones.  Brushed with milk and sprinkled a little bit of sugar on top.  Simple, but quick and tasty.

I added raisins, decreased the butter to 1 stick, because I was short on butter, and used fat free half and half.  I absolutely loved them and will make them again.  The perfect amount of sweet!

Quite easy and versatile - I'll definitely make them again.

One point to consider:  Recipe calls for cutting in 8 I believe.  I cut mine into 12 and they were still mammoth!  Bigger IS better, but since I'll be taking them to a tea, I'll be making these and cutting them much smaller tomorrow.

Great recipe!

These were really amazing. The only thing I did to this recipe was add blueberries at the end before rolling the dough out. They were a big success. My wife had three one after the other and said they are her new favorite. I did the recipe as stated and ended up with more like 20 scones. I prefer to make more smaller ones than to big. I also read what a reviewer wrote not to mix all the egg and milk mixture just enough to to get the dough to stick and that worked out perfect. I only used about 3/4 of that mixture. I will try and make this again with almond flour and replace the sugar with a substitute to make this healthier for me. Thank you all for you wonderful reviews that really help.

This was a great recipe. My additions : 2 tsp of vanilla & almond extract to wet batter; i eyeballed close to a half cup of rough chopped freshly roasted pecans, and about a 1/4 cup of golden raisins to dry mix. 

I'll have to experiment with savory options in the future ( I'm thinking cheddar and applewood bacon). 

Thanks for sharing

I made these tonight just to try it out before the holidays and they came out awesome! The only change I made was I put a few chocolate chips inside to make them a bit more kid friendly and to get them to brown better I brushed the tops with melted butter (2tbsp) and milk (2tbsp). If you wanted to add to them with out the chocolate chips I have sprinkled a bit of sugar on top before (works great with blueberries scones) and they are equally as good!

Super simple and easy to make. I unfortunately ran out of some ingredients that I should have checked first; ended up not using an egg nor regular milk but using soy milk instead. Additionally, I also made a separate mixture of apple, cinnamon, and sugar that I mixed into the 'dough' before rolling it out, cutting, and baking it. It's delicious!

I used 3 cups of flour and the dough came out way too sticky. I ended up using at least 5 or 6 cups.

loved it!  Easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe and followed the others' advice about the egg and the milk in the measuring cup. i cut the sugar in half because i wanted a more savoury version for homemade soup. Awesome.  I will definitely make these again. I also tried a sweet version by adding cinnamon and brown sugar (instead of white) directly to the butter. I whipped the butter , brown sugar and cinnamon first then added to the flour mixture. YUM!!!

I added the egg in the cup   then added the milk together. Also added blueberries they made 8 large scones so I cut them in half , instead of 400 cal. Now it's 200 better for diet.

When I first made them, they were good, but I thought they needed something, so next time I made them, I added a cup of chocolate chips and a little vanilla and they turned out wonderul!

These were absolutely delicious!  But the cooking time is way off. I ended up having to cook them at least twice as long as it said in the recipe.

Great base recipe for scones.  The person who reviewed and thought they tasted like a pancake, must have made a mistake.  Or decided to make changes to the recipe and her changes fell flat as a, well, a pancake.  They do not taste like a pancake..these were the best scones ever.  Light, flakey and the right amount of sweetness.  Wonderful with strawberry jam and honey.  This recipe is a keeper.

These were amazing especially since it was my first time attempting them. Not so scary! will make again and again. I did nothing different than the recipe said. I finished them off with some butter and sugar on top.

I followed the recipe, but cut in the butter after the liquid by accident. they still turned out great!  I cut the butter into tiny cubes and left lots of lumps....apparently this is a good thing!

I tested several scone recipes, including "World's Best", "Best Scones Ever", etc.  This recipe beat them all.  I did follow the tip of putting the egg in a measuring cup, then adding milk up to the 1 cup measure.  Worked like a charm. I divided the dough in half and rolled it into 2 rounds 3/4" thick instead of 1/2".  I cut half with a 2" biscuit cutter and left them plain.  I added orange zest and dried cranberries to the other half and cut the dough into 8 wedges. I liked having a different shape for each flavor.  The wedges were so quick to cut, with no waste and no rerolling that can toughen the scones. People loved them.  My scone search is over.

This is hands down the easiest and best scone recipe I've ever used! I always try to make things healthier if possible, and I was a bit reluctant to change this recipe given the excellent reviews. So instead of all white flour, I used two cups whole wheat flour and one cup white flour. I also added 1-1/2 cups cranberries and 1/2 cup walnuts. Because of the whole wheat flour, I didn't' want to knead, so I just mixed well in the bowl. I also dropped them in mounds instead of slicing into wedges. They turned out scrumptious! A little too good, as I ate two of them five minutes out of the oven, then froze the rest. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

These are great but I'd recommend adding a full cup of sugar instead of half a cup and about 1/4 cup half and half with 3/4 cup milk.

Very delicious! I added a 1/4 cup of slivered almonds along with a tablespoon of flax meal, substituted white flour for spelt flour, and used olive oil on the baking sheet. Next time I will use only a 1/2 cup butter; 3/4 cup is very flavorful, but too high in saturated fat! Overall, very lovely recipe and extremely tasteful.

Oh my! These are light as a feather! I followed the recipe exactly except used heavy cream instead of milk because it was what I had on hand. I'm not sure how fruit, especially dried, would work in these because they are so light. I served them with apricot preserves and there were none left.

This recipe is incredibly easy and wonderful to customize. I put in pureed pumpkin, cinnamon, and chocolate, but practically anything wold work. This is so quick to make but tastes absolutely delightful. I know I'll be making these again and recommending the recipe often. Thanks

These rise well! And it's a very basic recipe so you can add whatever toppings you have left over in your pantry. I used some left over raisins and cinnamon for the filling. I also use salted butter since the recipe only asks for a 1/2 tsp salt. I feel like with all the rising and flour, the recipe can hold up to salted butter.

Love this recipe! My family adores them.  I split the dough before kneading and work in mini chocolate chips for the kids, cranberries and chopped candied ginger for the adults.
 I cut the butter into small cubes and freeze for a few minutes. Then work in with my fingers, just like I do for pie crust and biscuits. Its much quicker than cutting in.

These had a great flavour but they were way too soft and came out as fluffy as a biscuit, which would be wonderful if that is what you were looking to make. Scones should be much harder and denser.

Very, very tasty and easy. I noticed butter pooling in the baking sheet when I took them out, so I'd cut down next time I make them. Protip. Make a double batch.

Just finished making my own batch of these. I made mine with less flour and took off a little of each ingredient, because I used a mini cupcake pan to make mine. You can also try adding some lemon juice and poppy seeds, it turned out really great!

The  dough was too wet and crumbly, resulting in very fragile biscuits. Way too much baking powder. 

Next time I'll reduce the baking powder and liquid.

Wow never made scones before and they have turned out beautifully. Will definitely use recipe again and share with friends. Used single cream instead of milk and the only hint I would give is to mix the liquid slowly.

This recipe would be OK but it calls waaaay too much baking powder. I used half the amount and the scones came out fine. Also, be careful and don't add the entire egg/milk mixture, because then your dough will be too wet. Add just a little at a time until the dough sticks together but is still a little "crumbly". Should be a little less than half the mixture.

Unlike most reviews I made a batch true to the recipe. I was looking for something to have with the blueberry preserves I made last night. I am gobsmacked. Three are fluffy and delicate. First serving I had I also used butter with the preserves but I didn't need it. These are perfect on their own hot or cold as well. Seriously fantastic treat that I know I will be making often!

Delicious recipe! I made NO changes when I made this, and they had a wonderful flavor. They are very moist and rise beautifully. Be sure not to overknead the dough. Besides becoming very brown on the bottom (which is very likely due to my pan), I definitely plan on making them again :)

This is a fabulous scone recipe!  It makes me laugh a little that some reviews are disappointed at how plain these scones are.  This is a really nice, traditional scone recipe.  I find they are great with raspberry jam, or lemon curd...  There is so much butter in the recipe, I haven't felt the need to add any more.  I will have to try them with clotted cream one day.

These are delicious. I have made this at least 15 times and they are always delicious. I took another reviewers hint and instead of the whole cup of milk do 1/2 cup OJ and 1/3 cup milk. Also I have to make sure you follow the directions exactly and old add the liquid until the flour mix is moist. I also add some craisins. I split the dough in half before I cut into 8 wedges (so it makes 16). That is just a personal preference as they seemed a little too big before.

Definitely put your egg in the measuring cup & top up with milk or cream to 1cup.  1cup plus the egg is too much liquid.

I live somewhere very dry and hot. That means that pretty much anything baked becomes really dry, really quickly. I watched the video on how to make these scones and did exactly as the video said. The scones turned out FANTASTIC. The only difference was that I had to bake them for an additional 6 minutes because I baked them on a pizza stone (this helps to evenly distribute the heat, so that the bottoms are as golden brown as the tops!) I will definitely return to this recipe, and maybe add some chocolate chips next time!

Didn't have all purpose flour so i mixed bread flour with wheat flour and had great texture and fluffiness. I left out the salt so it could be more dessert-like. Also, I wasnt able to roll out my dough! For some reason it was wayyy too sticky and loose.. So I just spooned it into muffin pans and filled the dough with strawberry jam. They came out amazing!

I've been using a different scone recipe on this site, but several weeks ago I decided to try this one..  I've made this about 5 times now!  One batch I added in cheddar and bacon..yummmm!  This is my now go to recipe, as is, and as a base to add in.  Only thing I suggest, is for a savory scone such as the cheddar and bacon, is to decrease the sugar a little bit.

Never made these before. Followed the recipe exact and it came out so good. I like it because it's not sweet. I guess I would cut down on the butter somewhat next time. They bake up real fast so you have to watch that they don't burn....mine were done in about 10 minutes. Used the food processer to cut the butter into the flour.

replace butter with 1/2 c melted coconut oil, use tepid milk to keep the coconut oil soft, increase sugar to 2/3 c, add 1/4 c chopped almonds, 1 tsp almond extract, 1/4 c chopped craisins, 1/4 c old fashioned rolled oats, 1 Tbsp grated orange rind then remove pith and chop orange and add. Mix together well. Dough will be sticky. Put out onto cooking sheet and shape into 2" high flat round. Bake for 25 minutes. After baking, drizzle with glaze. YUMMY

These scones were amazing! I am very glad I tried these. I used cake/pastry flour instead of all-purpose because the only other type of flour I had was wholemeal and I wasn't sure how they would turn out with that. Not sure how much of a difference it made, but they turned out great and tasted excellent. They were incredibly simple and quick to make, which definitely boosts its rating in my book. Tasted good with some leftover chocolate frosting, too! I will have to try them with wholemeal flour next.

I enjoyed this recipe very much and I did not (unlike other people) have to tweak the recipe at all. I make these for my family for brunch and serve with cream, and jam and a small amount of confectionary sugar on the tops of the scones for decoration.

These disappear incredibly fast. They are practically inhaled -- especially with the Easy Devonshire Cream (if you haven't checked out that recipe go! now! it is the PERFECT topping for these scones). The cutting in of the butter is absolute key to getting the maximum yumminess!

These are incredibly easy and offer a great canvass. I have made both a cranberry vanilla and orange ginger version of both. I usually make a simple icing to go on top, but they are great without the icing. Very easy as well, even at high altitude (I live at 7,200 ft.).

Easy to make. Use half the sugar as I prefer it not so sweet. Nice scone and tastes good the next day as well. Can be frozen as well.

Mine were a little dry, but they were still good warm with butter and raspberry jam. Enjoyed them with some tea during Downton Abbey!

Amazing, and so easy to make.  I've never made or eaten scones before, so I didn't know what to expect.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of using a bit less milk, kneaded it a few times and then patted it into a round, flat shape with my hands and then used my pastry cutter to cut it into 8 pieces.  I used the convection cooking on my stove, so I baked at 380F for 18 minutes.  Can't wait to try it with some savory variations!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Easy to make, quick. You can do a lot with this recipe - I added cinnamon, current, and almonds to mine. 

I took them out right after 15 minutes and they seemed a little doughy but they set up really nice.

FANTASTIC! This recipe was great! Its super-simple, and fun too! We had them for breakfast and dessert. We didn't have white sugar so we used brown, and the dough turned out a bit darker but they still tasted really good, and we didn't even add fruit. This is a great recipe if you just feel like having some scones because its super easy and quick. I also think that they would taste great with cranberries or raisins.

fantastic!  Light and fluffy and rose beautifully.  I think next time I'll use less sugar - and maybe add some little extras just for fun.  Overall, very pleased.

VERY EASY TO MAKE, I made it with a few variations. I used half and half, a dash of cinnamon, I kneaded with my mixer hook for 2 minutes, I topped with egg wash and a little bit of tornado sugar on top. Decreased the temperature to 385 degrees because the first bash burned at the bottom. One thing I noticed that the texture is more like a biscuit that is a scone. In the end they came out delicious, they melt in your mouth.

This makes one VERY LARGE BATCH, be prepared.  One recommendation suggested 3 tea of baking powder & 2 tea of baking soda, & adding one egg with enough milk to make 1 Cup.  The consistency was great.  I added 3/4 C walnuts & 3/4 C cranberries. I did pat it out and it was too soft to cut so I froze it for 10 minutes & it sliced perfectly.  Cut into 12 scones the servings were a more reasonable size and calorie value.  Will make again, but probably half the recipe next time.  They puffed up so beautifully!

This worked great first time out.  I used all the butter but skim milk since this is all I ever buy.
Used a whole cup and didn't find recipe too wet at
all since you must knead in more flour.  Added a small package of Craisins without even chopping them.  Simply delicious.  My husband wants me to try lemon zest and ginger next time.

These are so good! I followed the recipe exact. After adding the milk it's pretty wet so I just used extra flour when kneading. The scones were huge so next time I'll divide the dough in half and cut each into 8 to make 16! I ate them with jelly. Yum!

These were wonderful, and turned out perfectly!
I added the egg to the measuring cup, and poured in the milk until it reached a cup, as per other review. Perfection!

I might make it a wee bit less sweet next time, but lovely how it is.

First time ever making scones, followed the recipe with the one small change of using a stick of butter (1/2 cup)instead of 3/4 cup, frozen first and then grated into the flour mix. Quick and easy and they turned out amazing! Huge hit with the family!!

Excellent, quick and easy.  Just what I like.  They had a warm buttery taste.  I didn't "roll" out the dough, just flattened with my hands.  Each wedge is a very good size.

I make this recipe often, because my British hubby grew up having scones for tea every day.  Lately I've been dipping them in sugar before baking.  It becomes more like a Snickerdoodle that way.  I was doing the eggwash and a sprinkle of sugar as shown in the video, but just dipping them in sugar is easier and looks better.

These were great! Very scone-like and just the perfect touch of sweetness. I followed the recipe exactly except that I pulled them out a couple minutes earlier than called for as mine were a little thinner. Thank you for posting this!

Great! My fiancée loves this recipe. I always cut the added white sugar to 1/4 or 2/5 cup, and have started replacing with brown sugar. You can do all sorts of things with it: let me suggest adding dried blueberries to the base recipe. Or canned blueberries in water/light syrup and replacing some of the milk with the blueberry juice. I keep using this base recipe and toying around with it.

One hint: don't dally once you've added the baking powder. Getting them in the over right away will make for fluffier scones.

This recipe is fantastic.  I've tried it twice, so far.  Once with 2 tsps of cinnamon and a second time as is.  I followed the advice of other reviews and included the egg into the 1 cup of milk.  Both versions were delicious.  I am looking forward to adding to this recipe, it seems very versatile.

This was an easy conversion to gluten and lactose free by substituting GF baking mix 1:1 for the wheat flour, almond milk for the milk, and substituting ghee for the butter. This came out really well with adding 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, dried blueberries and mini-chocolate chips. This recipe was so flexible! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because I changed NOTHING!  I've actually been making this very recipe for years and it really is perfect.  It comes out the same way every time, which is good because I make them for my Mom every time she visits and I have to make extra to send them home with her.  The only complaint I have is that once you eat them... They're gone ;)  A long over due thanks to you Donna!

I followed the recipe as written, beating the egg in a one cup measuring cup and then adding milk to the top as suggested by other reviewers. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a couple teaspoons cinnamon to the dry ingredients. When I added the wet ingredients to the dry I also added about 1 c blueberries. The dough doesn't hold together at first; be careful not to overwork or you get tough scones. I cut into triangles and froze on a cookie sheet then baked the next morning for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. They were great for breakfast! I also made a glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar and drizzled that on top.

Very good, I put these into my recipe box and will make them again.  I used light brown sugar instead of white and I also topped them with brown sugar.  I used the full amount of egg and milk because I wanted the dough soft because I was adding fresh blueberries and wanted the berries firm and whole after folding them in.  Since the dough was sticky and soft I dropped them onto a silicon baking sheet and smoothed them down with a wet spoon.

AWESOME SHORTCAKES!!! I made these, exactly as described, except I didn't roll the dough. I dropped 12 mounds on a cookie sheet and baked as directed. These were excellent strawberry and peach shortcakes - the best I've ever had!

So simple with ingredients that I already had!  I added about a cup of frozen blueberries and frozen strawberries, which made them take about 10 minutes longer, but made them so moist and delicious!  I reduced the butter to 1/2 a cup without a problem.  They are also huge scones, with all that baking powder, and very fluffy.  Definitely will be making again soon!

Yum! I did half heavy cream half one percent and added slivered almonds and frozen raspberries. They were delicious. I might think about cutting the liquid down a little next time.

Great with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Made 12 large round scones.

Followed other reviewers advice to beat egg inside of measuring cup then add milk until liquid reached 1 cup.  Consistency was perfect.

Wow, these came out wonderfully! I did add a cup of raspberries to mine, as well as an egg wash and a sprinkling of white sugar over the top. They are so light and fluffy and flaky, this will be my new go to scone recipe!

In the end I think I added a bit more sugar with some cinnamon in it, and mix in some dried cranberries. It's not like me to eat desserts, so I served it to my family and  they seemed to like it very much! So glad I could find a BASIC and EASY recipes for scones!

I'm giving this 5 stars because its a great base recipe, and that's what makes it great, people can be creative with it. Since I've never made scones before I tested this out with just half the recipe. It made 10 big scones, I don't know how the full recipe could only make 8. I subbed 1/3 the flour with wheat & the milk with soy milk. I didn't bother rolling out the dough, I just grabbed handfuls and dropped them on my pan. I also added cut strawberries & a handful of chocolate chips. My scones turned out amazing, though they needed18-20 minutes to cook. Next time I'm going to try using apple sauce instead of butter to cut down on calories and fat.

I found that this recipe had a little too much baking powder, so I took it down to 4 teaspoons of baking power. I also added dried cranberries for a tasty twist.

These were the first scones I have ever made and they were great.  I added cinnamon and raisins.  They were a great texture and not too sweet.  If you would like smaller scones, I would suggest dividing the dough into two balls before rolling into a 1/2" round.  You would then get 16 regular sized scones instead of 8 large ones

These scones are delicious.  I definitely recommend adding the egg/milk mixture slowly - I used a little more than 1/2 of it and the scones were perfectly mixed.  Also, when cut into 8 wedges they came out huge!  Next time I'll make 10 or 12 so they're a normal size.

I had to use 2/3 of a cup of wheat flour with the white because I ran out of all-purpose flour. These turned out great. I would recommend that you divide the dough into more than eight pieces, as these scones rise a LOT.

I love this recipe! I once believed scones were difficult to make, but this recipe is so very easy. I have added chocolate to them, as well as craisens and dried blueberries. The possibilities are endless.

Like most have said, I added the liquid to the egg to make just one cup of fluid used. I used orange juice instead of milk, added a half teaspoon of lemon zest, and crumbled brown sugar on top. They were absolutely incredible!

This recipe is amazing! I used a 'glaze' of milk and powdered sugar to thicken and they turned out wonderfully. I thought that maybe I was adding too much baking soda, but the recipe is correct. They puffed up quite a lot in the oven. Best eaten hot, straight off the pan!

Delicious! These were relatively easy, served them at Easter brunch! I did have to use more flour than called for when rolling out the dough, as it was very sticky, even though I did not add all of the milk/egg mixture as suggested. I also ended up halving the batter to make 2 balls of dough, since rolling one out made quite large wedges. I added dried cranberries, and served with marmalade and butter! So delicious!

The scones were just perfect for the Royal Wedding. I put them together last night and popped them in the oven at 4 am today. They were in the fridge all night.

Absolutely delicious; I opted to add frozen blueberries!  I added the egg to the measuring cup prior to adding the milk also.  It was still a bit moist, so I spooned the batter onto the cookie sheet.  This was my first time making scones and it couldn't have been easier!  We will be enjoying them while watching the royal wedding!  :)

A++ I have failed with many other recipes and this is perfect.  I didn't have half and half so I used heavy whipping cream and milk and I think I bit more butter by accident. I also added mini chocolate chips.  Ill bet craisins would be great too!  My batch yielded almost double for some reason...rolled out like a medium pizza so I cut them in random shapes.  Excellent recipe!

Yummy!  These are delicious! I beat the egg and then just added the milk to make one cup, and I didn't even end up using the whole cup of the milk-egg mixture.  I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and about a half cup of chopped pecans, and sprinkled turbinado sugar on top of them and they are delicious!  I can't wait to make them again and add fresh blueberries.

Excellent scone recipe! This was so fast and easy. I added raisins, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Also sprinkled the top with sugar before baking and mixed powdered sugar with flour for my rolling surface. These are an excellent accompaniment to my hot tea :)

Wonderful and easy recipe! I loved that I already had all of the ingredients in my pantry! So easy to make and as the off-spring of a British mother, I can tell you these taste truly authentic. A superb recipe that I will be sharing... I will likely double the recipe as 8 goes fast!

Very nice texture, Light, soft inside and crispy outside. Great simple taste. I have to admit that I added lemon zest. And to experiment I added some nuts, raisins, and dried papaya pieces to 3 wedges. The taste was the same, but I have some raisins... so next time (yes, there should be a next time) I will add stuff to them.... and make them a little smaller.

It was my first time making scones and this was a very easy recipe to follow.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully.  Excited to try out some variations!

Update:  I've made these a number of times now.  I still make the recipe exactly as written, no changes to the amount of liquid or anything.  I do use the little trick of grating the chilled butter on the cheese grater - much easier!  I've found that rolling out the dough until it's about an inch thick and then using a mug to cut out little rounds works best for us.  We like to halve them and pop them in the toaster for breakfast in the morning and cutting them into 8 large triangular scones doesn't lend itself well to that.  My husband's favourite version of these is sharp cheddar, while my favourite is 'as is' with butter and jam!  So tasty!

Absolutely delicious! perfect crumbly texture. I had to add more flour as I kneaded it, as it was too sticky in the beginning.. I used the mouth of a jar as a mould, and made about 30 small scones!

I tried this recipe for our New Years good luck dessert and it turned out excellent.  I added raisins and craisins, formed them into balls and rolled them in cinnamon sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet.  Highly recommend.

These are delicious light and fluffy scones. I am still looking for a more traditional scone recipe, but these were very quick and easy. I spent about 45 minutes on them all in all. After baking I sprinkled a little mix of powdered sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon on the top for a little extra sweetness. YUM!

Excellent when fresh but they have a weird taste when reheated a day later. Might just be me. I love these scones and have made them quite a few times with either chocolate chips or dried cranberries.

This is a very sticky dough.  I wouldn't recommend trying to knead it.  Just drop them on the pan and bake them.  However, I thought the scones were very tasty and so did my parents.  I will make them again.

They tasted Ok, but not great. I don't really get it because I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a huge gooey mess. So, like someone else on here wrote, I had to just drop them on and hope for the best. How in the world do you use only as much flour as it says and have a dough you are able to roll out? Maybe there's too much milk, maybe not enough flour....all I know is that this is the first time I have tried to make scones and I was very disappointed with the results. I WILL NOT use this recipe again.

These tasted really good and were much easier to make than other scone recipes I looked at.  The only problem I had was that the dough was so sticky I couldn't really get cut them into wedges. I will make them again though.

they are fine, but not authentic enough for me - i like my scones crusty on the outside and these were very cake-like.  However, my in-laws went nutso over them!

Just okay.  From all the reviews, I must have not done something right.  Maybe didnt cut the butter enough.  I like my scones a bit sweeter and a bit drier.  These came out pretty doughy.  I sprinkled some raw sugar with some cinnamon on top and that part was pretty good.

My mother (who is from England) had a traditional tea party for some guests and I decided to use this recipe to make the scones. They were a huge hit! I even had to make a copy of this recipe for one of our friends.

Very basic recipe but good to experiment with.  I brushed the scones with egg white and then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them.. 

Best to eat right away, don't store well.

This recipe is wonderful, simple and loved by all who tasted it. I would highly recommend to anyone who loves scones to use this. I added fresh blueberries and it is definitely better than Starbucks' scones.

Overhere in Malaysia it is difficult to get freshly baked scones in our cake shops so I decided to make my own, this recipe is just great, easy to follow and even a beginner cannot go wrong.  My family enjoyed it.

I think this recipe is missing something.  I had to add significantly more flour to get something I could work with.  They still turned out good, and I'll likely use the recipe again, but with more flour.

I have tried this recipe several times and never quite got the right consistency. It was always too mushy for me to touch. It just stuck to my hands. However, I did add different fruits and sprinkled sugar on top of them before baking and they still turned out pretty good.
