Great base, yet lacking. The first time I made it I followed the directions and it was a bit salty, but I could tell it would have potential with a few changes. The second time, I cut out the mustard, added W.Sauce,fresh basil,and 3 cloves of minced garlic. This addition makes the marinade heavenly and its now a go to for me when grilling steaks. I also would never use vegetable oil in a marinade as its too thick, olive oil always works best in meat marinades and cut it way down to like 1/4 of a cup.

This was a great all purpose marinade.   I used it for kebobs I'd cut from a lowly chuck roast and let them marinate all day before Mr. LTH grilled them to perfection.  Great flavor, tender, and really made a chuck roast pop w/out having to slow cook it.  THANKS for the recipe!  The only changes I made were to 1/2 the recipe and replaced dijon w/yellow, per personal preference.

This was a Wonderful marinade! I was all out of Dijon mustard so I used regular and it turned out fabulous! Thanks for the great recipe. I used it on sirloin fillets and they were very very tender. My whole family devoured all of it!

I've never made a marinade before, and always just used a premade, but decided to get a little fancy today. Followed the recipe exactly, forked the *** out of my inside round roast and let it marinate for 6-8 hours this morning. Took it out of the marinade, rubbed all over with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper and seared it. Braised in the oven at low heat sitting in beef broth. SUPER YUMMY! Roast was moist and very tender and forked apart easily, and the outside pieces had a WONDERFUL flavour. Gravy was superb (though again, I didn't cook it in the marinade.) Hubby says it's the best roast I've ever made! Definitely a repeat!

It is the 4th of July and I wanted a great marinade.  I made this marinade this morning with the original recipe. The beef was in the marinade for 8 hours. I have to say that this recipe was delicious!  The flavors stood up to the chuck roast that I cut up for the kabobs and everybody loved it.  I want to try receipe this with shrimp next! yum!

I found it too salty. I definitely recommend marinating for 12 hours or more. The lemon juice is important as its acidity will tenderize tougher cuts of beef.

Made this for my fiancé and we both loved it! Followed the recipe exactly and it was one of the best tasting beef meals we've had. The beef came out perfect and so tender, will definitely make this many more times, I can't wait for summer this will be a staple beef marinade for me.

This truly is the best marinade.  I marinated a london broil for several hours last weekend and it turned out pretty good but then marinated the second london broil from the package for a week and that was even better!!Definitely keeping this in my repetoire.

I used this marinade for top round beef kabobs (reserved some of the marinade to use for the rice I served them with) and marinated the kabobs with the rest of the marinade overnight and then grilled them medium rare - YUM! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

I made this for beef stir fry strips to see if I could solve my problem of always having tough beef. I let it marinade for about 6 hours (I was in a time crunch). It did its job and it honestly was the first time I feel I made a successful beef stir fry! The only thing is I feel that I would change is the lemon juice. I’m thinking the recipe as it is would be great for chicken and either take out the lemon juice or reduce it to maybe two tablespoons for beef.  I just found the lemon a bit too present and not a subtle hint. But I recommend this recipe for sure. Just adjust to your tastes.

This is the perfect marinade for beef, in my opinion.  It came together in minutes, and made plenty.  I was a little concerned because I had only two hours to marinate the meat before cooking dinner, but I needn't have worried because the thick London Broil absorbed just the right amount of flavor and was very tender. I should note that I used low sodium soy sauce because it was all I had, and I will continue to do so.  It was perfect.

This marinade saved our freezer burned New York steaks!  All these years I've been a purist, preferring salt and garlic & herb seasoning only on my steaks.  But with these wonderful flavors, I will certainly be working this marinade into my menu planning frequently.  Garlic lovers may want to double up on that ingredient.

The only change I made was to switch the cup of vegetable oil to 1/2 of extra virgin olive oil. I used this marinade on some thin "beef round steak bottom for swiss"  (first time ever trying this cut of beef) and grilled it.  Used minced garlic from a jar so probably used more than a clove.  Everyone raved about the flavor.  I ran back to the store to get more steaks while they were still on sale, going to marinate and freeze them for another day.

I used this recipe as a base for a beef jerky marinade, I doubled the portions for 8 peoples servings. However I changed the soy sauce size to 1/4 of that is advised as I ran out, added lime juice. Additionally swapped the garlic for bbq seasoning, it turned out great as I marinated the meat for 52hours then used a dehydrator on it for 12 hours.

This recipe smells and looks amazing. The portion amounts were enough for me to jar half and store in the fridge. I does seem a bit salty but a little bit of sugar may cancel some of it out. Stay tuned!

I changed it by cutting out oil and soy substituted more Worcestershire to compensate (plus little extra) and rendered it into a deep dark steak sauce with a bite!!!!

I prefer marinades over a dry rub or seasoning. This is absolutely the best, and even my husband agreed (who I think sometimes over seasons things)!  ????

No exaggeration.  This is the best marinade I have ever made!
 I marinated a very thick beef loin for the full 48 hours.  The flavor was delectable; the beef, tender and moist.

I'm giving this 5 stars by the flavor of the ingredients when combined.  I have a London Broil marinating in it now.  My initial comment is that the recipe gives no indication of how many pieces of beef it will marinade.  Nor does it recommend how long to marinade.  I had one steak and this was way too much marinade.  I'm saving the rest and eating more beef than I planned this week ;-)

That marinade turned my roast into buttery goodness.  I marinated the roast for 48 hours.  The next time I use that marinade, I'm gonna add Red Cooking Wine to the mix and see how that turns out.  It's  a keeper!

I cut zucchini into one inch cubes and added it to the roast in a slow cooker with the marinade 30 min before surving. The zucchini was incredible!!!!

Good but yes salty - based on reviews I added no salt and cut soy sauce to half cup.  I used a POOR pice of meet and still tough after 24 hour marinade.  I would also cook one higher doneness level....med to Med Well etc.  I will try others before I settle for this one.

Might consider adding 1/2 t of Rosemary

I have used this for various cuts of beef and it always turns out well.  It is the best ever!  After trying many other recipes, this is my 'go to' marinade!

I just did a London Broil and it's the best I've ever tasted! Thank you! I'm not trying to sell anything here but I recently purchased an instant marinater that works on vacuum pressure. It gives you a full marinade in minutes as opposed to days. Once again, I have no stock in the company. But it really works! This is a simple but fantastic marinade! Thanks again!
