Absolutely delicious!!  Even my not-yet-two-year-old son devoured it!  The mozzarella cheese and pizza sauce of a traditional pizza was NOT missed.  The flavors blended to perfection.  I used tomato basil feta.  Magnifique!  My only suggestion is to roast the vegetables slightly before topping the pizza because the juice of so much pepper and onion can cause the dough at center of the pizza to be slightly soggy.  The only alteration I made was adding fresh diced tomato.  I also rubbed a tablespoon of pure olive oil on the dough, sprinkled it with fresh basil and red pepper flakes, which added a brilliant punch!  We will incorporate this into our menu for sure!

O-M-G this is delicious! We used fresh tomato chunks and agree with the previous reviewer to roast the veggies to avoid sogginess, especially with the peppers and tomatoes. This was so so so so good! Thanks!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  And so good for you! So I'll have another slice, thank you.  Added a small can of drained mushroom slices, some chopped roasted bell peppers (from a jar), and some fresh baby spinach ripped into smaller pieces.  My husband ate most of the pizza himself and kept complimenting me.  Now we can get a nice assortment of veggies into our diet in a really yummy way!  Just what I'm always looking for.

Good pizza, but very hard to eat since there is no sauce or gooey cheese holding the vegetables on the crust.  I'm not sure if there would be a repeat of this, there's so many better pizzas to make.

I made a single serving of this on pita bread and added artichoke hearts. It was AMAZING!! My roommate wants me to add olives to hers next time I make them.

I made my own crust, skipped the olive oil and used a ton of red, green and yellow peppers, a bunch of onion, roasted garlic, fresh basil and about 1/2 cup of cooked Gimme Lean sausage. I used reduced fat feta and the flavors couldn't have been better. Really filling, you can't really eat more than a slice.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I added chunks of chicken and a tiny bit of mozzarella cheese under all of the toppings and it came out perfectly.

I would definitely make this again and again.

What a great recipe! We sauteed the veggies before mixing with the olive oil/garlic/seasoning and added tomatoes to the mix too. A very tasty and quick dinner!

I used the dough from Trader Joes.  And I used Goat Cheese instead of Feta.  Red pepper, onion and roma tomatoes.  Roasted the sliced vegies.  Then used pesto as the sauce, topped with veggies and goat cheese.  A little parmesan cheese.  450 for 20 minutes.  Really good!

Loved it! I am not a red pepper fan, but this was delicious. I had some asparagus in the fridge so I threw it on, but the recipe would have been great as written.

This was a very tasty pizza! I hardly modified anything. I added mushrooms and used a trio of red, orange, and green peppers. My crust was whole wheat from Whole Foods (only $1.29 in the refrigerated section!) and I used garlic olive oil, didn't add any salt. I also brushed the edges with garlic olive oil. Minus one star because my pizza was soggy in the middle (but definitely cooked enough). I just read some reviews and saw that maybe I should've roasted the peppers / mushrooms first to reduce moisture. I will try that again next time and also use reduced fat feta. All in all, fantastic recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I love this combination of toppings, but I spread the crust with pizza sauce and add 3/4 cup of shredded mozzarella.

The ingredients in this pizza are very good, but I'm giving it 3 stars because it didn't turn out to be a "pizza" when all the toppings fell off. It was also a lot of topping, too much for the 12 inch Boboli crust. I didn't read the reviews before making this, but it has no binding ingredient to keep the toppings on because feta is not a good melting cheese. To put the pizza away, I ended up just pouring all the toppings into a container and slicing the crust up to make it a fork meal.

Awesome and healthy! I roasted the veggies first (omitted onions) and added spinach leaves and canned artichokes. It went pretty fast. Next time I'll make two.

Pretty, but nothing special. Like other reviewers, we found it difficult to keep the ingredients on top of the pizza.

Absolutely perfect!  I cooked the veggies over low heat until they were the way that I like them.  Other than that I didn't make any changes.  This is a keeper.  So simple and yet so tasty.

I was also nervous before making this, but the result was very good. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and  roasted the veggies in advance and put some sundried tomato pesto on the dough. I increased the feta to 1 cup and 1/2 (200 grams) and it makes it richer.

What a great alternative to the usual sauce and cheese pizza. Thought it would be dry without sauce but was reall good. I followed recipe but I didnt have olive oil on hand so used veg oil and didnt put on the crushed peppers. My crust didnt come out soggy, maybe seeing I cooked on a low rack in the oven to crunch the crust.

Simple but really delicious flavors.  I used light feta and an uncooked pizza dough.  It took about 20 minutes to cook on 450 degrees.

I have made this pizza many times. It is a great option when you want pizza but are trying to eat healthy. It is also a great option for pizza parties if you have guests who are allergic to tomatoes. I love to add peppers of multiple colours to increase the assortment of nutrients. I also sometime change up the spices depending on if I want i to be more Italian or more mediterranean in flavour. Love it!!! Has become a go to recipe in my house.

this was simple and light.. but i do think that it's very hard to eat.. it was tasty but i attribute that to the crust.. i used summer squash pizza crust from this site.. i think it would have been a little bland for me and bf if we would have used a plain crust.. either way ty for the recipe

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I used a refrigerated crust and baked it for about 5 minutes and then added the ingredients and baked for another 6 or 7 minutes.  I wasn't sure if I would like this or not, I'm a big sauce person but we loved it.  My husband commented that it tasted like it was from a restaurant.  I didn't have green or yellow pepper so I just used red pepper.

I cooked smoked sausage and added it as well to give it a little more punch.  i used homemade dough so i cooked it about 5 minutes longer for a crispier crust.  This was a very good and definitely didn't need any pizza sauce.

Outstanding!  Thanks to reviewers who suggested Sun-dried Tomato Pesto as the base, and roasting the vegetables first.  Used both suggestions, plus added some fresh mushrooms.  Believe my addiction to sausage/pepperoni has been cured!  Give this recipe a try.  You won't be disappointed.

the flavor of this pizza was SO good.  my one complaint was that it was hard to keep everything on top of the pizza, the toppings kept falling off.  next time i might use some low-fat cream cheese as a base, just to kind of glue it all together.  REALLY tasty though.  whole family loved it!

Great flavour combination on this pizza. Wow! I used some Sundried Tomatoe Pesto as the sauce and that went really well. Great stuff :)
