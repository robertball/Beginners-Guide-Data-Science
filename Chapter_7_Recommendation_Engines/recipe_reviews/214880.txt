I baked ours, with the exception of cholesterol, I think I've managed to make this MUCH healthier :)  First, I par-baked TURKEY bacon in half-slices. This reduces both sodium AND fat and left the bacon pliable enough to wrap.  Then, I cleaned & roasted 10 FRESH jalapenos in a drizzle of olive oil & a pinch of sea salt for about 10 minutes. Again, a reduction of sodium AND leaving nutrition in the pepper.  Then, I wrapped about a 1/3 of each jalapeno & a half-slice of bacon around each shrimp & secured with a toothpick.  I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  In addition, I prepared an "eye-balled" provolone cheese sauce for dipping.  YUMMMMM!

These were very good but we did grill instead of deep-fry ours. The tastes were great!!

My husband and I have friends that own a very reputed Chinese restaurant (they come from China, actually) that we love going to. They serve this there and I've been trying to get the recipe for ages. Now, I'll finally be able to make this at home. Thanks for sharing!

amazing, but for the stuffing I sliced fresh jalepenos and sateed them in butter with crushed garlic and chopped onions with some jamacian jerk seasoning. The jalepenos tasted really good on their own and the excess made a good topper for the shrimp to enhance presentation. :p

This was a phenomenal recipe!!!!!! I made a couple changes because me and my family are lovers of spice. When I halved the jalepenos i left the seeds and membranes to really have some flavor. However these are very hard to keep togetehr when turning over on the grill. next time I may bake them.

I first encountered this recipe at the Cadillac Bar and Grill in San Francisco. The place is now eradicated to make room for a parking garage for the Moscone Center. They had a sister restaurant in the Wiltern building in LA for a while, but thats gone too. We regularly make this appetizer to this day.

They grilled the shrimp, on skewers, over mesquite. I consider the mesquite flavor an essential part of this dish. And don't use a "sliver" of jalapeno. Use a as big a slice as the shrimp will accommodate.

Serve with a bowl of melted garlic butter for dipping.

These are wonderful little party treats. We really liked them, but be careful not to put too much of the jalapeno in the shrimp - they can get HOT!  Thanks for sharing :o)

Very good! We have made these for years but grill them outside. You can use shrimp like these do or can use chunks of boneless uncooked chicken, too. The smokey flaver gives it a whole new twist of its own.

So easy and delicious! The jalepenos gave it a nice little kick. I made some without the jalepenos (for my younger cousins) and they were great as well!

We really liked these.  We were afraid that the jalapeno and bacon would overwhelm the shrimp but it really didn't.  They do take some time to put together - but we will definitely make again.

My husband discovered this recipe and this site; I picked up the ingredients on the way home from work and he made. Our 14 yr old helped and the result was truly amazing! I made again a couple of wks later for Christmas Eve. Surely not low fat, but so delicious.

I made this for my boyfriend on our first Valentine's day. I had a very small budget and spent hours trying to find something that would wow him and this recipe did it! He's from the coast so I really wanted to do something with some type of sea food and every man loves bacon so it was absolutely perfect. I baked the shrimp just because I am trying to be a little healthier and paired it with a simple queso cheese blt and strawberries and whipped cream. Amazing! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This will be grilled next weekend at my house! With a few changes....I regularly grill  'buffalo turds' bacon wrapped jalepenos stuffed with cream cheese. This weekend I will add shrimp instead of cream cheese, or maybe, both since Im only finding huge jalepenos lately. Cant wait to grill it!

I've made these about 1000 times now! I love the, with all the variations or just with plain cream cheese. Never any left.
I use my melon balled to seed peppers and line my sink with newspaper, make clean up quick and easy!

Perhaps I was having an off day,  I used large shrimp (16-21 count per pound) but they weren't big enough for a nice presentation or to stay put on the skewer.  Granted, I grilled them but on a grill pan.   Anyway, I recommend you get the biggest shrimp you can and of course, be sure they are "deveined"  (those are not really veins!  :)

Flavor could have been more interesting, although Jalapeño is great, it still could have used something more, maybe sea salt or lime or cilantro, perhaps a dip...    Thank goodness bacon makes everything tastes good.
