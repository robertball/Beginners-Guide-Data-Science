These cookies don't actually taste like 'Nutella'. They are just double chocolate cookies. Also DO NOT put them in for ten or twelve minutes. I did and my cookies burnt. Just put them in for seven minutes and you'll get a good gooey cookie.

I think these cookies are fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly and then added some toasted walnuts. I took them to work and they disappeared in a flash. Very rich and yummy. 10 minutes was the best baking time for me. I will make these treats again!

OMG - These are soooo yummy!! Followed recipe as written except only made a half batch to try it first.  Baked for about 7-8 min. and Let them sit on the cookie sheet to cool for a while as instructed. Turned out fabulous! Thank you for sharing this one. Definitely a keeper.
