I've tried making spaghetti sauce a few times in the instant pot. This recipe was my favorite so far (and the only one my kids didn't complain tasted "weird"). The only thing I changed was using fresh basil, and I added about a teaspoon of sugar.

Made this recipe w all the tomatoes left from my garden.  Romas, cherry, grape tomatoes.  Pretty much followed the recipe, but didn't use celery (preference) and didn't have Italian seasoning.  Added about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup red wine.  Delish!  So easy.

A tasty base sauce, can be made in a normal pressure cooker just as well.
