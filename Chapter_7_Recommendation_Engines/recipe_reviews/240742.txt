Wonderful! I had to make a few adjustments though, mainly because I live in a small town and they don't have much. So, they were out of zucchini, I left that out and added red bell pepper instead. I also removed the chorizo from the casing and cooked it that way with ground turkey. I cooked the eggs in the hash for the photo, but I poached some extra as well :)
My family really loved it!

Easy weeknight dish that's become a quick staple! After making this a ew times I made a couple changes to our taste.. Which might not make this 100% paleo (not great with this yet!). I use turkey chorizo and no nitrate no fillers apple maple chicken sausage, 1 pkg each.. 1 very large sweet potato, fresh mushrooms sliced (the smaller sized package) about 1/2 a large red onion diced & about 8-10 small sweet peppers cut up.. to speed things along, i toss in a table spoon or two of unsalted chicken stock and close the lid (helps the potatoes and adds a little flavor) I also toss in a couple tablespoons of pimenta moida (Portuguese hot chopped peppers) just before I add a full bag spinach at the very end. Be careful with that if you don't like heat! :)

This was really good. I added a bit too much stock so I had a little bit of sauce with mine. I am not one who likes runny yolks so I topped mine with scrambled eggs.. yum

It was ok. Kids would not eat it because it was spicy . Next time I will leave the chorizo out.

This. Was. Fantastic. I used my 12" cast iron skillet and it took a while to prepare but was totally worth the time spent. Next time I would cook the turkey/chicken sausage first as some of it didn't really hit the pan because the chorizo was in the way so it took longer. I had trouble draining all the fat from the pan so I used some paper towel to swab the decks and it worked well to clean up the grease. After adding the cubed sweet potato I covered it with a lid to help the cooking along, and I added corn with the zucchini (some of which I grated so I could see if I preferred cubed or grated zuch in it...grated was the winner!) Absolutely delish, thanks for another great recipe.

We love this one at our house! The chorizo is a MUST if you want a big punch of flavor! The poached egg completes the dish. I eat the leftovers without the egg, but it is better with the egg.

Made this vegetarian by substituting the sausage with black beans.  I added the black beans at the end to heat through and flavor. Even my meat loving guys liked this!

I omitted the olive oil entirely because I was using a non-stick pan and ground sausage will release it's own fat when cooked. I used pork sausage instead of chicken and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also substituted green bell pepper and onion for the zucchini. Both my husband loved it and will be making it again. For reference, I used 1/2t salt and 3/4t black pepper. It was quite spicy.

We used 6oz chorizo and 1 bell pepper instead of the zucchini. Once the potatoes were tender we turned you the heat to cook off the broth and brown the sweet potatoes. It was awesome!

Good, but too spicy! I like a little spice, but this was too much for a normal palette.

I didn't have zucchini on hand so I chopped up 3 stalks of fresh asparagus and added diced onions.

Fantastic flavor!

This recipe is simple, delicious, and nutritious! I used ground turkey instead of chicken out of personal preference. I also have made it with Italian-seasoned ground turkey, and that was tasty, too. The egg on top with a runny yolk really does make the dish. I usually fry the egg instead of poaching. It's wonderful leftover the next day without the egg, too. When I take leftovers, I often make a soft-boiled egg to have on it, though. Wonderful!

Delicious! I added ground chicken only and added my own seasonings to the chicken meat before cooking. This is a great Paleo recipe.

We loved this! Next time will double the hash so we will have left overs! I needed a lot more chicken broth than listed in the recipe. Didn't have chorizo so used chicken apple sausage and another spicy  chicken sausage. Also added chopped onion. Really good.

Yumm! I forgot to buy chorizo, so I had to spice it up
with some smoked paprika. This was a great way to get my carbs out of the way  for the day and also a refreshing change from the boring scrambled egg breakfast. I can't wait to make it again with chorizo.
