I love baked feta, and was really looking forward to trying this recipe out, and I was definitely not disappointed.  The balance of salt from the cheese, spice from the chilies, and the herbal aroma of the oregano hit the spot.  But... I gave it three stars because although I enjoyed it, the flavour was a bit plain.  I added some crushed garlic, and a bit of rosemary, and felt the recipe was better rounded for the changes.  But since I am judging on the recipe as it, it was just a bit of a single note, so only three stars.

This recipe is simple, yet AMAZING.  I don't know what that other guy was talking about, there are no additional flavors needed.  Maybe he had some cheap/bad feta or an unrefined palette.  Anyway, I just can't say enough about how wonderful this recipe is.  When I ate it with my husband and our three year old child, we all could not stop discussing how wonderful it was with our friends for the next week.  Here's a little tip: follow the recipe exactly, add nothing.  It is PERFECT.

This is a traditional recipe that you'll find in tavernas and mezedopoleio (meze restaurants) all over Greece. The simple flavors and preparation should be savored! I wouldn't add anything else to this recipe, as the contrast between salty/sour and spicy, as well as the creamy texture of the baked feta, are quite enough to make a great little dish! Note that feta doesn't 'melt' the way most cheeses do, so you will find that the slice of feta will hold its shape. But it should be soft and bubbly throughout. You'll want to serve right away, because the feta will harden as it cools. And most importantly, please use FULL FAT feta, and preferably Greek feta from sheep and goat milk. Cow milk feta and low fat feta will not produce similar results! Enjoy!

We've made this delicious feta recipe numerous times and more recently on the BBQ (on aluminum foil with the sides crimped up to catch drips).  We discovered that we needed lots of chili pepper flakes when using the "stale" stuff from the Bulk Barn.  Just the other day with friends, I crushed up some dried chilis I stored in a jar from last year's garden, and boy oh boy, what an amazing flavour!  We BBQ'd 2 large 1/4 inch slabs and ate them with garlic buttered toasted pitas and everyone including kids was ranting and raving over the flavour. So simple and so good.

Excellent idea.  I drizzled with garlic infused olive oil and added cherry tomatoes and juice from 1/2 a lemon.  Huge hit at my cocktail party last night.  Be sure to enjoy when it's hot, as the feta hardens back up as it cools.

This was so delicious and ridiculaously easy to make. I used less crushed red pepper because some of my family does not like spicy, but it was a wonderful, not burning heat, so it was fine. The only downside is that it is not nearly as good once it cools down, so eat it while it's hot! Thanks for a great recipe.

These were really simple and delicious. I had some fresh bread from a nearby bakery that I broiled with brushed on olive oil, and then I put the feta and spices on afterwards and put them back under the broiler. My Greek boyfriend absolutely loved it. The feta cheese in our household disappeared much faster than usual after giving this recipe a try.

I was so glad to see this recipe!  This was one of my favorite things to order when I lived in Greece.  Greeks tend to shy away from spicy food, so this was a real treat.  I've never seen it without a red sauce before, which is how I prepared it.  Delicious.

Delicious, simple, quick and inexpensive = a perfect party appetizer.  I served it with plain sliced french bread but will do crackers next time for texture. Cover the cheese LIBERALLY with herbs and red pepper flakes - the feta perfectly balances them.

Seems like roasting softens the tang.  Definitely add minced garlic, garlic powder, paprika, rosemary & oregano with other ingredients for a more diverse & beautiful offering. Gone in 1 bite. Okay, maybe 2...no crackers needed. They didn't last that long.

Great! I didn't know if the feta would hold it's own (I usually do the spinach/feta thing). Also good baked with a marinara sauce.

When making this recipe I used half the amount of crushed red pepper and it was still WAY too much.  I like crushed red pepper but it overwhelmed the rest of the dip.  I would make this again but I feel like it needs some garlic added.

Yummy! I added a bit of paprika on my feta and left out the chili though. Eat it while it's still fresh from the oven, because as it cools it hardens up and is harder to eat on pita. Enjoy!

I am giving this 4 stars as written because it is bland as is. I had to doctor it up, then it became 4.5 stars. I didn't use sliced feta, instead I used crushed feta (I thought it would 'melt' more and it did) and I added some garlic and tomato sauce. I served with warm pita chips.

Excellent flavor, although on other tries I did add a bit of garlic and/or garlic powder which intensified the flavors.  DO NOT make the mistake of using fat free feta; once I made it with the fat free as that was all the store had, but it failed miserably as the feta does not melt/soften.  Simple and excellent recipe with few ingredients.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and was dissapointed. WAY to salty! I am thinking that instead of the spices used, it would be better using garlic or something else. Will not make again the way it is.

Made a small version of this just to try it out.  I did go easy on the crushed red pepper.  I served this with toasted baguette slices that I had brushed with EVOO (both sides) and broiled (again both sides) to toast them up.  We liked this a lot.  I’ll be more brave with the crushed red pepper next time.  I didn’t think it spread very well, but maybe I didn’t get it warm enough.  A nice combination and sooooo easy!

Excellent as is!  I used my own home-made feta, and didn't measure anything.  I was worried the pepper flakes would be too hot but they just added a really nice piquancy.  Can't wait to make it for friends & family!

Extremely good. My teenager and I ate just about all of this as soon as it came out of the oven. I am not normally big on red pepper flakes. (I tend to like crushed) BUT, I did take your advice and put tons on. You were right, the dairy in the cheese totally cut the overwhelming pepper I normally get from the flakes. I also added fresh oragano from my herb garden. Thanks!

This was the best surprise!  Only added a sprinkle of garlic powder and followed the recipe.  It has endless possibilities for making in the future.  Served with wheat thins and it was gobbled up!

Great appetizer! So easy to make and tastes great.  The heat is offset well by the cheese.  I eyeballed the measurements, but followed the ingredients.  Also, I used a mortar and pestle to crush the spices for fresher flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I will make again, but it was way too much red pepper for us.  Will probably use 1/2 recommended quantity

This was a super easy appetizer and a definite hit. I was worried about all the pepper flakes but they added the PERFECT contrast to the sour-salty of the cheese. I served this with crusty bread and it was a big hit! Wouldn't change a thing. One note though, I did have to cook it for almost twice the amount of time to get the cheese to be hot all the way through.

This was wonderful and so easy to prepare.  Served it with pita chips and everyone loved it.  It's nice to have simple recipes like this on hand for happy hour gatherings.  Thanks for sharing!

Very Good! I have a TON of feta to use up, so I was looking for something different and simple...this recipe totally fit the bill! I didn't have any oregano, so I just used italian seasoning. I really didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it to suit out tastes. This was a warm and wonderful appetizer and I will certainly be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is very similar to what I make.  I add sliced tomotoes to this as well as italien dressing.  The oil kind not the creamy.  Always a crowd pleaser.

Delicious! I didn't measure the oregano and red pepper flakes.  I also had FF feta that fell apart.  I would make this again if I was was looking for a recipe to use use my leftover feta.
