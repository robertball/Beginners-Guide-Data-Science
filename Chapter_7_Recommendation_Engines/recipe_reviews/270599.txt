Not a good flavor.  But I had to use vanilla extract instead of almond.  If anybody else makes this, I would love to hear what they think.  
Very creamy.   If there were something else to sweeten it with?

Delicious!  I use a whipping cream and coco powder all the time as my quick go to dessert but adding the almond flavour just takes it to the next level of decadence.
