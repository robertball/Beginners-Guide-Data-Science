I made this according to the recipe.   It turned out delicious.   I maybe let it marinate a little too long (24 hours), so the flavors were strong.   Served it with a peanut sauce, coconut rice, and cucumber salad.   Highly recommended.

Made this on a cast iron and used satay-sized bamboo skewers instead of on the grill. Turned out perfect! Served with satay peanut sauce and the usual satay sides of smashed rice, cucumber and onion.

We made these skewers, opting to forego the peanut sauce and they were... AMAZING! Wouldn't change a thing on the recipe. We cooked them in the broiler given the show outside, but they were tender and very flavorful. We love Chef John at our house, so this was a natural fit. As the kids are fond of saying... "and as always, ENJOY!"

Delicious! I opted for pork that was labeled carnitas. I didn't want to buy an 8 lb. pork butt/shoulder. The meat came out really tender after using the baking option.
