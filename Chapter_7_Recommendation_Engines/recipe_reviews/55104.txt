These were good, but the buiscuits turned out a little dry for my taste. I served them with extra cranberry sauce.

these were very tasty, my family loved them!!! I did roll them out a bit thinner than it said to try and get more biscuits out of them.. wouldnt do that again.
I also added a bit more cheese and brushed tops with butter at the end like suggested in other comments =)
