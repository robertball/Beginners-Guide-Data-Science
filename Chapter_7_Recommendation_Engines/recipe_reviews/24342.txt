This recipe is good, but I have tried about 10 different versions on the Spanish tortilla and most of them do not include ham or bell pepper.  They also include more salt and pepper.  The other super important thing is that you need to cook the tortilla on medium low heat so the bottom doesn't burn before you flip it.   Flip it over with the aid of a plate, platter or another frying pan of equal or larger size.  Please don't cook the tortilla over medium heat though, or it will burn.  As my Spanish friend who came over to my house and taught me how to make it said: "fuego lento" (low/slow flame) is the key.  Along with patience.

This was soo good!!!  I added about 3 cloves of garlic and omitted the bell pepper, just to have the more classic version of the Tortilla Espanola!!!  This is normally eaten at room temperature, but you can't go wrong no matter how you serve it!

This was pretty good. Spanish tortilla is spanish tortilla, if you know what I mean. I didn't have any veggies or ham, so just made with onions, turkey bacon, potatoes, egg. Added a splash of milk to make it a little less dense. Cooked on stove for about 6 minutes, pulling back the edges and letting egg run underneath to better cook. Finished under broiler for about 4 more minutes. Let it cool a bit, then flipped it onto a plate. It looked much better in the pan, actually, so I reflipped for serving. Served with a dollop of sour cream that had been seasoned into a sauce with Spanish Smoked Paprika. (Should have let this sit longer to get flavors better absorbed.) I crisped the potatoes that went into it, as well, which isn't typical of spanish tortilla. I thought the bacon was a bit strong, but it may be because I'm used to a simpler omelette with just onion, potato, egg. Husband tried it cold the next day and said it was still good.

This is a great quick simple dish which can be adapted using whatever you ahev got in the cupboard. I made this using left over rice salad, smoked bacon and olives. Don't try to flip the omlette though - finish it off under the broiler instead.

Mmmm...delicious!  I had to make a Spanish tortilla for a class I'm taking, and this turned out really well.  I did have to substitute a green pepper for a red one, used precooked bacon, and already diced ham (rather than slices).  Couldn't find spanish seasoning at the grocery store, but they did have Spanish paprika, so I used that plus a little chile powder.  Next time I may add a little tabasco sauce to the egg mixture to spice it up a bit.  Overall, a nice recipe!

Yum! My only complaint - way too much oil. In fact, if you cook the bacon first that would create enough fat to cook the potato in and then you wouldnt even need the oil. But aside from that this is great and my 5yo and nearly 1yo are currently enjoying  some for brekky.
