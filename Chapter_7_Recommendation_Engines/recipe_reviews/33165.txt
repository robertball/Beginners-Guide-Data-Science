OK, this is the very first review I've ever actually done from probably 20 recipes I've tried. I love these muffins
They astonished me. I've hardly used my bag of whole wheat flour for 4 years because everything I ever tried to make with it
is dry. These are not dry. They are not sweet either. But they are very high in Fiber and vitamins. I think I'm going
to try to add cocoa and some brown sugar to the recipe and choc. chips and try to get my daughter to eat them. I've 
been dying for a great bran muffin recipe that I don't feel guilty eating. Thanks so much for this. Oh, I also just added all
liquid ingrediants together and dry together and then added them together. I don't know what size muffins that Alan makes
but I made 24 regular muffin cup size muffins not 12. Couldn't find the barley malt  flour so I just left it out. All the rest was 
exactly as the recipe stated.

This is what a bran muffin should taste like! Thankyou to Latisha who said it was too dense, it was that"negative feedback"that made me want to try it.I`ve been looking for a dense and flavorful bran muffin and most often the sugar content is so high that is all one tastes. I use a"gold" whole wheat flour that I order from wheat Montana, it worked well in this recipe and it`s chemical-free.I also ground the raisins and then added some additional dried fruit blend consisting of cherries,blueberry and strawberry.I also added a scoop of no flavor soy based protein powder and got away with it! Thanks for a great muffin!

This is an excellent high fiber muffin recipe! and easy to make. Thank you Alan! I used buckwheat flour, egg replacer, soy milk and honey with the rest of the given ingredients and they came out great.

these turned out delicious!  changed it a bit... after reading the reviews I decied to replace 1 cup bran with white flour to make them less dense (they're still plenty dense),  I relpaced wheat germ with oats (very good decision!), and I added chopped walnuts and cinnamon. They are a great texture and not too dry.  They'll be excellent for breakfast or quick snacks.

These muffins are great! - But as Fabricgirl said ther is something missing - Salt.  The next time I try these muffins I will add 1/2 tsp salt.  I made a couple of changes too. I used 2 cups of blueberries - WOW! and I didn't have the malt barley flour but I added a tablespoon of flaxseed.  My husband really liked these muffins and he hates all things healthy.  I almost forgot - with the additional cup of berries - the recipe yeilded 18 muffins.  Thanks Jay!

THESE MUFFINS ARE REALLY GOOD AND TASTY. I ADDED CINNAMON CHIPS INSTEAD
OF THE RAISINS, AND ALSO SPRINKLED A LITTLE CINNAMON SUGAR ON THE
TOP. THEY WERE NOT TOO SWEET, BUT ADDED A LITTLE SWEETNESS TO IT.
THE ONLY THING THAT CONFUSED ME, WAS IN THE DIRECTIONS, IT DOESN'T 
MENTION ADDING THE OIL, HONEY OR THE RAISINS. I JUST ADDED THE OIL AND HONEY
TO THE LIQUID INGREDIENTS.
REALLY GOOD MUFFINS! THANKS!

The only changes I made was to add 1/4 cup of flax seen meal and I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain because that is what I had on hand. I also omitted the raisins because we don't like them. I thought it was the perfect sweetness with the vanilla yogurt, so if you are finding them not sweet enough, try that. They definitely do the job of cleaning out the system, which is why I think most of us seek these out. :)

These are great healthy bran muffins!  I omitted the oil and substituted 1/4c unsweetened applesauce instead, otherwise I left everything the same.   I may try adding in some crushed pineapple or substituting 1/2 of the honey with molasses, but overall these are really good as is!

These muffins are pretty good. They are easy to make compared with typical bran muffins. I find them to be sweet enough, but they are definitely bland. Either a whole lot of spices or a fruity sauce like strawberry rhubarb might add some excellent flavor. Adding 2 cups blueberries instead of raisins was an excellent idea.

I love to bake but I always found myself baking cookies, cakes & other unhealthy sweets so I decided to try & bake something healthy for once so I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Wow, I was surprised at how good they were.  I did add a little brown sugar to make them at least a bit sweet and I enjoyed them with a cup of coffee.  I would definitely bake them again.  I will add walnuts next time with the raisins.  Delish!

So far, so good!  Surprisingly, the ginger is not overwhelming in the taste.  I followed the ingredient list until finding I had only 1/2 cup raisins, so added craisins to make up the difference.  I also added 2-3 Tbl of natural sugar cane crystals since I like sweet muffins.  I added all the wet ingredients to my food processor, beating the eggs in there, and then gradually added the dry mix.  I followed one other reviewer's suggestion and piled the muffins high with batter.  It still made 15 muffins.  They were done just before 20 minutes were up, the toothpick test was clean, and they are moist even now 5 hours later. Definitely a "good and good for you" type of recipe!

Great recipe with lots of fiber!  I used buttermilk in place of the milk and yogurt.  Also used 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 1 tablespoon ginger.  Turned out very moist with the buttermilk!

This is a really good, hearty, healthy muffin! Just the right amount of sweetness from the honey and raisins a bran muffin should have. This muffin   has a very heavy dense texture and it didn't rise to much while baking. They are nice and moist too.  The only thing I did  differently was to cut back on the ginger.  I put in 1 Tsp and it was still a little spicy (IMO).  I think I'll leave it out all together next time.  THX

These muffins turned out fantastic! I would definitely recommend them, especially if you're trying to up your fibre intake. I made some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients. -I used white flour instead of whole wheat -Omitted the barley malt stuff because I didn't have any -Used 2/3 cup of cane sugar instead of honey= sweeter! -Added 1 tsp of cinnamon -Used dried apricots, raisins, and dates about 1 1/4 cups total -used one mashed banana to replace one of the eggs ... And they're really yummy!

Excellent muffin recipe! Don't expect a  cake-like texture - These are "true" whole grain muffins and have a dense texture. I added chopped dates along with the honey & raisins, and they came out surprisingly sweet. I followed the advice of the other reviewers to "pile-up" the batter in each tin, and came out with 12 large bakery style muffins (delicious). A DEFINATE KEEPER!!

So, these are awesome! And it uses no brown sugar etc. All healthy whole grains. I replaced the oil with applesauce, and flaxseed meal for the bulgar, I like them sweet, so I added 1/2 cup splenda, maybe just a smidge too much. I made 12 muffins, perfect size!! Pile it!!! The only thing is that mine too 30 min to cook. But well worth it. My daughter put 1/2 cup peanut butter/chocolate chocolate chips. Very moist...one day and almost all gone. Will absolutely make these probably atleast once a week.

If you're wanting a soft and sweet dessert muffin, this isn't the recipe for you. These muffins are only subtly sweet and definitely dense. Once or twice they've come out drier than I'd like. But the lack of sugariness is made up for in flavor complexity (especially if you toss in cranberries instead of raisins!) and they are really filling. Getting enough fiber is a challenge for me, since a lot of bran- and fiber-laden foods taste like sawdust, but this is a wholesome and tasty way to do it. I make these all the time, following the recipe almost exactly. Like I said, I sometimes throw in cranberries instead of raisins, or even mix them, and I always skip the malt barley flour. It's just not something I keep on hand, and I've found there's no significant difference in taste without it. Really excellent with a cup of strong coffee.

This bran muffin recipe is the best I have ever had. This is the first time I have baked them. I was worried about them being dry but they are not. I like everything about them. I did add 1/2 tsp. salt and used dry cranberry's instead of raisins only because I like them better. I left out the barley malt flour because I did not want to buy a bag of it for just one Tbsp. They are so good I cannot imagine the Tbsp. of flour making them any better. Maybe I did not need the salt but I always feel like a small amount won't hurt anything. Thank you Alan

These were the best bran muffins I've tried, but the number and expense of the ingredients is a drawback. 

I doubled the batch to get 28 muffins,  topped with nuts.

Finally, real bran muffins. I used soymilk and soy yogurt, plus flax in place of the eggs. I didn't have malt flour so I used barley malt syrup--you can definately taste the flavor and it's a good thing. I got 24 regular sized muffins and 16 mini muffins, so it does make a fair bit more than the stated 12.

Excellent.  I only bake half the batter at once because the baked muffins dry out quickly.  I prefer to chop the raisins or add chocolate chips for the kids.

This is a great recipe.  I added a chopped apple, some oats, and some flaxseed meal.  I also added some ground cloves and nutmeg.  This recipe has a great, full, bran flavor.  I think it's neither too dense nor too fluffy, about right for bran muffins.

This a great base bran muffin.  They are hearty, which is what I look for in a bran muffin.  We add plenty of frozen berries and nuts.

I love these muffins, but they're even better with nuts.  The only problems I encounter are that they stick to my pans and I always have to cook them for at least 30 minutes.

I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil and diced prunes instead of raisins, adding them in one muffin at a time...next time I will use more prunes. Instead of oat bran I used ground flax seed and I substituted rolling oats for the barley flour (because I didn't have any). These were really good...the highest fiber muffins I could find! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  These muffins are very good, although they are dense, they are great for breakfast with OJ or coffee, or a mid-day snack.  One of the best recipes I've found on this site thus far, would recommend to anyone.

tried it without raisins, with raisins, and tonite made it with chopped apples. will probably try it with chopped pears and alter the spices to suit.  it is a good base hi-fiber muffin that can be altered each time you make it.  able to toss in walnuts and a bit of ground flax seed meal.  tried it with nonfat sour cream instead of plain yogurt.  tried it with yogurt too.  it's really a good go-to kind of reliable recipe that can stand up to a lot of changes to suit.

I love these muffins. They are a great way to add fiber to your diet. Only change I made was to substitute ground flax seed for the barley flour. These do make 12 muffins - just use a regular 12-muffin pan and really pile the batter in there! Let them go over the top - they don't rise at all when they bake, and when you are done, you'll have the perfect bakery-type muffins with the big tops. Trust me - I thought the same thing and made 24 muffins with this once, and they were like hockey pucks. I was dubious but my husband kept saying, just make 12 and pile it on! He was right! :) These also taste better, in my opinion, if you store them in the fridge. I like them much better cold! Thanks for a great healthy recipe!

I tried this recipe because I am making the change to whole foods.  I went to the organic store and bought all the ingredients. As I was mixing it together it looked like a lot of flour for just 12 muffins.  I have re-read the recipe over and over and I didn't do anything different but my muffins turned out horrible.  They were dry and heavy. I love bran but this just did not turn out how I expected.  I ended up with a lot of extra batter, even after filling up 12 muffin tins.  They need something more. Mine were really dry.  If I made this again I might cut the flour portions in half and add very moist fruit to make it more moist.  I would probably add a little salt as well and maybe a little more honey.

These muffins had a great texture and were very moist. The flavor was good but since I don't care much for raisins and omitted this ingredient, they were in need of a little something. I think this recipe makes a really good basic bran muffin to which other items could be added for flavor (bananas, apples, nuts, etc.). Thanks!

I've made a lot of healthy muffins in my day. I can't find a recipe that I'm totally in love with, but these were pretty good. They come out of the oven looking just about the same as when they went in. They tasted better after they had cooled. I used large golden raisins, and a t of vanilla since I was using plain yogurt. Instead of the ginger I used my homemade pumpkin pie spice. I halved the recipe & was expecting to make 6 muffins, but ended up with 12. They are hard to get out of the paper liners, so I would spray Pam in them next time. I also left out the Barley Malt Flour since I didn't have any.

I went to my local organic foods store to try and find all the ingredients in this recipe.  If I found all the ingredients, I was going to make it.  Well, I did, and it was well worth it!  A great breakfast item...they taste like I bought them from a bakery!

These taste just you expect a bran muffin to.  My kids wouldn't touch them (no surprise)but my husband and I liked them pretty well.  Good roughage and good breakfast food.  It was interesting to use some of the ingredients that were new to me.

So delicious and plenty of fiber. I used soy milk and soy yogurt instead of dairy and the muffins were amazing. The mix looks a little wet after combination but that's what keeps it moist.

I made a batch of these for a camping trip earlier this year and they turned out great! I couldn't find barley malt flour so I just left that out. I used dried blueberries instead of raisins. We ate a couple of these each morning and they gave us plenty of energy till lunch. Definitely a healthy and wholesome muffin.

Great hearty breakfast or anytime muffin. Full of good tasting bran too! I used maple syrup instead of honey and found them to be great. I thought they would be too sweet but found them to be perfect! Based on other reviews I cut the recipe by half and yielded 6 jumbo muffins. I'm going to add diced apple next time. Delicious and I'll absolutely make these again and again and again. Thanks JPW94!

Nice high-fiber muffin recipe!!  I susbstituted wheat bran and barley malt flour with a mixture of oat bran, quick-cooking oats and flaxseed.  Also added a 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp cinnamon (instead of ginger).  Oh, and used mashed bananas instead of raisins.  Even with the additional sugar, the muffin wasn't very sweet.  So, if you have a sweet tooth, I suggest adding more sugar.  Definitely fill the muffin cup to almost full but don't overpile, or your muffins will overflow and stick to one another!

I am a runner and am always looking for ways to eat real food in better ways.  This muffin came out medium-dense, straight from the oven, chock full of fruit.  I used "cleaned wheat bran" from Sprouts, which is very light and fluffy, as well as the oat bran, both of which I was able to buy cheaply from the bulk foods bin.  I was unable to find barley malt flour, so I used a tablespoon of flaxseed.  Instead of milk, I used the same quantity of apple juice, and simmered dried fruits, - raisins, blueberries, cherries, and cranberries,- in the juice to plump them up.  I also reduced honey to 1/3 cup, and simmered it with apple juice and fruit.  After mixing the wet ingredients with the dry, I added about 1/3 cup more juice so as to moisten the batter a bit more, as the dry bran absorbs liquid like a sponge.  I also followed advice and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1teaspoon nutmeg and cinnamon for taste.  I am happy with the results!

Absolutely fantastic! Easy to make and so tasty. I stuck with  the original recipe but also added chia seeds and raw flax seeds. I consider bran muffins to be medicinal if you know what I mean, so I just had to add even more fiber. This was just the recipe I was looking for!

I make these wonderful muffins every two or three weeks.  They are a bit too sweet for me so I use 1/3 c honey, 1/3 c molasses, and I add 2 tsp cinnamon, which goes well with the ginger.  I also reduce the milk to 3/4 c to make the batter thick enough to use a release scoop (about 1/3 c) and flatten slightly to make breakfast cookies. I add lots of chopped walnuts and/or pecans and sometimes even coconut. I have never made this recipe using malted barley flour because I can't find it, but it's very good without it.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years and I follow all of it other than the barley malt flour (don't have it) and don't like raisins in the muffins, plus I reduce the honey by half. They are sweet enough with that amount for me. Usually I include 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup walnuts in it for extra texture and flavor. They are very moist and will not venture to use any other bran muffin recipe. The last time I also included 1 tsp of cinnamon, very good. They are called "Super fibre bombs" in our household.

This was my first time making muffins - replaced raisins with craisins - turned out great!
