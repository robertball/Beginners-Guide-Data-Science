This was a nice change to plain ranch dressing. Used it on a greek salad for something different than a vinagerette. I would suggest making homemade ranch and not using bottled, it tastes fresher that way. Scaled this down to 12 servings.

I hate ranch dressing so never keep it. I substituted Greek yogurt with a clove of garlic and I cut the portions via the editing tool. So good!!!

We really dug this!  I was making a Greek Sausage Salad for dinner and stumbled upon this recipe in the newest reviews.  It looked like a winner and I had everything on hand (save olives and green pepper), so we gave it a whirl.  I will definately make this again.  It's very versatile and easily tweaked for personal preference/slightly different directions.  THANKS for sharing, Shamash!

I like that this is homemade dressing and I can tweak to how I like it;  fat free sour cream and Ranch dressing mix instead of bottle dressing and has no oil in it. As written it is too much black  pepper for me. I eat this with veggies, salad, and chicken.  Good on lots of foods!
