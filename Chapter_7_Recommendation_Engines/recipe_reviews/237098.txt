I asked - what should I do with this broccoli? Answer - I don't know, can you make some kind of broccoli/tomato mix? I found this most interesting recipe - and it is delicious!! I did not have pine nuts, so for my serving, I tossed in some dry roasted edamame (that was a snack in my pantry that I did not like eating by itself - and it added some crunch, and did not kill the dish LOL). Next time tho, I will get the pine nuts.  Nice tantalizing combo of flavors, am definitely adding it to my 'pass down' recipe list!!

A tasty and interesting side dish to complement most any main dish.  I omitted the pine nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  We enjoyed how the different flavors came together, and I will definitely make this again.

I omitted nuts and used half broccoli and half romanesco. This is really good. It's probably going to become a regular in our household.
