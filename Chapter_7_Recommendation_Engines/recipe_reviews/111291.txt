This is just how my Danish family taught me - except that my Gram would either mix in dillweed, or sprinkle fresh dill over them when serving. Very addicting!

The meatballs were excellent!! and true to the recipe... one thing I might add is to make gravy with the drippings... When finished cooking meatballs, remove the meatballs from the pan to a plate with paper towels. Add about 2/3cup of milk in the pan under medium heat... Slowly add a flour paste ( add 2tbs of flour to 4tbs of hot water) and stir with the pan drippings and milk until thicken... The gravy makes the meatballs!!

These are fantastic!  We cook them in butter for 2-3 minutes each side.  Serve them with parsley potatoes and red cabbage.

pretty good frikadellar, but you forgot the cloves! A pinch of ground cloves makes all the difference. Also, I use ground beef instead of the veal & it still comes out great. Serve with browned potatoes & red cabbage...yum!!!!

one BIG ingredient missing that is what makes frikadellar ..frikadellar.  that's ground cloves.  absolutely necessary for this recipe. also lots of Danes substitute ground pork for the veal. either way is good. grating the onion is also a must for correct texture. good overall,  but I couldnt get over the spice omission

This is pretty much the same recipe I have.  Friends mom makes it every year.  She uses 50/50 soda instead of seltzer.  Good flavor booster.

My husband & I went to Scandinavia for our honeymoon last year, and have been looking for a recipe for the meatballs we loved while over there.  This comes very close, but we used the sweet/savory spice suggestions from another recipe here (ginger, nutmeg, allspce).  Made a gravy with the pan drippings & a little cream.  Ate them with lingonberries that we brought back with us.  Awesome!

this recipe is great, if a little bland. 
 We had these weekly in my youth.  My mom, grandma and tante's always added ground nutmeg.  Some used milk instead of selzer, and often used beef, pork and veal.  Served with caramelized potatoes and either red cabbage or beets.  Rodgrod med flode or aebelkage for dessert.

This was just amazing, but I only  gave it 4  stars for two reasons...I read some of the other reviews and looked at a few recipes, and I think that cloves and nutmeg  (in very small amounts) do a lot for the recipe and is worth adding.  I added about 1/4 tsp of both. Secondly, it doesn't tell you how to make a 'brown sauce' which kinda sucks.  I used 2 brown gravy packets and the recommended amount of water and finished it with a touch of cream.  The end result was ridiculously good, but it took some work to figure out how to get there.

DOUBLE THIS RECIPE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT. Especially if there are more than two of you, and one is a teenager.  My MIL is Danish, and she makes this as a basic recipe, usually with pork only.  I accidentally got some ground lamb instead of veal, and it was delicious! Cannot do wrong with this recipe.  Unless you don't make enough, you have been warned!  Add whatever you want (dill, cloves, garlic, fennel) and it is so good!

I thought it was a bit wet... Ended up adding a handful of rolled oats like my mom does in her recipe.  Other than that - it was pretty authentic!  Both of my parents are Danish....

One of my favorite dishes to make so easy and simple. I also make Egg noodles and a light Dill cream sauce to accompany this.

Only 4 stars b/c I agree with earlier comments. Need either allspice or cloves.  In addition to crumbs, I added oatmeal. Then more milk to deal w/the oatmeal. Absolutely need to chill. Make in the AM or afternoon so it has several hours to absorb the bread crumbs, flour, and oatmeal. Finally, Grandma never made meatballs, but meat patties. They get crunchy! Serve w/noodles tossed w/ green cabbage sauteed w/caraway.

Pretty much the same recipe I got from my former Mother in Law with the exception of the seltzer water.  What that do for the meatballs, just curious!

My husband makes a similar recipe and we like to serve them with dumplings made in a cream of mushroom gravy. Yum
