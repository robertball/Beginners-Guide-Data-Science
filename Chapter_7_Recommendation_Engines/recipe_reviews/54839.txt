As submitter of this recipe, I would like to make the following comments based on the reviews that I have read. 

Many of the reviews state that it is too salty; I admittedly love salt so the amount of salt may indeed be too much for some. I would point out that if you are using table salt to cut the amount of salt in 1/2. 

Many users also ask if this is good on other cuts of meat, I use it on all cuts of meat (beef and pork) especially roast. For poultry, I might suggest replacing the oregano with sage.

This is the First sirloin tip roast that I have made that turned out to excel in flavor and texture.  I have tried many times before to make a tip roast with them all ending up to be tough and dry.  Your recipe produced comments by all, that it tasted just like prime rib!  It was tender and juicy and flavorful.   It turned out excellent!  The recipe is called herb, but it is more on the spicy side...not overwhelming though.   I did follow the recipe to a T...however I put the spice rub on and let the meat come to room tempature before baking.  After an hour of cooking, I checked the meat for internal tempature of 140 degrees (rare) and when it reached that temperature, I turned off the oven and allowed it to sit another 15 to 30 minutes in the oven to produce medium rare.  Came out excellent!!  Thank you very much for sharing this excellent recipe!

Very, very good.  The meat turned out moist and tender.  I cooked mine in the crockpot for 6 hours on low and 1 hour on high.  The spices were wonderful.

This was truly delicious!  I substituted fresh chopped garlic for the garlic powder and lowered the temp a bit.  I had a 5 pound roast so I dropped the temp to 325 and cooked it for about an hour.  (Until the temp reached 135), then I rested it while I made the gravy and mashed the potatoes.  This roast produced one of the best gravies I've ever made.  I cooked it on a rack in a shallow baking pan and put a can of beef broth and a couple of bay leaves underneath it.  While the beef rested I strained the broth into a butter roux.  (The broth had concentrated and it was a little salty so I added about 1/2 cup of water.)  The resulting gravy was delicious.  I'll definitely use this rub again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used a 3 lb tri tip roast for the meat.  Combined the ingredients and put the roast in a big baggie and put the rub all over it and let it marinate in the fridge for 4 hours.  Cooked it on my grill using the indirect method for about 36 minutes.  You have to let it rest for 10 minutes or so.  But oh my god!!!!  We all just LOVED it.  The meat was so juicy and tender and so very very tasty!!  If I could, I would have given this 10 stars!!!  Served it with potato salad and fresh corn on the cob.  SCRUMPTIOUS!!

very tasty!  i needed to cook it less time, though... i like it medium rare.  i followed the directions but it kinda got too well done.  my parents used to cook a roast at 200 degrees, one hour per pound and it came out perfecto.  i shall try this rub with their timing next time.  I loved that I had all the ingredients to this rub!  thanx

This is such a good combination of spices! I use it for more than just this particular recipe, too:

One variation I enjoy, particularly, is to add a couple tablespoons of flour to the mixture, then I braise the meat shortly before putting it into the oven to cook; the "blackened" crust that forms on the roast is second only to the amazing gravy that comes from the drippings.

My fiance and his brother will never be able to eat at home anymore because I've outdone their mom...

The best rub I've ever made. Followed it to a tee but used 1/2 T of table salt instead of 1 T kosher. Used a 2 lb tri tip roast at 350 for 45 minutes (until 140 degree internal), turned off heat, let sit for 15 minutes, remove from oven, cover with foil, and sit another 10 minutes. Came out perfectly medium rare.

I love rubbed roasts, and mixing the herbs and spices with olive oil ensures the flavors will stick. The 15 min. rest time allows dried herbs to swell, the oil to  absorb flavors, and helps make all very easily spreadable. This roast comes out exactly medium rare, the way we like it. An instant-read meat thermometer is essential, especially when roasting for guests.

All I can say is YUM!  I used minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and added some celery seed.  I roasted it with carrots, celery, onion, cauliflower, asparagas, and red pepper and a splash of port to keep the veggies from drying out.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Sirloin Tip is a lovely cut of beef, inexpensive, and if prepared properly, tender and flavorful.  It's like a cross between bottom sirloin and bottom round, quite similar to rump roast.  I've read that it's not really sirloin properly speaking, and since it's so lean it can be tough if cooked at high temps.  Low, slow and medium rare is best, just like rump roast.  However, I must concur with another reviewer here - NO crock pot please!  A slow cooker will make this into pot roast, and there are much better (and even cheaper) cuts for that, like chuck.  Sirloin Tip can have a steak-like flavor and texture, and I think few of us would pass up steak in favor of pot roast!

I've made this twice, first time as written, and the consensus is correct - it's more spicy than herby.  It's like a spicier version of Linberg & Snider Porterhouse and Roast Seasoning.  That's pretty high praise, and it can be a nice change of pace from that old standby.  But just like that mix, it's better in moderation.  Pasting it on is a bit much, and second time around I omitted the oil from the mixture and instead applied it directly to the roast, then dusted with the dry spices.  MUCH better that way, IMHO.

Then my standard Sirloin Tip prep - sear in a fry pan, browning all sides; insert an electronic in-oven thermometer into the thickest part and roast at 225F until the center reads 140F.  Take it out and cover, let it sit for 15 minutes, slice thinly.  Beef heaven!

For anyone thinking of making this in your slow cooker... DONT!! Cheap meats are for braising (pot roasting). Good cuts of meat like a sirloin are best with dry roasting- no liquid!

For my roast cooking impaired self, this was super easy and turned out fantastic. The thing that needs emphasis, if there are others of you out there like me, is that this needs to be slice paper thin! We sliced it 1/4 inch thick and it was tough, but then tried it paper thin and it was just as tender as prime rib. For those of you that know you are supposed to slice this type of roast thin, sorry this is for the rest of the people out there like me that have no clue :) I followed the recipe to a tee, but only used 1/2 of the salt and half of the cayennne and it was still spicy (not the meat, but the gravy was). Also I put a cup of beef broth and a cup of water with a few bay leaves in the bottom of the pan while it roasted for the gravy. SUPER YUMMY!

excellent!!! I halved the cayenne (for the kiddos) and used some italian seasoning instead of oregano/thyme (crushing italian seasoning in the palm of my hand before adding, as it releases fresher flavor)We also used veggie oil as hubby detests EVO.  I let a 6.5# sirloin roast marinate for about 6 hours in the fridge.  Added quartered potatoes, sliced onion and beef broth to pan, put roast on small rack in middle, and foil wrapped the whole thing. then roasted in 325 oven for 2.5 hrs (didn't let meat get fully to room temp b4 roasting, only sat out 30 mins) OMG it was so delicious!  It made the best au jus as well!  whole family devoured it, and it's rare for everyone to agree on anything!  next day we sliced remaining meat thin and warmed up in au jus and it made the greatest sandwiches!  tytyty for a great recipe, and tytyty for this allrecipes community for great reviews that let originally clueless cooks like me make masterpieces such as this!

This is a keeper.  I made a 5 1/2 lb roast on the Weber BBQ - indirect.  Estimating 17 minutes a pound - it was wonderful.  I let it rest, covered in foil for about 20 - 30 minutes to let the juices re absorb.  It was tasty and tender.  Thanks for a great recipe. BTW - if you are looking for a rare to medium rare roast - take it off at 130 and let rest.  You won't be disappointed.

can you say "wash the beef OFF please?" once again i fall in the few--this was WAY too spicy. of course i used high quality paprika that is hot in itself.  and i DID wash the beef rub off. 1 hour was also painfully short to cook. sorry--my mouth is burning and i feel a little unkind...

First time reviewing, but wanted to say the flavours were DELICIOUS. I ended up with a wee bit more cayenne than intended, so a minor extra kick. Substituted regular salt(1 1/2 tsp) since my kosher has gone missing. Baked the 1 hour, turned off and left for 15. Then another 5ish minutes on the cutting board with foil overtop. The temperature was a perfect medium-rare(our favourite), so obviously one would cook it a bit longer for more well done. Diners were myself, the hubby, and our 15 year old daughter. Two of our 4 children are open-minded eaters and she's one of them. RAVE REVIEWS! A long silence while they were devouring their plates. If we all had more room in our stomachs, and more meat leftover, we would have eaten more. Only little 'tip' of my own I would add is to put the meat fat-side up, if there is any fat on your roast. The fat melts away from the heat and goes down through the rest of the meat, making it -extra- juicy.

I got a 2lb sirloin tip on sale, reduced the spices to 2/3 of each and the salt to a half. I only use smoked sweet paprika and that gave it an amazing smokey scent and flavor.I left out the cayenne. I didn't have onion powder so I quartered a medium onion and threw it in a Pyrex dish with the roast and baked uncovered. I am concerned about cooking in/with aluminum. I make all my chicken and beef roasts in Pyrex dishes they don't require greasing or adding water either, the meat will give out it's own juices and it never sticks. I reduced the baking heat  25 degrees as you should with baking in Pyrex dishes and roasted it 30 minutes per lb because I prefer it medium. My roast came out tender and perfect and released about half a cup of delicious juice/gravy in the pan. Make sure to let it sit when done as indicated or else most of the inner juices will run out while cutting and your meat will end up being tough.  Hubby gave it a thumbs up. He had to have a sandwich immediately! Overall we loved the herbs and spices and the roast was a great success.  I also threw in some potatoes and eggplants to roast on the bottom rack :) nice sides to go with it. It's a keeper.

The spices in this rub are fabulous!! The roast was outstanding, it was juicy, and flavorful and cooked to perfection. We did a 12.5 lb roast and sliced the leftovers thin for sandwiches the next day and it was still tasty and not at all dry.

Very good.  However, it took 1 hour and 1/2 just to get it to rare and probably another 15 minutes or so to get it to medium.

DELICIOUS The only thing I did different is what my Mother always did. Before I rub the meat with the seasonings I rub the entire piece of meat with gravy master or kitchen boquet it seals in the juices and makes a really nice gravy then I put the meat on a rack instead of sitting it directly on the bottom of the pan. I also mixed one package of dry onion soup with a 15 oz. can of beef broth and poured it into the bottom of the pan~ I kept an eye on this to make sure it does not dry out.If so add a small amount of water. I will always use this recipe it was awesome. Thank you

The oven isn't really used in Japanese cuisine and my mother is Japanese and I sometimes live in Japan so I'm not that experienced at roasting meat.  In fact, huge chunks of meat are not encountered in Asian cooking.  So I always have trouble with "doneness."  I like my meat rare--just de-horn it, wipe its rear and plate it.  My BF likes it med-rare, so we need to compromise.  I've made this roast a few times and I've had a devil of a time getting the doneness correct.  One thing I've noticed about Americans is that they are too worried about meat safety issues ao they tend to cook things til they dry out, esp. chicken. Or maybe overzealous food safety nazis and corporations fearing litigation are the causes for skewed guidelines.  So the guidelines and temperatures on doneness are way too high.  If you want med rare, take this roast out at 125F on the meat thermometer.  It will continue to cook after removal from the oven.  This roast can increase in internal temperature very quickly so keep a careful eye on it.  Since I apply the rub and insert garlic slits and leave overnight, I take it out a few hours before cooking to let it come to room temp before cooking to ensure even roasting.

I can't understand some of the less than shining reviews on this. This rub is awesome and so easy- I always have the ingredients. I didn't find it salty at all. The only thing I did was take down the cayenne because of the kids- not sure how much I actually did use. It smelled wonderful while cooking. I took it out at 140 and covered with foil for 15 minutes- sliced it thin was a great medium rare. Turned a cheap roast into a gourmet roast. Best part is that it wasn't stringy boiled slow cooker meat. Great with horseradish and a glass of wine. Thanks for sharing this gem...

Sirloin tip roasts aren't exactly the most tender cuts of beef but they have a great flavor and this rub is the PERFECT compliment for this type of roast.  The consistency of the rub is excellent and it doesn't overpower. I always cook a sirloin tip to 150 degrees and let it sit 15 minutes which gives the meat the perfect pink appearance.  You don't want to overcook this beef or it will be EXTREMELY tough to chew. Also be sure to line the baking sheet with foil as per the recipe as some of the the drippings tend to really take hold while baking.

This is an awesome recipe! The rub was sooo good. I did like others and cut the salt down to my taste and glad I did. What's nice is you can cook it to your desired wellness. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this many times.  Men LOVE this!  Actually, everyone loves this. Leftovers make absolutely killer sandwiches! A few tips I've gleaned from the other reviewers- 1. Take the meat out of the fridge a full hour before you cook it.  2.  Don't overcook it.  It needs to be pink in the middle.  3. After cooking, let it sit 10 minutes before slicing.  That will help hold juices in the meat.  There'll be plenty of juice in the pan, which is so delicious!

Great Flavor! 
I made this with a 4.75lb rolled roast. Rubbed seasoning all over meat and let it sit for about 1 hour. I then put it in a shallow pan with a rack on the bottom. Per another reviewer, I added a cup of beef broth to help with making gravy after. I cooked this at a 325 oven for 1 hour, then 30 min at 350 until temp was about 135 and then took it out and sat it on my counter covered with foil for about 30 min for a PERFECT med rare roast. SOOOOO tender and great flavor. My three teenage sons and husband finished the whole roast for dinner! 
They left me one slice ...so nice of them :)
I will be making this for years to come. 
Thank you for this recipe! 
btw- the gravy was Wonderful with the drippings....I saved the broth I was not going to use from this to make gravy,  in ice cubes in the freezer for making soup or more gravy in the future.

Very good.  It was my first time making a Sirloin Tip ROast and this recipe is a keeper.  Next time I will cook it to 135 degrees.  It was a little too done for my liking.

I made this last night, I used pork boneless sirloin. It was perfect my husband liked it so much. I just have to change a few ingredients because I did not have everything I substituted the oregano and thyme to  herbes de provence, used garlic salt powder and lessen my salt. I read in one of the reviews that it's a bit salty so instead 1 tbsp. I only used 1 tsp. (too much salt is not good for you anyway)  and just 1 tbsp. paprika. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Forget pot roast...this is our favorite way to eat roast.  We usually cook it on the grill for easy cleanup...plus it cooks faster and comes out perfect on the inside.

Great roast!  I used the recipe as written and it came out as a perfect classic.  Literally the best roast I've ever made and I've been cooking for 40 years.  I prefer this to a dry rub.  And again, if it was too salty, it's because you didn't use kosher salt which has approx. half the sodium.

Sooo good!  I made this exact to the recipe.  I also tossed some mini potatoes and carrots with the seasonings and olive oil and threw them into the pan with the roast.  When the roast was done I removed it from the pan and put the veggies back in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes to get them crispy.  A+ recipe.  Will be using over and over again.

Fantastic.  Hubby kept commenting on how perfect it was with every bite!  I ate much more in one sitting that I wouldn't have believed before!  I was just bummed that we didn't have any horseradish, lol.  This is my number one roasting recipe from now on!

I have to say the "rub" you suggest to put on the roast is UNREAL, within a few minutes of putting the roast into the oven the whole house smelled wonderful. The roast was so tender and the taste and smell unlike this world thank you for sharing the "rub".

I did not like the paprika at all and would not use it again.  Next time I would use the other spices and leave out the paprika.  I also added flour to the rub and it did help to make a great gravy (which I would have preferred paprika-free).  As with all beef roasts I cook, I cooked it for 15 minutes at 475 degrees and then cooked it the rest of the time at 250 degrees.  It was so tender and cut like a tenderloin.

I am happier than a pig in mud with this recipe.  I followed as stated.  I did not even cut the salt, which I debated for personal reasons.  I did use Kosher, I can see if you are using table salt you would cut it.  I did cut the cayenne to 1/8, just because I did want to overpower the kid.  This meat and directions came out so tender and juicey.  It sliced perfectly.  Always remember meat should be at almost room temp before putting oven or grilling.  Do not put cold meat directly in oven or grill.  Huge difference.  Joel if you were close by I would kiss you!  Thanks a million!

Great flavor.  I the recipe exactly for the rub.  I didn't have time to cook the roast in the oven so I put it in the crock pot with 1 cup of beef broth.  After 4 hrs on high it was a little dry but that was my fault.  Next time I'll start with 2 hrs on high or 4 on low.  I made a great gravy with the liquid in the crock pot by adding a little milk and corn starch and boiling until thickened.

OK...so I was looking for a roast recipe that differed from the standard cream of mushroom - onion soup mix stuff and came across this.  One word: EXCELLENT!!!  I used this on a 3lb chuck roast and after marinating it in the rub overnight, threw it in the crock pot along with some mushrooms and beef broth and voila - perfection.  My boyfriend claimed it was the best roast ever and aside from my dad's I would have to agree!  Leftovers were even better.  Thanks much for posting the recipe!

Best roast I have ever fixed! Used ingredients to the letter, thats the only way I feel like you can honestly rate a recipe however, I rubbed the roast then put in fridge for a few hours, then took out and brought to room temp, baked at 350 wrapped tightly in foil when I took it out of the oven was floating in juice!! left wrapped to rest at least 15 minutes will use this recipe again and again, also I cut it very thin and you did not even need a knife to cut it up, wonderfull!!

Awesome taste! I made the rub exactly as stated. Cooked to an internal temperature of 135 and then let it sit for 15 minutes until it reached 145. Used the drippings to make gravy, however it was very salty gravy. The roast did not taste salty at all. Added extra water to the gravy to alleviate the saltiness. Served with Yorkshire Pudding, mashed potatoes and glazed carrots with brussels sprouts. Too good for words!

I used this rub for the first time and it worked out perfectly.  I didn't have onion powder but it didn't matter.  I left the rub (minus onion powder) on the roast overnight in the fridge and the next day, cooked the roast in the oven until the meat thermometer read 140°F. I let it sit for a few minutes (about 10 minutes) before slicing and serving it.  The wonderful herb rub gave a fantastic flavor to the sirloin, and it was cooked just right, medium rare and tender.

YUMMY!  Full of flavor, and for my tastes, not too spicy or salty. I rubbed the herbs into the roast and let it set for 6 hours.  A keeper.

There was too much cayenne pepper in this for our liking and it made the gravy so spicy that the kids wouldn't eat it.  My husband didn't even finish a full slice.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with all the leftovers.

This recipe was excellent. The only advice I would give readers is to make sure they use a good quality paprika. I used a smoked sweet Spanish variety. This can make or break the dish. Flavor was superb. Try to let stand overnight if possible...adds even more of the deliscious flavor from the rub.

This came out great!  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  I made some alterations, based on other reviews: I was using table salt, so I only used 1 tsp.  I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and paprika to 1/2 TBSP.  Instead of garlic powder, I used 2 tsp minced garlic.  I put the spices, oil, and roast in a plastic ziplock bag and shook well to coat.  I let it marinate overnight and brought it to room temp (about 1 hr) before cooking.  I used a shallow roasting pan and put the raost on top of a rack.  I added 1 can beef broth, 2 bay leaves, and half a sweet onion (sliced) to the bottom of the pan.  It took about 1hr 5 min for my 3lb sirloin to reach 135 degrees (in the center).  I removed it from the oven, and let it sit (covered) for about 15 min before slicing.  The ends came out med well, and the center was a perfect med rare.  I will definitely make again, but next time take the roast out of the oven at 130 degrees, as I like my beef rare.

The cooking method in this recipe was absolutely fantastic- I will certainly make roasts this way again as the meat was perfectly cooked and very juicy. The spice rub, however was out of balance. My family loves things spicy but there was WAY too much paprika and cayenne- these spices completely overpowered the other flavours. Next time, I'll adjust the spice more to our liking (cut the paprika down to a teaspoon and the cayenne by at least half, maybe more). 



That being said- spice mixes do tend to relate to personal preference. The cooking method was excellent and that's why I've given 4 stars. I'll make this again with tweaks to the spice.

Divine. I cooked the roast in the slow cooker on high for about 5 hours, which may have been overkill, but it was fall-apart delicious!

This was the BEST roast we have ever had!  Thank you so much for sharing.  Here is what I did:  Seared the roast on all sides while it was still semi-frozen.    Placed it in a container with the rub and marinated it for about 4 hours.  Baked it at 300 until it reached an internal temp of 140.    Tented it with foil (and left the thermometer in) for about 15 minutes.      Honestly, the rub is amazing and I will use this recipe for the rest of my life now!!

I was tired of ho-hum roasts that all taste the same so I decided to give this a try especially since we like hot, spicy food.  It was very good (my husband still talks about how good it tasted!) but like other reviewers, I cut the salt down.  Aside from using the sauce for au jus, another good idea is to use it as gravy by draining it into another pot, adding a beef bouillon cube and some corn starch. :-)

I think this rub is excellent.  I always use it whenever I make a Sirloin Tip Roast.  I use this recipe exactly as written and it cooks perfectly and tastes delicious.  I just love it, and so do my guests.

Tasty but I used less salt because I didn't have Kosher salt. I used one teaspoon of salt and it was still  a bit too salty.

This is a decent base rub to springboard off of.  I replaced the cayenne with dry mustard powder and omitted the thyme.

I've read some reviews about how moist and tender the roast was. I don't attribute that to the rub, since there isn't anything in it that tenderizes at all.  It just provides some flavour, which I didn't find to be too salty at all.

Awesome!  Followed instructions to a T (doubled the rub, as I had a 5 lb roast).  Turned out perfect.  Think this could easily replace the prime rib roast at Christmas!!

I had a small cut 2.25 lbs. only cooked for 45 mins.  Should have stayed in a bit longer.  My roast was great! This rub is AMAZING!

This recipe makes an excellent roast as is, but it also works very well when prepared as directed but slow cooked in a crock pot.  The left-overs from this (if there are any) can be slow-cooked again to make pulled beef barbacue, and the herb crust cooks into the sauce to give a nice kick!!

I gave this recipe 4 stars 'cause I loved it. But I had to tweak it a bit. One hour was not enough time for roast to cook..... make sure you use a meat thermometer!  Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. I also cut back on the black pepper and the cayene pepper, it made the gravy too spicy! and I love great gravy.  For tougher cuts of meat I will use this rub and then sear the roast, wrap it in tinfoil to cook and it turns out GREAT!!

WOW!!! I've finally found a recipe worth reviewing.  I had to make 2 copies of this just to send home with my guests.  Only change I made was cut the cayenne in half (were light weights here).  I rubbed the roast and let it sit overnight in the fridge in a zipper bag, then threw it in the crockpot on high for 5 hours.  PERFECTION!!!!

A great tasting rub.  I prepared the rub and rubbed it into the meat, wrapped the meat up in clear wrap and let it sit in the frig for 3 hrs. since I had the time.  I cooked my roast (only 1 1/2 lbs.) at 450 for 25 min., added a cup of water, reduced to 375 and cooked for another 25 min., basting it until it reached 150 temp.  Let it sit while I made the gravy.  I served it with Roasted Garlic Cauliflower (on this site) and mashed potatoes.

Great seasoning! I would like to add a little bit of brown sugar, just to sweeten it a bit, and I used fresh chopped garlic instead of g. powder, amazing. I added vegetables to the mix and the flavor of the veggies. I could eat them all day if I had the chance. I let the meat stand at room temp while marinating before cooking it. It turned out perfect. Great recipe.

didn't care for this recipe. Won't be making it again.... at least won't be baking it in the house. Might be better grilled after it has time to marinate!

This was the best roast beef I've ever made. The rub was great but of course doesn't flavour through the meat.....as expected. But the cooking instrucions for the roast made it absolutely perfect. I think this rub would give a lot more flavour to chicken.

I couldn't remember what cut of meat I bought and was afraid that it was a pot roast so I used this rub on it hoping it would give it enough flavor and tenderness to make it worth eating.I made the rub exactly as directed and used the full amount of kosher salt and didn't think it was too salty at all! I let the rub sit about 15-20 minutes and then rubbed it on the meat (which was at room temp). I baked it at 350 and after about 30 minutes I checked the temp and it was at 150. I turned the oven off and let it sit inside for about 5 more minutes before removing it completely from the oven. It made quite a bit of juice, which leads me to believe that it was a sirloin.  I let the meat rest for about 10 minutes before cutting it and then poured all the drippings over the cut meat. We didn't have potatoes with our meal so we just used the drippings as they were as a dip for the meat and it was wonderful! Just the right amount of flavor and spice. This is the 2nd or 3rd time I have used this recipe and every time the flavor is fantastic! Thanks for sharing.

This produces outstanding flavor. But for real out-of-this world Roast Beef, follow these instructions: If you have time, marinate the roast 8+ hours. Place tri tip roast on shallow rack in roasting pan. Roast at 375 for 30 minutes, lower heat to 250 and continue to roast until internal thermometer reaches desired doneness (160 for medium, my personal favorite). Mouth watering!

I used a bottom roast, and it worked beautifully cooked very slowly (250 degrees) to an internal temperature of 140 degrees.  This generally tough cut of beef turned out marvelously tender and delightfully seasoned.

I trimmed it before I seasoned it.  My hubby said it was delicious and confided, "Much better than my mom used to make!"  But, I did make it in the slow cooker.  With two little ones, it was super easy and my kids LOVEd it.  Even with a little bit of a spicy kick.  I had it on a low setting and let it sit all day long.  It was just perfect, juicy, and fell apart.  Will surely make again!

After reading the other reviews I was hopeful but cautious when it came to the proportions of the spice  mixtures in the rub.  Looking at my 3 lb roast I was pretty sure that 2 tbsp of salt was going to be a lot for our taste so I cut it to 1.5 tbsp.  then I am thinking,  1/2 tsp of cyanne pepper.  that is A LOT of hot pepper.  We like things spicy (no really, we do) but that's a whole lot so I cut it in half.  Oh and I was out of thyme so I used sage but that's not really worth mentioning.  Cooked it exactly as directed and was in the end very very happy.  But I don't care what anyone else says that is one mad spicy roast.  For a roast.  If it were a burrito it would be normal.  Next time I make it I will put a little sprinkle of cayenne but not even close to the cut back amount I used.  But the roast was tender and juicy and fabulous and my husband thought a spicy roast was a great idea so there you go.  Oh, and the salt was perfect.

We LOVE this recipe.  I ususally let the meat marinate in the rub for a few hours prior to cooking.  I have also tried this with eye of round roast and it works great!

This is fabulous. I didn't find it too spicy or salty. (But, I used to live in South Louisiana.) The flavor was great. I am going to invest in an electric knife to make it easier to cut very thin slices as suggested. The flavor was great. Served with roasted Yukon and sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli and cauliflower. Yum. my roast was only a little over 2# so I cooked for just 45 @ 325 and then let it sit for 15 min.

I am not a red meat fan but even I have to admit that this was really good.  Make sure to take note of the kosher salt - if using table salt cut in half!

This was a very good recipe!  I had back luck last time I made a tip sirloin, so I was looking for something with lots of flavor.  This did the trick!  I don't like spicy foods, and this was perfect!  After reading Joel's response about the salt, I did cut the kosher salt in half to only 1/2 tablespoon and it was not too salty.  I also didn't have any cayenne pepper, so I skipped it.  I had a 2lb roast, so I only cooked it for 40 minutes, then turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for another 15 minutes.  It was perfect!  Very flavorful and cooked perfectly! Thanks - I will definitely make this again!  I almost forgot to mention that while it was cooking, my kitchen smelled like a restaurant!  I kept sniffing the oven because it smelled SOOO good!

This had really good flavor!  A little on the salty side and I did 1/2 tablespoon of sea salt.  My roast was a little bigger than 3 lbs so I let it go a little longer than one hour and it was still very rare.  I also added some Rosemary to the rub.  Very delicious!  Next time less salt and cook a hair longer.  Thanks for sharing:)

I made this a few weeks ago and am going to make it again tonight.  This is an awesome recipe!  I had gotten a sirloin tip roast for just over 2.00 on sale one day and looked for a recipe to use with it. This one was loved by all in my family. I didn't even mind paying full price for another roast!  One thing that I did do was to cut the gristle (silver skin) out of the middle before seasoning it.

This was amazing - the spices were perfect, and the pan juices were great.  I'll definitely make this again.  It's company worthy.

VERY good. Even the 3-year-old ate it without complaint. It also made very yummy cold sandwiches when the leftovers were sliced thinly. Will definitely make this again!

This was one of the best roasts that I have had thus far. We did cut down the salt, as we are not that fond of it, but the roast turned out nice, juicy and very flavorful. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. *Update* We have now made this recipe a few times. One change that we have made is to use a sweet paprika and replace chipotle chili powder for the cayenne. It gives it a nice smokey flavor. Yum!

Thank you Joel, this was so easy and delish! I did cut way back on the salt and let the meat sit on the counter for an hour with the rub on it. I threw a few slices of bacon across the top too. The drippings in the pan made the BEST gravy, adding nothing but flour and water and fresh ground pepper...the color was beautiful on top of our mashed potatoes. Hubby and daughter thoroughly enjoyed.

Very delicious recip!.  I cooked a 4 lb. roast, and it took close to 2 hours to hit 142 degrees.  I wish I took it out sooner, it was a little too well for our tastes, but the flavor was still there and we really enjoyed it.  Next time I will take it out at 135 as user ~TNT~ suggested.  This will give me a perfect medium to medium rare roast.  Thank you for sharing!!

I just made this recipe, and it was outstanding! The "heat" from the spices was more understated than hot; gave it sort of a smoky flavor, which was delicious.

I had enough juice in the pan to make gravy; I whisked a couple tablespoons of flour with a little water, then whisked it into the pan juices; brought to a boil and then simmered for a few minutes. My husband raved about the flavor.
Truly a keeper!

Delicious! I couldn't get a sirloin tip, so I used on boneless chuck roast.  Worked out just fine.

Very yummy and easy to make.  Lining the pan was a very good idea.  I only made one change: I don't like really peppery stuff, so I omitted the cayenne pepper and increased the garlic and onion powerder in its place.  Also, it took about 1.5 hours to get the meet to medium-well.

I had a two pound sirloin tip roast that I cooked for one hour to perfection despite the fact that I made a few errors. I made 2/3 of the spice mix as my roast was only two pounds.  I added just a pinch of red pepper flakes because I didn't have cayenne, scaled the salt back to about 1/4 tsp, added 1 tbs of flour and totally forgot the olive oil so I sprayed it with olive oil just before baking. I also massaged the dry spice mixture into the roast and let that sit in the fridge for two hours, took it out one hour before roasting to let it come to room temp. I cooked it on a rack, as another reviewer suggested, with low sodium beef broth under it. I made a roux and added the beef broth for gravy, it was excellent but no one ate it as it distracted from the wonderful flavour of the beef. This roast tasted like a much more expensive cut of beef, total silence as we ate except for the occasional mmmmm. Thank your Joel for sharing your recipe.

I have never been a fan of roasts. My husband picked up an Angus Sirloin Tip Roast and I thought, Dear Lord, what am I going to do with this. I found your recipe and am hooked. I have made it at least once a week. I clean out Sam's club of their SIrloin Tip Roasts everytime I am there. I use your version for pork and made a modified version for Chicken by adding 2 tsp of  poultry seasoning to the mix. Fabulous! Thanks for sharing!

LOVED THIS!  My husband bought a hind quarter of a cow and now we have all sorts of cuts of meat that I don't usually buy.  Allrecipes to the rescue!  And this recipe was fantastic!  After reading the other reviews, I only made two small changes (and another change by accident).  I reduced the salt to 2/3 Tbsp (or 2 Tsps), and I put the roast in a ziplock after coating it with the rub and let it "marinate" for a couple of hours.  The accidental change I made was that I grabbed my smoked paprika out of my spice drawer instead of the regular so I decided to do half and half.  I had my parents over and my whole family raved over the results.  Will definitely make this again!

I just made this for dinner and it was AWESOME!!!!!  When I read the reviews, I did read the few that said it was too salty or too spicy and I am one that does not like a lot of salt nor do I like things "hot" spicy.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it was neither too salty or spicy. When the flavors of all the spices come together it is simply magnificent!!!  For those who do not like "hot" spicy I would suggest simply cutting back on the Cayenne or simply omit it all together.  My husband just LOVED this recipe!  He said the taste was excellent!  I will use this rub on other meats for sure!!!

Wow!  Very easy and great flavor.  Highly recommend! Let the roast come to room temperature, coated it and then put it in the refrigerator for several hours. Finally found something that will give the meat a great flavor and not just the crust!  I piled the potatoes, carrots and celery around the edges and let them bake too and made extra for stew with leftovers.

This is a great recipe. I modified it slightly (cut the oregano and thyme in half because I'm not a big fan and skipped the oil all together). Placed the roast coated with the rub in a ziploc bag in the fridge for about 6 hours. I also cooked my roast on the BBQ. I placed a drip pan with 1/2 inch of water under the middle grill of a 3-burner barbecue. Heated my BBQ to approx. 400°F (200°C) with lid closed. Turned off the middle burner under the drip pan than placed the roast on the grill over the unlit burner and roasted at medium-high heat with lid closed. For medium-rare, cook 20-25 minutes per pound. Then wrap your roast in foil and let it stand 10-15 minutes. DELICIOUS!

We loved this! But it took 2 hours not 1, and I took it out at an internal temp of around 142... it was at 145+ (medium rare) by the time we ate it after I let it rest for about 10 minutes.

super easy and tasty recipe. I'd have liked the rub crusted on a bit, so I'll do that next time.
Flavors were nice. I omitted oregano, as we're opposed to the flavor, but I added a bit more lemon thyme fresh from my garden. I also added 1/4 tbs smoked paprika for a bit of a smokier flavor. 
I'll definitely try this again! Thanks!

I put the rub on several hours ahead and let it sit while the meat continued to thaw.
It was EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!  Tasty and Juicy
Maybe next time I'll add flour to the rub and make gravy.

It did make a nice gravy, but the taste of the spices completely overpowered the flavor of the beef.  If you are a fan of old-fashioned tip roast, eave this recipe out!

This recipe was great! I am not a huge beef person and I even loved it. We like it closer to well done so I cooked it for two hours, but other than that followed the recipe to a T. I will definitely make this again!

This was absolutely WONDERFUL!  I had a 4 lb. sirloin tip roast so I cooked it in a roasting pan for 30 min. longer and it came out perfect.  My husband and son couldn't stop eating it and even my picky daughter had three helpings!  There wasn't much left over.  I added a little beef broth to the roasting pan and made a very flavorful gravy.  This is going to be a regular choice for our Sunday dinner rotation.

I Liked the rub very much. I think the roast needs to be cooked at a lower temp. Next time I will cook at 275 for a longer period of time.

Absolutely phenomenal!!!  I had a sirloin roast that weighed 1.8 lbs.  I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings which calculated everything to half of the original recipe which was for a 1.5 lb roast.  I measured everything out then added a couple of dashes of everything to accommodate for the weight of my roast.  I put it in a small Pyrex dish with vegetables in the oven for 15 minutes at 450 degrees uncovered until it started to look a little brown on the outside.  I then lowered the temperature to about 200 for 35 minutes covered and added a 1/2 cup of water.  I checked the internal temperature with a meat thermometer which displayed about 120 (not cooked).  For the remaining cook time, I adjusted the temperature once more to 300 and continually used the meat thermometer until it was done.  Keeping it covered but out of the oven, I let it sit for approximately 20 minutes.  It was the juiciest and most delicious roast I have ever had.  I like it spicy so I threw in extra cayenne powder.  =)  YUMMY!

This rub is amazing!  It has great flavor & the cayenne pepper gives it a little kick.  I will definitely use it again. I followed the rub recipe exactly, however I cooked the roast in the crockpot on high for 6 hours & it turned out perfectly.

Wonderful!  My husband made ME dinner last night and chose this recipe.  He has never done more than a "spaghetti dinner" with jar sauce, but this came out perfect.  The flavor was great - even my kids loved it.  YUM.  It's a keeper.

The herb rub imparted a very pleasant taste to my eye roast and did a good job of flavorizing the meat furthest from the surface.

GREAT RECIPE!! I made this with free range grass fed beef and it was even better.  A couple things though, like the other reviews said, it was quite salty and "Joel" did say to split it in half if you don't like all the salt. That makes sense. And the amount of cayenne in it makes it just a little spicy so if you're cooking for a family that doesn't like spicy food or you don't, just omit it.

Excellent rub!  I put a little too much cayenne pepper but it still came out great.  We cut down on the spiciness with some left over bleu cheese sauce I made the night before.  I also cut down on the cooking temp to 200 and let it cook all day.  Scrumptious, thanks for sharing.

I made this in the Nesco at 250 F.  The roast had excellent flavor and was very tender.  I will make it again and again.

Ridiculously easy and absolutely delicious! I omitted the cayenne for the sake of my older dinner guests and used one minced garlic clove in lieu of the garlic powder. Also, it didn't mention to do so in the recipe, but I tied the roast so it would cook more evenly.

This was an awesome roast!  I found a Sirloin Tip roast on sale, but I had never used that cut of meat before.  After doing my homework on allrecipes.com, I can across this recipe and went with it.  I followed the recipe to a "t" and it came out perfect!  My family loved it so much they actually asked me what I could make with the leftovers (they do NOT eat leftovers!).  A couple of days later, I cut the remaining roast (approx 1.5 lbs) into 4 chunks and simmered it in a homemade enchilada sauce and then I shredded it and made awesome cheese & beef enchiladas.

I have made this recipe about 4 times so far..I will never use any other rub again! It is soooo good! After making it a couple of times I decided to cut the salt in half because although it was delicious it was a little bit on the salty side. Cutting back the salt did the trick for me!
Loved it on the sirloin tip roast. sooo tender..I will be making this on a pork roast tonight! Thank you for sharing this perfect recipe!

This was delicious! I used about 1/3 the amount of salt in the recipe, and cooked the meat to an internal temperature of 145 degrees for medium rare. I also didn't have garlic and onion powders on hand, so used finely minced onions and garlic in the rub.  Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the first roast I made that was perfect!  I did not find it too salty one bit and it tasted wonderful.  Our guests that evening raved about it!  I let it marinade with the rub for several hours and then cooked it on a low temperature for a longer time. Thanks, Joel- this is a keeper!

I really liked this recipe.But the bake time was longer than what the recipe called for. I finally took my roast out about 20 minutes longer than the recipe indicated,and it was still quite rare for my husbands' liking. I would always get this cut of meat on sale at the store and never know quite what to do with it,other than just bake it...finally I can make something good with those "sale roasts" :)

The rub didn't add any real flavor, and the meat was tough.  I won't use this recipe again, and I won't buy this cut of meat again either.

I consider myself a pretty good cook, but have never been able to master roasts of any kind.  No matter what cut of meat or how I cooked them, they were always tough. I made this for company tonight and all we could say was WOW!  Could hardly quit eating it.  This will now and forever be my only roast recipe.  One thing, though, I'll use a little less salt next time.  Just a personal preference.  Thanks, Joel, for submitting this recipe!

This was FANTASTIC!!!  The meat was flavorful, and it was so easy!!  The meat was a little more rare than I like it, but I just cooked it about 15 minutes longer to solve that problem.  Will certainly be making this again.  Was a DELICIOUS change from the cream of mushroom soup deal.

This is the first time I have felt so strongly about a recipe that I HAD to review it!  I can't even tell you how great this came out.  I followed this recipe almost exactly (I halved the amount of cayenne because I am a lightweight).  My husband couldn't stop talking about how great this marinade was and he wanted to "make sure you can replicate this."

The cooking time was very accurate for a 3 lb roast also - I used a buffalo sirloin tip roast and after 1 hour it was PERFECTLY medium rare (about 130 deg. when I took it out to rest).

All in all, FANTASTIC.  Thank you, Joel!

While I modified this the seasonings to reflect my own personal taste, I enjoyed this recipe.  This is one of the few recipes I followed everything ecxept seasonings to a T.  I served it at my moms on Christmas with the rest of dinner and it was well recepted.  I will be serving it again.

Served this to my family tonight for Christmas Eve dinner. Went to church while it cooked and came home to a wonderfully smelling kitchen. This was delicious. Cooked a little longer so that there was some medium pieces to serve younger diners.

This recipe makes a fantastic roast. I've made this many times exactly as written & it always comes out great. It's very important to let the meat rest after taking it out of the oven because if you cut into it right away all the juices will run out.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I was out of oregano so used Italian seasoning in place.  It was fantastic.  The cook time was perfect and the flavor was out of this world.   Great recipe - we'll make this one again and again!

After 1 hour my cut of meat came out far too rare.  I'm all for rare, but this was RAW.  The rub was waaaay too salty and a bit too spicy for my tastes.  I scraped most of it off, and threw the roast in the microwave for another 15 minutes, and then it came out GOOD!    I will try to make this again, but I will change the rub and leave the roast in the oven longer.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I halved the salt.  I had a 5 and 1/2 lb sirloin tip roast, let it sit at room temp about an hour, and roasted it  at 350.  I pulled it from the oven when the meat thermometer read 130, covered it in foil, let it rest until the temp came up to 140, and sliced it thin.  A perfect medium rare, with a nice crust from the rub.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you!

WONDERFUL rub for apartment dwellers who don't own an outdoor grill or smoker!  
After reading the reviews I made the following recipe changes: Because I like the smokey flavor of grilled meat I used McCormick "Smoked Paprika" I also substituted the black pepper & cayenne pepper with 1 TSP McCormick "Hot Shot" Pepper Blend (use more if you like more heat).  I like garlic but didn't have any fresh on hand so I used 1/2 TSP Sea Salt & 1/2 TSP Garlic Salt.
Trimmed the fat to 1/4 inch and followed one recommendation of rubbing the spice mixture in the meat and marinated in plastic bag for a few hours. Another recommendation I let the meat rest at room temp for 1 hr. Based on previous experience with my oven I cooked the tri tip fat side up at 325 for 1 hr and it came out perfect!  Thank you for sharing this!

The roast was extremely tender - it exceeded our expectations.  Truthfully, however, the rub was extremely salty and spicy.  I was very surprised because it didn't seem like alot of rub for the meat.  Next time, I will probably cut down salt and cayenne by about half of what is listed in recipe.  Otherwise, this was very good.

Made exactly as written.  Wonderful recipe!  I would like to add that you should never make this in a slow cooker.  This is not a braise recipe.  You will just be wasting your money.  I might try this rub on a chuck roast in the future tho...or pork.  Excellent!  Instant read thermometers are a must!

Followed recipe ingredients but used a roasting pan and left out cayenne. Great rub! Added potatoes and carrots. Sat for 30 minutes. Wonderful! Husband asked to make this meal a regular!

Sunday evening dinner and a perfect meal.  Saw a tri tip on sale @ the grocery store and thought a good fit. No paprika on hand so added what we had here @ home. The blend of various species and Olive Oil soaked the house in a blessed rain of great smells.

Let it rest! And rest well. You'll thank yourself.  Once well rested, its flavor literally sings.  A side of homemade mashes potatoes, toss some side veggies, a glass of Cab and you're set.  THIS is a recipe to bank on for decades...

This was absolutely fantastic. I have made it a number of times, with beef and with pork. Incredibly tasty! As an aside, I finally got myself a meat thermometer. This has made a world of difference. Perfect roast every time. If you haven't got one yet, go get it now!

Excellent!  Be sure to use the baking sheet as written.  I used a roasting pan and meat was well done on bottom half and a great medium rare on top half.......this recipe will become a regular recipe in our household!

Delish! After disappointing my family time and again with dried out roasts from the crock pot, I decided to try this one. I didn't use cayenne and I cooked it on a rack like another reviewer did, and it turned out as a juicy, perfect medium rare. My kids loved it. Will definitely become a part of our recipe box.

As I started mixing the spices I realized this is almost identical to a rub I use on tilapia that's a real favorite quite often. If you like this spice profile and like tilapia checkout the blackened tilapia recipe on food network. Much spicier with fish but every bit as good. I had 2.1 lb tri tip roast cooked @350 for 45 min rested about 15 min. It was great

My first attempt at a roast and it was a hit. The cooking time was perfect for our three pound roast. The significant other enjoyed the rub and the edges were very tasty. The drippings were a bit too strong to make anything of. Will make again.

I made this tonight and didn't take note of the kosher salt, so needless to say it was very very salty...this was my mistake not the recipes, but I wanted to point it out so others wouldn't make the same mistake.  It's hard to rate it because of that, but I'm pretty confident it would have been delicious otherwise because when we cut the edges off (the most "salty" parts) the center was delicious.  You need to use a meat thermometer because my roast cooked a little less than 1 hour.

i followed the recipe the roast was moist, tender and delicious.    After the roast reached the suggested internal temperature, I turned off the oven and let it sit for 35-40 minutes before taking it out of the oven.  It was done perfectly.    My guests loved the flavor.

This is fabulous!  Make sure you use a meat thermometer because the timing really depends on the way your oven cooks.  This was even better the next day for cold sandwiches!

I made this with a sirloin pork roast.  It was so delicious, next time though.  I would cook it a little less and use my thermometer a little more. Juicy, great flavor.  I used roasted garlic powder and a half and half mixture of sweet paparika and sharp paparika.

This was the first time I made a sirloin tip roast, it was fantastic! I put 5 fresh garlic cloves under the roast in the pan and an onion sliced in half in the pan as well instead of the garlic powder and onion powder. Also I did not use foil in the botton of the pan, as with the garlic and onion in the pan combined with the drippings from the meat, it made a great gravy!

Absolutely our favorite family meal...

Only thing I changed for us (for me really so I don't bloat up) is I only use 1 tspn of salt.  The other seasonings give it so much flavor you won't miss the salt.  This is a must try!  Easy & delicious!

I was worried it would be tough or too rare. Had a group that would prefer medium-rare. Had a 3.5 lb. Decided to go with 325 degrees. Did a very quick sear on the stovetop - less than a minute. Then covered in the rub. Then I cooked it30 mins per lb. for 1 hr. 45 mins total. Rested 15 mins. and it was perfect for the group and tender too.  Thermometer was unreliable. For a delicious gravy, I made a roux (cooked flour and butter), added 2 cups beef stock, and drippings.  Quite tasty. 4 ratings as I suspect it might be a bit too rare and even a little tough at the higher temp.

I will make this again, however, like other reviewers, I found it to be a bit too salty even using Kosher salt. The drippings then made the gravy too salty as well. I would also add less cayenne unless you really like cayenne. Otherwise it was a great rub.

I thought the rub was good.  But I think an hour is too long.  Ours tasted mostly like pot roast.  Not as tender as I expected.  We didnt even save the leftovers.

Must note the change in the updated recipe! I used this on a small roast (1.5 lb) and cooked it for 30 mins, let sit in tin foil for about 10 mins and was cooked perfectly, med rare. The rub was extremely salty but that is partially my own fault, I like my food salty so I figured I didn't need to adjust the recipe, big mistake! Also, another mistake I made was I used garlic salt as I didn't have any garlic powder, another reason it was so salty. I didn't have any oregano so I used Italian Seasoning (oregano and sage). The only thing I think aside from the salt issue was perhaps the paprika had a little bit too much of a bite for me... I would probably use a little less, maybe 1 tbs. It was very simple to make and could easily be put together to be used on other foods at other times. I was very impressed with the overall strength of the flavors for such a simple recipe, I will definitely use this in the future but, with much less salt. A keeper for sure, thank you!

This herb/spice rub was very good. just the right amount of flavor. However, with a thick roast you don't get enough flavor in each bite. I think I would prefer this rub on thinner sirloin steak. For this reason I made the sauce from the recipes on this site called "sirloin with mushroom sauce". Just a sauteed mushrooms in red wine and beef broth reduction - and added a splash of half and half. I was glad to have this sauce accompany our roast but a steak wouldn't need it. Also I cut back on the cayenne for the kid's sade and cut the salt in half (which was plenty!) because I was using table salt rather than kosher salt. Don't be afraid to be more generous with the two herbs either! I think i close to doubled what was called for.

I'm rating this 4 stars because of the salt. Too much for our taste. However, it was the first time I tried a tri tip. I can't find them in my grocery stores so I bought one at Omaha Steaks. What a great cut of meat. We decided to put a few more in our freezer to take the place of the usual london broil.

I followed this recipe and was disappointed. The roast was tough and dry. The rub does have a nice flavor, but roasted in the oven at 350 degrees until medium rare, turned out a tough piece of meat.

I bought an extra roast because I didn't think one would be enough for the number of people I was feeding and cooked them both on a baking rack over a raised edge cookie sheet for an hour and 15 minutes and then let them rest for 15 minutes before cutting into them.  Everyone raved about how good it smelled and tasted.  Who would've thought that a regular roast could taste this good without making it like a traditional soup/veggie roast?!

The best rub around!  Use half the salt, & double the 1/2 tsp. ingredients.  I use this for London Broil when in a hurry.  Just score both sides & broil for 8-10 min. per side.  The family loves it!

Needed 1 hour and 15 minutes for medium rare.  I also let it come to room temp before putting it in the oven. Used the leftovers for fajitas.

I used this recipe on a 5 pound roast.  I had to cook it longer.  This was a very good dish but all 4 family members agree that the amount of Kosher salt was to much. I gave it a 4 because it was very moist, and delicious the salt will just need to be cut down

Loved this recipes, I used all of the spices listed but used fresh garlic and I marinated overnight very good, But I would recommend using a more fatty meat.

Cooked the meat exactly as directed, I did add vegetables though. I cut up carrots, celery, asparagus, potatoes, onions, mushrooms and garlic and coated them in the herb paste.  I placed the veggies under the roast and added some red wine. I then covered just the veggie portion with foil.  After an hour I removed the roast and put the veggies back in the oven for 15 more minutes.  Yumm.

I have made this multiple times for my family and it has come out perfect everytime.  Suggestion:  Instead of using kosher salt, I used Redmond All Natural Sea Salt (an accident at first, but I make it this way everytime now).  And of course, ALWAYS USE A MEAT THERMOMETER.  My roast always takes longer, but I like it Med Rare.

AWESOME and EASY.  I used 1/2 the salt as other reviews suggested.  Used a 3 lb roast.  Used convection roast for 45 min and let sit for 15 min.  PERFECT!

This was such a delicious dinner and so easy to make. I've prepared this recipe twice now and both times were a hit. I'd recommend putting the rub on the night before. The extra time really helped the overall flavor of the meat.

My husband and I  have made this several times and we love it.  His favorite method is to put the roast in the oven at the lowest temperature so it can slow cook all day. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This recipe was a good start, but I found I had to tweak it for our taste and to tenderize this cut of meat.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular, smoked alder salt instead of kosher (DO NOT USE TABLE SALT!), 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of powder, fresh oregano and thyme instead of dried; omitted the cayenne, and used rosemary & garlic infused olive oil.  Put roast on rack on top of pan, filled bottom of pan with beef broth and red wine.  Roasted at 325 for 36 minutes per pound.  The drippings combined with the broth and wine in the bottom of the pan made a heavenly gravy. Yum.

I didn't use the salt and used fresh, crushed garlic and thyme. I also used a air-tight glass casserole dish to bake it in. It about fell apart when I touched it with the knife! Very flavorful and hard to make enough to have leftovers. =)

VERY seasoned.  Used 1/2 the salt but still was a bit too salty!  Made 3.7# bottom roast (2 parts) and only ate half.

The whole family really liked this recipe!  It was very simple and it made the house smell amazing!  I cooked a 2 lb roast (instead of a 3 lb) at 325 degrees for 45 minutes and it was done to perfection!  Will definately make again!

We had a large church dinner and needed to cook 73 pounds of sirloin tip roast!  We looked to the internet for help and found this recipe.  While we left out the cayenne (not sure everyone would like it) and increased the garlic and onion and decreased the thyme and  oregano, it was fantastic and got rave reviews from the congregation.  We did put the rub on the night before and then let it sit out an hour before cooking.  Thanks for such a great recipe, looking forward to cooking it at home!

My oh my! This is wonderful! I rarely give the 5 star rating but I think that this deserves it! Easy to make- I used a 3 lb sirloin tip and put it in the crock pot. Yummy. No left overs here. Thank you so much for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Wonderful taste!  The rub is more spicy than herbed, but it has a great taste.  My beef tip roast was tough piece of meat, but would buy a better cut and use this rub.  I would definitely make this recipe again.   Thank you for recipe.

This was INCREDIBLE.  I put the roast on a foil grilling pan and put it on the grill on medium for about 1 1/2 hours!  Fabulous!!  My husband compared this to prime rib without the fat.  We did have excellent meat as well....AmericanGrassFedBeef!!!

I used this rub on Salmon and baked it in the oven for 12 min on 425. After that I  glazed the Salmon with a Teriyaki/Soy Sauce blend then baked it for an additional 10 min. Then toped it off with the left over glaze which made it great! My hubby loved the mixture of sweet, salty, and spicy. Wonderful recipe!

I made this last night, and it was fantastic.  I used hot paprika, so I cut back on the cayenne pepper a bit.  The ingredient amounts are perfect, as it allowed coverage of the entire roast.  The drippings were fantastic, and the meat had a nice, spicy kick to it.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I love the flavors of this rub. I didn't have any onion powder so I used mustard powder and I omitted the cayenne cus I didn't have any. This was wonderful. I overcooked it, trying to get medium well and I forgot about it. It was still delicious. Thank you!

There are many reasons I love this recipe - it's easy, you cook it in the oven, lovely presentation and it's really tasty!  I served it for company last night and both kids and adults loved it.  FYI - I rubbed the meat and let it sit in the fridge a few hours just to see if it would taste better.  The flavor was better but the paprika colored the meat a little funny around the edges.

This turned out to be a very tasty roast. Mine took a lot longer to cook. I would recommend taking the meat out of the frig about 1-2 hours before you start to roast it.

This recipe rocks!  I love the seasoning blend! My husband has request this to be a regular in our menu rotation.  I know I will be making this again and again!  I made this recipe exactly as written, the timing was perfect for me, I like a bloody cut of meat.   If I had to feed this to the kids I would leave out the hot pepper.

I don't prepare roasts often, VERY rarely, but I bought a 2 lb. sirloin tip roast on sale and I used this recipe to make it more interesting.  

I didn't have kosher salt or onion powder so I used 1/2 tablespoon of onion salt in place of both.

I put the marinade/rub on the night before and it smelled odd while roasting and looked a bit odd (very dark orangey-brown)and frankly I was a bit worried about the results....but YUMMM!

I roasted right to 145 degrees as the recipe stated, so most of the roast was a medium rare and it was really flavorful and tender.  My husband really enjoyed this also.  

This was a quick, easy, and tasty way to make a sirloin tip roast and I wouldn't hesitate to make it for company.

Very nice recipe.

The rub on this roast is very flavorful.  I cut the kosher salt down to 1/2 teaspoon, which was perfect for us.  I also omitted the cayenne (I actually forgot about it.  I would have added just a dash though.)  My roast took almost twice the amount of time listed (I cooked it to 165) but it was still bloody, so I put it in for another 30 minutes (maybe longer) until it wasn't bloody anymore.  I don't like blood!  Even after the long baking time it was tender (not super tender, but tender enough).  Added lots of baby carrots to the bottom of the pan and poured in 1/4 cup water, and they were delicius.

Excellent, I love this recipe. I cut the salt in half, way too much for my tastes.

With all the raves this recipe has already I still had to write and say how great this rub is. I used it on a Top Sirloin Roast and it turned out fantastic. It was real good the next day in sandwiches too.

This was a great rub.  The only thing I added was some rosemary.  I also cooked my roast at a lower temperature and slow cooked it all day for a great tender roast.

Good Stuff...I wasn't wowed though. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't put quite as much salt as it called for. I am not a big salt fan. The meat came out very tender and it did pack a little punch. My boyfriend said it was like 5 meals in one bite. I will be making this one again. ThanXx!~

This is wonderful recipe.  I do leave out the cayenne and thyme only because I do not care for them.  My family loves this and even my sister who can't cook makes this to perfection.  My husband this is as good of not better than my mother's prime rib dinner for Christmas and that's a compliment!!!

Someone gave me this recipe about ten years ago minus the olive oil as a rub for roasted chicken. You rubbed the mixture on the chicken, stuffed the chicen with diced onion and slow roasted it at 250 degrees for 3-4 hours. I started using the recipe on baked chicken wings cooking them at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or so. I like the addition of the olive oil. It makes it easier to get the rub to adhere to the meat. Tried this on a beef roast last weekend. It was just as good on the beef as it was on the chicken. I agree that there should be a little less salt and it helps to double the recipe. Still a winner!

This was the best recipe for sirloin tip roast! After my family raved about it, I passed it on to a friend at church whose husband believes that roasts are only for the crockpot. Well, her entire family said that it was the best roast they had ever had!  And she is an excellant cook!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!  This one is a winner!

Wow, a definite keeper.. Had no Kosher salt so just used 1/2 tsp. table salt.  Nice and spicy, just the way we like it.  Will be eating this one at least once a month.   Thanks, Joel.

Wow Delish!  I made it in my instant pot, used the saute function to brown first with a little bit of olive oil and then added 1 c. of the broth.  Used the trivet to lift up the roast and cooked it for 75 minutes bc the roast was only partially thawed.  It wasn't fork tender, but I cut it into slices, put it between bread and dipped in the broth.  I was in heaven!!

My husband brought home a sirloin tip roast because it was on sale and I had no idea how to cook it. I tried this recipe and it was delicious. The roast was fairly tender in spite of it being a lean cut. I also cooked it a little on the rare side which I think helped.

This is an excellent Sunday night roast that I paired with mashed potatoes and collards greens w/ bacon & onions. The paste rub is excellent.  May slight variation was on the roasting temperature. I started the cooking at 425 for the first 20 minutes then dropped the temperature to 350 for the remaining time. After the roast came out of the oven, I loosely covered it with foils for 15 minutes before slicing. It was the perfect medium, juicy, tender with a great crust. The combination of the three was outstanding. It was my 1st time ever having collard greens.  If you haven’t tried them, you must, especially with this roast.

I roasted a 2 lb. eye of the round using this method. I did cut back the salt to one teaspoon and kept all the other measurements as written.  350 degree oven for 50 minutes then removed the roast and let sit covered with foil for 15 minutes.  It was perfect, tender, and medium rare!

The roast tasted great but, 1 hour was not enough cooking time!.  I had a sirloin tip that was 2.67 pounds so I thought that 1 hour of roasting would be perfect given that the recipe says one hour for a 3 pound roast.  No way!  It was still very rare after one hour of cooking and 15 minutes of  "sitting".  Also, I would back off on the cayenne pepper if I ever try this "rub" again ...it was a bit too much for my taste. Oh, as another reviewer said, you must cut THIN slices of this roast or it will be very "chewy"!

Wow this was wonderful! I did change the temp to 200 and left it for 4 hours or so ...it was bigger than the recipe called for and I wanted it on the rare side. The seasonings were perfect(I adjusted it up for a 4 1/2). but I added a little beef broth to make a little more juice. Excellent! -Lynn

I rarely comment on recipes, but this one deserves it.  The rub recipe was spectacular.  I had a 5.5 lb. sirloin tip roast; my only modification was using freshly minced garlic rather than garlic powder.  This was the perfect amount to cover the roast.  I did this about 2 hours prior to cooking time and let it sit (tented) in the fridge prior to cooking.  I let the roast sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes prior to placing it in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes; after that time I turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for an additional 15 minutes, removed it and let it rest for another 15 minutes prior to carving.

The roast was extremely rare.  While I like rare meat, not all of my guests do, so it was a bit of a hack job on the roast to get the most-cooked pieces from the exterior edges.  Later carving of the remaining (very rare) section was easy and will make for wonderful sandwiches, but a larger roast needs a whole lot more cooking time than just over an hour.

Again, the rub was phenomenal!  This is definitely a keeper and I will try it again (adjusting cooking times) and I'll give it a shot on a pork roast as well.

I used hot paprika, added 2 Tblsps of fresh ground horseradish and 1 Tblsps of fresh chopped rosemary. I also chopped celery, carrots, sweet potatoes, and cauliflower tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper and placed all in a roasting pan. Took about 90 mins to get to 145°. Worth the wait!! Might slow roast at lower heat next time to get a more tender roast, since we used grass-fed meat.

I did this about 3 weeks ago and it turned out really good. 
Then I tried to sear the next roast, a mistake. Don't do it.
Today I will do this again and the only change I will do is reduce the cayenne just a tad.
This is a great rub!!!

I made this recipe last night, and it came out perfect.  The first time I ever cooked a roast beef that actually came out good.  Usually no one in my family likes roasts, but they loved this. Couldn't believe how tender and perfect it was.  Even my husband finally tasted it and said it was good. Just put the rub on, put it in the over and it was done in one hour.  Perfectly tender and so good, so thank you for sharing, I never gave a review before on a recipe, but thank you so much for this. Couldn't believe what a dry rub does. who knew.

If I could give it more stars I would! I made  the sirloin tip years ago and since then have used this recipe on everything. My son who only eats chicken loves it on wings. My husband uses this recipe on every kind and every cut of meat! 
I would agree that table salt should be cut to 1/2 but this recipe is spectacular. Thank you!

It was good, but the cut of meat was thinner and only 2.25 lbs so it cooked really fast(done in 40 min).

This was excellent!! It turned out perfectly. I cooked it at 450* for the first 10 min and then about 20 min per pound at 350* after that. It was a perfect medium rare. I served it with a creamy horseradish sauce. Yum! My husband said this was the best thing I ever made. Thank you for sharing!! ??

Loved it! I followed the recipe exactly as shown but put it in the Crockpot for 6 hours on low and 1 hour on high like another reviewer suggested. My husband was extremely happy...he even did the dishes for me :)

May family raved about this dish!  Leftovers made a fabulous sandwich.  I cooked it a 450 for 11 minutes than followed the recipe.  A winner for sure

I really liked the flavor of all the spices together. I used less cayenne pepper than it called for because I didn't want it to be too spicy and I added more garlic and onion powder. My roast was just under 3lbs and I had to cook it for an hour and 15 mins to bring it to temp. It was a little tough but still DELISH!   People are giving this a bad rating because the meat came out too tough. Anything sirloin usually is a tougher meat. Don't blame the recipe for that people!  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I made this with a tri-tip (common in CA).  I also used the convection roast setting so I cut the time by 15 minutes and it turned out AMAZING!  The spices were great!

I followed the recipe exactly, even measured which is unusual for me.  The rub was wonderful.  This is the first time I have had success with this type of roast.  Thank you!

This recipe earned my first review!  Not a fan of pork normally, but this was incredible.  Followed recipe exactly (doubled rub because I did two 2 1/2# roasts).  I cooked on raised rack above pan filled with 4 cups of beef broth like previous reviewer suggested.  Cooked at 300 F (convection roast) for a little over an hour.  Removed roasts at 130F and wrapped in foil for 15 minutes.  Made gravy out of broth and drippings.  Incredible.

Great recipe. Next time I'll just eliminate the salt all together.  I think the other spices make up for the deficit.  I loved how juicy this roast was but I LITERALLY had to rinse it before serving.  SALT OVERLOAD.  Kosher salt, table salt, no matter..  TOO SALTY.

The taste was fantastic!  My only suggestion would be to cook it on a lower temp for a longer time because it was a little touch.

I'm sorry but I have to agree with the person who said they felt like the beef had to be washed off.  I love spice and flavor but this was over the top.  Only after I scraped most of the spice-laden crust off did I enjoy the beef again.  I'll use my own recipe next time.

My roast was only 2 lb but it took much longer than an hour to bake. Even after an hour and a half it was pretty rare. The rub was pretty good, though. I just reduced the spice level since my toddlers don't like things spicy.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I admit I used a tenderloin roast and cut it thinly. My husband usually does not like a roast but told me I could make this again. Sent a sandwich with the beef for his lunch and he gobbled the whole thing. After a couple of days there was nothing to throw out. A keeper recipe.

I wish I could give this 10 stars! This is absolutely delicious! I omitted the cayenne, used 1/2 tsp salt and I didn't have oregano so I used italian seasoning instead. I also melted some butter with garlic and injected it into several parts of the roast. It came out extremely moist and tender and my family raved about how I'd "outdone" myself. So good!!!!

Really liked this pork roast.  I was VERY easy which is what I needed this evening.  Next timeI I "might" cut back on the cayenne just a "bit".  My husband almost ALWAYS uses horseradish on pork but didn't this evening.  He liked it just the way it was.  And THAT'S a huge compliment.   Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I used this video to teach my kids (9 and 7 years old) how to cook. The salt was too high but everything else tasted great. The meat was tough. I would recommend something other than Sir Loin Tip roast.

The whole family loved this rub, I did cut the cayenne in half as I knew it would be too spicy for my ten year old.  In the end I made two types of gravy spicy mom and dad gravy and then I whipped up some not spicy gravy for the kids.  I would make this again and again!

Another one of my all-time favorite recipes on Allrecipes.com!!! I use this to cook a large tri-tip. Nothing is simpler when you have guest over. I just season it, put it out on the counter for a couple of hours, pop it in the oven for 55 minutes , wait 20 minutes, slice super thin, and then watch my guests rave about it! It is a no fuss dish - more time to enjoy being with your guests. I always serve this with Cherry-Bomb BBQ chicken! Super combination!

This was absolutely delicious!  I had about a 4 lb roast, and it took about 1hr 45 min and was absolutely perfect.  I left out the cayenne and used dried minced onions (I was out of onion powder) and it was well-seasoned and very tasty.  Really enhanced the flavor of our beef.  Definitely one I'll make again!

Absolutely the BOMB!!!  I made the recipe exactly as is and it was wonderful!  I baked the roast for an hour and it actually came out rare (which I love anyway) so the next time I will probably leave it in a little longer for the more squeamish members of my family (lol).  As for me, it's my new favorite!!!

This turned out to be an awesome dinner with 3 nights of left-overs for my husband and I! It takes forever to cook anything in my oven, so I made this in the crock pot instead to save time. I made the herb rub paste following the recipe, only I used less cayenne pepper because I don’t like spicy food. I marinated the 3 ½ lb. sirloin tip roast overnight in the fridge and in the morning I threw it in the crockpot with some carrots, red potatoes, 2 onions and 1 cup of beef broth and put it on LOW for 8 hours. I came home from work and it smelled delicious. The meat was flavorful and so tender it was falling apart. We didn’t even need a knife to cut it. The only thing I may do differently next time is add some worchestire sauce to either the rub or just pour some in the crock pot because my husband poured a ton of it on his plate. I told my husband if I ever get a new oven I’ll roast it in the oven instead and he said no-it was PERFECT in the crock pot.

Followed the roasting directions as stated. It was so tender I could pull the slices apart with my fingers. Whole family raved over it. I did use fresh garlic and didn't use the cayenne because of the kids. Excellent.

I make this all the time, always to rave reviews.  I made one mistake a few times -- roasting in a dish way too big for the cut. Make sure the cut of meat fits nicely in your dish, and it turns out fantastic every time.  It's even better the next day for two reasons: First, the flavor has had time to sink into the meat.  Second, you can pour the juices over the meat, then reheat it that way. Highly recommended.

Excellent!  Didn't have kosher salt, so just used table salt.  Took the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked it on a rack with some beef broth and bay leaves beneath it.  Added water to the bottom part of the way through.  (Made an excellent gravy, too.)  This was excellent!!!  My husband (who is a light eater) went back THREE times for more.  A bit salty for my taste - so will probably cut back a bit next time.  And there will be a next time!  Probably when company comes over!

Fantastic and easy! I use tri tip, and this recipe has become one of my go-to's for dinner parties - everyone raves about it and gobbles it up! The cooking method is wonderful - follow it exactly and you'll have a perfectly cooked roast.

GREAT RECIPE!!! It did seem salty at first but after a few bites it didn't anymore. I used the same exact ingredients but instead of kosher salt, I just used regular table salt so that may have had something to do with the saltiness, I don't know. 

Cayenne pepper was too expensive so I just used ground red pepper. Oh yeah 1 last thing, I probably trippled the amount of each ingridient used. There's no way I could have only used the amounts listed in the recipe.. 

All in all it turned out great! Can't wait to share with family & friends!

I am usually not a fan of runs as the parts of meat without rub are usually bland. HOWEVER, this rub was fantastically tasty and a little was enough of each bite of meat. My 8 yr old daughter actually mixed the rub and applied it to the meat. This will definitely be one of my go to recipes. Looking forward to trying it on other foods.

NOTE:recipe contributor commented about some people's opinion that it was salty. Hmmmm...I could see that as I don't like salty foods. I heard no complaints frOm my family.

I don't eat meat, but my family does, and I'm always looking for a recipe that I can rely on without tasting.  This sounded good from the start, and it didn't disappoint. I only made minor alterations... I used a garlic salt for the salt, and added about 2 tsps of fresh garlic to the rub, and I let the roast marinate in the fridge for a few hours.  Also, I used parchment paper instead of foil.  My family loved this, and my husband loved that it rendered juice (almost like an au jus), since the middle of the roast didn't have the flavor of the exterior; he simply spooned the juice over the roast on his plate.  At 140 degrees, the roast was a pretty red in the middle and juicy, though I may cook it til 135 next time, as it cooks so much after removed from the oven.

I did a little modification as I used my CONVECTION roast. I had about a 1/2 cup of red wine left so I marinated the meat while I got other items together.
I used white pepper instead of cayenne as that is what I had on hand. Used a garlic rub first. Then then olive oil and herbs. I did not cover it as convection suggestions in the owners manual says not to. So I placed in a shallow pan on a rack. It turned out GREAT. Thanks so much for all the comments it helped me get creative and try the convection roasting. My oven did the calculation for lower temp and I kept the time to  1 1/2 hr for a 3#sirloin tip. Very juicy.

I made this last night and took the advice from other reviewers and lowered the salt to 1 tsp and it tasted delicious.  My roast smelled amazing shortly after I put it in the oven... I did not have any thyme so I left that out and I cooked my 3 lb roast for about an hour and forty minutes.  If you don't like spicy I would lower the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. I covered it for the 1st hour and uncovered the last forty minutes.

I left out the cayenne pepper, and cooked the roast longer at around 300 deg. instead of 350 to prevent shrinkage, until my meat thermometer showed 160 deg. It turned out medium, and was delicious.

SOOO good!  Just BBQed tri-tip in December.  My whole family loved it.  And one of the kids isn't very keen on meat or spice.  I followed the revision advise and halved the table salt and used minced onion as I didn't have onion powder but it turned out great.  Easy and delish!

one word...yum! This made awesome roast beef sandwiches when sliced thin. No need for horseradish sauce for flavor. A little mayo and good to go! Only one change: I used half the salt and that was plenty!!

Having to take over the cooking responsibilities at home, I followed the recipe and created a very moist and juicy roast that everyone loved except the wife, who commented that it was too pink.  Thanks for the guidance, Allrecipes.com, can't wait to create my next dinner.

Followed recipe and cooking times exactly. Most delicious and perfectly cooked (medium-rare all the way thru) I have ever made. . .  I've thrown away my old roast beef recipe. This is my new standby.

This roast had excellent flavor, and i will defiantly recommend it to my friends and co-workers. And i just wanted to add that the temperature and time will be different for each oven. I had to cook mine on 400 (degrees F) for 1 hr and 35 min.

Great recipe. I don't use powdered garlic or powdered onion, so I diced the garlic very finely and added it to the rub, but rather than adding onion to the rub, I simply sliced the onion into half inch thick slices layered the bottom of the baking dish with the onion and placed the roast on top of this when baking. The drippings made a GREAT gravy.

This seasoning was amazing. Although I, too, reduced the salt a little (I don't know if kosher salt is less salty than the sea salt I used), it was so so tasty. I fed it to my 3 year olds and THEY liked it too! I cooked longer, though, because I do not like medium rare meat nor am I comfortable serving it to my family for their safety. It's definitely a keeper!

The most tender sirloin tip roast I've ever cooked. The rub was fabulous if a tad bit salty, even using kosher salt. Next time I'll deglaze the pan with a little beef broth which I think will make a nice sauce. i considered using smoked paprika in the rub and am glad I didn't. It would have overwhelmed the lovely flavor profile of the rub. This is certainly a keeper.

I made roast for the first time using this recipe, however i had a huge roast that was 5 1/2 pounds so i altered the ingredents by adding a little more spices here and there, i also added some water to the bottom of the pan and chopped up some onions, and covered it with tin foil, i altered the cooking time and probly cooked mine for 3 hours, it tasted lovely but just a tad overcooked. Great recipe! my guests were impressed :)

Let roast sit on counter for 40 min. The colder it is, the longer it takes to cook and it becomes dry and tough. I cooked a 2.75 pd roast for 1 hr. It was 150 internal. I removed it and let it rest 10 min. It was so juicy and tender. Used all the seasonings except the thyme. I reduced salt to 1 tsp and used fresh marjoram, sweet basil and oregano. The fresh herbs made a huge difference. Made a gravy with drippings, butter, small amount of salt, water,and red wine. Amazing. Would serve for company.

Very good. I felt it was a bit too salty, so next time I will cut the salt in half, and my family did not care for the spiciness from the cayenne, so I will omit that too. But over all very yummy!

i would have given 5 stars, but i am not a fan or of oregano. i decided to try it anyway but i used too much by mistake ; ) OTHERWISE, this meat was amazing and i will make it again for sure. i added several cloves of smashed garlic to the spice rub. i let the meat marinate in the rub for an hour before i cooked it. my roast was 2lbs. i cooked it at 350 for an hour and 10 mins and it came out medium rare, just how i like it.

We liked this very much but found it a bit too spicy for our tastes so I'd make it again with a bit less heat.  I probably added too much pepper.  We do prefer pot roasts since the meat becomes more tender but this was a nice change.

Flavor was excellent, but at one hour at 350F and 15 resting, STILL left my roast bleeding in the middle. I thought my meat thermometer was broken because it hardly registered at all. Taste was amazing though and so we will try it again.

I have used this rub many times with fabulous results. Searing the roast at a high temperature at the beginning really improves the texture of the meat. I keep asking my family if they're tired of it yet and they keep telling me "No, we love it".

Really great. Used less cayenne, and also added a little horseradish. Also used fresh garlic.

Honestly, this is the best thing I've ever found on the internet. I cut the salt in half and now I'm ruined for all roasts in the future. I shudder to think I went all these years without this recipe.

This turned out perfect!   It will be my new way of preparing roasts from here on out.  I followed the guidance of others and baked it at 325 for 45 minutes.  I then turned off the oven and let is rest for 15 minutes in the oven and 10 minutes out of the oven.  Perfect dinner enjoyed by all!  Thank you.

So good! I have never made a tri tip roast. This recipe was amazing. It really did taste close to prime rib! The only change I made was to cut the cayenne pepper in half. We will be making this again, and probably soon because it was so yummy!

This was really good! I don't like cayenne pepper, so left it out. I also did not follow the cooking directions, rather I followed the suggestion of another cook: 200 degrees, one hour per pound. It was very tasty and the family enjoyed it. I also added mushrooms to the pan towards the end of cooking, then heated them with the sauce on the stove.

Please note that in our experience the 1 hour roasting time is WAY low in order to get it to the 145 degrees.  We have a very expensive Electrolux oven, so we're not talking inferior tools here.  I've made the recipe twice, and both times took 2 hours to get to the temp so plan accordingly.  Good flavorful piece o meat when its all said and done though!

My husband's favorite recipe hands down.  Must use a sirloin tri-tip roast.  No substitutions---this is better than prime rib!

I'm a little confused by this recipe saying that it will please the "entire family" because it was SO spicy we could barely eat it. This is coming from someone who loves spicy fod and puts hot sauce on everything. It was uncomfortably spicy for both my husband and I. On the other hand it cooked beautifully at the given time/temp, next time i would choose another rub. If you have children I would not suggest this one ;)

I Should Have Known, You Can't Cook A Sirloin in  1 Hour and have it be tender. The Rub is good  but not fantastic. I followed everything to a T and It was done perfect but really tough. Also this roast was very marbled. I am getting very frustrated with so called 5 Star recipes.

I've tried several 5 star recipes on this site and have been disappointed EVERY time. Gave this one a shot and had my doubts but simply loved it. Never cared for pot roast but this one comes out more like a tender loin with a little kick to it. Book marked and plan to do this one again and again.

As other mentioned the recipe calls for far too much salt.  I will reduce the salt by 2/3rds for next time.  Overall however the roast comes out perfect, very juicy with just a enough spice.

Very good! We added fresh rosemary instead of thyme and it was delicious! The ingredients for this rub are essentially All Season Salt (minus the rosemary and oregano and garlic). All season salt work wonders on all meat-- from chicken (rotisserie kind) to steak. Great idea and thanks for sharing!

Such an easy recipe and what a fantastic rub!  Lots of flavor and very bold.  The only thing I will do differently is add a touch less salt.

Great taste and easy to make. I use 2 garlic cloves and fresh chopped onion vs. the garlic and onion powders.  To cook the roast, I used the 'High Temperature Eye-of-Round Roast' recipe from this site.  Tender and delicious!

I used a 1.5 lb roast and this was awesome.  Only had to cook about 45 minutes and let sit - turned out medium, medium rare.  I used the drippings as others suggested for gravy, good, but SALTY.  I would suggest to cut back on the salt for sure.  But this turned out very good and yummy!

The roast turned out perfect for our family, not too well done nor too rare. The flavor was excellent, but maybe too salty for some. We loved it. I'm even considering serving this for Christmas, instead of standing rib, with the economy being what it is

We weren't blown away by this recipe - the herb rub was just ok, i guess... i've definitely had better.  And the cooking time was way off for us - I used a 2 1/2 lb roast that was just under 3" thick and when i went to check it at 40 minutes, it was way overdone!

This is the best sirloin tip roast recipe ever.  I saved the juices and  thinly sliced the leftovers and served them heated up on a toasted hoagy with mayo, mustard, provalone, and horseradish.  I dipped the sandwich in the juices.  It was so yummy.  I will be making this again and again!

Very yummy!  My only modifications... I used chili powder in place of cayene (I was out) and added some rosemary.  The drippings made an awesome gravy, just added a little worscestershire sauce.

This was super easy and very good!  I can't get tri-tip roast at my supermarket but my local butcher has it with a nice piece of fat on the bottom, which kept it nice and tender.  Very good flavor.  I'm sold on this cut of beef and will be visiting my butcher more often!

I used this recipe on a roast I sliced for lunch meat. I saved so much money rather than buying pre-packaged a seven pound roast cost me 13 dollars, sliced roast beef from the grocery was 9 per pound.  AND IT WAS SOO GOOD!  After cooking refrigerate overnight, and slice thin,( a decent slicer cost me 40 dollars) wrap 2-3 days of meat in celephane, or wax paper, place in freezer bag, and freeze what you won't use right away.  Better than anything you'll get at the store.  I will never buy sliced lunch meat again! No chemicals, no additives, and you can control the amount of salt you use. The spices are great on pork too.

Wow is all I have to say. We've tried sirloin tip roast many ways, but this recipe was the best! We put it in the crock pot for 6 hours and it was awesome! 6 hours on low was perfect. We had it with loaded au gratin potatoes and breadsticks. Not exactly diet friendly, but was a great treat!

The flavor is very intense and wonderful. I made gravy with the drippings. It was pretty salty, but it went well with the flavor of the beef.

This is absolutely wonderful. When my children (age 8-11) like it, it's a keeper for us. The little bit of spiciness is not enough to turn them off, and the flavors are wonderful. My husband also gave it a thumbs up! I have tried several recipes on this website, and this is the first I have been able to rate a 5!

This rub really adds a lot of flavor to your roast to say nothing of the delicious smell coming from the oven as it bakes.  I use this rub every time I make an eye round roast...I recently had three carpenters and two plumbers at my house when I made it and every one of them commented on how good it smelled in our kitchen...and my husband and kids thought it tasted great!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Will definitely keep some of this rub in a jar off in the corner for future use. Roast was a bit tough still. I will cook it longer by probably a half hour. Never attained the recommended internal temp listed. Wife and Step Dad both gave it a good review.

AMAZING!!! This rub is incredible. Moist is an understatement. Followed the directions as written with spice amounts. I did put the rub on the pork loin the night before and covered with foil and put in the refridgerator over night so, when the hubby got home from work he just popped it in the oven. I don't know if letting the rub sit overnight made a difference but, I do know I am going to do the same next time. The flavors seemed to mingle in the meat. Moist, tender and very tasty. A family favorite for the future....

Very tasty!  I cut the cayenne in half since the kids don't like things too spicy, and there was still a little zip to it.  The salt should definitely be cut in half if using table salt.

This was the first sirloin tip roast I have ever made, and it was spectacular.  Extraordinarily tender, flavorful, and extremely juicy.  The timing of the recipe is correct...I roasted for approximately 55 minutes at 350F, which resulted in an internal temp of approx. 130F.  Letting it rest for 10 minutes, it was a beautiful med/ medium rare.  May even go slightly more rare next time, and possibly incorporate fresh herbs in place of the dry spice rub.  Overall, superb.

This is absolutely WONDERFUL.  I had just over a 5 pound roast so I added on about 10-15 minutes of cooktime and it was perfect.  I will be using this over and over.

Exellent roast and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  I thought the flavour was perfect, definitely not too salty - I used sea salt as opposed to kosher salt and toned down the cayenne a little bit because of the little one and everyone loved it.  The cooking time was pretty much bang on, but I don't cook anything like that without a meat thermometer so I took it out when it read about 145 and let it sit - very tender and cooked perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I omited the salt and only added 1/2 the cayenne pepper.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Overall the spice rub is very good, and it really adds a lot of flavor to the roast!  Thanks, Joel  :)

This is the best rub I've used.  I don't have onion powder so I grate a little onion instead.  I did cut down salt by half b/c I used regular salt and it works out fine.  I also take the drippings and add it to beef broth and corn starch for an awesome gravey.

Very good rub! The cayenne ads a nice kick to the flavor. The roast turned out very moist and flavorful. The olive oil makes the rub stick to the roast and makes it very easy to apply

I didn't think the roast carried much flavor besides the crust. I cut 1-inch marks around the roast and stuck slivers of fresh garlic which did help.

The herbs on this made it amazing! First roast I had ever made, my dad requested it for his birthday.  I left out the cayenne pepper as we don't really care for spicy, and the other spices made it very flavorful. I used table salt and changed the amount as recommended by others.

This herb rub is the BEST.  Wonderful flavor and color. We had a six pound roast.  Doubled recipe except for salt.  Left-over roast made terrific cheese steak sandwiches.  We recommend this seasoning for any cut of meat.  Thanks you for sharing with us.

I've made this twice now, one with the amount of salt the recipe calls for, and one with half the salt, and honestly, its terrific both ways!  First time I've made a roast that I actually was proud of.

I have not been very successful in the past with cooking any type of roast.  They all come out "just okay".  I used this rub on a roast for our New Year's Day meal and it was AWESOME!  Thank you very much for sharing.  I don't think I'll make another roast any other way again.  One note: I used 1/2 TBSP table salt in place of the kosher salt (I didn't have kosher salt handy) and it was just fine.  Thanks again Joel!

I put this on a top sirlion about 1 1/2 inches thick and broiled it. Worked awesomely! A tad too spicy even with half the cayenne. It was great flavor and I will make it again without the cayenne.

The rub created an excellent flavor and the roast was nice and most. Even the leftovers were not dried out. I've had friends over when making this roast and they all loved it and asked me to make this again.

I thought this was fabulous. I had a 7lb roast for Easter... so I doubled the recipe. I used chili powder instead of cayann after reading repeatedly that it was too spicy. I also used fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden, and used table salt instead of Kosher salt, I just cut the amount in 1\2. It was really amazing. Took about 3 hours to cook. Great Rub, I can see how it would be excellent on fish, chicken, pork... almost anything! Thanks!

Not a big hit with my family.  I may have over cooked a bit too.  It was too dry.  The flavor on the outer edges was good but the rest of it was not so hot.

wow ,i picked this recipe because of all the reviews and good ratings . It is true this is a great recipe . My first time cooking a roast in the oven ,I had some company over and was very pleased when everyone complimented the roast and asked for seconds , great flavor as well a nice amount of spice but not overpowerring  ,i didnt have olive oil so i just used canola oil and it turned out great I took some beef broth and water and put it in the bottom of the pan about a half an hour before the roast was done , and it made a great gravy  this ones definatelly a keeper !!!

In a word, FABULOUS!!! Took the advise of another reviewer and cooked it in my crock pot on top of foil balls for 10hrs on low for a 4lb roast. Cut cayenne pepper in half, but may use full amount next time. Meat fell apart and was super moist! Making again this weekend, that's how much we all liked it! Made gravy with drippings which had an awesome kick to it, not your ordinary boring gravy. Made with garlic/sour cream red mashed potatoes and corn. I can't express enough how good this is!! Thanks for the post, it's now a regular in my house!!

I used a 3 lb sirloin tip roast that was tied. I used about 1/2 as less salt and a little less of the other spices + inserted garlic spears. (I tasted the spices after the 15 min sit time) I put the spices on and left them to sit for about an hour. (got the roast close to room temp) I put the roast on a wire rack in a baking pan on the rack 2 ledges up in the oven at 350 degrees. I removed the roast at around 130-135 internal temp. I cooked the veggies after the roast came out. Taters & carrots first till brown, then onion and mushrooms The roast was nice and pink inside. The veggies had similar seasoning and were good. My husband ate...and ate...I asked him if he liked it, he said "yeah". Then...he ate... and ate...and ate until about a lb of the meat and almost a lb of veggies were gone. Then he said he wanted more but he was too full to eat it. (Imagine that!) That's why this recipe gets 5 stars. I'll bump up the spices a little next time. (My husband is a little afraid of salt.)

This recipe was great!  I did add a little twist & made gravy from the pan drippings, with flour & water, onions, garlic & crimini mushrooms, and a little soy sauce.  It blended in well with the other spices that were rubbed into the roast.

I loved the rub- not too salty to me- it was kinda smoky, and had less of the bite that commercial preps have,  I liked it and plan to use it again!   My roast came out tender and yummy!

I've made this rub twice now.  The recipe is simply awesome!  I also use it on beef tenderloin.  I made it for my son and he bragged to my son-in-law.  Now my son-in-law won't use anything else.  He BBQ's alot and uses this rub on many things.  He said it works on almost everything he cooks.  The recipe has now been distributed thoughout my whole family and we all love it.  Thanks for posting it!!

I used this reciped on a 5 lb roast, using the suggested measurements for the 3 lb roast except I reduced the salt to 3/4 TBSP for Thanksgiving dinner. Obviously, the roast needed to cook a bit longer than recommended here but it turned out fantastic.  The recipe was easy to follow.  The roast was medium rare, juicy, tender and flavorful.  My husband and I both think this is better than any steak either of us has ever had.  I have added this recipe to my favorites and will continue to make this for special events/dinners or just for because we want a good steak for less than $20.00 with left overs.

Wow! I'm impressed with myself. This turned out really good. A big "Thank You"  to the reviewer who informed me that this needed to be sliced thin. I had no idea to do that and it really made a big difference. 
I left out the cayenne pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. (Well, I did cook it medium-well, but that's personal preference.) I didn't think it was too salty at all. Anyway, this is going in the recipe box. It's a keeper!

Really good. I didn't have a sirloin tip roast so I baked it at 250 for longer as suggested by others. I let it sit for 10 min (which I never do) & it was so juicy. Will make again with whatever roast I have on hand. My roasts are usually 1 1/2 lb so I just cut everything in half. Wouldn't change a thing either.

Liked the spiciness of the rub. Could cut down a bit on the salt next time. Also will try cooking in the oven rather than in the crock pot just to see if it turns out moister. Think I may have left it in the crockpot a bit too long.

I followed the recipe except I slow cooked at 200 for a little longer (I like red meat medium rare) This was really delicious, my husband said thank you and this is really good at least 4 times before he was done eating. The only thing I'll do different next time is back off on some of the kosher salt. EXCELLENT recipe, will become a staple in our home.

After an hour the center was raw, most of it was pink, and only the crust was cooked and flavorful. I kept it in the oven until it cooked through and it turned out very tough. Will not make it again.

Turned out deliciously!
I used a 6 lb roast, so I doubled the recipe for the rub adding a tsp of dried rosemary, and substituted granulated garlic for the powder.  We applied the rub the night before and sealed the roast in a ziploc.  The flavouring was wonderful and was an absolute hit.  Thanks, Joel

I had a colleague over for dinner who likes to limit her carbs...I made this for the first time and it was a huge hit! It was almost done when she arrived and the wonderful smell of roasted beef with the spices was all over the house. My kids loved it too - definitely a hit. However I did omit the cayenne pepper, since my wife and kids don't appreciate spicy foods the way I do.

I used Eye of round roast since my grocery store didn't have the tip roast, and it turned out excellent! It took alot longer than the recipe stated and I think it's because the cut of meat I used was much thicker. Instead of one hour for 145 degrees, it took about 2. The rub made this meat delicious and my fiance was very pleased! Turns out almost like prime rib but even more flavorful. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and carrots. Yum!

I made this for my hubby and I tonight.  I halved the ingredients for my 1.5 lb. roast and cut back a little more on the salt. Great flavor! I also made gravy with the juice from the meat - delish!  No need to add salt to the gravy, all the spices in the rub gave it a bit of a kick. Can't wait to make sandwiches with the leftovers.

My husband said this was the best dinner I have ever made... the only thing I did different was not putting in any dried thyme, and that's only because I didn't have any on hand.  Oh yeah and I used 1/2 of the amount of salt called for and used table salt. Anyway this rocked!!  It was really spicy, just to let you know.  But great!

This was alright.  I would eat it again, but it certainly isn't one of my favorite roast recipes.  I will say I avoided using cayenne so that my husband and son could enjoy the meal. I wouldn't suggest this recipe if someone asked me for a good one.

I followed the recipe, with the exception of reducing salt to 1/2 Tbs. Results were tender medium rare meat with a bit of heat, but overall taste won "okay" reviews. The inside wasn't very flavorful. Perhaps next time, I'll marinate the roast first, braise the outside, and then rub the spices allowing time for it to permeate the meat.

Love it, love it, love it.  Like others, I cut back on the cayenne (because of my 4-year-old).  The first time I made it, I did not have kosher salt, so I just used less of the table salt.  I now have kosher salt, and it works just fine with the amount in the recipe.  I will use this recipe forever!

This is the best.
I have struggled to make a good sirloin tip roast.  They have always been dry.
I followed the recipe although I substitued tarragon for the oregano and thyme ( a personal preference)  baked until the temp was 142 F  after it sat for 15 minutes it was at 146 F. A lovely medium rare.  Was wonderfully juicy.  My husband loved it.  Will definately make it again.

Very yummy!  I added an extra TBSP of olive oil because I like it and it's healthy oil.  I overcooked mine by mistake and it was still amazing.  It smells fantastic while cooking.  I did add real minced garlic and onion.  Will make it again.

I haven't made a roast in years because it just lacked flavor.  This was a huge success and we'll be using this recipe a lot more now.  I was surprised at how well it stayed on the roast and how great the roast looked when it was done.

This was the first sirloin roast that I've made. It turned out pretty good. Make sure that you use a meat thermometer,to ensure no overcooking. I only used 1/2 tbsp of salt.I also made about 6-7 slits in the meat and stuffed it minced garlic. We love garlic. I also poured some white cooking wine in the pan. Thanks for the good recipe!!!

I used a different cut of meat than recommended and my meat came out really dry. (Cook's error though--I'm not very handy with a meat thermometer.) The rub though is what saved this recipe. It was just the perfect amount of spicy-ness to be delicious

The herb rub smelled really great while I was making it, but my boyfriend and I were a little bit disappointed with the end product. The roast was cooked perfectly, but there was something a little "off" with the flavors. Maybe I'll play around with it and try again!

This is an easy and excellent tasting recipe! I had to cook it a little longer because we like our beef more well done and it was too rare for our taste, but that was fine! We will make this one again and again!

I was looking for a roast marinade/rub recipe that I already had all the ingredients for, and this looked perfect.  And it turned out wonderful!  It has a bit of a kick for me (a wimp!), which made it great, the flavor was wonderful.

I made this for Christmas and found it to be way too salty.  Part of the problem may be that I had a 6 pound roast and perhaps mistakenly assumed that I should double the recipe.  I couldn't taste any of the other spices.  If I make this again I will significantly decrease the amount of kosher salt.  Mine was also done cooking a lot sooner that expected.

I loved this! I have never made medium rare roast beef before, I am definitely going to make it again. I did lower the salt, and next time I would use half as much as a recipe calls for. It was good hot, but especially cold the next day I found the seasoning way too salty.

I am confused by some of the negative reviews, we didn't think the rub was too salty or spicy in relation to the meat, we thought it was a perfect combination and we are not spicy food eaters!  As a leftover, my husband loves this sliced thin and served cold on bread.  I do recommend just using a meat thermometer to check for doneness (140-150 deg.) for medium, as the hour wasn't long enough to reach 145, all ovens are different!

I love this recipe. I have also used it with other roasts like chuck and shoulder and it turned out beautiful. I think the kosher salt is essential for locking the juices in. Thank you for sharing.

This was a wonderful recipe. I used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, and eliminated the onion powder and cayenne. I roasted a 3 lb sirloin tip to 130 degrees as we like it rare. I didn't find it too salty with the full amount of kosher salt. I look forward to sandwiches tomorrow.

This recipe is very good. I think it would be good on any roast or say, pork chops. This is a keeper recipe. Add one beef bouillon cube and a cup of red wine with pan juices. Thicken if you like or save for another use during the week.

Well, I personally thought this was fantastic.  My husband - not so much, but only because he likes his meat way to done.  As a previous person suggested, I cooked the sirloin in the oven for 30 minutes, then I broiled the silrloin for an additional 30 minutes.  To me the meat was well done, but my husband could see "flecks" of pink.  The taste was very good and my kids liked it too.  My husband wont eat this again, but I will find a way to have it another time!  :-)

This rub tasted great, was simple to make since most people would have those spices around the house, and came out great. I used a tri-tip because that was what i had and since i had time i let it all sit in a plastic bag in the refrigerator to marinate for 3 hours ahead of time. I cooked as directed, but broiled the last 10 minutes to give it more crisp on the outside and tenderness on the inside. I served it with the creamy au gratin potatoes from this website and dinner was perfect. Can't wait to make sandwiches with the extra tomorrow and to try this rub on pork or chicken!

Came out super tender.  But oh so salty, and bit spicy hot. I usually sprinkle vinegar over my roasts as a tenderizer.  Let this one sit with marinade for a while before I put it in over.  Very Good.

Delicious!!!  One of the best recipes that I got off of this website.  Even my 12 year old daughter loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and probably wasn't as liberal with the spices as I could have been.  I did let it marinate for 6 hours.  I will definitely make it again, but will try marinating it over night.

I was so happy with this recipe.  My sirloin tip roast ended up tasting like a prime rib.  I couldn't wait for my husband to come home for dinner, I knew he would like it, and he did.  Thank you so much for this easy recipe.  The best thing about it is I had all the ingredients already.

I am in agreement with all of you!  This was excellent.  I used a tri-tip roast and it was tender and so flavorful.  My guy got home after I went to work and tried what I had left out for him.  He called me to say that he would be eating the rest of it by himself!  (Sometimes, he's hard to please.)  This recipe is a keeper and a repeater (often).

Only one word can describe this roast....WOW! We loved this recipe! My only complaint is the cayenne....the gravy and drippings had a bit of a spicy bite to it. I willl reduce the amount by just a bit for the next time. All in all, a fabulous dinner! Thank you for our new family favourite!

rave reviews from the family on this one. I wish that the meat had a bit crisper "crust"- I might cook it at a high temp to start, and then reduce the oven for the last half of cooking

We found this excellent and have made this twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I used fresh herbs and grilled.  Great the first time but out of this world with fresh herbs and grilled.

OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  Juicy and so packed with flavor I thought my mouth had gone on vacation.  We ate it twice for dinner and then finished it up by making sandwiches out of it.  I did cut back to just under have of the cayenne pepper because I have small children with new tastebuds, but it was still fantastic.  My Dad is a beef farmer and asked for the recipe, so he could make it at home.  Will make again soon!

I really enjoyed the taste. I had had some problems with sirloin tip roasts and flavor in the past, but this recipe made that a problem of the past!  Excellent. I followed it to a "t" except for the amount of salt...used less. It was excellent. Thanks for the recipe. I'm anxious to try it on other kinds of meat.

I made this for our New Years day meal. I cooked this in the crock pot and added 1/3 cup of water in the bottom. There was plenty of au jus to make a decent gravy this way. My sirloin tip roast was 4.5# so I doubled the recipe. This came out VERY tender! This was a little hot for me but not for anyone else. The spicy hot was easily solved with a sip of sweet iced tea. Oh, I also marinated this overnight in a ziploc bag.

I rubbed the paste on the meat the night before and placed in the fridge.  In the morning I put the meat in a slow cooker (my best friend) with a tiny bit of water to coat the bottom of the pot. I didn't deviate from the recipe nor did the meat need additional seasonings.

Intensely flavored is an apt description!  I substituted minced garlic for the powder, 1/4 small onion for that powder, 2 tbsp fresh oregano and 2 tbsp fresh thyme.  Put it all in the food processor and it made a great paste.  I would decrease the cayenne for a bit less intensity. Will definitely make again.

I cut the seasonings in half,reduced the salt down to a sprinkle and used a 1lb 1 inch thick sirloin tip steak then broiled it for about ten minutes on each side.  It came out fabulous!  My husband loved it so much I hardly got any myself. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very very good.  My husband raved about it and went on even after dinner was over.  My son who came home "not very hungry" when he saw roast had 3rds!   I followed everything to the tee except I had a larger roast so I cooked it longer but it made the house smell so good.  It was the best roast I've ever made and will definately add it to my recipes.

I've made this twice, first with a tri-tip roast, then with a London broil. Both were delicious. This seasoning I think would compliment most any beef. I like spicy things, but my first go was a little too hot for me. The second time I used half of the cayenne and it was more balanced to me. (granted i use a very high btu cayenne)
The second time I added a rounded 1/4 tsp turmeric that added a nice smooth flavor.
Thanks Joel for this tasty recipe! This has become a regular.

Fantastic. As the author noted in the comments, the recipe calls for a lot of salt. I used about 3/4 TBS and it was perfect in my opinion.

I followed the exact recipe. The key for me was having the roast at room temperature before cooking and pulling it out at 130 and resting for the recommended time. The only change I made was to broil for a few mins at the very end to brown it up a bit more. My family said it was the best roast recipe I had ever made.

I measure generously with the spices. There doesn’t seem to be enough to entirely cover a 2 pound roast unless I do it that way.

Yum!! Prepared with the following exception- used Ground Sage & Hungarian spiced Paprika (didn't have oregano or cayenne) Baked potatoes along side.  Roasted until internal temp was 145 & waited 15 minutes. 85% of my roast was cooked Well Done.  So next time I'll stop roasting at internal temp 135. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe, left out the thyme. I had an 8 lb roast so doubled all ingredients and cooked for 2 hrs 45 min: 1 hr # 350,  1 hr @ 375 and then 400 for the rest to crust it up s bit. Dinner guests were expecting roast but were surprised by the spiciness, as was I. Perfection! And yes! I will make it again.

OMG!  This rub is AMAZING.  Just made it for first time.  Tasted a bit and tears came to my eyes.  I’m in heaven!!! I altered cooking temp/time. Pretty small roast.  Cooked at 450 degrees for 15 min to get nice crust.  Then, without opening oven lowered to 350 degrees and cooked for 20 min.  Resulted in medium cook.  For this small roast, I’ll probably cook at 350 for only 15 min to get it a little less done. But it’s DELICIOUS as it is!!!! Yum!

I think the meat was cooked perfectly.  Moist and tasty.  For our family, I will omit or go lighter on the cayenne.  Very nice - thank you for a lovely Sunday meal.

This was excellent.  It did taste like Prime Rib as someone else said. I wanted an oven cooked tri tip instead of one on the grill. This was a winner.

This is a great recipe!  I made 2 changes - left out the Cayenne pepper (we are not fans) and cooked it to an internal temp of 125 degrees (we like our beef rare).  The roast turned out tender and very flavorful.  The spices weren't over-powering.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a fantastic recipe, the flavors are intense and work perfectly with the roast.  My roast was a little heavier than 3 LBS, - I cooked for 1 HR 15 MIN and it could have gone an additional 10 minutes for that "perfect" medium rare.  Mine was slightly more rare than I anticipated (but absolutely delicious and very tender!)   I upped the 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to almost 1 tsp - but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a big fan of the heat - I am and it may have been a bit much still lol.  Will absolutely make this again!!

Wonderful recipe; like it rare so roasted 55 minutes.   A little less salt, a little more cayan, used bottled garlic (plenty) because we like it garlicky  and made a little extra rub and coated quartered potatoes in it, roasting them beside the beef - very tasty.

This was amazing!!!!  After reading the reviews, I reduced the salt (used Kosher salt) to half what the recipe called for and reduced the cayenne by half.  It was plenty salty and still had quite a bite from the cayenne.  BTW: we both love hot stuff and it still had a nice amount of heat.  I coated the meat with the seasoning mix and let it sit on the counter until I was ready to roast.  Roasted at 350 degrees, set the timer for 60 minutes AND inserted a remote temperature probe.  When it hit 137 degrees, I took it out and let it 'rest' until the probe temp went to 140 before slicing.  (I still had about 8 minutes on the oven timer) It was tender and moist and wonderfull!!

I made this Saturday 3/24/18 and it was fantastic.  Minor change is I started at 500 F for 20 minutes and then lowered to 350 for my desired doneness.  Also agree with others, reduce the salt to 1/2 on the rub and make a double batch of the rub.  I had a 5lb roast it could have used more rub.

I’ve made this a number of times and it’s THE best rub ever! However, like others I cut back on the kosher salt.

LOVE this!!!! It’s my new to go recipe! I made a 5lb sirloin tip and cooked it on convection @ 325’F for one hour and let it rest in the oven for 15 min and then tented with foil and let it rest another 25 min. It came out absolutely perfect! I used the dripping to make a demi-glace and sliced it nice and thin. Everyone loved it!

I used half the salt since I was using table salt. I also doubled the onion and garlic powder. My roast took longer than 1 hour, but it was delicious. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing.

Wow! I love roast beef and if I may say so, have gained a decent reputation of making a variety of cuts taste quite good with an accompanying lumpless (usually) gravy.
Feeling adventurous, I found this rub recipe to try. I did follow recipe closely, only altering the salt amount which after all,  I don’t think needs to be lessened. I began oven temperature at 450•, turning down after about 13 minutes. This roasting time is included with the recipe’s roasting time.
Although not a part of this recipe, I thought 
I’d attempt a gravy. I was quite happy that it too, turned out nicely.
What a delicious meal. Everyone enjoyed it.
Thanks so much for posting.

I have not tried this recipe yet, but plan on doing so this weekend for friends. I'm a traditionalist who generally has roast turkey at both Thanksgiving and Christmas, but this year I decided to do something different. I would also like to say that the tutorial is one of the best I've ever seen. I've never roasted a roast, just thrown it in the crockpot so that I could shred it afterward, I've been scouring the internet for the most foolproof way I could find so as not to ruin the roast, and I think between the recipe and the tutorial, my roast will be a hit this weekend. Thank you so much!

Great way to roast a relatively inexpensive cut of beef. Nice flavor. Made rub just as listed. Would have roasted maybe 10 minutes longer; it was very rare. Wife likes rare, this was a little too rare. Will definitely use again. Thanks for sharing.

This is now my favorite way to fix pork roast!  This rub is wonderful. The only thing I did different - I was short on regular paprika, so I had to use 1/2 TBS of smoked paprika.  I added potatoes & carrots cut up with a little fennel and added to the pan during the last 30 minutes of cooking.  Tented with foil & let rest after taking out of the oven - the flavor of  the rub gave the  vegetables a delicious flavor.

My family and I loved this roast. The meat was juicy and very flavorful with a nice amount of heat to it. This will be my go to recipe for roasts from now on and i look forward to using it again.

I used a 3 lb sirloin tip roast and reduced the amount of seasoning by one third and got good coverage. Made exactly as stated. Yes, the outer seasoning is salty so I suggest you don't lick it all off, alright? However, when you slice it and you have just a small amount of the seasoning on the top edge of your slice, it is absolutely perfectly seasoned.  I would definitely use this as a go to for making a really tasty and tender roast.

I have used this rub multiple times now and have yet to hear a negative comment, in fact every continues to rave about it! I adjust the spice content according to who is eating.
Can be used on literally any cut of meat and I find it best on a rotisserie bbq.. OMG so good!
I read a one star review here where she did not ever try the recipe!! Completely ignorant in my opinion!

Try this recipe and you will be hooked for life!

This was my first time making this so I stuck to the recipe. I enjoyed the flavor but my kid did not. I will definitely try it again but with a little less spiciness (as my kiddo says).

This was very good and easy to make.  There is definitely too much salt.  I cut the salt in half and it was a bit salty, should the recipe have one teaspoon instead of one tablespoon?  I am used to double the salt to pepper in most recipes. 

I think I may try some honey with it next time to get a glaze.

This is not the first time I've made this. But this time I made it with a 5 pound pork tenderloin. Did not change a thing! Cooked it to a perfect 140 degrees temperature. It was seriously the most flavorful and buttery tender meat I've ever had! The entire family loved it with roasted vegetables on the side. Thank you so much for the awesome recipe. I will be making it over and over and over!

Super tasty!  Followed the advice of others and reduced the amount of paprika.  Be careful, if your roast is too thin it will be overlooked, so a meat thermometer would be your friend.  Thx for sharing!

My family loved this rub. I made a couple of adjustments. I rubbed butter all over the meat and inserted garlic thru out the roast. I added a few more spices. My Roast was a 4 1/2 lb and it was not salty at all

This is my go to recipe for sirloin tip.  The rub is so flavourful!  We knock the cayenne down a bit, or sub chipotle in deference to my non spicy kids, and I'll add some fresh chopped rosemary as I love it with beef.  Either way this recipe is a winner!

Perfect amount of spice, this was an amazing rub. I omitted the onion powder simply because I didn't have any on hand, and it was still delicious. I will be using this for all my beef roasts!
Im not sure how anyone can find this rub too spicy… my 18 month old loved it and doesnt love spice soooo……
Dont wash off the rub, that will ruin the deliciousness. Thank you!

Absolutely loved this rub!!! As a variation we chopped up potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic cloves and laid them in the pan surrounding the roast. When adding water to the roasting pan we dissolved 3 beef bullion cubes in 1.5 cups of water as well as adding 1 bay leaf.  The flavours in the roast, veggies and gravy were incredible!

Excellent.  I used a large cast iron skillet to roast in and tossed in some whole mushrooms 40 minutes into the cook time.   I covered the skillet with aluminum foil once done as directed and let the roast and mushrooms rest .  I used 2 cups of organic beef broth added to the drippings for the best gravy ever.  I served this with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  So flavorful - Thanks!

My family loved it!  Made a few changes.  I used 2 tsp of oregano and basil.  I spread the mixture on the meat and let it come to room temp for one hour prior to cooking. I then seared it in my dutch oven.  I then added 2 onions quartered, 3 cloves of garlic smashed, and 1 tbsp of tomato paste.  I mixed in the pan.  Then I added 1 can of beef broth, 1 cup of red wine, 2 bay leaves, and 2 sprigs of thyme before putting it on a rack to cook in the oven. I also I cooked it at 300 until it reached 120 degrees. Then I turned off oven and let it sit until it reached 137-140.  (For 2lbs, it took aprox 1&1/2 hours.)

I use this recipe every time I bake a roast. I have cut the cayenne pepper in half though sometimes and have used a teaspoon to a table spoon of garlic salt instead of salt and garlic powder individually. I like this on an Earthfare roast very good and cooks it medium well so there's still a bit of pink in the middle. My husband likes this as well.

We enjoyed this rub. It was very good and I thought it turned out just perfect not too salty at all (Granted I am like you and really LOVE salt) We had leftovers and used it to make beef hash. The rub seasoned roast make a wonderful change to traditionally bland hash. I will definitely use this again :D Thank you for the welcome addition to my recipe collection.

I've made this multiple times.  Just cut down the salt and cayenne to taste.  Takes my oven more than an hour.

Thank you Joel.  That was an awesome recipe.  My husband, a Bret, said as a connoisseur in beef steak, I have to say this is the best I ever had.  I read other reviewers comments.  So, I replaced TBS for salt with tsp; the rest I adjusted to our liking.. So, thank you Joel. I never cooked beef before.  I had great beginner's luck because of you.

Absolutely awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but as my oven is not dependable it took over 1 hour to get to 145 deg F.  Once it did, I took the advice of someone else on here and shut the oven off and left it for 1/2 half an hour while I did the other veggies and made gravy.  I can't say enough good things about this.  I made gravy with the drippings.  You won't get a lot of gravy but what you do is great!

I have tried this recipe a few times now and every time it has been a HUGE success! I love the "hotter" taste of the paprika and the cayenne playing off the "tamer" taste of the pork. As one of my guests said, "this isn't your mom's roast!" I usually do a 2 pound roast with the rub recipe for 3 pounds (I find adjusting for 2 pound roast doesn't yield enough rub!) Just make sure to adjust cooking time (or better yet, invest in a meat thermometer). I also throw in some potatoes and carrots in the pan... The juices running off the pork as it roasts combined with the rub running off make for some delicious tasting veggies! Haven't tried it on other cuts of meat, nor cooking methods (smoking) but I plan on it and will let you all know the results!

This is a great flavored roast.  I think why people thought it was too salty or spicy had to do with surface area vs the wet rub.  You're responsible to put the appropriate amount of seasoning on a roast.  This recipe showed how to make that rub.  Only put as much on your roast as makes sense/fits.  If you have a 1.5 inch thick round or something, you can't expect a rub to translate from what the recipe is for.  Use less rub if you have smaller meat.

We definitely enjoyed this, though next time I would definitely cut the salt in half.  Only change I made was in the cooking- I seared on all sides in cast iron pan with butter before moving to oven for about 20 minutes until medium rare, about 25 minutes.

Wasn't quite sure how to rate this.  The rub is delicious but I had to cook my 2-1/2 pound roast for 2-/2 hours and it was still tough and chewy!  I don't believe the recipe is at fault but rather the piece of meat itself.  Maybe the meat I bought was from a real old bull or something!  Lol

I made this recipe yesterday. I followed the rub to a T. I rubbed the meat while cool and allowed it to warm to room temp. Instead of the oven I used my combo grill/smoker. I had charcoal and hickory in the fire box and added charcoal set up for indirect heat in the cooking chamber. It ran at 300 deg. Pulled it at an IT of 150. Rested for 15 mins. It was awesome! I made a steak egg n cheese bagel with leftovers this morning. Amazing! Thanks for sharing. I will definitely make this again.

I made the roast today and it was awesome!  So much flavor but not overbearing the meat.  The only thing I adjusted was the cayenne because my son isn't one for spicy food.  I cut the amount in half.  This is a keeper and can't wait to make it again.  Thank you for sharing!

I use Course Kosher Salt! It's Way different than table salt. A little heat to it. I cut out the thyme because I prepared some au ju to dip it in. This will be what I use my sirloin tip roast from now on. I used to use a crockpot and make italian beefs. NO MORE.  I love the pink and tender, juicy slices on Milano bread way better than shredded beef. Yummo, thanks for the recipe!

This Roast smelled fabulous when it was done and it was tasty however I found it quite tough.  I think doing the same rub and using the slow cooker may be a better cooking technique for this cut of beef.

great. I cooked a FROZEN 3 lb eye of round roast from frozen in just less than 2.5 hours. It was great. pulled it out when the thermometer read 130. Perfect.

I placed the roast on carrots and added some water. when the water was evaporated I added some more water and red wine. The juice at the end made great ou jus to go with the beef. Great.

A good roast such as sirloin tip really doesn't need seasoning. Salt before cooking dries out a roast, but I thought I'd give this a try. At 145 degrees this is not the medium rare we prefer, and was somewhat dry. I'm going back to my own method.

OMG!!! Best flavor ever! I've made this several times. The ONLY problem is the salt is a bit heavy..I cut the calling for salt in half after I made it the first time. Have made it several times since following the recipe to a T (minus some salt) and followed TADUSIN's (reviewer below) recommendations for letting it sit to become room temp then turning oven off after an hour for a PERFECT medium rare center. My family begs for this recipe. The combination of these herbs is OUTSTANDING!!! 5 stars!

This was yummy. We did find that it had a spice to it but since it was just my husband and  I - we like spice - we enjoyed it very much.  Would use less cayenne next time though. I added chopped onions and beef stock in the bottom of the pan (added water when it evaporated). We used the liquid and onions in the bottom of pan to make a gravy. The next day we cubed the beef, added: can of corn, chopped carrots, chopped celery, chopped onions, cubed potatoes, and peas. Then put all this in a large pot with the gravy and some added beef stock, let it simmer for several hours. Made a delicious stew!  YUMMYY!!!!

The aroma not long after putting my roast in the oven was maddening!  And the taste was just as good. The jus is delicious as well.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this recipe a couple weeks ago.  The smell while it was cooking was fantastic.  The roast turned out perfect and for the left overs I did a french dip!!!  It was out of this world.  My family really loved it.  I will definitely make this one again and especially for company.  I made it exactly the way the recipe was written.

It was a different take on roast beef: however I prefer traditional pot roast over this recipe. I am glad I tried it though and do not regret it. I possibly used a little too much paprika and did not have thyme to put in and this could have made all the difference in the world.

This recipe is great!  I have tried countless roast beef recipes mostly in the slow cooker and they always turn out flavorless and dry.  This recipe was very tasty and I'm not really a red meat person.  This will be my new go-to.

Excellent!  I did cut down the salt to 1/2 tbsp., but otherwise I made the recipe as is.  I think I could have used a little less salt and it would have been fine.  The roast was a little spicy, but nothing overbearing, at least not to my husband and I.

I have never made a roast like this before and it was amazing! Perfectly cooked and the flavor was so good! I did cut back on the salt as many reviewers said- used half the amount.

Just wanted to say this is a delicious recipe and my family really enjoyed this roast. One thing I did change was I used 1/2 the garlic powder and the other 1/2 fresh minced garlic. I also cut down on the salt quite a bit.

We loved this! Funny though... I thought it was for a pork sirloin tip roast. So, that is what we used. Delicious!! We were out of cayenne so I used Chipotle chile pepper powder. We like spicy so this was perfect for us.

The flavors are indeed intense, but they need to be, since there's a large area of unseasoned meat once you slice it.  I actually followed a different recipe to cook it, but I'm a huge fan of this spice rub and will use it over & over! My boyfriend wouldn't stop gushing over it.

Very good. Made per recipe; only thing I can say, is that if you are not into 'hot', you may want to back off on cutting both the peppers in this recipe in half. I made with Bavarian Potato Dumplings & Buttercup Squash.  I also made a gravy and added water to cut the heat out a little in the 'pepper' department.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I didn't add was the cayenne (didn't have any) I substituted that for red pepper. I also rubbed the roast earlier in the afternoon and let it soak in the fridge for about 3 hours. Amazing!

We love roast beef.  My husband is crazy about heat so I thought the Cayenne would be something he really enjoyed.   Wrong.  We like to taste the roast, not have hot stuff over power the food which the cayenne did.  I won't keep this recipe.  I wonder what I missed because all the reviews seemed so positive?

Really good!  Wouldn't change a thing.  Actually I think this is the first sirloin tip roast I have ever had.  Had no idea how elegant a piece of meat this is.  I think better than prime rib.  Excellent.  Great recipe!!

Made this into a marinade by adding chili sauce or cocktail sauce.   The kosher salt is a must! I cut the salt in half only because of health reasons, but have made it as written and tastes great!  Have used my marinade version on just about every cut of meat, poultry and even on seafood that was then grilled.  Very versatile.  Can't give it a five as felt the recipe either needed to be doubled or the size of the roast to be halved to get a really good, bold flavor.

I think I was expecting more oomph or pizzazz with this recipe. It's good, but I was more pleased with the cooking method than the rub itself.

Overall good technique and good roast. But three stars only because the amount of salt used.  I believe too many cooks under salt food, but the amount called for in this recipe is ridiculous.  I cut the amount in half and the result was still way too salty.  Next time I'm using 1/4 tsp salt.

I left out the paprika & cayenne 'coz my kids can't eat spicy food, and I substituted the onion & garlic with fresh ones (didn't have the powder form). The roast turned out delicious & I used the remaining broth to make the gravy for mashed potatoes. My whole family was delighted with the dish, thanks so much for the recipe!

Okay followed the instructions to the letter and the meat was as tough as a saddle. Sorry but this one didn't work for me. So instead I sliced and microwaved the remainder but still tough as nails. I'm going back to a crock pot unless I can find a recipe for a TENDER sirloin roast.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  My roasting pan may have been too large as there was not much liquid left at the end of 90 minutes.  I simply deglazed the pan with chicken broth and made an awsome broth to serve with mashed potatoes.  I will definetly make this recipe again!

I served this for dinner last night, the comments were this is the best roast I've ever had. We were able to cut it with a fork and it just melted in your mouth. 

I brought the meat up to room temperature before putting on the rub. I added fresh minced garlic and dehydrated minced onion in lieu of onion powder. I poked several holes in the roast before applying the rub, this allows the herbs to penetrate the meat while cooking. I seared it at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes, dropped temp to 325 for  balance of cooking time. After searing I poured about 1 cup of vegetable broth over the roast. I basted it about every 15 minutes for the remainder of the cooking time. I left my meat thermometer at Dad's so I had to wing it. I covered the pan when I added new potatoes, cooked some more, added carrots, cooked some more. Lifted the roast on top of the vegetables and let stand covered in the oven until serving time. It was well done (that's how the guys prefer it) but was very moist. I did cook it in one of those cast iron Kitchen Aid pots like Le Crueset. Not sure if this contributed to the moisture content. Dad found it a little peppery, but didn't complain. Gravy was awesome, I added some more vegetable broth and very cold water mixed with potato starch to make the gravy. Gravy was delicious from all the drippings. When using potato starch, use about half as much as you would if you used flour or corn starch, no lumps, thickens rapidly. Will definitely do it again! Thanks!

This our new staple for pork roasts!  I've used this recipe twice and have loved it both times.  Even though I did use 1T (table) salt, I thought it was still delicious.  I'll half it next time, however.

This is my go to recipe for Sunday roast beef and everyone in my family loves it.  Even my wife, who doesn't care for beef all that much will eat it.  The rub isn't overpowering and the leftover beef is excellent on sandwiches.

I had a roast and wanted to do something different with it. My entire family LOVED this recipe. The only change I made was omitting the cayenne pepper (we aren't fans of much spice), it still tasted wonderful! It was also super simple & easy. Took very little prep time.

This rub is delicious except that is calls for too much salt.  Next time I make the rub I will use 1/2 tbsp. salt instead.

Followed ingredients exactly but put rub on 4 hrs before cooking.  It took 1 hr 45 min for medium well.
It turned out fantastic!  My husband swore it was prime rib. This is a keeper!

Smelled great but Tough as shoe leather.
Sorry to say that but I followed the directions and baked it in the oven but it was too touch to eat. So the next day I put it in the crock pot on high all day and it fell apart which is ok for sandwiches but that's about all.

This a FANTASTIC rub!!  I agree with the viewer who said it's not very "herby" so I added a larger amount of herbs than called for (although, not too much because I wanted to maintain the smokiness of the rub).  I was nervous it would be too spicy so I cut the cayenne in half - big mistake! Use the listed ingredients and I'm thinking it will be perfect!! Definitely a winning recipe with my family.

So good!!! I finally made a roast and it wasn't dry or overcooked! 1 hour was just right. I did do a wet marinade of dijon mustard and red wine and soy sauce for 4 hours prior, then patted dry and added the dry rub and let that sit for the 30 mins at room temperature. A little spicy, but I upped the pepper and spices as I like it that way.

Great mix of herbs and spices.  Definitely something that can be used on other types of meat like chicken.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Since the roast did not produce enough juices to make gravy, I made Simple Beef Flavored Gravy from this site and added to it what juices we did have.

This was a spicy rub that nicely flavoured the roast. My 5-year old rates it as "super yummy" and asked for multiple slices. This is a keeper for my family!

Yum! I didnt have any oregano or olive oil, so I subbed oregano and thyme with italian seasoning and used vegi oil. I also wrapped the roast in bacon, and it turned out amazing. Will definitely make this again and use the rub on other things as well.

This is one of the best roasts I've ever made, and I've made MANY.  The flavor is strong but not overly powerful. Some people find it a little salty so if I'm cooking for them I'll cut back the salt by a teaspoon or so.

FANTASTIC dry rub! I used fresh herbs and included rosemary and sage and it came out beautifully. I actually cooked my roast in a dutch oven so when I took it out of the oven to rest, I added onions, garlic, mushrooms, and flour, cooked that mixture for a bit then added chicken stock and let simmer on the stove top for 5-10 minutes.  Finished the sauce off with some chives and let me tell you, a delicious accompaniment to the roast!

A little to spicey for the kids, even the gravy was spicey.  Not the best roast I have had for sure.

I accidentally used this recipe on a PORK sirloin tip roast, and it was fantastic.  Super leftovers for burritos too!

Spices were a little strong, but that may be because I used a smaller roast.  The flavor was great, and it was cooked to perfection.  I took it out at 140 degrees, and it was medium, juicy, delicious.  Thanks!

Very good on pork roast. A tad bit too much cayenne for my personal taste, but I do not like spicy food. I will make this again FOR SURE!

I've cooked about 6 roasts with this recipe, following the instructions as written.  The roasts have been perfect each time.  Last night we used it on chicken, on foil on the barbecue with indirect heat.  My girls said it was the best chicken they'd ever had!  This morning I made a big batch of this mixture, without the oil and put it in my pantry.  I can't wait to try it on a pork tenderloin.

I used this rub on a top round roast instead of the sirloin tip roast and it was devoured! I was worried the meat would be tough but I followed the directions given here, sliced it thin and yum!

This was ok but nothing really special. It was way more than rare after an hour of cooking so I had to roast it longer to suit my childrens' taste. This caused the vegetables to overcook. I may try again and put the roast in alone, then after it cooks for about 20 minutes put the vegetables in  with it or roast them in a seperate pan alongside.

I've looked at countless recipes on this website and have never commented because usually the dish turned out differently than anticipated or not to my liking. That could have been my fault, but regardless, I HAD to leave a review on this recipe only because it's the best one so far that I have come across that delivers. This was amazing, thank you for posting it! It was the perfect amount of salt for me, I do love my salt though. I used carne asada and made some tacos with it. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again!

You need a tender roast for this like the sirloin ball tip I used.  I used as directed and kept a little of the juice to make au jus.  It took about 1.5 hrs to get to 160 degrees which was about medium, light pink and juicy inside.  My husband loved this and he's not much of a meat eater.  Very tender cut, cut along the grain for beef.  We'll use that paste for other meats too, using Kosher Sea Salt.

This was really great!  My paprika is Hungarian half-sharp which adds just the slightest heat.  Yum.  I also used this on a chuck roast (rubbed, seared in a fry pan and popped into the crock pot) and it was WONDERFUL!

I had a lovely organic, grassfed sirloin tip roast $$$ and wanted to make it perfect for Valentines Day.  I was amazed at how beautiful, succulent and tasty it was.  LOTS o' compliments! I used fresh garlic also and Sea Salt. Yum.  Can't wait to try it on an Elk roast for company next weekend.

I made this a second time leaving the roast in the fridge in the marinade for 8 hours. I also added chipotle seasoning. It was cooked to medium rare by preference. It was aaaamazing! And it was kid-friendly!

Followed directions to the letter and still ended up with a very tough piece of meat.. not sure what I'm doing wrong :/  I love the marinade though! I might try it on a different type of roast and see if I have better results.

I never made a roast like this and I'm glad I tried this one.  It was easy!! My roast wasn't weighed though and that proved important...It must have been bigger then 3lb...It took two doses of rub to cover it.  I took another reviewers advice and put it in a plastic bag and left it to sit and marinate for a few hours.  don't waste your time with a roasting pan and rack. I did and I followed another reviewer and put broth in it under the rack and it just evaporated away to burnt crisp under the roast.  Roast turned out great, tasty and not dry at all.  Took 2 hours longer then I thought, but hey weight is important!  Can't wait to make philly cheese steaks with the leftovers!!

Turned out ok. The taste was fine but not strong enough. It was very tough which I hope was a bad cut of meat. I may try it again with meat from a better butcher and more herbs/spices

The rub was very tasty - following other reviews, I put the roast in a ziploc with the rub, a little extra fresh garlic, and let it sit for about an hour - this was not long enough and next time I will foodsaver the meat with the rub on it to allow it to seep in, let it sit for 3 hours at a minimum and maybe even double the amount of rub to increase the amount of drippings.  The rub flavor was fantastic and worth repeating on other cuts of meat.

I tried this recipe for the first time and thought it turned out fantastic!  I did like another member and put the rub on the roast and let it sit for an hour.  I cooked it in our gas barbeque, first searing it on all sides and then cooking it on indirect heat.  After it was done I let it sit before slicing it and made a terrific gravy with the juices,as well as I added a tin of mushrooms to the gravy.  This is a keeper, will be making it again most likely for when we have company!

WOW! We were looking for that perfect spice that is in our favorite store purchased BBQ sauce...paprika. You found it for us! We didn't even use our sauce after cooking. Thanks Joel.

This is delicious!  My boyfriend complimented it, and he is a verryy picky eater!  I followed the recipe exactly but left out the cayenne pepper because I didn't have any.  I cooked it at 300 for an hour (sirloin a little less than 1 pound) and it was tender and perfect.  Try this recipe, you won't regret it!!!

I am not in general a big beef lover but I even ate the leftovers from this roast.  I followed some of the other suggestions and put the rub on the beef and let it marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours then let it come to room temperature before cooking. Fantastic, I will definitely make this again.

This was just O.K. for me.  Reading the other reviews I had much higher expectations.  The flavor of the rub was good.  Per other reviewers I cooked on low in the crockpot on top of some balls of tin foil and I think I would of been happier if I cooked it in the oven!!

This roast is AWESOME!! I cooked it for about an hour and 15 minutes and I over cooked it. It was still at 140 degrees, but that's over cooked to me. Next time I will cook for 1 hour.

I made this roast in the crockpot (as suggested by a previous reviewer), and it turned out to be part of a simple, delicious meal. I used half the kosher salt, as some previous reviewers recommended. I also started with a frozen roast and placed it atop foil balls in the crockpot so it wouldn't sit in its own juices (fat). I served this with baked potatoes, sliced carrots and green beans. The leftovers will make great roast beef sandwiches with horseradish sauce!

Outstanding! Everyone in my family LOVED it. I used a larger roast (5 lbs) because the smaller roasts tend to get overcooked and dry. Added potatoes around the meat the last hour which was a huge hit. I thought the cayenne pepper was a little overpowering so next time I'm cutting the amount in half. Can't wait to have this again!

I used Kosher salt, but still found the meat to be too salty which spoiled the dish for me.  Also, I used a sirloin tip roast, but it looked nothing like the picture posted.  I *might* make this again, but it's doubtful.  My husband who loves meat would only subject himself to leftovers one night leaving the rest of it for me to eat for lunch and ultimately throw away.  A waste...

Great rub with a little kick.  I made it up in the morning, rubbed my roast with it and sealed it in a zip lock bag until dinner time.  I cooked my roast to be rare and it was fabulous!  I will try this rub on a whole chicken next.

FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely be adding this one into our fall and winter dinner rotation.  I'd be proud to serve it to guests as well.  

I roasted fingerling and baby butterball potatoes alongside the roast and served it with baked acorn squash and corn on the cob.

Excellent Sunday dinner recipe!  I saved the drippings and used coffee to make my gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes and fresh swiss chard for an excellent dinner!  Add a nice red wine and you are ready to serve a great dinner for family or friends!

I used this rub on a rotisery roast for 8 guests and the entire roast disappeared!  I was hesitant to use so much paprika, but it was amazing!  A perfect blend.  Thank you for sharing!  I will be adding this to my favorites!

I'm giving 5 stars for flavor. I personally preferred less salt and pepper, but that varies from person to person. The only thing I will do differently next time will be to try on a different cut of meat, perhaps a rib roast, as the sirloin was a little dry. It was wonderful cubed and put into beef stew though. Thanks.

This turned out perfect!  I made extra of the rub and used it to roast corn on the cob in the oven.  It was terrific!  My family didn't like as much ont he potatoes, but asked me to make the rub again just for corn on the cob.  It is spicy and even my toddler twins loved it.  The roast makes great sandwiches later.

Great recipe, roast is always flavorful and juicy.  I did make a couple of changes, I use fresh minced garlic (we are garlic lovers)instead of powder, dried onions, instead of powder and I omit the cayenne.  I also cut small slits in the roast and insert garlic cloves and braise the meat before rubbing.

I thought this came out very well.  I used London Broil and I didn't have cayenne pepper.  I think it would have been better if I had the cayenne.  Even my picky 7 year old wanted seconds!

Excellent, with a nice kick I might add!!  I made this recipe as called for, also cutting the salt in half per other reviewers and it was perfect.  I didn't have onion powder, so just used some dried onion flakes in its place.  Lots of flavour on this one, thanks!

I have made this roast twice in the past two weeks. Me and my husband absolutely enjoyed this one. I roasted mine for about 2 1/2 hours, i like my meat well down so I let it roast till the internal temp reached 175. I even injected the roast with some melted maragarine before baking to give it a more "juicy" taste.

even though our 2 boys didn't like this, my husband and i did so i'm still giving it 4 stars.  it was easy to make and very flavorful.  i think next time i'll omit the cayenne pepper to make it more kid friendly.  but it's great just the way it is if you aren't trying to appease picky little ones!

I don't know how it's going to taste, but it smells AMAZING!

I just wanted to add something though. I don't like paprika at all, and learned a long time ago that the taste works to substitute dry mustard for the paprika. That's what I've done in this recipe, and it smells great--and I am sure it will taste great as well!

This made a great roast.  I ate it plain and my husband used it to make a BBQ sandwich and we both agreed that it had excellent flavor.  We used the leftovers to make fajitas the next night and it was just as good then.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 the garlic powder and add about a teaspoon of minced garlic also.  We will definately use this recipe again.

This was so easy and wonderfull followed the recipe and it was perfect flavorful and tender...I think the reason other reveiwers said it was bland is because they didnt use kosher salt it creates a crust around the meat and seals in the flavor and juices my meat was almost too salty but we like it that way!! Will make this again and again

delicious!  I loved it.
Some slight modifications were to go to 1T or more of garlic and lower the amount of kosher salt.  Also I found a kobe (like) sirloin tip at sendiks that was phenomonal

I have made this roast three out of the past four Christmas Eves, and it is a hit! The rub/paste seems a bit strong before it is cooked, but after cooking, it just makes the meat melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I used a NY Strip roast this year - same excellent result. This won raves from those who love stronger seasoning and among those who have a more delicate palate. Can't miss! Cook to an internal temp of 125F for a true medium rare center with medium well end pieces.

I tried this recipe and it is definitely a keeper.  I used ingredients as listed (except for the cayenne pepper), and it turned out great - just the right amount of spice for my taste.  I sliced the meat thin and it was tender and very tasty.  I will definitely use this again.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day dinner today using a 5.5 pound prime rib roast.  I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough of the rub to cover the whole roast (doubling the recipe made plenty to cover the roast and thensome).  It came out incredible and got rave reviews!  I'll definetly use this recipe again and again.  Thank you!

Spice blend was very subtle, a little too subtle for our taste, especially with a bland sirloin roast. Also, the cooking time was way off. Will not use again.

I did not have either onion powder or thyme, but this was still the most flavorful roast I have ever made.  I did have a little trouble with the timing, I used an internal Temp probe, my roast was 5 pounds, and at 145 it was still cool inside, very red, I waited until it was 167 and while warm inside it still was very pink. But it did not get tough, and the flavor did seem to permeate not just the outside but the inside too.  Many comments by company. Splendiferious!

Very flavorful (maybe too much for my taste) but a good meal none the less.

So good!  I used a almost 5lb. roast and just upped the ingrediants a tad.  we had company for dinner and it was a huge hit.  It did take much longer than 1 hour, and we like ours Med. rare so I took it out at 130 degrees and let it sit for awhile and it was perfect.
thanks for a great main dish.

This was terrific.  I BBQ'd this indirectly and served with grilled vegetables, to my boss.  She loved it and so did my family.  My daughter thought it was a bit spicy, so next time I will cut down on the ceyenne pepper and up the garlic.  I thought it was so good, I am making it again tonight!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this last night, with a couple changes.  I reduced the paprika to 1 tablespoon, omitted the cayenne pepper, used dried minced onion and garlic instead of garlic powder and onion powder, and increased the onion to 1 teaspoon.  It was excellent, I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  This recipe is great.  I made this for a BBQ for 30 people.  I had a 8 pound sirloin tip roast and there were no left overs.  Even my father-in-law (picky eater) went up for seconds.  After reading the other reviews I did cut the salt in half.  I also rubbed the meat the night before.  Instead of cooking in the oven, I used the grill (indirect grilling).  Will make again soon.

Incredible rub!  I've never written a review with all the recipes I've tried, but this one needed recognition.  Just when you think there isn't a flavor you haven't experienced....I doubt I'll make roast any other way in the future.  Possibly could reduce salt amount, but regardless, best rub I've ever had on a roast by far.  Very particular husband even told friends at work about it.

I cut back slightly on the salt and this was
*very* flavorful.  Was cleaning out the refrigerator the next night and found l/2 each yellow, red, and orange peppers, some diced onion,
and some rice cooked with beef broth.  Diced up the small piece of this roast I had left and fried them all in drippings of some sausage (was making a breakfast casserole at the same time).  Gave it
a few shakes of Worcestershire when it was done and
it was good.  Amazingly, I reheated the bowl of that the next day and they raved about it being even better than the day before.  This is not an
easily pleased group here :-) and getting rave reviews from *leftovers* is unheard of!

This is a great recipe!  I bought a tri tip roast on sale at my local market and had a hard time finding a recipe for it.  I was lucky to find this one.  I did tweak it a little to my taste - I left out the salt and pepper, cut the cayenne in half like other reviewers, substituted 1 tsp of italian seasoning for the oregano and thyme and used 3 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder.  It was delicious!  I can't wait to try it on other cuts of beef.

My husband agrees that this is as fantastic as some of the other reviews say.  The roast was tender, juicy and flavorful.  I didn't change a thing.  This is so easy - just what I need!

I used this recipe for rib eye steaks on the grill.  I read the other reviews, and didn't want a spicy hot flavor, so I used half the paprika and half the cayenne pepper.  I rubbed olive oil on both sides of the steaks, then sprinkled both sides with the blended spices.  I let it set only a half hour before grilling 7 - 8 minutes on high for each side.  They were most tender and delicious!

Wonderful flavor. I've made this using 4# roast cooked on gas grill (indirect heat) for friends (they raved about it!) and in oven, cooked for 1hr 20min let rest and it was a perfect medium rare. Husband told me this is the ONLY rub to use.  Can't wait to try on chicken or pork next time.

The first time I made this I put chili powder in it as I didn't have Cayenne Pepper.  DON'T DO THAT.  IT WAS TERRIBLE.  The second, third, fourth....times I used Cayenne and basically followed the directions except vegetable oil instead of olive oil, and half the salt (I don't have Kosher and I think Koser is courser).  It was and is fantastic.  Its one of the spice packets i'm putting together as Christmas gifts.  Thanks Joel!!!!

Unbelievable! I've always wanted to make a good roast; now I've learned how to make a GREAT one! I followed the advice given earlier: after applying the herb coating, I covered and refrigerated it overnight. Then I placed it in a roasting pan with 2 cups of water, covered & cooked it at 250 degrees for 5 hours. It was nice and dark, and I had a lot of gravy. If you prefer a roast that slices cleanly, though, use a meat thermometer and cut back the cooking time. In any event, this tastes wonderful.

I left out the red pepper. Also, some people have complained it's too salty. I didn't think that was a problem at all.

Thanks, Joel!

I made this last night and it was EXCELLENT.  The rub was wonderful, I wouldn't change a thing.  I might try it in the crockpot with a little water next time so I have something to make gravy from.  I will also try this rub on other meats, it was "the best".  Thanks, Joel.

Used fresh garlic and let marinate in fridge for about 3-4 hours.  Outstanding!  Added about a cup of water to the pan to scrape out the drippings and added a little cornstarch and water to make gravy.  Very, very good.  Will make again!

VERY GOOD RECIPE!  The only thing I would change is the amount of salt.  I would cut it in half.  With all the other flavors you wouldn't miss it.  I made mine in a crock pot and there was plenty of juice.  I added sliced green peppers and onion and served it with provolone cheese and buns like italian beef.  My children even enjoyed it!

Not too bad! This cut of meat is slightly tough, but the flavor of the rub was great! Very tasty! The next day we sliced it very thin and covered it with onions and beef broth, placed foil over the dish and baked again. This went a long way in making it tender. Not quite a "5" for us because of the meat, but close! The rub would be good on a variety of meats - the rub gets "5" stars!

enjoyed!  i adjusted the serving portion and therefore my oven time went off, but with less time in oven it would be perfect.  it seemed it would be too seasoned for my taste as i was preparing, but turns out it was great!

This rub was amazing! My husband (very picky) could not stop talking about how it tastes just like his faviorite steaks at the restaurants! I know I will be making this again real soon.

This recipe is so easy to make  it will have you, your family and your guests asking for more.  The rub is also good for beef patties and really just about any type of beef you can think of.

I used this on a rump roast and kept the meat on the rare side of medium. Excellent and so tender. However, I found the oregano a little overpowering, not on the meat but in the gravy. It mellowed after sitting for a day but that doesn't help for the initial serving so I would cut back on the oregano and maybe use 1/2 to 3/4 of what is called for. All in all an absolutely wonderful meal. Thanks for posting. 9/2/04 Used this on a small pork loin roast substituting rosemary for the oregano. I let it sit for about 3 hrs and it was delicious but would definitely like to have more time to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.

The first time I used this rub I cooked the roast on a rack in the oven....It got rave family reviews. Today we made the rub then cooked the roast in the smoker....so delicious. I  made the rub exactly as noted and have officially added it to my collection. I love using herbs and spices and this one is for sure a keeper.

Followed this recipe on Christmas for a dinner with my family and it certainly does not just take an hour. I am 90 minutes in at 350 and not even sniffing 145 degrees. The roast is 3 lbs like your description- not sure how your super oven did this in an hour.

Used 1/2 teaspoon of salt - salt reduce diet - I have struggled with this type of roast - this saved Christmas Eve dinner - best Sirloin ever - a juicy, medium-rare and total flavour roast -paprika was wonderful

This recipe is perfect! I have tried several times to make an oven roast...it’s usually dried out and not good. This was delicious and my husband who typically only enjoys steaks on the grill loved this!
Thank you for the recipe!!

I followed the recipe, except for the cayenne pepper, because I didn't have any. I cooked it for an hour at 350°.  It was still not cooked, so i left it in for another half hour. I think I will use the rub again, but I will follow my Betty Crocker Cookbook as a guide for weight, temperature and length of time to cook.

Spices were great on this. Use mild paprika not spicy paprika - the point is to get the flavourful aroma of the pepper, not the heat.

My roast was a bit larger so I adjusted the rub recipe accordingly and baked it in a broiling bag along with some onions,  mushrooms and carrots. When I opened the bag the aroma was tantalizing and the au jus tasted incredible! My family of 3 adults finished the entire roast in 1 sitting. This will be a staple for us forever!

This roast was very flavorful. The leftovers were repurposed into a hearty stew that was wonderfully seasoned by the bark from the roast, a little salt and a bay leaf!

I tried this recipe, and served it at a potluck.  it’s delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I’ve make this a lot, and will be doing so tonight.  I decrease the amount of paprika and I add some Inglehoffs creamed horseradish, to give it a kick.  Instead of putting Kosher salt in the mixture, I sprinkle it on top of the meat.  Very good!

I omitted the cayenne and made a mushroom & onion gravy. I sauteed a diced onion and a can of drained mushrooms then used a brown gravy mix (enough for 2 cups). Blended with an immersion blender. It was delicious, but next time, I would only cook it to 140-142. Sliced thinly, it was tender & flavorful. A keeper for sure.

This was a great rub.  I did add chile powder, and it was spicy.  I rubbed it on the meat in the early afternoon and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, not sure it did much but made it easier to come home and cook.  Internal temp to 140 then leave in the oven (turned off) for 10 mins.  Medium rare, some spots a little more rare some a little more medium.  Thanks to the poster!

Absolutely perfect!  Followed directions with no changes and it was perfect.  The only thing I did that was not mentioned was to rub the roast with the mixture and let it come to room temperature before putting it in the oven.  Whole family loved it.

I followed this recipe almost exactly as is and it was perfect. My husband raved about the rub and said he could eat it on everything! I took it out at 135 degrees and it went to 145 after resting. I print very few recipes but this one is a keeper!

We enjoyed this.  Because I used table salt, I cut the amount in half.  I found the salt and other spices were mostly on the outside of the roast.  The inside actually needed salt according to my taste.  Next time I am going to try the slow cooker method suggest by one reviewer.

Delicious flavor! Nice and tender, we and made sandwiches with leftovers. I like it more rare than a usual roast so I shortened the time a bit. Perfect.

Loved the flavor immensely. I followed directions exactly. I used a nice sirloin roast. It was tough. Next time I will tenderize it with a good tenderizer or wrap in foil. I would not recommend this recipe without one of those two things-or maybe both

It's a nice recipe, but I've made it twice and an hour doesn't even get close to how long I needed to cook it.  My roast was 2.78lbs and was only at 120 degrees after an hour. I used an oven thermometer to check my oven before I put it in.

The flavor of this is amazing. I had a roast in 350 oven w/just a salt & pepper rub when I thought to look for a recipe. I found this one, pulled out the roast and applied this mixture. It turned out a little tough, probably from removing it from the oven halfway through, but the flavor was a big hit. Will definitely make this again!

I loved this and so did the parts of my family who like spicier foods. My hubby didn't like the herb on his meat and we had to brush it off after cooking. He did like how it tasted after that. I'll be making this again.

After 70 minutes the meat was pretty raw. I love the simplicity of this recipe and will try it again, will have to adjust the cooking time somehow, but for now 3 stars.

5 STAR. One of my man's favorites. I used about a 3/4 tbs of kosher salt or less. I used about 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper or less. Turned out great. Cooked as specified except I cooked seeking 130 degree temp. Cooked about 40 minutes, then about 5 minutes, and about 5 minutes again. I was seeking 130 but I took the meat out when it was about 140 and that was perfect.

EXCELLENT!!!    I’ll never need to make a roast beef any other way!  I was out of garlic powder so did use some minced garlic.
The sauce is amazing also!  In fact I cheated and used half a can of beef gravy to stretch the juices.......Happy!!
Wouldn’t change a thing except next time I’ll buy an even bigger roast!

This was amazing! It was moist and flavorful. I kept wishing my belly had more room! haha The only change I made, by accident was to add onion powder instead of garlic powder-so I had a lot of onion powder in my 'paste'!

11/28/18. Excellent herb-spice rub - we loved it!  I rarely make beef roasts but this one is a winner - tender, and medium rare.  Mine was only 1.5# but it was perfect. 
I’ll make this again and try a different cut of beef.

Knowing that I don't like foods too spicy, I reduced the paprika to 1 tsp and cayenne to 1/8 tsp. Thank goodness I did this!  If not, it would not have been edible for me. Even with my changes it was still a bit too hot for me. Next time, I will try leaving out the cayenne completely. But once I got over the heat, the rub was very tasty and the meat was tender and juicy.

I liked the recipe.  It was easy and quick to make.  I used a 5 lb roast and would make it again, but would cut back on the cayenne pepper next time.  I liked the flavor but was just a little too much for us.  Otherwise it was very good.  I did not find it salty but also did not make gravy with the drippings.  I browned the roast on all sides before cooking.  Think i would also follow someone's advice on using a bag to cover the roast completely with the coating before roasting.    No picture, sorry.

Delicious! Definitely will make again perfect amount of spice. I will be making the spice mixture to use for meats on the grill in the summer too! Only complaint was it took 2hrs 15 min to reach 145 but it was worth the wait! Thank you for  sharing!

My whole family loved this. I was not  expecting it to be so spicy. I can see why some people wrote negative reviews. It has a kick the can be too much if your are not expecting it, but we loved it! I will be adding this to our regular rotation! Thank you!

This rub is delicious! I seared the 3 lb sirloin on each side in a frying pan before applying the rub. I placed it on a large sheet of foil folding up the sides and adding cut up carrots and  red onion slivers on top of the roast. After sealing the foil up around the roast I put it in a roaster with a lid , baking it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  It was perfect. I made gravy from the drippings for my side of mashed potatoes. Delicious. Will use this recipe again!

This rub includes all the standards and I also cut the salt down since Kosher is more flavorful than table salt. I rubbed it on,  set in a 9x13 baking dish, covered and let it sit for 3 hours in the fridge. 4th our i let it sit out so it came to room temp and roasted at 275 for 1.5 hrs checked temp and maybe did another 2

Excellent.    Cooked it at 250 with a digital thermometer to 115 degrees and let it rest.  Perfect rare and was not tough.  It got a little chewy at the edges.  My husband loved it.

I followed the recipe as stated but used regular salt and reduced reduced to 1.5 tsp.  Let it marinate in the fridge for 2 hours and baked for 1.75 hours.  It turned out medium and was delicious!  Great blend of spices...

Made according to the recipe and it turned out beautifully.  I sliced it super thin and used the sauce for gravy.  As others have mentioned, t was a bit salty.  I'll cut back on the salt in the future but will definitely use this recipe again.  The sauce is amazing.

I had never made a sirloin tip roast before, but I was very happy with how this came out. It IS a bit spicy, but I enjoyed that and so did my family. I am not a salt lover; I almost never add it to foods after cooking, and I did not think it was too salty at all. If I were going to make this again I might trying easing off some of the spicier seasonings, but I might not. Just depends on what you like and are in the mood for. It is definitely a good recipe. My roast was a little over 4 lbs and in my over it definitely took longer than instructed, but it was larger and it was a little on the more well done side than some may prefer.

I wasn't sure what to do with a pork tri tip that they had at the market. This recipe was perfect!! Bursting with flavor!! It was so good we went back and purchased another to do it again. We did it in the pressure cooker.

I was just looking for roasting times and temps for a small Tri tip I had on hand and liked the sound of the spice/herbs and method of this.  I'm really lazy on clean-up and the foil is neat. Turned out absolutely great and I will be using the combination/method again for other cuts and some wild game too. I was careful with the foil and was able to salvage  ample "goody" to make a really nice sauce/gravy--yum !

I followed the directions and only changed a few of the spices.  The roast was 2.7 pounds.  I cooked it the recommended time and temp and it was raw in the center.  Very disappointing.  I had to cook it another 1/2 hour and it is still way to pink for our tastes. I sliced it and will have to reheat/finish cooking on the stove top when we are ready to eat it.   Flavor is pretty good and the meat is moist.

I Made this once on a Sunday. Me and family Loved it so much I made it again on Thursday ! The left over beef sliced thin went into a Stroganoff and was begged for as a snack alone many times.    we also used Baggette and made french dips the following night. 
  I did not have cayenne pepper so I substituted a few Chile's de arbol crushed and a few turns on the pepper grinder using organic black peppercorn. The rub itself is very salty . It's also definitely a bit picante. But they like a little heat and my wife loves salt. I had to scrape the rub off mine before serving. The Kiddo and wife loved it and commented how it reminded them a bit of A-1 . The rub itself was a bit much to me but the meat and flavor it left behind was to die for.  This roast only taking an hour was fantastic. Nice and pink in the middle, nice and tender. I did pre treat my roast with a little bromelain as a tenderizer. I also used a fork to Pierce and allow the enzyme to soak in for 20 min. (Bromelain is found is pineapples) Mine reached internal temp of 178 before I pulled it and let all the juices just flow out as it settled. Made a fantastic auju for the affor mentioned sandwiches. My family just found it's new favorite roast recipe. Just adjust salt to your family taste and use a pepper that your family can tolerate.  Thanks to the recipe poster on this one . Fantastic ! made me look like I really knew what I was doing !! Will be making again and again.

I stuck to the recipe for the most part, but did cut back on kosher salt (as many reviews suggested) & we didn't miss it. It turned out great...especially for my 1st ever roast. I don't eat meat, but my husband & our kids (ages 6&7) loved it.

I grilled a 2 pound roast for 20 minutes each side. The rub was flavorful and the beef was tender and delicious sliced fairly thin. We will definitely make this again!

I never review anything, but...

I should have known better than to think you can make a palatable roast in 1 hour. Absolutely objectively awful. Runied a nice cut of meat, but really, that's on me. 

Avoid! Rub is also unpalatable.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I used tarragon instead of thyme in the rub, as I had the one and not the other. Don't judge me. Any way, it turned out very well. The rub is quite flavorful, and the drippings make an excellent, spicy gravy, as others have noted. Either the time is long or my oven is hot, because after an hour I'd hit 150F or more, so the meat was a bit more done than we prefer. Otherwise, it was a very popular recipe.  Served with roasted cauliflower, salad, and a sturdy red wine.

Followed the recipe and the roast turned out perfectly.  We thought the rub was a little spicy but the flavor of the meat was perfect and it was nice and juicy!  We’ll be having this again!

My family loved it! I didn't make any changes other than putting the rub on while I let the tip roast sit for the recommended hour (suggested by another reviewer) before cooking. My husband is not a fan of "rare/red" meat, so after slicing, I put the juice from the roasting pan in a frying pan and quickly sautéed the "red" out for his portion.

I tend to use very little salt. Following this list gave me a very salty flavor. Good. but salt. When I make it again, I will cut the salt in half.

I have made this several times to the acclaim of my family.
I followed the recipe without tinkering except I used Hungarian half sharp paprika for half of the recipe amount and Hungarian sweet paprika for the rest. ( I really feel that American paprika is just red dust).

Excellent!  We both enjoyed it  The key is definitely slicing as thinly as possible.  Served it with mashed potatoes and gravy made from the pan and home made beef stock.  Was great! Update Jan 13/19 Made again with a 2.2 lb roast at 300 F for one hour - tender and delicious!

I am a beginner at roast and turned out pretty good. It wasn’t as juicy as we would like but not at all dry. I did cut slots on the top of the fat (as recommended in ormther receipts) Before the roast went in the over to prevent shrinking/pulling. Overall I would totally do it again and just a little less time in the oven. I think my roast was a little smaller then the recipe called for.

VERY good but a tad bit salty, even for salt lovers like me.  I will definitely make it again exactly as written except for a bit less salt next time.  The gravy from the pan drippings was awesome, btw.  Definitely a keeper.

Used this recipe for a sirloin tip roast from our side of local beef. It was very good. I would call it spice rubbed vs herb rubbed. Will make again.

I had a pork sirloin and wanted a recipe for it. I found this. I skipped the salt and cayenne pepper and put this in the crock pot for 8 hours on low. Lots of flavor, but I should have made gravy.

Edit: I made this again with the same cut of pork. This time, I followed the recipe and baked it in the oven. The meat was more juicy after the oven.

Excellent but will reduce amount of rub as just a little too spicy for us.

Great flavors.  I added potatoes, carrots and onion.   The roast came out juicy and cooked to perfection. This is going to be one of my go-to dishes.

YUM!  Followed the recipe for the rub and method of cooking.   I have a Thermoworks Dot which is the only way for me to make sure my hubby will have a rare roast.   I removed the roast from the oven at 125-130  and let it rest.   The best  side is a baked potato.   Had to put the leftovers away immediately or otherwise there wouldn't have been any left for another meal.

The flavor of this was pretty good with just a little heat.  I did cut the cayenne in half and reduced the thyme to 1/8th tsp because I'm not a fan.  I threw it in the crock pot with potatoes onions and carrots for about 6 hours.  I was really disappointed in how tough this cut of meat was.  Flavor was good, so next time I will try with something other than a tip roast.

Very good. I loved how it smelled as it was cooking. After reading reviews I only changed the cooking time. I had a 3.11 lb roast . Baked at 325 for 1 hr 20 mins. 140 degrees med rare. 
Can't wait to made it again. Used meat slicer to thinly slice leftovers for sandwiches.

It was absolutely delicious! This is my new go to recipe for dinner guests.
It was much too salty for us, I confess to being a saltaholic but still too salty. 
This is sooooo darned good!!

Turned out perfectly and got rave reviews from my hubby! Make sure you know how much your roast weighs compared to the 3lbs roast this recipe calls for. Mine was only 1.89 lbs so I adjusted the ingredients to just over half of what it called for and the flavour was incredible. Using a meat thermometer is crucial too!

I've had this roast in my freezer since December because I didn't know how to cook it. This recipe turned out awesome! It had a little too much paprika in it for my husband and I but otherwise it was wonderful thank you for such a great recipe!

This is really just a review of the rub as  I cooked to 145F internal  temperature over 300F indirect with soaked mesquite chips to add a smoky flavour.  The rub went down extremely well with my guests and ill be using the recipe again for sure.

This is a keeper for our family. I don't usually write any reviews but I had to with this recipe. It came out so tasty. The paste had just a little heat from the cayenne pepper and it wasn't too salty. I usually don't add a lot of salt to my cooking. I let people add at the table but it was perfect and didn't need anything. 
The only thing was the temp and baking it for 1 hour wasn't enough. I had to add another 20 minutes to bet it to med rare.

This herb mix was phenomenal! I left out the cayenne pepper as there are some sensitive bellies in my home but it still tasted wonderful. I had a little smaller roast then what the recipe called for but I used the same measurements  anyway. Be sure to use a meat thermometer to prevent dryness. I spooned the drippings over the meat when serving and everyone gobbled it up. This could easily be used on steaks, chicken, or chops. Great recipe!

I used the exact amount of spices listed above. I used 3 tbs of olive oil instead of 2 to make coating the meat easier. Cooked it at 350f for one hour in a roasting pan with rack and it was just hitting 135 degrees. Took it out and rented it with foil for 15 minutes. Perfect rare-medium rare. Just the way I like it. Not to salty or spicy.

I really didn't like the crust I found it made the outside of the roast too hard.  The cayenne pepper took over the wonderful tender roast, I could not taste it.
I found it way too HOT IN TASTE

Quite flavourful and just the right amount of zing.  We love it.  We roast the vegetables in with the meat and some water or beef broth.  It all picks up the flavour of the spices and allow you to make a spectacular gravy afterward.  We don't make roast beef without this rub anymore.

I used the original submitter's suggestion to use 1/2 T table salt instead of kosher, and I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 t since I have 2 small children. Otherwise, I made it as written, and it was really good.  (It took 70 minutes to get to 140 degrees.)  I topped it with a sauce I made while the meat rested: I made a roux with the pan drippings and a tablespoon each of flour and butter, then added red/white wine vinegar.  It seemed a little tart, so I added honey until it was just right.

Made exactly as  stated except didn't add cayenne, and there is definitely WAY too much paprika in the rub. It overpowered all the other spices.  If I do this again,  I'll only do a third of what is called for, if that.

First followed recipe exactly no changes! Haha have to laugh my very picky daughter said taste test time and said yuck bringing it to her mouth before she even tasted it,  Then when she put it in her mouth... Turn of events she said hmmm that's good OK I'll eat it! She charges herself up not to like anything and she got a shock this time lol. It was fantastic and a great success in my home this evening. Thank you :)

The comment on salt was spot on. I did reduce the salt by half. Otherwise, this was a very good spice blend. Husband said it had just enough heat. I had a 2 1/2 pound roast so checked the temp at 45 minutes, which was just about perfect. I will be making this again!

I used table salt rather than kosher and followed Joel's recommendation to reduce the salt by half. I thought it could be reduced a bit more (1 tsp rather than 1.5) but my boyfriend loved it as is. We love spicy things so went full on hot paprika and cayenne - it was great!

This rub is my go-to seasoning any time Black Angus sirloin goes on sale. Fantastic! The spices work beautifully together. Use kosher salt. Small adjustment I've made (to accommodate for my family's tastes) is to cut back on the paprika and cayenne pepper and double up on the oregano. (This is only because the paprika I have on hand is super smokey, the cayenne I have is crazy hot and I have lots of beautiful homegrown and dried oregano.) Don't overcook! Make extra  and slice thin for sandwiches. Love this!

First time I made it was for Christmas dinner.  We all loved it as it turned out tender and juicy, not too spicy but with a nice kick to it.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

Didn't change a thing, this was a flavorful and juicy way to prepare a roast, and my dinner guests loved it!  Letting the meat rest for 15-20 minutes is very important, don't skip that step!

Very good flavor, family loved it. I did cut the cayenne pepper in half as I wasnt sure about the amount.  I will definitely make this again and will use the full amount of cayenne.

I reduced the salt as so many reviews suggested. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't quite as tender as I'd hoped, cooked to medium-rare, but it was ok. My husband thought the thyme flavor was too strong so if I make this again I will leave that out or cut back on it.  The finished roast didn't look terribly appetizing... kind of dull... a plain ugly brown lump (like a giant piece of poo). I think pan searing it prior to roasting might fix that.

I made this exactly as posted. It was really good.Even our son who doesn't care for roast that much liked it.  Our only change would be to reduce the cayenne pepper just a little ( for our taste) as it had a bit of a spicy bite. This will be in my repeat dinner file.

Oh my gosh, this was incredible! Followed it exactly and now I want to make it every week!  Took exactly an hour to cook, but a little longer if you want it more well done. I'm surprised by the review saying it was too spicy? I served this to 4 kids under 13 and they loved the flavor.  This is an excellent recipe.

Very good, daughter said it was best roast ever. It really shined the next day when it had a chance to chill all night before slicing the rest. Made great sammies. Sub the cayenne for more pepper and marjoram for oregano but those were just minor adjustments.

Great rub. I made an 8 lb roast for Christmas. After following the recipe and then tasting the rub, it was too spicy for my family's taste.  I halved the original conconction and then added ingredients minus the pepper. I set the temp to 325. It had to cook longer but it was moist and juicy.  Thank you!

Made it exactly as the recipe is stated and it was absolutely delicious.  You have to use kosher salt.  Do not overcook it though!  The timing stated in the recipe is perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly (using Kosher salt - not table salt) and this turned out perfect! My husband absolutely loved how the roast turned out. The ends were medium rare and the middle more rare. Perfect for everyone to have the doneness they prefer. I will definitely use this technique again. Our personal preference on the spices would be slightly different, but that's just personal preference. The cooking technique cannot be beat. Use this recipe to impress!!

I don't have a lot of confidence cooking meat, but this recipe may change that.  It was easy and tasted great.  I've cooked it twice and both times it came out tasting delicious.  The first and last slices are a bit spicy for me but the rest of it suits my taste just fine.

The reviews of spicy was the reason I made this, had no onion powder so chopped up purple onion finely, paprika.. only had hot paprika and garlic powder had none so put in 4 fresh garlic cloves minced.  This was DELICIOUS, followed instructions and turned out PERFECT, yes spicy more so than herby but so tasty. Was a huge hit with the family . Will most certainly go in my favourites

Excellent and easy recipe. I add just a little more of the spice mix. Fat fro the Sirloin tip roast should be mostly removed first. Served with a baked sweet potato this is quick and convenient also.

Was a hit with everyone. Probably needed a bit more than an hour in our oven. I will probably use less salt next time as well, but still a great meal.

This was delicious! I made it as stated except for reducing the cayenne by half for the kids, and also I had no garlic powder, just garlic salt, so I added a teaspoon of garlic salt in place of the regular salt.
The cook time was perfect; roast was perfectly medium rare. I was very happy as it was my first time cooking a roast, taste was fabulous, it was tender and juicy, and everyone loved it!

This recipe was fantastic. Awesome flavor. I followed the recipe as far as the number ofingredients but as I cooked a large 7.5 pound roast, I had to make adjustments in the amounts of each herb and olive oil. Also, after I made the herb paste, I had enough to spead it thickly all around the roast and then I let the roast sit out on the counter for about an hour before placing it into the preheated oven.  As we like our beef on the rear side, I took the roast out of the oven when the internal temperature hit 125°. And I will definitely make this dish again!

Love this recipe for our Sunday roast. This recipe lets you have a nice family roast without completely breaking the budget. I made the rub in the morning, rubbed the roast at around 1:00, let sit in the fridge till about 4:00. Seared and then placed in a preheated oven (200 degrees) and let cook slowly. While it rested I made the gravy and Yorkshire puddings.

I reduced the spices by half for a 1.5 lb. roast and seasoned the roast overnight.   Cooked the next day and everything turned out perfect.  Also, reduced the cayenne pepper to less than 1/8 teaspoon.

Very good flavor.  I had to omit the red pepper and next time will cut down on the paprika because my husband can't handle to spicy.  But followed everything else.  Will definitely make this again.

I liked the herb rub on this but I reduced the salt to our family's preferences. The method left the meat cooked a bit more than we prefer. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent rub, enjoyed by the entire family of 8. Cooked potatoes along side of the roast so they were covered in the rub, very tasty.

Love Love Love this.  I've used it more than once.  I love spicy food and this is just perfect.  For those who didn't like it because it was too spicy?  I'm unsure what else you thought it would be.  Just read the ingredients!  :)  I'm going to try it on a cut of pork tonight.  I've only ever had it on beef.

Great mix of flavor. I did cut the salt in half due to my husband's sodium sensitivity. I will use this mix often.

Turned out great! My husband said he would give it 10 stars if he could. My roast was about 3 1/2 lbs so I cooked it and extra 15 minutes and it turned out perfect!

I made this for some houseguests a week ago. It was amazing. The only complaint (if it can be called that) was it was a little spicy for my wife's palate, but that could easily be fixed by backing off on the cayenne. Even then, she was a huge fan. For me, I see nothing that needs to be changed. I love strong, spicy foods and this is amazing. I intend to keep this one tucked away and used often.

My husband loved this roast!  As some other reviewers suggested, I marinated the roast in the spice mix for 4 hours in the fridge and I only used a teaspoon of table salt for a 2 lb roast.

Maybe it was the cooking times or the fact that I didn't add the cayenne pepper, but I wasn't too happy with the flavor.  The paprika was too overpowering. Plus, my thermometer died and so I was amidst a guessing game on when it was done! I followed the recipe exactly on the time (hoping they were right on) I had a 2.9 ib roast and it was pretty rare by the recipes cooking time probably needed another half hour.  I might try this again, but i'm not sure....

This is a great recipe! The flavor is excellent especially with the kosher salt.  I thought it might be spicy but it isn't at all! My kids even loved it! They fought over the aus ju.  I only had a 1.5 pound roast but made the full recipe for the rub do one could even double this recipe for a three pound roast.

For the sake of time, I just put the oil and the spices directly on the meat, massaged it in and put it in the oven. It needed to cook for 30 minutes longer and it came out perfect!!! Totally delicious and extremely tender. It cut so easily, perfect dinner!

This is by far the best rub I've ever made,  only I made a few modifications:
-Rubbed the kosher salt & stuffed with garlic on 4 sides, wrapped tightly in saran & refrigerated for 8 hrs.
-added 1/2 tsp taragon
-only put in a 1/4 tsp garlic powder. 
-Pan seared the roast (used a bit of red wine to get the spices and fat from the pan then set aside for gravy) then baked at 250 for 1hr. Increased heat to be able to do yorkies and took out at 350 then let rest in a sealed roasting pan.
Turned out perfect medium rare. 
My hubby isn't one for spice so next time I'll cut the cayenne in 1/2 but. Made a flavorful gravy and a delicious roast

I started roasting it at 350 as per recipe, then in 1 hour it seemed very tough, so decreased to 325 for 30 minutes, then 200 for 15 minutes. Had good flavor. Next time will start at 325 then down after an hour to 250 for few hours. It was somewhat tough.

I added a bit more evoo and a minced clove of garlic.  Tenderized it a bit and put it on a rack fat side up. Cooked at 450 degrees uncovered for 15 minutes with meat thermometer in it....then without opening the door turned the heat down to 325 and cooked to an internal temp of 135 degrees F. Then took roast out and covered with tin foil and let sit for 10- 15 minutes .

Wow, this was so good and so easy! I was nervous about making the roast, but this turned out so delicious I will be making again! Even my husband kept commenting "that stuff you put on the outside of the meat is so good!"
I did use a little less salt than called for but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Fabulous! We will be making this again. I roasted this on a rack in our electric roaster along with carrots, potatoes, parsnips, an onion, and a couple cups of bouillon. The only change I made to the rub itself was to cut the cayenne to 1/2 t. The drippings made a wonderful gravy. Thanks!

Thanks for the recipe! My guests loved it. Modifications: 1/2 salt, 1/2 cayenne powder, no onion powder, 2.2lbs meat. 1.5 hours of roasting yielded a medium finish.

I cooked it as directed, it came out extremely rare @145 degree's and very tough...so really not sure what to do with it.  The flavor of the seasoning was good though.

I followed the recipe. The only change I made was to marinade the meat with the rub for a few hours as recommended by another reviewer. I adjusted the temperature to cook it a few minutes longer so it was medium instead of medium rare. It was amazing. I will be making it again.

I followed this recipe as described, and adjusted the salt as per other fellow commenters suggested.  I had two medium roasts & split the rub between both, which was ample seasoning for me.  Great flavour, nice colour out of the oven, and 1 hour at 350 degrees was just right.  Used the juices to make a robust gravy that everyone loved.  Worth trying if you are looking for something a little different.  I will make this again :)

The roast was tender and juicy and the flavor was very good.  I LOVE salt and tend to over-salt most food but when I make this again I will cut the salt in half or omit it altogether.

I followed this recipe with a four pound sirloin tip roast.  I cooked in a roasting pan adding cut potatoes and cut carrots to surround the roast.  The meat was tender and delicious. I served with knorr's béarnaise sauce. 

Next time I will cut the potatoes and carrots in quarters instead in thirds because the veggies were a bit undercooked at the time the roast hit 140 degrees. I added a bit of sherry to the roasting pan before cooking so the pan would not burn and to add flavor to the cooking juices. 

I am glad I served with béarnaise sauce because the roast did not make hardly any of its own sauce.  Next time I would buy two packets of béarnaise sauce rather than one.

This is my first sirloin tip roast and I'm very excited at how well it turned out.   I followed the recipe except that I did not have any cayenne.  I was surprised at how pink it was but that did not really bother me. I will definitely do this again and look forward to trying the seasonings on other meat as well.

This was great. I basically followed the recipe with the exception of the thyme which I thought I had but couldn't find and was too lazy to go to the store and get some. It turned out very good nonetheless. I also didn't follow the cooking time as I have just aquired a probe type cooking monitor and just went by the internal temperature of 140 degrees and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes which brought the temperature up to about 150. Perfectly cooked and moist. The rub brought just the right amount of WOW to meat. The lean pork of today is just too flavorless and bland. This recipe was the best, even my wife thought it was excellent and she usually just picks at my cooking attempts. She had seconds.

Excellent. I made this for a group of friends for our game night. No leftovers. I substituted the paprika with smoked paprika to give it a smokier flavor and added just a 1/2 teaspoon more cayenne pepper.

This was OK, but not 4 or 5 stars.  If you watch the roast and don't over cook it this is a workable base recipe to play with and add to.

Had a 3lb roast and your seasoning worked out perfectly. Cooked it in my smoker at like 235F until it reached 145F and thought it turned out great.

We prepared this tonight, great recipe! Used an electric thermometer that tracked the internal temp, with a timer that went off at 145 degrees, rested 15 minutes. Beautifully medium rare. We will be having this again.

I thought it was terrific! I love trying new rubs and this one did not disappoint. I did use smoked paprika because I love the smokiness it imparts to the dish. Noticed some people commented that the recipe was too hot but I did not find this to be the case. I actually doubled the garlic and onion powder but I love garlic and it did not change the taste significantly. I actually used the rub on Pork Ribs and they were awesome. Oh by the way I had the oven temp at 250 and cooked it for like 6 hrs!

I tried it and the family loved it. I think the next time I will use a little less thyme and salt. I used a half a tablespoon and it was a little salty for my taste, even though everybody else liked it the way it was. I can't wait to try on pork or even on some ribs. I won't use thyme, I will use sage in stead.

Just tried this recipe tonight.  Reading the reviews, I halved the salt and the pepper.  I left out the cayenne.  I wish I did the recipe as described, even so this was excellent and the 8 people we had for a dinner party raved about this.   This is certainly a keeper and will do as you suggest the next time. 5 star

Thanks

Love this rub.  Makes a perfect roast every single time.  I lighten the amount of paprika and cayenne this recipe calls for and I omit the onion powder, simply because it's not a spice I typically use.  It's so flavourful!

really good but the rub is so salty it takes away from it.  It even worked for a frozen roast.  will make it again with the less salt.

Delicious!  My first time making a roast other than a brisket, it was very easy, very juicy and tender.   I added about 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika to the blend which always adds a delicious flavor to any meat dish.  I also used a meat thermometer to gauge doneness and made sure to let it rest, loosely covered,  for 15 min. so as not to loose all those yummy juices.

Had a 2.3 pound roast, and I did not have enough rub to go around. But the meat was flavorful. Will try again.

I wanted to lower the rating due to the *over-salted* result, but we liked  the flavor so much, that I could not do it, lol. I will adjust the salt even more as I already only used 50% of the recommended amount. I also will omit the cayenne  next time  or maybe I will just add a pinch.
I cooked the roast in my . NewWave  oven and it was fabulous, never had such moist pork in my long life. 
I already made enough rub for 5 more roasts, will prepare more to give away as gifts.
Thanks for a most wonderful  recipe!

Super good and the roast was on sale for $5.98/pd!  I wish I had cooked it longer, though.  Maybe 5-10 degrees higher for some medium slices.

This was awesome. Yes, the rub had lots of flavor. Very bold. I will definitely be making this again.

We love this but we don't like hot and spicy so we halved the paprika, and omitted the cayenne pepper. We also added a little more olive oil. The  meat was tender, flavorful and juicy.

It was perfect.  Going to use this again on other items as well as a rub.  I've used it on pork and beef roasts.  My daughter doesn't like pork and she ate this one!  This is great rub which can be tweaked for your family's taste.

5/5 totally made this tonight and it's totally our new pork roast recipe.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika and didn't add salt and it was amazing :)  followed cooking instructions as stated and came out perfect.

Genuinely one of my favorite recipes I've made to date. I rarely, if ever, get pork juicy and tender enough. It's always dry, dry, dead. This was not. I had slightly larger cuts of meat so I needed to cook mine a bit longer and I will cut down on the salt next time, as well. We aren't big on salt, so we don't need much and this recipe was a teensy bit more than we like. Otherwise, my 5 children devoured it. I made two because we are a large family that loves leftovers, but tonight when I make it again (per request!) I will make three.

It was excellent, a little spicy. I made a nice spicy gravy to a long with it. Delicious, next time I will cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp, and maybe slice some onions to cook along with it, just because I love them.

My first time making a Sirloin Tip Roast (2 lbs). The only thing I didn't have was onion powder, and I stuffed the meat with a few cloves of garlic. It came out very delicious. My husband kept raving that the meal was "better than Lawrys" and how we should eat at home more often! I served it with scalloped potatoes and broccoli. My teenage daughter cleared her plate! Wonderful. Thank you for posting this.

Cut the salt in half EVEN IF you're using coarse salt!

Also, the recipe is definitely not an "herb" spice mix but more of a spicy mix. 

I did mine in my Big Green Egg smoker on a lower temp (300F) and longer time (2-1/2 hours) and it came out very juicy. Smoker adds a lot of nice flavor.

This is a delicious recipe!  I bought a 6.7 lb top sirloin roast from Costco and doubled the spice blend. I also did not have any garlic powder or onion powder so I just used 5-6 garlic cloves that I put through a garlic press as a substitute.  The drippings also made a yummy gravy.

Just cooked this , this afternoon.  Very tasty!  I was a little leary of only cooking it to 145 degrees, but it came out so incredibly juicy and mouth-watering.  Spices were spot on!!!  I did add some bacon slices to the top of the roast since there wasn't very much fat on it and it added a wonderful new dimension!

I have made this spice rub so so so many times.  I have made it for friends and family as gifts.  They have used it to make chicken wings, spice up potato salad, rubbed over baked potatoes.... it is just a great herb rub.  I brought it on a fishing trip, and we used it on tuna. I usually use a little less cayenne and probably have a pretty heavy hand with the paprika, but that is about it.  Great universal rub.

This roast is great. I don't like spicy food so I skip the cayenne. I also add minced garlic instead of the powder, and mince onions instead of using onion powder as well. I like to make extra of the rub and put it on some potatoes and veggies and roast it all in the oven together. So easy and delicious!

Great flavor; not too spicy, even with the cayenne. I followed the advice of other posters and put the roast on a rack over a cup of beef broth and a few bay leaves - the broth was amazing! I'll definitely be making this many more times.

Everyone in the family loves this recipe. Our daughter created spice jars of the rub as gifts.  Spicy but not overly so.  Use the serving size option for larger or smaller roasts. Thanks!

Delicious and perfect. My crew doesn't like rare meat so after slicing, I browned some of the individual slices in the oven. Definitely making again.

Quick, easy and tasty!  I didn't have time to let the spices mix for 15 minutes and it still turned out great. Meat was tender. Also was good when reheated. I don't really like hot spicy but this was just right.  I liked that there was not a whole lot of clean up with this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  When it first came out of the oven, I thought it may be a tad salty and spicy but after it had set out a bit and then cut, it was great.  Our kids loved it and we had some leftover and were able to make steak tacos which were great too.

I wanted to find a good recipe for a sirloin tip roast since it was on sale.  The flavors are good in this recipe, but this cut of meat is just too chewy and has inedible parts running through it.  I made it 2 times with the same result. Good recipe...not a great cut of meat though.

Delicious and super easy!  I reduced the amount of salt to 1-1/2 teaspoons as recommended by other reviewers.  I also reduced the paprika by half as well, only because I'm 
not crazy about it.  I used a Pork Sirloin Tip Roast.   It was done in exactly one hour.

My mother in law found this recipe first, she made it exactly as it said too, except cut cayenne to 1/4tsp and we always use Hungarian paprika it is not spicy(unless you buy the spicy kind) or bitter like most paprika can be. 2nd time we made it we put full amount of cayenne, third time we made it, we followed the recipe exactly every time we have made it the roast always comes out juicy and flavorful I have NEVER had to add broth or liquid to keep it from drying out, Trust the method, your mother or grandmother may have insisted on Browning the meat first to sear in the juices or add liquid etc, but a open shallow pan without liquid makes some of the best roast you'll ever eat.

Finally found a recipe for roast that my son & husband really really liked. I don't eat meat but cook it & I BBQ the best steaks etc but cooking roasts in the oven - I am not so great. Basically followed all of the recipe - cut down salt & used sea salt. Used a bit more onion powder & crushed dried herbs before adding. Cooked until 140 ish F - then let sit on counter under foil for 15. Made gravy with drippings & beef bouillon. Cut real thin - great med rare colour & great reviews from the boys!!!

This is the BEST roast beef EVER!  Don't change a thing, unless you are using table salt.  Then, as Joel said, cut the amount in half.

Really good.  Very moist.  I used a smallish 2# roast (Dexter organic cow) and was worried that it would be dry.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I rubbed the roast lightly with first with canola oil and then Dijon mustard.  I then applied the dry rub but cut the salt in half and skipped the cayenne.  Perfect!  I'll be making this again as soon as I can find another organic, grass-fed roast.

I tried this recipe after reading all of the reviews.  I felt it there was an odd flavor and even the smell was overpowering.  I am not sure if it was the paprika.

I really like this recipe.  The mixture of seasonings was very delicious.  The meat was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The only downside is that I had to cook my roast about 1.5 hours longer than the 1 hour the recipe suggests to make sure it was done.  However, I will use this recipe again!

Excellent.   I used about a 1.5 tsp of minced jarred garlic (because that's what I had on hand) and reduced the salt to 1 tsp.  I had the time so I slathered it on early in the day and baked it hours later.  I didn't notice a huge difference in how far the flavor penetrated the meat, but it made me *feel* better ;)

Each time I make this roast I get great reviews.  The second time I made it I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and the paprika by half.  These adjustments were per my own family's taste. We are not huge salt users. I also let my meat set out for about 30 minutes before cooking.  Still, an excellent recipe.

I made this last night. I was using 2 pork sirloin roasts, so I doubled the rub recipe. I only used 1 TBS of kosher salt because I was worried about it being overly salty. It was perfect! My husband and I loved it, and will make this again and again. The only change I will make next time is adding a can of beef broth (as another reviewer suggested) so that there is more jus/gravy. Super happy with this recipe. Thank you!!

Yummo in the tummo. I make this once a week and sometimes vary the spices. Tastes so good medium rare with a side of buttery mashed garlic sweet potatoes!

I suspect this recipe is for "rare" meat lovers.  I did it with a 1.5lb sirloin roast - 1/2 of what the recipe called for - but still the full spices and cooking time.  The rub might be tasty, our meat was tough.

Followed exactly (minus the cayenne pepper because I'm a wimp :) and thought it was excellent. Really good flavor, wonderful blend of seasonings.

Turned out well.  Cooked at 450 for 10 mins (oven sear), then for ~1.5 hours at 275.  Would eat this again, but wouldn't use it every time we have a roast.  Paprika is a distinctive but yummy flavour.

This is quite spicy.  I used Himalayan salt, but only half as much after reading some reviews.  But the paprika and cayenne overwhelmed the meat.  I know my dh and my ds won't eat it :(  I like it okay, but I like hot/spicy food.  The other thing that was disappointing was that it did not render any juice after 1 hour.   I also let it rest a half hour and when i sliced it, it was still mooing. :(  my roast weighed 3 lbs.

Absolutely amazing!! Thank you Joel..! I did what a previous poster did and put all the spices in a zip lock bag and let it marinate, brought it to room temperature and cooked in oven. Mouth watering. Best roast beef I ever had.

Very flavourful rub - my husband and I love it!  The only change I make to the recipe is that I don't add any onion powder (only because we never buy it) and it's still amazing.

Super tasty rub - we're gonna make a tub of it to have on hand! However, just following the timing with no thermometer was a BAD idea! Wayyyy overcooked in our small upper oven. Alas! Lesson learned!

So good and so easy. The family loved it and I'm making it again tonight! The 145 probe temperature gave me more of a raw end; I prefer heating it to 155 and then letting it sit. Kids won't eat it too red.
A keeper!

Oh. My. Goodness! This is DELICIOUS!! We now buy the meat for it whenever we see it at the butcher's, just so we can make this recipe. The first time i didn't have all the right spices, and it was great anyway. It seems to handle quite a bit of fooling around with the spice mixture and still be fabulous.

I never cook and this came out perfectly! I let the seasoning sit on the meat for a couple hours before I put it in the over. A meat thermometer is definitely the key to cooking this perfectly. Delicious! Won over the whole family on Christmas.

This was fabulous!  I used a 4 lb top sirloin.  I also left out the onion powder simply because I didn't have any.  I tied the roast with a string, but otherwise did it exactly as written.  This is the best roast I have ever cooked that wasn't a prime rib.  The pan drippings also made a nice au jus.  Yum yum.

VERY tasty.  Along with the other dried ingredients I replaced the onion and garlic powder with 1/4 cup of finely chopped onions and two crushed garlic cloves.  I also replaced the thyme with two large fresh sprigs of rosemary. I believe the olive oil was instrumental in facilitating the tenderness of the meat. I have only tried the rub on the Sirloin Tip Roast.  It will be interesting to see if it turns out as wonderful rubbed on Chuck Roast.

My husband and I both loved this spice combination.  The meat was indeed very tender, but oh so flavorful.  I needed to roast the meat longer than an hour to achieve the internal temp. of 145 degrees.  Thanks for making our meal so wonderful.

I only used half the cayenne, as I was afraid my son would not eat it if it was too spicy.  This was awesome!!!!  The meat was tender and juicy and the gravy made from the drippings was really tasty.  It made a great change from the ordinary, and my son and his friend asked for seconds.  I love it when something this easy becomes a family favorite. :)

The seasoning is very strong and not kid friendly at all.  This is not a flavor that I think compliments the beef AT ALL.  It is way too spicy for a nice piece of sirloin.  It's unpleasant spicy (flavor wise).

I tried this recipe with my family tonight, and we would have to give it four stars. I did not have any foil but I did use a coverd roasting pan. I layered the roasting pan with chopped apples and butternut squash. I then followed the recipe completely. I put the pork on top of the veggies and roasted for one hour. It was great. I did cook the apples a little to long; next time I will wait for a half hour then add them. All in all it is a great recipe for a pork roast and the squash and apples that I added really complimented the dish.

Such great spice on the crust.  Roast was very juicy.  Pulled it out at 140 deg and it was perfect, if anything it was on the rare side.

I made this yesterday and it was heavenly!  We like it medium rare so I baked it more around 45 minutes and then took it out to set for a little bit.  My daughter was over the top about it!

My husband and I just finished eating this roast for dinner.  We are waiting out Hurricane Sandy and I was hoping that the electricity would stay on until this roast was done.  It did and was absolutely delicious.  I had a 3lb sirloin tip roast from my butcher and cooked it just an hour at 350 for medium rare.  Another thing I did was apply the rub and let the roast come to room temperature about 15 minutes.  Remember to slice it thin, a sirloin roast can be a bit chewy.  Will make it again.

Amazing flavor!  We loved it!  Rub would work on other meats too.  Will cook a bit more to the rare side next time.

This is the most delicious rub I have ever tried! It is spicy, so if you don't like spicy cut back on the paprika and cayenne pepper. I made it just how it stated and it was a hit with everyone in the house. Will definitely use again!

Wow!  This is a fantastic recipe.  I love the rub.  I will make this many more times, I am sure.  I only slightly changed one ingredient amount.  I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon.  For those who say the rub is too salty, be sure and follow the recipe and use only kosher salt.  It is much less salty tasting than table salt.  To the person who created this recipe:  "Thank you very much."

This was a great rub for my pork roast. My roast was on the smaller side and I used the whole recipe of rub on it because I love flavor- but it was a bit overpowering for me! Next time I'll cut it back.

The BEST of everything! I add 1/4 tsp Creole Seasoning and rub roast and let sit 30 min. Put on BBQ spit set on high for 5 min with 1cup hickory chips (in tin foil rolled into tube at other end of BBQ) after 5 min lower flame to lowest possible level (lower than low if possible) Cook for 60 min or until internal temp is 160 deg F. I serve with mashed potatoes and corn. Don't expect any leftovers.

I thought it was a great rub, I used it on tri tip, a little spicy for the kids but the rub was only on the outside, so they were still able to eat it.  Very flavorful.

This recipe is great!  I'm always looking for flavorful rubs that don't take a lot of work and this one is wonderful!  I usually use a TriTip and cook for 75 mins at 350.  Let it sit for a bit before cutting and it comes out perfect for everyone.  The smaller end is more on the med/well side and the bigger end has a nice rare/med-rare finish.  The only thing I added to the recipe was 1/8 tsp of mustard.   And yes, use kosher salt, it helps cut down the saltiness.

My husband said this is the "best meal I've ever made."  We've been married 20 years, that's saying something as I cook all the time.  He took left overs to work and said it was actually better even the next day!  We had no issues with salt (used Kosher salt) and I only had a 2 1/4 lb roast.  5 Stars for sure!

The meat turned out perfertly, moist and delicious. However the rub was entirely too spicy for this particular cut of meat. I believe this would make a good rub for chicken or ribs.

I finally registered for the site to comment on this, and one other recipe.  I made the recipe exactly like your original and it turned out awesome.  I used kosher salt and didn't think it was too salty.  My son is a steak fan and not often happy when I do other cuts of meat, but he loved this one.  The cut of meat wasn't my favorite, but it was what we had from our steer.  The rub kept the roast very moist, I just didn't like the gristle running through the cut.  I'm looking forward to trying this on other cuts of meat, and maybe a pork roast.

I used this recipe for a sirloin tip roast I made the other night, minus the paprika (because I didn't have any). I also added 1/2 teaspoon marjoram. The roast came out divine! My husband loved it too! I wrote down the ingredients on a little card to keep handy in the kitchen and am using it again tonight for grilled chicken. I can't wait to try it on grilled vegetables too --zucchini, corn on the cob, etc. I LOVE this recipe!

I made this last night for my family, and it was a hit! Most of the family are sick, so not all of them got to enjoy it.  I will be making it again real soon.  I had all the ingredients but the Kosher Salt.  I used Sea Salt.

I made this last night and it was very good.  I was a bit nervous about the amount of salt, cayenne and paprika so I changed the amounts. I've used another recipe before that contained a lot of salt and it really didn't sit right with me, so now I just cut it out or way back.  And since my younger daughter doesn't like a lot of spice, I also cut back the cayenne.  Other than that, it was very flavourful and was happy with the outcome!  will make again!

Very salty! I would suggest using, like others have said, 1 tsp salt, and perhaps no garlic powder. Other than that it was pretty good.

Wow--loved it! Very flavorful...I used this rub on a pork that was only 1 1/2 lb so it made it a bit more on the spicy side but I loved it...I am making it again for company tonight.  I cooked it for an extra 10 min also b/c I like mine a little more done.  Really wonderful!!

We have used this rub a few times now!  First time we used it on a roast.  We also rubbed it on a variety of steaks and aged them a week....so so good!

Great simple recipe! I made this with a filet mignon roast as part of a special dinner for my family, and they loved it! Other changes I made were to sprinkle dried onions as well as freshly sliced mushrooms on top after putting the rub on the roast. I would have added freshly sliced onions instead of the dried ones, but did not due to time constraints (I had bought the mushrooms pre-sliced). It was very tender and made a significant difference compared to the original, but like most people, my budget only allows me to do this for very special occasions.

Wow! I literally just finished eating this and am in awe of this marinade! I used a tri-tip roast and slapped this on about 20 minutes before sticking in the oven @350 for 1 hour. It was soooo flavorful and moist (despite minimal marinating). Delicious. Will definitely try on some other cuts of meat! Yum!

This was good, a little too peppery/spicy for the kids, my husband complained that it wasn't salty enough (I didn't add what it called for, I guess I should have).  I will make this again with some changes.

This roast was delicious. I have made it twice now. The first time I prepared as directed and it was delish (I left out paprika because I didn't have any, and used a different kind of roast because I couldn't find the sirloin tip). The second time I prepared it I didn't have the oregano, and let the roast marinate in the ingredients overnight before roasting. Also came out delicious. The second time I made it for my father and he didnt particularly care for it, calling it "too herby"... I will make it for him again and leave out the thyme and oregano, and think it will still be awesome.

This recipe is easy and tastes great, although we might minimize the cayenne pepper.  I also had to cook it at around 375 as it was not close to being done at 350.

Very tasty roast. This was my first oven roast (I normally do a pot roast in the crock pot) and it was very nice & tender. Great seasoning (rub is awesome)! I had some minor timing issues as I had a smaller roast than the recipe called for and was working with a convection oven, so next time I'll know enough to get it exactly as I want.

Usually I ruin meat because I'm not much of a carnivore so when it comes to expensive cuts of meat, I leave that part of cooking to hubby. This is one I cooked myself and he actually raved about what a good flavor it had. I had kosher salt but it was the coarse kind and the recipe doesn't specify so I used sea salt instead. I was afraid the coarse salt would be too much.

Very good.  I brought the roast to room temperature before using the rub.  Both my husband and I found that the cayenne made the broth a bit too strong for us, so will leave it out next time.  I also cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon in order to decrease the amount of sodium, and it was still very tasty.

This recipe is perfect! I, like Joel, like my food highly seasoned and this is seasoned to the T! Even without all the ingredients (because there were a few things I didn't have), I used what I had and it came out perfectly!!! Shared my meal with another family and they all raved about it too, how perfectly seasoned and flavourful it was! Two thumbs up for this Joel & thank you so much for sharing!

This is seriously the best tri-tip roast recipe I've ever tasted. My husband and I have eaten tri-tip at multiple restaurants and this recipe puts those places to shame. I cannot thank you enough for posting this recipe, we will surely be referring to it time and time again.

Definitely on the salty side. Will reduce salt for next time.

Have to agree this was an outstanding recipe ! Sirloin roast can be tough or over-cooked. Follow this recipe to the letter and you will not be sorry.
Good job !  I made the rub in advance, let the meat sit at room temp, We are High Altitude so the cook time was an hour and 20 min. Then let it sit for 15 min. - it was just wonderful.

So easy, and so good! I usually decrease the amount of salt and use sea salt. Everyone loves it. Thank you!

Amazing Roast. I add lots of potatoes, red, yellow, and purple varieties, green beans, onions, mushrooms and my kid loves it. He requests this for dinner he loves it so much. Makes the house smell fantastic also =) Thanks for the incredible recipe!

This was really good. It had a lot of flavor and was really juicy. I did reduce the cooking time to 45 minutes as we like our tri tip medium rare. Also, it was a little too salty for me so next time I will use half a tablespoon.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Very tasty rub! I used pepper flakes as I did not have cayenne. I had a 2 1/4 lb roast and it took over an hour to reach med. rare. maybe my oven is off? Would make this again.

This was my first Sirloin Tip Roast. I followed it to a T with the exception that I roasted it with some onions and carrots. It was the perfect doneness  -medium at 145 to 150 degrees and the rub was delicious. It even flavored the carrots and onions that I put in the pan. This is most definitely a keeper!!!

Excellent flavor!  I would personally use a little less salt, and make a double batch to toss your potatoes with for oven roasted potatoes.  I cooked this on a rack over my winter vegetables so the juices would drip onto them and it worked very well.  Adjust your cooking time for the weight of your roast and desired doneness.

Excellent recipe.  The meat turned out flavourful and moist.  It was a little too spicey for my family so next time I will cut down on the cayenne and black pepper.  However, this is how I will cook my roasts from now on.  Thanks for the recipe.

The rub for this was excellent and I will use it for other recipes. However, none of us were fond of the sirloin roast. It was very fatty and tough. Thanks for the great rub though!

This is a keeper. I only used 1/2 teaspoon since a tablespoon really is too much. Came out perfect. The only thing is next time Im gonna have to cut down on the cayenne. It was too spicey for the hubby.

Loved the spiciness and layered flavors of the rub!  Using the produce available (after my dog ate the shallots, bananas, etc),  I included some kiwis--the flavor adds tartness like cranberries without the intensity and the texture is nice.  I also substituted hot Hungarian paprika.

I was not prepared for the salt attack,but a few changes and it was rescued. I ster fried the meat with onions, red peppers,a touch of garlic corn and served on warmed flour tortillas.  Loved it.

This recipe got good reviews so I thought I would try it as I had never cooked a tip roast before but I have to say I was dissappointed. The meat was tough and chewy. I tried to slice it thin since that did seem to help. The gravy was delicious though.

This has a delicious spicy flavor. Perfect for us but if you don't like spice might cut back a little.  I followed the instructions exactly so was a little disappointed that my Sirloin top roast was tough.

I love hot and spicy foods. This  however has to much cayenne pepper. The cayenne pepper over powers the other wonderful spices. I suggest less cayenne pepper. Not a keeper!

This recipe had too much salt and ruined the roast for me.  I should have known better than to use that much salt.  I will try it again but with less.

Absolutely Outstanding!  I followed this exactly, except I did not have olive oil so I used sesame oil...it was still great!  So juicy and tender.  Left overs the next day was just as good.  Thank you for sharing!!!

Used the seasoning mix, but cooked another way. Turned out perfect!~~ I also let it sit out for two hours to get room temp and then cooked in stages.

This was excellent!!  I followed the recipe to a "T".  I would take others suggestions and back off the salt, it was slightly salty.  My roast was just under 2 lbs.  I cooked for 45 minutes and covered with foil for fifteen after I removed it from the oven. This is a keeper!

This recipe made a very flavorful roast.  This was the first time that I've made a sirloin tip roast, and I could believe how easy it was!  Everyone enjoyed it and I will definitely make this again!!

Pretty good rub and didn't contain any MSG!  Was a bit too spicy for me, but my housemate loved it!  I used a 3lb round roast cut instead of 3lb sirloin tip roast cause the butcher was out of str. I wouldn't do that again as it took 2.5hrs to cook and came out a little tough.  We did take it out after 1hr per the recipe, but it was def not done yet, so we popped it back in and kept checking it. Will try the rub again, but with less cayenne and on a diff cut of meat.

I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out good, if a little salty. The meat was tender and just about right. I carved off all the seasoning. Next time, I would definitely omit the salt.

What a delicious, tender roast this turned out to be...and so easy, too!  Except for cutting the salt and cayenne back, made it as written, cooked it to medium rare, and it was perfect.  Next time, I think I will make exactly as written to kick up the spice a little bit.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

We really enjoyed the flavor of this roast and didn't find it too salty at all. My roast came out tough and I followed the directions closely. My roast also came out of the freezer, does that make a difference? I will use these seasonings again but I think I will cook at a lower temperature next time.

This was fabulous as is. IT was salty but I love salt so it was great... the only thing I would change is the thing I did myself and that's I would probably cook it a little less. I was worried that one hour would not be enough time so I cooked it more like 2 hours but it was still good. I think I would have liked it a little better a little pink and that's how it was at 1 hour. Hubby and hubby's cousing devoured it and my 5 year old couldn't get enough. Thanks for this recipe...will definately be making it again!!!!! YUMMY!!

Very good, didn't have kosher salt so followed the recommendation for 1 tsp regular salt. Made in crockpot, would recommend 5-6 hours on low. Check temperature for desired doneness. Bonus was that sirloin tip roast was on sale!

This was very good.  Made as stated, but only had a 1.75lb roast.  Still, I used all the rub.  Roasted for 1/2 hour in my convection oven, took out at 135 degrees and let it stand for 15 min.  Everyone loved it! Thanks!

Used a cut of elk sirloin.  Rubbed the spice mixture on and let sit for sevral hours in the fridge.  Cooked on a charcoal grill... AMAZING!  Not dry at all, which is often a problem with elk roasts.

This was great!  I had a sirloin tip roast I didn't know what to do with.  The flavor of the rub was good.  I cooked it a little too much for my liking, but it wasn't dried out or anything - next time I know to cook it less for more med. rare.  Thanks - not only do I have a recipe but a technique for roasting these kinds of cuts!

"Hey, this is GREAT" is the comment by the men in my family!  I found it a little spicy and salty, so I'll try it with a little less cayenne and salt next time - but a great dish!!!

Taste was great, meat was a little tough.  That could have been that I overcooked it, or that it just wasn't that great of a roast to begin with.  Some of my kids thought it was spicy, but not so much that they couldn't eat it.  I'll be trying this again.

Excellent, I did exactly as the recipes said(the salt half because I use salt table). I had to cook for 30 minutes more as I like it just sligthly pink but it was still very tender and the spices were gooood. I did 6 beef roast recipes and this one is my favorite and the one I will redo.

Awesome!! I followed recipe exactly and not only did it smell delicious but a three pound sirloin roast was gone before I knew it by 5 people.  It was tender and I can't wait to make it again.  The rub had just the right amount of ingredients and I will be using it again on other meats.  You will not be disappointed.  This is the first time I made it too so easy!   I did allow the roast to come to room temperature and rubbed it the night before.

This was great!  I was nervous, thinking it would be dry but it was juicy and delicious.  It did not make au ju for me though, that all dried up as it cooked.

My rating is strictly based on the rub - delious- I used it on my eye of round steak...I had to substitute cajun season for cayenne.

I made this exactly as directed. I give it high ratings for the flavor. I didn't like the rare meat. My family prefers it more Medium. I had to return it to the oven for another 20 min. I took it out when the thermometer read 150. It was still too pink, but we were hungry. I sliced it and put it back in for 10 min. That seemed to get it to the correct temp. Overall, my husband, myself, and 4 year old ate it up. I will make this again.

Very nice.  If looking for a nice pink center, make sure to cook just until 140 and then remove and let that puppy rest a good 15 minutes.  I didn't know sirloin roast could taste so good!

This was excellent but because I used a much smaller roast (1.5 pounds), with some smoked paprika from Budapest, it was very spicy. However, knowing that proportions make or break a recipe, I will absolutely make this again but either with a bigger roast or less smoked paprika!  Highly, highly recommend!!

SO, SO good!!! My daughter said that this was the best dish I have ever made! I also thought that it turned out wonderfully. I didn't really change anything from the original recipe...except maybe throwing in a few extra dashes of salt and such. My daughter asks for this very often, and refers to it as the "good meat." When she asks me to make "good meat", I know that she means this recipe!!

This is soooo delicious.  I put on the rub (forgot adding the olive oil but it really didn't need it), let it sit on the counter for an hour.  Seared both sides on medium-high heat on a gas grill and then moved to indirect for 40 minutes.  Made the best roast beef sandwiches ever!

This is absolutely the best recipe i have ever tried. Marinate this in a zip lock bag overnight for flavorful meat all the way through. I cut the salt in half(I used sea salt). A lot of people cut the cayenne but don't-it does not come out spicy, but perfect and flavorful.

This is the BEST sirloin tip roast I have ever made or eaten.  I soaked up some of that incredible aujus with a few dinner rolls after eating the beef.  I read in Joel's bio that he likes to grill and BBQ, and I'd bet money that this recipe has been used on the ol' charcoal grill a few times. Thanks, Joel, this is definitely a keeper.....Al

Very, very good recipe for rub. I did cut the salt in half and was glad I did. We served our sirloin tip roast with mashed potatoes, garden salad, sauted onions and mushrooms, and a little horseraddish cream sauce on the side. Wonderful and thanks for the recipe. I also haved used the rub on other meats with success.

Awesome! In place of the cayenne I used a sweet chili steak seasoning. I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon of table salt because the seasoning already had some salt in it. Halfway through cooking I turned the roast and added balsamic vinegar to the bottom of the roasting pan I used. The drippings made a really nice sauce for on top of the meat and the veggies. This seasoning mix would go nice on barbecued steaks, too. Thanks!

The rub was excellent.  I used my oven probe set to 145 degrees. It was still somewhat rare.  We prefer medium. I will set it a bit higher the next time I make it. Another reader had marinated her roast in the rub for 4 hours in the fridge. That would help tenderize it a little more.  I was hoping for a more melt-in-your-mouth texture. Overall, it was much better than my usual roast.

I made this recipe exactly the way it is here. However, I put only a teaspoon of table salt in. Turned out fantastic! It got rave reviews from my family. Even the six year old loved it.  I will be making it again fo sure.

It certainly doesn't get any easier than this - wow! A very tasty recipe, and so easy to whip up...we ended up slicing this up for an impromptu crowd (thought it was just going to be two of us, originally) and served with some mashed potatoes (among other things.) Will make sure I stock up on sirloin tip roast when it's on sale now, so I can make this when the mood strikes!

This was awesome! The friends I made it for said it was the tenderest roast they'd have. The cooking time for my roast was about 4 hours - it was only half way thawed when I started cooking. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a t.

This is the first beef roast that I've ever made that turned out amazingly well.  I think next time I'll put the rub on then let the roast sit for an hour before roasting to get the flavours into the meat more (and I may slit the roast and put garlic clove halves into the roast as well).  We thinly sliced the roast leftovers which were wonderful on soft rolls the next day.

What can I add to the hundreds of reviews, but DITTO! This is truly wonderful; per other reviewers, I did increase and decreases spices to taste, but honestly, the one hour to cook is the perfect temp and amount of time. This is a MUST TRY, and will serve many since you slice it so thinly.

We love hot spicy things, but the rub on this roast made the ends uneatable. The gravy I made from the roast was also very spicy. This was not a wow meal. I would leave out the cayenne pepper next time or look for a new rub.

very good, and very spicey!  Seems to have strong salt taste in crust. However, there is not a lot of salt!  will make a gravy in A.M.-until, I will use sour cream and horseradish.

too spicy hot, I never was too crazy about this cut of meat to start with.  The seasoning was not of my liking either.

Not thrilled with flavors and mine turned out dry on the edges and moist in the center.  I prefer my roasts braised.  Thanks anyway.

This recipe is awesome. Everyone raves about my brother-in-law's seared garlic roast, but this blows his out of the water. Thanks !!

My husband and my sons absolutely loved this dish. They were all begging for seconds. I had a 4 pounder so I cooked it a little longer and doubled up on the spices. This rub is the best and could easily be used on different types of meat. This is a dish I will make often.

Best meal I've made for a long time, I used a bottom roast, and made it in the rotisserie, it was so good...I followed the recipe exactly as to the herbs.  I am thinking of making it for company sometime.

Amazing and oh so easy!  My family loved this and so did I.  I did modify the kosher salt to only 1 1/2 tsp and that was plenty.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet corn.  Perfect combo!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was soooooo good! The rub was perfect, though I substituted a couple of crushed garlic cloves for the powder, and left out the onion powder and cayenne. The meat was not quite as bloody as I would have liked it, but it was juicy enough for the rest of my family :-) and we're all looking forward to making sandwiches with the leftovers tomorrow.

This is very flavorful.  I did cut the cayenne pepper a bit since we don't care for hot flavors and added more garlic & onion powder.  It turned out perfect and everyone loved it.

The flavoring was nice but it took two hours to cook at my house and at that point the rest of dinner was done an hour ago.  I will try again sometime with different timeing!

This was great. I added a little more garlic and onion powder, along with a little minced garlic. It came out perfect. I left it in a little longer since we like it more med-well. I served it with a brown gravy, prepared with the drippings.

Well, maybe it was because I covered the roast with foil??  I also added veggies to the pan. This was almost inedible it was so spicy.  Maybe it was user error... but oh. my. gosh. Leftovers didn't get eaten at all, either.  ****UPDATE*** I made again but used the rub for a pork sirloin roast.  I cut back just a bit on the peppers and it was delicious.  I didn't cover it this time, and cooked the veggies separate.  I'm upping it a star (so, now 4 stars) with a temptation to up it to 5.

I gave this recipe 4 stars initially because it is a little spicier than I like, however, it is now one of my go to rubs and is a big hit with the rest of the family.

This was a different way to prepare a roast.  I enjoyed it.  It was very flavorful and easy.  You can definately feel the heat from the cayenne.

The spices on this roast are great.  The cooking method seems to make the meat tough and chewy.  Maybe it is the cut of meat chosen for this method.

This was very good, although too hot for a main dish (but great for an appetizer).  I would cut the cayenne powder in half, (or perhaps use a mild cayenne powder). Pretty salty, too.

This was really great & I would recommend it to anyone.  It turned out just like a prime rib roast and melted in out mouths.  As with a previous review, I agree that if salt is not one of your favor things cut back on the amount or omit it.

I found this a bit salty for me as well...I will simply back off on the salt as well (I used kosher)...additionally I think I would back off on the oregano as well next time...

other than that, it is a great rub and one I will use again...

This was excellent.  It had a bit of spice but it was not overpowering at all.  I had to cook it longer as some of my family freaks if they see pink meat.  It was still very good.  Cut it thin for the best result.  I had no leftovers.

Love it! I did add the 2 TBLS of flour.
My 16 yr old son actually commented "this is really good" & daughter who does not eat spicy thought it was yummy. It was moist, juicy and very flavorful.Soo, thank you!

Everyone liked this except my son, who doesn't like pepper.  Everyone else said to just cut back on the pepper next time.  Gravy was a little strong!  I roasted mine uncovered in the oven 200degrees, for 5 hours.  It was about 5 lbs.

Great! I rubbed butter on the roast and then the herbs. Then, before cooking, I broiled the roast for 10 minutes to make it yummy crispy on top. I even turned it a little to get lots of crisp. Then I cooked the roast.

This was my first ever roast, and it turned out so well!  I didn't have kosher salt, so I just used regular, but halved the amount.  I also didn't have onion powder, so I just used dried onion flakes.  The flavor was wonderful, and seeped through all the meat, which turned out surprisingly tender.  I'll definitely use this one again, and as soon as BBQ weather comes back, I'm going to try grilling it.

I can not count how many times I have tried making a roast and it has ended up falling apart and being stew. This is the first one I have made that turned out perfect and the flavors were wonderful. I will probably marinade it for much longer next time to really get the most from it.

I didn't have any kosher salt, so I used regular and used half of the amount specified.  I added the rub to the roast the night before so the overall flavour had a little more kick than I thought it would, but it was still very tasty.

For all the good reviews and spices involved, I found this to be a bit bland. It had a good taste but just not very flavorful. I don't know if my spices were off or what. Also, I didn't care for the red "chili" appearance in the drippings from the cayenne and paprika.  I cooked 2 roasts each 3.5 lbs., making 2 bowls of the rub seperately so the purportions wouldn't be off; let it stay in fridge overnight. It took about 1 hr 45 mins to get to 140 degrees and my roasts were not that thick. I think I let it "stand" too long, as the meat was over cooked and not that tender. For me, this type dish was not good to do for a crowd. There's too much going on during a party to manage the meat timings.

I got raves from this recipe. It was my first roast...I hate pot roast because of the flavor. This was a good beginner recipe. It did take forever to cook but that was because I wanted it well done. I'll probably make this again.

Although I was a little worried about the salt that everyone had mentioned-I loved this recipe!!  The salt was not overpowering at all-- I found it to be perfect!  Although I didn't add the cayenne pepper as I have small children who don't usually like spicy stuff, I followed the recipe exactly!  I guess it is a matter of taste in regards to salt!  This one is definitely going to made again!!!

All my husband could do after taking a bite was shake his head and say, "Delicious!"  I agreed.  The roast did take me about 1.5 hours just to reach 146 degrees, but my oven might be off.

I made this roast for dinner tonight, and it turned out very yummy. It was easy to make too, which is always a plus for me. I will probably cut back ont the salt next time, but everything else was great. The extra sauce tasted very good on mashed potatoes too. Thanks for the new recipe!

This is the very best. The gravy is wonderful. I'm trying it on a pork roast tonight. I wish I could give it a 10 star rating. The only change was less salt.

excellent flavor on the rub. Used prime rib roast instead of sirloin tip and cooked to internal temp of 130, but we like medium rare and meat always cooks more after you take it out. Smelled awesome roasing also and so easy!

This recipe was really good. My little ones don't really enjoy spicy food so I didn't add as much paprika or cayene pepper. I think next time I'll cut back a little on the salt too. The flavor was great. I'm looking forward to trying the rub on other cuts of meat with those little changes.

This was my first time making a roast and it was fabulous! The spice rub is amazing! I used a 6lb shoulder roast and after 1hr,30 min it was pretty rare (but our company loves rare meat so it all worked out :)). Also, I cooked this the night before, stuck it in the fridge, and then reheated it the next night. I cut it right before serving.

Did not like this at all.  It was too salty, and thankfully I checked it early as it was done very early.  It was better cold the next day, but I doubt I will make it again.

This was really good, but it took about an hour and 45 minutes to roast to where the meat was medium0rare, which is the way we like it.

This is a great recipe, but the cooking time was off.  It was very rare.  I've done this before with a smaller roast and it was perfect.  This was a 3lb. last time it was 2lb. Unfortunately, this time I had guests

I don't eat red meat but once a month or so - for me, this was a pretty good roast, if a bit salty.  I had to cook it 12mins past a full hour to get it to 145 degrees, and probably shouldn't have - it would have been more juicy without the extra cooking time.

This recipe was great! Now that I've followed the recipe as submitted, I have to agree with other ratings... marinating overnite and grilling on indirect heat would make this a top 10 meal!

I made this exactly as listed and my husband (a known salt addict) loved it-- he even said it was better than his mother's which is no small task!  This recipe was pretty salty (as a non-salt-aholic), but I did not find it spicy though.  Also, my roast was 2.8# and 1 hour was plenty for med well ends and med rare-med middle.  I'll definitely make it again, but will "make it my own" by experimenting with the ingredient list.  Isn't that most of the fun of cooking? :)  I'm not good at inventing dishes myself, but I can alter them so this is a great place to start!

This was exceptional! The spices were perfect. The only change I made was to put in 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper-I am a wimp when it comes to hot spices.

This roast was quite easy to prepare and had a nice flavor, but it was nothing spectacular and took so much longer than the hour to finish cooking to medium well that everyone ate their sides and waited 20 mins for the roast. My roast was only 2.5 lbs so I'm not sure what the problem is... maybe people like a pinker roast?  Either way, good but not great.

This was wonderful. Definately one that you will be glad that you tried.  I went according to the directions, except my husband grilled it (indirect method) after searing it over the coals for 2-3 minutes on each side.  Served it with "Cheesy Potato casserole" also on this site.

This is a great and fool proof recipe. I think I will use the same recipe for Prime rib. I am sure to make it even easier you would be able to use any of your favorite ready made cajun spice mixtures.

Thank you Joel for your submission.  We tried this recipe, added more onion and garlic as we prefer, even added a dash of Worcestershire as was suggested by another recipe tester. Perhaps we may try this recipe using fresh herbs as was suggested, but I doubt if we will try this recipe agaain.

This was wonderful.  Smelled and tasted great.  I wrapped it in foil and put it in the fridge for 4 hours or so.  My husband said "it's a keeper, this smells great, wow, can we use this on anything else?" all in the same sentence, so I guess he liked it.  :-)  I used a little less salt, and I used Kosher salt, so table salt I would definately cut in half. I was also out of Thyme, so I double the oregano. 
THanks!

I am Hungarian and tend to love paprika which lead me to this recipe (rub).  I thought the paprika taste was too overpowering.  I was leery of the cayenne, as I don't care for spicy flavors, but the cayenne was not really detectable.  I'll try this again, but reduce paprika, maybe increase garlic!

I recommend reducing the Paprika to 2-1/2 tsp. and the Cayenne to 1/4 tsp. for those who don't like things too spicy.  My roast came out fantastic!  In fact, my very picky mom asked for the recipe.  That's a big compliment!

It's hard not to give this recipe five stars.  The meat has an excellent flavor, but it's a bit too salty.  The first time I made this, I used table salt, but the next time, I used the Kosher salt the recipe called for.  STILL too salty.  Cut the salt in half.  And people who like their meat rarer than medium need to cut down the time considerably.  I like my meat medium rare, cut five minutes off the cooking time and it was still medium.

Very good flavor doubled all ingedients except salt (left that out and sprinkled a little on just before roasting) also added 1teaspoon of 6 pepper spice and 1 of dried red pepper, had a 5-1/2 lb. roast. Put the rub on 2 days before roasting (roast was partially frozen when I used rub). Srinkled with course ground pepper and the salt, roasted at 450 for 20 min. then 325 for 2 hours for med. rare. Very good, served with au jus. good commets from gathering of 25 for easter.

Although I overcooked the roast (my fault), we did enjoy the rub.  Will make again, and next time I won't overcook.

This is my first review, but I felt I just had to post.  After 24 years of marriage, this is the first roast my husband raved about.  I took the suggestion of another poster and used fresh herbs.  I also marinated the roast in a Ziploc bag in the refrigerator for 4 hours, then put it in the oven as stated in the recipe.  It was a 4 pound roast and, after 1 hour, I took it out and let it sit.  It was still a little too rare for me, but, like I said, my husband and my son said it was the best roast they'd ever had.  Thank you, Joel!

Wow.  This was amazing.  I'm not a big fan of beef, but my boyfriend is so I thought I'd try it.  Glad I did.  This will become a regular in my household.  Thank you so much!

Fantastic!  The flavor is as good as the best prime rib I have ever had ! I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I just omitted it. I also just used the canola oil I had instead of olive oil.

I was looking for a spice rub for my annual boneless prime rib roast...found this.  I tripled the amounts for a 14 lb. roast and added 1 Tbsp. of prepared hot horseradish to the paste.  Well, I got more compliments about how this was my "best roast yet"... 
Thanks, Joel!

very good flavor. I will try again in the crockpot as I overcooked it a little in the oven and slow cookers are more forgiving.  Whole family enjoyed the flavor.  thanks!

This is our first review ever, we just had to write.  This is a delicious recipe!  We used dried oregano from the garden, fresh garlic and shallots from the garden.  We also used fresh ground peppercorns.  We did cook it in the crockpot w/a tiny bit of water.  We did cut the cayenne and salt in 1/2 but next time will try the full cayenne.  We sliced it on the meat slicer and it was so flavorful, tender and wonderful one of our dinner guests even tried to offer  a tip!!  Thank you for sharing.  We will use this tried and true recipe again and again!

I made this roast today and I thought it was very good. I did not have any onion powder, so I used real onions instead that I put on top of the roast while cooking. The only thing I found wrong with this recipe is that there was no sauce with it!? So I made my own: 20 minutes before taking out the roast, I added a pack of onion soup that I had diluted with water, and added some mushrooms. Finally, I thickened it with corn starch. Delicious!
Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of the roast beef recipes I have tried.  I made it for a family Sunday dinner and everyone loved it.  I will not make a roast any other way again.  Thank you.

I really liked this rub. It had just the right amount or kick. I placed the roast on a bed of cubed yukon gold potatoes and the dish was delicious. I did have to bake my 3.3lb roast for almost 2 hours to get it at 145 degrees. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out great, although a little dry, but might have been something I did.  Very Tasty~ Served with mashed potatoes and veggies.

Made this with a whole beef tenderloin. Liked the results but will be sticking with my usual way of preparing tenderloin. Kids thought it was too spicy.

It smelled so good cooking, that I knew it would turn out. My roast was probably larger than three pounds, as it needed more than an hour to cook. But it was the perfect color when it came out of the oven and was very tasty. Will do again.

My husband and three kids loved this roast.  So easy to make, too.  I will definitely make this again soon.
