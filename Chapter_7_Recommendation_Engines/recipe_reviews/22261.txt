I really, really wanted this to be a 5-star recipe, but it just wasn't.  The beef and the veggies were yummy, but my husband took a bite and said, "Hmmm...  The gravy's sweet."  In husband-talk at my house, that means, "Why did you ruin the gravy with all that sugar?"  (He tries to be nice about it.)  He liked the beef, but he only took about 2 bites of his rice with the gravy.  (Please note that I did rub the sugar directly onto the roast, along with the other spices, but in cooking, all of the sugar ran into the gravy, which I expected.)  I also found the butter rubbed on the roast to be excessive, and I found myself trying to skim a HUGE layer of fat off of the top of the gravy when the roast was done.  I don't think the butter contributed a whole lot to the recipe.  This is a good starter recipe, though, and I may try it again minus the butter and sugar.  I liked the mix of onion, garlic, and brown gravy powder.  Just a little too sweet and fatty.  Thanks, though!

We loved the flavors!  I didn't cook the potatoes with the roast.  We wanted mashed potatoes instead.  I also left the carrots in bigger chunks instead of diced.  The sweet and salty were a great combination.  I wasn't sure at first, but my family requested that I make it again and again!  Thanks for the recipe.

This * was * so * good!  I'll never make pot roast any other way again!  I used real butter instead of margarine and Knorr brand brown gravy mix. And I think next time I'll use a larger roast (6 lbs, maybe), since we had a ton of leftover veggies (but they were goooood).  The roast was tender and juicy and the seasoning was just right.  If you like the juxtaposition of slightly sweet and salty, then this recipe is for you!

My husband was not very thrilled when I told him we were having roast.  All the other roast that I did before never seemed to turn out.  This one was great!  I added slivers of garlic inside the meat and added pepper.  Its a keeper!

Perfect basic recipe.  I think I like the smaller roasts better, though, especially since I had to cram the huge thing into my 5 gallon stockpot!  I was a bit skeptical about the instant gravy, but man did it taste better than my bland, lumpy, cornflowery version!

Although I didn't reduce the temp (oops)and I omitted the potatoes because we wanted mashed, the roast came out tender and juicy and my husband loved it too! I will make it again. I didn't use the butter, I just sprayed butter flavored cooking spray onto the meat prior to the spices etc...worked fine.

Very good recipe.  Great teste!  A few less potatoes and carrots makes a more balanced meal.  Or douubling the meat.

I thought the recipe was a little too sweet.  I don't know what I did wrong, but there didn't seem to be that much sauce and it burned.

Really good-I left out all of the sugar except 1 tbs because of other reviews.  My husband has requested this as a "make it again!"

This was a very unique take on regular pot roast.  I am not very fond of carrots, but the "gravy" made them so delicious.  The potatoes were also great.  The meat was tender and had a slight sweet taste.  I was worried because I thought that a sweet pot roast would be gross, but it added just enough flavor.  I asked my husband if he wanted me to make my regular roast or the sweet one...he said the sweet one!

I cooked this in the crock pot... I do not know if that effected the roast or if it was just a bad roast. It seemed tuff...maybe I just cut it wrong. Flavor was great!!

Potatoes and Carrots were WONDERFUL although the meat to me and my husband wasnt anything to brag about. I'll probably make again, maybe adding some garlic and other spices. Thanks :)

The flavor is good, but the tenderness just can't compete with a slow cooker.

I didn't really care for the meat cooked like this.  I typically cook mine in the slow cooker, and it comes out much more tender.  but it also could have been my cut of meat.  The gravy and the veggies were very good though!  I didn't have brown gravy so I used cream of mushroom soup as the bases for my gravy.  So I might try the recipe again with the slow cooker to see how that works.

This recipe turned out great and was super easy to make.  I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/3 and I will do that when I make it again.  I also added chunks of onion to the veggies.  Great the first time and as leftovers.

I loved it!  My husband was less fond, however, my father, who is very picky, also loved it!  I put it in the crock pot for the day and it smeeled great and tasted great!  Thanks!

Flavor of the potatoes and carrots was very good! The gravy a little to sweet for my family's taste. Meat came out tender though. Will try again with a little less sugar and more spice.

This is the best pot roast ever.  So easy to prepare, and taste great.  The gravy is sweet, but that is one of the reasons I love it.  If you don't like a sweet gravy, you could cut back on the sugar.

YUMMY!! I love the combination of sweet&salty (i.e. french fries with ice cream :) nonetheless this recipe made for a surpassingly delicious, extremely flavorful new family favorite!! I used half the meat as that is what I had & decreased cooking time @ 300 by 30 minutes. The results were fantastic- I'm pretty sure I'll never use another pot roast recipe again, thank you!

This is very tasty.  I actually quadrupled the recipe the 2nd time I made it.  My church always furnishes the meats for our potlucks, and we just make side dishes.  Sometimes we bring food in and sometimes we cook it.  I had told them about this roast and they liked the idea.  It was a HUGE hit...Thanks...

I made this for 16 people.  I used 9 lbs of roast.  My husband said it was the best roast ever and the veggies were to die for!!!  Since my Mom died I have tried to make her roast and I have not succeeded.  Today I did!  Thank you!!!
