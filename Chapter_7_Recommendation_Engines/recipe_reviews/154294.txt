I can't fairly rate this recipe because I modified it. I read about the consistency problems that other people had and It just didn't seem quite right to me that there wasn't any eggs. I doubled the recipe, omitted the yogurt completely, added two eggs, another 1/2 tsp of baking powder and then enough extra flour until I got what "I" consider to be "normal" muffin batter consistency.  I also boiled the milk with extra chai spices like cardamon, ginger and cinnamon, (plus the tea bags) then strained it. This modification came out nearly perfect!

First, let me say a few things.  I have never given a 1 star rating before.  Usually  the recipes that I make do have some value to them.  The flavor may be a little off, the texture may be weird, the cooking time may be wrong, but their is usually something that I do like.  Let me also say that I love chai.  I drink chai every morning, so I really thought that I was going to like these cupcakes.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter turned out to be watery, not just wet, but watery.  After pouring it into the liners, I baked it for 20 minutes and checked them.  Not done, so left in another 5 minutes, not done.  After 30 minutes of baking, I removed them.  They collapsed within minutes.  I don't even know how to describe the texture.  It's like a really soggy cupcake - like goo in a cupcake liner.  I would say tht maybe I did something wrong, but I have baked a lot of cupcakes and never had anything like this happen before.  I was going to top these with the chai frosting from this site, but didn't even want to waste my ingredients trying to save these cupcakes.  Sorry!

Loved these! Very moist. I made a vanilla frosting and added a little nutmeg and cinnamon and they were great!

I made these just a few days ago and they were delicious, a cousin to carrot cake! I upped all the dry stuff, especially the chi tea which I let steep for a bit longer and did without the vanilla because I did not have any, and added two eggs. I debated adding the yogurt but ending up throwing it in last second then added flour until I got a nice texture. They came out a beautiful color with a nice spongy texture, not too moist at all. (If your batter is too soupy add flour of course!) They really did taste like chi. If yours did not, next time use an extra tea bag and steep for longer. I will be making these again.

After reading the reviews, I followed one of the modified recipes (double the recipe, skip the yogurt, add 2 eggs, and an additional 1/2 teaspoon baking powder). I also substituted the chai with 8 servings of instant coffee (like Starbucks Via). I used milk chocolate frosting. Went over HUGE at a party.

Did not care for the texture at all. The taste was very good and "moist" could not even begin to explain the mushy feel. Loved the taste though, wish it worked but it just didn't.

The texture of these cupcakes is not very appealing. It tasted like a somewhat mushy pancake, although they were fully cooked. The flavor is nice and spicy but the texture really ruined the recipe for me.

These cupcakes were amazing! I am a sucker for chai and these hit the spot. I read other reviews that said to omit the yogurt and add two eggs so I went half way and added 1/4 cup yogurt and 1 egg and they were perfect! Turned out just like a cupcake should. I topped it with chai buttermilk frosting also found on this site. YUMMY! I will make them again and again.

Since I saw reviews that said these didn't have a string chai flavor, I substituted the milk/tea mixture with a chai concentrate liquid (mixed 3:1 instead of the recommended 1:1).  Also, instead of frosting them (which I felt took away from the chai flavor), I glazed them.  I used powdered sugar, a little bit of cinnamon and ginger, and enough of the chai mix liquid to make a glaze.  I also think this compensated for the very moist texture, since there was no mound of frosting on top. They came out great!

I liked the multi-layered flavor in these "cupcakes"... the quotes are because they were more like muffins for me. I altered the recipe a bit by using vanilla yogurt and only 1/3 cup sugar. I liked how they turned out but will be working toward a more fluffy version next time.

This one actually turned out pretty good for me, except the batch was so small (only 8!). Because of everyone saying that they were too moist, I didn't add all of the milk mixture,just until the texture was smooth but not too liquidy. If I make this again I will most likely double the recipe. My boyfriend who doesn't like chai loved them, but he said they didn't really taste like chai (I never got to frost them!). If I make again, I will definitely double the recipe. Definitely worth making though!

Amazing cupcakes!  I only used the two chai bags (I used vanilla chai).  Also, I used applesauce instead of yogurt as I didn't have any; works great.

This was easy to make and tasted great but I suggest dont use a pepper grinder as a substitute for the ground pepper.

i think it was a lovely recipe. the moisture came out really nicely. cooked for 20 min and seemed to be a magical time. be careful however, because even at the twenty minute mark, a slight amount of cake will show up on tooth pick. this is because they are so moisty moist.   paired with the vanilla-chocolate frosting recipe. but did not add chocolate. 1 1/2 c con. sugar and half a cup of butter.[8 TBSP] room temp of course. 1 tsp of vanilla. beat together eat that ish up!

DO NOT MAKE THIS CUPCAKE without modifying the recipe a significant amount!!

Everyone's right, it's waaay too runny. I ended up with closer to 2 cups of flour. I also added 2 eggs. These cupcakes were pretty bland, despite me adding even more spices. They have a nice chai smell and faint chai taste, and are a lovely color, but I wouldn't enjoy them without frosting--that's how unflavorful they are. I recommend trying a different recipe...

The chai flavor of these cupcakes was great! And, I used vanilla frosting, which was a nice compliment. The only thing about them is that they were VERY moist -- to the point that moisture seeped through the liner. Possibly because of the yogurt? They sank in the center, too, unlike most cupcakes I've made.  But, I don't think my friends and I minded too much -- they were gone pretty quickly!

I also made the modified recipe (cutting out yogurt and adding an egg and more baking powder) and it was FANTASTIC! I might even say they were the best cupcakes I've ever eaten. I made an almond cream cheese icing I modified from K. Hughes's pumpkin bar icing recipe. They were beautiful and had great texture. I just wish I had made more!

This is an excellent recipe-- with modifications. I followed chillmama's suggestions (extra spices in the milk, eggs instead of yogurt, eyeballing the batter and adding flour until it looked right) and then made a few of my own: I substituted 1/4 cup of the sugar with honey, used almond milk, and lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees to keep the honey from browning too quickly. I also added a bit more pepper by accident--  probably close to 1/8 teaspoon-- which seems to have added a stronger, and very nice, peppery edge. Very tasty!

I was a bit skeptical the first time I made these for a family gathering!  They were an instant hit!  Have made them numerous times since then, including as a dessert item for a nephew's wedding!  The only change to the original recipe was to decrease black tea and increase the chai spice!

Delightful cupcakes, however I did change the recipe , I added 1/4 cups of flour, 1 egg and halved the yogurt, the consistency was about right and the cupcakes were delicious ! I will surely make them again.

I substituted sour cream for yogurt as I was out of yogurt.  I added homemade vanilla extract and sour cream to the icing.   Excellent cupcakes.  Will double the recipe next time.

I added some cornstarch to thicken it in place of an egg, but I LOVED this recipe. Will definitely make again- especially for the holidays!

Amazing recipe!! Used almond milk, with 2 red chai tea, and 2 black chai tea bags. Then I used melted margarine instead of canola oil. Instead of yogurt I used cultured almond and cashew. They came out perfect and moist, not spongy at all.

Great taste but the texture turned out a little off. I added a little extra flour to to try to thicken the batter but it didn’t seem to help too much. Even after baking the cupcakes were so moist that the paper liners got stuck to the cupcakes. Next time I’m definitely using the tinfoil liners and I’m going to play around with the liquid ingredients to try to even out the consistency.

If you like chai, you'll like this recipe. I made some vanilla coconut frosting (coconut milk instead of milk or cream) and it went very well together.

The recipe needed the omission of yoghurt, another 100g of flour and an egg to work out at the right consistency. Taste is fantastic, however.

Yum!!! I did not have yogurt so I added one egg white and 2 tablespoons of 1/3 less fat cream cheese, softened. I used decaffeinated tea and I would imagine any kind of chai tea would work.  My kids and I loved these cupcakes!!! They don't need frosting but would taste great with any kind!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Like most of the reviews I found it strange that there were no eggs. The batter was very liquid and the cupcakes did not rise that much. I’m thinking double the recipe; add more flour, baking powder and 2 eggs should do the trick. Other then that I have to say they tasted just like chai and I found them to be delicious. Will definitely try the recipe again with some adjustments!

I modified this recipe a bit, due to the people that said the texture was off on these cupcakes, and mine turned out very nice and not too sweet. I used soy milk and reduced the amount to 1/2C, plus added 1t chai masala spices to the milk-tea, used oat flour instead of white flour, 1/3C fat free plain greek yogurt instead of 1/2C plain yogurt, added an egg in with the wet ingredients and I also added about 1t grated fresh ginger. I also added about 1 1/2 scoops plain pea protein powder, which you can't even taste in the final product, but you can just add some more flour, about 1/3C until cupcake-batter consistency is reached.
