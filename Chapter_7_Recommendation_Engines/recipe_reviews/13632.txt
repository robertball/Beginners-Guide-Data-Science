I made a double batch of this tonight and it was simple and delicious. I did, however, add about double the amount of apple cider. The recipe says to cook and allow to THICKEN, but I felt it was too thick before I even began to cook it. I desired my pumpkin butter to end up about the consistency of apple butter, which is why I added the extra liquid. Just adjust your consistency according to your liking and it will turn out perfectly. I had it on buttered toast and it was divine and perfect for Fall. I have canned it (6 full pint jars with a double recipe) and will be decorating the jars with fabric, labels, and raffia tomorrow for gifts.

Apparently there are questions if pumpkin butter is safe to home can. Check out the page from the University of Georgia Extension Office.

Yummy recipe!  Easy to make, but requires a little canning know-how.  Mixture is thick so cooking is very splattery.  I recommend stirring nearly constantly.  Also, I found it very helpful to stir and mix with a wire whisk instead of a spoon.

Absolutly wonderful!  I used canned organic pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice and *no* added sugar except for a drizzle  (about 1tablespoon) of real maple syrup and a few shakes of stevia powder (a natural safe sweetner); it came out sweet enough...I can't imagine adding the 1.5 cups of sugar the recipe calls for, totally un-needed. I did use about 1 cup of apple juice rather than the 3/4 C recommended as I like it a bit less thick. Put it in my crockpot and then canned after hot water bath.  Would totally recommend to anyone, completely yummy and super easy to make.  

We love it on toast and on whole wheat buttermilk pancakes instead of maple syrup for a nice change and less sugar.

This is a wonderful recipe! I doubled the batch and used my crockpot instead of the stove. I also used fresh pumpkin and pureed it in my food processor.  The result was some beautiful and tasty gifts for my family and friends.  Will definitely be making more soon!

This is fabulous but DON'T can it! It's unsafe to do so. A water bath cannot get the core of the sauce hot enough to be safe to can. Only cubed pumpkin should be canned and only in a pressure canner. If you freeze this it will be fine.

We love this recipe! Our son has a peanut allergie.  We had to look for a repacement for pbj sandwhiches most kids eat.  Our son loves pumpkin sandwhiches.  He takes them to school with him. We put it on buttered toast, mix into a vanilla shake and make a pumpkin shake! Mix into 1/2 gallon of vanilla ice cream and refreeze and make pumpkin ice cream. Use as spreads for snack breads, Or fillings inbetween cake layers and frost cake with whipping cream Or cream cheese frosting.  Poke a hole in cup cakes and use this as a filling.

This is a great recipe my daughter made it for 4-H. We made canned and fresh pumpkin that we cooked down. The only compaint she received was that it was too sweet. It is a little on the sweet side ....the next time we make it we will reduce the sugar.

This pumpkin butter is easy, yummy and verstile!Use it to make Pumpkin Pecan Ice cream! Just mix it in to butter pecan ice cream and you won't be able to put down the carton!  Or warm up and pour over some vanilla for a pumpkin pie ala mode!  Lastly, create a panini with cream cheese or any mild cheese, apples slices, turkey and pumpkin butter! YUM!

I made this over the Christmas holiday season and gave some as gifts. I did double the recipe and tweaked the spices to suit my taste. (I used pumpkin pie spice and only a little bit of ginger.) I will definitely make it again. 
I canned it and gave the jars away to friends. I was told last night by one couple that received one,that the jar was licked clean. That is a sign of a good recipe as far as I am concerned!
We put this pumpkin butter on Grandma Johnson's scones. It was delicious. 
I added this to my personal recipe book tonight.(I loved it enough to hand write it on a recipe card!) Thanks Eleanor!

I followed the recipe exact. Very simple. The spices were spot on but for us, it was a little on the sweet side. If I was to make it again, I would cut the sugar back by half. Four and a half stars.

I wanted to try this because I bought a jar of Pumpkin Pecan Butter at Williams Sanoma and loved it. My husband really loved it and wanted more. I made a double batch of this and we liked it as well as the store-bought kind. We have since made many more jars and are giving them as gifts for the holiday season.

I love spicy pumpkin butter, but I didn't like all the ginger in this one.  Next time I think I would just use pumpkin pie spice in place of all the spices or cut the ginger in half.  I made this is a slow cooker on high for a few hours until it reached a consistency I liked.  Worked well, no splattering and no stirring.

Love this Pumpkin Butter & grew up making it from fresh pumpkin. My mother didn't believe in using tinned pumpkin as fresh is better. If you cook your pumpkin flesh first, please don't boil it as you really do lose a lot of flavour!  Instead, roast the pumpkin pieces to concentrate the flavour. Simply cut your pumpkin into large hand size pieces, scrape away seeds but leave the skin on. Place pumpkin pieces, skin side down) into an oven dish, prick flesh with a fork (not sure why but Mom always did it so I do it, too) & roast/bake in moderately hot oven until flesh is tender.  Leave pieces to cool & then scrape the flesh from the skin to purée down.  Personally, I put the liquid that results from the baking into a bowl, then push the scraped flesh into a sieve to ensure a very silky purée, rather than using a food processor to purée it. Mix the sieved flesh with the liquid and then your ready to add your sugar & spices to cook down.  For something a little different, add a wee tablespoon of whiskey to the pumpkin butter for an extra kick - it's hubby's favourite to start Christmas morning. My British neighbours LOVE my Pumpkin Butter, Rum Balls and Green Mountain Chutney that I make and give out at Christmas =)

THIS IS EXCELLENT, WHAT A GREAT FIND FOR THE HOLIDAYS. SO GOOD IT WILL MAKE YOUR LIPS FALL OFF. ALREADY HAVE MADE IT TWICE. YOU CAN ALSO MAKE THIS IN A CROCK POT. JUST SET ON HIGH OR LOW AND LET IT COME TO A BOIL STIRING IT OFTEN. PUT A PAPER TOWEL UNDER THE LID OF CROCK POT TO CATCH THE MOISTURE SO THE WATER DOES NOT DROP IN THE MIXTURE OF YOUR PUMPKIN BUTTER.  EVERYONE WILL LOVE IT.

This recipe is wonderful! I have had butters in the past that are so blah. This recipe has so much flavor! I added a 1/4 cup more of apple juice to thin it down a bit,and 2 tbsp of butter. I canned 6 (1/2 pint) bottles from 1 batch. I boiled my bottles and lids, put the hot butter in, sealed and inverted them on the counter for about 20 minutes and wahla! They all sealed perfectly. Thank you so much for a wonderful butter!I'm sending some back to Hawaii for Thanksgiving!

Waaay too much ginger, if you follow the recipe as is. I used 1/2 of what it called for, and I still thought it was too much. Otherwise, the recipe was okay. I don't know if I will try making it again or not.

I cut the spices in half all the way around on the second batch. The first batch seemed almost bitter to me and didnt have a great pumpkin taste.

This is great! I got five 1/2 pints out of my batch. It's like spreadable pumpkin pie, but sweeter! I had added the 1/2 c brown sugar along with the 1 1/2 c white sugar. I'm spreading it on Grandma Johnson's Scones!

Firstly, Yes CJ, you can freeze pumpkin butters. I haven't tried freezing THIS one but it ought to be fine. And JAIMENICOLEC is right. Several years ago the USDA deemed preparing pumpkin this way unsafe. I had been canning my own pumpkin butter in a boiling water bath since before then and I intend to continue doing so, but everyone MUST be aware that they do so at their OWN RISK. Again, pumpkin butters can be frozen safely for up to about a year.

I've been making this as part of my Christmas gift packages for a few years now.  This is one recipe that everyone asks me to repeat.  For the effort, the reward is fantastic.  I make over 100 jars per year.  As a side note, since FDA does not recommend canning squash, I do mark every jar as "Keep Refrigerated".  Thanks so much, Eleanor, for posting this fabulous recipe!

Taste like a pumpkin pie. I had it on toast and it was delicious.Plan to try this on pancakes. I used pumpkin pie spice and it taste good. The only problem I had was removing all the air bubbles. Will not getting all the air bubbles make it go bad? This was the first time I have done this.

Excellent!  The only change I made was decrease the ginger to 1 t  and increase the cloves to 1 t.

I made applesauce this morning and decided since the canning supplies were out to make pumpkin butter. This is my first time making it. I used this recipe and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the other individual ones, and I only had apple cider, so used that instead of juice. I, instead of sugar used Agave nector and a little splenda brown sugar to save those precious carbs. It's fantastic! Just delicious. I'll make this again and again. Making some more next week for christmas baskets. Thanks so much.  sue

I made the pumpkin butter to put into the "Pumpkin pecan cheesecake" recipe that this author also listed.  If you are making the pumpkin butter for the cheesecake recipe, it is great - don't change a thing!!!  But I found that this pumpkin butter just by itself is WAY too strong - much too sweet, and the spices are overwhelming.  My husband came home from work while I was making this and he said the spices were so strong it made his eyes water!  Just a warning - add sugar and spices a little at a time until it suits your taste.

I cooked this in a saucepan as I don't have a crockpot. Anyone thinking of doing the same had best be prepared for a great deal of splattering. Be careful not to scald yourself when little bits of the mixture fly out of the saucepan. When I taste tested the mixture hot out the pan when it was done I wondered what in the world had I made. It was extremely spicy almost to pungency, I thought the entire thing had gone to waste. However, after leaving in the refrigerator for a while it seemed to taste better and now that I've kept it for about a month or so (just myself to consume the whole thing) it really tastes very very good. The flavor just seems to keep getting better with age. The taste of the spices mellows down and the flavors seems to blend a lot better. I was quite put away by the amount of sugar needed to be used and cut it down to about half or less. The mixture seems to get naturally sweeter with time and now it tastes just about the right sweetness so I'll permanently reduce the sugar subsequent times I make this. Though I think this tastes very good as is now the ginger is a tad bit strong so I'll try cutting back a bit the next time and see what happens.

Fantastic! Great gift idea for fall!  If you like pumpkin pie, you'll love this.  I used apple cider instead of juice and substituted brown sugar for about 1/2 of the white sugar.

I cut the sweetness back by half and I used Truvia instead of granulated sugar. (When googling the conversion chart, I got 18 packets to equal 3/4 cup of sugar.) I made no other changes. This was very simple and the end result was absolutely perfect--the smell while cooking was fabulous. I'm glad I cut the sugar by half, I think that if I hadn't, it would have been too sweet for us.

I used approx. 4 cups of fresh pumpkin that I roasted and processed. I cut down the sugar amount, and used only 1/2 cup, and added 2 tablespoons of real maple syrup. I used about 1 1/2 cups of apple cider.

Tasty and perfectly spiced!  I no longer have to buy expensive pre-made pumpkin butter.  I like to put a dollop of pumpkin butter in plain yogurt for a tasty treat.

I made this to put in the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake.  Hope its good in there because its way too strong to eat by itself. Too many cloves! Update 9/29/11-This recipe is awesome in the Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake!! That is one of the best desserts I've ever made. I froze the previous batch that I made in small portions to thaw and use for cheesecakes throughout the holiday season and I'm about to make a batch to freeze for this year.

I have a question/concern.  I've tried store-bought pumpkin butters in the past and wanted to make my own, but the USDA recommendation is to NOT can pureed pumpkin b/c the density and pH varies too much- which can lead to botulism.  The advice from other canners seems to be to ALWAYS freeze or refrigerate pumpkin butters.  Has anyone tried this recipe and stored it in the freezer (& fridge after opening)? Any comments on the safety of this recipe?

I absolutely love this butter! It was easy to make and tastes great for the holidays. Just watch out when it "boils". I had to stir it the whole time so I wouldn't get it all over. Well worth the trouble though. Definatley a new tradition in my family!!!

I made a few modifications based on reviews such as using less sugar (I used 1/2 C of white sugar, 1/2 C of brown), I used apple cider instead of apple juice. Next time I will cut back on the clove because the recipe calls for too much. It give it's a bite and 'clovey' aftertaste. If you cut back on the cloves, you'll have a 5 star recipe.

This is a great recipe, but I used pumpkins from my garden instead of the can. And he questions if pumpkin butter is safe to home can. Yes if you fallow all instructions on handling and sterilelizing the jars. Ben making this for years and never had a problem.

Oh my god this is just delicious! For some reason my mind thought that I was supposed to use cider- so I did. It's got a nice spice to it but I do want to try using just apple juice too to see how that turns out. I did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white which is delicious. It didn't make a mess for me, I'll be making Christmas Pumpkin Butter this year for sure!

I made a small batch to keep in the fridge and use w/i a week, so I didn't need to concern myself w/ making it safe for canning. For this purpose I found COOKING IT IN A DOUBLE BOILER reduced the stirring needed and the spluttering. I prefer it much less sweet so I used a little less than half the sugar. I also adjusted the spices to my taste: ground coriander seed instead of nutmeg (very similar taste w/o nutmeg's bitterness), subbed allspice for the major portion of the cloves but did use ~ a quarter of the cloves called for (in my batch that was just a pinch). Personally I like ginger better than cinnamon, so the proportions of those spices suited me just fine. The result is a delicious sub for good jam which is so hard to find these days for a reasonable price. I'm sure fresh baked pumpkin would make it taste better, but that would be impractical for my little household. I'm thinking of making a batch of butternut squash butter in the future by microwaving the squash.

I found the cloves to be too much - they overpowered the whole recipe, so next time I would reduce the amount. Otherwise it turned out very nice.

YUMMY!  My entire family loves this Pumpkin Butter.  Per the suggestion of others I added a half cup of brown sugar to the listed ingredients, but found this to be much too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth).  To correct I added another entire 29oz can of pumpkin puree.  I then just tasted and added until I got the mixture right for my taste.  I used: two cans pumpkin, 1.5 cups apple juice, 1 1/2 c. sugar, and 1 c. brown sugar.  I added my spice to taste, which was approximately 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, and 2 tsp. cinnamon.  This was just right for my taste.  Cooked 4-5 hours on low in crockpot.  I packaged in 8 oz jelly jars and tied on fall ribbon, made some jar toppers on the computer.  Soooo cute!  I gave them as teacher gifts and they were very well received. If giving as gifts, make sure you tell the recipient to REFRIGERATE - safety first! This is excellent on bagels with cream cheese, oatmeal, ice cream..... Great, inexpensive gift and taste like FALL!  Thanks Eleanor for a super recipe.

I used: two cans pumpkin, 1.5 cups apple juice, 1 1/2 c. sugar, and 1 c. brown sugar.  I added my spice to taste, which was approximately 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, and 2 tsp. cinnamon.  This was just right for my taste.  Cooked 4-5 hours on low in crockpot.  I packaged in 8 oz jelly jars and tied on fall ribbon, made some jar toppers on the computer.  Soooo cute!  I gave them as teacher gifts and they were very well received. If giving as gifts, make sure you tell the recipient to REFRIGERATE - safety first! This is excellent on bagels with cream cheese, oatmeal, ice cream..... Great, inexpensive gift and taste like FALL!  Thanks Eleanor for a super recipe.

This recipe is excellant! I made a double batch and had enough for 13 1/2 jars. LIke other reviewers, I added more apple juice because it already looked so thick. The pumpkin splatters as it boils so wear an apron or old clothes. I'm not a big ginger fan so only used 1/2 tsp. of it and added a 1/2 tsp. of all spice--- still a little to gingery for my taste, I will use 3/4 all spice next time. Also-- I usually complete my canning at the end of August, but had to try this recipe when I found it. I had a hard time finding jars in October. My advice for next year: STOCK UP! I bought the last 4 packs that Wal-mart had.

When I read this recipe I wondered why it uses 1/3 the sugar of other recipes for pumpkin butter.
It is not very sweet and if you are looking for a sweet spread, this is not it. However, the pumpkin taste is good and I like spreads that are not extremely sweet.
I think I will experiment a bit with more sugar, when I make it for a church boutique, but this is nice and I will certainly use what I made.

I made half a recipe and a lot of changes but we love the result.  I've wasted lots of apples in the past when I made apple butter & we thought it was way over spiced so this time I was honestly, a little scared of all the spices.  For 1/2 a recipe, I used 1c applesauce in place of the apple juice, 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger.  I didn't add any cloves or nutmeg.  I wanted to rate this because it's a good recipe that you can easily alter to your liking.

Wow, this is really good!  I made it for the "Pumpkin Pecan Cheesecake" recipe on this site.  I scaled it down so I would have just enough for that recipe, plus a little extra leftover.  I used 10 oz. pumpkin (2/3 of a 15 oz. can), 1/4 cup apple juice, 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/8 tsp. cloves.  I did modify the proportions of the spices to suite my tastes.  This resulted in about 1 cup of pumpkin butter.  I'm glad I had some left over after making the cheesecake!  It is delicious on toast with a cup of tea.  (I didn't have any apple juice, but I did have packets of instant apple cider, so I just mixed up a cup and used that - worked great!)

Yum! This is fantastic. However, I only added a third of the amount of sugar. I love sweet, but I think all the sugar, plus the apple juice, would be cloying. I added sugar slowly until it was sweet enough, and it ended up being about 1/3 of the suggested amount.  The cloves were a little overpowering. Maybe I threw it off balance because I added a little less cinnamon and a little more nutmeg? Anyway, less cloves next time.  So not perfect, but very very very good!

This is a very easy, tasty recipe.  The only change I made was to use fresh pureed pumpkin instead of canned.  The cloves are a little overwhelming- next time I will halve them- otherwise this was pure perfection.  Thank you for the recipe!

Made this with a friend a few years ago for gifts.  Had a TON of fun and it does taste good.  Makes only a few, but that's okay, and my friend was reluctant to give up the jars!

I tried to follow the recipe exactly (did not have apple juice so I had to use apple cider) and it turned out fantastic!  A little on the 'spicy' side but my family all gave it a thumbs up and each took a jar home.  Now we're all anxiously awaiting the day that I make the pumpkin pecan cheesecake.  Thanks for the recipe, it'll be a keeper for us!

We love this pumpkin butter, especially our six year old. Only change was no cloves as I didn't have any on hand.  It was still the best!  It made great Christmas presents, too.

This is easier than I could have imagined, and was a great way to use up extra pumpkin.  I like ginger, and it is still a little too much for me, so next time I will half it as a previous reviewer suggested.  But I did use closer to 1 cup of apple juice and half white and half brown sugar.  It's delicious!  And what a neat and easy gift!

Excellent!  Made my house smell good, too.  I was not sure what to do about the amount of sugar - some reviewers said it was too sweet; some said it wasn't sweet enough.  I went ahead and followed the recipe, and it was perfect!  I did increase the apple juice to 1 cup.  I, too, thought it was already pretty thick before I started simmering it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best pumpkin butter that I have ever tasted! 

I have made several batches to give as gifts over the Thanksgiving Holidays, just as I did last year.  Everyone raved about this.  As suggested, it makes the perfect hostess gift!

My family really enjoys this recipe.  I did decrease the sugar to one cup down from one and a half and I noticed no change in taste at all.  I did try making it with water instead of apple juice once and I did notice a big change and not for the better.  The apple juice really does make a positive difference.  To avoid the splattering issues that others have had, I tried doing it in the microwave instead.  Worked perfectly.  I put it in a glass bowl with a loose covering.  I cooked it for six minutes; stirred it; cooked for six more minutes; stirred it; cooked three more minutes and it was done.  I have tried stove top and slow cooker, but the microwave method is my favorite.

a little too sweet, but it has an amazing taste! I used fresh pumpkin puree (boil pieaces of pumpkin until fork tender then mash) instead, and applesauce since I was out of apple juice. Yum!

I used apple cider instead of apple juice, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1 tsp. vanilla, about 10 caramels, and for the spices i used allspice, cinnamon and a little nutmeg but that was it. I've made pumpkin butter several times for people and i like it this way the best so far:)

Yum!  Just got done making this, and it tastes fabulous!  2 changes: dropped the sugar to just over 1 c. & added a splash more apple juice.  Cook time was right on, be sure to stir every minute or so.  I love the spicy taste of it, the ginger really came through and it smells like pie.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe! I messed it up so bad the first time I made it, and it was still good (I didn't have any applejuice and used pear? anyway) I made it since then with apple juice and both were absolutely awesome.  I have made some for our bake sale and everyone cannot wait to try it.

Delicious and worth the work.  I did not have apple juice on hand, so I used apple cider instead.  The butter has a rich spicy flavor.  I doubled the recipe, but it only made 7 half pints and 1 quarter pint.

Delicious. The spice ratios were perfect. I used a whole pumpkin (I steamed it before I used it in the recipe) and doubled the other ingredients. I used some maple syrup and stevia in place of half of the sugar. The recipe made 8 jars which will be great holiday gifts.

This recipe has only 1/3 of the sugar I have seen in other pumpkin butter recipes, so I expected that it would not be very sweet. It is not very sweet. If you like that, then this is a good, and very easy, recipe.
I will probably experiment with more sugar when I make this for a church boutique, but I will also enjoy using the less-sweet version, myself.

This turned out great...my only recommendation is that you stir it from the other side of the kitchen with a 3 foot spoon, lol...lots of splatter and it burned my fingers trying to stir it! Yummy, tho! DOn't worry, the blisters are healing fine..... ;)

Made this for the first time over Labor Day weekend.  I made it a little harder on myself because I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  I wouldn't recommend using fresh pumpkin unless you have free pumpkins sitting in your kitchen floor like I did.  Didn't get to actually try it myself until last weekend (first time we were back home since Labor Day weekend).  By then the number of jars I had was disappearing fast due to my daughter giving it away.  Got rave reviews from all recipients so tried it my self while home last weekend.  It is delicious and I plan on making another batch or two before Christmas.  Thank you for the recipe.

One word of caution, pumpkin butter should never be canned to store on a shelf.  The USDA has tested it and found it is too dense to safely can.  It is not safe to can in a boiling water bath or a pressure canner.  I would like to see a word of caution added to the recipe for all to see.

Loved this recipe as it's so easy and no fuss to make, but I did find the spiciness from the cloves not to my liking so would adjust next time.

In response to those who questioned the safety of canning pumpkin butter,  you should NOT can it. Instead, it should be frozen to prevent bacterial contamination.

This recipe was great and very easy! I suggest getting your jars ready before you start cooking (if you are going to boil them) because once you start cooking the butter must be stirred constantly. I used apple cider instead of juice and it tasted wonderful! Very smooth and flavorful.  I haven't had time to make the pumpkin cheesecake yet but I found a good substitute is simply putting cream cheese and pumpkin butter on graham crackers. Mmmmm...

I had never tried making anything like this before, but it was so easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it comes out great, and  after treating the jars in a hot-water bath, it keeps for a really long time.  I tried to make a batch with Splenda instead of sugar for my diabetic father and it didn't work at all -- tastes like nothing.  If anyone has any suggestions to adapt this recipe to lower the sugar, please let me know.  As is, a fabulous recipe though.

Wonderful!  My husband loved it and he is picky, so finding something he liked is a review in itself.  It really does taste like pumpkin pie in a jar.  I used fresh pumpkin and pureed it in the blender and it turned out delicious.  Definately a new fall favourite in our house.

So by how much would you reduce the sugar? [from a review, below]. I am going to add pecans. I bought some pumpkin pecan spread, and it said it has pumpkin, spices, pecans and pectin. I KNOW it has sugar too. I will add the pecans while it's cooking, will soften them.

Very nice! Many reviewers thought that the original recipe was too sweet, so I cut the sugar in half, and used brown sugar instead of white. I also cooked it in the slow cooker, which kept the splatter down quite a bit. However, I thought the spice level was perfect, contrary to some reviews.

I would point out that using the freshest spices possible will bring out the best results. If possible, buy your spices from a local spice merchant in small amounts. Grocery store spices tend to have been on the shelves for a LONG time, which dulls the flavor.

This makes a delicious and delightful quick gift for just about anything, especially a hostess gift! I poured into mason jars, added tulle fabric on the lid and tied with raffia.
I did however, refine the recipe to less sugar and also substituted brown sugar on my second batch. I added a few dollops of local honey I received as a hostess gift providing a personalized gift in-kind with shared local natural sweetener!

Delicious! I did use half splenda/half sugar and cooked it on high in the crock pot (stirring often). I canned it up and will be distributing to friends and family. Thank you for a great recipe!

Not a bad recipe.... I feel there is too much ground ginger in it and will only use half next time. It is good though. In fact I think I'm going to make a double batch up and give as Christmas gifts to company.

Really easy, very tasty. I tripled the recipe since I had a number of pie pumpkins to use. I roasted them till the flesh was soft, them puréed the roasted flesh. I measured it and had about 5.5 lbs of purée. I used apple cider instead of juice since that was what I had on hand.  I did cut back a bit on the ginger since my kids are not big fans. This is a really forgiving recipe, adjust spices to your taste.
Absolutely lovely.

I made the pumpkin butter for the first time today using canned pumpkin, 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar (to recued the amount of calories), 3/4 apple cider, (I reduced all the spices after reading all of the reviews)3 cinnamon sticks (instead of ground cinnamon), 1/4 tsp of ginger, 1/8 tsp each of cloves and allspice, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Even warm it tasted delicious.  I can't wait until it is cold.

this recipe is quick and easy. but i have made some ajustments. i used 15 oz canned pumpkin, 1/2 c spiced apple cider from Trader Joes, 2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice from Trader Joes and 3/4 cup brown sugar. it made it all the more simple. i cooked it for about 30 mins. now its cooling in my fridge. can't wait to taste the final product tomorrow. (p.s. next time i think im only gonna do about 1/2 brown sugar) good luck all and thank you Eleanor for the recipe!

Scaled by half but reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, just right.  Will be adding this to steel cut oats for breakfast.

This is excellent!
We grow and can most of what we eat so I'm always looking for ways to use our produce.  This pumpkin butter is excellent 'canned' for gifts as well as future use.
This past Thanksgiving & Christmas we gave quite a few as gifts and everyone loved the flavor.
Additionally, I loved the ease in cooking and 'putting up.'

This is a really good recipe,  the only change I made was using splenda backing mix instead of sugar to cut down on the calories.  It turned out very nice.  Great on toast.

I was not impressed with this at all.  I have never had pumpkin butter before, so I guess I dont have anything to compare it too but this was not what I was expecting.  It tasted like i put spreadable pumpkin pie on my toast.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe. I made it as a hostess gift for a friend in Ireland, where pumpkin-based desserts are basically unheard of. Once the family got over the shock of what exactly I was giving them, they loved it! I substituted mixed spice (similar to pumpkin pie spice in the US) for some of the individual spices and brown sugar for white. I'll have to try it again some time with the original ingredients.

I used leftover fresh pumpkin I had on hand and it turned out terrific. Try stirring 2 tsp of the butter into a bowl of oatmeal -- delicious!

This was delicious, but the yield was completely off! I followed the original recipe proportions, and ended up with one pint of pumpkin butter.  Next time, I will add less ginger, but it's not overwhelming.

OMG! What a great recipe!  I had no idea pumpkin butter was so easy to make.  This was so good that I bought small canning jars, filled them with the pumpkin butter, tied a pretty bow around them and passed them out as gifts.   (follow the directions for canning with the glass jars) Great on toast, English muffins, scones, bagels, etc. I did not change the recipe at all.  Thank you

This is the first time I attempted to can something. USDA says not to home-can pumpkin butter so I'll store these in the fridge =( It made 4 (8oz.) cans and a bit left over for testing! Was much better once it cooled, but it still felt like it lacked something. I'll have to spread it on a biscuit before I make any definite judgements.

I made a few batches of this last fall when I had an abundance of pumpkins from my garden, so I used fresh pumpkin puree.  Wonderful!  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  My 5 year old won't eat a peanut butter sandwich without pumpkin butter on it now!  We are on the last jar so he is anxiously awaiting the next batch of pumpkin butter this fall!  Can't wait to make it again!

This was quick and easy. I liked it because it was not to sweet. But I do think I prefer the taste of brown sugar over white sugar.

I like this pumpkin butter, but I think it has too much ginger in it. I wonder what it would taste like if you used brown sugar instead of white. Like other viewers, I used a little over 1 cup of apple juice. Good recipe overall. Will try again and tweak the spices. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Sooo sooo good.  All the other comments were very helpful.  There's obviously lots of ways to use the recipe and it'll still be good.  Just a note:  I did not find it too thick.  With the idea of it being "butter" in my head I think it should be at least as thick as it comes out to be.  It spreads wonderfully.  Thanks!

I made this recipe with my daughter's preschool class.  I modified the recipe a little.  We used fresh pumpkin and 1 1/4 cup of dark honey instead of sugar.  The kids loved it and shared it with their families.

Very good, but I would cut back on the spices a little bit so that the pumpkin flavor would come through more.  This was so easy and inexpensive.  Great to give as a gift.

When I was canning the pumpkin butter, I wasn't very optimistic about the butter because the product tasted too sweet and seemed a little too over-spiced.  However, when I got up the next morning and opened a can to taste-it was AMAZING.  It wasn't too sweet and it did taste like a pumpkin pie! The only change I made to the recipe was that I only used 2/3 cup of apple juice.  Also, I only had 4 half pints instead of 5. But if you love pumpkin pie-try this!

Love pumpkin, so this was good stuff.  I would also agree about adding less sugar.  I packaged up in pretty jars and gave to families that we visited for Thanksgiving.

This pumpkin butter is good, but I'm looking for something that tastes a little more like pumpkin pie. Maybe tweaking the amounts of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg would do it. Thanks for the recipe, though, I enjoyed making it. It was quite easy.

Based on other reviews, I doubled the apple juice. I substituted Truvia (Stevia) for the sugar and used pumpkin pie spice. Loved it and it actually tasted better the next day.

I thought the spices were spot on but I assume it's all a matter of taste.  I started out with 1.5 pounds of fresh pumpkin purée which was the end product of the pie pumpkins I steamed in the microwave and puréed in the Vitamix.  Instead of 3/4 of a cup of apple juice, I used two tablespoons of frozen 100% apple juice concentrate.  I used a crock pot on high for 30 minutes, turned it down to low and cooked for 7 hours to get the thick consistency we like.  Yum!

I made this as Christmas gifts for coworkers. It was really good! I did adapt this based on another recipe to make it easier (and cheaper if you don't have all those spices on hand). To make about 18 small jelly jars,, I used 2 29-oz cans of pumpkin, 2 cups apple juice (great consistency), and 5 tsp pumpkin pie spice  + 1 tsp cinnamon. 1 tsp of maple syrup, and only 1 cup sugar, and
 It was plenty sweet! I can't imagine using the whole amount suggested in the recipe! 1/2 tsp lemon juice too. Only cooked 25 min., canned it and jars sealed on countertop within  5 hours. Will make again with these adaptations!

I made this today when I couldn't find it at the grocery store. I am so glad that I went and looked here! I made this for my homemade cinnamon rolls and it turned out great! I didn't have apple juice so I made an instant apple cider packet for the juice. Worked perfect!

This was OK.  It was eaten, but not overly enjoyed.  I had to cook it much longer than I thought and had to add extra sugar to it, but that's part of 'seasoning to taste'.  A good respectable recipe, but it didn't bowl anyone over.

I have made this for two years now.  Last Fall,  I made it with homemade puree from store bought pumpkins.  I gave away freezer containers of it as gifts.  Everyone loved it so much,  we changed the name to Pumpkin Heaven.  This Fall I made it with pumpkins from my own garden. You can make this in a crock pot on low and it takes 2-3 hours for it to get to  a peanut butter like consistency.  This is so much easier than stirring it in a pot for half an hour and being burnt as it splatters. The only suggestion other than making your own puree is to use less sugar. It doesn't need it.

This recipe is wonderful as a guide for pumpkin butter.  The spices are right on; however the sugar does need cut back a little.  I cut it back by a half cup and it was plenty sweet.  It is also great made with brown sugar instead of white and i followed what a previous post had mentioned and added a little bit more liquid as it was rather thick to begin with and i wanted it to reduce down to become thick.  Overall an awesome base recipe for fall. Amazing flavors!

This is the first time I have ever made pumpkin butter.  The recipe itself is quite easy to prepare.  My reason for only giving it 4 stars is because I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  That being said, it was hard to measure exactly how much pumpkin was used in this recipe.  The pumpkin itself was quite large so I upped the spices and sugar used.  I substituted stevia and brown sugar for the white sugar.  I roasted the pumpkin and ran it through a foley mill to make sure it was nice and smooth.  I also pureed it in the blender.  My biggest issue with this recipe was my inexperience with using fresh pumpkin. I wasn't sure how much of the liquid from them I should use and wound up adding in too much which gave it the consistency of applesauce.  I sprinkled in some unflavored gelatin and incorporated it well into the mixture and it brought it together much better.  The spices and sweetness were spot on and I was pleased with the results.
The next time I make this I will be using canned pumpkin as the recipe suggests. The amount of effort, my inexperience, and the mess just isn't necessary.  You know like they say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".  In this case I totally agree.  I will update this when I make it again.  Give this recipe a try, I think you will be happy you did!

I used the crock pot, was super easy to assemble. Perfect way to use my last pumpkin from a fall harvest. Maybe next time I will use more pumpkin and less apply juice. I felt the apple may have overpowered the pumpkin by just a bit.

Per other reviewers I cut the ginger in half, and subbed apple sauce for juice (x2).  This is so easy and delicious!  I've spent big bucks on this stuff and will be making my own from now on : )

I made this recipe last night for my daughter who is crazy over pumpkin butter and it's an amazing and tasty recipe!  I made a double batch...it goes fast around here.  Made some easy yeast rolls to go with it and it's amazing!  Will definately make this one for teacher/friend gifts too.

Great recipe and easy to make. I ALWAYS follow a recipe exactly as written.....the first time. I have to say though, that the amount of ginger is waaaaay too much, and that's coming from someone that loves ginger! I would cut the amount by half, if not more.

Loved this recipe! I used fresh cooked sweet potatoe to make up what I didnt have in Pumpkin.  My husband liked it so much he ate half the first week.  I served this with Pumkin pancakes, yummy! I will be making this often in the fall with fresh pumkin from my garden.

This is an excellent  recipe. I was lucky to have found a nice sale on pumpkin puree so I was looking for something to make besides the normal pies and breads. I made this yesterday and it turned out very nice. I gave some to a friend and her and her family loved it as well. It too bad you cannot can this or I would make large batches.
Thanks for posting this

I will add more sugar next time, and again make with orange juice because I like the harvest flavor from adding cranberries and orange juice.  A very good recipe with wonderful consistency.  I used fresh pumpkin from the garden :)

This is amazing. I did cup the sugar down to only 3/4 cup sugar. I also roasted my own pumpkin and used that. I cut the ginger down to 1 teaspoon and it still seemed very gingery. Next time I might cut that down. Instead of ground cloves i used 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. I can't wait to share this with my family!!

Great stuff, with a flexible recipe! I made a few modifications, starting with cooked pumpkin instead of canned. I didn't feel like buying apple juice, so I used the juice from a can of pineapple rings in 100% juice. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and accidentally added 1 tsp of cloves instead of 1\2--I don't recommend following my example there--and both flavors turned or pretty strong, so I added the rest of the cooked pumpkin I had on hand. I'm looking forward to  enjoying this on toast, crepes, mixing with yogurt, and maybe even as a muffin filling!

Never tasted pumpkin butter before so i really didn't know what to expect. But it turned out pretty good. I added a little bit more apple juice since it was pretty thick to begin with. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. I've heard mixing pumpkin butter with cream cheese tastes really great (sounds way awesome!), so I'm gonna try that. I bet it's gonna be delicious on bagels:)

I should have read the reviews first.  I used the servings adjustments tool to scale it down to the amount of pumpkin I had (to 10 servings).  It was leftover from making pumpkin bread, and I didn't want to waste it.  I tasted the pumpkin butter while I was cooking, and I am SO glad I did.  It was disgustingly sweet and had a strong undercurrent of pumpkin - not in the good pumpkin pie way, in the squash sort of way.  So I added more apple juice, cinnamon, and ginger.  That made it much better, but still too sweet.  My husband likes it, so I'll let him eat it.  I'm glad I only had about a cup of pumpkin available.  Hopefully when it's cold the sweetness won't seem to strong.

Was a hit with my family when i did this last weekend. Since they were all "pumpkin spread virgins", it was a wonderful pleasant taste experience. We spread it over toast, on a thin spread of butter / margarine, it was over scones too... Very nice.   I didn't use the canned pumpkin (couldn't find one at the supermarket) so i used a whole pumpkin, boiled it for about 15 mins, cooled it off, and blend it till smooth. The result is just heavenly and very good for the non sweet-toothers cos the sweetness is balanced.  Didn't really follow the exact amount for the spices (cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg) though, half of what was instructed and even then it was quite overpowering. So if you're the mild-spice person, go easy on them. Try a dash, taste. If you want a bit more, add some, taste test again.

Looove it! I never write a review, but this was worth doing it. Easy and delicious-my kind of recipe, since I am not a good cook- I have to say that for my sweet tooth, I would add a little more sugar(I used 1/2c. of brown sugar). Best recipe I found online, many, many thanks!!!!

I have made this same recipe for years and have canned well over 200 pints of it for my family and as gifts.  Have never had a problem doing it in a water bath process and we have been eating all I put up.  Will be doing this years batch next week and can't wait to have it on toast as I used the last in August but wanted to wait for fresh pumpkin to do more.

Be careful what kind of pumpkin you use. :) I had extra pumpkins from the garden so I thought I'd use one instead of the commercially canned pumpkin puree specified in this recipe. I then discovered that there is definitely a texture difference between "field" and "pie" pumpkins. (I always thought the difference was all about their relative sizes.) Field pumpkins produce a somewhat stringy, but still tasty pumpkin butter. I made this recipe again with a store-bought pie pumpkin and the butter was very smooth with a richer flavor.  (By the way, I'm using the stringy batch in muffins instead of milk and oil and they are delicious--and low fat!)

This was very good, used homemade pumpkin puree. I did increase the spices a bit and didn't use any liquid since I made  this in my crockpot, just let it cok all day long until it thickened up to the consistency I wanted.

I LOVED this recipe and it brought back so many memories from home in Pennsylvania.  I would reccomend though HALF as many cloves-especially if you aren't a fan in the first place.  You could compensate with nutmeg, but that's my preference.  It will also keep in the fridge for over two months, as I keep mine in tupperware-I'm the only one who eats it.  I guess its lost on my English housemates!

Need to cut back on the spices, like maybe half.  Then add more as needed.  Same with the sugar.

Great recipe, but I think it has a little too much ginger in it. Next time I'll add less ginger and more cinnamon.

This recipe was not only easy, it tasted great!  I didn't have any ground cloves, so I used the same amount of ground allspice and it turned out perfect.

Its basically just over spiced pumpkin pie filling. I halved the recipe and thank god I did because it would have been way too much otherwise. Probably not going to make again.

I didn't have apple juice so I minced a Granny Smith apple and pureed it with water. I left out the ginger because I didn't like the idea of it with pumpkin. The next time I'll cut back the cloves to a pinch. I got 5 half pints and froze four. We ate the fifth one on pancakes and toast the next morning. Thanks for the recipe!

The spices with this are strong. I ended up doubling the amount of pumpkin and cooking it in a crockpot on high for 3 hours, good, but a little goes a long way.

I love spices but this is very spicy. I would take this recipe with caution and add a little at a time until it meets your taste buds because you can’t take it away once it is added. It has way too much cloves. I will need to cook down more pumpkin to compensate for the amount of spices.

I think that it's a bit heavy on the ginger for my taste, and I'll probably  adjust the spice ratio in the future. I followed another user's suggestion about increasing the apple juice and I think that that really allowed it to cook longer to reduce and resulted in a smoother product with more depth - and probably also helped mellow it out a bit, counterbalancing the heaviness of the spices. Overall, though, I think it's a pretty great recipe! I haven't had pumpkin butter with a really pronounced spice flavor before, and I think that this one just makes it feel that much more like fall.

Used brown sugar instead of white, and roasted ground ginger,  but otherwise followed the recipe. Lovely taste & texture, but I still felt it could use something to brighten it up a bit, or make the taste sharper somehow, so I added a sprinkle of salt and about 1/4 tsp non-roasted ground ginger, and that pulled it all together. Enjoyed it on buttered toast, and look forward to more breakfasts with this in the coming days!

way too sweeet yet bitter, will try again, cutting the sugar, clover and ginger in half.  I added 8oz of cream cheese to tone down the strong flavors. I put it in toast, waffles and ice cream....so versatile,  so much potential!!!

Used our Halloween/Thanksgiving decoration pumpkins this weekend.  Made a great dessert and used the rest to make pumpkin butter.  I agree with another that there was too much ginger.  I will use less next time too.  Our grandson was here for the evening and he tasted it.  Said it tasted like pumpkin pie without the crust!  I sent a container home with him.  He was going to make pancakes.  I would bet he did that before he went to bed!

My son loves the pumpkin butter that is sold seasonally at the grocery store. In the past, I have bought every jar on the shelf, but it would not last until the following season. So I decided to try my hand at making some. I cut the sugar in half because 1 1/2 cups seemed excessive. I also used my slow cooker for the process. About 3 hours on low. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. The boy loved it so much, I ended up making a QUADRUPLE batch after he gobbled up the first attempt.

I made this and it turned out super great.  I cooked the pumpkin until tender in the over, split a small pumpkin in half face down on cooking sheet.

Substituted the processed white sugar with half amount of raw cane sugar and half amount of pure maple syrup.  It is a great dip for crisp apple slices as an alternative.

I've made this many many times. After each batch I started adjusting the spice amounts. To get that classic pumpkin pie taste I use 1.25 tsp ginger, 1.25 tsp cinnamon, tiny pinch clove, and .25 tsp nutmeg. much better result. I've also made this with apple cider and it's good too!

Delicious! The only thing I changed was I added brown sugar as one of the other commentors suggested. Very quick, easy, and makes the whole house smell like pumpkin pie (an added bonus!).

I made only a bit of modification. Other reviewers thought it was too sweet and too spicy so I added the spices in increments and a bit less sugar. I decided to make a double batch, but I only used the spices once. For the double batch, I used 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar. I will give some to my neighbors tomorrow for Christmas gifts.

I used fresh pumpkin - not sure if that made the difference. I found this recipe way too sweet. If I made it again, I would start with half the amount of sugar then add to taste. It was very spicy, which I like, but I'm not sure if others that I serve it to will. It was also very thick (again, not sure if this is because I strained my pumpkin when I cooked it). I had to add some extra cider and some water, and it is still very thick. Because of this, I didn't cook it very long. Not sure if I would try this one again.

The ginger comes through very strong, almost overpowering the pumpkin flavor. I would recommend cutting it to either one teaspoon or one half of a teaspoon.

This recipe is awesome!  It never fails.  The only drawback is that this cannot be canned and stored in the pantry, it has to be refrigerated, but that is not the fault of the recipe, that is just the recommendation  of the USDA guideline because of the viscosity and the acidity, or in this case the lack thereof.  The recipe makes four 1/2 pint jars.  This is always a huge hit at home and as a gift!

I made this as written except used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices called for.  At the end of 30 minutes, I tasted it to adjust the spices and found it way too sweet.  I "fixed" it by adding a 15 oz can of pumpkin puree and additional pumpkin pie spice and cooked It an additional 30 minutes.  The sweetness level is perfect.

This recipe is fantastic and makes great teacher or neighbor gifts when placed in mason jars and served with Anna's Gingersnap Cookies.  I would go easy on the cloves the next time I make this recipe, otherwise yum yum!

Great recipe!  Little less ginger, little less sugar and it is superb! Must eat it fresh or freeze it though.

I didn't have apple juice so I substituted a can of ginger ale. Excellent recipe. Thanks for the warning about bubbling and using a whisk to stir!

I was so tired of paying a lot of money for small jars of pumpkin butter, so decided to try this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and had it on my bread and in my oatmeal this morning. It was fabulous! Much better than what comes in the store and is so easy to make. I'll definately make this over and over and am even going to make it to can for gift giving throughout the holidays.

Wonderful! This was my first time trying pumpkin butter (silly me) and it was so good! I only made one change which was to use brown sugar and cut it way down to about 2 Tbsp. I put it on a pork tenderloin that I crusted with pumpkin pie spice, salt, and pepper. YUM!

I made a double batch and substituted Splenda for the sugar... it was too sweet, but yummy!  Next time I would cut back on the amount of Splenda, as I find it sweetens more than sugar.  Otherwise it turned out great!

I just made this and followed the advice of other reviewers by going with 1 cup apple cider, 1 cup light brown sugar, and 1 tsp ginger. The consistency is nice, sweetness good, but I am finding that the cinnamon flavor is overpowering and almost bitter. I don't know if the flavors will mellow as it cools but tasting it right after cooking while still warm, this is my initial impression. I would prefer to taste more pumpkin with hints of spices...next time I will also use half the cinnamon.

It was my first time this year making this and it was awesome! Very easy to make and must try. Cooking it takes a bit of time and you need to be careful because even at simmer, the pumpkin butter boils quite heavily. Easy to make, great on toast in the morning with your coffee.

I wanted something for pancakes on Christmas morning so I halved this recipie using  1 3/4 c of  fresh pumpkin (apx a 15 oz can) and cut the apple juice because the fresh pumpkin was wet enough on its own. The consistancy is great but it's a little too spicy for me. Next time I'll use less ginger and clove so the pumpkin flavor can come through a bit more.

5 stars for the flavor but man, how do you bring a solid mass to a boil?  My pumpkin puree was very very thick so I added about another 1/2 cup of apple juice.  Still so thick there was no "boiling" it.  I let it heat on the stove about 15 minutes and then put into jars.  It tastes just like pumpkin pie filling to me and very yummy on warm biscuits.

It was easy to make and tastes great, I'm looking for excuses to slather it on. I used a full cup of apple juice to make it a little more spreadable, and think next time I'll go a teeny bit easier on the cloves, but overall it's a great recipe. It made 10 4oz mason jars.

I will make this again, only next time I will have more of the appropriate jars on hand to store it in... Excellent taste and consistency. I didn't have all the spices, so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice - I think all of them were in it anyway. They will make nice holiday gifts for little cost.

My family really liked this recipe! The only change I did was I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the spices down a touch. My mom said it needed more spices which means I should have just followed the recipe exactly as is but my Aunt said it tasted fine and that she really liked it. I guess it all just depends on the person!! Great recipe though!!

My family really liked this recipe! The only change I did was I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the spices down a touch. My mom said it needed more spices which means I should have just followed the recipe exactly as is but my Aunt said it tasted fine and that she really liked it. I guess it all just depends on the person!! Great recipe though!!

Made a couple of batches to hand out to guests at our fall BBQ.  Must say, seemed a little bland which was surprising considering the spices used.  Previous reviewer may be right, brown sugar may help.  Probably won't make again.

Worked really well for the leftover pumpkin for the season. Baked the pumpkin and pulled out the pulp and followed the recipe. Yum, Yum!

Is pumpkin butter safe to can? I have found evidence that you should freeze or refrigerate. I do want to try this recipe but will give it as gifts to put in the fridge. UPATE: This freezes very nicely! I loved making it. I put it in the crock pot on low for about 6 hours. It made the house smell lover-ly. I used the Ball brand freezer containers (1/2 pint) and can't wait for the gift giving season. THANKS!

Very very good!  I did have to add a half cup of brown sugar as I didn't think it was quite sweet enough.  Very good on toast in the morning!

pretty good this tastes just like pumpkin pie on bread. It was a bit heavy on the spices tough.
