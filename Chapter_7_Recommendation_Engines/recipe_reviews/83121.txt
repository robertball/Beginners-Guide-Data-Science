I had high hopes for this and it didn't live up to them.  My husband and I love bruschetta, blt's, blue cheese and I thought what a great combination.  They were not good. I am pleased though that I only made them for us and not for company. The garlic was overpowering with the bacon. The basil flavor is lost due to the saltniness. I would also omit the salt as the cheese and bacon are salty enough.

Mmmm, this was good. I omitted the basil because the blue cheese I used was very strong, and I didn't think the flavors would work well together. I also use iceberg lettuce as that's what I had on hand. Tasty! Thanks, Pork Board!

Very good!  I served it with a bowl of the mix surrounded by the french bread crostini.

Very nice change-up from a BLT!  I made this with only one change - chopped big tomatoes from the farmers market instead of 3 Roma because they were what I had on hand and a garlic french bread.  Hubbie really enjoyed it.

This was really good!  I used small cubes of mozzarella cheese & omitted the lettuce (I forgot...it had been a long day); the only other change I made was to just lightly toast my bread and didn't brush it with olive oil because I was running seriously behind.  People either loved it or hated it, but it had bacon in it so how could you not like it?  ;)
