2.20.18  Had had some beef and gravy left from Rump Roast Au Jus (recipe on this site), so this was a good way to use up those leftovers.   Never used a recipe before for hash, and I typically don’t add either bell peppers or mushrooms, but I had both on hand, and I must say I liked them in the hash. I added salt, pepper, and some chopped parsley, along with just a drizzle of the leftover gravy . This is not rocket science folks, just simple, old-fashioned comfort food.

I used all the same ingredients and changed it a bit. I cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces and cooked in microwave on the auto-reheat setting.  I stir-fried the the other veggies for a few minutes, added the partially cooked potatoes and then the beef.  Because my leftover roast beef had been in the freezer for a while and was a little dry, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a package of gravy mix and let it heat thoroughly for 5 to 10 minutes.  So, it came out more like a beef stew than a hash, but I would make it again.  The family liked it.  Thanks for the idea.

What a great way of utilizing left over roast beef. Simple to make and vey tasty. I put my left over gravy in the mix as well. It needed a bit of salt at the table so next time I make it I’ll add a bit while cooking.

Delicious! I didn't have mushrooms and I added garlic cloves and cayenne pepper. My roast was cooked with banana peppers so it was perfect for this recipe! Yum, thank you!

Very good!  I did not precook the potatoes.  I coarsely chunked  the ingredients  and pulsed them in my processor, being careful not to  turn it into mush.  It sort of turned into flavored hash browns.  Was enjoyed by all.  Thank You

Added salt & pepper. Also, I had really large potatoes, so we ended up just occasionally stirring, went for hot not browned. Had some au jus leftover from the roast and added that as well. Yummy. Definitely will make again.

This was very tasty. I made some changes but only because I didn’t have all the ingredients on hand. I added leftover cooked basmati rice as well as a cup of gravy which kept the dish nice and moist. This is definitely an excellent recipe for leftover beef.

Had some left over smoked roast beef and came across this recipe.  We don’t do white potatoes, so substituted sweet potatoes and then used leeks instead of onions.  Came out really tasty and colorful.

We did not have an electric skillet so did it in a frying pan. We ended up stirring some as a necessity. It was excellent though. I did add salt and pepper as well.

Threw in some carrots, Worcestershire and green onions since I had neither mushrooms or green peppers. Fast and easy. Thanks will do again.
