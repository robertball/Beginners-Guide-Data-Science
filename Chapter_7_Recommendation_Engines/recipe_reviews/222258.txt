Tried these yesterday for the 4th of July. Excellent recipe. I like how you can control the sugar and fat content without losing the flavor. I thought the canned beans would get mushy with the cook time, seeing they are already cooked, but they stayed firm. I will make these as a regular side dish.

These are great and I'm not even a baked bean fan!  The only tweak I made was to use "Dave's BBQ Sauce" from here (super easy to make from pantry staples) and I do think that probably imparted a bit more flavor than a bottled sauce, so keep that in mind.  I may have used a bit more ham, too, simply because it's what I had left to use.  These received rave reviews from guests and multiple recipe requests.  This will become a rib dinner side staple at the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, wannabe chefette!

Not as overly sweet as many baked beans.  Green pepper is a great addition.

Ok, these are the best baked beans I've ever made! I've made these so many times, I almost don't need the recipe anymore?? The first time I made them with no changes. But I have slowly incorporated my favorites...first, I sauté the pepper and onion with bacon bits....oh yeah, that's right, I added bacon bits! And finally, to the sauce, I add a bit of molasses. I could eat this by itself as my main dish! So yummy!! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit with my family (including an 8 year old) and our friends! I substituted bacon for the ham and substituted 1 can of Northern beans for light kidney beans. We are making it again today for a family get together! Easy recipe to double for bigger crowds.

I first made this recipe for a potluck supper in January. Since then I've made it for more potlucks as well as family meals. I now get requests to bring this dish to potluck suppers. The only modifications I've made is to adjust the recipe to two other quantities - 4 cans and 6 cans of beans. Regardless of the batch size, there is never any leftovers.

Loved them.  This was such an easy recipe.  I threw in a ham hock as that's all I had.  I love a little smokey flavor so wasn't concerned.  Took them to a barbeque and they got rave reviews.  Because I had a busy day before the bbq, I chose to put them in the crock pot the night before and let them cook all night. Worked perfectly.

All I added is green peppers and bacon- delicious with or without the additions. Everyone raved about it. It's also a great way to use up some pantry items. Thanks for sharing- I will most definitely use this again.

We served a double batch of this today for a mother's day bbq and everyone seemed to like them. I didn't add any meat, used the full amount of brown sugar, used regular bulls eye BBQ sauce, used a half of a large green and yellow bell pepper and one huge onion for the double batch.  I really can't imagine adding more veggies. Because of time, I cooked these for close to 3 hrs on high then transferred to a casserole dish and baked for 35 minutes at 350. We will have again.

Modified it for vegetarians (no ham) and added some black beans instead. It was really delicous.

I made this with my favorite BBQ sauce, and 2 cans of white cannelloni  beans with 2 cans of navy beans because that is what I had on hand.  The sauce didn't seam to cover the beans so I doubled the sauce and it was perfect for us.  I also used chopped bacon and fried it with the onion and bell pepper as others suggested.  This is simple, tasty, and will be made again.

This was delicious. I altered just to have a little extra for the amount of people I was serving. I added a tablespoon of chopped fresh garlic too. They were scraping the bottom of the pan. Everyone seemed very happy. Great text and flavorful recipe!

I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and these turned out a bit too sweet for my taste. I plan to try them again with a more spicy than sweet BBQ sauce.

It’s a easy recipe. One change I made is that I sautéed the onions in butter until they softened then put them in. Also I found that these beans were actually better the next day. So I would recommend making it in advance and then hearing them up again in the crockpot.

I made these for a potluck at work and chose this recipe simply because it’s easy...and impossible to mess up.  They are GOOD! So good, in fact, that every time we have a meal at work-my coworkers beg me to make them.  Doubled the recipe for a larger crowd, didn’t change a thing.  They’re awesome!

I followed the recipe except I used hickory smoked and brown sugar bbq sauce therefore I omitted the brown sugar. Otherwise I added everything else and cooked it on low for eight hours. Everyone thought it was made made with dry beans instead of canned and they all enjoyed it very much.

These are the BEST baked beans I've ever had! Even my kids had 2nd's and 3rd's.  I took these to a community meal at my church, and everyone just raved about them! And they are so easy to make. I didn't have any ham on hand, so I used about 1/3 lb of bacon and sauteed it together with the onion before adding it to the beans. I also didn't have any hickory flavored BBQ sauce so I just used regular and added about a tsp of liquid smoke. Delicious! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I will never buy canned baked or pork and beans again!

I presoaked my beans and it took 10 hours the first day on low and another 8 hours the following day and the beans were still crunchy.  Very sweet and inedible.  I tossed them out.

These are the only baked beans I will eat now. No more canned or other homemade recipes. They are addicting!

Everyone loved it!
I used extra red onion since I don't like green peppers and left them out. I used dark brown sugar. Recipe doubles easily.
I was a little worried it would be too thick going so long in the crock pot, but they came out perfect.

Loved this. I did substitute crumbled bacon for ham and Dijon mustard for dry mustard. It was a big hit with the whole family.

Fantastic and easy slow cooker baked beans!  Everyone at our cookout loved them!  I will definitely make them again.  The only thing I'd do differently is to double the recipe!

I made these for 2 graduation parties and they were amazing!  I changed the recipe a little and people were asking all night how I made them!!  I used bacon instead of ham, and cooked it w/the onion first before adding to the bean mixture.  I didn't use any green peppers, and used white kidney beans and northern beans.  I tripled the recipe, cooked on low for 8 hrs in my slow cooker and they were sooo yummy!!  Will use this again and again :):)

I prefer to cook with dried beans and used a 1 1/2 cup mixture of dried great northern and cannellini beans for this recipe (using the quick soak method). I was pressed for time so cooked in the crock pot on high instead of low for about 6 hours.

This was a very simple recipe that had good flavor and was a nice accompaniment to roast chicken. If I made it again, though, I would take the time to saute the onion before adding it to the recipe. Even though my beans cooked for 8 hours, the onion was still quite crunchy. I used pancetta instead of ham, left out the bell pepper, and added more barbecue sauce, ketchup, and an extra dash of mustard and brown sugar since I like a saucier bean.

I followed the directions, doubling the batch.  After 6 hours it still looked too runny, and not anything like the picture.  I scooped it all out and put it in a casserole dish, leaving behind some liquid.  I put mixed in the bacon, and 2 teaspoons worchestire and baked at 350 uncovered for 30 minutes.  Took out, covered in foil until ready to serve.....now they looked like a nice thick backed bean dish.  The taste was great, though.  I did use a mixture of northern, black and red beans for visual interest.

These beans were a huge hit.  I used cannelini beans that absorbed the flavorings just beautifully.  Genius recipe!

I am a big fan for cooking with ingredients you already have. This recipe is heavily dependent on the barbecue sauce that you choose to use. Make sure it is a barbecue sauce that you really love. How much brown sugar you use really depends on how sweet the BBQ sauce is that you use. I used 1 tablespoon mustard instead of the dry mustard. I did not use the green peppers because I did not have any. I used chopped cooked bacon instead of ham because that is what I had. I took it to a birthday party and it went very fast I didn't even get any myself . I take that as a very good sign! I will definitely use this recipe again!

Excellent baked beans. We doubled the ketchup and BBQ sauce and didn't drain the beans to give it some extra liquid. Also we only baked it on low for 6 hours and it was plenty thick, then left it on warm until dinner time.

This was a pretty good recipe but it was super sweet. I added some liquid smoke to mellow the sweetness some. It seemed to work.

Great tasting beans and easy as well.  I used 4 or 5 slices of diced bacon and regular bbq sauce but next time I'll definitely use a hickory smoked sauce as I wanted a bit of smoke flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe wannabe chefette!

Solid recipe for a tasty no-fuss side dish to accompany your next barbecue. I prefer a little molasses flavor in my beans, but this recipe gives a tangy treat to the taste buds to nicely complement the sweet. You really can't go wrong with this recipe! Easily 4 + stars!
