This went over very well with my family, even the picky eaters.  Added oregano, red pepper flakes, sage, basil, and parsley.  Upped bouillon to 3 cubes and garlic to 3 tsp.  This makes a LOT of soup, had enough to feed 3 of us, save at least another meal's worth for leftovers in fridge, and freeze another meal's worth as well.

I loved this recipe. I am from Massachusetts and we used to have this frequently. It is very filling and is absolutely delicious. It goes great with some crusty Italian bread. Use any small pasta you have on hand.

This soup was wonderful!  Easy to make, economical and the whole family loved it!  I subbed beef broth for the water and bouillon, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, lizchedid!

I am originally from New England, and remember attending the Venus de Milo for functions years ago.  This soup was legendary in the area, and very much requested.  You won't regret making it at all!  It is wholesome and very tasty, even if you use ground turkey in place of the ground beef.  Additionally, if you sprinkle some parmesean cheese on it before serving, impossibly it becomes even tastier!

I'm not usually a review writer but I feel this recipe is so good that it could use a little extra publicity!  I found it when I was looking for a good/quick/easy winter recipe to use up the orzo that had been sitting in the cabinet for a while.  Typically I aim for recipes with more reviews but since all the other reviewers raved about it and I happened to have almost all of the ingredients, I decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  The first time I made the recipe, I followed it exactly and it was fantastic!  I made it a second time tonight (perfect for freak April snowstorms in CO), but instead of using beef, I substituted homemade, ground, game sausage.  It really made a great soup truly outstanding! As a bonus, the leftovers are really good too.  I plan on freezing some this time around so I'm curious to see how it tastes after that considering it has pasta in it.   But seeing as how this recipe makes SO much soup, I don't want any to go to waste once the weather warms back up by the end of the week! 

Usually with this type of recipe I would take a lot of liberty, especially in the spice department, but with this one I think it's pretty perfect the way it is!  It's got to be something about the combo of the onion soup mix and bouillon gives that gives this recipe a little of that je ne sais quoi factor! Bon Appetite!

At first I thought I added too much water...definitely thickened up after cooking. I did use ground chicken instead of beef.
I very much enjoyed this soup, especially with a liberal dose of red pepper. Gave it only 4 stars because my daughter did not like it. Dad said it "was good."

My husband and daughter loved it!  Easy, economical and delicious recipe.  I used the entire 6 oz of tomato paste because I don't like little bits of leftover stuff, also used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef because that's how mine is packaged.  We will use this recipe a lot in the winter!

Let me first start off by saying this soup was delicious. I have had this version of Venus de Milo soup more times than I can count. So the only change I will make next time is use less crushed tomatoes or omit the tomato paste. The end product had a very potent tomato flavor it almost took away from the rest of the soup. I omitted the mushrooms as well even though the original Venus soup has it.

This is a consistent family pleaser. I use roasted chicken instead of ground beef and it’s delicious.

I was recently at the Venus for the first time for a lunch and show. I didn't get a chance to purchase the soup there, but this recipe intrigued me. I halved it, and it still makes a lot. I didn't have orzo on hand so I subbed brown basmati rice. Per some of the reviewers, the soup has mushrooms in it, so I did add some along with the onions and garlic. Also had it with some parmesan cheese and wheat French bread and had it a day after I made it for better flavor.  A good, hearty soup.

Fantastic soup.  I followed the recipe the first time and it was great!  The second time I used 1Qt each home made chicken and beef stock in place of the bouillon and water, added 3 more bay leaves,  2 tbs of Worcestershire sauce, some red pepper flake and a full carton of fresh sliced mushrooms.  It was even better, but no matter how you slice it this is a great recipe!

My goodness this is a delicious soup. I had everything on hand so it went together really fast.  I subbed tortellini for the orzo just for grandkids fun.  They gobbled it down!
