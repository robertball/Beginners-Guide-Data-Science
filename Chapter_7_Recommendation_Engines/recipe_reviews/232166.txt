This is an awesome recipe for strawberry shortcake! In my family, the shortcake is always a biscuit type,  and nothing but real whipped cream will do. My only other comment has to do with the directions. My Mississippi mama who taught me to make biscuits always said "the less you handle the dough, the better your biscuits will be. And NEVER knead no matter what the recipe says." I've always followed that hint, use White Lily flour, and make biscuits that my family devours. We loved this shortcake -- thank you so much for sharing!

Happy to be the first one to rate this recipe!  Was making a dessert for a diabetic friend and substituted 1 tblsp of Stevia for sugar in cake mix and 1/4 cup of stevia for strawberries (otherwise too sweet).  Used (I pretty much always use honey for my whipped cream) Tupelo Honey (safe for people watching their sugar) and placed cakes in ramekins for easy transport.  This is an awesome shortcake recipe (despite the substitutions), I'll try it using sugar next time and I know it will be even better!  Thanks Divinity!

4 hrs later - neighbors LOVED this dessert...we were already stuffed after a delicious steak dinner YET they devoured it!  (I was smiling!)

Came out great. Did not look as crumbly as I thought it would when I added the butter, but I don't think it mattered, tasted delicious. I like that they weren't real sweet, because once the berries were on, it was a nice balance.

I have made this at least a half dozen times & got RAVES every time.  It's just baking powder biscuits made with real butter & cream but what a taste difference from regular biscuits.  Many in the family comment how much better it tastes than angel food cake because it's not as sweet yet much richer & really lets the taste of the strawberries shine.

This recipe makes really good biscuits but I wanted something more cakey. I wish the description mentioned that or the picture was better at portraying it. I gave it a 4 because it you are looking for more of a biscuit recipe this is great.

Very disappointed. I've made this twice & had the same results both times. The shortcakes do not rise very much at all. I follow the directions to the "T" & have had identical results. Again, disappointing......

The best. I've tried so many recipes for shortcakes, this is simply the best. Had an abundance of strawberries this year and have made this recipe several times already. Just  put the dry ingredients in my food processor, mix and add the butter. When it is crumbly, I pour in the cream until it is the right consistency and knead then roll it out. Couldn't be easier, and they bake up light and flaky!! Thank you  for sharing.

I don't know if it was the weather or my oven, but my shortcakes didn't rise very well however they taste fantastic!! I also added blueberries along with the strawberries and fresh whipped cream. I will definitely try this again!

Followed the recipe with one exception. My family traditionally mash the berries, which I did.  Turned out fabulous!

Made this today. I used milk instead of heavy cream, as I didn't have any. I also added the vanilla to the dough before baking. Very yummy! I will definitely make it again!
