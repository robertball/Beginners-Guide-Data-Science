Great recipe!  However I like to play around with things and found that a couple minor changes resulted in the best turkey I have ever eaten (my family agrees).  The sweetness was a welcome change and especially great since my son and my husband both have a huge sweet tooth.  I did add some brown sugar to the maple-butter glaze.  Also, I had a large turkey injector left from thanksgiving and made my own injector butter mixture.  I melted two sticks of butter, added 1/2C apple cider, 1/4C maple syrup and 1/4C brown sugar.  heated over low-med heat until butter was melted and sugar was dissolved then injected all of the mixture into the turkey.  Oh man, it was good!  Oh, and for easy suffing, just buy the boxed stuff and chop up a sweet apple (i use gala) and thaw some frozen cranberries.  Add the fruit to the stuffing when you prepare it, then stuff it all into the bird.  So good, and very easy.

This is by far, the absolute best turkey recipe I have ever made! Everyone loved it for Thanksgiving! I used a little more maple syrup, but it didn't throw anything off. Gravy is to die for!!! The best I've ever had! I've never known a turkey to come out so juicy and perfect! Even stuffy friends who would've rathered "went out for Thanksgiving" (hey! we live in NYC, whadda ya want?) were thoroughly delighted and impressed! I highly suggest to anyone who plans on making a turkey for the holidays to make this! Bon Appeite!

This was a delicious turkey. A nice change from the traditional flavor. I stuffed this with the "Awesome Sausage Apple and Cranberry Stuffing" from this site and this made the best Turkey and stuffing I've ever eaten. I'll be making it again.

This recipe was tremendous.  The turkey turned out juicy and succulent.  The only thing I did differently was to stuff a bulb of garlic and some sprigs of rosemary in the turkey cavity before roasting. The gravy was some of the best I've ever tasted.

This is an amazing recipe.  I brined my turkey first then used the apple/maple/butter from this recipe to smother it in before putting in the oven.  BTW, for those not living in USA apple cider is apple juice NOT apple cider vinegar! I didn't put veges in tray with turkey but did use the liquid at the end of cooking to make gravy - so delicious. Thanks.

This turkey turned out great.  It was moist and the mixture you baste with is good.  The only problem I had was with the veggies you put beside the turkey in the roaster--they dried out, as did the stock I put in with them.  I had to throw it all out.  Fortunately, I was able to use the rest of the marinade in my turkey gravy and it was the best gravy I've ever made.

Very moist! My family says it's the best tasting Turkey they have ever had.  I did not change a thing with the recipe.  Delicious.

This was my first time using a recipe to make my Turkey... Normally I just do what I know, don't have a set recipe I just cook how my mother showed me...lol  BUT I have to say that this turned out GREAT!!  Everyone that came over this year for Thanksgiving loved it, and said that it was full of flavor and very juicy... I also used the cranberry, sausage and apple stuffing which also got two thumbs up!

2 cups of apple cider vinegar is way too much.  The odor was so pungent that we had to open all of the windows. I would make it again but with much less of it.

I loved this recipe! We used an injector to get more of the flavor in and baked it in a turkey bag. It was so moist and the flavor was amazing!

This made an excellent bird! It was my first turkey ever and I got rave reviews from my guests at Thanksgiving. In fact, from the traditional turkey roasters, I got compliments that this was their best turkey ever. Quite good! I was afraid it wouldn't turn out, but boy did it ever! The gravy was outstanding as well!

I found that this won't do much for your turkey but gives the gravy a different twist. When carving the turkey up, I tried a piece without anything added and really didn't notice the difference I was expecting. I can't say that I would go to all this work next year, I really wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be. The Cranbeery,sausage and apple stuffing yes, this no.

A different twist on the typical Roast Turkey. The taste was very good, the meat was extremely moist which was very nice.  The important part of this recipe to definitely cook down the vinegar and syrup until it reaches the 1/2 cup or it will not solidify completely making it more liquidy than a butter consistency when you rub it under the skin and on top.

Turkey turned out great and definitely make the gravy.  it was SO good.  I made a roux of flour and butter and just added the drained drippings to that.  Everyone loved it. The carcass also made a fantastic turkey soup.

The gravy was delicious and the apple maple rub made the turkey tender and moist although I didn't taste it too much in the turkey itself.  Be sure to cover the turkey with aluminum foil like the recipe says... I forgot and it burnt on top.  The only change I made was to use 1 cup of apple juice instead of cider because I can't find apple cider here!  (Quebec, Canada)

This was my first time making thanksgiving dinner & I decided to try this recipe for all the great reviews! The only changes I made was not using thyme & marjoram instead using a little salt, pepper & garlic powder. I also had to add a can of beer over the turkey (my mom always does this no matter what recipe she uses & it makes the bird tender) I used Sam Adam Oktoberfest, & I'm glad I added it cause I wouldn't of had anywhere close enough drippings to make gravy! I stuffed the turkey with all the veggies including the lemon, why waste it only for the peel?!! And also put some garlic heads in there! We didn't eat the veggies but rather just used them for flavoring the drippings. Very good turkey :-)

This was my first time making thanksgiving dinner & I decided to try this recipe for all the great reviews! The only changes I made was not using thyme & marjoram instead using a little salt, pepper & garlic powder. I also had to add a can of beer over the turkey (my mom always does this no matter what recipe she uses & it makes the bird tender) I used Sam Adam Oktoberfest, & I'm glad I added it cause I wouldn't of had anywhere close enough drippings to make gravy! I stuffed the turkey with all the veggies including the lemon, why waste it only for the peel?!! And also put some garlic heads in there! We didn't eat the veggies but rather just used them for flavoring the drippings. Very good turkey :-)

This turkey was very tasty, moist and flavorful. I tried it before Thanksgiving to see if I wanted to change my regular recipe. While it was good, it was a little sweet for me. I prefer a more savory flavor to my gravy though. Thanks for a great recipe, I will certainly use it again, just not for the big day this year.

Without a doubt the best turkey I've ever made!!  And I've made a lot of turkeys!  Skin was super crispy & meat was soooo moist.  Yum!  This was the first time I've brined & would highly recommend it.  Makes a huge difference.  I was worried that the gravy would be too sweet cuz we like it on our mashed potatoes, but it wasn't.  It was savory.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  Will make it this way every year.

This was my first turkey I made.  I brined the turkey and then used this recipe.  It was FANTASTIC.  I forgot to save some of the butter for the gravy, and I made the gravy with a roux and it came out FABULOUS.  It was the best gravy I ever had.  Took the advice for the cranberry and apple sausage stuffing.  My first Thanksgiving was a hit.  Thank you for making it so easy.  Sorry for not posting sooner!

Made my first thanksgiving dinner a SMASHING success.  Friends are still raving about it (10 months later).  This year I'm making Christmas dinner for our families, guess what I'll be making.  Definately use the Cranberry, sausage and apple stuffing.  I cooked half inside the bird and half outside.  Makes for an interesting contrast.

I have to first off say that this was my first time making a turkey.  Between the flavorful marinade in this recipe, brining the turkey, and the way I cooked it (breast side down and no foil), this was the most moist and flavorful turkey I have ever eaten anywhere!  I pretty much went by the ingredients exactly except I didn't use brandy and I only had margarine instead of butter.  Next time I will make sure to use butter because the sauce didn't set up to well and was a little liquid-y, so when rubbing on the turkey it wanted to drip off.  I also made a solution of apple cider and maple syrup, boiled it down, and used a flavor injector to inject a little more flavor into the meat.  I dont think it was really necessary but I thought what the hay, more flavor is always good!  Next time I wont do that though, because between that and the butter mixture, the gravy was a little sweeter than it should of been.  But it was still excellent!  Thanks for this great flavorful recipe!  When I have the chance at making a turkey again I will for sure use this recipe!

This will be the 3rd year that I will making this recipe.  I "suggested" trying another turkey and my husband said no.  He wanted the "maple" turkey.  I used this recipe when I made my first turkey and it is a little work, but so worth it.  This year I will try brining my turkey first... to see if it helps with the juicyness.

I used this recipe the past two Thanksgivings, and just finished the butter to use tomorrow morning!  This recipe makes for an incredibly moist and tender bird.  I have to agree with others that the butter mixture doesn't flavor the meat much.  But those drippings make the best gravy ever!!!  My husband talks about the gravy year round, so I've even made a version of it in the crockpot with a frozen turkey breast.

I need to comment on a few other reviews.  This recipe calls for apple cider, not apple cider vinegar.  I think that might explain their results and therefore lower ratings.

I used this recipe the past two Thanksgivings, and just finished the butter to use tomorrow morning!  This recipe makes for an incredibly moist and tender bird.  I have to agree with others that the butter mixture doesn't flavor the meat much.  But those drippings make the best gravy ever!!!  My husband talks about the gravy year round, so I've even made a version of it in the crockpot with a frozen turkey breast.

I need to comment on a few other reviews.  This recipe calls for apple cider, not apple cider vinegar.  I think that might explain their results and therefore lower ratings.

Best gravy I've ever had!  This recipe is fantastic.  I made the syrup/butter the night before and it remained pretty runny.  The turkey stayed moist - I use an oven bag so the turkey itself was good but not noticeably more moist than normal.  However the gravy was amazing and we all wanted to drink it!!!  I didn't remove the veggies at the end, just some of the fat and made the gravy right in the roaster.  Didn't add more thyme and forgot the bay leaf but it was still terrific.  Loved the cooked vegetables in it.  Also I chopped up one apple and the leftover lemon from zesting and put inside the turkey for some extra flavor.  Definitely a winner!

Prepared this recipe twice, the first time prepared as directed and the turkey browned too quickly. The second time I left the foil on the whole time and it browned beautifully. Both times the turkey and gravy tasted fantastic. Many comments on how juicy it was. I'll be using it again next Turkey time.

This recipe was very good and will be used a staple foundation for our holiday turkeys.  We used our Weber grill instead of an oven and cooked this 12 lb bird at indirect medium for just under 3 hours.  We basted hourly and it turned out awesome.  We will use this recipe for years to come.

I'm trying to figure out how this got to be a 5-star recipe.  This turkey was very average.  I honestly couldn't taste much of the apple/maple flavor in the finished product.  This was quite a bit of work for such mediocre results.  Definitely not the stunning results that I was hoping for.  Guess I'll keep looking.

I know I'm out of sync with everyone else but I think I'll go back to my tried and true turkey recipe for Christmas.  This was OK but not what we were expecting.  It was jucy and sweet, but neither my husband or myself really enjoyed a "sweet" gravy on our mashed potatoes.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year in hopes to impress our new German friends here in Germany that has never had an "American Thankgiving".  They were very impressed and it the most moist turkey I have ever made.  I am thinking of just having turkey more than once a year now.

I just made this for Thanksgiving and everything tasted good except the gravy, which was very oily and runny.  The vegetables that are cooked with the turkey soaked up the sweetness of the maple syrup / apple cider and were very tasty and moist.  If I were to make this again, I probably will use a different gravy recipe.

My first attempt at preparing the WHOLE Thanksgiving meal. What a success! The sweet maple flavor married beautifully with the comforting thymemarjoram - my house smelled wonderful for days! Being able to prepare butter portion of the recipe in advance helped a lot. I have returned the next year to repeat this amazing recipe!! Thank you so much to the contributor!!!

Good recipe. This was a trial run last week for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. I had never thought of roasting the vegetables with the turkey. But, it makes perfect sense, and it worked very well. There was no problem with the maple butter separating. . . I think the key is making sure to cook the syrup/cider mixture for the full time (making sure it fully reduces).  I removed the foil for the last 15 minutes (or so) of cooking, and this gave the bird the coveted red-brown, glistening skin. It was beautiful. The gravy that this recipe made wasn't a big hit. It wasn't terrible, but I don't think we can be sold on the sweetness, albeit slight.  I may have to commit the unpardonable and serve store-bought. . .  at any rate, I will definitely be using this recipe for Thanksgiving in a couple of weeks.
