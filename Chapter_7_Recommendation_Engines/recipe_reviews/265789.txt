Considering that the rolls are sweet, as is the honey mustard, the jam, not to mention most hams are sugar cured, I do not see why any more sugar would be good for this recipe. I would most likely even reduce the jam, or substitute fresh berries, and then as a side to accompany this dish, rather than add them to the sandwich.

These turned out really good. After reading over the recipe I knew I was going to make one change to suit us. I completely left out the sugar and I'm glad I did. Between the rolls, jam, and honey mustard these were plenty sweet. You don't need the sugar in my opinion. I found Hawaiian mini hoagie bread rolls and they worked good for this too. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.
