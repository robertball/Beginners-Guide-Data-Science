Used to make something like this in Texas but used a buncha' cheap vodka; and in addition to the listed fruits also used peaches pineapple watermelon etc. Let it sit in the 'fridge for about four days. The liquid was potent but the fruit was LETHAL!

We used to make this in college (eons ago) and also called it "Hunch Punch." I think that "hunch" came from the inevitable posture the consumer took later in the evening. I also recall the recipe being somewhat fluid (no pun intended) and consisting of whatever we could afford- the grain alcohol being a constant. The remnants we used as a solvent for removing stubborn road tar from the underside and wheel wells of our cars.

We used to make something like this but we called it Hunch Punch. We used a big ice cooler. Pour in PGA and then put any type of fruit you like in. Chunck pinneapples are the best. Let the fruit set overnight then we added Hawian Punch. Put a bag of ice still in the bag to keep cold.

Made this several times in Senior year High School and College years. Quick version is OK but if you want to take it up a notch make it a week or two early. Put in a cool dark place in a closed glass container I used several gallon Glass jars. Shake it up a few times during the week. Put in cooler or bowl to serve ice is your call but I left it clean and had ice in bucket next to cooler. Also used Consentrated Juice mix instead of powders and a little water. If not into cutting fruit dump in cans of already chopped or sliced fruit juice and all. Be warned a few glasses will knock you down! A bowl of the fruit will also remove most inhibitions!! Pinapples and apples really soak this up! Also be warned it stains the cooler and any clothing it hits!!
