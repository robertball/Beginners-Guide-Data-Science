I bought the wrong ingredients at the supermarket and went for the pumpkin pie mix, versus canned pumpkin that the better rated recipes on this site called for.  So, after reading the poor reviews for this pumkin pie, I pre-cautiously made a few changes and was pleased with the results.  I added an extra egg, about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and some extra cloves and nutmeg to taste.  Because this recipe was so quick and easy, I had some extra time and used a mini, oak leaf-shaped cookie cutter and decorated the edges of the pie crust with the little leaves.  I baked the pie, as directed, in a deep dish ceramic pie plate and covered the outer crust with foil for the entire baking time.  The pie came out beautiful and the crust cooked perfectly.  Not sure what all the fuss was about. . .this tasted just as good as a store bought and looked pretty on the table.  P.S.  the cookie cutters are available at IParty for .99 cents!

I have used this recipe twice and both times have created a desert my family loves!  For an even quicker time, I have used Pillsbury refrigerator pie shells.  What a timesaver.

My previous rating was incorrect. I was tinking it was the original recipe that came on the canned pumpkin. Not the premixed pie mix. I went ahead and tried this one and it did not come out very well at all. The pie was not a good color (deep orange?) and the flavor was not up to par. And the can only mad one deepdish pie. Don't waste your money. Get the canned pumpkin and use the recipe that is on the Libbys can.

I was very disappointed with this one.  There was way too much batter so some went to waste.  I overfilled the deep dish pie crust so it overflowed and the edges of the crust burned.  The pie never set up and it ended up in the garbage.  Maybe it would have turned out better if I had used 2 regular (not deep dish) crusts.  Maybe I'll try it again next year.

This recipe is soooo convenient.. and pretty good, too. A made from scratch version might be a bit more tasty, but in a pinch, this is good pie and less fuss.

It was ok, it took too long to cook. I don't think I would attempt it again.

I baked this for today's Thanksgiving dinner. I used the  Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie Mix and added a 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie mix, and used 1/2&1/2 instead of evaporated milk, as it was all I had on hand, I also added the two beaten eggs as the recipe called for and back according to the direction on the can of pie filling. The texture of this pie turned out beautifully. Mine did not crack at all and smelled wonderful. I did not have a slice, but everyone who did said it was good; definitely quick and better than store bought.

my crust burned, and i followed the directions....the filling tastes okay though. I prefer a more homemade recipe, but in a rush this is good. Why did my crust burn? hmmmmm

It did take a bit longer to cook (about 10 min. more) and the texture is slightly softer than the traditional Libby's pure pumpkin recipe, but the flavor is just as delicious.  I used a Mrs. Smith's frozen piecrust, so I was able to put this pie together fast.  I baked it just last night, and I think there may be only one slice left in the fridge, that's how good it is!

Perfect pie to cook with little ones...teaches measurements and is very easy to execute! The big payoff with my kids (3 and 5) tasty and nutritious!!  Add the Reddy Whip spray can and you have an instant family favorite!
