I made this last night following the rcipe exact and no matter how long I let it sit it never firmed up, even after placing in the fridge. It has a wonderful taste but I can only eat the top and bottom,there is no gooey middle. I do not know what happened.

I wanted to make individual pies, so cut my pie crust to fit into a muffin tin.  I mixed the recipe the same and only changed the cooking time.  My oven cooks hot so I cooked 4 minutes at 450 then about 13 at 325.  I would flour the bottom of the pie crust before placing in the muffin tin so it is easier to get out...I didn't do this and they are coming out a little rough looking but they taste great!

This is the recipe I have been using for years I use white sugar and dark karo it was my grandmothers recipe but you cook it at 375 for 45 minutes and that will take care of the center of the pie. You might have to put the foil ring on the crust. Enjoy with ice cream .

I also have never baked in my life, this recipe was very easy to follow.  However; like the other comment, it never firmed up.  My husband and boys did not mind, it was gone in no time.

I baked this pie with a flakey butter pie crust for my in-laws. I was out of light Karo so I used dark karo. Hands down,  it was the best we've ever made or tasted. Now I live in southeast Texas home of southern pecan pies so I've had many. It was perfect.

I made this pie following the directions exactly. It came out great. With about 15 minutes left in the cooking time, I covered the pie crust around the edge with foil as it was starting to get a little dark. The family loved it and suggested  that it I had purchased it instead of making it myself. I'll be making this again.
