We have been making this alfredo sauce for about two years, and I wanted to share a hint.  If you sift a little bit of cornstarch into your shredded cheese, and squeeze some fresh lemon juice into the sauce while you are adding your cheese, it will become nice and creamy. We love this recipe, but we also change it a little by adding freshly minced garlic and some asiago along with the romano and parmesan. This stuff is so good we dip our bread into it!

This sauce was a big hit at a dinner party I had, but I did make a few changes. I minced some garlic and sautéed it in the butter on low heat before adding the cream. TIP: if you're concerned the sauce is too soupy, just continue to slowly stir the sauce (for about ten minutes) on low heat after adding the cheese - it will thicken up to perfection. Before adding the sauce to the pasta (along with scallops, shrimp and broccoli) I was a bit concerned about the flavor. I had tasted the sauce from the pan and it was much too salty. I had only added a dash of garlic salt and a dash of table salt, so I couldn't figure what I might have done wrong. My only thought was that I neglected to use unsalted butter, but the recipe hadn't specified. Anyhow, once combined with the pasta, etc., the sauce tasted perfect. I'm sure much of the salty flavor was a result of the cheese, but you can't go wrong with Romano and Parmesan. Next time I will mince/sauté a bit more garlic and I will hold off on the garlic/table salt. I adjusted the servings to feed 12 people, which required 4 sticks of butter. Maybe next time I'll use 2 unsalted and 2 salted sticks, but as I said, once combined with the pasta, the sauce tasted wonderful.

i chose this recipe because it had the best reviews.  and it really is very very good.  i scaled down the recipe to 4 servings, but beware because the pasta it calls for is WAY too much, especially if you like a lot of sauce.  my recommendation is to make the sauce according to this recipe's scale but make the amount of pasta according to the pasta box/label.  i also love garlic in my alfredo so i minced about 5 cloves of garlic and added it to the sauce.  also make sure that you are watching the sauce at all times and stirring often because the sauce tends to stick at the bottom and curdle there.  also added chicken strips sauteed in butter and lawry's garlic salt, which added the saltiness the dish needed, since i made the sauce a little more on the bland side.   i made it once with margarine and half and half to skim calories but it does not turn out that well.  it tends to congeal and is not as creamy or thick so if you're looking to skim calories, this is not the recipe to do it with. my husband who is obsessed with alfredo thinks it is the best he's ever had.  we love alfredo and thought olive garden had the best, but now we will be making this at home.  very simple recipe, and love that all the ingredients are so accessible, and doesn't require an egg!

I am writing a review of my own recipe in response to some of the reviews...

...So that everyone knows, this is an authentic Italian (Olive Garden is NOT Italian) recipe for Fettuccine Alfredo, therefore, it doesn't have garlic. Garlic is an American addition to the dish. I didn't leave it out on accident, nor am I preparing the dish incorrectly.

Thank you for all of the positive feedback!!

Erin

Pretty good - very similar to Olive Garden. Best thing besides taste is that this recipe has no egg in it!

Good even without the parmesean added at the end.

If you have leftovers and the butter separates, add more cream before heating and stir after heating - it will be just like when it was fresh. 

Be careful of this stuff though - sauce is extremely fattening!!! Great as a once in a while treat.

You couldn't get it any more correct, this is the "method", can't bring myself to call it a recipe since it was a spur of the moment concoction of Alfredo's of Rome.  My husband and I go every April and when we did this last year we were staying just a few feet from this city's icon, so of course we went and had their signature dish. This is it!  They do however, rub a cut garlic bulb inside the pasta bowl just like a good Ceasar salad. Remember to reserve at least a 1/2 cup of your pasta water to thin the sauce before serving, it thickens rapidly.

True to its claim! It really is to die for. I used some chopped fresh basil from my garden and added more Parmesan and Romano. This sauce is wonderful over Penne Rigate with shrimp, scallops and crab! My company loved it. They said better than their favorite seafood restaurant!

This is excellent!  Very rich and delicious.  I've subbed more parmesan for the romano, and it's just as good.  I've even made it once accidentally with half-and-half, and it still turned out great and was even re-heatable.  Overall, a great recipe, even to our picky Italian family!

Very buttery!  I think half the butter would have worked fine.  But I am also a picky alfredo sauce eater, so others may think it was wonderful.

Be careful! This recipe calls for 3/4 of a PINT (1.5 cups) of heavy cream, not 3/4 of a CUP, which is what I thought. I had to add 1/2 cup of Half & Half because I didn't have any extra heavy cream. I took another reviewer's advice and added the lemon juice. Mine didn't thicken up but maybe that was the Half & Half or maybe I didn't cook it long enough (I get impatient), but it did taste really good. It was very salty (I used salted butter). I might put a little less salt in next time, and definitely the correct amount of cream. Overall, I thought it was really good for my first go round with alfredo (which I love). Thanks for the recipe, Erinmarie. I will definitely make again!

Great recipe!! Before adding the cheese, I brought the cream to a boil and then reduced the heat to low. After adding the cheese, I heated for about 20 mins. This will help it to thicken. I added chopped chicken, tomatoes, green onions, and sprinkled a little cajun spice on top and served it with garlic bread. My family loved it!!!

Do not listen to the haters.  Also, if you think it is expensive to make, don't make it, simple as that!  This is my Italian mother's recipe and the only one I make.  Also, don't squeak on the butter.  Make the recipe people!  I like to add a bit of fresh grated nutmeg in mine.  Erinmarie, keep on making this and do not listen to anyone else.

I have made this a few times since discovering it a couple of months ago, and it is awesome! I made one little change this last time I cooked it. I added some minced garlic but still did the garlic salt. I swear it tasted just like Olive Garden or at least pretty darn close. I am a beginner cook and this recipe is so simple, there is really no messing it up. I also used the whole pint of cream because I didn't want to leave that little bit in there and have it go to waste, plus I like a little extra sauce. I also cooked some chicken and tossed it in when I was coating the noodles. Now when I get a craving for Olive Garden I can save a good $50-$60 dollars (family of 5!), and make this at home for a fraction of the price!!! So glad I found this recipe!

This sauce was not that great.  It called for some pricey ingredients and wasn't worth it.  I have many store bought jars of alfredo sauce that tasted better than this.  Don't waste your time

WOW- 5 stars for a terrific base recipe!  My changes: I only used 3/4 cup butter, sauteed 2 cloves garlic in it before adding the heavy cream, and seasoned with basil leaves and nutmeg (in place of the salt and garlic salt) when i added the pepper.  I thought it looked thin but the consistency was perfect once I added the fettuccine (16 oz).  Delicious~thanks so much!

Very good basic sauce. Great with "sugar snap peas or fresh aspargus, and grilled chicken added to it. For those people out there that had some "trouble" with the sauce. Stay "away from "garlic salt" anytime you cook. Use "garlic powder and real garlic minced. Also, it was "not the "half and half, that caused the problem, it was the "fact the one reader used "margine". I've been using "fat free" half and half "for years, and no problem. Its up to the individual "taste" whether to use "salted or unsalted" butter, but you MUST use REAL butter! This is a "one time treat, so use the real butter! That is something you just can't do without.
A "pinch of "nutmeg" does wonders, and it is "often the missing star ingredient". Enjoy!!

This was great and I would definitely make it again.  Minus one star for the proportions being so off.  I kept everything the same, except I only used about half the butter and the fettucine called for, and it was the perfect amount of sauce.  So definitely cut the pasta in half.  And you do not need all that butter.  Also, the sauce was pretty thin and kind of lumpy, no matter how long I heated it to melt the cheese.  It might have been because the romano I used was shredded instead of grated.  Either way, it was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again, with different proportions of ingredients.

I made this for the first time last night (31/12/2011)for New Years eve potluck party, it was so easy and quick to make. Honestly i was worried about how it was going to turn out as i was already late getting to the party... i put in butter once melted and used real garlic (mince 5 cloves), heavy / thickened cream, then the cheeses, salt and pepper to taste. Things to watch out for pls taste ur sauce to make sure it is not too salty before putting in the fettuccine and always keeps stirring ur sauce for beautiful consistency. Anyway it turned out excellent & tastes awesome! Had so many compliments and saw ppl helping themselves to seconds ?? Great Start to the New Year 2012 thank you for sharing this recipe!

Sooo good!. . But, 24 oz of pasta and 1c butter is too much!  I halved the butter and I would still use less next time.  We used about 12-16 oz of pasta.  Subbed minced garlic (1T?) for garlic salt.  Used onlly parm cheese b/c that is what I had on hand.  Finished off w/ fresh ground pepper and parsley.  Very good.   Will definitely be our only alredo recipe we use!  Thanks!

Oh so good.  I did as had been suggested:  I mixed about a tablespoon of corn starch with the cheeses before adding to the cream.  I sauted garlic in the butter before adding the cream.  And I added the juice of half a lemon with the cheese.  Also, used additional Asiago cheese. Then I added shrimp that I had sauted in butter.  Yum

This recipe is amazing, however, I believe the salty problem may be from the use of garlic SALT instead of fresh garlic or garlic powder.  I prefer to use the fresh or minced garlic (store bought). I also omitted the salt from the mixture as an additive.  I didn't have any salt problem with mine after these changes. I live for an amazing dinner of fettucine alfredo but I also 'love' garlic in my food, so chose to include it as well as others.  Thanks for the information on the original fettucine recipe Erinmarie, it was very much appreciated.

This was fantastic fettuccine alfredo, very reminiscent of Olive Garden's version.  I halved the recipe and had plenty for four served alongside steamed broccoli.  Delicious recipe, thank you.

update: I made this a second time and my fiance can't stop talking about it!  He's telling EVERYONE that it is better than any fettuccine alfredo he's ever had (and of course he's giving me all of the credit!).  This time I used a blend of parmesan and mozzarella as well as the romano, and the flavors were wonderful.  I also added a dash of nutmeg each time, which really brought out the flavors.  With salted butter, I did not need to add any salt, but I added a sprinkle of pepper- even less than the nutmeg.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

I made this for dinner tonight and we loved it.   It was very creamy, rich, and delicious.  My daughter said it was better than Olive Garden!  I served with chicken breasts sauteed in butter and garlic and used about half of the pasta called for in the recipe.  Quite yummy, but we will have to save this recipe for special occasions due to the calories!

Delicious! I didn't use as much butter as the recipe calls for, I used about 2/3rds.  DELICIOUS! There's never any leftovers.  :)

This was really really good. The Recipe I had before was too bland. But this is really good. Thank you. I added a little more then a dash of garlic salt because I love flavors.

This recipe is amazing!! I have never written a review but I have to for this one. I have been making it for a couple years now and have got nothing but rave reviews about it.  I use the already sliced romano, asiago, and parmesan cheese from Trader Joes, it is the perfect amount for this recipe.  I also add quite a bit more garlic but other than that I follow it to a T.

This recipe is very yummy! I added fresh garlic (and some Garlic Garlic from Tastefully Simple) and used salted butter then omitted the garlic salt. My husband is on Atkin's diet so I put it on stirfried chicken with a meadly of veggies. He loved it. I served the rest of the family the same with some fettuccine. It was a big hit with all. Thanks for sharing!

This sauce is fantastic! I do think the butter is a bit much for me, so next time I may half that ingredient and see how it turns out. All-in-all, this one is a keeper! :)

This has to be the very best recipe I have ever found for this! I tweaked mine a bit by adding nutmeg to the sauce to taste. I never realized that nutmeg is what makes the Alfredo sauce taste the way it does!!! Other than that, this is a perfect recipe!

This was part of my husband's requested birthday dinner. We really loved it. I think I might try putting spinach in it next time. I liked the idea of putting garlic in with the butter before the whipping cream. Excellent!

Excellent recipe...I often wonder why the best recipes seem to be the simple ones...a full batch makes too much for just the two of us so we have leftovers and it reheats very well...toss in some heated broccoli florets for an added healthy touch

Very delicious. However, it is extremely unhealthy. I felt so guilty serving all that cholesterol and saturated fat to my husband. I'm starting to experiment with reducing the cream and butter gradually, and replacing it with milk. I've already notice that you can use a little less butter than the recipe calls for. Hopefully this delicious recipe can be something I'll be willing to serve to my loved ones more than once a year! 

I do like to have lots of sauce on pasta, but I used this sauce more as a condiment, and it was great that way. It decreases the impact of the problematic ingredients.

About a week later, I reconstituted the left over sauce with milk and used it in lasagna. mmm!

This is absolutely delicious!  I had some leftover salmon which I flaked up and added to the sauce to make Salmon Fettuccine Alfredo.  I also added some more of the cheeses to make it just a bit thicker.  Definitely a keeper!  I may add some fresh herbs next time just to mix it up a bit.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I must say this was simply delicious. The recipe calls for a DASH of garlic salt. Hello, there is salt in both cheeses. And, if you choose to use anything other than heavy whipping cream, your sauce is not going to be thick. When a recipe calls for butter, it means unsalted unless stated otherwise. I have made this numerous times and will continue to do so. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

If I could give this 6 stars, I would. I can't believe something so easy can be so good. I did cut the amount of dry pasta in half because we like lots of sauce. I think next time I will cut back just a little on the butter, but not much. I used fresh Romano and Parmesan and it was EXCELLENT!

I did not think this recipe was at all good.  It sounded really easy and I couldn't remember what recipe I used previous times so I just decided to try this.  It was not creamy enough, and it just didn't satisfy my craving.

This was a simple and delicious meal!!  My whole family gobbled it up, even my picky 9 year old.  I added broccoli to the noodles and topped it off with shrimp that was sauteed in 1 tbsp butter, fresh grated garlic and basil.  It was YUUUMMMY!  Thanks for sharing!

Really great, but also very rich. Substitute a little mink with the heavy cream and use a little less butter.

This was delicious!  I cut the butter in half and only used 16 oz. of fettuccine--kept all other ingredients the same.  We thought it was as good as the Olive Garden! For extra flavor add a spoon of pesto from a jar.

The sauce came out very buttery and runny and not thick at all.

So simple and just so delightful!  Didn't bother tweaking the recipe, and I will stick with it in the future.  Best alfredo in my memory.

Wow.. I did not care for this recipe at all. Incredibly buttery, I even halfed what it called for. We are not the healthiest, so butter usually isn't an issue. I couldn't find my original recipe, so I thought I would try this. Big mistake!! The sauce just flipped out of the pan, no scraping required. The sauce also was sooo yellow no matter how I mixed it.

We tried this recipe for the first time and it was amazing!  We used Kraft Parmesan and Romano cheese because it was difficult finding fresh cheese at the local grocery store (living overseas). I ended up adding a small amount (less than 1/4 cup) of milk to keep the sauce smooth but other than that, I followed the recipe.  I will be making this again to "carb up" just before a half marathon in July.  Excellent and highly recommended!

This alfredo sauce was very good however I didnt love it.   I have made alfredo with the olive garden recipe and I love the richness and depth of the flavor.  this was very close but it missed something for me in the fullness of the sauce.  I believe that the egg adds a richness that I like.  Its very good though and easy to make!! :)

This recipe was super easy and good.  I melted the butter first and put in two crushed garlic cloves for 10 minutes, removed the garlic, it gave the sauce a mild garlic flavor.  (I love garlic.)  The sauce is a bit thin.  Another member suggested using cornstarch.  I didn't because it was my first time trying this recipe, but I will next time.  I just let the hot noodles sit in the pasta for 5 minutes so it could soak up the sauce.  I tossed again right before serving with spaghetti with meat sauce and chunky garlic bread.  For the garlic bread spread, I used 1/2 stick of softened butter, 3 finely minced up garlic and 1/2 t. fresh thyme.  I spread that on store bought garlic bread split lengthwise and baked at 350 for about 12 minutes.  It was nice eating two different kinds of pastas in one meal.  I did the red sauce the day before, it tastes better the next day anyway.

Great!   I added some leftover broiled salmon and some raw spinach leaves to the final product cause thats how I roll.  I did add minced garlic, and more parm without any romano (didn't have any).  Loved it and will make more!

This was a great recipe.  I sauteed cut up chicken in some butter and a clove of minced garlic.  I seasoned it with a little salt and pepper then prepared the sauce in the same pan.  I would make again.

This is sooo yummy! Here are a few little tweaks:
I used penne instead of fettuccine. I used 1 stick salted and one stick unsalted butters. I couldn't get romano cheese by itself at my local grocer, but I did find a plastic jar that was "Shredded Parmesan, Romano and Asiago Cheeses" and used it in place. I did not add any extra salt and I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I served this with chicken breast that was cooked in butter and seasoned with minced garlic, oregano, salt and pepper and I chopped up some roma tomatoes to top it all off. A side of garlic bread and this was the most delicious alfredo meal I've had!

I have been making this for a few years now and it is absolutely perfect.  I just don't order this dish at restaurants anymore because this is better.  Only change is that I use all parmasean cheese because we don't keep Romano in the house.  Top with freshly ground black pepper.

Yum yum yum.  I did not have the different cheeses and just added the parmesan and it was delicious.  My only criticism is that it is not so creamy and did not reheat well the next day.  So don't plan on making extra for later.  This is definitly a cook and serve!

Wow.  Very rich and buttery.  I sauted some shrimp in butter and garlic and tossed in at the end.  Boyfriend loved it but I found it a little too rich.  Great with chilled white wine (Due Ami from Flat Creek Estate).  Maybe next time I'll use less butter, more garlic, and some veggies to cut up the texture.

This Fettuccine is WONDERFUL! I made it and Garlic Chicken on VDay for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it! For once he had enough to eat. Make sure you cook the sauce long enough to let the cheese melt. The Alfredo is rich and filling, and you'll eat till you are stuffed! The whole meal took like 45mins from start to finish and was wonderful. I would definately make this again. Thank you so much for the recipe. This dish is to die for!

This recipe tasted great but was to thin I even took the suggestions of others and let it sit but it never thickened up, i used 1 cup of romano and a half a cup of parmesean and still thin. But the family loved the flavor.

I've done this many times and it really is the best recipe I have tried as this is my favorite dish! However I start with adding frying chicken breasts with salt, pepper and oregano then before its almost fully cooked I add FRESH mushrooms (sliced) wow it changes the dish to a 5 star winner!

I made this recipe as is with the addition of maybe a tsp of minced garlic so it wouldn't have made a big difference in the overall outcome. It was delicious!! My husband said it is his new favorite Alfredo! I only had two complaints (if you can call it that). One: way too much pasta for the amount of sauce made. I had about twice as much pasta as I needed and that was after I added more pasta than I wanted to the sauce which spread my sauce really thin. Two: The leftovers did not turn out well at all! Very oily, not creamy at all, and hardly had the Alfredo taste, just tasted like the noodles were coated in Parmesan cheese... kind of. It was very bland. The day I made the recipe it started getting cold as we were eating it and it was starting to clump. Obviously this didn't reduce the amount of stars that I gave the recipe because the initial recipe was wonderful. I just wanted to mention it for those that were relying on leftovers and also hoping that someone else might have a solution to this problem? I would love to have some great Alfredo leftovers.

I only used half the butter and the sauce was spectacular. There's enough oil in the cream and cheeses to keep it flowing. I hate when the solids and oil just swim around each other, and too much butter will do that.
Oh and don't hold back on that dash of garlic either.

I like this sauce but made a few tweaks to it. I made a 4 serving batch even though I only coooked enough pasta for 2 people and that worked out perfectly. I added 1/3 cup of mozzarella cheese with the other cheese as well as 1 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The sauce was still a little too salty for my liking so next time I think I will add more mozzarella and less parmesean. Overall though, it was a keeper. I also added grilled chicken to the sauce and pasta as well.

Fantastic. I only made a couple of changes. I cut back on the butter and then added mozzarella at then end. A little less than half of mozzarella.

I have tried many alfredo sauce recipes and this is by far the best! I think the bad reviews are due to the recipe calling for grated cheeses. It is not the powder stuff in the can. Use SHREDDED cheeses! I bought a tub of refrigerated shredded Parmesan and Romano blend cheese. And there wasn't too much butter at all! You should also cook the sauce, stirring constantly over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes to thicken it up. Delicious! This recipe made almost enough for a pound of fettuccini.

I made this dish for a dinner party last week and it turned out great!  I did make a few adjustments however.

For the sauce, I added a little extra Parm and Romano, and also added in a little Ricotta to make it extra creamy.  
I would suggest too, if you like a lot of sauce, to double to recipe.  For my personal taste, I would have liked a little extra.

Overall though, this turned out perfect!  Definitely one I'll continue making!

The best recipe on the site to date! this alfredo is nothing less then perfect. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and only one stick of butter instead of 2. So easy and sooo good!

modified the recipe to three servings and used margarine and fat-free half & half instead of the butter and cream, along with a little more Parmesan. also sauteed chicken in italian seasonings, garlic and olive oil and added that to the sauce when it was finished.   it was delicious! could have actually used a little less margarine. I was actually surprised by how good this was because I'm really not an alfredo fan. maybe it's because I didn't make it as heavy as it should be!

I am not health conscious (at least when it comes to good food) so I omit nothing from this recipe and it is fabulous every time. I generally use this as a base for seafood alfredo (adding shrimp, scallops and crab meat) and it tastes rich and delicious every time. It's definitely worth the cost of the somewhat expensive ingredients and always makes the meal feel like a special occasion! Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  This is incredibly delicious.  i'd never attempted to make alfredo from scratch before and always used the kind in the bag or jar.  This is SO much better and it was so easy!  Like some of the others have said, it tastes almost identical to Olive Garden.  I followed the recipe exactly... I'll make this often!

Your typically delicious alfredo sauce! And so so so easy to make!! Didn't have any parmesan so I just used all romano and it still came out great! The secret to a GREAT alfredo sauce is the cheese. The better and fresher the cheese, the better the sauce! Period! I used the sauce for a tri-color tortellini alfredo! Yummy!

‘To Die For ‘ is an apt  description...I would use  a blend of butter and olive oil ( heavier on the Evoo) and whole milk. (I’ve substituted a little plain yogurt for cream in some recipes including ones like this.)  I’m 68 yrs old, health conscious and in good shape. Just sayin’....

Do yourself a favor and don't make this.  The amount of butter in this is insane and I am not saying that because I want to make a healthier version.  My advice would be to make Laura Vitale's version and use the chicken or fish pan to make it in (the extra bits make it much better). Use 4 tablespoons max, I only used 2 .... when this recipe calls for 2 entire sticks ! Use 1 cup to 1 1/4 cup heavy cream, and a cup of parmiggiano Reggiano and don't heat the cheese too much otherwise you will get a gritty texture. Toss in pasta just before cheese is melted.  


Or ... you could just melt two sticks of butter and drink it, that's basically what this sauce is.

I made it for my family for the first time and it was amazing. we didn't like how much butter it called for, the butter looked like grease at the bottom of our bowls when we finished. Other than that it was great and really easy to make.

I don't know what I did wrong but after I mixed the sauce to the pasta in about 2 minutes the pasta was so buttery and the creaminess AND FLAVOR that was initially there was gone. now I'm left with buttery, lightly flavored pasta. might try it again in the future...

I've made this about 1/2 dozen times and each time it's delicious.  I make the recipe exactly to a Tee but for 2 people.  Tonight (April 4, 2015) I made it with shrimps.  Can't wait to dig in.  Definitely not a diet day!  Update - May 6th, 2016 and still making this delicious pasta.  Tonight I'm going to reduce the butter to 2 tablespoon and use half and half cream.  Hopefully, it'll still be good!  And it was just as good!  I added a bit of pasta water to thin out the sauce.  Very yummy!

Amazing recipe and being a chef I added only a few items. Ground fresh nutmeg, minced garlic and a cup of cream cheese.  Do save the pasta water to thin the sauce because this sauce will tighten up on you.  The pasta water helps the sauce stick to the noodles.  For a main meal add meatballs and peas or do chicken and mushrooms, just whatever your preference. My husband said it was the BEST alfredo he ever had and he's an alfredo snob.  We will be doing this again and again, just with different items to have different experiences.  Wonderful flavor!!!

This is a great classic alfredo recipe.  Garnish with fresh chopped parsley for a little color.  If you don't want it to separate, HEAT THE BOWLS UP A BIT before plating.

This recipe should have been named "To die FROM" because of all the butter. Over the years I have come up with a pretty good alfredo recipe but am looking for something to top it. I think fresh minced garlic goes a long way in alfredo. I also prefer more cheese, less butter, and half and half instead of heavy cream.

this recipe is a very good start. I adjusted it a little. First off, I used only HALF the butter and the butter was ITALIAN butter. It has a higher fat content than domestic butter. It will definitely make a difference. I used the same amount of cheese but split it up using imported Romano (which is salty), Asiago, Parmesan and BUFFALO mozzarella.  I also packed the cheese tightly in the measuring cup and made sure it was shredded.
I also added 4 fresh crushed garlic gloves instead of garlic salt (once butter was nearly melted), half a cup of fresh diced basil (after the cream and butter bonded). 
Most critical (I think) is not to allow the butter to bubble. Slowly melt it,then slowly add the cream and whisk it non stop for at least 5 minutes. It takes a while for the butter and cream to bond. Don't let the cream/butter boil. It is bonded when the butter and cream no longer separate. Once this happens add the basil. Let it simmer a few minutes, then slowly add the cheese. I did each cheese a little bit at a time. It will take about 5-8 minutes to completely  melt and thicken.
When you add the pasta, use a wooden spoon. When it is all mixed well, add a little of the pasta water and mix well. The pasta water creates a smooth and glossy texture to the sauce. Top with a  fresh chopped basil.  

I prefer to use Parpadelle/Paglio egg noodles since they absorb the sauce very well. It will reheat well if you save a bit of the pasta water and cream to mix with it.

TOO much butter.  That's all you taste.  My kids love Alfredo but did not like this.  Waste of ingredients for us, plus not worth all the calories.

I made this twice so far. It came out great both times. I made my own macaroni for it and left it a little thicker than normal. The second time I put  lemon pepper right into the pasta dough. I baked some lemon pepper chicken, sliced it up and saved some of the Alfedo sauce to put over everything. It's a must to make again.

Awesome!  Thanks!  My modifications were using ~2 lbs sauted chicken breast, cut in small strips, and using all 1 pt of cream and 3/4 lb butter.  I added some extra of both types of cheeses to compensate for the extra cream.  I also used ~1 tsp crushed garlic, rather than garlic salt.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Waaaaaaaay too much butter.  I would start with half of the amount stated and work up if you think it needs more.
Other flavors were good and it was easy to make.

Was ok. I personally like the recipe on the back of the San Giorgio Fettuccine box. I've been making it for years. I think the balance of butter, cheese and cream is perfect. This recipe is close to the same ingredients but I really like the balance of the San Giorgio recipe. Sometimes I'll thrown in some garlic, sauteed mushrooms, shrimp or chicken.

Sooooo delish!!!! One of my favorite dishes is Fettuccini Alfredo and this is amazing.  I hardly ever stick to one recipe on this site but I won't try another one because this is so great.  YUM!

We used a romano and parmesan blend, it was finely grated (same texture as the one in the cheap green parmesan cans) and I think that is the best kind to use, mixes in the sauce easily and tastes better. Good find!

This is a variation on Alfredo, normally it is just butter and parmesan cheese.

Very, very good.  We also sprinkled more of the two (2) cheeses on top for a little more cheese.  Can't ever have too much cheese!

This is not an Alfredo, but a butter sauce.  Much better than a pasty Alfredo in my book.   The flavors are delicate and rich, lovely over homemade fettucine.  Dry white wine, grilled chicken breasts, green salad and you have a very nice feast.  I recommend!

I am not a huge fan of pasta, but my fiance and daughter is. I made this tonight, and they said it was better than Olive Garden's. The only thing that I change was subbed minced garlic for garlic salt and added parsley. What a GREAT recipe! Thank you!

Unbelievable Alfredo. I’ve made this 3 Times so far, the first with pan seared scallops, and the second with sautéed garlic shrimp. For the seafood lover, once your sauce is almost done, start cooking your scallops and/or shrimp. I say wait until your sauce is almost done because your pan seared scallops will literally only take a quick few minutes (for example). Then dish up! Add the noodles onto your plate, then Alfredo sauce and then the seafood to the top ...phenomenal! It’s nice for our family because for those less enthusiastic about seafood, they can have theirs plain. Everyone’s happy and plates licked clean. ;)

Excellent recipe! Did one change only. Made 1/3 recipe, omitted garlic powder, and used small clove of garlic, added while making sauce. The reason restaurant recipes taste so good, is because lots of butter makes it all better!  Just like this recipe. 1/3 recipe was generous four servings - enjoyed 4 meals all by myself - served with garlic bread. Liked it even reheated the next day, and the next - and did not get tired of it. Loved it every time!

I cut the butter in half and added fresh minced garlic rather than garlic salt. Used a blend of Romano, parmesan and Asiago cheeses. This was amazing!

I was very disappointed with this.  The kids however liked it.  Way to salty and I passed on the garlic salt.  I was also a little short on the grated cheese.  Must of been the butter.  Added garlic but not real pleased.

I did not care for this recipe. Sauce thinner than water, and almost tasteless, but I added fresh garlic and Italian flat leaf parsley.

I made this recipe for my daughter's "Golden Birthday"! She turned 24 on 5/24!
I used some of the tips others had given and it was over the top!! so amazing, and probably the best alfredo I have ever tasted!! AND I know what was in it!! :-)
I used the 24 oz of fettuccine, but 1 1/2 timed the sauce, since I love enough sauce!! I'm glad I did as it wouldn't have been enough had I not.

I also sauted 1 1/2 T minced garlic in 1 1/2 cups of butter, 1 1/4 cup of heavy cream, did not add salt or garlic powder, just pepper.

For the Cheese, I used a grated mix of Romano and Parmesan(1 1/4cups) to make the sauce, and after adding the noodles and getting them incorporated I added @ 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and @ 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese!

I did keep some of the pasta water (glad I did)and did not rinse the noodles after draining, just added them into the sauce! I used the pasta water, later when the sauce became too thick and sticky with the cheese.  It did a great job to loosen up the noodles for the second helping!

Thanks to all who I used your tips to combine in this recipe to make it absolutely AMAZING!!
This was easy and definitely something to make to impress guests, however, only for an occasional treat!! Very fattening!!

We served with BBQ chicken, grilled Asparagus, garlic bread and watermelon!! Amazing!!

Loved it! The only real differences I made was I used a full pint of the cream so that I didn't waste the rest and I added at least 5 cloves of garlic to the sauce. I didn't add any additional salt or pepper (or garlic salt) to the sauce. When I made the sauce I brought the cream/butter mixture up to a boil and then turned it down and added the cheese and stirred the mixture for 20 minutes. Like other posters mentioned, the sauce will taste salty but once you add it to the pasta it tastes perfect! 

Oh! And I only cooked 8 ounces of fettucci for the 2 of us...

Fettucine alfredo is a frequent dish on our table. Thank you, Erinmarie for sharing your recipe with us. I make my dish with a slight variation.  I do not use butter at all, I believe the fats in the added cheeses are more than enough. I stir two tbsp of flour in two cups of cooking cream and I add this mixture to one tbsp of sauteed garlic, on low heat, until it thickens. I then add the cheeses of my choice together with half a bouillon cube (1/2 tsp) and one tsp of lemon pepper, which is really a very tasty finish to the sauce.

Good recipe and all, although I did add Marble as I was not able to get some Romano or Parmesean cheese, I was doing the sauce and it looks almost soupy.

The first time I made this recipe I calculated it for 4ppl, I. Don't really like salty food so I adjusted it a little..1st I boild the pasta according to the package. Nxt, I put butter in a pan, I used less than 1/2 c because as some reviews said, it calls for too much butter. I fried some thin chicken cut into strips and I salted and peppered the chicken, I fried them till light golden brown (approx 4 min on each side on med heat)then I removed the chicken and added 1 clove of minced garlic because I thought it would be to garlicy, although nxt time I will use 2cloves. After the garlic sauteed in the butter I added the cream(added more bcus I like my alfredo creamy instead of dry) and added the cheeses gradually while stirring the whole time on low to med heat, as I added the cheeses I squeezed 1/2 of a small lemon into the sauce. It didn't take much to start to thicken so I added the chicken and small pieces of broccoli, I let tht boil in the sauce for 3min then I. Added the pasta andi let tht boil for another 3-5min. I dnt like my broccoli overcooked, if u do u can hold off on adding the pasta and cooking it longer. Overall, this recipe was great, my family like it. Will make it again. I liked it even more than olive garden, jst bcus I knw what's in it.

There is WAY too much butter in this recipe. It tasted good when I first made it, but my poor pasta was swimming in butter when I reheated it. I poured off some butter 2 or 3 times and still found some in the bottom of my bowl when I was done. A half or even a quarter of the suggested amount would be more than enough. I would like to taste the cheese and cream too, not just the butter!

I made this recipe tonight for the first time, replacing my old fettuccine recipe and I was so excited! I followed the recipe exactly except I added some cooked chicken to the whole dish at the end and it was amazing! My husband was a fan as well. He asked if this dish was different and when I said yes he said "it's way better". Haha mind you I used to use the jar stuff (the better brands too!) But anyway, it is rich like some of the other reviews had said but if you eat the appropriate amount and not a plate full, it's really a great dish! I plan on permanetly replacing my old recipe with this one! Thanks for sharing!

This is my all time favorite alfredo recipe.  The Romano cheese gives it a bold rich flavor that sets it apart from other alfredo recipes.

Saw this recipe, tried it, and loved it. I don't understand the people that say "I love this recipe" and then say... "but I changed it". The only thing I did was add chicken! Great recipe!

Sauce seperated no matter what I did.  Taste was good but the texture just didn't sit well with me.  Will try again.

This deserves a 5 on simplicity alone.  The pasta took 12 minutes cook and the sauce was done in half that time.  Another benefit is that few ingredients are needed.  I agree that the recipe makes the right amount of sauce for about half the amount of pasta.  I made 2 side dish servings (still pretty large) with 3 oz pasta, 2 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup half and half, 1/4 tspn garlic powder, 1/4 tspn cracked black pepper, and 3 tbsp romano/parm cheese blend.  Since the sauce was done early, I needed to add a little more half and half at the end to make it nice and creamy again.   I appreciated the tip about tossing the cheese with a little cornstarch.  It worked like a charm to pull the sauce together.  Thanks, Erinmarie, for such a quick, easy, tasty recipe.

This is absolutely the best fettuccine alfredo I've ever had in my entire life, and that includes from restaurants! In the future, I'm definitely trying shrimp, chicken, and crawfish in it! 

Only thing though: It was a little greasy. Next time I'm definitely using a little less butter. But otherwise, PERFECT and DELICIOUS!

Outstanding recipe!  I did make changes though and these were based on other reviewers.  I did cut the butter down to 3/4 cups and I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Outstanding!  And many possibilities for variations.  Will be making this again!

This recipe is truly to die for!  Simple to make and hands down the best alfredo I have ever eaten.  Will make this again.  I followed the recipe to a T but cut it down to 4 servings so that I could use 1 box of pasta.

Sorry, I just don't get what all the good reviews are about. perhaps i made it wrong? however, i followed it exactly. maybe the key really is HALFING the butter. have you ever had a pasta dish that was supposed to be creamy, but instead was a buttery, shiny noodle dish? That was this alfredo. somewhat bland. Buttery. overall, just not great. i'll be trying another recipe next time. maybe the recipes using egg are the super creamy alfredos i was thinking of.

My family LOVED this!!!!!  My 18-year-old son, who is impressed by NOTHING was saying through his stuffed mouth "Sooooo good!"  We added about 2 T of fresh lemon juice, and 3 cloves of minced garlic.  We didn't use garlic salt, just added a bit of sea salt from the salt grinder.  Also added some corn starch to thicken it up.  Don't know if that was necessary, it just looked thin and I am not an experienced cook.  I also grilled up 2 chicken breasts, cut them up and added at the end.  I thought there was too much pasta for the amount of sauce, and left some out at the end.  Anyway, it was delicious and this will absolutely be one of our special treats.

This was absolutely wonderful. I used real garlic cloves that I cut into slivers instead of garlic salt. And I couldn't find Romano cheese by itself in a package so I used the Italian  cheese blend ( Asiago, Provolone, smoked mozzarella, Romano, Parmesan) and then also the grated Parmesan and it was wonderful. Tasted so much like Olive gardens.

I LOVE fettuccine alfredo, so I have been searching for the best recipe & this is it. Simple & delicious! I cut the butter in HALF & used 1 cup of a parmesan & romano blend. Still tasted wonderful, creamy & rich!

Everyone loved this at my house.  I had to sub the Romano cheese, so I used Asiago instead - very flavorful and tasty.  The Asiago is a bit sharper than the Romano, as evidenced by the smell - but delicious.  Can't wait to try it with the Romano.  Nice and thick sauce, and plenty of it as well.

This is the only homemade Alfredo recipe I have ever tried and it is sooooo good. The only thing I change is adding a little minced garlic instead of garlic salt. I add shrimp in during the last few minutes of cooking and it turns out so wonderful. Even better than shrimp fettuccine Alfredo from the olive garden, which has long been a favorite of mine.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner with my husband and he loved it! He said I could definitely compete with Olive Garden :) I used the following ingredients: 16oz box fettuccine, 3/4 cups butter (1/2 cup salted, 1/4 cup unsalted), 1 pint heavy whipping cream, 5oz container of a blend of shredded parmesan, romano, and asiago cheese, 1 additional cup of freshly grated parmesan, and salt, pepper, and garlic salt to taste. The cheese did not blend in completely but it wasn't a big deal. I also added 1.5lbs of shrimp cooked in butter and garlic. The pasta came out with plenty of sauce and I served it with garlic bread. It was a BIG hit!

My sauce wasnt as smooth and creamy as i would have liked but the taste was great! It didnt thicken up that well either. I topped the dish with crispy boneless skinless chicken. I pounded it thin,and cut into strips after frying.
I had the worst stomach ache that night. I dont think my stomach can handle all that fat content!!

If I could eat this every day without gaining any weight, I would.  It's delicious.  I only use a pound of pasta, though, but make the original amount of sauce, since we like our fettuccine creamy.  This is my permanent fettuccine Alfredo recipe.

A very rich fettucine, but yummy. I figured it could do with a bit more garlic salt, so I added some more and it turned out well. Also very versatile, you can add anything to it! Julienned ham and shrimp skewers have been our favourites so far.

I added fresh ground garlic powder  & a squeeze of lemon when adding the cheeses (It helps to break down the cheese & get it to melt more "creamily") & decreased the butter (I used unsalted...I always do) down to 3/4 cup to lessen the fat. The sauce was plenty rich enough so I'm glad I did. Next time, I may even decrease it down to 1/2 cup & see how it goes.  I did let it simmer for a bit before adding the cheese just until it thickened slightly. The cheese will thicken it some so it doesn't need much help. I only made enough pasta for hubby & I & I saved the leftover sauce for another meal. I topped it w/ fresh, red onion slices & a roasted chicken breast from a store-bought rotissire chicken. I served it w/ Tomato Mozzarella Bites (from allrecipes) as an appetizer & garlic toast as a side. It was a fast, easy, INCREDIBLE dinner...thanks!

This alfredo sauce is the best I've made. I've tried other recipes for alfredo & they all came out grainy. This sauce is nice & smooth. My husband is an alfredo freak & he said this one is the only one he wants me to make ever again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this again last night and just realized I've been doing it wrong, but in a good way.  I only use 1 stick of butter, which is 1/2 cup vs. the one whole cup called for.  And I just add the whole pint of cream.  I also added some leftover Easter ham and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I just love this recipe it's so rich and versatile.  Last time I added chicken and broccoli.  Next time I think I will try it with crumbled bacon.

Super easy to make a great sauce with this recipe! I've searched high and low and finally found one I love. Only variation I made was to use one finely chopped garlic clove and plain salt instead of the garlic salt. Excellent!

My boyfriend loves this Alfredo!!!  I thought it was a bit bland as I didn't use garlic salt; I used pressed fresh garlic.  I also used a 5oz tub of freshly shredded 3 cheese italian cheese that had parm, asiago & romano cheese.  I only made 16 oz of noodles and it all turned out perfectly!  My boyfriend LOVES Fettuccine and he wants me to make it on a regular basis. It was pretty easy to make and the sauce had a great consistency.  Next time I may have to add salt or some garlic salt.  I just prefer fresh garlic.

My sauce broke and became semi-grainy but still tasted excellent. I added mixed diced vegetables and pan fried bacon to the sauce for a satisfying meal.

This is soo good. I have to cut it down to half a recipe because a whole on is too much for two people.I put a little extra cheese in mine to make it richer. It doesn't reheat well, but very few alfredos do.

Great recipe!  We follow it to the letter and it's delicious every time.  Sometimes we add chicken too.  I think the only discrepancy we have is with the amount of pasta the recipe says to use.  24 oz seems like way too much to us.

I tried this recipe out and it tasted pretty good, but next time I'm going to try it out with a lot *less* butter.  That's why I gave it only three stars... it was just way too  buttery!

This was fantastic!! I made a few changes...we didn't have any Romano or Parmesean that I could grate fresh. I had about 1/2 a cup of shredded parmesan(the kind that just comes in a bag), and then added almost a cup of Parmesean Romano that comes in the can. And I was afraid that wouldn't be as good, but it was! I also cooked some broccoli and mixed it in. Then I put it in a casserole dish and put shredded Cheddar Jack cheese on top and baked it....and it was FANTASTIC! I tried to copy my favorite dish from Ruby Tuesday and it was actually pretty close...I just made it w/o chicken, b/c I am a college student and that is just too much work for me. I really enjoyed this recipe...thanks so much!

Not the best alfredo sauce I have ever had, but it is not bad. I found it a little bland, and boring. Maybe I'm just getting sick of fettuccine alfredo?

Best alfredo I've ever made!  I make it regularly.  Since trying this the first time, I have experimented to make it less fattening.  Replace heavy cream with half-and-half...still bad, but not AS BAD.  The sauce still tastes great, though it may not be perfectly smooth in texture.

This recipe was fantastic!  I added minced garlic instead of the powder and used the romano and parmesan cheese the required shredding vs. the already shredded in a bag kind.  It turned out great and my husband & 3 year old loved it too!  I did find that I had to increase the heat a little on my electric stove, otherwise I think it would have taken forever for the butter to melt.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow . . . this recipe is wonderful! This really is comparable to upscale restaurant fettucini.  Make sure to use freshly grated cheese (I usually am a bagged cheese user, but not in this case).  It makes all the difference.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

ABSOLUTELY fabulous!  This recipe is one of the very best on ALLRECIPES.  Be sure to make plenty of the sauce, as the recipe tends to be a little conservative...be sure to forget the diet for this meal - and it is well worth it!

I made this last night and brought it in for a work luncheon today.  I ended up using a cup of a Parmesan/Romano cheese mix rather than buying two separate types (I might add 1/4 cup more next time.)  Also added cooked shrimp (quick frozen) and it was a huge hit. The sauce did look a little thin initially but seemed to thicken and it looked fine when reheated.  Will definitely make again.

Move over Olive Garden - this Fettuccine recipe is very much "to die for".  I did add a bit more of the cheeses than it called for though (mmm, mmm, tasty) and next time, we are going to experiment with 1/2 the butter - just a little on the greasy side, but WELL WORTH IT.  I'm pregnant and my tummy is being very picky - I crave Olive Garden's Fettuccine but now I can make it at home.  Thank you!  I can't wait to make it for guests...

This is definitely the best Fettuccine Alfredo recipe. It was simple to prepare. I added shrimp, which gave it more flavor. I highly recommend it.

Honestly, it's a fabulous recipe. I think shredded parmesan works just as good. When you live in a small city like I do and don't have access to any good Italian restaurants and still want Italian.. Well, that sounds like 'This is the next best thing.' But really, this might be better. I intend to make it again. :)

Made the recipe to a T besides adding some fresh basil towards the end along with chicken, which I sautéed in a pan with butter, salt, pepper and some fresh garlic. First time making homemade fettuccine Alfredo and my boyfriend and I loved it. Highly recommend!! Use half amount of noodles and if you like really saucy food make 1.5 times the sauce.

I followed the recipe to a tee and ended up with a way overly buttery sauce that left a lot of melted butter residue on the bottom of my plate. I tried refrigerating this mess and ended up with a hardened block of cheesy butter that melted back into something that looked way more like butter than alfreo sauce. There are several recipes online that don't call for more butter than cream that make a whole lot more sense to me now. Will be using one of those instead of this . What a colossal waste.

I'm a butter fiend, but found that this was too much butter, even for me. I use one stick to feed three, along with about 3/4 cup of heavy cream and the cheese. I grated a clove of fresh garlic into the butter.

This was horrible. If this recipe wants you to use fresh cheeses instead of jar, then it should say so. I tried with jarred cheeses, and it come out extremely buttery and the cheeses come out lumpy

I made this on Sunday. OMG! Way better than Olive Garden. Made the recipe as is, and it was great. I don't get where people say there was to much butter.  I used stick butter instead of butter in the container, maybe that made a difference.  This is a keeper.

I followed the instructions step by step but there was sooo much butter!  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a health freak and I slather butter on everything I can get my hands on, but there was so much in this recipe, that there was 1/2 a cup of butter floating on top of the sauce.  I had to literally use a soup ladle to get it all out.  I don't know why the butter and cheese separated by I followed all the steps and it was too much.  Maybe using 1/4  to 1/2 cup butter will have better results.  
To add more flavor to this recipe, I added half a teaspoon of garlic, white pepper, nutmeg, and some cajun seasoning and then tossed in some mushrooms.  Luckily, I was able to salvage the mess and it came out great!

Total disappointment!!
Could have been good, but there was way too much butter!!  It was gross.  One stick (or less) would have been more than enough.  Not enough cream for all the pasta recipe calls for either.
Where is the fresh garlic?  Where is the fresh parsley?

I made the fettuccine noodles al dente. Set aside. Then sautéed mushrooms, zucchini,  and asparagus in a white wine garlic butter sauce. Strained it. Then made the fettuccine alfredo sauce and added the sautéed vegetables and the noodles. Awesome! Dipped a baguette  in the sauce while eating with an excellent chardonnay. To die for.

By far the BEST Alfredo recipe ever!  I made this with fresh shrimp I bought at the beach.  Couldn’t find Romano so I bought Asiago.  It was amazing!  My sister & her family devoured it!   Can’t wait to try it with chicken!

It's an ok recipe but not great.  The Romano cheese is stinky.  Very stinky. Might be good if you just used the Parmesan.

This is the first time I ever attempted to make alfredo . The recipe is definitely rich but  simple to put together. I did not make any changes, but Jeez Louise did it turn out delicious. I think the next time I'm dining out I might take my alfredo sauce with me.

This Alfredo was very good. The sauce was very buttery which was delish, but left a greasy feel on my lips. I will try to  use a little less butter and add more heavy cream next time. I also added some grilled chicken strips.  Very Good! Thanks!

This is far too rich for our liking, the cream went grainy, and it just didn't compare to the traditional alfredo sauce I always make. Neither of us finished our meal...

Amazing Fettuccine Alfredo!  Best we have ever had - equal to or exceeding any restaurant preparation.  (And don't even mention those yucky jarred sauces in the grocery!)  Some things in life are so good that you put everything else aside and make it your primary dish or method of preparation.  This is one of them and I'll never think of making Alfredo Sauce any other way.  I made it just as the recipe was written, except that I didn't cook as much pasta.  (I love sauce!)  I was very tempted to add some garlic because I'm from New Orleans and we add garlic to ALL things edible - but held back due to the comment from ERINMARIE (the author).  She posted in the comments that garlic is NOT in true Italian Alfredo Sauce, so I held off and glad I did; it wasn’t needed. Everything went together smoothly and incorporated very well using the precise method described in the recipe.  Melt the butter and warm the cream together (I used an enameled 3-1/2 quart cast iron Dutch oven), add the salt, etc., whisking all together, keeping everything warm, then add the cheeses.  (I had on hand some imported cheeses and did grate them right before making the dish. These cheeses were the star of the show!) Everything blended in extremely well with a few whisks and I kept it low-warm until draining the pasta and tossing that in.  I did reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water and, once the pasta was in the pot, the sauce thickened somewhat but adding the reserved pasta water made it perfect once ag

5-stars AS-IS! The only thing I changed was the amount of pasta. It only needs roughly 10-12 ounces. I decided to try it out exactly as-is because I hate when people rate recipes after they've changed 10 things and turned it into a completely different dish. Next time I'll add roasted garlic. Besides that it's pretty much perfect; )

Excellent as written and so yummy!  
Plus you can add anything you want to change it up.  I have used Cajun seasoning,  more or less cheese, half and half, veggies and mushrooms.

I came home with fresh parm only.  So the Romano cheese was omitted.  I used to total amount of cheese as Parmesan.  The sauce was too "loose".  Baked it at 300 for 10 minutes.  Disappointed to say the least.

Mmmmm, very good sauce. First I melted the butter, then I added a spoonful of minced garlic. Next I put in the cream and heated. Then I added the cheese, which all the store had was a parm, romano, and asiogo mix. I added a dash of nutmeg and a few grinds of black pepper. I only added the pasta to boiling water once this was all together and I stirred the sauce while the pasta cooked which have it time to thicken. I did not need the whole box of pasta (used penne), but I wanted it super saucy. Turned out perfectly!

My family LOVED this To Die For Fettuccini Alfredo!  My dog loved it too. I will have to admit that I changed it a bit. I did 1/2 cup no salt butter, and sautéd a bit of garlic in the butter first. I did not use the garlic salt. Actually, I didn't add any salt at all. I will make this again in the future. :)

I like this recipe a lot. I have made it a few times now as fettuccine alfredo is one of my favourites. It should always be this simple to make in my opinion. I actually want to buy some Romano though next time because I always just use parm. I'll bet it's even better with the 2 cheeses.

Love this recipe as a base.  I added asiago(I added 3/4 cup asiago in addition to all other cheese) and onion for flavor and it turned out great.  Saute garlic and onion in butter.  Add the asiago with the rest of the cheese.  Great, smooth recipe.  Not grainy like a lot of alfredo recipes.

Followed the recipe but reduced the butter by half and added a 1/2 cup of mozzarella and sauted fresh garlic.Also marinated some chicken breast cut into strips and marinated in 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and sauted with mushrooms. Steamed broccoli and carrots on the side and let everyone add. Delicious!  Next time I'll add spinach at the end.

this WAS A HIT... I made this for my husband...this is a very very good Alfredo recipe , very easy but I do feel using less butter 1/2 of what the recipe calls for will do just fine. Because it is very very greasy w/ 2 sticks of butter. If you want to cut calories and cholesterol use smart butter or I can't believe its not butter. Also a mix of heavy cream w/ Half&half will work too.. I served this with grilled blackened chicken thighs I cut up layered on top sprinkled some red pepper flakes in it for a little heat.. This sauce is so easy to make & taste better than any Alfredo sauce you go out to eat.. Which means we will not be eating out for any form of Alfredo pasta .. this can be used with shrimp, scallops, chicken etc....

Fantastic recipe!  I did what others have done and minced a bit of fresh garlic and sauteed it in butter before adding the cream.  My husband who has never eaten alfredo before has said that I can make this any time for dinner!  Very easy to make but because of the high calorie content I must resist the temptation of making it too often! :)

I made fettuccine alfredo for the first time using this recipe.  It was so good and the family loved it so much that I don't need to look anywhere else for another recipe.  I did add shrimp to it but it would have been just as great without it.  The only suggestion I have is to not serve it immediately.  I let my pasta sit in the sauce for just a few minutes to absorb some flavor and the sauce stuck to it better that way.  It was a huge hit in our house and I'll be making it again very soon.

The sauce had way too much butter.  Next time I try this I will cut the butter in half.  Otherwise it was very good.

This recipe is just amazing. It probably has ruined me for eating fettuccine alfrado at resturaunts. The only addition I did to it was I prepared some cut up chicken and added it to the mix. Just awesome all around.

I can honestly say that after trying this recipe, it is by far my favorite Fettuccine Alfredo to date.  The only thing I changed and 2 things added, were 18% table cream instead of the heavy cream and I added chopped red pepper and sun dried tomatoes.  Yum!!!

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it can be inconsistent, the first time I tried it it didn't thicken and I had to add a little flour to get it the right consistence (it was still great tasting) the next time it was perfect, I still make this dish regularly but I sometimes have to tweak it. But overall delicious!

I don't cook often and am not a very good one when I do but this was an extremely easy recipe and turned out delicious. Simple ingredients that most people already have in their kitchen with the exception of the heavy cream maybe. I cut the recipe in half since I was only cooking for 2 and still had leftovers. Since the sauce is basically all butter, heavy cream and cheese I held back on the butter. Definitely will make this again!

I made this recipe exactly how it says except for two things: didn't have Romano so just subbed it for more Parmesan and I only had a 16oz package of fettuccine instead of 24 oz., but I definitely think the 24 oz. package would've been way too much pasta for the amount of sauce. I used the Kraft grated cheese- nothing fancy. This came out amazing. It took longer than 30 minutes because I melted the butter into the cream over low heat (how it says) and that took a while in itself. Then, to make sure it got creamy I stirred for about 15 minutes on med-low heat, then let it sit untouched for about 5 minutes. My husband was amazed at how delicious this was! I will be making this again. Not healthy, but too good to pass up.

This was just like restaurant pasta! If you don't like total cheese taste, just add a bit of pesto paste to it. But other than that it was absolutely the easiest, and most delicious pasta my family has ever made! Easily a do again!! :-)

My very first time making homemade fettuccine alfredo and it was delicious ! I added a little minced garlic a little cayenne pepper and a couple twists of Italian herbs and spices grilled some chicken in a separate pan to add on top at the end and enjoyed a wonderful candle light dinner with my girlfriend on valentines day! Thanks a lot! I surprised myself with this recipe !

This is a great recipe - I added 2 whole garlic cloves into the cream sauce and then removed them before serving - gives it a light garlic flavor. Also, squeezed the juice of half a lemon into the sauce right before it was done - you don't taste the lemon but it lightens and brightens the flavor. I use half parmesan and half romano.  Definitely cook the pasta so that it is done when the sauce is done so you can drain the pasta and immediately add it into the sauce before serving, this will make the pasta absorb the sauce. I grilled shrimp separately and also cooked broccoli separately to add in at the table. Yummy! Thank you for sharing.

This the best we have ever had, I grilled some chicken and some broccoli cut up real small, then added it to the sauce before adding the pasta.  I also added just a little diced pimento for some color.  This truly is to die for, thanks for a super recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as shown, except the cheese. I only included the parmesan cheese, but it still tasted amazing. I added mushrooms and zucchini and it tasted so creamy and silky. 
I have to reserve this meal for special occasions, though. It is really not for the health conscious.

I just made this recipe because my step daughter asked for Chicken Alfredo for her birthday dinner. I followed the recipe to the "T", except adding bite size grilled up chicken. I thought it was fabulous and so did the whole family!

OMG! I had never made fetuccini alfredo before, always thought it would be difficult.  It was EASY PEASY and absolutely dee-lish!  My husband thought he had died and gone to Heaven.  The only thing I will do differently next time is cut the pasta to one 1 lb. box, you really don't need more than that.  Also, I did follow one reviewer's suggestion of cooking the sauce for about 10 minutes just to make sure it was thick enough.  I have already copied this into my recipe box...YUMMMMMMY!!

I am not sure what I did wrong, my sauce came out gritty the cheese didn't melt completely and it was not creamy.  If someone might have a suggestion what I might have done wrong. It had good favor but it was gritty.

I've made this twice and both times it turned out excellent but used half the butter the second time and it was perfect. I also sautéed yellow, orange and red peppers with an onion and two cloves of mixed garlic to add as a topping. Broccoli was also an option for my guests along with shrimp or chicken.

This recipe was awesome. My daughter and I made it together and we were giving each other hi-fives while were eating. We added chicken breast strips and broccoli florets to ours. It was delicious.  We did cut back on the butter amount.  No need to order this at the restaurant  anymore.  So happy we picked the right recipe on the first try.

This is awesome.  Anyone wanting a good "start from scratch" recipe for alfredo, this is it.  I've done this for years. Everyone should always "TASTE" their food while cooking to adjust for seasonings. KUDOS ErinMarie!

Perfect Alfredo sauce. We were afraid it was too soupy, but once we tossed it in the pot with the cooked pasta, it clinged perfectly to the pasta. 5 stars all the way! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe and very easy. The secret to reheating is DO NOT MICROWAVE. Use a non-stick skillet, medium heat, and add a little milk or cream to thin it down. My leftovers turned out perfect. We added shrimp and garlic...it was fantastic! Based on the previous reviews, I only made one box (1 lb.) of pasta. It was perfect.

I'm an extremely picky eater and this fettuccini is better than Maggiano's! I was hesitant to make it homemade because it usually doesnt live up to the restaurant's fettuccini, but rich, creamy alfredo is most definitely restaurant worthy!

I was hoping I would love this.  But I was disappointed.  Very bland.  I think it is hard to find a GREAT Fettuccine Alfredo recipe when you do the taste buds in your mouth celebrate because it ROCKS.  
But mostly they just are very bland, like this one.  Not bad but not great either.
I won't be making this variation again.

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!  And so easy to prepare!  I love salt but an FYI-I can see why some reviewers say this recipe is too salty!  I made exactly as stated but to reduce the salt intake, I used UNsalted butter and garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt.  The cheese alone has a ton of salt, so I don't think there is a need for "salt to taste".  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful, easy recipe!  This is now my "go to" alfredo sauce!

Perfect as is!! You have the option on here to cut the recipe in half. Excellent flavor and you need to eat this up the first night. Not so great as leftovers unless you make a little more sauce to cream it up a bit. LOVE THIS!!

Always thought alfedo sauce would be difficult, but this recipe was fast and so good.   Used a grated clove of garlic instead of he powder because that is what I had.

I made this as a special dinner for me and my husband. Fettuccini alfredo is both our favorite dish. We were blown away by how good this was! It tasted better than any alfredo sauce we've ever had in a restaurant, and we've tried a lot of them! It was also pretty easy to make and there's a bit of room for error and changes in seasoning. We will definitely be making this again. I don't think we can be satisfied with any other fettuccini alfredo after this.

Very salty even though I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and I did not add any additional salt, only pepper.  Next time I will buy unsalted butter for this recipe.  I used less butter using 3/4 c instead of the 1 c called for, and next time I will use even less and use only 1/2 c. I like the hint about making sure you use the correct amount of cream, it is 3/4 of a PINT which is 1.5 cups.

Oh yeah!!  This is IT!  Thank you for those who said to add a little cornstarch to the cheese to help thicken the sauce.  Also, shred your own cheese, don't buy the already grated kind.  It works ok for topping casseroles, etc, but NOT in this wonderful recipe.  We've added shrimp and also chicken another time.  It just gets better and better.  Also added a little cream when we reheated for the next day and it worked well.
Enjoy this recipe - it's fabulous.

Made it this past weekend and it was very simple and delicious.  I added garlic as some suggested.  I also added more pepper which I think really made a difference.  Yummy!

I admit that I changed the basic recipe, but a good base recipe is a treasure. I added 6 cloves of minced garlic, 1 c mushrooms, 1 1/2 c fresh broccoli florets, blanched and 2 baked chicken breasts, (rubbed with onion powder and mayonnaise), chopped into bite-sized pieces. The sauce requires stirring to thicken. Because I wanted this to my taste, I increased both cheeses by 1/4 c and omitted the salt and pepper. As I said, a great base recipe!

Awesome alfredo sauce! However, I did take 2 tsp of the butter and cooked some fresh minced garlic in the saucepan until browned. Then added the rest. Also added some  chicken tenderloins(sauteed in a little olive oil and minced garlic). Will Definitely use this recipe again!

Just finished making this. Really easy, quick and tasty . I used the whole pint of cream and just added a little extra cheese, cut back on the butter and kept turning the noodles into the sauce untill all the sauce was absorbed.

I had never made Alfredo sauce before, was surprised at how easy it was and ... OMG delish!!! I read a few of the other comments and took their advice ... cut the butter in half, mixed the two cheeses in a small bowl and sifted in some cornstarch before adding to the butter/cream mixture and added some grilled chicken breast, fresh steamed broccoli florets and minced fresh garlic.  Added bonus, my fiance LOVED it too ;-)
OH! AND I used rotelli instead of fettuccine and the Alfredo sauce got all caught up in the folds of the rotelli, it was sooo good.

This recipe is awesome!!!

My 9-year-old actually prepared this and made homemade fettuccini to go with it with our pasta maker.  So delicious!  Anything with this much butter and cream, of course, is bound to be tasty!

Loved it:) definately making it again! I had tried other recipes for alfredo sauce but they never turned out right. So, I tried this one thinking probably the same would happen my husband and I both think it tastes like Olive Garden's, I did do some things differently, I was not able to get Romano Cheese. So I bought the mixed one of parmeson and romano in powder form. I had grated parmesan so I just added more of that and for more cheese I added mozzarella. Next time I want to make it the way the recipe calls for but it is great this way as well.

Authentic Alfredo sauce has no garlic. Try it without...add more black pepper instead. Also, if it's runny, add a beaten egg yolk very slowly.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! It was my first attempt to make any kind of sauce. The kids asked for more! It took a while to thicken up, but I think I might have used a little too much creame. Next go round I will add a little cornstarch like suggested.

Excellent - suggestion - serve with cajun chicken breasts and garlic bread (made with Garlic Valley Farms garlic juice and butter) Perfect cold weather meal - Instead of adding garlic to the fettuccine i spray the serving bowl with garlic juice and mix well

This fettuccine was so awesome, my entire family went crazy. I read most of the reviews and varied my version by adding grilled chicken slices sauteed with garlic cloves, and season salt to taste, added fresh spinach, used unsalted butter, and added a touch of corn starch which helped thicken the sauce as one reviewer advised. The rest of my additions came from some of the other reviewers as well - give it a try with some of your favorite extras, the only thing I will add next time is shrimp. The other thing I loved about this recipe was that it was quick, dinner on the table in less than an hour was important after a long day of work.

I thought this recipe was awesome!! I made it for the first time today and everyone in my family loved it!! They said it was just like Olive Garden. I did however change a few things. Instead of garlic salt I did garlic powder. I did a 15 ounce dry fettuccini pasta, which fed 6. I did a little over 1/2 a cup of parmesan and romano cheese. I also got chicken breast strips and cooked on a skillet with butter and lawry's salt, which someone had suggested on a review. Also when I reheated it I added a little bit more cream, put it in the microwave for one minute then added more cheese and cooked it for an additonal 40 sec and it was perfect again!!!

Loved this sauce and the tip about mixing the cornstarch with the cheese was awesome.  Created a nice thick sauce.  My daughter loved it and she is one picky eater.  I did add some garlic salt to the recipe..

Considering it calls for a pound of fettuccini (when scaled to down to 4 servings) but you don't really need the pound (unless you want your noodles to be /very/ lightly coated, as mine were), its not really THE best recipe, but I suppose better be safe then sorry... Anyway the sauce seemed good (I omitted the Romano and put Parmesean in it's place) but I think if I would have used the Romano it would've been a bit more 'complex'. All-in-all, a 'short and sweet' recipe that doesn't really call for much and makes a decent pasta, so if you're pressed for time and you're looking for a shorter ingredient list, then try it, its very much satisfactory (some kind of bread-stick/garlic-stick goes nicely).

Very good!  I made it with less pasta because we like extra sauce and I also added more Ramano and Parmesan cheese to the sauce.  Excellent!

My daughter and I are fettuccine lovers. Going out is not always an option so we wanted to learn how to make our own. I tried this recipe and I am already in love with it! No more jars of Ragu sauce for us. I will never make that again! I cook for my family of 6 and my parents so we had alot of mouths to feed. I double the recipe(well probably tripled) but the best part is their is leftovers! Thank you for sharing this recipe it was great!!!

This is REALLY yummy!! I've made this twice so far. I haven't made any changes to the recipe, except maybe the brands of cheeses. I couldn't stop thinking about it yesterday, so it's your fettucine alfredo for dinner tonight :)

This was AWESOME!  Hubby loved it and we both thought it was amazing.  Some edits I made to the recipe- only used 1 stick of butter instead of 2 and added the minced garlic like others suggested before the cream.  Will keep in my recipe box... AWESOME!  We paired it with salads, sweet mild Italian sausage, and garlic bread.  Mmm mm!

I am giving this 4 stars because it was very oily. Next time I will only use half the butter. I added chopped garlic to the sauce and shredded rotisserie chicken to the sauce before I poured it on the linguine and it was delicious. This was very very good, but too much butter!!!

This was awesome! i highly recommend. my partner who does not like creamy sauces absolutely loved it. I did what everybody else did and cut the butter in half and that was more than enough. Tastes great the next day also, but doesnt look as the cream seperates. I too used unsalted butter and found it to be salty enough from the cheeses. I added pan fried chicken and sauteed mushrooms and garlic, it gave it a good kick! Thanks for posting this, i am making for my sisters tonight!

I made this for my parents and they said it tasted like it came from a high-end restaurant! It was super easy to make. I sauteed garlic in butter first, and skipped the salt and pepper (but did add garlic salt). I also used about 1/3 the amount of pasta the recipe called for. Next time I'll try adding chicken or scallops.

I have now made this twice and both times it was excellent.  It tastes like a truly authentic alfredo sauce.  In between my two times making it I tried another alfredo on allrecipes which called for parsley and fresh garlic.  While it was not awful, it failed in comparison to this one.  My ratios: 1/2 the pasta (24 oz. is too much), 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup parmesan and 1/2 cup romano cheese.  This will be my only alfredo recipe from now on. Delizioso!!

Very delicious recipe, but not the best. What I did to make this recipe even "more" was that I put in a couple tablespoons of plain cream cheese, and a couple grape tomatoes, and baked it in the oven with cheese on top.  What I didn't like about this recipe is how buttery it is. After you're done your bowl/plate, you can see the grease marks on it. Also, not enough sauce is made in my opinion.

liked this very much and super easy.  didn't have fettuccine, so used cheese tortellini and added chicken, sprinkled with mrs. dash that i sauteed in butter and garlic and steamed broccoli.  tossed it all together and it was very yummy dish.  prepared the alfredo, as one other user commented, using less butter and didn't have heavy cream, so substituted 1/2 & 1/2.  it's a keeper.  thank you for sharing.

I left out the garlic salt and ended up adding more cheese.  I had to thicken it with just a bit of cornstarch too.  All said and done, it was delicious (what's not to love about cream, butter and cheese?!), but I won't use this recipe again.  If you make the sauce from "Creamy Pesto Shrimp" but add some more parmesan and leave out the pesto (and shrimp!), you end up with a perfect alfredo that does not need to be thickened with anything.

I love this recipe!!!  I am not a cooking genius but this recipe is practically no fail. I even ran my finger along the sides of the bowl to get every lost drop of sauce! I am planning on pairing this with seared sea scallops tonight ..... YUM!!

I think I added too much cheese so the consistency was a bit off. It is definitely not a healthy dish, but I'd say it's a very good recipe for Fettuccine Alfredo. Great comfort food!

I was just looking through the pantry trying to find somthing to eat, came across some Fetticcine noodles, and i was like "hmm i should make my own sauce" so i got on google and found this recipe. This is to die for, i didnt really change it, probably added a bit more garlic salt. but it was sooo good and so amazing i texted my boyfriend and said hun you have to come over. and so he did and he loved it. GREAT recipe. defintely a must try.

Very buttery sauce!!! Definitely going to take the reviewer's advice and cut the butter in half. Heavy cream is definitely better to work with than half and half. Sauteing garlic beforehand made it taste better. STIR REGULARLY. Otherwise great recipe.

this is the best alfredo recipe that I have tried.  I did buy blocks of parmesan and romano and grated them myself.  I think it makes it much more rich.

Wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing. A rich and comforting dish perfect for cold weather. We had friends for dinner last night and paired it with the Arugula, Fennel and Orange Salad (also on this site), which turned out to be a great combination: the pasta being smooth and creamy, the salad being colorful, crunchy and sharp sweet.  I invested in good quality chunks of romano and parmesan for this recipe and it was well worth it. Instead of garlic salt, we did add some cloves of minced, fresh garlic and then salted to taste with regular salt.  You just cannot compare fresh to bottled when it comes to Alfredo sauce. One is the real deal, the other just a substitute.

Very good.  I added fresh minced garlic sautéed in butter.  Made it even better with a grilled chicken breast that had been marinated in olive oil, garlic and Italian seasoning.

I think this was awesome. It was easy and quick to make, and only needed a minimal amount of ingredients. I made this for company last night and they asked for the recipe. I did double the sauce recipe because I like a lot of sauce of my pasta. I also took some suggestions from others and added nutmeg (a neat little trick). Served with grilled chicken and some steamed broccoli. My only little sad part was that it didn't reheat well today. The butter separated and it became kind of lumpy. It still tasted great but didn't look pretty. LOVED IT. TRY IT

I thought this was very good, my only problem with it was it wasn't very creamy. I added some fresh garlic to it as well, and the taste was very good, I just wish that it was a bit more creamy.

It was a pretty easy dish to make. I made it for my family and they really liked it. Next time I'll add more heavy whipping cream to make it more saucy and add some shrimp for more flavor.

I love this recipe! The only thing I would change is use whole wheat Fettuccine and garlic powder instead of salt. The cheeses give the sauce a salty flavor but the pasta sucks it all up and changes it to a nutty, buttery flavor that complements it well. White wine and chicken go well with this also. Hope I helped!

I usually pair down the ingredients because I'm only making it for two - 1 cup cream 1/2 stick butter & 3/4 cup parm with a little on top..and don't forget the garlic powder...but essentially if you want good alfredo...not jarred alfredo you need butter, cream, and parm!!!!! Great recipe!!! Finally someone who knows their alfredo!!!

First off, 24 ounces of dry pasta is too much!  I love this with angel hair pasta. Da Vinci pasta brand works well (fettuccine or angel hair)

Try this:  after making sauce, put in over a dozen raw shrimp and cook until for another 10 minutes. It makes the sauce sweet and extra delicious!  Better than restaurants!  Also, I put a little more parmesan then this calls for (maybe equal the amt of romano).  Always a hit with or without the shrimp.



Suggested meal: Goes great with parmesan broiled tilapia from this site or a nice filet mignon and side of steamed broccoli!!!  mmmmmm

I've tried a few recipes like this, they don't come close to the flavour and ease of this one.  I add some sliced mushrooms along with red and green pepper chunks and diced tomatoes.  Its amazing if you portion it out in bakeware and melt some mozarella on top until it turns a hint of golden brown.

Out of this world! Identical to Olive Garden. Only had half a pint of heavy cream, added 1/4 1% milk and turned out great still. Husband raved and raved! Will make again.

It was too salty and bland.  Maybe I would try it next time with unsalted butter and more garlic (I added two cloves this time).

Of course, I've eaten Fettuccine Alfredo before, but never made it.  As I was stirring the butter into the cream, my arteries were screaming to stop, but I persisted, and the result was delicious.  Although I hate when people rate recipes after they've made numerous permutations, I have to say that I added peas (added them frozen to the colander and thawed/cooked them while draining the pasta) and leftover chunks of Christmas turkey.  However, I think the important part of the recipe to rate is the sauce, which does get 5 stars for ease of preparation and excellent taste.  I had lemon juice on hand to add in case the cheese wasn't melting nicely like some other reviewers mentioned, but never needed it, the sauce came together beautifully (even despite my yet-another addition of some shredded pizza cheese).  Thank goodness I made this recipe before New Year's diet resolution time!

Very good. Definitely follow the package instructions to make sure you get the right amount of pasta. I made this for my parents, brother, and boyfriend and they all loved it.

I could literally feel the fat cells heading straight for my love handles, but that didn't stop me from eating it. I added mushrooms sauteed in white wine and italian seasonings (recipe somewhere on this site) as a nice side dish, though next time I might mix it in. I also added a 1/2 cup of milk to the sauce at the end to make it creamer. Yum yum.

I have never made homemade alfredo before and was worried it would come out horrible, but I was so happy with the outcome!  I accidentally bought whipping cream instead of heavy cream (though I am not sure of the difference) but it still tasted delicious!  Other than that mix-up, I made it exactly as the recipe says.  I am adding this to our family favorites and will make it often!

This IS to die for!  It was so easy and awesome.  I doubled the recipe and made it for my whole family/extended family, and added sauteed chicken to it, and it was amazing.  We're all Italian, and it was on the money for us.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Never again will I buy another pre-made jar of alfredo sauce. I made a mess while making this, but the taste made up for it. I added some chicken with garlic and to make it a little more healthy (but not much, ha!) I used whole wheat spaghetti and it was still great. I will be making this again for sure, but it will be a while do to all the calories. :)

The Name says it all! The only thing I changed is I added chicken. I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces and cooked it in the pan with the butter before I added the cream. It got rave reviews from my husband and  my kids loved it too. I will defenitly make this again.

This recipe was so easy! I did change some things around. I did equal amounts of butter and cream (1 cup each) I also added 2 tablespoons of flour to the cream before melting the butter and I increased the amount of the cheese. Great starter recipe!

This tastes awesome!  I usually add 1 sm clove of garlic, which is super yummy.  I have yet to perfect the whole creamy sauce thing, but the taste makes it worth it.  I realized tonight I have been using shredded cheese instead of grated...not sure if that makes a difference...but still super yummy even if it looks a little werid!

Wow! This was "To Die For". When I told my Italian husband what some of the reviewers had said he was doubtful but after he tried it he was as impressed as I was and I am really picky about fetuccine alfredo. Thank you so much for this recipe!

My guests loved this recipe with the following changes:  reduced the fettuccini to one 16 oz. pkg., reduce butter by 3/4 cup, omitted garlic salt, used all parmesan instead of romano.  Sauted a pound of chicken breast strips and 5 cloves of chopped garlic in olive oil; added to sauce before serving.  Due to the HIGH fat content, this recipe should only be used for special occasion dinners.

This IS to die for!  I used 1 lb. of fettucine, and it was still a lot.  We added chicken breasts cooked in garlic and butter, as suggested by another viewer.  It was a great addition.  My ever so picky daughter said she'd never order it in a restaurant again because this is so much better!

Tasted extremely good.  I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings but used 8oz. fettuccine. I gave 4 stars because the leftover sauce separated. Next time will try to get by using less butter. I will make again but only enough for one sitting.  Thanks for the recipe.

This sauce was very good! I made some changes as I went along (less butter, more cream, added cheese to taste rather than measuring). I also used a mix of shredded parmesan, romano and asiago cheeses. 
My only complaint is that it does not reheat well at all. I am thinking the less butter that is used, the better the sauce would reheat?

This is a great recipe for alfredo sauce.  I have been looking for one for a long time and this was the best I have found so far.  I adjusted it a little to my liking, a little less butter and a little extra cream and both cheeses.  My family loved it!

Great and simple recipe. My family loves fettuccine alfredo and my youngest daughter is asking for it again today. So I am making chicken alfredo from this recipe. Thanks for making me a great chef! Also, I didn't change a thing just increased recipe to fit my hungry bunch.

This is an exceptional recipe. It is very simple but the best i've tasted. Made it just like the recipe but added a pint of the cream and a little more butter to increrase the sauce as the pasta absorbs the sauce quickly. A great dish.

This was soooo much better than Olive Garden! Marinated some chicken in chardonay and grilled before adding to the sauce.  This was very, very filling.

Very good, very fattening.  I did scale it down to suit our family so we would not have leftovers after reading the reviews about leftovers..  Next time I want to try a half cup of butter with a half cup of fat free cream cheese to make it more healthy.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

I made this for an "Italian Night" potluck dinner and it was a hit.   I couldn't believe how easy it was.  It took me about 1/2 hour and I tripled the recipe.

The name certainly fits the recipe!  Absolutely delicious!  Tastes exactly like the Olive Garden alfredo. 
Thanks for the great recipe!

My sauce never thickened completely but tasted great!  I served on a bed of bowties with some broccoli and grilled chicken on top and a roll on the side.  Yum!  And the house smells great!  Will try again to get sauce to thicken.  I found a convinient blend of grated parmesan and romano cheeses near the grocery store deli area--this saved me having to buy the two differnt kinds!

OMG!!! I'm not even a huge Alfredo fan but this was by far the best I've ever had!!! Wasnt too impressed with the left overs but straight from the stove it's perfect. Great recipe if you're having company.

This was my first attempt at fettuccini, and although it tasted very good it was also exceedingly greasy.  The sauce seperated almost immediately!  I'm going to try a different recipe next time.

Well I have to say that this recipe tasted pretty good, not the best I've had though. the presentation is pretty poor-- it comes out very greasy. You literally have to serve it right away because once it starts to cool down from the medium heat, the butter seperates and its not too pretty when you see what fried butter looks like. I would say cut down on the butter, there is no need for that much.

This was AMAZING!  We had our Pastor and his family over for dinner and fellowship!  Rave reviews all around.  Everyone LOVED this alfredo dish.  I added three roasted chicken breasts-shredded, 3 mushrooms-rough chopped, 1/4 cup yellow onion minced, and 1 Tbls. ea. fresh Oregano and Basil.  After cooking chix...sauted rest of extra's in butter.  Added it at the very end.  (NOTE: Also used Linguine instead of fettucini.) DREAMY!!!

Man, I thought I totally botched this recipe when I accidentally threw in some cinnamon (It was in a similar looking container to to the garlic salt)  But this recipe was so deliciously cheeshy it was invulnerable to my small error.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Will die for agian!  Great tasting sauce.  I like to use fresh nutmeg when I can to enhance the flavor, and the consistency is perfect.  I decided to use unsalted butter as the cheese contains a lot of salt, and it turned out fine.

I've tried quite a few recipes rated as 5-star recipes and have been disappointed with some of them.  That is definitely not the case with this one.  Absolutely terrific.  The best fettucine alfredo I've ever had.  Girlfriend agrees.  Thank you so much, Erin!

Amazing, and devine. That's how I would describe this dish. The best part is the simplicy in making it compared with other Fettuccine Alfredo recipies. The only thing I would do differntly is to add more garlic. But that all depends on tast. For a dish you are sure to get raves about, try this.
Thanks for the recipie.

Totally delicious and very, very quick!  I sauted half of a finely chopped onion in the butter then cooled it down before adding it to the cream.  I also doubled the quantity of cheese (I used all Romano).  We ate it with Slow Cooker Lemon Garlic chicken from this website and a green salad and it made a perfect dinner.

This recipe was very easy to make and tastes great, BUT, I think you should use less butter. 1/2 cup would probably be better, it wouldn't seem as oily. And that amount of parmesan cheese makes the sauce very salty. I will definitely be making this again....with a few minor changes.

Thats the way alfredo should taste! We followed other peoples advice and added fresh garlic, and grilled chicken. The chicken was marinated with butter, garlic, and italian seasoning and grilled. We used two breasts.

This was really delicious! I added fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt, a little more Romano cheese to taste as well as some grilled chili peppers and chicken. I recomend the chili if you like a little southern Italian bite to your alfredo. I will most definitely make this again.

My husband LOVES alfredo sauce, so i decided to try this recipe. It was SO GOOD, but oh so rich! and not good for leftovers(when reheated the butter seperated and it was this globby mess), so eat the whole thing the first night. I would  make this again!!

Just like it says...TO DIE FOR!!!  This was so easy and soooooo good.  I added some grilled chicken and served with garlic bread.  Definitely not a healthy meal, but the flavor is well worth the calories.

this is the best recipe i've encountered.  the fresh cheeses and heavy cream cannot be compromised.  i first chopped several (no less than 7) cloves of garlic and cooked them with chopped onion before adding the other ingredients.  i used 1/2 c of butter to ensure the sauce's thickness.  very rich, but wonderful!

An average recipe for fettuccine alfredo.  Nothing special about it.  Good for weeknight meals.

I added sauteed onions and peas to this recipe, and cut back on the butter a little bit. My husband said it was the best fettuccine alfredo he'd ever had. Thank you so much for the recipe! I'll definitely be making it again.

This turned out well, but my sauce was a bit thin.  I think I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loves Fettuccini Alfredo and this met his approval, but it wasn't as good as he gets at some favorite restaurants.

Great recipe!  I left the sauce and pasta separate, had individuals spoon it on themselves.  Leftover sauce reheated great the next day on the stove (low setting) and just tossed it with freshly cooked pasta!

Add about 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley for color.  Some sauteed mushrooms also work well mixed in.

My all time favorite is red lobster's cajun chicken pasta. I really didn't think anything homemade could add up to the yummy flavor...boy was I ever wrong! I sprinkled some cajun spice over some chicken breasts and grilled it. I then added it to the sauce, stirred it in real good and poured it over the linguini. Everyone loved it, even my picky four year old kept coming back for bites. We thank you for sharing this delicious recipe with everyone!!

Fabulous! Thanks to all the other reviewers. I've tried other 5 star recipes that were horrible. This is a great recipe, so easy and just delicious. It's as good as any i've ever had in any of my favorite restuarants. Thanks again.

We loved this recipe and found it easy to prepare.I will keep it in use and pass it on to a few lucky friends to enjoy also.  I added broccoli and diced chicken pieces and not quite as much pasta. It came out delicious, better than any restaurant could make.

This is one of the best -- if not the best -- alfredo sauces I have ever had. But I agree with the rest of the reviews -- it does not reheat well. If anyone knows a way to reheat this recipe effectively, I'd love to hear it!

1-11-21 I made this Fettucine Alfredo last night for a small dinner party and everyone really loved it.
They all thought it was flavorful but mild and not so heavy and overly rich like some recipes they had eaten in the past.
I tossed in some broccoli and will use it with chicken in the future. I will definitely be making this one again.

Since I'm a vegan - with food intolerances, no less - this is how i changed it:
1) I'm using Trader Joe's (or Tinkyada) brand fettucine - it's gluten and wheat-free (and oh so good!);
2) instead of heavy cream, i've used non-dairy milk in the past - tonight i'm gonna try it with a combo of non-dairy milk and olive oil substituting for the heavy cream; and
3) for the cheese, i use either Daiya products or Bragg's Nutritional Yeast - believe me, they both get the job done.....

it's still SO GOOD!!

This was awesome. I didn’t make any changes to the recipe, but I did split the alfredo in half. I added shrimp to one half and baby portobello mushrooms to the other half (not sure how they would have tasted together lol). I used fettuccine nests instead of boxed pasta and I swear that made a huge difference, too. My husband raved about how wonderful this was. Will definitely make this again ??

Very rich and addictive. I messed up and used salted butter. With the garlic salt, salted butter, and the cheese already tasting salty it came out way too salty! I had to double batch it to dilute the salt. We ate pasta for a week but at least it was good.

I never tried to make an Alfredo sauce before.  It couldn't have been easier...and so delicious.  Currently "testing" it by dipping some fresh bread into the sauce on the stove.  Can't wait for the family to gather round the table to enjoy it. Thanks!

This was great. I did however add a little twist. I added lemon, viniger and switched out the  two cheeses for chedder. Then instead of cream i used soy milk and switched the noodles for rice. 
I would recomend this recipe all day long

This was quick and easy but very good. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and was happy with the result. Will be making again.

I made this recipe as stated. I did use Irish butter and only parmesan (I didnt have any Romano) the sauce never thickened and tasted very gluey. If I am willing to make again I will not use irish butter and make sure I have Romano on hand,

I really liked this recipe, however somehow I didn’t make a enough sauce. I also added a bit of oregano, basil, and garlic salt to the dish after! I enjoyed it with some hot sauce :)

Tried so many recipes for fettuccine Alfredo and decided to prepare this one. It was fantastic. After reading the reviews, I made a couple of revisions. Used one garlic clove minced, unsalted butter, and half cream half half n half. I used a cup of hand shaved parmesano reggiano in the butter / cream mixture. When the pasta was cooked, squeezed half a lemon over the shaken pasta to cut the butter. Also topped the dish with precooked chicken, more parmesano reggiano, and a dash of chopped parsley. Save some pasta water in case you need it to cut the sauce when blending in the pasta. Enjoy!

My whole family loved it! I used Alfredo as the base for my seafood pasta. The whole family loved it! I added a McCormick’s garlic butter shrimp scampi seasoning packet, seared scallops, and shrimp. This Alfredo is perfection by itself or to build off of. We will make it again for sure.

It is now my go to Alfredo sauce.  One night I made it and kept it separate.  Made fettuccine to go with.  But for the son I made chicken and for my husband and I, made sautéed shrimp in garlic.   We all got a wonderful meal that night.

A+ recipe! I love leftovers and didn’t want to be left with half of a box of pasta so I added roughly 50% more of the Alfredo sauce ingredients and made the following tweaks:
32 oz (2 boxes) dried Alfredo pasta, 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) salted butter, 2 1/2 cups heavy cream, no salt (based on other reviews), 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1/8 - 1/4 tsp. grated nutmeg (use sparingly!), 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 1/4 cup Romano cheese, 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese, fresh lemon juice (about 1/3 of a lemon). My family LOVED this dish. Definitely follow the other reviewers' suggestion to squeeze in some lemon juice after adding the cheese and to cook the sauce a full additional 10 min. to thicken it up. It's not that much more work and these two steps make the consistency of the sauce super creamy. The lemon juice didn't make the sauce taste lemony once it was mixed in with the pasta. Also, reserve about 2 cups of the pasta water if you're going to save half for leftovers. (Stir in the liquid just before your refrigerate.) The pasta will soak up all that cheese sauce and you will need the extra liquid when you reheat it. I love garlic, but this recipe has so much flavor from the other ingredients, it didn't need it. Added a little nutmeg which was fabulous. Served this with spinach (sauteed in butter and garlic, and finished with a squeeze of lemon juice) and garlic bread. Huge hit!

Yummy!! Great recipe. Tasted it at about 6 hours and it wasn’t flavorful at all with that 1/2 tsp of salt. Added 1 envelope of Lipton dry onion soup and it was transformed!! Total cooking time is 8 hours. A hit in my home on this cold fall night.

I like my Alfredo nice and saucy so I might make more sauce or use less pasta next time but this was really delicious. I used half and half because that's what I had in the house and it was perfect and thickened up nicely.

Okay, so please keep in mind that i’m just a teen cooking for myself and my siblings lol. So to try and make something new i decided to try out this recipe. the process was easy (i did brown some garlic on top of following the recipe) making the sauce took longer than i had anticipated so i just pet my cat and watched it closely. after some music and lots of kitty pats later it was done. it smelled amazing. i thought it was yummy (not the best ever it just taste like regular ole’ fettuccine) but my siblings said it was good so success?

Bar none PERFECT recipe!  My husband LOVED IT!! I decided to add clams to mine for an extra seafood flair to accompany the grilled salmon. I steamed six medium sized clams and folded them into the pasta sauce just before serving. A total winner that won't let you down, Serve hot! :)

Extremely easy to make!! I had dinner made in less than 30 minutes. I had 4 hungry children. My son who is 3 is the only one who didn't like it and that's ok. This recipe was the BOMB. I can't wait for my husband to come home and try it. I want to eat the entire bowl! I couldn't find Romano cheese but walmart had an italian cheese with Romano in it and I went for it. I don't know if it made a difference but it was still delicious. I will be sure to make it once a month as it is fattening...1 entire stick of butter. I'll be working out later :)

Sorry for those who feel this recipe is not for the health conscious, but I've so far lost 125 pounds on Keto, and this sauce is TOTALLY KETO!  I just replace the pasta with Miracle Noodles.

Rated this recipe exactly as it is written.  Absolutely delicious.  
FYI:  Use Unsalted Butter.  Also, note that this recipe calls for 3/4 pint heavy cream which is equal to 1 1/2 cups.  If you do not have 'heavy cream', then TO MAKE HEAVY CREAM:   Mix together 2/3 cup whole milk (3.25%) and 1/3 cup melted unsalted butter.   Bon Appetit

Turned out awesome! We grilled some boneless chicken breast and blackened some shrimp to go with it, warning this will place you in a food coma.

I made this exactly as recipe said. My son in law said it was better than what he has had in a restaurant. Everyone loved it. I did however add chicken.

My fiancé and I made this together one night because we were in the mood for Alfredo but we wanted something quick and easy. We made this sauce, and along with some grilled shrimp and chicken put it all over a bed of fettuccine. They aren’t kidding when they say this is to die for! And it is oh so easy to make!! I will be making this again for my mom for her birthday because she tried it last time and absolutely loved it. We all did. 5/5!

One of the suggestions was to add two cloves of garlic to the butter/cream at the start and this made all the difference. Might look too soupy when you add the fettuccine but do not strain any away. I did that and it was a mistake. The pasta absorbs some of the sauce and the final result is perfect just as instructed. This is better than any restaurant dish you can find.

This was the first time I used this recipe, I added 2 tablespoons of cream cheese when making the sauce. I also made shrimp along with the chicken. My family liked it so much, everyone had seconds! 
Some of us added  grated parmesan to ours as well...

AMAZING RECIPE

Unfortunately, my sauce just ended up a congealed mess at the bottom of the saucepan.  I’m still trying to figure out why — I gradually added the grated cheese and stirred constantly, but no smoothing took place.  I performed the recipe exactly as written.

I've been using this recipe for a while now and my family loves it! I add a bit of ginger garlic paste, oregano and basil to the mix to add a little bit of flavour. I also mix in veggies from time to time.

This recipe was alright. The sauce was pretty good; although not the best, it wasn't the worst. The fettuccine was an interesting pasta pair with this particular sauce recipe.

3 because of few reasons:  1 1/2 pounds is to much pasta the sauce isn't enough and I added 1 full pint cream. Next time guys add 1 lb and use 1 full pint. 2nd, to much butter maybe 3/4 at most is enough butter. And it's hard to find Romano cheese I only found A mix of Romano and parmesan pre grated.

Sooo good. Used only 16 oz fettuccine noodles. Ended up with too much sauce. Scooped out about a half cup sauce then added shrimp and garlic powder to my liking. Side of seasoned broccoli and wine goes perfect with this recipe!

The cheese absorbed all the cream and separated from the butter so I had to add a bunch of milk (no cream left) to turn it back into sauce. It could’ve been something I did wrong, though. Everyone liked it despite the additional milk, so it all turned out okay. I’ll still make it again knowing I have to add milk to the sauce.

So easy and so good! I made exactly as is, although I didn’t have garlic salt so I used a little minced garlic and the flavor was excellent! This is a keeper!

Definitely a 5 star recipe. I didn’t add any salt because I added little pieces of ham. I also used unsalted butter. I had several family members over for dinner and we all loved it. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. I’ll definitely be making it again. I love Alfredo and this is one of the best sauces I’ve ever had. Thanks again.

It was excellent doing the recipe as documented.  I did make a modification - I stove topped cooked 1 lb of raw shrimp and added to the sauce when I added the noodles - it was great.  I will definitely make it again and will make a few adjustments- I'll still add the shrimp, but will also add some spinach.  Also I will add a little more heavy cream.

Flavor was great, but I had a problem with the butter separating from the mixture after heating sauce. I did sauté garlic in butter before adding cream. Wonder if Pan was too hot to add cream. Not sure what went wrong here.

Really good. I did take advice from other reviewers and sauted the garlic in butter first, added a little nutmeg, added 1 T cornstarch and lemon juice when adding cheese to make it creamier. It was really tasty.

I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of adding a pinch of basil and  oregano. The cheese separated as it cooled so I kept it hot until serving. It was fantastic! My picky husband and kids all had seconds!

On evenings out My husband has ordered a meat dish over F.A several times.  Even in decent places, I've always found those meals lacking luster in both flavor and texture.

Sunday he requested I whip him up a dinner of Fettuccine Alfredo here at home... To keep the meal from being a mega-disappointment meant some serious shopping in town.

I used imported Fettuccine Noodles with Deli grade Romano and Parmesan cheeses.  There's only a few items required so I purchased the best I could lay my hands on.

My hubby is NOT loose with praise for any dish.  Until Sunday Night.  Plus: It was the first time I've tasted F.A. anywhere that I didn't find bland...  

With a top flight pasta dish, the next thing to do is put it with Italian Prepped Sausage, Grilled Chicken or Ribeye to place atop.

I wanted something quick to make for a no meat dinner,  I gave this a try.  My husband is a fan of  fettuccine Alfredo And he enjoyed it. I’m not a big fan of noodle dishes but it was OK. Probably won’t make it too often because I tend to like more nutritious meals.  Made just as directed.

Loved it!   Will definitely make it again.  I had leftover turkey so I added it.   I made a 1/2 recipe as we are not big eaters.

Good start but if you don't put a few scratches of nutmeg on it, you are missing out on something wonderful.

Sioux, grated is the 'powder' cheese, the kind in the container you shake on the food.  Shredded is the bagged cheese .  Hope that helps.

i didn't make this but maybe someone out there can answer a question I have....when the recipe says 'grated' Romano/Parmesan does it mean the dry powdered stuff, or 'real' cheese SHREDDED from the block?  I think if usually means the latter...my husband (who fancies himself a kitchen chef!) thinks it's the green jar stuff.  I use the 'grated' in a can frequently, but I think a better differentiation needs to br made between 'grated' and 'shredded."  Help!!!

This alfredo recipe was everything that it promised.  Amazingly delicious.  The only problem was that I should have doubled the recipe for my family of 5. We each took a serving and then we each wanted seconds, but it was just enough for one serving each. Believe me,  next time I'll double it.

This is “to die for” ! I did use more cheese than the recipe called for because I m a major cheese lover and I only had a 16oz box of pasta, So I unfortunately didn’t use some of the sauce, but it was still seriously yummy! A definite go to when I do fettuccine Alfredo! I might cut back on the butter a little.

I sauté minced garlic in the butter for a bit before adding the cream and finishing the sauce otherwise as written. My family gets crazy excited about this sauce!

This was a really solid recipe. The only thing I did differently was (per the suggestions) sautéed fresh garlic in the butter before adding the cream and adding a bit of cornstarch to the cheeses.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Very similar to my wife's inherited recipe.  A cajun, she sautes onions, finely diced bell pepper and celery (cajun trilogy) before adding the cream.  This is really just the basic cream sauce + cheese incorporated in so many cajun dishes.  Crawfish, shrimp or crabmeat as well as even chipped sausage, beef, chicken, bacon or pork and pasta or rice can be used in aany combination to produce absolutely gourmet quality dishes!

This is a great recipe!  I omitted the garlic salt and added minced garlic. Next time I think I would also only use one pound of fettuccine noodles. However, it has amazing flavor and is very easy to put together. I added some chicken and it was VERY tasty!!  Will keep this one on my favorites!  Thanks!

I made this as stated only omitting the garlic salt and adding 1 tsp. minced garlic. It is fabulous! It tastes fresh, creamy, cheesy and very flavorful. I served broccoli on the side, and added some cooked bite size chicken to mix in but not much, to make it a total meal.

I made this with the exception of garlic salt. I added minced garlic instead. I also added a shredded rotisserie chicken. The sauce tasted amazing in the pan. But, when I mixed it with the pasta, all the saltiness seemed to disappear. I’ll definitely try it again, with the garlic salt.

Made the dish as directed. Overall, I liked it. It was best when served immediately. The cream and butter separate in the leftovers and leave nothing but a greasy, unappetizing mess. Definitely don’t make ahead, or plan to eat leftovers. I opted for unsalted butter, so I could control saltiness. Glad I did, because it was plenty flavorful without the extra salt. Only ended up needing half the pasta listed.

My husband absolutely loves this fettuccine Alfredo recipe! I have made it for company as well and everyone raved about it. It is super easy and tastes better than anything we have gotten at a restaurant (and 100 times better than anything we’ve had out of a jar!). Definitely my go-to Alfredo recipe!

Perfect base recipe to go off of but not duplicate it to a T. I read the negative reviews and laughed. Those have to be people who have no idea how to cook at all without following a recipe. I made this but modified some of the ingredients; i.e. the butter. Added some fresh garlic and corn starch as one reviewer suggested. Eyeballed the salt but also taste tested it each time to make sure it wasn't too little or too much salt. I used just Parmesan cheese since that's all i had on hand. Turned out PERFECT and super creamy. My four kids and hubby ate it all up. We added some chicken and broccoli to our pasta. My husband said it was better than any Italian restaurant he's been to and he's super picky with Italian food!

Easy and quick. However, it was really salty and I only added a dash of salt and garlic salt.

My niece requested Italian food for Christmas dinner this year and I made lasagna using Kay's Spaghetti sauce recipe from this site it was excellent. I also made Chicken Fettucine Alfredo using this recipe. It is a very good Alfredo sauce the only change I made was by adding a bit of Italian Seasoning, used unsalted butter and added a little sea salt with the other seasonings also used fresh minced garlic but no garlic salt. It is rich creamy sauce that I will make whenever I want Alfredo sauce. It is very simple and fairly quick to make also. My niece was so impressed she wanted the recipe. She was surprised at how simple it was to make. She's 22 and doesn't do much cooking as long as her dad is around. He also got the recipe from me. Thanks for sharing the recipe, I have a granddaughter that loves anything Alfredo so I am definitely going to make it for her also.

Love this sauce! I changed it just a little. I sauteed one garlic clove in a little olive oil, cut the butter in half and added a little extra cream. It is amazing!

Everything you're looking for in a fettucini Alfredo. Creamy, hearty, leaves room for baguette bread to dip. I served with broccolini.

I used a pre-grated parmesan/romano, not a fresh wedge of cheese because I didn't have it on hand. I was afraid it would be grainy and it was slightly but it was still very delicious! I bet it's much tastier with fresh cheese. I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I will definitely be making this recipe again, maybe with shrimp and a green veg next time. My very picky kids devoured it.  Thanks for sharing!

I make it exactly as recipe called for and then at the end I stirred in some grilled chicken.  It was delicious!  My whole family (even picky daughter) ate it up!  This would be an easy great dish to make for large gatherings too!  I will make this again.

I also thought this was a little salty while making the sauce but after adding the noodles it was just right! Loved it. Will make again. 
I used the whole pint of cream & used all parmesan because it what I had on hand.  I did what others did & added a bit of garlic & pinch of nutmeg, I  used only 16 oz of noodles..I like my fettuccini creamy.
Great recipe! Thanks

I'm very picky when it  comes to alfredo sauce. This was good, but I felt if it had too much butter. I'll make it again,  with less butter.

Love this recipe. I've made it several times now.  Personally I use 1/2 cup of butter as 1 cup seems to be too much and it pools at the bottom of the dish.

First of all thank you for your recipe - I lost my original recipe and you were as close as it came!!  However, I use fresh garlic! I used 3 cloves of chopped garlic and added when the butter and cream were heating.  MAKES A WORLD of difference - it lifts the flavor - the person that added lemon juice - not necessary when you use fresh garlic.  
 I would like to add, that this is a great recipe to make the sauce ahead of time and gently reheat.  The flavor really develops over night.   Gently reheating the sauce of course over low....

Loved this, easy to make recipe. I added two chicken breasts cut up and seared in butter, because, hey, there wasn't enough butter already,  :) and used freshly made fettuccine noodles boiled for four minutes. I like a little extra garlic, so added two cloves chopped fine. the family loved it.  My husband asked if we could have it again with shrimp. An encore means it is a great recipe!

This was awesome! Consistency and flavor were great, but it's a very heavy dish. I used 16 ounces of noodles and kept the sauce amounts as stated by the recipe. It was perfect that way! I added grilled chicken breast strips and used minced garlic instead of garlic salt. OMG, wonderful!

Very rich, thick, and creamy. I wanted to try this version because it had no flour. Turned out nicely! The BF wanted chicken and mushrooms in it....so I just tossed those in the sauce with the cheese so they could all melt together.  ( cooked chicken and raw sliced shrooms) Topped with fresh parsley because it's pretty! He loved it! Didn't change anything else but to cut the recipe in half. Thank you! will totally do again!

I made several changes on this recipe. I only used less than half the butter and added 2 small pressed cloves of fresh garlic to sauté before adding the cream. I also spiralized some fresh zucchini and sautéed that separately in olive oil. Mixed the sauce with the pasta and spiralized zucchini. Topped off with fresh garden basil, parsley, few fresh diced tomatoes, fresh black pepper, and red pepper flakes! Amazingly delicious! Nice crisp to the zucchini! Hope you love the modifications to this recipe as My family did! Yum!

I decided to try this recipe and it was amazing. I did however grill some chicken breasts with some tomato basil seasoning and add it to the sauce and the finished product was amazing.

It tasted delicious, but the recipe calls for you to make three times the noodles you would use to mix with the alfredo sauce. You end up with about 6 servings of leftover Fettuccine.  I recommend cutting it down to only 8oz. of dry pasta, if you don't plan to make 3 times the sauce.

I tried to leave another review and accidentally submitted before it was finished. This is our all time favorite but I have tweaked it some. I like to add Italian seasoning and actual garlic cloves. I also add about a cup of mozzarella. It’s always super cheesy and so delicious!

Definitely the best Fettuccine I have had in a while. My brother and parents loved it and I will be making this recipe again. Next time, I will probably put in less butter, although it tasted amazing as it was. Not a recipe for those who don't like rich flavors. Almost as good as Olive Garden Alfredo. This was my first time ever cooking pasta, and I was extremely pleased.

I've made this several times and it has always been great.  The first time I stayed with the recipe.  Liked it very much.  I now toss in broccoli or chicken to give it a different take.  It is one of my go-to comfort foods.

It was overall very good but the sauce was extremely thin and there wasn't nearly enough sauce as compared to how much pasta there was. I'd like a thicker sauce I think. The flavor was good.

This is the best Alfredo recipe I have come across.  The entire family loved this.  No need to add any garlic salt, it has plenty of flavor you don't even miss it.  As the original person who created/posted this recipe states, it is not a healthy recipe but it is well worth the splurge to enjoy.  Will indeed make again!

So easy and so good!!  Followed recipe exactly, except that I used only shredded Parmesan cheese, as that's what we had.  And I cooked only one 16-oz box of pasta...  Absolutely delicious.

Wow...I had no idea that Alfredo sauce was so easy to make. Husband loves Alfredo and he really enjoyed this. We had a rotisserie chicken leftover, so we cut up some of that to put in it as well...delicious!

Excellent!  I made it for two, so I reduced the butter and cheese to 1/4 cup each, and the heavy cream to 3 oz.  I served over zucchini noodles.. Yumm!

This recipe was simple and tasted AMAZING!  I made it as the recipe states, then added my own sauteed mushrooms to the  mix, along w/chopped  seasoned chicken w/garlic. I've tried many alfredo recipes, but this one tops them all and my hubby and adult son agreed!!  Pure deliciousness!

Could use a little more spice for taste and something to thicken it up a bit. But overall a big hit at the dinner table.

Oh boy!  This is it...look no further for the rich decadent fettuccine alfredo that you love at the better restaurants.  No need to pay their high prices anymore, just make it yourself at home.  I added some shrimp and mushrooms.  Wonderful!

This is the best tasting alfredo sauce! My daughter usually orders fettuccine alfredo when we eat out and she thinks it tastes better than any restaurant alfredo sauce.  I refrigerate any leftover sauce and reheat it the next day with some heavy cream or milk.  It's delicious!

Delicious!   Took reviewer suggestions to add minced garlic, added dash nutmeg and pepper.   

Sauteed minced garlic in the (salted) butter, added light cream.   Let the mixture boil up very slightly.   Turned heat down and added cheese last b/c it really did thicken the sauce up.

Saved pasta water to thin it as needed.   My picky daughter even loved it.

I made this with one and a half stick of butter.  I also used 1 1/2 cup of cheese.  I used a whole pint of heavy cream and added a couple of pinches of nutmeg.  I used a pound of fettuccine instead of 24oz. I didn’t use garlic salt but used a pinch of garlic powder, although  I believe this can be omitted along with the salt and pepper.  It was delicious with my additions.

Top notch recipe. Really good if you add high quality or imported cheeses to it. I admit though I scaled back on the butter and heavy cream a bit.

This comes out perfect every time! I use granulated garlic instead of garlic salt and use all parmesean cheese because that is what I always have on hand. I have learned that if you melt the butter first then slowly pour in the cream while whisking that the butter and cream come together well and do not separate again. This is a family favorite and we make it often! Thank you!

I made this for me and my husband to use left over roast ham. He said you've done it again! Blown my mind with food lol. 
I used parmigiano reggiano imported from Italy as well as fresh garlic cloves as opposed to the garlic salt. I also added a shallot, mushrooms and left over honey roasted ham from Christmas day.  I agree with one of the other reviews when you taste the sauce at first it is really salty but once added to the pasta the flavour is perfect. Will make again!

Delicious! The only thing I would change which my first mind told me was cut the butter in half. One cup of butter is wayyyyyy to much it was greasy and the noodles did not soak up that extra greasiness. I did add Mozzarella cheese to mine other then that it was great. I think 1/2 cup is better is all that’s needed.

This is an excellent recipe. Be prepared, it is very rich and NOT low calorie at all!!  But I was able to reduce some of the butter and use both half and half and reduce the cream.

Followed the exact recipie but it turned out to oily. I believe the recipie calls for too much butter. Besides that, it was great!

I made this for the first time tonight for my aunt and uncle. The only thing I did differently was use sautéed minced garlic instead of garlic salt, because we prefer minced. It was very flavorful and creamy, arguably the best alfredo I've had. And super easy, I made it while coordinating chicken, pasta, asparagus and broccoli while 3 of my 4 kids were rampaging around my ankles.

This was a huge hit with family and friends. I have previously made it with store bought grated cheese, the change to freshly grated cannot be over-stated, it made a huge difference. It can be combined with chicken or shrimp easily which makes it a great meal for sharing

We absolutely loved this. I sautéed 3 garlic cloves and some onion in 1/2 the butter before adding the remaining butter and cream. I also added some smoked salmon. It was so delicious, but so rich I couldn’t eat very much of it!

I think next time  I will keep the garlic, onion, and smoked salmon and  try cutting back the butter to 3/4 lb and increasing the cream a bit, as well as subbing half and half for the cream.

I've been looking for an authentic alfredo recipe for quite some time. Many call for cream cheese and that didn't seem right to me. Glad I found this one. Made according to the recipe except I didn't have garlic salt so used garlic powder. It was delicious. In future I may cut the butter a little and squeeze in a little lemon juice. Thanks Erinmarie!

I made this wonderful recipe just as it is written.  No substitutions.   I get tired of all the people who rate a recipe BUT change every other thing in it.  How then can you rate that particular recipe if you change it, as it is not the same recipe any longer .  Okay I digress.  Off my soap box now.  My family and I loved this. It is yummy.  I gave it five stars b/c it deserves five stars.  It is also easy to make.

So my philosophy is to make the recipe as printed the first time and if the base is good then modifications can be made. This made a very good and rich sauce. Contrary to my philosophy I did change one thing not critical to the sauce and that was I used a 16 oz package of pasta vs the 24 oz called for. This recipe made two meals for the two of us. Having not read the other reviews, this may have been covered but next time I use this recipe I will try a little less butter.

My husband always gives his opinion on any new recipes I make by rating them a 1 to a 10 (he’s a picky eater). Fettuccine Alfredo is his favorite dish when we go out to eat so I decided to try this. He took one bite and said, “you’re making this again! It’s a 10!” It was amazing. I followed the recipe except I couldn’t find just Romano cheese at my grocery store. I bought a 2 cup bag of shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses and just used the full bag as we love extra cheese.

The written recipe calls for 1 lb of butter, but the video calls for 1/2 lb. of butter.  I used 1/2 lb.  Wonderful.

fresh garlic and nutmeg are a must in this classic Italian dish. I also like to finish the dish with a sparse grating of lemon zest.  I'm not a fan of garlic salt as the cheeses are salty enough and garlic salt tastes too processed to me.

I added a bar of cream cheese during the melting process, and thickened the sauce with a tablespoon of corn starch once the cheeses were melted.   With the changes this Alfredo sauce was amazing!!!!

I made this as a vacation treat and it was delicious.  It was so good, I ate it for breakfast the next day.  I haven't done that since I last had Alfredo from my favorite restaurant almost 20 years ago!  I made it with shrimp but changed nothing else.

I made this recipe just as it is noted. Oh my gosh! This is the best Fettuccine Alfredo I have ever tasted!! I cooked diced chicken and added some parsley for some additional color to the dish.  My family loved it!! Served it with garlic bread and a salad. Very easy to make and oh so good!! Will definitely make this again!

I added just about 1/3 C cream cheese because I had it on hand. I added a can of sliced mushrooms and had marinated -tenderized sliced, grilled chicken (in Italian dressing), to the cream and butter at the end stage for a few minutes. Sprinkled parsley on top and a spring of basil to garnish. I would make this recipe as is without any question, it is so delicious, and I have a very choosey spouse.

I had to make some changes to my sauce due to limitations on what I had in the house, but this is my experience:
I used approximately 1.5 cups of the grated parmesan/romano mix (the sort of powdery stuff you buy in a shaker off the shelf, not the dairy case), about 1.5 cups fat free half & half mixed with approximately 1/4 cup 2% milk, garlic powder to taste (not garlic salt) (1.5 teaspoons?), unsalted butter, approximately 1.5 tsp salt., and dashes of fine black pepper. Once I added the cheese to the milk and butter mixture, it did thicken, although the grainy texture of the grated cheese never went away. Perhaps this would not be an issue if I used a different type of cheese product? At any rate, we ate it and it was very good. Due to the grainy texture, however, I would not serve it to company. I served it over spaghetti pasta, topped with sauteed fresh mushrooms.

I followed a couple of tips.  I put a teaspoon of cornstarch in with the grated cheese along with garlic powder, nutmeg and pepper.  I added a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice when I added the cheese to the cream and butter.  I am guessing that it was amazing without these additions, but it was amazing with these additions.  I am in love with myself for making this and Erinmarie for posting the recipe.  Thanks Erinmarie where ever you are.

Love, Loved it. It was so delicious and simple to make. It tasted better than my favorite Italian restaurant. I added a little more fresh garlic and used Kraft 5 Italian cheese in addition to the Parmesan. I will be making this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

loved it!! i couldn't find any Romano cheese when i went shopping so i used up the Monterrey Jill i had at home. turned out great. I also did not add the garlic as someone else said as its not authentic Italian,  I did however add in a splash of white wine..I also tossed in some shrimp....YUMMY!!  Over all would def do it again.. Maybe use chicken next time.

Sauteed onion and garlic in butter. Sauteed chicken in butter. Sauce was very easy, used a little less butter. Delicious, will definitely make this again.

IT was a good recipe. One I’ll have to save calories for haha. I cooked some spinach, mushrooms and green onions in a tbsp of butter prior to melting the butter into the cream. Some pepper and we were good to go. I’ll stash this away for a family dinner. Definitely a keeper! ****i also only used a lb of pasta and it was definitely plenty***

This is fabulous.  I did as others suggested and used half the butter.  I also used half and half, since that is what I had and it turned out perfectly.  Love, love, love this.

This is similar to what I do.  If an Alfredo recipe has either egg or cream cheese in it, run for your life!

You could call this "To Die From" Alfredo. Way too much fat, to the point where it is unappealing. There are so many ways to make delicious creamy pasta sauces without all that fat. I am more interested in the healthier tricks than cooking with pure butter and heavy cream.

This is an authentic Italian recipe. It is a high caloric recipe. For those who are complaining about the calories, sometimes I reduce the calories by using 1 cup half n half, 1/2 stick butter, 1/2 cup to 1 cup of grated cheese according to taste. Just warm the butter/milk mix and whisk in the cheese. Do this on very low temp and it will thicken nicely. If its too thick, then just add a little milk. It is delish the original way and is meant to be a treat.

This is a perfect Alfredo recipe.  Love it!  I receive a diabetes newsletter and scientists have found that fat is not the enemy of the heart, carbs are.   They recommend NOT eating low fat foods.  When my husband had his heartattack, his cardiologist also stated carbs are the problem .  So, we don't worry about the fat, we moderate the carbs.  We eat our pasta al dente and as diabetics, we watch our blood sugar.

It was pretty good but real garlic sautéed in the pan on low with the butter is a must.  I don't even own garlic salt or garlic powder!  Also, using fresh ground pepper makes a world of difference!

This recipe is just like mine,  but with garlic.  The garlic adds an amazing flavor! I have no idea why I've never done it.  I served it with grilled chicken and steamed broccoli.  Yum!  Can't wait to make again

I added a little garlic to the sauce-- Also added some cooked chopped chicken breast as well as a cup of steamed chopped broccoli--Do not add any corn starch (like another review said) -It ruined my sauce and had to make over

This is the best alfredo I've ever had.  Even better than some restaurants (I think it's the romano cheese that's to thank for that).  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup butter, and it was still delicious.

My husband "I think this is one of the best Alfredo sauces I've ever had". This really was delicious and not over-powering or without flavor. I added chicken to mine and it was really good. Also this us really easy to make for how good it tastes. Adding to my "go to" recipes!

Great recipe but there is too much butter! I have made this recipe for 3 years and I always use 1/3 cup of butter and even then it is still very greasy. I can only imagine what it is  like with a full cup of butter.

I have been making my own recipe for alfredo for about 15 years and everyone is crazy about it, even my friends that don't like alfredo... I have seen many recipes and none are as close to mine as this one... my only differences are I don't use salt and I use minced garlic instead of powder... I am sure this one is amazing like mine!!! Thanks for sharing it!!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious big hit with the family. Reminded us of an old Italian restaurant we used to love and haven't found alfredo any where else like it until this! I think the next time I make it I will put some shrimp for sea food lovers

This dish was AMAZING! I made it for my friend and our kids and everyone licked their plate clean! It was super fast and easy to make but tasted like I'd slaved all day in the kitchen! 

TIPS:  I used less pasta than the recipe called for and added a bit more Romano and Parmesan cheese.  

I'm making it again tonight for my boyfriend!

This tastes pretty good but it calls for WAY too much butter and cream.  I did the recipe with 3/4 of all of the ingredients and the alfredo was still drenched in a liquidy soup at the bottom, even after a night the leftovers of being refrigerated.  I would suggest for others to try it with maybe 1/2 of the liquid ingredients.

Pretty darn good - reduced the recipe for 4 servings.  Like many say, not for those counting calories!    I'll make it again.

I have made this several times.  Really good but very unhealthy!

I always a bit of extra garlic and also some dried parsley.

Very good - similar to a recipe someone gave me years ago, but it got lost. I used Asagio cheese and half & half since that's what I had on hand and It was terrific.  Also added a pinch of nutmeg. I don't know where I picked that up, but, it seems to enhance the flavor somehow.

Fantastic.  Followed recipe exactly except added more garlic powder.  I don't care what you say, Alfredo Sauce needs garlic.  This will be my go-to Fettuccine.

My 12 and 13 year old grandsons wanted to make dinner  while they were staying with me.  They went on Allrecipes and found this recipe for Fettuccine Alfredo.  They made it exactly as the recipe was written.  Everyone thought it was excellent.  I will be making this recipe again.

This is so tasty! I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so I substituted 4oz. cream cheese and 8oz. evaporated milk. I also didn't have any Romano cheese, so I used more Parmesan instead. Still turned out delicious! I'll definitely be making this again!

WAAAAAYYY too much butter.

I know, that sounds like blasphemy. I love butter! But not when it literally pools at the bottom of you're bowl...seriously. So. Much. Butter.

Add half the butter and you've got a solid recipe.

Better than Olive Garden's! I made this for a birthday dinner party. All 14 of us (ages 14 to 77) loved it! Because I tripled the recipe, it took a long time for the cheese to incorporate, but it eventually did--and beautifully. I used grated parmesan, shredded parmesan, and shredded parmesan/romano.

I used 1 pint heavy cream because I wanted an extra portion or two. I cut down the butter to slightly less than 
3/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and a pinch of pepper. I used 1 cup parm-romano mix and added 1/4 cup of just parmesan.

After the sauce was on heat for a few minutes and hadn't thickened after adding the cheese, I removed about 1 cup of the sauce and whisked 1 tsp cornstarch into it. 

Instead of adding this back to the pot with the rest of the sauce, it became my first two portions. I sauteed some of the cooked fettuccine in a pan with very little olive oil and added this thickened sauce to it. Was perfect! Didn't need any extra cheese. Served with garlic bread covered in parmesan.

Will definitely make this again! Didn't change the sauce at all - it's amazing! My boyfriend said it's moved into my top 3 dishes. I added breaded chicken, 5 cloves of garlic, and thin slices of caramelized red onion to the dish but it would be perfect as is.

This was the best fettuccine alfredo I ever had.  Made it exactly as written but did take the advice of a previous reviewer and added a little corn starch to the grated cheese and a little fresh lemon juice to the sauce.  Turned out creamy and delicious.  I also only used 1 lb. fettuccine noodles as I was using it as a side dish and it served 6 generously.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This is the most amazing fettuccine I've ever made! It' delicious and easy as well. I made it with chicken, I'll for sure be making this dish again probably try it with shrimp. It's super simple to spruce up as well. I will say it's not the healthiest of recipes so if you're trying to slim down I would not recommend; but if you're trying to indulge this recipe is the one to try!

Magnificent recipe. Everyone loved it. Truly the best i have tasted. Didnt change a thing except the amount of pasta i cooked. 16 oz instead of 24 oz. Quite filling and also very fattening. The cost is a bit high too. But very delicious.

This is the best Fettuccine Alfredo ever! I added and extra 1/4 Romano cheese , doubled the recipe and kept the extra sauce on a very low burner. I also make a Chicken Marsala/Fettuccine combo that is out of this world. Mine is so good that my daughter said she can never order it in restaurants anymore because she will only be disappointed. My comments to those who say it is too much butter and not thick enough is are you sure you used 3/4 pint heavy cream=12 ounces and only 2 sticks of butter? Make sure you cook it long enough stirring frequently once the cheeses have been added. Also to those of you who love Olive Garden - FORGET ABOUT IT - you will never be happy with real Italian food. Other than their bread sticks their food is awful.

This is great! An entire meal for 14 bucks that will be good for a couple of nights. I added oven roasted chicken breast to it. I don't usually make this but I kid you not it taste better than I've had in restaurants.

Yum!
Very easy recipe and the taste was outstanding.  We like lots of garlic, so I used 2 cloves of fresh grated, more to our taste instead.

This is amazing and so simple!! So I honestly just used the whole tub of shredded Parmesan cheese, whole pint of whipping cream and added a little bit of extra shredded mozzarella. It worked great and we loved it!!!

This recipe is great.  Still beginner cooker with a family of four and they enjoyed it.  Little nervous cause didn't have real Romano so I used the store bought parmesan and Romano grated mix and added garlic.  Also added chicken and steamed vegetables.  Took a while for sauce to thicken but once it did WOW it tasted incredible.  Forget the Olive Garden.  Kelly's Garden is the place to be.  Thank you for the recipe.

This dish is amazing even though i have done some things wrongly i think. I didnt cook the pasta for long enough so there were areas that were still hard and i probably added too much cheese for the sauce since it turned out chunky but that is my own wrong doing, overall it has an amazing taste

This was great.  Took the advice of others.   Only used 1/2 stick of butter. Also used 1% milk. Used more than 3/4 c of milk to desired thickness.  Sautéed shrimp in the butter, salt and garlic and then took them out and added the milk, corn starch and some lemon juice.

A little too much butter for my taste.  Half would work fine.  Very easy to make.

I liked it for the most part but way too greasy! I cut it down to 3/4cup (1-1/2 stick butter) and it was alot better. Added about 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to the mix and used fresh clove of garlic.

I first made this recipe for my mother's birthday dinner, and have continued to make it for the past two years or so. It is delicious and easy to make, but I adjusted the recipe and halved the amount of butter. I also adjust the pasta to sauce ratio because I enjoy a lot of sauce on my pasta.

I made this for Christmas dinner for my boyfriend's family a few years ago and it's become a yearly tradition. Even our picky niece likes it! 
I use brown rice Noodles and fresh herbs. I toss in some minced & whole garlic Cloves, some  Rosemary and a bit of Thyme  too. 
But we don't just wait for Christmas, tonight it's getting served in my freshly baked bread bowls!

Used 16oz of noodles instead of the called for 24oz, and that worked out nicely.  Also, added one whole chicken breast cut into 1-inch cubes, and that was wonderful.

this fettuccine alfredo WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and very easy to make. my 14yo son requested fettucine alfredo with chicken for his birthday dinner. I just sautéed chicken breast in avocado oil in a separate pan and let the kids add to as they wished to the alfredo.  every morsel was devoured.

I made this with smoked salmon and peas over fettuccine for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was great! It was my first attempt ever at making homemade Alfredo sauce, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but my guests all loved it.  The only change I made was to use fresh garlic rather than garlic salt, only because I didn't have garlic salt on hand.  I usually try to stick with pretty much the exact recipe as written by the author the first time I make something, and this was wonderful!

I made it for a birthday party meal, doubling the recipe. There wasn't quite enough Alfreda sauce to cover the amount of pasta recommended, but the sauce was good. I did add garlic while melting the butter and a dash of nutmeg.

Yum!! So rich and creamy! And easy! The only change I made was I added 1/2 t of garlic salt instead of just a pinch. I didn't add any additional salt. I added 1 t of freshly cracked pepper. I made this with gluten free pasta. If you do that, I would definitely recommend rinsing your noodles! The water/starch that was left over on the pasta muted the sauce. Still good but not as flavorful. I will definitely be doing that next time!

It works.
I actually cut this for more of a healthy recipe. I used Half 'N Half, 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 tsp dried parsley and 1 1/2 cup shredded cooked chicken.
I added more half 'n half if it started getting thick.

It was really good. I substituted Munster cheese in my version. There was a lot of butter in the dish. Next time I make this I think that I'll use half a stick less butter.

Love it!! I approximated and used 2 Cups cream (closer to a full pint) and increased the cheese slightly, to accommodate. I had a feeling I was going to need extra sauce when I read the ingredients ;) I think garlic when I think alfredo, so I added 3 large cloves, crushed and minced, to the sauce. I didn't know that wasn't traditional - thank you for the education and, more importantly, thank you for the A-M-A-Z-I-N-G recipe!!! My 9 year old son's eye's got so big when I gave him a taste test...he ate about 8 oz. of pasta covered in this heavenly sauce and a "tree" of broccoli, plus a couple pieces of roasted garlic bread. Love, love, LOVE and yes, it's rich and delicious!!! He dipped Every piece of food in this alfredo.

I've tried several alfredo sauces and this is THE one! It's not heavy like some and if you like thicker, you can just add equal amounts of the cheeses. Will definitely try with other pasta types... would be good with penne and salmon w/adding peas. Would be good with bow tie pasta and chicken. Several different options.

I made this for my family of alfredo-lovers and they all loved it! One even claimed it was the best they have ever tasted! Although one thing I noticed is that mine was extremely salty after added the salt, so I would actually leave the salt out of the Alfredo unless you have tasted ot and it absolutely needs it. Other than that, the sauce took about 15 minutes to thicken up and was relatively easy! I will absolutely make this again for my family!

It was not bad, however not what I was expecting. Too much butter and cheese.  It's a good recipe if you like really buttery sauce.

The sauce was wonderful. I added two cups chopped fresh broccoli, half a red pepper, 2 small zucchinis(julienne), and cooked at medium heat for 5 minutes. I also replaces the garlic salt with minced garlic.

Delicious!!! I made this and it was awesome. My 5 year old gobbled it up and she is a very picky eater.  I did make a few tweeks...I put the cream into the butter instead of butter into cream,i added freshly chipped garlic so I needed something to sweat it in....it was garlicy butter heaven in this sauce! I also added some well chipped parsley to the sauce.

I made this dish tonight! It is very easy to make and is delicious.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt since that was in my pantry. Even my picky daughter ate this fettuccine. serve with some garlic knots from.wal mart . This will be a staple item in our household.

Unfortunately there was just too much butter in this recipe for me. I could taste it and it really put me off.
I added some shredded chicken, and although it was yummy I would never make it with so much butter again. It seperated a little and it was not pleasant.
In addition having a recipe that calls for cups and then pints is confusing. I assumed the measurements meant US pints, not UK, but if you're measuring the other ingredients in cups then just keep it consistent.

By far the best fettucine alfredo I've ever had! Even better is that I made it thanks to this recipe. I don't think I can eat fettucine alfredo elsewhere anymore. That's how much I loved this. 

The only adjustments I made to fit my palette is only using half the recommended amount of butter, adding chopped sautéed garlic before beginning the sauce, and including asiago cheese to the mix. My family loved it! Leftovers were also just as delicious if not better. This will definitely fulfill all of my future fettucine alfredo cravings. So quick and easy.

Turned out great and my dinner party loved it. I added a little white wine and lemon juice to the sauce, as well as pepper and parsley. I also cut up and cooked some chicken tenderloins that I browned separately and added to the sauce.

This was an amazing Alfredo sauce!  
I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I added a dash of lemon juice and nutmeg.  I used unsalted butter and suated garlic before adding the 1/2 & 1/2.  I used no salt.
I added left over rotisserie chicken and used penne pasta.  My kids devoured it!

Very rich and tasty!.  Halved the pasta and added more cheese - the sauce was still runny.  The end result was also a tad greasy.  Will try the cornstarch method next time and use a little less butter.  Added rotisserie chicken the night I made this, and then shrimp the next day.  Not only was the pasta even better the next day, but the shrimp outperformed  the chicken. Almost forgot - I added a TON of salt to this. Don't be shy with the shaker.

This is amazing! I am really picky with Alfredo sauce.  A lot of Alfredo sauces don't have enough flavor or they get really gummy.  This has tons of that cheese flavor that makes a really good Alfredo sauce, and it was the perfect consistency.  I tend to like my Fettuccini pretty saucy, so I poured a lot of it on my noodles, but a little goes a long way with this recipe.  My husband wants me to make this again this week!

Not exactly to die for, i decreased the butter, still very buttery and heavy, i added garlic and shrimp and topped with parsley. Good but leaves you feeling like you overindulged.

Super easy and SO GOOD! I can't believe I've been afraid of making Alfredo sauce for this long. I will consider this a "I'm tired and need something easy to make", because it's so easy! the grocery store had a 5 oz romano and Parmesan mix, I used one of those for 1lb of futtucine and it came out wonderful.

This recipe served as a great base alfredo recipe.  As with others, I jazzed it up a bit by doing the following:
I used spinach fettuccine noodles.  Just one box (12 oz) was plenty.
I had some italian sausage on hand that I sauteed first in a large pan and then removed the meat to let drain on paper towel.  Then I added about 3/4 tsp minced garlic and mixed mushrooms to the pan to sautee on medium-low.  At that point I added the butter and cream, per the recipe.  
Meanwhile, I steamed some broccoli.
I omitted any additional salt, garlic salt, seasoning salt from recipe - the cheese was plenty salty enough for our taste.
Once the butter and cream melded with the mushrooms and garlic, I threw in a big handful of fresh spinach and minced basil.  Then i added cheese, broccoli, and sausage back in and seasoned with pepper.
To serve I sprinkled a bit of grated parm and fresh basil on top.  It was great.  My husband loved it!

I made this for about 5 months now, and I LOVE IT! But it is true, this is not for people paranoid about clogging their arteries! : )  But if that is you, try to use half a stick of butter. My mom liked it.

Have been using jar Alfred sauce for years out of convenience and decided to give homemade sauce a try.  This recipe is super simple and very tasty!  Yes, price-wise it may be more expensive than jar sauces, but the taste is worth it!  For those with sensitive salt palates you may want to forego adding any salt, as the cheese provides plenty.  I served this with grilled shrimp marinated in garlic and wine - YUMMMM!

The biggest change I made was to cook the sauce in the same pan I had cooked chicken In. The chicken I later added in with the Alfredo coated pasta. By cooking the sauce in same pan as the chicken it added a level of flavor from the garlic and spices I used to season the chicken (side note: adding red pepper flakes is a great way to add spice and bring a new flavor dimension to the sauce. Just don't over do it!). It's kind of like I deglazed the pan with the Alfredo sauce giving the whole dish a delicious cohesive  flavor. Also this sauce recipe coats the pasta and sticks to it very well. My family loves this and it's easy and quick to make which makes it and A+ recipe!

Fabulous recipes.  I made a couple of adjustments.  I added one clove garlic while melting the butter in the skillet.  I reduced butter to half.  Loved it, very good, can never eat it out, will just be making my own sauce.

Best Alfredo sauce ever, but use 1/2 or maybe 3/4 of the noodles called for if you like a good amount of sauce on the noodles.

I made this today.  I made it with blackened garlic lime chicken.  My husband said it was by far better than any restaurant Chicken Alfredo he's had.  My 15 year old requested Chicken Alfredo for her birthday today.   She gobbled it down.   Said it was awesome (she can be picky at times).   I didn't add as much butter and I added  fresh, diced fine, garlic.  My birthday girl gave it a 10.  That's a win!

This is almost exactly TGI Fridays recipe except no garlic salt. If you are going to put garlic in here don't use garlic salt use fresh garlic. I know that is not traditional italian like using "garlic salt" but the cheese and butter will add plenty of salt. I also add a tablespoon or two of pesto to mine depending on your taste. Fridays called that Fettuccine Alfredo with Herbs.

Used 1 stick of butter. I also added a few cloves of Garlic sauteed to give it more flavor. I had to literally pour butter off the second day left-overs.

The flavors in this simple dish were amazing.  After reading a review that said 2lbs of pasta were too much, I tried 1lb, which turned out to be too little.  Next time, I think I will try cooking longer or with more cheese, as the sauce was a bit thin.

This recipe was great! Added some pan-fried chicken cooked in olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper and yum! My stove-top broke in the middle of cooking it and I actually baked it as a casserole. It worked really well. Cooked it at 375 but covered it with tin foil so the cheese wouldn't brown--like making mac & cheese. Had to mix it at the end but absolutely delicious. I also added 1 tsp minced garlic. 

BTW you can make pasta in the microwave. It takes twice as long as the stovetop and I had to break the fettuccini up into smaller pieces to fit in the microwave bowl but it worked just fine.

My family was impressed with how great this turned out! I was looking for an easy recipe for Alfredo and I have found it. I substituted heavy cream with half and half and I only had Parmesan. It probably would have been even better if I had all the ingredients. This is a very simple recipe that every new cook should have in their repertoire. I'm going to teach my girls his one!

This turned out okay, but not great. I found the consistency to be a little gritty. I follows the recipe exactly. I will try it again, to see if it was some sort of error on my part.

Delicious! When I first read the recipe I was not convinced because it has only 3 ingredients; cream, butter and parmesan but I saw how many great reviews it had and decided to give it a try. This is the only fettuccine recipe I use, its simple and has an amazing taste! I use all kinds of pasta not only fettuccine. And there is no need to change or add any ingredient the recipe is great as it is.

Loved it.  

I just added my own swing to it. 

Added a tad more whipping cream, hot chilly flakes, flat parsley, and I cooked boneless chicken with half an onion, garlic and mushroom.  Everything chopped finely. 

Came out amazing. Everyone was happy :) 

Love to see more of your recipes

This is my go to recipe for fettuccine alfredo, easy and excellent.  It's easily scaled down to one pound of fettuccini.  I left out the garlic salt, which is fine, or you might sauté minced garlic in the butter.  I used all grated Romano, because it's what I keep on hand.  There are endless possibilities for add-ons.  I'm going to try some sautéed mushroom tonight.

I have made this at least 3 times now.  It is so easy that after a hard day it's great to throw it together.  I normally like a little more parmesan cheese than directed.

Its an easy n delicious recipe (though high on calories ; )). My kids gobbled it down all. I made almost one 6th of everything as a trial. Though i used egg noodles (4 oz) n cream cheese one  triangular slice of happy cow cheese n mozeralla cheese  2 tbsp bcz i had these cheese only at hand. i used home fresh cream n 1 tsp of garlic too coz i like garlicky taste. Just one thing for me i feel butter was a tad bit too much for calorie watchers. Rest the best. Now made it twice. I t love that it was supereasy n kids approved, so will make it again too. I love easy n least ingredients recipes like this one. Thumbs up!

For a healthier version of the sauce, I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. My whole family likes it. Overall great recipe!

Made this today and it was sooo good! It was my first time making an alfredo sauce. It took a little longer to thicken than I anticipated, but it was worth the wait. Yum!

I'm giving it 5 stars because the sauce is spot on with the measurements. I was only disappointed because my Romano cheese was terrible. I've had great pecorino Romano, and what I bought for tonight was over fermented. I should have ditched it and that was my fault. I will make it again with the pecorino Romano I normally buy, and it'll be a huge success. My sweetheart made it too (we made it together for Valentine's Day via FaceTime) and his turned out divine. He got good cheese!! We both added minced garlic instead of garlic salt and also added shrimp. Great recipe! Thank you!

We love Alfredo so I decided to try this for my teen son and his friends.  I barely got any of it!  They told me it was restaurant quality or better.  In fact my son has requested that I cook this for him and his girlfriend tonight for their Valentine's dinner.  I took someone's advice and used a small amount of cornstarch to thicken the sauce and it was perfect.  The other thing I will most likely do is cut down on the butter a little. Otherwise this is an excellent recipe. Great flavor!

Super easy & delicious recipe. I changed the serving size to 4 & used 16 oz of pasta instead. I didn't have fettucine pasta so I used angel hair. I added frozen spinach & used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (because parmesan cheese is already salty). I also added extra cream so it wouldn't dry out because I wasn't serving it right away.

My 12 year old is a very picky eater but he loved this recipe. Now when it's his turn to choose dinner he always asks me to make "the flat noodles with the delicious white sauce"!! Took another reviewer's suggestion and followed the pasta servings on the box. Also the only thing I changed was substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream. It was delicious! Lost count on how many times I've made it!

This was the first time I had made a homemade sauce for pasta. It was amazing!!! I substituted the dash of garlic salt with one clove of garlic chopped up very finely. My husband—who does not really like alfredo sauce—tried it and actually really liked it. I will definitely be making this again! Easy and amazing!

This is a very quick, easy and great recipe for alfredo sauce.  The basic ingredients are good but I added some Cajun spice and red pepper, WOW!  I even added a pinch of nutmeg once, yum.  Set some of the original aside and try the Cajun & red pepper.  I like my sauce on the thick side so added a small amount of corn starch.

Very good recipe. I used more of the Parmesan cheese rather than the Romano, and it was delicious. Very good recipe and I recommend this to anyone who loves Alfredo sauce.

I substituted real garlic and let it fry in the butter for a few minutes, then added the cream. I also used a 3 cheese blend that had Asiago, Parmesan, and Romano cheese. It was AMAZING.

I cut down on butter to half and used only parmesan cheese as that was all I had.  Also used fresh garlic and no added salt.  Added italian sausage.  My family loved it.

Make sure you start the pasta he same time you do the sauce. This recipe makes enough sauce to cover about 18 to 20 oz of pasta.

Add fresh ground black pepper and freshly grated nutmeg to taste, it's hard to go overboard on them. also add 1/4 cup of freshly chopped parsley, and heaven awaits! Especially if you make it for your date!

I wasn't sure how this would turn out since I didn't have 3/4 pint cream.  I ended up using about 1/2 pint cream, 1/4 half and half and 1/4 c milk.  I did sprinkle some cornstarch in the cheese for added thickness and it worked.  I also only used romano cheese  since that is all I had on hand.  I also minced 2 large garlic cloves and sauteed them with the butter before adding the cream/milk mixture and it turned out delicious!!  I will be making this again for sure.

Hands down the yummiest and easiest alfredo sauce! The only thing I do differently is to use a three-blend cheese (Asiago, Parmesan & Romano). Make sure you use unsalted butter so that you can control the amount of salt in the recipe. I find that the grated cheese melts smoothly and more thoroughly than the shredded (for those using fresh cheese).

This is a great sauce.  Made exactly as written.  Used ultra-fine pre-shredded parm and romana cheeses.  At first was a little salty, so added a tiny bit of lemon juice.  Excellent!

I've made this a few times, and it's pretty fool proof. I usually make it with one 16 ounce package of pasta. I cut the sauce recipe by 1/3. I use 2/3 C butter, 1C cream, and 1C parmesan and/or other cheeses. Its more than enough for the four members of my family. You can add 3/4 of the noodles to the sauce to start, and add more noodles if you like a bit less sauce.  It's also good with a cut up rotisserie chicken breast mixed in at the end. I've also tried adding a few pieces of chopped bacon in the sauce as it cooks (by itself- not with chicken.) I find you don't need to add much salt because the cheese has a lot of salt in it. I just use a dash of garlic salt and a pinch of smoked salt. It's simple, easy, and filling.

I made this recipe last night and it was a HUGE success!   I did use 2 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder,  and about a tsp of dried basil.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is amazing!  We had a girls night and made fresh fettuccine and ravioli.  We all made different types of sauces and I was in charge of the Alfredo Sauce.  I grated my own cheese.  The only thing I did different was I omitted the garlic salt and instead smashed a garlic clove and cooked it in with the butter/cream sauce.  I removed it before adding the cheeses.   Very Yummy!  I will definitely be making it again.

It is really tasty.  I agree that it could do with half of the butter although i haven't tried to make it that way.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I loved the taste of this sauce, and I made it as directed.  I took off one star only for the fact that it takes 2 sticks of butter and a lot of heavy cream, making it less than ideal to eat on the regular.  I grated my cheeses myself, which makes for a meltier cheese perfect for making a creamy sauce.  Do make sure that you use it all or throw out the leftover sauce, as it separates in the reheating process.

I made the sauce as is with the exception of using that last bit of cream. It was very good, but like others suggested I will use half the butter next time...and there will be a next time.  I served with oven fried chicken breast and a small salad.

I love this recipe! I use whipping cream and sweet butter (I am trying unsalted) I generally get a 3 cheese blend (parm, asiago, romano) to add a little flair. Add a little crab, chicken or plain depending on your mood.
My SUPER picky daughter gobbles this stuff up! Making it for my birthday dinner tonight

This is amazing melt in your mouth recipe and is a must try!! The sauce is amazing the only thing I've changed is using chicken flavored better than boullion and adding more than what the recipe calls for and adding some pepper.

This was so simple to make. I just made this and it is delicious!!!!!!  I did use a little more Parmesan cheese, about 1 1/2 cups because I didn't have Romano on hand, but it was still great. I also used a small amount of dried Italian seasoning. My daughter also loved it. I cant wait to make it again with the Romano cheese.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was great. I took the advice of a few reviewers and reduced the amount of fettuccine noodles cooked, added minced garlic, a pinch of nutmeg, did not use garlic salt- used garlic powder instead, and I added Asiago cheese. It was perfect!

It was okay but lacked some flavor.  I know most recipes for fettuccine alfredo call for basil and/or parsley.  I think this may have made a difference in the overall flavor had it been in there.  I think Stouffer's frozen is tastier (at least to me).  I also bought Land of Lakes cream and butter  and used pasta made in Italy.  Just my take.

I absolutely loved it!!! though note to self I store the sauce separate from the extra pasta so it reheats properly. But all in all its a downright amazing recipe! Just use low heat to make sure nothing overcooks and everything mixes right!

I really love this recipe! It is absolutely delicious! I skipped the salt and pepper. I used half the butter as well. I also used 1 tablespoon of minced garlic with 1 tablespoon garlic powder. I don't make this all the time but when I do the pan is always licked clean. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was really good! My first time making Fettuccini Alfredo. I cooked up some chicken breasts to chop up and add to the dish. Delicious! It's definitely very cheesy and buttery. Next time I want to add some garlic and herbs to it for a different taste!
Also, if you have leftovers I would recommend storing each serving individually instead of all in one container. When it gets cold, it gets hard and is difficult to scoop out. It seemed to taste better to me after reheating, but there was a lot of butter that melted out and was left at the bottom of the bowl when I finished!

This was the best Fettuccine I have ever had better than Olive Garden. I used fresh Garlic and added a squeeze of Lemon also added some corn starch to thicken more. This is a keeper. Thank for sharing.

I used the bottled parmesan cheese, and it turned out a little gritty, but the cost went down 3 dollars.

I've tried to make alfredo sauce before and it turned out badly so I was worried about this attempt. But honestly this was so easy and came out absolutely delicious! I did add garlic and used asiago cheese because I didn't have any romano. I'm sure that it would be just as good exactly as written though.

Very delicious and easy to make. I used one pound of fettuccini instead if two pounds and had a good balance of sauce and pasta.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt since I was out of garlic salt.

Such a great easy meal.  Was a big hit with teenage kids! I wanted to add some protein, so I sautéed a pound of shrimp and served it on top of the pasta! Will definitely make it again.

We tried this last night!! We did 1/2 cup romano and 3/4 parm instead.  Added a little more parm at the end to thicken a little, but once we added the pasta to the sauce, the thickness was perfect.  This was an awesome recipe I will be using religiously for Alfredo!  Thank you for sharing!! :)

I'm more of red sauce girl however my boyfriend loves Alfredo sauce. Probably because is name is Alfredo. I make this sauce for him and he and I both love it. It's great with a crispy breaded chicken. Using the two different cheeses is what makes this recipe so great.

Just made this 5 minutes ago. It is DELICIOUS. Tastes just like any good Italian restaurant's sauce, however mine turned out watery no matter how much I tried to change that. Luckily it was just made for myself and my sister, so it wasn't a big deal. I couldn't find regular heavy cream, so I used heavy whipping cream, which is fine. I've looked for

Needs a 6-Star rating !! SO-O-O Good !!  Taste just like Oliver Garden and Pasta House.   Really rich and good. Next time I will try 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup - just for calorie reasons.  TRY THIS ONE.

Followed the recipe exactly, and The sauce was really creamy but way way to rich and i would have cut the butter in half. All i tasted was butter. Other than that, its a good recipe.

This was easy to follow and AMAZING! I only tried it b/c people said it tasted like Olive Garden. IT WAS EXACT!!! I think 24 oz of noodles are too much, I used a little under one box (16oz). I also used the whole pint of heavy cream! I was so proud of how this tasted I couldn't wait for my husband to try it!

Excellent recipe! Made this exactly as written and it was terrific. Creamy, cheesy, velvety goodness. At first I thought the sauce was a bit too thin, but it thickened up nicely the longer I heated it. The only thing I would do differently the next time would be to reduce the salt a bit by using garlic powder instead of garlic salt. For those that think Olive Garden is authentic Italian food and that this recipe was not as good as Olive Garden's, pick up a good Italian Cookbook some time. You might be surprised that it's not all red sauce, cheese, and goopy thick sauce. Thanks for sharing this ERINMARIE.

This was really good and easy! I served it with Cajun chicken & asparagus with garlic bread. I didn't use Romano, just Parmesan & it turned out just fine (no Romano). Not quite like Italy but still on point!

Perfect! Add a pinch of nutmeg and some cracked black pepper for a little more zing.

DELICIOUS! My husband said it was the first sauce he did not need extra cheese and it was perfect. Whole family LOVED it! Adding extra garlic and parmesan if you don't have ramano is still delicious!

Everyone LOVED this! Insanely easy- added a touch of cornstarch mixed in with the cheese and it thickened up beautifully- adding this to the rotation! Thank you!!!

Very easy, quick recipe to make and perfect to make for a weekday dinner.  It was so easy to make this I can't see myself going back to the dry mix again.  I added some peas to it for my little guys and they really enjoyed it.

I've used this recipe as it stands, but I also have modified it when I didn't have a certain kind of cheese.  Our house loves butter and cream, so I even threw in an extra Tablespoon of butter.  I cook it with chicken coated parmesan on top.  I substituted the Romano.  Using 3/4 parmesan and 1/2 mozzarella.  It took a bit longer to melt the cheese, but the house LOVED it.

Too greasy and sauce wouldn't thicken. Despite addition of fresh garlic didn't have much flavor.

Very, very tasty. I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of adding 2 bags of steamed broccoli and 2 lbs of sautéed shrimp. I also sprinkled a little bit of Tony's on top. I used unsalted butter at the advice of other. I think the recipe calls for a little too much pasta given the amount of sauce made, but it could be that I like too much sauce. I'd definitely recommend and will make again!

This is a very simple and very tasty recipe. I doubled the Alfredo Sauce so I can enjoy it with other dished later. I used a blend of romano, loccatelli, parmigiano,  and Asiago Cheeses. And added 3 cloves of grated garlic with a a splash of white wine. Absolutely incredible.

Gave it 4 stars because it is not the healthiest, however okay to eat once in a while.  Great alternative to going to Olive Garden and spending a lot more to feed my family.

Followed the recipe and it was divine! "Best they've ever had!" Loved the simplicity! Added some fresh garlic per varous reviews and some garlic salt too.  Sauce cooked down to a fabulous consistency.  Thanks to all that write their reviews and suggestions!  This IS the best tasting recipe ever!  I added some chicken breast and a pound of sliced mushrooms sauted with the garlic and butter.  FABULOUS!!  Thank you so much for posting and reviewing! I appreciate you all!

Only this that makes this alfredo better is fresh pasta! Tried 3 times & is reliably the best I've ever eaten.  Just try not to eat all of it in one sitting!

For this I changed it up a bit by adding in some garlic (minced), broccoli (chopped), tomatoes (chopped), and some Italian season. Very good! My family loved it. Make sure you try this sometime. :)

Loved it. Better than any restuarant Alfredo Fettucine! I used sauted shrimp with garlic and butter and steamed broccoli with it. And used fat free half and half instead of cream.

I did this some time ago and feel lucky to have found it again. My girlfriend loooooved it (she even dared to say it was better than his grandpas recipe).
However, I did some modifications myself because I couldn't  find all of the ingredients:
- We couldn't find Romano alone, so we bought one of those bags with Romano, Parmesan, Gouda, and some other varieties of cheese
- Instead of heavy cream we used regular cream (the thick one)

The rest we kept as it is.

BEST HOMEMADE PASATA EEEEVER!!!

Absolutely AMAZING alfredo! I order alfredo at every restaurant and this is by far the most tasty and flavorful. I added chicken and broccoli to my recipe and cooked 6 cloves of garlic with the butter before I put the heavy cream in. Definitely a tad too much butter (and I love butter). I ended up having to double the sauce since I put in the chicken and broccoli and there was still a lot of butter sitting on the bottom of my bowl when I had leftovers the next day. Next time I'll try 3/4 of a cup instead of a full cup. Still, very very good. I am done with my alredo experiments and finally found a keeper!

This recipe is really good! We put a lot of Garlic Powder in ours but that's personal preference. Really easy recipe, by the time the noodles are done cooking the sauce is ready.

Super good!  Used Parmesan/Romano/asiago combo and went a little heavier on the cheese (1 1/2 cups).  Rich but not "weigh you down" heavy tasting.  Big hit here

Prepared it for Sunday dinner.  My problem was that I didn't make enough.  Great was the only thought that came to mind.  One note use high quality cheese.

This is so delicious!! Thank you for sharing, Erin! I usually serve this with shrimp sauteed in garlic and white wine (amazing) but the other night we tried it with bacon and peas and it was AMAZING!!

Even though some people wanted to use less butter, this recipe is perfect without any adjustments! It's even better with shredded grilled chicken!

This was wonderful. I did modify it a bit. While the butter melted I added finely chopped garlic. I switched the cheese to Gruyere and parmigiano reggiano. (80 to 20 ratio)approx. Added white pepper and a bit of nutmeg........my husband loved it!!!!
I had never made it before, however, I certainly will make it again!!!
thank you:)

Great but I think it might be a little too buttery. I'm going to try again with only one stick. Of course if you like butter then go ahead and use two stick. :) Either way, its really good.

Made this last night and it was so delicious! My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it even though he was stuffed. I also added chicken strips sautéed in garlic butter, but I thought they tasted more like fajita meat and didn't compliment the Italian theme. Might try a different method for adding chicken next time.

Excellent. I used fresh garlic and minced it into the sauce!  Sautéed chicken in butter and let guests add as much as they wanted.

Yummy!  Both my husband and teenagers LOVED this.  I added in some minces garlic and a pack of perdue chicken strips. I only added 1 box of pasta (I think if you add any add'l pasta it will be too dry) It's a definite do-over in our house.

This was absolutely spectacular. I know this because my son who doesn't like alfredo at all had 2 big platefuls! It was creamy and yummy and really hit the spot. I was shocked how fast this was to put together. This is perfect to serve to company or just the family. I was so glad I chose this recipe, it's easy, quick, yummy and requested by my son on a regular basis.

VERY popular with most of my guests and relatively easy, very fast to make.  The people who did not care for it as much (including myself) are used to thicker sauce with more of it.  All in all, if you like the original Alfredo (yes, I'm old enough to have had him mix my pasta at the table in Italy!) this is the one.  If you want a stronger flavor and a thicker consistency, you need to look elsewhere.

This was delicious! I had to improvise since I didn't have two ingredients the recipe called for.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and shredded mozzarella instead of the Romano cheese. The sauce was perfect! I also added shrimp and broccoli. I have to say, I was really impressed. My husband and son are not big on Alfredo but they loved it.  I would definitely make this again.

I love this recipe. It was my first fettuccine alfredo attempt. The pasta could have been better, but that was my fault. The flavour was great.

I made this for 4 and used about 1/3 pound fettucine.  I used store ground parmesan but fresh grated Locatelli as we are romano fans.  Used a bit of garlic powder instead of garlic salt plus I used half sweet butter because the cheeses are salty.  Got rave family reviews.  Great recipe. I will do it again. Thanks.

This was really good!  I had to use basil asiago and parm because I didn't have romano but for the love of pete HALF the recipe!   I had like 2 cups of sauce leftover after using a pound of pasta!  Other than being forced to waste half of the sauce (or else I would have had fettuccine soup) it was really yummers.

Our family loves this and I've made it 3 times prior to writing this review.  I use only parmesan cheese and also add a little bit of cornstarch to thicken up a bit.  It is fattening and delicious and worth it!!  Thank you for the recipe.

Just made this. I added cut up chicken sautéed in butter. Then I sautéed a little garlic with onion flakes before adding the butter and heavy cream. I also used greyere cheese and a touch of nutmeg instead of Romano cheese, but I have made this with only Parmesan before and enjoyed it as well. However, I have some issue with the sauce thickening every time I make it. But still very delicious!

This is a very satisfying and tasty dish ! A little high in the fat content, but worth it. It's a rich buttery, creamy sauce, an easy way to kick it up a notch by adding diced chicken or shrimp.. Mmmm yum!

This recipe was definitely one of the best! The sauce was absolutely incredible! But I tweaked my sauce recipe a little buy adding only 1/2 cup of the butter, and you could taste the butter just fine, so if you add the entire 1 cup of it Im sure it'll turn out way to buttery. And for the parmesan cheese, make sure to add all of it, because I didn't, thinking that it'll be too salty, and once I added it to the fettuccine it wasn't salty enough. But the sauce itself was perfect! And also don't add the sauce to the pasta, just add it on your own when you eat it, that way the pasta wont turn crumbly, and I think it'll taste a lot better too!

I made this last night and thought the flavour was just so so, and  found it way too greasy. If I make this recipe  again I will reduce the butter to 1/4 cup and saute fresh garlic in it first. I thought the recipe overall lacked flavour so added onion powder and nutmeg to  give it a bit of punch.

Absolutely loved this!  I did 18 oz. of pasta and  made 1.5x the sauce.  I added blanched carrots and broccoli and rotisserie chicken.  It would serve 4-6 people with big appetites!  Best for sure!  But I'm sooooo full!

This was my first time making alfredo from scratch and let me tell you this was awesome!!! The sauce looks a little thin at first but it thickens once you put it in the pasta. Not for the weight conscious but I would definitely eat this on a cheat day!!

Good Recipe. Excellent taste. I would cut back on the butter a bit. I took this to work for lunch. After sitting for awhile the butter gathered in the bottom of my tupperware bowl. My husband said the butter at the bottom was the best part but I couldn't eat it after seeing it. As a whole, the recipe was very easy with a superb taste.

Pretty good.  I may have needed turn up the heat (like the recipe says) after adding the cheese, because it didn't all melt in.

You cannot mess this recipe up.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted half the butter, garlic powder instead of garlic salt and mushrooms.  Easy, fast and tasty!!!

Turned out delicious!  I used light cream and reduced butter to 1/2c.  Sauté 2 cloves of garlic, olive oil and some broccoli and tossed it in before serving.  Everyone loved it.

I thought this was a great recipe, and very easy. I made it for friends and everyone thought it was delicious. I wanted it to be a little thicker, so I added a little flour to it to thicken it up. I would definitely make this again.

This was amazing and so easy to make! I have a 3 year old and don't always have time to cook a meal like this... One thing I did differently only because what I thought I had at home was different, was add Garlic Powder instead of Garlic Salt and I used unsalted butter (half of what it calls for). Definitely was not too salty, in fact I had to add a little more table salt because I didn't think it was salty enough. Next time I think I'll try adding some minced garlic to it. I know it is not the true Italian way, but I love garlic!!!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I marinated boneless chicken breast strips in the juices of 1 lemon and 1 lime added curry powder and pepper and minced fresh garlic and let it sit in a bag for 24 hours in the fridge and fried it in a skillet then added it to the sauce and it was awesome.

OMG This is so delicious!! The only bummer is that it doesn't save/reheat well, because we always have way too much and have to toss it. But when it's fresh, it is perfect!!

The flavor was really nice, but it was extremely buttery. I probably had almost a bars worth left at the bottom of the bowl once everyone served themselves. I will probably use half the butter next time and possibly add more cheese and fresh garlic. I think it's a good start to a great recipe. Thanks!

Awesome! Quick and easy. I added garlic and real bacon bits to the butter, sautéed, then added sherry cooking wine and reduced. I add the rest of ingredients and yummy. Kids loved it!

I made this for the first time. Only thing I did differently was that I used a 50:50 ratio of parmesan and romano cheese (1¼ cup). It was pretty good! Although, it's VERY buttery.. too buttery, so I'd recommend using less butter than is called for. Also, beware, it is incredibly fattening :)

While it was good it wasn't the best.  It was just ok. Very bland tasting.  We ended up adding some salt. It had a lot of butter in it;mostly tasted like butter noddles with cheese in it. We stirred in the cheese it called for, but it was having a hard time thickening so we added more cheese.  Still was very bland.  Half of the family liked it.  Wasn't horrible, just not much flavor.

I'm pretty new to cooking and my fav dish is Fettuccine Alfredo.  I though I would try this due to the number of reviews and high rating.  I did a few things different, and I really loved this dish.  It's in my top 3.  I changed the serving to 4 and I added 1 finely chopped shallot.  The other thing I did different at the end is once I had my serving on my plate I added Parsley and Saffron spices.  Everyone had a bite LOVED it.

I cut out half the butter. I was worried it was too salty when I tasted the sauce before adding the noodles, but once the noodles got incorporated it tasted sort of bland. Next time I'll have to tweak the salt levels a bit more. 

I also added the noodles straight from the pasta water to the sauce and the extra starchy water helped the sauce stick to the noodles after tossing with the sauce for a little bit.

Very easy and has great flavour but the cheese would not completely mix in to all the oil this recipe calls for.  If we make it again we'll definitely cut down on the oil!!!

This recipe was great! Very flavorful and delicious. My husband and I made this the other night. Only thing we will do differently next time is use less butter. Was a touch greasy. We adjusted to serving size to 4 and it called for 2/3 cup butter so we're going to try 1/2 cup butter next time.

I made this last night for Valentines Dinner and it was absolutely delicious! As some people had suggested, we minced garlic and onion and sautéed in a little bit of butter. We then removed from heat, added the cream, then melted butter into cream on low heat. I changed it up a bit by adding 3/4 C of parm and 1/2 C of Romano because I like the taste better. We grilled some blackened chicken to go along with it as well. Since we were waiting for the chicken to be done the sauce thickened quite a bit and it seemed a bit salty, we added more cream and kept it on low heat, stirring constantly. It came out perfect, there was none left!

This was a great and simple recipe.  I did make a few changes to the recipe in order to make the dish nearly lactose free, but this was a great recipe to use to assess proportions.  I used clarified butter instead of regular butter and I used kefir (similar to greek yogurt) instead of heavy cream.  I added roasted garlic - about a whole tablespoon - because I like garlic and I hoped it would offset the tanginess of the kefir. Otherwise I kept everything the same for the sauce, using less past because I like lots of sauce. It turned out really great and, although lactose free, was indistinguishable from a lactose heavy version.

I followed the recipe except for two minor changes. I used one pound of pasta instead of 1 1/2 pounds (per other suggestions) and the amount of sauce was perfect for that amount of pasta. Also I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, it didn't really need any added salt since the cheese already made it salty enough. Otherwise this recipe is perfect.

Well, the title says it all, To Die For!! This is SO good!! I made this for my family and added grilled chicken and it was awesome!! The only changes I made to the sauce were; instead of garlic salt, I used garlic powder and I added a pinch of nutmeg. This was out of this world delicious!! It will definitely be my go to alfredo recipe. YUM!!!

This dish was delicious I followed the recipe to a T. It came out to be the best fettuccine Alfredo I have ever tasted. The only thing I changed is I added two dashes of garlic salt. My grandfather is not a big fan of fettuccine alfredo and he really liked this recipe

This was so good. I only used half the amount of butter and it tasted just as good. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and add little more cheese and the result was amazing. love this recipe

I halved the butter, sauteed a clove of garlic and added a bit of nutmeg. I used freshly grated Parmesan, Asiago and Fontina cheese. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and my family loved it!

Even though I crushed and then turned my garlic into a paste by pressing it into the cutting board with the flat of my knife and added a little basil, I'm afraid I found this sauce a little too runny and bland as printed. I hate using cornstarch in anything so I used 1/4 cup of cream cheese and stirred it into the cream mixture.  this gave it a little creamier taste as well as the consistency I was looking for.  thanks for posting!

Very tasty, and I wanted more even after I was full.  Very rich, not for the cholesterol or lactose weary people out there.  Nice with a crisp salad.

I thought the flavor was delicious, but I did cut the butter in half and used part 1% milk and added flour to thicken it up.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Personally I just thought it was okay, but my husband rated this one 5 stars, so I'm going with our average. I scaled the recipe down to serving four people and it still fed five people with leftovers too. It was both quick and easy to make.

I just made this and the sauce really is to die for!  I am treasuring this recipe for the rest of my life - it is simple but perfect as is.  I didn't have romano cheese so I just used some provolone cheese I had in it's place and it still worked.  Maybe next time I'll try the romano. This is delicious!  Thank you for sharing. :)

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it was absolutely wonderful! The only change I made was adding about four cloves of minced garlic instead of using the garlic salt, other than that I followed the recipe to the tee. I will never buy jar alfredo sauce again. Thank you ErinMarie for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Excellent! We all loved. The sauce looks like it's enough but the pasta quickly sucks it up. It should be doubled as another reviewer mentioned.

This is a traditional base recipe for alfredo sauce and exactly how they prepare it inside the very expensive (fancy) restaurants. For the people who are worried about the fat and cholesterol: If you excersize and eat healthy regularly a little fat isn't going to kill you (in fact, a little fat is good for you). As with EVERYTHING a little in moderation is the best policy. I'm in love with alfredo sauce and this is much cheaper than eating out or buying canned alfredo sauce full of preservatives! It's so easy to make that I'll NEVER spend another dollar on alfredo that I didn't make.

Very similar to my own recipe. I like to serve this as a side dish  with Chicken Parmigian.
If you put both on a large plate,side by side, you get a delicious blending of the two sauces. 
This recipe is very good, no cornstarch needed

I'm not sure this is "to die for" :), but it is really good and so far it's my favorite Alfredo sauce recipe. It's very creamy and rich and my boys love it! I made it and topped it with pan seared chicken. We'll make it again!

Delicious. I didn't have Romano or Parmesan tonight so I subbed both for half a bag of Mozzarella and added some white wine, Basil, diced Italian tomatoes and chicken.  I STUFFED MYSELF SILLY! VERY VERY Good.

This recipe was tastey.... but next time I will use waaaaaaay less butter (probably only 3/4 of a stick)!  After reading other reviews, I opted to use garlic powder instead of the salt and didnt add extra salt. Also, I dont know how anyone uses 24 oz of pasta.... I cooked a 16 oz box and only used 3/4 of it. I will definatly try this one again, with modifications.

Good taste, but there was too much butter. It made a grease layer on top of the sauce almost 1/4 in. thick. Also, instead of being creamy, it came out chunky. I think next time, if I use this recipe again, I'll use much less butter, and make sure the cheese is room temperature before adding it more slowly.

Best alfredo recipe ever! Tasted just like Olive Garden. Cut back to a stick and a half of butter and added some chopped garlic as well. Will definitely be making this again.

I tried this recipe today.  As I have a large family, I tripled the recipe.  Three cups of butter seemed like too much, so I used 2.  I melted the butter and sauteed some minced fresh garlic (4 cloves). I added the cream to the butter and garlic and whisked it while heating it up. After mixture was heated I whisked in the cheese and added pepper to taste.  DONT ADD ANY SALT.  Who knew butter and cheese could be so salty!  The sauce had really good flavor, but the saltiness was a bit overwhelming.  Next time I will try with unsalted butter.  Good base recipe though!

Only made a 1/2 recipe but used a little extra cheese.  Also, DH could only find a mix of shredded romano, asigo (sp?), & parm so I used that.

I really liked this, I didn't use one of the cheeses but it still tasted great!  My only real change for next time will be to cook the noodles just a little bit longer since they didn't cook more in the sauce when I added them.

My family really enjoys this super easy recipe. I have married it to another recipe I have which basically means I add some paprika, cayenne pepper, basil, Italian seasonings, and cut up shrimp to give it a little cajun kick. I alternate though b/c I love it plain too! :)

I've made this recipe many, many times since I first found it here in 2003, and I've not found a reason to change a thing.  Every time it's served, there are raves around the table.  Beside, it's fun to have a little 'race' with yourself as you finish it with the egg.

5 STARS WITH CHANGES:  I only used 1 box (16 ozs) pasta, I used HALF the butter (this was plenty of butter I can't imagine using double that), 1 pint heavy cream, 1 clove fresh garlic chopped, dash salt and pepper, dash nutmeg.  DELICIOUS!!  (Kids loved it too)

I made this for dinner last night having never made Fettuccine Alfredo before.  It came out GREAT.  I did take other suggestions and added fresh garlic to the cheese sauce.  I think if I had not done this it would have been bland.  I cooked some chicken breasts in butter and added that to the dish as well as some broccoli.  Definitely not something you eat on a day to day basis due to the high fat content.  But is was definitely tasty!

Wow!  This was a wonderfully rich recipe.  I did add sauted mushrooms. I only sauted them for about 4 minutes so they didn't get mushy when added to the pasta.  I also added fresh ground nutmeg on top...double Wow!

This was a great recipie.  I cooked it last night, and i personally loved it.  I added grilled chicken and steamed brocolli and it was amazing.  My 16 yr old foster daughter iddn't like it too much becuase she was raised on all the processed foods, however, i can't even stand the taste of the jarred stuff.  This was amazing.  It was sorta pricy to make, however, it was worth it!

Good, simple fetticcini! I added diced garlic to the mix and used linguine though. The garlic gave it an incredible flavor!

This is amazing! Finally an alfredo that can rival the jarred stuff. I used less butter than called for; maybe 1/4 cup to half a cup at most. The conversion for pints to cups wasn't even so I used a full two cups, used a full cup of Romano (the version I bought was called 'Bella Lodi' by Saputo) and sauteed both onions and garlic in the butter prior to adding the cream. I also followed the tip about using cornstarch and lemon juice; also added a pinch of nutmeg. The sauce was so creamy and delicious that I kept sneaking a taste! We like our pasta dishes saucy so we used a little less pasta (that is, whatever we had left of the fettuccine in the cupboard lol).

Excellent! An absolute hit with the family, and it wasn't hard to make. Reminiscent of Olive Garden's Fettuccine Alfredo! I'd suggest adding a bit more pepper and some salt into the sauce - it was a bit bland until the extra seasoning. I'll definitely be making it again!

made this way back for our 2nd anniversary of dating. Big hit! I would be careful of how much salt to use, instead of using garlic salt, garlic powder is a great sub. Wonderful homemade meal!

Great taste. Never made anything like this before and it was shockingly easy. I added 2 minced garlic cloves to sauce. Also, I cut 4 boneless skinless chicken breast into cubes (seasoned with salt, pepper, 2 minced garlic cloves) and cooked until done. Next time, I'll also be added another 1/2 of parm cheese.

Overall this dish was very lucious. The dish itself is very heavy, so don't plan on consuming an abudance of the entrée. The amount of pasta in the ingredient list is way too much. When we cooked it we used 1/2 pint of cream, and 1/2 cup of butter (1 is excessive). The only complication we came across was getting the cheese to melt in and be smooth. We also added a little milk which made the taste more desirable. We suggest heating the cheese and milk (covered) in the microwave to get the cheese to melt correctly. Using the freshly grated cheese is much better than trying to cheat. Overall, the meal is filling and pretty scrumptious.

This was delicious!  I made it with "Blackened Chicken", another recipe from this site to create Blackened Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.  It was just wonderful, even my kids loved it.  I'll make this part of my regular recipes!

The hubby & I really wanted to like this. But it was lacking flavor. I made exactly as is but added a dash of nutmeg. After we tasted it, we both added more garlic salt. My husband said he likes my version of fettuccine better so I will continue to make that one. Thats what I get for trying something new. Just some 411: WAY too much butter for one thing, and the other..use fresh garlic and fresh parmesan cheese.

Amazing! It's the best Alfredo sauce I've had! I made a few modifications: I omitted the salt and garlic salt and added one clove of fresh garlic, minced. I decreased the butter a little and added broccoli to the pasta. We had guests for dinner and everyone loved it. I'll never again buy jarred sauce. Thanks for sharing. Can't wait to have it again!

AH-MAZING, craving some right now lol..  very easy, but I was a little nervous that the sauce wouldn't thicken, luckily I read a review telling me not to worry and just keep on stirring. Tasted great with chicken, tomatoes, and green onions ;).

Increased to 12 servings. I used the sauce for "Lasagna Alfredo" and it tasted delicous. Only modification I did was to use 1 cup of Romano cheese because that was what I had left. Also, the cheese I used was unmarked in my fridge but I do believe it was Romano. If it wasn't, I might of used Asiago. Next time I would like to decrease the butter and whatever amount I decreased, add that amount more of heavy cream.

This was excellent.  I followed others' advice - added some cornstarch and a drop of lemon juice after mixing in the cheese.  I added some grilled chicken breast to the dish, and it was great!

This was very good, and better yet easy to make. It tasted great right off the stove. Not the best reheating it the next day (the butter seperated when reheating and it was very greasy) BUT for guests or any event where I need alfredo I will def make again!!

There was too much butter in this dish & when i added the cheese into the melted butter & cream mixture, it turned into clumps! I kept whisking it but the consistency was never quite right! Will not make again!

I found this recipe on here at least 2 years ago and have been making it just as directed ever since then! (Except that I add a little more Parmesan than it calls for)  My husband and I LOVE Fettuccine Alfredo and have found this recipe to be just as good if not better than most that we would order in any Italian Restaurant.  Everyone that we have ever made this for raves over it and always asks for the recipe.

Great and simple recipe. I just used a bit more cheese, minced garlic to replace the garlic salt, and a little less pasta.  Thank god i'm not a health nut because i might have to make this often. Thanks again.

Tonight I made this dish as break from the leftovers from Christmas dinner. I followed the suggestion of adding minced garlic to the butter before the cream mixture. Our family loves garlic so this really gave it more flavor. I also added shrimp to pasta and cream sauce when they were done.  The kids said it was excellent. I will make it again and try with fresh broccoli. Thanks for the tips and the recipe.

Amazing recipe! Tasted just like Olive Garden's. The only thing I would suggest is adding a little more salt to the sauce (it was a tiny bit bland). I will definitely make this again!!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was VERY good. My son had 3 helpings! It does taste a lot like Olive Gardens Alfredo which is his favorite dish there. I spiced it up alot with loads of nutmeg (I adore lots of nutmeg with white sauce) and tons of pepper. Otherwise it was a tad on the bland side but still REALLY good. My kids like theirs without nutmeg and pepper. I scaled down the servings to 4 and reduced the pasta ratio because we like pasta saucy! Ill be making this again soon.

My husband and I always get fettuccine Alfredo at Italian restaurants and this was just as good as any I have ever had.  I am so excited to be able to fix this at home.  I added a little extra cheese to the sauce and grilled chicken with Italian seasonings and garlic powder and shredded it and added to the pasta!  It was literally to die for!!!

I have been searching for a good fettuccine recipe that tastes as if I'm eating at a restaurant.  I found it!!  My family and I couldn't get enough, even my picky kid eaters.  I didn't alter a thing.  With the left overs, I heated the remaining heavy whipping cream with about a tablespoon of the two cheeses, added the leftovers heating until warm/hot. Enjoy, this is a keeper recipe!

My husband orders fettuccine alfredo everytime we go out to eat, so I thought it would be nice to make it for his birthday. This was a great recipe, it was easy, and best of all Hubby said it was awesome! I'll definitely be making this again, but at the moment neither one of us can move since we're so full;)

Soooooo sooooo good!! For my foods class my group decided to make fettuccine Alfredo! We found this recipe and decided to try it. We also made garlic bread with it too!! It was sooooooooo good tasting!! I liked adding a bit more garlic salt and pepper on it but it was still probably the best fettuccine Alfredo I have ever tasted! My foods teacher liked it so much she took some for her lunch!!! I highly recommend!

An additional note to my previous review:  This does not reheat well as it separates, so making extra with plans to take it for lunch the next day won't work out so well.  Eat it fresh!

This recipe turned out pretty well considering I managed to make a pretty big goof and used heavy whipping cream instead of heavy cream (whoops).  It still turned out pretty well.  I followed the suggestions of others and used 12 oz of pasta and had just the right amount of sauce to pasta.  For those of you that have a hard time with adding and stuff like me, 3/4 of a pint of cream is 1 1/2 cups.  Good recipe.

I tried this with reluctance because of the calories, over 900, holy moly! So I only used around 3/4 cup of butter, around 1/2 cup of cream the rest was 2% milk. Added in garlic poweder, salt & pep. I also only added in less then 1/2 a cup of fresh parm and around 1/2 of the romano. The sauce wasn't very smooth but it still tasted good. I served it with penne and stirfried brocolli, grape tomatoes and portabello mushrooms. Was pretty good, but I wasn't wowed (that was probably because of my mods though!)

The BEST!  I used 5 cloves of garlic like another review suggested, my husband couldn't eat it-too strong.  Next time I make I'll just use 2 cloves.  By the way, we both love garlic but 5 is just too much.

I actually didn't read the other reviews before making this pasta, and therefore I was very disappointed with the results. The amount of pasta listed for this recipe is WAY WAY WAY too much!!!! the pasta became very dry almost immediately. Next time, I'm only going to add 12 ounces of fettuccine and keep all other ingredients the same.

My family loved it! Because it makes so much, and because its so fattening, instead of saving it for leftovers, I froze 1/2 of it and it was still delicious after being frozen.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe and added chicken. However I was running low on butter so I only used maybe 3/4 cup instead of 1 whole cup. Didn't seem to affect it. Turned out AMAZING! Definitely not low fat, but tastes great. :)

MMMM YUMMMY! I'm 15 and sometimes cook for my family because my parents are so busy. This fettuccine alfredo is now my favorite pasta. The sauce was really cheesy but oh my gosh so good. I couldn't stop eating this and now I feel fat haha!

All you taste is the butter (greasy) flavor.  You don't get the overall flavor of the cream and garlic as with really good fettuccine alfredo.

This recipe was the best I have ever tasted!  It was simple and the recipe came out perfect.  I only made 12oz of fettucine though.  I thought 24oz seemed like a lot. I think this is even better than restaurant alfredo!

I think this would have been a really great Fettuccine had I not added so much pasta. It ended up being a little dry, but still very good.

This was delicious!  We like chicken and broccoli with our Fetuccine alfredo so I fried some chicken in a little bit of vegetable oil and a lot of garlic and steamed some broccoli.  The only other changes I made were using a pre-packaged cheese mixture of romano, parmesan and asiago and I did end up adding some extra grated parmesan.  It was excellent!  My husband took one bite and had a great compliment for me!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a group of people (none of which had ever had Fettuccine Alfredo) and it was a big hit. Not very healthy but delicious. I cooked for chicken breast strips with garlic and mixed it. DELICIOUS!

I made this last night using Asiago in place of Romano (because that's what I had) and it turned out marvelous! It had a nice tang to it and it was so creamy. There were no leftovers! I intend to make it with Romano to see which I like better, but I highly recommend trying it with Asiago. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I found the sauce to be a little bit too thin, so I added more of both cheeses.  I also pressed two cloves of garlic into the sauce in place of the garlic salt.  By far, the best homemade alfredo sauce I've ever made!

I like this, I really do.  I was surprised too because when I started making it I was thinking, "Eh, this isn't gonna work..."

I couldn't get the sauce to thicken too much and only used about half the butter, but wow it's really quite good.  It all comes together in the end.  Much better than other Alfredo recipes I've tried.  I think next time I'll add a bit more cheese though.

Anyway, good job, thanks for posting it.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe. Though my sister did say that it tasted too much like the Romano cheese so maybe I'll cut back on it next time and just use more Parm. I did use a squirt of lemon like some reviewers suggested to break down the cheese and put in a few different seasonings. I did make a lot so I had to keep some in the fridge over night but it didn't break down as bad as I thought it would and was still good for the next day. It was really good, and I will be making it again really soon! Thank you for this recipe!

So good. I used the entire pint of cream and added a little more of each cheese to prevent it from being too thin.

Loved the idea of a true alfredo dish, but thought there was simply way too much butter and cream in this recipe. So, I cooked the pasta as instructed, reserving approximately 3/4 cup of the starchy water for the sauce (this helps bind the cheese sauce to the pasta). To cut fat, I omitted half the butter and cream, and substituted Stonyfield Farm's light plain yogurt. I also added a 1/2 tsp of cumin - a spice more closely associated with Mexican and Mediterranean dishes, not Northern Italian, but I just love it in creamy sauces. I served the pasta in smaller portions alongside baked chicken breast stuffed with sundried tomatoes and capers, and topped with homemade potato "sticks." Melange of roasted red pepper and zucchini for vegetable. Very happy with the result. Thanks for the inspiration!

tasty- I added a bit more parm as it tasted a bit too romano-y for me.  And I also added more garlic.  I like a garlicky sauce

This was a very good Alfredo.  I added a pinch of nutmeg to give it a more authentic taste along with grilled vegetables (carrots, onions, zucchini). It was great.

I am not quick to give 5 stars unless something lives up to the name and this definitely does.  This was as good as any restaurant if not better.  I sprinkled fresh shredded parmesan to the top of each serving for my hubby and boys.  I also cooked some boneless skinless chicken breast and cut it into strips and added to the sauce at the end.  This recipe was a big hit! Excellent!

GREAT RECIPE!!! To make this sauce not get lumpy just heat the cream and butter and turn the stove off and add the cheese. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I cooked some squash, onions, chicken, bell pepper, and mushrooms and added it to the sauce and noodles for a fantastic meal. Thanks.

Oh. My. Gosh. Wow. Just wow. This sauce is liquid heaven. Pure decadence. I used a jar of shredded parmesan/romano cheese, and the flavor was out of this world. Just as good, if not better, than that fettuccine alfredo you would get at a restaurant. I served this with french bread slathered with a garlic butter (recipe on this site). Absolutely divine!

This really is a great recipe!  My suggestions- if you use salted butter, omit the extra salt, and consider adding a little basil or italian seasoning for some flavor.  Everyone I've made this for has raved about how amazing it is!

I don't ever have to go to Olive Garden again because this is way better than theirs. I would have it every day if I could. This is so rich and creamy and yummy. Sometimes I put leftover grilled chicken, or broccoli, or peas in.

My husband (who loves alfredo) LOVED this recipe!  And, it was easy to make, which I love because he's so appreciative when I make something very simple!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was wonderful!!  My six year old daughter loved it!  It tasted just as good if not better then Fettuccine you'd get in a restaurant.

husband said it was by far the best fettuccine he has ever had ever ever ever! i thought it was pretty yummy myself...cut the servings in half, because its just me and him for now, but next time will add more cream or milk or something to make the alfredo less grainy. otherwise, YUMMY!

What an incredibly recipe.  I only used 12 oz of fettucini which was the spinach kind.  Also I added chicken and sauteed mushroom to the sauce once finished.  Wow, this tasted great....better than most restaurants.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

Wow!! This turned out perfect the first time I made it. I added more cheese and threw in two smashed (but still whole)garlic cloves. I put penne in each person's bowl, and let them add as much sauce as they wanted. By keeping it seperate, the leftovers were very easy to reheat. I put a splash of milk in the bottom of my saucepan, and put the heat on low until the butter in the sauce melted, then turned it up a bit. That worked great.My status in the kitchen has been raised to QUEEN.

I have made this recipe several times over the years and it is my FAVORITE!  I only use this one when making alfredo.  I will say that the recipe as stated is lacking a little flavor.  I have added parsley and LOTS of italien seasoning.  I also add steamed broccoli and seasoned chicken.  Very good!

The flavor is definitely restaurant quality. We loved it! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I could not get it to thicken despite adding extra cheese. I will certainly make this again, but try to figure out how to make it a little thicker.

Very Yummy with homemade noodles!  I used shredded cheese instead of fresh grated and I think the grated cheese would have melted better and given it a better texture but it was still great and my husband enjoyed it also.

Wonderful taste when eaten immediately after preparing it. Makes a ton! Does not reheat very well. It turns into butter noddles.

I made this last night and it tasted just like Olive Garden's fettucinni alfredo.  I used a combination of parmesian, asiago, and romano cheeses.  Very tasty.

My sister and I made this the last time she came to visit and we both absolutely loved it. I was worried that it wasn't thickening enough on the stove but once it was tossed with the pasta the starch I guess took over and made it just right. Thanks!

Good not great, my sauce seemed to disapear into the pasta.  IT did taste good though but it was hard getting it to thicken right, and didn't hold it's consistency.

The flavor was good, cream and butter how can it not taste good, but it never thickened enough. Also, it's very heavy and I wouldn't make this but once a year. I added "blackened Chicken" to the dish, and that was very good.

This recipe tasted awesome, but the measurements seemed a little off. I doubt I used even 1 16 oz box of pasta much less 24 oz. I also added extra cheese. =) Family loved it!

Does a alfredo sauce get any better? I have been looking for a good fettuccine alfredo recipe for years and now I have it! Lucky me...

This was great!  I made it for my boyfriend (he loves alfredo, and is a bit of a hard to please critic for this kind of thing), and he loved it!  I loved it too.  It was pretty easy to make too.  It is really good if you add in some veggies every now and then :)

I was disappointed with this recipe and I've never felt that way about something with a 5-star rating. It was too greasy and not creamy enough! It DID taste good, but it didn't have the right texture or color. I've made the recipe off the side of the fettuccine pkg. before and liked it better!

This was a great recipe.  I used margarine instead of the butter because I thought it would be to rich with all that butter.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was ok. I added brocolli, garlic, & mushrooms but it was still bland. My husband said maybe next time we could try adding some sort of seafood like mussels or clams... It is a good base but not really what I was expecting after reading all the rave reviews.

Tasted great! Everyone loved it. The only thing was only need to use 12 ounces of fettuccini noodles.  There was not enough sauce to coat 24 ounces. I will definitely make again.

I made this for my red sauce and pasta loving husband, so I was not quite sure what his reacton would be to the creamy, rich cheese sauce.  I thought I was in trouble when after a few bites he asked "What do you call this?"  I added sliced mushroom and sweet peas to the dish as well.  At the end he said "Mmm, that was good".  I gave it a Very Good.   So rich, so filling.  Happy tummies!

OMG This was so awesome......it was absolutely the best I've ever had and I'm a very picky eater. To thicken it up though instead of cornstarch like another reader had suggested, I had a package of Knorrs alfredo sauce mix which I took a little of and added it with the leftover heavy cream, put it in a bowl with a lid and shook it until mixed and added to the sauce. It turned out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really easy and really tasty alfredo sauce. I had only 2 cups of freshly grated parmesan and no romano cheese and it was still yummy. Also, if you want it to thicken up faster just mix a tsp cornstarch with water and whisk it in.

We had a big fettucini Easter dinner, and served this recipe with two other homemade sauces.  It was definitely delicious, easily top restaurant quality!  Everyone loved it; in fact, most side dishes were barely touched.  It didn't thicken up very well, but it was still delicious.  I don't understand how it could be bland, unless others used cheap cheese or the kind in the shaker bottle.  DELICIOUS!!

Good recipe, except there was not enough sauce for all of the pasta.  I added more flavor by adding sauteed shrimp, mushrooms and peas (in a garlic herb marinade -- and I added the marinade too) to the sauce at the last minute.  The leftovers were decent tasting, but the sauce separated.  Definitely use freshly grated cheese.

Better than other alfredos I've made.  Romano is too strong for my tastes so I used more parmesan and less romano.  I also used way more cheese than it said too because it was too thin.  I probably could have used less butter instead.

This was very good. My only complaint was that it was a little oily, so next time I may cut back a bit on the butter. Otherwise, perfect!

my fiance said it was really good; I halved the butter (any more would be too rich IMO) added a little extra cheese and instead of putting the noodles into the sauce pan I put the sauce into the noodle pan instead which worked well.
I also added chicken to the mix!

This is a great recipe! Delicious and fast! We shredded the cheese ourselves and it was easy to melt.

Suprisingly i thought this dish was just "okay" it was very salty and my sauce was never smooth.  If i do try it again i will make some changes.

Not necessarily "to die for", but certainly very good!  I didn't have romano, so just used all parmesan, turned out very yummy!

This recipe was fabulous.  I like alot of sauce, so I only used 12 oz of fettucine instead of 24.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  This recipe is AWESOME. Thanks for sharing

This tastes like every other Alfredo recipe I have tried. It was nothing special, just ok. I might make again, maybe making a few modifications, such as adding fresh parsley & basil, and fresh garlic. I might try adding some chicken or shrimp, as well.

This recipe is definitely to die for!  I added a little sauted chicken and garlic, but other than that didn't change a thing.  It was perfect!  My husband called it sinful. Thanks Erin for helping bring something new to our table tonight.

Yes too die for.  This recipe is so easy and surpasses any alfredo you will ever find in a jar.  I used garlic powser instead of garlic salt and chopped fresh parsley to garnish.  Bravo!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!

GREAT alfredo sauce.  The perfect blend of creamy and cheesy.  Alfredo sauce should be simple and not too overloaded with ingrediants.  My italian boyfriend gave this two thumbs up :)  Thanks Erin.

I thought this was very good, but my kids didn't really like it. After refrigeration, it separated and when I reheated it, I had to stir and stir to get it mixed again.

The taste was wonderful. The noodles seemed to have soaked up the sauce so it wasn't as creamy and saucey as I would have liked it to be. Hubby says it was very good, but was also very heavy.

This is a great recipe.  My family loved this with my veal picatta recipe.  It was a very good side dish.  Thanks for the recipe.

This has to be the best Alfredo recipe I have ever tasted.  Better than any restaurant!  We added some cooked salmon to out dinner but the sauce can definately hold its own!

Great fettucine!  My very fussy son tried this and loved it.
