1.25.17   First batch took about 21 minutes to bake at 325, so I turned up the temp to 350, and they came out at about 14 minutes.  A small cookie scoop worked beautifully, and the number of cookies was exactly as indicated in the recipe.  The cookies will be VERY soft coming out of the oven, almost falling apart, so do give them a few minutes to firm up a bit on the baking sheet, then transfer with a spatula to a rack, and allow them to cool and dry completely...they will firm up then.  I used candy kisses filled with caramel which added one more layer of flavor. The cookie’s texture is a bit chewy, and the candy kiss center is very soft. Very good recipe, I think my husband is heading to the kitchen for another one (maybe two?).

Super easy to make. They look great too.  Only complaint is that they kind of taste like a large spoon of raw peanut butter with a chocolate kiss on them.  Fortunately my family loves peanut butter.

Very easy to make. I changed the ingredients slightly by using half white sugar and half light brown sugar. They came delicious.

Learned with the first batch that if you make it with reduced fat peanut butter you will end up with spread out paper cookies. Tried again with normal peanut butter and they were perfect. So easy.

I followed the recipe exactly but these cookies were almost burning after 9 minutes in the oven.  They were super chewy almost likely a toffee or caramel candy.  I’m not sure what went wrong but I’ll be looking for a different peanut butter cookie recipe for sure.

I thought these cookies were very good.  They did flatten a lot, though, so after my 1st pan I cooled the cookies in the refrigerator for a few minutes before baking.  That seemed to help.  I would also recommend you make them small.  Will definitely make more than 36.

I tried these with hot cocoa kisses. Dark chocolate probably would have been better but overall they turned out great.

I was looking for a peanut butter blossoms recipe that didn't use shortning and I came across this one. I'm so glad I did! I like this one better than the typical recipe. I followed the recipe except my jar of peanut butter wasn't completely full so I cut back on the sugar a bit. I baked for 14 minutes. Perfect!
