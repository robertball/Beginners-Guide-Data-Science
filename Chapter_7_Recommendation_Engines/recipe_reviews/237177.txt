When it was almost finished cooking I tasted it and thought it needed something to boost the flavor, so I added 2 tsp of honey and 1/4 cup of chicken stock and simmered a little longer. Loved it! Excellent with Pork Chops.

This was very good but I would change the directions to saut√© the onions and kale for 10 minutes then add 1/2 cup water and steam for 20 minutes to tenderize kale.  Then add the apples and spices and cook for another 10 min.  The apples come out still a bit crisp and sweet.  That's the way I did it and kale was good.  Also I doubled recipe but next time I will double kale only as it seemed there was a lot of apple.  Thanks for recipe.

The combination of the ingredients made for a delicious meal. I did add smoked sausage to bulk up this dish and it really complemented the dinner, I served it over rice. Yummy!

Excellent!  I used baby kale so it was more of a spinach consistency, a honeycrisp apple (because I don't care for red delicious), and added a bit of crumbled bacon (because..well.....bacon!!!.  Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely delicious! My wife is not a big fan of onions so I only used half an onion and chopped it. Otherwise, prepared as suggested. A+

Taste-wise, its fantastic. I'm not a big fan of the texture of cooked greens, so I struggle with eating even the tastiest of cooked greens. While I didn't care for the texture of this recipe, either, the apple texture really helped a lot and made it more palatable for me.

Being a vegetarian and a fan of kale, I'm always looking for new meatless recipes to try.  This was so good, I ate it as my main course for dinner.

Great quick side.  I peeled the apples and added a grated clove of garlic and a few tbsp' s of butter.  Added 1/2 cup or so of water to steam when i added the kale.  Will make again & again.

I absolutely loved this recipe. The only change I made was to use honey crisp apples rather than red delicious. I will be making this over and over again.

Yum. This was super easy, healthy and tasted great. I added some nuts for extra protein at the end.

This is a simple recipe with on-hand ingredients.  I used a 10oz bag of chopped kale from Trader Joes.  Seemed like more than 4 cups but it cooked down nicely.  The apples add a nice subtle sweetness and the cooking softened the kale and removed the bitterness.  I'm confident my family will eat this but may not rave if served solo.  I wanted to add something - I did add some more cider vinegar and probably 1 tsp of honey.  I sliced up 1/2 an apple-chicken sausage with it for breakfast and it was very satisfying.  
So, overall it would make a great side dish, or as a main dish with the addition of sausage.

Turned out most excellent. Added some micro mustard greens 'cause I had 'em. Massaged the kale with salt per suggestion. Perfect!

I massaged the kale with a bit of olive oil and salt before cooking to make it tender. I also added about a half cup of chicken stock and steamed for about 10 minutes at the end. Was amazing with pork chops and cinnamon applesauce. Yum!

Kale doesn't have much flavor so I used some bacon grease insta of oil, then put a few bacon bits on top when served!
Great side dish!

This was just ok... I only had a Gala apple, and baby kale, so the cooking times were just right. The apple flavor didn't really come through and I found the big onion slices annoying. So if I did it again I'd dice the onions and try a red delicious to see if it's better.

I had such hopes for this, but was very disappointed with the finished product.  I did add chicken and apple sausage to it and to be honest -- that was our favorite part.  I think it was the taste of the vinegar that we didn't like and it really needed more salt.  Won't be making it again.

Mixed vote in our house. My husband thought it was too sweet; my daughter didn't like the 'mushy' (her word) apples, and I loved it. I used baby kale in mine, and everyone was a fan of the greens. I think I may tweak the recipe and try again!
