Overall, not a bad stew.  I used fresh vegetables instead of canned and added in squash as well as a little more red wine.  Oregano, parsley, paprika were also added.  A glass of red wine and crusty rolls completed the meal.

I've made this stew ( a few ingredient differences) for many years now and I am happy to see it here!  I use fresh vegetables and always add whats in season (and whats leftover in my fridge or freezer).  Today I added fresh butternut squash.  The beef stew meat is so tender from slow cooking it, and all the flavours meld together nicely. It's very filling and comforting to have on a fall day.  THX.

This was so tasty!  I made a few changes though...I used fresh ingredients, substituted celery for the water chestnuts, left out the tapioca and used Marsala wine instead of Burgundy.  I browned the beef in a pan first and then put everything into my crockpot and cooked it on low for 5 hours.  I served it over egg noodles and my family loved it and went in for seconds!

I followed recipe to a T and it was ok but left a little something to be desired. It's a good base recipe though that can be tweaked to desired tastes. Thanks for posting.

Excuse me, when do you add the burgundy, and shouldn't you brown the beef  first?

The meat was extremely tender in this recipe. However, the stew needed more seasonings.  I may try pre-seasoned crushed tomoatoes and add other seasonings such as oregano and basil next time.

I didn't like this very much. The gravy had a weird consistency, it didn't have much flavor to it, and my carrots were still a little crunchy.
