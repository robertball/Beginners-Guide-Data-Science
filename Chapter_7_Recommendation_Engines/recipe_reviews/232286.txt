Made this for the hubby's birthday with dark chocolate pudding. It was delicious. I wish there was more filling, but it worked out great. Really slaved trying to pipe these in - the filling didn't spread right and I'd get a corner with a ton of filling. To make the same amount of filling in each one and have it spread throughout I just opened each puff in half and spread it with an offset spatula. No bites without mousse!  These are unbelievably easy and the hubby loved them.

This is my favorite go to recipe for something rather light, crisp and sinfully yummy! I actually use homemade whip topping and sweeten it myself but a non-dairy whip topping is totally fine. These little babies look the part of someone who slaved in the kitchen, when you know you haven't.

These are so easy to make and absolutely delicious! Hugh hit, even with my 3 year old who is usually hesitant to try something new! I have made a few different flavors now and all are great! We like them really full so I use the larger box of pudding and full tub of cool whip. For easy piping with a ziploc bag cut the zipper off, put the bag corner down into a large cup to fill it, cut the tip off and squeeze it in. These will be made often!! Thanks

I made these for a party and used banana cream pudding instead because I had another chocolate dessert. Super easy and very tasty. My husband, who's picky about desserts, ate four of them (yikes).

Melissa, these are DELICIOUS and couldn't be simplier! I had to catch myself, they are so light and go down real easy, lol. I did use SF pudding mix and FF whipped topping. Can't wait to try other pudding flavors too, but the chocolate was fantastic! Very quick to put together, but they taste like you spent some time making them...a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this with strawberry cream pudding instead of the chocolate. I think they're delicious, but my daughters said chocolate would be better. Next time, I think I'll make a batch with pistachio pudding and chocolate for the kids.

Simple and delicious!  These came together so quickly, but are so elegant. You could definitely served these as a dessert for a dinner party, or just a snack for the kids when they get home from school. I love recipes like that!  Thanks Melissa for sharing your creation!

I liked it enough, but the kids hated it.  Seemed like a lot of extra filling.

Loved it! Amazing and delicious pastries they were! Quite easy and simple to make and my brother and sister LOVED them. I had trouble making a pocket to put the filling in though and ended up cutting the pastries in half to make sort of sandwich like things. I probably just did something wrong (lol) but I love this recipe and I'm quite sure I'll make them again soon!

Very easy recipe that looks like you got it from a bakery. I used the Hershey's brand of pudding which made it very rich in flavor. That's my opinion, other brands may taste just as good. I did not slice the pastry to fill them. I just used a larger tip and stuck it into the pastry and filled them. Worked fine and had plenty of filling in each pastry.

This was such an easy dessert to make and it was loved by everyone.  I, personally, found the filling a bit too sweet/rich for my liking.  However, I plan to experiment with different fillings until I find my 5+ star filling.  This recipe will be used often in our home.
