Baked oatmeal is a favorite in my family.  However, as other reviewers have discovered, this recipe needs a lot of adjusting due to dryness and no flavor.  Here are my adjustments: 3 cups quick cooking oats, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsps baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 tsps cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 2 eggs, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 cups milk, 3/4 cup raisins or craisins and 1/2 cup chopped pecans or sliced almonds.  I bake it in a greased 9x13 at 350 for 25 minutes.  I let it cool, then cut in 12 servings. The texture and taste is like a soft oatmeal raisin cookie. It's good cold or warmed up with milk on it.  I've done a lot of testing to get a good baked oatmeal recipe.  We really like this "adjusted" recipe.  Try it and see what you think.

Absolutely delicious!  No wheat, no flour, very little sugar.  We used olive oil instead of canola oil and we add chopped apples or raisins. We added a bit more brown sugar. Very healthy, moist and easy to fix!  A keeper for this health conscious family!

I have been eating oatmeal for breakfast daily. I wanted to try this as an easy way to make a lot ahead of time. It sure does make a lot!! As with the previous reviewer I used almonds instead of walnuts. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top for extra flavor. The texture of this is much more dense and chewy than a bowl of oatmeal. I have been heating up in the microwave with milk. With the warm milk it reminds me of Indian pudding, an old settler recipe which I used to love as a child.

I added extra milk and apple chunks to this and it was still pretty dry. I also added some cinnamon and allspice to give the flavor a kick but it still needed a bit more. It would have been good drenched in maple syrup but I didn't want the extra sugar. I think I will continue to play with this adding more egg and less oatmeal a bit more brown sugar and spices maybe adding a bit of nutmeg and cardamom too.

This was really good and very moist! I liked it because it was not too sweet. Don't expect it to be sugary and sweet, it's not. It has a very mild, subtle flavor. I will make again!

I make this every time I need to feed breakfast to a crew.  I add 3 apples, coarsely chopped, and a bunch of cinnamon, some nutmeg, and a pinch of ground cloves.  Everyone loves it, and I will continue to make it again and again.

My husband and I really liked this.  We made a few adjustments based on other reviews: doubled brown sugar and added apple chunks.  Only had chopped almonds on had, which worked just as well.  Didn't think was dry-think it is supposed to be kind of crumbly.   Served with warm honey on top with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Will definately make again-was great with morning coffee-yum!  Will try different fruits...banana next?

Easy to make.  Love the no flour.  Very flexible as to type and amount of sweetening.   AND.. best of all...makes oatmeal a do-able breakfast for me because a regular bowl of oatmeal leaves me hungry all day. This has very good flavor and texture and doesn't leave me looking for the next thing to eat all day long.   I followed some of the suggestions ie;  adding apple sauce, cloves, cinnamon,  and kept in the vanilla from the original recipe. The whole family enjoyed it for breakfast this morning.

I really didn't care for it. I looked forward to making it, b/c it sounded good, but it was disappointing. The texture was too coarse and it tasted too eggy. Other than the abundance of eggy taste, there wasn't much other flavor. Maybe it would be better if you poured cream and/or maple syrup over it? I'll give it another try, but I'm going to have to tinker with the recipe a while.

Loved the flavor, but it was a bit crumbly. I would like a baked oatmeal that is more solid. Any ideas on how to remedy the crumbly-ness?

Baked oatmeal is all about the full fat milk heated with nutmeg and sometimes cloves and cardamom you pour over it!  Give it a try and have a little brown sugar or honey on hand for those with a sweet tooth.

Very good and healthy if you use egg substitute and canola oil.  I also used
Splenda Brown sugar (1/2 amount called for in recipe) and it turned out fine.
I will probably add raisins or other
dried fruit next time.

This was very good, and very easy to make.  The next time I plan to add some cinnamon and maybe some chopped apple (or applesauce) to give it more flavor.

Very good. I added raisin and craisins, nutmeg, and cinnamon. I also used olive oil instead of canola. Served it with either can peaches with whip cream (you need the syrup from the canned stuff, the oatmeal is drier) or with cream or milk pored over the top. Very filling. Entire family ate it. I would suggest you cut the recipe and cook time if you are going to only be serving a few people. This recipe makes a lot to go around :D

It's a good start.. I added 1/2 C Raisins and a tsp. of cinnamon. Omitted the walnuts and served topped w/ maple syrup. This would just be too plain w/out the additions.

Very easy recipe.  It didn't have a lot of flavor.  We reheated it later with milk and brown sugar in a bowl and it tasted better.

I have literally made this weekly and eat it every single day for breakfast for almost a year now.  Under the recommendation from a cardiologist friend (who was recommending oatmeal and flax seed powder daily for my cholesterol), I started substituting three of the eggs in this recipe for an equivalent amount of flax seed powder (as an egg substitute, per bottle directions). A few things I've tried:  this is delicious with added blueberries, strawberries or raspberries.  I also like to add pecans.  Sometimes I sprinkle flaked coconut throughout, or on top, or both.  I actually prefer this with the regular oatmeal - not the quick cook kind.  I find that the flax seed powder and the quick cook oats together gave it a gummy texture, but the regular oats solved that problem.

The fifth star is only missing because I only loved it as much as I did because I tweaked the recipe based on the comments.  I do not like my oatmeal super sweet and really don't think breakfast should be so high in added sugar.  So I reduced the brown sugar to a 1/4 cup.  Also used unsweetened applesauce for half the butter, added double the cranberries, and added chopped pecans and fresh blueberries.  I also serve with a little milk poured on top, otherwise it can be too dry.  I made two pans of this to share at an Easter potluck brunch and it was a MAJOR hit, everyone loved it.  Made it again for hubby and me at home, and we really enjoyed the leftovers for breakfast all week.  Finally I can stop buying boxed cereal for my husband.  I'd give it the fifth star, but with the extra sugar I know it would be far too sweet.

what an awesome change for my oatmeal-loving, gluten-free husband.  he's loving this for breakfast as are the kids.  i love it room temp as a snack...  re-heat for breakfast with a little honey or maple syrup drizzled over.  next time, i'm going to thrown some chopped apples in.  this time, i did add cinnamon.

I liked this recipe but forgot to add the butter.  It still turned out great, but for some reason there wasn't much rise in the end product.  Plus, I used blueberries.  I am trying to simulate a baked oatmeal that I have purchased locally in Harrisburg.  I haven't gotten there yet, but this was a start.  Great basic recipe!
