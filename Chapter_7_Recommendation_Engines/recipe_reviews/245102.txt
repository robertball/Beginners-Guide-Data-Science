I made several adjustments to make this better. I added 1 whole onion chopped and one stick of butter and cooked this on the stove with the cut up apple and a sprig of rosemary for about 1/2 hour on low and added to the rest. Definitely remove the rosemary sprig and put all in a blender for consistency

I am not a big fan of these spices together.
