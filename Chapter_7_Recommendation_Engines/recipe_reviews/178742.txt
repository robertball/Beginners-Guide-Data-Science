I made this for St Patrick's day a few years ago with Irish Cider Cake for Dessert. It's a wonderfully hearty dish. As long as quality (85% pork and above) sausages are used and good cuts of bacon I don't really think it needs any more seasoning. Just a twist of salt and black pepper.

This is the kind of thing my mum would make for me and my brother when we were kids. It's simple no-frills hearty comfort food and pretty inexpensive too. That being said I think a lot of people are going to find it very bland. I added garlic and onion powders and made it with homemade chicken stock and it was still pretty blah. Husband sprinkled hot sauce over his. Not bad but it needs some tweaking.

It smells absolutely delicious. I added the potatoes after the liquid because I couldn't see in the recipe when to do it. I also added peas. Super delicious.

The recipe is great. My husband is a picky eater and loves it. I just made a few changes. I used smoked sausage and red potatoes.

I boil the meat (I use sausage and smoked pork chops) in cider first and then layer the meat onion thinly sliced carrots and thinly sliced potatoes in several layers. Then pour in the cider cover and simmer for about an hour.

I used Canadian Bacon and breakfast sausage as description says is ok. This dish came out awesome. I followed the directions up until you notice it doesn't tell you when to add the potatoes. Well since it has to simmer for 30 minutes I added the potatoes when I added the liquid. And OMG good. It was so good that my 14 year old who doesn't like anything with a lot of liquid in it asked for more after it was all gone. I suggest if you have 4 or more people making a double batch.

I substituted breakfast sausage for the Irish Sausage and when it was almost done I added a 1/4 cup milk with 4 tbsp of cornstarch to really thicken up the broth. But that is all I did to this recipe. It was FANTASTIC!!! It tastes the same as the Coddle I ordered at an Irish Pub in Bloomington Indiana! My husband loved it too!
