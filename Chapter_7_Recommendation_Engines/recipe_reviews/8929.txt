We had a cultural diversity day at our school.  The country that I was assigned was Turkey.  This recipe was perfect for our visitors to try and my middle schoolers had to have the recipe.  That is quite a triumph know that middle schoolers are picky about what they eat.

I made a mistake when I made this, I used 2-3 lbs of chicken breast (wow was it dry) but I ended up with 2 recipes worth of chicken.  I made the second one with Jarslberg maybe 2 cups worth.  Even though I made a few mistakes it was FABULOUS.  I cooked them on a baking stone (great).  I plan to make it again this weekend, but with a whole chicken like I'm supposed to, I also plan to use Basmati rice for the wonderful aroma.  This was a success with the whole family (extended family included).    :)
