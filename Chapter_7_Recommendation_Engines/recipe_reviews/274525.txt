Fabulous. Definitely make sure the florets don't touch on the baking sheets to get them crispier.

Wouldnâ€™t change a thing! I think the flour mixture really helps the flavor get into the cauliflower.  Our new go to for a vegetarian menu.

I used this recipe for the batter and basic cooking method.  It was really good!  The batter made it!  I used GF brown rice flour and omitted the breadcrumbs and it turned out beautifully.  I made my own honey/garlic sauce so I didn't use the one here, as I can't have spicy things.  The only thing I will do differently next time is I want to try 450* the whole time and not turn it down, for hopefully a bit crispier wings.  This is now my cauliflower wing recipe and will be making it routinely.  Thanks!
