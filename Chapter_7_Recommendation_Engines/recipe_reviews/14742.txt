This recipe was quick, easy, and a great crowd pleaser!  It also works well cooked in a slow cooker!

This is a tasty change of pace after bbq'ing all summer. I used baby back pork ribs, then followed the recipe, using my oven. The recipe doesn't say to do so, but I covered them with tin foil, uncovering the last 15 minutes, when I basted. The end result was not only tender and tasty, but made for a very pretty presentation worthy of any self=respecting bones joint! I noted other comments citing 'sour' tasting. I use only key limes in cooking, as they're not as tart as regular limes. 1 keylime = 1 Tbl! Also, if you don't care for foods on the spicy side, use only half the chili sauce. Being from Texas, I added a generous squirt! Kudos, Christine. 2 finger-lickin' thumbs up!

This was really good!  We used beef ribs instead of pork and it turned out just fine.  The lime gives a great flavor.  It was a little sour for me, so I think I'm going to experiment in the future with adding brown sugar, more honey, or maple syrup! (if we had kids i'm sure they'd like it)

My family really enjoyed these ribs, especially my 7 year old son.  They were so simple to make.  The only thing I'd do different next time is to put them in a cooking bag to make them more tender, then they're self basting.  These were great!

The Lime Spareribs have got to be the very best yet!  As my Husband does not like sweet on any meat - these hit him perfectly and instead of doing them in our oven, I did them on our outside grill - WOW - were they wonderful - and so thought our great-nephew, he loved them too (he's 9)!  These ribs just fell off the bones!  Ms. Johnson you did us a favor on these!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe, and called for ingredients I had on hand.  (Except I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and adobo sauce instead of chili sauce.)  I also liked the quick prep time.  My husband took a second helping of mashed potatoes just so he could eat more sauce!

My family gave this a 3.  I agree it was okay not outstanding.  The recipe when printed does not tell you what to do with the olive oil. I would not make again.

Pretty good but not stellar. Lots of fairly common ingredients, low carbs, quick.

A little bit sour but it's ok. I thought that I will try to use less lime juice next time.

My sister and my very picky cousin loves this simple recipe, I just thought it was okay. The good part is it makes a lot of sauce so you can use it as a gravy for a side of mashed potatoes. The taste is kindda sour not really sweet (after all they're called lime spareribs). Good overall recipe, thanks Christine!

These are different, not super tasty, not bad. I skipped the mushrooms and cooked 2 small racks of pork ribs in a 250 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. I then uncovered them, added the sauce and basted them every 15 minutes for another hour.  I think I will just stick to regular bbq sauce.

I've made this 3 times this summer and my family loves it. I use the ketchup-like commercial chili sauce so there is no heat. I put in a minimum of 8 garlic cloves, as we can never get enough. Otherwise I leave this scrumptious recipe as written. Mushrooms don't add much flavor, but I serve the juices over rice and the mushrooms are great for that!   Thanks for such a nice alternative to barbecue sauce (which hubby won't touch). Great ribs.

These ribs are beyond description.  I did mine in the crockpot.  Four hours on "high" had them falling off the bone.  I'm not a fan of sweet spare ribs, so this recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  The only change I made was to add a bit of cayenne pepper to the sauce they cooked in.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the only rib recipe I'll ever need.

These were amazing. I used another reviewers suggestion and cooked the ribs in a cooking bag and they were tendy and juicy! And so easy! Certainly will be made again at my house.

We fixed these tonight in hopes for an extra good dinner. I was really disappointed! There wasn't even a hint of lime flavoring (and I even used the same amount called for in the recipe). I think the soy sauce way overpowered all of the other flavors in this recipe. It was just way too salty. Thanks anyway, Christine!

When I made this is changed it a bit .  Used lemon juice instead of lime and  brown sugar in place of honey.  I also left out the mushrooms and chili sauce.  It turned out great like a sweet and sour sauce.  After I baked the ribs I thickened the sauce.

Definitely a keeper!  I'm glad I read the reviews though.  I put it in the slow cooker on high for about two hours or so.  I added more garlic but being the garlicaholic I am, it could have used more.  I held back the salt until the end because of the soy sauce, and was glad I did.  I only added a little at the end. I also added a few good grinds of fresh ground black pepper.  I didn't want a sweet sauce.  Oh, and I used two cans of mushrooms instead of fresh.  (Didn't have any.)  I think I like the way they came out.  At the end, I mixed a tablespoon of corn starch with a tablespoon of water and stirred it in.  I wanted the sauce to be thicker.  I'm glad I did that to.  Now I think I'll use this recipe on a small pork shoulder for pulled pork.

I LOVED this recipe! So did my husband. I did make some changes though. I didn't put in mushrooms, and instead of the chilli sauce I put in crushed red pepper flakes. When it was done cooking the sauce was way to runny to use so I put some in a pot and added some cornstarch! It turned out amazing!!

this is a good recipe but the sauce and the hour of cooking does not make for tender ribs. i think you may want to cook the ribs for another 1/2 hour or boil them for 15-30 minutes.
