This did not turn out for me. The edges were thick and very solid not at all the texture of baked custard. I gave it three stars because I think the thought is innovative and could be good with some modifications. If I were to make this again I d leave out the flour altogether. True custard doesn t have it. I also think crushing the berries would do away with the sour pockets of berries and incorporate the berry flavor throughout.

This is amazing!!  Super easy and incredibly delicious.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I only had two cups of raspberries, so added a cup of blueberries as well.  I didnâ€™t have whole milk so used skim, and the last quarter cup of sugar over the top seemed too much, so I maybe used about an eighth cup.  Great warm from the oven, but great cold too.  My husband seems to prefer is cold.  Will definitely make this again!

I took this dessert to dinner and game night at a friend's house and everyone loved it! This was so easy to make. The texture and taste were awesome! I cut back a little on the sugar because the raspberries were very sweet. Didn't miss it. My friends are asking me to bring it again!
