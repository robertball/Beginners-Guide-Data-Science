I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil and I used fresh garlic. The flavor was kind of bland but good. Thanks!

I love this - quick and easy way to prepare chicken breasts or tendenloins. I always add a few more spices for flavor and fresh cracked black pepper. The soup makes ALL the difference and add a little fresh garlic too!

Easy and delicious recipe.  Great just the way it is. I throw in a little bit of pepper and fresh garlic. I also double the soup/milk because it goes great as a gravy over mashed potatoes. Definately a keeper.
