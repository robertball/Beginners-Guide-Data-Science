Very tasty, almost too thick to be called soup but flavor is great.
I used Old Elpaso Hot Taco mix and the rest as written. No extra salt or pepper. Made 6 cups. Thank you for posting.

My family loved the soup.  I used a 7 oz. chicken breast instead of 4 oz., as that is what I had.  I added an additional amount of chicken broth (two cans of broth).  Next time I'll add more broth, as it was not soupy enough, but the family didn't mind.

Highly recommend doing the immersion blending. Turns it into a great soup.

I followed the directions exactly and it was really good but like others pointed out it could have used some more broth.  The drawback to me was having to let off the steam and then build it back up too many times.  Next time I think I will boil the chicken in broth on the stove top and go from there.
