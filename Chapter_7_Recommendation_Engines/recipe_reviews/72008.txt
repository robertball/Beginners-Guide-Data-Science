The BBQ sauce would have been enough to make these BBQ eggs. This is just too many seasonings for just plain old scrambled eggs. I'd rather have them plain,  Not only do they taste better that way, they also don't look appetizing.

Not good. An odd and not complimentary range of flavors. I'm with the other reviewers who prefer regular scrambled egg. Thanks anyway.

I didn't find that the different flavors melded together for me. It wasn't really all that appetizing to look at, either. Although, the taste was off for me, it may be flavorful to someone else.

Man, this was very good at all.  Very conflicting tastes and something I did not myself enjoy at all.  I prefer the standard scrambled eggs far more.

This recipe was incredible!  I just finished scraping out the pan to see if I could get any more into me.  I used Bullseye BBQ sauce.  I can't wait till I have company staying overnight so I can serve this for breakfast.

Not bad, when you get past the unappetizing color. I reduced the dill, mustard, and garlic to just 1 teaspoon each, and ended up adding another egg.

BBQ Sauce with my scrambled eggs has become a staple at my house. I'd go without the mustard and dill from this recipe, the BBQ sauce should be enough flavour as is.  But together with BBQ, lots of cheese and something like ground beef or sausage, I love it.

Okay, I have to agree that the color is a bit unappetizing. However we used this recipe for the scrambled eggs part of some breakfast burritos and it was by far the best batch we have ever had. The egg mix is suspect would also be good to use for a chicken omlete.

We did not care for this.  Too many different flavors conflicting with each other.

This recipe was really good - the barbeque sauce gives it a yummy flavor...just a note - the eggs take a little bit longer than usual to cook because of the milk and barbeque sauce -  i will definetly be making these again!
