I have to say that these are really filling and really delicious! Toss calories aside, enjoy and pass the guacamole too! Use any white cheese, but Jack cheese or Oaxaca mexican cheese is best when you are frying them  because it melts so well. Mozzerella cheese sticks work too, but let the cheese come to room temp and works great when you are baking them in the oven.  I hope you all enjoy.  UPDATE- Green Chilies are also known as Anaheim Green Chilies - think Ortega Brand.  These can be baked.  Spray them with cooking spray and bake at 325 until golden brown.

These are AWESOME! I did them slightly differently due to what I had on hand (I hope you don't mind, Baking Nana)...I had some small wonton wrappers that needed using up, so I used those and decided to use chopped green chilis, as the whole ones would not have fit. I had some pepperjack on hand, so I shredded that. To assemble, I put some shreeded pepperjack and some chopped green chilis on each wonton wrapper, rolled up egg roll style and fried. These made such cute little egg rolls and they were super delicious too! I can't wait to make these again...they would make great appetizers. Thank You Baking Nana for such a different and delicious way to enjoy egg rolls! :)

OMG!!! First of all LOVE LOVE them! Second, take it from Me, ( no offense to anyone who made them this way). Do NOT bake them! I know fried foods and all, but fried foods Can be a part of a healthy diet, Moderation is the key. I baked mine, Bad Bad MOM award! 17 YO DD came in and fried a couple up, she did a Great Job!   we used the Hatch chilies and Queso Fresco. Tina  sprinkled a little salt on the chilies before  she rolled them up. They were a hit with her Dad! Quick and easy peasy:)  Thanks Baking Nana!! These Rock!:)

SO so so so good! I only had shredded cheese so that is what I used, but next time I will use the chunks of cheese. Since it was shredded the cheese kinda dissappeared when I fried them, but the were still very good. Quinn, my 3 year old was fighting me for the last one. This is a keeper for this family! Thank you Baking Nana for this awesome recipe!!

Yum Yum Yum! These were so great! I used Wontons to make little appetizer rolls. I diced the green chilies and chopped my cheese into tiny bits. I used the baking method on non-stick foil and the end result was a such a hit with my family. The little bits of cheese that oozed out got crispy (which we LOVE) and they disappeared so fast. I served mine with a mexi sour cream dip. Thanks NANA!
Update- Made these again for company this weekend and fried them. They were great baked but they were over the top amazing when fried. YUM!!

These were sooooo good! I couldn't find wonton wrappers so ended up making them. I baked them in a 350 oven until golden. YUM!! Thanks Baking Nana!

My whole family LOVED these!!  We used fresh peppers out of the garden, then roasted, peeled and seeded them.  We just can't get enough! Took them to work and had to print the recipe 10 times for my co-workers.

You must love green chiles to enjoy these. It's a nice change of pace for us and it's so easy to put together too. Any cheese and wrapper will do as I have used colby jack cheese and rice wrapper (aka lumpia wrapper).

Man oh man, Baking Nana, These rolls were the hit of our game night with the neighbors! Like Keri, I used pepperjack cheese for a little extra kick. Served with a mild guacamole so the egg rolls flavors would shine through. I also made one jalapena peppers for the neighbor's son and he loved it! I made eight rolls. Randy and I both had one and the other six were devoured by mom and son! Thanks again, Penny!

Much better fried than baked.  We followed the advice of a previous reviewer and salted the chilies before wrapping.  Careful not to stack them for long--we premade and put in fridge and several stuck together.  Didn't use entire eggroll wrapper.

My mom made these when I was a kid. Love LOVE LOVE them!!! She would also cook a small pork roast with a large jar of salsa until the pork was falling apart tender and serve that over them for a complete meal. And to make them kid friendly when I was really little she would omit the chile and make me a few plain cheese ones. I loved them! And still do :)

I got this recipe from Baking Nana on the Recipe Exchange before it was published.  Here's my review from her personal recipe page:  AWESOME! These are SO good!! I couldn't find a small package of regular jack cheese and didn't have enough moolah for the big pack, so I used pepper jack instead. I had a large can of chiles, so I ended up with 17 egg rolls. I'm glad for that, because now I get leftovers for lunch tomorrow! I'll definitely make these again and again and can't wait to try baking them, too. Thanks, Baking Nana, for a great recipe!

Today is my daughter's 15th birthday and I made these because her grandma used to. They were her version of Chile Rellenos. However, she did use Velveeta along with the jack cheese, so I did also. Very easy and very tasty!

These little appetizers are so good.  I love chili rellenos, so when I stumbled across this recipe while looking for a Chinese egg roll recipe, I had to save it for future reference. Awhile later, When I was wandering thru my recipe box for something interesting to make for an at home Saturday movie night, (I wasn't looking for anything in particular) I stumbled across this recipe again. I made 'em verbatim - My teenage boys LOVED THEM! - and so did I - absolutely a 5 STAR recipe.  But, even with sour cream & guacamole, they still went to the fridge for Franks Red Hot.  I've made them several times making them a little spicier.  I've used fresh jalapenos (parboiled just a couple of minutes) stuffed with pepperjack cheese instead of Monterey (the boys loved 'em).  I've also used a mixture of cream cheese,canned diced jalapenos & shredded pepperjack cheese, then stuffed the canned whole green chilis with this mixture.  I was kinda surprised how yummy they were.  But, when all is said and done, when I make these for a friend/family gathering, I always stay true to "Baking Nana's" original recipe, because even though they're not very spicy for my family's tastes, they're still packed with a lot of yumminess.

I made this for a family gathering when my boyfriend got out of the Marines the other day. They are awesome! I used wonton wrappers and diced green chilies. They are so cute wrapped up! I served it with zesty ranch dip and everybody loved them!

These are so good...I found whole green chiles next to the diced ones, although I only found them in the store brand, but that was fine with me! They were small cans, so they each had three chiles in there. The only change I made was to use wonton wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers, and this was only because I already had them leftover from another recipe. I don't really recommend this route, but if you do- I ended up chopping each chile into four pieces with a small strip of cheese and rolling up burrito-style. I baked in the oven at 375 until they were golden. Definitely spray with cooking spray. Thank you, Baking Nana! We loved these, and we will certainly make these the next time we have mexican. We loved them dipped in homemade guacamole. Thank you for sharing!

The boys and husband give this five stars. Make sure you fry them up right away before the wrappers get soggy. I made mine up ahead and plated them in the fridge for an hour until I was ready to fry them. The bottom got soggy from the green chili pepper, even though I dried them with a paper towel before wrapping, so the cheese oozed out of some when frying. I made some with Pepper Jack cheese stix and some with Colby Jack cheese chunks, we all liked the Pepper Jack better.

Don't let the simplicity fool you!  This is a wonderful recipe.  I have always had problems with the breading coming off Chili Rellenos when cooking.  This is the answer to that problem.  Crispy outside with the wonderful pepper and cheese inside.  Perfect.  Great Idea.
The only thing I changed was to use shredded cheddar-jack instead of sliced cheese, and fresh Anaheim peppers that I roasted first.  I will be making this again!

After lots of attempts at making rellenos, I gave up and bought them from Sam's.  They were ok, but had gobs more breading than chiles and cheese. Well, never again!  These may not be authentic, but they're so crispy-crunchy! I love the fact that there's so much less breading. I fried them because I've never been impressed with baked egg rolls. Ick. They don't absorb nearly as much oil as the traditional type rellenos. We used roasted Hatch chiles and home smoked pepperjack.  Crazygood! Thank you for this recipe!

I made these with gluten free egg-roll wrappers. We baked ours in a 180°C oven lightly brushing each roll with an egg wash before baking. Just delicious! They accompanied our Tex-Mex lunch and liked them so much we made extra for dinner. Thank you Baking Nana for this ingenious idea! UPDATE 25 April: I made these with gluten free rice wrappers and fresh green chilis today and they were out of this world! Baked at 180°.

YUM! These were delicious! People who dont like peppers shouldnt make this, but for the rest of us, this is a great recipe. I bought two cans of whole chiles, only to find that I accidently grabbed one can of diced. I just made them into egg rolls too and it worked fine. I also thawed a few frozen red piquillo peppers to use up the rest of the wrappers and they turned out yummy as well. These remind me of jalepeno poppers .... now all I need is some bronco berry sauce from Arbys to go with!

Really good snack. I used pepper jack because I had it and needed to use it. I also salted the chilis after drying them and before stuffing with cheese, with my favorite, Lawreys season salt. Then I wrapped. I did fry them instead of baking.

i used mission flour tortillas but they started to puff up in the fryer so i had to poke holes around the egg roll before deep frying them. i think i will use the thinner flour tortillas as they don't take too long to brown thus less greasier
