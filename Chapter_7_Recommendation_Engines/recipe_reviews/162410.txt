I love making this recipe! I serve with garlic cheese bread. For some reason the recipe was not printed correctly... I boil the water and seasonings, then add the potatoes and allow to boil a few minutes before I add the processed cheese. Otherwise the cheese tends to burn and stick to the bottom of the pan. Cook on low once the cheese is added. I also wanted to note that the recipe says to use one block of cheese... If you purchase the regular sized block of Velveeta, then you actually only use 1/2 the block (1 lb) of cheese. They do have smaller 1 lb blocks of cheese you can buy as well.

Very tasty and easy-to-make comfort food.  I used a 20 ounce bag of "Simply Potatoes Southwest Style Hash Browns" as the shredded potatoes because I had some on hand that I needed to use.  And since the soup now had a "southwestern" flavor going, I eliminated the Cajun seasoning and instead just added a few shakes of Tabasco sauce and left everything else the same as the recipe called for.  This was a hit with my family, even my picky teenager, who told me that the next time she has a sore throat, she wants me to make this comforting soup for her--if not several times before then!

I really liked this. I was surprised that it was as substantial as it was, since it was made with water rather than milk. It is a very good base for additions to it, which adds interest. Plus, it's far lower in calories than other recipes I found, and it's so easy to make! Thank you for posting.

This was super easy, super quick, super GOOD! I have a few variations though. Do NOT add any additional salt, the bouillon cubes, and Velveeta cheese add more than enough! In fact, the next time I make it, I will use 3 cubes instead of 4. I bought 2% Milk Velveeta cheese. It's 1/3 less fat, and adds a milk creaminess I like. If you add this kind Velveeta, do NOT let your soup boil. It will curdle. If your soup isn't thick enough, like mine wasn't, add flour/water mixture, and sour cream. Gave a great addl. flavor. I also used the hash brown shredded potatoes. perfect, so much less work! You can add so many things to this soup, I'm thinking broccoli would be a good addition too.

Made as written and I found it bland. I added after garlic powder, hot sauce, carrots, celery, corn, chicken and some other spices. Thickend it up with some cornstarch.

My family did not like this at all. My favorite food is cheese but this was just way too cheesy for us and I only used 3/4 of a block of velveeta. The one thing we liked about it was the Cajun seasoning, which made it edible enough to choke down. But 2 of us ended up with stomach aches from the cheese and we each only had half a bowl. I made this with a half a turkey sandwich for each person.

Very yummy!  I skipped the Cajun seasoning, and added a couple herbs like oregano.  I cubed the potatoes instead of shreding them, then ran the cooked soup through the blender.  I will make this again and again!

Did not care for this at all.  Maybe it was just the cajun seasoning (which I would have thought I would like), but my husband and I both did not care for this at all.

Yummmmmy!  I love this soup!  It's quick and easy, and provided enough soup for 3 meals for me and my husband.  I didn't see cajun seasoning at the store, so I used creole seasoning and it turned out delicious!  This recipe is definately replacing my old recipe for potato cheese soup.

Very easy to prepare for a week night supper.  I cut back on the cajun seasoning to one teaspoon only because my husband doesn't like spicy food and I used onion powder instead of onion because my children don't like onion.  My younger shild, the picky eater, couldn't stop talking about how good it was and she ate two helpings.  I will make this again and often.

This is a great base soup, and so easy to make! I added carrots and broccoli, and didn't have any parsley or cayenne pepper, so those were left out. I also left out the onion so my kids were more likely to eat it.  :)  I waited to add the Velveeta cheese until everything else was cooked, because it just needs to be melted. And then I crumbled some bacon into it when served.  It was really delicious for how easy it was!  I will definitely make this again!

I loved it!  Like the suggestions before me I used the 20 oz. southwest hash browns:waited to put the cheese in when I turned heat down.  My son ate it and LOVED it and he hates potatoes.

I've made this a thousand times and it's been on my go-to list from day one.  it is simple, it is quick, it is delicious.  There are lots of variations:  i like to add shredded chicken, and sometimes whole kernel corn (not a fan of diced ham; makes the soup too salty).

I made quite a few changes... used 8 med. potatoes and boiled.  Used one med. white onion, one med. sweet yellow onion (cooked separate pan).   3 cans condensed chicken broth, 4 cups heavy whipping cream.  Substituted "southwest chipotle" seasoning for creole seasoning.  Little more velveeta.  Omitted chicken bouillon cubes.
