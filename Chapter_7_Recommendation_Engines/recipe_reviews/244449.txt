Oven Baked Cheese Crackers Haiku: "Cinch to make this snack. But more like cracker 'nachos.' Kids gobbled this up." DD had some buddies over and they requested nachos, but I was out of tortilla chips so I made this recipe. Step 3 was a little misleading, almost implying that each cracker recieved an entire slice of cheese folded into quarters, but I just tore each slice in 1/4ths and placed the piece on the 24 crackers. 3 min. 33 sec. was just right. I sprinkled my crackers w/ Texas Pete, and the kiddos just scarfed theirs down.

For a Halloween snack I used heartier cheese, sliced cheddar and provolone, to make pumpkin and ghost cutouts with mini cookie cutters. I also used whole grain crackers. Turned out great.
